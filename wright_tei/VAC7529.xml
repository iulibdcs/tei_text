SOULZE.,   QUEST  To RALPH STANLEY: IT is one month since I saw you for the first time; I remember well the hour. It was already twilight; I stood alone in the drawing-room awaiting the return of my friends ito welcome me; they had gone out for a sail in- the yacht; you were the first of the party to arrive, and, entering the room where I stood, saluted mie courteously as you passed. I saw you Put indis- tinctly, and as you traversed the room a strange th ia l; shot through every nerve, leaving me trembling and afraid. Weary with long waiting, agitated with watching the restless, moaning sea during two hours, I was doubtless more impressible than usual, and was startled at seeing a stranger suddenly before me,; Ir calmed myself with this reflection, and when you were formally presented to me in the evening, had already forgotten the circumstance of our meeting. You then recognised me with a distant bow, and were soon engrossed in-conversation with a young girl whose loveliness attracted me.  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7529-00000004"/> 8          QUEST. ' I watc hed her varying color- and half averted eyes as she listened and replied to you; I marked her exquisite child face, *1d pondered' if it were possible for artist hands to podriay thatwhich nature had left so, faultless. Then I wondered if you' appreciated that rare, .wild-flower face-if it inspired you with mdre than a. passing interest-if you had long been friends-and turning from her, I held judgment on you. There were many persons in the, room, yet I had eyes for two only.' The 'heat soon became oppressive, and a walk on the beach was proposed by some of the party. You . gave your arm to your companion and joined the! others; the room was speedily 'deserted, Mrs. Rose and mygelf alone remaining. '"Who ;is the young girl in white?"I asked. "A niece of my husband's; his brother's only child, Amy Rose. She is to remain with us this summer; her home is in Philadelphia." "The gentleman who was beside her seemed par- ticularly interested in her," I remarked. '"I think he likes her, but only as a child, a simple, lovely, true-hearted child as,she is; all this he appre-. ciates, and as a man of the world, is doubtless refreshed with meeting a mind puire and innocent as hers, but his interest in her goes no deeper-she could not satisfy his heart." Then he is an exacting, selfish man," I exclaimed.   , i (, do -  ZQUEST.     -    9 'Not so," was the reply; ,rather one -who has formed a decided opinion. of what a woman should be, and who will always seek his ideal, though ever disappointed in finding one wlho entirely satisfies the demand of his nature.

For many years Ralph has lived abroad, and I have seen him less than others of the family, yet he has impressed me with the conviction that he is thoroughly good, true, and noble-hearted. Every one respects him; he thinks for himself and dares express his opinion; his faults are those of a marked and powerful mind, pride being the most evident." If I narrate thus the incidents of that evening, it is that I would have you follow me step by step, seeing with my eyes, hearing with my ears, and breathing with my breath read the very thoughts of my heart since that night. I will not weary you, but will make the recital brief. We met frequently after this, yet remained stran- gers; for, amongst the many persons in the crowded hotel of a fashionable watering-place seeking pleasure iad amusement to while away the summert days, I had but one friend, Mrs. Rose, and avoided making acquaintances, although I know not if any wished to share my thoughts or society. 1' *it* \    &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7529-00000005"/> 10         QUEST. Amy Rose did, indeed, try to allure me from my silence with her kind words and winning ways; if I failed to respond to her tenderness, it was not that I did not estimate it at its true value; it was rather be- cause my heart had restrained its impulses so long that I knew not how to show my affection by word or manner. Dear, artless Amy! I watched her with my eyes and followed her with my mind as the days passed on. I knew she preferred your society to that of all other men visiting her aunt; I saw, too, that you gave her much of your time; and though I could perceive that you regarded her as a child, delighting in her truthful, simple nature, I blamed yon for not resisting the charm ,of her society, lest she should be led away by the fascination your presence threw around her. The gossips of the hotel were already making ob- servations upon your attentions to Amy, and ventured Ato question Mrs. Hose, who was rather amused than alarmed, and repeated all she had said to me, insist. ing that Amy was a child, and you were not more attentive to her than to other young persons and children who -were your special favorites. -She did -not see the danger for the dear girl. I observed it, however, and remarked her emotion when her companions spoke to her jestingly of your devotion. -Thus were my thoughts drawn to you through Amy; and as in my heart an affection de- * ;    * t   QUEST.         " veloped for her, a bitter feeling sprung up against yon. you. Two weeks/ passed thus-slowly for me, swiftly for the happy-when there came a day which must stand in my past " a landmark for life." A pic-nic party to the woods, and a fishing excur- sion in the harbor, left the hotel for that day desert- ed. I had no desire to join either party, although urged by Mrs. Rose and Amy to go with them to the woods where I might find a quiet nook and enjoy tle music of the band engaged for the occasion. I resisted their entreaties and remained alone. The day was spent in occupations that satisfied my mind, and the hours passed unobserved; but as the sunset glory died out of the sky and the purple twilight gave place to the dusk of evening, there came over my spirit shadows of a past so filled with' sorrow, that I could not chase away the dark memo- ries gathering around me like despair and overwhelm- ing me with hopeless grief. I tried to rouse myself, for the thoughts crowding my brain were agony, and I knew well their power to crush my strength and subdue my fortitude. I opened the piano and soothed myself with remem- brances of Beethoven, with the strange, weird har- monies of Bach, and broken bits of melody-; then a voice, choked and hoarse, burst from my lips with Gretchen's song- "Meine ruh ist hin, mein Herz ist schwer." -  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7529-00000006"/> 12         QUEST. The song ended in!sobs. I buried my face in myn hands with the bitter cry: "How long, O God I how long " A voice startled me in the darkness and silence. I looked up. You stood before me. Confused at an occurrence so unexpected, I did not heed your words till they were twice Irepeated. You "thought the room deserted-had come for a book- had entered as I opened the piano, and were iunable to resist listening to the music--." You continued by saying-If it were not an intrusion, you would still relnain, with my permission, and ask me to for- get the interruption by keeping my seat at the piano. I did not dare trust myself to speak. It was quite dark. I rang for lights, then commenced "Lieder ohne wurte," playing one after another as they flitted through  my brain, closing with the "Friihng's lied ;" then Schumarin's "Traum " glided into the room with its soft sighs and murmurings, to pass away, leaving us again in the hush of silence. As I paused, you said--"I shall ask you for a song I wish much to, hear again; itis Schiller'S 'Sehnsucht.'" I have since felt that in asking me for this song you wished to lead my  mind from the oppressive grief you had witnessed, to thoughts that would bring peace and hope, for, as I sung, my spirit rose with the wild, sweet music, following the poet from ,  i   QUEST.         13 the chill vales of earth to, gaze on the ever-green, ever-blooming hills of Paradise; drank in the fra- grant, life-renewing air; listened to seraphic voices; saw golden fruit gleaming midst, undying verdure; flowers unfolding to eternal sunbeams, and shud- dered not at the dark river over which it must pass to reach this land outspread in mystery and beauty. When the song ended I was calm; faith had re- turned to my heart. Heaven was again a reality, Dearth but a resting-place. I heard you say-"You sing not only with your wonderful voice but with vour very soul; my thanks cannot express the plea- sure I have received; this hour's enjoyment takes ie back to my life in Germany, where I lived years together, and have remembrances dear to me that tine cannot efface." It was not your praise that made my heart beat quick with a new emotion of pleasure; it was your sympathy for mymusic-not mine, indeed, but made mine by the great love with which I cherished it. I left the piano to listen as your told me of Mendels- sohn, Chopin, Schumann--all my masters--all dear to you through personal friendship and intimacy. That you had known them and reverenced them as I did, giving them a love even surpassing my own, made me look. on you with new interest; and I lis- tened with eagerness as you recalled the hours passed with them, and gave me incidents of their lives. Ydu brought before me, also men and women with  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7529-00000007"/> "   .     QUEST. whom I had live on. in visions and so pictured them with the surroundings of their daily life, thatl almost saw them embodied and extending to me the hand of kindly greeting. So completely did you absorb my thoughts that I heard not the arrival of the absent ones, nor was I prepared to welcome Mrs. Rose and her merry party. As they entered, you were upbraided for not having kept your engage- ment to join -the pie-nic; and until then I had not even asked myself why you were not there. I heard you say you "had been detained in the city till a late hour; had thought the house deserted; came to find a book just us I opened the piano; and had the indiscretion to listen till the music compelled you to remain." Mrs. Rose, as you know, was surprised to find I was the musician; and, in reply to her questions, I told her I only indulged my love for music when alone; that I could not overcome my repugnance to per- forming before another; that it was accident which had givenme a listener then, and forced me to be- tray myself. The next day you sent me a book of manuscript music containing songs which had not been publish- ed, and melodies written down as improvised by their composers. With this book you enclosed a note. It was very short, yet I read it oftener than I sung the-songs, and lingered over it longer than over the melodies.   QUEST.         5 There was a dance that evening in the public drawing-rooms. I did not wish to be present, and determined to possess myself of the piano, that, alone and undisturbed, I might look over and learn by heart parts of the music you had sent to me. Mrs. Rose would not hear of mlly staying away from the dance. "If I did not dance, all the more reason that I should sit by her and make the evening endurable; it would give her happiness to have me with her and keep off the gossips who were the torment of her existence," she said. I resisted, but in vain; so I made myself ready to join her, casting a look of re- gret on your book as I placed it with iny treasures under lock and key. Amy was lovely that night-her blue tulle dress floating round her like a cloud--her hair drawn back in golden waves from her pure brow and folded in bands at the neck, without ornament to break the line of her small head. I heard her say, as you met us in the ball-room, in reply to words you had spoken--"Not dance I Why, I never knew any one who did not dance! Surely you can walk through a quadrille I I shall be so glad to teach you if you will let me." Her glance was eager, her sweet mouth tremulous, as she looked into your face. 4"I never- dance ; I could not, even to please so kind a little friend," was your reply. Amy's face revealed that, for her, the happiness of the evening was over; her step lingered- as she took  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7529-00000008"/> ^t6         QUEST.        y the arm of a gentleman who claimed her for the qua- drille then forming.  You came to us and gave me an opportunity of thanking you for the favor:of looking over your ma- nuscript. "It is one I have not granted before. I could not hear my songe, my favorites, sung by ordinary voices; nor could I listen to music, improvised by genius, tortured and twisted into painful contortions by clumsy fingers. I trust you will renew last night's pleasure for me soon. . All the day your voice has rung in my ears, and strange harmonies have haunt- ed my  brain. I feel as if under a spell, and am irresistibly led towards you. I hope you are not a Loreley.", I answered you seriously. I said, "music was sa- :cred to me, and I cared not to share it with another; that I had not refused to interpret it for you on the- evening previous, but a second opportunity would not probably present itself. I wished not to seem rude in my refusal, but I could not grant others what I had given to you; had youy not surprised me as you did, I never could have so betrayed myself." We wandered back to the conversation of the pre- vious evening, and I forgot my surrounding, till a gentleman was presented to me, who disappeared at once on being told I did not dance. Mrs. Rose then turned to you and said : "Surely, Mr. Stanley, you are not intending to sit here all the   QUEST.         17 evening, when so many young ladies, as they pass to and fro, seek by smiles and gracious looks to draw you away"                l,  You expressed a determination to remain till we banished you. "Then," said my friend, ' every woman in the room, young or old, will be jealous, and we must e'en suffer the penalty.'"The words were spoken jestingly, ybt they came back to my mind as, later in the evening, we sought to escape the heat of the room, and followed Mrs. Rose, who was conducted by a gentleman to the balcony. Passing through the crowd, I heard remarks on my personal appear- ance not flattering, and questions asked in a tone mali- ciously loud; the eyes I met were not all kind, and, in my humility, I felt I had no right to be there beside you, my hand on your arm. The fresh, soft night air cooled the burning flush of my bheek, and calmed my mind. I saw only the stars above, the unfa- thomable sela at our feet, and heard yourvoice, with -the wild dance-music coming in gushes through the open windows. I was silent; what could I say to you-your life and mine seemed to lie so far ,apart? You had stooped to me, and why, I knew not, gave me the treasures of your mind--so gifted. I wished the night might never: break into morning; that I might ever sit there, as then, knowing no greater joy than to look upwards to the stas, telling the glory of God, -and to listen to your voice.  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7529-00000009"/> IS         QUEST. I knew I was dreaming a dream from which I must awake; but the awakening would not be so bit- ter with the memory of the dream. l know not how-long a time we sat there; on the air came. the perfume of violets, a slight rustling sound, then another voice was in my ear, and Amy beside us.    ' "Oh, I ain so tired with dancing it Let me stay here and listen to you, Mr. Stanley; you were saying something of Italy." Mrs. Rose objected. She feared the night air for Amy, heated as she was with dancing. Finding the hour late, she suggested it was best to retire. You said, "Good night, till to-morrow!" as you took my hand in yours, and those words floated, with snatches of waltz-music, through my brain till the day dawned. The rnmorrow was there, which brought me again into your presence; and other days followed, during which we were constantly together, either walking on the beach) driving with Mrs. Rose, or wandering through the woods; often you read to us there, we seated round you, the sunlight filtering through thick foliage, making rare mosaic on the mossy ground; the restless summer wind sweeping the leaves with a murmuring accompaniment to the low, varied nelody of your voice. The evenings were given up to gaiety in which I could not join; but had I not the day hours to come   QUEST.         19 back for me, as I sat in my shadowy corner seeing and hearing those about me as in a dream? True, those hours had passed away into eternity, but their rose-light softened the heaven above me. They had dawned for me, existed for'me, left their radiance for me ; they were mine. I feasted on them, lingered with them, drew them through my heart into my very life. Was it not now the bright, sweet sum- mer time, and beyond the bitter winter*? Why should I not fill my heart with warmth, and food, and light, to cheer the gathering gloom? There came, at length, a day when I could gratify your wish to listen again to music with me. The house was deserted; it was an hour before sunset; not a sound came to disturb the peace and holy rest of that vanishing day. I opened the piano. My hands trembled as the- cold keys answered to the touch of my fingers, for the music I sought to interpret was created by genius, containing the thoughts of the loved to whom you had listened in their moments of inspiration. I soon forgot my fears; forgot my wish to give you pleasure; forgot even your presence, as, awak- ened to my touch, clear, pure tones filled the room, now singly soaring aloft like sparks of light, now ;wisted together as sunbeams ; then rising slowly in clinging chords; then rushing to pervade all space w-ith strange, deep harmonies-; again subdued, as an undertone to melody unutterably sweet. I stayed        ,   . v  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7529-00000010"/> 20        / QUEST. not my fingers till every gem was flung out, to min- gle with the liquid' sweetness floating into space be. yond. You were silent when I paused; the sun's last rays folded you in an embrace of light, but you moved not; and I plated the prelude to "Elenora." As I sung, my voice seemed a spirit longing to free itself from its-prison of flesh; it shook hiy heart with its keen, rigging cry; hitherto subject to my will, it then guided itself through the intricate, mazy tone-region, gushing out in quick, liquid notes, pour- ing a flood of sound through the space, or sinking into low, tremulous tones, that changed to sighs in the distance. "II Sogno," with its wild passion, died into silence, and I found-how, I know not-my hands imprisoned in yours. My eyes looked up through a golden mist to your face, bending over me. Like music's self were your words to my heart. "Your voice has a soul; and might that soul minister to mine here- after as now, no sin, sorrow, or blight could fall on my life. Do not struggle to fiee these little nervous, restless, transparent hands; they, too, have given me unutterable pleasure; they are artist-hands; they be- long to the artist-soul."  Could I speak, think you, my  eyes blinded by gathering tears-my heart thrilling with a strange, new delight? There was a beauty around me, more lovely .than that of: the crimson sunset flashing through the windows, flooding the room-a light '1   QUEST.         21 without shadows; there were tones thronging my brain, clinging to my pulses, and drawing up my soul to that rest for which it yearned. I was silent- silent with the first happiness of life resting over me like a spell. I shook myself free and turned to the window. The sea, the rocks, the foam-topped waves, the beach, the sails fleckering the bay-all glowed in the red evening light. "Let us go to the beach," I said, looking towards you; for I dared not stay where the very air was laden with' an intoxication more subtle than the perfume of flowers opening in the- lands of the sun. We strayed on the beach till the purple dusk deepened, and the stars trepibled in mystery above. You had never, before this, sought to induce me to speak of myself. You asked me, then, where I had passed my chil .hood, and of my teachers, espe- cially as to the development of my musical taste. My replies were vague and embarrassed, which you, perceiving, kindly turned to other subjects. When we joined the party assembled in: Mrs. Rose's parlor, a gentleman came forward to meet me, saying: "I was quite sure, when I found your studio door closed and sealed with the formidable 'out of town,' that you had strayed away to the sea side,. So I came in search of my sister artist." # ,  -t  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7529-00000011"/> 22         QUEST. Mr. Reeves' voice was clear, well toned, not harsh; yet it rung through my brain as a trumpet; I looked round helplessly, saw curious eyes fixed on mine, and heard the word "artist" repeated till it seemed glowing in red letters before my face. The quiet I had sought, the reserve I maintained, was now broken up. Ifelt like one dragged from the shadows into the blazing light, to be scanned, criticized, and annihilated. I heard an aigre-doux voice saying: "Really, Mrs. Rose, it was very unfair not to tell us of your friend's being an artist. She may have got us all down in her sketch-book." "Not much fear of that, as her subjects, being children, are young and beautiful," replied my friend. "Then, as to having been unfair, I promised if she would- come to me, that I would let her live in quiet seclusion but you shall judge if she merit that much favor and consideration from me." She opened her writing-table and drew out two sketches which she placed before you, seeming to know your judgment would have its influence with others, and trusting to your kindness to spare me pain. 1 looked into your face then, for the first time, since we entered the room. I was eager for your thoughts; loving my art in all humility, I thirsted ,for light and guidance, that I might not disgrace the profession into which I had entered with trembling, uncertain steps. I heard you say in a whisper, as if to yourself, "I said they were artist-hands;" then   jUEST.        23 you met my gaze and asked if I always painted child-heads. "Never any others," I replied. "These are ideal in conception and color, but as ideals they have real merit. You must have a great love for children to select them always as subjects. I should say, had I seen these sketches elsewhere, the artist wms seeking to fix some face lost in life, or dreamed it possible to find embodied in the flesh some stray Child of Paradise." / You did not see the tears gathering which I forced back; you knew not how deeply you had probed my heart.               , "Do you make studies- from lifet?" you asked. "Yes, and thus live umyself; for art is humiliated to provide bread for my mouth, and- gives me a home for my mother." " You have a mother--and she "- "Is a widow," I answered. "We are alone in the world-we live for each other." And now, I thought, as I said these words, "He will know  I 'am poor, friendless, name- less--with no one to help me fight the battle of life; with only my weak, woman's arm to pro- tect me; he will see that his life and mine lie apart, and will turn aside to let me pass on alone." My thoughts were bitter; ,our voice roused me again. "You are very young to take care of yourself and  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7529-00000012"/> 24          UEST. to have made such progress. How long have you been studying?" "Five years unceasingly; my master as Alston's pupil; he gave me my first lessons when I was scarcely'seventeen; I am not young; years have little to do with age in some lives, and I have lived to feel old." Mr. Reeves interrupted us-; he wished me to return to my studio, to take the portraits of two children 'who were making a short stay in the city. It was really a kind act which had brought him to me, and yet I wished he had stayed away. I felt my visit must terminate. It seemed no longer as pleasant for me to remain; I gave myself one week imore, at Mrs.'Rose's urgent entreaty, and promised then to be ready. to renounce pleasure and repose for work and care. I thought after this evening you would withdraw from my society; I was little prepared for the exclusive and marked attention you continued to give me. As Mr. Reeves insisted on remaining till the week was over, and was frequently with me, I became at once conspicuous, and drew unwittingly the attention of all the idlers and gossips. of the place; that a man of your position, and a distin- guished artist, should prefer my society to the 'brilliant women and beautiful girls surrounding us- was a matter to be looked into. What was I? a "humble artist, without merit, whom nobody knew or   QUEST.         25 cared to know. Who was I? Some said I was a widow; others that I had a husband living from whom I was separated; the fault--very possibly mine. Surmises and suggestions, at first only whispered, passing from lip to lip, became conviction and reality. Those beautiful women who, for very refinement, would gather up their trailing garments, lest a weak insect in their path might be crushed, tore aside my coverings, dissected and annihilated me with their white hands-their lips smiling cruelly at my torture, their sweet eyes gazing steadily avs the blood-drops oozed from wounds they probed. There were not wanting tongues to drop the poison of malice and uncharitableness -into your ear, re- peating hateful lies which had sprung into life from darkness, and could not be traced to their birth-hour. ]Mrs. Rose, was my friend;, true when most- I needed her. She soothed and: consoled me in her own kind way, and assured me, when I was no longer there to monopolize your attentions, my name would be forgotten or a reaction might take place in my favor. You well know I never sought your society, and that Mrs. Rose was present at our interviews; but why should I linger here, or why recall-the troubled moments which obscured my dream of happiness? The very unkindness of others, their neglect and coldness towards me, inclined you the more to seek me.  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7529-00000013"/> 26         QUEST. We had hours devoted to music, when we were drawn together by a mysterious influence, uniting us in perfect sympathy; those hours you told me were so dear to you that you wished they might linger for ever; and I would have given my very life in song to have thus secured your happi- ness. You aided me -in my art-gave me advice regarding color and drawing; lent me books in Geflnan and Italian to guide me; brought sketches and studies gathered with toil and care during your wanrderings in other lands. How I listened to and lingered on every word falling from your lips in those hours, gathering them into my heart-pearls and diamonds to fling their radiance over my soul, when they alone, of this pre- sent, should be mine. Thus, the days glided by till the last came. That day I determined to see dawn on my life, and, before sleeping the night that preceded it, I threw open my window blinds, that the first day-beam  might awaken me. The night was bright, the moon pouring floods of light on the sleep- ing earth; from my bed I could watch the sea tossing and foaming, fire gems capping every wave. Thus watching, I fell into a kind of dream-trance; I thought the path of light across the waters became solid as a bridge of gold, from which rose slowly to the sky column after column of light, spanned by arches that pierced the heaven above; clinging to the pillars and swinging from arch to- arch, were   QUEST.         27 festoons of fern-like leaves, vines, tendrils, fruits and flowers, all of the same beamy, mystic splendor, while, through the delicate tracery, points of light flashed like gems. 'Far away these pillars expended, till the vista closed in a burning mist, dazzling my eyes with its splendor. The interior of a vast cathedral, where pure spirits worshipped, seemed revealed to me, and an unutter- able desire possessed me to join them; with the wish, I found myself within those aisles of light. Through the space trembled the heavy, deep bass of an organ; this sound, vibrating through me, unmin- gled with other tone, was becoming insupportable, when, floating like a boat on the billows, came a strain of ineffable melody-then a murmur of sounds rushing quick, increasing in depth and power, till ;he place was filled with one dense cloud of music; [ was impelled forward, and on I sped; the count- ess arches closed before me, making the distance -eem interminable; that wondrous music swayed me till, yet a vague fear possessed me as the melodies ,rew measured and mournful. I saw at last the loly of holies was neared; the presence which had irged me onward was no longer a mystery; for here, without the chancel you stood; behind you a rightness I could not penetrate. I reached but my Lands to place them in yours, opened to greet me, rhen lo! between us hung a crystal screen; I could ( )ok through it; I had not seen it in my path for its e   &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7529-00000014"/> 285         QUEST. very transparency; it moved not to my touch; it sveptt across the whole length and breadth of the cathedral; it fell from roof to floor, dividing us like - a wall. To you it seemed invisible; you stood smiling and waiting to clasp me in those arms I so longed to reach. The music hushed to sobs and wailing-my voice rose shrill and piercing with a cry of despair. A The dream vantished; I awoke to see the moon- light struggling with the red dawn, and the dream- light lying as a spell over the waters. The day broke glorioisly; it came flashing in crimsons and gold over heavens and sea, and I watched from my window, striving' to impress every fleeting moment on brain and- heart. I made' a sketch of the shore, with rugged rocks dipping into the bay, the fishermen's cottages dotting the beach, with the 'wooded hills rising abruptly beyond. Then I sketched from memory the face of a child I had often seen gathering shells in the sand--the onlv face I had wished to take away as a remembrance. I was leaving my room for breakfast, when a cas- ket was brought to me. There was no name to tell the giver. Opening it, I found a cluster of half-blown white moss roses; hidden in fern leaves. I drew one from the rest and placed it on my bosom. Its silvery brightness dispelled the gloom of my black dress, as its perfume stole to my heart.   QUEST.         29 You joined us on leaving the breakfast room:; then I knew who had sent the roses. We went to the woods for the morning. You read to us Prometheus, from Shelley, and thie exquisite version of Psyche's wanderings by Apuleius; while Mrs. Rose embroidered, Mr. Reeves and Amy cut paper flowers, and I drew in my sketch-book her changing attitudes. We did not return to the house for lunch; it was brought by the servant. After the reading, we had a merry time till the carriage came. We drove till six o'clock, the hour for din- ner. As we were separating, you asked me to go out in your boat with you at sunset. I assented, if Mrs. Rose would join us, to which she agreed; at the hour of departure she was detained by visitors, but insisted on my accompanying you without her, as she had often heard me express a wish to row across the bay. The sun was sinking when you pushed your boat from the shore; it seemed a fairy structure, but the seats were luxuriously cushioned, and although we were rocking on thel restless waves, there came over me a feeling of calm repose. The heavens were aglow, the sea a quivering sheet of flame, the fisher- Inen's cottages were golden in splendor; every grain of sand on the white beach glittered a gem. Every change in our position revealed new beau- ties around and above. We came at last to a little  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7529-00000015"/> 30         QUEST. inlet where the sea had washed a wide gap from the shore. Three walls of solid rock' rose to a great height above us; it seemed like a retiring room for- the spirits of the wave to sport in, so secluded was the place from the sea and shore. Htere yoh rested. The moon rose with the flush of sunset on her face, looking into every nook of our retreat; then your voice stole to my ear, mingling like music with the soft plash of the waters, as you repeated that exqui- site poem, "The Culprit Fay.', "I cannot sing; but I give you the melodies of a poet's heart," you said. "It is happiness for me to listen," I replied; " and to-morrow, though the scene be changed, I shall hear the same tones, the same words-a melody and a remembrance to carry in my heart for ever."

I loved you when I saw you stricken in an agony of grief, that first hour that revealed you to me; -loved you, as your delicious voice poured out the music of your soul- loved you as I watched, day by day, the unfolding of your earnest, true, spiritual mind. I know not your sorrows; they must have been bitter and keen; I love you. also for them; I would take you into my heart to cherish you with infinite tenderness, and soothe you to forgetfiness of all that disturbs you."

"Adelaide, be mine--lay your burdens on my heart; I will bear them through life. Adelaide, could you, can you love- me?" There was suffering in the tone; I laid my hands, all wet with tears, on your head bowed before me- and God heard me when I said: "I do love you-- with the first love of my life-my first, my only love!"

Let me hear the words again; they are to me the dawning of new hopes, of boundless happiness." How could I speak words which should darken that earnest, radiant face looking up to mine; how could I endure to lose a love so precious? Yet I must speak; I dared not rest in the light of that face fixing mine with perfect trust. You will never know the struggle it cost, or the spasm of agony that contracted my heart, as again I said: "We must part, even with this great love between us. We must part because I love you too well to deceive you; and I know, could you read every page of my life, you would also say-We must part." Oh, the weak woman's tears thatwould rain down-- the weak heart that could not control its wail of sorrow! I wrung my hands from your tightening clasp, that I might not look into your face; I could not, would not, se its pain. I heard the low, solemn tones of your voice changed with a jar of bitterness: "And this past-is i: then so hideous in guilt or wretchedness that it cannot be mine?

It was the shadow of a great darkness sweeping over me; but I answered: It shall be as you wish. It was my desire to tell you all, and yet I would fain have spared myself and you, knowing in the end it would be the same as if we had strength to part at once. But you are so noble, so generous in your love; so ready to take me to your heart without doubt or distrust, that I can no longer shrink from a duty imperative though bitter. Give me but a few days, and allow me to write; it is better thus, for I cannot trust myself to speak of much you must learn." "And I may visit you in your mother's home, may I not, Adelaide?" you urged. "Let us part to-night without a promise of meet- ing," was my answer. "You will wait till I have written, without seeking me; and till you have read those pages of my life seek to forget all that you have said to-night.

We glided away from that rocky recess over the bright waters, and as I watched you, enveloped in a cloud of- light, swaying to and fro with the rocking ,boat I could but think of you as an angel sent to pour the balm of heaven into my bruised and weary heart. At parting, you took my hands in yours and kissed them. I ran swiftly through the -halls to iny room, that these hands, made sacred, by the seal of your love, might not be profaned by any other touch. I threw open the window and looked over the wa- ters. I tried to realize that I stood there alone, and that yonder was the ocean retreatwhere your words had stolen like music to my heart, and quickened to life my slumbering soul. But the happiness was too intense ; it hung over me heavily, even as a grief. I held up my hands in the moonlight to see if they kept the burning mark of your lips. Fain would I hold them thus, white and pure from every other touch, for ever! I heard the village bells strike the passing hours. I saw the night move on in glory and majesty to the dawning of a new day. I slept not, nor left the win- dow where I mjgft gaze towards the spot consecrated by our last meeting.

Let me linger with them still, drawing them as the breath of heaven into every pore of my being, multiplying the days to weeks, the weeks to months, thus cheating myself with the delusion that I have lived years in my dream.

Fain would I bring before you her matchless beauty; unfold to you her pure spiritual mind, her unselfish love, and her sorrows. She was the daughter of an English naval officer. During his absence on duty, my mother,-went with her aunt to travel on the continent, and at Baden Baden met the man she was destined to marry. Be- ing an American, he was not esteemed by the proud old officer a suitable person for his daughters hand. My mother, befriended by her aunt, notwithstanding every obstacle, was married to the man she loved, and returned with him immediately to his Southern- home in New Orleans, where, enfolded in his love, and cherished with unwavering tenderness, she for- got her father's curse, and became reconciled to a home in a strange land. During a summer journey, made to escape the oppressive heat of the Southern climate, they came to Boston. The city reminded my mother of her owln English towns, and it was decided they should remain in its vicinity till the autumn.

My ister was taken/ill and died. I was too young to know my own loss then, yet, much as I have since longed for her love and companionship, I would not have had her life burdened with my sorrows.                , The early years of my childhood I remember well. The luxurious Southern home, the yearly sea-voyage Northward-for in those days we went by sea from New Orleans to Bosfon--the little cottage in Brook- dale, where I, a romping, noisy child, had rare fun and frolic; my mother's tender care, my father's affection, all remain mirrored in my mind, as if the years were but now vanishing, instead of being long since past. I was the only child after my sister's death. My father's great happiness was to have me beside him; he taught me to speak and read French, and being an excellent musician, he delighted to teach me his favorite songs. My ear was correct, my voice a natural ift, and my progress was beyond my years. I could play, at the agefof seven, every exercise and scale in both major and minor keys of my instruc- tion book, for which my music master took to him- self great credit. My progress was owing to my   QUeST.         43 father's patience in sitting beside me during my study hours. I was much indulged; all my child- whims and fancies gratified; enjoyments were mine denied to most children, and I thought they would always remain. I had never known sorrow till I entered my eighth year;then it came suddenly and unexpectedly. It was early in May. We were preparing, as usual, for our journey Northward, when my father said he should be unable to accompany us, an important law-suit detaining him, which might keep him seve- ral weeks in the city. My mother entreated we might remain, but the season was unusually warm, and he thought we had best leave at once, all ar- rangements having been completed for our depar- ture.  I cannot forget, that parting. IMy mother was almost broken-hearted-; it was the first separation Since their marriage. She clung to my father, con- vulsed with grief, and when he left her, she knelt on the spot where he had stood, and, stretched out her arms imploringly towards him. My   own sorrow was bitter, but he promised I should soon see him again if I would dry my tears; and his last directions to me were-to practise n music faithfully, and think he was beside me duing those hours. It was a weary voyage. On arriving at the little cottage, we found it very lonely; to me the days seemed unendingly long.

[My mother did not neglect me ; she interested herself jn my childish pursuits, and exerted herself to artse me, but I knew it was weary work for her. I aw she was sad, even when she smiled. My greatest pleasure was in watching for the postman that I might take her a letter from my father; she wAdld kiss it before breaking the seal, and her face had a thousand varying lights as she read it. Weeks passed; they had counted twice the numr ber we had thought to wait for his coming; the month of roses had fed, and summer days were glowing round us. Onre morning my mother came late to breakfast; she was very pale; I thought she was ill. She said no'to my inquiries, but that she had been disturbed by strange and fearful dreams. All the day she was very quiet and absorbed in thought; I could not at- tract her attention; she hardly spoke to me. At sunset I entreated her to walk to the woods. As we went along, I heard her repeat to herself several times-"It was only a dream." "Oh, tell me what it was, mother!"I cried at last, half frightened at her words and her manner. We had reached the wood; she drew me beside her on the ground, and said, in a, trembling voice-"I thought, in my dream, that I stood on the border of a dense forest, by an open, far extending plain. As I gazed into the distance, I saw a cloud of light on   the horizon, moving slowly forward; it :filled the space between earth and heaven, and glowed red, like fire. As it approached, I was terror-struck I tried to move, but could not. On it came, and whlen it was close to me, I perceived a man on a large black horse, enveloped in flames. He held out his armnns towards me. He seemed in pain; he called my name; it was your father. Before I could think, he was gone, and my agony awoke nme. It was long before I fell asleep again ; then I seemed to stand in a wide, low building, where many were lying with faces like death. I moved forward and came to a bed, where I saw him looking beseechingly towards me. He called to me, and as I bowed over him, I saw  his face grow still and cold-he was dead. The cry I gave awoke me, and as I awoke I heard his voice in the room, near me, call, 'Mary, Mary."' My mother said no more. A vague feeling of terror seized me, but, child as I was, I could not un- derstand her fears. I will not linger on the days that followed; one came, bringing the postman.  I snatched the letter fitrom his hand, nor paused to look at it till I reached my mother. She was half dressed, combing her hair, which fell in dark waves to her knees. I rushed into her arms, holding up the letter with eager joy. She took it, looked at it a moment, uttered a cry, and winding her hair in her hands, walked the room, a moan coming from her lips that went to my inmost   &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7529-00000023"/> "         QUEST. heart. I fo lowed and clung to her unheeded. At last I called to her--"Where is my father!"Then she knelt beside me and put the letter into my hand. "Open it; I cannot," she said. I broke the black seal, and, as I gave it to her, I knew it was not my father's writing. She read with wild, strained eyes; then fell on the floor, white and-still. They came to her at my cry, but when she recovered she was unconscious of all about her. For three months she remained ill and in danger. Oh, those months of misery to me I I knew I had no father; I was told of his sudden death by yellow fever; he had died on the night of my mother's fearful dreams. They told me fears were entertained as to her recovery. I could only wander alone, out of sight of human eye, and call passionately on my father to return to me. I would not believe I was never again to see him. Then I would pray that my mother might be spared to me; that, at least, she might know and call me by name once more. Shei came back to life slowly, yet all too soon for her 6wn peace and rest. When she was able to resume her duties, and take her old place be- side me as teacher and companion, I saw she was changed. Her hair was white on the temples; lines marked her face; her beauty had fled with thed life which fed and nourished it.          I -lMy mother idecided to remain at the North.

My mother's English reserve was called coldness by the more impulsive Southern people amongst whom she had made her home; but those who knew her well, loved her for her steadfastness and truth, her gentle, unassuming goodness. I know not why she preferred, after my father's death, a residence at the North amongst strangers -for those about us were strangers; my mother had avoided making acquaintance in the summer sojourn at Brookdale, wishing rest and repose after the excite- nments of her h9me-life. When we arrived at Xew Orleans arrangements were made to sell the estate, and the furniture of the house was packed to send North. It was much too elegant for our quiet cottage, but my mother could not part with any thing she had used and associated with our loved one's memory. We visited daily t spot where he was buried, and marked with a white cross his resting-place. Those Were days of bitterness and pain.

My mother had an aversion to the negro race, and I think it was one reason for her leaving the South. I was never again the same hap- py child after losing my father and my Southern home. Months-glided by.- We were living quietly, yet every comfort wtiich wealth could give to make life luxurious and enjoyable was ours. My mother devoted five hours daily to my studies. She taught me herself, being unwilling to send me to a school or entrust me to a governess. Shoe was shocked at the freedom allowed to American children, and deter- mined to keep me from influences she thoughtinju- rious. I cannot say I enjoyed the restraint. { I cer- tainly longed to make friends with every child I saw. There were attempts on the part of our neighbors to be civil and kind; but my mother's grief hung heavily over her, and she shrunk away from the cu- riosity or sympathy of others. This was our life during two years; then it changed. News came from New Orleans that the banker with whom all our property was intrusted had involved himself in speculations and fled from the country, leaving runi and misery for thousands behind him. There was no disguising the evil.; we were penniless., Fortunately we had a roof over us; the little cottage was ours.   QUEST.         49 My mother had a friend in her physician; he had beei her confidant and adviser in the terrible suffer- ing that had crushed her, and now when this new trial came he aided and assisted her, helping to arrange our home and prepare to face misfortune steadily. At first we did not feel our poverty, but as the years went by it met us at every turn.  First we parted with the furniture that had remained in boxes as it arrived from our old home; then the silver plate and pictures were sold. Gradually my mother's ornaments and jewels disappeared. We tried to live with less and less day by day; soinetimes we had butonemeal.  After many struggles my mother managed, through needlework and writing, to pro- vide us with life's necessities. It is not for me to weary you with the details of our life; we were poor---very poor. We were isolated from the world; our pleasures were few. Yet the days went on, and we had, in the great love that united us, a happ iness misery could not take from us. My studies were never neglected; music I pursued without a  teacher, fulflling my father's request to think him beside me in my  hours of study. Over my piano hung his portrait. In summer it was decked with the sweetest wild flowers, for he loved these best; in winter it was festooned with evergreen and scarlet berries; as I looked up from my seat, the large dreamy eyes seemed answer. 3  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7529-00000025"/> ,        o 60         QUESTr. ing mine; the perfect lips seemed tremulous with words of comfort for my soul. I would not have said an evil thing or given way to a bad impulse in that room containing my father's picture under any pressure of circumstances; for foolish as the thought was, that portrait seemed to have something of his life. It would not have affected me thus had it not been his very counterpart. With his memory I associated music; it was the spiritual food that sustained me in those child-days of sorrow; and, as I grew into girlhood, it became the life, within my life. Night after night, in summer twilight and by winter firelight, my mother and I would sit together giving vent in music's tone-lan- guage, to the spirit's grief and longings. Sometimes improvising, oftener finding expression for our own-- feeling in the compositions of our favorite masters. My mother sang English and Italian songs delight- fully; her voice-pure soprano-was sweet, clear and full toned. Music was our only real joy; it entered into our lives as a blessing; it rested over us, a holy influence lifting us upwardswithwingsof light when our hearts failed us, for the gloom around. You now comprehend why I cannot interpret music for others; why, to admit others to that inner life apart from the world life without, would seem to me like tearing away the veil from my soul's face.

QUEST.         51 old restless impulsiveness, I was soothed by my gentle mother's unceasing efforts to be a companion for me. Our neighbors had ceased to trouble them- selves about us; they said my mother was reserved to haughtiness, nor could they understand her afflic- tions. Now and then an old friend would visit us from the South, but such occasions were rare. I had passed my fifteenth birth-day anniversary, when one day, returning from a walk, I found my mother seated in our little parlor with two gentle-- men. The one I recalled as having been, in the old days, my father's dear friend. He was pleased to find he had so little changed that I recognized him, and presented to me his nephew, Robert Mandevil, a fine-looking man of the blonde type; a very good brow, set off by a cloud of flaxen hair; eyes large and blight, of a blue so deep they seemed black; a face strikingly pale, with lips so colorless they miade the mouth harsh. I saw no dissonance in the face; I looked at him with pleasure and listened with eagerness to his conversation, for he came fresh from the world I had already pictured to my mind as filled with mystery and delight. He told me his family resided in New York; his uncle, Mr. Mandevil, and himself were visiting in the neighborhood, wherp they might still remain a few weeks. After this first visit, Mr. Mandevil came to see ' my mother daily, usually accompanied by his  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7529-00000026"/> 52-         QUEST. nephew. It was not in our power, to offer hospi- tality or much entertainment to our guests; but they were admitted more intimately into our secluded life than ever others had been. My mother en- joyed the society of her old friend; he brought back the days of her happiness. His sympathy for her sorrows was real; his consolations came from a warm, unselfish heart. The misfortune that had overwhelmed and isolated us from the world was one from which he, too, had suffered; although with him, the evil had not weighedheavily. Robert Mandevil was an orphan; his father had established himself in early life in New York, where, as a lawyer, he met with success and enjoyed an envi- able reputation, not only for talent, but sterling worth; added to which he possessed thl advantages of wealth, that gave him a position and influence in society. He lost his wife when his children, a son and daughter, were young; Robert was the younger. It was natural I should like Robert Mandevil, coming as he did into our monotonous life, gay, amusing and attractive, with the refined tone and manner of one having an agreeable position to sus- tain in the world, and accustomed to please in so- ciety. He had been well educated, conversed agree- ably, and had that rare attraction-a pleasant, well modulated voice; his wisdom was not profound, nor was his wit brilliant; his cynicism and sarcasm were too well clothed in pleasant words to disturb my   QUEST.         F 53 mind; he seemed to me rarely gifted and endowed. I delighted in his society, and awaited with eagePr ness his daily visit. Mr. Mandevil said to my mother, jestingly one day: "You must not let my scapegrace of a nephew turn the head of your little gir ; for he is a wild, roving fellow, and not worth a thought from 'her." That night when we were alone, my mother looked into my face, with her loving, earnest eyes, and asked if Robert Mandevil's frequent visits gave me great pleasure. I answered frankly I liked him better than any person, save -her own dear self, and was sorry he could not remain longer near us. I hardly knew then how entirely I had taken him into my life, making him the centre of every thought. It was so new and delightful to have a companion who never wearied answering all my questions as to the restless, busy world beyond, and who seemed to enjoy my frank, outspoken impressions of life as received through him. I quite held him as a superior being, till one day, in speaking of the opera, he said: "It would be very stupid and tiresome to listen to music for three hours if one had not beautiful, well-dressed women to look at and friends with whom one might chat during the evening. Music was a bore!" I ques- tioned him again and again, to make sure my ears had not deceived me; he still insisted he had no liking for music and that to him "all melodies  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7529-00000027"/> 54         QUEST. were alike; harmony was beyond him." When I said I had never heard an orchestra, and that to lis- ten to one would give me intense happiness, he told me he was quite sure a box of bon-bons would please me as well. I perceived that here we could have no sympathy, and resolved never to let him know how great was my disappointment in finding him incapable of appreciating that which made my highest enjoyment. It struck a blow on my heart, to find a man whom I was proud to call friend, so without a soul, as it seemed to me; and after this I never found his society so attractive, yet I could not banish him from my thought. The day came that obliged Mr. Mandevill to leave for New York; his nephew asked permission to re- new his visits to us in the autumn, when he had promised to be the guest of his friends in the neigh- borhood.  It was lonely for us both after they were gone. My mother missed her old friend, and I thought how bright all the mornings had dawned on days I knew would bring Robert Mandevil to my side. I did not look the child I was at fifteen. I was tall and well developed, physically; yet I was as much a child in innocence as in the wayward impulsiveness that gave expression to my thoughts. I was a very child at heart, acting out frankly and truly my nature. I was always truthful in those days; I have tried hard to keep my lips from lying    QUEST.         55 since, but I dare not say I have always spoken out the honest feeling of my mind in these later years. That summer was one to be remembered. Its golden days, its starry nights, fresh in my mind again as then, bring back my humble home, its quiet life, my girlhood's calm. I thought then the days passed slowly; I endeavored to engross the time, making work for myself wherever I could find it. In my restlessness I persuaded my mother to take longer walks than usual, and to pass hours by the lake-side, a mile distant from our dwelling-she, occupied by needle-work or writing, I, watching the changing lights made by fleeting clouds ok&amp; the landscape extending into the blue distance, and dreaming of the restless world beyond the bright hill-tops. But not for us was the frequent luxury of dream- ing; we were forced to make a desperate struggle against want. There was no rest for my gentle mother, and I was old enough to be useful in assist- ing her in many ways. I had often pondered in my mind how I might render her burden lighter, and determined to bear my share of the care and anxiety pressing sorely on her. I thought I might possibly aid her by teaching, and pursued my studies eagerly to this end. She made no objection to my plans as I unfolded them, bu t she looked with great dread into such a future for-me; her fear of the world made her shrink from its contact with nervous  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7529-00000028"/> 56' QUEST. timidity, and rather than send me into it alone, she would have endured far greater poverty and priva- tion. When autumn came with its delicious days, its hazy, dreamy lights and shadows, its rich odors of fruit and flower, its glowing, burning colors on hill- side, field, and forest, it brought also Robert Man- devil. I welcomed him gladly. Aside from my mother he was the only being who had been to me a companion. There was a peculiar charm in the interest he ever manifested for me. It was the first incense to my vanity; unconsciously received, it is true,yet pleasant as the sweet perfume of flowers, as the music strains I loved. He came daily, as before, passing hours in our society; nor wearied he of our simple, quiet life. There seemed with us little to attract him, a gay man of the world; we did our best to make him forget all the care and sorrow of our surroundings, although we did not strive to hide them, withdraw- ing them only, as we would every thing unplea- sant, from the presence of one we honored as a guest. He knew our griefs; he knew the loneliness of our solitude; yet he continually sought us, and said often he was happier there than he could be else- ,where. At last he told me why he lingered, why he could not stay away. '"Could I love him?" he asked. It was a strange, startling question for me to hear;   QUEST.         57 I a child-he a-man nearly twice my age. Love, to him, meant giving up life .and all for his sake, for- saking others, holding him supreme in heart and brain. Love, to me, was the worship I gave one angel, ever present in my daily life, though the breath of heaven swept between us; was the pure, deep affection-I gave my mother, who had my first thought, from whom I could not separate. This I told him, as, flushed and confused, I heard his words and snatched back the hand he sought to hold. He listened calmly as I said impulsively all my thought. Then he drew from me the confession, that I placed him next my mother in my heart; that I had been restless in his absence and impatient for his re- turn; that to part from him without the hope of seeing him again would be pain. He said "he was satis- fied with what I called my friendship for him; that time would develop the feeling to a deeper affec- tion than any I had known. He could wait." My mother was overwhelmed with surprise and- dismiay as she listened to his declaration of love for me.  "I was but a child," she said; "I had not seen the world; I knew not my own mind; she could not part with me; she never thought of giving me up to another; I was her one treasure, the joy of her life." "It was because I  was a pure, innocent child, unaffected and true-hearted, that he loved me," he 3*   &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7529-00000029"/> 58         queer said; then he related his early life; his boyhood un- watched by a mother's. tenderness, his manhood wasted in the amusements and excitements of so- ciety, his father's loss, which had made him indiffe- rent to success in the profession for which he was destined; his many disappointments as he came to know the hypocrisy of those about him; his sister's worldliness, and his desire for a home entirely his own, with a being to love, trust, and cherish as ( his wife. My mother pitied him as she listened, and had faith in him, for his eloquence touchedher heart; then he loved me, and when she became accustomed to the thought, she did not like him less for loving one so dear to her. It was long before she consented to our be trothal, and after that Robert Mandevil looked on me as belonging to him. He, talked with me of his past, of his friends, of the future life we should lead; it seemed very pleasant as he sketched it; of his sister, who did not appear lovable as he described her: "Her beauty was remarkable; she had been for years the reigning belle of the city, had scores of: lovers, and had refused the best matches in the country; she was very proud, fond of power, and had not met the man who. could so engross her heart that she would resign her present position to devote her life to him." She was also, as it seemed, very jealous of her brother's affection, and he evidently dreaded writing   QUEST.         59 to her of the new relation in which he stood to us. When he did write, the reply to his letter came by return mail. He did not read it to me, but crushed it in his hands, as over his face came a look so cruel and hard, it frightened and distressed me. "She does not like'it," he said; " but never mind; if she does not consent, it will be all the worse for her fiture." I minded not his sister's ill-will, but it troubled me to see his face and hear the tone in which he spoke of her. Over our home the days passed swiftly and in gladness. I was happy in the present, and looked with joy to the future. Our engagement was kept very quietly to ourselves, as my mother did not wish me to become an object of remark or curiosity; she accompanied us one night to the play with great reluctance, yielding only to my desire to see a the- atre and hear an orchestra; poor as was the music, it delighted me, and as for the play it enchanted me; this was my first glimpse of the world. He left us; then came his letters, followed by him- self; thus the winter passed. In every visit he urged my mother to consent to our marriage; his impatience at her delay became so great that she finally decided on my sixteenth birth-day for our bridal. It was agreed that she should share our home during the winter; and that we would return with her for the summer to Brookdale.

As the time drew near for our marriage,:a letter came to announce the visit of Miss Mandevil, who wished, she wrote, "to see and know the bride her brother had- chosen." ' I was alone when she came; as she entered the room she seemed to fill up all the space around; a something in her manner made me conscious of what an insignificant being I was. I felt bewildered as she clasped my hands, and, bending over me, searched the depths of my eyes, saving: "-How did such a mere child find a way to rob me of my brother's heart? A very child, with curls over your shoulders yet!" I felt as if I must at once' gather up my curls and hide them away; her eyes made me uncomfortable; her voice was cutting my nerves like an east wind; I looked, felt, and acted like less than a child; I seemed suddenly to lose my powers of speech and become an idiot. My mother came to my aid; our visitor laid- aside her travelling costume and re-ap- peared in all her radiant beauty. She was tall, perfectly formed, to her faultless feet and hands; her hair was so golden that it fairly glittered, even when the sunbeams did not lend it lustre, and but for its   QUEST.         61 color would have seemed too abundant, as it lay in a heavy coil at the back of her head; her eyes were a purple blue, shaded by long lashes; nose and mouth were good; the complexion exquisite; hber face was so free from line or blemish, its moulding so perfect, that one would have thought her scarcely twenty, though her age was really thirty. I observed her as she sat talking, and noted that she never lost her fixed cold look, that she rarely smiled, and even then, the lines of her face were un- changed; not so with my mother, whose every   / thought swept over her countenance a new expres- sion; there was light on her brow, in her eyes, on her lips, as she spoke of me; then a shadow stole over, her features as she alluded to giving me up to another. Sarah Mandevil listened and replied unmoved; she spoke of her brother and the exceeding love she gave him, as she did of the dust clinging to her travelling dress. I wondered not, as I watched and listened to her, that her face had retained its fresh beauty, so free from trace of time or sorrow. Everything she said or did gave the same im- pression of unfeeling selfishness and narrow scope of mind. One night she asked for music; as I excused myself, she opened the piano and played one of Weber's delicious fantasias. Her style was cold, unimpassioned, and brilliant; it made me shiver as if ice had been rubbed over all my nerves.  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7529-00000031"/> 62       - QUEST. I will not dwell on her visit. She remained a few days; but in that time I think I learned, through her kindness, all 'the faults and vices her brother had developed since infancy. I was warned not to ex- pect too much happiness, as he had never been faith- ful to any attachment, and was told, that when he met me, he was perishing of ennui, was charmed by the novelty of our life and my entire ignorance of the world.                : She said she should remain in her brother's house for a month or two after his marriage, and then it was arranged that we should accompany her to Staten Island. In all she said, there seemed a studied effort to be disagreeable; yet it was said with so much civility, one could not reply in an unkind spirit. I not only disliked, I was positively afraid of her. We were glad when she left us alone; then my mothler told me she should not visit us in New York till Miss Mandevil was established in her own resi- dence; that it would be best for me, for us all. No entreaty would change my mother's determination, and I became gradually reconciled to her will. Mr. Mandevil wrote from New Orleans, in reply to my mother's letter announcing our approaching marriage, that he should be present to give away the bride. He wished I had more years, and his nephew more wisdom.            , Again May awoke the sleeping earth with bright, I        X   QUEST.         63 sunny days. On my bridal morning the lilac hedge was softened with feathery tufts of flowersj violets purpled the ground; apple-blooms burst into a rosy cloud through the orchard; birds sang in the oak grove, wondering why the red-tipped leaves were only half unfolded to hide their gladness. We went to the village church and were married without parade; then returning to our home, my mother took off my white robes and we wept together, for it was a bitter parting. I hung my bridal wreath of fresh roses and orange buids over my father's portrait; with tears and kisses I left it to join my husband. Hours of weary travel-and then we were in the city, where I was to make my home. A carriage awaited us at the dep6t; as we were rolling over the pavement, my husband told me it was built expressly for me. How enchanted I was! I examined it closely, sat on both seats, wished to stop its pro- gress that I might look at the exterior, and decided in my mind how seldom I should walk, now that a carriage was at my disposition. We drew up in a square before a large house; its door was thrown open, and I was made wel- come. The hall in which I stood was spacious and gloomy, wainscoted with dark wood, hung with din- gy, time-stained-pictures; dark doors stood blocking some passage that might lead to the sun-light. One  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7529-00000032"/> "        QUEST. of these swung open, and Sarah Mandevil came to greet us. The room I entered was so filled with furniture I could hardly move to a chair. I was possessed with a desire to make my way straight through the collec- tion of tables, stands, and vases, to the room beyond, equally encumbered. My own rooms, to which I retired, were cheerful and home-like. The boudoir - was fitted up in exquisite taste; the bed-room to which it led was pretty and comfortable, with rose-tinted hangings and coverings, mirrors long and wide in- creasing the light and space. I thought I should pass much of my time in those rooms, so little did I know of the life before me. I shall always think Mr. Mandevil married me from love. I had not wealth, beauty, nor the fasci- nation mental superiority gives-often swaying with more subtle power the heart and will of man than the most bewitching symmetry and grace. But if he loved me, I had not the power to keep his affec- tion ; it died out of his heart in a very short time after our marriage. I did not deceive him as to my affection for him; it never increased or developed beyond that I first expressed. It was the love of a child. As a wife, I became conscious that there existed a love exceeding that for father, mother, brother, friend; a love unselfish, engrossing, absorbing; de- vouring soul and flesh, yet uniting both by its mys-   QUEST.         65 terious power; a love that could tear aside all natural coverings, and stand unveiled in its purity to the chaste eyes of angels. That to be a true wife, such love should fill my soul, absorb my sense, and make me even a second self to the-man I called hus- band. That for this love alone was the holy sacra- ment of marriage. /I knew it was not mine; it was beyond me. I awakened to a consciousness that without it marriage was false, its joys turned to bit- terness, its holy vows profaned. Was it his fault, was it mine, that he loved me no longera The change was incomprehensible to me then; coldness and indifference soon became neglect and aversion; his words were harsh and irritable, and my tears annoyed him. At first I was grieved at his unkindness; then it made me angry, and I told him all that was in my heart, at which he called me an "unformed girl-a fool;" bitterly reproaching himself that a caprice for me had induced him to make me his wife. Unkindness and cruelty roused within me a demon that had slept during my life under the influence of affection. I no longer recognised myself, as my aversion for him daily strengthened, and the evil working within, gradually burnt out that which was good, leaving me false, bitter, and hard. Even my girlish face changed; its bright, sunny smile was gone for ever; my voice jarred on my ear; my step became measured and slow. s            .       .   &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7529-00000033"/> "     oTQUEST. I was a woman at sixteen--my life unreal, my nature reversed; despising myself, yet not knowing where to turn for aid or guidance. My mother I could I bring her into my life? It was a question haunting me day and night, and for the very love I gave her I determined to endure my misery alone. That love had deepened and increas- ed ten-fold as I looked back to the past( How I longed to fly to her, to clasp my arms about her, clinging to her evermore t But I closed my heart, with its wild, yearning cry, and wrote her letters full of the gay life I led; drawing scenes in which I enacted a lifeless part, as if my soul throbbed through them. I said my husband was kind tome,- that I was overwhelmed with luxuries, and every desire was gratified. It was very hard to tell her we were not to return to her at mid-summer, as we had pro- mised; yet I knew I could not deceive her, or play a part before her truthful eyes; therefore I decided to go with Miss Mandevil to Staten Island. She had watched with hungry eyes the first change that came over her brother's manner to me. Since entering the house that was called my home, she had treated me with a kined of tolerance; had dictated to me as to my dress, manner, world-life, courtesies, and requirements, as if, in acting out my own nature, I should tread on some of he preju- dices, or jar against- the subtle refinements of the superior beings to whose altitude I had been lifted.            ) '   QUEST.          67 At first I listened patiently, resolving in all hu- mility to follow her suggestions; but with a daily rehearsal of the lesson, and acquaintance of the people who made up her world, I grew weary, and replied in no commendable spirit. I was constantly dragged into excitement. The house was not free for a day from visitors and guests towards whom I was expected to act as hostess, although I was as much a guest and a stranger re- garding the management of my household as on the "day I crossed its threshold. "Sarah will look to everything and manage for us while she is here," her brother had said to me; and at first it was pleasant to .be relieved from so great a responsibility. But it grew irritating to be always in her presence, to be unable to do or say a thing without her' approbation; she looked on the house, with all its appointments, as intended for her use, and it was by special favor that I 'was tolerated. The unhappiness existing between Mr. Mandevil and myself became evident at last; for a long time he treated me with attention and courtesy in his sister's presence; this gradually gave place to cold- ness and- neglect. Her questions never drew from me the truth. I would not confirms her suspicions that we were estranged, or betray my- own misery. She said: ( I looked a fright, with red, swollen eyes, and my face unearthly pale; that if I had a proper t pride, I should hide from the world any annoyance  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7529-00000034"/> 68         QUEST. I might experience, striving to avoid, not excite gos- sip; her friends, in fact, had expressed their surprise that so elegant and fastidious a man of the world as was her brother should have chosen me for a wife!" She roused in me a desire to prove to those about me 'that I was not so wholly inferior. I had been silent and reserved in society, for, with an aching heart and weary brain, I could find neither amuse- ment nor satisfaction in the life we led. Music, as I leard it at theatres, concerts, or in ball-rooms, made me inexpressibly sad. I had never once opened my piano, although it was in my own room, where I could be alone when a breathing-space was granted me. We left the city for Staten Island in July. It was a lovely spot where the house Was located. 3n one side we could look far out at the sea; on the other side a line of woods extended, shutting out all beyond. The house was built over a large ;pace. It was a story and a half high, several sleep- ing rooms being on the ground floor. It was cheerfully furnished; had a good library and billiard-room leading from the parlor. Adjoining the dining-room was a conservatory filled with rare and exquisite plants.

His sister was extremely annoyed, and reproached me with having driven him away, say- ing I should live to suffer the consequences. Al- though I reflected on her words, I could not com- prehend their meaning. I was glad in my own freedom, and knew no reason why he should not seek amusement in the way he proposed. His absence, for days together, had been frequent; I did not ask or care to know where he went; not so his sister; she was restless when he was away, -and inquisitive on his return. We had less excitement and more time to our- selves on the Island. We had pleasant people for neighbors. One family in particular Hliked--a Mrs. Wharton and her son. She was a charming woman, her mind stored with information, her thoughts original, her heart full of fresh, warm feeling, although years had taken her long past middle age in life. She had seen 'the world, had been honored and admired by the people whose hospitalities anf society she had enjoyed abroad, and in herewn home she drew around her the talent and genius of the country. Her wealth was devoted to secur- ing happiness for others. I liked her from our first meeting; her gentle, quiet manner reminded me of my mother. The son was strikingly deficient in personal comeliness. He was tall, but moved awk.  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7529-00000035"/> 70         QUEST wardly, advancing his head before his body; his eyes were greenish grey, his skin freckled, his hair coarse, straight, and black; his features were large- and irregular, but his voice was peculiarly sweet; it arrested and fascinated the ear. His conversational power was so remarkable as to make one forget his appearance. He had just returned from China, where he had passed several years and accumulated a large fortune; his only desire seemed to be to make his mother happy. It was delightful to see them to- gether; he watched and waited on her with un- wearied tenderness, and her heart beamed its love through her eyes as she followed him. It was not long before I discovered that Sarah Mandevil determined to fill the heart and engross the time of Mr. Wharton. To my mind this seemed for him so fraught with evil, and his priceless love so beyond her worth, that I determined, if possible, to thwart her plans. I told you my nature was changed, or rather that the evil which had lain dormant was now roused and eager for mischief; a feeling of malice may have -actuated my conduct; whatever the motive, my determination once taken, I steadily pursued its purpose. There were breakfasts, dinners, musical soirkes, walks, and drives proposed and carried into effect; the moving spirit, Sarah Mandevil; her object, Mr. Wharton. Yet as surely as we met I moo-   QUEST.         71 nopolized his time and attentions, playing my part openly, and with such apparent freedom from deliberate mischief that I was not suspected by those interested. I interrupted every t6te-a-tete arranged, as I knew, by one brain with skill and care, and, as opportunity offered, drew out in conversation all that was shallow and selfish in Sarah M]andevil's nature. My powers had quickened in a short time. I knew how to torment, from having been vexed and goaded myself. Mr. Wharton had repeatedly declined riding with Miss Mandevil, an accomplishment in which she excelled. Her horse was a thorough-bred; as perfect an animal as one would wish to see--a bright bay with black points. She looked well when she rode, and had a good seat; she took a gate or a wall with the same ease with which she rode over a bit of turf. It was the one accomplishment in which she-excelled, and knowing this, the day never passed, be the wea- ther what it might, that she did not ride. Having expressed a wish to learn to ride, Mr, Wharton offered to become my teacher and when I had sufficiently progressed, he aided me in procur- ing a horse which suited my need, and pleased mv fancy. P His attention and interest, the preference he evinced for my society, annoyed Miss Mandevil. The fault was mine, she said. I was a bold, bad crea-  ture, seeking to attract his regard, alluring him by 4 .   &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7529-00000036"/> 72         QUEST. looks, words, gestures, to my side, even against his will. What would her brother say . What would the world say? In my horror at the motives imputed to my con- duct, I told her I had endeavored to interpose be- tween her and Mr. Wharton; that knowing her selfish vanity, I felt a worse fate could not await him than that of becoming her husband. "Who and what was I, to judge?" she asked. "After a few months of married life, her brother was driven off to seek excitement amongst the most dissolute men of the day. If it were true that I acted from the motive I gave, I had proved myself an accomplished hypocrite; the guileless, artless child, her brother had depicted as little less than an angel in purity was an adept in deceit and treachery-a serpent in her path." After this she was more than ever disagreeable as hostess and companion. Before the world she treated me with the courtesy and attention she esteemed due to her brother's wife; when we were alone together,: she was merciless. I withdrew from her society as much as possible, avoiding also Mr. Wharton.  Fortunately the library at- tracted and consoled me; it was a safe and pleasant retreat; its silence had voices ministering to my ne- cessities. Mr. Mandevil returned as summer passed into autumn. I endeavored to meet him with affection.   QUEST.         73 He either thougilt the feeling feigned, or he found me so changed from my former self that I rno longer had a chance of pleasing him. This he hesitated not to tell me, finding me at fault in everything. It an- noyed him particularly that I had a horse to ride. He said he did not wish his wife to ride, unless he accompanied her; thought it impertinent and offi- cious in Mr. Wharton to have given me lessons; and his accompanying me in my rides-anh unheard of falniliarity. I was grieved next day to learn from the-groom that his orders were, to take the horse to town to be sold; I was fast learning to love the creature. As he stood before me, his shining coat glittering like new gold in the sun, his black mane and tail waving soft like human hair, I indulged my affection and admiration for him by throwing my arms about his neck and giving him a first and last kiss. I never saw him again. We returned to the city, Sarah going with -us at her brother's request; he said his physician recom- mended him to try the climate of Cuba during the winter, and as he preferred going alone, he wished his sister to remain with me. The Whartons had taken a house in the city but a few- blocks from us. I determined to see as much of the mother as she would permit, knowing I could make my visits to her at such hours as her son would be absent from home--thinking thus to 4  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7529-00000037"/> 74         QUEST. escape the annoyance his society seemed to bring me. We had not been long in the city when one day, as our carriage stopped at Stewart's, Sarah Mandevil uttered an exclamation of surprise, and drew me back to prevent my opening the door. I followed her gaze, and saw her brother leaving the shop with a woman of great beauty, and, for the street, rather  costly dress. They walked a few rods and disap- peared in Nacarriage awaiting them. Sarah's face was a sha'rgwhiter as I turned to ask who the person was with her brother. She replied--"She is one I hoped never to see again. Why don't such crea- tures die! She has caused me more anxiety than any other human being, for she has nearly ruined my brother. It was because of his infatuation for this woman that I consented to his marriage with you. But you have driven him back to her. I see it all now; that visit to Cuba-his frequent absences from home-are all owing to her influence. Oh, that I could crush her!"    - I asked no questions, although I did not fullycom- prehend her meaning. It was evident that I lad a rival in Mr. Mandevil's affection, and that she was a wicked and dangerous woman. I puzzled my brain as to what I ought to do or how to act, but could not decide for myself. When I met him before dinner, I asked who he was with in the morning. He re- plied I could not have seen him, as he had been   QUEST.         75 out of the city all day. I then told him the circurm- stance of our meeting him, and all that his sister had said regarding the woman who accompanied him. He came up to me as I ended, and, grasping my na- ked arm, shook me fiercely, saying, with a voice hissing through his teeth, that "he would not be watched by women; that his friends should not be insulted with hard names. The person I saw was one who loved him, and that was enough for him- more than he could say for any other. As for me, I was not fit to be a wife to any man ; that if he had been a fool in marrying me, he would take care to place as great a distance as possible between us."  That evening I lifted my sleeve and put my dis- colored, bruised arm before Sarah Mandevil's eyes, and asked if she thought I had gained by the reve- lations she mnade me in the morning. She replied her brother had a bad temper, but she was convinced with the proper sort of a- wife, he would have been a very different man. My mother's letters betrayed her impatience for the visit we had promised her. I ventured to ask Mr. Mandevil if he would go with me for a few days. "No, I might go alone; he never wished to- see the place again where he had played such a fool's part." I  wrote my mother we must still delay our going, and entreated her patience. I told her I longed to see her with. all my heart, and when we met, she  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7529-00000038"/> -t6    -    QUEST. would know I had not loved her less during all these months of our separation.  Again/the season opened with the same life of excitement. Miss AMandevil invited guests, gave dinners, evening, and dancing parties, without con- sulting me or recognizing my rights in my own house. The men who visited her seemed to me to be very flippant, selfish, and conceited; they administered to her- vanity and gave - her the gclat of being the reigning belle. This, together with the influence of her wealth and position, made her least caprice the fashion with her own sex, and for this she lived, seeming to think she had reached the climax of earthly happiness. That I had no style or manner, was. the constant:theme of her conversation with me. Mr. Wharton visited us frequently, as before, and was always included in especial invitations: to the house. He had-never changed his calm, friendly manner towards Sarah for one of a more earnest and impressive character; he was unmoved by the arti- fices- she employed' to bring him to her feet. He delighted iinmusic, and she was always ready to ex- ercisew her fingers on the, key-board for him. I won- deredif hier performance pleased, him, it was such pain for me. :Oneo ev-ening, as we were seated side by side, listening to -her at the piano, he said to me it was strange that I did not know music. I asked if -he called this music to which we listened. "Not   QUEST.         " the highest kind," he replied; " but few persons, com- paratively, knew anything beyond." "But I know and love music," I exclaimed. This led to questions. I told him the little I knew I would some day unfold to him. It was not long after this that Mrs. Wharton gave a large and brilliant party. On her cards of invita. tion were the words: "Music and dancing." Sarah practised accordingly a new and difficult theme, with variations, the sound of which drove me out of the house. To " look my best," as Mrs. Wharton had requested when planning with me the entertain- ment, I had a toilette prepared with care, to which I added a set of opal jewels, the gift of old Mr. Man- devil; they suited my dress of white silk, covered with skirts of illusion tulle and festooned by ivy, glittering with dew-drops. Even Sarah Mandevil * said I looked well, and her brother replarked that, fol once, I was dressed in tolerable taste. Mrs. Wharton received me kindly; her rooms were arranged with such a profusion of flowers, plants, and shrubs, that everywhere the guests seemed emerging from  the cool, delicious verdure. The doors were removed and their frame-work concealed by broad-leaved vines. Trellises of ivy converted the windows into alcoves, where a seat was found for the wea- ry. The rooms were not crowded with guests; there was space for displaying the most elaborate toilette; room for clumsy people to move about with-  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7529-00000039"/> 78         QUEST. out annoying their neighbors; space for talking comfortably, or making remarks without being over- heard by the very person one would not wish to hear; and there was the usual amountol of display, the same unfortunate,ugly people, the same number of pretty faces, with now and then a beautiful head, flashing out as a central point to which all eyes would turn. As I looked around me I saw no one who could rival in beauty and elegance Sarah Man- devil, yet she always reminded me of an iceberg re- flecting the sunset hues. The voices hushed, the silks and fans ceased rus- tling as a clear, sweet voice filled the room with melody. ,The song was simple, but it was sung with its true feeling and sentiment, and I drank in every note, pressing forward to see the face of the singer. It was that of a young girl I had not met before. Sarah was standing near; I asked if she knew her name. "She had heard it, but did not recall it. The girl was, of a- commlon family-quite low people; was invited about sometimes because she sang, if that was singing." Others followed at the piano; last of all, Sarah ]Mandevil, after much urging. She made no mistakes;. she had a good memory, was not ner- vous, and looked well at the piano. It was something 'to see hpr faultless hands fly over the key-board. Her performance was greatly applauded; it was the success of the evening. She took Mr. Wharton's   QUEST.         79 arm on leaving the piano, and they came to where I stood.   - "You promised to play or sing for me, and I claim that promise now," he said. "Unfortunately my sister is not a musician," replied Miss Mandevil, casting a look of contempt on me. I took la sudden and instant resolve to humble her then and there, where she had been so exalted. I turned to Mr. Wharton and said : "I will keep my promise; IT will sing and play for you J" and taking, his arm, I left her petrified with amazement. I had not drawn off my gloves before I saw her coming to me. "Surely you are not going to expose yourself and all of us to ridicule," she said, with more warmth of manner than usual. I swept my left hand over the key-board in reply. She looked her surprise. Then I thought of my home, my mother, and I played I know not what. I know my heart was in the music and thrilled to my finger-tips, and I know those usually cold people all pressed round mp till I thought I should be stifled. Then I sang from Spohr's Jessonda and an Italian catnzonet. As I left the piano I heard voices praising me, and might have felt how sweet it is to drink in adu- lation, but that I thought more of my triumph over Sarah Mandevil, who had now to confess I was her superior in an -accomplishment on which H4e prided herself; not that she loved music or comprehended  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7529-00000040"/> 80.   -QUEST. the divine harmony of sounds; she had used hel limited knowledge as a means of attracting and mo- nopolizing attention; for this reason it was torture to be excelled by another.           ' Whilst -looking at her I heard a voice beside me, associated now in my mind only with pain, say: "Have you any other accomplishments, Madam, of which I am. to learn for the first time in public!" Perceiving he was displeased, I told him that on discovering his dislike to music, I resolved never to reveal my love for it or unfold to him the little I knew; that I determined to crush his sister's pre- sumptuous self-conceit, and was satisfied with the re- sult of my efforts. He replied he would not permit me to attract at- tention; that he did not wish people to talk of me, and invite me about with the special intention of making me entertain their guests; that my assurance exceeded that of the most blasge woman of the world he had ever met. My contempt for his sister he con- sidered an insult. Dancing followed the music, and for the first time I found myself sought and conspicuous in society. The sensation was too new to be pleasant; it rather confused me then. As the weeks passed I saw but little of Mr. Man- devil; he was at his club or with his friends during 4he dayhe seldom slept under his own roof; if hie went with me into society, his manner was kind and I        s e  ,   Qt:EST.        81 courteous; he endeavored to cheat the world into believing our marriage was not a wretched lie. Towards the close of November he announced his intention of leaving for Cuba; he did indeed look wretchedly ill; his face was white and thin; blue circles had settled round his eyes; lines marked brow and mouth. His sister urged my accompanying him, and per- ceiving my reluctance to comply with her request, she told her brother he could not trust my discretion or prudence in his absence; that I had already given occasion for scandal, and that the comments of the world on my conduct in society, which betrayed an evident dislike and indifference to him, were -very severe. "He did not care for the world's comments,' he said; " he would not have me, with him; I might do as I pleased in his absence; iere was money enough at his banker's; he had but on wish-I must remain in New York." After his departure I accompanied his sister to every place where her whim or mood led, and soon found pleasure in restlessness and excitement, My success in society dated from the night of Mrs. Wharton's ball. Her friendship and affection for me induced others to look on me with consideration. My music was appreciated, although I used it more as a means of triumph over Sarah Mandei than to give pleasure to others or to excite attenti I was 4*   &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7529-00000041"/> 82         QUEST. disgusted and angry with myself every time I degrad- ed it, with its hallowed associations, as a means of revenge and malice; but my mind had lost its keen sense of right, and I allowed myself to be whirled onward, nor asked whither. I was gay, reckless, heedless; a desire to please gradually changed into a thirst for admiration and ambition to exceed and excel those about me. My perceptions quickened, my power of penetration illcreased, so that I adapted myself to the life we led with ease and success. Miss Mandevil called me her chaperone, but, in reality, she was my pro- tection, as I stood before the world a'wife without a husband. Mr. Wharton continued to seek my society, nor did I make an effort to discourage him. His civili- ties were such that ILcould not refuse them without a pretext; he never intruded on me officiously; he often stood between me and the impertinence of the men I met in the world. He was the only man amo' t hundreds I met who gave me new thoughts, balked to me as if I were a rational being; yet the pleasure I had in his company was changed to bitterness by Sarah Mande- vil's jealousy. My every word and look was criti- cized and misinterpreted; it was a grave fault, al- most a crime in her eyes-tthe civilities I permitted or the con :se I held with him. Yet Enjoyed tormenting her. I had delight in   humbling her; far greater was my pleasure in the angry flash of her eye and the scathing words that welled up from her wounded heart, than in the uu^ meaning flatteries poured into my ears by-thee smooth-tongued hypocrites surrounding me. I returned home one night from a ball where I had been very gay and received more than usual attention; yet I was ill, body and mind ; I had forced my spirits during the evening, and on entering the house I sank down exhausted, exclaiming how wretchedly I felt. Sarah said, harshy, it did not surprise her; persons in my situation ought to have more care, and not permit themselves every kind of indulgence and excitement. '"My situation!"I asked; ."what should that be to require my care?" She replied' "I knew very well her meaning. That if I was indifferent to my own health, I had a duty towards my child."        l- My child! O God! was it that? And this was the secret of my sufferings,: my misery, the days and nights of pain - A child! I turned and fled to my own room, locking the door betwixt my agony and the world; tore off my jewels to trample them under foot; cursed myself, life, and the being I must call child.

I prayed heaven to curse it, destroy it, or take my life. When morning came I poured cWt the bitterness of my soul to Sarah, not restrainin myself inl speak- ing of her brother's neglect and cruelty. I said I would die before I brought to life a child who would be ashamed to own him as a father. I left her, stupefied at my passionate outhurst, to go home to my mother. II could not stay away longer. I must seek her, my only friend. I waited not for leave-takings or much prepara- tion. A strange, eager joy mingled with my grief and anguish, as I thought that night I should sleep under her roof in my bed beside her own. How free I felt as I hurried on with the speed of the steaming engine-on, on, till the city lights gleamed as a belt of fire before me, and I knew to a minute how soon I should be in her arms. Oh, my mother, how like an, angel did your face beam on me, as I crossed the threshold and stood before you! Love was in every feature; love all mine welcomed me. How I hungered and thirsted for it once more I We were clinging to each other at last in a warm, fervent embrace. I nestled down to her fast-beating heart, and prayed in my happiness that I might die there and then. When she had re- covered from the surprise and joy of my coming, she looked round for Mr. Mandevil. I told her I could not wait for him; he being still absent, I came alone.   QUEST.         85 I would not speak of him that night; I made my mother tell me of herself; every event of her daily life had a deeper interest for me than any other thing 1 had known in these long months of absence. Nor would I retire to rest till she sang to me, I weeping as her voice floated through the room-the old, un- forgotten days coming back with her song, the old memories stirring the very depths of my soul. My father's face looked out from the canvas with the soft, dark eyes answering mine as in other days. My bridal wreath, withered and brown, hung where I had left it; even as the soul had left the flowers, so my own true life had perished within me. That night I slept in my little bed beside my mother as in the days of my childhood. Sweet dreams enfolded me once more, calming my spirit, refreshing me, body and mind. It -was a task that wrung my heart to undeceive my mother regarding my life since leaving her. Her arms were clasped about me; my head was pillowed on her breast as I unfolded all my sorrows; her sweet voice murmured words of love and pity; her tears, her tightening fold, as if to shield and shelter me, made me forget, for the moment, my misery in the exquisite 'joy of being loved. I told her all, even to that last which had overwhelmed me; then I fell at her feet and hid my face that she might not hear the wild burst of grief that gushed through my lips.

She reasoned not with my passionate words, but waited till the storm had -passed. As I grew calm, her anguish at my suffer- ing became apparent through the outward compo- sure, and many times she exclaimed: "My child, my heart's treasure, that I should have sent you forth with one so worthless!" We struggled through the first few days and then took thought for the future. I would stay with her till I knew of his return from Cuba; then I felt I must leave her.  The being there in her presence, listening to her soft foot-falls, meeting her loving eyes, thrilling to her kisses and enfolding arms, -was happi- ness. It seemed so like a dream of heaven, that little peaceful home, after the restless life I had led, that I clung to it with eager joy, filling my heart every hour with its rest and calm. Again the long evenings were given up to music; and my soul, mnore fitted by suffering to comprehend its many voices, received it ae divine consolation, drinking in ne- penthe for the past, with strergth for a dreaded future, by its mysterious,'controlling influence. Four weeks passed--four happy weeks, despite the cloud overhanging us; then a letter from Sarah Mandevil, announcing the return in two days of her brother, forced me to part from my mother. She promised to be with me in my hour of peril and need. I left her with an aching heart.   I was there to receive Mr. Mandevil; we met, as we had parted, with the utmost indifference. If he went away for the benefit of his health, he had accomplished all he sought; he looked well, better than I had ever seen him look-the ghastly paleness had left his face, and a faint color was in his cheeks and lips. I dreaded to tell him of my visit to my mother, and was saved that annoyance by his sister's informing him of my absence and the scene which took place between us on the day I departed. I had not intended to express to him my feelings; I hoped to keep my lips closed in his presence, that there paight be peace between us. But after listening to his sister, he said words- to: me I cannot write for their brutality, and tormented i me till I forgot every good resolution, and my lips poured forth words of .bitterness and wrath. I told him, in my passion, of the disgust, hatred, and loath- ing I had for him and the child that had his blood in its veins. I called God to witness that I prayed it might not live to know me for its mother; that living, my breast should not nourish it, my arms never cradle it. I was judged to be but little better than a demon at this, but I was unmoved by abuse; I had become familiar with unkindness. We lived our lives apart as before, meeting in soci.  ety,' and, when compelled by circumstances, at home,    \     ' .   &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7529-00000044"/> 88        y QUEST. Mrs. Wharton received me back to her heart with real affection. She rejoiced that I had been with my mother, although she had missed me, she said. Her son was also glad I had returned. "It had been stupid at all the places he visited, because I was not there," he told me. That some one welcomed me; that I had been missed was an agreeable thought; I passed a part of every day with Mrs. Wharton; it was my only pleasure. Sarah Mandevil's jealousy soon became a passion. It mattered not to her that half a dozen men were really in love with her; that in one season she re- fused. more offers of marriage than most women hear of in a lifetime. She had made up her mind at last to be married, and her choice was Mr. Wharton. I had acknowledged I once endeavored to prevent this, and she felt confident I now used my influence with his mother against her; else, why had she not succeeded in her efforts to please and impress him with her charms 2 This she said to her brother, who was not inclined to be gentle in his opinion as to the part I had played in- trying to oppose Sarah; he joined with her in accusing me of seeking to attract Mr. Wharton, and said'my constant visits to his mother were indelicate and improper, their intention being evidently the enjoyment of his society. I said: "I would not give  up  the only friend I had, for their unjust suspicions; if they -    *o -J /   QUEST.         89 thought I visited her for the sake of seeing her son, they might learn for themselves the truth; I would not trouble myself to undeceive them." Nor did I renounce my visits to Mrs. Wharton; bult I was watched and every act nmisinterpreted. Strong in my own innocence, I walked bravely into danger; pure in my own heart, I knew not the blackness of evil that could cast its filth and slime over the unspotted garments of another. I was one day at a music shop where I met Mr. Wharton, and being on my way to his mother's, I offered him a seat in'my carriage, as he was going he said, to get her letters for the post. Returning home at dinner, I was accused of meeting and driv - ing with him. It was in vain I repeated the cir- cumstances; they were against me, and the meet- ing was decided to have been previously-planned and arranged.     / It really embarrassed The, when I met him, to know how to conduct myself; as I found every look and gesture commented o/. I could have avoided him, but would not humble myself to satisfy the ca- price of Sarah Mandevil, and thus involved myself in inextricable difficulties. March was nearly ended; the season of gaiety over. I regretted this, as it gave me excitement and kept me from thinking of the day I so dreaded. Every pang, every life-throb indicating that day, made my heart sick--madelime more cruel and bitter. I did not prepare for its  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7529-00000045"/> 90         QUEST. event, which Sarah Mandevil perceiving, she be came very busy in cutting and sewing garments she said were necessary. They were never completed, her intention in the work being that of malice. I had promised Mr. Wharton to select with him a cadeau for his mother's birthday, and received from hmn a note one morning, asking if I could meet him at the jeweller's for this purpose. Sarah was in my room when the note was brought. I dismissed the servant, saying I would send a reply. I opened my desk, and had partially, written an answer, when visi- tors were announced in the drawing-room. I went to receive them, and, returning, looked for the note yhich I knew I had left inside the desk. It was gone. 1searched for it thoroughly, then sent to ask Miss Mandevil if she had seen it. She said she had not. I thought it a singular incident, but wrote another re- plv to Mr. Wharton. That evening we had a card party of gentlemen- a whist club to which Mr. Mandevil belonged. I therefore expected to see him, although he had not been home for two days. le did not come, much to my annoyance, as I was obliged to entertain his guests. The next day, I was preparing to leave for the appointment with Mr. Wharton, when Mr. Man- devil entered the room. I saw he was angry and disturbed; his eyes flashed as he held a folded paper before me.  "What does this mean, Madam?" he said.   QUEST.         91 I read: "My friend-I cannot leave to-day as you lesire, for my sister's watchful eyes are following me, and if I order the carriage she will find some shopping excuse to accompany me, and would be de trop, n'est ce pas . I shall be glad to meet you to-morrow, at one o'clock, and am only too happy with ----" "My unfinished note; where did you find it t"I exclaimed. "What does it mean?" he asked, raising his voice, and snatching it from my hiand. I explained its import. He answered: "Deceit- ful little serpent, you know well it has a very differ- ent meaning, yet you dare try to impose on me with that mock virtuous face. Tell me the truth. Where* were you to meet this man i" "I have told the truth. If you do not believe me, go to Mr. Wharton. You are a contemptible coward to insult me with your vile imputations--" He interrupted: "Yes, I will go to him; never fear but I will find him-the scoundrel. A coward am I, to insult you I that's what you deserve." I felt a heavy blow on my shoulder, then I was hurled across the room. I fell, my head struck, and I knew no more. It must have been a long time that I remained un- conscious. I came to myself, suffering terrible pain. With difficulty I rang the bell; my maid answered it, and helped me to the lounge. I bade her go immediately for Mrs. Wharton, and beg her not-to  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7529-00000046"/> 92         QUEST.  delay, as I was very ill and needed assistance. *The girl departed and returned speedily with Mrs. Wharton. I told her of the circumstance of the note; of Mr. Mandevi's suspicions and his cruelty. I did not spare him; I was too angry, and suffering too keenly from hit ill-treatment. I could buts explain the cause of these suspicions, in Sarah Mandevil's jea- lousy and intentions regarding Mr'. Wharton. I en- treated Mrs. Wharton to go to her son, telling him all that had occurred, and also to see Miss Mandevil and prove to her how she had misinterpreted my conduct and motives. Mrs. Wharton promised to do all I wished. She was greatly shocked and pained at my revelations, and :insisted on my being calm and quiet. She feared I was injured, and sent her carriage for the physician before leaving me. When the physician came, he questioned me as to the fall. I ascribed it to accident. He ordered a nurse, and said I had better send at once for my Bpother. It needed a month to complete my seventeenth year, yet the hour was there, with its intolerable anguish. Through all its fearful struggles I prayed for death. I saw my mother's face bending over me, but, for the first time in life, thought only of myself. "A girl! a dear little girl; how I shall love it!" I heard-her: say. f   -   QUEST.         93 "How I hate it," I thought, my agoiny yet before me. They left me to sleep. When I awoke, it was almost dark. I saw my mother rocking to and fr by the fireside. I knew what she held in her arms. The first jealous pang shot through my heart as I thought I must share her love with another, and that being the child of my aversion. As these feelings agitated me, I heard a weak wailing cry. At first it disturbed me; as it con- tinued, an unutterable yearning to still and soothe that cry possessed me. A voice answered it from my heart, a thrill passed from everv pulse towards it; the depths of my- soul were stirred with a new and strange emotion; involuntarily :I called my mo- ther. I opened my arms; she laid my child orbmy heart. From that moment I loved it, nourished it, watched over it, in the exquisite joy of its presence forgetting every sorrow. A few days after its birth Mr. Mandevil came to me. His visit was not made to express sympathy for m-T sufferings, joy in my safety, or to notice the little one on my arm. He came to upbraid me for having exposed him to Mrs. Wharton; said he was not to be- deceived regarding me by any story she might tell him. He knew what my interviews with Mr. Wharton meant. That Mrs. Wharton's rudeness had so outraged his sister, she had left the house, declaring she -would not live under the same roof with me, being con-  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7529-00000047"/> "     .   QUEST. vinced I had made misstatements regarding her, and thus caused Mrs. Wharton's ill-natured observations. He said he would never forgive me for prejudicing people against his sister, or for having made him ridiculous in the eyes of the world ; that a day would soon come when I should know what an enemy I had raised up to crush me. Weak and shattered as I was, his words filled me with terror. I had not strength enough to bear the excitementof his visit.' I was ill for several days, and entreated my mother not to leave me again alone with him. I did not recover health or strength quickly. I passed two months in my room, longing to breathe agan the pure summer air, under the open sky far away from the city. Yet I was happy. I did not mind my weaknessy as I watched the little life which grew and thrived beside me. Sleep- ing or waking I could not rest if my child were not near. My eyes feasted on her continually. I mar- velled at her increasing intelligence; was proud of her beauty. Herlittle head was covered with rings of golden hair; her large, brown eyes looked into mine- with an- earnestness that often- troubled me. The sweet mouth learned at last to return my smile; and the clasps' of that tiny hand bound me to life with a power no other touch had awakened. I loved -my mother- more,teiderly now that I comprehended a mother's heart, and-her love for   QUEST.         95 my child made for me a new happiness. Though I wished to return home with her, I had not ventured to express the desire, lest Mr. Mandevil should oppose it. The physician .said to him my recovery depended on my being removed to some quiet country town, where, free from excitement, I might live muc pin the open air. At this he proposed fily return home with my mother, and came in a few days -to hasten my departure, saying every day I remained in the city was a loss of strength to me. In order to arrange the little home with comfort for the addition of nurse and baby, my mother left a few days before we were to go; full of joy and gratitude, I bade her farewell. The long summer- months beckoned from out the future invitingly to their calm, delicious - days, which should enfold me in a happiness pure and :deep. Myy baby I My treasure t I might have her at last where I could watch her fearlessly, drink in all her beauty, satisfy my soul with her dawning consciousness, and purify my heart by steadfastly gazing on her innocence! Two days passed. I awoke on the third, the morn- ing of our departure, to find myself alone; I waited, then rung my bell, and requested the maid to send nurse and baby to me. "They are gone, ma'am." "Gone where V"I ex- claimed. "By the early train an hour ago," was the answer. .I could not comprehend the- girl, nor could I credit my senses, as my eyes searched vainly *  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7529-00000048"/> 96         .QUEST. 1 for my child, and 'my ears heard no sound but the echo of her words filling me with terror. , "Mr..

"I am here, Madame," and he entered the room; not waiting to be questioned, he told me calmly he would not travel with a baby, and had therefore sent the nurse with the .child by the early train. He requested me to be ready to accompany him by noon. I thought it a -cruel act on his part, but consoled, myself thinking that the separation was but for a few lihours, and made preparations for my departure as bravely as I could. The journey was long, very long; every delay irritated and-vexed-me; we seemed, only to creep forward, althoughl rushing on with the speed of an express. :But it was over at last, and before sunset I was under the rose-covered porch of my own homes. I rushed into my mother's presence, and, after our greeting, I asked eagerly for the child. She looked at the door as if awaiting some one; I said: "Do not mind him; bring me my darling, I can wait no longer!"  She left the room, but quickly returned and asked if the nurse came with me or was coming soon. "Coming, mother I domingl Surely she is here They came 'by the early train this morning to you."

I kaewsmy- mother was there, yet heard her voice afar, as in a dream; her arms enfolded me, I felt them not; her tears rained over my face and hands, butin my eyes burned the words of that letter, scorch- ing up moisture and searing my brain. I battled through the illness that followed, never losing consciousness or having a respite from the agony eating into my life. Still I determined to live. I must live, I had an object in life-to seek and find my cild. This hope, faint, uncertain, weak as it was, be' came a reality to my mind from the will to realize it; iout of it grew strength to baffle weakness, disease, and death. Before I could leave my room I persuaded my mother to go to Newe York, that she might make in quiries regarding Robert MAandevil, and obtain, if possible, some clue to where he had gone. It was a: week before she returned. Her mission had failed. She had an interview with Sarah Man- devil, who was very anxious to discover her brother's place of abode, and was glad to use both- her influ- ence and wealth for the purpose. My mother went to Mr. Bury, the legal adviser employed by the Man- devils; he could give no information that would as- sist her search; he had already made every possible   QUEST.         99 inquiry, at the instigation of Miss Mafndevil, but was as much at a loss to discover whe, h brother had gone as when he began his task. He thought in a few days he might give some: new gifts for which he waited; but the days having passed, no-i thing new could be told. She next went to Mrs. Wharton, who received her affectionately, and would have accompanied her ona her departure for home, if they had not feared the effect of excitement for me. It was there my mother learnt that Sarah Mandevil had circulated the most vile and false statements regarding me; said- her brother had discovered a correspondence which so compromised me he had -determined/to separate from me, giving the education of the Wild I hated, because it was his, into the care of one more compe- tent for such duty than the mother. Mrs. Wharton used her influence to contradict these reports, stating the truth, which was pot altogether to Miss Mande- vil's advantage. But the world liked the lie, and called it truth. My burden pressed -even more hea- vily after my mother's return. I did not despair. I waited'patiently, striving to recover strength: for the 'work before me; for I thought in my heart, as surely as my mother had failed, I should suceed. Fortunately, at this time, Mr. Mandevil, of New Orleans, came to us, in answer to a letter from my mother, entreating him to seek his nephew. -The. kind old man had already been to Havana, and yet  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7529-00000050"/> hisr qiest::th;ere wtas tiseles; he could discover no trace of nephew    leaving us: forNebw York, -he: bde mei rely Jo his 'bei f:atul in thet;;search he:indertook. .He: knew' all- the..,haunts -iad associates ofhis nehDiw; knew much of his life, and had it iLihis powgr to Itramcehii, if hisT departufe ihad been confided to ani 6- ofh friends: or companin.. . .

This time the face of a bQy came in dreamy indis- tinctness on the canvas; as it progressed towards completion my thoughts -were more and more en- grossed by it. Dr. Tnman's coming was now a mat- ter of interest and importance to me; my mind was occupied and diverted from the one thought which had fixed it. When the second picture was finished, Dr. Tnman brought a book of studies in heads and asked me if I -would try to make correct drawings from the different features. The task seemed impossible, but with his aid and instruction I got over the difficulties. I received a daily lesson, and when I could draw a head correctly without a model, I was permitted to - take a canvas and make- my first attempt at color. It was slow work; months passed before I could ac- complish anything; yet I persevered. The occupa- tion engrossed my time and fixed my attention. As spring advanced I renewed my walks into the coun- try, and made sketches of a simple character. I had always loved nature, but never before appreciated her woniderful beauty; her marvellous perfection was an unfailing source of study and delight. I met in my walks often a little deformed girl with a face of exquisite loveliness. She was very small, and I won- dered at seeing her so much alone. One day finding her by the lake side gathering violets, I spoke to her, and soon she told- me all- her history. , She lived quite near to- us, had four brothers older than her- self, was the only daughter and nearly thirteen     QUEST.         103 She said she liked wandering off alone. She knew all the birds, how they lived, where they hid their nests; all the flowers, the trees, the shrubs, and could tell every pebble in her path. She said out of doors she had all her pets, and was not happy if she stayed from them long. Her parents were wealthy, as I knew. If they had not been able to give health and strength to this unfortunate child, they had filled her mind with beauty, and made her contented and happy. Every thought she expressed was cheerful and kindly; it seemed as if she forgot herself and the blight on her life in her enjoyment of nature. My sketch-book amused her, and I worked much better for her companionship. We met every day, and were soon such friends that we agreed, on sepa- rating, upon the hour when we would come together again. I ventured to ask if she would let me make a sketch of her head in oils; she consented with de- light, if her mother would permit. A more beautiful face than Blanche's could not be found. I studied it faithfully and worked hard to portray it. - he study I made so pleased -her, she wished to take it-to her mother, and when I had Dr. Tnmnan's approval as to its correctness, I told Blanche the picture was hers if she would sit for me again.  She came next day accompanied by her mother, who expressed her thanks for the sketch so warmly I was quite embarrassed, knowing its merits fell far short of what I might accomplish.  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7529-00000052"/> 104 ,       QUEST, 'I Ilmade mrany studies from :Blainche's face, and gradually got the texture of the flesh, with its pure, transparent color.

The day I received the letter I was on my way to New York, my heart surging with hope and fear, my brain striving to picture the baby-face deve- loped to the child of two years. She needed a mo- ther's care; she was delicate, he w . How I prayed to be permitted to fold her once more to my heart, and cherish her with a watchful, tender love I I arrived late, but was driven to Miss Mandevil's house. I did not wait to be announced, but entered the. drawing-room, where she sat alone. "I seek your brother; where is he ?" I asked, not heeding her surprise and hauteur. "My brother sailed for India two days since, Ma- dame; the day on which I mailed his letter to you." " And my child ?"-I gasped. "I know nothing about the child.  I asked no questions regarding her, as my brother told me he had placed her out of your reach." A death-like feeling passed over me. I shivered; my teeth chattered so, I could not speak. "If I knew where to find the child I would not seek her, or betray by my movements her place of abode. It is enough for me that you have ruined my brother, and driven him from his home and his country, to be a wanderer over the face of the earth. You shall never have his child in your power while I have life or influence." I turned and left this woman, that her cold, cruel eyes might not feast on my anguish. I went to Mrs   Wharton, who consoled and gave me fresh courage. She accompanied me to Mr. Bury, the lawyer my mother had visited. He told me Robert Mandevil had returned to New York only a week. previous to his having sailed for India. On the day of his return he was with Mr. B., and stated he had placed his daughter in a pleasant home, where he knew her to be safe from the power or influence of those who would seek to discover her. That in case of, his death, she would be provided for, as he had left half his property in trust for her. Mr, Bury seemed annoyed and eha- grined that in this matter Robert Mandevil had acted independently, confiding but partially in his ability and discretion.  He said he knew he had sailed without the child; he had satisfied himself of this, and gave me a copy of the passenger list, which he had procured from the ship-owners of the Loreley, the vessel in which Mr. Mandevil had departed. I remained two weeks in New York, striving to obtain some clue to this home where my child was hidden from me; but my efforts were futile, my strength and courage broke down, and I returned home utterly dejected. I worked as before, but only for bread. I suc- ceeded in satisfying those who employed my time, yet I knew my work was ill done. If I had a leisure hour, I employed it in bringing out on my canvas a child-face, with soft brown eyes and golden hair.

The privacy of our home was disturbed by many visitors coming to seek me. My studio and work room was the little parlor, the only room I could use for light. As I painted children exclu- sively, I found it impossible to keep them from being restless in so small a space, and my sittings were frequently interrupted, so that time was lost and wasted.

TwIRrn was a stir at the Albion, when Mr. Stanley's order was received, that his apartment Whould be made ready immediately for his reception. / The per- son most interested in the matter was Ermine, a negro-servant, who filled the position of maitre d'M- tel, valet, butler, and cook, to his master, Mr. Stanley. Ermine was proud of his African descent. "No white- blood in dis nigger,"'ras the favorite phrase with which he concluded all energetic expression of thought. Possibly, his parents having had a kind of rank in their far-off land previous to being en- trapped into slavery, or his early experience- of life, may have made Ermine stubborn in the prejudice he held regarding the white race. "No 'jections in livin' mongst white folk if dey's 'spectable, Mas'r Stanley," he would say; " but I'se 'mazin glad der an't none o' thar blood in dis nigger. White folk an't no count in my country over dem seas, Mas'r." Ermine was slow.

Ermine was proud of his kitchen ; he thought it rather an insult if his master's guests did not express a curiosity to inspect its mysteries. The floor was white and spotless; chairs and tables of hard wood that had never. seen paint or varnish, -wer whiter than the floor. The copper casseroles looked like red gold; the tin cups and pans glittered like silver. Ermine was slow butsure, where clean- liness was to be observed. In Ermine's window was a long, wide box, which, summer and winter, was filled with the freshest, greenest, crispest salad; he called it his garden; the secret of its unfailing supply and freshness he would not reveal. "It's inspiration as I gits to do it, Mas'r Stanley," was as near the solution of the mystery as one ever came. - - Slow as he -was, Ermine, with Sarah's help, ma- naged to have the apartment in order at the appoint- ed time.        * "Pleasant to be home again "So Ralph Stanley   9          QUEST.         119 thought, seated at his breakfast table on the morning of his return from the seaside.

As Mr. Teesdale left the room Ermine entered, bearing a tray heaped with letters, notes, pamphlets, and documents of every size and color. His master examined its contents eagerly, with nervous hand and searching eye. Again and again did he turn over every letter; the one he sought was not there. , Four days had passed since Adelaide's departure from the seaside, during which time he had not   QUEST.         123 heard from her. Restless, agitated, weary, fatiguing days were these, bringing their appointed hours only to remind him of others replete with happiness which were past. A desire to be alone, to be where no eye might look into his, no voice jar on his ear, no conscious- ness of human presence disturb his reverie, was the feeling with which he struggled. He had remained at the seaside for the sake of appearances after Adelaide's departure, knowing he could not withdraw immediately from the society of the place without comment; he therefore min- gled in the crowd, went through the usual chit- chat with the men and women; had his game at bil- liards, rode,- drove, idled or gossiped as incident re- quired. There was nothing in the outward man of the world to denote the strife 'twixt body and soul, the feverish impatience, the strained, nervous force, the one absorbing passion concentrated in the name, that ever burst from heart to lips, yet remained there unuttered.             A prey to emotions acute and distracting, he could no longer remain in a place where everything was so associated with the woman he loved that each hour he felt her absence more keenly; he therefore returned to the city, hoping for a letter to dispel the gloom and doubts which were gathering around him.            , "No letter!

Can she know that life without her is impossible- existence- an'- falless, dreary blank? What call this mystery be. which takes . her from me;? What means this strange silence that contracts. my :heart and paralyzes my courage "' l Such thoughts passed, through his mind as, with a heavy sigh, he pushed. the letters from him; a note fell to. the floor; he took it up, looked at the writing, opened it, and read : "MY DEAR RALPH :- Ooe to me directly.

"It needed only this, Oh, Adelaide, AdelaideI One month since, and this poor boy's life was the most precious to me on earth; now, if to save him I mtust leave you-God help me, it is too much I I dare notoeven think of it." An hour after, Ralph Stanley stood-at the entrance of hisb aunt'shouse. -It/was in a pleasant street slop- ing! dotwn S;a  hill-side to the river; before it lay a large, handsome park, with fine old elms arching the :walks,;andt soft velvet turf extending far as the eye could reach. Children were playing in the park and in the street; some of them, friends of Ralph, came bounding towards him with the frank, joyous greet-. ing of childhood:; his heart was too heavy to respond s    QUEST         125 to their pleasantprattle'; he quickly withdrew from them,e closing the door on the group of sunny faces gathered at the. steps. He found; his. aunt in her morning room extended on a sofa, to which, she was condemned by the accident which. had blasted her once happy. life. Her face was beautiful, yet it was but the shadow of a loveliness and symmetry that had once attracted all eyes, and made her the idol of a husband whose love was fully appreciated. The blow that prostrated her, took him for ever from her sight; it was better thus, she thought, than that he should linger in pain and helplessness, doom- ed as she was to renounce life's enjoyments, and en- dure uncomplainingly the lot assigned to her. The ardent love of her: son had consoled her in the first weary years of this irksome, restrained existence; for his sake she had roused all her energies, and- in terested herself in the busy world in which she was never more to mingle; it was for him that she ga- tiered round her a pleasant circle of friends who made her solitude: less fatiguing, and resolutely did she keep up her courage, fighting back pain, ennui, and despondency.      - When Ralph enteri the room, a smile of satisfac- tion passed over her fake. "Iknew you would come, Ralph," she said ; " go speak to Harry; he is seated yonder by the window. He takes no notice of any one now, yet I hope he may recognize you."  "My dear aunt, is he indeed so ill!" said Ralph, "'*  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7529-00000063"/> ,u,        QUEST.-     / turning to the young man: "why Harry, my boy, what do you find so amusing out of the window that you cannot give a fellow your hand when he comes to see you?"

"Ralph," he said, "good Ralph," then relapsed into silence. The mother watched the meeting anxiously; as her son spoke she threw her head back on the cush- ion, with "4 Thank God! " on her lips. Ralph seated himself beside his cousin and talked as if he had an attentive listener; the only reply the youa     n gave, was now and then, " good Ralph." can I do for him, my dear aunt ?" said Ralph, returning to the sofa. " He must leave me--he must go abroad ; there is' no person in the world to whom I can intrust him but yourself. Will you go with him, dear Ralph ~" A choking sensation in the throat, an agony gulp- ed down, and he answered: ",, I will go with him; must it be soon  " "There must be no delay.   God knows I would prolong this parting if possible; it seemns so cruel that we should part now. Oh, Ralph, I dare not murmur lest a more terrible blow fall on me; yet it is hard to be helpless, so utterly helpless, now."    X         QUEST.         127 The thin, white hands were wrung despairingly, and the face deluged with teais. Ralph forgot his own great grief as he looked at his aunt; her long suffering resignation, her lonely, desolate life, all appealed to him; 'his resolution was taken; he also would be brave and endure; he would look his destiny in the face, and prepare to meet it calmly. "My dear aunt, my second mother, do not let the thought of this separation trouble you. I will watch over Harry day and night; will devote my time, my energies, my life, to the task of restoring him to health, and, God willing, he shall return to you wholly sound in body and mind. If you know the cause of his suffering do not keep it from me. I will guard his secret; but to know where to apply the remedy I must not be kept in ignorance of the na- ture of the disease." "You are right, Ralph. I promised Harry to keep his secret in my own heart for ever, yet, if to save his life I must break my word, I cannot hesitate; may he forgive me! "It was during the summer we passed at Newport, shortly before your return from Europe,-that a young girl of great beauty was presented to us; her name was Fanny Auter. She was visiting a friend who had the adjoining cottage.

She sang delightfully, ,and was always ready to give her time to others. She soon becamne very necessary to my happiness; every morning she would visit me to read some new-book or sing to me, and seemed really to enjoy being with me. Harry, as you know, was devoted to me; he had given up society, amusement, and occupation, everything in fact which could take him away from my side. He was enchanted with this young girl' who seemed so fond of me, and whose attentions were. offered with a delicate persistence, impossible to withstand. I sawi his admiration for her change gradually to love, and rejoiced in the prospect of his happiness. I felt that my life would possess a new charm if I could only see him united to one worthy his uncor. ruupt, noble nature. I did not care for the position of this girl; I minded not her poverty. She seemed artless and true-hearted, her manner was simple and refined, she had tastes which accorded with Henry's disposition, and promised for both mutual happiness. "The day dawned when his heart would speak; then he: came to me and told me of his love, yet, fearing to disturb my happiness, he said I must de. cide if; he should reveal it to her. tHe was willing, to resign and forget her rather than give me pain.

This- he would have- done at first before betraying his lBve, but he was, led away by his impetuous feelings; he had'also the excuse, that Mr. and .Mrs. Auter were travelling in the mountains, some days' distance from Newport, and a letter, could not reach them with any certain- ty.

No effort of mine wouldfce him to leave me for the entertainments whe!e he  might see and be near her. "Weeks went by. One morning the postman came to, our cottage with a letter for Miss Anter. He had not found her at home, and had brought it, with others, to us. Harry gave her the letter, saying jestingly as he did so, that the address looked like a man's writing. As she opened it a deep crimson flushed her face, which faded gradually, as she read, to an ashy white. I was watching her, not intentionally, but because I liked to look at her beautiful face; her emotion frightened me, and I called Harry's attention to her. She did not hear me, nor did she observe him, till he placed his hand on her arm and asked if she had ill news; she started, crushed the letter, and fled out of the room, without observing a note which had fallen from the envelope to the floor. Harry took it up, walked up and down the room, turning over the'note and looking at it as he walked; then he came to me, and I saw his face was pale, that great  drops stood on his brow as he put the note in my hand; it was addressed in her writing to another man. I knew in an    instant that Harry had the agony of doubt and jealousy in his heart. I felt sure he was wrong, or I would never have forced him to read that note. He read it, Ralph, to fall senseless at my feet.  It was a wild, passionate   QUEST.        1S1 declaration of love for another, asking forgiveness for renouncing him to marry a man whose wealth and name would save her family from poverty; it was a confession of her weakness in being unable to resist the dazzling position offered her, and a solemn oath that the man she was about to marry had only her esteem, not her heart. She entreated to be released from an engagement she had formed under the influence of a feeling which, however indulged, could not be acknowledged. She was engaged to this man when she promised to become my Harry's wife. "You know the rest; you know that Harry plunged recklessly into excitement and dissipation, till, body and mind alike shattered, he became as you now find him." "Poor Harry!

"Wait awhile and he will be here; we can then decide as to the preparations for your departure." The words fell heavily on his heart, but, determined  to give no sign of his own trouble, he diverted lis aunt's mind from the sad thoughts oppresing her, and had the satisfaction of seeing her face resume its resigned, tranquil expression.  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7529-00000066"/> 132-        QUEST. The physician did not fail to arrive at his usual hour; he explained to Ralph the peculiar state of his patient, and the reasons why he deemed a change of scene and climate advisable. He wished them to leave as soon as possible; there seemed no necessity of a longer delay than a fortnight, when a steamer would sail from the city direct for Liverpool. Ralph Stanley left his aunt's house with a feeling of bitterness at heart. The uncertainty regarding Adelaide, his eagerness to see her, the dread of- separation, the fear of losing her, the sacrifice he must make of his hopes for his cousin-all rushed through his mind, harassing and torturing him till the mental suffering became unendurable. The pro- mise he had made Adelaide not to seek her till he had received her letter, now seemed absurd; he determined to wait no longer, but to see her that very day and tell her: the circumstances which would compel him to leave her. But, where should he seek her-at her studio? A feeling of delicacy restrained him, yet his heart: bounfded as lhe remembered she was there, near to him; a moment, and he might see her, be with her, look into' her earnest eyes, listen to her low, sweet voice. With the thought, his feet turned towards the studio building; ere he was aware he'stood before it; a huge, ugly pile of brick and stone it looked, yet he saw not its deformity. 'Ade- laide was thlere!

A familiar voice startled him:; an acquaintance recognized and stayed to speak with him, and finally they walked away together. Driving towards Tanglewood, which was a part of Brookdale, in the afternoon with. his friend, Ralph deliberated if it were possible to find an excuse for a visit to Adelaide in her own home; yet remember- ing the earnestness with which she requested him not to seek her, and unwilling to appear before her unbidden, he determined to wait till the next day, when he would send Ermine with a note telling her of his departure, and request permission to visit her in the evening. He was not in a mood to enjoy his friend's society, yet he managed to go 'over the place they were to visit, and show an interest in the various improvements- going on. As they entered the city towards evening, Mr. Teesdale said: "Now Stanley, you will come and dine with me at the club a " "I ordered dinner before I left home; you will not let me eat it alone.

" Go and ask her to come to me bere." Ermine returned with a respectable looking old- woman, who waited till he was dismissed before open- ing her resolutely closed lips; then turning to Mr. Stanley, she gave him a sealed packet. "My mistress told me to give this into-your own hand, sir, and if you were not here, I was to wait for you, or find you before returning to her." Ralph looked at the address; it was his own name in the clear, graceful writing of her he loved. It was the-long-looked-for letter.  Strong man as he was, he felt the blood rush to his head with a vio- lence that made the room whirl round, and a mist gather before his eyes. It was a moment before he could speak. "And is she well-your mistress?" he asked, wishing in his joy to embrace the old woman. "She is quite well, sir, and sends you many good wishes. Is there any message in return, sir?" "Yes; wait one moment, my good woman." Ralph took his pen and wrote: is Your precious letter, for which I have waited in   QUEST. .        135 an agony of suspense, is in my hand but unopened as yet.

When the messenger had departed, Ralph opened the letter; it was long; it would require time to read the closely written sheets. "If Teesdale were only not coming!" he said, as he placed the letter on his heart. Mr. Teesdale arrived and dinner was announced. A potage au gibier, saumon d la sauce rose, chamig nons en coguille, with sundry entr esand a delicious roti, Ermine placed on the table, a look of conscious superiority, quite edifying, mnaking his ebon face to shine as gold. After discussing the dinner, the drive, his house, and the improvements still to be made on his estate, Mr. Teesdale said: "So it is all arranged, Stanley, you are to leave by the steamer two weeks hence. How long, think you, before you will return -?    \ "God only knows I " replied Ralph, with a groan. ' Why old boy, you seem dejected-have been so all day.

"A pertinent question, requiring a frank answer, which I give by asserting that love is an insanity, and I have never experienced more than bewilder- ment.

One of these days I shall seek - a bird for my nest, and become an ornamelnt to society as the respectable father of a family. Why don't you marry, Stanley?" "Perhaps I may one of 'these days, as:you say, if I can find a woman who so far exceeds her sex in purity, truth, and goodness, that I may trust her with my name, my honor, and my life." , , Comme tu prends Tyb au srieuz, moon cherf we are very well as we are. Marriage is too much a matter of bargain and sale in these days for good loyal fellows like ourselves to speculate therein. There's a great deal in you to love, Stanley, but I don't think I could woo a woman with any particu- lar virtue or personal charms of my own. I don't much like buying a wife; if she would sell herself, what would she do with me? * We will not marry, Stanley; pledge again.,"   QUESTr.         13 Coffee being served, the conversation continued till the fragrant havanas were reduced to ashes and evening far advanced; then Mr. Teesdale took hie departure. "Thank God I am alone I Oh, Adelaide, what a day of torture this has been!" said Ralph, closing and locking the door of his room. He took the letter from its hiding-place and read with a beating heart. The hours passed on, night advanced, yet still he read; sometimes he paused to pace the room with quick, uncertain steps, uttering incoherent words and broken sentences; then he laid his head on the table till it trembled with the agitation of his strong frame. Day dawned before he had finished ,the letter. He threw open his window; the morning was cool, the air laden with sea-odors; rosy clouds were flying be- fore the sun-beams; the city was still, as in slumber. Ralph looked up to the heavens, the seven-fold heavens, where day and night, the golden mist of stars veils the supernal glory of higher worlds, and, kneeling, prayed for herhe loved; with all his soul he prayed even as she had entreated. ; In his intense desire for her happiness he felt his impuissance; there was but One who could pour infinite love into her soul, changing by a breath its speechless, bitter memories of pain and anguish to ineffable joy and peace. Would his, prayer avail? He had kept for her the night watches; he needed no sleep when morning greeted him; he walked the /  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7529-00000069"/> 138        QUEST., room, extending his arms towards the new day. "My   Adelaide," he exclaimed, "I shall see you in a few brief hours; my bird with a broken wing, come home to my heart! I will stand between you and the world--the world that knows you not, and Dmy love shall make for you an Eden where sin shall not enter. I love you, I love you! The past, you thought would separate us, will unite us the more surely for ever, for you are mine, Adelaide; mine. 0 God be thanked!" He took the letter again and read it calmly. The wilful, impetuous nature, restrained by love, yet driven to wrong, weakness, sinfulness by abuse and unkindness, he comprehended, nor was he unjust in condemning the pride and folly tmat had saddened the life so dear to him ; yet with all her errors clearly written out before him, he judged her by the voice appealing from his heart; it bade him think how he had watched her from the moment when the passion slumbering in his soul had been stirred by the music of her voice ; neither look, word, nor act of hers had' escaped him since that hour. Her influence was that of a refined, spiritual mind; the calmness of her mien revealed the strong nature beneath the surface, yet suggested strength controlled by reason. Years of pain, which had so purified the passionate, ungovernable temper and subdued the uncurbed will, had only added to the sorrow burdening her life   QUEST.-        189 with its weary weight; this was the thought which oppressed him. Even his love could not heal the wound that took the life-blood from her-heart. Her sorrows were indeed his sorrows, for now the thought of this child loved and lost, came before him with fearful vividness. "Oh, that it had never been born!" he groaned; and yet but an hour before he had, prayed that mother and child might be united, that her sin might no longer stand before the face of the 'Most High. The struggle was brief; if hisheart closed against the child, if his pride revolted at the thought of linking himself with a remembrance of the inan who had robbed him of the best years of Adelaide's life, his love prevailed, and he resolutely determined to sacri- fice his prejudice, to sacrifice himself, if nlecessary, to secure her happiness; his life was no longer his own; henceforth Adelaide should be thq supreme thought influencing it. Thus absorbed in reverie, time passed, till Ermnine knocked his usual morning re- veille at his naster's door. The faithful servant saw at a glance the bed un- disturbed, the light yet burning, his master still in the dress of the previous evening, and papers cover- ing the table. He prepared a bath, arranged every- thing for the convenience of the toilette, and- left the room, saying to himself: " 'Pears like somefin wrong; Mas'r Stanley ain't been to bed no how dis yer night, that ar's clar to der most or'nary observer; he won't  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7529-00000070"/> "O         QUEST. eat nothin' neither 'less itsuncommon del'cate; dis nigger muas git inspiration sumhow." Ermine was right;: his master:was in no mood for eating; but, on entering the breakfast room, .he was served with a plump, broiled woodcock, surtounded by dewy water-cress; creamy flakes of pomme de terque a la maitre d'Xhtel, and a: golden melon, luscious and fragrant, tempted his appetite and re- freshed his over-tasked strength. A good breakfast is at all times a pleasant beginning for a day ;: many a day's bad work may be traced to 'the breakfast table.  The sun did- not hasten on for all Ralph's impa- tience; yet the hours sped away. Half an hour before noon he threw himself into a carriage and bade the driver take him to Brookdale. He stopped at the entrance of the avenue which led from the publlic road to the cottage. It was a quiet spot, where trees of every variety seemed to have sprung up wild and irregularly; the ground was uneven a and broken by masses of rock which were covered with moss and creepers. The effect was picturesque. ' A clump of evergreens completely sheltered the cottage from view till one stood almost at the door; a pleasant, open meadow-land, extending wide be- ,yond, gave breadth to the surroundings and dignity to the otherwiseo :humble dwelling, which was :of stone, a broad piazza inclosing it on all sides, with vines and; creeoers clinging. from ground to roof.   QUEST.         141 Ralph, at the' door, was welcomed by the grave old woman who had brought him the letter. :.A moment and he stood in the little parlor where. he 'found Adelaide, who, on beholding' him, seemed powerless to move or speak; her: large, dark eyes looked eagerly into Whis, yet her face was marble-, like; the flesh seemed bloodless.  He read her soul at a glance, took both her hands in his,'and answered her look with a smile of tender- ness, trust, and love. "My Aedelaide, my very own! Oh, my soul, I love! you! Anid by that love I: claim you. My life is yours; my name is yours. You will not speak, Adelaide "               ' Her eyes, that had neverdleft his, drooped; her head fell on her breast; she trembled and would have fallen, but his strong arms encircled her; he placed her in a chair and knelt beside her.

H "Happy I Oh, Ralph, you ask me ' Since I met you I have awakened to new life; a veil seems to have swept between me and the past; the one sor- row that has tortured and overwhelmed me has been lulled to rest in the great joy of being near you. Since the night we parted with your-love in my soul, your words in my brain, I have been at rest, body and spirit, for though I felt I had lost you, it was ineffable joy to know you loved me; it gave me new strength to feel there was that in me which had won on'e so beyond and above me."

Yet we will for- get the past. Is it not possible?" Would to God I could wipe it out for ever I I shudder at the thought of blending my troubled life with yours. I cannot free myself from the blight resting on me, linking me with the past. Love would teach me to fill all your requirements, yet love bids' me think of your future.

With my aid you may be free from your sorrows. Your child is mine, is she not? We will seek her together; we will love her with one love." "God bless you, Ralph! Do not mind my tears.

I could not live without you; then what is life if I may not bless you, even as in your presence I am blest?" Two loving hearts united by perfect "sympathy seek not to control the expression of thought; thus commruning without reserve, Ralph and Adelaide heeded not time as it passed. He did not disturb the delight of their interview by reference to his  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7529-00000072"/> "4       i  QUEST. speedy departure ;it would be better, he thought, to break it to her gently and gradually. The thought- of parting, was to him unendurable; to speak of it would not lessen the pain; he would have this first, hour of their union free from the least pang or regret, that she might turn to: it in all future time with pleasure. "I would see your mother, Adelaide'" he said, becoming conscious of the lapse of time; " and yet I dread to stand -before, her, now that I have won to myself her treasure." "She thinks only of my good, Ralph; you will forget your fears in her presence.'" When she departed -Ralph observed the room, which was arranged with peculiar effect. The fur- niture was simple and appropriate; doors and win- dows: were completely surrounded by ivy of lixui- ous groWth- There were several good paintings and prints on the walls; beneaths each wa a long box covered with moss, from which ivy fell in graceful festoons and :also framed the picture. Moss baskets of various shapes, filled with ferns, stood-on the ta- bles. The eye constantly conveyed pleasant thoughts to the brain, and thus the little room lost its homely aspect.   - The painting which arrested his attention was a portrait he recognized at once. The face was striking, the brow: noble, the features marked and strong. There was something in the dreamy eyes which con-   QUEST.        o145 tradicted the other features, and perplexed one how to decipher the character. Whilst looking at this face, of which the counterpart was fixed for ever on his heart, Ralph turned to meet Adelaide and her mother. Mrs. de Rennville's face had been moulded by the soul within; so much of her life had been passed in solitude and retirement, that the necessity of wear- ing the world-mask was unknown to her; it was traced by few lines, and retained the pure, fresh complexion she had brought, as a girl, from over the . seas. Her hair was white, abundant, and, soft, with a wave that gave it light and shadow. To see her was to wish to know her; to know her was to love her. She welcomed Ralph with quiet courtesy and few words; both tone and words con- veyed to him he was not an intruder. Only a re- fined and well-bred woman can plt a man at his ease in embarrassing or peculiar situations. Ralph was grateful for the delicate tact which sustained and enabled him to pass through a trying ordeal creditably. As conversation progressed he was more and more agreeably impressed with Mrs. de Renn- ville; she rather suggested than advanced thought, and adapted herself readily to the views and opinions he expressed. To terminate so pleasant an interview required an effort on his part; there, in that little room, within the limitof its narrow circle, was his happiness, his 7  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7529-00000073"/> "6         QUEST. life's sole aim and purpose. Without, the worl with Sits honors, ambitions, and pleasures, smiled deri- sively at his infatuation. Yet all its pomp and pride could not influence or turn him from the place irra- diated by the presence of her he loved. As he took his leave, Mrs. de Rennville said: "We shall be glad if you will dine with us to- morrow at five o'clock. Adelaide leaves her studio at four; we have thus a long evening together." In parting with Adelaide it was-" 'Till the mor- row ;' happy words, that promised a speedy re- union. Ralph returned to the city and took his way to the' office of his friend, Cecil Welles. The outer room, filled with persons awaiting their turn to be admitted into the inner sanctum, was evidence of the name and fame of its occupant. Passing them all, and slipping his card under the door to which many eyes were impatiently turned, Ralph had the satisfaction in a few mompents of seeing it open, and of finding himself alone with his friend. A face of rare manly beauty had Cecil Welles; every feature was perfect; even the crisp, black, curling hair massed itself gracefully to the classic moulding of the head. Pale anrid stern in repose, the face glowed, the eye flashed, under the influence of feeling or excitement. He was tall, but needed physical development to agive strength and vigor to his frame. A life of study and close attention to his   QUEST.         147 profession, the law, had exhausted the body, while it fed-the-brain, even in early manhood. Ralph Stanley was welcomed cordially and warmly. "You know, my dear fellow," he exclaimed, seat- ing himself, " that I would- not disturb you on a slight cause; therefore give ear at once to my ne- cessities, and bear in mind tha;t-you mustfindi a way to help me. 'But, first, I will tell you frankly, the assistance I need is not for myself but for one very dear to me."  "Go on, Stanley. I will d4o all in my power for you oryours.

Calmly and quietly his friend made minutes of the'information, and questioned him a6 to dates, per- sons, and other particulars.  "I think 1 understand' the case thoroughly, and see my way clearly, Stanley. Do you wish me to act at once?

"I will leave for INew York to-night and return in two days; I shall then be enabled to give my opi-  nion as to our success, and will see your friend if you still desire it." To Cecil Welles all things were possible; there was a quiet, calm strength about him that inspired confidence and gave the clue to his success, which had been unparalleled in a city where young men are not permitted to enter life fairly with those already in the field, but are forced to wait for expe- rience and grey heads. This success, his enemies said, was owing to his never undertaking a bad case, yet his enemies could not convert to their opinion those who were fortunate enough to secure his services. If he never lost a case or failed in accomplishing a purpose, it was that his imperturbable firmness of character gave him will and power; he worked stoutly, unmindful of fatigue or discouragement; he placed no reliance on others; he trusted himself alone, for within himself he felt success. Ralph appreciated and loved him ; they had been friends for years; it was a great relief to confide in one so reliable, to have a strong arm extended to aid when his own weakness was most apparent. On meeting Adelaide the next evening Ralph referred to his cousin Harry's illness and the possible necessity of sending him abroad; his aunt's help- lessness and misery at her son's departure he pre.   QUEST.        149 sented in such a way that his own part in the accom- plishment of this purpose was not suspected. After dinner Adelaide proposed a stroll to the lake-side; it was then, as Mrs. de Rennville and Ralph, engaged in conversation, lingered in their walk, that he told her of his love for Adelaide and asked her to regard him with favor. The mother answered, with a mother's love, " he was Adelaide's choice; she .would also receive him into her heart and pray heaven to bless hinr even as he blessed her child." They came to the lake-side where boats, freighted with merry parties, glanced to and fro, white swans floated proudly, and children were sporting in wild- est glee. At intervals, snatches of song and pro- longed notes would steal over the waters with a vibrating tremulous tone; or joyous, laughing voices, far away, came gushing in echo close at hand. The sun went down and gave a look at the lake that made it quiver and burn like a fire opal; the swans took the hue of the rose-red light; the children were transfigured with a glory not of earth. Here they rested and lingered; it was a scene to be enjoyed, a night to be remembered and recalled when its subtle influence alone rested on the life. Returning to the cottage, Adelaide seated herself at the piano, and then for the first time did Ralph understand her talent and power; free and unre. strained in the present of those she loved, she gave.  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7529-00000075"/> 150         .QUEST. herself up to music, and being thrilled and exalted herself, drew their hearts on with the rush of melo- dies, till:tone seemed language, and language unveil- ed the mystery of that realm unseen, where music is the pulse of life. It wasinpthat golden: mist of sound, in that spiritu- alized atmosphere where sense had no sway, that Ralph met the soul of her: he loved face .to face; with the peace that came over him as the pure, luminous eyes fixed his own, he knew all he sought was found, all he had yearnedto clasp was his, all his restlessness was stilled to ;deep; calm for ever. When they parted he carried the tones of her voice with him; they enringed and clung to his spirit without disturbing it,; hei felt her: presence. as the subtle perfume of a flower transfusing him--the very life ofi his life.  ..; Great as was hisfaith in Cecil' Welles, Ralph went to him, on the morning of his return from New Yoik, with anxiety.  "I have accomplished something, Stanley, and do not despair of, making further progress, although the case is perplexing."  Ralph was .cheered at once and listened attentive- ly as his friend proceeed.      ..

I explained to my cousin the importance of my being kept informed of Miss Mandevil's every proceeding with reference to her brother's child; that the efforts she had made to discover its place of concealment would doubtless be successful, as she was known :to have wealth and position, and her property, if she remained unmarried, would descend to this child; that whoever now held the child in charge would, in time, communicate with her, and that her hatred towards the mother might induce her to devise away of disappearing, as her brother had done, were the child once given into her power.

He had seen her, but she would not reply to his questions, nor would any bribe tempt her to betray what she knew of Robert Mandevil. Her companions had never heard her mention his naame; they had endeavored in various ways to throw her off hefr guard, but in vain. "I determined to see this woman. After hours of fruitless search, going from place to place, every step plunging me deeper in the guilt and slime of human degradation, I found her. She was ill, dying, and, strange to say, repentant. I will pass over the means employed to obtain the information received, and will convey it to you briefly as possible. "Two years previous to his marriage, Robert Man- devil met this woman, who seems to have influenced him hs much from sincere attachment as rare beauty. She was jealous and exacting, however, and his changing caprices and frequent liaisons were a source of bickering between them. He had not been mar- ried a month when he returned to her, declaring himself disgusted with his wife. He then proposed the fishing excursion, which she was to join; that took him away during the summer, and the ensuing winter they passed together at Cuba. "The plan of separating the child from the mother did not occur to Robert Mandevil till he perceived how Adelaide's life was engrossed and absorbed in the newly awakened instinct and love that served to annihilate all grief and remembrance of the past.

"On the morning when the nurse and child disap- peared, they were received into the house of this* woman; the next day Robert Mandevil returned to the city, and before night they were all embarked on board a ship bound for Fayal, in the Azores, recorded in the passenger-list as Mr. and Mrs. Morton, nurse, and child. A few days before arriving in port, the nurse was taken ill and died suddenly; as she had been in good health during the passat her death occasioned much speculation, which soon gave place to the excitement of landing, and was forgotten. "They remained very nearly two years in Fayal, living in retirement, never mixing with the few Eng- lish and American families there-the only persons they associated with being foreign residents and natives of the island. The child grew and thrived, and became a great pet and favorite with her father, who watched over her, permitting no neglect of duty in those employed to care for her. The woman seems to have been fond of the child; she spoke of it with great tenderness, and said it was so fair and pure, she trembled when she caressed it. "Robert Mandevil could not change his nature; the jealous eye of an exacting woman detected his flagrancy; quarrels and discord began anew.

"You see, Stanley, we are as much in doubt and darkness as ever as to the fate of this child, and must trust to chance for the present. The captain who had this woman in charge is in Calcutta; he might know if Robert Mandevil sailed for any foreign port, or came directly home on leaving Fayal. Could we but trace him from place to place, we might get a clue to all that perplexes us. I leave it for you to judge if I shall see yo friend and communicate that which I have told you."

A pleasant welcome greeted him. It was a spacious room, covered with a Persian rug, and draped with quiet grey hangings. A few pieces of antique furniture, elaborately carved, served for use and ornament. Easels, filled with pictures and sketches, stood near the light falling from one high window. A large jardinibre, fi ed with flowers, perfumed the air. Children's toys were lying here and there, and filled all available space in   QUEST.         15q the corners.

As children rarely like to sit for a picture, I am forced to surround myself with objects that will attract and please them." "It is the right thing, Adelaide.

Fortunately, in Cecil Welles I have not only the legal counsellor, but a true, tried friend; a man you will appreciate and esteem when you know him. I told him all, and urged his acting for us at once. "The very day I placed the case in his hands, he left for New York and returned this morning. -When I give you the result of his efforts, you will tell me if I have overrated his ability." Grateful and satisfied as was his own mind with what his friend had accomplished, Ralph was not prepared for Adelaide's emotion.

"'I know no reason why your wish cannot be realized. We will consult Mr. Welles this evening." "You are my good angel, Ralph! The whole face of the world is changed since you crossed my path." "And think youj Adelaide, the world is not changed for me since conscious of your soul beside -me, day and night, my heart has thrilled with deep joy, and the very fulness of peace and rest has entered my being. I leave you now till evening. I have one little favor to ask. I have never seen you in white; since our first meeting you have been dressed in black. You may think me unreasonable, yet I have a vision of you, floating in my brain which I would realize with my eyes in all its spiritual beauty." "You shall have your wish.

Ralph was soon on his way to the cottage with his friend Cecil Welles. Adelaide received them with composure. Ralph/ conversed with Mrs. de Rennville, who was present, and thus gave Adelaide an opportunity of expressing her gratitude to his firiend. The countless questions she asked, the many times she urged him to repeat the details of his con- versation with the woman fromn whom he obtained information regarding her child, would have wea- ried a less kindly nature. He felt she trusted him, and he read her heart clearly as the iron rule of reserve fell back, and the lava-torrent of feeling gushed through her lips. It was a September evening; the air was laden with heavy odors of/ autumn flowers, the atmo- sphere misty with the red light that lingered till moonrise. As they sat talking, evening came on apace. "4 ( Shall we have lights, dear mother?" asked Ade- laide. "It will be moonlight presently, and we may still      QUEST.         1( enjoy the night with open windows.

She played Schumann's " Visions," then sang Men- delssohn's "Rest in the Lord." The deep, pure tones of her voice, thrilling up through the room, blended with the odors of the flowers, and floated afar on the purple dusk of evening. The hour of parting came; then Ralph and his friend turned towards the city; their thoughts, how- ever, took them back to Adelaide. "I confess, Stanley,' said Cecil Welles, " seldom: to have been so impressed with a woman as with Adelaide de Rennville. She has the frankness and simplicity of a child, combined with the earnestness and dignity of a woman. She looks on life through the medium \of beauty. The sorrow she has expe- rienced has developed and -strengthened a noble nature, leaving it free from the vulgarism of preju- dice. I marvelled at the wisdom of her thought, as at the exquisite delicacy and refinement with which she gave it expression. " I like her, Ralph. She is a woman whose friend- ship I covet. Her love is priceless !" " You are right, Welles. She satisfies my ideal of woman.

J "Without - Ermine the kitchen will be useless to me. I shall close it with the motto- ' Non omnia possumus omnes." They parted on reaching the city to go their seve- ral ways-Cecil Welles to prepare with care a case he was to argue before a jury next day; Ralph Stanley to nerve himself for the approaching sepa- ration that deepened in gloom as it drew near, and to dream of a future where the word parting could not ring its hateful knell on his soul. Ermine was- up betimes next morning, and had returned from the old market under Quincy Hall, while yet the sun was chasing the morning mists, his basket laden with dainties. He had made good bargains, found all he needed for the skilful prepa- ration of sundry delectable sauces, always begotten of inspiration; yet, notwithstanding his good luck, he walked with a shuffling step and hung his head.

With Sarah's aid, Ermine advanced very considera- bly in his preparations for dinner before it was time to make ready for breakfast; that savory meal was served, and enjoyed by his master and Mr. Teesdale to Ermine's entire satisfaction. Ralph passed the first hours of the morning with Cecil Welles. Whilst at his office, a telegram was received from New York announcing the death of the woman Adelaide had hoped to see. Ralph left at once for her studio. Adelaide listened in silence to the communication, which brought both pain and disappointment. Ralph endeavored to fill her mind with his hope of future success in tracing her child. He assured her of his friend's ability and power, illustrating his patient, persevering energy, by several anecdotes that served to -ivert her mind.

"I will do as youi desire, Ralph, though I hardly think it possible he will waste his time on me."' "There is another wish in my heart, Adelaide, though I find it difficult- to express it. I do not like this art-life for you. I would have you leave it, Adelaide. That you should work day by day for your bread, is revolting to me." "But my mother, Ralph.

Were they not golden with Septem- ber's sunlight, rich in its gorgeous fruits and flow- ers, fragrant with the sweet breath of the passing year,- voicefull with the exuberance of life I And passing swiftly, silently, were they not each rounded in fulness of beauty, by hope, faith, love, and the divine music of two listening, echoing hearts?

Still through all future time would they cluster as stars on the horizon-the beginning and end of every circle of gladness, These days so bright, so sacred, heralded the bit- ter hour of parting; it came to tear their souls with its keen, sharp pain. Despite all preparation, all determination to be calm, its darkness enfolded them; weak and terrified, they were as children.

The building was not originally intended for stu dios; a celebrated artist having taken a room there for the purpose of painting, a confraternity gathered about him, awakening new life withih those gloomy walls-a calm, peaceful, and thoughtful life. To the sensitive mind, a glimpse of blue sky, a blade of grass, a stray dove or drooping flower, may recall whole pages of nature's book as seen in and out amongst the valleys and over the purple hills; but what pleasure and relief to quit the deafening noise, and the jostling, twitching, thrusting crowd of the street, to mount-by two stairways nearer heaven.

What a busy, cheery, hopeful place it was; and: breathing its enchanted atmosphere, how loath was one to descend into the vortex of life-hard, unyielding, real life below! The studio adjoining that of Adelaide -de Renn- ville was iccupied by Alexis, a portrait painter. He had secured two rooms in addition to his'studio, where, with his wife, he lived happy and content, though their home was neither spacious nor luxu- rious. He had married in the face of poverty and against the advice of patrons and friends; he wooed and won his wife through many and peculiar diffi- culties, but he won her at last, and brought her to be the light of his life, the presiding genius of his art, securing to himself a solace against the ills and buffetings of fortune. Happy Alexis After three years of married life, he could still gate on that face of rarest beauty; and discover in its changing grace and expression some new, unimagined charm.

She floated before the eye in her light canoe over the deep mystery of the lake alone, in the first flush of childhQQd, disrobed of her homely garments, adorned by her own tiny hands with run- ning mosses, twin flower-vines, and mountain laurel blooms; and, leaning over the rim of her shell-like boat, she sees a wondrous vision in the pure, calm water, with her own dark hair, clear hazel eyes, and fair white skin flashing through the leaves and flowers.       .

She turns to the*side occupied by the men, but here encounters equal derision Again she appears, lost in the interminable giant forest, where she passes the night in the cave of a bear, and is only rescued from death by the turning out of all the villagers in the search for her. In these and many changing scenes, Margaret flits through the brain, and it is pleasant to know her as not wholly unreal, but to recognise many incidents of Maud's child-life woven into the strange fiction which conceals under its surface of beauty an inex- haustible treasure of thought. Alexis had married and brought his bride to her home in the studio building at the time when Ade- laide took a room there. The beautiful face of the artist's wife, her kind, genial nature, ler unassum- ing, trusting manner, broke down the barrier Ade. laide's reserve would have placed between them, and they soon became friends.. In many ways they were enabled to benefit each other. A trifling kindness gives exceeding pleasure where enjoyments are few and luxury is unknown. A bunch of flowers, a cluster of ferns, a basket of fruit or new-laid eggs-Adelaide's offerings from the country--filled Maud's face and home with sunshine for a whole day. Then she, in return, had a knack of making marvellous rag-dolls, and repairing neatly the disfiguring touches of certain wanton little fingers belonging to the mimic revellers who created * '  * '  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7529-00000091"/> 182         QUEST, for themselves an enchanted realm out of the mate. rial found in Adelaide's studio.  Alexis' fame as an artit, hardly established when he married, had steadily increased. Love, the true, the only inspiration, breathed on his eyes, and they opened to apprehend the glowing, spiritual side of nature, whether presented in, her simplest forms or in the image created after the likeness of God. He toiled-on, conscious of the growing power within, loving art for itself and striving to follow whither it led, although with that dearer self beside him, he was forced to work for bread; and, alas t he had a hard struggle/ to satisfy life's need day by day. On the morning after Ralph's departure, Ade- laide entered her studio wearied, depressed and dis- heartened. It was the natural reaction after intense happiness. Maud knocked, and, receiving no answer, opened the door. She perceived at a glance her friend's dejection, and quietly busied herself with arranging the toys.  Presently a second knock, loud and sharp. Ade- laide, roused from reverie, lifted her head from the table where it rested and beckoned Maud to open the door. A basket of exquisite hot-house flowers was left for Adelaide. Her eyes she received them, fell on a note half hidden in the -leaves.- As she drew it   QUESTO.         183 forth she felt in every thrilling pulse, down even to her burningfinger-tips, it was from h/imr She forgot Maud. At sight of the dear, familiar writing, she kissed the paper, and her heart sent up its full burst of joy as she read: "MY OWN ADELAIDE :-Every morning you will receive a basket of flowers till my return. Every day one day less to wait.! Let the flowers say this to your heart, and let their sweet faces with their perfume gladden your life. Be cheerful for plmy sake.      .          RALPH." "Oh, Maud, you love your husband!" said Ade- laide, throwing her arms about her friend. "Is it not a deep, delicious, holy feeling--a joy too-great for words?"  "A joy too great for words!" repeated Maud, fervently. "I know it; I feel it; it is mine also, this joy; for, Maud, he is my husband. I shall be his wife. His wife; oh, my God, be praised! Look, Maud V" Adelaide opened a casket from which she drew a sketch of Ralph. "See; is he not noble I Is it not a face beaming with truth and goodness? Is it not a face to love, to worship? Yes, worship; for he is my religion now I Look whilst I tell you of him; you can come prehend me."   &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7529-00000092"/> QUEST. Maud, the true wife, listened and comprehended. Adelaide did not say much of herself, but she told of Ralph's love, which had overcome many obstacles and made her his, so that in her heart's joy she claimed to be his own for ever. To Maud's eyes, her calm, grave friend suddenly became transformed to a beautiful, eager, passionate woman; even her hair was electric with life; it escaped its fastenings and fell in masses over her shoulders, emitting gleams of light that seemed to add to the rich color which flushed her cheek. "If Anton could but see her what a picture he would make " was the wife's thought, but she did not express it. Her joy in Adelaide's happiness was sincere and deep; they seemed now to stand on the same level; looking into each other's eyes, they needed not language to give expression to thought. "Is it a secret?" asked Maud. Adelaide bent over the flowers and inhaled their perfume. The flush on her cheek tinged the white roses an exquisite pink. "If I could have kept it in my own heart I would not have breathed it even to these flowers. But he said it was best to letilthe world know, so you see I cannot keep my secret if I would. I cannot speak of him to every one, Maud. -Do not let them talk to me or congratulate me." "It shall be as you' wish, Adelaide; Anton will   nanage it. I came to you this morning from the artists, but I would not speak when I saw how sad you looked. You know to-night is our first recep- tion. The tableaux are to be in our rooms; the artists are gathered there and wish you to aid in arranging the costumes and draperies. Will you come " " How selfish in me to have forgotten it, and also the flowers I promised you; but they shall come yet, fresh from the garden and in good time. What are the tableaux for this evening " "We decided on five scenes from Browning's 'Blot in the 'Scutcheon.' The German quintette of stringed instruments will play for us. They have arranged exquisite music for every scene and inter- val." "But why select a tragedy, one of such unmiti- gated sorrow  Surely you ask people here to be amused, not to be sickened to the soul with crime and suffering?": "I agree with you, Adelaide, but the artists, par- ticularly James, Hunt, Arley, and Madame Tamia, insist that the tableaux will be very effective; they: overruled all my objections. At the next reception we are to have four scenes from ' Midsummer Night's Dream,' and two scenes with Mignon in Wilhelm Meister."

In another part of the room several per- sons were amusing themselves in trying on costumes which gave the oddest and most fantastic appear- ance to the wearer. Draperies of cloth, cotton, silk, satin, and velvet were lying about in picturesque confusion. Pictures were piled in the corners; rough boards and clumsy tools were thrown amongst exquisite vases, rare casts, and cases of jewels. All: the artists in the building, both men and women, had gathered here to give any needful assistance, and to make their own comments on the propriety and harmony of the arrangements., It was a study to watch their countenances, to note how the common cause and feeling which united them for the hour affected them individually. Amongst the men, a few faces denoting coarseness and infe- riority brought into relief the general intellectual and refined cast of the heads grouped together, but it was peculiar to remark the rareness of that attri- bute to which their lives were devoted-the Beau- tiful.  One artist, whose pictures were so true to nature, that gazing on 'his canvas was like: drinking her :into the soul through a reflection, had indeed a head perfectly moulded, with features not wanting in symmetry, but his eyes were small, ugly, repul- sive; they mocked the otherwise excellent face. &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7529-00000094"/> QUEST. This did not annoy him as it did his friends, for he was popular, and every one had attempted to sketch him; artist-like, they expressed the eyes as they felt them at heart, just failing thereby to make a likeness. Another, James, concealed the delicacy and re- fined moulding of his face by a heavy beard and moustachio that swept away all outline of mouth, chin, and cheeks, and by hair so exuberant in growth that it massed in dense curls over the brov and touched close on the large, keen eyes. Alexis had a head and face such as is seen irf the pictures of Byron. Hunt lookedi like one of the regal gentle- men pictured by Rembrandt. Conspicuous in the crowd stood Arley. Tall, well-built, with fine, antique head and perfect fea- tures, he could not fail to attract the eye of an observer. Sketch-book in hand, he arrested the passing scene, and, by a few touches, made each cha- racter speak from the page. The principal group in his sketch occupied the centre of the room. Several men were gathered round a woman who was wind- ing about her head and shoulders a gorgeous dra- pery of green and orange, studded with gold. Her sinuous, graceful movements, revealed all the volup- tuous beauty of her figure; her garments seemed to cling to her only to unfold the perfect outline. The face that looked from beneath these coils of brilliant color was peculiar; the dark eyes were made more   QUEST.   189   dusky by long lashes, and heavy, square eyebrows; the mouth was well shaped, yet it was a cruel mouth for all its curves; the complexion was dark and tawny. Lines, fine as if made with a needle- point and coarse as if laid on with a brush, crossed each other repeatedly on the brow, at the corners of the eye, and about the mouth; this tracery, with the lurid gleam of the eye, told all the story of a life to one skilled in interpreting such intricacies. Ma- dame Lamia, for thus she was named, perceived Adelaide as she entered the studio. Twisting her- self out of the draperies she had assumed, she ap- proached, extending both hands: "Here comes the Madonna," she exclaimed. "Why did you not come before? Why did you wait to be sent for? You knew we could not arrange the draperies or the costumes for Mildred and Guendolen without you. What shall they be? "If you have not yet decided, I should suggest white and silver, with pearls as ornaments, for Guendolen; violet, faced with crimson, and garnets or carbuncles as ornaments, for Mildred," replied Adelaide. "Oh no, no! That would never do. Mildred must appear in white, Guendolen in crimson or orange. Mildred is fair; Maud represents her perfectly. Guendolen is dark; Hunt's wife takes the part, and with her oriental beauty she will be superb; she will wear diamonds and emeralds as jewels."  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7529-00000095"/> QUSTr., "But you forget, Madame Lamia, that the tableau is a living picture.

Sinned I 'P4Staw, the world will yet outlive its code of morals, even as religious sects have outlived their creeds. Turn to Shelley, whom you quote often enough, and read what he says. I confess your subtle reasoning to be beyond me, but I know it is absurd that Mildred should be represented as you. suggest. The whole effect of the tableaux depends on the drapery. Fancy Hunt's wife in white and silver, with pearl ornaments, as Guendolen-her large brown eyes and raven hair unrelieved by color I It's absurd!" ' "She looks very well in white, I assure you," said Maud, gently, "and the violet dress with crim- son facings would suit me admirably." Madame Lamia answered -with an expressive shrug of the shoulders and a smile. Her teeth were white; the smile was treacherous. Hunt and Arley approached. Madame Lania consulted them eagerly on the question in dispute. "Let us carry out the Madonna's8 suggestion, by all meaiis," said Arley. "It is quite correct, and proves us to have been wanting in certain delicate perceptions rather essential to proficiency in art." "How blunt and coarse were the perceptions of   QUEST.   191   the old masters," said Madame Lamia, sneeringly. "Guido draped his Beatrice in white.

"As it is, she will pardon the rudeness of my interruption, and permit me to claim the attention of these ladies, for whom we have waited somewhat impatieptly." As the three moved away, Madame Lamia looked after them with an expression of enmity and ill-will that darkened her face to positive ugliness. Arley, observant and ready, put it down in his sketch-book. "The very face for my Ottima; the blank cheek, the cloven- brow, the drawn lips and puckered' chin. Thanks, Madame!" he said to him- self, with inward satisfaction. But she, unmindful of other eyes, kept her gaze fixed on the retreating figures. I hate Adelaide de Reenville!" she rather hissed than muttered. "She is cold as ice, passionless as clay, proud as if entitled to be considered an artist.

Ha! here comes Hunt again, and without that woman. I'll see if I can make him forget my unlucky reference to cer- tain pictures- he may not choose to consider as pure and spiritual as his da Fiesole. ' " Oh, Mr. Hunt," she said, as he was passing, "you must aid We in arranging the cloak-room, and order mirrors to be placed there, that the last touches of the toilette may be properly given by the brilliant dames who will honor our fete with their presence?" "Rothsay will attend to that; he is already at his work. They are discussing in the reception-room yonder where the musicians shall be placed; per- haps you would gire a voice in the matter. I go to call the actors in the tableaux for rehearsal." "I will accompany you," she said, and they passed out together. , The room grew noisy; the clamor was continuous; the sharp ring of the hammer was lost in the deeper surges of tone from human voices, yet a kind of order ruled, and there followed the details of scene- ry, the impromptu dressing for characters and rehear  '    QUEST.         193 sal of the scenes, arrangement of light and shadow, distance, &amp;c. The confusion increased as the hours went by, and it seemed as if harmony could be pro- duced from siuch discord only by a miracle. The work progressed, however, and, by the patient indus- try of many busy hands, things gradually' assumed their places. Chinese lanterns, strange in shape and various in hue, were hung in the corridors. Plants ornamented the stairway. All the studios were thrown open; the best pictures brought into strong light; the walls were decorated with    effective  draperies, paintings, prints, sketches, and here- and there cases'-of birds, butterflies, beetles, old armor, and casts., Flowers in vases, in baskets, in wreaths, were everywhere; the air was laden with the perfume of roses, heliotrope, jessamine, mignonette, and orange blooms; it swept every studio clean of the taint of smoke from   pipe or cigar, and seemed a fitting atmosphere for the place where the beautiful was worshipped. Adelaide assisted Maud all day, and stayed till the last arrangements were completed for the even- ing; then together they visited the studios. Maud flitted in and out like a bird; everywhere she found'something to admire. "Oh, it's like fairy- land!"' she exclaimed. "Every room is transformed; the  beautiful draperies, the flowers, the colored 9  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7529-00000097"/> 194        QVEST. lamps, the statues, the fixtures--they seem created by enchantment!" "Yes, the effect is indeed enchanting, and there seems nothing wanting to carry out your impres- sion," replied Adelaide. "See those marbles gleam- ing through the foliage'in the hall, their calm repose and matchless beauty in perfect harmony with the rare visions we have met. One might think them guardians of the place. We but need music to break the silence and entraruce us into forgetting every- thing but the ideal." "Stay, dear Adelaide, for the evening. It would be so nice to have you here! Think of the delicious music and the pleasant people; we shall have a merry time, I assure you." "I should enjoy it, Maud. I should like to see the bright,happy faces, the brilliant toilets, the many distinguished men and beautiful women who will assemble here; but I can imagine them all, moving to and fro, delighting and delighted, as I sit at home with my mother. Now I must leave you, dear. You look well in your part; do not allow any bitter words to annoy or discourage you to- night." A few days after-the reception several artists were assembled in James's studio, which, being luxu- riously furnished with lounges and arm-chairs, and liberally provided with wine and cigars, was a favor- ite rendezvous. They were discussing the merits   QUEST.        196 of a picture by'Sybel, which had been exhibited at the reception and had attracted much attention. The scene was near Naples, the city in the dis- tance. - On a hillside in the foreground were two young girls bringing flowers to a shrine of the Vir- gin. At a little distance sat an old man extending his hands longingly towards the city. The hour, morning; a rose-violet haze, shot through with golden lights,'hung over the distance; the fore- ground was dewy and clear. Voice after voice cried out against the picture: "Exaggerated color!" "Incorrect drawing 1" "Perspective faulty!" "Figures too large!" ' Middle tints not cool!" "Foreground overloaded!" "Atmospheric effects decidedly bad!" "The picture is good," exclaimed James, energe- tically ; " in my opinion; the very best that has been done here. Sybel draws everything from life; he does not paint an inch of his canvas without nature before him. The spot he has chosen as a subject is as familiar to me as my own studio, and is perfectly represented even in its details. Manty an evening have Greenough, Sully, and I gone up that hillside by the old shrine, to study the effects of light from sunset till evening, and made sketches of the young girls grouped about the shrine, which is initself a  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7529-00000098"/> 196         QUEST. rare bit of workmanship. Sybel gives the splendor of the morning by the atmosphere, which one feels and almost breathes, as, looking through it miles and miles away, the eye is arrested by the city given in a few inimitable sweeps of color. The group of trees sheltering the old man toss out their branches as if swayed by the morning breeze; and mark, they are trees in shape and completeness, with irregular boughs interlacing and shooting out twigs and sprays innumerable, yet forming in all their ramifications nature's own lovely curves; the bark on the trunk is given with the true texture of woody fibre-wrinkled, rent, granulated, many-hued ; and through the foliage you feel the light by deep passages of broken gloom, misty, half-illumed hollows, transparent sprays, or dazzling reflections on glittering leaves, where parted boughs lift the eye to the sky. Then the figures- look at them in detail; what faultless drawing, what clear, pure color, what expression of delicate senti- ment, what: subtlvy blended contrasts!" "Why not add, what an effort of the brain to con- ;ceive such a stupendous work?" inteirupted a young artist.  "You may scoff if you will, and deny Sybel's power," continued James; " it will assert itself and be acknowledged by the public, who somehow appreciate truth."  ,           ,!j "Sybel -keeps himself aloof as if he were better than the rest of us, and he cannot expect us to take   QUEST.         197 the same interest in his-work as we might were he less cold and reserved," said another. "There-is no doubt in my mind as to how an artist should live," was the reply; "he must have complete control of his time and be free from rest- lessness or excitement; his strength lies in repose; his thought must spring into life from a calmn, untroubled mind. The man who cannot master himself can only paint lies." "Sybel's picture was not more liked at the Re- ception than Smith's Eve; yet you say puiblic opinion is the test of an artist's merit," said Moor. "How many persons looked at Smith's picture from depraved taste or morbid curiosity ; and how many because its excellence held them spell-bound, think you? Who could look at such a wretched, ill-drawn, sensual daub without wishing it torn to rags and the hand that painted it condemned to menial labor! Such-pictures disgrace our profession; they have no place in art; yet I regret to say there are some of us who aspire to nothing higher. An artist cannot be great when perverted or corrupt sentiment guides his pencil." "Look here, James, you are a jolly good fellow, and no saint, yet you are a very clever artist. If you follow the advice you have given us, you must lay aside portrait painting; for how many bad, sen. sual, yes, even brutish faces, you are obliged to take as subjects for the skilful handling of your brush I'  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7529-00000099"/> 198         QUEST. said Brown, laughing heartily, as he seized a palette and, with a few touches of color, gave a most ludi- crous effect to a face just sketched in on an easel. James was considered an authority in matters concerning art. Some years previous, his fame had so far established itself that he received a commis- sion to paint a picture for a cathedral in a Southern city; this required that he should go to Rome, as the studies for the work- could only be accomplished there. A pupil of Alston, he was prepared to study understandingly the works of the great masters revealed in the old world. That he comprehended them, felt their power, and reverenced their genius, was evident from his subsequent works. His posi- tion in Rome was an enviable one; it brought him constantly before the public and introduced him to the society of distinguished persons, ready and glad to encourage him. Several of his patrons were Englishmen of rank, who sought to induce him to give up all thought of returning home byassuring him of success in England. But the desire again to see his own land, the hope that his efforts there might avail to advance art and elevate it, even as he- in his soul exalted it, caused him to refuse all offers advantageous to his advancement elsewhere. He was rewarded for his disinterestedness; his pictures were eagerly sought on his return; his stu- dio was thronged with persons who could appreciate the rare brilliancy of his coloring, the delicacy and ] ,     '"  / '   QUEST.        199 harmony of his tints, his boldness of touch and cor- rect drawing. His portraits were remarkable for their truthful- ness and the power with which the character was expressed through the medium of the face. Generous, kind-hearted, sympathetic, James was popular with his brother artists, who respected his opinions and were influenced by his judgment. The sesthetical conversation was carried on till interrupted by Hunt, who entered the studio rub- bing his white hands, and said: "To-morrow evening, gentlemen, the Italian model will be at the Sketch--Club. She does not speak English, nor does her father who accompanies her; they are named Pacini." This information was received with a very general expression of satisfaction. The Sketch-Club was organized for the exclu- sive benefit of the artists; amateurs and dilettanti were not admitted to its sittings, which were held weekly, when every member was expected to pro- duce an original sketch or pay a fine. It was here the artists talked over their pictures, criticised each other's works, and forgot, in a general feeling of good- will, all petty jealousies and annoying differences.- Often, when thus assembled, they would mnake drawings from life, could a model be procured suited to their purposes. It was not difficult to obtain men and boys who would adapt themselves II.       .

Perfection of form, grace,;unconscious freedom of motion, modesty and beautyvcombined, were not to be met with ill the women who willingly lent themselves to the service of art. The; coming of the Italian girl was hailed with delight. She was the daughter of a. sculptor who had become involved in such difficulties in his own country, that he was forced to seek shelter in a for- eign land, where he hoped by his art to secure for himself a home. From   early childhood the girl had been accus- tomed to pose for her father's studies, and had fre- quented with him the ateliers of his friends, till her life was so infused with beautiful creations that her every look and motion were suggestive of the world in which she dwelt and to which she was devoted. It was agreed, by the members of the Club, that she should stand for Io, appealing to Jove against the persecutions of Juno; and when she came before them, radiant in beauty, chaste and pure in modesty as the white drapery half revealing, half concealing her exquisite, rounded figure, the artists were silent withithe hush of surprise and pleasure. Her rosy lit- tle feet, and white, plump, dimpled hands, were even more rare in, their perfection than the graceful head, with regular, expressive features and waving cloud of lustreless hair that floated into the air like a shadow.   QUEST.         201 Hunt formally presented her, saying they were fortunate in being able to study the perfections of the human form from so faultless a model, urging them reverently and silently to regard this most finished work of God, the nearest revelation of himself to man, aiming in all study and labor to attain some- thing of the purity of Angelico, the refinement and delicacy of Raphael, the strength and magnificence of Rubens, the power of Veronese, the tenderness of Tintoret, the grandeur and passion of Titian, the spiritual calm of deep-hearted Giorgione; avoiding faults such as led to the depravity of Caravaggio, the perverseness of Salvator, the sensuality of Correggio and Guidoe. "Let us not debase art by unworthy subjects," he concluded, " but seek whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are pure."        - The artists drew forth their tablets, and at the close of the evening, when the drawings were passed from hand to hand, it was observed that an unusual spirit and sentiment animated them; this-was attributed by many to the model, by a few to the influence of one earnest, truth-seeking mind. The Italian took a studio in the building, and exhibited two finely sculptured marbles as proof of }is skill. It was as much on account of the interest his daughter awakened as of his own talent that the artists were induced to noise his fame abroad, and seek to procure for him patrons and friends. 9*  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7529-00000101"/> 202        QUEST. Neither father nor daughter could express them- selves fluently-in any other language than their own; they had but a slight knowledge of French; this made it impossible for the young girl to associate freely with others of her sex in the building. Ade- laide and Madame Lamia were the only persons who could understand her imperfect attempts at expression in French; in the one she had a friend, in the other an enemy. Shortly after Pacini had established himself amongst them, Madame Lamia entered Adelaide's studio one day as she was putting in order the toys used by the little ones-who had given her a sitting. "Thought I would look into your nursery, as Amory calls it, Madonna, to give you good advice," said Madame Lamia, puffing- clouds of smoke into the atmosphere perfumed with Ralph's daily offering. "By the way, Amory is with me every day for no less a purpose than to induce me to get him the entr&amp;e to your studio. He tried humbugging me with a story of your being thefiancee of a friend of his, a Mr. Stanley. It was a good joke, though. Imagine any man with flesh and blood instincts falling in love, desperately in love, with- a marble woman like yourself!"

"My good-nature?" "Yes, from an impulse of good-nature; you take that Italian girl about with you, and frequently have her visiting your home; now, knowing as you do what her position is here, I think you run a great risk in being seen with her thus conspicuously. To be sure, it is not an affair in which I am interested, but I am- friendly enough not to wish to hear you spoken of slightingly; for this reason I have troubled myself sufficiently to come to you with advice--a favor I would not show most persons." "Thanks for your consideration, but tell me in what this poor child offends that I am to withdraw from her!" ' "Surely you know that, however such things may be regarded elsewhere, with us a girl who lives by exposing herself as a model is classed as beyond the pale of society; be she chaste as Diana, cold as the marble Juno, by pursuing such a course, she loses her position and becomes marked and isolated as if tainted with the seven deadly sins.

I may admit that she is good-natured, fascinating, pretty; as for beauty, notwithstanding that the artists find it in her, I cannot seeV her with their eyes. Be her merits what they may, so long as she is a professed model, a public model, getting her daily bread by exposing herself half-draped, wholly-draped, or altogether in the nude,- she is not a person to be seen with publicly or made the guest of your home. Receive her in your studio, or bestow your civilities in private, but do not provoke others to malicious remarks on the license of your conduct." "'Poor Agnese! It would break her heart to hear your sweeping denunciation. If she be pure and true, as I believe, uncorrupt in thought as in action, living the life she does without consciousness of the evil imputed to it, striving thus to serve her father, and grateful that she is able to serve art also- for she is art's true child--I can but hold her worthy my friendship and esteem. Allowing her these qualities, you would not have me so unjust as to withhold the acknowledgment of such feeling when it may serve or give her pleasure. The few hours she passes with me she certainly enjoys, and is thus reconciled to a home with us where everything is cold and dreary compared to her glowing Italy. Society is doubtless right in its requirements. I am but an humble artist, and my friendship -for this girl ,          v   QUEST.         205 cannot be a matter of interest to any but ourselves.

I know what artist life is; the men who use this girl as a model have doubtless elevated spiritual natures, but they are good specimens of the animal man, with flesh and blood instincts, that must have their way. The girl is safe while her father's eye is on her, but opportu- nity may prove her to be at heart what Pope says all women are."  "Agnese is guileless and pure as a child; she knows no evil, thinks no evil; she rejoices, as she said to me, that God made her perfect, that through art she might serve Bim." "Perfect! What vanity! Doubtless she thinks herself equal in beauty to the Venus de Medici. The way the artists go on about her is absurd!

I will go straight to Maud Alexis and learn all I wish to know; meanwhile, don't forget my advice; perhaps on second thought it may prove acceptable." Madame Lamia left Adelaide and sought Maud. She found Alexis in his studio; his wife was absent. Alexis had a natural aversion to natures like Ma- dame Lamia's; he had a peculiar insight into cha- racter, and detected at a glance the weak points, the ruling passion, as well as the good traits controlling those who approached him. He had great power over the minds of others, influencing them by a force of will which they felt but could not explain. Whilst Madame Lamia detailed her interview with Adelaide, the advice she had given regarding the Italian- girl, and how. it was received, she was made particularly uncomfortable by the keen, fixed look Alexis sent into her eyes; it seemed to read her to the heart's core. A moment's silence; he looked at her still with. out speaking,   QUEST.         207 "Why do you stare at me so? I hate your eyes. Of what are you thinking?" she said.

She is beautiful, rarely, exquisitely beautiful, for all that curl of the lip, Madame; this beauty she devotes to art, and for this she foregoes all recreation, all selfish pleasure.

Altho  ugh living in the studio building, Madame Lamia was not an artist. She had rooms there for the sale of lithographs and prints from her husband's works, who had been during his life an artist of celebrity and genius. He had married her when his fame was established, raising her from poverty and obscurity, to luxury and an enviable position in the world. So great was his love for her that he put her face in every picture he painted, till his brother artists complained of it as a mannerism. As the years went by and the real nature of his wife developed itself; as the cold, seiffsh, cruel treacherous heart tortured and stung him day by day; as children were born who awakened no ten- derness in the breast that refused them nourishment, no love in the mother-heart unsoftened by nature's instincts-he changed his style of painting. Strong, fierce passions he portrayed with terrible earnest- ness; his pictures startled, terrified, yet fascinated the beholder. Still everywhere was the same face he had painted in his early marriage days-only it had changed from the angel to the demon. The gentle, sensitive nature of the artist changed also; tIe became moody, despairing, restless, and ill-tem- pered. Two children, the only survivors of five, were suddenly taken ill with scarlet fever and died; then,  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7529-00000105"/> QUEST. as if unable longer to struggle with the dragon fate, he took his own life, leaving his wife to battle alone with the world she had loved better than husband or children. It will be seen that there were not wanting, in the studio-life Adelaide led, characters to interest or occupations to engross her mind; yet the weeks went slowly by as she awaited tidings from Ralph. It seemed all the mo"   t seemed all the more tedious, this watching and waiting, as she had been faithful to her promise, and every night before sleeping had recorded the day's events. Writing so constantly made her yearn for some answering tone to thrill through the silence, some sign of that life so mysteriously united with her own that should dispel the gloom of absence. Thus she numbered five weeks, when one evening Cecil Welles visited her for the first time since Ralph's departure. tHe brought the letter for which she waited; placing it in her hands, he requested permission to return after visiting a friend in te neighborhood. When he came back, she welcomed him with a radiant face and with a voice tremulous in excess of happiness; she told him of alp's safe arrival, of his speedy, prosperous voyage, the inva- lids improved condition, and their i 'mediate de- parture for France. While she was thus detailing the news of the let. ter, listening to his comments, and apparently absorbed in the conversation, through her heart was   QUEST.         Zll rushing a stream of joy; through her brain were passing and repassing words of tenderness, trust, and hope-words eager, passionate, keen, that shot through her like a tongue of flame, and made the voice by her side seem far, far away. Cecil Welles was too discreet to linger long, and Adelaide was grateful for the tact he evinced in leaving her to commune in solitude, with the golden silence unbroken save by the pulses of her own heart. Very pure and deep was the joy of this commu- nion by letters, which continued as the weeks went on, enabling thought, like rays of light, to traverse immeasurable distances, guide the one back to the other, and unite both, whatever wastes stretched far between. How precious the words, once passed from lip to lip, dissolving into air with the tone which gave them utterance, now recorded, tangible to the eye, repeated with an exquisite .cadence- to the ear, increasing in force and depth of meaning as oft as interpreted by the answering heart! Only they who have loved and been parted can appreciate the gracious boon of letters, or rightly estimate their effect on the life. With these letters Cecil Welles's visits became frequent; not only was he a welcome guest, but in Adelaide's society he knew an enjoyment which he had denied to himself through -years of study and toil, whilst struggling to reach those who seemed far  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7529-00000106"/> 212         QUEST.- before him in the career of life, and win for himself a name that shouldgive him the right not to stand on their level, but beyond. The profession he had chosen, he liked for the power it gave him; better still perhaps for his suc- cess; although he could not forget what weary, despairing days those were when the toil contracting his heart was bitter, and even with the attainment of its rewards, what unsatisfying phantoms they seemed ever pointing back as if to mock the past I United with stern will and courage to force a way up the- rugged paths of life, he had a nature sensi- tive to truth and beauty; he was self-forgetful and noble in his homage to genius; he had enriched his mind- with the thoughts and creations of mighty intellects; had gathered thus the golden fruits of wisdom,' and  refreshed himself therewith by the dusty wayside. In his heart lived the melodies of many poets; all nature's voices were familiar and sweet to his ear, and his hopes ever- led' him to a bieathing-place in life, when toil, care, and ambition should be cast to the winds, and his days be given up to rest and quiet, with the great mother-heart answering back his own. Finding in Adelaide a mind to comprehend that inner life so seldom unmasked to the world, he sought her that he might lay aside the weary burden of daily toil shake of the worldly weights, and unfold :to: her the deeper sentiments and higher ,    QUEST.        213 aspirations of his heart. Her sympathy and appre- ciation of his superiority lessened the distance be- tween them; she could follow him through the com plex windings of thought, and grasp his conceptions, even though she had attained but the rudiments of knowledge as compared with him. Many were the books he brought to her, some requiring study and reflection, in which he gave her aid. He made translations for her from .German authors whose writings she but vaguely compre- hended, and- gradually unfolded to her mind a new world of beauty and delight. One evening lie came to her bringing two books -the one quite new, with leaves uncut, the other bearing marks of much use and frequent reading. Which shall I read from to-night?" he asked. "That which I can best comprehend," she replied. "Through the heart or the brain!" "Well, woman-like, I feel most and understand best through the heart?"  "Then I will open Tennyson's Princess. It is just from the press, and I am eager to refresh my- self again with his melodious singing. Like wine, his rich, glowing fancy, poured with lavish hand, cheers and lightens the heart." He cut the leaves and read the prologue; then dipped into the story, pausing often as he read, to fix the rare beauteous visions floating up from the page. With low, melodious voice, he swept the story on  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7529-00000107"/> 214            QUEST. through many windings, .till "danger rushed       in  and the trump of war aroused- "a hubbub in the court of half the maids Gathered together; from the illumined hall Long lanes ofXsplendor slanted-o'er a press Of sunny shoulders, thick as herded ewes, And rainbow robes, and gems and gem-like eyes And gold, and golden heads."* Here lady Psyche is parted from       her child by violence. Cecil Welles's voice faltered      as  the  mother's anguish passed through his lips in these words: "Ah me, my babe, my blossom, ah my child, My one sweet child, whom I shall see no morel For now will cruel Ida keep her back; And either she will die from want of care, Or sicken with ill-usage when they say : The child is hers-for every little fault, The child is hers-and they will beat my girl, Resembling her mother; oh, my flower I Ori they will take her, they will make her hard, And she will pass me by in after-life With some cold reverence worse than were she dead." *      *   *   *N   *   * "Oh what might that man not deserve of me Who gave me back my child?" "Be comforted," Said CyriL "You shall have it," With the last line the faltering voice grew strong Cecil looked up-Adelaide was weeping.

QUEST.        215 "Read on; read on; let me hear if he fulfilled his promise," she said, in a strange, low voice. He continued, following the battle which the Princess watched from her palace walls with the child in her arms; then the hymn of victory, "Our enemies have fallen," rings from her lips, and she descends to the battle-ground. Here first breaks up her pride ; here melts her noble heart ; here, touched by nature's pleadings, she gives up the child, and Psyche springs to meet and hide it in her bosom. Adelaide did not speak; she looked the mother's joy, and Cecil Welles read on to the end; read to the vision of the imperious, wilful Ida kneeling in strange humility before her lover, to find-peace for her rest- less soul and pardon in his words: "Lay thy sweet hands in mine, and trust to me." "Exquisitely finished, and skilfully managed; a gem, is it not!" asked Cecil Welles as he closed the book. "It is, indeed; the songs interspersed are like gushes of purest melody; as you read, 'Tears,'idle tears,' I seemed to hear strains of music accompany- ing your voice. Will you read it again? "Willingly; and if your ear retains the subtle accompaniment, you must give it back in tones I can comprehend." He read the verses, then Adelaide seated herself at the piano and improvised in minor key a plain- tive, sustained melody on the lower notes of the  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7529-00000108"/> 216         QUEST.. scale which so concentrate the passion and pathos of sounds. Her full, vibrating, appealing voice took up the 'words, giving the intense feeling of the poet; and across the measured bars, in audible distinctness, was heard thie beating of-her own: heart. "I could almost claim that song as mine, soaring into life as it does from the inspiration of the hour. Will you write it out for me?" "Most gladly," replied Adelaide, "d if it does not fade from my memory. Strange though it seem, so delicate and impalpable are the creations of tone, they must be seized and impressed at once on the mind if they are to live. I have sometimes thought the musician's greatest torment must be this inability to retain one-half the glorious creationp which flit through his brain in moments of deep feeling." "It is the bitter, humiliating lesson every aspir- ing soul must learn-the daily lesson of a lifetime. Had I opened this other book, which bears the marks of frequent study, it would have unfolded to you how, centuries ago,.brave, earnest minds struggled amidst darkness to retain the fleeting impressions of truth received by the far-reaching soul. Whenever I am disheartened ad desponding, a voice steals to me from these pages that never fails to urge me -on with fresh courage.

As a general thing, the remaining dia- logues will bewilder and fatigue you, requiring as they do the abstract thought and close attention of the scholar." When he was gone Adelaide again took up the poem, and abandoned herself to the delight that became deeper and more intense as her eye slowly traversed the page, feasting on every perfect scene, till " the voice of living beings, and woven hymns of night and day, and the deep heart of man," stole weird-like on the midnight's solemn silence, and, from dim shadows creeping up the room, flitted the bright visions of the poet's thought. "I would rather be a poet than a painter," she said, as she closed the book. Shortly after this, Pacini, who was a musician, invited Adelaide, with his daughter Agnese, to an evening rehearsal of Mozart's Twelfth WMass in the Cathedral. Cecil Welles joined them. It was a rehearsal with full orchestra of instru- ments, the organ, and a choir of a hundred voices. The only lights were in theprgan gallery, which nmade the obscurity of the vast interior the more awful and profound. Nave and transept, side-aisles and chapels, grand clustered columns, lofty, aspiring arches, groined roof, heavy carvings, rich foliated 10  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7529-00000109"/> 218         QUEST. tracery, and gorgeous gem-hued windows were en- folded: in impenetrable darkness. - "Let us go, downe into the nave," said Adelaide, as they stood amongst the singers who were gather- ing for the rehearsal; " we shall hear and feel the music there; if we stay here we shall be over- whelmed. by the volume of sound." "My very thought," said Cecil Welles;"I can imagine nothing more solemn and grand than being swallowed up in the darkness with the whole soul surrendered to music. Allons y." "Fallons pas! Fallons pas je vous en prie chere Madame, j'auxaabien peur i bas!" . said Agnese, clinging to Adelaide's arm. "Je sais-tu pas, chere enfant, que les Anges du bon Dieu veillent ici nuit et jour, et que tu n'as rien a craindre " was the reply. They went -below and were lost in the mysterious shadows. -The whisperings of the voices above, the discord, of .according instruments, came down to them faintly, and dissolved in the impenetrable gloom. Presently silence fell everywhere, then a breeze-like murmur swept from the stringed instru- ments, deepening to awaken horns and oboes, and blend with the response gushing out from the unison of the :orchestra; here in rolled :the organ's voice with a full burst: of tone, -spreading, circling, aspir- ing: to the vast dome, where it clung. anid vibrated through the measures of the diminishing harmony   QUEST,         219 which died away into broken chords, sobs and sighs; a momentary lull, then soft and low broke the deep bass voices with the yr4 Ekeis8o; the alto and tre- bles following, floated the strain over the complex harmonies of the instruments, and passing through the solemn minor, again stole forth with passionate, sweetness to blend in subdued choral unison. Exulting and jubilant the Glorta soared upwards, gradually gathering in: depth and power, till the full force of the musicians, concentrated in the grand' crescendo, reached its climax, and the ecstasy of joy thrilled through every measure. Melody on melody, interwoven with :exquisite imagery, flashed-up like streams of light from the orchestra to heighten the grandeur of the choral, and, gradually changing into harmonic combinations, the movement closed in one wild burst of rapture, The solemn Mriserere fell with the hush of prayer and supplication after the G loria, enhancing the effect of the voices of praise in the succeeding move- ments, which ushered in the unsurpassable, unap- proachable Et Inwarnatus JEst; here the pure me- lody of the tenor .voice kept its way over the sad, wild surges of tone flowing through the choral in the Crucims, and mingled at last in a cadence of deep, strange beauty, uniting each subtle part in one com- plete expression of ineffable fervor and solemnity. The soothing, earnest{ BnediCt, the pathetic, imploring Agnus De, led up to the majestic Dona  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7529-00000110"/> 220         QUEST. N obs, in which all the light and shade of expression, the passionate fervor and soul of the whole Mass was repeated, concentrated, and poured forth in a blaze of iimagined splendor. The last notes died away; the momentary lull in which the soul took refuge was broken by the chat- tering voices of the singers; then old Pacini was heard calling for Agnese to join him. "J'entends mon pere qui nous appelle, chore Madame, il faut partir." "Yes, we must go," said Adelaide, reluctantly. Cecil Welles guided them through the darkness till they passed the massive portals of the cathedral and stood without under the starry heavens. They gave no expression to thought in words; the mys- tery and ineffable beauty of the music held them in its spell, absorbing alike soul and sense. When Cecil Welles next visited the cottage he placed in Adelaide's hands two exquisitely bound volumes, saying: " I have brought you two of my favorite Greek poets as companions. If you like, we will read and compare them together." "AEschylus and Sophocles! How  kind, how thoroughly kind in you, to bring them to me! Let us read Prometheus; it served Shelley as a model for his superb poem, and I have long wished to study it closely." "Very well, we will begin with Prometheus. Fairly to compare the two poets we should, then, F   r  to  colpare    QUEST.         221 read the (Edipus Tyrannus, or Colonceus of Sopho- cles; but you will like his Electra best, therefore we will read it to-night." He opened to "Prometheus" where Strength, Force, and Vulcan lead the unresisting god through pathless wilds to the savage rock and bind him with indissoluble chains; and as he read, led Adelaide into an enchanted realm, where she listened to the grave conference of departed heroes; wandered side by side with the fair, stately daughters of Greece; felt the air stirred by the presence of deities holding the destinies of mortals; caught the unearthly chaunt of the Furies as they passed on rushing wing; or, ascending to Olympus, heard the awful voices of the gods, and exulted in the solemn choral harmo- nies welling up in pure unbroken tone, to pass away, yet echo with all music through her soul for evermore. With the concluding scene of Electra, Adelaide swept her hands over the key board and commenced Beethoven's sonata, opus tenth, in C moll. "I heard this music through all those last-verses; let me play it for you," she said; and in the music of that divine one who translated to earth the language of heaven, they closed the evening hours. As the winter days deepened, and the long nights set in with early twilight, many were the hours of relief and solace Cecil Welles had, and great was the happiness he brought to the little cottage where the  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7529-00000111"/> 222   ,     QUEST. ruddy flames glowed from the log-piled hearth to greet him. If he came wearied and exhausted from the day's struggle^, a ssometimes happened, Adelaide would seat herself at the piaio and give him m"usic most soothing and caressing to the heart, or sing low sweet melodies that hushed the'demon of: care and unrest eating away his life. Often he would say to her: "When I come here, it- is like a glimpse of heaven, if heaven be rest for body and soul. I do not permit myself to think how fleeting this enjoy- ment may be; I shall have rtihme enough to look back into Hades when the golden -gates close against me and I stand without-alone." It was thus he conveyed to Adelaide the -impres- sion that the time' lie gave her was not lost for him, as she had fear;ed; he was so- immeasurably her superior, and had so exalted her mind throu gh his companionshilp, that in hei gratitude she fain would enter into his life, to harmonize the conflicting influences which so tortured his spirit, that, even though his head was crowned "with sunbeams, his heart was shrouded in deepest 'gloom. EHow much she absorbed his time, how entirely he surrendered to her his thought, how he received her into his'very life, shbe' might have known from the eagerness with' which he clung to, the transient delight her presence yielded him; but the secrets of his soth were' never revealed to her.  ,             .  A      .   QUEST.         223 In his leisure momenta he had translated for her Heinrich von Ofterdingen from Novalis; he took it to her one evening and iread it aloud. Did she dream, as his voice grew tremulous iwhere the young poet meets with the mysterious flower he has sought through endless wanderings and finds deep down in its blue cup the face of his beloved, that her face looked up from that same poet's flower lying on his heart, and had been the inspiration of maey an hour's endeavor?     . Far from her mind was such, a thought. How startled would she have been had she known .his 'dream, as, continuing the story, he read the passage where Heinrich, having passed through death with Matilda, sees the blue waves of the river flowing softly above them, and awakens to the blissful con- sciousness that they are, united for -ever, with the secrets of eternal wisdom unveiled for them! Cecil Welles's dream,:-as he read, was of that, other life where enfranchised spirits meet without the veils of "flesh, and rush together guided unerringly by per- fect perception dawning with the light of eternity. Adelaide thought only of the story, which, for ori- ginality and exquisite imagery, she found not excelled even in the "Thoughts " and "Hymns of Night" by the same writer. A few years before, his death, Mr. de Rennville had purchased some land in Arkansas, then in a wild  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7529-00000112"/> 224         QUEST. state and deemed of little value. Mrs. de Rennville had scarce given a thought to this property, and never had examined into the title-deeds to learn the boundaries of the land. One evening Cecil Welles mentioned a trouble- some case he had, where a client, owning property in uncultivated western lands, had discovered settlers or " squatters," as they are termed, established with- in his territory, to which they laid claim by right of possession during a number of years. This circumstance led Mrs. de Rennville to speak to him of her husband's purchase; the papers were examined, and the land found to border on Little Rock, a city which had sprung up within a few years, and gave promise of great commercial pros- perity. Cecil Welles advised sending a trusty agent at once to look after the property and prove the claim to it; there was little doubt it had a value, even though it might not be available for years. With all his various occupations and duties, his efforts to discover Adelaide's child were unabated. A person had been sent to Fayal to ascertain, if pos- sible, in what direction Robert Mandevil had departed on leaving the island. A conviction that the child was- in the country, and probably in one of the Northern States, induced Cecil Welles to employ in the differ- ent cities trusty agents, whose time was wholly engrossed in tracing persons and events apparently   QUEST.         225 buried in oblivion by circumstance, treachery, or 'guilt. Frequent letters arrived from his cousin in Nlew York, who had so far cultivated Miss Mande- vil's society as to be intimately acquainted with the details of her life. It was evident she knew nothing of her brother's residence in Fayal, or of his connec- tion at that time with the woman she hated so bit- terly; she was eager as ever to obtain a clue' to the hiding-place of his child; her exertions for this end were unremitting. Whatever misgivings Cecil Welles had as to his own success, he never permitted himself to speak despondingly when questioned by Adelaide; he encouraged her hopes, and sustained her trust in him by proving that he neglected nothing whichi might aid them. Adelaide visited Mrs. Travis frequently after Ralph's depariture, and was so affectionately wel- comed that she, came at last to spend much time with her. By every letter received from the travel- lers, it was evident Henry Travis was improving, and before winter was over he had himself written to his mother, expressing a hope that he should be able to return to her in the summer. His physician had advised him to try the baths of Aix-la-Chapelle, which, used in the spring and early summer, were more efficacious than during the cold season; after which it was hoped he might be restored to health.

To her studio came also every day Agnese Pacini, as yet unchanged by the admiration her beauty drew from the artists, who proved by- their efforts to secure her time how great was the value they placed on her- services. As every evil feeling develops in a bad nature, so hada Madaame Lmia's dislike to Agnese striength- ened till it became hatred. The black spot on her own soul made her incredulous of virtue in others; she thought if she could prove the girl cor- rupt there would be an end to her retaining the position she held:in the artist-world. 'The web she had been weaving to ensnare the poor child was ready;, she would use it and show no mercy. Madame: Lamia's intimate friend was an amateur artist nanmed- Chase, who had a stutdio in the build- ing, where he Amused himself:by using up colors and canvas;; he had wealth and leisure, was devoted to pleasure, and':led a somewhat dissolute life, andreas may be supposed his name was niot free from :scandal:': His efforts to be recognised as an artist at the Sketch Club had failed, yet he still   QUEST.         227 retained his studio, and led what he was pleased to term an art-life. He had an easel in his friend's room, where he made studies from her husband's works. One morning Madame Lamia asked Pacini to let his daughter sit for the hands in a picture Chase was finishing. Her request was granted, and, as she was to be present during the sitting, the old man did not accompany Agnese. The sitting was hardly begun when Madame Lamia made an excuse to leave the room, saying she would return immediately; Chase closed the door with the bolt as she departed. Soon after Agnese had left her father's studio, Reeves went to consult the Italian regarding a drawing he had made, and to compare it with the model; he lingered to listen to the old man's criti- cisms, and, as they disagreed, it was decided they should seek the girl. Knocking several times at Madame Lamia's door, and, receiving no reply, they were turning away, when Reeves thought he heard a low moan, as from one in pain; and pausing to listen intently, another sound, as of one struggling, and a suppressed cry, was distinct to both. "There is something wrong," he- said to the.' Ita- lian; " we must enter this room through mine;" and hurrying, into his studio, the old man following, he opened a door, concealed on the other side by a large wardrobe, which he pushed aside.  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7529-00000114"/> 228        QUEST. As they appeared, Chase released the girl, whose cries he had stifled by a cloth held over her face, and made an effort to reach the door leading to Madame Lamia's private apartment; but Reeves bounded towards him. Scoundrel I You shall not escape us!" he ex- claimed, seizing him with a firm grasp, and holding him, notwithstanding the desperate struggles he made to get free.  The Italian bent over his daughter, who had fallen to the floor insensible; he put aside the heavy masses of hair that were tangled and knotted about her throat, and rubbed her hands, calling her in his own language by every endearing term to awaken. "Throw open the door; give her air. Call some one to help us," said Reeves. "Let me but show up this knave, and he will never again darken this place with his presence." The old man opened the door and called aloud; several artists came in haste; a few words from Reeves explained the extraordinary scene before them. They would have torn Chase into atoms, but Reeves said: "Let us cowhide him, then kick him down stairs into the street like a dog; broken bones and a bruised skin will serve to remind him of this day's work." , The wretched man was led to his punishment;   QUEST.         229 mangled, torn, bruised, unable to move, drawing his breath in agony, he found himself lying in the street, more dead than alive when it was over. Madame Lamia heard the disturbance; unper- ceived, she left the building by a private exit, and was beside Chase as the passers-by began to gather about him. She called a carriage, had him lifted into it, and requested a man in the crowd to accompany him home. She then returned to her studio. The artists were assembled near her door, watching for signs of Agnese's recovery, when Madame Lamia appeared; they drew back to let her pass, as if unwilling to come into contact with the hem Jof her garment; her eyes fell before the stern faces that met her gaze with one expression of disgust. 1  She dared not question them, but passed into her room, where Maud, Adelaide, and others were administering to the unfortunate girl. "What has happened? What is the trouble?" she asked, putting on a face of alarm and anxiety. "Oh, you are a devil!" exclaimed the Italian, clutching her arm. "A bad, bad devil to plot the ruin of my girl. You leave her alone with that fiend-and look she is half dead. Go from my sight, I tell you; let me never see again your black, wicked face. You are a serpent, a devil, a monster; go, I say; go " and he shook her in his passion withta violence that took away her breath.  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7529-00000115"/> 230         QUEST. ;When he released her she was unable to speak from mortification -and anger as well ad exhaustion; but, recovering herself, she protested she knew no- thing of what had occurred.,. She had left the room foyr a mident, but was detained, and could. not hold herself responsible for the girl's folly. -What she said was unheeded, for the women in the room never once turnedtowards her, and the old man knelt beside his child, who gave signs of returning consciousness. "Are we in our room, our own room " she said, faintly, looking from her father to Maud, who was leaning over her. ( Not yet, chrie; you shall go when your strength is restored." "Let us go, padre mio; not here; let me not stay here," she said, looking about with a troubled face. Her-father lifted her tenderly and took her away. That night they were guests at the cottage, where they remained several days, much to the satisfaction of Mrs. de Rennville and Adelaide. Madame: Lamia endeavored to retain her position amongst the artists, appearing unconscious of averted looks, and closed doors; not that she was wholly without friends, who tried to make it appear that she was abused and ill-treated; but4;he cared more for popularity than the good .will of a few individuals; arnd: finding her: life dull and lonely, she suddenly disappeared, nor was she heard of again till a year   QUEST.         231 had elapsed, and her debut was announced on the boards of a questionable theatre in, a distant city. ) It was not long before Agnese recovered her cheerfulness and vivacity, but though she ,clung with more tenderness to Maud and Adelaide, she was not willing as formerly to sit for the artists. iter father had met with success, and needed no longer her aid; he therefore permitted- her to have her way, gladly keeping her beside him in work hours, when she would sing or read to him, or occupy herself with something intended for his com- fort. Adelaide had steadily pursued her art, hoping, as she had told Ralph, to secure thereby a comfortable independence for her mother. She had been fortu- nate in her patrons, receiving more, orders than she could fill without encroaching on the hours she had promised to reserve for recreation; many persons were. attracted to her studio through curiosity, know- ing the relations between her and Ralph; some who thus sought her appreciated and availed themselves of her talent.  Her desire to serve her mother, and assure her future against the possibility of poverty, was accom- plished, as she least anticipated, when Cecil Welles presented them  with pap ers proving their claim to the Western property, which was found to be of great value in consequence- of a line of railroad that had been laid over a  part of the land. As it was  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7529-00000116"/> 232        QUEST. salable and in demand, it was thought advisable to dispose of the property immediately. A land spe- culating mania having inflated the price of real estate, it was a favorable moment for putting it in the market. This was accomplished successfully and without delay. It was during the month of May that Adelaide wrote thus to Ralph: "A year ago, and I had not met you, Ralph; I was old at twenty-three. This day marks the cycle of the years for me. At twenty-four I seem to have ' awakened from the dream, the prelude, the proba- tion, to find myself set clear and safe in new light and life.' "Thank God for this love that has passed like His breath across my soul!-for youth restored, for hope that sings all day, and through night dreams in my heart as in the blest time when I had not known despair. Am I not happy; and how shall I express it, if not to God and thee, beloved? "But let me in my joy be humble, and believe it to be for some great good in you I am thus blest; and that as you have chosen to write your name upon my -forehead, on my heart, and through my 'ife, sanctifying it by: your great love, so I am deemed not altogether unworthy to sit beside you, growing day by day more white and pure as your looks shine down upon me.   QUEST.        233 "Looking back, it seems impossible that I could have lived without you; almost impossible it seems that time ever was when your face did not meet me everywhere, when your voice made not for me con- tinued melody. And can it be that face and voice so soon again shall greet me. Oh, Ralph! are yon indeed coming! I tress my hand over my heart to sjtill its wild beatings. Coming! I hear the word in every breeze laden with sea-music that sweeps towards me; in every flutter of the young, tender leaves swaying above me; every flower-face looking up into mine from the green earth, breathes that word 'coming!' to my listening ear, and still again I hear it as from your voice afar. Bless you for the hlope it brings! "And shall I await your coming to tell you, or write now, that you will find my studio closed. Will it not rejoice you to learn that I, who have been forced to toil for my daily bread, for which indeed I thank God, am become an heiress? "It is a long story, which I have persuaded Cecil Welles to write down for you ; therefore to his letter, which will leave by. this mail, you must turn for details. 6 Congratulate me, Ralph, for now I may see my dear mother again in the enjoyment of all -she has denied to herself through long years of sorrow; and oh, it is pleasant to be rich; one may give and receive so much enjoyment with the ' silver shilling!'  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7529-00000117"/> 234         QUEST. "Yes, I shall close my studio in a few days; I have waited only to put the last touches to pictures that were promised. 'And now my work of :toil is over; God willing, I will work henceforth for His weary and afflicted ones. We will work together, Ralph." It was a day or two after writing this letter-that Adelaide sat in her studio where Maud was gliding about, sorting and arranging the toys. "You will not have that trouble long, dear," said Adelaide. "You are not going away l' asked Maud quickly. "Not exactly, but my studio life is over; it must break off abruptly now. You, can hardly think, Maud, how the influences that have met me here have pervaded my life and strengthened me for many a bitter day. As I have entered this room closing the door on the world, and seen the sweet child-faces gathering round me breathing the pure atmosphere of their artless innocence-'as I have striven to imitate that which God has made so per- fect-rfailing, yet ever aspiring, I have had consola- tion for much sorrow. "I almost fear to leave this life to go again into the world. I may be very happy, yet never in my deepest joy can I forget this place. There are tears in your eyes; dearest Maud, I shall always love you." -   QUEST.        235 "Oh, Adelaide, how can I let you go! I know it will be best for you, but my heart aches when I think how I shall miss you." "Love me still, Maud; yet take Agnese into your heart, for my sake; watch over her, for she needs your care. I shall send away my pictures; then all that my studio contains is yours; it may:be pleasant to have about you these little mementoes of the hours we have passed together." "How kind, Adelaide; and will you give me your easel and brushes? I should like them best of all; they would seem to have gained something of the life of your busy fingers." "You shall have all, Maud; and now tell me if your husband has made the sketch -for my pic- ture' " "Yes, and it is good. He has sketched you standing by the sea.\ A grey cloak thrown over your shoulders, a sombre sky, with broken masses of clouds as a background, relieved by a bright light at the horizon; towards that light your eyes are turned, and you seem gazing there with all your soul.

"He has gone to .Marshfield for a few days' shoot- ing. Did you hear that his picture of Portia in the trial scene sold to a gentleman in Baltimore for two thousand dollars?" "How delightful! Who will say artists are not appreciated in our country? Oh, Maud, how can I take leave of the artists! I have not the courage to say good-bye, and yet I must find words to express my gratitude for all. the kindness I have received." i' You have not yet told me what I most wish to know, Adelaide.

She had lived quietly and unobtrusively in their midst; had never joined in their social gatherings or festivi- ties, yet her aid had been given when required; and often unsolicited, when she could render a service, she had given substantial proofs of sympathy, filling   QUEST.         237 with warmth and light some dreary, studio which had echoed only the sighs of despondency. The little children she had brought into the som- bre building, with radiant faces, gleeful voices, and pattering footfalls, gliding to and fro like sunbeams, to leave freshness and beauty wherever they lin- gered, had come to be considered by the artists as a part of their own life. When her studio was closed, when she was gone, and the child-faces no longer greeted them, they declared the place was too gloomy and depressing for work like theirs. Years after, when a spacious building was erected for the special convenience of the artists, near that only bit of open ground the city can boast, with the perverseness of human nature that causes the mind to look to the past or future for enjoyment, rather  than to the present, many -who had lived and toiled in the old building would speak of the " good times " there, and wish themselves back in their oll studios, ,    *  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7529-00000119"/>     BOOK V.   &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7529-00000120"/> , "I AM coming, my beautifil bird, My bird with the wild, dark eye; My boat bounds over the waters, 'Tis turned to the northern sky.

"You must let me out at the Albion, Harry; I cannot go home with you, old boy; I shall leave you to take care of'yourself now, and glad am I to rid myself of so troublesome a companion." "That's not fair, Ralph. 1My mother will expect you; half her joy at seeing me will be lost if you - are not there to claim her gratitude.

The warm greetings over, his eye swept round the old familiar room; it was hung with fresh garlands and flowers.

When they had satisfied their hearts by long communing, he told her of his wanderings during months of absence, of the places he had visited, the friends he-had met; then he told her of his cousin's restoration to health and cheerfulness. "You must see Harry," he said; "although shy and reserved with strangers, he will meet you as a  friend, for lhe cherishes the warmest gratitude for your thoughtful attention to his mother.

"Yes, thoroughly, warmly; he has done so much for me, Ralph,; he has brought me such treasures, and given me such gifts, that my life long I cannot thank him as I would. I have often wondered how he could give his precious time to me ; but it has not been wasted, as you will know hereafter." "Hereafter! Look, Adelaide," and in his hand lay a circle of purest gold.

"Then, Adelaide, let there be no delay; let the hour come quickly that shall make you my very own, my wife." When Ralph returned to the city he found Cecil Welles prepared to leave his quarters; this he would not permit. There was room for both, he said; the time they would have to enjoy each other would not be long, for he should return to Europe as soon as Adelaide could make ready for de- parture. Ermine reopened his kitchen, carefully removing, all trace of rust and mould from his casseroles and tins, effacing dust and weather-stains from floor and furniture, and busily prepared himself with, great delight to produce sundry mysterious dishes he had met with abroad, not begotten of inspiration.

"Why, Miss, you 'pears almost as good as Mas'r Stanley hisself.

Her time was occupied with preparations for her departure. Ralph would not have it prolonged; he bade her hasten every day; he had come to fear at last, lest some unforeseen event should rob him of his future. And the days sped swiftly, leaving at length but a few hours before the dawning of that one which should fulfil his wish. Adelaide and her mother stood looking at the mist-like, gossamery, impalpable folds of illusion tulle, showered with orange blooms, and gathered into a bridal robe. "Dearest mother, these are the first August days; it is just a year since we made the black bre'ge dress 1 needed for the seaside." "Yes, darling; and do you remember how reluc- tant you were to go; how I almost forced you to leave me?" "Yes, mother, yes; the nervous dread I had of mixing with the world, the anguish wasting my strength, the dead, heavy weight clinging to my spirits, all held me within myself. Even had I fore- seen him, I should have still resisted the impulse impelling me towards him. I should have stood, gazing, yearning, yet never daring to approach. Oh, mother, he drew me to himself, and God knows if I am worthy!"  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7529-00000126"/> 252        QUEST. "My child, that one thought seems to cling to you despite every assurance that you alone can fill his life. He had all the world to choose from, and he took you." "Mother, mother, who knows what may colne; not through my heart, for its every beat is true to him. Yet with all the bliss of this love entrancing me with its splendor, enfolding me as a spell, filling my soul to the brim with life and rapture, I cannot forget that other life for which I yearn unutterably. I hear her voice -calling me, see her arms reaching imploringly towards me; flesh of my flesh, breath of my breath, I cannot sever myself from her in my thoughts. She may be in misery, in poverty, in pain, desolate and pining for a mother's love. I know not; I cannot ipenetrate this darkness lying as a gulf between us. Oh; mother! will not this wail of sor- row, hidden in the depths of my being, find its way through my lips to poison the joy of him I love? Or, being found, for I will grasp the hope, may not my child bring sorrow and shame to sting his pride and cover me again with grief] Mother, you know if I love him; is it right that I should link my life with his for ever! Rather would I be his slave, his servant, than drag him down to suffer through my errors.  "Adelaide, have you lost your faith in God? Has not your path become smooth, and is not your life a daily blessing . Think you one soul is more   QUEST.         253 precious to Him than another, and will He not do well for all? Oh, child, forget yourself; pray for faith ; hope on, for I believe your prayers will avail." "Oh, mother, say it again!" "Yes, darling, I have such faith that our child will be restored, that I shall still remain here where we have awaited her coming so long. During your absence I may be needed. I know not why, but I feel that whatever of trial and sorrow God has sent to chasten us, it is very nearly over now. We will be patient, dear one.? "My own mother, I go from you feeling, some- how, it lessens my chance of finding her. I go, per- haps, to put a further distance between us; yet I go. Oh, if anything should happen, if at last she should be found here, you will not let me wait, no matter, how, where, or in what guise she come; you will take her into your heart and send for me at once, Hier. Oh, the thought is so filled with joy, it bewilders me! I dare not dwell on it. Must I leave you here alone, quite alone; it seems so sad for you i" "You know, Adelaide, how I shall feel your absence and your loss. Yet your happiness will be my daily joy; it will bring me pleasant musings, and answer me instead of society. I shall have Agnese Pacini often with me, and now that I can indulge in luxury, I shall enjoy the drives I remem- ber so well to have talken with one we love still, ,              ' \  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7529-00000127"/> 254         QUFjT. though the silence is ever unbroken by his voice, and our eyes may not feast themselves with his presence. Years have passed since nature unfolded to me here in all her loveliness. Oh, Adelaide, memories hold us in a spell we would not banish for the- kind voices of the living, when we may hold commurings with the spirits of our departed." "You will watch over Agnese, mother; for my sake guard the dear child; and you will visit the studios and help the artists I have mentioned?" "Yes; and thank God, I may give at last where my own experience of misery tells me aid seldom reaches." The hours sped away, the last preparations were over, the last words said; the day faded and again day dawned; then, up, up through the summer heavens, up and beyond the twisted sunbeams, up and afar past the rush of starry hosts, floated to the listening ear of the recording angel the tones of two voices blended as, one, in solemn vows which united two lives for evermore., Passing out of the holy place where these vows were spoken, Ralph and Adelaide stood hand in hband on the threshold of a new world. ;If speech which is silvern could unfold with mel- low utterance the deep, strange: joy flooding the boundless expanse opening out before them through the vistas of,' earth to the fields of immortality-if it could bring to the dim brain visions of beauty, radi-   QUEST.        255 ant as the morning that met their gaze-if it could ring out the triumphant harmonies woven from all wandering tones, rising exultingly from countless voices rushing to greet them--if it could breathe with music's whispers, soft, measured, low, the unimagined, deep, pure bliss holding them in its spell-if it could sparkle with the wine of life given them to drink in deep draughts, till their blended spirits were oblivi- ous of all the rolling past behind them-had it this power, many a listening heart would echo back the tones. Yet speech is but silvern, whilst "silence is golden." Over the seas they sped, to wander at will in dis- tant lands; they made their home in many cities, an aim and purpose directing their travels, which was the quest of the child, dear alike to both. Strange t were the revelations of misery, crime, and suffering in the records they studied, and the abodes they visi- ted in the fulfilment of this design. And not with- out good to others was the work pursued, though for themselves they were baffled and disappointed as often as they seemed to get a clue that should guide their search. "It is only hope deferred," Ralph would say, to encourage Adelaide. "We will seek her in every land, and find her at last." In the pomp and pageantry of life they had their part; whatever of good society could yield, they extracted it; whatever of evil, they heeded it not. i;  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7529-00000128"/> 256         QUEST. The treasures of art, the marvels of science, the landmarks of centuries past, they studied together, making themselves familiar with places that marked events in the history of nations, or attested the fierce, uncontrolled passions of men. And when they were weary of man's work and man's thought, they turned to nature. She changed her skies to wear new smiles for their upturned faces; she met them everywhere with new forms, clothed in ever varying tints and colors; never did light and shade gather and disperse but to return in new lines of beauty. In deep symphonies, rising wave on wave of sound from earth to the singing stars, were her teachings uttered; and tone-language, to them no mystery, revealed day by day the wonders of a world through which they saw the spiritual counterpart beyond! As weeks and months glide on, deepening their happiness in each other with the- ebb and flow of time, we will leave them to look again on other, familiar faces. The months which had yielded to Ralph and Ade- laide untold delights, passed slowly and dragged on wearily for Cecil Welles.  He gave his time to the increasing demands of hisiprofession, and worked patiently for others, not thinking of renown or popu- lar applause. He cared not for the press of men aroiund him, or the vulgar praise that blew his fame   QUEST.        257 from lip to lip; he had reached the goal of his early ambition, was lifted far above his fellow-workers, to feel desolate and alone. There was an aching void in that noble heart, no striving, no toil could satisfy. One evening as he was occupied with law-papers he was interrupted by a visit from Mr. Teesdale, who exclaimed, on entering the room: "I must come now and then to the old place, if only to bring Stanley more vividly to mind." ' You are, of all men, most welcome; you can aid me in a matter I have been perplexed with during the last hour. I am heartily glad to see you." "I am at your service, Welles, and in a very cheerful mood, as I have pocketed ten thousand to- day." "Honestly, Teetdale .. "Yes, I think I can say honestly, although in mat-' ters of trade one can't always carry a clean con- science. But what can I do for you, Welles?" "You have friends in Montreal, I think. Can you put me in communication with any one there thoroughly read in the English and French law? A reliable and intelligent man; a Canadian born and bred 2" "D'Israeli is the very man you need; he has held eveLy position one can attain at the bar; hat been Queen's counsel, is on the Supreme bench, and has written numberless volumes on the French code.

Le Coeur being on intimate terms with him, I could easily arrange to bring you into communica- 6 tion. Do you go to Montreal?" "The very thing I most wish to avoid; but to do the work thoroughly I cannot hope to save myself trouble and annoyance. Here is a client of mine who lays claim to an extensive Seigniory in Canada  East, near St. Hyacinth. There is no doubt but his claim is just, yet the case is so involved and intricate, has so many weak points where it may be assailed and contested, that I confess to having doubts if he can recover the property." "Did you ever lose a case, Welles?" "Yes; not one, but many." '"And how long since, may I ask?" "Years ago, I am glad to say, when I had more reverence for other ininds and less confidence in mny- self."    i "Your client is safe. You know people say that  " "Pardon me, Teesdale, I do not care for what peo- ple say. Can you give me a letter to yourfriend Le Coeur 2" "With pleasure; but I thought you knew Le Coeur; I thought every one knew him; he is well- remembered here as having chosen one of our most brilliant belles for his wife. I know I lost my heart to her the first time I saw her. She was a perfect Juno.. Then her sister who iwas spirited away into   QUEST.        259 the same isolated region, what a Hebe she was! Jove what goddesses walked the earth in those days; there are only women left! Do you know this is just the season for visiting Montreal? I have half a mind to join you." "Do so by all means, Teesdale, if you can find pleasure in going into a region where mountains of snow and ice greet you on every side, and the atmo- sphere, no longer an aeriform fluid, is condensedto frozen vapor which chills to the vitals. I confess a trip to Cuba this dreary winter time would be more congenial to my taste." "Take plenty of wrappers with you and you'll never mind the atmosphere; only a fool or a poor man need feel the cold. I will join you, if only to make you confess to finding the climate agree- able. You will be warmly received by my friend Le Coeur, who has the best house, the best wife, the best horses, the best wines, the best friends, and is the best society 'in the world. When shall we start?" "To-morrow is Friday, and as the day always brings me good luck, we will set off in the morning, if you like.,' "Agreed." "And to the success of our journey we'll drink a bottle of this golden Steinberger wine Stanley has just sent me." "Agreed tgrain. A glorious old boy is Stanley, aa  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7529-00000130"/> 260 -        QUEST. and glorious old wine is this; its bouquet floats like a cloud of incense through the room. No wonder the Germans are rhapsodical, dreamy, and mystic, with the Rhine and Moselle wines glowing and sparkling in their blood." "Then you don't think, Teesdale, our Catawha, Isabella, or even the California nectar, could bring about such a result in the character of the restless, impulsive, impressible;- gold-getting, gold-loving Yankee?" "God forbid! Strong, active, vigorous life is the self-sustaining force of a nation. Our time for dream- ing will not come for centuries yet. When it comes we shall have no future; the past alone will shape our dream. But if I am to join you to-morrow let nme not stay longer sipping golden bubbles wlhilst the sands of time fall away from under my feet. I must be off. Good night." "Make every preparation for being blocked by snow-drifts on the way, Teesdale. I shall lay in a stock of provisions; you may furnish fur robes and any available comforts for the outer man your prac- tical mind can suggest. Good-night."    i Notwithstanding the extreme" cold, and the vast accumulations of snow on the road, for it was Feb- ruary, the journey was performed withl ease, and without inconvenience to the travellers. Arriving at St. Lambert's, they crossed the mighty St. Law- rence, congealed into a frigid bed of ice and snow,   QUEST.,        261 in open sleighs, and realized the full bitterness of the wintery blast.' "What heathens these people are to use open sleighs at this season of the year," said Cecil Welles, enveloping his head in a buffalo robe. "Do you think you could drive in a comfortable, covered Brougham on runners, here as at home, mon ami . If so, you are mistaken: You would be upset in such a turnout'at every rod, going over these ruts and car-holes. I can assure you an hour's drive over these roads in such a conveyance would reconcile you to open sleighs, and convince you that these people are far from being savage in their customs." "How can you talk in this atmosphere? My lips are frozen together." They soon arrived within the warm precincts of St. Lawrence Hall; and, beside a cheerful, blazing fire, with a good dinner and a flask of rare old wine, found relief for all weariness. The next morning they went in search of Mr. Le Coeur. "We shall not find Le oeur at his office for an hour yet," said Teesdale. "Let us stroll about and see the town." As they reached the Cathedral they fell in with the crowd just leaving froim morning Mass. "Three-fourths of these worshippers are women; did it ever strike you, Teesdale, in what meagre  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7529-00000131"/> 262        QUEST. proportion men make up the number of converts to' the Christian doctrines?" "Never thought much about it; but it is natural enough, for women never reason out a thought ; they accept religion because it appeals to their sentiment. A man receives impressiorns through the brain; he reasons and argues on them long before he permits inferences and deductions drawn from them to influ- ence his life. 'Women are credulous; men are sceptics; one always expects women to look after religion and church matters, you know." "Yes; every man wishes his children trained morally, if not religiously, and looks to his wife for the performance of this no easy duty, unmindful of the influence he exerts over the undeveloped minds guided more readily by example than precept.' "Cease preaching, Welles, and look at these rosy faces snugly enfolded in fur bonnets, passing us by with shy, glancing eyes." "I'm thinking the glow of health which adds so much to these same faces, would fade very quickly if the women here were clad in garments as unsuited to the climate ;as those adopted by our women ; these heavy woollen garments edged with fur, the short skirts that cannot drag the snow about the ancle, the woollen gloves and fur mufflers,: have much to do with the rosy faces and brilliant eyes." "Look at yonder sledge, Welles, heaped with white balls; what should you say they were?"    QUEST.         263 "Very decidedly snow-balls, rather neatly finish ed off, as our boys would say." "Milk, my friend ; milk in packages, sold by the piece, as in France they sell bread by the yard. Look again at those magnificent sleighs just driving from the Cathedral, covered and lined' outside- and in with superb furs; the robe trailing over the back till it sweeps the snow, is as beautiful an addition as one would wish to see." - "Very comfortable, Teesdale, especially when one is half stiffened with cold. Let us walk faster."' They visited the shops in Notre Dame street, and lingered at the farrier's, where Mr. Teesdale made himself smart by the) purchase: of a sable cap' and wide paletot with. sable trimmings. Then they passed on to Benjamin's, the Stewart of Montreal, where they laid in a stock of English made woollens, durable, comfortable,: and unlike, any other manu- facture of the same fabric to be met with. Their walk terminated at length in Mr. Le Caeur's office, ) who received them with hearty welcome. Mr. Teesdale explained the object of their visit. "D'Israeli is the man you should consult,"s he said, turning to Cecil Welles; " he is beyond question the most able and learned of all our counsellors; he has gone to St. Hilaire for the day; but :dines with me this evening, when I hope you will do me the pleasure to meet him. Meantime if you will drive up to lunch with me, Mrs. Le Cour will fake you to  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7529-00000132"/> 264        QUEST- the skating Rink, where I dare say my friend Tees dale will find attractions and amusement." "Certainly; let us go up to lunch by all means, and pay our respects to Mrs. Le Coeur.  Ah! Welles, my dear fellow, should we look in at the skating Rink, I advise you to guard your heart with a double shield of indifference; it will be in danger." The skating Rink was a one-story building, three hundred feet long by two hundred feet in width, the ground of which was excavated to the depth of three feet and filled with water; when frozen solid, the surface was planed smooth for the skaters. A platform on a level -with the ice surrounded the interior of the building, and there were galleries above where guests might be seated comfortably. Rooms well heated, with servants in attendance at the entrance, served the skaters for change of cos- tume and place of rest and refreshment. When Mrs. Le Coeur arrived at the Rink with her guests, the skaters were already assembled. A band of thirty pieces was performing the-most seducing of Strauss's waltzes. Thegorgeous uniform of the officers of the Guards, then garrisoned in the town, blended with the costume of the young girls and fair women, who knew well the witching effect of the close-fitting polka jacket, the skirt looped up over a brilliant petticoat, the fur-edged Polish boot, scarlet stockings, and jaunty round cap, with supple, waving plume. As they glanced to and fro, swayed by the music, or;   z:          QUEST.  .      26 swept round the Rink in swift evolutions scarce to be followed by the eye, the scene seemed as unreal as the enchantments unfolded in Arabian tales. "The very poetry of motion; dancing is weari- ness in comparison!" exclaimed Cecil Welles. "But what are they doing now?" asked Teesdale of Mrs. Le Coeur. "They seem grouped in sin- gular confusion." "They are about to form into cotillions," was the reply. "A dance on skates! that is indeed a novelty; it will give me a chance to criticise the skaters, and enable me to recover from the bewilderment into which such a myriad of bright eyes and twinkling feet has plunged me; it mpust be an awkward thing to do, though." The band pealed forth, the dance commenced. Every movement and figure was performed with wonderful dexterity and surpassing grace, the dan- cers being as much at ease on their skates as when gliding over the yielding floor of a ball room. When the dance was over, the music changed to a waltz, and every couple moved slowly away to the voluptuous measure. "If I had btrt a pair of skates!" exclaimed Mr. Teesdale; "I fairly ache and tingle to jpin in that waltz." "I can readily procure the skates for you, and ,    12  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7529-00000133"/> 266.        QUIEST. will present you to any of these young ladies, if it be your pleasure," said Mrs. Le Coeur. "Many thanks, dear Madame; it is hardly worth your trouble, for I perceive these charming young ladies prefer the- society of the gay gallants in scar- let and gold, and scarce deign to cast a gracious glance or word at the civilians. Foolish little beau- ties! why won't they see how they waste their time on these brilliant birds of passage." "You mean to say, Teesdale, that birds of the gayest plumage do not sing the sweetest songs ; now I doubt if either you or I, through much effort, could fascinate or subdue the least wilful or imperious of these fair daughters of Eve as readily as a glance from one of these superbly decked officers in Her Majesty's service, appealing as they do to the Hero- worship innate in every woman's heart." "Then, Welles, I must enjoy the fair creatures as rare exotics, gazing on them as if a glass case inter- posed between, knowlng I can neither touch, taste, nor inhale their intoxicating fragrance. But how does it chance, Madame, that every one here skates so perfectly? I see no timid ones, no begin- ners." "The many learning to skate, and others not pro- ficient, come in the morning for practice. I have known persons so fascinated with the amusement as to pass very nearly all day at the Rink," replied Mrs. Le Coeur.   - QUEST.       267 "What a jolly place! I think I should rather like to winter here. Eh, Welles i" "I find myself fairly shivering with the thought," said Cecil Welles. "You are really shaking with the cold," said Mrs. Le Coeur, "and being unused to our climate, I shall suggest a thorough. heating and glass of hot negus before we drive home. One gets quickly chilled sitting here; the skaters becoming heated with exercise, insist on having the windows open to admit air, which creates an atmosphere of intense cold in the building." A few hours later, on entering Mrs. Le Coeur's drawing-room, our travellers were presented to seve- ral persons assembled to meet them. Mr. Teesdale recognised with delight two beauti' ful girls he had seen at the Rink, and, on being pre- sented, instantly forgot his resolution to regard them as rare exotics; an accelerated movement of the heart made it evident the intoxicating fragrance of the. flowers he had forsworn had passed with subtle influence over his senses ; he quite forgot his formi- dable rivals, who were well represented in the room-; thanks to the tact and good-nature of his hostess, he had the satisfaction of leading one of the young ladies to dinner, and was soon quite at ease. Just as dinner was announced Cecil Welles ob- served' a gentleman entering the room, whom he knew at a glance to be D'Israeli. There was some-  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7529-00000134"/> 268       i QUEST. thing in the delicate, nervous modelling of the face; the finely cut, perfect features; the brilliant, piercing, oriental, eye; the sinewy, lithe form; that impressed with a sense of strong vigorous life, sustained spi- ritual force, and keen, impetuous character. On taking his place at table, Cecil Welles found he was not mistaken; he was presented to Mr. D'Israeli, who had a seat beside him. The oysters and soaup had been removed, the amber Chablis poured and quaffed, before the guests became communicative. "I do not like your people," said D'Israeli, conti- nuing a conversation somewhat progressed, and quite unmindful of the gout exumis of the delicate morceau of qriz de vea-U his mouth received. "You are cold, selfish, bigoted, and fanatical; the supreme desire and purpose of life amongst you is money. You worship the omnipotent dollar to the starvation and damnation of your souls." "You are severe," replied Cecil Welles. "Have you read De Tocqueville? He regards the New England character with extreme favor, and thinks all the intellect of the nation concentrates within her boundaries. You must acknowledge our men of letters, science, and art to rank all others in the land. Whatever be her faults, the influence of New England has been all powerful and important in the development of national character; and in the history of our nation she will stand preeminent."   QUEST.         269 "You all boast alike of what you have done for the nation, through your historians, scientific men, poets, artists, and the moral influence resulting from the Puritan characteristics as yet clinging to the people. As for the intellectual attainments of whichh you boast, they are not original thoughts worked out by- eager, studious minds; they are borrowed and reflected from the motherland from whence you sprung. One page of Shakspeare, Bacon, or Newton has thought enough, if diluted, to fill the numberless books your teeming press has turned out since the first American author had the courage to face the world on a printed page. Then the influence you have in the nation--how far it may reach, or how avail, I will not argue; I will only say amongst yourselves, Hknow that intolerance, prejudice, heartless and cruel indifference prevail to a degree which makes society cheerless and, unso- cial, and surrounds you with a moral atmosphere chilling and repulsive in the extreme to strangers. How  the great heart and gigantic intellect of Daniel Webster could have been nourished in so unkindly a soil surpasses my comprehension." "You are disposed to be so unjust towards us that you must permit me to ask if you judge us by personal intimacy, or through the medium of other, and perhaps prejudiced minds?" asked Cecil Welles.

Last year I was in Wash- ington, where I labored with Andrews to get the Reciprocity Treaty settled, which is destined to be the vital principle of our commerce. "I have studied your political economy, your people and public men with close attention, and have decided within my own mind that your system of government is false; it brings into power black- guards, knaves, fools, and demagogues, and places the rabble on an equality with the most elevated class of society; as the majority controls and the increase withyou is always through the lower grades of the people,-the scum and filth of the entire European population constantly pouring upon you,-there is no question in my mind that the government of the United States will be entirely in the hands of the mob in a few years' time." '"But we educate the people, teach them self- government, and give them practical proof of the benefits they receive through this very freedom and equality. Keenly alive to their own interests, the controlling influence they exert is to sustain the   QUEST.         271 institutions of the country, which are, as you know, for the greatest good of the greatest number." "You deceive yourself; the lower classes will not receive the education you offer them; they are brnu- talized from infancy, and like nothing better than the corruption in which they are born." D'Israeli, you allowed the Marcobrunner to pass, and now you refuse that Closvougeot; of what are you thinking" said Mr. Le Oceur, from the other side of the table. "I am thinking," said D'Israeli, as he poured the ruby wine into the exquisite, fragile glass, ,'that, your friend Mr. Welles, unfortunately placed beside me, has not fairly enjoyed one of the delicious entrees your chef has so skilfully served. While he eats that bit of pheasant you are sending him, I shall not utter a word." "These are the birds McKay sent me from Eng- land; they arrived in excellent condition, as you perceive." "Good birds, but not equal to the canvas-back one gets in the States." "Ah, really to enjoy pheasants, one should eat them after a day's shooting," said Mr. Le C(eur. "That is a matter of taste, certainly; they are generally preferred long after the day's shooting has been forgotten." "I have been proposing a winter pic-nic to MEr.

I would like to prove to your friend that such things do occur often with us, and are really pleasant frolics, notwithstanding the unpropitious season. I trust, as his stay depends on your arrangements, you will not insist on imme- diate departure." 'My time is unfortunately more valuable to others than myself, Madame ; as soon as I can leave, I shall be compelled to obey the voice which urges me on with its inevitable march!" "Pon me soul, how wery disagreeable that must be," lisped Lord Monteagle, fixing hip glass in his, eye the better to view his neighbor. 'i Very disagreeable!.t" echoed D'Israeli; (-a clothes- horse can always stand still." "What the devil does the man mean by a clothes. horse 2" asked his lordship of a very pretty woman beside him. "Oh, you know Mr. D'Israeli is on intimate terms with Carlyle!"His lordship looked more than ever bewildered. * The dessert was placed on the table, and the ladies retreated before the formidable row of decan- ters, concentrating within the topaz and ruby drops "bubbling up to each crystal brim, such potent power to gladden and madden the heart of man. Whilst they, the fair women, were gathering about the fire for a little gossip and chat, or possibly to taste a   QUEST.         273 rechauje' of some piquant morceau of dinner-table- talk; the usual topics of conversation were discussed over the wine in the dining-room; and when the party again assembled, the cup of tea, music,and game of whist, served to banish constraint and round the hours with a measure of delight. On the following day it became evident to Cecil Welles that his client's affairs would require him to remain in the city a day or two; the proposed pic- nic was therefore eagerly anticipated by the plea- sure-seeking Teesdale. The place decided on was La Chine, a few miles distant; it had a commodious inn, which could boast of a spacious ball-room, always in request on occasions of like festivity. About fifty couples were invited to assist at the pic-nic; the gentlemen were expected to provide wine and a band of musicians; the ladies furnished the substantial viands and deli- cacies. At a given hour and place all the company met together, snugly packed in comfortable sleighs, and scarcely recognizable individually for the luxurious fur robes and wrappers that shielded even the sensi- tive and much-abused tip of the nose from the nip of the keen air. Half the excitement was in the meet, as sporting characters would say; the horses were harnessed tandem in the single sleighs, where the driver had an elevated seat in front, or was perched less com- 12*  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7529-00000137"/> 274         QU ES'T. fortably behind; the double sleighs were superb with the gaily accoutred four-in-hand teams pranc- ing and plunging impatiently in the snow. There were merry greetings, 'joyous exclamations, bright sallies of wit, and peals of ringing laughter heard on every side till the signal was given to start, when away with a plunge and dash they sped to the crack- ing whips and merry music of the bells. It was dusk when they arrived at La Chine, tho- roughly chilled and stiff, despite the precautions used against the cold. Mulled claret and port were freely served, and failed no; to restore animation and vigor to the party. After an hour's patient waiting, it was announced that everything had arrived safely, and the supper was ready. A very jolly party they were, seated rolund the long table, enjoying with keen appetites, and criticizing with great good-nature, every dish marshalled before them. There was no lingering, however, after hunger was satisfied, for the pleasures of the evening were concentrated in the ball-room. With the first strains of music the dancers were assembled; every one of the party, old and young, had a part in the first cotillion, after which, those who preferred a game at cards retired to tables pre- pared for the purpose in a corner of the room, Mr. Teesdale yielded himself wholly to the influ- ence around him, enjoying to the uttermost every moment as it passed. Cecil Welles and D'Israeh   QUvsT.         275 stood near one of the card-tables, where several per- sons were playing at Vingt-et-un. "See how these dainty women devour with eager eyes those glittering piles of gold," said D'Israeli; "the devil has ton more of Eve's daughters through lust of gold than by any carnal desires of the flesh. Look at the stakes Madame D. has laid down! She is the. most reckless gamester I know, and always so cool; see the cards she turns, ace and king, by Jove! She just doubles her winnings-" "Do you know that with us such a thing as gaming is unknown in society; and that to my mind it is a revolting sight to see women playing for money ." said Cecil Welles. "Oh, I know that gaming is not tolerated in your drawing-roomns; but at clubs, and wherever men meet together, they gamble with a recklessness unparalleled in other countries. There is a great deal of hidden virtue and vice to be developed yet in your midst; in a few years your women will have progressed in fashionable morals, till they sit at the 'card-table, not playing for amusement, but gambling for excitement, as these fair creatures, who are the crgme de la crgme of our society. Old Anacreon knew the weakness of woman, when he sang: Affection now has fled from earth, Nor fire of genius, light of birth Nor heavenly virtue, can beguile From beauty's cheek one favoring smile.  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7529-00000138"/> 276         QUEST. Gold is the whoman's only theme, Gold is the woman's only dream." "What an exceedingly pretty woman Teesdale is dancing with, and how unconscious she seems of her beauty," said Cecil Welles. "Yes, she is the wife of this cold-looking man seated beside Madame J. I have watched her, if he has not. She has danced a mazourka and- polka with that stately colonel of the Guards, and she will be in his arms again for the next waltz, if I am not mistaken. What a dolt her husband is to sit there playing so calmly, when his wife is tasting of forbid- den fruit. Ah! it is as I told you; Teesdale relin- quished her to the colonel, and the waltz entices them with its voluptuous delights. .Mon Dieu, what an imbecile is the husband!" "Very possibly you are at fault regarding the wife," replied Cecil Welles. "She may be only very thoughtless and giddy; she looks too innocent to have treachery or guilt in her heart; depend upon it, few husbands are deceived where the wife seeks to play them false."             * "Well, you may believe in women, my young friend; I confess I do not. I think them crafty, dis- simulating, and treacherous; they are trained to it from childhood, and impose on us all the more readily through the arts and accomplishments by which we are led to think them as little less than angels. One of your authors, Dana, says women                      .   QUEST.         2" have been called angels in love tales and sonnets, till we have come to think of angels as little better than women." "You read Dana to little purpose, my friend, if you failed to observe how reverentially he speaks of woman; how he ascribes to her- influence all that is pure and exalted in life, all that is true and good in character. So long as the voice of -Elizabeth Barrett Browning is heard singing her inspired song to the heart of a listening world, it is not for man to doubt the influence of a pure woruan-soul, or the steadfastness of woman's heart. When I lose my faith in woman, when she is not to me the crowning beauty and joy of earth, life will cease to interest." "Wait till you have lived another ten years; then you will have been deluded and betrayed as others have been and will be, and still you may have pleasure in life without wasting a thought on woman," said D'Israeli. "That man has a history," said Cecil Welles to himself. "The very cynicism with which he looks on life betrays deep, ardent feelings, wounded, perhaps, yet- as keenly alive to pleasure as to pain. Who knows what thorns tear the flesh while the face looks steadily out on the world with a brave smile or bitter jest to hide the hidden agony," Mrs. Le Coeur approached, and drawing him away,  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7529-00000139"/> 278        QUEST. soon engrossed his thoughts 'ith the merry groups formed about the room. It was midniht before the party were fairly en route for home, They set out merrily as before, and were kept warm on the way through cheering memories of the evening's entertainment. "What glorious fun that pic-nic was!" said Tees- dale, next day, as they were separating after break- fast. "Never enjoyed anything so much in my life. Do you know, Welles, I have an engagement for the Rink to-day, to meet that lovely Miss J. I danced with twice last night?" "If you intend leaving with me to-day, you must not fail to be here in time for the three o'clock train. I must be back to-morrow  night, Tees.- dale.", "Never fear but I shall be punctual, although I confess to finding the place so jolly, I would not mind having a few .weeks' frolic. The climate is quite to my mind--in, fact, I find climate and people several degrees lessa frigid than in Boston. What do you sayl" "I find agreeable people wherever I go, and no climate warm enough to satisfy me. Amuse your- self well until two o'clock." The hour for departure arrive4, but Mr. Teesdale failed to appear. As Mr. D'Israeli had insisted on accompanying them over the river, Cecil Welles waited in no very patient mood; it was a new sensa-   QUEST.         2,79 tion, that of waiting, for one accustomed to have so many anxiously attend his leisure. "We must start directly if we would catch the train," said D'Israeli, as they stood at the door of the St. Lawrence Hall, looking eagerly in both directions. "One instant; that is he running up the street,' replied Welles. "'Pon my soul, I believe I'm late!" exclaimed Teesdale, understanding at once the expression of annoyance on both faces fixing him. "Jump in quickly--this sleigh. Now drive like the devil, Jerry! If you catch the train you shall lhave the evening with your sweetheart." .Thus urged, the driver pressed his horses forward, and skilfully conducted them through the narrow streets of the city till they reached the river. They were half way across the solid water when their progress was impeded by heavy sledges moving on slowly before them, while a long line of sleighs, returning from the depot to the city, made it impossible for them to pass. The road across the river was not wide; on either side large blocks of ice and snow formed a barrier quite impassable. Ten minutes lost in waiting! Then they were free to press on swift as the horses could move; the brave creatures did their best, but arrived to see the train sweeping away at full speed. "Too late!" they all cried in a breath.  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7529-00000140"/> 280         QUEST. "I'm sorry, Welles," says Teesdale; "it is all through my confounded folly! To think that I should waste your precious time in this way. I wish you would both abuse me. I should feel the better for it!" "I feel much more like abusing myself for having waited so long, running as I did the chances of being delayed in crossing the river. We must try for another start to-morrow," replied Cecil Welles. "Well, gentlemen, as you failed to reach the train through my driver's stupidity, I shall consider you my guests till such time as-you mnay think fit to take your departure," said D'Israeli. "Home, Jerry!" Every one may not know, and it is as well to state the fact, that the city of Montreal is situated at the foot of a mountain; the business streets of tile city are narrow and intricate, and the houses have an odd, tumble-down look in the old part of the town ; but as ,the population has increased and wealth ac- cumulated, new streets have extended from the heart of the town to the mountain slope, where superb houses, very like villas, with extensive lawns and or- namental gardens, stand in the conscious dignity of opulent comfort. Mr. D'Israeli's "Home, Jerry" meant just such a charming villa, not on the mountain slope, but suffi- ciently distant to have a view of its changing beau- ties day by day as the year rolled on.   QUEST.        281 It was well worth watching, tha' beautiful moun- tain, from the first unfolding of bud and leaf that veiled it in luminous, pure-tinted drapery which deepened as spring glided into summer to a gor- geous trailing garment, unfolding a world of mystery-changing only in autumn, to dazzle and bewilder the eye with magical hues caught from every flower gemming the earth---till, dismantled and bleak it lifted itself calmly to the winter, clothing itself with snow-drifts and clouds, sunshine and shadow, and the glories flashing from sunset skies and starry, moon-fed nights. Mr. D'Israeli's residence was built without regard to architectural beauty. It was spacious, comfort- able, and elegant ; the grounds were extensive, and, even in winter, the fine old trees grouped on the lawn, encrusted with snow and ice, presented a picturesque appearance. "I have no one to do the honors of my house but rmyself, gentlemen," said D'Israeli, as he ushered his guests into a comfortable morning room, all aglow with the flames of a ruddy fire, and the rosy light poured through crimson curtains by a flood of sunshine: "I have"no wife, thank God! to say pleasant things to every man but her husband; no woman here to feed her soul and body, drinking up my life. I bid you heartily welcome for all that, and place all I have at your disposal." A delicious lunch was served, after which, Mr.  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7529-00000141"/> 282         QUEST. D'Israeli invited Cecil Welles to drive with him to the convent, two miles distant, Mr. Teesdale having expressed his intention of indulging himself with an hour's skating at the Rink. Cecil Welles had taken up "Vanity Fair," and was already consoled for the day's contretemps, in the anticipated enjoy- ment of a few hours' leisure with the brilliant, deep- thoughted, large-hearted, subtle Thackeray; he therefore excused himself from accepting the invita- tion. But his host would not be refused; he knew he was selfish, but who would not be with the possi- bility of enjoying an agreeable companion, where the drive was a cheerless one, and the road uncom- monly rough, he said. "Vanity Fair" was reluctantly laid aside, and over the rough, bleak road, they made what speed they could on their way to the convent. "These exhibitions we are about to attend are vile things,'" said D'Israeli; "they develop in girls envy, hatred, malice, and all the worst passions of the weaker sex; they are stimulated in their studies by the vulgar praise and adulation they receive if they can stand up with brazen faces, before an as- sembled crowd, and unblushingly display their accomplishments and erudition." "By making one of the multitude, you seem to encourage the system," replied Cecil Welles. "Ah, my friend! I have not told you that I go to   QUEST.         283 see a little protgyge of mine, who cares very little if I am there or not, I dare say, although she pre- tends it breaks her heart if I stay away.

"To-day there chances to be an exhibition of the musical talent of the pupils at the convent; my little Mabel will do her part, though I wish I could prevent her being thrust forward to serve the selfish aims and'vanity of the mercenary people about her. She is too young yet to know  the sensation of vanity; it will develop fast enough, unhappily, with this hot-house training."- "But why educate a child where you deem the influence about her prejudicial to the highest de- velopment of character?" "Que voulez-vous, mon ami I the system of edu- cation in our convents is admirable; children there are thoroughly taught, carefully and tenderly watch- ed, and kindly treated; the objectional feature is this stimulating process, which incites the mind to well-doing, not for the real good and satisfaction it brings as its own reward, but for the laudation it draws from others.

"In age they are the vampires of society-mon Dieu! What venomous, poisonous old hags they be- come ' Soured and malicious, they pounce on every luckless unfortunate led astray through the intensity of unselfish passion. With keen eyes, they detect the show of a fault; their very presence sullies the white robes of purity; their breath spreads conta- gion where they pass." "Happily for the world, such creatures are few in number." "Their name is legion!" persisted D'Israeli. 1"But here we are at the convent; you perceive what a charming site it has, how it commands the entire valley and river, and by what extensive grounds, fields, and gardens it is surrounded. The holy fa- thers know what power is gained through enchanting the eye. Now for my little Mabel." They entered a dull-looking reception-room, where Sister Angelique received them, and apologized for the non-appearance of the child Mabel, who had been called to take her place in the exhibition-room where the guests were already assembled.   QUEST.   .     285 "The little girl is well, and has all she wants?" asked D'Israell, placing a small tortoise-shell box in the sister's hand. "She is quite well and happy. Monsieur will sea her, and satisfy himself," said the sister, making a profound reverence. The conversation had been in French; the nuns of the Sacre Cceur rarely spoke English. The stu- dies of the school-room were carried on through the French language. "I always give the Sister Angelique a little box filled with golden bon-bons, which she calls 'les pillules dories,' when I think she needs to be re- minded of her duty towards Mabel; it aids her won- derfully in herpetits w'oins, and the child is really fond of her," said D'Israeli, as they entered the exhi- bition-room. This was a lofty, spacious room, with long, arched windows, through which the light came, subdued and softened by various hues of tinted glass. At the extreme end of the room a platform was raised, and, descending to the floor by steps, was covered with crimson plush. Comfortable, cushioned chairs were arranged in rows, as seats for guests, through tle room; a few rar6 pictures and'prints covered the vacant space on the walls. On either side of the platform were ranged long lines of young girls, dressed in white, with blue sashes and shoulder-knots; they were rosy, plump,  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7529-00000143"/> 286         QUEST. happy-looking maidens, these pupils of the con- vent. A large organ, half concealed in a deep alcove, with its golden pipes mounting to the roof above; two full grand pianofortes, and a harp, promised a feast of tones, which might have been realized had a chorus of hooded monks, with veiled, sad-robed nuns, stood there to pour out their souls' aspiring cry in the solemn music that rises upwards, day by day; from earth's weary ones to God the Eternal; as it was, the sweet two-part song of the children seemed like bird-warbling, floated up and sustained by the deep, harmonies of the organ voice; it was song where one listened for the words, not "song without words," where every tone reveals page on page of life's most sacred joys and tears. :A pianoforte piece, for eight hands, followed the singing, which was not a bad performance; then tame a ballad, a sweet Scotch ballad, "Bonnie Dun- dee,' sung with great expression and spirit; then a grand waltz by Czerny, indifferently executed, the style of music not inciting to great effort. Other pieces followed through which D'Israeli sat uneasily. "Mabel at last!" he exclaimed. Cecil Welles followed his gaze to see a child emerge from the long lines of white drapery which had hitherto concealed her, and take her place in:the centre of the platform. "My   God, how beautiful!" he exclaimed, as his   QUEST.         287 eyes dilated to take in. the child. She stood quietly and unconsciously before the crowd; her eyes wan- dered a moment over the faces turned towards -her; but, with the first chords of the harp prelude, she had become absorbed in the music, rocking to and fro as a flower to the zephyrs, with the gushing, plaintive melody that ushered in "Mignon's kSong." Her mist-like, transparent dress was unrelieved by color; her face and arms flashed from out the soft cloud of her drapery with the graphic beauty of one of Murillo's child-angels; the golden hair, clustered, in glittering rings to her faultless head'; the broad low brow, the large, dark, soulful eyes, were in har- mony with the delicate lines of nose, mouth, afd the exquisite oval of the face. Her voice followed the prelude with clear, true, far-reaching tone; her young soul seemed to com- prehend Mignon's restless, passionate, yearning "Dahin " and give it vent in the tearful, sorrow- ing misic-tones with a pathos that pierced the heart's core. There was something in the timbre of the voice, an inexplicable something in the singing, that recalled to Cecil Welles another voice, which he might never hear again; a voice that would cling with earth's most ravishing sounds to his soul for time and eternity. The Exhibition was over, the young girls flitted down from the platform to mingle with the visitors.  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7529-00000144"/> 288         QUEST. Mabel's little golden head came floating on the waves of foam-like robes sweeping round her, till she reached D'Israeli and his companion. "My birdie!. my treasure!" said D'Israeli, as he clasped her in his arms, " how your sweet face cheers me." "I thought, petit pAre, you would never come; I stood watching for you till they sent me to my place; why did you wait? why did you stay away?" "Because, cherie, I had a troublesome friend with me that I could not get rid of, so I brought him, along; see, this is he, Mabel." The child turned to Cecil Welles; her deep, liquid eyes looked into his with a wondering gaze. "Are you the Saint Sebastian?" she asked, seri- "No, I am Cecil Welles," he replied. o "Look, petit pgre," she said to D'Israeli, "is he not the Saint Sebastian? he is like the beautiful picture in the chapel I knew he would come down if I left him my violets-" W What an odd notion, Mabel; he is only a man, not so much a saint as lton petit pere, chie; he is like all the men in the room ; look about, child, and see if they don't all look alike." "No, petit pe, he is like the beautiful picture; will he stay with you always, and- come when youa come t0 me to me?" "He lives far away, and cannot return when he   QUEST.         289 leaves us, birdie," replied D'Israeli, fondly caressing her gleaming curls. "But you will come again?" said the child, clasp- ing with both hands the hand CecilWelles had given her. "I will come again," he said earnestly, an instant, sudden thought springing into life with such power in his mind that he was unable -to resist its sway. He turned quickly to D'Israeli, and said in Eng- lish, "Is this child yours t"- "No," was the reply. "Her father, her mother, are they of your kith or kin?" "Neither; I question if she has father or mother -I doubt if she has any one to care for or protect her, save Mother Church and myself; but we are enough, Dieu merd."  Cecil Welles looked searchingly into Mabel's face--it had the same rare, spiritual beauty, the same earnest, radiant look that had impressed him in the child-faces sketched from the vision haunting Adelaide's brain .    - "The child is hers!" he said to himself; " there can be but-one such child on earth. O God I if it were only possible!" Again he spoke in soft, low tones to the child, in the language familiar to her ear; again his heart thrilled to'the sound of her voice. There was a graceful gesture of the head as she replied, so like 13    -     *  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7529-00000145"/> 290         QUEST. another head he had seen bowed in sorrow, and lifted at last to wear an imperishable crown on the radiant brow. Several persons pressed round them-some to speak with D'Israeli, others to say gentle words to Mabel; but the child clung closely to Cecil Welles; she would not leave him, nor would she suffer D'Israeli to move away from her. It was with untold reluctance that Cecil Welles left her at the hour when visitors were excluded from the convent. In the short time they had been together she had completely won his heart. The cold was so intense as they drove homeward, after sunset, that little attempt was made at con- versation. They found Mr. Teesdale awaiting them, and sat down immediately to dinner. Mr. D'Israeli's dining-room led into an extensive winter garden, filled with exotics, shrubs, and flow- ers ; a turf of fern-moss made everywhere a trailiing net-work of soft dewy green. The partition of glass frames was so arranged as to slide out of sight, throwing room and garden together. The luxurious arrangement of the apartment extended to the most minute detail of the table appointment; the linen was of exquisite texture, soft and sheeny as satin; the crystal was delicate as a,floating bubble; the porcelain was Sevres; the silver, massive and cu- viously wrought; a refined if voluptuous taste was dis- played in the service of the table, it being performed   QUEST.        291 by trim, pretty waiting-maids, the butler and serving- men being required to remain in the ante-room without; not so much as the click of a glass or the ring of silver was heard, as these dexterous hands swiftly and silently performed their duties. "How  was the skating, my friend?" -asked D'Israeli of Mr. Teesdale, as the first course was being removed from the table. "Excellent. I managed a quadrille tolerably well, thanks to my partner. I doubt if I should have en- joyed my appearance had I been opposite a full- length mirror-not much grace in my slides and curves, I fancy; but I watched my pretty partner's little feet, and enjoyed her coquettish manceuvres- and then I had the- pleasure of monopolizing her. Rather dull at the convent, was it not, Welles 2." "On. the contrary, I enjoyed my visit there. We saw a perfect vision of loveliness-apqrot6&amp;fe of Mr. D'lsraeli's." "It was a case of love at first sight with my little Mabel, I assure you. She called your friend here Saint Sebastian, and would not allow him to leave her without a promise of return." "How old is the child?" "I am sule I cannot remember. She is just the age to be perfectly enchanting, and not old enough to have developed a single female vice. I wish I could keep her where she is; the very thought of  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7529-00000146"/> 292         QUEST. her becoming a woman is torture to me," said D'Israeli. "I dare say as she grows older you will change your mind," replied Teesdale. "Will she live with you when she leaves the convent!" ';That is my intention ; the matter will rest en- tirely with her, however, and very like she will find a lonely old man but a sorry companion. Her his- tory is peculiar; I will relate it this evening." a"1 wish we could stay and enjoy ourselves here this evening, but I promised Le Coeur we would all join him at a whist party he has at his house. "At what hour shall we go?" said Teesdale. ":Le Coeur knows I never attend those whist parties. I shall place my horses at your disposal, gentlemen, but you must excuse me if I do not ac- company you." "I shall remain here," said Cecil Welles. "I much prefer a quiet -evening with you to society elsewhere." It was after Mr. Teesdale -had left, as they sat quietly enjoying their havanas, amidst plants, shrubs, and closing flowers, that Cecil Welles led the conversation back to Mabel. "She would be happy here,s' he said; "' the child has a.:fervent, poetic( nature, which might still de- velop in the atmosphere of this place. You said she was an orphan-is she then left to your exclusive control?"   QUEST.        293 "I am placed peculiarly with regard to her; but you shall judge for yourself. Nearly seven years ago a gentleman came to me, as an entire -stranger, requesting my advice as to where he might place a young child, to be carefully brought up, and edu- cated in- the strictest seclusion: he said he had wealth which he would use liberally to accomplish his wish; at the same time, he frankly stated that his name and residence must remain carefully con- ceale' from those persons with whom he intrusted the cild, as well as myself, for a certain number of years, when, he assured me, everything which might seem mysterious or unpleasant in the matter would be explained satisfactorily. "I confess to have had nmany misgivings, at the time, as to the propriety of assisting this man in carry- ing out his wish. I did not like the expression of his eye; still less, the hard, cruel mouth; yet he was good-looking enough-a man, women would rave about. I did not like the mystery of the thing, but he assured me the child was his, that he desired to shield her from the corrupt influence of a depraved mother, and was, in brief, so plausible I could not resist him. "He wished to place in my hands ten thousand pounds, to be invested as I should deem most profit- able ; the interest of this sum was to be used gene- rously for the education and needs of the child; the surplus he proposed I should receive for my general  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7529-00000147"/> 294:        QUEST. supervision and care, which liberal offer I refused, lhaving, heaven knows, as much of this world's dross as I can manage. "We visited the different convents in the city and the vicinity, any one of which I assured him would admirably fulfil his wish for seclusion and the child's good nurture. The Sacrea Catr made a pleasing impression on his mind, fromn our seeing there rosy, merry-looking young children, and there it was agreed the child should have a home. I had not seen her till the day on which she was received into the convent. She was a wee, prattling thing in the first dawn of childhood, with the same beaming, sunny face she has now. The nuns were charmed with her, and received her with so much affection that the father seelned reconciled to leaving her. He called her Mabel, and said she had no other name. ' Before leaving, he stated his intention of travel- ling far and wide for the space of three years, at the expiration of which time he said he should surely return to visit his child. Should any unforeseen event or accident prevent his coming, should he never return, I was still to educate and guard her in strict- est seclusion; if she arrived at the age of sixteen without his having reappeared to claim her, she was then to receive a sealed packet, which he placed in my hands, and to decide if she would bear her father's name, and where she would make her future home.,   QUEST.         295 -"He requested me not to seek to discover his name or place of abode, as it might lead others to trace the child. I promised to adhere to his instructions, and have followed them faithfully; during the first year of her residence at the convent, I seldom saw her, but as she grew older and evinced an extraordinary fondness for me, my heart leaned towards her, my thoughts rested with her, however great the distance separating us. "I have not known much of children, but surely there are few like my Mabel. She is gifted with an impressible, ready mind, capable of the highest development; she has a warm, impulsive, trust- loving heart; her musical talent is wonderful; her studies in music are accomplished without effort; her affections are given to but few about her, .but they are strong and tenacious, making up the very substance and vitality of her being. So has she won my heart, even against my will, that I love her as if she were bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh. "Till within the last year I hoped for, and awaited, the coming of her father; I have now no doubt that he has resigned the child to her fate, or possibly he may have died in his wanderings; he looked like a man worn by trouble or disease. "You will blame me perhaps when I tell you I exult in the thought of his death; I have come to look on this treasure intrusted to my care as my  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7529-00000148"/> 1296        QUEST. own. I watch it with jealous eyes; I guard it with increasing anxiety; the very possibility of its being snatched from me now, makes. every nerve in my body quiver with pain. "The sum placed in my hands has, by carefill management, nearly doubled, but my little Mabel will not need her father's wealth or his carefully guarded name. She is my child by adoption, and heiress to my worldly possessions, which will be no mean -inheritance. "Thank God! the time is yet far distant when I shall place inher hands the power to choose her own name and home. I doubt if I ever give her the opportunity to leave me. I will take her abroad; 1 will travel with her. She shall be amused; she shall, be so enchanted with life as I unfold it for her, that she will not wish to seek another home." Cecil Welles had listened with a face calm and unmoved, as if the perfect features had been cut inc marble, but his heart beat with a quick con- vulsive throb; his deep, unfathomable eyes were luminous with repressed tears; his ears drank in greedily the voice revealing what he had striven and toiled to know, yet- within the sense was another voice pleading, imploring, supplicating with a wild heart-wrung cry: "Give me back my child!" "What was this man, with his hopes, fears, aims, or affections, to him? Should he give him a thought with the wail of that voice in his soul? Should he    QUEST.        297 hesitate or falter in striking a blow that must fall with cruel force, crushing out hopes that made life sweet! His voice was husky and low as he turned to D'Israeli and said: "Although I shall almost break your heart by saying it, yet it seems an interposition of heaven, the accident which detains me here. I will not use craft or subterfuge with you, but tell you frankly that this child has been the object of my search during two years."         : ' Heavenly Christ t and I have betrayed myself! Her father is dead-she is claimed byo4ers. Speak!  Would to God I had never seen your face!" said D'Israeli, in a voice hoarse with emo. tion, every muscle of his face twitching and. dis- torted.  "Her father died; he perished by fire at sea, six months after placing the child with you; her mo- ther lives." "A  depraved, corrupt creature. Mabel shall never leave me to go to her; never!

"She WILL leave you!" was the calm, passionless reply, " and you will listen to me patiently, for my story is long and painful." Adelaide's life H How well he knew its veriest de- tails! With what power and feeling did he relate thie events that had withered its freshness, and traced its progress with thorns, tears, and long-protracted an- guish I nsensibly, as he pursued her story, he made her mind a reflex of his own, he clothed her cha- racter with the beauty and grace inseparable from his very life. She would not have known herself as he drew her, picture, so had he softened every trait with the exquisite hue of his own fancy. So engrossed was he in the recital of her sorrows and succeeding happiness, that he failed to observe the contending emotions clearly depicted on his companion's expressive face. As he ceased speak- ing, D'Israeli said, with a groan- "Oh, that I had never seen you!--that I had never-heard the name of Adelaide de Rennville; then I might have kept my little Mabel in my own heart. Why should this woman, married and happy, come between me and my treasure! She can have other children to nestle in her bosom, and gladden her home: why must she claim this one she never knew? Good God   when I think that another woman is to rob me of my lifers joy-that again a   QUEST.        299 woman stands in my path to thwart my will, 1 could curse the mother who bore me." In fearful words the passion poured forth, bring- ing with it the long-concealed anguish and wrongs of a lifetime. CecileWelles read, with rapid glance, page after page of the history he had intuitively re- cognised in the first hour he passed with his strange companion. "Do not give me your pity-do not speak to me again to-night!" said D'Israeli, as an answering voice stole soothingly to his ear in the shadows where he had thrown himself. "Let us part till the morning; make my excuses' to your friend," and he was gone. On the following day, when they met alone, Mr. D'Israeli placed the sealed packet in Cecil Welles's hand, and requested him, to open it. It contained a mi- niature, a case of jewels, and a letter, which read- "MY DEAR CHLD,-If i you have reached the age of sixteen without having seen your father, be sure he is dead, for he loved you, and would have returned to seek you hadihe lived. He leaves you his name, and wealth enough to enable you to live comfortably. The ten thousand pounds placed in Mr. D'Israeli's hand will, doubtless, have somewhat increased, and other property may be claimed by applying to Charles Bury, of New York. Then, my child, you will learn if you have other relatives living.

"I make a particular request that, if you marry, it will not be till you have attained your twentieth year, and then that your property be settled on yourself. "I have inclosed a portrait of myself, Mabel, that you may sometimes recall the father who will have faded from your memory; think of him kindly, for he loved you, and in leaving you he knows a bitter sadn ess. "As you will only receive this letter in case of my not-returning to claim you, and then when you are at an age to be undecided as to your future life, I would have you to understand you are .not to remain at the convent, but are to leave immediately for New York, where you; will seek the solicitor referred to, who will put you in communication with those who love you. "My child, I would have you happy. I have en- deavored to remove you from every influence that could, harm or wound you. Remember this, when you bear the name of your affectionate father,  ROBERT MANDEVIL." Mr. D'Israeli listened to the reading of the letter, and examined the portrait unmoved; he proceeded with calm deliberation to make the needful arrange- ments with Cecil Welles for= Mabel's future. l]:e didnot permit himself the least expression of feel        6        .

To this request, persistently urged and, favorably presented, he made but one reply: that the child had been intrusted to him, and faithfully had he fulfilled his trust; he would still watch and guard her with unwearied zeal, yielding her only when compelled by the mother, into whose hands alone he would deliver his treasure. There was still a possi- bility, he said, that the fatality which had attended the father on the seas might pursue the mother, and however cruel the suggestion, it was powerful enough in its influence on his future to decide him against permitting Mabel to leave him. Finding no argument could change him, Cecil Welles prepared to take his departure, not, however, before making another visit to the convent with Mr. D'Israeli, to see the child. It was agreed that nothing should be said regard- ing the discovery of the little Mabel's identity ; upon reflection it was deemed best not even to communi- cate the fact to Mrs. de Rennville, as she would be placed in-a position at once annoying and painfidl, through Mr. D'Israeli's decision. Cecil Welles and Mr. Teesdale left Montreal 'well satisfied with the result of their visit, for the pleasure-  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7529-00000151"/> 802        QUEST. loving Teesdale had resolved to settle down into a quiet Benedict, could he persuade, as he firmly thought he might, his pretty skating friend, Lina Julese, to leave, her northern kome for one where his smile should make the sunny brightness of her life as one long dream of pleasure. They each had a secret at heart as they swept slowly on through snow- drifts and wintry winds towards home, yet they wore the same mask of calm as before, and thought they read each other, Cecil Welles sat down on entering his room, and -wrote to Ralph Stanley. It was not till several weeks had elapsed, after many delays and re-postings, that the letter reached its destination; it travelled to the south of France, where Ralph had taken Adelaide, that she might enjoy the luxurious beauty of spring. It was April, under a sunny sky, with flowers dot- ting the earth, and soft masses of verdure spreading everywhere in fleecy clouds aspiring heavenward. Ralph sat with Adelaide in the golden light of that radiant day for which he had waited long and eagerly. "My own true wife, lift up your beautiful eyes and let me read their deepest depths," he said, as he drew her tenderly towards him. "Yes, Ralph, look through my eyes to my very sotrl, and read how it surrenders to you its every hope.

"Has my love, measureless and untold indeed, effaced every trace of that dreary past, and poured from the present a fulness of joy that knows no under-current of pain or sadness?" "Oh, Ralph, if I catch one tone of sorrow echoing from that past, it is but the discord making more unutterably sweet the, divine harmony of my life. If I know one longing you cannot fill, God still teaches me, by the earth-pangs and the cross He bore, patiently to trust in Him. Rather let me ask, if, pressing closer to your side day by day and putting out new tendrils to enclasp your heart, I have blessed you with some portion of the blessing rest- ing over me; yielding all my life, I give so little, oh, my husband!" "My perfect wife, my Adelaide, words are not strong to express the' bliss which enfolds me; no, nor is music deep enough to free the thoughts I vainly strive to utter when I would tell you what you are to me; I asked God to give me you, only you; I ask again, O loving one, that this life within my life may fill my earthly Paradise with angel-looks- and  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7529-00000152"/> 804         QUEST. songs as now, and still be mine, more beautiful, with glory and delight in God's own heaven, our homes." "My husband, the very bliss of heaven, the inmys- tery of heaven has passed into my life; it- is mine now as your delicious voice pours its music in my ear. Oh, how can I bless you for this love, that first with ideal beauty flashed its rose-hues over me; love, that lifted to my weary soul the cup of the Immortals; love, so true, as to make me proud of my womanhood, realizing in all its ecstasy the divinity of human passion. "Your love! would I exchange it for earthly tri- bute, or earthly pleasure? Would I take its crown from off my brow for all the thorns that might pierce my flesh? Could I forget or renounce its joys, were you to strip me of its purple and gold, leading me poor and naked as when you found me?" "We do, indeed, hold God and the Infinite in our hearts, my own wife; and this our love shall unite us in- one thought, one deep, unbroken rapture. Think you, beloved, you could receive one joy more-one great, unlooked-for joy, Adelaide?"  "What is it? Oh, speak, Ralph." "Do you remember the white-robed children we saw going to their first communion at Easter? Do you remember saying if God would give her back: you would lead her toi Him so lovingly that He should be her supreme thought?" "O yes, yes;; say on "'   QUEST.         305 "He has heard you; O love of'my heart! He has given back your child." - "My child-O God!" The arms clasped round him loosened their hold, and ere he knew it, she had slid down from the low seat beside him, and lay mute and motionless at his feet. "I have killed her!" he said, in agony. No, it was not death; joy may sweep its great golden waves over the soul, paralysing to momentary unconsciousness, but it does not kill. And so, as he bent over her, calling her with passionate earnest- ness to awaken, her spirit caught the accents of his voice, and, obedient to his will, looked out once more from the eyes that opened to still his pain. "Ralph, where is she? Let me see her with my eyes; let me touch her with my hands; let me hold her to my heart, my darling! my treasure!" were the first words- she spoke.. "She is not here, my own; but she is found, and awaits us in our far-off land." "Let us go, beloved! let us go." "Yes, we will go; to-morrow we will turn our faces homeward: and now, we will read together this letter, which will anticipate all your questions, and fill your heart with perfect satisfaction." Cecil Welles's letter gave the most minute detail of each incident connected with his visit to Montreal. In his description of Mabel he had, indeed, antici- pated every question the mother's heart could sug-  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7529-00000153"/> 306         QUEST. gest. He drew a picture of the child with great feeling and delicacy, recounting, to the most trivial word, the conversations he had with her during the interviews at the convent. "Mabel I Mabel Oh, how sweet to know her name. Shall we call her Mabel?" said Adelaide, as she paused to clear from her eyes the big tears that would gather as she read. "We will call her Mabel-our Mabel, darling!" said Ralph. "Let me read those words again. She is beauti- ful and gifted. My own sweet daughter! You will love her, Ralph. Oh, you cannot know how I have feared that, finding her, some blight might rest upon my blossom, some evil or misfortune cling to her, making my prayer for her life, if answered, prove a curse rather than a blessing: But she is mine again, perfect as when first I folded my arms around her-mine, my beautiful one! And you have given her to me, Ralph.  You have ransomed and re- deemed me, have sheltered me in your great heart, made me forget myself, and now you crown my life with this one great rapture. My husband, let me not so hold you supreme in thought that I forget God--let me not so fill my soul with the delicious loves of earth that I forget His love: rather lift my hopes Heavenward, beloved, when they would cling to life and thee!" A month later, and the cottage at Brookdale was   QUEST.        307 decked with the first wild flowers and green sprays of summer; every room was flooded with sunshine, every nook was vocal with sweet voices, stealing in to tell of glowing life without; beauty, light, life, aid delight again entered the little dwelling, for Ralph had brought Adelaide home. Again Mrs. de Rennville had herloved-ones beside her, and she knew from the first tidings that reached her of their coming, that henceforth for her, as for them, there would-be no prolonged partings. They were resting but a few brief hours under the hallowed roof, after long and weary travel, and Cecil Welles was there to meet them. - With what warm, tender affection they greeted him 1 How they tried, and failed to express, the gratitude they could never repay for the inestimable service he had ren, deredtlem. .  He was a witness to their felicity; he knew they had attained the deep untroubled calm of hallowed, holy love; and, a something of the brightness en- folding them seemed to fall on him, dispersing all dejection and gloom.- He had much to recount, not only in reply to Adelaide's many questions, but to prepare them for meeting D'Israeli, whose peculiarities he wished them to understand, that the cold, cynical manner of the man, used rather to conceal than express-his thoughts, might not mislead as to the warm, kindly, and honest heart beneath the surface.  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7529-00000154"/> 308         QUEST. And when all was said, and the "good-byes," that would not long separate them, spoken, they, parted. Ralph and Adelaide had another journey before them, and on they pressed to reach the end so near. They came' to the old French city at last; their feet had hardly touched its soil when they were met by Mr. D'Israeli, who made himself known, and said: -"I trust as I have beeri the' occasion of your coming this weary distance, that you will do me the honor to make my house your home during your sojourn here. I need not add, that my every effort will be to lengthen the time of your stay; indeed, I would I might prolong it indefinitely." "We accept your hospitalities gladly and without hesitation," said Ralph. Adelaide put her hand within that of Mr. D'Israeli, and said, eagerly: "Yes, we will go with you. Oh, sir, take us! to her-our Mabel; is she well? Have you told her? Does she know of our coming '" "I have told her; she awaits you," said Mr. D'Israeli, looking intently at Adelaide. "And oh, Madame, had I known years ago the mother I was robbing of her treasure, I would have torn out my own heart rather tlian inflict the torture that mother has endured. When you see Mabel, you will for- give my selfishness; when you relnove her from my eyes, life for me will have lost its sunshine; my future will be a blank."   //   QUEST.        309 "Dear sir," said Adelaide, warmly, "I feel how weak are words to express my gratitude for the love and tender care you have lavished on my child Think not I would rob you of her presence or affec tion; our home, her home, shall be yours when you will share it with us. You shall never regret having found her mother, for that mother's heart is large enough to hold and cherish all who love her child." "Bless you, Madame, for words that bring peace to my soul. Henceforth I will reverence mankind for your sake." "Shall we go, dears sir?" said Adelaide,in her restless impatience, scarcely heeding the words he spoke. "Yes, here is the carriage; we shall soon reach home. Jerry, let the horses fly!" Away they whirled, past the moss-grown houses, the glittering, tin-plated roofs, the aspiring dome- towers, the gaily-decked shop windows, the graceful foreign women, the brilliant uniforms, the smart equipages, the richly-caparisoned steeds, and sweep- ing away from the narrow streets, they entered the broad road leading to the mountain, catching glimpses only of the villas. half hidden in luxurious foliage, burning with deep red roses, flame-like honeysuckles, and feathery tufts of the purple clematis. The sky overhead was the bluest blue through which the yellow sunlight flashed and sparkled; birds floated on love-light wing 'towards the moun-  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7529-00000155"/> 810         QUEST. tain; gushes of melody filled the air. But Adelaide heeded not the voluptuous beauty filling earth and heaven; -her eyes looked far into vacancy with a strained, eager gaze, her hands clasped tightly her husband's, who -watched her face with loving, wist- ful'eyes. Yonder is my house; there you will find rest,' said Mr. D'Israeli, as they entered the avenue. Ade- laide's breath came in quick convulsive gasps; she trembled and shook with the strong passion -of her heart. The carriage- stopped; the door was thrown open by a pretty French bonne. Adelaide stood bewildered in the hall; she looked imploringly at Mr. D'Israeli. "Mademoiselle Mabel?" he said to the Tonne. "XMnsieur, Mademoiselle Mabel n'est pas d la matson. Ele voulait absolument se promener. pour chercher desjfeztrs. Elle va rentrer tout d a l'here." "Mabel has gone to gather flowers, without doubt for you, dear Madame. Let-the maid show you to your rooms. I will go in search of the child." Adelaide grasped Ralph's hand. "She is not here, not here. Oh, Ralph, if she should be lost again to me!" she said, in a bone of anguish. "(Come with me, my own wife. She will return; have but a moment's patience. Let me aid you to put -aside this travel-stained dress. I would have you look yourself when our dear one meets you. Come!t" He led her tenderly away. When they reached   QUEST.         8" the room assigned to them he dismissed the maid, and with his own hands arranged her toilet,'for she was quite helpless; excitement and fear aiertied to have drained off all vitality.    { /  Ralph unpacked her boxes, and shook out ' "its' soft folds a white India muslin robe, in which he arrayed her. "My darling, look at yourself in the mirror. Children love beauty. How our child will love you!" he said, as he watched her with proud, ad miring eyes. "Hark!" she exclaimed, springing to tha open window. Her ear had caught the tones of,a sweet, child-like voice; up it came, pealing up like the music of the lark, in notes as ravishingly sweet and deliciously pure-; full, gushing, free, the vdice poured out in wild, rich, melody. "I It is she! O God, let me see her!" burst from Adelaide's- lips, as she passed swiftly from the room. Ralph saw her pause an instant in the hall below, as if uncertain which door to enter; but the voice rang out its adorable peal of song, and guided her on; her white dress vanished. He followed. She entered a long, spacious drawing-room, at the- end of which was a bay-window, opening to a lawn, and a luxury of verdure beyond. On the window-sill stood a child, swaying toand fro as she sung, and clustering with her little fingers a bouquet of violets from a mass of tangled grase  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7529-00000156"/> 312         QUEST. and flowers beside her. The sunlight laid a halo about her golden head; it flathed its splendor on her dimpled neck and armns, and hid in the folds of her foa White dress.* The face was bent towards tleb owers, and revealed a delicate, pink, shell-like ear, that lay in exquisite beauty against the gleam- ing, tumbled curls, and marked the -white throat, formed, like a bird's, for warbling; the rosy lips parted, to gain new grace.; the drooped eyes were fringed with long, curling lashes. Adelaide paused as her eyes drew in the child; her pale, passionate face was suddenly transfigured with the light flooding her soul; she opened her arms, her lips moved with a spasm; in vain she tried to utter a: word, a sound, a cry. Ralph drew to her side, and encircled her with his arm; at his touch her voice burst forth in one intense, yearning, heart-wrung cry- "My child! my child! my child!" Mabel looked up; she saw them both before her; saw the arms opened to receive her; then silently, slowly, she moved towards them, gazing all the while with a fixed, earnest look at Adelaide, yet she spoke not till the open arms had enfolded her, and on her head was Ovid the holy chrism of tears and kisses; then, the first word those child-like lips ut- tered was "bother " . - THE END.    &#xD;</p>
