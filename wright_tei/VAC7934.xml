EVERY one, having the audacity to make a book, is expected to get up an apology for so doing.   I have nothing to plead.

Many of these sketches have appeared in the American Union, Gleason's Pic- torial, the Boston Museum, and last, not least, in the. Boston Times. Some of them have been gotten up especially for the occasion; and a few are old friends of mine, which have been too dear. from association to allow me lightly to part with them. There are pleasant fancies and sad fancies--impulses born of smiles and impulses born of tears -amongst the col- lection; and if the perusal of the volume will win me the love of one more friend, I shall be amply, repaid -for the care and toil, the doubts and fears, which have been the companions of its getting up.

A LEGEND OF WYOMNG. CHAPTER I. IT could scarcely be called a clearing, that little patch of ground, hidden away in the heart of the western wilds, though, morning, noon, and night, the sound of the axe reverberated through the woods, and over the hills, with a heartiness which told plainly as words could have done, that the spirit of industry and enterprise had broken in upon the dreamy stillness of Wy- oming valley. And how beautiful it was, that valley with its wealth of flowers and mosses, slumbering beneath the tall hills which clasped it on every side! The air swept down from the mountains with delicious purity, and the morning sunlight broke through the heavy foliage which fringed its border with such a quiet and subdued radiance, one could al- most imagine that it was sentient, and loved the locality. Far as the eye could reach, a pleasant river flashed in and out through the heavy verdure, with a perpetual murmur of mu- sic, while here and there upon its brinki like tired animals, were scattered the log cabins of the adventurous settlers. It was summer, and the trees were burdened with foliage; and the flowers, bursting through the moss, were blooming all along the wood paths, as if some conquering giant, returning home from successful strife, had scattered the trophies of his victory with a liberal hand. Far up the cliffs a young man (11) X    0  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7934-00000007"/> 12     HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, of athletic bearing had threaded over masses of broken rock, and through thickets of stunted hemlock, to gaze down upon the wilderness of green leaves, throbbing in the sunlight like a great, wild sea, impatient of restraint. It was morning, a summer morning, and the air was freighted with the perfume of flowers, drifting up from their home in the valley, and at every step a shower of dewdrops rained down from the thick leaves, and lay glistening upon the greensward like innumera- ble eyes. Beneath his feet, where the shadows were most intense, could be seen the glimmerings of the river, as it broke up through the underbrush and drifted inamong the blossoms, which bent their bright lips down to its very brink. All along its banks were clumps of maple and willow, turning out their silver linings in the rich light, while huge cliffs and frag- ments of rocks, shelving far over its bosom, completed a pic- ture beautifully sublime. From the earliest dawn there had been the clashing of axes,; but now, as if by common consent, the tumult had ceased, while here and there a laborer might be seen emerging from the thicket, and cutting across over the little clearing, to his humble dwelling. Just in the curve of the river, where the sunshine was warmest, and the flowers most luxuriant, had at some period been piled up a clump of logs, which after- wards assumed the name of the Valley Home, partly because it took in a deeper range of ground than any of its neighbors, and partly because its owner, farmer Huse, had been the first to make a home in the valley. It was a fair, white hand, white as an opening lily, which gleamed through the rifts of honeysuckles that shaded the *small window, and a bright, sun- ny face, though now its expression was somewhat clouded, which stood out in bold relief from among the parted vines,   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.       13 while a pair of azure eyes roved down a little pathway to the river, and up the tall hills on the adjacent side. The quick eye of the rover upon the mountains, which had taken in every object around him, did not fail to notice the anxious look of the bright maiden, who, having left the window, now stood listlessly in the open door ] A smile, clear and vivid, broke over his handsome features ,-one which failed to reveal aught but an honest, frank, and generous nature, -and he raised a small whistle which was suspended to his neck, and was upon the point of giving the accustomed signal, when the object of his attention disappeared within the cabin. "'No sign of Henry yet?" asked the old farmer of his daughter, as she closed the door and began brushing up the room, though you could not have found a particle of dust in the entire cabin. '6 He will return soon," she replied, almost deprecating; and again the sweet face was framed in the dewy leaves, and the earnest eyes burning into the forest thickness. "He is an idler and a trifler," exclaimed her father petulant- ly. "The breakfast is getting as cold as Greenland, and what is worse, I'm spoilinga good day's work by loitering in doors all this while;" and his eyes roved, with a half-petulant, half- pleased expression to a huge pile of logs, which lay rolled together, glistening in the sunbeams as they came slanting down over the hills. ': Trees, every one of them this morning," he murmured; and rubbing his hard, brown hands together with almost child- ish meiriment, he called again to his daughter, who, obedient to his command, began preparing the simple meal which had been delayed by the absence of the young hunter. A reck- less, daring spirit, full of energy and power, was the charac- 2 f  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7934-00000008"/> "    HOME SCENES AND HOMSE SOUNDS, teristic feature in the temperament of Henry Huse. The deep forests and wild hills were his familiar haunts, and sometimes, in the very spirit of adventure, he would make long voyages up among the cliffs, although he knew them to be the lurking- places of a body of Indians, whose lawless deeds of depreda- tion had made them both hated and feared by the valley set- tlers. This same wild spirit would send him frequently into the very depths of the wilderness, and if any of the beasts of prey, bye which the woods were infested, should attempt to impede his progress, the next moment they were dead at his feet. The near growl of a panther, or, what was worse, the close proximity to a group of Indians, would but startle his blood into a wilder glow, and quicken the heart which lived only for excitement. It was difficult to say from whom he inherited this love for lawless adventure; certainly riot from Richard Huse, the honest, hard-working owner of the Valley Farm, and most certainly not from the farmer's gentle wife, who in the first year of their western life had been laid away, with pany tears, in a quiet corner of the farm, where the wild flowers were ever after suffered to grow unmolested. The same free, brave, daring traits which characterized his manhood, had been severe trials to farmer Huse in the days of his youth. Coaxings and pleadings were lost upon him; while severity and threats of harsh punishment were only as so many fresh coals of fire upon' the heart of the fearless boy. Th greater the danger, the more tempting and exciting was the lve of adventure, until at length his father gave him up to the free exercise of his indomitable will, conscious that any restraining power was only fanning the coals into a fiercer fire. But there was one voice that had power to, tame and subdue his nature, even in its wildest mood; there was one   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.       15 pair of eyes beneath whose gentle glance his spirit would droop and grow mild and humble as a dependent child - his sister, his meek, trusting, and affectionate sister. The hard- working settlers might look upon his roving life with scorn, or perhaps distrust; his father might turn from him with an- gry reproach, but the dear, mild eyes of Nelly Huse never met his own but with gentleness and sympathy; the loving lips, so eloquent in their unsullied freshness, never breathed words to his ear but that their purport was of kindness and af- fection. No wonder that his love for her was the only religion he could comprehend. His heart had opened for some object, of endearment, and folded itself over the bosom of his sister with intense and absorbing power. The morning of which I write, there had been a strange- intuitive feeling of coming sorrow in the breast of Nelly, and as Henry was the chief ob- ject of her interest, she naturally imagined it must appertain to him, and with all the earnestness of a warm heart, she had plead'with him to forego that one morning's ramble. His   only reply was a merry laugh and a saucy shake of the head, as he disappeared among the jagged rocks. For hours and hours he had been rambling about, meeting with nothing to arouse the excitable spirit within him, until, almost uncon- sciously, he stood upon the brow of a cliff, where one step more must have been inevitable destruction. The wild fire of his nature flushed up to his face, his eyes became brilliant with excitement, and he was upon the point of daring the fearful descent, when a light hand rested upon his shoulder, and a pair of dark, dreamy eyes peered curiously into his own. Starting from his dangerous position, he sought to detain the intruder; but with an expression of terrified wonder, she eluded his grasp, sprang to a more accessible point of the.  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7934-00000009"/> -16    HOME SC I: S ANrt ID HOME SOUNDVS precipice, And securing a heavy vine, swung, herself wildly down the liff. In the rapidity of her fall, the frail sup- port gave way, and the next moment the beautiful Indian lay a senseless mass at the foot of the ravine. With a self- possession which had been acquired by his forest life, he sprang from rock to rock, and was soon at her side, bathing her temples with the pure water. which 'trickled through the interstices of the cliff, and lifting the long black hair from her bosom, that the fresh air might have full force upon a frame whose quivering pulse gave evidence fhat life was- still left to her. For hours and hours the senseless girl rested in his arms, and when the evening came, and the shadows began to thicken among the trees, one heart at least had learned a les- son of love, the strength of which it was left for time to test. The accidental meeting on the cliff was but a prelude4o many happy hours passed in that pleasant solitude. To be sure, the young hunter and the forest girl did not meet as lovers; for nothing could be more absurd than the idea of a match be- tween those so differently situated; but they did meet, not- withstanding, and the wild light began to soften in the eyes of the girl, and a dewiness to gather around her heart; and though /the sentiment which occasioned it found no words, her quick perception told her that a beautiful and holy affection was coiling its links around her spirit. Her knowledge of life was not sufficient to enable her to follow up the chain to its proba- ble ending; so she went on dreaming- dreaming evermore, and yielding unreservedly to her hopes, for they had crept upon her spirit unawares, and hovered there in the shape of a blessing. Morning after morning Namaocre might have been seen clambering over the brushwood and fallen trees, to meet the hunter upon the cliff; and when the storms came, and the   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.       17 lightnings flashed through the forest, there was a sheltering nook, made beautiful by flowering shrubs, wherein the youth- ful pair found shelter and safety. There was no thought of wrong, no depth of passion to disturb the purity of their inno- cence, for they were alike children of nature, whose love and passion were a blending of the same ingredients, and had a source from the well-spring of superstition. One evening they had prolonged their stay to-a later hour than usual; the last flush of sunlight had faded from the hill tops, and the moon came up and rested upon the bosom of the river, until its bright waves rippled like a sea of silver, and the heart of Namaocre was full of joy, for it folded an instinctive feeling of something pleasant and beautiful- less dreamy and more intense than any former impulse. By degrees this feeling wore away, and was succeeded by one of a more saddened cast, for clouds were now drifting over the sky, shutting out the rich light upon the water. "How dark! how dark!" mur- mured the Indian girl, in broken accents. A voice was whis- pering to her heart, and when she turned again the clouds had passed away, and the ripples were again dancing in the moon- light. And yet she stood gazing into the brilliant water with her strange wild eyes, as if jusg beginning a page of life hith- erto invisible. And then her hand closed upon that of the young hunter, and a glad, sweet smile broke over her face, revealing to him the nature of her thoughts. Her wild spirit was finding its strength-her heart its life; the world had grown holt and beautiful, for the clasp of. ignorance had been taken from her spirit, and she could comprehend that which before had seemed so strange to her untutored in- tellect. All at once a shadow fell upon the face of Namaocre. The winds had rocked the old forest to sleep, and not a 2*  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7934-00000010"/> 18     HOME SCENES AND IIOIME SOUNDS, sound was in the wilderness, save the occasional chirp of a bird, or the rippling of the little fountain which flashed up from its mossy basin, ana gushed over the broken rocks, to lose itself among the sweetfern which grew in a little hollow just beyond; yet she bent her ear to listen. Still the beating of her own heart was all the sound she heard; but just then, as she was about to resume her station by the hunter's side,- alight canoe shot round the projecting rock which sheltered them, and flew like a bird into the middle of the stream. "It is. Oneacta, the white chief," she murmured, laying her finger an her lips, to enjoin silence. The next moment the canoe had reached the opposite shore, while a tall, dark individual, with a face upon which cunning and malignity were alike itamped, sprang ashore, and securing the boat among the al- lers which skirted the river, crept with cat-like caution up he steep embankment. With the same stealthy pace he ,ained the edge of the clearing, taking care to conceal -him- elf from observation behind the growth of underbrush by Nhich it was fringed. At length he reached the little vine trbor, which Nelly, with a natural taste for the beautiful, had brmed between the cabin and the forest; but finding it unoc- upied, he again passed on, and only paused when under the window of Richard Huse's humble dwelling. Raising his ands, he parted the clinging vines from the small window, and eered curiously in upon the inmates. But the rustling of the ines, or the blossoms showering down from the contact, ttracted the -attention of the farmer; but after a brief in- section through the open door, he relaxed again into the alf slumber from which the noise had aroused him. The lood flushed to the face, and neck, and bosom of Nelly Huse, Id then receded, leaving her colorless as marble. Still she   OR THE WORLD FROM IMY WINDOW.       19 plied her knitting needles with as m ch avidity as if life and death depended upon the immediate completion of her task; yet her eyes rested on the vines at the window, among which she could plainly distinguish the hideous face of Oneacta, as he still kept his post in imperturbable silence. At length, rising from her work, and passing the light around the face of her father to ascertain if he were indeed asleep, with a hasty, yet tremulous step she reached the door, and in another mo- ment was joined by the daxrk-visaged man. A flash of tri- umphant power rested for a moment upon his dark face, and passing his arm around her slender waist, he was upon the point of touching her lips; but with a haggard attempt to smile, she wrung her head from under his arm with such force that her beautiful hair became disengaged from its bondage, and swept down in tangled masses over her neck and bosom. "Nelly-!" he exclaimed, and his keen eyes fastened upon her with such fierce malice, breaking up through their tender- ness, that she shuddered from head to foot, and leaned against the door sill for support. "Not now! not here!'" she whispered, pointing to where her father slumbered; "to-morrow -  next week--but O, not now! not here " and again the blood swept like a surge of fire over her features. "The old tune," muttered the baffled'man; " not nw- not here - next week. Nelly Huse, do you know what it is to love-not tamely, and meekly, and hopefully, like your woman lovers- but to love as the lightning loves the tree it blasts - as the whirlwind loves the forest it levels- as I love you?" and he bent over her face as if he would therein read the secret of her soul, but his huge form intercepting the light, prevented his observing how pale and distorted it was. ^dt &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7934-00000011"/> 20     HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, "Come, girl, come; don't be frightened; " and he clasped her hand firmly in his own, and led her almost unconsciously down the little footpath towards the river. For a moment she seemed t have lost all power of feeling; then a sense of her danger burst upon her, and with a half-suppressed scream she bounded from his embrace, and fled like a frightened deer towards the cabin. He called to her, but she did not heed his voice; he threatened her, but to no purpose; he commanded, but in vain. Your brother!" he shouted, with a mocking laugh, which echoed unpleasantly through the forest, and as ff an arrow had reached her heart, she paused, wavered, and then fell senseless upon the ground. "Humph!" hemuttered; "I thought I would bring you to your senses; ' and he walked leisurely up the path to where Nelly lay among a bed of crushed and tangled vines which she had borne down in her fall. Far up the cliff, Henry Huse stood gazing upon the scene be- low, trembling in every limb with rage and indignation, yet not daring to advance a single step to aid his sister. He knew the malignant temper of Oneacta, and judged too truly that the slightest alarm to him would prove the death knell to his pow- erless victim. And Nelly Huse -what had she, the pure and gentle girl, in common with that fierce and repulsive man? A strange and undefined pang shot through the heart of Hen- ry, as he saw Oneacta raise the pale face to his own - a feel- ing of anger and jealousy, it might be, that the only love he had ever recognized should be so insulted and degraded. Almost rudely he put the arms of the Indian girl from about his neck, and sprang from rock to rock with the agility of a hound in full chase. There was a sensation of fear, indigna- tion, and surprise in the heart of Namaocre, as she bent over   OR THE WORJLD FROM IY WINDOwV.     21 the projecting rock, and gazed eagerly up and down the val. ley, and across the river, to the encampment of her tribe. All at once those wild dark eyes kindled with a new radiance, and she leaped back from the cliff, and turned into the wood' where the underbrush was so thick that i was almost impos- sible to force a passage through it. Scarcely had she con- cealed herself, when there was a cracking of branches-in-the path above her, a rushing sound of hoofs, and the next instant a daring and venturous horsewoman reined back her horse upon the very brink of the deep and rocky gorge. With-a bold, clear glance she took in the range of the chasm as one accus- tomed to danger, gave an encouraging shout to her steed, and cleared it with a single bound. Dashing down the opposite ravine, she paused for a moment at the river's bank. The waters were heaving and swollen by the recent floods, while here and there the strong tide had swept over the banks, and up the beach, leaving the soil loose and unsafe. On the op- posite side'the canoe of Oneacta lay moored among the alders. A moment after there was the plashing of oars, and it shot out into the middle of the river, impelled by the strong arm of its owner, while prostrate upon a bed of furs lay the still senseless form of Nelly Huse. "The villain! the villain!" muttered the rider, and sud- denly jerking the bit, she dashed into the swollen waters, and, swaying the horse around, was at the side of the boat before Oneacta was aware of her proximity. Bending over the saddle, she gathered her strong arm around the waist of Nel- ly, and before the captor could guess her motive, was fast nearing the valley shore. "Stop!" thundered Oneacta, levelling his gun, and taking sure aim at the rider and her charge. A laugh of scornful  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7934-00000012"/> 22     HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, defiance was her only reply, and the next moment her horse was struggling up the opposite embankment. After two or three ineffectual efforts with his fowling piece, Oneacta threw it into the river, and hastened on with speed to the Indian Bluff.  "It is her triumph to-day, curse her; it will be mine to- morrow!" -he muttered, as he lifted the heavy skins from the door of a wigwam, and joined the group of savages around the watchfire. The fresh air from the water had somewhat restored the con- sciousness of Nelly by the time her protectress had reached the skirts of the Valley Farm, but not sufficiently to enable her to comprehend why she was there, away from her home so late in the evening, or who the rude, half savage could be that had defended her. Gaining the edge of the clearing, the rider dismounted, and placing her charge under the shelter of a I willow, brought water from the river with which to bathe her face and neck. Slowly and by degrees the blue eyes opened, S and gazed around in silent wonder. The woman, from some  : instinctive feeling that her presence would only alarm the i timid girl, had crept up under the shadow of a heap of brush- wood, where she could note every passing change without her- : self being seen. Gradually the incidents of the past hour - came freshy into her mind. Oneacta's threats, his power of a executing them, his mad love for her, and her repulsion to him, and then, the memory of her brother came like a strain of music amid the crashing of some grand discord -- his mem- ory, and with it a sentiment which she dared not attempt to an- S alyze,- which even the knowledge that he was her brother could-not subdue. From whence it had its source, or to what it might tend, she could not imagine; so long as he was free,   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.       23 free to protect her exclusively, she was happy; but to share his love with another-to feel that another had usurped her throne in his heart -- that way lay madness. It could be nothing but a sister's love, and yet--and yet --she would not think of it - would marry Oneacta to prove to her own mind that destiny had not reserved for her the fate of such a love. So she reasoned as she sat beneath the glance of a pair of eyes of whose presence she was all-unconscious. "I can- not--cannot marry that fiend," she exclaimed, giving pas- sionate vent to her wild thoughts. "Do not," exclaimed a voice by her side, while a strong arm fell heavily upon her shoulder. Nelly looked up, and a strange figure, dressed after the fashion of the savages,- though the face betrayed none of their peculiarities, - stood before her. Nelly's first impulse was to escape and fly from her; but there was shining through the masculine features a good-humored pleasantness which disarmed her at once of fear. "Do not marry Oneacta," she replied; " do not! Better tear your heart out, and give it to the forest beasts, than be- come the wife of that devil! Better be trampled to death by wild horses, or sent into eternity by the flash of a spring. gun, than to marry--marry! ha, ha, ha! marry Oneacta!  Be true to yourself--to your instincts of hatred for him, and love for your brother!"' and with these words the exultant spirit died out of the eyes of the strange woman, and her harsh voice grew soft and tremulous, as if some chord was stirred which had long ceased to vibrate. "There - there - there!" she murmured, pushing back [he long braids of hair fromn her face; "I was almost a woman lien; but now' I am  "  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7934-00000013"/> H      BRIOUME SUCENES s ANU DHOJME S5OUNUiSN Who?" exclaimed Henry, who had joined them unper- ceived. "The Wild Eagle of the Wyoming- with the life, and soul, and fire of a dozen women nerving this strong arm -with the strength, and will, and determination of a host of puny, helpless females burning in this high heart! - ha, ha, ha!- following my own impulses, clambering over mountains, leap- ing ravines, shouting defiance to that society which would keep the tastes, and thoughts, and feelings down like chained and fettered captives! and you, Henry Huse -you see I know you - ah, do I not? You, with every nerve quivering with power and freedom, with every drop of blood leaping in ex- ultant life, to think that they could tame you down to a toiling, plodding slave! I told them the eagle would be still an eagle though his wings were clipped!" and placing her hand under his chin, she lifted up the surprised face of H1nry till there was scarcely room for the flitting of a breeze between their lips. Henry endeavored to release himself, but he was as a reed in her strong clasp. Every thing strong and powerful, every thing new or novel, had a peculiar charm for his wild nature; so, with an expression of admiration, he allowed her to scrutinize with curious minuteness every feature of his speaking face. "The same proud bearing - the same lofty spirit!" she exclaimed in joyous glee. "My brave boy-- my beautiful bah! stuff and nonsense!" she muttered, changing her manner  and pushing him almost fiercely away, she gave a low, sweet whistle, which brought her horse ambling to her side.  So ho, beauty!" said she, as with almost human in- stinct he laid his head upon her neck, and suffered her to take fs    ,       . fejs           w   uK TUHE WORLD FROM: MEY WINDOW.     25 his nose in her large, brawny hand. "So ho, beauty! What, you don't like strangers, eh? Well, we'll be off into the woods again; and bending over Nelly, she whispered in her ear, "Love your brother Fear nothing; I can and will pro- tect you both;" and springing into the saddle, she dashed mad- ly down the bank, forded the river, and was soon seen, in the moonlight, climbing up the jagged rocks upon the other side. Once more upon the cliff; she paused as if to breathe her horse, and flinging back a mocking shout, turned into the forest, and was soon lost to view among the heavy foliage. CHAPTER 'II. JusT upon the bank of the Susquehanna where the river takes a bold sweep round the foot of the mountain, a little cottage of superior finish nestled away under the thick leaves like a tired bird. The interior presented a display of luxurious ease, in those days a novelty in that portion of the country. Gorgeous carpeting, with its tufted bloom, was spread out in ostentatious display upon the small rooms which characterized the dwelling. Heavy damask curtains, depending from rings of gold, fell in heavy masses of drapery to the carpet, relieved only by opposite folds of white embroidery, which swept like drifting snow over the windows to find a resting-place in their embrasure.  Tastefully wrought ottomans and lounges were strewn in careless confusion around the room, while glimps of a conservatory, and the more-palpable plaint of culled\ flowers, told of a sensuous temperament somewhere among that mass of ostentatious display. All the minutiae of European luxury was visible in that little wood nest, and yet its inhab- 3  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7934-00000014"/> 26     HOME SCENES AND 'HOME SOUNDS, 9 itants were miserable even in their exclusive splendor. Beau- tiful-beautiful as a dream was the mistress of this sylvan abode. Let us look at her as she sits there in the embrasure of the window, gazing out upon the still water, as it lies like a sheet of silver just beneath her window. Is she not beautiful, as she sits there, so eloquent even in her silence, her elbow rest- ing upon the sill, her rounded arm rising from the draperied sleeve, while a gush of light from yonder sunset cloud sweeps over her dark hair -all the darker for the contrast--and flooding down seenms to find a temporary resting-place upon the shoulders, shaded, but not concealed, by a veil of azure lace? She is indeed a study for an artist's soul, - a dream for an artist's heart, - an inspiration for an artist's pencil,- and no wonder that the heart of Lucus Dale should have gone out in admiration for her superior loveliness. The face of the young enthusiast, though not strikingly handsome, was one, once seen, to be remembered forever, for the wealth of mind and thought therein contained. His brow, wide and massive, was relieved by thick masses of waving hair, which was al- lowed to fall almost upon his shoulders. His eyes were dark, full, and earnest, yet at times vivid with flashes of intellectual power, which sent a strange thrill to the heart of those who encountered their gaze. The arching brow, the compressed lips, and more than all, the head, with its bold outlines of in- dividuality, shadowed forth the silent grandeur of intellect; The shadows were beginning to creep together around the cottage; yet still, absorbed in a delicious revery, he sat, drink- Lng in the exquisite loveliness of his charming hostess, forget- ing the presence of a third party, from whose keen eye and keener perception nothing was allowed to escape - the hus. land of Leoline Lemnare,   OR THE WORLD FROMT MY WINDOW.       27 "I should think you were painting Leoline's portrait," broke in that individual's voice in a tone of pleasant raillery. Come, let me see what progress you have made." The blood surged up to the temples of the young artist, and he. stammered an awkward rejoinder, which was lost upon-the ear of Leoline. "Come, Leoline, let him have a fair view of that bewitch- ng face of yours. It has done good service before to-day, Lueus." Leoline started up with an impetuosity which sent the black urls quivering over her neck and shoulders, while a fierce ook of disgust broke over her splendid features. "There's an attitude, Lucus; the indignant beauty, or the 'ishonored wife" he hissed in her ear, while his face was Urned smilingly towards the artist. Lucus caught the low 7ords, and pained for her and angered for himself, he gathered p his drawing materials to cover his confusion, and soon assed from the room. Well!"  said Lemure in a mocking tone, after a few mo-' ents' silence. Leoline did not reply, though she suddenly .  lised her eyes, blazing with defiance, to meet his cool, sarcastic ance.  Soon, however, she turned away, and again bent her iad forward, and rested it upon her hand, in an attitude of ter dejection.  He arose unperceived, and stood looking ,wn upon her with folded alms. Well for her after peace uld she have seen the dark, fierce, malignant frown which rouded his features. She did not raise her eyes, or turn her ce from its averted glance; yet she became aware that his es were on her- powerful, steady, and piercing. She could t  resist their influence. There was a mesmeric force in eir cold glance, which fascinated and subdued her. She felt  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7934-00000015"/> her strength leaving her, and with the strong effort of a strong will, she arose, still averting her face, anid passed' on to the door ; but her husband's strong arm was on her shoulder, and his greenish-blue animal eyes piercing into her own. "Leoline!" he murmured, in tones so soft and low that it seemed impossible for them to convey aught but pleasant meaning. "Well," she replied, wringing her small hand from the broad palm in which it was crushed. "I know your purpose!  Give Lucus but one hint of my suspicion, and that hint will ring his death knell! You know me, Leoline!" Leoline shrank but one instant from his gaze, and then re- covering herself, she raised her head proudly and steadily to meet his burning glance. "And what of yotr suspicion?" she questioned, proudly. With an expression of disgust he flung the hand which he had again prisoned from his vice-like grasp. "Pshaw!" he muttered; "to think what you were when I married you.!" The shadow which had been gathering upon the face of Leo- line darkened and deepened upon her brow. s"What I was!" she muttered, while irrepressible scorn distorted her beautiful lips; "I was a pure-minded, unsophis- ticated girl. I am a woman desperate, reckless, vitiated; with the degradation of years burning into my brain, until every vestige of purity has been charred and smouldered out of it; with the memory of past wrongs ploughing into my heart, until every principle of virtue and religion has been rooted from its soil, and I abhor the thing I am less than I tremble for what I may become." ,            I      .   OR THE WORLD FROM   IY WINDOW .    29 The sentiments of her soul burst forth, wild, passionate, tu- multuous, yet still her tormentor bent his cold, steady glance upon her. "You love Lucus Dale! Is it so, Leoline?" he murmured at last. "Love him!" she exclaimed passionately, clasping her hands; then, as if conscious of betraying more than she de- sired, she turned from him, and paced the floor for some mo- ments in agitation. Lemnure leaned against the corner of the mantel-piece with folded arms, gloating upon the anguish which he knew his words had occasioned. "Well, Leoline," he questioned, in a soft, quiet voice, you do not answer me: you love him?" "Love him!" she gasped, turning quickly round, revealing a face whereon grief, affection, and remorse were visibly war- ring.  Love Lucus Dale? You know I loved him as the flowers love the sunshine. Yqu know it - yet when you saw me dazzled and bewildered -when you felt that there could be nothing but scorn and loathing in my heart for you, you prepared the altar - mockingly prepared it - upon which my happiness, honor, integrity were to have been sacrificed! You bought me, as you would have purchased a slave in the market; haggled, bartered for me, and bought me, that you might torture and kill me - that you might quench the fire in my heart in the tears of blood wrung from its inmost core! .0, man, man!  she exclaimed, in passionate wildness, "that I should so have read yotur purpose; so defined your motives; and that even now, knowing you base and vile beyond the power of words to tell, I should still endure - must still endure your presence!" "Have you done?" questioned her husband, still leaning listlessly against the mantel-piece. 3*  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7934-00000016"/> 80     HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, "Why have you brought that man here?  A devil could not have devised more cruelty Now listen to me. When I tell you of a face whose every feature is life,:hope, religion, to me; when I tell you of a voice whose every tone vibrates to my heart till it shudders with its burden of sinful joy; when I tell you, my husband, how I have yearned for the sunlight of that face, so dear to me from childhood - for the echo of that voice, so full of music to me, and loathed myself for yearning; think for how much of my sin you are responsible, for how much of my degradation you are the cause, and loath yourself as I do!" "Have you done?" again questioned her husband, with smil- ing indifference. "To think that I should have become your slave!" she re- sumed ; "to think I should have been sold to gratify your passion and your pride! The one being extinguished, nothing has been left me, in all these long years, but to pander to the other. I have been set up as a mark of admiration for the basest of your class, in your European home. I have been compelled to witness the grossest debaucheries, to listen tamely to the most licentious words, to frown down the most loathsome sensuality, and to think that even here, in the wil- derness, with little but savage life around me - that even here, your persecutions must follow me -that I should find him here, under my very roof-- and I tell you now, as I told you at the altar ten years ago, that I loathe you from my inmost soul; that I loathe myself for this degradation; that I loathe you as its instrument; and that I only live to suffer the an- guish I endure but from a curiosity to see how far your fiend- ish arts can extend!" Her lips quivered and compressed, and she passed her hand   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.      81 over her brow, as if to dissipate some pain that was throbbing there. "Audacious " he muttered, arousing somewhat from his lethargy; and yet the smile which accompanied his words was any thing but a scornful or a threatening one. He was amused at the display of spirit and energy which he thought extin- guished in Leoline's breast. "So you loathe me, lady mine?" he questioned, moving nearer to the seat she had taken by the window. "Ido " she exclaimed, flashing back scorn for sarcasm. "And you own your love for the gentle artist?" and a low, mocking laugh sounded unpleasantly through the room. "Don't exasperate me!" she exclaimed, springing up and confronting him, while her fingers quivered over the half- drawn dagger concealed beneath her scarf; " don't exasperate me! I am half a devil--all a woman! God in heaven! You have broken my heart, maddened my brain, and yet you live- live like a viper, stinging every thing to death which comes within your coils!" She lifted her proud, grace- ful head, to scrutinize, if possible, the workings of the mind in that passionless face; but a simple smile was all that met her gaze. Turning from him, she bent again upon her hand, and in the conflicting passions of the moment had nearly forgotten his presence, when a soft voice whispered in her ear,- "Mine forever; you cannot escape me!" Leoline heard the words, and turned upon him a look so full of unutterable anguish, that for a moment a feeling of com- punction swept across the breast of her husband. He took her passive hand in his; she did not struggle. There was nei-  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7934-00000017"/> 82    HHOMhtE SCENES AND HOAME SOUNDS, ther motive nor energy left. He sank down on an ottoman b) her side, and gazed admiringly into her sad, dreamy face.  , "Leoline," said he, looking steadfastly the while in her eyes, with a fixed and piercing glare. The hand of death seemed upon her heart. She trembled in every limb, and yet no an- swer came from her lips tIt was strange, the mesmerism of thoselarge azure eyes. No wonder Leoline shrank beneath their power, for in after ages they became a fable, a mystery, a spell which neither man's honor nor woman's virtue could withstand.. They made a flame for their possessor, a fame which left. a blot upon the pages of our nation's history. They possessed a power which incited the savages to rebellion, won a warm) fresh heart to treasonable purposes, and heaped the sods upon a traitor's grave. Woe-- woe indeed to the man or woman on whom they rested for evil; for resist- ance was'vain, useless, and absurd. This Leoline knew, and for this she hated herself. "-We will have no more scenes after this," he murmured in her ear, in accents soft as if the words were couched in ten- derness. "I say, we will have no more scenes, Leoline. Look at me -look in my eyes, and see if I will not be obeyed. Now I shall leave you for a while. I have business up at the camp on the mountain, and when I return, let me see smiles -do you hear, Leoline?"  She nodded assent, and kissing her hand, he arose gracefully, and passed from the rooQ. As he closed the door, she sprang from her seat like an enraged tiger, and held her hand from her, as if his kiss had burned into the flesh. After pacing the floor for a quarter of an hour, she flung herself into the chair again, and gave angry vent to her bitterness. 6s His will - his will!:" she murmured.

When he is away, I feel the force and, power of a strong, fierce spirit; and then, when most I determine to brave every thing but his presence, lie comes back again, with his basilisk eyes, to madden me." Again she relapsed into- silence, while her eyes seemed burning into the river, so intense aws their gaze riveted upon it. She sat there with her pale, cold face propped up willh her hands, till the last gush of bird song had died away ini the wilderness; she sat there till the night had closed in upon the forest, and veiled the river with a sheet of stars;  she sat there, a prey to contending emotions, until a light hand rested upon her shoulder, and a sad, loving face was side by side with her own. Lucus had entered the room unperceived ---iad watched her agdny wildly and remorsefully, as one whose dark life had been made more dark by his unintentional means - had gazed upon her until his heart was dead to every other impulse, thought, or object, but the memory of that splen- did. woman, so wretched amid the luxury of her outward life; he gazed upon her until he forgot honor, principle, every thing, but the abused wife-- the bride of' his youth thus wrest- ed from him; and with these feelings he had dared to clasp her hands, as in happier dcays--to smooth back the dark curls and press her lips,.as if no barrier had intervened to shut him out from his dearest hlopes.

Last week, I met Lemure, as I said before, at the settlement down by the lower bend of the Susquehanna. He urged, pleaded, insisted, that. I should accompany him home. I did so; and what was my surprise and grief to find you the wife of my supposed friend! I read his purpose at once. I was to be used as an additional instrument of torture in his hands for your misery. I remained, for I hoped by doing so to release you from your fearful bondage; land now, Leoline " She pressed her hands over her eyes, as if to shut out the horrible reality. "And now, Lucus," she exclaimed, with unaccustomed ear- nestness, listen to me - to me, Lucus - and obey me in all things, as you hope for your happiness or my salvation. Yoa must not stay here - must not. Do you understand? The same roof must not shelter us; the same spot of land must not be the home of each; the same country must not contain us. I can bear taunts, scoffs, or unkindfess in any form, but not dishonor. O God! no--not dishonor! and, loving you as I do, that must be my fate unless the ocean divides us." Leoline wrenched her hands from his clasp, and paced up and down the room in wild agitation. "To think," she exclaimed, bitterly, "that in all these years I should have borne with his excesses and abuses; to think that I should have allowed him to torture my heart and tram. ple it down into the dust until every true and generous feeling   ,  5   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.      85 was crushed out of it; to think I should have thus suffered patiently, and with slavish servility, and that this, this should be my rewarld f" Still her lover kept his position at the window, without an attempt to subdue her agitation. "A life without love--a world without sunshine! No hope - no aim - no object - nothing but a dark, weary pil- grimage till I find rest in the grave! All this misery has that fiend wrought for me; and yet I calmly, patiently bow my head to the earth, and allow him to place his foot upon my neck." "Leoline," whispered her lover, gathering his arms around her; but she sprang from their embrace. "Don't touch mie--don't! I am not Leoline! There is nothing left of Leoline but a mass of terrible passion--of dangerous and distorted energy -of sayage and ungovernable :impulses. And I tell you now, that loving you as I do, till love has become my devotion, I would sooner die at once than yield to despair what I could not give to honor." "Leoline /" I do love you intensely, unutterably; and if I could know that instead of my blighted life there were a thousand years of happiness in stoie for me, and that happiness could be com- pressed into one hour's bliss for you, I would yield it up, and die in your arms to prove how 'much I love; but, if I were standing on the verge of a precipice, where one step would plunge me into eternal perdition, I would take that step sooner than your memory should be tainted with my dishonor. Now, go!- go!-go!" she exclaimed wildly, waving. her arms, and sinking upon a lounge, she burst into a flood of passionate tears.   &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7934-00000019"/> {iD   HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, It was not in man's nature, at least in the nature of' the en- thusiastic artist, to comply with a request which bore so faint an impress of sincerity. He fnew that even while she spoke, her inclination had belied her word; he knew, had she given sway to her impulse, she would have thrown herself into his arms, and wept herself to sleep, like a tired child. For a moment he kept his station at the window, gazing upon the beautiful woman, so humbled in her'pride.' Quick, heavy gusts of pas- sion swept up from her heart, with mournful anguish, and passed away to be succeeded by others of still greater inten- sity. It was a bitter sight to the man whose life and happi- ness were wrapped up in the throbbing bosom which came struggling into light, as the tempest-waves warrings beneath it surged up in their fury, and then receded to gather greater force. At length the storm passed, leaving a dead, heavy calm, more fearful to behold, even, than the preceding tempest. Her eyelids drooped down, and lay lke a beautiful fiinge upon the snow beneath them. Her breathing became pore regular and quiet; her lips parted, while a half smile broke up over her fade, making it radiant and beautiful. Her lover stepped noiselessly to her side, and took the small hand which had fallen over the lounge. It was dry and feverish. He bent above her, and lifted up the tangled curls from her face, that the air might revive her. A name - his name - low, and soft, and musical, rippled from her liips, blended with words of tenderness and devotion, such as only find their strength within a woman's heart. He forgot every thing which he ought most to have remembered-duty, honor, reason, every -thing but the woman before him - the dream of his boyhood, the ideal of his later years. She was by his side--the        .,   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.       87 woman whose slightest look would. send the blood surging through his heart like ocean waves, whose lightest word could lift the lid from the sepulchre wherein was buried the beautiful and trusting past. YIte gathered his strong arms about her, and, raising her head from its recumbent position on the lounge, laid it gently on his own bosom. For a moment, the gentle, pleading eyes unclosed, and gazed ear- nestly up into his own, as if endeavoring to recall something which their owner had forgotten: The memory came soon enough for her peace, and, looking wildly around, she endeav- vred to release herself from his embrace. "Are you mad?" she exclaimed, still struggling for liberty. "No, Leoline; not mad--not now. I have been mad; but it was the madness of a warm, fresh heirt, that risked all upon one throw of the dice, and - lost the trick! I was mad then; but now, like a desperate gambler, I can see only my own wealth wrested from me by villany and artifice, and so seeing, claim it at all hazards."

She gazed upon him sadly and mournfully; not as the des- perate man, urging her to her own dishonor, but as the warm- hearted, generous youth, whom her falsehood and deceit had driven from his home and country, with a. blighted spirit for his only companion. She folded her hands over his arms, and looked pleadingly up into his quiet face. He did not repulse. her now; for he could feel the low, faint throbbings of her heart as it beat, against his breast. 4 Do, do speak to me," she murmured, through her tears.

The moon went down the sky, and the midnight shadows of the woods deepened upon the river; but a darker shadow had fallen upon the soul of Leoline. The storm clouds drifted like contending armies athwart the sky; the winds moaned and sobbed throughout the wilderness, like troubled spirits seeking for rest; but a wilder, deeper, blacker desolation had settled upon the heart of' Leoline; and over the juttinfig rocks, and through the wilderness, and all along the valley, lay a shadow and a gloom ; and still the voice of the gathering storm came sighing and shrieking along the forest paths, and still the form of Leoline Lemure lay cradled in the arms of her lover, regardless of the livid flashes of lightning which at intervals brightened up the gloom and the shadow. A crash of unusual power startled them from their security. Leoline arose, and passing to the window, parted the curtains, and gazed out into the darkness. It was a wild scene which met her view - wild as the dream of a maniac ! Dark piles of storm clouds lay tier upon tier all around the horizon, while from a rift in their chain the moon occasionally struggled through with dis- colored and spectral light.

See how it shoots up and hangs over the valley farm! There is doom in it--doom for one or both of you! How it blackens and darkens, like an evil spirit sent out to capture and destroy!" A heavy peal of thunder came crashing among the rocks, losing itself in echoes; then another and another, till the whole horizon seemed filled with blaze and tumult. Leoline's bosom throbbed with strange awe ; her breath cam'e in hurried and murmured gasps, as, leaning from the window, she gazed up into the sky, so filled with light and shadow. Again the thunder vibrated through the wilderness, while lofty forest trees and huge masses of rock came crashing down into the river, which glittered like a jet band by the edge of the valley. The flashes of lightning and the heavy peals of thunder were now becoming incessant. The spirit of the storm was upon them; yet still, with flashing eyes and throbbing bosom, the wild woman, more fearful even than the tempest, stood leaning against a tall- tree, looking up among the drifting clouds.

These were the words, long days and years ago, when a father's curse rung in my ears -when a mother's corpse was cold and dead before me. And now I come like the storm and the whirlwind, and pass away again, and no one knows whither. I confront him, and he knows me not.

Leoline fell upon her knees in wild dismay; another and another gleam of light filled the room, followed by heavy crashes of thunder; and when the tumult died away, a lifeless corpse was all that remained of Lucus Dale, the artist lover of the dishonored wife.

Still the sound.. advanced, moaning and crackling, and the next moment the entire build- ing was in a light blaze! It needed no second word-- no second look. The lightning had caught in a room filled with combustible matter, and the whole building was encircled by smoke, and illumined by the glare. of the raging flames. Higher and higher they shot up among the black clouds, making " diness visible." They glimmered upon the forest leaves, and cat fantastic figires upon the swollen waters; yet Leline heeded not the warning. Why should she? Her hearts-ould never know an anguish after what had passed. It had turned to stone. "Up, girl- up!" shouted the strange woman, in a voice of thunder. 'This is no time for useless repinings. See, the very heavens are kindling into flood and flame. Up, and away, or the next moment will be your last." Leoline did not heed her words, but clung closer to the dead bosom beneath her arms. A heavy crash .esounded through the burning building; the staircase had ygven way, and the whole body of flame came surging into the room. The woman sprang in, and with one arm wound around the waist of Leoline, disengaged her friom the form to which she clung with desperate madness.

She gained the summit of the hill and sped like an'arrow through the arching limlbs of the age-bowed trees. Once more she turned to look upon the burning building, while the sinews and cords of her face swelled and writhed with the intense excitement of the scene. The smoke concealed the dwelling like a  pall of death, but the sky above seemed glimmering with red and forked flame. She seemed rooted to the spot by some strange infatuation. SShe looked down upon the helpless, woman in her arms, and a   smile of derision swept over her features as she mur- mured,   "The day of retribution is at hand!

The rich light bursts through the gloom of the forest --it trembles upon the bosom of the river-it drifts down the valley, and up the rocky cliff - it falls upon 4the figure of a muscular, broad-chested man, tall, dark-visaged, and athletic, who, with a satisfied air, stood gazing upon the yeP burning embers of his wildwood home. Satisfied with his inspection, he moves leisurely down the hill, and pauses by the smouldering ruins. He casts a hurried look among the remnants of smoking timber and piles of ashes. His face grows pale and white, for a skeleton, stark and fleshess, meets his earnest gaze. A remnant of wo- man's apparel drifts from the embers, and he recognizes it as his wife's!

Tile warbling birds, the bright- lipped wers, the very air, coming so fresh and perfume- laden, med trying to make amends for the destruction of the stoem king. All the long night there had been the voice of prayer within the cottage of farmer Huse; and now that the tempest was past, the good man did not forget to return thanks for the preservation of himself and those who were dearer even than himself. Nelly opened the windows of the cottage, and looked out upon the wreck of the storm. The neat little fence was rent and battered into the earth. The vines and flowers about the garden were all crushed and beat down, and the honeysuckle, which had been her peculiar pride, lay in a tangtled mass all  along the edge of the cottage, and under the windows where they had been taught to climb. A shadow of deep sadness    i lay upon her beautiful face, and the tears crept unbidden into  j her eyes. "Why, Nelly," exclaimed a  pleasant voice; "is this your  philosophy?   Mourning for your vines and flowers?" and the arm  of her brother encircled her small waist, while the disengaged hand went straying up among her curls. A sweet, hopeful smile sprang to her face, and she proffered her- lips for the usual morning kiss. Suddenly she started from his side -  the blood surged up and retreated -and to cover her unaccountable confusion, she took the little pail from the table, and darted out into the worn path leading to the gushing rivulet by the edge of the clearing. Henry followed her with his eyes until her form was lost among the thick bushes, and then turned moodily from the window. "What the deuse ails Nelly, lately?" he muttered. "No  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7934-00000025"/> L6     HOME SCUiENES AND HMUiJL V bVUTi1U3 more confidences--no more pleasant chats--no more ranm- bles. What the deuse ails her? I must have offended her without knowing it. Can it be that -  But, no, no! She could not form an attachment to such a fiend; besides, if she were to marry - marry! i- Nelly marry!" He paused and leaned his chin thoughtfully upon the gun he had appropriated for his morning sport. "Nelly marry!" he mused. "And yet, why not? Sister-my sister-and yet, when I think that her love may be given to another, my heart throbs as if it were dying, and it wozdd die if she were to leave me. My sister - sister, let me remember that." His countenance suddenly resumed an expression of tender regret- of half- formed memory, it might have been, struggling through the mist of years. This tender emotion held possession of his soul but for a moment. "It is strange," he continued; "it comes to me like a dream. I feel it in the presence of that wild woman of the valley - something pleasant, yet indistinct, and some time I shall surprise her, and myself, by catching her in my arms and giving her a tremendous hug-I know I shall - I feel it in my bones; and that would be a pretty piece of folly. My sister! So like and yet so unlike me. The same intense eyes characterize us both; but hers are quiet in their in'tensity, while mine only kindle into flame amid the scenes of grandeur and of gloom; the sanle individualities of soul unite us, yet, while hers marks out a quiet existence among her birds and flowers, mine only springs into actual life amid the roaring of the elements, the crashing of the storm - it may exist for the few hours necessary for home requirements and home pursuits, but it exults, expands, bounds into a higher, broader, stronger life, when out upon the hills and rocks, listening to the grand diapason of the   storm king's melody. The sunshine and the melody for her - the shadow and the gloom for me; and yet-- and yet I need her gentle sympathy, as the old gray rocks need the loving moss clinging about them. I cannot understand it- I cannot--I love her -my sister; as I have dreamed the angels love their God - exclusively, unutterably. Pshaw!" he muttered, clearing away the shadow of thought from his open, manly face; "I'll think no more of it. Whatever hap- pens - and God knows in this wilderness of a country there is danger enough at hand, - Nelly will find a strong arm and a stout heart to protect and defend her." And slinging the game bag over his shoulder, he raised the heavy gun as if it had been a willow sapling, and strode off to his sports upon the cliff. And Nelly-what of her? Down in the forest glade, where the sunlight never came to disturb the deep gloom, the holy quietude 'of that morning was broken by the low, faint sound of a woman's sigh. Re- clining by the brink of the spring, her cheek resting on her bent arm, the poor girl moaned and sobbed as if her heart was breaking. The wooden pail, brimming over with its sparkling wealth, sat unmolested by her side; the song birds  chirped in softened cadence, as if in sympathy with the grieved girl; but there was no sympathy in the wide world for a heart so utterly hopeless. She had gone down with desperate determination into the far-off depths of that heart; she had analyzed every impulse, dissected every feel. ing, and there learned that a love, the more fearful and in- tense for its very crime, was eating away every true and pure feeling of her life. She loved her brother; and O, horrible truth! not with the guileless, heavenly love, which is the char- acteristic of a sister's heart, but deeply, passionately, and with&#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7934-00000026"/> 50     HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, a desperate defiance of conscience, which was killing her day "by day. Down by the musical rivulet, out under the forest e shade, by her mother's grave, she- had knelt in utter abandon- ment of remorse and anguish ; but still that love haunted her like a demon, hunting her to destruction. To suffer for love is no uncommon fate; for since the world was made it has been the curse of hearts like hers to love and suffer; but such a love, and such depth-of suffering, are only reserved, thank God, for the few. Every man, woman, and child, has a destiny to work out; it is the legacy of our race, inherited from the gar- den of Eden. We may avoid it, - it follows us all the same ; we may struggle against it,--still it pursues us with its cling  ing coils; we may fight, defy, r'epulse it, and-submit to its power at last. Nelly had no alternative: she could but yield and - die. The sound of a horse's hoofs broke up the stillness of the forest glade, and dashing the tears from her eyes, Nelly arose and peered earnestly through the tangled branches. The crackling of bushes and the tumult of the tramping steed seemed fast approaching from the other side of the trees which shut her in. Her first thought was of Oneacta, and catching up the pail, with an impetuosity which sent its con- tents showering over the grass plot, she emerged from the woods, and darted up the valley towards the cottage. The old farmer was standing in the open door, with his hands deep buried in his capacious pockets, whistling a bit of a melody to: keep his temper under check. "So, ho! Here you are at last, eh, Nelly? Why, what the old boy is the matter with you? You are as pale as a water lily, only more paler;" and the intended scolding was forgot- ten, as he looked into her sad, earnest face. ' Nelly, what is the matter, girl?'

"Father, answer me truly and sincerely, for I cannot be- lieve it; is Henry Huse my brother?"

Farmer Huse had a   pair of lungs, at all events, if he had no other refinement. , "Father," exclaimed Nelly, wildly; "'it cannot, must not be." "What cannot be, and what must not be?

No, I never! Love himn!-of course you do-of course you do! You should love your brother." "Not as a brother do I love him; that's the agony!" mur- mured Nelly. Again the hearty laugh went rolling from the mouth of farmer Huse, as if the confession wrung from his daughter's heart was just about the funniest thing on record. Nelly gazed in wonder upon the old man. "You see, Nelly - ha, ha! - ho, ho! - you see this broth- er of yours is  " "Well, father; well!" "Hello! What's that?" he exclaimed, as a magnificent horse dashed through the opening in the forest. "Curse me if it isn't that damned wild woman. Lord forgive me for the relief of swearing. What the devil has she got in her arms now?" The rein was thrown loosely upon the horse's neck, for the arms of his rider encompassed 'the form of a fainting woman; but as if by instinct, or some mutual understanding, ,he came cantering across the clearing, and drew up at the door of the cottage. "Good morning, farmer," exclaimed the woman, sliding down from the horse; " good morning, Nelly. Why, you look   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW,       53 paler than this poor thing here on my arm, and God knows that's needless. Have you got a room to spare for the present, till something can be done for her? It is Lemure's wife," she muttered, exchanging glances with the farmer. "The light- ning scathed her cottage last night, and left her as you see her now. She has not opened her eyes since; but there's life enough left yet." Nelly led the way to a quiet room, away from the noise of the laborers. The farmer was following, but the wild woman pushed him back, laughingly. "Come," said she, go to work ; we don't want you to help us. What an old granny you would be if you could, wouldn't you, old fellow " "Well, I would," he replied, with a'very comical expression of face. But tell me  " "Nothing! There, shut up and clear out, will you? The woman may die while you are chattering;" and slamming the door in the face of the curious farmer, she laid her burden gen- tly upon the bed, and soon was repaid by seeing the languid eye unclose in consciousness. "Don't let her see me," she whispered; " it will only agitate her;" and moving to the door, she motioned Nelly, and again whispered, "Take care of her - guard her well - her destiny and yours are strangely in- terwoven. Tak'e care of her!" and gliding out, she leaped upon her horse, and cantered ,off to the edge of the for- est, where farmer Huse was now chopping away furiously. I-e heard her approach, and for a moment the bright axe was held suspended in the air above his head; then bringing it leisurely down, he suffered it to rest, with one foot upon the half-demolished log, till the hoofs of the horse were nearly trampling him down. 5   &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7934-00000028"/> i4    tHOME SCENES AND HOIME SOUNDS, "Take care!" he exclaimed, dropping the axe and scram- )ling out of the way.

"If you don't know any thing, you can't tell any thing." "' .Exactly," replied the farmer, -determined not to express too,great an anxiety. "And if I were to tell you, you would be as wise as I am." -Exactly; but I shan't tell if you explain, and I can't if you don't." ( Exactly," laughed the strange woman, imitating the bluff tone of the farmer, and giving her horse the rein, she was out of sight before he could make a second answer. He looked after her a moment, took up his axe, and run his finger/ over the edge to see that it had lost none of its keenness, and muttering, "Devil take that horse," began to cut away at the log again as calmly as if nothing had happened. CHAPTER   IV. THEE sun is sinking in the west, lighting up with its last beam the rocky grange and the linked mountains which guard the slumbering valley. Its beams tremble upon the forest leaves, and lie in little pools of gold upon the greensward. It spreads a gorgeous halo over the valley, and brightens up the humble dwelling of Richard Huse; and yet but one little week has passed since thati quiet valley was busy with fierce savages bent upon human life. The waving grass and the beautiful flowers are trampled alike into the groung, and one can almost scent the blood upon the evening air. What the   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW,       55 incentive for this strife had been, none knew, none could devise, save the wild woman, from whose keen glance even the secrets of the savage hearts were insecure. Jean Lemure held unbounded sway over the fierce tribe that were scattered over the, mountains. Jean Lemure'llad pleaded, and been re- fused-'had threatened and been defied; and with a feeling of wounded pride blazing along with the life current of his heart, he had wrought up the excitable savages to superhu- man and fiendish malignity. In the quiet of the night, cabin after cabin had been entered, and its unconscious and helpless inmates murdered in their slumber. So. quiet, so still had been the deed of blood performed, that not one voice, not one shriek startled the echo, or proclaimed to those around the fate of their friends and n ighbors. One cottage alone was. unmolested--that of Richard Huse.  And when morning came, the sturdy farmer stood beside the scene of blood dumb, and motionless with horror, while the very heavens were shrouded by thick clouds, and all the earth around grew more sad and silent for its burden of human gore. "It is a dream - a dream - a dream! he muttered, rub- bing his eyes, as if to assure himself of his own identity, t No, no! there are the dead bodies of my old friends, bun- dled together like so many logs! It is too terrible ---too ter- rible. Savage devils, I tell you this night's work of yourn must be paid for yet, in'good red blood L I alone will call for revenge,!" "And that call shall be answered, farmer Huse," said a voice at his side; and a tall, muscular man, in the dress of an Indian, stepped out from the shadow of the cabin. He raised his arm in solemn oath, and dropped it gently upon the. farm- er's shoulder.  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7934-00000029"/> 56     HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS,  "There are men, bold and brave, in the fastnesses of these mountains - men that will revenge this wrong, meet the mur- derers face to face, and exterminate this band of malignant savages.

"Nelly bltse," and the eyes of the speaker shot forth a strange, wild light. I have seen her - watched her - pro- tected her - loved her - no, not loved her - worshipped her as never before was woman worshipped, and she must be mine!"

Oneacta, take me! I cannot bring you love; but you have saved my father. My brother--I must not think of him!" she murmured, "or I shall grow mad again."  And turning to Oneacta, she placed her hands in his, while a con- vulsive shudder swept over her frame. The old man, too overcome to speak, or too agitated with the late fearful occurrences to reflect with any degree of judg- ment, hurried into the cabin, and buried his face mechanically in his hands, as if to shut out approaching thought. Still Nelly stood, with her hands clasped in those of the strange man, while her eyes seemed burning into the sod at her feet. His wild, fierce eyes were on her, and his voice melting into her heart; yet she could not have told one word he was say- ing.

His voice was sweet and musical, for it came drifting up from the pleasant memo- ries of the past. Do you remember it, Nelly?"' he repeated. "O, I cannot-cannot love you, Oneacta," she murmured. Regardless of her interruption, he continued:- "Crushed and mangled by the fallen tree which nearly proved my death, I was borne, I know not how, into the cot- tage on the Valley Farm. -It was night within and without; but the morning came, and in the dim light I saw a woman's form - so pale, so beautiful, so spirit-like in her quietude,. that I instinctively raised myself from the low couch, and gazed wonderingly at the lovely vision. Nelly, from that moment I loved you. Not as those love whose affections are nurtured. by habit, or grow into the spirit from infancy, but with a strength and brightness which sprang into my heart like a star, irradiating it with beauty and religion.

"Y,Yours I will be; but O, I cannot--cannot love you." "I know it/' he murmured.  "Could you but love me, there is not on earth a deed I would not dare for your sake -a danger I would not surmount-a tiriumph I would not achieve. Nelly, there are lands and halls far away over the wide waters, where the sunshine falls forever, and the flowers spring uncared for and unbidden. And I, the owner of those broad lands and princely halls, here clasp the unwilling hand of her who is the dearest thing to me out of heaven, and plead for a return of your affection."' , O, I cannot give it. It is not mine to give I " "I look upon your face with a sentiment I never knew until its beauty maddened me. I breathe words of passionate wildness into your ear, which never fell from my lips before into the ear of mortal woman. I plead with you for one glance of hope, as a murderer would plead, for his forfeited life; and yet in my heart, mingled with its love, is an awful will- a desperate resolve. You must be my wife! I I will! I promise you, by my hopes of that happiness hereafter which has been denied me on earth, to be yours- your wife - but'I cannot love you!" "Be it so," he murmured ; and for a moment Nelly felt his arm winding closer around her waist. She did not repulse him, but yielded tamely - hopelessly. Releasing her gently, and leading her to the door of the cottage, he raised her hand respectfully to his lips, caught her eye for a moment, and dis- s appeared as noiselessly as he had come.

"'I CANNOT love him--O, I cannot!" murmured poor Nelly Huse, as she tottered slowly forward, with an unsteady  gait, and sunk helplessly at the feet of her father. "M My poor girl," he replied, "'my poor Nelly. There, dry your dear wet eyes; you shall not b6 a sacrifice to save my life. It is not that, Nelly; but what would become of you if I were gone? Alone in the wilderness -- alone with the sav- ages, and in the power of that man, who would make you his wife, but so failing, would only stop short of devilish inhu- manity to make you his slave." Not that, father," exclaimed Nelly, ip a tone of proud de- fiance. "Neliy Huse, weak girl that she is, could defend her honor from fifty such menz as is Oneacta. But father, who is this man? 'He dresses like the M3ohawks, and yet his clear, white skin and wild blue eyes forbid the thought that he is of their race. His la1nguage, too, is eloquent and refined; so' soft and musical that but for an impulsive fear, which I can- not comprehend, he would force me to love him; for if ever man worshipped woman, Oneacta worships my poor self. Who is he?" "A mystery, and almost a shadow. I only know his power with the Indian tribes which infest the country here- about is unlimited.

Her gaze became riveted--her bosom heaved with aconvulsive throb.  \ "Nelly!" xclaimed the father, following the direction of her eyes. It was morning, and the glad sun and the free ail mingled dreamily together around and upon the meadow; -and lighter than the freshibreeze, and happier even than the wild birds around them, came the forms of Henry Huse and NIamaocre, sauntering leisurely towards the cabin. !"What can this mean, I wonder?" queried the surprised / farmer, as Henry with his pretty charge entered the door of the dwelling, and' drew her trustingly to his bosom. "It- means," replied Henry, "that I have brouglit you another daughter; I hav6 brought Nelly a sister. Will you love- her, Nelly?" "Love her!" she echoed in bewildered tones. "Love her- teach her to love you. -She has every thing to learn. I wet her in the forest day after day and week after . week, and this morning, with the view of murder before me, I sought the camp of the Mohawk chief, and urged my claims to his-child." "And he"             '  "Here is his answer!" and Henry drew his arm still more confidingly around the blender waist of the amazed Indian girl. Starting from her blank unconsciousness, Namaocre looed  wildly from side to side with fear and wonder, and then raised her shy, surprised eyes wonderingly to the face of her lover. ' Her hair, dark and glossy, hung loose over her shoulders, and '. with each motion of her graceful head, it quivered in the sun- -.

There was a bold, - wild beauty in her features, precisely Indian in its tendency, and even the heart of Nelly warmed to the stranger, who clung with such protecting fondness to her brother's arm. Na- maocre, essentially a child of the forest, suffered the caresses of Nelly'with a half-pleased, half-frightened look; and in Per turn, began to play with the golden ringlets, and examine, with cuMrous minuteness, every portion of the dress, so new to her uncivilized imagination. Satisfied with her examination in that quarter, her shy eyes roved curiously around the cabin, and rested at length on a small mirror, which was one of the few relics of civilization Mrs. Huse had preserved in her forest home. With a low, sweet murmur, and an exclama- tion of-"Water! Water!" she flew to -the glass, and touched feature after feature in it, wondering the while that it did not dimple up beneath her pattering hand, as her little looking glass of a 'lake would have done. She bent her lips to the surface of' the glass, and started back to see her mir- rored face and lips advancing to meet her own. She drew Henry up, and touched, with childish glee, his forehead, his eyes, and lips, as they were mirrored before her. At ,ength she pushed him hastily away, and peered curiously into the glass. Another form was visible--another face peer- ing over,her shoulder. The rough old farmer had advanced so softly that even her quick ear had not detected his footfall. With a muttered exclamation of terror, given in her own lan- guage, she shrank wildly from the rough form in" the glass, and in so doing tumbled into the outstretched arms whose clasp she was trying to avoid. This was too much for the risible faculties of farmer Huse, and a loud, free laugh - such as in happier days hMe startled up the forest echoes - broke from 6  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7934-00000032"/> 62     HOME SCENES AND HOMNIE SOUNDS, his distended mouth.. SNamaocre struggled for a monlent, as if life and death depended upon her extri atilon; and when his arms were unclisped, she few trom their embrlace like a frightened bird, and sped down the valley and into'the forest witha step which scarcely touched the earth. At the en- trance -of the wood, where the little path wound around a grove of maple, she paused, and looked shyly back at the cottage she had left in 'the distance. Henry was n her track, and motioned her to return; but with a terrifid look, she again started rapidly, off ulp the -utting rocks, and tisap- peared among their broken peaks. Henry followed in the -distance, and taking a shorter path, which led round the foot of the hill, he was at the wigwam of the Mohawk almost as soon as herself. He explained, as well as he was able, from his imperfect knowledge of the. Indian tongue, the cause of Namaocre's fright. He pleaded with her to return; but she. evaded him, and crept close to the form of her father, peeping cautiously out from the folds of his robe; but no inducement, no pleading could urge her to lease the wigwam again. She suffered Henry to caress her, but still clung to her father's robe with terrified eagerness. Finding all effort useless, and not being very desperately in love with his wild Indian bride, he bowed to the chief, who had remained perfectly passive the while, and left the forest home with a greater feeling of relief than one would have im- agined, under the circumstances, he would have been likely to experience. He had lost his bride, to be sure, and it was rather mortifying to return without her; but then, if the qld farmer indulged in a laugh at his expense, he was sure of SNel- ly's sympathy.               i       ; While Herry was trudging leisurely home over the rocks, ] J   OR THE WORLD FROMW MY WINDOW.       63 Namaocre kept her post am6ng the furs of her father's robe - he never deigning to notice or encourage her. There was a shade of perplexed thought upon the hunter's face, and not a little mirthfulness, as lie paused upon the hill, and looked back at the Alohawk's wigwam.         . "I'll try once more," he muttered, between a laugh and a frown, and again retraced his steps over the rocks. The smol e was curling up through the trees, making ffan- ' tastic figured in the air above them, and the stillness around the dwelling was almost painful. He gained the door, and stood for a moment in its frame of leaves. A smile lith up his face, and with a low whistle he'burned upon his heel, and was off like an arrow from a bow. His lost bride and her father were both asleep. CHAPTER    VI. "Miserere mei!"  "Alone in utter woe!" THS burden of the poet's heart might have been written as an illustration of the utter hopelessness, the utter dejection of Nelly Huse. "My eyes are full of tears, ' My heart is full of pain, To wake, as now, again, And walk as in my youth the wilderness of years."' So exclaimed our own  sweet singer, Stoddad, for singing's sake, and so felt poor Nelly Huse, as, with head leaning on the low window sill, she awoke from a pleasant dream to the con- . sciousness of her position. A month had passed since her word had been plighted to Oneacta - a month, with its misery to her, and its happiness to her future husband. The Valley  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7934-00000033"/> OME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, Farm, too, in that month had shaken off its scent of blood, and bloomed again with all its original freshness. The old farmer in that month had regained his cheerfulness and composure; and Henry, too, had quite forgotten his Indian bride, or re- membered her only to smile at his folly. To all but Nelly the month had been one of pleasantness and peace. Away up among the rocks, the perpetual sound of toil and labor was rife; and oftentimes when the winds drifted down to the valley freighted with echoes, Nelly' would close her eyes with a shud- de ant grow very pale and sad. It was her home, in prep- aration fr her presence. There was one relief connected with its/advancement- it kept Oneacta from her side. He must superintend its progress, and see that nothing was left undone, which could advance the comfort of his forest flower, when she should have been transplanted to' its walls. When she should have been transplanted! Would she ever live to be removed from the soil where she had grown from child- hood? Or, so living, would she not wither day by day, and droop at last upon the fresh sod? The month had pysed, and the last night-the last-she would ever pass under the roof of the valley home, had come, with its shadows and its gloom. In the morning she would be the bride of Oneacta - his wife. In the morning she would look her last upon the valley, swelling awa' and away, with its wealth of green, into the very arms of the forest. She would go up to her home among the rocks, and leave the cottage, so full of memories, so full of home treasures. How dear and more dear these treasures grew to her) heart, as one by,one she rdcounted them over, and bade them farewell! The old arm chair, wherein her father had sat for years, when the evening came, to read the chapter from the well-worn Bible; the 4   little glass wherein her mother had arranged, with quiet pre- cision, the pale auburn tresses around her gentle head; the hunting gear of her brother; - no! she would shut her eyes and her heart, she would not see or think of him, or aught be- longing to him. He might have saved her. He might have forbidden the marriage with Oneacta. Was he not her broth- er-fearless in every other purpose, yet bending his stubborn will'to the requirements of Oneacta? Had he not told her the union was proper-was best for them all? To be sur6, he had strained her passionately to his heart, even while he coun- selled her to the course she was pursuing; but it was his sis- ter, and he was to lose her companionship. The more she dwelt upon his strange manner, the more hopeless and sorrow- ful she beohme. It was the last night at home. Twilight lay like a dream upon the valley. She arose from her revery, and stood for a moment in the open door. i"Ilow beautiful - how beautiful!" she murmured; "and to-morrow I must look my last upon it." She parted the wet vines, and stepped, out upon the door- step. Every spot around the valley had some sweet memory associated with it, and seemed beckoning her out to bid fare- well. She passed quietly down the little worn path, and paused at the little brookside where she had so often filled he pail, when her heart was as light and free as were its dancing waters. The ripples were quiet now, and only the voice of the running stream answered to her pleading farewell.  1 homesick sob agitated the leaves above her head, and they in their turn seemed to murmur to her stricken spirit, Farewell -farewell.

"For the last time" she repeated, and tears started in her eyes; and the next moment she was in its charmed circle. The walls of the chapel were still there, but the roof had long ago tumbled iln, and over the aperture a mass of clinging vines had twined themselves. The old gray rock, which had been its foundation, was covered with rich green moss, and the little rosary and cross, which her brother had strung for her from the scarlet plums of the checkerberry, lay like a band of coral upon the tiny altar. It was a trifling 'circumstance in itself, and had been almost for- gotten for years; but the sight of it now - now that she was leaving its locality, dissipated the firmness she had been trying / to assume. She caught the rosary to her lips, and kissed it passionately. She bent her head down upon the soft moss and wept bitterly.' Her sobs were echoed from  another) portion of the grove, and rising to her feet, she detected the form of her brother; - the brother she was leaving forever, - and threw herself wildly and hopelessly upon his bosom. "O, do save- ime! -do " she exclaimed passionately. "Is there nothing I can do to appease him-nothing but this?" Henry shook his head mournfully. "If I could die now, with your arms about me!       j She paused in her frenzied speech, for Henry wag unwind- ing her clasped hands, with an assumption of firmness which he could scarcely command. "It is best for us both," he repeated, as he had often done before. It was his only argument --"It is best for ies both!" Why it should be so, he never saw fit to explain. But he kissed her again and again, even while repulsing her, until' another voice was mingled with theirs, and the wild woman stood before them. The blood flushed to Henry's face, and   OR THE WORLD FROM MY---WINDOW.       67 he turned fiercely towards her, with an exclamation of anler. "Why do you keep perpetually upon my path? Go where I will-- do what I will--yozt are sure to make your appear- ance. I shall hate you soon if you haunt me so much." "SNo!" she replied, fixing lpr eyes fondly upon his irritat- ed countenance. "Not hate me, Henry - that would/5e un- natural. I come for Nelly. It is late, and to-morrow - come, Nelly, come." Passively Nelly gave her hand to her strange conductor, and left the spot endeared to her by reminiscences of child- hood, and doubly endeared by this last interview with her brotlher. CHAPTER VII. "Bring flowers, fresh flowers, for the-bride to wear; They were born to blush in her shining hair! She is leaving the home of her childish mirth - She has bid farewell to her father's hearth!" THE fresh flowers were braided in the shining hair of Nelly Huse - the flowers her own hands had planted. The burst- ing buds were gleaming out through tangled curls and laying their bright lips lovingly upon her pale cheek. They were wreathed around her brow, and dotted all over her delicate muslin dress, which had been the present of the wild woman --where obtained it was impossible to guess - certainly not in that wilderness. The birds never sang so joyfully in the sunlight,-the brook never flaihed so merrily, or the forest leaves whispered so lovingly, as on this morning-- the morning of the marriage of Nelly Huse. It was the hands of the wild woman who arranged the long, shining curls, and wreathed  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7934-00000035"/> 68     HOSIE SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, them with flowers; and it was the lips of the wild woman which rested- O, so fondly, when all was completed for the sacrifice - upon the brow of the passive victim. ' As for farmer Huse, he seemed mad with joy. He capered from room to room like a pleased child; he sang bits of old time melodies, and whistled merrily as he was wont to do when engaged with his axe in the forest. In the nighlttime he had been tramping the woods with the wild woman. Such an in- discretion for a man of his years, one would be inclined to doubt. It was true, nevertheless; and as he returned with the Mohawk chief, and a large portion of his tribe, it is to be sup- posed that he had other incentives for such an act besides the pleasure of her companionship. Even Henry seemed to have caught the fever of joy; and, like the farmer, vented his gladness in occasional bursts of melody. He caught Nelly in his arms, dressed as she was for the altar, and crushed a dozen buds out of the long curls, for which the wild woman nearly scolded him; but changed her intention, and kissed him instead. He did not repulse her this time -not he ; but kissed her back again with a hearty good will. It was time to restrain his mirth; for Oneacta was seen dressed in the habiliments of civilization, coming up the path in company with the old white-headed missionary, whose home had been for years among tents and watchfires. Nelly shud- dered and clung despairingly to her brother; but he 'only murmured, "Couraye, Velly- courage," and led her to a seat by the open window. He turned to call the wild woman, but she had left the room; so he remained standing by her side while the party entered. One by ohe the party entered the cabin, and nothing now! remained but the simple service which should link for-    OR THE 'WORLD  FROM MY WINDOW"      69 ever two hearts so unlike in their propensities. At the re- quest of the missionary, Nelly arose with desperate firmness, and took her station by the side of Oneacta. Her mournful glance rested for a moment upon Henry, but it only met a frank, joyous smile in return. "He will not regret me," she thought; " why should he?" and her eyes filled with tears, which she forced back again upon her swollen heart. All eyes were now turned upon the bride and bridegroom, for the deep, full tones of the missionary were heard demanding if any there were present who knew sufficient reason Why the parties before them should not be united.- "I do!" shouted the wild woman from an opening door. "L do! I forbid the banns - I claim that man as my lawful hus- band - I forbid the banns - I accuse him of the betrayal of innocence, and curse him now, as I did then, when the shadow of a ruined home -a broken heart -and a crazed brain was falling upon me."  "' Oneacta!" exclaimed Nelly in surprise and alarm. "Jeain Lemure," shouted the accuser, and her eyes flashed defiance to the fierce scowl which distorted the features of the betrayed man -"Jean Lemure, do you know me now? For years I have waited for this hour of revenge -for years - years! Now I can crush your heart as you did mine; for you love this girl - love her! you, the demon of the valley, love its sweetest flower, and that flower I gather from your reach, before your presence blights it and scatters it to the earth." Nelly had sprung to her embrace, and lay in the circle of her arlms, palpitating - dying. "A doom has been upon -Your pathway, and I told you so then," she hastily continued.

"Your husband," sneered Oneacta, or rather Jean Lemure, for it was he, who, under the disguise of a Mohawk, had so strenuously sought the hand of Nelly Huse. "My husband! Is there any thing strange in that? Is it so singular that one bent upon deception should be himself deceived? The man you thought to bribe was lawfully em-  powered to marry. But what of that? You cast me off to the scorn of the world, as your mistress, and broke my moth- er's heart. Your word was given, and what had I, a poor helplessgirl, to urge against your power and wealth? Nothing -nothing; so I sought to hide my unmerited disgrace in a for- eign land; but I left my curse with you. The news came to me, even here, that another trusting girl was to be your dupe, I returned home in time to see her dressing for the altar. I told her of your treachery, and left the shadow of my inher- itance falling upon her - a ruined home - a broken heart -a crazed brain; and it was meeted out to her! Her grave is where the ripples of the Thames float away to the sea, to be, like her, forgotten. Again the news of another purposed mar- riage reached me. Again I sought the bride, and breathed my doom into her ear - a ruined home - a broken heart-a -a crazed brain; but she heeded it not, and there is its fulfil- ment."  The wild woman softly as was in her nature opened the door to an adjacent room, and started back in dismay. Upon ; a bed of coarse, though scrupulously neat material, lay all  that remained of Leoline Lemure. Her home was ruined, her  j brain crazed, and her heart had broken.

For a moment the missionary raised his pleading eyes to heaven in the utterance of a half-breathed prayer. For the four weeks she had been lying ill in the cabin of farmer Huse, he had been almost incessantly by her side. He had prayed with and for her, and he could but hope that his plead- ings had been effectual. The sight of his wife, pale and cold before him, revived a portion of the affection Lemure had once felt for her; but there were eyes upon him; so he mastered all emotion, and turned again, with an air of defiance, to the wild woman. "Now," she said, " as the missionary is here, he may as well complete the work he has begun.!' Nelly turned an imploring glance upon the speaker; but she only smoothed over the dark curls with her- large hand, and drew her still more fondly to her bosom. Jean Lemure ad- vanced to the side pf his bride. "Well," she muttered, " what do you want?" "My bride," he answered; " my wife." -: "Shut up and clear out, you -you laughing hyena--you devil in human form. I would sooner cast the poor girl into flood or flame than trust her to your mercy -you, whose great- est weakness has ever been to think every heart priceless but the one you have won. No! Nelly is destined to be the wife of Henry Huse. "My brother!/" murmured Nelly, in bewildered tones. It was no time for words, for his arms were clasping her - his small white hand was laidl lovingly on her head, as in olden times, and his kisses were on her face, and neck, and brow. &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7934-00000037"/> '; This is fearful--this is horrible!" exclaimed Jean Le- nure.   - "My boy- mine I " continued the wild woman, heedless of he wondering crowd. " Tell me, Henry, do you remember aught beyond your forest life?"           ' "There have always been detaflched memories floating through my mind," he replied, "more like half-forgotten dreams than palpable forms. I have felt their presence most in storm and darkness--wild, vague enthusiasm, which I could scarcely comprehend; yet there has ever been to me a harmony in the grand and sublime." "You could not have remembered it, boy - you could not,' she murmured. "That night of terror and desolation. It is the only inheritance your mother bequeathed to you. You were born on the ocean; amid the tempest and the whirlwind, . the crashing of masts and spars, and the shrieks of help- ; less, hopeless wretches.

She shall be mine in I spite of you or the devil!" and advancing a step, he whis- pered in the ear of the Mohawk chief; but to his surprise, he  , .'   received no reply, while the Indian continued with his eyes moodily fixed upon the ground. A laugh of scornful meaning sounded harshy through the cabin, and the wild woman hissed in the ear of her betrayer, "Your power is ended--it is my victory now.   Leave the valley and the adjacent hills, and you are safe from moles- tation.  Remain another day within the circle of the Mohawk encampment, andj will not answer for your life-certainly not for your liberty." "And Henry?" he questioned, willing to gain time for thought. "Is my boy. , The old farmer who protected him when his mother had no home to give him, -must in his turn be pro- tector." Lemlure left the cabin without another word, and from that hour was never heard of in the vicinity of the Wyoming valley,. There is a legend still extant upon the shores of the Iud- son, of a strangely powerful man, who came and dwelt among the early settlers. All known of him was, that he had been a resident of Wyoming valley; but the influence hp gained, and the arts he used to fascinate and destroy, marked the life-track of Jean Lemure.  1y tale is told. Why shou  I write moe? A pleasant grave, among the blossoms, was dug for Le line, and its sod watered by the gentle tears of Nelly Huse; and in a few weeks after, the pious missionary was again called to the farm- er's cabin, while she with the sanction of her father, and Hen- ry's mother, gave her hand where she had struggled so long and unsuccessfully to restrain her heart. A happy home was the cabin on the Valley Farm!

The old farmer could never be any thing but happy. There was a melody in the ringing of the axe; and while his strength lasted, he was incessantly employed in clearing and improv- ing the homestead; for, as he very wisely remarked, Henry -knew as much of agriculture as an elephant did of hatching chickens. l  .amaocre became the wife of a chief of a neighboring tribe, and in due time learned to love Nelly, and even permit the old farmer to pat her cheeks. Years and years have come and gone since theincidents of the above story transpired. 'he valley has been the scene of massacre and blood. Old houses have been torn down; yet here and there, dotted like landmarks upon its bosom, are thatched cabins, time-worn and decayed, whose inmates tell the story of Nelly Huse and Henry Lemure, and boast of their own descent from the wild and hardy settlers who were once, a long while agone, sole owners of the beautiful VALLEY FARM.

WHAT KATY DID, OR  MR WATKINS'S WIFE. KIATY  certainly did-there's no mistake about it; and if all the tribe of winged creatures-who glory in contradiction should take up the tone, and scream in shrill chorus, "Katy didn't," still would I  m6st emphatically assert that Katy " did."  Now I've  known Katy ever since she was worth knowing; more- over, I'm going to tell what she did, and it would puzzle my antagonists to say what she   Ididn't do!

Well, as I said before,  Katy certainly did. Wild, dark, shy, passionate Katy! Nobody ever thought it of her, she was so reserved, so sensitive, and shrinking; so con- scious of her own outward deficiency, and so fearful for its in- fluence. When she was quite a child, before they were sensi- ble of the dangerous seed they were sowing, she remembered to have heard her parents say," How very plain!" and now that she had grown to be a woman, with' all a woman's pride, knowl- edge, and love of admiration strong within her, she could not resist the desire to scan her face, feature by feature; and, of- ten as she would thus indulge her morbid pride, would come up to her own lips the old repulsive words, "How very plain!"  Once, when, with a particularly bitter tone, she had given ut- terance to the accustomed plaint, a bright, handsome face glit- A tered by her own in the mirror, and a saucy, musical voice [ whispered in her ear, "Not so very plain, Katy, not with that pair of eyes." En passant, if there is one thing more than another  ! which a lady has a particular dislike to be caught at by a lov- er, it is the bewailing of any physical unattractiveness. The chances are ten to one that he gets a " walking ticket" in consequence. As the above remark is not copyrighted, lovers have my permission- to pin it in their hats.     i  i Any other lover but Willie Watkins would have melted down like a tallow candle beneath the indignant blaze flashed upon him from "that pair of eyes." Not he. There he stood tapping his boot with a little cane L no bigger than a feather, and looking so comical and so saucy, that if he had had me to'deal with instead of Katy, he would i have got a good boxed ear one minute and a kiss the next, to ! show him I was in earnest.  ,e    S -.   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.      885 "Are you aware, sir, that this is my private room?" ex- claimed Katy, as soon as she could bring that provokingly plain face of hers into any thing like composure. Mr. Wat- kins was evidently quite aware of the fact, but he made no move to vacate it for all that. "( Katy, you are handsome--to me." There it was again. She was handsome to him, and he knew well enough she was homely to every one else. "I love you, Katy; nobody else will ever love you so well."  An impatient gesture of the hand was her only answer. "There is not a being in the wide world I love but you-    not a thought of happiness but is of and for you ; not a pleas- ! ure or association I would not sacrifice for your dear sake." The saucy, comical look was all gone now, and he continued: "For two years, I have pleaded with you for a word of hope, as a felon would plead for his forfeited life; I have borne with your petulant exactions, because I thought in time to tame the self-deceived girl into a trusting woman." "Did you?" was Katy's sarcastic reply. "And now   "No wonder the drooping lids suddenly lifted themselves from above those great flashing eyes. Katy i certainly had glorious eyes; bad luck to the man or woman they pounced upon in anger. "Well, sir, and what now?" "I'm going to be married!" " The blood danced a hornpipe from   Katy's face to her heart, and from her heart back again, before she ventured to  speak.     - "That is no affair of mine, I take it, Mr. Watkins," she final- - ly found words to say; and wishing him a very good morning, 8                          &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7934-00000044"/> 86     HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, she sauntered leisurely from the house, and was soon seen entering the summer house at the foot of the garden.

"A hundred girls that I could marry if I liked, and yet I mnust break my heart-for I amdoing that same --because one -the one--will not or cannot give me back the love I waste upon her!" Suddenly the old saucy smile lit up his handsome face, and pulling a letter from his pocket, he interlarded its reading with  such exclamations as "Capital," "Just the thing," "I'll do it; "  and replacing it, he left the qottage of Katy King without so much as once glancing at the summer house.

Gentlemen readers will please skip over the next dozen lines or so, as I have a word or two to say in private to the ladies. Don't you believe the half Willie Watkins said about love and devotion, and all that. A likely story that he could have left her there in the summer house expecting every moment i i to have him on his knees to her if he had. The fact is, ladies, men think they must say all sorts of extravagant things in courting time -all very well for the gingerbread work; but you just try them a bit, like Katy did, and see how soon they will aspire to the whip hand, or bolt the match. Katy did i, #   Hi".   OR THE WORLD PROI MY WINDOW.       87 expect him; you or I would have done the same thing, and have done it, many a time and oft-at least you have; my expe-  rience is somewhat limited i? that regard; but I am ready to believe any thing that's reasonable where the heart is con- cerned. Katy did expect him, and sat bolt upright, with her lips primly closed together, and her arms folded over each other, after the most approved style of indignation patrons. With what severity she would receive him! with what haughtiness she would refuse him! and then--why - a-- if he was quite humble and penitent for being abused, he might kiss her hand. Ah, Katy knew when hearts were trumps, if she was homely; mind that. After so much preparation, and a speech prepared for the occasion, for all I know, it is to be expected that the neat little figure of Willie Watkins, tripping down the street, instead of to the summer house, as in duty bound, had a tendency to sweeten the temper of the watcher. I wouldn't say it, only that I am writing a true story; but Katy, more than any one I know of, could get up the largest quantity of discomfort at the shortest possible notice; and with all her inconsistencies, she loved Willie - nay, more, she worshipped any object his hand had touched more than ever she could love any body or any thing else in all the world; but that horrible bughear of homeliness was destroying her confidence in herself to win, and in him to be won.  He was her life, soul, religion - her only conception of paradise. Had the whole world censured, reviled, or mocked at her, she would have laughed at their insolence; but should those earnest blue eyes rest upon her re- provingly, her proud, high heart would have cowered at his feet, so he knew it not, and silently wept for the pain he  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7934-00000045"/> 88    1sOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS,  suffered. The village might have been exterminated, her as- sociates might have been dying or dead around her, and she would have judged it a natural consequence; but should one pang, mental or physical, disturb the calmness of that dear [ white brow, her very spirit would have been wrung, until it  would have forced up blood for tears. Silent and unrecognized by him, this intense -love had grown, until, even while her whole life was made up of petty annoyances, she would have gone through flood and flame to save him from what she was incessantly bearing .- unhappi- ness. Her spirit revelled in all the worship and idolatry of a pagan,-while her outer self was a mass of pride and cold ex- action. You may not understand this double phase of char-  acter, but I do, for I have recognized it in more than Katy's case.          /              o I do not quite know the nature of her feelings, after the last shadow of Willie Watkins had passed from her sight. Possibly, at first, it was fierce anger, then wounded pride, e and, lastly, hearthroken love; not that she believed the words, s so lightly spoken, of his intended marriage, but that she could not beat down that tyrant, distrust, which frightened the words of affection from her lips. The dew had already begun to fall, and was glistening in the grape vines, when Katy returned to the house. She had lived a little lifetime in those few hours, and the result had been to make her, if not a more hopeful, at least a better woman. It was nearly his hour to visit her. With what deep and cherishing tenderness she thought of his words, now grown doubly dear-- Nobody will ever love you sol as Ido!" She felt a certain shame for her own false pride- a certain !   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.       89 sorrow for the unkind part she had played towards him. She would tell him she loved him, &amp;,en if he thought it unwoman- ly - even if she repented it, in bitterness and tears, the next moment. She would break down that barrier of reserve, and trample it in the dust at his feet. She would tell him, from her full heart, if it would give him  one moment's joy to hold her to his bosom, --that dear haven she had so longed for but never reached, - to take her there, crush her, and let her die, with his fond arms about her. Ah, Katy was handsome enough now! The light of love illumined her face, and sent a wilde' fire to her glorious eyes! Her heart palpitated with a delicious sense of joy! Coldness, harshness, and distrust were all lost - all gone, and, for the first hours in her life, she was a true woman! Poor, deceived Katy! the simple possibility of his loving  any one but her never for a moment crossed her mind; the possibility that he might weary of her constant coldness never entered her heart; and when the night passed, and the cold - gray dawn came streaming in at her chamber window, it fell upon the calm, pale brow of an earnest, hopeful, loving wo-   4 man. Poor Katy! she "' had sown the wind, and was reaping    1 the whirlwind.'  And the weelks passed as that night had done, only with this difference-hope had turned to despair; until one morning there came a letter, containing a few simple words, stating that as she had decliled the honor of an alliance Xwith himl, he should have the pleasure, that evening, of intro- ducing her to Jir'. 1at kins's wie!

But the past -that, at least, had been hers; they could not rob her of the little life of love she had hedged round by seeming indiffer- ence; they could not take from her the consciousness that he had loved her more than any one else ever would. Like one in a dream, Katy moved around her home dur- ing the fatal day that had wrecked her bark of happiness. "If I suffer he shall not see if," she murmured; and flinging herself upon the lounge, overcome by the exhaustion which follows great sorrow, she soon lay in a deep and heavy sleep. The sun was just setting when she awoke, and, with an in. distinct sense of something sorrowful, she arose, and gliding to the window, threw it open, and stepped out upon the bal- cony, to which it led. Her mother was already there, in ani. mated conversation with some person in the garden beneath them, whom she could not see. "Who is it, mother?" she whispered, turning pale as death. "Only Mr. Watkins's wife," was the gentle reply, accom- panied by a curious expression, which for a moment startled Katy. Only Mr. Watkins's wife! That glad,"gay, beautiful girl only Mr. Watkins's wife! She had come out now from the shadow of the balcony, and stood like a radiant vision between Katy and the light! A slight toss of the saucy little head sent a shower of golden curls'quivering around her neck like so many runaway sunbeams, and a merry, girlish laugh broke up the silence, and drifted awty in detached echoes. "O, you are Katy, I suppose," she exclaimed, upturning her sweet, happy face to where our heroine stood in utter amaze- ment. "Willie says I must love you very much, for he does;" . and again' that singular expression overspread her mother's face.  ir'   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.       91 "Mr. Watkins is very kind," replied Katy, so haughtily that you could have sworn her capable of doing the freezing for the whole village. "Wait a bit till I gather a bouquet for Willie, and I'll join you ;" and off the little fairy flew, as if her feet were as light as her heart.  I cannot bear it - I cannot - mother, send her - them -away -do you hear - at once!" exclaimed Katy; and in another moment, she had gained her library, and flinging her- self upon the floor, had given vent to a passionate burst of weeping. "0, God help me - God pity me! " she exclaimed, in a tone of  ild entreaty. "Now I know what it is that opens walls for maniacs, and graves for suicides!" Katy   " that voice! she would have known it out of all the world, for its rich, musical tone. That hand which rested on her firehead! that fair, soft, woman's hand -it could be- long to no one but Willie Watkins --the married man !  At another time, she would have flung it from her, with just con- tempt and scorn; but now - it was so sudden  so unexpect- ed -and she was so reckless, desperate, and heartbroken, that, knowing its sinfulness, she caught it to her lips and heart, and sobbed over it like a grieved child. "0 Willie - my Willie still! If you had only been pa- tient with me a little while longer --if you had only made allowance for my pride - this sorrow never could have come upon me! Willie - my Willie! thughallthe world should come between us - mine now - mine forever ! " With almost a woman's tenderness he gathered her to his bosom, and for the first time their lips met in an earnest, pas- sionate kiss. What was it to her that the rashly-taken oath  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7934-00000047"/> 92     HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, gleamed up'like a watchfire in the desert of, her despair! What to her were honor, peace, happiness, or reputation? He  loved her - she was sure of that; and his arms were clasp. ing her around, as if they would imprison her forever! With im'n! she cared not where, or when, or what lay in the fu. tureT She was wild - mad - with but one thought, one    hope, one name in her heart - Willie. "I need not tell you, Katy, how I have loved you," Willie began, when her grief had somewhat subsided. "Night and day, at home or abroad, sleeping or waking, you were the star of my life. Others might have thought you plain, cold, un- lovable; but to me, in spite of your haughtiness, you were every thing holy and desirable; and until hope deserted me, II never dreamed of the possibility of loving another." Katy clung closer to his bosom, as if striving still to shut out that horrible possibility..  "And now, when it is too late, you would sacrifice home; friends, reputation, for the man that, scarcely a month ago, you tried to chill to death with your assumed coldness. Was it well?" "But I loved you through it all--all! You were my dream, as I was yours; my idol, as I was yours; my destiny, as you shall be now." And again her arms wound around his neck with passionate rehemence, and her head nestled more closely within its sinful shelter! Katy was delirious : how could she resist the only joy she could ever know again? "O, dear, bless me-don't mind me in the least," ex- claimed the merry voice of Mr. Watkins's wife, who had en- tered the room unseen. "I really beg pardon ; and as three are bad company, particularly when one of the three happens to be one's wife, I'll be off."            !   OR THE WORLP FROM MY WINDOW.     .93  "Stay!" said Katy, flashing upon the bright girl a reck-    less and audacious glance. "This may seem strange to you  "  " O, dear, no - not in the least. Willie told me how it   i would be!" interrupted the unconcerned wife. "And you to love him! an  you to marry him, when you knew his heart was another's "  "Well  but he promised  " "Now hear me!" and with a defiant, voluptuous smile, Katy clasped the hand of her acknowledged  lover, and pressed it to her lips. "Where he goes, I go! where he lives, I live! when he dies, I shall die!" "Well, who the mischief cares? The sooner the better, if I'm to be teased in this way, just in the honeymoon, too." No wonder Katy's eyes grew prominent, for there, side by side with the injured wife, stood her mother, looking very grave, but still wearing that odd expression of countenance. "The fact is, Katy," said the little one, "I'm tired of act- ing. I ant Mr. Watkins's wife, but with all due respect to your opinion, your Willie there can't hold a candle to mine.  There, the murder's out; you can commence killing me just     as soon as you please." This last remark was addressed to Mr. Watkins, the origi-     nal, who, from all appearances, one would judge, was any thing but in a killing humor! Katy, cold, passionless Katy, gazed for a moment from one to the other; as if doubtful if all was not a dream, and then, horror-stricken at what might have been a terrible crime, fainted in the arms of her lover! It was a cruel lesson, but the only one which could have truly taught her the secret of  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7934-00000048"/> "     HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, her own happiness.

The color faded out of the cheek of Alice, and she leaned heavily against the window, and followed with, her eyes the slight, graceful form of her young lover, until the dense trees shut him from her sight. Only a little week before, and sihe would have bartered all her hopes of earthly happiness for one! word of love from the lips of Willie Wilde. That word had been spoken with a wild; passionate vehemence, which could have left no room for a sinole doubt of its sincerity ; and yet she had received it with a startled, terrified glance, and a dep- recating "I'l think of it, Willie," which spoke of surprise, terror, repugnance perhaps - but not of love. True, he had preserved her life at the hazard of his own, and she had clung to him in that hour of gratitude with tears and sobs, and it might have been the glad, passionate joy which beamed from her eyes, as she lay helplessly upon his bosom, which embold- ened him to give utterance to the thoughts that had haunted him like an unattainable dream for years of his young life. There was a long step between their positions in society- the step of poverty. Willie Wilde was active, proud, ambitious, but poor; Alice Dale, gentle, affectionate, loving, but an   , OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.       97    i heiress; and if she ever thought of her inheritance, if she ever prided herself upon her riches and her power, it was, that through ' their possession she might-not win his esteem; she would have scorned that - but that she might in some way, unknown to him, perhaps, soften his dark future, advance his present 1 interests, and make td  to him which seemed so difficult   i[ to attain - the acq'2t  of fame and popularity in the artist life he had chosen. They had been children together- - - always with that long step of poverty and pride between them -and Alice remembered how she had first seen him, a handsome, passionate boy, weeping upon his dead mother's   A bosom, refusing all attempts at consolation, until her hand rest- ed upon his, so momentarily that another might almost have doubted the proximity; but with him it struck a chord which never after ceased to vibrate to her touch; and she rememr-  i bered, too, how pleadingly he had murmured, "Love me, Allie o -I-aT,1 1 -alone now; " and she had loved him with a shy, girl- ish love; which even dark forebodings of his restless, wander- ing impulses could not subdue, which even the tongue of scan- dal, coming barbed with rumors of dissolute hours and vicious companions, could not shake. She would not judge him as    L the world judged him. Why should she? They could only take a pitiless, scornful view of his faults. She only saw the sweet gentleness which should be extended to them. They could shut their eyes to a knowledge of-his human virtues, and see only his humanftrailties.' She could only comprehend his  virtues, without their attendant frailties; and so in time, the love of her heart grew into blind, unconscious idolatry. The less he was to others, the more he became-to her. ,The less the kindness and consideration extended him from those about them, the more assiduous were her attentions and courtesies;  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7934-00000050"/> HOME SCENES AND IIOM SNDS,  yet always stopping within the bounds of friendship- always loving, yet never seeming to love, until, between hope and fear, the heart of the young enthusiast grew  eary;; and to silence its murmurings, he proposed a long absence from the village, to aid him, it was said, in his studies. -And the night had come - the last night of their pleasant companionship; and he had asked for hope in the future-- that future so dark and trackless; he had pleaded for one word of love to carry witl him into his voluntary exile, and she had answered him carelessly, coldly, "I'1l think of it, Willie". If she could have found words for the deep thoughts within her heart, if she could have given vent to the smoth- ered wildness upon her lips, the spirit of Willie Wilde would not have turned away so bruised and chilled, but would have sprung into hope and joy, like a bird to its wildwood nest. If she could have recalled him, even, when he had turned so sor- rowfully away, there might have been something of hopefulness in that slight act; but her coward heart refused even that small crumb of comfort-to one for whom she would have died. '"It is because I .love, him," she murmured, and the wild, passionate thought sank down into her heart again, likea pebble flung into a quiet stream. Loved him! he might have seen it in :the strange earnestness of her anxious eyes, in the violent throbbings of her troubled heart, and more than all in the marble paleness which superseded the old, sudden blush, when he spoke of his departure. For hours and hours, Alice Dale sat by the open window, under the shadow of the honey- suckle, and the night came, and the moonlight lay in an un- broken sheet-over the meadow, down to the very brink of the river, where its brilliancy was lost in a fringe of shadows. She leaned from the window, and looked out upon the earth    OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW   .    I     a  and over the waters. The clear stars shone down upon her, and the flowers sent up their fragrance on the passing breeze, and the waves glittered in the warm light; but between her and the stars, between her and the river, between her and every object in heaven or on the earth, she saw nothing but the dear form of him who had loved her from-infancy, .whom she had loved from infancy; yet whom, so loving and so cher- ishing, she had suffered to leave her, perhaps forever, with- out one word of the kindness -of the affection thus strug- gling for utterance. All at ofce there rushed over her spirit a violent flood of regretful feeling. What would life be to her, and Willie Wilde away? How would she bear the lonely, weary years which must intervene before they could meet again? What if he should love another- not as he had loved her, but in his yearning for companionship, some one else should usurp her dominion - should become his wife? She started impetuously from her revery, with an echo of his own passionate vehemence, and passed out upon the same path that he had trodden but a moment before. Her woman's na- ture was gaining its strength; she would see him once more, whatever the result might be. She felt a certain shame in the acknowledgment she was about to make; but she could not part with him; only let her see him once more; only let her tell him how grateful she had been; how she had loved him from the-day she lay in his arms when he had saved her from the falling tree; and the future was in his hands - to do as it pleased him, the best for them both. She passed rapidly over the rough, broken ground--over the flowers gleaming in their freshened beauty-- over the clinging bush- es which lay between her home and the humble dwelling of Willie Wilde; for she was on a mission of tenderness, and    &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7934-00000051"/> 100    HOAIE SCENES AND HOHE SOUNDS,  tenderness gleamed from every object about her. A sound of voices startled her from her imaginings. She" paused, spell- bound by the sight which met her earnest glance. Willie Wilde stood leaning against a tall tree, with his hands clasped in those of a young girl whom she had never met before -a girl so strangely beautiful, that she almost expected to see her vanish like a dream. The murmur of their words, but not their import, reached her listening ears. They must have been of pleasantness, for a bright smile flashed over the face of the animated girl. She turned to retrace her steps, but her  limbs refused their office. She saw him gather her more close- ly in his arms, as the incarnation of the old idal loveliness ? which he worshipped in any form - she saw him press his lips upon her cheeks, and lips, and brow, and her own eyes closed away from the sight; but she knew that they had parted, for she heard the crackling of branches as he passed near her side; and when she again opened her eyes, she saw only the river, and the sky, and the wood, as she had seen them on that long agone day when Willie Wilde had caught her from un- der the branches of the falling tree.        i  And he came again the next morning, with the shadow 'f that lovely girl's kiss fresh upon his lips, and renewed his sui i to Alice Dale; and she received him calmly, coldly, without the accustomed blush which had always heralded his coming. She told him she had thought of it--that her affections were not concentrative enough to fix themselves upon one person with any degree of safety--that she could not love him (O, mockery of a heart that could so belie its nature!) as he ought to be loved- as she should desire -to love the man she mar- ried-that they were better apart- better living free, and in friendliness, than bound together by ties which each might   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW,      101    i /                  ! wish at some future period'were broken. She told him his  { happiness would ever be dear to her- that whatever lay in her power to aid him he might at all times command; but not one word of reproach escaped her lips -not one intimation of the i scene she had witnessed the night previous; and he turned away with a bitter smil1, refusing even the small white hand extended to bid him God speed. She watched him from the   I window, as he passed down the river path, until her head grew j dizzy and her eyes blinded; and then she saw no more but a jumble of trees, hills, and rocks, rolling together in a confused mass. And for weeks and weeks after, she lived in a bewil- dered dream, conscious that loving, pitying friends were around her - conscious that kind voices were murmuring to her--but always knowing that the voice and the face of Willie Wilde were not of their number - always feeling that the one presence needful was missing - until at last her senses assumed a more tangible form, and she was pronounced out of danger, although held from the grave by the slightest possi- ble tenure. In a few weeks more, she was 'able to walk out to her accustomed haunt bly the banks of the river, and morn- ing after morning found her gazing into the clear depth with eyes which saw not even the pale, sad face mirrored there; and as she watched the ripples dancing first in the light, then in the shadow, she wondered if in all their seeming gladness they were conscious of the change that had come over her since the last time she had paused to gaze upon their brightness.  But a deeper, darker trial yet awaited her. Willie Wilde was to be married to the beautiful girl, whose memory had never left her for a moment. Vague rumors of the approach- j  ing nuptials had reached her, but not until he came himself  and told her of it would she credit the announcement, and then i 9*   &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7934-00000052"/> [02    ROME. SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS. she smiled a glad, pleased smile, and Willie Wilde thought of it, and pondered over it, and at last felt sure that none, of all his friends, felt happier for him than did herself. He did not hear the silent moan, the unheard prayer for strength, the wrestling with the strong spirit for that forced assumption of calmness which- seemed so real; he only saw the outer pla- cidity which had drifted over her heart, like the waves over the shattered wreck, and so seeing, he could not dream of the ruin beneath. And the morning came for the consummation of that union which was to set the seal of despair forever upon the tomb of hope; and her smothered wildness and suffer- ing had caused a slight fever, which would keep her within doors. She sent her congratulations to the happy pair - was too ill, unfortunately, to attend the ceremony-- would pray for their happiness now and forever - but that her strength would not allow her to indulge her wishes. The morning came, and the marriage peal sounded joyfully upon the still air, and over the village, and was echoed-among the faroffhills. With a restless, tottering step she hurried to the window, and gazed anxiously up the path leading to the village-church. Groups of happy faces were peering curiously in at the open door, and beyond them all, she could see the bride and groom, in their triumphant beauty, standing before the sacred altar. The bells had ceased to vibrate--there was a pause of a few moments, and then the glad chant of the organ told too truly that all was over. In another moment, the same smiling faces were hurrying from the church, and taking the different paths to their village homes. The sun which had shone so brilliantly all the morning became ob- scured; the shadows of the trees fell gloomily across the meadow, and when the carriage which contained the wedded    OR' TIE WORLD FROM ,MY WINDOW,      103 pair flashed rapidly past, she crept from her concealment, and wept, and prayed, as those weep and pray who have seen the last star fade from their shrouded sky of happiness. Only He who reads all hearts knew how wildly and bit- terly Alice Dale pleaded with him for death, on that, to her,. fearful morning; and yet she lived through it all! Through the agonizing desire for the companionship lost to her forever - through the knowledge that her still uneonquered love was t i basest crime--through the certainty, that in the cold, dark world she had looked her last upon happiness -and O, more than all, through the trial of meeting him, day by day, the husband of anothAer,-she had lived through it all-and through years of loneliness, uncheered by a single gleam of sunshine. True, every body loved her as something more than mortal, she was so humble, so self-sacrificing. Her home was by the side of the suffering and the sorrowful - her en. ergies were devoted to winning for those about her the bless- ing she never could enjoy herself- happiness. The deserving poor were relieved by her bounty - the sick were nursed by  I her-own hands! Every where that good could be effected    i were the steps of Alice Dale directed, through calm or storm. !j But a change was at hand, which would turn the current of    her feelings into another channel. The -village had been un- usually gay, and the brilliant, petted wife of our artist Wilde ' i had grown more beautiful, more brilliant- but, alas for her  :  husband, vain, frivolous, and unprincipled. Home had no   :  longer any pleasure for her - her husband's love no longer any j attraction. Her nights were passed in frivolous dissipation, j i her days in dreamy inactivity; and Alice saw it all; and if  j the. shadow of grief was ever lifted from her heart, it was  i when his loneliness and his isolation made her forgetful of her i; 'j  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7934-00000053"/> 104    HOME SCENES AND HORME SO UNDS, own sorrow. "If he had been happy!" she would urge, ir extenuation of her own wandering impulses - if he had found peace and comfort, it would have mattered little to her whether she lived or died; but to see him so patient, so un-, complaining, under the-injuries heaped upon him by the one of all others who should. have cherished him, made her regret.. ful for herself- regretful for the false words she had spoken - words which had placed an irrevocable bar between their lives. And so she lived on, day after day, through all her trials and temptations--not daring to trust herself in his presence, lest some unconscious word should escape from his lips, on which she could hang the burden of her own wild impulses -not daring to look him in the face, lest he should read the secret nestling in her heart. And the days were dreamy and monotonous, and the years were like the days, always bringing with them the same sensation of despondency. It was a clear, beautiful morning, with the sun lying in a sheet of gold over the meadow, and the birds singing, as if in the world there could be nothing but the echo of their own joyousness, when a servant entered, and placed a letter in the hand of Alice Dale, bearing the village postmark. All the morning she had sat mournful and vacant, hoping nothing, and fearing nothing; but as she gazed upon the well-known writing of Willie Wilde, over her spirit swept the same wild torrent of grief, which flooded it on the evening she had seen him for the first time with the beautiful girl by the brink of the river. And when that was past, she opened the letter, which had already become saturated and blotted with her tears. There were but few lines, and those few carelessly and hastily written. "Come to me, Alice," it said. "You, who are so kind to   ORn THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.      105 every one else, will not refuse the plea of an old friend. Little Willie is suffering, dying! Of all the miseries that have ever fallen upon my heart, this is the heaviest." She refolded the letter, and sat gazing vacantly upon its direction. "Of all the miseries!" she murinured. He, too, then, had been miserable. He, too, had sufferecd, perhaps with her own intensity of suffering; and she would answer his appeal in person; she would sit by his side, with her wild love, guarded and smothered into seeming death. She would watch with him, and try to soothe the sufferings of the bright, beau- tiful boy, over whom he had watched with such jealous ten- derness. Almost mechanically she arose, and attiring herself for walking, left the house, and was soon at the dwelling of Willie Wilde. She had been expected, and without an an- nouncement she was shown into a room adjoining - the one in which the sick child was placed. The door was partially open, thus enabling her to see what was passing within, her- self unseen. The little face was nestling down among the pil- lows, so pale and white, that but for a perceptible respiration, it might have been mistaken for death itself; and above it bent the slight, graceful form that she remembered gazing upon with such reverence in their days of freedom and happiness. The reckless mother stood carelessly by his side, robed for her morning ride over the hills to the adjacent village. An instinct of jealousy and dislike fell like a bar of iron across the heart of Alice. She felt wronged, oppressed, and grieved, and was glad when the pleading tones of Willie Wilde broke up the bitter train of thought which so pained her. "Don't go out this morning, Emma," were his pleading words; "you see how pale and wan he is." "All fancy," replied the, unfeeling woman, drawing on the  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7934-00000054"/> 106    HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, remaining glove, and turning listlessly to the door. "The doctor says his fever has turned, and he only requires rest to W make him well again. I'll make my ride short, this morning, if you like, though I suppose Mr. Wilson will scarcely con- sent to that;" and with a light laugh she left the room, and was soon seen from the window, galloping over the hills with her handsome escort, much to the scandal of the village. For a moment her husband gazed after her in blank amazement; then an unmitigated contempt shadowed his face, passing slowly away into a feeling of deep sorrow, as his anxious eyes ' turned from the window to rest upon his suffering child. , How still and quiet every thing seemed in that lonely room!  The measured tick, tick,; of the little clock upon the mantel- j piece, seemed more harsh and monotonous than ever to the : stricken man. He bent over the restless boy, who had been i his only companion the three short years of his life. He Ij thought of the first dawn of intellect in that young mind, and i how he had nourished it, and had striven to develop it ju- j diciously, that in after years he might not regret the charge. : Then, by one of those imperceptible changes which we cannot C control, his mind wandered back into the past. lHe thought of Alice, sadly and regretfully, and of the difference there might h;ave been in his lot, had she loved him as he had loved her-then came the sudden revulsion of feel- ing, the, vision of his loneliness and sorrow--the fear that the only link which bound him to earth would be broken / by the death of his beautiful boy. He looked around the room with his anxious, sleepless eyes, and saw nothing written there but the word desolation. He looked upon the features of his child, which had been imperceptibly settling into a rigid calm, and read too plainly that chilling syllable - death; -    OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.      107 and with a bitter moan he clasped his arms around the sense-, less form of his dead idol, and wept as if his heart was broken. And what of Alice? Pale as the lifeless boy upon the bed, she stood looking upon that man and his despair, and in the whole wide world she saw nothing else, comprehended nothing else, but that he was grieved. With an irresistible impulse, such as must have visited every heart at some mo- ment, she glided to his side, and clasping her arms around his neck, murmured, "( Dear, dear Willie!" Her spirit was so   broken, her heart was so wild, that there was room for but  one idea in her soul - to share his grief, if possible-- if not, at least to soothe its bitterness.              f "If my own hearts blood would bring him back to you, - Willie, if my own life could restore the life of your darling boy, you know how soon it would be given." Willie Wilde started from his seat, with a wild, glad ex-  clamation of joy, and caught her suddenly to his bosom! He had hoped in the years that were gone that she had loved him--now he knew it - was sure of it-the secret was' revealed--revealed in such a fierce storm of grief, that he 3- 'could not, if he would, disbelieve it! She might shrink from him now, as she did indeed- no matter; he knew she loved him! She had clung to him with an unmistakable impulse! She had repented it, but she loved him-- had loved him through all the years of their estrangement, and he held her in his grasp, so madly joyful, so fiercely triumphant, that her efforts to escape him were worse than useless! "Don't fear me, Alice," he said. "Don't fear me! Sit beside me, and lay your head upon my arm. No harm can come of it. Love me as one tortured, isolated human soul can love another!

And so he pleaded  with the yielding girl, and she, reproaching herself for lack of command, reproaching herself for loving where loving was sin, still loved an, still sinned on, and wept and clung t his  bosom, as she had wept and clung on the day he had saved her from the falling tree. Neglected as he had been-- slighted as he had been - crushed as he had been, he was more idolized in that woman's heart, there in his loneliness, than he ever could have been in a brighter sphere! A low, mocking laugh awakened them from their delicious dream, and in the open door they saw the brilliantqface of the young wife. A scene of confusion and horror followed upon their momentary joy. She saw a pistol gleaming in the upraised hand of Emma Wilde; she heard the loud report'-ehoing through the room; she saw the blood gushing from a fresh wound, as Willie fell from his seat. "Alice! Alice! wake up, for Heaven's sake! how pale you are! what are you dreaming about?" exciaimed the familiar voice of Willie Wilde, as he shook the agitated sleeper gently by the arm. "Willie i Willie! O my God! O heavenly Father! save him-- the sin was mine- save him-save-Wille and the eyes unclosed so wildly, that her companion began to fear that she was in reality insane.

I need not tell you how she loved. I should fail in language to convey a sense of the utter exclusiveness, the almost morbid devotion, she lavished upon him. His word, his look, his smile - there was nothing else for her in the wide earth but them. -But the world saw her in her earnestness, lavishing the wealth of her soul upon his shrine, and grew envious of the happiness which radiated her life. Then scandal, with its poisoned sting, wreathed itself around her, turning " trifles light as air " into seeming incon- stancy, with which his ear was feasted.

For two mortal years it had been before my i eyes; dark and shadow-crowned through the mornings, and all the long days, until the evening sunbeams came slanting over the city, to rest a moment on its worn timbers.  l For two mortal years, through the mornings, and all the i lone days, the continuous click, click of the workman's ham- I mer has been the only sound issuing from that curious speci- men of old-time architecture. Carriages may be seen at any moment flashing in through the rickety gates, and always re. turning with a freshened appearance, as if the antique mass of wood and mortar had the power to rejuvenate every thing  but itself. And there came a time in those years, when, from physical inability, I was unable to dream my accustomed dreams by my chamber window; but the old building must have been grateful for the interest I had evinced in its past; for, morn- ing after morning, when there were no clouds in the sky, the great gray mass was mirrored in the sunlight upon my chan- ber floor. So I knew it was there still, and grew at length to like its company, and to feel uncomfortable when the cloudy days came and obscured its shadow. Judge of my surprise, then, I may say horror,-for my love of this crumbling structure had become a mania, - -when, upon looking from my window for the first time in many weeks, I found in its stead a bright, new building, with a coat of the yellowest kind of yellow paint, taking upon itself more airs than was quite becoming for a young settler in our jostling little neighborhood.

Skewton, the    head and shoulders of my old friend the gable roof. And sheepishy enough ashamed of itself it did look in new tog- gery, and I could almost fancy the gables trying to explain lhow old and powerless they had been to resist the invasion, and begging me not to abate my interest in their history. Among the scorners of its affected juvenility was an aged and venerable man, whom I had often noticed in other days gazing with a dreamy, indolent smile upon its decaying tim- bers; but now he would hurry past as fast as his trembling limbs could carry him, and always with an unmistakable con- tempt upon his lip and in his eye. Once, and once only, he paused in his accustomed walk, and leaned heavily against f the gate. I saw the carriage of a wealthy merchant pass through so near that it must have grazed him; but he gave no sign of consciousness. I saw his lips trembling, and his eyes moistened; and then I saw no more, for my traitor of a thimble had betrayed me by rapping on the window, and the old man was hobbling up stairs before I quite knew what I intended asking him. L "The old house!"I exclaimed, as soon as he entered the room. "The old gable roof--what did tempt them to disfigure it so?"

And Mer' ry Wilder was continually going up this ladder, although he had travelled the same road for forty years.' In vain Mrs., Wilder - good soul - felt sure they should bring up at the poorhouse for his extravagance; in vain she protested that charity should begin at home; he would only catch her in his arms, kiss her lips until they forgot to pout, and go around doing good fas usual. Were any of his poorer neighbors sick or in distress, the whole house would be ransacked to find something, serviceable for them, and away he would go, up the aforesaid Jacob's ladder, with joy and thankfulness. Did any poor soldier cross his path, the last dollar, perhaps, he had in the world would be pressed upon him, and his own heart would leap up to meet the blessing and the prayer of the re- cipient of his bounty. O, a rare innkeeper was good Merriam Wilder, and a rare treasure did he possess in the frank, blithe, blue-eyed daugh- ter of his love, Kitty Wilder.  Kitty was not beautiful beyond what youth, and health, and innocency could make her; but the same generous, cordial, enthusiastic spirit, which charac- terized her father, was the equivalent for a more decided beauty of person. Unselfish in her affections, unused to re- straint, and untainted by the superficial gloss of fashionable life, she moved in her little sphere of usefulness, won the ap- proval, not alone of her own heart, but with every one with whole she chanced to meet.

No, no, no! With a mighty effort, he turned the current of his thought as much backward into the past for incentive, as for- ward into the future for hope. The waves of passion subsided, and the broad, deep current of his native energy rushed in and overpowered   it.

"The homes, the homes! how fair they gleam, In the hush of the midnight hours!" So wrote one whose own home had been made a mockery by the heart which should have cherished, and so thought I, as, lonely and alone, I sat gazing out upon the thousand dwell- ings lying all asleep in the rich moonlight, "Night sees strange sights, and hears strange sounds!" O that thoughts burdened with woe should come breaking in upon the gor- geous panorama of the still life lying around me! that the holy quietude -the peaceful, happy calm, beautiful from its very dreaminess, should cover sights and sounds from which the heart would shrink, and the spirit falter! Sorrow side by side with joy --innocence in the midst of guilt --purity in the grasp of vice - love met with loathing - trust repaid by treachery- hope gasping in the shadow of despair! - these are some of the sights and sounds, which penetrate to the hushed ear of night! And yet we close our hearts against the reality, and leave undone that which we might do, to relieve much of the misery springing in the very midst of a populous city. One o'clock!

Here comes a more boisterous party, making the air ring again with their vocally expressed detef- minations not to " go home till morning; " and unless the " guar- dians of the night " take them into consideration, I really don't think they will! And here - Omy God! creeping along in the dull, dim shadow--cringing closer and closer to the wall, as if she would bury herself in its darkness, comes one over whose life the cloud of shame has gathered! She pauses, and leans heavily against the gate out of which the musicians, after finishing their serenade, have just passed.

A STRAY LEAF FROI THE BOOK OF REAL LIFE. CHAPTER   I. TIME after time had the old City Hall clock doled out a requiem for the dead hours! Time after time had its echo swept with conflicting emotions to the thousand hearts within the range of its deep-toned voice! Night lay like a spell, cold, and dark, and shadowy, upon the city, and the few scattering lights which broke up the eternal gloom only looked the more dismal by the contrast, telling, as they did, of mid- night vigils at the bed of death, or, still more dismal, of the student, pale and careworn, wearing his life away ambi- tious aspiration, and yearnings for that bright goal which he might never reach. It was midwinter, and the cold, cutting wind had gone out with the sun, leaving a calm, bitter ail;r, which seemed to possess a double force of penetration, and required all the vigilance and protection that wealth could provide to counteract its influence. The noise of wheels and the perpetual tramp of busy feet were fast dying out upon the streets, and only here and there a traveller, muffled to his eyes, could be seen hurrying along with utmost speed to his place of destination. All was dark, and cold, and still in the heart of New York city; yet a mansion just upon its outer verge was gleaming and sparkling through the intense darkness surrounding it, as if a world of stars were centred where it stood. The whole city had been ravished of its beauty to make up   OR THE WORLD FROM M Y WINDOW.      145 tihe brilliant assemblage congregated in honor of the young bride, who but that day had taken her position as mistress of the wealth and affections of Willard Norris, the millionnaire. Well might the smile of triumph wreath the lip of Norris; for fairest among the crowd of witching forms and bright faces, like a pure thoulght flitting to and fro, stood out, in bold relief, his beautiful chosen one. She was the centre of at- traction to all eyes, and yet her own had but one look, one glance, and that was cllhained to his face. There is something holy to me in this utter devotion of a pure, fresh heart, even if its worship is laid upon a perverted' altar. There is no doubt then of the faith that has been pledged--there is no fear for trustingness that is past, or presentiment for the years that are to come.  Ah, if there is one thing on the earth purer than another--brighter than another-ho-lier than another-it is this entire confidence of the young bride when first she folds her spirit wings upon the bosom of her husband. The darkness, which lay like a death shroud around the dwelling, was occasionally broken up by glimpses of the moon struggling through the dense clouds; and in one of these intervals of light might have been seen a poor, wan face wandering sadly up and down the pavement, sometimes stopping to gaze into the happy countenances passing in and out of the mansion, as if hopeful for a glance of pity; then gathering her tattered fragment of a dress closely around her, to shield more securely from the air a child in her arms, she would resume her lonely walk in mournful silence. Once, and once only, she stopped suddenly, and her pale face drooped, in a listening attitude, to the door, while, her lips quivered, and her fingers were nervously pressed against 13  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7934-00000075"/> "6    HOME SCENES AND -HOME SOUNDS, the bell; the next moment she started back, drew the scant hood over a brow where want, and- suffering, and guilt had written a full volume of wretchedness, and hurried, as fast as her tottering limbs would bear her, from the dwelling of the rich man. On and on: she wandered, through the darkness and the storm--for the snow was now falling in heavy masses --looking from side to side for one glance of pity; and, failing in her search, she wound her arms more ten- derly around her infant, and sunk at last in utter exhaustion upon the steps of a neighboring dwelling. There was a rumbling of wheels in the distance, and as it neared her presence, she caught a glimpse of a splendid carriage, drawn by blood horses, whose eyes gleamed out like live coals in the darkness. With a shiver of horror, she strove to gain her feet as the carriage stopped by her side; but her strength had gone, and she could only cower down by the stone steps, as. the door opened, and Willard Norris alighted to hand out a lady visitor who had graced his assembly that night. ( Joy to you, Sir Bridegroom, said the lady, gayly kissing her hand, as she disappeared within her home. "Yes, joy," echoed the beggar, springing up with the tem- porary- strength excitement had given her. "Joy to the bridegroom-joy to the innocent bride--joy to the memory of the past- such joy," said she, clutching his arm with au- dacious wildness, looking very steadfastly in his face the while, ias the murderer feels with the axe suspended over hi1s head." At, another time Norris would have flung the insolent mendicant into the street beneath his horses' feet; but now there was a fascination in her fierce eyes, as they roved up and down his person, that held him spell-bound with terror and dismay.

A shade of fierce disgust broke over the woman's face; but her fictitious strength was fast leaving. her again helples as ever; and, to add to  er distress and hs peplexity, theas child awoke, and beoan la low tres ann his perplexity, "he, child awoke, and began a low, faint wailing, which even the mother's gentleness could not subdue. "My God! my God!" exclaimed the wretched man; "what can I do?" He ha only time to uter the words, and snatch the child fiom the woman's arms, when she fell a helpless mass upon the ground at his feet. At that moment, a female, who had been concealed in the shadow of the buildings, crept forward, and raised the inanimate form to her bosom. With quiet firmness she scattered handfuls of snow over the sad face lying so cold and still in her embrace, and continued her ef- frts, regardless of the man, or the child he held in his arms till she saw the eyes open languidly, and then close again with a shudder, as if some unpleasant vision had met their glance. " Place her in the carriage, and taklie her to my home," said the new comer, withoutraising her glance from her helpless charge. &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7934-00000076"/> "8    HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, A scornful frown darkened the features of Norris, and placing the child by its mother's side, he offered his well- filled purse, which being refused, he stepped into -the carriage, with its luxurious appointments of velvet and plush, whose elegance he would not tarnish, even in an act of humanity from which the proudest should not have shrunk, and was soon at the door of his own dwelling. , Hard-hearted that he is," said the stranger, looking about her for assistance. Just then a watchman turned the corner of the street, and seeing some one seemingly alone, he came up to inquire what purpose had brought a female out at such an hour. "Why, Nance," said he, swinging his lantern round until its light struck full in her face --" why, Nance, what in the name of common sense brought you out such a night as this? And - goodness me! what's that there on the sidewalk? It's a 'oman," said he, bending over her. "It's a real 'oman, and dead as a door nail at that. What do you think'll become on you now, Miss Nance? I told you all along how it would end with you." "Yes," said she, musingly, "in the gutter, in the poor- house, and-in the grave. You see I have treasured your words." "Yes; but what's the use of treasurin' on 'em if you don't profit by 'em, I'd wonder to know?" "I know, I know," murmured the fallen woman. "But come; while we are wasting time, this poor creature is dying. Take her up carefully, and carry her to my home. You know where it is. I'll follow with the child."

"Well, talking won't mend the matter, any how; so trot along- precious cold, though, blow me if it ain't;" and talking to himself--for his companion neither heard nor answered his comments - he stumbled along with his load, till he reached the low wooden buildings which the girl called home. The interior of the apartment presented a more comfortable aspect than one would have divined from its outer semblance. " I say, this ain't so bad, Nance, is it ? " said the watchman, laying the still senseless woman upon a bed in the corner of the room. " You're sort of cozy here; but give me the babby, and you do something for the other arrangement there. You 'omen know better how to fotch each other out of the high- strikes, than we men folk do. Is she alive ? That's the question." The girl placed her hand upon the woman's heart, and an- swered in the affirmative. " What's to be did, any how ?" questioned the watchman. " If I was to go arter any one, you know they wouldn't - that is to say, no decent 'oman wouldn't - come here - you knows that, Nance, well enough. They despises you because you are so wicked." The last words caused the girl to turn sharply round, and confront the watchman; but he looked so honest 'and good- humored, and withal so free from malice or intentional evil, that she only replied,- "'Tis well enough for those who have never in their lives shad a temptation to sin, to talk of wickedness." " She's coming to," said the watchman, as her eyes opened 13*   &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7934-00000077"/> O    HOME SCENES AND H031E SOUNDS, slowly and painfully. " It's all 0.

" Well, now, ain't you a pretty 'un, to try to make me stay here all the night, and into the precious morning, too, for the matter o' that ? Whose babby is it ? Hern, do you think ?" said he, pointing to the passive child, whose little, old face con- trasted strangely with its tiny frame. " It's hers," replied the girl.              - , "And who's its pappy ? Somebody ought to own it." " It is Norris's, the rich merchant." Norris's ! Land of hope and blessed promise ! It can't be. He's married only to-night. What would his new wife say if she heard you say such a thing ?" " Nevertheless, it is his," she pursued. "Did he say so?" questioned the watchman. "Come, .Nance, I've some interest in this affair. We can't have any town paupers with rich daddys. - Did he tell you it was his ? " No.", " How do you know, then ?" ((I read it in his face, at the very moment when he refused' his carriage to take its mother from the street; I saw his guilt on the surface of his heart, and I could have found it out, had it been buried a thousand times more deeply.

"Poor thing -poor thing," she murmured. "Child of shadows, who will be a mother to her when I am gone?  well," said the girl, drawing near the bed, and caressing the tiny form nestling to its dying mother. "'And a precious mother you'll make," began the watch- man; but there was a something almost pure and holy in the face of the courtesan, as she lifted the infant to her own em- brace, that checked the words upon his lips. And from  the crushed and hardened heart, a pure vow went up to Heaven, a grateful prayer of thanks, that some- thing had been given her to love, that she might yet wipe out some portion of the guilt of her past life, and in such efforts learn to struggle with and overcome misfortune. O, thank God, thank God! the human heart never does become utterly depraved. Thank God, that forevermore, down deep in the soul, hidden away beneath a mass of wild and tangled weeds, a pure stream, a living spring of clear and sparkling water, ripples its quiet way along, only waiting some master current to make its presence known. Thank God for his assurance that there is no such thing on earth as natural depravity; and those who advance such doctrine must either allow the depravity of the Almighty, or question that portion of the Bible which says, -6 God made man after his own image, and pronounced his work good." And would he, think ye, in his wisdom and judgment, pronounce that good which was but an artistic shell, wherein a distorted heart should fester and breed corruption? No, no; again, and a thousand times thank God, there is no such thing as natural depravity.

There was a leaf in her heart which she had never dared to read, and on it was written a yearning for affection, a pleading for sympathy, fromwhich her dark life had shut her out, but which, once having an object for those yearning and pleadings, would clasp it as the dearest thing on earth, and turn to that one object exclusively, and forever. Her existence had been a tissue of circumstances beyond her control. The hour that gave her birth losed up the portals between a human being and society. She was the offspring of crime in its most loathsome form. That fact she knew, and she stood alone in the world - something distinct from the race of men - a creature to be feared, scorned, and tam- pered with by those above her, and hated, envied, and cursed by such as were in the same grade with herself; yet hardened and cankered as her heart had been with vice, it became a holy thing in the sight of God; when she vowed in its depth to protect the helpless infant which would soon be motherless, and for its sake' to renounce forever the life that had sud- denly grown so irksome and disgusting to her eyes. ,, How dark the room grows !" said the dying woman, grop- ing about with her hands, as if to clear away the mist. " 0, no," said she, with sudden energy, l no, no; the darkness is in my own heart. I am dying here among strangers, and that, too, on his wedding night! 3My God ! my God! Cn he be happy ?" "Of whom do you speak?" said the girl, gladly availing herself of any information that might in future assist her in the protection of her new charge. There was no reply; but fumbling nervously about her tat- tered dress, the woman at length produced a bundle of worn   OR THE WORLD FROM   1Y WINDOW.    153 and soiled papers, almost illegible from constant perusal, and placing them in the hands of her questioner, extorted the prom- ise that, until her child had become'of an age to understand and judge of their purport, the contents should never be revealed. "What do you call her?" still questioned the girl. "Leoline,"  replied the mother, "Leoline, the Child of Shadows." "How old is she?" "One year to-night." For a moment all was hushed in that chamber of death. The infant nestled closer to its dying mother, as if conscious of the terrible bereavement awaiting it. The little thin hand strayed up among the matted and tangled hair, and the face, so old in its expression, pressed up against the cold cheek, and seemed wondering to miss the accustomed caress. A harsh, rattling sound - a quivering of the lips - a quick con- vulsive shudder - a low, deep moan from the orphaned child, and all was over. The trembling light of a single lamp fell upon the figures of the strange group - the terrified watch- man - the -repentant girl - the living infant, clasped in the arms of her dead mother - and so passed the first birthnight of Leoline, the Child of Shadows. CHAPTER   II. COLDLY and chill the sun crept up through the gray clouds of morning, and the wind swept mournfully through the crev- ices of the building, as if chanting a dirge for the dead within its walls. A neat, plain coffin was standing upon a table in the room, and in it were sleeping the remains of one whose life had been a scene of tumult and of strife; yet there she lay,  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7934-00000079"/> with a     smile upon her lips, which had seldom rested there while living, and the thin hands folded over a bosom as still and quiet in its death slumber as if it had never been agi- tated by stronger impulses than governed it at that mom ent. A vast crowd had collected within and around the  walls; some drawn hither by curiosity, some swept along with the current, and a few, a very few, were induce  t enter the dwell- ing of the abandoned woman from pure motives of sympathy. Among that few was a clergyman, whose piety and charity were alike proverbial. Young in years, but with -an intimate knowledge of life, and much experience in the reading of the human eart, his vast energies had ever been directed in one channel-that of retrieving the fallen, and extending encour- agement and sympathy to such as felt an inclination to retrace the steps of a career of crime. The greater tlhe criminals, the more strenuous were his efforts for their redemption, and his eloquence and earnestness failed in its..effect not once in a hundred times. He it was who had been summoned to per- form the last sad rites over the senseless form of the unregret- ted beggar.       I Cowering down in the corner of the room, where the light scarcely penetrated, the better to escape the curious eyes searching her face, drooped on a low chair the occupant of the building. In her arms reposed the motherless child, as mo- tionless and quiet as if she had grown to marble. With a subdued and plaintive murmur, the pleasant voice of the cler- gyman drifted in the secluded corner where she sat, bearing in its tones detached sentences of holy import; and never was the beautiful funeral service of the Episcopal church given with more touching pathos than over the corpse lying there in the outcast's dwelling. The services over, the coffin was opened for~   the inspection of those wishing to examine its contents before being deposited in its grave-home. At the instigation of the clergyman, the girl arose from- her low seat, and brought the child forward to take a last look of all that was its moth- er. For a moment it gazed in stupid wonder upon the shroud- ed form; then the thin lips quivered, and with a murmured exclamation of " Mother," the little head sank down upon the cold face in the coffin, and she wept and sobbed as if her young heart had broken, and was gushing out with her tears. It was with much difficulty they separated the infant from its mother; but when it was accomplished, and the body taken to the stranger's graveyard, a few kind and good women re- mained behind with their pastor, to devise some means for its future destination. No inducement; however, could prevail upon the girl to part with it. "Give me work," said she, in passionate supplication; "give me work. Nothing can unwind the tangled web of my dark life; nothing can undo the past; nothing can make it as if it had never been; nothing - -O  my God! -nothing can make me pure, and true, and real; but don't- don't deprive me of the only thing given me to live for and love. Don't take from me all that can subdue this reality of wretchedness. I know you think me incapable of any good or honest purpose, and I know, too, as well as you, that there is nothing in the whole world so utterly alone - so utterly friendless --so utterly de- graded as I am ; but give me work; let me feel there is some- thing dependent upon me, looking up to me, and you will see that I have energy to atone for at least a portion of my past errors." The earnestness of her manner was sufficient evidence of her sincerity; and after a hurried consultation, during which  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7934-00000080"/> 156    HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, time she had sunk, tearful and sobbing, in her old seat in the corner, the parties present determined to leave the infant, sup- ply her with work, and thereby test the firmness of her reso- lution. A chapter was read from the Bible, and upon the ut- terance of that most beautiful sentence, "Neither do I con- demn thee," the weeping girl, for the first time, raised her eyes, and encountered the deep, pure glance- of the clergyman riveted upon her face. It was mesmeric in its influence. A calm, holy peace pervaded her hitherto disturbed spirit; the sobs Iwere hushed, the tears ceased to flow, and when her com- panions departed, they left a thoughtful and a true woman where they had found a desolate, lonely girl. CHAPTER III. I have a fair and gentle friend, Whose heart is pure, I ween, As ever was a maiden's heart At joyous seventeen; She dwells among us like a star, That from its bower of bliss Looks down, yet gathers not a stain From aught it sees in this. - MRS. WELBY. THE above words rippled through my heart, set to music of my own, on the evening which first brought me into inti- mate acquaintance and the girlish confidence of Leoline Norris, the adopted daughter of the rich merchant. The read- er will have divined at ionce, that the orphaned infant and Leoline Norris are one and the same person. And now, in- stead of progressing, it will be necessary to retrace my work, and pick up the stitches dropped between the time of the fu- neral of her mother and her subsequent adoption into -the 3   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.      157 house of r. :Norris. All childhoods are very nearly alike in incident and reality, and Leoline, by great care and lattention was preserved from the evils which otherwise must have fallen upon her unprotected path. Through the instrumentality of kind friends, the low dwelling, that had been dedicated to crime, was exchanged for one, if not more imposing in actual appearance, at least free from the taint which characterized the outcast's refuge. The history of Nancy Arnold was known but to the few persons who shared her grief on the memorable day of the funeral. Rumors were occasionally afloat of an unpleasant nature; but her harmless life, her devotion to her young charge, and more than all, the diligence and unwearied care she exhibited in its culture, both phjysically and mentally, dis- armed the malice of those most disposed to investigate what seemed mysterious in her past-life. But there was one fold of her heart to which even her warmest friends were not ad- mitted. And in it was hidden a deep and earnest love for the  clergyman, who first taught her to hope and live. There it lay - that love for him--down deep in her heart, like a beautiful flower, which had sprung from the very ashes of corruption, and warmed into actual existence by the sun of affection when it first beamed upon the midnight of her spirit. None knew of its existence; none suspected, and least of all the object that had grown into her heart, ingrafting therein the germ of a  purer and a better soul, that the calm and peace - ful exterior shrouded a passion which even its o wner feared to analyze. It was the wasted affection of early years, which, diverted from its proper source, had turned to the 'wildness and intensity of creature love.  She could sacrifice her ownr. life, her own h eart's blood, if needful, to secure the happiness "  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7934-00000081"/> 158    HOME SCENES AND HOZIE SOUNDS, of Leoline, but not her love. O, no; not her love; that was so deeply implanted in her soul, that if it died out, her heart must die with it. Strong minded and vigorous as she was, with the flush of health on her cheek and brow, this insidious disease was fast closing up the avenues of her life, impercepti- ble even to herself, but with a certainty which all too soon would make itself felt and acknowledged.' In his presence she wore an, air of spiritual repose, of quiet confidence, that embodied something of religion, and much of love. Day by day he was at her side, assisting in the duties of educating her young charge, forming the mind of her pupil, and by his presence and encouragement, sustaining her in the various tri- als which were inevitable to the station she occupied. One evening, after a conference unusually restrained, the clergyman took her hand in his, and gazing into her eyes, with the same pure look which seventeen years before had subdued her heart into quietude, within the shadows of her dark home, said, in a firm voice, - "Leoline loves me!" With a quick, convulsive shudder, she raised her head, and the face, deathly pale from the sudden revulsion of feeling, was disclosed to his gaze in the full light. "How pale you are, Nancy! What is the matter?" ex- claimed her companion, with a surprised look. "Nothing, nothing," she replied, " only the suddenness of the news, the -the -in fact, I have never thoughlt that the time might come, -when Leoline would forsake mze to love another." "But she does not forsake you, Nancy.

When next she raised her head, the speaking face had grown passive, and the only trace of emotion was perceptible in its death ly hue.

Her companion was silent from astonishment. He had never seen such an exhibition of passion in her before, and not divining the cause, he began to fear that her intellect was shat- tered by some slow process of disorganization, before hidden from his view. "To think," she pursued, " that shame and dishonor should have been my portion through life--to think that no man might in honor call me wife - no woman sister; to think that the world, with its thousand eyes, should feast upon my dis- grace, with its thousand tongues should whisper the abhorrence in which I am held-- O, it is too, too dreadful; " and she sunk down in utter prostration of spirit at the :feet of her com- panion. "O, save me, save me," said she, clinging to him as if her only hope in life was at his disposal. ".Save you! from what?" he questioned. "From myself!  There! I am calm now. The storm is over," said she, wiping her eyes, and rising from her kneeling posture. "Now, what more have you to say? Leoline loves you! You see I am calm now. You would marry Leoline: do you remember the disparity in. years? You were a man when she was born." "It is that which troubles me," said he musingly. "What I desire is, that you should question her regarding such a circumstance, see how her affections tend, and if she should prove willing to forget the distance between us - for I know she loves me  " "Yes, yes," said the woman, impatiently.

The retreating form of the clergyman passed from sight just as the garden door opened to admit a sunbeam in the person of Leoline Norris. She was not beautiful; yet the keenest observer would fail to tell what was lacking to make up the sum comprised in that word. She was not beautifil ; and yet the clear, transparent face w as relieved by masses of ark fair, which fell drooping over her shoulders.

"O blin -blind --blind that I was," muttered Nancy Arnold, " not to have seen this, in their many years of com- panionship."

If we should both live, he will be an old man while I am a young woman, and then I can repay him back, in devotion, all his kindness to me," mused Leoline rself , She shall at least be happy," said the woman to herself; and leaving the room suddenly, Leoline was left to her own happy fancies. Dear Leoline! She was fast outgrowing the shadows of her childhood. Half an hour afterwards, a lady of tall and imposing ap- pearance was seen to ring the bell at Willard Norris's man- sion on   Street. She was invited in, and the next hour sion on   t'ee.              wit the closely secluded in deep and earnest conversation with the wife of the millionnaire  rs. Norris was one of the few real women on earth. She had married for love- had reverenced her husband, and in the many years of their wedded life, had seen no fault, nor shadow of a fault, in his manner or charac- ter. If any foibles of his unmarried years ever came to her knowledge, she rejected them as unworthy a place in her mind, and scorned the informer of such foibles. If ever he referred to past excesses,she excused them as the indiscretions of youth' and inexperience; and knowing the correct view she had taken as regards her own happiness, he had partially prepared her for the revelation which was now being made   i I :!      OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOIW.      163 by NancyArnold. The papers which were left in her charge by the mother of Leoline, being examined for the first time, were found to contain letters of Norris's, together with a marriage i   certificate, which was evidently forged. There w ere tears in the blue eyes Of Mrs. Norris when she again appeared, but with a kind word she dismissed the cause of her disturbance. If possible, her manner to her husband, on his return from business, was more than ever affectionate and solicitous, and when they were alone, she clasped her arms around his neck, and in earnest tones, related the knowledge she had acquired of the existence of Leoline-- told of her present position- the love of the clergyman, whose name was held in great regard, even by those so far superior in worldly wealth - and last of all, interested her husband in, the fate of the woman to ,   whose protecting care his child had been intrusted.  It is not for me to say how much of penitence there was in the deep glance he gave his wife, as he held her fondly to his bosom, or how much affection there might have been for the child so cruelly abandoned with its mother. I only know that "sin brings its own punishment," and "every act of crime works out its own retribution." One month from that day Leoline was established in the house of Willard Norris, ostensibly as his adopted daughter, while her companion-mother, poor Nancy Arnold, was in the grave. Mental suffering had un- dermined her physical strength, and fever followed exhaustion of the heart, which soon terminated in her death. Leoline's grief was intense and inconsolable for a brief time; but, child- like, it became soon absorbed in other impulses, connected with her affianced husband. Years have passed since the above incidents transpired- years which have left their snows upon the pastor's head, and  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7934-00000084"/> 164     HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, sobered the quick pulse of Leoline. A pretty cottage, on Staten Island, half smothered with vines and blossoms, gleams out in picturesque wildness by the water's edge, and oftentimes, when the sun is down, and shadows are gathering around the island, an old man and his young wife may be seen walking quietly up and down the shore, or seated under some fragrant vine, chatting pleasantly to each other. The origin of Leoline was never divulged to her, and the child of shadows became one of the brightest sunbeams that ever lent its radiance to earth. Mrs. Norris, by exerting her influence in a true woman's sphere -that of kindness and devotion--soon had the happiness of knowing that to such influence was owing her husband's refor- mation. .They are still living in the city of New York, reduced in means, but happy in themselves and respected by their as- sociates; and it was only during the past winter, while spend- ing a week in that city, that I had from the lips of Mrs. Nor- ris the history of LEOLINE, THE CHLD OF SHADOWS. SONG OF THE IMPROVISATRICE. THERE'S a balm on the air, and it drifts along Like the fragrant breath of a fairy throng; There's a spell of love on the restless deep, And the winds are still, and the waves asleep; And the fringed lids of the summer flowers Are folded down in their woodland bowers; But their lips are bright with a dewy flush - Do they dream of love, through the twilight hush?

All around and about, as far as the eye can span, is spread one broad, bright, dazzling sheet of snow. Heaps of dead leaves are buried beneath larger heaps of the glittering  livery of old Winter. The brushwood along the roadside, bending down beneath the min- iature pyramid lodged upon its branches, looks like marble statuary, and the covered knolls like drifts of snow. Even the forest in the distance, with its thousand frosted arms blaz- ing in the rich light, looks a regal home for the Ice King's reign.- Very splendid indeed  is theft great forest, with its wealth of sparkling crems ; yet with all its outside radiance, we know that it is blasted and desolate now -that it is bleak and frozen, like a heart breathed upon by neglect. But summer will come again to the forest and to the heart: so away with all reflections which can disturb the harmony of the hour de- -voted to revelry and joy. How beautiful! What a kaleido- scope of living, moving, exultant pictures! What a mass of life, energy, fire, and ambition! Men, women, and children partake alike of the spirit of the scene; even the animals, in their mute eloquence, seem to understand that some point of contention is to be gained, and to strain every nerve in the contest.

They are crack whips--the larger half of them--with quick eyes to take in advantage and danger, and cool intrepidity to steer clear of the Ree drivers, the great rock-a-head upon the pleasure grounds. Here they come, the Rees outfooted, and nowhere to be seen! And now the excitement is at its height. The cheering cry, the shrill neigh, the loud hurrah! spread out in a full chorus, which loses itself in the far-off stillness, followed by another and another equally exultant and simultaneous.

GRACY GREEN. IN the lonesomest cabin on the verge of the lonesomest bog in all New England sat a fair young girl gazing steadily in among the coals, which were glowing and sparkling in fan- tastic figures upon the clean-swept hearth. It, was winter, and the snow had drifted up, and was lying in great heaps all around the cabin, and in among the trees, and over the frozen bog, until, to loodk from the window, one would but wonder that the occupant of the only dwelling for miles and miles away could expect a visitor, or, even so expecting, could hope any one would venture life and limb by an attempt to cross that reach of snow and ice. The wind swept around the cabin in fitful gusts, and the long, leafless branches rattled against the windows with a dreary sound; yet the mind of the: quiet girl had gone down with memory into her well- stored treasure house, and until a fiercer gust sent the door from its wooden fastening, she seemed scarcely to be aware that a storm had come up, and that a fresh layer of snow had already beern added to the groundwork of the forest. "O, I hope he won'tcome to-night," she murmured, as she arose to secure the door more firmly from the wind's invasion.   OR, THE WORLD FROM IY WINDOW.      171 "I  do hope he won't."  And a shadow of disappointment settled upon her face, which seemed to belie the words she  was uttering. Placing more wood upon the fire, she again resumed her seat, but with less abstraction, and began stitching away at some work wlich had been lying on a table l:r her side. Three times ehad the great crazy-looking clock in the corner chimed out its requiem for the dead hours, and three times had Gracy Green peered out of the window into the snow, which was fiallingfaster thani ever, and piling up in little ridges upon the frosty vines, whichl stood out, stark anid stifT, under the eaves of th!e cabin, like curious specimens of sculpture. "It was later than this last night, and yet I hope lie won't come throulgh the storm--indeed I do," she murmured, resuming her seat. F or another hour she plied her needle as diligently as ever, humming the while a plaintive air, which seemed well to accord with her humor; but at length the plaintive tone grew fainter and fainter, and then died tawly altogrethler; and lean- ing her head upon er hand, the blue eyes which had been so bright and restless grew dim and red, and tear after tear lay glittering in the light upon the table where they had fallen. The little room was humble and very quiet; yet it could not be its loneliness which affected her so much, for she had been accustomed to that from her childhood; -nor could it have beeni terror for the increasing storm which caused her tears to flow ; for, year after year, for seven winters, she had listened alone to its dis mal sobbings. But still her tears flowed on, and still the bload blaze of the replenished fire flashed out witl sober cheerfulness, and sent its brilliant light out through the windows, and down the long reach of' smooth snow that  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7934-00000089"/> 172    HoME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, covered the bog - luckily enough for a venturesome traveller, who, but for its guidance, must inevitably have lost the half- obscured path which connected the village on the one side with the lonesome little cabin on the other. The rattling of the vines against the window, or the falling of the embers from the polished irons, startled her from her revery, and rising from her seat, she opened the door, and gazed out into the outer darkness; but a strong gust of wind sent the flames dancing up the chimney, and extinguished the last ray of hope in the heart of the disappointed watcher. Dear reader, if you would learn where human hopes and human sympathies are most strongly developed, where (O rare and appreciated quality)- poverty and affluence may be seen hand in hand upon the byways of life, and where pride and avarice are the few unwelcome guests to whom we would gladly say, "Not at home," come to our village when the sum- mer song and bloom have drifted off upon the autumn air, when humble homes and hearts are glittering with the cheerful hoard of social enjoyments reserved for the long evenings of snow and frost, and where the blaze and warmth of the crackling fire is not more genial than the welcome you will receive from its humble inhabitants. Come in the winter, dear friends, for the summer, like a summer friend, has its own proclivity to selfishness. I make this digression, partly because I have an overwhelming love for that little village nestling down within speaking distance of the rare old Kenne- bec, and partly because it might seem impossible to those whose experience has been within and among the grades of city life, that a poor girl, who had little but her virtue to recommend her, and who at best had made a precarious living by the gathering and vending of berries, should have found   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.      173 countenance and protection among the many to whom Dame Nature had been more liberal. And to say the truth, there lihad been some ]little squeamishness evinced among the leaders of the ton, for we know what fashion is made of, right well, down there among the pines and maples, and know, too, that to follow its dictates there are too many first principles to up- root; so we leave it to such as like the labor and dignity it involves. Gracy Green had been an orphan almost from her birth. While she was in her earliest infancy, her father had been killed by the falling of a tree where he was laboring, and of her mother she could only remember a pale, thln face, and a pair of lips which had startled her with their coldness, when pressed to her own with a murmured, "Try not to forget me, Gracy, dear." And she had tried, but the memory was indis- tinct, and always came wandering back to her old grand- mother, and how she should keep want from the door of their humble cabin, and whether, as she grew to be a large girl, she should be able to go to school and dress like the girls in the village opposite; and somehow even then the vision of Henry Marsden would mingle with her thoughts, although she knew well enough that nothing on earth could make them stranger to each other than that long step between poverty and pride. Not that he was proud, although many a one with less capital than he possessed would have been; but there was a warm, genial heart, and[ a daring, joyous spirit in his breast, which folded its wings against every impulse except such as had their birth from kindliness and good humor. He was the only child of fithe proud, unlovable widow of Captain Marsden ; and although through the frostwork of her rigid dignity there was no apparent affection for the frank, generous boy whom every  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7934-00000090"/> [    HOME SCENES AND IIOME SOUNDS,           v body loved, still we all felt that there was more of the real material of humanity under the cold exterior than she chose the world should see. All that maternal solicitude could con- ceive, and all that money or influence could effect, to educate and refine her boy, as befitting one to whom, in time, would fall the large estates now at her disposal, was sedulously accom- plished; and although, to the scandal of the village, she had placed him an infant from her own breast into the bosom of Mrs. Bray, she did not refuse to overlook the fosterage of his mind, with a vague hope, it was thought, of instilling into his manners and habits some portion of her own aristocratic sen- timents. Idle, idle, all. The birds and .the flowers were not more fresh and free in their own wayward beauty than was the heart of wild Henry M3arsden. He was a studious boy enough in general, but somehow, when the long summer days would come, there was a bright young face looking coaxingly up between his fancy and his books-the face of Gracy Green mirrored in the brushwood of the blueberry bushes, which, will-o'-the-wisp like, led him to the bog, where he was sure to find'her. "Here I am, Gracy," he would say, turning a double som- erset on the first bit of grass that met his roving glance. "But your mother--your lesson," Gracy would plead, with a half-roguish smile, which always finished the business. "O, bother, nonsense,! I've got my lesson all by heart; that is to say, I'm going to get it this evening, and that's time enough." So Gracy would be convinced of his superior judgment, and allow him to lighten her labor by filling the little wooden pail with purple fiuit, while she chatted away under the shade of some extravagantly-tall bushes of'fern and dogwood.    OR THE WORLD FRO3f MYr WINDOW.      175 And so they passed on from childhood to maturity, never acknowledged lovers, yet loving each other as only those love who dream that human hope and human courage can shelter ftheir aspirations from the storms of life. But a change came at last, and Gracy Green was alone in the world. The old grandmothier, for whom she had toiled and hoped so long, was laid away in the sumach wood by the side of her father and mother. Then the villagers came to her with assurances of kindness, and offers of a home amongst them; but she only replied with a respectful and decided "No!" She was grate- ful for their kindness--would always, always remember it; but she was born in the cabin, had lived there all her life, and should not feel so free and independent elsewhere. She had learned to work very neatly, and there was a sufficiency of plain sewing to be done in the village, and nobody could do it so satisfactorily as Gracy; so from the morning till the evening she stitched away patiently and diligently, that the last few hours at the closing in of day might be devoted to her con- stant companion, Henry Marsden. Childlike and simple, she never dreamed that impropriety could be attributed to such companionship; so, when an old gossip of the village told her that people were making remarks, she opened her blue eyes in startled wonder, and indignantly repelled the insinuation. It was of these things she had been thinking on the evening of which I write, and of Henry Marsden ; for again and again, as it often had done before, arose the memory of his sympa- thy, when, as a child, working for her, tending her, pitying her loneliness, he had voluntarily exiled himself from those whose education and refinement befitted them better to be his companions. Then the vision of her sorrowful, childish self following her last relative to the grave swept across her, and Y         ..  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7934-00000091"/> *s    HOME SCENES AND HO1ME SOUNDS,       -  she remembered how he, of all others, had wept with and for her, and how, when all of earth's love that she could ever count upon had faded from the lonely, anxious cabin, she still saw a gleam of sunlight in the affectionate kindness of her old playmate; but why that memory was fraught with pain, or why there came over her face that momentary cloud of startled anguish and anxiety, only those can comprehend, who, from a long dream of security, suddenly awaken to find their own hearts folded up in the keeping of one who may not value the possession. While she was still indulging in a retrospection of the past,- a scene of peculiar interest to her was passing in the family mansion of the :Sarsdens. The stately mother, with more than usual severity,- had been questioning and advising her impetuous boy. "And you love her?" she questioned, as if doubting the assurance he had just given. Love her?" "Love her, mother- love her! Love Gracy Green, and with all due respect to you, wishing to be dutiful, and all that sort of thing, I shall never marry any other body - n-e-v- er!" and he brought out the word as if that was an end to the whole matter. "Miss Mayhew is refined," began the mnother. "Miss Mayhew be blamed for anl affected, stupid fool!" chimed in the wilful boy, rising and walking impetuously about the room. The slightest shade of anger was visible on the face of Mrs. Marsden, but she stood too essentially upon her dignity to allow its exhibition. "Do you know, Henry, your nightly visits to the - the cabin of the blueberry girl have compromised her with the  villagers? -that her reputation has suffered by your thought- lessness?" Henry stopped short in his restless walk, and fixed his ginlace upon his mother. "She lives alone, a mile away from any other habitation; every one knows when you cross the- bog--no one knows when you return; and of course, such being the fact, an un- limited amount of scandal has been engendered." ," There has?" questioned tHarry, as if it were impossible that scandal and the name of Gracy Green could be coupled. "There has. You should have remembered that." I never gave the subject a thought. Gracy seemed so holy, so sacred in her loneliness, that I should as soon have dreamed of the angels being censured as of wrong being im- puted to her." "Of course, under these circumstances it will be impossible for you to marry her, even if any position could have rendered it feasible." "Of course it will be impossible for me to do any thing else but marry her, after having, as you say, given occasion to scandal by my thoughtlessness. It is the only restitution I can make." For some minutes Mrs. Marsden sat leaning her cheek upon her hand in thoughtful silence, while Henry continued his restless walking. "Henry," at length she said. " you may or may not know 'how much my pride and the dignity of our family are involved in your choice of a wife. You are young now.

Henry did not remain to hear the conclusion of the sentence, but, regardless of the falling snow, darted friom the door, and was soon lost to view among the firosty bushes which skirted the path leading to the bog. Of the confidences of that evening in the lonely cabin, of the hopes to be cher- ished and the plans to be matured, and more than all, of the interchange of deathless love, which each had felt, and each had thought concealed, my pen refuses to write) feeling how inadequate it would be to their portrayal. Enough that the morning light looked upon eyes in Mrs, A3arsden's home that joyousness had kept open the livelong night; and that the cold dawn, creeping in over the bog, crossed the remnant of a candle guttering down into its socket, and fell upon the form of a beautiful girl, on her knees by the table, with her hands clasped in prayer! Ay, kneel to thy Maker, dear, gentle girl - cling to his throne, and gather strength to bear the shadow and the gloom which are just above thy head! Thou, so pure and good, so joyous and so happy, kneel to thy God, and pray for the future, for need, indeed, wilt thou have of the consolation which only prayer can bring i "Nine--ten   eleven,' counted WMrs. Marsden, as the clock struck the hours. 44 What can keep Henry in bed so long?" and leaving the room, she stepped softly up stairs, and tapped at the door of his chamber. Receiving no answer, she unclosed it, and with a noiseless step approached the bed where he was lying. His deep, heavy breathing assured her at least of his safety, and with the same noiseless step she was retreating as she had come, when her eye was caught by the bright, vivid flush burning in the centre of each cheek.

The hair lay i    around his broad forehead'in damp, tangled masses, and the irregular, labored respiration, which she had mistaken for healthful slumber, now convinced her that from some cause af deep fever had settled upon him. With more tenderness than she had ever before evinced, she pressed her lips to his brow; yet slight as the contact was, it was sufficient to disturb the light, restless slumber which influenced him for the moment. "I have had such a beautiful dream!" said he, attempting to rise upon his elbows; but even that exertion was too much for him, and he sank back again exhausted upon the bed. a Tell Gracy to come to me--I can see her there - now- in the corner; how kind it was of you to let her come and live with us " His mind was wandering, and with a startled, colorless face Mtrs. 5Marsden hastened below, and gave orders for immediate medical attendance. All that day long, and through the night and the next day, the mother sat by his side; yet always with the same cold look of digrnified reserve about her, never leaving her post unless for a few moments, to give some new order from his physician, and then resigning her chair to old nurse Bray, as the only one who could fill it with a proper degree of self-possession. Self-possession! The stately mother did not see the withered old arms gather about her sick child, as the door closed upon her form; she did not hear her sob and murmur, as no one else could have done- "My poor suffering boy -my darling, darling# child," nor dream that the old withered cheeks, so seemingly composed, had been wet with tears which ceased to flow only with the I     echo of her steps upon the stairs.

The doctor had remained longer than usual, and, as the door closed, Henry caught the words --"No hope," uttered in a low tone. His eyes-were shut, but he was conscious that his mother had been' standing by his side; he heard her pass away to the window with a low, stifled sob, and then the door unclosed and closed again, and nurse Bray had taken his hand within her own. "Tell me," said he, after a momerit's thought, "is there any one here but us two?" "No one, Henry. Why?" questioned the nurse. "Was mother crying when she went down stairs just now? Don't tell her I asked; but I thought -she is so proud and cold -I thought it might have been Gracy!" Poor Gracy! Alone in her little cabin, she had wondered for three days and nights what had happened to Henry- alone in her cabin, forgotten by all but her suffering lover, against whom in her heart there was beginning to arise the shadow of a reproach. "Send for her at olnce!" replied Mrs. Marsden, as the nurse whispered to her that Henry had asked for Gracy Gireen! And a messenger bears the ill tidings to the lonely little cabin, wondering the while what the blueberry girl can have to do with the rich Marsdens. And Gracy learns it all -that Henry is ill - dying. She does not weep, but kneels down where she knelt, in her happiness, only three nights be- fore, and presses her cold lips convulsively to the little Bible in her hands! Our Father, who art in heaven, gather thine arms about the children of thy love, whose hearts are stricken by thy hand, for only thou canst bind the bruised reed, or bring comfort to the afflicted! Through the crackling snow- and over the lonesome bog Gracy wends her way to the man-   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.       181 sion of the Marsdens. Henry has asked for her repeatedly since the good old nurse told him she was sent for, but now he has sunk into a gentle slumber! The mother, who has seen Gracy from the window, is at the hall door, waiting to receive her; but not one jot of her old-time stateliness is abated, nor does she greet her with any token of feeling other than with the simple comment that Henry is ill, and has sent for her! Down the long reach of glittering marble, and up the winding stairs, trembling till she can scarcely walk, yet trying to -subdue her agitation, she follows the calm, dignified mother. Her hand is on the door, and her heart beating as if it would leap from her bosom. She sees the pale face of her lover, and, forgetful of every thing else, she flings her arms about him with passionate vehemence, sobbing and murmuring,- "O, dear, dear friend! O, so to love and so to lose!" And the stately mother lifts the tresses which have fallen light and smooth across his mouth - she might have spared herself the trouble, for there was no breath there to disturb them-- the son and lover was dead! And the morning came as the evening had come before, and many more mornings and evenings, and Gracy sat with the stately mother by the side of the dead, herself almost as pulseless; buti of the pent-up moaning, the contest, and the suffering which was lived within that darkened room, none knew but Him who ordereth all things well! At length the day comes which is to witness the last on earth of Henry Marsden; and Gracy, no longer able to repress her tears, breaks out every few moments into wild fits of weeping. The cold, proud mother talks with the village rector of strength to bear, and of fortitude to overcome- affliction ; but Gracy does not hear them! They say too, how sinful it is to mourn for 16   &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7934-00000094"/> the dead, whom God has taken to himself, and she feels that it is something intended for her ear, and she knows it is wrong, wicked, it may be, to mourn as she does, and wishes she could sit there by the corpse motionless and tearless as the proud mother! But for this knowledge and this wish she does not weep the less, but keeps on murmuring in her heart, though no one hears the words- " O, dear, dear friend! Oj lonely onward years! O, so to love, and so to lose!" until the clock strikes three, and the old village bell begins its dole- ful music. She does not close her eyes, but sits in the corner of the room where the shadows are deepest, and presses her clasped hands over her mouth, that her moanings may not be heard. And so she sits through the singing and the prayer; and she hears the reverend pastor commend the bereaved' mother to the care of Almighty. God, and she has an indis- tinct idea that mention is made of the lonely orphan girl, the betrothed of the deceased, which causes her to press her hands still more closely over her mouth, to check-the swelling agony. At length the singing, and the prayer, and the consoling words are all over, and the shroud is gathered away from the pale face, that the friends may look their last upon the dtst before them. Proud and calm as ever, the mother bends over the corpse of her only child! She does not touch the lifeless lips, or move a muscle of her own colorless face, but as she turns away, the heavy crape veil falls as if by accident, and no one sees the quivering lips, striving so hard for control, and no one knows that mother's agony, as the last grappling-iron of hope is torn from her heart with the dead boy before her. And Gracy sees it all, but only comprehends that Henry is dead--the dear companion of her lonely, loveless years! An old woman, who had been kind to her in childhood, comes for-    ward, with rough sympathy, and leads her to the coffin, where she bends down, in a passionate fit of weeping, and, forgetful of the crowd, murmurs, ', Never more to see him--never more-.0, dear, lost friend," and continues sobbing  and murmuring until she is led back again, and takes her place mechanically in the mourning tlain, by the side of the stately mother! And they move slowly out through the little gate, and onward to the gravey ard in the edge of the maple grove. They pass the old farmhouse in the meadow, where nurse Bray is standing in the door, weeping for her foster child, as if he had been her own.  They wind slowly round the hill, where Rover, Henry's favorite dog, lies restlessly in his ken- nel; and as they pass him, a low, deep howl-startles the-crowd by its novelty, and  Gracy again presses her hand to her mouth, to shut back the cry that had nearly found utterance! Onward-   onward through the crackling snow, which diligent hands had that morning shovelled away, till the procession halts and circles around the new-made grave. It is a cold, chilly afternoon, and the tombstone against which Gracy leans for support is bossed over with sleet and ice ; but she does not feel it, nor look into the grave, nor at the coffin, but keeps her eyes resolutely closed till the dust she has so loved in its ma- ierial form is given back to the dust from which it sprang. '"He is ntot dead, but sleepeth!" exclaims the pastor in his old, solemn voice, and a faint smile, for the first time, hovers about the lips of Gracy Green.           - "-le is not dead, but sleepeth!" Believe it, dear suffering girl--take it to thy heart, to lean and rest upon in the days of its desolation, for, of all our heavenly Father's assurances there are none like t lat to reconcile thee to thy bereavement!

It is only Gracy, kneeling down for the last time to look in upon her lover. "He is not dead, but sleepeth!" murnur the thin white lips, almost inaudibly: It is scarcely a moan, for the pale face has drooped down, and lies pressed against the snow heaped up by the grave. Take her up gently-she will not shrink from yoor hold, for the music of the winds, and the whispering of the trees, and the song; of birds are hushed to her forever!"/ He is not dead, but sleepeth." And clinging to that beautiful hope, she had " gone out with the tide," and the waves had closed over her, leaving a loving memory, as a ripple on the surface of village life, to tell where her bark of love had foundered! A broken heart! There is something more than fiction in the term, believe me! OUR LIZZIE. A PORTRAIT DRAWN FROM LIFE.

And so she died! madly, rashy, and wickedly; but the world had grown so cheerless to her -she had watched the fading out of hope, and now despair was written on the face of every thing about her! It came to her in the merry laugh of child- hood, for she remembered a home far away among the easton hills, where she had roamed in happy, gleeful innocence; and she knew her sin had made that home desolate forevermore! It came to her alike in the warm sunlight, and upon the soft star gleams, for they spoke-of peace and happiness to all- all but her! And so she died! and the careless word is spoken over her senseless clay, and the light jest passes round, and all that remains of the beautiful girl "who killed herself for a silly-love affair " is laid away in the dark vault, and forgotten! But what of him -the idol upon whose altar was laid this human sacrifice? Does it not rise up be- tween him and the world - that memory of loving, passion- ate tenderness, which, forsaking every other tie, had wreathed itself around his heart to die in the shadow of his neglect? Does it not whisper in his ear of wrongs too late to be re- dressed - of hopes never to be fulfilled- of dreams never to be realized?

Who that had once listened to the strange, impulsive eloquence of her high heart ever failed to predict for her a life of. storms and darkness? Dark- browed, wild-hearted A(nes Doyle! There was a tinge of Indian blood in her veins, and all the fre of her race burned and flashed from a pair of brilliant eyes with a will and de- termination, the strength of which was never dreamed of   OR THE WORLD FROM M5Y WINDOW.     189 until painful illustration proved its might. Wild in her love, wild in her hate, and wild in every passion of her untamed spirit, her heart was like a frail boat upon the tempestuous waves, beating itself to death upon the quicksands of life! For years there had been a child love growing in her bosom for a youth in the neighborhood, who bad once defended her from the ill-natured attack of a schoolmate; and that love even, like every impulse of her nature, was a strange mix- ture of jealousy, passion, and distrust. The wild old woods had been her play grounds, and the birds and flowers her companions; and now that the clasp had been taken from her heart, leaving her to read its contents, more than ever she resorted to the wild scenes so common upon the banks of the Kennebec. Years passed, and Agnes Doyle was a woman; and her love for Henry May, unknown to him or others, had become a mania--a passionate insanity. Her wild, fierce nature needed the tender sympathy, the gentle reproof, and softened tenderness of her boy lover; so she yielded to her captor, without knowing why the gyves were on her wrists, or how they came to be so securely clasped. There had been a long intimacy between herself and the family of the Wes- terns, wherein Henry May had resided from boyhood- for he had neither father nor mother, from whom to expect affec- tion, and to this circumstance probably might have been traced the awakening of the sympathies of Agnes in his be- half. But they were so-- so unlike in habit --the falcon and the dove might sooner expect to blend sympathies than Henry May and Agnes Doyle! and yet contrasts are often- pleasing. The October storms and winds had driven Agnes from her forest haunts; but now the rain had subsided, and the sun was  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7934-00000098"/> 190    HOME SCENES AND HOMZ3E SOUNDS, out bright and clear;. yet still she lingered at home, and seemed for once to have forgotten the wildness and strength of her proud nature. There had been gay times in the village during the fall months, and evening after evening found her mingling - very quietly, it is true - yet mingling in the sports and pastimes which had been invented for our amusement. It was not the music, or the dance, or the wild, wild mirth, that characterized those evening gatherings, which induced her to join them, but that she could watch unregarded the h pleasant, thoughtful face, whose lightest gesture revealed i to her more poetry, love, religion, than all else in the wide world. This passion had increased with her years. For hours and hours she would sit in a quiet corner of the room, with the splendid fire of her dark eyes veiled by the shadows, watching the form of Henry' Aay with all the adoration of a devotee. In the whole universe she could see but one form, hear the tones of but one voice, or dream of but one love. To her there was more spirituality beaming fromi his deep-blue eyes than all she could comprehend of heaven or holiness, and she sought a union with that spirituality, ardent- ly and impetuously. He was her life, soul, religion--her, : only conception of paradise. Had the whole world censured,  reviled, or discarded her, she would have defied and lauglled  at the insolence; but should those mild blue eyes rest upon her reprovingly, her proud, high heart would have cowered at the feet of their owner, and pleaded for forgiveness. The : village might have been exterminated, her associates mighlt have been dying or dead, and she would have judged it a ( very natural consequence'; but should one pang, physical or j mental, disturb the calmness of that pure, white brow, her i very spirit would have been wrung, until it would have forced i J   O0t THE WORLD FROM MY 3WINDOW.     191 up blood for tears! Silent and uniloticed this intense wor- ship had continued, until, quite unlexpectedly, our parties re- ceived an additional lustre from the presence of Ida Western, who, after some years' albsence had returned to pass a winter in her native village - then her jealousy became as morbid as her love. Ida Western wats one of those quiet, gentle, natural girls that steal into the heart without saying '  with your leave or by your leave,"' and, instead of acquiring "L for- eign airs and native graces" during her city life, she had come home more gentle, more natural, and, if' possible, more affectionate thlan ever. It was a brilliant October eveninmg- that on which the driver of the stage coach plumped her down in the middle of innumerable bandboxes and trunks, at the gate of her fathter. It had been olle of those warm days which autumn seeins to lhave coaxed away from summer, and there was (quite anl artistic group upon the grass plot in front of the, dwelling, to enjoy its decline. Henry May was half asleep over a book, under a large poplar t tee, while Agnes furtively watched him from the shade of the piazza. Mr. and Mrs. Western were busily employed within doors, and Mary, their eldest daughter, was telling stories to a small specimen of humanity, whose brown eyes and curly hair were wonder- fully like his teacher's. "Ida!",exclaimed Mary, springing up with a rush which caused her little pupil to turln an unexpected somerset over the doorstep on to the grass plot. "Ida!" cried Mr. and Mrs. Western in a breath; and out they rushed to smother her with kisses. "Ida!" exclaimed Henry, now thoroughly awake; and opening his arms, he caught her to his bosom, and kissed her face, and neck, and arms, as if his lips had grown there. It was a brothe'rs greeting to the only sister he had ever j  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7934-00000099"/> 192    HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, recognized; but to the distorted eyes of Agnes, it seemed an outpouring of mutual love too intense to be mistaken. "Why, how you have grown, Henry," laughed Ida, as she held him out at arms' length, "and how handsome you are! God bless those dear blue eyes, that never had a single glance but of kindness for me; now don't turn away, and crimson and blush so; don't laugh; it is no laughing matter to me, at least, to come home here,) and find you grown up to be a man. And Mary, too! only think of her being married- how comi-  cal; and of having a baby- how ridiculous!"  Alone and unnoticed, Agnes stood leaning against a tree for support,; but all the fire seemed to have left her lips and cheeks, and to be concentrated in her glowing eyes. "Do come here, and let me have a good look at you," ex- claimed Ida, flying back again to Henry, and dragging him  out into the light. "You are not married?" Henry shook his head. I thought not; you are taking it a little too easy for a married man!" "And you?" inquired Henry. - "And you?" mimicked Ida, with a merry laugh; "well, and me what?" ". You are not married?" "O, you go to Jerusalem!" she exclaimed; "and I en- gaged to you! Bless my heart if there is not Agnes Doyle!" and, springing forward, she was on the point of clasping her in her arms; but Agnes raised her hand, and pushing her al- most fiercely from her, walked hastily up the steps to the door of the dwelling. Henry, both angered and surprised, rose to open it for her; she passed, and, as she passed, her eyes met his, so full of anguish, so full of unutterable misery, that the feeling of resentment was banished, and he laidhis hand gen- tly upon her. arm, and whispered,-  *   Vat 1xfi * Vvasnu W.

"O, dear, what have I done to Agnes?" murmured Ida. "Nothiing, nothing," replied Henry, still gazing in at the  open door, "Do you tell me, iMary; what is the matter?" Nothing, nothing; don't trouble me with questions," said her sister. "It is all very well to say, ' Nothing, nothing,' when you both look as if it was something very serious. I wish I was back at school again - I just do! I'm always doing something to somebody! I'm nominative case to the lost Pleiad, I know I am; for every thing goes wrong with me. Who cares for Agnes Doyle? a little snappish, fierce monkey ; but I can see how it is, if you can't. She's in love with'Henry, and if ever lie marries her she'll break his heart, or her own neck, in less than a month; now mind if she don't!"Ida's soft heart melted into tears at thought of fancied wrongs; so she ran into the house, muttering on the way, "He make love to her! I'd like to catch him at it! Shouldn't wonder if he did though, just to plague me;" and by the time she was out of sight, she had grown very comfortably to dislike the whole party. Agnes, still alone, stood gazing out of the window, "too earnestly for seeing." So intense was her revery, that she failed to hear approaching footsteps, until the soft hands of Ida were clasped lovingly around her own, and the little brown eyes were gaz- ing up so coaxingly into her face, that she could not resist the impulse to gather the restless head to her bosom. "Do make friends with me again; do, please, Agnes!" said 17 i            E  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7934-00000100"/> 194    ROME SCENES AND IIOME SOUNDS, she, pressing the pale lips that were bending over her. "What have I done to you?" 't Nothing, nothing," replied Agnes, lifting the head from its resting-place, to smooth back the drifting curls. "Nothing." "Nothing, again! I asked Mary, and she said nothing, and Henry said nothing; and if I were to ask the man in the moon, he'd say nothing; and yet, for all that, I know well enough there is something. I do love every body so dearly, and yet H am always offending; no, not alwayrs. There is one whom I never offend. Do you know, Agnes, I am go- ing to be married, on Christmas eve, to one whom I love more than all the world. It seems so queer, doesn't it?" Agnes started slightly, and compressed her lips, until they  were pale and bloodless. "Yes, I know it," she replied. "Do you? I thought it was to be a secret, because the  ! neighbors might think I was too young to marry. What a ridiculous idea!" "And he loves you?" said Agnes, speaking very slowly and distinctly.  "Of course he does; to be sure he does. Sensible question that!"  "Go-go- leave me!" exclaimed Agnes, starting up from the recumbent position into which she had fallen. Ida gazed upon 'her fierce face with a bewildered look, merely murmuring, "Mercy on me!"

"Bless us and save us! she must be mad! she certainly must, and the sooner she has a strait jacket the better," muttered Ida, as she crel t noiselessly from the room. Hour after hour the old village clock tolled forth a requiem for the dead hours; yet still, companionless and neglected, Agnes sat, with pale face and flashing eyes, gazing out upon the river, which dancedl and sparkled just under the window; and the moon came up and flickered upon the greensward, and lay like little pools of gold under the vine leaves; but for once its beauty was lost upon the wild heart beating so fiercely within her bosom, for that heart had gone down with memory, and was now conning over the mournful reli-cs of the past. The history of Agnes Doyle was almost a romance in itself. Her existence had been a tissue of circumstances beyond her control. She was the offspring of crime, and the hour that gave her birth orphaned and closed up the portals between a human being and society. That fact she knew, and she stood alone in the world- something distinct from the race of men - a creature to be feared, scorned, and tam- pered with by those above her, and insulted, taunted, and disgraced by those whose knowledge of life should havej taught them better. J There was a leaf in her heart upon which was written a yearning for affection, a pleading for sympathy, from which her dark life had shut her out, - but which, once having an object for those yearnings and sympa- thies, would clasp it as the dearest thing on earth, and turn to it exclusively and forever. Through the instrumentality of the villagers, she had been reared and educated as liberally as any one of their own children; but she scorned and defied the moral education which would have saved her heart from ,  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7934-00000101"/> 196    HOME SCENES AND HO3iE SOUNDS, the pangs it was now suffering. Left at last to the guidance of her own passions, with no teacher but the dangerous one of her own impetuous-will, how could she find strength of purpose to crush that love which had sprung up in her bosom like a flower in the desert- all the more beautiful for the desolation by which it was surrounded? None knew of its existence, and least of all the object which had grown into her heart, ingrafting therein the germ of a purer and a better i soul; for, with all her extravagances of tamper, his memory was the oil that could subdue the fiercest tempests of her  nature. It was, the wasted affection of early years, which, diverted from its proper source, had turned to the wildness and intensity of creature love. She could sacrifice her own life, 'her own heart's blood, if needful, to secure the happiness ! of any human being, (for this unselfishness of purpose was her redeeming quality,) but not her love; O, no! not her love; that was so deeply implanted in her soul, that if it died out, her heart must die with it. And now she was beginning  to feel that the fold had been taken from her heart, and the long-hoarded secret laid bare to eyes that could not under- stand its might, or sympathize with her weakness. . Cold, cold as marble, Agnes sat gazing out upon the river, now dark and swollen as her own wild thoughts. There were no tears in her eyes, no passion in her heart; all was cold within her bosom, as if grief had frozen her blood in its  contact. Dark clouds liad drifted up, and obscured the moon, and occasionally the breeze, sweeping through the garden, i would startle the dry leaves, and send them rattling along the walk with a mournful murmur!

There had been a long consultation between Henry and Mary, the nature of which even Ida, with her coaxing blue eyes, could not ascertain. This being ended, Mary left the room to seek the wayward girl, whose absence at such an hour was so unusual. She found her still sitting by the win- dow, in her first posture, with the black curls, which had burst from their confinement, drifting half way to her feet. Mary crept softly up to her, took the hand which was hang- ing listlessly at her side, and started to see how dry and hot it was. "O, Agnes!" she pleaded, "you are suffering, you are wretched ; do - do confide in me - do tell me what it is dis- tresses you." A dry, gasping sob was her only reply, and she continued,- "Have I ever failed in kindness to you, Agnes? do- do speak to me!" "Yes, I will speak to you, Mary - my sister," replied Ag- nes, clasping the hands which held her own. "I will tell you all; for there are times when the heart will claim sympathy in spite of self-control! In all the long years of my life, I thought I had never loved human being - not even you, Mary! I was grateful for kindnesses, grateful for sympathies - but I could not love, as I saw others about me; I could not recip- rocate even the gentle guardianship and watchfulness you extended to the wild, fierce, unlovable orphan thrust upon your care! But the time came when a stronger impulse mastered my spirit. I could not comprehend its nature orits strength. I tried to analyze the sentiment, and came to the conclusion that it might be poetry, it might be fantasy, or 17*  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7934-00000102"/> 1W     HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, religion, but not love; and so I resolutely brought myself to think of it as a sacred thing, until the one impulse had formed for-me an idol, which it was crime to reverence, and double misery to worship as I did,-ay, and do! though so to worship is but one step from positive shame!I "Agnes!" murmured Mary.

While you were out of the room,- I crept to his side, and pressing my lips to his pale forehead, prayed -O, how earnestly!- that he might live to feel how deeply he was beloved. A quick spasm dis-  j torted his features, and the blue eyes opened upon me with such a look of pity and compassion that I knew there was no hope. There was feeling, honest and honorable feeling:, in that look! He saw that I loved him, madly, desperately,--  and he knew, too, that it could meet with no return. It was ! not in his nature to add another blow to the crushed and bruised heart. But what matter how the drug was mixed-    i the poison had done its work." For a moment Agnes faltered, as if trying to recall some incident. The color had all faded away from her face, but- it was very calm and quiet in its expression. "( I can scarcely f remember," she resumed, " but I think I ldft his presence be- 'ore your return.

"Love him!

I can bear misery, lone- liness, desolation, but not shame -not degradation - O, no, not his contempt!" Agnes had risen from her seat, and was passing from the room, but Mary's hand was on her arm to detain her. "Who told you Henry was to be married?" questioned Mary. "Ida!" she replied.

Gathering the fainting form in his arms, he bore her. to the window, where, throwing up the sash, the fresh air came sweeping in, lifting in its progress the dark curls which clustered around the face of Agnes. The soothing influence soon revived her sinking spirit, and brought it back to consciousness. Slowly the folded lids began to quiver, and the eyes, which seemed forever closed to earth, began to brighten and glow in their casings. No words were spoken now--not one. Again his arm was around her waist, and his kisses on her lips; but there were more tenderness and less passionate wildness in this last caress than characterized his first ebullition of rapturous delight. With returning conscious- ness she knew whose arms were about her, upon whose bosom she leaned; and with a shudder of perfect happiness, she gathered her own arms more closely around the form which evermore would shelter her; and the past, with its wretched- ness, was forgotten -forgiven.

Poor Agnes! If she could have seen her effigy done to death in lard, how she would have laughed! Just as the clock was striking eleven, a pretty team came dashing up to the door, from which Henry May alighted, and gracefully handed out the peerless Agnes Doyle. She was followed by a tall, ath- letic young man, who, with the greatest ease, gathered up an extensive bundle of something, which, after minute investiga- tion, proved to be Ida. The heart of Mr. Western sank within him. It was the one trial of his life, the only sorrow he had ever known - that of trusting his pet child, Ida, to the lifelong care of a stranger. "God bless you, my darling," he exclaimed, laying his trembling hand on the little head nestled down on his bosom. His voice sounded so husky and unnatural, that Ida raised her eyes, full of eloquent wonder, to his face. He tried to smile, but it was a) dead failure; so, tossing Ida into the arms of the handsome stranger, he hastened abruptly from the room in search of his spectacles, which, strange to say, were comfort- ably perched over his nose all the- while. And Agnes--how calm and happy she looked beside her betrothed - happy in the deep, impassioned faith of her trust- ing spirit -happy in the realized dream of her devoted heart -and happy in the full, confidence and trust which had usurped the reign of the demon jealousy in her bosom!

The strong, young heart of genius plodding the world alone, unrecognized, un- cared for, passed by upon the other side! To see sights of gor- geous beauty through other eyes - to listen to sweet tones of melody through other ears - to look upon friendship as a ro- mance, upon trqth as a fable - to coin wild thoughts into pas- sionate words - to feel the bitter moan of anguish struggling to the lip, yet hush it back to silence - to learn that to trust is to be deceived-- find that most false which it most believed -to hope, to fear, to struggle, and to die! So has read the sorrowful litany of genius since the world began - homeless and loveless! A heart history in these words! The resting-place of Genius is not upon earth, else would its spirit be oftener recognized. There is a mission to be performed, there are brave words to be spoken, there are noble sacrifices to be made, and then comes the winding sheet, the coffin, and the grave! Genius has gone home! And then, too, comes, the recognition of great- ness lost to the world. Dirges are chanted, eulogies are read, biographies are written, and perhaps over the neglected ashes a noble monument is reared, a mockery to the broken heart which moulders beneath!

A LEGEND OF THE KENNEBEC. THERE is a bright and lovely spot, far in the wilds of Maine, That boasts a legend of the past - of sorrow and of pain; Before oppression's cruel hand had driven the red man. forth, An alien from the hunting grounds that gave his fathers birth. I love to dwell upon the theme, unlinking memory's chain, Recalling pleasures of the past, that ne'er can come again. The murmuring stream, the simple cot, with honeysuckle twined, Are early reminiscences dear to the wanderer's mind. For 'twas my home, my dear old home, that cottage in the vale; It seemed an earthly paradise, that peaceful sunny dale. I love each old familiar haunt, each crag and valley wild; Would I could bring them back again, and be again a child. There is a tale about this spot, of sad, unhappy love, Of sorrows borne and ended now, when through the tangled grove The Indian wild, with agile form, and light and feathery spear, With fearless step and untaught grace pursued the panting deer. And there was one - an Indian maid - a graceful, airy sprite, Whose glossy tresses seemed to shame the ebon brow of night; And eyes, that from their brilliant depths a mine of love could bring, Were sparkling like the morning dew upon the raven's wing; The silver brook that rippled by was not more pure or wild Than was the heart that beat within the bosom of this child; The livelong day around the hills her plaintive notes would ring, Or, planting on her mother's grave the earliest buds of spring, She'd prattle to the senseless mound, in moonlit evening hours, And was herself the sweetest bud among those favorite flowers. She seemed with them -  her breathless friends- with heart so free from strife, A sweet mimosa, springing forth with animated life. Yet not alone the forest flowers, that decked the maiden's hair, And not alone the gentle birds, Magantha's love might share; For, circled with her holiest thoughts, and of herself a part, A  brother's form was shrined amid the wild flowers of her heart.   OR THE IWORLD FRONM MY    WINDOW.      2" Brother, I said - and yet, in truth, the ardent blood that dyed The forest maiden's cheek might find on earth no kindred tide. Adopted by her father's love, a youthful chief had grown Beside her, from her childhood's days, and him she loved alone. Yet, ah! while with her gentle lips she spoke a brother's name, She loved him, though she knew it not, with woman's heart of flame. Years had flown round; her ancient sire was slumbering in the dust, And still upon Magantha's brow beamed youthful hope and trust. She cherished still the lovely flowers that in the valley grew, And loved them better, for they smiled upon her brother too. When rising with the morning sun, to join the fearless chase, Her hand prepared his simple food with unaffected grace; Then stealing to the rocky cliff, she'd view'the hunting train, Then waited patiently for night to bring him back again. Thus strengthened with her early years a pure; devoted love, And neighboring tribes had cherished them, the Eagle and the Dove. But in her calm and peaceful sky anon there came a cloud, Which burst in all its anger, and her noble spirit bowed. And fearful was the hurricane which scattered ruin wild, And blasted, in its furious rage, this gentle forest child. A pale-faced stranger, with her sire, had settled near the wood, Where they hoped to pass their future life in peace and quietude: Oft, when, returning from the field, this chieftain lingered there, With friendly, winning grace he'd try to cheer the lovely pair, Till his eyes had lost their brilliant light, and, need we tell the tale? His heart was in the keeping of the Lily of the Vale! Magantha long had watched with pain the clouds obscure his day, And strove with many witching wiles to chase the gloom away! She saw the flashing of his eye when came the maiden pale, To dip the crystal from the brook that murmured through the vale. Then came a thrill of agony- alas! 'tis woman's lot - The fiend of jealousy was there, and yet she knew it not! And when the truth dawn'd on her heart, 'twas like some dreadful dream, ' That lingers on the waking mind, so 'wildering did it seem. Her faith in him - her trusting heart - the fairy wreaths she'd wove - Too late for peace, she found that hers was not a sister's love. Alone, o'er crags and mountains wild, with weary heart she strayed, Or, kneeling by her mother's grave, thus in her anguish prayed:  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7934-00000109"/> 212     -HOMiE SCENES AND HO01E SOUNDS, "O thou, whose mighty voice is heard when thunders cleave the sky I Thou Spirit King, from whose bright glance the vivid lightnings fly! With pitying hand, O, gently deign to check this stream of woe! Or pluck from out my erring hieart the love that pains it so! Dear mother, in the land of dreams methinks I see thee now, With sparkling coronet of gems upon thy shining brow! The great Maneto hushed thy voice -then came a joyous band, And bore thee in their magic car, to dwell in fairyland'! O mother! in that happy clime are there no passions wild, Like these which burst with frantic rage upon thy helpless child? Are there no whirlwinds of the heart? no strong, resistless power, That, like the scorching midday sun, withers the tender flower? Alas! they've borne her from my sight, she cannot hear my moan; Her home is now among the blest, and I am all alone!" Like an old friend, the evening star'lit up, with cheering ray, The grass-grown mound, where in her grief she'd knelt the livelong day; A cooling breeze played on her brow, and with her glossy hair, As if in loving sympathy 'twould try to soothe her care. She felt its gentle influence, and rising from the spot, She wandered aimlessly along, oppressed with gloomy thought, Till verging on a favorite dell - a lovely natural bower, Where in her days of happiness she'd passed full many an hour; She paused - but why that flashing eye, that quick convulsive start? And wherefore clasp that fatal knife so closely to her heart? And creeping stealthily along, her head bent near the ground, Suppressed her breath, as if she feared to lose the slightest sound. Within the shady nook she saw a noble, manly form; The pale-faced maiden's slender waist was circled with his arm; Upon his breast reposed her head, as, seated by her side, He sought arid won her from her home to be the red man's bride. And as their gentle words of love came murmuring on her ear, She pressed her heart, as if to crush some gnawing demon there. 'Twas vain! She crept within the bower, and with a sudden start, Ere he could speak, her gleaming knife was buried in his heart! "He's mine! Ye dare not love him now-- his blood the price has paid!" And from his breast, with savage joy, she drew the reeking blade. "Thou daughter of a stranger band! e'en now thy milky face Is blanched with fear! And thou would'st match the warriors of our race?   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.            213 What in the nature of thy tribe can ever be akin To passions wild which have their home beneath our swarthy skin?

Thou cam'st with poison on thy lips, although thou seermd'st so meek. Thou little deemd'st Magantha's eye was on thee all the while; And now, instead of bridal flowers, thou'lt see a funeral pile! Nay, do not fear; I would not touch or harm thee if I could - The Indian maiden's knife would scorn to drink the Lily's blood! No, no! I would not have thee die, for with thy magic charms Thou'dst find him in the land of dreams, and wile him from my arms!" Then kneeling by Wanandah's side, she pressed a burning kiss Upon his clay-cold lips, and deemed 'twas pledge of future bliss! "I come to meet thee now," she cried, "' upon that peaceful shore Where lurking thorns, that wound us here, are felt and feared no more! No more shall anguish wring my heart--my eyes be drowned with tears f A land where roses ever bloom now to my sight appears! I see thy spirit in the air -it seems to chide my stay! I hear thee whispering on the breeze, Dear sister, come away! I've heard the music of thy voice; I've seen thy sparkling eye; I come! I come! Wanandah dear! think'st thou I fear to die?" Then burying in her breast the knife still reeking with his gore, Her drooping head sank on his breast - Magantha was no more! - Years have flown past, and on that spot a single grassy mound Is left to tell the wanderer where they slumber in the ground. And when a child, full many a night I've listened to the tale, And wept to think how sad the fate of the Lily of the Vale. 'Twas said she lingered till the sun of summer dried the stream, Then passed away with autumn leaves; but not a parting gleam Of reason ever lit her brow, since from the fatal hour She saw her lover cold in death, within the woodland bower.

And who was Norah Shehaine? and what were her trials more than those of others in her grade of life? methinks-I hear asked. As if every body didn't know Norah, the Irish beggar, as some vouchsafed to name her; pretty Norah, as her countrymen called her, with a tinge of that beautiful brotherhood of feeling every where visible among the rude but warm-hearted children of Erin!

I have so often told of a little village on the banks of the Kennebec--little then, when associations were so strongly linked with its peculiarities- that, now it has grown influential and grand, I almost fear to write of it as the village with which so many reminiscences are braided up. But I'm forgetting Norah! There was an eloquent sermon to be delivered in the little yellow meeting house on the hill - we knew it was to be eloquent, for the name and fame of the preacher had preceded him -so the building was thronrged to excess long before the solitary bell rang out its peal of invitation. ,The centre aisle leading to the pulpit was alone free of access- tlhat remaining so out of respect to the holy man who was for the first time to leave the impress of his mind daguerreotyped on the memory of his hearers. There was a bustle at the door, a quivering of hearts among the congregation, and with that intuitive sense which genius always commands, we felt sure, even before we ventured a glance, that we were in the presence of an intellectual man. As he gained the desk, all 'eyes were raised to his as by one common impulse. It might have been of curiosity,-- it might 'have been something more sacred, -but there was a flash in his returning glance which blazed so startlingly upon us, and then died out again like a gleam of lightning, that more than one heart quailed, At and questioned whether the eloquence of the orator had not its source in the flashings of intellectuality, over which the brain had lost control!  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7934-00000111"/> Z51D    HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, There was nothing else strange or unusual in his appear. ance; all was calm and -in holy keeping with the time and place--all but that one glance, which told of an unsettled mind and an intellect tottering upon the verge of madness! Not of past madness, or present, but in the time to come; and in after years, when the wreck of that mind was commented upon, many a wise nod and sage remark gave evidence of an intuitive knowledge, tending to that effect, having taken root in the heart of those who trembled beneath the mesmeric fire of his eyes on the Sabbath of which I write. I was, but a child at that pelriod, and remember these inci- dents partly as child's fancies, and partly as realities which only the experience of years has enabled me to comprehend. Then I could only wonder at the singular eloquence of a heart actuated by quick and violent impulses - an eloquence which startled as much by its wild harmony as by its purity and depth! When the interest in his discourse became most in- tense, there was a long pause, a vacant stare' down the broad aisle, and a half-formed smile on the preacher's lips, which carried the attention of the congregation in the direction of his eyes. They were fixed upon the heavy matting at the door, where, nestled down in the sunlight, with her naked little feet crossed over each other, and her dimpled chin resting in the palm of her two .hands, reclined a stranger child, whose fea- tures, though singularly beautiful, gave evidence of Irish descent. So noiselessly had she entered, that even the sexton, whose duty it was to provide seats for strangers, was taken by surprise, and stood looking at her for a moment with a queer expression of anger and perplexity on his face. But the child, instead of being terrified, returned, his look very com- posedly; without moving from the graceful position into which i I 7:,'-'    OR THE WORLD FROrM MYr WINDOW.      217 she had fallen, until the stern man bent over her and whis- pered some word into her ear which was unintelligible to the rest of the crowd. Then the warm flush went and came in her sweet face, arid she drew her hand across her eyes, and murmured - ".Please let me stay. I'll be very quiet!" "Do you know where you are?" said the minister, who had noiselessly reached her side. For the first time, thile little tangled bead was raised with an expression of distrust and misgiving, and looking from face to face for sympathy, she again repeated,- I'll be very quiet!" The minister raised her in his arms, for she was very small, and carrying her up the aisle, placed her upon a low stool at the foot of the pulpit, and the next moment was earnestly pur- suing his discourse, as if nothing had occurred to disturb his equanimity. Again the whole heart of tSlat great gathering was concentrated upon the words of the preacher; even res- piration seemed for a time suspended, and yet the little stran- ger kept her place, quiet, composed, and more absorbed than ever! And what a serious little face it was! not old in its expression, or sad, or unpleasant, but so thoughtful and ra- diant, so changeful in its every shadowing of impulse, that the richest child there looked plain in her presence. The sunlight came in through the open door, and lay like a halo around the passive little figure, and one could almost hear the thoughts that were busy in her young heart, as ye listened to words of holy meaning which had seldom before greeted her ears. At length the sermon was ended, and the congregation; began to divide their attention between the minister and the barefooted stranger, who had made her appecarance so myste- 19 i  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7934-00000112"/> 218    HOME SCE:NES ANDt) IO E, SOUXNDS, riously. The frock she wore was faded and patched, but scrupulously neat; and the bright hair gave evidence of hav- ing been nicely combed and curled; but, being the most obsti- nate hair in the world, it had departed from its propriety, and was brushed back from her forehead in a mass of tangles. Yet there was such a wondrous beauty in her blue eyes, and such a lifelike brilliancy in the clear complexion, and such an artistic curve around the dimpled lips and ,over the small chin that the outward appointments of dress were forgotten in the examination of a face -of such rare developments of beauty. One after another the crowd gazed upon her, de- parted, and forgot her, until only the minister and a few inti- mate friends remained to wonder at and question the strange intruder. For a moment the full blue eyes were wild and prominent, as if trying to recall some almost forgotten missioll. The memory came at last, and with it a shadow deepened upon the serious face, and she clasped the hand of the minister to attract his attention, nothing daunted by the frowning looks of the sexton, who had -lingered in the discharge of his vari- ous duties. "Mamma sent me," said she, imploringly. "Do come, please. He is so thin and white, and mamma says you can make him well again!" "Go home," said the sexton, sharply, addressing the little girl, giving her a threatening look at the same time, which caused her to shrink closer to the side of the minister, and raise her hand as if to avert some impending punishment. "These Paddies," he continued, "are really becoming intoler- ably impudent! Go horne, I say, or ril .

Still holding her thin hand in his, the good man led his protegee firom the church, and then suffered her to direct him to the poor hovel which she, in the innocence of her heart, thought as b-ight and as beautiful as any other home in the village. There was no lack of kind words, though there was- of smiles for the childhood of' Norah Shellaine, for who could have spoken harshy to her, the meek, pure-hearted, yet self-reliant child? Who could hatve suffered her to want for kind words and gentle attentions, when her own young life was wasting in the at- tempt to cheer and lighlten 'the sorrow of her mother, and help to fill up the time of her invalid father! It was of him she spoke, when pleading in her own childish way for the minister to accompany her hoe! It was in his cause that her childhood liad gYrown old and thoughtful; and for his sake that her intellect had been forced into actual life at an agre when most children would have chosen toys rather than a sick parent for Companionship. The sunshine upon the hills was not freer than her own guileless he art, yet there was a vague yearning for teachings beyond the speech of' home, and a knowledge wlhich should enlable her the better to minister to those so dear to her, not to be attained within the precincts of her humble dwelling. These were vague yearnings, un- formed and conflicting within themselves, and easily dis- mlissed, for sle seemed to be aware thlat nature has its own classifications, and that her mind in its formation was singu- Iarly at variance with established rules. It was a rude lg dwelling, (there are none like it nowz in Gardiner,) into. which the minister was conducted by his child guide, and the sun- light which streamed in through th e crevices in the lo's, and the flowers that sent their frIagtrance in through the-open win-  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7934-00000113"/> 220         HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, dow, and even the atmosphere of bird song by which it was surrounded, failed to divest it of the sombre hue with which poverty ever marks its inheritance. But there was a smile on the mother's li-ps, and silent blessing in her eyes as they were lifted to the calm, serene face of the minister, which were welcomed into his heart a thousand times more warmly than words would have been. They were soon by the bed of the sick man, who occupied an inner room, in which the scant furniture was still more rude and meagre than that which barely relieved the emptiness of the first apartment. With an outpouring of gratitude peculiarly Irish, the invalid began reverently to greet the good man; but, like the sexton, his words also became arrested in their utterance, by the wild,' deep eyes resting upon his face. What strange, mag- nletic eyes they were, and how powerful in their influence! and yet, wahen blazing most fiercely, Nofah could look into them with her calm, pure glance, till the light was all gone, or had given place to a meekness of expression equal to her own. It was the indivisible link between purity and goodness - a boundary line which even madness dared not cross! After much religious counsel, prayers were offered up, and the min- ister departed, first promising that his visits should be fre- quent, and pledging his own heart to look no less after the future welfare of Norah than the comfort and well being of her destitute parents. Norah followed him with her eyes until he came to the turning by the apple orchard, and was lost to view among the trees, and then she dropped down upon the doorstep and gave vent to the first bitter tears her childhood had ever known! And yet she could not have told why she wept, or why her tears were bitter- she only knew that a shadow had fallen upon her heart; but how or in what   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.       221 way it was associated with him who had just left her, she was yet too young to comprehend! I believe in a chain of fa- tality, linking the cradle with the grave - a tissue of circum- stances, which we may struggle against, but cannot control! I mean the leading circumstances of life! Of course there is a combination of trifling points, immaterial in themselves, yet verging to some special event which might be overruled, or submerged in some other project; yet, in defiance of such policy, the prominent feature would work out its own destiny, and the destiny of a human life in its progress! Good strong minds have tried often and often enough to reason me out of such a belief; but though I may not have the intellectual power to combat with their arguments, yet when they are away from me I cannot remember what they have said, and ever find myself reasoning of, relying in, and pinning my faith upon the pleasant and harmless belief of uncontrollable fatality! Pleasanct, because it leads one to hope on for a bright destiny, and harmless, because it teaches us to rely on the wisdom of a higher power, rather than upon the weak arm of mortal self. It is a world of mixed impulses in which we live - never giving us entire happiness- yet never placing us where there is not something to be grateful for. So Norah Shehaine, in her dark home, gathered into her heart affec- tions and sympathies which it would take a whole lifetime to forget. Months passed, and the shadow deepened upon the hearthstone and in the hearts of the inmates of the hovel. It had been a dismal day, and now that the night had come, the hail and sleet beat still more fiercely against the window panes, and the wind howled around the corners of the dwelling, and swept in fitful gusts against the door, until Martha Dale, the sister of charity, whose home was by the side of suffering, 19           .  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7934-00000114"/> 222'    HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, was forced to fasten it more securely, that its clamor might not reach the ears of the dying man within. For weeks and weeks the patient wife had watched by the side of her hus- band, unwilling that any hand but hers should minister to his comfort; and now that there was a short respite in his pain, and he: seemed disposed to slumber, she had laid her head down by his side, and clasping the attenuated hand in her own, sought a temporary relief from her weariness. WTake me, Martha," said she, "if there is the slightest change. I should never forgive myself if I were to rest while he was .suffering!" "Look upon me-once more, Kathleen, darling," murmured the sick man; " kiss me before you go to sleep, and tell me you forgive me, if ever I have been unkind or cross to you. Don't cry, darling -I am better now - but if I should die, remember it is only the body that is to be put in- the ground, Kathleen, and that the life of me, darling, will be with-you as ever it was - the life of me, with its love, and its faith, and its truth: so when the little old hovel down here in the clear- ing looks still more gloomy, and when the worn face is gone from it, and the heart that loves you is still in the ground, think how much better it was to die and go home than to live here in suffering and sorrow, and wait hopefully for the time to come when you, and I, and Norah will all be united again." The tears which were struggling  for freedom under the eyelids of Mrs. Shehaine were choked back, that her husband might not see the anguish which she could not control. The words of the dying man had reached the quick ear of Norah, and she buried her face in the bosom of her friend, and wept as if her heart had- broken in its struggle, and was gushing up with her tears.   OR Trle WORLD FRO M MY WiNDObr.     223 "- He is -dying - O, he is dyilg!" she sobbed; " what shall we do?" "Whom the Lord lovetlh le chastenetlh," whispered the kind woumanl, and for a long time after, her tones alone disturbed the silence of the hovel. It had been silent some minutes, for Ca startled moan, mingled with her name, issued from the sick room, and she knew the work of death was done. After a dis- turbed slumber, the wife awoke, and shuddered at the icy cold- ness of the hand which was laid -as in a blessing on her brow. Starting up, she clasped the hand and gazed -vildly into the pale face before her. It was still and cold, and looked as it ever looked when asleep; but the heart was quiet, and the pulse had ceased to beat. The living and the dead had been slumbering together. ,Martha knew that words would be useless then to console the stricken woman; so she turned to communicate to Noralh her bereavement .There was no need of it; she had surmised the fact, and had crept to the door with a scared look, as if not quite comprehending why her father was so rigid and pale on the bed! The good minister was summoned, and the preliminaries for the- funeral duly arranged. There were no flowers on the earth, no leaves on the trees, that shot up over the pauper's grave; but the wind moaned through the branches a sad requiem for one who had lived, and loved, and died beneath their shadows. How white the little face of Norah grew as site gazedl into the grave! but it did not continue so long, for her heart was finding its strength; and by the time the funeral train (for there were others besides the poor Irish whlo followed tlhe coffin to its resting-place) had reached her home again, she had learned to look calmly and with a quiet resignation upon this first trial of her life.  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7934-00000115"/> '224    HOME SCENES AND HOIRME SOUNDS$ C I APTER  II Master alike of earnest thought, Of passions dark and evil, I think and wonder if thou wert An angel or a devil I DON'T know where I found that quotation. I don't know that it is a quotation. I only know that it came into my heart with the memory of Horace Vane, and was so like in sentiment to what he was in reality, that I could not for the life of me help appropliating it as an index to his singular character. Dark-and wild in his impulses as a thunder cloud, yet beauti- ful in his affections as the sunlight which follows it, he was perpetually startling and winning those about him, and it was only when- the strange light came into his eyes (which none could define or withstand) that there were perceptible traits  in his impulses at all at variance with the lholy calling of the ministry. At such times, he was shy and unsocial, but, if drawn into argument, bitter and violent -reckless alike of friend or foe, and usually ended it by some decided outhreak of passionate violence. It was only then that the sweet influ- ence of Norah Shehaine was broughlt to bear upon the in- firmity of his temper. Her voice was the oil upon the troubled waters of his restless spirit - her eyes the agent to work outi a reaction in his tempestuous nature. What wonder, then, that, child as she was, an indefinable feeling of protection should take strong root in her heart?-a sentiment of some- thing holy and beautiful, yet with -no positive idea wherein that- something consisted. He had attached himself to her from the time of her father's death - had made the village his home for the ostensible purpose of quiet and repose from   o0i THE W'ORLD rlto lMY WINDOW.     225 severe mental labor, but in reality to be near her. He had endeavored to persuade her mother to leave the log hovel, but thlere was a grLve down by the edge of the clearing, and she would not be seoparatedl fromn its sight; so the old dwelling was mnade comlbortab!e, and the widow and her child better cared Bor than they had been during the life of their natural pro- tector. At school, lqGorah w1s the wod;ri of every one, even of' the few --slame upon thlwei!- wlo considered it a con- descension to associate with. a coi'ld of :11er claste. Conde- scension, indeed!

Then the quivering eyelids and the com- pressed lips were the only indications of the pain such un- merited treatment inflicted. It had gone on thus for somne years, until the gentle child had grown almost into womanhood, yet always progressing from science to science withl astonishing rapidity, ald always seeming the same lone, quiet iittle being that had first- attracted attention in the meeting house. If Norah was accustomed to  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7934-00000116"/> 226    HOtME SCENES AND HOME SOUNIDS, feel the indifference of the many, she had learned to lose a sense of such feeling in the interest evinced for her by her pastor lover, Horace Vane.  It is true, he-, was many years her senior; yet,; without being at all aware of it, she loved him with a strength and devotion to which words could do no justice, and if she labored incessantly and well, it was that he gloried in her advancement. If she ever coveted power, supremacy, or fame, it was that such acquirements might lift her nearer the throne of her idol. And he - what were his emotions, as he watched day by day the unfolding of some fresh leaf of that sweet bud of purity? It seemed so correct, so necessary, so natural that he should "wear her in his heart," that she should grow to nestle there, as a bird in its rightful nest, that without ever speaking to her of love, or confiding his own impulses to her keeping, there seemed a tacit acknowledgment, a spiritual unity of feeling which neither would care to disturb. Time wore on, and Norah's days of schooling were drawing to a close; and as the days grew fewer in which the selfish teacher could exercise his harshness upon the studious girl, there was an evident mark of increasing tyranny, until one day an open rupture between master and scholar startled the crowd by its novelty. He had lectured her severely for some trifling inadvertency in her studies, and starting from -her seat, the usually gentle Norahl gathered up her books, took her sun bon- net, and turned to the door. "Stop!" thundered the master, bringing down his ruler on the desk with a tremendous crash. Norah turned and confronted him, "Where are tyon going? and how dare you venture with- out permission?"'   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.      227 Our master, be it known, had no such weakness as compas- sion in his nature. There was no system of government ac- knowledged by him, except it was founded upon severe bodily discipline. Out upon such a mistaken judgment. It should have no place on the same page with Norah Shehaine, and yet it formed a mournful era in her life history. The teacher repeated his question with little success. "Why don't you answer me?" exclaimed he, in tones of anger. "Because," replied Norah, " because I don't recognize your right to ask me such a question; and because it is time I taught you something--that I am no longer a child, to be frowned at and scolded whenever the humor moves you, but a woman -and one daring enough and independent enough to say what she pleases, and do what she pleases, and take --the -re- sponsibility of her own acts;, and because I wish you perfect- ly to understand, that hereafter, if my scholarship has ceased to be agreeable, I can find a school and a teacher elsewhere." And turning from the door, she was soon on her way to her home. Before reaching it, however, she encountered Horace Vane, who looked for a moment anxiously in her face. "What has troubled you, Norah?" said he, kindly. "Nothing," she replied, quietly. 4 It is in your face, Norah, and if it were a thousand times deeper in your heart, I should have found it out. It is easy enough to see when there is trouble in the heart we love." Norah burst into tears, but told him firmly and truly what had occurred, together with various indignities that had before been bestowed upon her. -The pastor's face had been very pale during her recital of wrongs which he had never dreamed existed; but now it was deeply flushed; his eyes, those eyes  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7934-00000117"/> 223    HOUE SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS. so deadly in their power, were blazing, scintillating with "The incarnate fiend!" he muttered between his clinched teeth, but too low for lorah to catch the words or their meaning. You 'must return, Norah," said he, gazing down into her eyes. '"For Heaven's sake," began Norah, pleadingly; but the light of his wild eyes was on her, and she bowed her head submissive to his will. As she turned from ihim, he stretched out his arms, caught her in their embrace, and strained her, struggling, to his bosom. It was a strange sight in broad day in the severe village of Gardiner, but madness of the heart had overpowered that of the brain; and he forgot every thing but the wrongs and suf- ferings that Norah had endured, and was willing still to en- dure for his sake. I cannot bear to dwell upon the scene that followed. There are pictures gliding to and fro in memory's chamber, sornme dark and some bright, libe the hues of a kaleidoscope; and among them is one of the school house down by the river - of Nlorah leaving it in defiance; of her return in humiliation; of harsh, cruel words; of an unmerited blow ; anld now the picture has changed to one of tumult, and among the shadows gleams out a wild and maniac face, with terrible eyes, tiger- like in their ferocity. Then come visions of violence, and-- almost murder; the teacher prostrate; the maniac guarded; Norah standing so dream-like and cold by her defender's side, and all the rest is a confusion of shadows and fancies hopeless- ly blended together. Horace Vane had followed her to the school house, had seen the blow inflicted, and dashing in at   OR THE WORLD FROM   MY WINDOW.    229 the window, had left the teacher apparently lifeless upon the floor. Norah Shehaine awoke from her trance to learn that all out- ward communication between her and her maniac lover was forbidden by those who had him in charge, and went home to bury her heart beneath the fragments of that hope which had been crumbled by the intensity of this second bitter trial of her life. CHAPTER III. O, had I loved thee less, or though, perchance, With our deep love, that we in time might sever, Then - then I think my spirit might forget, Nor think, as now, that it must mourn thee ever! But fare thee well! I would not have it so! Thy memory is my all-- my bliss below! THERE must be a long gap of years itl the history of Norah Shehaine. She was never seen in the village after the incar- ceration of her lover; but there was sometimes a pale, quiet face flitting around in the grove by the river, after nighlltfall, and in a few months more, the log dwellinog was without a tenant. Rumor said Mrs. Shehaine had remembered a rela- tive in Boston, who, coming to this country, had married a rich merchant; but for many years no positive information reached the villagers, and at length the topic was worn out, dropped, and Norah, with her mother, quite forgotten. A few months served to restore the intellect of Horace Vane; but after a single visit to Norah's cottage, he, too, seemed-to share the general apathy regarding her. There had been music in the spirit of Norah, --we all knew that; for many a time, when any bit of poetry hit her 20  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7934-00000118"/> 230    HO:ME SCENES AND HOM3E SOUNDS, fancy, up from her heart would fly a melody of her own com- posing; but we did not know she had caught the idea that in after years it mighlt be made available as a method of sup- porting herself and her mother, or we might have guessed, when the news came of the debut of an accomplished vocalist in Boston, that it was none other than the self-reliant Norah. And she it was! From the first- listening to her voice, an artist of high standing had volunteered to educate her, and in entire confidence of her success, refused remuneration till the trial should be tested. A happy woman was Norall, in antici- pation of her brilliant future; each day brought with it in- creasing confidence and an earnest hopefulness for future distinction. There had been one shadow on that portion of her life. The- teacher to whose kindness she owed so much had come by degrees to love her; he had pleaded with her, too, in tones of passionate entreaty, such as make a woman's heart ache, even when she cannot reciprocate. But the most human and beautiful feeling in her breast was its affection for Horace Vane; the maniac lover, as he was still to her. Her teacher listened to her confession, and redoubled his efforts for her advancement, from  gratitude fori her noble dealing with his heart. The night of the third 'great trial came at last; and long enough before the hour stated, the hall selected for her debut was crowded by a critical and curious audience. At length a faint murmur swept around the hall, for upon the stage, calm and dignified, stood a Vrision of rare loveliness, -a vision of Norah Shehaine,-the quiet, serious Norah, so calm, so gentle, so beautifil, yet with the old absorption of external objects about her. A wild and beautiful prelude lingered for a moment on the air, then lost itself in echoes; yet there she   I,        OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.       231 stood, unconscious of observation, as if she was in her quiet room at home. Again the pianist touched the keys, lightly and musically, as if to recall iher wandering senses; but before the strain was concluded,- there burst forth from her lips a strain of wild and irregular melody - vague and' unfinished, without aim or object, - yet melody it was, bursting out clear and exquisitely sweet, as if from the impulse of some pleasant thought. Her teacher paused, looked anxiouslya round upon the faces of .the crowd, and at last broke off the accompani- ment -if such the attempt to follow her strange melody could be called. Time was allowed her to recover, and another attempt was made by her teacher to attract her attention. At length, with a wild, frightened look, she began a difficult bit of Italian music; but to the terror, of her friend, she blun- dered through the first few' bars, and then tumbled into a jumble of discords, till even Boston courtesy (ould tolerate no longer! A low, hissing sound proceeded from all parts of the hall; as if' by unanimous consent, all joined the popular tide, and derision was poured out upon her to an alarming extent; yet none who saw her then! have ever forgotten the appealing look which followed up such open expressions of disapprobation. Little excuse had -poor Norah to offer for her failure; but somehow, just as she was about to retire in disgrace, her eyes became fixed upon a form leaning against a pillar in the loneliest part of the hall. H-low she could have recognized a familiar face so far away has ever been a mystery to me; but thus it was, and a smile full of meaning radiated over her features. Once more the fingers of the teacher swept the keys of the piano, and a strain of'clear, harmonious melody rippled out, and fastened upon the lhearts of the auditors. Presently another strain more  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7934-00000119"/> 232    nOI5 SCENES AND noMAx SOUNDS, beautiful than the first was heard, and yet another; anld then came a pause followed up by acclamations of wonder and de-- light. Peal after peal of applause urged a repetition of the ; music; but Norah had neither eyes, ears, nor soul, but for the silent admiration of Horace tVane.  Shle had cau'ght her in- spiration fi'om his spirit--its presence had been her ineentive to exertion, and now that she had asserted and proved her musical claims, the good will or bad of the multitude was cast aside as thoughltlessly as it had been gathlered up. She did not shrink away again into her old solitudle of thought, but remained upon the stage, looking down upon the audience with the serenity of an angel. :No arguments could induce her to test her vocal powers a second time. Censure and applause were alike unheeded. She was grateful, thankful, but she could not diminish the fame she had accepted by another display of tangled and irregular impulse. Just then there was a slight disturbance among the audi- tors, and with one bound Horace Vane stood beside her upon the stage. Of all t1he whispered words which brightened up her heart that evening, or how much the views of Horace Vafne served to draw her from a life so unsuited to one of her fragile organization, it is impossible to tell.. It is said that the teach- er looked very pale and sad, as detached sentences of love met his ear; and as Norah was led off, he knew what the crowd surmised--that she was lost to the public forever! But what need of further writing? Who does not know how the trials ended? Horace Vane had never lost silght of her, but wishing to teSt her ftaith as well as Her affection, had allowed' her to encounter the afflictions now so happily ended!

TIMOTHY TROTTER'S SECRET. "I AM myself, alone!" exclaimed Mr. Timothy Trotter, as he strode loftily out of   Hall, giving his hat a slap, which sent it down with surprising rapidity over a pair of ears, whose astonishment at such a proceeding, on the part of the usually quiet Trotter, may be more easily imagined than de- scribed. c "I am myself, alone, and nothing shorter!" again burst forth from the pent-up bosom  of Mr. Trotter, and a wild, free laugh, a sort of juvenile hurricane, rang out upon   OR TIIE WORLD, FROM MY WIND OW.     237 the still air for squares and squares around, until an indignant rattle or two, with muffled figures attached, gave "dreadful note of: preparationl ' to the sensitive ears of the victim but, notling daunted, he poked the figures in the ribs, and shook hands with them till their knuckles cracked again, and con- gratulated them on their good fortune, although to what pecu- liar blessing they were indebted for his good wishes, was quite a mystery.

Let it be per- fectly understood that Mr. Trotter was a little given to the mental aberration under which he appeared to be laboring that evening; however, before the kind watchmen were well away from the house, he was fast asleep upon the settee, by the fire, dreaming of golden rules and orders of love, and the thou- sand bright and glorious things that flutter around the pillow, of those Who close their eyes in the blessed certainty of pos- sessing a pure heart and a fiee conscience. And, notwith- standing the little faux pas of the evening, Timothy Trotter had a free conscience, and a heart full of high resolves and generous impulses, and a hand broad and open as his heart was generous. 'Tis true, the clasp of that hand was round the hammer and mallet all day long. and the heart so full of kind and noble sentiments melasured its pulsations beneath the, coarsest kind of coarse clothing. But what of that?"'A man's a man for a' that," sang the poet; and Timothy Trotter, to use a term more celebrated for depth of expression than supe- rior elegance, was one of the men you read of. but seldom see. If any of his co-laborers were sick or in distress, away would go a week's wages to help him on his feet again, and his heart was never so light as when, from minute 'investigation, he would discover that his pockets were. as well turned outside as in, for all they contained. As I said before, Mr. Timothy Trotter was a good man, and so was- Mrs. Timothy Trotter; indeed, some were inclined to think her the best man of the two. She certainly would have her way, (what woman wouldn't, I wonder?) if she could get it? but then she was just about the smallest, neatest bit of humanity one was likely to meet with in a day's walk. Her house was a perfect picture of   OR THE WORLD FmtO. M Y WINDOW.      239 neatness and economy. She lilad a place for every thing and every thing in, its place. Now, if tie truth must be told, (and we- I mean Inever tell any jhing else.) M1r. T. had one little 'fiult: lie never knew the place for any thing. For instance, ,ie had been told, time and again, that a certain peg behind the door was exclusively for his hat, yet, notwithstanding this, it was too often under the disagreeable necessity of acknowl- edging itself floored. On such occasions Mrs. T. would very properly sulk, until lher spouse, discovering something out of joint, had reinstalled the o'fending hat on its accustomed peg. I write this, not that it is essential to my story, but to show the position in which our worthy couple stood in relation to each othler. -"Where are you goiulg, Mr. T.?" said Mrs. T., about a week after tlte occurrence above mentioned, as her husband began buttoning his coat, preparatolry to a walk. "Did you 1hear me, 1/r. "1Trottter?" She alw\'ys said JSr'. when she wished distinctly to be understood. "To the lodge," replied her- otier half, turning his hands somewhat awkwardly for a philosophller, as lie styled himself. "To the lodge!" screamed Mrs. T.; and down dropped the broom frotn very astonishment, and down dropped Hector's tail, but whether frotn astonishment or some feeling more imme- diately connected with the broomstick, I am quite unable to state; but this I know, that before 1ir. T. had recovered his equanimity, Mrs. T. left tthe room, and returned again fully equipped with bonnet, cloak, and overshoes , to accompany himin. Now, if there was one point upon which M3r. Trotter was peculiarly sensitive, it was that of ridicule; and this was too much of a good thing, and considerably more than he had barXgained for; so he pulled off his overcoat, remembered to  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7934-00000123"/> 240    HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, hlan-g his hat on its peg, and for the first time in his life sat down in a fit of sulks, determined neither to be coaxed nor driven into good humor, until he had gained his point, which, from appearances, seemed likely to occur some time in the course of the next century. Well, matters proceeded in this way for some months. Mr. Trotter sometimes visited the lodge by stealth, sometimes in open defiance to the injunctions of 1Irs. T., until one night, late in the winter, a fire was dis- covered in their house, and only by the exertions of the fire- men were they saved frotn the ruins of that home, which, but for the folly of a wilful woman, might have been an Eden of happiness. In escaping firom the window, 5Mr. Trotter re- ceived an injury which nearly deprived him of existence; and as she hung over his inanimate form, many bitter tears were shed, and many promises of amendment were made, should God spare her husband to her. For weeks and weeks his life was despaired of; but there were kind friends around his bed who relieved his wants with unremitting kindness. There were sympathizing hearts to share the vigils of the stricken wife, and quiet her fears by a thousand acts of benevolence, which were no less freely given or less acceptable in the sight of God that their charitable deeds were hidden fromn the world, under a veil of secrecy. In a bright, cosy little cottage, not far from South Boston bridge, a warm fire blazed in the capacious fireplace, whose beams flashed and sparkled upon the ceiling, and wrought fantastic figures upon the walls, and played the very mischief with the frostwork upon the window panes, till the passers by were tempted to pause and gaze for a moment into this abode of comfort. And bright as was the exterior, they must have travelled a long way to find a picture half so cosy as the   OR THE WORLD FR tOM?.Y WINDOW.     2^1 interior presentedl-a small, neatljy-fiurnished room, with its polished floor uncarpeted, in the centre of which stood a table hIalf hidden by a cloth of' snowy whiteness, with cups and saucers to match, and a neat supper evidently awaiting the arrival of some absentee, to do homage to its cheer. A rosy- cheeked, bustling little woman, lwh om no one could mistake for any one in the world but LMrs. Trotter, for the want of occupa- tion, was sweeping the floor, although you couldn't have found speck of dust in the whole house. This completed to her statisaction, she went to the window, and making a telescope of her hands, looked up the street and down the street, and across the Way, and seeing nothin g but now and then a muf-4 fled traveller, she dl'ew a chair to the hearth, and sitting down wlith her h1ands clasped across her knees, began building castles anmong the 'yreat co als that sent such a cheerful glow into the xroom. They must have been peopled with pleasant fancies, thlose castles; for smiles kept chasing, each other across her face, making dimples in her cheeks with their little feet, and poking their fingers in her eyes until they were half closed. She had been dreaming some time, when a brand fell down, and, of course, her castle tumbled down withl it.; so she started o;r the broom again to brush up the ashes. but had scarcely begun to use it when the door opened, and a tall, pale man - you would never hiave guessed who he was-- entered, preceded by his fast friend, Hector.

Not that he feared Mrs. Trotter. O, dear, no! for she was busy undoing the walking bundle that had come home. First she took off his overcoat and hat, then unwrapped a dozen or two of comforters from his neck, then she took off his mittens, and rubbed his hands, and breathed on them to make them warm, as if there wasn't a man on earth but old Timothy Trotter. "Please, may I go to the lodge to-night?" said he, rather maliciously, as she sat on a little stool at hiU feet, pulling off his overshoes. This was too much for }Mrs. Trotter, who had been all the time trying to choke down her emotions. "God bless 'em," said she, bursting into tears, and throwing her arms around his neck "God bless 'em for the patience and gentleness with which they watched your slightest movement, and antici- pated your wants when you were too ill to express them! Bless 'em for their sympathy and encouragement, even when we expected each breath would be your last; and when you grew better, and began to know me, and when I could lay my head on your pillow and sleep soundly - for I couldn't rest while you were so ill - there was always a kind brother by your side; and I said God bless 'em then, and I say God bless 'cm now!

At length the storm blew over, and creeping out of Trotter's arms--f-or he, good soul, unaccustomed to scenes, had dozed off to sleep under the mesmeric influence of the one just enacted,- she kindled the fire anew, took off the tea- kettle, that had been indignantly boiling over for the last ten minutes, and began preparing supper as if nothing unusual had happened ;'while Hector, thinking that he had remained quite long enough in the cold for one offence, crept quietly in, snuggled himself down on the hearth rug, and wrapping his tail around him to save Mr. Trotter's boots the temptation of stepping on it, was in dreamnland, if dogs ever visit that con- tinent, long before Mrs. Trotter had finished preparation for supper. Years have come and gone since the facts (for facts they are) above related transpired -years that have left the snows of life's winter upon the brow of the aged couple. The small house has long since been exchanged for one of more stately pretensions. The influence of kind friends raised them from comparative poverty to independence, and fortune, smiling upon their heart union, poured down a shower of golden gifts in the form of a legacy from a distant relative. Affliction taught them to depend less upon the world, and more upon each other, for happiness. Mr. Trotter still con- tinues an honorable member of the society of Odd Fellows; and I need scarcely add that Mrs. T'. is never happier than when he can visit his lodge, unless, indeed, it is when she can find Willing listeners to the oft-told tale of the kindness they received from that source when in affliction; and as I heard her recital of it not very many months ago, and as my eye wandered around the comfortable home, and I thought, This is  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7934-00000125"/> 244      HOME SCENES XAND HOME.

So vmused a fair bride, as she sat alone, with her cheek resting upon her hand. Not that she distrusted her affianced husband, not that the slightest fear of unrequited love flitted across her mind. O, no! But that love seemed to her to be the great requisite of happiness, and in her own blissfulness, she could,;but pity those who were not equally blessed with herself. It was a night of unutterable beauty, such a one as not unfrequently rests alike upon thed gloomy chaparrals and the brilliant city of Mexico. WreIaths of honeysuckle swayed to and fio in the pure light, and every breath of air that touched her cheek came laden with the heart wealth of a thousand flowers; and over' all' the moonlight shed an al- most palpable halo of glory, which, to her enthusiastic mind, seemed a beautifuill and material woof for the formation of her dearest dreams. Thle real was wrapped up in the ideal, a'ud all her musings were softened and spiritualized by a commu- nion with her other self- the spirit of love. Al, who could blame her for her devotion?  J1Who has not passed moments of brightness so intense that the heart lived an age of happi- ness in their flight? --moments when the soul,'with its undis- covered fire slumbering in fancied security, becomes suddenly awakened to a sense of its capacity for happiness, and learns N   OR THE WORLD FRO 3I MY WINDOW.      249 !   that its immortal nature is susceptible of mortal passions! The life of Luath Lauraine had been a tissue of dreams, each more beautiful in their coloring, until the climax of earthly joy seemed to have been gained for her heart. Even the dark cloud that had dwelt upon the faces of her countrymen, in view of oppression and disaster, could not reach her hope- fill spirit, for life was too new and fiesh to admit a shadow upon the future. It came at last--thlat dark cloud that for months lad hung like a death shroud over the bosom of a great nation. It came at last, and bright eyes grew dim with looking into the grave of love, and warm hearts grew cold with fear, as the echoes of war spread around and gave note of homesteads desolated and of hearts bereaved ; yet the only im- pulse it brought to Luath's imind was that of an indefinite excite- ment, and the thourght, perhaps, of the littleness of the object to be attained by so much bloodshed! But with the cloud of war came one of noble presence, one of our own race, yet far superior to those she had been accustomed to see; and from one step to another he had gained ascendency over her spirit, until in the wide world there was nothing but his presence which seemed at all desirable. She was very beautiful at all times, especially so as she sat in the embrasure of the win- dow on her bridal night, giving way to pleasant fancies. The sun of sixteen summers bhad ripened the opening bud into bright and glorious bloom, and as she -stood upon the thresh- old of womanhood, it seemed as if earth had never left the. taint of mortality upon the spirit wings of a purer angel. A slight rustle of the curtains st:artled the drearner from her revery, and she started up to meet the imagined intruder. For a moment she listened in breathless eagerness, like some beautiful statue; but froom the continued silence, and sup-  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7934-00000128"/> 250    iHOMUE SCENES ANBD HOME SOUNDS, posing she had been mistaken, a new thought evidently drift- ed across her mind, and, with a pleasant smile, she glided from the room, unmindfull of a pair of eyes, almost fearful in their lustre, that followed her retreating folrm out of the thick folds of the curtains opposite. A stronger contrast could not have been found thanl between the young girl whose steps still echoed in the corridor- and the strange, dark woman whose eyes were riveted on the door through which she de- parted. If the -bride was beautiful in her trusting innocence, O, supremely beautiful, and fearful withal, was that unwel- come visitor, whose quick, convulsive breathing gave the only evidence of life and animation; and as the memory of deep wrongs swept over her bosom, her eyes, so fixed, yet daz- zling in their expression. mirrored forth an eternity of thought as thrilling as it was silent. The same moon that had showered its lustre on thelf earnest-hearted bride, was floating in glory around the victim of perfidy. The same starlighit that had wreathed diamonds amrid the curls of the innocent girl, played in fitful - almost mournful - gleams around the raven hair of the guilty woman. Very pale and sad she looked in the dim light, like sone half-animate statue; for above the music of the leaves and the hum of the waterfalls might have been heard the distinct pulsation of a heart maddened by wrongs, and yearning for revenge. In no nation of the world is each passion of human nature so distinct, yet powerful, as among the Mexicans. Thiere is a fire in their half-Spanish, half-In- dian blood, which kindles at a breath, and is never after sub- dued until the object, whether of' love, hatred, or revenge, is attained. The fo)rce of this truth was strongly delineated in the dark face of Eiiowine Montano, but the quivering lip and the menacing brilliancy of her strange animal eyes,'were tlihe   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.       251 only manifestations of the agony of her heart. Moonlight, music, and blossoms were all lost upon her, for her soul had gone down with memory, and was now conning over the dusty relics which had lain so. long neglected. First, like a pure angel, came the thoughts of her innocent, sunny-hearted childhood. The old farm-house nestling down within the shadow of the chaparral; the tiny streamlet that quivered past its door; the sloping lawn where she had played in in- fancy; and above them gleamed the face of her mother ; but not the mother she had known. Too well she knew the dark eyes, that had so often dwelt in fondness on her face, were dimmed with weeping; her raven hair, so rich in its glossy brightness, blighted in its beauty; the dear face, once so beautiful, wrinkled and worn in' its grief;--all ere there, like silent phantoms, to reproach her with guilt. For a mo- ment her breast throbbed as if swollen by some great sorrow, and her eyes grew moist and dim but with a mighty effort, all traces of sorrow and repentance had vanished, and in their stead appeared a smile full of scorn and hatred for the memo- ry of that home made desolate; of the crime that had con- signed her to an ignominious life, and plainer than all came the memory of him who had wrought this change, till her eyes grew still more terrible in their lustre, and her hand sought with nervous haste a dagger, whose hilt gleamed through the folds of her mantle. This action, involuntary as it was, seemed to arouse her to a sense of the danger by which she was surrounded, and, glancing hurriedly around, to assure herself that she was alone, and finding the room unoc- cupied, she crept to the station the bride had left, and was soon lost againg in bitter memories.

A step was heard to break the silence of the hall, and as it ap- preached the door, the red spot on her cheek grew still more vivid by contrast with the paleness of her lips. "'Tis his step," she murmured, " and who should know it so well as I?" A flood of radiance showered from the chandeliers that decked the corridor, as. the door opened to admit the bride- groom, and as he paused for a moment in the opened door, a more superb picture of manly beauty could scarcely be im- agined. Slight but exquisitely formed, with a cast of features peculiarly Spanish, with its clear, rich blood lighting up a somewhat swarthy complexion, and ever beaming with ad- ditional lustre, as they sought in the darkness to meet the glance of his affianced, no one would have dreamed, could they have seen Gustave Mignore at that moment, that his heart was the receptacle of crime, or his clear, hazel eyes but ministers to a guilty soul.

"Ellowine," said he, when he had sufficiently recovered 'elf-possession as to enable hm to speak, "' what in the name of Heaven brings you here?" "( To witness your nuptials, lord of mine," replied she, in a voice in which love and revenge were strangely warring. "No more false priests --no more shameful vows to be flung aside with the heart to which they are plighted - no more oaths registered against you in eternity! Gustave, I told you if you married this child, I would make one at the altar - my heart shall not be the only one broken!" "Ellowine, are you mad?" said Gustave; but his voice trembled, and his manner showed but too plainly how much he feared the woman before him. ' "Mad!" she replied, and her words were sad and low now; "no, not mad.  That is past. The madness--the dream which created it, as beautiful in its brevity as fearful. in its awakening--all are past now, yielded up for the in- sanity of a dark heart and crazed brain! O, no!

The nonchalance of his manner had deserted him, and he cowered beneath her steadfast gaze, as if in the presence of an avenging angel! "What do you require?" said he. "If money, all I pos- sess is yours; only leave me." "Money!" replied she, scornfully. "Can money restore me your love--my own respect?  No, Gustave. You might have spared that insult.

"S/hall not!?' echoed he, delridinfrlt. "Ay, shall not! As sure as you stand at the altar with that girl, that act will be the signal for a woman's retribution upon her wronger." Gustave felt that the erisis of his fate was at hand. Hemmed in on all sides, with no hope for escape, nothing before him but exposure, or still deeper guilt, he leaned against the mantel-piece in deep abstraction, as if taking in a full survey of the peril to which he was exposed. "She must die!" thought he, as his eye caught the view of a dag- ger at her side. "Your folly be upon your own head!" said he, springing forward.

Who shall say there is no God, when it is his "still small voice" the spirit fears in hours of darkness and of gloom? Who shall say there is no retribution for sin, when the crim- inal fears to be alone with the phantoms of his crimes? "She dare not," muttered Gustave between his clinched teeth; but his haggard face gave the lie to his words. He knew too well that Ellowine was just, the woman to dare any thing to, revenge a wrong, and his own conscience told him how deep her wrong had been. Agitated and perplexed, he knew not what course to pursue. It was near the hour for the nuptial ceremony, and his absence had already been com- mented upon by the guests. Now it was that the black sins of his life were felt most vividly. 'Tis true, in other days he had loved Ellowine, as much as it was possible for one of his temperament to love any thing but himself; and sometimes he had been almost persuaded to make her the only repara- tion in his power; but the fear of the world, that terrible bughear which overcomes many good intentions, would in- trude and crush down his better impulses. There was a fas- cination in the society of Luath which kept him' at her side. She was so gentle and trusting in her love that her very dependence won more reverence from his heart than the self- reliant -Ellowine could command. For a moment he resolved to seek out Luath, and tell her of his former intimacy with Ellowine; but the fear that her pure mind would shrink from a crime so appalling in its nature deterred him,. A gush * * i.*   OR THE WORLD PROM MY WINDOW.       257 of music, which came floating from a distant hall, recalled him to consciousness, and with a slow step he proceeded to join the bridal party in the chapel. The young bride was already there, and turning from her sweet face, he glanced hastily around the chapel; but meeting only groups of sunny faces, he clasped the hand of Luath, and Ellowine was forgotten! Gloriously the taper lights flooded the holy place of prayer! The deep- toned organ had pealed a solemn strain of devotion, and the aged priest, with his thin, white locks drifting over his robe like falling snow, lifted up his voice in earnest prayer for the happiness of the young couple whoso destinies were so soon to be united. It was indeed a beautiful picture - the young bride, so innocent in her idolatry - the bridegroom, whose heart was touched for once by the inspiration of Christianity -the reverend   priest--the warm-hearted friends; and above them all, the blessed picture of the Savior dying for the sins of mankind, beamed lilke a beautiful promise of for- giveness here, and salvation beyond the grave. Nothing now remained but the imposing ceremony of marriage; but as Gustave produced the ring, a thrill of horror ran through his veins, for his keen eye had detected the pale face of Ellowine, whiter than the marble against which she. leaned. In des- perate haste he sought to place- thering upon the finger of the bride, but her eyes were on him, and as lie raised his hand, with a mocking laugh she sprang from her concealment, dashed it to the pavement, and with folded arms confronted the assembly. ' I told you I would make one at. your wedding, and you :b. see I have kept my word." Quick asd thought Gustave sprang forward to seize her, proclaimintg that she was a maniac; but her dagger was itn her 22  ,  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7934-00000132"/> 258    SHOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, hand and revenge in her heart, and the next moment Gustave lay a bleeding corpse at the altar!"You stole him from me, ay, you!" she cried, and with the strength of madness she raised the bride and flung her a senseless mass upon her dead husband's bosom; then taking advantage of the crowd, she sprang through the open window, and fled into a thicket near at, hand. Soon as those present could collect their shattered senses, search was made, but to no purpose. She had com- pleted her errand, and effected her escape. For hours the bride lay in a swoon so deep that death and nature were evi- dently contending for mastery over each other; and when at last her eyelids unclosed, the vacant glance and restless head told too plainly that the sun of her life had gone down in a night of hopeless insanity - an innocent victim to the crime of another! One more leaf, and our story is done; and if in its perusal one heart has felt the truth that guilt is its own avenger, the author is repaid for her efforts. Where the flowering shrubs grew thickest, and the sun- shine lay all the dlay on their blossoms, like drops of gold on snow, a small, neat cottage looked out from the vines which surrounded it, as if to invite -the wayworn traveller to partake of the hospitality of its inmates; and yet so still and subdued was all around, that the heart involuntarily grew sad as it approached a scene so full of quiet beauty. Even the old honeysuckle that swayed from the lattice work seemed whis- pering sad and low, as if in sympathy. with the aged pair that for years had been its lonely occupants. It had not always been thus. One child had blessed their early union, and the deep devotion of their souls had been lavished upon her, until she became an object of idolatry. She was the sun that   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.       259 illumined their humble dwelling, the bird whose music dwelt in their bosom, the link which drew their souls nearer to God's footstool; and when she was dearest and most treas- ured, a blight came upon the beautiful flower, and with it withered the hearts that had lived but for her happiness. On the evening after the murder in the chapel, an old man and a gray-haired woman sat brooding amid the shadows that even- ing was flingcing around their hearthstone. It was the birth. night of their child, their lost Ellowine; and in the grief of memory, each seemed to find a relief in silence, rather than words. The mother's eyes were riveted in painful solicitude upon a vacant chair at one corner of the hearth; the father's hand rested upon the Bible, which lay upon the stand, but his soul seemed to have forgotten its accustomed reverence in musing upon the past. The picture of a dark-eyed girl was before him. Those dark eyes that had so often watched his coming--the little feet that had flown to meet him on his return from labor- the hands that had busied themselves for his comfort- where were they now?   Slowly and sadly these visions crept into his mind, till his head bowed upon the sacred page, and his whole frame trembled with the violence of his grief. The true-hearted wife, forgetful of the mother in her husband's anguish, came softly to his side, and raising his head to her bosom, parted the white locks from his brow, and whispered, "Let us thank God we are still left to each other!" A deep sob broke the stillness, and the child of their affection was before them. The dark curls that had been their pride were tangled and matted with dew; her eyes seemed starting from their sockets, and the unnatural rim of purple that bound them round told more than words / .,  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7934-00000133"/> 260    HOME SCENES AND' HOME SOUNDSt the suffering she had endured. With one accord the parents sprang up to meet the prodigal; but she eluded their grasp, and fell upon her knees at their feet. 4"Don't - don't touch mie," said she, shrinking from their outstretched arms; " don't touch me! Let me die here at your feet, reading forgiveness in your dear faces, as I do now; but not there, not in your arms, not on the bosom, mother, that sheltered me in inno- cence!" "Eilowine, my own beautiful child," murmured the mother, gathering her shrinking form in her arms. "I am dying, mother," she continued, " but I could not die away from you! I could not bear -to be laid in the ground by strange hands; so I crept here that I might have some one to shed a tear for my misery." With each word she uttered it was evident that death was indeed approaching. They gathered her up, and laid her upon the bed where she had so often slept in innocence, and the old man again sought-the holy page whose sacred prom- ises extend even to the eleventh hour; and never had those beautiful words, "i2feither do I condemn thee," been given with more impressive awe than at that bed of death. Never had the breath of supplication risen from the heart to heaven with a deeper humility or-a holier trust than from the stricken hearts who were pleading for a repentant sinner. Ah, that deep, abiding faith, which strengthens the soul in wildest grief to lay hold upon the promises of God! Give me the religion of faith, whose attendafnts are mercy and charity, and I renounce all claim to creed in favor of those who choose to grope their way to heaven through the door of doubt and de- spondency. If reason and philosophy must necessarily deprive   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.      261 me of the trust I have in the will and power of God, let me be ever in the dark, for my weak mind could never compre- hend the sophistry of religion! Long did the earnest tones of prayer break the quiet of the cottage, and when it was ended, and the aged couple rose from their knees, they sought to unclasp the hands raised in supplication, but shrunk from their icy coldness; and the moon, rising at that moment, flung a light into the quiet- room, weaving a halo around the pale face, whose rigid lineaments told the parents that they were childless and alone! The spirit of the criminal but repentant woman had been borne away on the wings of prayer; and who shall say it did not gain admittance within the gates of paradise? Where the wild flowers are thickest they made a grave for their lost treasure; but before the blossoms were withered, another, and yet another grave appeared beside it, and the parents were at rest. The cottage is tenanted by strangers, but the three graves are sacred and unmolested, while the story of Ellowine is often rehearsed and descanted upon as a warn- ing against crime, and an example of its retribution. \             , /  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7934-00000134"/> 262     HO-R E SCENES AND HO3IE SOUNDS, TO MRS.

I plead guilty to the charge of never being sutrprised at any thing; but I have an old habit of wondering if such and such a circumstance ever happened to such or such a person; and so I find myself, scarcely knowing why, wondering if the seemingly gay and hap- py crowd around me are susceptible to the impulses which are supposed to govern the world at large --if ever they-have headaches, and heartaches, and sorrows lying ' too deep for tears? - if fashion builds up a fort between the spirit and its affections; or if, like every-day humanity, they yield in turn to hopes and joys, and doubts and fears!

Like children in th( dark, we are afraid to think, yet unable to shut out the tide of memory! Words of love, which we have pressed awray in our hearts like floweirs in books, are constantly mocking our anguish. It comes but once in a lifetime - that fearful turn. ing in the tide of affection - when we know the past must be cast from us, yet dare not- tear away the shelter of our lives to stand so fearfully alone! when we catch at the faintest hope, as the drowning catcl at straws --when we dwell with a re- finement of anguish upon every look and tone of love, now unutterably dear to us, until our hearts are broken with grief- when we feel that our arms must, loosen their hold around the self-created idol, and clasp in its stead the shadow of a great sorrow--when a clhance word, or tone, or note of music, will burst over the spirit in a flood of bitterness, mocking that as- 8sumption of "peace where there is no peace." What if wealth, with its luxuriant appliances, could spread out for our feet a carpet of gold ; would our heart moan the less for the familiar form upon which it leaned? What if fame could wreathe the brow with its brightest laurels'; could we hear the applause of the whole world, if that one voice to which we yielded defer- ence was silent? What if all the nations under the sun were gazing upon us with reverent admiration; could we feel a glow of pride, while the glance we yearn for most is coldly with- drawn? O, no! no! no!  Say what you will, we love but once, and that once forever!

It is just as easy to imitate the example of Him who " went about doing good," as it is to plant thorns where there might spring roses, or passing over the beams in our own eyes, to seek for, and exaggerate, the motes within our neighbors'.

A COUNTRY SKETCH. THE sauciest thing alive was that gypsy of an aunt Fanny of mine. I dare say, now, you all thought that I was about writing a great long story of some starched-up old maid, who had said "no " till there were no more nice young; men to say "no" to. Catch me doing any thing half so foolish, with the memory of bright Fanny Ray breaking up through the mist of old-time reminiscences: She was a regular bird of para- dise to our sombre little village, and I'm not quite sure thlat we should have been greatly surprised had she taken wing- some fine morning, with a gush of melody, and drifted off to heaven. If she was tot an angel, our eastern beaux took the responsibility of innumerable fibs, for she had been voted one, until we had all made up our minds to credit the assertion, To be sure, she came honestly enough by her good qualities, for she was born amid the melody and the perfume of a bright May morning, and some how the music got into her heart and the brightness into her eyes, until, amid the glad things that love the sunshine, she became the gladsomest of all. Bless- ings on her! how we all loved and petted her, just to see the roguish smiles chase each other over her sweet face, to lose themselves in the little pitfalls of her cheeks; and more than one heart tumbled into those same pitfalls too, let me tell you, though she did not seem at all aware of her superior attrac- tion, or think herself a bit more lovable than any of us every- day sort of girls. Then with me she would sometimes put on such airs, and try to look serious and stately, because she happened to be my aunt, just as if I didn't know that we had   OiR THE WORLD LK'ROM MY WINDOW.     267 been children together, and had played truant from the same school, and waded through the same mud puddles, and then ran home ready to break our necks, to make our parents think we had been all sorts of good. I was three years her elder, too, but that had no/weight with her, for somehow she found i out that nature has its own classifications, regardless of estab- lished rule, and what I exceeded in years she made up in knowledge. Out in the broad green fields, where the breath of flowers swept up from the tangled grass, would Fanny Ray wander for hours together, and sometimes a half shadow would hover around her face, and settle there for a moment,- and then, as if the sunlight of her heart lad gushed upon some happy thought, the shadow would creep away again, and the face resume its accustomed dash of brightness. On one of these morning rambles, when the sun, breaking through the clouds with the promise of a glorious day, had kissed the dew from the blossoms, she wandered farther than usual, and was some- what surprised to find herself in the very heart of a forest, with nothing around her but the birds and the flowers to dis- turb the harmony of her revelries. Glimpses of the clear sky broke in every now and then through the thick leaves, and the sunbeams that shattered against the tall trees came settling down in detached bits upon the rich turf, like little flakes of gold. A tiny rivulet quivered and flashed, like a crazy ser- pent, in the warm light, and not content with that, the little ripples kept leaping up into the air, as if longing to kiss each other, but not daring to take such a liberty, they would tumble back again, and drift on,- ", To wreck their freight of sunshine on the sand." It is an established fact, that our New England woods are  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7934-00000137"/> 268    HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, notorious for all sorts of queer doings -from therevelling of fairies to the howling of dryads--and it was not to be expected that a timid little thing like Fanny Ray would feel very much at her ease when in such dangerous proximity. But there was so much in nature that harmonized with her own beautiful heart, that she soon forgot her fears, and nestled down in the warm sunshine, to dream away anl hour in the forest quietude. A crackling in the bushes arrested her attention, and before she could gain her feet, a great shaggy dog, with blazing eyes, and a tail that looked as if it had been through the revolutionary war, burst into the enclosure, and came bounding towards her with his mouth wide open, as if asking her to admire his teeth. Perhaps she didn't try to make herself scarce about that time; but it was no use though, for right in the path stood a young man whose pleasant face and big blue eyes were provokingly full of mirth at sight of her perplexity. For a moment Fanny looked as if it had been raining blushes, and she had been caught in a smart shower; then the ridiculousness of her position seemed to touch a new chord, and a joyous peal of laughter--a sort of juvenile earthquake ---rang out among the trees, and, with a saucy frankness, she informed the intruder by what means she had been .led so far from her cottage. Of course, there was no need of any further introduction; so the stranger very gal- lantly, not to say unselfishy, urged her to resume her seat, and in ten minutes more he had made himself acquainted with her whole history, knew who she was, where she lived, whom she liked, how large the village was, and what number of pretty girls it contained. There was no such word as prude in aunt Fanny's dic- tionary, and she had no idea of being dependent upon any one   OR THE WORLD PROM MY WINDOW,      269 else for her notions of propriety. I have been scolded often and often enough for my queer sentiments, or disregard of conventional rules on trifling points of etiquette ; but when the censors are away from me, I don't choose to remember what they have said, and find more pleasure in thinking of people untrammelled by old customs and old peculiarities, than in dwelling upon associations formed by rule, and measured with the same precision that one would measure tape and bobbin lace. Aunt Fanny's joyousness was the greatest ene- my in the world to any thing like a distance of feeling; so the stranger chatted with her as familiarly as if he had known her all his life, and didn't greatly care to know any thing else. Not on such terms of friendly footing, however, were she and the big dog who had occasioned her so much fright. She had offended his dignity at the first onset, by placing her dainty little foot on that apology for a tail of his, as he lay crouching down among the violets, and no petting or coaxing could in- duce him to forgive the insult. It might have been mischief, or it might have been an indefinite feeling of something holy and beautiful, struggling into life within his bosom, that wrought the change; but certain it was the stranger's voice grew low and sweet in its earnestness, as words of gentle meaning drifted down into the heart of the listener. There had been no experience in the arts and wiles of polished soci- ety to check the progress of those words; so they melted there, and moulded an image that should never more be dis- placed--not even in eternity, Ah, there is something sa- cred to me in this unconscious yielding up of the heart to a great love - this folding of the spirit wings upon the bosom of faith. All is not love that bears its semblance. It is an every-day word, hackneyed and abused until it has lost its 23*  /        &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7934-00000138"/> 270    HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, original meaning, if not its original power. It is-not in the sunshine of early youth that its influence is most intense. Then it is too often the offspring of a vacant mind or ready opportunity, and passes away like a shadow on the clear water; but when the heart has become chastened and refined, when the intellect is matured and resolute, then it twines itself around the spirit with a strength and intensity that outlives the darkness and the storms of life, and works out a consum- mation to its own earnest desires. I do iot know what the stranger's thoughts were in those moments of companionship. They were light enough, probably, and easily banished. But with Fanny Ray there had been but one step from the joyous girl to the thoughtful woman. This was but the beginning of their holy confidence; and after that they met again and again, until the day would have been dark indeed not bright- ened by his presence, I know there are those who will question the prudence of Fanny Ray; but how could she think there was aught of impropriety in that which brought such an eternity of happiness to her spirit. True, she closed her heart upon its treasure; not that she doubted his rectitude of principle or her own strength, but that she could not bear to have a careless eye rest for one moment upon that which had grown so sacred to her. So that he was by her side-- this stranger with his handsome face and eloquent eyes; whose lightest touch had power to send the blood surging up her bosom like ocean waves - she forgot prudence, discretion, judgment, every thing but the unacknowledged love which had made them one in impulse. And oftentimes, when he was away, the pleasant face would hover around her dreams, and the beautiful lips would bend lovingly to her own; and sometimes, out in the broad daylight, she would close her eyes /    OR THE WORLD PROM MY WINDOW.       271 beneath the pressure of happy thoughts; but the nature of them was, like every fhing else connected with their object, a sacred thing locked within her own breast. Ah, a happy -woman was Fanny Ray, moving about so quiet and thought- ful, as one living within the influence of some rich dream. All above and around seemed to have taken a new lease of brightness from the coloring of her fancies. Not a flower bloomed as it had bloomed before; not a gush of bird melody came drifting up from the jostling leaves but had stolen a wilder tone from the music of her full heart. And all this while the stranger had never spoken of love: yet, from some intuitive knowledge, she felt that a heart was in her keeping, which, of the wide world, would throb but for one being, and so throb forever-- would love but once, and that once for all eternity. But the time came all too soon for the last meet- ing within the solemn stillness of their forest retreat. Time after time had the stranger )been urged, by letter, of the ne- cessity to leave a place so full of happy memories, and as often found some excuse to delay his intended departure. And now that there was no longer any plea, he had come to look his last for months -perhaps forever - upon the sweet face upturned so trustingly to his. It was a rare evening, eloquent with poetry and love. There was not a breath of air afloat to disturb even the forest leaves; so they nestled to- gether as quiet and as still as if they, too, were sentient, and wanted rest. The moon broke up like a glad face through the fleecy clouds, and the mist began to gather about the river, and sparkle and gash amid the moonbeams, while just at their feet a little cascade came trickling down the rocks, like a shower of stars. But for once the beauty of nature was lost upon the absorbed senses of the lovers. The face  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7934-00000139"/> 272    HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, of Fanny Ray was very pale and stiH- so still that it might have been mistaken for chiselled marble, as it gleamed out in the moonlight. At last, the- silence, which was becoming painful, was broken by the thrilling tones of the stranger's voice, as he gathered the passive form tenderly to his heart. "We must part-to-night," murmured the stranger, pressing his lips to the poor wet eyes, so eloquent in their sorrow. "I know it," replied Fanny. "Would to God that I had shut my heart against the pleadings of affection before it learned so to long for your presence! But I forgot every thing but that which- I ought most to have remembered, and only thought of the earnest and vivid faith to which I clung, and which made me so helpless and dependent, even while your love-for you do love me - was hovering around my spirit, to settle there forever. I cannot control my heart to- night, for while you are here, it will claim sympathy. When you are gone, do not fear for me. But tonight. I knew that the dream must break up in time; but now that it has come to pass, it seems so cruel, so sudden, that I can only weep." Again the pressure tightened around the form of Fanny, and a smile of triumph wreathed the finely-curved lips of the stranger. It was a frank and generous smile, and one which failed to shadow forth aught but an honest and affectionate heart. He was an enthusiast in the fullest sense of the word, with a soul all poetry, and a heart all love. And admiration for his superior genius, reverence for his intellect, and sym- pathy with his enthusiasm - all had shared the worship of Fanny Ray, and served to intensify and strengthen his power over her affections. "I'm but a poor student, Fanny," resumed the stranger,   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW,      273 -i with a hard, dark life before me. I cannot ask you to share it. I can only ask you to remember me as one who would sacrifice all the world, were it at his disposal, to secure your happiness, and so remembering me, to hope on for that bri ghter hour which will come to all who have to struggle g    through clouds and tempests, and the faith to look onward and upward for the consummation of their hopes. Will you think kindly of the lonely student, when he has gone far away to make a name and a home, in the hope that it may yet be shared by you, my diamond?" "O, let me share your darkness," exclaimed Fanny, pas- sionately. "'Take me with you now. I am strong and reso- lute, and can bear all the storms of your path. O, when I tell you of a face whose every feature is engraved upon my soul, of a voice whose lightest tone vibrates to my heart, till it shudders with its burden of happiness; when I tell you I have dreamed over that face, till my dreams have become reality; and when I tell you I have yearned to hear those tones, and loathed myself for yearning, you will not, cannot leave my heart to throb itself to death against the doubts and fears your absence will create. Take me with you. I know it is wrong for me thus to plead with you - I know it is un- womanly-but what can I do? I have grown from- the sunny-hearted girl to the dreamvy enthusiast, with but one thought, one impulse, one idea in my whole soul- its inor- dinate love for you." Again the bright smile played for a moment over the fea- tures of the stranger, and again he raised her tearful face from his bosom to look into the earnest eyes of Fanny RayS Pride, woman's pride, was all gone from that sorrowful face, and she nestled closer to his side, and murmured low words  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7934-00000140"/> 274    HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, of tenderness and of grief, such as at parting a mother would breathe upon the lips of an only child. It had been but a trial of her faith, not of affection. So he parted the damp curls from her brow, drew the little restless head closer to lis breast, and between smiles and kisses, prevailed upon her, as it became imperative for him to leave the village on the mor-, row, to allow him to accompany her home, and gain, if pos- sible, from her parents a consent to their union. The light sprang back to the eye of Fanny Ray, and the music to her heart, like a glad bird to its wildwood nest. But just as their lips met, a half-suppressed laugh trembled through the leaves, "and a shower of dewdrops rained down from the branching limbs. Fanny started to her feet just in time to discover a dozen roguish eyes peeping through the tangled branches, and half as many heads making a framework of the green leaves.        ) 4"How nicely you did keep your own counsel, aunt Fanny," exclaimed the ringleader of the surprise party, " and what a pity it was to break the neck of that kiss! eh, Fanny. Why, the tiniest breeze in the world would have been squeezed to death, if it had attempted to pass between your lips. O, dear me, I quite forgot the gentleman. Introduce us, Fanny ;" and down popped the crowd, one after another, from the trees where they had stationed themselves before the arrival of the lovers. It really was too bad to spoil sport after that man- ner; but then we had a right to aunt Fanny's confidence, and when we found it withheld from us, we took occasion to extort it after our own fashion. It wasn't the first time we had watched her out into the forest, and got a, glimpse of her would-be invisible lover ; and, as we managed to be in at the death? she had only to put a pleasant face upon the affair and   OR THE WORLD FROM MY WINDOW.      275 take the whole party as body guard to the cottage. The maddest fairies that ever did live could not begin to cut up such pranks as we did on that memorable journey home. The stranger looked so proud and stately, and Fanny so quiet and happy, that we had enough to do to tease them into an acknowledgment of our presence---so selfish is happiness. Out under the wild, green arches, over fields of blossoms, and through almost palpable moonbeams, that were stooping to the grass blade like so many bits of thistledown, scarcely touching the rich turf, flew our merry troop, never stopping for breath until we came to the door of uncle Ray's bird', i    nest of a cottage.- It was a warm evening, and uncle Ray, from lack of thought, was half asleep upon the window seat. A large, full vine was srwaying to and fro with a soft murmur, occasionally drifting in and leaving a blossom upon the white head of the sleeper, and retreating again with the same cau- tious quietude. A glorious specimen of a New England farmer was uncle Ray, with a hand broad and open, as his heart was free from care. True, its clasp was round the plough or the scythe all day long, 'and the heart so free and generous measured its pulsations beneath the roughest kind of a homespun coat; but 'a man's a man for a' that," and uncle Ray was as perfect a mortal as earth could produce, and keep up its reputation for being only an imperfect school for the preparation of people for a brighter degree above. Yes, indeed; uncle Ray was a' good man, and so was Fanny's mother, aunt -Ray. Some people said she was the best man of the two. She would have her own way--and a very nice way it was, too - and her own say, whether it concerned the chickens, and their mischievous depredations, or uncle Ray's legs, that somehow had got a fashion of crossing themselves  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7934-00000141"/> 276   , 6HOME SCENES AND HOME SOUNDS, upon the toilet table near the window, much to the disarrange- ment of its snowy covering. "Where can Fanny be all this time?" exclaimed aunt Ray, on the evening of which I am writing. "Eh - who -- what?" grunted uncle Ray, between a mutter and a snore. "Eh -- who - what?" echoed the good wife, provoked at his indifference. '"Where can Fannybe? Here it is half past eight o'clock, and she away." "She'll be at home in good time, I'll answer for it," said he, arousing himself enough to understand the purport of her speech. The next minute his head looked like a big pump- kin, under a yellow pocket handkerchief, carefully spread over it, and he was snoring ,away as hard as ever. "Umph," muttered aunt Ray; and off she went to the cellar stairs for the broom, although you couldn't have found a speck of dirt in the whole house. Just as she was com- fortably under way with her sweeping, the vines parted, and that big dog, who seemed determined to be in every body's mess, came dashing in through the open window, making uncle Ray's head a stepping stone in his progress. Down dropped the broom from aunt Ray's hands from very as- tonishment, and down dropped the dog's tail, but whether from astonishment, or some feeling more immediately con- nected with the broomstick, I'm quite unable to say; at any rate, you can't begin to think how nnuch quicker he went out of the window, with uncle Ray's bootjack spinning after him, than he came in. He didn't try that game-of grand and lofty  tumbling the second time, you had better believe; in fact, there was no occasion for it, for just then the whole party of us came bursting through the door, dragging in aunt Fanny *  4     v   OR THE WORLD FROM- MY WINDOW.      2" and the stranger lover. If it had been fugitive slave times, we might have got a premium, for we had caught a man, in good earnest. Aunt Ray's eyes grew big as saucers; but to our surprise, uncle Ray, who was wonderfully wide awake by this time, caught the stranger in his arms, and shook hands with him till his knuckles cracked again, and laughed so loud and long that I, for one, began to think seriously of following the dog's example, and making a hasty exit out of the window. "All right, eh?"laughed uncle Ray, poking -his fingers into the stranger's ribs, as if he was an old friend, and priv- ileged to be poked. "All right-- romantic, eh? love under the rose." It didn't occur to me at the time, but with all due respect to uncle Ray, I don't believe he could have told the meaning of " under the rose " if any one had asked him. I'm sure I couldn't, although my education has become somewhat more extended since that period. Well, the truth of the whole story was, that the stranger was aunt Fanny's third cousin- a very convenient relationship - and from some cause rela- tive to joint estates, it was desired by the parents of both. parties that the families should be united by marriage. Now, uncle Ray knew well enough that if Fanny thought there was any business arrangement to be mixed up in her life lease of love, nothing could induce her to marry; and he o knew well enough, too, that if he told his wife, Fanny was bound to know it in five minutes after; and so the whole affair was explained, and Charlie Ray- that's the stranger -was forgiven for his share in the plot, and such a happy evening as we all' passed you never did see. It was cruel, though, for Charlie Ray to keep those great, saucy blue eyes :^       24  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7934-00000142"/> 278    -HOIE SCENES AND HOME SO UNDS, of his fixed on aunt Fanny's face all the time there, before every body, and the big dog, too, with his nose half buried in the tufted lamb on the hearth rug, and his tail wrapped around him to keep it out of the range of aunt Ray's feet, winking at her so knowingly, as if he knew well enough what it was all about, and was enjoying his own meditations at her expense. Of course it won't interest the reader to know the nature of our frolics that evening, nor how I threw myself into uncle Ray's arms to capture the yellow handkerchief, nor how we both tipped over in the big chair, nor how we all laughed, as if there never was and never would be any thing half so funny again, nor how we played " blind man's buff," nor how -Charlie Ray wouldn't catch any body but aunt Fanny, though we tumbled into his arms a dozen times, nor how the big dog ranted around the room as if he was somebody, which he wasn't, nor how uncle Ray victimized us all when he had a pawn io pay, nor how aunt Ray wouldn't compromise her dignity by a laugh, nor how Bell Mason sung "Over the river to Charlie," for us to dance by, nor what a very peculiar pigeon wing uncle Ray cut, nor how he fell down the very first dance, and, of course, a dozen scape- graces over him; no, indeed. In this age of refinement no- body would believe that such things. ever did occur, even in that country of questionable locality, away down east; so I shall just keep such knowledge to myself--only premising that before the scent of flowers had passed away on the au- tumn air, aunt Fanny had changed her situation, but not her name. .In a little white cottage, that can admire itself the year round in that looking glass of a Kennebec River, may be seen innumerable rays--chips of the old block--flitting around like runaway sunbeams, making brightness for them- selves and for every body else.   OR THE WORLD  FROM IMY WINDOW.    279 "Mamma,' said a pocket edition of Charlie Ray to aunt Fanny, on the occasion of my first visit for many years, "mamma, isn't this the cousin Malarion that grandpa tells about, who played you such a trick in the woods?" "You mustn't mind every thing grandpa said," replied Fanny, coloring to the roots of her hair with confusion. "You are not busy now, mamma, so tell me all about it; you promised you would some time when you were not busy." '"Do be quiet, Charlie," whispered Fanny.  "But you promised, you know, and you have always told me it was wicked to break a promise," persisted the little tormentor. "I do believe I've left the cakes in the oven," exclaimed aunt Fanny, springing up. "There, ask cousin Marion; she'll tell you all about it, with heir own additions at that. She's turned out a regular story-teller since that time;" and with a laugh and a blush which reminded me of the old even- ing in the forest, she glided out of the room, and was soon su- perintending the mystery of pies and cakes in the kitchen, like a darling, practical little housekeeper, as'she was. That hint about the story-teller determined me to punish her sauciness by making a heroine of her.; and if this sketch should ever come under the range of her merry eyes, I have only to say, that I shall be on hand next summer for that ducking in the Kennebec, which was to be my reward of merit if I dared do any thing so absurd as to write aunt Fanny Ray into a story. Dear aunt Fanny, 41ow I should like to see you just about now, while you are reading this leaf from life, and hear your half-loving, half-petulant, "Pshaww--that saucy Marion; there isn't a word of truth in it."

"After the mischief's done," you would say, with your lips all of a pout, like a couple of rosebuds. Then that perfection of an uncle Charlie would come in and pronounce it the best joke of the season, and so I should escape the ducking, after all. O, dear! I hope I'm not boring people to death with my aunt Fanny. Do, good Mr. Editor, make a bow for me, a la militaire, and tell your readers I am so fond of looking up these little do. mestic dashes, that I'm dreadfully afraid I should be tempted to sacrifice even their patience and good nature to my indom- itable love for material of home manufacture. I leave my pleading in your hands. TO ONE WHO HAS SAID, "DO WRITE OF LOVE." A PRETTY task my lady-bird Has set for prosy me! "Do write of love!" as if my muse Could talk of love like thee.

I had always -a distaste for these inveterat beggars, and you may judge that I was not over well pleasec on returning from a stroll one evening, to find in my room comfortably ensconced in a rocking chair, with one little dirtj foot drawn up under her, upon the cushion, one of the mos troublesome of her class-a girl whose bright, saucy fac had  made its appeal under my window, until I became somewhat interested in her. I had seen her one moment grateful almost to servility, the next passionately defiant, and as I stood gazing upon her slumbers, there wals something in her face so touchingly sorrowful, that the intended chiding was quite charmed away. A glimmering-of sunlight fell thin and brokenly across the street, and lay like a halo upon the tan- gled head, and the deep respiration told how much need the little wanderer had of rest. In a moment more the great black eyes were distended with an alarmed look, but with the quick perception of her craft, she saw there was no danger to fear, and murmuring, "I was so tired -so tired," prepared to leave the room. For the first time I observed a flush upon her cheek, too deep for the hue of health, and investing what change I could spare, told her to play no more that even- ing, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing her rounding the corner of the street leading to her home. For many even- ings after, "The old Folks at Home" drew all the dirty boys   OR THE WORLD FRO M MY WINDOW.      283 and girls in the neighborhood to my window. At length a week passed, and still another, without our accustomed visit, and I resolved to seek the truant, whom I had really begun to like. The alley was desolate, the cabin was desolate, and the old woman's heart must have been more desolate than all the rest. That old glance of passionate defiance, which I had seen upon the girl's face, flashed over the mother's as I approached. I told her my errand, and asked to see little Elspy. She did not speak, but led the way to an inner room, where the darkness was so intense that I feared for every step I took. As the door opened, a gleam of sunlight shot in and fell across the bed, revealing a little pale face, and a pair of tiny hands crossed upon the breast, as if their owner had just settled into slumber. There was not much to tell, for poverty is a strong bar against romance. She had never been well- -had been too much exposed-had toiled fill she could toil no long- er, and there was an end of it. As the mother folded away the shroud from her face, the sunlight shifted and fell in a broken ray upon her head. Twice I had seen her sleeping in that light, - once in my own room, to waken again to the cares and toils of life, and here upon the bed of death, to slum- ber on in quiet forever and evermore!

"I love to love," said a darling pet, Whose soul looked out through her eyes of jet; And she nestled down, like a fondled dove, And lisped, "Dear mamma, how I love to love!" "I love to love," said a maiden bright, And her words gushed forth like a stream of light, And thrilled to the heart of a, suppliant there, With a ripple soft as an angel's prayer.

"I love to love," said a mother blest, As she pressed the soft cheek to her yearning breast; And she thought, as she smoothed its silken hair, That nothing on earth could be half so fair. And thus, as we sail o'er the ocean of life, Love pours out its oil on the tempest of strife; And swiftly our bark nears the haven above, With something to hope for, and something to love.

It was a rash, wicked thought, which had been lying in that neglected wife's heart until it had gained strength, and found utterance, and goaded her on to almost desperate resolves! It was a cold, bitter night, and the few embers on the hearth had long since sent up their last sparkle, and now lay in a gray, heavy mass, like the wild hopes which had been impulses in the heart-of her who was mistress of that poverty-stricken abode. The crac- kling of her husband's step was scarcely lost in the distance, -when she sat down by the single window their room afforded, and leaning her head upon the sill, looked vacantly out upon the thousand happy homes, lying all asleep in the bright moonlight. "' Home, sweet home!" what was it to her that she had laid her heart upon a human altar, and it had crumbled beneath her affection! What was it to her that the sun of intellect -- his intellect, which she had so worshipped - had gone down in a night of hopeless dissipation! Daily repin- ings, incessant reproaches, perpetual taunts- did she pause to think how greatly these simple things had widened the chasm opening forever between two hearts that had cherished the dear words, " till death do us part"? No, nothing of this! She only knew home was a mockery to -her, love a thing of the past, and happiness only a name; and so the bitter thought came up to her lip, and found utterance in the fearful words, "I wish he was dead- I do!"

After depositing him on the sofa, as if he had been a valuable Shanghae e,. she took his great, clumsy hands in hers, and rubbed them, and blew her breath away to warm them! After settling that to her satisfaction, and finding that he, unused to luxury, had taken it easy and gone to sleep, she unburdened his feet, and wrapping them in her warm shawl, stole her arim under his head, and sat down by him to watch his slumber.

After that there was a long conference; but What she said to him, or what he said to her, I don't know; I only know that from that day he never got tipsy, and she never wished he was dead; and when the story was told to me the other evening, by one of the principals, with the admonition to bear and forbear, I thought it would not only bear repeating, but be a good lesson for the perusal of the world in general, and married people in particular!
