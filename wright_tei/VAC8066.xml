DAUGHTER&#xD;
&#xD;
OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
ENmEED, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1873,&#xD;
By 0. APPLETON &amp;amp; CO.,&#xD;
In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Wasblngtofl.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
"Ah, wsstelbl woman, she who may&#xD;
On her sweet self set her own price,&#xD;
Knowing he cannot choose but pay,&#xD;
How has she cheapened paradise;&#xD;
How given for naught her priceless gift;&#xD;
How spoiled the bread and spilled the wine,&#xD;
Which, spent with due respective thrift,&#xD;
Had made brutes men, and men divine I,'&#xD;
ON one of the most quiet and deeply-&#xD;
shaded of the.shaded streets which are the&#xD;
boast of the pleasant Southern city of Alton,&#xD;
stands a handsome double house with a por'&#xD;
tico in front, and wide piazzas on' the side,&#xD;
running the whole length of the building,&#xD;
and overlooking a flower-garden of consider-&#xD;
able extent and great beauty.&#xD;
Opening by French windows upon the&#xD;
lower of these piazzas is the breakfast-room,&#xD;
into which, on a certain bright morning of&#xD;
May-the 5Th of the month, if any one likes&#xD;
to be particular-roses of 'almost countless&#xD;
number and variety were sending their fra-&#xD;
grance, together with the buoyant air and&#xD;
golden sunshine. The breakfast-table, spread&#xD;
with delicate china and bright silver, occupied&#xD;
the centre of the floor; but, as 'yet no mem-&#xD;
jer of the household had made an appear-&#xD;
ance on the scene. Despite 'the fao~ that the&#xD;
sun had been abouL the business of lighting&#xD;
and warming the earth lQn~ euou~h, it seeme~l,&#xD;
to rouse all ~luggards from repose; despite&#xD;
the impatience of 'the cook, whose mtz~n~&#xD;
were hopelessly falling, or the gF~omy face of&#xD;
the footman, who held pminctualUy to be a&#xD;
cardinal virtue in masters and mistresses,&#xD;
&#xD;
the clock chimed half-past nine beforee the&#xD;
first step.±~.a leisurely, creaking, somewhat&#xD;
important step--was heard descending the&#xD;
broad, shallow staircase.&#xD;
"I'm blest Ii' there isn't master at last I"&#xD;
said Robert; sardonically. "A nice tisn~ for&#xD;
a man what' calls 'himself a busbies -~~sn&#xD;
to be comm' down to breakfast? N~ t~as&#xD;
the cook expressed her an4ety an~w~vit~i re-&#xD;
gard to the ira~ifflns-J~ I ain't a-~oiz' to take&#xD;
up the' things till they riuig1, for 'em~ He&#xD;
won't want h~s breakfast till som~.liody tomes&#xD;
down to keep him company; 'ba's on~ of&#xD;
the sociable kind whal don'tliko ~o eat by&#xD;
hisself."'&#xD;
The gentleman thus characterized mean-&#xD;
while entered the breakfast-~oQm, newspaper&#xD;
in hand and eye-glass on nose.' "Afii~e4ook-&#xD;
ing, portly gentleman?" was tl~e us~ial' popn.&#xD;
lar verdict on Mr. Middletou; and, for once,&#xD;
the popular verdict was an eintz~uItl~ 4list&#xD;
one., He stood six feet in the' ela~xi~tely-&#xD;
worked slippers which lie were, and, which&#xD;
were innocent of hee1s~ while I~ig size ws~ iii&#xD;
proportion to 'his height. He b~d a fresE,&#xD;
ruddy complexion, ivell-cut features of the&#xD;
nondescript kind, which we se~ on n~nety-&#xD;
nine American faces ~ut of a hunxWedand&#xD;
keen, brown eyes, with a fia~h ~f huniov liz&#xD;
them. Add to this his br9wn'hs~trt~nlng&#xD;
gray, and 1his brown whiskers, worn ~&#xD;
~daiee, and you have a pf&amp;amp;ur~ of the man as&#xD;
he sat down' by one of the open wis~do4~, and&#xD;
began to glance over the wsjaperwhlle he&#xD;
w~t~d for the appearance ef"iorne:fea~1ixlne&#xD;
b~4y who could pous~ out his edfee'an~ijgWo&#xD;
a friendly countenance to the' em~t~ table,&#xD;

4                        A UAU~.tL1±J~An 'I&#xD;
Robert having been right in saying that he&#xD;
was a sociable man, who did not like to take r&#xD;
his breakfast alone.&#xD;
lie had not long to wait. Before the a&#xD;
clock over the mantel had chimed another h&#xD;
quarter, a lighter, step was heard descending e&#xD;
the staircase, and the sweep of a feminine&#xD;
dress sounded across the hall. A minute c&#xD;
later a Blender, graceful woman of middle&#xD;
age entered the room-a woman who had ~&#xD;
probably never been pretty, but who had a&#xD;
plainly always been distinguished-looking, and&#xD;
under whose manner of well.brcd repose a&#xD;
great deal of nervous force was latent. She I&#xD;
wore a becoming trifle of a morning-cap on&#xD;
her glossy, dark hair, and was dressed in that&#xD;
sheer, crisp lawn which inspires such refresh- I&#xD;
ing thoughts of coolness on a warm summer&#xD;
morning, so that, despite the fact of his hay-&#xD;
ing been kept waiting for at least ten min-&#xD;
utes, Mr. Middleton smiled as he looked at her.&#xD;
"We are all rather late this morning,"&#xD;
said he. "I am afraid an engagement in the&#xD;
house does not agree with us."&#xD;
"Do you think the engagement has any&#xD;
thing to do with our being late?" asked Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton, as she moved across the room and&#xD;
touched a bell, which announced that break-&#xD;
fast might b~ brought up. "I am late be-&#xD;
cause I scarcely slept at all last night; and,&#xD;
after unusual wakefulness, one is apt to fall&#xD;
asleep rather heavily in the morning."&#xD;
"And what was the reason of the unusual&#xD;
wakefulness?" asked her husband. "Rave&#xD;
you never heard of such a thing as cause and&#xD;
effect? I think it probable that you would&#xD;
have slept quite as well as usual if I.~eslie had&#xD;
not come back from her ride yesterday even-&#xD;
ing and informed us that she was engaged to&#xD;
Mr. Tyndale."&#xD;
"Of course, I thought of Leslie," said the&#xD;
lady, deprecatingly. "Row could I help think-&#xD;
ing of her when we are obliged to face-so&#xD;
unexpectedly, too-the necessity of giving her&#xD;
up?"&#xD;
"It ought not to have been unexpected to&#xD;
you. Women generally see such things even&#xD;
before they exist."&#xD;
"They must be very clever women, then,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Middleton, with a~ laugh. "I am&#xD;
not a very clever woman, you know, and I am&#xD;
usually content with seeing them when they&#xD;
do exist. I cannot understand my blindness&#xD;
in this instance," she went on, shAking her&#xD;
head as if in rebuke of her own stupidity,&#xD;
&#xD;
MISS GRARAME'S ENGAGEMENT. .&#xD;
&#xD;
unless my state of false security was the&#xD;
action from the nervous suspicion with&#xD;
rhich. I viewed all of Leslie's admirers when&#xD;
he first entered society. I thought every&#xD;
imb a wolf then; and, when the wolf really*&#xD;
ame, I thought him a lamb."&#xD;
"You might have known that this would&#xD;
ome to pass some time, however."&#xD;
"or course I knew it; but I hoped-well,&#xD;
~ou know wbat I hoped. That is all over&#xD;
iow," said she, sitting down, with a sigh;&#xD;
'and I suppose there is nothing for it but to&#xD;
LIlOW her to marry the man with whom she&#xD;
ma fallen in love."&#xD;
"If1you are laying that down as a general&#xD;
n4nciplc," said Mr. Middleton, "I must say&#xD;
~hat I disagree with you. Because Leslie falls&#xD;
in love with a man is no reason whatever for&#xD;
allowing her to marry him - if he should&#xD;
chance to be an undesirable person."&#xD;
"But Arthur Tyndale is not an undesir-&#xD;
able person," said Mrs. Middleton, in a dis-&#xD;
tinctly aggrieved tone.&#xD;
"I did not say that he was," replied her&#xD;
husband. "It was only the general principle&#xD;
to which I objected. Girls are not exactly&#xD;
famous for wisdom of matrimonial choice."&#xD;
"Foolish girls make foolish choices," said&#xD;
the lady, sententiously. "But not girls like&#xD;
our Leslie."&#xD;
"Do you think our Leslie has made a&#xD;
very wise one?" asked Mr. Middleton, sig-&#xD;
nificantly.&#xD;
"I am as sorry as possible that she has&#xD;
made any at all," was the quick reply; "but,&#xD;
as far as the choice itself is concerned, I do&#xD;
not think that it is possible to call it an un.&#xD;
wise one. At least it would be difficult to&#xD;
find an objection to Arthur Tyndale. I know&#xD;
nothing whatever to be said against him."&#xD;
(This in a tone which left a decided impres-&#xD;
sion that the speaker would have been glad&#xD;
if there kad been something to say against&#xD;
him.)&#xD;
"Nor for him!" added her husband, dry.&#xD;
ly. "It is a very great mistake to suppose&#xD;
that a character is admirable when it is mere-&#xD;
ly made up of negatives," he went on, after a&#xD;
short pause. "There are positive virtues, as&#xD;
well as positive vices. Because young Tyn-&#xD;
dale has none of the last, is no earthly reason&#xD;
for taking for granted that of necessity he&#xD;
has all of the first. I don't like him!" he&#xD;
ended, shortly.. "There's not the stuff in him&#xD;
I hoped to find in Leslie's husband."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I think you underrate him," said Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton, in that tone of painful candor&#xD;
with which we bear unwilling testimony to&#xD;
the good name of a person whom privately&#xD;
we have strong reasons for disapproving.&#xD;
"lie is young, well-born, and wealthy-peo-&#xD;
pIe might well think us very unreasonable&#xD;
not to be satisfied; and yet I had so set my&#xD;
heart on Carl-"&#xD;
"Confound Carl I" interrupted Mr. Mid-&#xD;
dieton, irritably. It was not often that he&#xD;
was betrayed into so much heat of expres-&#xD;
sion; but, as he flung his paper aside impa-&#xD;
tiently, it was impossible not to think that he&#xD;
would have liked to fling it at the head of the&#xD;
absent Carl. "What the fellow is doing I&#xD;
can't tell I" he went on, walking to the table&#xD;
and sitting down. "Re certainly pays very&#xD;
little attention to my wishes or requests for&#xD;
his return."&#xD;
"The loss is his!" said Mrs. Middleton-&#xD;
and, as she drew herself up, her color rose.&#xD;
"But the annoyance is ours!" returned&#xD;
her husband, shortly. "I shall have all the&#xD;
vexation of making a will, of dividing and de-&#xD;
ciding about my property-pahaw! Give me&#xD;
a cup of coffee, and let me get down to the&#xD;
bank and drive all this worry out of my&#xD;
head!"&#xD;
The coffee, which had made its appearance&#xD;
by this time, was poured out, and, while Mr.&#xD;
Middleton received his cup, a door opened&#xD;
and closed in the upper regions of the house,&#xD;
a fresh young voice was heard singing several&#xD;
bars of a song, a pair of high French heels&#xD;
came with a quick patter down the staircase,&#xD;
the rustle of soft drapery swept across the&#xD;
hall, and into the breakfast-room entered a&#xD;
slender, graceful girl, with one of those fair,&#xD;
high -bred faces, which instinctively remind&#xD;
one of a white rose.&#xD;
"Good - morning, uncle," she said, drop-&#xD;
ping a light kiss on the top of Mr. Middleton's&#xD;
head-where there was a considerable bald&#xD;
spot-as she passed on her way to her own&#xD;
seat. "Row nice and cool you look!" she&#xD;
went on, scanning him with critical approval&#xD;
as she sat down. "I certainly do like to&#xD;
see men wear linen in summer.-Thanks, yes,&#xD;
auntie-coffee, if you please. I have seen&#xD;
yeas before this morning, have I not?"&#xD;
"I was in your room an hour ago," said&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton; "but I scarcely fancied that&#xD;
you saw me. You seemed fast asleep just&#xD;
then."&#xD;
&#xD;
K&#xD;
&#xD;
"There you were mistaken," said Leslie.&#xD;
"I heard you ask Maria how I had slept-as&#xD;
if Maria knew 1"&#xD;
"I was afraid you might have been fever.&#xD;
ish from having been naught in the rain yes.&#xD;
terday afternoon."&#xD;
"There was scarcely rain enough to wet a&#xD;
pocket-handkerchief," said the young lady,&#xD;
"and Mr. Tyndale insisted on our riding so fast&#xD;
that wedid not have time to get wet. It was&#xD;
delightful, but rather breathless !-I began to&#xD;
feel as if I might emulate the accomplished&#xD;
Dazzle, who could ride any thing, from a&#xD;
broomstick to a flash of lightning, you&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"I suppose it ~did not occur to Mr. Tyn-&#xD;
dale that your horse might have taken fright&#xD;
and broken your neck," said Mr. Middleton,&#xD;
dryly.&#xD;
"Perhaps he looked upon it in the light&#xD;
of a neck which he had a right to break,"&#xD;
answered Leslie, composedly. "At least I&#xD;
had told him a short time before that he&#xD;
might have it if he chose."&#xD;
"I don't think he need have been in quite&#xD;
such a haste for all that," retorted 'her uncle.&#xD;
"Time enough for murder after matrimony."&#xD;
Leslie laughed - it is easy to laugh at&#xD;
even the poorest jest when one is young and&#xD;
happy, and the world seems absolutely over.&#xD;
flowing with snnshine-and when she laughed,&#xD;
she looked, if possible, prettier than before.&#xD;
Animation was especially becoming to her&#xD;
face, for it waked all manner of entrancing&#xD;
dimples around her mouth, deepened the deli-&#xD;
cate flush on her cheeks, and kindled a bright&#xD;
gleam in her soft gray eyes. She was a charm-&#xD;
ingly harmonious creature, with an aroma&#xD;
of unconscious refinement about her. Not a&#xD;
line-and-measure beauty, by any means. Not&#xD;
a woman who could defy criticism, or serve&#xD;
under any circumstance as a model for a&#xD;
sculptor. Many a painter, however, might&#xD;
have been glad of such a study as she made,&#xD;
sitting there in the fresh glory of her youth,&#xD;
with a ray of sunlight brightening the silken&#xD;
meshes of her brown hair, and touching with&#xD;
a pencil of light her pure white brow, over&#xD;
which a few light soft tresses wandered free.&#xD;
"A born child of prosperity," almost any&#xD;
one would have said, looking at her, and yet&#xD;
-although life had from her early childhood&#xD;
been a very fair and picasant thing to Leslie&#xD;
Grahame-ahe had not, strictly speaking, been&#xD;
born to the gifts of fortune which she had&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="6-7" xml:id="VAC8066-00000004"/>&#xD;
6                        A 'VAUIJfl1~d~&#xD;
enjoyed. Her eyes had first opened upon a&#xD;
very different - prospect indeed - the more&#xD;
common prospect of those thorny by-ways&#xD;
and toilsome paths of poverty which are in-&#xD;
tensified in bitterness by memories of gentle&#xD;
rearing and the consciousness of gentle birth.&#xD;
Her father-Mrs. Middleton's only brother-&#xD;
had been a cavalry-officer, who lost his life in&#xD;
a fight with the Comanehes in Texas, Her&#xD;
mother was a weak and foolish woman, who,&#xD;
being little more than a girl at the time of&#xD;
thisevent, cried herself sick in the first two&#xD;
weeks of her "bereavement," then wiped&#xD;
away her tears with the facility of a child,&#xD;
and very soon married again in a manner cal-&#xD;
culatedto draw down upon herself the condem-&#xD;
nation of society and the indignant reprehen.&#xD;
sion of all her friends. These friends, who&#xD;
had objected to her first husband on the score&#xD;
of that impecuniosity which seems to attend&#xD;
the profession of arms in all countries and at&#xD;
all times, felt themselves deeply outraged by&#xD;
this second choice, which quite dwarfed the&#xD;
foolish romance that had made a silly school-&#xD;
girl elope with a penniless soldier. Their re.&#xD;
monstrances, however, were heeded as re-&#xD;
monstrances usually are when those who&#xD;
utter them have only power to-remonstrate.&#xD;
The young widow persisted in bestowing her&#xD;
heart and band upon a plausible, handsome&#xD;
adventurer, of whose antecedents no one&#xD;
knew any thing, and whose habits of life&#xD;
were notoriously disreputable. That he was&#xD;
an Irishman, a slight accent-it could scarce-&#xD;
ly have been called a brogue-betrayed to&#xD;
Anglo - Saxon ears. But, further than that,&#xD;
even gossip was unable to penetrate, for he&#xD;
was only temporarily living in America when&#xD;
he met Mrs. Grahame. Why he married her&#xD;
is one of the mysteries which are beyond the&#xD;
ken of men or angels to fathom; but it is&#xD;
likely that, with an interesting widow in deep&#xD;
crape, he associated some substantial expec-&#xD;
tations-destined, if so, to vanish into the&#xD;
thinnest of thin air. Why she married kim,&#xD;
requires no explanation, for she was one of&#xD;
those women who seem born t~o do fodlish&#xD;
things from their cradles to their graves, and&#xD;
was, besides, of the large class to whom a&#xD;
husband is a sin~ple necessity of life. Im-&#xD;
mediately after their marriage, Mr. Desmond&#xD;
(such was the gentleman's well sounding&#xD;
name) took his wife abroad-the continent of&#xD;
Europ~being then, as now; the grand resort&#xD;
of all Bohemians of his. class-insisting, how~&#xD;
&#xD;
A TROUBLESOME REQUEST.                    7&#xD;

A Tr~rfm1~1. f~i~ ntATT1~~fY A&#xD;
DVflJ~ilLL~&#xD;
&#xD;
ever, that she should leave behind the child&#xD;
of her first marriage. She made little demur&#xD;
to this peremptory demand. Mrs. Middle.&#xD;
ton, who had been married several years, was&#xD;
very glad to adopt the little waif~ and, with a&#xD;
tempest of weak tears, the mother parted from&#xD;
her child-as it chanced, forever.&#xD;
For, of course, she never returned. Two&#xD;
children were born abroad, and then, worn&#xD;
out by the vicissitudes of a wandering, shift.&#xD;
ing life, all prettiness gone from her face,&#xD;
all health from her body, all strength (if such&#xD;
a thing had ever existed) from her mind, the&#xD;
poor, faded wreck bowed her head and died.&#xD;
She had kept up a sort of straggling corre-&#xD;
spondence with little Leslie-to whom, in her&#xD;
bright, luxurious home, "mamma" was the&#xD;
dimmest of dim memories-but her other re.&#xD;
nations had long since dropped all communi-&#xD;
cation with her, and there was no one to care&#xD;
particularly when a foreign letter sealed with&#xD;
black came to Mr. Middleton, in which Mr.&#xD;
Desmond informed him that Mrs. Desmond&#xD;
had died on a certain day of a certain month&#xD;
at Coblentz.on-the.Rhine. Mr. Middleton ac-&#xD;
knowledged the receipt of this information by&#xD;
a business-like letter, remarkable only for its&#xD;
brevity; and the result on Leslie's life con-&#xD;
sisted in the fact that, for several months,&#xD;
she was reluctantly compelled to wear black&#xD;
sashes with her white frocks.&#xD;
By the time this young lady grew up,&#xD;
everybody had quite forgotten the poor, fool-&#xD;
ish woman safely laid to rest in her foreign&#xD;
grave. Miss Grahame was a beauty-accord~&#xD;
ing to the not very high popular standard of&#xD;
beauty-an heiress, and a very bright~ pleas-&#xD;
ant girl besides, so it was ~ot wonderful that&#xD;
she made quite a success at her first appear-&#xD;
ance in society. It was not a success which&#xD;
diminished, either-as successes often do-&#xD;
when season after season rolled away, and the&#xD;
pretty belle remained certainly not unsought,&#xD;
yet assuredly unwon. Perhaps there was&#xD;
safety of heart and fancy in the multitude of&#xD;
her admirers; or perhaps she felt an obliga-&#xD;
tion to brighten, for a few years of her youth,&#xD;
the kind home that had sheltered her child'&#xD;
hood. It is to her credit that Leslie laid&#xD;
much stress on the latter consideration; yet&#xD;
it is likely enough that, if she had ever been&#xD;
seriously "interested," as old-fashioned peo-&#xD;
ple saythis obligation would have shared the&#xD;
fate that such obligations mostly do when&#xD;
opposed to the master-passion of mankind.&#xD;
&#xD;
However this might be, the fact remained the&#xD;
same. Suitors came and suitors went, but&#xD;
Leslie shook her head and said them nay,&#xD;
until one came to whom the girl's. heart sur-&#xD;
rendered with all the more abandon that it&#xD;
had held out stoutly for so long.&#xD;
Why this desirable person, against whom&#xD;
nothing could be said, was not so fortunate&#xD;
as to secure the approval of the guardians as&#xD;
well as the heart of the lady, may be ex-&#xD;
plained in the fact that his wooing and suc-&#xD;
cess had knocked over, like a house of cards,&#xD;
a very pretty little plan which the Middletons&#xD;
had erected for their own present and future&#xD;
satisfaction. Seeing Leslie remain fancy free&#xD;
so long, these good people had been tempted&#xD;
to think what a pleasant thing for them it&#xD;
would be if they could only keep her with&#xD;
them altogether, and, as the best means of&#xD;
attailiing this desired end, they thought of&#xD;
one Carl Middleton-a nephew of the banker&#xD;
-who had been educated abroad, but was&#xD;
shortly expected home-who should, indeed,&#xD;
have been at home considerably before this&#xD;
time. Of course, he could not but fall in love&#xD;
with Leslie-so Mrs. Middleton argued, in the&#xD;
partial fondness of her heart-and, being a&#xD;
frank, pleasant young fellow, with his due&#xD;
share of the Middleton good looks, it was&#xD;
likely enough that Leslie might fall in love&#xD;
with him, in which ease it was a long and&#xD;
happy vista that opened before the astute&#xD;
match-maker's eyes. It ~vill be seen what a&#xD;
bomb-shell to the foundations of this castle&#xD;
in Spain Arthur Tyadale had proved; and&#xD;
also why Mr. and Mrs. Middleton. were not&#xD;
properly grateful to Providence for the many&#xD;
worldly advantages that surrounded Miss&#xD;
Grahame's fortunate suitor.&#xD;
After Mr. Middleton's last remark, there&#xD;
was silence round the breakfast - table for&#xD;
some time. They tried to look and seem as&#xD;
usual, but there was an uncomfortable sense&#xD;
of constraint about them. They each felt, in&#xD;
a different way, that the golden charm of&#xD;
home had been broken-how much or how&#xD;
little no one could tell-that a jarring ele-&#xD;
ment had entered their life, and that, what-&#xD;
ever the future might hold for them, the fair,&#xD;
serene past had ended yesterday. There&#xD;
never were people who, in their domestic&#xD;
life, were more at ease with each other, and&#xD;
it was strange to see how they hesitated just&#xD;
now-each seeming in doubt what to say.&#xD;
Finally, Mr. Middleton spoke again:&#xD;
&#xD;
"I suppose, Leslie, that I shall see Tyn.&#xD;
dale some time this morning?"&#xD;
"He said he would certainly see you,"&#xD;
Leslie answered, coloring a little, but other.&#xD;
wise preserving that composure which she&#xD;
had been taught to observe as one of the&#xD;
chief duties of life.&#xD;
"And what am I to tell him?" asked her&#xD;
uncle half jestingly, yet with a certain amount&#xD;
of tenderness in his keen, brown eyes.&#xD;
"Just what you please, I am' sure," an-&#xD;
swered Miss Grahame, quietly. "I told him&#xD;
yesterday all that mattered very much."&#xD;
"So he merely comes to me as a matter&#xD;
of complimentary form?"&#xD;
"Not exactly tlmt. Of course, he knows&#xD;
that. my consent is worth nothing without&#xD;
yours; but then he must also know that ob-&#xD;
jection is out of the question as far as ho is&#xD;
concerned. There is not a flaw to be found&#xD;
in Arthur," added the young lady, proudly.&#xD;
"Well, that is going rather far," said her&#xD;
uncle. "Objection may be out of the ques-&#xD;
tion," he added, reluctantly, "but I would&#xD;
not advise you to make a demi-god of him on&#xD;
that account, my dear. Be content that he&#xD;
is a very clever young fellow, as men go-but&#xD;
with plenty of flaws, you may he sure, when&#xD;
you come to know him. And so" (his voice&#xD;
changing a little), "you are really going to&#xD;
leave us ?-we are really to lose our little&#xD;
girl!"&#xD;
"0 uncle, don't-don't make me cry I"&#xD;
pleaded Leslie, with something like a gasp&#xD;
in her throat, and a tremulous, beseeching&#xD;
glance in her eyes. "I made up my mind&#xD;
this morning that I would not be sentimental&#xD;
or foolish, and that I would look at things&#xD;
from a practical, common-sense point of view.&#xD;
There is nothing whatever to be melancholy&#xD;
about. People are married every day."&#xD;
"That is very true," said Mr. Middleton,&#xD;
"and, according to the same argument, a&#xD;
good many of them die, too; but somehow&#xD;
we don't get used to It."&#xD;
"0 George!" cried his wife, "what a com-&#xD;
parison!"&#xD;
"I am trying to teach Leslie logic, my&#xD;
dear," said George. "You know I never&#xD;
succeeded in teaching it to you. it seems&#xD;
that it is a settled thing, then, that we are to&#xD;
kill the fatted calf," he went on rather hastily&#xD;
-perhaps to do away with the impression of&#xD;
his last remark. "Ihope; however, Tyndale&#xD;
doesn't mean to take possession ofyon at once,&#xD;

&#xD;
Leslie. He'll spare you to us for some time&#xD;
tocomeeh?"&#xD;
*   "I have not asked him any thing about&#xD;
it," answered Leslie; "but I shall not think&#xD;
of being married before the autumn. I "-&#xD;
here she hesitated a minute-.." I have been&#xD;
thinking of something that I should like to&#xD;
ask you, uncle-and you, aunt."&#xD;
"We are all attention," said Mr. Middle-&#xD;
ton, elevating his eyebrows as he glanced up,&#xD;
for such a grave preface was very unlike&#xD;
Leslie.&#xD;
"You may think it very foolish, and you&#xD;
may even think it very unreasonable," said&#xD;
Leslie, looking first at one and then at the&#xD;
other, "but, indeed, I have considered it&#xD;
seriously, and I should like it very mueji, if&#xD;
you have no objection."&#xD;
"My dear," said Mrs. Middleton, "you&#xD;
know that you could scarcely ask any thing&#xD;
which we would not be glad to grant. But,&#xD;
of course, we cannot know what you want&#xD;
unless you tell us."&#xD;
"No-of course not~" said Leslie, laugh.&#xD;
ing nervously. "The fact is," she continued,&#xD;
"I am afraid you will disapprove of my re.&#xD;
quest; but, indeed, I have set my beart on it.&#xD;
How stupid I am I" she went on with a burst&#xD;
of impatience. "I have made you think all&#xD;
sorts of things, when all that I want is to ask&#xD;
you if I may invite one of my sisters to come&#xD;
and see me."&#xD;
It certainly sounded like a~ moderate re.&#xD;
quest, yet one more astonishing, and, in fact,&#xD;
more dismaying, could scarcely have been&#xD;
made. Mr. and Mrs. Middleton looked at&#xD;
each other silently, while. Leslie- after a&#xD;
pause-continued:&#xD;
"You see I have thought so often of poor&#xD;
mamma and of the girls-my sisters---whom&#xD;
I have never known. Only the other day I&#xD;
was reading over mamma's letters, and my&#xD;
heart smote me to think what my life is and&#xD;
what theirs has doubtless been. Of course,&#xD;
I could do nothing for them while I had no&#xD;
home of my own; but-but I shall soon have&#xD;
that, and I should like to know something&#xD;
of them, so as to see how best to benefit&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"No home of your own, Leslie!', repeated&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton. "It seems to me that is a&#xD;
hard thing to say to us."&#xD;
"Dearest aunt, don't you understand I"'&#xD;
said the girl, earnestly. "What I mean is,&#xD;
that I could not ask you to take them as you&#xD;
&#xD;
'took me. You would have thought it only&#xD;
kindness to me to refuse. But, you see, my&#xD;
engagement seems such a good reason to offer&#xD;
for asking one of them to come, that I thought&#xD;
you would not mind it for a little while. We&#xD;
could see what she is like, you know, and-&#xD;
and if she is nice, I am sure it would be very&#xD;
pleasant for her to live with me until she&#xD;
married, or something of that kind."&#xD;
Again Mr. and Mrs. Middleton looked at&#xD;
each other-this time despairingly. They&#xD;
both saw plainly the nature of the plan which&#xD;
this foolish girl had been building, and they&#xD;
both saw, also, the hopelessness of opposing&#xD;
it. Still, in their different ways, each of them&#xD;
tried a little argument.&#xD;
"The idea is very natural, and does you&#xD;
~redit, my deat," said Mr. Middleton, "but I&#xD;
think you ought to consider that you may be&#xD;
preparing a great deal of trouble for yourself,&#xD;
by opening any closer communication with&#xD;
such-such people as those."&#xD;
"What kind of trouble?" asked Leslie.&#xD;
Mr. Middleton looked annoyed, and pushed&#xD;
his cup rather sharply away.&#xD;
"I thought you knew that your mother's&#xD;
second husband was an adventurer," he said.&#xD;
"Neither he nor his daughters are fit asso-&#xD;
ciate~ for you."&#xD;
"But I don't want to associate with him,"&#xD;
answered Leslie, simply; "and, as for his&#xD;
daughters, they are my sisters. I can't alter&#xD;
that fact, however much I neglect them.,&#xD;
And their father's character makes me all&#xD;
the more anxious to do something for' them."&#xD;
"But you may do yourself great injury,"&#xD;
urged Mrs. Middleton. "People who remem.&#xD;
ber your mother's second marriage will talk&#xD;
very disagreeably; and Mr. Tyndale may very&#xD;
naturally object to such a connection."&#xD;
Leslie drew herself up like a queen-her&#xD;
fair skin flushing with a tide of blood, which&#xD;
well deserved the poetic epithet of "gener.&#xD;
ous."&#xD;
"You are very kind to think of me as you&#xD;
always have done, auntie," she said; "but I&#xD;
care nothing for what other people may say;&#xD;
and, as for Arthur-he will not be likely to&#xD;
marry me unless he is willing to receive -my&#xD;
sisters into his house."&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton moved uneasily. Nothing&#xD;
could have been more trying to her than to&#xD;
see such an idea as this take possession of&#xD;
Leslie's mind.&#xD;
"My dear," she said, gravely, "can you&#xD;
&#xD;
nottrust your uncle and myself when we as-&#xD;
sure you that these are not people with whom&#xD;
you should burden your life? You have no&#xD;
idea what manner of man your mother's sec.&#xD;
ond husband was; and these girls are not&#xD;
only his daughters, but they have been his&#xD;
associates, and the associat~sof Ins associates,&#xD;
* for years. Leslie! promise me to give up&#xD;
such a foolish scheme."&#xD;
"J3ut," repeated Leslie, "they are my&#xD;
sisters. If I can save them from such a life,&#xD;
oughtlnotto do it?"&#xD;
"Not to the injury of your own life," an-&#xD;
swered her aunt, quickly.&#xD;
"My life is made," the girl returned, with&#xD;
the rash confidence of youth. "They might&#xD;
a noy, but they could not injure me; and an.&#xD;
~4 oyance I am ready to risk."&#xD;
I "But, my dear child-"&#xD;
"There! there!" broke in Mr. Middle.&#xD;
ton, impatiently, "don't you see that she has&#xD;
set her heart on it, and that no words are go.&#xD;
ing to do any good ?-You've spoiled her, Mil-&#xD;
dred~ now take the consequences, and write&#xD;
and ask the girl to come.-I suppose you&#xD;
don't want both of them?" (looking inter-&#xD;
rogatively at Leslie).&#xD;
"No," she answered; "I have thought it&#xD;
over, and decided that I should prefer the&#xD;
elder-the one who writes to me occasion.&#xD;
ally, and is nearest my age. Her name iS&#xD;
Norah-the other is Kate."&#xD;
"And it is Norah you want?" asked Mr.&#xD;
Middleton, in exactly the tone he might have&#xD;
employed if he had said, "And it is the bay&#xD;
horse you want?"&#xD;
"Yes, Norab, if she will come."&#xD;
"There is very little doubt of that," he&#xD;
said, grimly. "I only hope you may not wish&#xD;
the thing undone after it is irrevocably done,"&#xD;
he went on, as he rose to leave the room.&#xD;
"But you can write for her, and your aunt&#xD;
will write, too, no doubt. Meanwhile, I will&#xD;
go and read my paper till Tyndale comes. I&#xD;
hope he won't prove a laggard in his woo. I&#xD;
ing, for I have an appointment at the bank in&#xD;
an hour."&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
"This is her picture as she was:&#xD;
It seems a thing to wonder on,&#xD;
As though mine image in the glass&#xD;
Should tarry when.my~eif am gone."&#xD;
Mn, TY1~DALE did not prove a laggard in ~&#xD;
his wooing. Before Mr. Middleton had fin-&#xD;
&#xD;
ished his paper-in fact, before he had sue.&#xD;
needed in dismissing Leslie's troublesome re-&#xD;
quest from his mind, so as to satisfactorily&#xD;
master the rates of exchange and the politi-&#xD;
cal intelligencc-..the library-door opened, and&#xD;
a gentleman was ushered in by Robert, who&#xD;
knew the gentleman's business quite as well&#xD;
as he knew it himself. He was a handsome&#xD;
young man of six. or seven-and.twenty, fair-&#xD;
haired, and silken.mustached, with' a com-&#xD;
plexion like a girl's, violet eyes, and a slen-&#xD;
der, elegant figure, which he carried with re-&#xD;
markable grace~&#xD;
Mr. Middleton met him cordially. Be.&#xD;
cause Arthur Tyn4ale was not the husband&#xD;
whom he would have chosen for his pretty&#xD;
Leslie was no reason why the fortunate suitor&#xD;
should not receive at his hands all the consider.&#xD;
ation which was his due-and a good deal of&#xD;
consideration was esteemed in society Mr. Tyn-&#xD;
dale's due. He not only represented one of&#xD;
the oldest names in the State, but he had&#xD;
come into a large property at his majority,&#xD;
which, as yet, had been very moderately con-&#xD;
verted into ducks and drakes. Tempted, as&#xD;
few men are tempted, by the union of perfect&#xD;
liberty, wealth, and good looks, he had pre.&#xD;
served a very clear record-the record of a&#xD;
thorough-bred gentleman and an unexception-&#xD;
ably "good fellow"-in the face of the world;&#xD;
and, altogether, as Mr. Middleton had already&#xD;
admitted, with some degree of reluctance,&#xD;
there was nothing with which the most carp-&#xD;
ing guardian could possibly have found fault.&#xD;
No one was better aware of these facts than&#xD;
the gentleman himself, in consequence of&#xD;
which his manner was perhaps a little too&#xD;
well assured in preferring his suit. Not that&#xD;
he exhibited any offensive self-confidence-he&#xD;
had too much high-breeding for that-but he&#xD;
was not entirely successful in wholly banish.&#xD;
ing a certain consciousness of safety~ which&#xD;
was a trifle irritating to his companion. All&#xD;
objection being out of the question, however,&#xD;
bhe matter was soon settled, due congratula-&#xD;
~ions were uttered, hands were shaken, and&#xD;
.hen Mr. Tyndale was at liberty to betake&#xD;
*dmself to the drawing room, where Leslie.&#xD;
vas awaiting him.&#xD;
She was standing when he entered by&#xD;
~n open window, looking absently out over a&#xD;
~rcen square, in the tall trees of which a mul-&#xD;
itude of birds were singing, while children&#xD;
)layed and nurses gossiped along the shaded&#xD;
vaiks, and a stream of pedestrians passed&#xD;

THE PHOTOGRAPH.                   11&#xD;
&#xD;
10                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
continually through the wide iron gates.-&#xD;
Hearing his step, she turned, with something&#xD;
even brighter than the May sunshine on her&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"Is it all settled?" she asked, smiling,&#xD;
as he approached; for she knew perfectly&#xD;
well what his answer would be.&#xD;
"It is all settled," he answered, taking&#xD;
her into his arms and kissing her. "You are&#xD;
mine, Leslie!"&#xD;
"AmI?" asked Leslie, drawing back, as&#xD;
if half inclined to dispute the assertion. But&#xD;
then she laughed and yielded to his eager em-&#xD;
brace. "I believe I am," she said, answer-&#xD;
ing her own question with a slight sigh.&#xD;
"Are you sorry for it?" he asked, quickly.&#xD;
"Ah, Leslie, surely not! ~Surely you believe&#xD;
that nobody has ever loved you half so well&#xD;
as I! Wait until I have proved it to you;&#xD;
wait until I have put it tothe test and made&#xD;
you believe it by other signs than mere words;&#xD;
and then tell me, if you dare, that you are&#xD;
sorry for having come to me l"&#xD;
"Did I say I was sorry?" demanded Les-&#xD;
lie. "You should not take things so much&#xD;
for 'granted. If I sighed a little it was only&#xD;
because my freedom is the best thing I have&#xD;
ever possessed; and I don't like the thought&#xD;
of giving it up."&#xD;
"Do you think you will be giving it up&#xD;
to me?" he asked, smiling. "I think time&#xD;
will prove that you have only gained another&#xD;
slave."&#xD;
But, like a true daughter of Eve, Leslie&#xD;
shook her head.&#xD;
"Suppose I don't want another?" she&#xD;
said. "I have had slaves enough. By way&#xD;
of variety, I think I should like to be domi.&#xD;
needed over a little. Just a little, Arthur;&#xD;
not enough to be disagreeable."&#xD;
"I can safely promise that it will be ex~&#xD;
ceedinglylittle," said Tyndalelaughing. "You&#xD;
were born qucen-regnant, my Leslie, and so I&#xD;
think you will die. At least "-shrugging hii&#xD;
shoulders-" I am sure I have not the where&#xD;
withal to make a tyrant even of the mildesi&#xD;
type. My constitutional indolence rather in&#xD;
dines me to prefer being henpecked. Ii&#xD;
would be a pleasure to be put in leading&#xD;
strings by such fingers as these."&#xD;
He lifted her small, white, lissome hand~&#xD;
as he spoke, but before he could carry then&#xD;
to'his lips Leslie took them into her own pos&#xD;
session, and, placing one on each of his shoul&#xD;
ders, repeated, with a very gracious sweetness&#xD;
&#xD;
the charming words in which Portia makes&#xD;
her self-surrender:&#xD;
the full sum of me&#xD;
Is sum of something; which, to term in gross,&#xD;
Is an uniessoned girl, unschooled, unpractised:&#xD;
Happy In this, she Is not yet so old&#xD;
lint she may learn; and happier than this,&#xD;
She Is not bred so duilbut she can learn;&#xD;
Happiest of allis, that her gentle spirit&#xD;
Commits itself to yours to be directed,&#xD;
As from her lord, her governor, her king."&#xD;
What Tyndale's answer was, it is not diffi-&#xD;
cult to imagine. The lips which had uttered&#xD;
these words were very near his own, and he&#xD;
was' very much in love. In truth, it was a&#xD;
new side of her character which 'Leslie was&#xD;
showing him just now - a more charming&#xD;
side, he thought, than he had seen yet. She&#xD;
had not been won without difficulty-this&#xD;
fair, proud maiden-she was not a woman to&#xD;
drop like a ripe cherry into any man's hand;&#xD;
but he felt more than repaid for all that she&#xD;
had cost him as the fair, graceful head went&#xD;
down on his shoulder.&#xD;
But it is scarcely worth while to dwell on&#xD;
this part of the interview. Everybody agrees&#xD;
*in considering "engaged" people very tire-&#xD;
some. To the general mind there seems some-&#xD;
thing especially stupid in felicity which is ac-&#xD;
complished and secure. It is likely that we&#xD;
might even weary of Romeo and Juliet, of&#xD;
.3fax and Thekia, if the course of true love&#xD;
had, in either case, run smooth. The reader&#xD;
can afford to be patient, however, with the&#xD;
bit of tame happiness-undisturbed by doubt,&#xD;
untortured by agony-which has just been&#xD;
sketched. As far as one, at least, was con-&#xD;
cerned, it was very nearly the last of cloud-&#xD;
less sunshine.&#xD;
For, before long, Leslie began to bestow&#xD;
confidence and claim sympathy from her lover,&#xD;
on the score of her late discussion with her&#xD;
uncle and aunt. The matter was laid in all&#xD;
its bearings before him, and then she asked&#xD;
I pathetically if he thought she had been un-&#xD;
reasonable or unkind in pressing her point.&#xD;
Mr. Tyndale's reply was prompt and antis-&#xD;
- factory. He agreed with her in everything-&#xD;
though his sympathy partook largely of the&#xD;
- nature of a blind faith, since he evidently had&#xD;
~nceived only the vaguest possible idea of&#xD;
whole question. Step-sisters, were they?&#xD;
1 -no, half-sisters. Well, at all events, she&#xD;
- was perfectly right to do all she could for&#xD;
- them. As for their father being an adven-&#xD;
turer-what did that have to do with the&#xD;
&#xD;
matter!' A great many very good people had&#xD;
disreputable fathers; and, indeed, adventurers&#xD;
were sometimes amazingly pleasant fellows-&#xD;
Mr. Tyndale could certify to that from per-&#xD;
sonal knowledge. Besides, were not their&#xD;
friends the Middletons just a trifle narrow-&#xD;
minded and old - fashioned in their ideas?&#xD;
Perhaps the gentleman in question only lived&#xD;
rather a fast life, as gentlemen often did&#xD;
abroad - and at home, too, for that mat.&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
Leslie was much comforted by these lib-&#xD;
eral opinions; but over the latter theory she&#xD;
shook her head.&#xD;
"I am afraid the father is certainly a very&#xD;
dreadful person," she said; "but still, his&#xD;
daughters are my sisters, and I am so glad-&#xD;
so very glad-.-that you agree with me about&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"Of course I agree with you," said Mr.&#xD;
Tyndale, secretly a good deal bored, for he&#xD;
had not come to talk over disagreeable family&#xD;
questions with his pretty lady-love. "It is&#xD;
never good style to cut one's relations unless&#xD;
they are absolutely disgraceful. Now, these&#xD;
may be very charming girls, despite the fact&#xD;
of their father being a chevalier d'industrie-.-..&#xD;
for, I take it, from what you say, that is just&#xD;
about what he is. Fortunately, he is not re-&#xD;
lated to you, so it will be easy enough to drop&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"Oh, 'certainly," answered Leslie, hastily&#xD;
-having 'never had the least intention of tak-&#xD;
ing him up in the first instance. "It is such&#xD;
'a relief to find that you are not prejudiced, as&#xD;
some men would have been, Arthur," she&#xD;
went on. "Aunt Mildred really made me&#xD;
quite uneasy. She said you would be sure to&#xD;
object to such a connection."&#xD;
"My ilarling, a man who has seen as much&#xD;
of the world as I have has no prejudices,"&#xD;
said Mr. Tyndale, superbly. "And as to ob-&#xD;
jecting to the connection-I am afraid I&#xD;
should not be sufficiently orthodox to object&#xD;
to Old Nick, if I had to take him along with&#xD;
you.~~&#xD;
"I am very much obliged to you for the&#xD;
association of ideas."&#xD;
"I only wanted to put it as forcibly as&#xD;
possible. It would be hard lines if any of us&#xD;
were accountable for our relations-much less&#xD;
for anybody whom our relations may take it&#xD;
into their heads to marry! There never was&#xD;
.a man more cursed with disagreeable rela-&#xD;
tions than I have been," he pursued, frank-&#xD;
&#xD;
ly. "Except Max, I really don't'think there's&#xD;
a decent one among the whole rank and&#xD;
file."&#xD;
"But none of them are chevatier.s d'iadus-&#xD;
trie?"&#xD;
"No-they rather go in for the heavy,&#xD;
respectable line. But I have seen a good&#xD;
many ehevaliers d'industrie whom I would&#xD;
take, ten to one, so far as agreeable quali-&#xD;
ties go."&#xD;
"What a pity your friends could not hear&#xD;
you I" said Leslie, laughing. "Disagreeable&#xD;
relations must be exceedingly unpleasant,&#xD;
however. Fortunately, I have never been&#xD;
tried by them. I often wonder what my sis-&#xD;
ters are like," she we1nt on, musingly. "They&#xD;
may be nice-mamma came of very nice peo-&#xD;
pIe, you know. Then Norah's photograph is&#xD;
certainly very pretty. Don't you feel prepos-&#xD;
sessed toward pretty people? I always do.&#xD;
A pr~pos, I must showyou her photograph,&#xD;
and see what you think of it."&#xD;
"Never mind just now," said Tyndale,&#xD;
who, being comfortable, felt indolent. "I&#xD;
don't mean to be ungrateful-but you can&#xD;
show it to me any time, you know; and I care&#xD;
little for the photograph of any woman under&#xD;
the sun, while I have you beside me."&#xD;
"That is very complimentary," said Les-&#xD;
lie; "but still I want you to see Norah's&#xD;
likeness. You are one of the few people&#xD;
whose judgment I can trust with regard to&#xD;
beauty; and I think she is beautiful."&#xD;
"Is she?" asked he, carelessly. "Well,&#xD;
if it must bc-where is the picture?"&#xD;
"It is hanging in my room. Ring the&#xD;
bell, and I will send for it."&#xD;
Tyndale rang the bell; but, after a mes-&#xD;
sage had been dispatched by Robert to Miss&#xD;
Grahame's maid, he entered a feeling protest&#xD;
against the proceeding.&#xD;
"Cannot this wait?" he asked. "It is&#xD;
not often that Fate gives us such a happy hour&#xD;
as this-why should we bring the every-day&#xD;
things of life to jar upon it? Why can't we&#xD;
fancy ourselves in paradise or Arcadia, where&#xD;
sisters and step-fathers never come?"&#xD;
Some women would have been offended by&#xD;
the frankness of this speech; but Leslie only&#xD;
laughed-laughed and extended her'hand to&#xD;
Maria, who entered at that moment with a&#xD;
photograph mounted and framed in velvet and&#xD;
gilt.&#xD;
"I think the truth is, that you are terribly&#xD;
bored," she said, after the maid was gone.&#xD;

LESLIE'S SISTER.                    13&#xD;
&#xD;
12                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Still, if you desire it, we will not talk of the&#xD;
matter any more. But you must look at&#xD;
Norah's picture for all that."&#xD;
She held up the picture as she spoke, and&#xD;
bending slightly -for he was rather near-&#xD;
sighted-Arthur Tyndale saw the face stamped&#xD;
thereon with what Mr. Collins calls "the&#xD;
stern justice of photography."&#xD;
It was not a very stern justice in this in.&#xD;
stance; nor was it a face which, having seen&#xD;
once, any man would be likely to forget-and&#xD;
Tyndale, as it chanced, had cause to know it&#xD;
well. He was a man of. the world, and, ac-&#xD;
cording to the fashion of his class, had him-&#xD;
self pretty well in hand against awkward sur-&#xD;
prises; but the awkwardness-the terrible&#xD;
uneipectedness-of this, threw 'him complete-&#xD;
ly off his guard.&#xD;
"Good Heaven!" he said, before he knew&#xD;
what he was about. "Why, it is Norah Des-&#xD;
mond!"&#xD;
"What !-do you know her?" cried Les-&#xD;
lie, in uncontrollable amazement. "Of course,&#xD;
it is Norah-who else should it be? But do&#xD;
you know her, Arthur?"&#xD;
"Is siw your ~ asked Tyndale, hur-&#xD;
riedly-his fair skin several shades fairer&#xD;
than it had been the minute before. "She-&#xD;
this girl?"&#xD;
"Of course, she is my sister," repeated&#xD;
Leslie, more and more astonished. "Do you&#xD;
know her ?-have you seen her? You must&#xD;
have seen her to recognize her picture. But&#xD;
where was it? How strange it seems that you&#xD;
should know her!"&#xD;
"Yes-very strange!" said he, with lips'&#xD;
that slightly quivered. "But coincidences&#xD;
happen very often, you know, and-and you&#xD;
are sure there is no mistake, Leslie?" he&#xD;
cried, again. "You are sure this is the like-&#xD;
ness of your sister?"&#xD;
"What possible mistake could there be?"&#xD;
asked Leslie. "Norah sent mc the picture&#xD;
as her likeness. I have never seen her,&#xD;
however. 'If you have, you ought to know&#xD;
whether or not it is she."&#xD;
"Yes, it is she," he answered-looking at&#xD;
the pictured face before him, and, hating its&#xD;
brilliant fairness with all his heart, he still&#xD;
could not deny that it was she.&#xD;
"But you have not told me yet how you&#xD;
met her--or when-or where!" said Leslie,&#xD;
eagerly. "Of course, it must have been&#xD;
abroad; but tell me all about it. How strange&#xD;
it seems that you should have seen her and&#xD;
&#xD;
not know that she was my sister! Tell me all&#xD;
about it, Arthur!"&#xD;
"Don't be impatient," said 'he. "I-I&#xD;
will tell you." Then he stopped a second, as&#xD;
if to clear his throat, and reviewed the situa-&#xD;
tion in his mind. It was rather a desperate&#xD;
one; and, seeing only'a single avenue of es-&#xD;
cape, he determined to lie, with a readiness&#xD;
of resource which would have done credit to&#xD;
the hero of a French play. "It does not fol-&#xD;
low that I know Miss Desmond because I&#xD;
recognize her likeness," he went on. "Any&#xD;
man who has been to Baden-Baden, or to&#xD;
Homburg, might do that. She is somewhat&#xD;
of a celebrity at all those places."&#xD;
The significance of his tone was more&#xD;
marked than his words. The bright blood&#xD;
sprang into Leslie's face, and her eyes opened&#xD;
on him with a look for which he was not&#xD;
prepared-a look that almost made him sorry&#xD;
for having implied so much.&#xD;
"What do you mean?" asked she, some-&#xD;
what haughtily. "I confess I do not under-&#xD;
stand."&#xD;
"Don't look that way, my darling," he&#xD;
answered, hurriedly. "I only mean that-&#xD;
that Miss Desmond is a very fast woman.&#xD;
And that I was-that I am-exceedingly sur-&#xD;
prised to find that she is your sister."&#xD;
"Norah 1- are you sure it is Norah?"&#xD;
cried Leslie. And then-as she, too, felt that&#xD;
the face before her was not one to be mis-&#xD;
taken -" 0 Arthur, how sorry, how very&#xD;
sorry I am! But think what a training the&#xD;
poor girl has had!" the eager, loyal voice&#xD;
went on. "No mother, and such a fa-&#xD;
ther! Is it any wonder that she should&#xD;
be fast?"&#xD;
"I do not think that I have expressed any'&#xD;
wonder at the fact," said Mr. Tyndale, quite&#xD;
dryly.&#xD;
"I am so sorry!" Leslie repeated. For a&#xD;
minute she could say nothing more. Then&#xD;
she went on quickly-too much preoccupied&#xD;
to notice his face very closely - "I am so&#xD;
sorry, too, that you did not know her! You&#xD;
could have told me so much about her; and&#xD;
I feel as it' I should like to know something&#xD;
before she comes."&#xD;
"Before she comes!" Tyndale could do&#xD;
no more than utter just that. "Before she&#xD;
comes, Leslie Do you mean that you are&#xD;
still thinking of bringing that girl here-after&#xD;
what I have told you?"&#xD;
His tone took Leslie by surprise, and did&#xD;
&#xD;
not please her. She had a spirit of her own,&#xD;
and Arthur Tyndale saw a flash of it then.&#xD;
"Why do you suppose that I should not&#xD;
be thinking of it?" she asked. "I have told&#xD;
you that Norah is my sister, and that I mean&#xD;
to ask her to come and visit me. You have&#xD;
told me nothing concerning her which need&#xD;
alter that intention."&#xD;
"I have told you that she has a very fast&#xD;
reputation," he said, quickly-almost sharp-&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
"And when dd a fast reputation become&#xD;
such a crime in your eyes?" she inquired.&#xD;
He colored a little. Only a few weeks&#xD;
before, he had been flirting desperately - in&#xD;
the vain hope of making Leslie jealous-with&#xD;
a pretty widow, whose escapades were so&#xD;
many and so flagrant that she required all&#xD;
the bolstering of wealth and family position&#xD;
to maintain a foothold in society. A ready&#xD;
reply rose to his lips, however-.a true enough&#xD;
reply, too, since of the many men who like to&#xD;
flirt with fast women, only a small proportion&#xD;
like to marry them.&#xD;
"It was always a crime when it came in&#xD;
contact with you," he said. "If there is one&#xD;
thing I desire on earth, it is to keep such&#xD;
women at arm's length from you, Leslie. But&#xD;
it will be impossible to do that if you persist&#xD;
in asking this sister of yours here. Leslie,&#xD;
my darling, trust me in the matter, and&#xD;
promise not to do it!"&#xD;
If Leslie had been a shade less stanch in&#xD;
her resolve, he would probably have suc-&#xD;
ceeded then, for his handsome eyes pleaded&#xD;
even more powerfully tlsn his words. But&#xD;
the girl was true as steel to her generous pur-&#xD;
pose, and she did not yield.&#xD;
"Arthur, dear, don't tempt me," she said.&#xD;
"Somehow I feel as if I must do this-as if&#xD;
I must give Norah at least one chance in life.&#xD;
You can't tell how much I want to do it-if&#xD;
only for poor mamma's sake."&#xD;
"You owe a vast deal to the mother who&#xD;
left you behind her without a regret," he said,&#xD;
bitterly.&#xD;
"I do not think she left me without a re.&#xD;
gret," answered Leslie, flushing. "But, even&#xD;
if it were so, it would not alter my duty."&#xD;
"That is to say, your inclination."&#xD;
"I am sorry you think so," she replied,&#xD;
half proudly; "but you are mistaken. If I&#xD;
consulted my inclination, I should do exactly&#xD;
what. you wish. Even now" then she&#xD;
stopped and hesitated a minute -"tell me&#xD;
&#xD;
frankly, Arthur," she went on, "you are a&#xD;
man and should know best. The charge you&#xD;
have brought against my sister is a very in-&#xD;
definite one. Is there any reason why she&#xD;
should not be invited to my uncle's house?"&#xD;
She faced him with her clear, candid eyes,&#xD;
and seemed to demand an answer as straight-&#xD;
forward as her question. It is humiliating to&#xD;
confess, but, with every inclination to con-&#xD;
tinue the course which he had so gallantly&#xD;
opened, Mr. Tyndale found himself compelled&#xD;
to speak the truth.&#xD;
"There is no reason," he said, "unless&#xD;
you consider what I have already mentioned&#xD;
as a reason."&#xD;
But Leslie, as if~reIieved, shook her head&#xD;
and laughed.&#xD;
"How terribly strait-laced you have be-&#xD;
come all at once!" she said. "It is such a&#xD;
sudden thing that I think it must be an acute&#xD;
attack, and I can trust Norah to cure you.&#xD;
Poor Norah! Why is that so terrible in her,&#xD;
which is so charming in Mrs. Sandford?"&#xD;
Tyndale muttered something not very&#xD;
complimentary to Mrs. Sanford under his&#xD;
breath. Then he made one final effort.&#xD;
"Leslie," he said, gravely, "do you mean&#xD;
to say that you are going to disregard the&#xD;
first-the very first-request which I have&#xD;
ever made to you?"&#xD;
Leslie looked at him with a sudden keen-&#xD;
ness in her soft gray eyes which he did not&#xD;
quite fancy. She was not by, any means a&#xD;
fond, foolish girl to be hoodwinked at a man's&#xD;
pleasure, but a clever woman, who had not&#xD;
lived twenty-two years in the world for noth-&#xD;
ing. It struck her just now that there was&#xD;
an undue amount of eagerness and interest In&#xD;
Tyndale's manner.&#xD;
"You force me to believe that there is&#xD;
something more in this than you have told&#xD;
me, Arthur," she said. "You have not here-&#xD;
tofore counted fastness so terrible' a crime&#xD;
'that it alone should influence you so strongly&#xD;
against my sister. Again I ask-in fact, I&#xD;
demand - why you object so much to her&#xD;
coming?"&#xD;
"I have told you why," he answered.&#xD;
"You need not fear that I am concealing&#xD;
any thing from you. If you do not trust&#xD;
me-"&#xD;
"It is not that I do not trust you-trust&#xD;
you fully and entirely," she interrupted, with&#xD;
a sincerity which made him wince. But ybu&#xD;
think of me, Arthur, while I think of Norah&#xD;

I cannot give up the hope of doing her some&#xD;

if the iss'e involved giving up you."&#xD;
"You could face that alternative with due&#xD;
philosophy, perhaps," said he, bitterly. Then&#xD;
he added suddenly and passionately: "But&#xD;
it ~vill never involve that, Leslie-never, so&#xD;
help me God, so far as I am concerned!"&#xD;
It was a strange, vehement oath to take&#xD;
in such a connection, and sounded almost as&#xD;

which even himself could not break.&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
"Ay, there are some good things in life that fall&#xD;
not away with the rest,&#xD;
And, of all best things upon earth, I hold that a&#xD;
faithftil friend is the best.&#xD;
For woman, Will, is a thorny flower: It breaks,&#xD;
* and we bleed and smart;&#xD;
The blossom falls at the fairest, atid the thorn&#xD;
* 6runs into the Iheart.&#xD;
And woman's love is a bitter fruit; and, however&#xD;
he bite it, or sip,&#xD;
There's many a man has lived to curse the taste&#xD;
of that fruit on his lip.&#xD;
But never was any man yet, as I ween, he he&#xD;
whosoever he may,&#xD;
That has known what a true friend is, Will, and&#xD;
wished that knowledge away."&#xD;
ON the evening of the same day, Mr. Tyn-&#xD;
dale dined at his club. This was not a suffi.&#xD;
ciently remarkable occurrence to be worthy&#xD;
of note, if it had not chanced that he had&#xD;
been invited to dine with the Middletons, and&#xD;
had declined, on the score of a previous en-&#xD;
gagement. Yet, at seven o'clock he was sit-&#xD;
ting down to dinner quite alone-facing rather&#xD;
moodily a deserted dining-room and a solitary&#xD;
servant; for most diners at the club had van-&#xD;
ished before this time. Although he was&#xD;
alone-and had finished his dinner, too-the&#xD;
table where he sat bore another cover, at&#xD;
which he new and then glanced with an ex-&#xD;
pression half vexed, half ezpectant. Plainly&#xD;
he had anticipated a eompan~bn, and quite as&#xD;
plainly this companion had not arrived.&#xD;
"Is there no sign of Captain Tyndale&#xD;
yet?" he asked impatiently of the servant,&#xD;
who, hearing a carriage stop at the door,&#xD;
made a short excursion of curiosity to the&#xD;
window.&#xD;
"Captain Tyndale has just arrived, and is&#xD;
&#xD;
Coming in, sir," was the somewhat unexpected&#xD;
reply; and, as Arthur glanced up quickly,&#xD;
the person thus indicated entered the room.&#xD;
A tall, handsome man, with clear, bold feat-&#xD;
ures, mustache so long that they looked as&#xD;
if they ought to be very much in his way,&#xD;
dark eyes more keen than brilliant, a close&#xD;
crop of dark hair, and the weatherbeaten&#xD;
look of one on whom many suns had shone&#xD;
and many rains fallen. He came forward,&#xD;
and, sitting down in the vacant chair opposite&#xD;
Tyndale, laughed good-humoredly.&#xD;
"I am amazingly punctual, am I not?"&#xD;
he said. "Is that what you are looking so&#xD;
glum about ?-or is it the heat? By Jove 1&#xD;
it is infernally warm! I never felt any thing&#xD;
like it out of Algiers."&#xD;
"When one asks a man to dine at seven&#xD;
o'clock," said Tyndale, "one does not usually&#xD;
expect him at half-past that hour."&#xD;
"I am very sorry," said the other, apolo-&#xD;
getically. "I really meant to be on time-&#xD;
but what can one do against Fate? I met&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford in her pony-phacton an hour&#xD;
ago, and she insisted on taking me round the&#xD;
park. I whipped up famously, I can tell you,&#xD;
when I found what the hour was; but it&#xD;
hasn't been two minutes since she dropped&#xD;
me at the door."&#xD;
"Oh, if it was a ease of is tells inure, I&#xD;
can readily excuse you," said Tyndale, with a&#xD;
laugh. "She is one in a thousand for mak-&#xD;
ing a man forget time.-Have claret, Max ?-&#xD;
Handsome, isn't she?"&#xD;
"Thanks-yes," said Max, alluding to the&#xD;
claret. "Well, no-I don't think I should&#xD;
call her particularly handsome," he said, al-&#xD;
luding to Mrs. Sanaford. "Her complexion&#xD;
is good, and she ha~ a great deal of style-&#xD;
not much else, that I can perceive. V -&#xD;
"That is half the battle."&#xD;
"Of course-with a certain class of men.&#xD;
Not with you and me, Hal."&#xD;
Max Tyndale had called his cousin "Hal"&#xD;
ever since they were boys, for no earthly rca-&#xD;
son that any one could discover, except that&#xD;
it was not his name. He looked up now and&#xD;
laughed, raising his glass of iced claret to his&#xD;
lips.&#xD;
"Not with me, certainly," said Tyndale.&#xD;
"Still, she is a pretty woman, and very good&#xD;
company, as the phrase goes."&#xD;
I' Charmingly free and easy company, at&#xD;
any rate," said Max, dryly. "We advanced&#xD;
toward intimacy with seven-league boots this&#xD;
&#xD;
evening. It is convenient, at least, to meet a&#xD;
woman who takes all the trouble of making&#xD;
acquaintance off one's hands. She told me&#xD;
all about herself with engaging frankness;&#xD;
and asked so much about my affairs, that I&#xD;
really anticipated her inquiring how much a&#xD;
year I spend on cigars."&#xD;
"Probably she did not take sufficient in-&#xD;
terest in that subject."&#xD;
"So I supposed, from the fact that she&#xD;
did not ask. She made up for the emission,&#xD;
however, by inquiries sufficiently minute con-&#xD;
cerning you.~~&#xD;
"That was kind of her," said Tyndale, in&#xD;
a tone of only half-veiled contempt.&#xD;
"So I thought-considering all things!&#xD;
She was particularly anxious to know if you&#xD;
are engaged to Miss Grahame."&#xD;
"And you told her-?"&#xD;
"That I knew absolutely nothing of your&#xD;
affairs."&#xD;
"She didn't believe you, Max."&#xD;
"No, I don't suppose she did," said Max,&#xD;
philosophically. "Women rarely do believe&#xD;
the truth. That was good advice Satan gave&#xD;
Festus-you remember it, don't you?"&#xD;
"I can't say that I do," answered the&#xD;
other, carelessly. "If I had been able to&#xD;
catch a glimpse of you any time last night or&#xD;
to-day," he went on, "you might have grati-&#xD;
fied Mrs. Sandford's curiosity by letting her&#xD;
know that I am engaged to Miss Grahame."&#xD;
Max Tyndale started, changed color - a&#xD;
fact which was apparent even through his&#xD;
bronzed skin - and looked keenly at his&#xD;
cousin.&#xD;
"Is that a fact, Hal?" he said.&#xD;
"Yes, it is a fact," Arthur answered.&#xD;
"Do you remember that I had an engagement&#xD;
to ride with her yesterday afternoon? Well,&#xD;
we went, and before we got back the matter&#xD;
was settled."&#xD;
"I knew, of course, that it was coming,"&#xD;
said Max, looking at his claret. "But some-&#xD;
howl did not expect it quite so soon. Things&#xD;
always come unexpectedly, though, don't&#xD;
they? By Jove! "(with a slight laugh), "how&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford would have been astonished if&#xD;
I had been able to give her the news!"&#xD;
"You take it coolly," said Arthur, a little&#xD;
piqued.&#xD;
"Parbleu I my dear fellow, how else&#xD;
should I take it-especially when you set me&#xD;
such a good example?" said the other, open-&#xD;
ing~his dark eyes quickly. "Rhapsodize a&#xD;
&#xD;
little, and then I shall know how to he a lit-&#xD;
tie more effusive."&#xD;
" Nonsense!" said Arthur, shortly~&#xD;
"Whatever a man feels, you know that, if he&#xD;
has again of sense, he never rhapsodizes. I&#xD;
don't care a fig for your effusion; but you&#xD;
might acknowledge that the man whom Les-&#xD;
lie Grahame accepts is somewhat luckier&#xD;
than the most of his fellows."&#xD;
"That is easily acknowledged," said the&#xD;
other, heartily. "I congratulate you hon-&#xD;
estly on your luck! In all my wanderings&#xD;
about the world, I have never seen a more&#xD;
charming woman than Leslie Grahame."&#xD;
"I think she is charming," said Arthur.&#xD;
"My opinion just no* is not worth very much&#xD;
-being that of a man in love-but I remem-&#xD;
ber how mut~h her grace and refinement&#xD;
struck me when I met her first. I could&#xD;
sooner cut my throat than marry a fast wom-&#xD;
an or a flirt 1" he added, suddenly, and, as it&#xD;
seemed, savagely.&#xD;
Max shrugged his shoulders. He sup.&#xD;
posed his cousin was thinking of Mrs. Sand.&#xD;
ford.&#xD;
"They serve very well to pass the time,"&#xD;
he said. "One would not think of comparing&#xD;
them with such a woman as Miss Grahame,&#xD;
though."&#xD;
"Leslie suits me exactly," said Tyndale.&#xD;
"I really never expected to find a woman&#xD;
who would suit me half so well. Without&#xD;
being beautiful, she is exceedingly pretty.&#xD;
Without being intellectual, she is clever.&#xD;
Without being an angel, she is amiable; and&#xD;
without being a vixen, she is high-spirited.-&#xD;
What are you laughing at, Max?"&#xD;
"Excuse me," said Max. *"It only struck&#xD;
me, my good fellow that if you had said at&#xD;
once, 'She is perfection,' it would have&#xD;
shortened the matter."&#xD;
"But she is not perfection, nor, thank&#xD;
God, likely to he!" said Arthur, irritably.&#xD;
"Why do you misunderstand me? I am not&#xD;
rhapsodizing like a fool-I am telling you&#xD;
sanely and sensibly why Leslie Grahame suits&#xD;
me better than any other woman could. Even&#xD;
you-who are not in love with her-can't say&#xD;
that I exaggerate."&#xD;
"I don't say it," answered the other,&#xD;
slightly blushing. "I think you are perfect-&#xD;
ly right. I think Leslie Grahame is all that&#xD;
you have said-and more besides!"&#xD;
"Thank you!" said Tyndale, gratefully.&#xD;
"Well, acknowledging all this, ask yourself&#xD;

if it Is not the devil's own luck which puts&#xD;
my possession of it in such jeopardy that a&#xD;
day - an hour may part me from Leslie&#xD;
Grahame forever!"&#xD;
Captain Tyndale was in the act of filling&#xD;
his glass, but he put it down to look at his&#xD;
cousin. Had the wine mounted to his head?&#xD;
The suspicion crossed Max's mind, but the&#xD;
eyes which met his own, though rather&#xD;
gloomy, were perfectly sober.&#xD;
"You think I am jesting," Arthur said,&#xD;
as he met his glance. "You are mistaken. I&#xD;
am in earnest-so earnest that I mean to&#xD;
make a clean breast of every thing, and ask&#xD;
your advice concerning the cursed predica-&#xD;
mentin which I find myself."&#xD;
"All right," said Captain Tyndale, falling&#xD;
into the familiar phrase half mechanically-&#xD;
for he was strangely puzzled by Arthur's tone&#xD;
and manner. "Will you fill your glass?&#xD;
No? Tlet~ let us go out on the balcony and&#xD;
smoke a cigar. We can talk at our leisure&#xD;
there; and I confess I am stifling here."&#xD;
"It is hot," said the other, loosening his&#xD;
cravat with a jerk. "I never felt such weath-&#xD;
er in May before. At least, there's darkness&#xD;
and fresh air here," he went on, stepping out&#xD;
on the balcony of which his cousin had&#xD;
spoken. "Bring a chair out, Max, and let&#xD;
us be comfortable. Have you any engage-&#xD;
meat?"&#xD;
"None of any importance," answered&#xD;
~tax, coming out laden wit~ a chair. "I&#xD;
think my lionhood-.is that ~xpresRion cor-&#xD;
rect ? - we say bellehood, y~l know must&#xD;
be over. I have only recefred about half a&#xD;
dozen invitations this week.'&#xD;
"It is the season which is over," said&#xD;
Tyndale, striking a match and lighting his&#xD;
cigar. "People are getting languid with the&#xD;
warm weather-even too languid to lionize a&#xD;
captain of chasseurs who won the cross of&#xD;
the Legion in Algeria and a broken head at&#xD;
Gravelotte."&#xD;
"Stuff!" said the captain of ehasseurs,&#xD;
lighting his cigar in turn.&#xD;
It ifiny have been stuff; but it was true,&#xD;
nevertheless. Max Tyndale-who had served&#xD;
for several years in the French army-~de.&#xD;
served a great deal of credit that his head&#xD;
had not been wholly turned by the amount&#xD;
of lionizing which society had showered on&#xD;
him during the season now closing. Of course&#xD;
it was not qnly because he had received the&#xD;
Cross of the Legion in Algiers, or that he had&#xD;
&#xD;
distinguished himself by so much personal&#xD;
gallantry during the Franco- Prussian War,&#xD;
that he had won his grade where a soldier&#xD;
likes best to win it-on the field of battle.&#xD;
These things make a man respected among&#xD;
men, and, in a degree, admired among wom-&#xD;
en, but they do not of themselves win for&#xD;
him that capricious homage of society which&#xD;
may be despised by the wise, but the subtle&#xD;
flattery of which even the wisest are not al-&#xD;
ways able to withstand. There must be other&#xD;
gifts-personal gifts-to make the hero of&#xD;
battle-fields also a hero in drawing-rooms.&#xD;
These gifts Max Tyndale possessed-at least,&#xD;
in a measure. He was handsome, sufficiently&#xD;
accomplished, and unmistakably thorough-&#xD;
bred, besides which he had that graceful ease&#xD;
of manner-especially with women - which&#xD;
some men bear like a seal of distinction ; and&#xD;
yet there was nothing of the carpet-knight&#xD;
about him. In truth, the principal reason why&#xD;
he had been little spoiled by the flattery and&#xD;
attention so freely paid him, rested in the&#xD;
fact that he cared absolutely nothing for any&#xD;
triumph which society could give. His heart&#xD;
was in sterner conflicts, and bent on more&#xD;
tangible rewards. Ambition was his mistress&#xD;
at present, and she left him little leisure or&#xD;
thought for any other.&#xD;
With regard to worldly circumstances,&#xD;
there was a great difference between the two&#xD;
cousins. Arthur Tyndale had inherited, as&#xD;
sole heir, the accumulated wealth of several&#xD;
generations. Max had his pay, and perhaps&#xD;
a few hundreds besides-certainly nothing&#xD;
more. It is doubtful, however, if this dif.&#xD;
ference weighed for a moment in the thoughts&#xD;
of either. Thoy were not men to think or&#xD;
care for such a barrier. The same blood&#xD;
beat in their veins, and, apart from kindred&#xD;
ties, they liked each other sincerely, so it&#xD;
mattered very little that one was a million-&#xD;
aire and the other a mere soldier of fortune.&#xD;
Whatever their other faults, wealth in their&#xD;
eyes had none of the glamour with which&#xD;
more vulgar natures regard it. "Every thing&#xD;
is as it should be," Max told his cousin once.&#xD;
"You are the head of the house-I am only a&#xD;
cadet.' Don't think that I envy you an&#xD;
acre of your land, or a centime of your for-&#xD;
tune. On the contrary, I am heartily glad&#xD;
that there is somebody to keep up the old&#xD;
name in due state. We're both Tyndales-&#xD;
that is enough for us."&#xD;
It had been enough to draw them togeth.&#xD;
&#xD;

A SERIOUS DIFFICULTY.                    17&#xD;
&#xD;
er very warmly when they had met a few&#xD;
years before-it had been enough, also, to&#xD;
bring Max on a furlough to America, when he&#xD;
was sick in body, mind, and heart, after the&#xD;
failure of the French cause. Arthur's almost&#xD;
aflhctionate kindness, the petting of women,&#xD;
and the liking of men, had, however, gone&#xD;
very far toward enabling him to recover his&#xD;
old tone. As he sat opposite Tyndale at the&#xD;
dinner-table, which they had just quitted, he&#xD;
had not looked as if his hopes or thoughts&#xD;
had in any sense gone into exile at Chisel.&#xD;
hurst; or kept anxious watch with M. Thiers&#xD;
over the ofttimes-born republic.&#xD;
Considering that they were in the heart&#xD;
of a busy city, the street which the two&#xD;
youug men overlooked from their balcony&#xD;
was rather a quiet one. Few pedestrians&#xD;
passed, only now and then a carriage; gas.&#xD;
lamps shone through the heavy foliage of&#xD;
green trees, and the serene starlight was able&#xD;
to assert itself quite well. The club-house&#xD;
was blazing with gas, but somewhat empty.&#xD;
Now and then came the clink of billiard-balls,&#xD;
or the sound of voices; but there was little&#xD;
to remind them of the neighborhood of others.&#xD;
"1 am all attention," Max at last sug-&#xD;
gested, when he found that his cousin kept&#xD;
silence after some time had passed.&#xD;
Even then, Tyndale did not speak imme-&#xD;
diately. lie took his cigar from his lips,&#xD;
and knocked oil' the ashes before he said:&#xD;
"Of course it is a woman U'&#xD;
"So I supposed," said the other, coolly.&#xD;
Then, after a pause, "Has it any thing to (10&#xD;
with the pretty avidow?"&#xD;
"If you mean Mrs. Sandford," said Tyn.&#xD;
dale, contemptuously, "I should think you&#xD;
could tell for yourself that she is not the kind&#xD;
of woman a man ever gets into serious trouble&#xD;
about."&#xD;
"There is still another, then!" said Max.&#xD;
"Upon my word, you would make a good&#xD;
Turk, Hal! Suppose you emigrate to Con.&#xD;
stantinople - or perhaps Salt Lake might&#xD;
serve your purpose, since it is nearer home I"&#xD;
~'This is no jesting matter," said Tyn.&#xD;
dale, half vexed. "If you can keep serious,&#xD;
Max, for ten minutes, I wish you would. Do&#xD;
you remember when I was in Paris two&#xD;
years ago-hearing me speak of a girl I had&#xD;
met at Baden? An Irish girl. Norah Des.&#xD;
mond was her name."&#xD;
"Really, my dear fellow, you spoke of so&#xD;
many girls,"' said Max, in a puzzled tone,&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
am not sure that I remember this special&#xD;
one. What about her?"&#xD;
"You must remember her," said the&#xD;
er, pettishly. ~' You never heard me speak&#xD;
of any other as I spoke of her, for I was a&#xD;
confounded fool about her just then. She&#xD;
was certainly the prettiest woman 1 saw&#xD;
abroad, as well as the most fascinating."&#xD;
"I think I do remember something about&#xD;
an Irish girl," said Captain Tyndale, after a&#xD;
pause. "Her father Was a sort of Robert&#xD;
Macaire, wasn't he?"&#xD;
"Exactly! A more disreputable person&#xD;
you can't conceive; but you might have&#xD;
thought him a crown prince, from the way&#xD;
his daughter carried herself. She had the&#xD;
pride of an archduchess, and the temper of&#xD;
the devil!"&#xD;
"An interesting combination !" said the&#xD;
captain of chasseurs, dryly.&#xD;
"By Jove, you might have said so if you&#xD;
had seen her I" answered the other, with&#xD;
sudden enthusiasm. "I would match her&#xD;
against any woman on the Continent for turn-&#xD;
ing a man's head in the shortest possible&#xD;
time-if she had a mind to do it."&#xD;
"She seems to have had a mind to turn&#xD;
'yours.~,&#xD;
"I think she-had," said he, coolly, "and&#xD;
she succeeded-after a fashion. We had a&#xD;
fine flirtation for a month or two, and, when&#xD;
at last I was obliged to come home, I should&#xD;
be afraid to say to how much or how little I&#xD;
bound myself."&#xD;
"That's unlucky!" said Max, still speak-&#xD;
ing very dryly.&#xD;
"It's the devil's own luck!" repeated his&#xD;
cousin, fiercely - for, it is astonishing how&#xD;
people anathematize luck, or the devil, or&#xD;
any other comrt'enient abstraction, when the&#xD;
consequences of their own deeds begin to be&#xD;
unpleasantly felt.&#xD;
"She is not likely to trouble you, though&#xD;
-is she?" said Max. "A woman like that&#xD;
would be very a~t to keep her distance-even&#xD;
if the Atlantic was not between you."&#xD;
"But the trouble exactly is, that the At-&#xD;
lantic will not be between us very long," said&#xD;
Authur, gloomily. "Max, imagine if you can,&#xD;
what I felt to-day when I heard that Norak&#xD;
Desmond is Leslie Graham's sister!"&#xD;
"What!"&#xD;
"There is no possible doubt about it; and&#xD;
she L~shie - has written for her to come&#xD;
here!"&#xD;

1$                A DAUGhTER OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
"The devil!" said Captain Tyndale.&#xD;
- "I think it must be the devil - and all&#xD;
his fiends to boot!" responded the other,&#xD;
grimly.&#xD;
There was a minute's silence before Max&#xD;
recoveredd himself enough to apeak.&#xD;
"You are sure this is not a jest, Arthur?"&#xD;
he said, then. "I confess I scarcely under-&#xD;
stand it. How could Miss Grahame have a&#xD;
sister of whom you never heard?"&#xD;
"That i~ easily explained," Tyndale an-&#xD;
swered-and he explained it in a few words&#xD;
-after which he added: "On my soul, Max, I&#xD;
have not an idea what to do. The whole af-&#xD;
fair looks to me desperate. Turning it over&#xD;
in my mind, as I have been doing all day, I&#xD;
see not the least clew out of the difficulty."&#xD;
"Stop a minute," said Max, "and let mc&#xD;
make It clear in my own mind. I had not a&#xD;
thought it was so serious as this, or I should&#xD;
have paid more attention. In the first place,&#xD;
are yon engaged to the girl ?"&#xD;
"To Norah? I suppose I was engaged to&#xD;
her when I left Europe."&#xD;
"And you have never broken it off?"&#xD;
"Well-no." Then, after a pause, "You&#xD;
see it was this way: I came home in the au-&#xD;
tumn of '69, with an understanding that I&#xD;
was to go back for her the next spring. I&#xD;
was very much in love, of course, and kept&#xD;
up a correspondence for some months-con-&#xD;
found it, Max, no doubt she has every one of&#xD;
~hose letters yet!"&#xD;
"She must be a fool if she has not. Never&#xD;
~nind the letters-go on."&#xD;
"That winter I met Leslie Gmahame-I&#xD;
had not been here for years before, you know&#xD;
-and, from the very first, I saw she suited&#xD;
me as no woman ever had suited me before.&#xD;
I had been a mad fool about Norah Desmond,&#xD;
but I knew all the time she was no wife for&#xD;
me-setting aside the unpleasant fact of her&#xD;
disgraceful father."&#xD;
"A very unpleasant fact, I should think!"&#xD;
conimented Max, in whose conception family&#xD;
pride was second only to professional honor.&#xD;
"In a short time I recognized the folly of&#xD;
the whole thing, and made up my mind to end&#xD;
it. But that was not very easily done. I&#xD;
stopped writing, but I could not resolve to&#xD;
take any more decisive step. People talk of&#xD;
boarding lions, but, by Jove! I would rather&#xD;
beard a dozen lions than Norab Desmond,&#xD;
when her Celtic pride and temper are fairly&#xD;
in arms. Sothe spring of "70 came on. She&#xD;
&#xD;
wrote once or twice to ask if I was ill, or&#xD;
why I had not written. I did not answer the&#xD;
letters1 and they stopped."&#xD;
"Well?" said Max, as the voice stopped&#xD;
also.&#xD;
"Well, the war came on in the summer,&#xD;
and cut off communication, you know. I&#xD;
can't say that I was sorry for* it; and, from&#xD;
that time, I heard nothing of Norah-until&#xD;
to-day. Then Leslie fired the whole thing&#xD;
upon me like a mine of gunpowde~."&#xD;
"It is certainly an awkward state of af.&#xD;
fairs," said Captain Tyndale, after a pause of&#xD;
some duration, during which be had smoked&#xD;
like a furnace, and, it is to be supposed, re-&#xD;
flected like a sage. His cousin had not a&#xD;
very sensitive ear, or he might have detected&#xD;
an accent of contempt in the tones of his&#xD;
voice, despite its studied modulation. In&#xD;
truth, it had been a sorry story, and this&#xD;
cool, clear - headed soldier was the Inst man&#xD;
in the world to sympathize with its mingled&#xD;
weakness and cowardice.&#xD;
"It is worse than awkward," said Tyndale.&#xD;
"There is no telling what will be the upshot&#xD;
of it, for a prouder woman than Leslie Gra.&#xD;
hame does not live; and I could see plainly&#xD;
enough this morning that her uncle was not&#xD;
by any means anxious for my alliance. If I&#xD;
had only known this yesterday-"&#xD;
"You would not have asked Miss Gm-&#xD;
hame to marry you?"&#xD;
"I should have deferred doing so, at all&#xD;
events, until I could have had some under.&#xD;
standing with that "-a gulp-" that girl in&#xD;
Europe."&#xD;
"She will certainly come, I suppose?"&#xD;
"You may count on that" (savagely).&#xD;
"She will come, if only for the pleasure of&#xD;
discomfiting me."&#xD;
Captain Tyndale took his cigar from his&#xD;
lips, and rolled a whole cloud of smoke from&#xD;
under his mustache before lie spoke. Then&#xD;
lie said&#xD;
"It is an* ugly business, and you are in&#xD;
for it emphatically. Frankly, I see hut one&#xD;
course for you-though I am not at all sure&#xD;
you will adopt it."&#xD;
"Aid that-"&#xD;
"Is to go to Miss Grahame and make a&#xD;
candid statement of the whole affair. If I&#xD;
know any thing of women, you may save your-&#xD;
self by that move, and by that only."&#xD;
"YoU may know something of women,"&#xD;
said his cousin, coldly, "but you don't know&#xD;
&#xD;
any thing of Leslie Grahame~ She would&#xD;
never forgive such a wound to her pride."&#xD;
"Is the wound likely to be less severe&#xD;
when she finds that you have been playing&#xD;
the r4le of accepted suitor to her, while you&#xD;
were engaged to her sister?"&#xD;
"Suppose she never knows it?"&#xD;
"I have only judged by what you told me,&#xD;
but I should not think such a woman as you&#xD;
lave described could readily be induced to&#xD;
forego so good an opportunity of revenge."&#xD;
"We shall see," answered Tyndale. "I-I&#xD;
think that I may induce her to see that her&#xD;
best policy is silence."&#xD;
"Cynics tell us that every woman has&#xD;
her price," said Max, carelessly. "Of course,&#xD;
you know best whether or not Miss Desmond&#xD;
has hers. Only, I warn you, it is a perilous&#xD;
game you are going to play."&#xD;
"At all events, it is better than throwing&#xD;
up my hand, as you advise."&#xD;
" I didn't advise that, exactly; but I do&#xD;
advise you to avoi(l a course of temporizing&#xD;
which can only end by placing you in a more&#xD;
hopelessly false position than you occupy at&#xD;
present."&#xD;
"XVe shall see," said Tyndale, sullenly.&#xD;
"When the whole thing comes out, as it&#xD;
sooner or later must, it will lay you open ~o a&#xD;
very serious charge of dishonor," said his&#xD;
cousin, a little sternly, as it seemed.&#xD;
"It is not likely to come to that, I trust,"&#xD;
said Tyndale. "Anyhow, there is nothing to&#xD;
do but to let things drift. When tle tug of&#xD;
war comes, I can rely on you for aid-eh, old&#xD;
fellow?"&#xD;
"You know that," said the other.&#xD;
But in his heart he wished the aid had&#xD;
been demanded in a better cause.&#xD;
ChAPTER IV.&#xD;
"So, woukist thou 'seape the coming ill,&#xD;
Implore the dread Invisible&#xD;
Thy sweets themselves to sour!&#xD;
~Ve1l ends his life, believe me, never&#xD;
On whom with hands thus full forever,&#xD;
The gods their bounty shower."&#xD;
IT is doubtful whether the self-constituted&#xD;
jury of society was ever more unanimous in&#xD;
rendering a verdict of approval than when&#xD;
Leslie Grahame's engagement to Arthur Tyn-&#xD;
dale became publicly known.. "What an ex-&#xD;
cellent match!" people said with one accord.&#xD;
&#xD;
How very suitable in every particular!"&#xD;
Even the young ladies who had cast~ their&#xD;
nets unsuccessfully for the fish who had&#xD;
landed himself at Leslie's feet, acknowledged&#xD;
that, if matches arc ever made in heaven, this&#xD;
special match bore every mark of celestial&#xD;
appointment. Both the parties concerned&#xD;
were so young, so handsome, so charming,&#xD;
and so wealthy, that it was like the ending&#xD;
of a novel or a fairy.talc, where everybody is&#xD;
paired off with such a delightful balance of&#xD;
personal and worldly gifts.&#xD;
A few days after the engagement became&#xD;
an accomplished fact, and while people were&#xD;
still talking of it in the few informal gather-&#xD;
ings which they pei'mitted themselves during&#xD;
the languid heat which had come upon them,&#xD;
the Middletons held a family council to de-&#xD;
cide where their summer should be spent.&#xD;
Somewhat to the surprise of her uncle and&#xD;
aunt, Leslie cast her vote for the neglected&#xD;
shades of Rosland-a pleasant country-scat,&#xD;
conveniently near the city, which they had not&#xD;
seen for several years.&#xD;
"I am tired of watering-places, and sum-&#xD;
mer traveling, and summer sight-seeing," the&#xD;
young lady said. "No, uncle, I ddn't think&#xD;
that the mountains, or the sea, or Canada, or&#xD;
the lakes, will tempt me. I have a fancy to&#xD;
go back to dear old Rosland and spend the&#xD;
summer in the luxurious dokefar niente which,&#xD;
after all, one can only enjoy under one's own&#xD;
vine and fig-tree. Besides, I know that you&#xD;
and Aunt Mildred are tired of dissipation, and&#xD;
would like a little quiet once in a way.&#xD;
"We are anxious to consult your wishes,&#xD;
my dear," said Mrs. Middleton. "Of course&#xD;
it would be pleasant to go to Rosland; but I&#xD;
am afraid you will find it very dull, Leslie.&#xD;
You know you have not been there since you&#xD;
were grown."&#xD;
"It is for that very reason I want to go,"&#xD;
said Leslie. "I used to be so happy there;&#xD;
and, as for being dull, I want to be dull. I&#xD;
am tired of dissipation. And, if Norah comes,&#xD;
we must have some settled habitation in which&#xD;
to receive her."&#xD;
"That does not follow. She will proba-&#xD;
bly not arrive until July; and she could join&#xD;
us if we were at a watering-place, or accom-&#xD;
pany us if we were traveling."&#xD;
"She might not like to do either."&#xD;
"No-she might not like it," said Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton, slowly. She had not thought of&#xD;
Miss Desmond in connection with their sum-&#xD;

MRS. SANDFORD.                        21&#xD;
&#xD;
20                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
mer plans before; but, thinking of her now,&#xD;
she began to agree with Leslie that Rosland&#xD;
would, after all, be the best place for them.&#xD;
Them wa~ no telling what sort of a creature&#xD;
this Bohemian girl might prove to be, and, in&#xD;
view of possible contingencies, a quiet coun-&#xD;
try-house was the safest and most desirable&#xD;
retreat. "If she is what she may be, it would&#xD;
do incalculable harm to Leslie to introduce&#xD;
her into society !" thought the most refined&#xD;
and fastidious of ek~ie1eines, with an uncon-&#xD;
scious shudder at her own share in such an&#xD;
affliction.&#xD;
"But what will Mr. Tyndale think of your&#xD;
burying yourself at Rosland?" she asked, at&#xD;
length. "Of course we shall be very glad to&#xD;
see him there; but no doubt he expected to&#xD;
join o~ir party at some gayer place."&#xD;
Sh~spoke this very innocently, when,&#xD;
glancing up, she saw a gleam in Leslie's eyes,&#xD;
and a smile on her lip which threw a sudden&#xD;
ray of light on the young lady's unexpected&#xD;
pastoral fancy.&#xD;
"Have you forgotten who is our next&#xD;
neighbor there?" she asked, with a laugh.&#xD;
"No, I don't mean the Covingtons "-as Mrs.&#xD;
Middletonts lips unclosed-" I mean on tiw&#xD;
otiser side. Have you forgotten that our&#xD;
grounds adjoin those of the Tyndale place?&#xD;
Arthur and I have talked it' all over. We&#xD;
are both tired of the gossip and flirtation that&#xD;
make ~tip watering-place life, and he has not&#xD;
been down, to look at his old home since he&#xD;
was a boy. So we are going to enjoy our&#xD;
summer in a sane1 sensible, Arcadian fashion&#xD;
for once."&#xD;
"I don't see why you could not have said&#xD;
as much without all this discussion, then!"&#xD;
remarked Mr. Middleton. "It seems, Mil-&#xD;
dred, that you and I may resign ourselves to&#xD;
the mie of puppets, Mr. Tyndale being gra-&#xD;
ciously pleased to pull our strings through&#xD;
this young lady, who, like all the rest of bKer&#xD;
sex, must needs double fifty times about her&#xD;
point when she might save trouble by making&#xD;
straight for it."&#xD;
"I was no~ doubling," answered Leslie,&#xD;
indignantly. "I said from the first I wanted&#xD;
to go to Rosland-didn't I, Aunt Mildred ?-I&#xD;
was not obliged to remind you that the Tyn-&#xD;
dale place was next ours. You might have&#xD;
rememberodAhat without my aid. If you are&#xD;
anxious for* a watering-place, uncle, you may&#xD;
go by yourself, I am sure. Neither Aunt Mil-&#xD;
dred nor I will interfere."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have no doubt that the new lover has&#xD;
quite banished any need of the old uncle," he&#xD;
replied, with a Timon-like accent, which was&#xD;
not a striking success.&#xD;
But Timon himself could scarcely have&#xD;
resisted the glance with which Leslie returned&#xD;
this thrust. The soft, gray eyes looked so&#xD;
pretty and reproachful that it was no wonder&#xD;
the matter ended by a kiss on the spot, and a&#xD;
letter written an hour later to the house-keeper&#xD;
at Rosland, announcing the intended arrival&#xD;
of the family.&#xD;
"flow delightful it will be!" said Leslie,&#xD;
on the same afternoon, to her lover. "I don't&#xD;
think you appreciate half how delightful, Ar-&#xD;
thur; but then you have not b~en down in&#xD;
that lovely country for so long~ You have&#xD;
no idea what a beautiful old place Stratford&#xD;
is. And, taking a short path through the&#xD;
woods, it is not more than a mile from Ros-&#xD;
land!"&#xD;
"It really seems providential altogether,"&#xD;
Tyndale said, reflecting the brightness of her&#xD;
face, as, indeed, few men could have helped&#xD;
doing. "Strafford has passed so entirely out&#xD;
of ray life these latter years, that if it had not&#xD;
been an old family place 1 should have put it&#xD;
in the market long ago. It has served to sink&#xD;
money on as far back as I can remember," he&#xD;
added, with a laugh; "and if you like it, Les-&#xD;
lie, the odds are that still more will be sunk&#xD;
on it before long."&#xD;
"I do like it," said Leslie, "more than I&#xD;
can tell you. I have never been in the house&#xD;
since I was a very small child; but the&#xD;
grounds, with their deep glades and old mossy&#xD;
oaks, are beautiful. Whenever I read of fauns,&#xD;
and dryads, and ~ylvan fairies, I always think&#xD;
of Strafford. They all find, a home there, I&#xD;
am sure."&#xD;
"Do they?" said he, smiling. "Did you&#xD;
use to know them? To think of your pretty,&#xD;
childish feet wandering alone about the woods&#xD;
of Strafford! Ab, my Leslie, what a lucky&#xD;
fellow I am to have met you-in tiniii!"&#xD;
"In time!" she repeated. "Why do you&#xD;
say that?"&#xD;
"Why should I not say it, when some-&#xD;
body who deserved you better might have&#xD;
won you if I had been a little later in coming&#xD;
back to America?" he answered, quickly.&#xD;
"That is not very likely," said she. "Fate&#xD;
was saving me up for you. I know that now!&#xD;
Whenever I used to feel the least inclination&#xD;
to fall in love with anybody, something in my&#xD;
&#xD;
heart would draw back and say, 'Not yet.'&#xD;
You see, it was waiting for you, and did not,~&#xD;
mean that my life should contain any thing&#xD;
which you or I need regret."&#xD;
"My Leslie!" he said, with a sort of pas-&#xD;
sionate fondness; but none the less a flush&#xD;
came over his face, which Leslie, if she had&#xD;
seen it, would not have understood. It was&#xD;
a flush of reproachful shame to compare the&#xD;
heart given him with the heart he had to give.&#xD;
Men of the world do not often feel such twinges&#xD;
as this; but, despite his worldly training, Tyn-&#xD;
dale felt it now-felt it because lie was con-&#xD;
scious that he possessed this heart only on&#xD;
sufferance, and because he knew that a pos-&#xD;
sible conviction awaited him, which would&#xD;
make every fond word Leslie now uttered&#xD;
turn to gall in her memory. "Tell me about&#xD;
Stratford," he went on, after a moment, anx-&#xD;
ious, perhaps, to change the subject. "I&#xD;
have only the vaguest recollection of it.&#xD;
Isn't there a pond somewhere about the&#xD;
grounds? It seems to me I remember catch-&#xD;
ing trout out of a pond."&#xD;
"Yes," said Leslie, "but you should not&#xD;
call it a pond-it is a lake, and such a lovely&#xD;
one! Don't you remember how still, an~l&#xD;
clear, and deep the water is? how the grounds&#xD;
slope down to it on one side, and what dark,&#xD;
solemn pines are on the other? Then, the&#xD;
water-lihies-O Arthur, how could you forget&#xD;
the water-lilies?"&#xD;
"I had not much of a soul for water-lilies&#xD;
in those days," said he. "I have a much&#xD;
more vivid remembrance of the trout. The&#xD;
river is near at hand, too; isn't it?"&#xD;
"Nearer to Rosland than to Strafford, but&#xD;
near enough to both. We always keep a boat&#xD;
on it."&#xD;
"And we will put one on the pond-I beg&#xD;
pardon, the lake. Then we can row, and fish,&#xD;
and talk, and read 'The Earthly Paradise,'&#xD;
and, in short, make an earthly paradise of&#xD;
our own."&#xD;
"I don't like the comparison," said Les-&#xD;
lie. "Paradise had a serpent, you know;&#xD;
and every paradise, since that time, has been&#xD;
furnished, with the same drawback. Now,&#xD;
ours will not have any; so we will not call it&#xD;
*by the fairbut fatal name."&#xD;
"No, we will not," said Tyndale; but&#xD;
again a wave of color swept into his face, for&#xD;
he was thinking what a serpent in this earthly&#xD;
paradise Norah Desmond 'might prove, if she&#xD;
chose. "Max has promised to go down with&#xD;
&#xD;
me," he went on, after a pause. "I don't&#xD;
think lie will find it dull, for there will be&#xD;
plenty of shooting and fishing for him."&#xD;
"What a nice pertie carr~e we shall make&#xD;
when Norah comes!" said Leslie, gayly.&#xD;
"Perhaps Captain Tyndahe will even be&#xD;
obliging enough to fall in love with her."&#xD;
"I don't think that at all likely," said&#xD;
Arthur, grimly. "Max has no fancy for that&#xD;
kind of, woman, and Miss Desmond flies at&#xD;
higher game than a soldier of fortune."&#xD;
"How do you know that?" asked Leslie,&#xD;
a little curiously.&#xD;
"Oh, anybody could tell so much by look-&#xD;
ing at her? I never saw her that she was&#xD;
not surrounded by'what the English call 'tip.&#xD;
top swells.' She is amazingly beautiful, you&#xD;
see, and has a way with her that is positively&#xD;
fascinatiwr"&#xD;
"It must have been striking to impress&#xD;
yow so much merely at sight," said Leslie.&#xD;
She said it with the utmost innocence 01'&#xD;
intention and manner, but Tyndale shot a&#xD;
keen and slightly uneasy glance at her. We&#xD;
all know the 'proverb about a guilty con-&#xD;
science; and it was never better exemplified&#xD;
than by this young fellow, who had already&#xD;
woven about himself' the tangled web of a&#xD;
very embarrassing deception. He was spared&#xD;
reply, however; for just then a carriage drew&#xD;
up at the door, and Leslie, bending forward&#xD;
to glance through the open window at its oc-&#xD;
cupant, uttered an exclamation.&#xD;
"Here is Mrs. Sandford!" she said.&#xD;
"What is it the Italians say when they mean&#xD;
'well sent?'&#xD;
"I would rather inquire what they say&#xD;
when they mean 'ill sent,"' Tyndale answered,&#xD;
frowning and flushing impatiently-for his&#xD;
fair skin flushed at the least provocation.&#xD;
"That woman, Leslie, if you will excuse&#xD;
me-"&#xD;
"But I won't excuse you," interrupted&#xD;
Leslie, laughing. "You must stay and bear&#xD;
your share of the infliction, if you look at&#xD;
her visit in that light. I' am sure that a&#xD;
month ago you would have considered it in&#xD;
any other. how does a man dare to talk of&#xD;
a woman~s inconstancy, I wonder?~'&#xD;
"I never did," said Tyndale, shrugging&#xD;
his shoulders. The gesture was significant,&#xD;
and implied that he had rather been obliged&#xD;
to find the contrary fault with women-that,&#xD;
as a rule, they had been inconveniently con-&#xD;
stant to him. "By Jove!" he went on,&#xD;

A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
A PRETTY PICTURE.&#xD;
&#xD;
walking to the window, "Max has been nice-&#xD;
ly caught. He was passing along the street,&#xD;
when Mrs. Sandford stopped him; and now&#xD;
she is bringing him in, whether he will or no."&#xD;
"I am glad of that," said Leslie, in her&#xD;
fresh, cordial voice. "I like your cousin so&#xD;
much, and he comes so seldom of late! Aunt&#xD;
Mildred and I were regretting it only yester-&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"Max has very little fancy for society,"&#xD;
said Tyndale, feeling an obligation to apolo-&#xD;
gize. "He has still less fancy for Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford," he added, "but she seems to be&#xD;
making a dead set at him."&#xD;
"That must be very awkward."&#xD;
"Amazingly so to a man like Max, who'&#xD;
likes to place women on a pedestal, and keep&#xD;
them there. I think he dislikes fast women&#xD;
even more than I do," the speaker pursued,&#xD;
reflectively. *&#xD;
"Do you dislike fast women?" said Les-&#xD;
lie, arching her brows. "How necessary it&#xD;
always is to state our opinions if we wish&#xD;
them known!"&#xD;
To this shaft of gentle satire Tyndale had&#xD;
no opportunity to reply, for at that moment&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford' entered the room, followed by&#xD;
the tall, soldierly figure of Captain Tyndale.&#xD;
The first impression which she made on the&#xD;
mind was style-the second, complexion. She&#xD;
was dressed in black, not that which is sacred&#xD;
to mourning, but a light and becoming mix-,&#xD;
ture of grenadine and lace, brightened by&#xD;
delicate mauve ribbons, which set off a com-&#xD;
plexion that might have moved the envy of a&#xD;
girl of sixteen. Color was her strong point,&#xD;
together with a pair of large blue eyes, which&#xD;
she had an artless and infantile way of open-&#xD;
ing to their fullest extent. She opened them&#xD;
now, as she came forward.&#xD;
"What a lucky creature I am to find you&#xD;
at home!" she said, meeting Leslie with an&#xD;
effusion which sometimes tried Miss Gra-&#xD;
hame's courtesy severely. "I came to beg*&#xD;
you to go to drive with me-the afternoon is&#xD;
so charming !-bnt, since you are engaged, I&#xD;
shall not press the point; and, indeed, this&#xD;
cool drawing - room is pleasanter than the&#xD;
dusty avenue. You see I have brought Cap-&#xD;
tain Tyndale in with me. I told him that, if&#xD;
we were very good, perhaps you would give us&#xD;
some iced tea and bread-and-butter."&#xD;
"You shall have as much as you please&#xD;
of both," said Leslie, turning with a smile to&#xD;
greet Max; and then Mrs. Sandford, weakening&#xD;
&#xD;
to a consciousness of Arthur'a existence, put&#xD;
out a delicate, gloved hand to him.&#xD;
"I thought that I was not to have any&#xD;
recognition at all," he said, taking it with a&#xD;
very effective air of reproach.&#xD;
"I am not sure that you deserve any,"&#xD;
auswerei she, opening the blue eyes, if pos-&#xD;
sible, still wider. "When one neglects his&#xD;
old friends, as you have done, he deserves&#xD;
nothing better than to be neglected in turn.&#xD;
Even an engagement is not an excuse for&#xD;
every thing I'~&#xD;
"It ought to be, then," said he. "Come,&#xD;
you must let me make my peace! I really&#xD;
cannot affortl to quarrel with you-we have&#xD;
been friends too long."&#xD;
"Perhaps some day I may like you as&#xD;
well as ever again," said she, nonchalantly,&#xD;
but at present you are hopelessly out of my&#xD;
good graces. It is not only on account of&#xD;
your atrocious neglect; but I forswear en-&#xD;
gaged men on principle. They are always&#xD;
stupid."&#xD;
"I am sure nobody could be stupid with&#xD;
you4" said Tyndale, falling into his old habit&#xD;
of flattery. Men always flattered Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford. It was not only the easiest way of en-&#xD;
tertaining her, but it was an incense with&#xD;
which~she soon made it patent that she could'&#xD;
not dispense.&#xD;
"Oh, what a mistake!" cried she, laugh-&#xD;
ing - Tyndale, who had of late grown very&#xD;
fastidious, thought what an empty laugh it&#xD;
was, and how wide she opened her mouth-&#xD;
"any amount of people are stupid with me.&#xD;
I wish I did know how to keep them from&#xD;
being so-I should not be boredto death 'half&#xD;
of my time, then! It would be better than&#xD;
an invisible cap, or a wishing-carpet, or any&#xD;
thing of that kind. Oh, dear, what a charm-&#xD;
ing place this is!" she went on, sinking down&#xD;
on a sofa, and looking about her. "No won-&#xD;
der you find it dililcult to tear yourself away.&#xD;
-Leslie, dear, will it inconvenience you to&#xD;
order some tea? This warm, dusty weather&#xD;
makes one feel horribly in need of refresh-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
Mrs. Sanford's manners were certainly&#xD;
very free and easy, but Leslie was accus-&#xD;
tomed to them; so, she rang the bell and&#xD;
ordered the tea - of which it may be said&#xD;
that a large amount was always made in the&#xD;
morning, and set away in ice to cool in the&#xD;
most thorough manner by evening. It was&#xD;
soon served, together with the bread-and-&#xD;
&#xD;
butter which Mrs. Sandford had promised&#xD;
Captain Tyndale.&#xD;
"If you don't like this, you shall have&#xD;
some iced claret," said Leslie, turning, with a&#xD;
smile, to Max.&#xD;
"Why should you think I don't like it?"&#xD;
said he. "I am a Frenchman, it is true, but&#xD;
I can drink son~iething besides cafi noir and&#xD;
absinthe. Those are what Americans take to&#xD;
be a Frenchman's favorite beverages - are&#xD;
they not?"&#xD;
"I don't think we do you so much injus.&#xD;
tice," said Mrs. Sandford. "I, for one, always&#xD;
associate the idea of a Frenchman with cham-&#xD;
pagne. Something light and sparkling, and&#xD;
altogether charming, you know."&#xD;
" There, Max!" cried Arthur, laughing.&#xD;
"Never say again that nobody compliments&#xD;
you, my good fellow."&#xD;
"I should not think of appropriating&#xD;
such a compliment," said Max. "In the&#xD;
first place, I am only half a Frenchman,&#xD;
and, in the second place, even that fund&#xD;
of vanity, which always stands a man in&#xD;
such g~od stead, fails to countenance the&#xD;
idea that I am either light, sparkling, or al-&#xD;
together charming."&#xD;
"Perhaps you are not the best judge of&#xD;
that," said Leslie, smiling.&#xD;
*  In this way they laughed and talked,&#xD;
while they drank the liquid amber, which&#xD;
was called tea, and ate the light wafers that&#xD;
passed under the name of bread. Mrs. Mid-&#xD;
dieton, who entered the room soon after this,&#xD;
thought what a pretty picture they made,&#xD;
gathered, in the neighborhood of a large bay-&#xD;
window, through which a flood of golden sun-&#xD;
light was streaming into the room, gleaming&#xD;
about the tea-equipage, touching the mirrors&#xD;
and pictures with a glow of crimson bright-&#xD;
ness, and outli~iing~Leslie's graceful head like&#xD;
a figure in a pre-Raphaclite picture. Outside&#xD;
the window, the roses were climbing and&#xD;
clustering, and loading the air with summer&#xD;
sweetness. In the street, above the roll&#xD;
of carriages, and the fast-trotting tramp of&#xD;
horses' feet, sounded the sweet strains of a&#xD;
German band, playing a Strauss waltz; Mrs.&#xD;
~andford looked up, and gave one of her effu-&#xD;
sive exClamations:&#xD;
"0 my dear, dear Mrs. Middleton, think&#xD;
how charming!" she cried. "You are all&#xD;
going into the country to spend the summer,&#xD;
Leslie tells me, and I am obliged to go down&#xD;
to that very county, to visit some relations&#xD;
&#xD;
who think that I have neglected them shame-&#xD;
fully. I thought that I was going to be terri-&#xD;
bly bored; and it is an intense relief to know&#xD;
that I shall have such delightful neighbors.&#xD;
But you must not be surprised if you see me&#xD;
at Rosland perpetually."&#xD;
"We shall be very glad to see you as&#xD;
often as you can come," said Mrs. Middleton,&#xD;
hQspitably. She had no particular fancy for&#xD;
Mrs. Sanford, but everybody received&#xD;
and she was, as Tyndale had once said,&#xD;
"good company" - that is, she was always&#xD;
in a good - humor, and always to be relied&#xD;
upon in any social emergency.&#xD;
"Ohhow delightful!" repeated that en-&#xD;
thusiastic lady. Then she turned to Tyndale.&#xD;
"I shall be so glad to see your place," she&#xD;
said. "My cousins, who live in the neigh-&#xD;
borhood, tell me that it is beautiful. Don't&#xD;
you mean to give a ball or something of the&#xD;
sort when you go down-as a house-warming,&#xD;
you know?"&#xD;
"I really had not thought of it," said he.&#xD;
"Oh, but you ought-if only to show peo-&#xD;
ple how charmingly you mean to live l I must&#xD;
speak to Leslie, and make her persuade you&#xD;
to do it. Mrs. Middleton, don't you think he&#xD;
ought? People who have pretty, old places,&#xD;
and don't use them, should be obliged to give&#xD;
them to people who would. I agree with the&#xD;
socialists that far!"&#xD;
"Suppose you take Strafford off my hands,&#xD;
then?" said he, laughing, but scarcely conceal-&#xD;
ing the fact that he was exceedingly bored.&#xD;
He looked round for Leslie, but, when Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton's appearance had relieved Miss&#xD;
Gri~hame from the duties of hostess, she had&#xD;
taken Captain Tyndale out into the gar-&#xD;
den.&#xD;
"I think I have heard you say that you&#xD;
like roses," she said to him. "Come and&#xD;
look at ours. They are in their glory."&#xD;
He assented willingly-as, indeed, he would&#xD;
have been apt to assent to any thing which&#xD;
she proposed. Leslie was not at all aware of&#xD;
the, peculiar regard which this somewhat im-&#xD;
passive soldier entertained for her. She might&#xD;
have been flattered if she had known that&#xD;
she embodied to him more of tho gentleness&#xD;
and refinement, the sweetness ,and grace of&#xD;
womanhood, than he had ever met b~f'ore in&#xD;
the whole courSe of his life. Like most tn~n&#xD;
of his elass-.-men of active pursuits and re-&#xD;
fined tastes -~ he had little fancy for the&#xD;
order of women technically called "loud."&#xD;

A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
ARRIVAL OF NORAH DESMOND.&#xD;
&#xD;
He had flirted with them, talked of them,&#xD;
toasted them, perhaps-but, all the ,pame, he&#xD;
had his ideal, with which not one of these&#xD;
modern heroines had a single attribute in&#xD;
common. This ideal was one that in the&#xD;
masculine mind has no doubt existed since&#xD;
the days of Adam-a gentle, graceful, femi-&#xD;
nine abstraction, hedged about with a divine&#xD;
atmosphere of high - breeding and heavenly&#xD;
virtues. To this ideal Miss Grahame ap-&#xD;
proached very closely, and she had conse-&#xD;
quently proved very attractive to him - so&#xD;
attractive, indeed, that if Arthur Tyndale's&#xD;
suit had not been very far advanced before&#xD;
his cousin came on the scene, there is no&#xD;
telling how soon Max might have laid his lau-&#xD;
rels of Algiers and Gravelotte at Leslie's feet.&#xD;
Neither is it possible to tell what success&#xD;
he might havewon. The mind grows dizzy&#xD;
in considering what toys of circumstance we&#xD;
are -how absolutely and entirely the whole&#xD;
course and meaning of our lives seem to hinge&#xD;
on the idlest turns of chance. Thinking of&#xD;
these things, we feel like children in the dark,&#xD;
fearing to take a step in any direction lest we&#xD;
should encounter some unforeseen disaster, or&#xD;
avoid some great good. If Max Tyndale had&#xD;
come into Leslie's life before his cousin, and&#xD;
had gained, perhaps - for many unlikelier&#xD;
things have happened-his cousin's place in&#xD;
her heart, one thing at least might have been&#xD;
predicted, that, although society would have&#xD;
been more chary of its compliments, and&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Middleton probably less suave&#xD;
in their consent, Leslie herself would never&#xD;
have had to fear the dissimulation which Ar-&#xD;
thur Tyndale had already displayed, nor the&#xD;
treachery which he might yet display.&#xD;
Such thoughts as these were very far from&#xD;
her mind, however, as she walked down the&#xD;
garden-paths, pointing out her favorite roses&#xD;
to Ma~x, and laughing over his lamentable ig-&#xD;
norance of rose-nomenclature.&#xD;
"I confess that I don't know much about&#xD;
the names of flowers," he said, at last, with&#xD;
unnecessary candor. "It always seemed to&#xD;
me a matter of very small importance. They&#xD;
are meant to be sources of enjoyment-not&#xD;
occasions of study, or weary exercise of the&#xD;
,memory."&#xD;
"But it is not weary to people who love&#xD;
roses to remember that this is a Malmaison,&#xD;
and that a Noisette," said Leslie, smiling.&#xD;
"When will those who don't like certain&#xD;
things comprehend that others may like them?&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, I should think there was nothing in the&#xD;
world half so tiresome as military tactics!"&#xD;
"But that has use in it," said he.&#xD;
"And do you think there is no use in&#xD;
flowers because one does not often 'brain a&#xD;
tyrant with a rose?'"&#xD;
"There is use in them, as there is use in&#xD;
music and poetry," said Max, who, it must be&#xD;
confessed, was rather utilitarian than aesthetic&#xD;
in his bias. "The world would be a much&#xD;
darker and narrower place without them."&#xD;
"While with them~ what a bright and&#xD;
happy place it is!" said Leslie, lifting her fair&#xD;
face to the sunset glow. "Do you know)"&#xD;
she went on, suddenly, speaking almost wist-&#xD;
fully, "that I sometimes think I have too&#xD;
many of the gooi things of life for one per-&#xD;
son? Sometimes it strikes me that I must&#xD;
surely hitve some one else's share of prosperi-&#xD;
ty besides my own. I have never had a trou-&#xD;
ble-nor the least shade of a trouble-in my&#xD;
life; and now I am so very happy! "-she&#xD;
spoke with the simplicity of a child-" surely&#xD;
it is not right-I mean, surely it is more than&#xD;
I deserve."&#xD;
"1 think it is quite right," said Max.&#xD;
'"Nobody ever deserved the good gifts of For-&#xD;
tune more than you do, and hereafter I shall&#xD;
think better of the jade for having shown so&#xD;
much discrimination for once."&#xD;
"You are jesting, while I am in earnest,"&#xD;
said she, looking at him with her soft gray&#xD;
eyes. "You cannot tell how often I have&#xD;
thought of this, lately. Every thing about&#xD;
my life is so bright-surely too bright to last!&#xD;
1~ cannot dismiss the idea that some trouble&#xD;
ijiust be in store to counterbalance it all."&#xD;
"You are wrong to indulge such thoughts,"&#xD;
said Max, seriously. "You are darkening&#xD;
the present sunshine by forebodings of clouds&#xD;
that come sooa enough in every life."&#xD;
"I never had such forebodings before,"&#xD;
said she.&#xD;
He was on the point of answering, "Be-&#xD;
cause you never before put your happiness&#xD;
into the keeping of another," but he re-&#xD;
strained the words in time. It was true&#xD;
enough; but why should he say it? Why&#xD;
should he put the fact-which might yet be&#xD;
a grim one-plainly before Leslie? He could&#xD;
not, however, help wondering if any subtle&#xD;
distrust of Arthur caused the foreboding to&#xD;
which she alluded; and, strangely enough,&#xD;
Leslie - with a woman s quick instinct -&#xD;
turned to answer the suspicion.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I don't think any woman ever had better&#xD;
assurances of happiness than I have,'Z she&#xD;
said. "And it is because I am so particular-&#xD;
ly-so d~xceptionally-fortunate, that I feel in&#xD;
this way."&#xD;
"I understand," said Captain Tyndale.&#xD;
"It is natural enough. And yet, if I might&#xD;
venture to advise, I would beg you, to enjoy&#xD;
the present and let the future take care of it-&#xD;
self; since you cannot-like the Greek king&#xD;
in one of Schiller's ballads-throw a ring into&#xD;
the sea as a propitiation to the gods."&#xD;
"Perhaps my propitiation might be re-&#xD;
jected, as that of poor Polycrates was," said&#xD;
Leslie, smiling. Then she added more grave-&#xD;
ly: "We are both talking~ like heathens. Of&#xD;
course, I know who give~ both good and ill&#xD;
fortune; and, while I am grateful for the&#xD;
first, I trust I should neither dcspaii nor&#xD;
rebel under the last."&#xD;
"I am sure you would not," said Max.&#xD;
"If I put my heel on that lily," he said,&#xD;
pointing to one in a bed near by, "it would&#xD;
be none the less sweet after it was crushed.&#xD;
Such is the nature of lilies."&#xD;
Leslie laughed a little. "You are very&#xD;
kind," she said. Then, feeling thu t the con-&#xD;
versation was becoming too personal, she&#xD;
changed it with her graceful tact. "I am&#xD;
old-fashioned enough to love these pure white&#xD;
lilies"' she said, stooping to pull one. "Our&#xD;
neighbor, Mrs. Moncure, who has a great&#xD;
many varieties of new - fashioned Japanese&#xD;
lilies, quite scorns them."&#xD;
"As I should probably scorn the Japanese&#xD;
lilies, if I saw them," said Max. "Who&#xD;
cares for those gaudy, striped things? One&#xD;
might as well have a tulip or a peony. But&#xD;
the lily of tradition and of poetry-the flower&#xD;
of the Annunciation-thefleur de us of France&#xD;
-the emblem of purity and fragrance-the&#xD;
symbol of the saints-one cazmnot love that&#xD;
too well."&#xD;
"So I think," said Leslie. "And I am&#xD;
glad that there is one flower about which you&#xD;
know how to be enthusiastic," she added,&#xD;
"though I famicy it is not so much the flower&#xD;
as its associations that please you. Now,&#xD;
shall we go back to the drawing-room? Per-&#xD;
haps Arthur has finished his flirtation with&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford by this time. It is a good&#xD;
thing that I am not jealous, is it not?"&#xD;
"A very good thing," he answered. But,&#xD;
as they turned their steps toward the draW-&#xD;
inn-room, he could not help wondering wheth-&#xD;
&#xD;
er a real cause for jealousy would not shatter&#xD;
this sweet, placid calm. us heart misgave&#xD;
him-or, to speak more correctly, his judg-&#xD;
ment warned him-concerning the probable&#xD;
result of Arthur's meeting with Norah Des-&#xD;
mond. "Unstable as water," seemed in Max's&#xD;
mind a text specially suited to his cousin;&#xD;
and, like most men of cool, determined char-&#xD;
acter, he felt something closely akin to con-&#xD;
tempt for the other's shifting vacillation. "If&#xD;
I have any influence over him, he'll keep&#xD;
straight with regard to 1/mis!" he thought.&#xD;
Much as she liked him, Leslie had little idea&#xD;
whpt a champion had buckled on armor in&#xD;
her behalf.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
"A woman in whom majesty and wetnesss&#xD;
Blend to such issues of serene completeness,&#xD;
That to gaze on her were a prince's boon!&#xD;
The calm ot evening, the large pomp of noon,&#xD;
Are hers; soft May moms, melting June&#xD;
Hold not such tender languishments as those&#xD;
Which steep her in that dew-light of repose,&#xD;
That floats a dreamy balm around the full-blown&#xD;
rose."&#xD;
MAY and June passed - burdening the&#xD;
earth with their wealth of fragrant bloom-&#xD;
'and it was on one of the earlier days of July&#xD;
that Miss Grahame's pony-carriage drove up&#xD;
to the station of Wexford, distant seventeen&#xD;
miles from Alton, just before the down ex-&#xD;
press was due at 5.40 in'. ii. The Middleton&#xD;
household, with all its belongings, had been&#xD;
domesticated, for a month or more, at Ros-&#xD;
land; but the day before this, Mr. Middleton&#xD;
had gone up to* the city to meet Miss Dc~-&#xD;
mond, who telegraphed an announcement of&#xD;
her safe arrival on American shores.&#xD;
"Jump down and go round to their heads,&#xD;
Guy," Leslie said to the groom, as she checked&#xD;
her horses. "I hear the train coming, and&#xD;
Romulus is always foolish. S-oh-steady,&#xD;
sir!"&#xD;
She pulled in the reins sharply-it was&#xD;
surprising how much vigor was in those slen-&#xD;
der wrists-as one of the ponies threw up his&#xD;
head nervously; but Guy-a lithe, half-grown&#xD;
boy-was on the ground and at their bits&#xD;
when the engine, with its long train of vibrat-&#xD;
ing cars, came shrieking and whistling, like a&#xD;
lunatic fiend, around a curve.&#xD;
As it drew up with one short, defiant snort&#xD;
before the station-, not a few dusty women&#xD;

26                 A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.                                               ON THE WAY TO ROSLAND.                 27&#xD;
&#xD;
and linen-coated men looked out, with that&#xD;
interest which any passing event always&#xD;
arouses in the traveling mind, at the pretty,&#xD;
low-swung phaeton, the white ponies hand-&#xD;
somely set off by blue reins, and the graceful&#xD;
girl, whose fresh, summer costume was not&#xD;
concealed by the carriage-wrap drawn partly&#xD;
over it.&#xD;
"Oh, how charming I Shouldn't you like&#xD;
to have it?" said one or 'two enthusiastic&#xD;
young ladies, referring, in a lucid way, to the&#xD;
phaeton and ponies.&#xD;
"Very neat turnout!" said one or two&#xD;
men, approvingly.&#xD;
"Amazingly pretty girl, by George!"&#xD;
added several others, staring at the delicate&#xD;
face, which was half turned away from&#xD;
them.&#xD;
- For, unconscious of the admiration which&#xD;
her equipage and herself were exciting, Leslie&#xD;
was gazing eagerly along the platform for the&#xD;
appearance of her uncle and his companion.&#xD;
She could with difficulty realize that she was&#xD;
about to meet the sister whom she had never&#xD;
seen, and her heart was beating nervously.&#xD;
What would she be like? Had she (Leslie)&#xD;
done well or ill? Another minute would de-&#xD;
cide something at least.&#xD;
"Do you see any signs of them, Guy?"&#xD;
she asked of the groom, who was in a better'&#xD;
position for observation than hcr~elf.&#xD;
"Yes'm-yonder comes master," lie an-&#xD;
swered.&#xD;
Leslie's heart gave a leap-into her throat,&#xD;
it seemed-as Mr. Middleton, with a lady on&#xD;
his arm, emerged from the fluctuating crowd&#xD;
around the cars, and advanced towiird her.&#xD;
She stepped from the phaeton, and, even at&#xD;
that moment-so quick is the feminine eye-&#xD;
she saw that her sister was tall, and walked&#xD;
with remarkable grace.&#xD;
"Well, Leslie, here she is!" said Mr. Mid-&#xD;
dkton, as they met.' "I suppose there's no&#xD;
need to introduce' you to each other."&#xD;
"I should think not, indeed!" said Leslie,&#xD;
with her sweut smile. "0 Noruh, how glad&#xD;
I am to see 'you, dear!"&#xD;
She put' out both hands as she spoke: her&#xD;
whole heart seemed quivering on the lips that&#xD;
touched the fair ~'ace slightly bent toward&#xD;
her. Absorbed in herown 'enlotion, she did&#xD;
not feel-what Mr. Middleton obsnrved-.-that&#xD;
the eager warmth of her greethig was 'rather&#xD;
received than resumed~'&#xD;
"Thanks-you are very kind," said the&#xD;
&#xD;
stranger, in a voice which, though musical, was&#xD;
slightly cold. "I hope we shall like each other'&#xD;
"I am sure of it," said Leslie, quickly.&#xD;
"You must not 'hope' such a thing, because&#xD;
to hope implies a little doubt.-Come, put her&#xD;
in the phaeton, uncle. I brought it because&#xD;
I wanted her all to myself. The barouche is&#xD;
here for you."&#xD;
"That is a good thing," said Mr. Middle-&#xD;
ten, as he assisted Miss Uesmcind into the&#xD;
luxurious little carriage. "Things always&#xD;
happen, and people turn up, just when they&#xD;
are not expected," he went on, philosophical-&#xD;
ly. "To my surprise, I met Carl in the city.&#xD;
He came down with us, and is looking after&#xD;
the trunks just now."&#xD;
"Carl!" repeated Leslie, astonished at&#xD;
this off-hand announcement. "But I thought&#xD;
Carl was iii Germany?"&#xD;
"So did I, until I met him in Alton," an-&#xD;
swered Mr. Middleton. Then, as the train&#xD;
moved ofl he glanced round. "Here he&#xD;
comes," he said, carelessly. This indifference&#xD;
was his way of showing the vexation he felt&#xD;
at the neglect which had so long delayed that&#xD;
coming.&#xD;
Leslie turned also. A young man in a&#xD;
gray traveling-suit aud cap was advancing&#xD;
down the platform, with the light and pecul-&#xD;
iarly springy step that few men retain after&#xD;
twenty-three or four-a good-looking young&#xD;
fellow, with a rich dash of auburn in his&#xD;
brown hair and eyes and brows that might&#xD;
have been painted to match. lie wore no&#xD;
beard, and his flexible tips curled upward at&#xD;
the corners, as those of a laughter-loving na-&#xD;
ture always do, while there was a gleam of&#xD;
fun in his eyes' Which often tried the patience&#xD;
of soberly - disposed people very severely.&#xD;
This was the lighter side of Carl Middleton's&#xD;
character, however. That there was another,&#xD;
those who knew him well were thoroughly&#xD;
aware. The dash of red in his haii-~ together&#xD;
with one Or two straight lines betwecit the&#xD;
brows, were sufficient indicationH of the pas-&#xD;
sionate though somewhat volatilee vehemence&#xD;
that always accumnpal1ie~ the mercurial tem-&#xD;
* perament, in feeling' arid action;&#xD;
"You are surprised to ~ee me, are 'you&#xD;
not ?"' he said, after the fir~t' gveetin~ be-&#xD;
tween Leslie and himself was over. ''~ You&#xD;
didn't imagine' that' J~ 'had been 'Miss l~cs.&#xD;
mond's traveling companion? Uncle ~4e'drge's&#xD;
face' was a study when' he met us in Alton&#xD;
this moruaing!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Did you come over with Norab?" said&#xD;
Leslie, with surprise. "You are certainly the&#xD;
most incomprehensible person! Why did you&#xD;
not write to say that you were. coming, or&#xD;
why did you not telegraph when you ar-&#xD;
rived ?"&#xD;
"Why should I have done either?" asked&#xD;
he. "Here I am all right, and I did not ex-&#xD;
pect anybody to meet me. I made up my mind&#xD;
to sail at an hour's notice. By Jove, Leslie!&#xD;
-may I say how much you are improved? I&#xD;
should have come home a year ago if I had&#xD;
known you were as pretty as this!"&#xD;
"Should you? "said Leslie. "It is a good&#xD;
thing you did not know it, then; I am sure&#xD;
you must have enjoyed the year much more&#xD;
in Europe than you would have done here.&#xD;
You have improved, too, since you were a&#xD;
red-haired boy, and the 'torment of my life,"&#xD;
she added, smiling. "I am very glad to see&#xD;
it, and very glad to see you, too; but I must&#xD;
really go now, for I cannot keep Norah wait-&#xD;
ing while we exchange complimeiils. That&#xD;
can be done at our leisure when we reach&#xD;
Rosland."&#xD;
"And how am I to reach Rosland?" he&#xD;
asked, as lie assisted her into the phaeton,&#xD;
where Miss Desmond was seated, leaning back&#xD;
on the low seat, and looking meditatively at&#xD;
the ponies.&#xD;
"You are to go in the barouche with&#xD;
uncle," answered Leslie, gathering up her&#xD;
reins.-" Come, Guy!"&#xD;
"~iIay not I play tiger fqr once? "asked&#xD;
Carl,' holding Guy back at arili's-length, much&#xD;
to that bebuttoned individual's surprise.&#xD;
"No, you may not," answered Miss Gra-&#xD;
hame, decidedly. "You are to go with uncle;&#xD;
and I have no doubt that the freedom to smoke&#xD;
a cigar will amply console you for the loss of&#xD;
our society."&#xD;
"You think so because you don't know&#xD;
how much I should enjoy your society," said&#xD;
he. But he released Guy, who was in his seat&#xD;
in a moment.&#xD;
"We'll be along, Leslie, as soon as the&#xD;
servants have managed to dispose of Miss&#xD;
Desmond's trunks," said Mr. Middleton, who&#xD;
was standing by the barouche.&#xD;
Leslie nodded, and, flicking Romulus and&#xD;
Remus lightly with the whip, the phaeton&#xD;
bowled easily down a green country lane, leav-&#xD;
ing Carl standing with his cap off watching&#xD;
them as they drove away.&#xD;
Then it was that Miss Grahame began to&#xD;
&#xD;
be conscious that her companion had not&#xD;
spoken since their first greeting; and, anx-&#xD;
ious to avoid any thing like awkwardness,&#xD;
she plunged at once into conversation-fall-&#xD;
ing, of course, upon an undeniable common-&#xD;
place:&#xD;
"I am afraid you have had such a warm,&#xD;
dusty day' for traveling."&#xD;
"It has not been agreeable," answered&#xD;
her companion, in the same musical voice&#xD;
which had struck her in its first utterance-.-&#xD;
a voice that spoke English with a slightly&#xD;
foreign accent-" but summer traveling never&#xD;
is agreeable, I fancy One must always ex-&#xD;
pect heat and dust."&#xD;
"But at least I hope your ocean-voyage&#xD;
was pleasant ?"&#xD;
"Yes-very. I always enjoy the ocean.&#xD;
There is nothing like it in tIme world, I&#xD;
think."&#xD;
"So do I-though I have never seen very&#xD;
much of it. And it was pleasant that Carl&#xD;
should have crossed with you! I hope he&#xD;
found you out soon-I mean, found out who&#xD;
you were?"&#xD;
"He did not need to find me out," was&#xD;
the quiet but very unexpected reply. "We&#xD;
knew each other before. It came in his way&#xD;
to do papa some slight favor in Paris last&#xD;
spring; and so I had already met him."&#xD;
" Met him!" exclaimed Leslie - "met&#xD;
Carl !" She was so taken aback by this&#xD;
third surprise, that for a minute she could&#xD;
say nothing more. Then she added, on the&#xD;
first impulse of astonishment: "How very&#xD;
extraordinary I - I mean how very singular&#xD;
that he should never have mentioned it~"&#xD;
"I am not sure that it was singular," said&#xD;
Miss Desmond, indifferently- though an in-&#xD;
crease of color rose into her face - "the fact&#xD;
may have escaped his mind as one of alight&#xD;
importance, or he may not have considered&#xD;
us in the light of very desirable acquaint-&#xD;
ances.- Certainly we are not people of whose&#xD;
social countenance any one is likely tob~ast."&#xD;
"Norah !" said Leslie, almost indignantly.&#xD;
A tide of blood came into ker face, a thrill&#xD;
of reproach into her voice. "How can you&#xD;
speak so!" she went on quickly. "It would&#xD;
be unjust to Carl if you meant it in earnest.&#xD;
Even in jest, it i~ unjust to yourself."&#xD;
h ~ beg your pardon," said the other. "I&#xD;
forgot that you did n~t understand how We&#xD;
Bohemians feel. I forgot,~ also, that Kate's&#xD;
!ast injunction was to beg me not to shook&#xD;

28                   A DAUGll ~ER OF BOHEMIA.                                                  MRS. MIDDLETON'S SUSPICIONS.                 29&#xD;
&#xD;
you. 'Remember that you arc going among&#xD;
respectable people,' she said, and 'try to be&#xD;
respectable too.'"&#xD;
"Try to be respectable!" repeated Les-&#xD;
lie, smiling-it was impossible not to smile at&#xD;
the humor in Norah's eyes, as she uttered&#xD;
the last words-" but are you not respectable&#xD;
already? If you are not, pray tell me what&#xD;
coastitutes respectability."&#xD;
"A gig, does it not ?" asked Miss Des-&#xD;
mond, qui~e innocently. "You know Carlyle&#xD;
says so. I suppose your ph~ieton-how pretty&#xD;
it is, by-the-by ! - might come under that&#xD;
head."&#xD;
"Let us hope so, at least," was the reply.&#xD;
"Then we shall be able to esteem ourselves&#xD;
safely respectable for the time being. Not&#xD;
but that respectability is a very good thing in&#xD;
its way," Miss Grahanie pursued, reflectively-&#xD;
thinking, perhaps, that it would be as well to&#xD;
give a slight admonition to her companion-&#xD;
"and women ia especial are apt to fare very&#xD;
badly if they venture to disregard its codes.&#xD;
You look as if you' t ought that a very stale&#xD;
commonplace. So it is; but many stale things&#xD;
are true things none the less. Now, I am not&#xD;
easily shocked, dear, but I hope you will for-&#xD;
give me when I say that many other people&#xD;
are."&#xD;
There was so much of gentle wistfulness&#xD;
in this last sentence that it would have been&#xD;
impossible for the most irascible person to be&#xD;
provoked by it; and Norah Desmond only&#xD;
'smiled.&#xD;
"I suppose you are thinking of your own&#xD;
people," she said. "Well, I shall try not to&#xD;
shock them. Bohemian though I am, I can&#xD;
play qrande dame then I like."&#xD;
"I think Nature intended that you should&#xD;
play it all the time," said Leslie, with a glance&#xD;
of involuntary admiration at the beautiful&#xD;
face, which was also a proud face.&#xD;
"No," was the careless reply. "Noth-&#xD;
ing cramps and wearies me more. I am like&#xD;
my father, who seems to have something of&#xD;
the gypsy in him-something which always&#xD;
has made him unable to endure the pressure&#xD;
of conventional respectability very long."&#xD;
"I hope she will not say any thing like&#xD;
that to Aunt Mildred," thought Leslie, half&#xD;
amused and half dismayed to imagine the&#xD;
manner in which Mrs. Midclleton would re-&#xD;
gard such a declaration, as realizing her&#xD;
worst fears of what Mr. Desinond's daughter&#xD;
might be. A slight sensation of foreboding&#xD;
&#xD;
beganto come over Mtss Grahame as she ap-&#xD;
preciated more clearly than she had done be-&#xD;
fore the nature of the jarring elements sh~&#xD;
was about to bring together. What would&#xD;
be the end of it? Would Norah gracefully&#xD;
conciliate the prejudices which were already&#xD;
in arms against her, or would she openly&#xD;
brave and defy them?. With all her anxiety&#xD;
that the former course should be adopted,&#xD;
Leslie could not bring herself to. ofrer a&#xD;
stronger hint than she had already utte,~cd.&#xD;
And so it was that, for a little time, silence&#xD;
fell. The ponies trotted along a level strete~i&#xD;
of well-shaded road, with the slanting gold&#xD;
of the sunlight streaming in serene glory&#xD;
through the brown trunks of the trees, and&#xD;
on the green depths of the foliage, while Guy,&#xD;
sitting bolt upright in his tiny seat, absorbed&#xD;
in the contemplation of his buttons, took a&#xD;
short nap, and nearly fell ofT before Miss&#xD;
Desmond spoke again:&#xD;
"I ~ no idea you lived in the country.&#xD;
I thought your uncle had a house in the city&#xD;
-4lton, isn't it ?-wherc he met me to-day."&#xD;
''We do not live in the country,'' Leslie&#xD;
answered. "We have only come down to&#xD;
Roslaud for the summer. Our home is in&#xD;
Alton."&#xD;
"Ah, I see !-you are at your country-&#xD;
honac 4 la grand seigneur. But have you&#xD;
much of a neighborhood? Pastoral seclusion&#xD;
may be exceedingly elegant, but it is also&#xD;
~-ery apt to be dull, I think."&#xD;
"There is something of a neighborhood-&#xD;
enough, I hope, to keep you from being disH."&#xD;
"I was not thinking of myself~" was the&#xD;
quiet reply. "All modes of life come alike&#xD;
to me. I fancy I have run the gamut of&#xD;
them, from highest to lowest. Consequently,&#xD;
I have learned a very useful philosophy,&#xD;
which enables mc to be resigned to any thing&#xD;
and surprised at nothing." Then, as they&#xD;
drove by the palings of a green park, full of&#xD;
massive old trees, through which the chim-&#xD;
neys and gables of a house were visible, she&#xD;
added, "That looks as if it might be a pretty&#xD;
place." ~&#xD;
"It is a pretty place," said Leslie, with&#xD;
the guelder - rose color deepening on her&#xD;
cheek, "the prettiest in the country, I&#xD;
think, though there are several ~iore hand-&#xD;
some, hind many better kept up."&#xD;
"Who is the owner?" asked Miss Des-&#xD;
mond, lifting her veil for the first time and&#xD;
leaning forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
"A person of whom you have heard," an-&#xD;
swered Leslie. "This is the Tyndale place,&#xD;
and belongs to Arthur-the Arthur of whom&#xD;
I have written you."&#xD;
It was a quick interjection, uttered more&#xD;
to herself than to her companion, but Leslie&#xD;
thought that it denoted interest, and went&#xD;
on:&#xD;
"The house is picturesque, as you see,&#xD;
and quite old-that is, for any thing Ameri-&#xD;
can. No doubt you would think it very mod-&#xD;
ern, It has been in the family for several&#xD;
generations, and came to Arthur when he&#xD;
was a mere boy. He had not seen it for&#xD;
years until this summer; but lie has been so&#xD;
much surprised and delighted by its beauty&#xD;
that I think it will be' his principal home&#xD;
hereafter."&#xD;
Miss Desinond made no reply. It would&#xD;
have been only courteous, it seemed, if she&#xD;
had evinced a little interest in the subject&#xD;
thus introduced; but she gave no response&#xD;
by word or look to Leslie's speech. All her&#xD;
admiration of the Tyndale place suddenly ap-&#xD;
ped~rcd to vanish. She leaned back without&#xD;
another glance toward it, but she did not&#xD;
draw down her veil, and so it was that, for&#xD;
the first time, Leslie saw what she looked&#xD;
like.&#xD;
Now, as a general rule, it would be doping&#xD;
a woman gross injustice to judge of her looks&#xD;
when she has just ended a long and fatiguing&#xD;
journey; but there are particular cases, as&#xD;
'well as general rules, and it will be readily&#xD;
admitted that, if a woman is found to bear&#xD;
such a severe test with even moderate suc-&#xD;
cess, it may be safely predicated of her, as&#xD;
of Olivia, that her beauty "is in the grain,&#xD;
and will endure wind and weather." This&#xD;
test Norah Desmond stood triumphantly.&#xD;
Even Leslie, with that greatest medium for&#xD;
flattery of our day-a painted photograph-&#xD;
in her mind, could not think that she had&#xD;
ever seen a more beautiful face than the one&#xD;
beside her. Ij~ was not only the regular,&#xD;
clearly-cut features, the skin white as milk&#xD;
and smooth as marble, the scarlet lips so&#xD;
proudly curved and firmly closed, the rich&#xD;
masses of hair, chestnut in the shade, spun&#xD;
gold in the sun, nor the large, full eyes, also&#xD;
chestnut in tint -as the old chronicles tell&#xD;
us that Mary Stuart's were-which fascinated&#xD;
her so much. It was something deeper and&#xD;
more subtle than the mere loveliness of flesh&#xD;
&#xD;
and blood. Listless as the face looked, it&#xD;
was not cold; quiet as it seemed, it was not&#xD;
tame. On the contrary, it was easy to tell&#xD;
that it possessed, in superlative degree, that&#xD;
mobility of feature which distinguishes the&#xD;
Irish physiognomy; that a magnetism not&#xD;
to be put into words might dwell in the smile&#xD;
of the lips, a something almost akin to majes-&#xD;
ty shine out of ,the magnificent depths of&#xD;
the eyes. "I think I shall certainly like&#xD;
her!" Leslie thought, and at that moment&#xD;
the eyes in question turned and met her&#xD;
own.&#xD;
"Well," said their possessor, quietly,&#xD;
"what do you think of me? Am I as pretty&#xD;
as my likeness?" /&#xD;
"I beg your pardon," said Leslie, quick-&#xD;
ly. "I did not mean to be rude. But you&#xD;
must be accustomed to staring by this time, I&#xD;
should think."&#xD;
"You were not rude," said the other.&#xD;
"It was very natural you should look at me.&#xD;
I only wanted to know if you are disappoint-&#xD;
ed in my appearance. Kate said that the&#xD;
photograph I sent you was flattered."&#xD;
"Tell Kate that she was never more mis-&#xD;
taken," said Miss Grahame, warmly. "I&#xD;
thought the photograph lovely, hut you-you&#xD;
arc far more beautiful than it is."&#xD;
"Thanks!" said Norah. But she must&#xD;
have been well used to compliments, for her&#xD;
color did not deepen in the least even at those&#xD;
enthusiastic words.&#xD;
A few minutes later they 'entered the&#xD;
gates of Rosland, and were bowling rapidly&#xD;
around the carriage-drive to the front of the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
"It is not much of a place," Leslie said,&#xD;
half apologetically.&#xD;
"At least it looks very pretty," Norah&#xD;
truthfully answered.&#xD;
It did look pretty, undoubtedly. There&#xD;
were no pretensions to architectural effect,&#xD;
but home-like grace and lightness everywhere.&#xD;
A green lawn sloped away into 'a flowex~-gar-&#xD;
den on one side, and into shrubbery on the&#xD;
other; a veranda, with arches overrun by&#xD;
creepers, had chairs, books, and work, set&#xD;
out on it, and lace-draped windows behind.&#xD;
The wide hall, with its open doors, looked&#xD;
spacious and aii'y, there was a fragrance of-&#xD;
flowers in the atmosphere, and the sinking&#xD;
sun sent a flood of golden light across the&#xD;
close-shaven lawn ~o the thick-set hedge be-&#xD;
yond.&#xD;

A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMiA.                                             A FAMILY GATHERING.                31&#xD;
&#xD;
Leslie reined up Romulus and Remus be.&#xD;
fore the, door, and, giving the reins to Guy,&#xD;
turned to her sister:&#xD;
"Welcome to Rosland, Norali 1" she&#xD;
said, eagerly. "I hope we may make you&#xD;
happy, dear! I am sure it makes me very&#xD;
happy to know that you are with us. And&#xD;
here is Aunt Mildred to bid you welcome,&#xD;
too."&#xD;
This Mrs. Middleton did with a very&#xD;
charmii~g grace and cordiality. Certainly&#xD;
the young stranger who had come so entirely&#xD;
unknowing and unknown among them could&#xD;
not complain that any thing was lacking in&#xD;
her welcome which the most carping spirit&#xD;
of exaction might have required. After many&#xD;
kind greetings had been uttered, and every&#xD;
possible want of tired Nature anticipated, she&#xD;
was left alone in the chamber to which she&#xD;
had been conducted; and theh Leslie came&#xD;
back and stood in a triumphant glow before&#xD;
her aunt.&#xD;
"Well, Aunt Mildred; what do you think&#xD;
of her?" she cried. "Is she not superbly&#xD;
beautiful?"&#xD;
"She is very handsome," said Mrs. Mid-&#xD;
dleton. She spoke readily and not at all as&#xD;
if the admission irked her, which it certainly&#xD;
did. "But she is not in the least like your&#xD;
mother, Leslie. I cannot trace the faintest&#xD;
resemblance between the two faces."&#xD;
"I wish she were like mamma," said Lea.&#xD;
lie; "and yet she is so lovely that it would&#xD;
be wrong to desire any change in her. Did&#xD;
you ever see such a complexion, or such eyes,&#xD;
QS such hair?"&#xD;
"It certainly is a very striking kind of&#xD;
beauty," said Mrs. Middleton. "As a mat-&#xD;
ter of individual taste, I like something&#xD;
quieter and more refined; but, of course, no..&#xD;
body can deny that she is very fine.looking."&#xD;
"Fine-looking! She is much more than&#xD;
that," said Leslie, aggrieved at hearing the&#xD;
beauty to which she had done generous hom-&#xD;
age, damned by such faint praise. "She is&#xD;
perfectly lovely! Wait until you 4e her&#xD;
better dressed and less dusty."&#xD;
"I never knew you so enthusiastic be-&#xD;
fore," said Mrs. Middleton, with a smile that&#xD;
was rather deprecating.&#xD;
"You never knew me before when I had&#xD;
just met a sister whom I am sure I'can ad-&#xD;
mire, and whom I hope I can love," answered&#xD;
Leslie, warmly.&#xD;
"My dear!" said Mrs.' Middleton, in an&#xD;
&#xD;
expostulatory tone. She looked at the eager&#xD;
face before her, while a shade of the intense&#xD;
prejudice she felt against the new-coiner fell&#xD;
over her own. But ~he was too wise as well&#xD;
as too high-bred to say any thing which would&#xD;
be "sharp," or likely to wound Leslie. So&#xD;
she smiled again, but, more faintly. "Don't&#xD;
be in too much haste to give more than ad-&#xD;
miration," she said. "Wait until you know&#xD;
something of what lies under that handsome&#xD;
face before you bestow the love of which you&#xD;
speak."&#xD;
"I think I know something of it already,"&#xD;
answered Leslie-in whose excuse it may be&#xD;
said that she was not prone often to the folly&#xD;
of such rash judgment-" I am sure she has&#xD;
a noble character, though it has been warped&#xD;
by circumstalwes. Please remember that,&#xD;
Aunt Mildred," the eager voice went on.&#xD;
"Please, in judging her, remember how dif-&#xD;
ferent her life has been from ours."&#xD;
"But that is the worst thing against her,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Middleton, who felt her heart hard-&#xD;
ening momently. "Do you not see that,&#xD;
though it may be an excuse, it is also a&#xD;
ground for distrust? 0 Leslie, I am so sorry&#xD;
that you have taken a fancy to the girl! Such&#xD;
impulses are always unwise, but in this in-&#xD;
stance you may be preparing more of annoy-&#xD;
ance and suffering for yourself than you can&#xD;
imagine."&#xD;
"I trust not," said Leslie, in her frank,&#xD;
loyal voice. "But, even if it were so, it was&#xD;
of Norah, and not of myself, I thought, in&#xD;
sending for her. That for which I was and&#xD;
am most amixious is to help her life, to do her&#xD;
good; and if this can be compassed, even at&#xD;
the cost of a little annoyance and suffering to&#xD;
myself, I shall not regret it. I confess, how-&#xD;
ever, that I can eec no cause to fear any thing&#xD;
of the kind."&#xD;
"I hope with nil my heart that you may&#xD;
be right," said Mrs. Middleton, with a sigh&#xD;
which was imbued with the strongest possi-&#xD;
ble skepticism. "It is certainly too late now&#xD;
.to undo what has been done. But where is&#xD;
your uncle? Surely the barouche ought to&#xD;
have been here before this."&#xD;
"I left him at Wexford with Carl" re-&#xD;
plied Leslie. "By-the-by, I have been so en-&#xD;
grossed with Norah tfaat I have forgotten to&#xD;
tell you Carl has arrived."&#xD;
"Carl !" echoed Mrs. Mi'ldleron, in a tone&#xD;
of incredulous amazement. "Why, Carl is&#xD;
in Europe!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Just what I said to uncle," answered&#xD;
Leslie, composedly. "But, of course, that&#xD;
argument fell to the ground when Carl ap-&#xD;
peared in person. You will be glad to hear&#xD;
that he has grown amazingly, and is really&#xD;
very good-looking."&#xD;
"Carl!" repeated Mrs. Middleton again,&#xD;
as if she could not credit her own ears.&#xD;
"But what is the meaning of it? Why did&#xD;
he not let us know when he left Europe?&#xD;
how long has he been in America?"&#xD;
"He caine over in tIme same steamer with&#xD;
Norah, he says. I asked him why he had&#xD;
not written, but he only laughed, and said&#xD;
that he made up his mind at an hour's notice,&#xD;
or something of that kind. Men can do sue!'&#xD;
things, you know. Yonder comes the ba-&#xD;
rouche now, so you can question him at your&#xD;
leisure. As for me, I nmust go and dress for&#xD;
dinner."&#xD;
She left the room-Mrs. Middleton offer-&#xD;
ing no opposition-and went up-stairs just as&#xD;
the barouche drove to the door. Pausing a&#xD;
moment to glance over the balustrade, there&#xD;
was a sparkle of amusement on her face which&#xD;
might have puzzled the lady below. It arose&#xD;
from the reflection that she would leave Carl&#xD;
himself to announce the singular and (from&#xD;
a Middleton point of view) unpalatable fact&#xD;
of his acquaintance with the Desmond fam-&#xD;
ily, and his incomprehensible concealment&#xD;
thereof.&#xD;
ChAPTER VI.&#xD;
"Go, lovely rose I&#xD;
Tell her that wastes her time and me,&#xD;
That now she knows,&#xD;
When I resemble her to thee&#xD;
How sweet and fair she seems to be."&#xD;
Ax hour later, it was a very pleasant and&#xD;
sociable party that gathered around the Ros-&#xD;
land dinner-table. There were no guests in&#xD;
the h~use-for Mrs. Middleton had been care-&#xD;
ful that none should be invited at the time&#xD;
when Miss Desmond was expected-but there&#xD;
was nothing of the heavy atmosphere which&#xD;
usually pervades a strictly family gathering.&#xD;
Both host and hostess were too well-bred to&#xD;
suffer any of the annoyance which they felt&#xD;
to betray itself in their manner, and Leslie&#xD;
brought all her reserve of graceful tact and&#xD;
social knowledge into action. She had felt&#xD;
a little uneasiness as she dressed for dinner;&#xD;
but a sense of pleasant reassurance came to&#xD;
&#xD;
her as she entered the drawing - room just&#xD;
after the bell rang, and found her aunt and&#xD;
uncle laughing over one of Carl's anecdotes.&#xD;
The frank atmosphere of unclouded good-&#xD;
humor showed her at once how foolish she&#xD;
had been to fear any uncomfortable con-&#xD;
straint in people who held the slightest de-&#xD;
viation from the strict rule of courtesy equal&#xD;
to a breach of the Decalogue. "Under-bred&#xD;
people always show at once whatever they&#xD;
are thinking and feeling," Mrs. Middleton&#xD;
often said. ". Really well-bred people never~&#xD;
do, unless for some good reason. Believe&#xD;
me, my dear, that is, after all, the great dis-&#xD;
tinction between the two classes."&#xD;
"Well, Leslie, h~w did you get on with&#xD;
your new sister?" asked Mr. Middleton, turn-&#xD;
ing round as she entered. "I thought as I&#xD;
saw you driving off that the first advances&#xD;
toward acquaintanceship might be a little&#xD;
awkward-eh?"&#xD;
"I did not find them so," replied Leslie.&#xD;
"I think we got on very well indeed--better&#xD;
than you would fancy, perhaps. But, what&#xD;
did you think of her, uncle?"&#xD;
"I think she is one of the handsomest&#xD;
women I have ever ~ answered he, frank-&#xD;
ly. "Beyond this fact I can scarcely say that&#xD;
I have formed an opinion, except that her&#xD;
manner is decidedly cold, and rather calcu-&#xD;
lated to repulse one."&#xD;
"I am inclined to think that is a form&#xD;
of the antagonism which people who arc not&#xD;
quite sure of their social position often dis-&#xD;
play," remarked Carl. "You' must blame&#xD;
the circumstances of her life for it. Her&#xD;
manner loses all that haufeur, and is exqui-&#xD;
sitely charming when she is once thoroughly&#xD;
at ease."&#xD;
"You seem to know a great deal about&#xD;
her," said Mrs. Middleton, with a slight accent&#xD;
of suspicion in her tone.&#xD;
"I have seen a good deal of her," said&#xD;
the young man, quietly; "and I have noticed&#xD;
the peculiarity to which I allude. She is too&#xD;
refined to be defiant or se~1i'-asserting, so she&#xD;
meets patronage and slights with this proud&#xD;
coldness."&#xD;
"But we have no intention of either pa-&#xD;
tronizing or slighting her," said Mr. Middleton.&#xD;
"Granted, my dear sir; but remember,&#xD;
in the first place, that she had no assurance&#xD;
of that fact; and, in the second, that the&#xD;
habit of years cannot be laid aside in a mo-&#xD;
ment. I will wager any thing you please,&#xD;
&#xD;

however, that her manner will be changed&#xD;
entirely whcn she comes down to dinner.&#xD;
There never was a woman quicker to take a&#xD;
tone from others."&#xD;
"But is she coming down to dinner?"&#xD;
said Mrs. Middleton, who just then felt more&#xD;
interest in the soup than in Miss Desmond's&#xD;
manner. "Perhaps she may be too much fa-&#xD;
tigued to appear this evening.-Leslie, do you&#xD;
not think it would be well to send and ask if&#xD;
she would not like to dine in her own room?"&#xD;
"I scarcely think-" Leslie began, but&#xD;
before she could finish her sentence the door&#xD;
opened, and Miss Desmond entered.&#xD;
Entered and walked dpwn the long room&#xD;
toward the waiting group with an case and&#xD;
grace that would not have misbecome a prin-&#xD;
cess-if princesses were always as princess-&#xD;
like as they are generally supposed to be.&#xD;
The repose of her manner was so perfect, and&#xD;
her beauty was so brilliant, that she absolutely&#xD;
dazzled them as she advanced. Even Mr. Mid-&#xD;
dleton put up his eye -glass in amazement.&#xD;
If he had thought her "the handsomest wom-&#xD;
an he had ever seen," in a dusty traveling-&#xD;
dress, he could almost (save that his age for&#xD;
hyperbole was past) have likened her to a&#xD;
goddess in the filmy draperies and becom-&#xD;
ing adornment which she wore now. Tired,&#xD;
as she mightnaturally have bpen supposed to&#xD;
be, Miss Desmond had evidently been mindful&#xD;
of the fact that first impressions last long,&#xD;
and are very important; hence she had ex-&#xD;
erted herself to make a toilet in which con-&#xD;
summate knowledge of effect was veiled to all,&#xD;
save the most critical eye, by a simplicity that&#xD;
was in itself full of distinction.&#xD;
"Am I late?" she asked, as she reached&#xD;
the group. "I am really very sorry. I hope&#xD;
I have not kept you waiting long."&#xD;
"You have not kept us waiting at all,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Middleton, courteously. "I am&#xD;
only afraid that we have been selfish in ex-&#xD;
pecting you to appear this evening. You&#xD;
must feel exceedingly fatigued."&#xD;
"On the contrary, I am not conscious of&#xD;
any weariness at all," answered she simply.&#xD;
"Fatigue-absolute and real fatigue-is some-&#xD;
thing which I have never felt half a 'dozen&#xD;
times in my life. I hope I do not look broken&#xD;
down?" she added, with a smile.&#xD;
"Don't ask us to tell you how you look,"&#xD;
said Leslie. "We might fall into extrava-&#xD;
gance, and say that you look like Juno dressed&#xD;
by Worth."&#xD;
&#xD;
OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
"In a manner you would he near the&#xD;
truth, then," said Norah, with her rare laugh.&#xD;
"I cannot flatter myself that I look at all like&#xD;
Juno, but my dress is modeled on one of&#xD;
Worth's designs, though I have been dar-&#xD;
ing enough to make several alterations. Do&#xD;
you know I have an idea of setting up as his&#xD;
rival? They tell me-everybody who knows&#xD;
-flint in audacity and fertility of conception&#xD;
I almost equal him.-One should not praise&#xD;
one's self, should one, Mrs. Middleton? But&#xD;
then, you know, such assurances as those&#xD;
might intoxicate the soberest brain."&#xD;
"Who is Worth-a painter?" asked Mr.&#xD;
Middleton, regarding the young lady through&#xD;
his glass as if she had been a lay-figure or a&#xD;
picture.&#xD;
There was a general laugh at this, which&#xD;
the appearance of Robert and the announce-&#xD;
ment of dinner somewhat shortened.&#xD;
"Take Norah in at ~nce, uncle, before you&#xD;
disgrace yourself by any further display of ig-&#xD;
norance," said Leslie.-" No, thanks, Carl-I&#xD;
dislike to sandwich a man, even from the&#xD;
drawing-room to the dining-room. Aunt Mil-&#xD;
dred is enough of a charge for you."&#xD;
"Yourftanc~ ought to be on duty," said&#xD;
Carl. "Where is he? I give you warning&#xD;
that, if he is not a wonderfully good fellow, I&#xD;
mean to refuse my consent to this little mat-&#xD;
rimonial arrangement which you have all got&#xD;
up without consulting me."&#xD;
"Arthur said he would not come over&#xD;
this evening, since it is Norah's first among&#xD;
us," Leslie answered, when they were seated&#xD;
at table. "I thought it very, considerate of&#xD;
him; but if I had known how well she could&#xD;
look even after such an exhausting journey,&#xD;
I think I should have told him that his con-&#xD;
sideration was unnecessary."&#xD;
Norab, who was seated in tIme full light&#xD;
of the dying summer day, looked up at this,&#xD;
her already brilliant color deepening, perhaps,&#xD;
by a shade.&#xD;
"I wonder if I have not met Mr. Tyn.&#xD;
dale," she said, quietly. "has he ever been&#xD;
abroad?"&#xD;
"lie was abroad two or three years ago,"&#xD;
Leslie answered. "But, although it is likely&#xD;
enough that you may have seen, it is not like-&#xD;
ly that you knew him, for he told me some&#xD;
time ago that, although he had seen you once&#xD;
or twice, ha had never had the pleasure of&#xD;
knowing you."&#xD;
"Indeed!" Something like a glow came&#xD;
&#xD;
NORAH'S FORME&#xD;
&#xD;
into the eyes, and the scarlet lips curved as&#xD;
if in faint scorn. "Did he chance to men-&#xD;
tion where he had seen me?" she asked&#xD;
after a moment.&#xD;
"I think he said it was at Baden or Hom-&#xD;
burg," Leslie answered, vexed with herself&#xD;
that she could not avoid coloring, as she re-&#xD;
membered in what manner Arthur had spoken&#xD;
of the regal-looking creature before her.&#xD;
"Strangely enough, my idea was that I&#xD;
had met him at one of those places," Norah&#xD;
said, coolly, noting with keen eyes the flush&#xD;
that dyed the face of the other. "Or per-&#xD;
haps it is not strange, after all. Perhaps my&#xD;
memory is better than his want of memory,&#xD;
and I am right in thinking that I knew him,&#xD;
or some other Mr. Tyndale, at one of those&#xD;
spas.&#xD;
"It could not have been Arthur!" said&#xD;
Leslie, with a positive air. "He certainly&#xD;
could not have known you and forgotten it-&#xD;
especially since he remembered your appear-&#xD;
ance perfectly, and recognized your likeness&#xD;
at a glance.~~&#xD;
"Mr. Tyndale has a cousin~" said Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton. "Perhaps it is Ac whom Miss&#xD;
Desmond knew."&#xD;
"I am not absolutely positive that I knew&#xD;
any one of the name," said Miss Desmond,&#xD;
abruptly. "One meets so many people-at&#xD;
least, I do-that I often confound names, and&#xD;
sometimes mistake identities. Perhaps the&#xD;
Tyndale whom I remember was an English-&#xD;
man, or perhaps "-she lifted her glass of&#xD;
wine to her lips just here-" he may be dead&#xD;
long ago."&#xD;
"I am inclined to think that it was Cap-&#xD;
tain Tyndale," said Leslie, meditatively. "He&#xD;
is Arthur's cousin, but he is half a French-&#xD;
man, and has lived in France almost all his&#xD;
life. Nothing is more likely than that you&#xD;
should have known him."&#xD;
"He is well worth knowing," said Mr.&#xD;
Middleton, chiming in just here. "I like&#xD;
that young fellow-he is sensible, straight-&#xD;
forward, and a thorough gentleman, without&#xD;
a particle of nonsense about him."&#xD;
"He is an officer of the French army,"&#xD;
added Mrs. Middlet~n, "and is said to have&#xD;
acted very gallantly at-what was the name&#xD;
of the battle, Leslie? Of course, that is a&#xD;
thing which we must take on trust; but he is&#xD;
certainly very pleasant."&#xD;
"Wbat is that?" said Carl, who had&#xD;
ricked up his ears at the last announcement.&#xD;
&#xD;
R ACQUAINTANCE.                       33&#xD;
"Have you a fragment of the great wreck&#xD;
over here? I hope you have not been lion-&#xD;
izing him, Leslie? I'll send for a Uhlan or&#xD;
two, if you want subjects for that kind of&#xD;
amusement."&#xD;
"You are very kind," said Leslie, "but&#xD;
we generally md them to suit ourselves.&#xD;
Following the example of the people who, in&#xD;
advertising for servants, add, 'No Irish need&#xD;
apply!' we generally make it understood that,&#xD;
in securing subjects for lionizing, no Germans&#xD;
need apply - nor German sympathizers, ei-&#xD;
ther!"&#xD;
"I see that I shall find very little appre-&#xD;
ciation for my devotion to the Fatherland,"&#xD;
mid he, shrugging ihis shoulders; "that is,&#xD;
unless I can persuade Miss Desmond to sing&#xD;
'Die Wavht am Rhein' with me."&#xD;
"I have not learned any thing since the&#xD;
'Marseillaise,"' said Norah, dryly.&#xD;
"That is better than 'Partant pour in&#xD;
Sync,' at all events," muttered he. "Ii has&#xD;
a history."&#xD;
"Of the sans-culottes and the Place do Ia&#xD;
Grave," said Leslie.&#xD;
'lAdd Belleville, Montmartre, and La Ho-&#xD;
quette. We must not be personal, however.&#xD;
Miss Desmond was in Paris during the reign&#xD;
of the Commune, and she may have been a&#xD;
p~troleuse."&#xD;
"0 Norah, were you, indeed? Tell us&#xD;
about it!" cried Leslie, eagerly.&#xD;
"About being a pilroleuse? "asked Norah,&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
"How absurd! About being in Paris, of&#xD;
course, I mean."&#xD;
"There is not much to tell. Since we&#xD;
were unfortunate enough to be women, papa&#xD;
thought that the best place for Kate and my.&#xD;
self was in a convent-your chivalrous Pins-&#xD;
sians had battered down one of the walls, Mr.&#xD;
Mid4leton-and I shall never forget the days&#xD;
I we spent there. Wa thought them horrible&#xD;
-especially as we lived in hourly expectation&#xD;
of being driven out-but, after all, many peo-&#xD;
pie fared much worse."&#xD;
"But yonmust see that it was not reason-&#xD;
able to blame the Prussians about the wall&#xD;
of your convent "-Middleton was beginning,&#xD;
* when his uncle interposed.&#xD;
"We won't discuss the question, Carl. I&#xD;
fancy most of us have made up our minds in&#xD;
a general way, on one side or the other, and&#xD;
unprofitable excitement is bad for digestion.&#xD;
-..My sympathies are all with the walls of your&#xD;

&#xD;
convent, Miss Desmond, and, if Carl becomes&#xD;
unpleasantly Teutonic, I'll shut him up with&#xD;
a cask of lager in a Dutch summer-house we&#xD;
have, to evolve any thing he pleases from&#xD;
his inner consciousness, so that be keeps&#xD;
quiet."&#xD;
"Oh, I have really no great objection to&#xD;
the Germans," said Miss Desxnond, in a tone&#xD;
of magnanimity. "They do very 'Well for&#xD;
some things. I have lived among them so&#xD;
mlcb. that; of course, I know them very&#xD;
welL"&#xD;
"She told me that she liked Vienna bet-&#xD;
ter than any capital itt Thirope," said Carl,&#xD;
addressii~g the Company&#xD;
"And do you call Vienna Ucrmaz?" she&#xD;
asked, indignantly. "Where do you find&#xD;
any leaven of Teutonic heaviness in that brill-&#xD;
iant capital? Is there any suggestion 9f Un-&#xD;
ter den Linden on the Prater? I do not call&#xD;
any thing German which is enriched by the&#xD;
warm blood of the Slavic races."&#xD;
"There is no telling what she will say&#xD;
next," said Carl, with an air of resignation.&#xD;
"But, for all that, she sings German ballads&#xD;
like a thrush."&#xD;
"We will hear her after dinner," said&#xD;
Mrs Middleton; smiling. Before very long,&#xD;
however, that lady's eyes began to open to&#xD;
the alarming degree of interest which Carl&#xD;
manifested in the young stranger. The. femi-&#xD;
nine mind is proverbially quick in perceiving&#xD;
or foreseeing the faintest suspicion of a love-&#xD;
affair, and, although Mrs. Middleton had not&#xD;
yet heard of that previous acquaintance which&#xD;
had so astonished Leslie, she saw many sig-&#xD;
nificant signs that disturbed the serene at-&#xD;
mosphere of comfort in which ~hc usually&#xD;
existed. A new vista of possible annoyance,&#xD;
of horribly possible misfortune, appeared to&#xD;
open before her. Carl! In summing up all&#xD;
that might occur from the visit of this Bo-&#xD;
hemian girl, ahe' had not. once thought of&#xD;
CarL Yet, what if he should marry her!&#xD;
It seemed a wide~ leap to take even in im-&#xD;
agination, but Mrs. Middleton had lived too&#xD;
long in the world uiot~ to be thoroughly aware&#xD;
how often suck leap~ ave taken in reality, and&#xD;
a bitter sense nf auger rose up in her heart&#xD;
as she thought that~ this mi~lit be the end of&#xD;
all her hopes. Leslie's engagement to ~Ar-&#xD;
thur Tyndale had been unpalatable enough&#xD;
but ('or Carl to fall in love with Norah Des-&#xD;
mond would fill the cup of disappointment to&#xD;
its brim. "Good Heavens, how things turn&#xD;
&#xD;
out in this world!" she thought, with a terri-&#xD;
ble sense of her own inability to stem their cur-&#xD;
rent, "and who can tell what dreadful results&#xD;
may follow from one false step! If Leslie&#xD;
had only listened to me-" But then it was&#xD;
an unalterable fact that Leslie had not lis-&#xD;
tened, as 'unalterable asMiss Desmond's pres-&#xD;
ence at Roslanci, concerning which Mrs. Mid-&#xD;
dieton called her own weakness sternly to&#xD;
account, and wasted much time in vain regret&#xD;
that she had not opposed such a step more&#xD;
strenuously and with greater authority.&#xD;
It was after dinner when she made these&#xD;
cheerful reflections. Mr. Middleton was smok-&#xD;
ing a cigar and reading a newspaper in the&#xD;
the dining - room, the decanters still on the&#xD;
table, and a glass of wine near his hand.&#xD;
Carl, having smoked out two or three cigar-&#xD;
ettes, at last sauuitered into the drawing-&#xD;
room, where he found his aunt alone. She&#xD;
was in her favorite nook - a recess large&#xD;
enough to contain her writing-table, her couch,&#xD;
her easy-chair, and all her luxurious parapher-&#xD;
nalia of special comforts-and he saw at once&#xD;
that he had no alternative but to join her.&#xD;
At another time, this necessity would not&#xD;
have presented itself in an unpleasant light;&#xD;
but just now he was particularly anxious to&#xD;
see Norah Desmnond, and he could not re-&#xD;
press a slight feeling of impatience at the&#xD;
prospect of one of those unlimited gossips&#xD;
which women love. He faced it, however,&#xD;
with a sufficiently good grace, though his pre-&#xD;
occupation of manner was so great that Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton soon detected the utter want of&#xD;
interest with which he received the various&#xD;
items of social and domestic news that she&#xD;
exerted herself to bestow upon him. She&#xD;
saw his eyes wander across the room, in&#xD;
which shaded lamp-light and summer twilight&#xD;
were mingled, to the veranda and lawn be-&#xD;
yond. Watching him closely, she caught a&#xD;
sudden quickening expressionn which flashed&#xD;
across his face, atid was very significant, as a&#xD;
pair' of white - clad figures caine slowly into&#xD;
sight, visible through the lace-draped window&#xD;
and green arch beyond.&#xD;
"Leslie took Miss Desmond out to enjoy&#xD;
the twilight," said she, changing her topic of&#xD;
'conversation quite abruptly-a fact which it&#xD;
is probable Carl did not discover. "By-the-&#xD;
by, you have not told me yet what you think&#xD;
of her. Is she not lovely?"&#xD;
"Lovely!" repeated he, starting~ suddenly&#xD;
out of abstraction. "Yes, of course-only&#xD;

CARL MIDDLETON.                  3&#xD;
&#xD;
that is too weak a word! She is the most&#xD;
beautiful creature I ever saw!"&#xD;
Then-brought up short, as it were, by&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton's look of surprise-he blushed&#xD;
and laughed.&#xD;
"By Jove!" he said, "I thought you were&#xD;
talking of Miss Desmond. Is it Leslie you&#xD;
mean? Certainly she is very lovely - so&#xD;
graceful and refined-but she does not show&#xD;
to the best advantage by such a woman as&#xD;
her sister."&#xD;
"There is no comparison between them!"&#xD;
said Mrs. Middletori, sharply-for the cool-&#xD;
ness of this depreciation was more than even&#xD;
her patience could endure-" they belong to&#xD;
entirely different social types. Leslie bears&#xD;
every mark of exquisite refinement and high-&#xD;
breeding, while Miss esmond is a mere man's&#xD;
~ieaut~~ / ~'&#xD;
"Is she?" said Carl, good . humoredly.&#xD;
"Then it is no wonder men rave over her as&#xD;
they do. You should have heard them on board&#xD;
the Russia ! Why, there were one or two&#xD;
fellows who were absolutely crazy about her!&#xD;
Now, y~u know, a woman must be remark.&#xD;
able to make a sensation like that on ship-&#xD;
board, for men are thinking of other things&#xD;
just then-their stomachs principally."&#xD;
"It is never in good taste to make a sensa-&#xD;
tion anywhere!" said Mrs. Middleton, in an&#xD;
ex-catkedi-a tone, which, to do her justice, she&#xD;
did not often employ. "No thorough-bred&#xD;
lady ever desires to do so!"&#xD;
" But a woman can't help being beautiful,&#xD;
you know," said Carl. "Of course it has its&#xD;
drawbacks sometimes; I have heard Miss&#xD;
iPesmond talk about them quite feelimgly.&#xD;
But I can assure you she did nothing to draw&#xD;
attention on herself. She is enough of a thor-&#xD;
ough-bred woman to avoid that, at any rate."&#xD;
"Is, she?" said Mrs. Middleton. With.&#xD;
out being a philosopher, she knew human&#xD;
nature well enough to avoid any argument&#xD;
on the score of Miss Desmond's breeding, or&#xD;
Miss Desmond's charms; she was perfectly&#xD;
aware that depreciation would only fan Carl's&#xD;
admiration to fever-heat; so, with a wisdom&#xD;
that many women lack, she allowed the sub-&#xD;
ject to drop, and soon after this sent him&#xD;
away. "Go and make your bird-of-paradise&#xD;
sing," slme~ said.&#xD;
"But ~he is not my bird-of- paradise,"&#xD;
answered he. "And she sings only when&#xD;
she has a mind to--I give you warning of&#xD;
that!"&#xD;
&#xD;
He went willingly enough, however, and&#xD;
found the bird-of-paradise still on the lawn&#xD;
with Leslie.&#xD;
"Do you think this is quite prudent?"&#xD;
asked he, coming up to them as they sat&#xD;
under a large catalpa-tree, making a pretty&#xD;
picture in the soft twilight. "There is a very&#xD;
heavy dew on the grass. Look !" - and he&#xD;
pointed to his evening boots, all covered with&#xD;
clinging moisture.&#xD;
"It msy not be prudent, but it is very&#xD;
pleasant," said Leslie. "Every thing is so&#xD;
fragrant and exquisite! I have been making&#xD;
Norah listezi to the mocking-birds. She nev-&#xD;
er heard them before, you know."&#xD;
"And what a delicious note they have!"&#xD;
said Norah. "I cannot imagine any thing&#xD;
more sweet. Listen! is not that one, now?"&#xD;
"They sing in this grove all night tong,"&#xD;
said Carl, "or at least they used to do so. I&#xD;
have often lain awake for hours listening to&#xD;
them. That fellow who is singing now is a&#xD;
perfect Mario!"&#xD;
"He is in the rose-hedge yonder," said&#xD;
Miss Desmond. "I think 1 shall go nearer,&#xD;
for the sake of listening to him."&#xD;
"Take cara, Norah, the grass is very wet,"&#xD;
said Leslie. "I was just about to propose a&#xD;
return to the house, where we can hear yo~e&#xD;
sing, instead of the mocking-bird."&#xD;
"What an exchange!" said Norab; and~&#xD;
as she spoke, she walked toward the hedge.&#xD;
"Go with her, Carl," said Miss Grahame,&#xD;
appealingly. "My shoes are too thin for me&#xD;
to venture into that high grass; and pray&#xD;
bring her back as soon as possible!"&#xD;
"All right," said Carl, hastening away.&#xD;
His heart gave a triumphant throb. Here&#xD;
was his opportunity sooner than he could&#xD;
have dared to hope. It is to be feared that&#xD;
he did not think much just then of the dew.&#xD;
laden grass clinging round Norah's delicate&#xD;
ankles The power of speaking to her alone&#xD;
was a boon worth purchasing at any cost.&#xD;
"Why did you come?" asked she, turn-&#xD;
ing round abruptly as he gained her side.&#xD;
"You should have stayed with Leslie. I am&#xD;
very well able to take care of myself, and I&#xD;
do not want to talk to you, but to listen to&#xD;
the mocking-bird."&#xD;
"I never doubted that," said he; "but it&#xD;
was Leslie who sent me. Not that I needed&#xD;
to be sent-you know that; but it was she&#xD;
who bade sac come. Pray excuse me if I&#xD;
ought to have stayed."&#xD;

MISS DESMOND'S MUSICAL TALENT.              37&#xD;
&#xD;
86                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
"It is not a matter of the least impor-&#xD;
tance," answered she; "but of course Leslie&#xD;
will think that I came away to flirt."&#xD;
"I think you anticipate many harsh judg-&#xD;
ments which are never passed," said he, col-&#xD;
oring. "I will answer for Leslie that such a&#xD;
thought has not entered her mind. When&#xD;
you know her better, you will find that she is&#xD;
one of the most amiable and most unsuspect-&#xD;
ing people in the world."&#xD;
"I think I perceive that already," said&#xD;
Miss Desmond, thoughtfully. "And, in con-&#xD;
sequence, I feel like one who is at sea with-&#xD;
out a compass. I have been so much sur-&#xD;
prised to find Leslie what she is, that I scarce-&#xD;
ly realize my position, or-or what I am to&#xD;
do. I fsncied -1 confidently expected-&#xD;
something so different."&#xD;
"~ And so much more disagreeable, I am&#xD;
sure."&#xD;
"Yes, I confess that."&#xD;
"And why is it that you persist in always&#xD;
expecting the worst and thinking the worst&#xD;
of people?"&#xD;
"Because, in the course of my nineteen&#xD;
years, I have found that people always think&#xD;
the worst and expect the worst of me."&#xD;
"Stop a minute," said he, smiling. "I&#xD;
bind you on your honor to answer if you have&#xD;
found that eve~-~ibod~q, even in the course of&#xD;
your mature nineteen years, has thought or&#xD;
expected the worst of you?"&#xD;
"Men in lc~ve don't count," answered she.&#xD;
"A few of them have thought much better of&#xD;
me than 1 deserved."&#xD;
"I should count them worth all the rest,"&#xD;
said he, coloring again.&#xD;
"Should you?" asked she, a little mock-&#xD;
ingly. "I cannot agree with you. If a man&#xD;
tells me that I am a goddess, for instance, I&#xD;
can only laugh at him, you know. Certainly,&#xD;
I could not be expected to respect an opinion&#xD;
so palpably absurd. But, when a woman says&#xD;
that I am a fast flirt, the words sting a little,&#xD;
because they have a modicum of truth in&#xD;
them. I have not been reared to regard con-&#xD;
ventionality overmuch, and I generally ac-&#xD;
Lept admiration when it is offered me."&#xD;
"I have never yet seen a woman who did&#xD;
not," said he. "But, without any high-flown&#xD;
folly, a man might hold you far above all oth-&#xD;
er women, and be worthy of credit if he told&#xD;
you so."&#xD;
"That is a kind of homage which has&#xD;
never been offered to me," said she, with a&#xD;
&#xD;
look of quick pain-which the twilight hid-'&#xD;
crossing her face. "Men, as a general rule,&#xD;
have fallen in love and made fools of them.&#xD;
selves about me, against their better judg-&#xD;
ment. I am afraid I should not believe in&#xD;
any thing else if it were given to me now.&#xD;
But this is a tiresome subject, ond we came&#xD;
-at least Icame-to listen to the mocking-&#xD;
bird. I think our voices must have startled&#xD;
him, for he has ceased to sing."&#xD;
"Ceased, in a paroxysm of envy, to listen&#xD;
to you, I am sure."&#xD;
"Don't credit him with the meanest of&#xD;
our poor passions," said she. "That was a&#xD;
very neat compliment, however. Such things&#xD;
are like an inspiration, are they not? Now,&#xD;
I am sure you could not do as well again."&#xD;
"Do you mean that as a challenge for me&#xD;
to try?"&#xD;
"Not by any means, since a prepared&#xD;
compliment is about as excellent as twice-&#xD;
cooked meat. In fact, I do not like compli-&#xD;
ments, under any circumstances," added she,&#xD;
frankly.&#xD;
"Then I shall employ more fragrant lips&#xD;
to utter mine for me," said he, pausing to&#xD;
break a rose-for they were now among the&#xD;
shrubbery-which even in the gloaming he&#xD;
could perceive to be one of the most royal&#xD;
and beautiful of its kind. Having done this,&#xD;
he turned to his companion. "I know noth-&#xD;
ing about the language of flowers," he said;&#xD;
"but this rose seems to me ~o typify you bet-&#xD;
ter than any other flower possibly could, and&#xD;
-it raiJcs far above aU others, yo~e know I"&#xD;
Then, after a pause, in a lower tone: "Will&#xD;
you take it?"&#xD;
She hesitated a moment-during which&#xD;
Middleton would have given any thing he&#xD;
possessed for a light in which to see her face&#xD;
-but, as he began to gather courage from&#xD;
her hesitation, she extended her hand with a&#xD;
laugh that made his courage sink to zero&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"Thanks; you are very kind," she said.&#xD;
"I think my challenge must have put you on&#xD;
your mettle, for your second effort is better&#xD;
than your first. What a lovely rose! Ilow&#xD;
good of you to say that it typifies me! I&#xD;
only wish I were half so glowing and per-&#xD;
fect!"&#xD;
"If you were any other woman, I should&#xD;
~ay that wish was an egregious affectation,~~&#xD;
said Carl, provoked by her nonchalance.&#xD;
"But, as it is, you are kind enough to&#xD;
&#xD;
give me credit for sincerity," she said-and&#xD;
he heard her laugh again. "How very com-&#xD;
plimentary you are to-night! Is it your un-&#xD;
cle's excellent champagne which has inspired&#xD;
you? It would be pleasant to remain and&#xD;
hear you go from better to best; but I am&#xD;
becoming aware that the grass is damp, and,&#xD;
since Mario will not give us another rouade,&#xD;
it might be as well to return to the house.&#xD;
A piOJJQS of your pretty speeches, I have a&#xD;
shrewd suspicion that, if Leslie does not&#xD;
think that I am flirting, your aunt will not&#xD;
be so charitable!"&#xD;
"We don't think quite so much of leather&#xD;
and prunella here as in the countries to which&#xD;
you arc accustomed," said he, as he tui~ne'1&#xD;
and walked by her side.&#xD;
"Where do you draw the line between&#xD;
what is de riqucur, and what is not?" she&#xD;
asked. "I should really like to know. Per-&#xD;
haps on this side of the water I may find my-&#xD;
self a very conventional and respectable per.&#xD;
~son, indeed."&#xD;
"You must ask some one better up in&#xD;
the proprieties than I am," he answered.&#xD;
"When they present themselves to mc, it is&#xD;
generally in the light of such particularly un-.&#xD;
pleasant bores that I have never given them&#xD;
the attention which they doubtless deserve."&#xD;
To cross a lawn cannot possibly take a&#xD;
very long time under any circumstances, so&#xD;
they soon found themselves in the drawing.&#xD;
room, where Miss Desmond went at once to&#xD;
the piano, without any troublesome solicita-&#xD;
tion. Notes she had none, but her command&#xD;
of the instrument was perfect, and her knowl-&#xD;
edge of harmony very good. After a well-&#xD;
modulated prelude, she began to sing. De-&#xD;
scriptions of singing are mostly unsatisfac-&#xD;
tory, and very unmeaning to all save the&#xD;
technical, musical mind; so it is sufficient to&#xD;
say that a voice like this, which rose now and&#xD;
floated out on the midsummer night, had nev-&#xD;
er sounded before within the walls of lbs.&#xD;
land. A contralto so rich, so sweet, so pow-&#xD;
erful, would have been likely to command&#xD;
attention and admiration anywhere; hut here&#xD;
it was greeted with an enthusiasm that might&#xD;
have gratified the most exacting prima-donna&#xD;
on the lyric stage.&#xD;
It was a voice strangely familiar, and&#xD;
strangely fraught with association to one who&#xD;
did not form part of the group in the draw-&#xD;
ing-room. A solitary man, standing on a&#xD;
bridge that crossed a small stream not far&#xD;
&#xD;
from the house, heard the clear, full notes&#xD;
rising as he moodily smoked his cigar, and&#xD;
their cadence seemed suddenly to stir into&#xD;
life the wild thrill of an old passion which be&#xD;
had thought dead forever.&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
'~The branches cross above our eyes,&#xD;
The skies are in a net;&#xD;
And what's the thing beneath the skies&#xD;
We two would most forget?&#xD;
Not birth, my love, no, no-&#xD;
Not death, my love, no, no-&#xD;
The love once ours, but ours long hours ago."&#xD;
"I SUPPOSE there is nothing for it but to&#xD;
face the music, Max!"&#xD;
It was Arthur Tyndale who spoke thus,&#xD;
not interrogatively, but with a sort of gloomy&#xD;
decision, as he leaned back in his chair,&#xD;
stroked the silken ears of his favorite setter,&#xD;
and regarded his cousin, who, having come&#xD;
down late, was eating his breakfast with the&#xD;
appetite of a man who is neither dyspeptic,&#xD;
bankrupt, nor yet in love.&#xD;
"I confess I am not able to perceive any&#xD;
very clear alternative," Captain Tyndale an-&#xD;
swered, frankly. "It is an awkward position;&#xD;
but you have had a month or two in which to&#xD;
prepare yourself for it, so I really don't see&#xD;
why you should take it an tragique at the Inst&#xD;
minute."&#xD;
"Oh, you don't!" said Arthur, sardon-&#xD;
ically. "No-I suppose riot, I believe we&#xD;
rarely ever do see any reason for the troubles&#xD;
and annoyances of other people! All the&#xD;
same-if you were in my place-"&#xD;
"Which I am not, thank Heaven!"&#xD;
"-You might be conscious of a strong&#xD;
temptation to order your horse and take the&#xD;
earliest train from Wexford in any direction,&#xD;
sooner than walk over to Rosland and face&#xD;
Norah Desmond."&#xD;
"Face her! '~ repeated the other, impatient-&#xD;
ly. "But what do you think she will do?&#xD;
If she is half the woman you have described&#xD;
her to be, she is not likely to assert her claim&#xD;
to you in the face of the assembled family."&#xD;
"The assembled family would be matter&#xD;
of the least possible importance compared to&#xD;
leer 1',&#xD;
"Or to upbraid you with your desertion,&#xD;
after the fashion of a melodramatic heroine?"&#xD;
"Don't be a fool, Max!"&#xD;
&#xD;

38                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.                                                AN AWKWA&#xD;
&#xD;
"Then, in the name of common-sense,&#xD;
what are you afraid of?"&#xD;
"I am afraid of nothing," said Tyndale,&#xD;
coloring. "But you might understand that&#xD;
it is confoundedly awkward-to use the mild-&#xD;
est possible phrase-to meet a woman who&#xD;
has good reason for thinking you are engaged&#xD;
to her, in the presence of another woman to&#xD;
whom you are engaged."&#xD;
"fim!" said Max, carving a chicken. "I&#xD;
can imagine that it might be slightly un-&#xD;
pleasant. But you should have thought of&#xD;
that in time."&#xD;
"Thought of it! But how the deuce&#xD;
could I think of' it when, up to the first of&#xD;
May, I had no more reason for imagining that&#xD;
Norah Desmond was connected with Leslie&#xD;
Grahame, than I have for imagining that she&#xD;
is connected with you!"&#xD;
He spoke so much in the tone of one who&#xD;
has been aggrieved by some supreme injury&#xD;
of Fate, that Max Tyndale absolutely opened&#xD;
his dark eyes andstared at him. "By Jove!"&#xD;
he said, half' aloud. Then he stroked his&#xD;
mustache and went on, devoting his attention&#xD;
to the chicken. Arthur had been something&#xD;
of a study to him during the last two months,&#xD;
and this phase of his character was no new&#xD;
revelation.&#xD;
"Are you going to walk over to Rosland&#xD;
this morning?" lie asked, after a while.&#xD;
"I suppose I ought to do so," Arthur an-&#xD;
swer~d, hesitatingly. "You'll come too,&#xD;
woii' iou?"&#xD;
"I think not. Most likely I'll spend the&#xD;
day lo~.inging in the ~housc. It is too hot for&#xD;
any thing else."&#xD;
"They are always glad to see you at los-&#xD;
land,"&#xD;
"II know that; but, all the same, I won't&#xD;
trouble them this snorning2'&#xD;
Tyndale made a slightly-impatient move-&#xD;
ment and turned away. It would have been&#xD;
a satisfaction to him to have had Max at his&#xD;
o as a sort of moral support, and lie felt&#xD;
vexed that his cousin should not have been&#xD;
aware of this fact. He was ashamed to make&#xD;
his request more particular or pressing, how-&#xD;
ever, and so it came to pass that, in the&#xD;
course of the next hour, he set off alone-&#xD;
taking a footpath through the woods to Ros-&#xD;
land.&#xD;
The morning was indeed very warm, but&#xD;
he was scarcely conscious of' the heat. With&#xD;
every step his nervousunsa increased. Clearer&#xD;
&#xD;
and clearer came the remembrance of how he&#xD;
had parted with Norah Desmond last, and&#xD;
the realization of how he was about to meet&#xD;
her now! More and more perfectly lie ap.&#xD;
preciated how entirely he was in her power.&#xD;
He began to ask himself if he had been mad&#xD;
to let things go on thus far in the vague hope&#xD;
or chance of influencing her to silence. "Why&#xD;
did I not tell Leslie any thing?" he muttered,&#xD;
thinking of the day when she had asked him&#xD;
whether there was any reason why her sister&#xD;
should not be invited to her uncle's house,&#xD;
and he had felt constrained to answer that&#xD;
there was none. Now lie looked back upon&#xD;
this answer as a piece of pusillanimous folly,&#xD;
seeing clearly that he had "owed it to him-&#xD;
self" to put the girl's character in such a&#xD;
light that Leslie would never have been in-&#xD;
clined to take any step toward nearer ac-&#xD;
quaintanceship. It must not b~ supposed&#xD;
that this opinion was a reckless impulse born&#xD;
of an hour or a day; it was rather the slow&#xD;
result of two months spent in halting between&#xD;
honor and dishonor, in counting the chances&#xD;
for and against detection, in persuading him-&#xD;
self' that they were very strongly in his favor,&#xD;
and in cultivating an habitually injured frame&#xD;
of mind, which he found to he a very solid&#xD;
and permanent comfort.&#xD;
Just now it was less of a comfort thaii it&#xD;
had ever been before. Things which he had&#xD;
striven to ignore-memories from which he&#xD;
shrank-came back and stared him grimly in&#xD;
the face. He could not rid himself of the&#xD;
consciousness that already-if Miss Desmond&#xD;
had chosen to speak-he might find the doors&#xD;
of Rosland closed to him; already he might&#xD;
be east out indignantly from Leslie's heart.&#xD;
Standing on the bridge where Norali's voice&#xD;
had floated down to him the night before, he&#xD;
forgot himself far enough to curse her in his&#xD;
heart-her and "his luck." No man was&#xD;
ever in such a position before, he thought;&#xD;
and, so thinking, turned on his heel. Even&#xD;
liere-~--in sight of the very walls of' Roslaud-'&#xD;
he could not resolve to face her.&#xD;
But, as he turned - filled with the one&#xD;
vague idea of escaping from the embarrass-&#xD;
ment which awaited him --voices suddenly&#xD;
smote on his esr-gay tones and light laugh&#xD;
ter floated to him. The next moment, around&#xD;
a turn of the path, two ladies and a gentleman&#xD;
came slowly sauntering toivard the bridge.&#xD;
It was too late for retreat-even if lie had&#xD;
still desired to make it. Fate had come to*&#xD;
&#xD;
his assistance, and cut with sharp decision&#xD;
the Gordian knot of his vacillation. "There&#xD;
is Arthur!" he heard Leslie say; and after&#xD;
that he could only advance to meet them.&#xD;
The meeting was, of course, less terrible&#xD;
than he had pictured it. Conventionalities&#xD;
are good things to keep troublesome emotions&#xD;
in check~; and there are few of us who could&#xD;
dispense with the beneficent aid of common-&#xD;
places at those critical moments when the&#xD;
heart seems beating in the throat, and the&#xD;
lip quivers over every thing save the baldest&#xD;
platitudes. Afterward Tyndalo could recall&#xD;
little besides a sudden great wave of recollec-&#xD;
tion, which came over him with the force of&#xD;
an absolute shock, as Leslie said, "Norah,&#xD;
let me introduce Mr. Tyndale: this is my&#xD;
sister, Arthur;" and, looking up, he met No-&#xD;
rah's brilliant eyes fastened on him. It was&#xD;
almost unconsciously that he bowed and said&#xD;
something-he did not know what-about&#xD;
her journey. The past rushed hack upon&#xD;
him with a power which he could hardly&#xD;
ivithstand. Her face, her figure, the very or-&#xD;
naments she wore, the very fragrance that&#xD;
hung like a faint incense about her, seemed&#xD;
to conjure before him the green lindens of&#xD;
Baden-seemed to bring back, with a sense&#xD;
of overwhelming reality, scenes and words&#xD;
which-being more weak than willful in dis-&#xD;
honor-he would have given any thing to ef-&#xD;
face by some spell of oblivion. But such a&#xD;
spell was difficult to find with the "haunting&#xD;
fairness" of her face before him, and the&#xD;
splendor of her eyes thrilling his very soul.&#xD;
lIe was forced to give himself a sort of men-&#xD;
tal shake in order to remember where he&#xD;
really was when she spoke to him-spoke as&#xD;
she might have spoken to the most indiffer-&#xD;
ent stranger who crossed her path.&#xD;
"Thanks; yes-I had a very pleasant&#xD;
voyage," she said-but he seemed to catch&#xD;
the echo of other words in every tone; he&#xD;
seemed to hear again tfle sweet thrill of ten-&#xD;
derness which had filled that voice when they&#xD;
parted two 'years before!&#xD;
Leslie did not observe his agitation; but&#xD;
there was some one else who did. When he&#xD;
greeted Carl Middleton, the latter noticed&#xD;
that the hand offered him was cold, and shook&#xD;
nervously. Instinctively he glanced at Leslie,&#xD;
but her bright smile forbade the idea that she&#xD;
was, in any way, connected with such an agi-&#xD;
tation. Then he looked at Norah. She was&#xD;
holding her dress lightly aside from the grass&#xD;
&#xD;
AN AWKWA&#xD;
&#xD;
~RD POSITION.                         39&#xD;
-as supremely calm and coolly nonchalant&#xD;
as it was possible for a woman to appear.&#xD;
Carl felt a little puzzled, and glanced back at&#xD;
Tyndale. The latter had turned to speak to&#xD;
Miss Graharne, but the first tone of his voice&#xD;
betrayed to a finely-strung ear the nervous&#xD;
tension in which he was holding himself'.&#xD;
"I was on my way to the house," he said.&#xD;
"I had no idea of finding you out. Is it not&#xD;
rather warm to be walking ~ 9"&#xD;
a.&#xD;
"I brought Norah out to show her the&#xD;
grounds," Leslie answered, "but perhaps it&#xD;
is too warm for exercise.-If you think so"&#xD;
(turning to her sister), "we will go back,"&#xD;
"Not on my account," said Norab, quick.&#xD;
ly. "Our path ba~ been so shaded that the&#xD;
sun has not been able to do more than glance&#xD;
at us, and there is a breeze which we do not&#xD;
feel in the house. Besides, I like to be in the&#xD;
open air. I think it is where we should live&#xD;
in summer,,~&#xD;
"It is an ascertained fact that the people&#xD;
of America spend less time in the open air&#xD;
than any other people in the world," said&#xD;
Carl, meditatively.&#xD;
"Do you mean that as a thing to be ad-&#xD;
mired or decried?" asked Miss Desmond.&#xD;
"For my part, I think it very extraordinary.&#xD;
How can they resist the invitation which&#xD;
every gleam of sunshine seems to give ?-Now,&#xD;
what a charming place this is just before us!&#xD;
How clear the stream looks under the over-&#xD;
hanging shade! How prettily the shadows&#xD;
flicker-how softly the water murmurs I Such&#xD;
a scene is enough in itself to tempt one to&#xD;
idleness! - Have you ever outgrown your&#xD;
childish fancy for wading, Mr. Middleton? I&#xD;
confess that I never have."&#xD;
She moved forward-passing Tyndale so&#xD;
closely that her dress touched him-followed&#xD;
by Carl. On the bridge they paused.&#xD;
"Do you feel inclined to try a little wad-&#xD;
ing?" he asked, leaning over the railing, but&#xD;
looking up in her face. "You did not give&#xD;
me time to answer your question; but I never&#xD;
have outgrown my fa~icy for it."&#xD;
She laughed, and glanced down at her&#xD;
daintily-clad feet.&#xD;
"I am afraid the golden age for that pas-&#xD;
toral pleasure is over for me," she said.&#xD;
"My recollee~ion of it is somewhat like a&#xD;
mali's sentimental yearning over the memory&#xD;
of his first love. How much aghast he would&#xD;
be if sentenced to pass his lif'e with the wom-&#xD;
an lie loved at twenty I-and I am afraid I&#xD;

A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
FIRST IMPRESSIONS.&#xD;
&#xD;
could scarcely go back into Arcadia suffi-&#xD;
ciently to enjoy the ripple of even that cool,&#xD;
clear water around my feet. This is a de-&#xD;
lightful place, however, even to those who&#xD;
have left Arcadia behind. It would be pleas-&#xD;
ant, would it not, to come down here some&#xD;
day and fish?"&#xD;
"It would be pleasant to fish anywhere&#xD;
with you," her companion answered, quite&#xD;
truthfully. "But it would be foolish to cast&#xD;
our nets or our lines here, with the river near&#xD;
at hand full of capital fish."&#xD;
"Is the river near at hand? How near?"&#xD;
"Something like half a mile, I think.-I&#xD;
say, Leslie" - as Miss Grahame advanced&#xD;
toward them-" how far are we from the&#xD;
river?"&#xD;
"A quarter of a mile, perhaps," said Les-&#xD;
lie, "but why do you ask? It is too warm&#xD;
to go on the water at this time of day."&#xD;
"Do you go on the water?" asked Norah.&#xD;
"Have you a boat? We were talking of fish-&#xD;
ing, but boating is my idea of beatitude."&#xD;
"I think you are more than half mer-&#xD;
maid," said Carl.&#xD;
"I wish I were," said she, sighing. "it&#xD;
would be pleasant to live three hundred years,&#xD;
and then be dissolved into sea-foam-even so&#xD;
much better than the prospect of being hag-&#xD;
gard and toothless at threescore 1-Don't you&#xD;
think so, Leslie?"&#xD;
"It is only the exceptional people who&#xD;
live to threescore," said Leslie. "We need&#xD;
not flatter ourselves with the idea of such&#xD;
good luck."&#xD;
"Such bad luck, you mean," answered&#xD;
the other. Then she turned to Carl. "Did&#xD;
you not promise to show me the Dutch sum.&#xD;
mer-liouse where you mean to retire when&#xD;
you feel particularly Teutonic?" she asked.&#xD;
"Is it near here?"&#xD;
"It is not very far of!'. I shall be de-&#xD;
lighted to cicerone you, if you feel inclined&#xD;
to come with me."&#xD;
"Of course I feel inclined," said she.&#xD;
"Should I have spoken of it if I had not?&#xD;
-Leslie, you will excuse us, will you not?&#xD;
-Thanks, Mr. Tyndale" (as Arthur disentan-&#xD;
gled her parasol from the low branch of a&#xD;
tree), "fringe and lace are trQublesome things.&#xD;
-Is it this way, Mr. Middleton?"&#xD;
Graceful and self-possessed as ever, she&#xD;
walked away with Carl, and Leslie would have&#xD;
turned to follow if Tyndale had not inter-&#xD;
fered.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Need we go and look at the summer-&#xD;
house?" he asked. "We know all about it,&#xD;
and the sun is horrihly warm. Let us go&#xD;
back to the house.~~&#xD;
"But I want you to see Norah," said Les-&#xD;
lie. "You have scarcely spoken to her as&#xD;
yet. I w~nt you to know her. You were so&#xD;
right in telling me that she is fascinating!&#xD;
There never was any thing more true. She&#xD;
has fascinated all of us already."&#xD;
"I see that she has fascinated your cous-&#xD;
in," said he, bitterly. "But that is not re-&#xD;
markable I She is the most thorough-paced&#xD;
and unscrupulous coquette I have ever seen 1"&#xD;
"I think you do her injustice!" said Miss&#xD;
Grahame. "She is so beautiful - would it&#xD;
not be strange if she did not like the admi-&#xD;
ration which is offered her? And then, how&#xD;
much of it must have been offered I Enough&#xD;
to spoil the characters and turn the heads of&#xD;
half a dozen ordinary women, you may be&#xD;
sure."&#xD;
"Of course she has been admired," said&#xD;
Tyndale, gloomily. "Nobody could look at&#xD;
her and doubt that. I think she is handsomer&#xD;
than ever 1" he added, in a disgusted tone,&#xD;
for, unconsciously to himself, he had rather&#xD;
cherished the expectation that Norak's brill-&#xD;
iant beauty would have "gone off" in watch-&#xD;
ing for him.&#xD;
"I do not think anybody could be more&#xD;
beautiful!" said Leslie; "and this reminds&#xD;
me to ask if you are quite sure you never&#xD;
knew her when you were abroad?"&#xD;
"Am I quite sure I" repeated Tyndale.&#xD;
His heart seemed to stand still for a minute,&#xD;
his blond complexion changed its color vio-&#xD;
lently two or three times. "Good Heavens,&#xD;
Leslie, what do you mean? Why should I&#xD;
not be sure?"&#xD;
"I thought it was scarcely likely you&#xD;
could be mistaken," said Leslie, with a com-&#xD;
posure that proved how far any thing like&#xD;
suspicion was from 'hee mind, "but Norah&#xD;
seemed to think that she had met you-at&#xD;
least, she spoke of having known some one&#xD;
who was named Tyndale, abroad."&#xD;
"Did she?" said he, with a short gasp.&#xD;
"And you-what did you tell her?"&#xD;
"I told her that it could not have been&#xD;
yourself, for you had distinctly told me that,&#xD;
although you had seen her, you had not known&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"And then?"&#xD;
"Well, then, of course, she said that it&#xD;
&#xD;
must have been another person; but I thought&#xD;
afterward that perhaps you might have been&#xD;
introduced to her-at a ball or some place of&#xD;
that kind-and forgotten it."&#xD;
"Am I likely to have forgotten it?"&#xD;
asked he, breaking into bitterness again.&#xD;
"Is any man likely to forget such a woman?&#xD;
For good or for evil, one would have no al-&#xD;
ternative but to remember her."&#xD;
"I see that you are very much prejudiced&#xD;
against her," said Leslie, looking at him in&#xD;
surprise. "Why do you speak so harshly?&#xD;
Has she ever done any harm to any one whom&#xD;
you know? Aunt Mildred thinks that it must&#xD;
have been your cousin who was the Tyndale&#xD;
she knew abroad. Is it so? and did she&#xD;
break his heart, or otherwise injure him?"&#xD;
"No," said Tyndale, almost savagely.&#xD;
"Max is a lucky fellow-he has too much&#xD;
cool, h~d common-sense to fall into the toils&#xD;
of such a woman as that. Forgive me, Les-&#xD;
lie "-as he caught her pained and half-in-&#xD;
dignant look-" but you know I gave you&#xD;
warning beforehand what manner of person&#xD;
she was."&#xD;
"But I have seen nothing to justify your&#xD;
warning," said Leslie. "I think you must&#xD;
have been listening to the accounts given of&#xD;
her by the enemies whom every beautiful&#xD;
woman is unfortunate enough to possess.&#xD;
Come!" she added, smiling, "come and give&#xD;
her an opportunity to fascinate you. I insist&#xD;
upon it."&#xD;
Despite the smile, he saw that she was in&#xD;
earnest, and, too guiltily conscious of lila mo-&#xD;
tives to make further demur, he went with&#xD;
her along the path where the others had dis-&#xD;
appeared. "After all, perhaps it is best!"&#xD;
he thought. "I must, if possible, see Norah&#xD;
alone for ten minutes. I must know what&#xD;
she intends to do. What did ,she mean by&#xD;
that allusion to me last night? This suspense&#xD;
is more than any man could bear."&#xD;
Meanwhile, Norah and Carl had reached&#xD;
the summer-house, which looked as if it had&#xD;
been imported from Am~terdam, as it crowned&#xD;
a softly-rising knoll in the midst of the shrub-&#xD;
bery. The door stood qpen, and, mounting a&#xD;
flight of steps, they went in. The tiled floor,&#xD;
the quaint roof, the windows latticed with&#xD;
green vines, all seemed like a bit, of still-life&#xD;
from one of Teniers's pictures.&#xD;
"Surely a Hollander or a Fleming must&#xD;
have designed this," said Norah. "It is&#xD;
in the purest style of Dutch architecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
41&#xD;
&#xD;
I have seen a hundred like it in the Low&#xD;
Countries. One almost expects to look out&#xD;
of the window at canals and 'dikes."&#xD;
"The last owner of Rosland was a Dutch-&#xD;
man," said Carl. "I don't think my uncle&#xD;
has owned the place more than twenty years."&#xD;
Then he walked to one of the casements.&#xD;
"The view does not command any canals or&#xD;
dikes," he said, "but it is really beautiful,&#xD;
Miss Desmond. Come and look!"&#xD;
Thus bidden, Norah went and looked. It&#xD;
was certainly a fair, pastoral scene. All&#xD;
around were the green nooks and dells of the&#xD;
shrubbery, while beyond were shadowy woods,&#xD;
rich with midsummer foliage, and ringing&#xD;
with a soft echo of; midsummer mirth, level&#xD;
fields stretching to where a dense growth of&#xD;
willows marked the winding course of the&#xD;
river, and blue hills softly melting into dis-&#xD;
tance far away. From another window they&#xD;
could see the path which led to Strafford, and&#xD;
catch a glimpse of the gabled house rising&#xD;
above its noble oaks.&#xD;
"That is a charming old place, as well as&#xD;
I remember," said Carl. "I should not won-&#xD;
der if it had been instrumental in tempting&#xD;
Leslie. When she was a child, she had the&#xD;
greatest possible fancy for it. By-the-by,&#xD;
what do you think of herjfand? He is good.&#xD;
looking, certainly; but somehow he struck&#xD;
me just a little unpleasantly."&#xD;
"There are few things more unwise than&#xD;
to judge people at first sight," said Miss Des-&#xD;
mond, with the air of one who delivers a&#xD;
grave moral truth. "I have laid it down as&#xD;
a rule of life to distrust first impressions al-&#xD;
ways and most emphatically."&#xD;
"Still, I should like to hear what your&#xD;
first impression of Mr. Tyndale has been,"&#xD;
said he, looking at her. "I have an idea&#xD;
that it is not very different from mine. Am&#xD;
I impertinent?" he added, half laughing, as&#xD;
he saw her change color slightly.&#xD;
"No, you are not impertinent," she an-&#xD;
swered, coolly. "If you were, I should not&#xD;
hesitate to tell you so. But you are inquisi-&#xD;
tive, and that is not usually esteemed the&#xD;
height of civility."&#xD;
"Is it not? Well, I was never much at&#xD;
civility-Leslie will tell you that. But, seri-&#xD;
ously, now, what do you think of the fel-&#xD;
low?"&#xD;
"Seriously, I have not taken the trouble&#xD;
to think of him at all."&#xD;
"Then it must follow that you don't eon-&#xD;

"Whatever ~follows is fortunately not a&#xD;

"He is decidedly a beauty-man-don't&#xD;
you think so?"&#xD;
"Very likely; but I have juever noticed&#xD;

"Don't you like them?"&#xD;
"I scarcely know. I am such an amiable&#xD;
person that I like everybody, except trouble-&#xD;
some people who ask foolish questions."&#xD;
"I should never think of describing you&#xD;
as an amiable person," said he, coloring un-&#xD;
der this rebuke.&#xD;
"Ah! What then-n termagant?"&#xD;
"God only knows-a witch, more likely."&#xD;
"Thanks for the compliment. Witches&#xD;
are always so particularly handsome that I&#xD;
appreciate the full force of it."&#xD;
"A siren, then. A-anything that turns&#xD;
men's heads."&#xD;
"Really, it iS hard to make one answer-&#xD;
able for the vagaries of men's heads. The&#xD;
most of them have so little ballast that they&#xD;
are easily turned."&#xD;
"Your tongue is like a two-edged sword,"&#xD;
said he. "N.o matter whut I say, I am sure&#xD;
to get the worst of it."&#xD;
"And yet you are one of my particular&#xD;
favorites," said she. "There are few people&#xD;
whom I treat with the consideration that I&#xD;
have always shown you."&#xD;
"Heaven help those whom you treat with&#xD;
less, then I"&#xD;
"You say that with great unction; do you&#xD;
fancy them in danger of a scratched face?"&#xD;
"It does not matter what I fancy; but I&#xD;
am sure that any man in his sane senses would&#xD;
rather have his face scratched by you than&#xD;
caressed by any other woman."&#xD;
"Speak for yourself," said she, coldly.&#xD;
And he saw that he had offended her. "It is&#xD;
'not necessary to make your accusation of bad&#xD;
taste so general."&#xD;
"I did not mean-" he began, contritely,&#xD;
but ~uis excuses were out short, for at that&#xD;
moment Leslie and Tyndale appeared at the&#xD;
open door.&#xD;
A~ What a pretty tableau you make!" the&#xD;
former said. "They look like a picture-do&#xD;
they not, Arthur? I should say a Dutch&#xD;
picture, only Norah's Paris dress does not&#xD;
agree very well with our ideas of Dutch art."&#xD;
&#xD;
"She is more like a figure out of a Wat-&#xD;
teau," said Tyndale, with a desperate attempt&#xD;
to appear at ease.&#xD;
"And little enough like that," said Carl.&#xD;
"Her dress, perhaps, may be-but Watteau&#xD;
never painted such a face! The colors have&#xD;
never been mixed, save on the palettes of&#xD;
Titian or Rubens, to do Miss Desmond jus-&#xD;
tice."&#xD;
"Norab, how do you like to be Qiseussed&#xD;
in such cool fashion, as if you were really a&#xD;
picture?" asked Leslie, smiling. "I sup.&#xD;
pose you grow used to it, however; and, to a&#xD;
beautiful woman, all flattery must be tame&#xD;
after that of her mirror. What have you&#xD;
two been talking about?" she went on, ad-&#xD;
vancing into the summer - house. "As we&#xD;
came up you looked not only comfortable,&#xD;
but confidential."&#xD;
"Every thing relating to the nature of&#xD;
man comes under the head of philosophy,~~&#xD;
said Carl, gravely; "therefore, we have been&#xD;
talking philosophy."&#xD;
"After the fashion of Punch," said Norab.&#xD;
"What is mind? No ma12ter. What is mat-&#xD;
ter? Never mind. What is the nature of&#xD;
the soul? It is immaterial."&#xD;
"That is capital 1" said Carl. "I shall&#xD;
send it to a friend of mine in Germany. It&#xD;
will do him good."&#xD;
"Are you sure you don't need it your.&#xD;
self?" suggested ~he. "It is never well to&#xD;
be too generous. Yen remind me of the pee.&#xD;
pie who, whenever a particularly telling point&#xD;
is made in a sermon, think how well that&#xD;
suits their, brother, or their sister, or their&#xD;
neighbor over the way."&#xD;
"But Punch's sarcasm does not affect me&#xD;
at all," said he, sincerely, "for no man ever&#xD;
troubled himself less than I do about such&#xD;
questions. I would not give one day of gold-&#xD;
en idleness like this for the whole of Kant&#xD;
and Jean Paul."&#xD;
"It is pleasant!" said Leslie. "Norah&#xD;
is right: even at the expense of becoming a&#xD;
little tanned, one ought to live in the open air&#xD;
in summer. It is a pity that I must go to&#xD;
the house and write some tiresome letters for&#xD;
the wail, is it not ?-No, I won't be selfish&#xD;
enough to take you" (as Tyndale started&#xD;
forward with alacrity). "I believe I would&#xD;
rather have Carl. I can make him write one&#xD;
or two of them for me."&#xD;
"Heavens and earth, Leslie!" said Carl.&#xD;
* "You can't be in earnest 1 - you don't se-&#xD;

&#xD;
"I doubt if you understand me at all," he&#xD;
said. "For the matter of that~ I doubt if&#xD;
you ever did understand me."&#xD;
"Did I not?" said she, with indifference.&#xD;
"It mutt have been owing to my own want&#xD;
of attention, then -certainly not to any thing&#xD;
particularly abstruse in the nature of the sub-&#xD;
ject. I cannot say that I have acquired any&#xD;
new degree of interest since I had the pleas-&#xD;
nrc of seeing you last," she went on, calmly.&#xD;
"I can imagine," he said, quickly, "that&#xD;
you may have learned to feel very bitterly&#xD;
toward me. But, if you will only suffer me&#xD;
to explain-"&#xD;
She interrupted him by a~ gesture, which&#xD;
be never forgot.&#xD;
"You mistake my meaning entirely," she&#xD;
said. "Feel bitterly toward you I Why&#xD;
should I? Explain? What is there to ex-&#xD;
plain?"&#xD;
Her eyes faced him with such steady lus.&#xD;
tre that his own lids fell. He realized then&#xD;
how unequal he was to ~the encounter he had&#xD;
provoked. What could he say to such a&#xD;
woman as this? He had never been a match&#xD;
for her-he knew that well-she had always&#xD;
been a perverse and tantalizing enigma to&#xD;
him; but he had never felt so hopelessly be-&#xD;
wildered as now. The cool disdain with&#xD;
which it pleased her to treat the past was so&#xD;
different from the passionate resentment he&#xD;
had expected, that he felt wholly unable to&#xD;
cope with it. Catching' desperately at the&#xD;
first idea which presented itself, he uttered&#xD;
the very last thing which should have found&#xD;
expression on his lips.&#xD;
"Norah," he said, passionately, "it is im-&#xD;
possible for you to have forgotten that you&#xD;
loved me once I"&#xD;
Instantly he read his mistake in the glow&#xD;
which came into' her eyes, in the haughty&#xD;
curve of her clear-cut, resolute mouth.&#xD;
"How entirely you are pleased to justify&#xD;
my opinion of your character, Mr. Tyndale!"&#xD;
she said, in a tone so full of contemptuous&#xD;
meaning that it cut like a whip. "But you&#xD;
must pardon me if I say that you flatter your-&#xD;
self too much. If all the men with whom I&#xD;
have chanced to amuse myself were kind&#xD;
enough to say that I 'loved them once,' I&#xD;
should be credited with a most facile and im~&#xD;
pressionable heart, indeed."&#xD;
Looking at the beautiful, proud face, at&#xD;
the brilliant, scornful eyes, a sudden, 'horri-&#xD;
ble fear that she might be speaking truth&#xD;
&#xD;
came over him. I havc written the word hor-&#xD;
rible advisedly; for, to a man of Arthur Tyn.&#xD;
dale's stamp, there was something inexpres-&#xD;
sibly humiliating in the mere suspicion that&#xD;
1w-so magnificent in worldly gifts, so full&#xD;
of worldly knowledge-should have blindly&#xD;
served as the plaything of a coquette. The&#xD;
thought of his own broken faith lie could face&#xD;
with due philosophy, but the idea of having&#xD;
been entwined in such a net as that which an-&#xD;
noyed and cramped him at present, for the&#xD;
mere amusement of a "Bohemian adventu-&#xD;
ress," was more than he could endure.&#xD;
"You know that you are insinuating what&#xD;
is not true!" he said, forgetting courtesy,&#xD;
chivalry, every thing, in the sharp stab under&#xD;
which his pride was writhing. "You know&#xD;
that, whatever else I may or may not have&#xD;
been, I was something more than material&#xD;
for amusement to you!"&#xD;
"Were you? " she said, quietly; but&#xD;
there was that in her eyes which might have&#xD;
warned him that this calm boded no good.&#xD;
"You must excuse my forgetfulness of the&#xD;
fact. I rarely trouble myself to remember&#xD;
any thing of the past-except my debts."&#xD;
The significance of the last words were&#xD;
not lost on him; but, feeling that the con-&#xD;
versation had taken a wrong turn-conscious&#xD;
that he was doing himself infinitely more&#xD;
harm than good-he caught eagerly at this&#xD;
the first opportunity she had given him to&#xD;
learn what she really meant to do.&#xD;
"You have-or you may think that your&#xD;
have-a debt against me," he said, quickly.&#xD;
"How do you mean to pay that, Norah?"&#xD;
"Have I a debt against you, Mr. Tyn.&#xD;
dale?" said she, with a kind of mocking sur-&#xD;
prise. "I am afraid I must ask you to re-&#xD;
fresh my memory with regard to it. Past&#xD;
follies are the things of all others which I&#xD;
most readily forget." -&#xD;
"You are trying my patience!" he said,&#xD;
setting his teeth savagely. "But you would&#xD;
do well to remember that you may try it a&#xD;
little too far."&#xD;
"And what of mine?" she asked, with&#xD;
the well-remembered Celtic passion suddenly&#xD;
blazing out upon him from every eloquent&#xD;
feature. "Do you think that, because I&#xD;
have chosen to ignore your insults, I have&#xD;
not felt and shall not remember them?&#xD;
Your knowledge of me might have helped&#xD;
you to judge better than that. We have met&#xD;
to-day as strangers," she ~vent on, after a&#xD;

also, that, if you ever presume to address&#xD;

means of remedy are in my hands, and I shall&#xD;
not hesitate to use them unsparingly."&#xD;
" If you are attempting to threaten me-"&#xD;
he began, with the air of a Bayard.&#xD;
But she interrupted him with cool de-&#xD;
cision.-&#xD;
" Pardon me, I am merely placing a plain&#xD;
alternative before you. Having done so, there&#xD;
is nothing more to add. The past of my life&#xD;
in which you have played a short and most&#xD;
unworthy part, is dead forever, and God is&#xD;
my witness "-extending her white arm with&#xD;
sudden, passionate energy-" that, if I could&#xD;
drain my blood to wash out its last lingering&#xD;
memory, I would gladly do so ! With my fu.-&#xD;
ture you have no connection. It is not neces-&#xD;
sary to remind me that you wish none "-as&#xD;
his lips unclosed. "L I will take that for grant-&#xD;

tion with you would be the last, worst evil&#xD;
which Fate could send to me. Now, will you&#xD;

Couched in the form of a request, these&#xD;
words were, in truth, little more than an im-&#xD;
perious command; but, conscious in what&#xD;
bungling fashion he had gone to work-con-&#xD;
scious that he had learned literally nothing&#xD;
of that which he most desired to know-&#xD;
Tyndale made one last effort.&#xD;
-" For God's sake, Norah, don't send me&#xD;
away like this !" he said, eagerly. " How&#xD;
can I tell when I may be able to speak to you&#xD;
again; and I-I must know what you mean&#xD;
to do ! Any certainty is better than-"&#xD;
He stopped short. Though he was stand-&#xD;
ing with his back to the door, something in&#xD;
Norah's eyes suddenly warned him of anoth-&#xD;
er presence in the summer-house besides their&#xD;
own. Turning sharply, he faced Carl Mid-&#xD;
dieton. -&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.-&#xD;
" To-morrow we meet the same, then, dearest ?&#xD;
May I take your hand in mine ?&#xD;
Mere friends are we-well, friends the merest&#xD;
Keep much that I'll resign."&#xD;
THERE was a second's awkward pause.&#xD;
Then Middleton had sufficient presence of&#xD;
mind to come forward, as if he saw no thing&#xD;
&#xD;
45&#xD;
&#xD;
unusual in the faces or the attitudes before&#xD;
him.&#xD;
" Am I not lucky to get off duty so soon ?"&#xD;
he said. " When we reached the house, Les-&#xD;
lie found some visitors, and I at once slipped&#xD;
away -grateful enough to them for having&#xD;
come, you may be sure."&#xD;
" You are lucky," said Norah, smiling-&#xD;
she had well - trained muscles, for no one&#xD;
could have told from that smile how her&#xD;
pulses were beating, with a rush which made&#xD;
itself felt in one vibrating thrill through her&#xD;
whole body -" I congratulate you on your&#xD;
escape, and I am glad to see you back-very&#xD;
glad !" she added, with an unmistakable ac-&#xD;
.cent of sincerity. /    -&#xD;
The young man flushed a little-evidently&#xD;
with pleasure. "You are very kind to say&#xD;
so," he answered. " I am glad to find you&#xD;
still here. I thought you might have wan-&#xD;
dered away somewhere-only it is scorching&#xD;
out in the sun."&#xD;
" Too scorching for wandering, I should&#xD;
think," said she, and she sat down almost wea-&#xD;
rily as she spoke-having, in truth, good cause&#xD;
to be weary after the battle she had fought.&#xD;
" Do you feel tired ?" asked Carl, quick-&#xD;
ly. "Absolutely, for once in a way, you look&#xD;
pale."&#xD;
"Do I? That is strange-heat ought to&#xD;
flush, ought it not ? Suppose you come and&#xD;
play the part of Zephyr," she added, holding&#xD;
out her fan. " You don't object, do you ?"&#xD;
Object ! No one could have. suspected&#xD;
him of such a sentiment who saw the eager-&#xD;
ness with which he advanced, and, taking the&#xD;
pretty toy, began to -play the part rather'of&#xD;
Bloreas than of Zephyr. *&#xD;
" There !-that will do !" said she. " I&#xD;
don't want to be blown away entirely. Are&#xD;
you going, Mr. Tyndale ? Pray tell Leslie&#xD;
that I will follow as soon as I can summon&#xD;
sufficient resolution for the effort. If you&#xD;
could only order up a cloud or two for; our&#xD;
benefit, it would be a great relief."&#xD;
" I am sorry that I cannot-do even that&#xD;
much in your service," said Tyndale, with&#xD;
more bitterness than it was wise to have dis-&#xD;
played; but he could not entirely repress the&#xD;
exasperation which he felt in seeing another&#xD;
man enjoy before hbis very eyes tlie place he&#xD;
had lost or resigned-it did not, at that mo-&#xD;
ment, matter which.&#xD;
" Tell Leslie to send an umbrella, won't&#xD;
you?" said Carl, in his offhand fashion. "It&#xD;
&#xD;

46                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.                                           CARL MIDDLETON'S PROPOSAL.             47&#xD;
&#xD;
was awfully thoughtless of me not to have&#xD;
brought one."&#xD;
Thus, burdened with a double message,&#xD;
Mr. Tyndale took his departure-descending&#xD;
the steps of the pavilion, and walking away&#xD;
down an arcade which led to the house. As&#xD;
Norah looked after him, the scene made a&#xD;
picture which she never forgot-the vivid&#xD;
sunlight quivering on the deep-green foliage,&#xD;
the flickering net - work of. shadows falling&#xD;
softly over the ~mooth turf, the blue sky&#xD;
flecked here and there with fleecy clouds, and&#xD;
the slender, graceful figure, thrown into re-&#xD;
lief by the summer landscape and the golden&#xD;
light.&#xD;
When she glanced back at Carl Middleton,&#xD;
however, and saw by the look in his eyes that&#xD;
lie had been watching her, a suddeii blush&#xD;
rose to her face.&#xD;
"It is very ill-bred to stare at people!"&#xD;
she said, sharply. "I have told you so be-&#xD;
fore, and you know that I dislike it particu-&#xD;
larly."&#xD;
"Is it ill-bred?" asked lie. "This is the&#xD;
second time to-day that you have convicted&#xD;
inc of a solecism of good manners. But, if it&#xD;
is ill-hi-ed, why were you stai-ing at Mr. Tyn.&#xD;
dale?"&#xD;
"I was not staring at him," she answered,&#xD;
with a flash in her eye which showed the ig-&#xD;
nited spark of a quick temper. "You are&#xD;
very impertinent to venture to say so! There&#xD;
is a very great difference between staring and&#xD;
-and looking at a person."&#xD;
I was only looking at you," lie said,&#xD;
quietly. "One stares, does one *not, when&#xD;
one means to be impertinent? Now, I cer-&#xD;
tainly did not mean that, for I was engaged&#xD;
in wondering why you looked at Tyndale in&#xD;
just that way!"&#xD;
" In just what way?" asked she, carelessly.&#xD;
"lie has a good figure and carries it well. I&#xD;
like both things in a man-and, liking them,&#xD;
I like also to watch them."&#xD;
"Yet the expression of your face did not&#xD;
look much as if you were thinking of his fig-&#xD;
ure, or of his walk," said Middleton. "It&#xD;
- looked rather as if you were thinking of&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"Your impertinence appears to be ascend-&#xD;
ing in the scale of comparison," said she, "but,&#xD;
* for the novelty of' the thing, I am rather in-&#xD;
ehin~id to humor it. So, granting that I was&#xD;
thinking of him-what then?"&#xD;
"I have already been impertinent in the&#xD;
&#xD;
positive and comparative degrees, have I&#xD;
not?" he asked, in return. "Then I might&#xD;
as well be impertinent in the superlative, and&#xD;
ask u/wi you were thinking of him."&#xD;
She laughed. She was recovering herself,&#xD;
and any thing like a tilt of Words and wit&#xD;
always pleased her.&#xD;
"Do you chance to remember what hot-&#xD;
spur answered when Owen Glendower boasted&#xD;
that he could call spirits from the vasty deep ?"&#xD;
she inquired. "'So can I; but will they come?'&#xD;
Now it strikes me that is rather apphicihble to&#xD;
your question. It is asked, but will it be an-&#xD;
swered?"&#xD;
"I am more resigned than you imagine,&#xD;
perhaps," he said; "for I have a suspicion&#xD;
that the answer would not be likely to please&#xD;
me if it were given."&#xD;
"Are you, then, so deeply interested in&#xD;
Mr. Tyndale that an unfavorable opinion of&#xD;
him might distress you?&#xD;
"I am not interested in 1/i-. 2)~udale at&#xD;
all," he answered, dryly.&#xD;
"Oh, in Leslie's Jianci? Iliad really for-&#xD;
gotten for a moment that he filled that posi-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"Nor in Leslie'sfiaaci," said he. "I had&#xD;
forgotten, too, for a minute, that he filled that&#xD;
position. It would be a little strange, would&#xD;
it not, if he should prove to have been afflicted&#xD;
with the same lapse of memory regarding the&#xD;
same fact?"&#xD;
She glanced at him keenly. The signifi-&#xD;
cance of his tone made her sure that he had&#xD;
overheard more than she supposed of her con-&#xD;
versation with Tyndale.&#xD;
"It is not likely that lie could have for-&#xD;
gotten such a fact," she answered, coldly.&#xD;
"But it does not concern either you or me&#xD;
if he had."&#xD;
"It concerns mc I" said he, quickly. "You&#xD;
may rest assured of that, Miss Desmond."&#xD;
"As Leslie's cousin, I suppose," said she,&#xD;
composedly. "But do cousins usually take&#xD;
quite so -much upon themselves in Amer-&#xD;
ica?"&#xD;
"I am not Leslie's cousin, save by eour-&#xD;
tesy," lie replied; "and I should never dream&#xD;
of taking any thing upon myself in her behalf.&#xD;
She has defenders enough, if defenders were&#xD;
needed. But, on your behalf, I might he&#xD;
tempted to take a good deal."&#xD;
"On my behalf!" said Norah-and she&#xD;
started in spite of her consummate self-con-&#xD;
trol. "What need have I of a dcfend~r, or-&#xD;
&#xD;
if I needed a hundred-what right have you&#xD;
to assume the duties of the position?"&#xD;
"T have two rights," answered he. "One&#xD;
is your need of me; the other is my love for&#xD;
you&#xD;
"Indeed!" said Norah. She felt at her&#xD;
ease now. When a man began to make love,&#xD;
she knew exactly what to do and what to say.&#xD;
It was as much her native heath as Rob Roy's&#xD;
famous -heather was to him. "Oh, this was&#xD;
all !" she thought, with a curious mixture of&#xD;
relief and disappointment. It was a relief to&#xD;
find that his innuendoes with regard to Tyii-&#xD;
dale had only this meaning; yet there was&#xD;
disappointment in the quick fall from the ex-&#xD;
citement of combat to the blank sameness of&#xD;
love-making. "But that is all nonsenm, you&#xD;
know," she added, after a short pause. "I&#xD;
deny both your rights in tote! I have not&#xD;
the slightest need of you; in fact, I should&#xD;
not have an idea what to do with you if Iliad&#xD;
you; while that which you arc pleased to&#xD;
term your love for me is only a penchant for&#xD;
pretty faces and flirtation in general applied&#xD;
to a particular person."&#xD;
"Mock at me, if you please," said he, pal-&#xD;
ing, but speaking steadily. "I expected nothing&#xD;
else. You never give any thing else to me.&#xD;
All the same, the day may come when you&#xD;
will need me, and then I shall not ask your&#xD;
leave to be your defender. I have said more&#xD;
than I should have done, perhaps, about the&#xD;
man who left us a few minutes ago," he went&#xD;
on. "I have probably made you believe&#xD;
that I overheard more than I really did of&#xD;
your conversation. In truth, I overheard&#xD;
only his last speech. But this speech was&#xD;
not necessary to prove to me that he had&#xD;
spoken falsely when he said lie never met&#xD;
you abroad. Your face told me that last&#xD;
night. His face told m~ so this morning."&#xD;
She was looking at him intently while he&#xD;
spoke. When he finished she made no at-&#xD;
tempt at evasion. -&#xD;
I was feeling my way last night," she&#xD;
said. "I wanted to learn how much he had de-&#xD;
nied. It is strange that my face should have&#xD;
betrayed me," she added, with a dispassionate&#xD;
air of surprise. "It never did such a thing&#xD;
before."&#xD;
"I am sure that it did not betray you to&#xD;
any one besides myself," he answered. "Leslie&#xD;
suspects nothing. You must see that"&#xD;
"Yes, I see that," she assented.&#xD;
"But, in saying that she suspects nothing,&#xD;
&#xD;
I do not mean to imply that it might not be&#xD;
well for her to know something," he added,&#xD;
quickly.&#xD;
"Do you mean that you intend to inform&#xD;
her of what you know?" she asked, looking&#xD;
at him again with the peculiarly keen glance&#xD;
which her eyes sometimes possessed.&#xD;
"You cannQt seriously suspect me of such&#xD;
an intention," said he, almost angrily; "even&#xD;
if I knew any thing-which I do not."&#xD;
"You know enough to make mischief,"&#xD;
said she. "There are many people who do&#xD;
not need to know more than that."&#xD;
"If you think me one of' them, it proves&#xD;
that you have honored me with very little&#xD;
attention during the pime that we have been&#xD;
acquaintances."&#xD;
"Now you are angry with me," said she,&#xD;
smiling; "else you would not speak of our&#xD;
being 'acquaintances' in such a frigid tone&#xD;
-that, too, after offering yourself to me as a&#xD;
defender in the most lavish and generous&#xD;
manner! Will it put you in a good-humor&#xD;
to say that I never fancied for a moment that&#xD;
you would interfere in a matter which has&#xD;
only accidentally come to your knowledge,&#xD;
and which does not concern you in the&#xD;
least? "&#xD;
"You are quite right," said he. "I shall&#xD;
not think of interfering, as far as Leslie is&#xD;
concerned; but I bind myself with no pledge&#xD;
that will keep me from interfering as far as&#xD;
you are concerned."&#xD;
"I think you must be mad," said she,&#xD;
candidly. "In the name of common-sense&#xD;
and common reason (if you know any thing&#xD;
about those things !), what have you to do&#xD;
with mc?"&#xD;
"I have already told you what I have to&#xD;
do ~vith you," answered lie.&#xD;
She leaned back, and looked at him with&#xD;
a laugh in her eye, which for once his glance&#xD;
did not return.&#xD;
"It is really a comfort to have one ludi-&#xD;
crous element in an affair which promises to&#xD;
be rather tiresome and troublesome on the&#xD;
whole," she said; "but, despite your absurd-&#xD;
ity, you must be aware that no claim of the&#xD;
kin~l holds good unless sanctioned by the per-&#xD;
son in whose behalf you make it."&#xD;
"Permit me to say that you totally misin-&#xD;
terpret the nature of the claim I make," an-&#xD;
swered he, with a face more pale and firm than&#xD;
any one had ever seen Carl Middleton wear be-&#xD;
fore. The straight lines between his brows&#xD;

&#xD;
had deepened; the volatile, laughter-loving&#xD;
expression had left his mouth. Just then he&#xD;
looked like a iuan with whom not even a beau-&#xD;
tiful woman might care to trifle. "It is you&#xD;
who mistake," he said. "I have made no&#xD;
claim that needs your sanction. I love you-&#xD;
I have told you that before, have I not?-&#xD;
and, loving you, I hold my.life subject to&#xD;
your service. I shall defend you frokn in-&#xD;
sult, and guard you from contempt, as much&#xD;
as if you had extended your hand and chosen&#xD;
me before the world."&#xD;
"I believe I said, a moment ago, that I&#xD;
thought you were crazy," returned Norab,&#xD;
coldly. "Now I think that you are melo-&#xD;
dramatic. Of the two, I prefer the latter&#xD;
phase of character least."&#xD;
"You do not think that I am in earnest?"&#xD;
cried he, passionately. "You do not believe&#xD;
that I mean every word I utter. Ilow little&#xD;
your boasted knowledge of human nature has&#xD;
taught you, then, after all 1"&#xD;
"It has taught me more than you thin1~,&#xD;
perhaps," said she, rising to her feet. "It&#xD;
has taught me when to end such folly as this.&#xD;
Good-morning, Mr. Middleton, and allow me&#xD;
to hope that you will be a little more sane&#xD;
and reasonable when I sec you again.~~&#xD;
"I shall not detain you after the manner&#xD;
of that cur whom I found standing between&#xD;
you ~nd the door," said he; "but if you will&#xD;
listen to me for a moment, I should like to&#xD;
ask if love is such a common thing with you&#xD;
that you can afford to throw it away like this?"&#xD;
"The fitful admiration and school - boy&#xD;
passion which you choose to dignify with the&#xD;
name of love, has certainly been sufficiently&#xD;
common in my experience," answered she,&#xD;
haughtily. "You are not the first man who&#xD;
has thought that love - making might be a&#xD;
pleasant variation to flirtation with a Bohe-&#xD;
mian like myself-nor the first who has dis-&#xD;
covered his mistake, let me add."&#xD;
"How little you know what I feel for you&#xD;
when you can do me such injustice!" said&#xD;
he, quickly. "Flirtation!" - he uttered a&#xD;
short laugh-" Good Heavens! As if I were&#xD;
mad enough to dream of flirting with you!&#xD;
As if I should not be the happiest man on all&#xD;
God'searth if you would only put your hand&#xD;
in mine and promise to marry me!"&#xD;
"And how long would you be happy?"&#xD;
asked she. "Not to speak of your friends,&#xD;
who would be scarcely likely to be happy at&#xD;
all."&#xD;
&#xD;
"My friends have nothing to do with me,"&#xD;
he answered. "My life and my fortune are&#xD;
my own. Being my own, I ask nothing bet-&#xD;
ter than to dedicate them to your service."&#xD;
"You are very kind," said she, with the&#xD;
same provoking and impassive composure;&#xD;
"but t really have not the least use for&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"Not even the use of convenience?"&#xD;
asked he, a little bitterly. "Stop, Miss Des-&#xD;
mond, and think! It is not often that a man&#xD;
puts himself so unreservedly in your hands&#xD;
as I hav~e dQne. Say but one word, and the&#xD;
man who insulted you here a little while ago&#xD;
shall answer for it as he never dreamed of&#xD;
answering when lie was coward enough to de-&#xD;
tain you!"&#xD;
~' And do you think that I need your hot&#xD;
blood, or your clumsy, masculine hand to&#xD;
espouse my cause?" asked she, with a smile&#xD;
of scorn rippling over her face. "Do you&#xD;
think I am not able to pay with interest-&#xD;
much more than interest, indeed-every frac-&#xD;
tion of debt I owe Arthur Tyndale? Do you&#xD;
fancy that I have come here for any other&#xD;
purpose than that I may pay it, in the time&#xD;
and in the manner that seem best to&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"I know that you are much too clever to&#xD;
need any assistance from me," he said, in&#xD;
rather a crestfallen tone; "but there are&#xD;
some things that only a mt~n's hand can do-&#xD;
clumsy as you think it."&#xD;
"It requires a man's hand to take anotli-&#xD;
er man by the throat, I'll admit," said she.&#xD;
"But I have studied in the school of Machi-&#xD;
avelli, and that is not my mode of dealing&#xD;
with those who wish or intend to do me&#xD;
wrong."&#xD;
"After all, it is the best and shortest&#xD;
mode," said he, doggedly. "Fine words and&#xD;
fine actions are lost on curs."&#xD;
"I have not the faintest idea of bestow.&#xD;
ing any fine words or fine actions on any-&#xD;
body," said she, coolly.&#xD;
"You seem to have no intention of be-&#xD;
sto~ving any words at all on me," said he,&#xD;
looking at her with a certain passionate re-&#xD;
proach in his eyes. "Is it because you do&#xD;
not think me worth them? Yet, certainly,&#xD;
no man ever loved you better than I do, and,&#xD;
having offered you all that is mine to give, I&#xD;
ask for an answer-even though it is only&#xD;
likely to be a rejection."&#xD;
"You are right-it is only likely to be&#xD;
&#xD;
that," said she, holding out her hand to him&#xD;
with a sudden softening expression of her&#xD;
face. "But still I must thank you for hav-&#xD;
ing spoken as you have done - for having&#xD;
treated me as if I were as much your equal&#xD;
in all things as in blood. When a woman&#xD;
has lived the life I have, she learns how to&#xD;
appreciate courtesy and chivalry better than&#xD;
those who have known them from their cra-&#xD;
dles. Of all the many men who have loved&#xD;
or fancied that they loved me, you are one of&#xD;
the few who have had the courage to pro-&#xD;
nounce the word marriage. Now, although&#xD;
I do not intend to take advantage of your&#xD;
generosity, I cannot fail to like you the better&#xD;
for it."&#xD;
"And is there no hope that this liking&#xD;
may grow into love?" asked he, clasping&#xD;
eagerly in both his own the hand she had&#xD;
given. "If you can only say so, I-I shall&#xD;
be so patient to wait!"&#xD;
"But I am not sure that it would be right&#xD;
for me to say so," answered she, her eyes&#xD;
fastened as calmly on his face as if he had&#xD;
been a sexagenarian, the clear, rose-brilliance&#xD;
of her cheek undeepened by a shade-" I do&#xD;
not think it is in the least probable that I&#xD;
shall ever like you better than I do at pres-&#xD;
ent. Not but that you are more agreeable to&#xD;
me than the majority of men," she added,&#xD;
candidly.&#xD;
"Then promise to marry me!" said he,&#xD;
impetuously. "Take me as a convenience,&#xD;
as a means of 'establishment,' as any thing&#xD;
under heaven, so that you do take me, and&#xD;
that you like no other man better than you&#xD;
like me. At least, if you marry me,, you will&#xD;
be done with Bohemia," said he, wistfully.&#xD;
"You will be moderately rich, perfectly free,&#xD;
and passionately loved. Norah, are not these&#xD;
things worth a sacrifice?"&#xD;
"No!" answered Norah-and the clear,&#xD;
sharp monosyllable seemed to cut the air as&#xD;
Saladin's sword cleaved its way through the&#xD;
silken cushion-" no!" she repeated, "good&#xD;
as these things are, and naturally attractive&#xD;
to a waif and stray like myself, they are dis-&#xD;
tinctly not worth the sacrifice of self-respect&#xD;
and independence. You look surprised?&#xD;
I believe a woman in your world is not sup-&#xD;
posed to suffer any loss of self-respect when&#xD;
she barters herself away for a good establish-&#xD;
ment-but we think differently in Bohemia.&#xD;
I should hold that I had done you a great&#xD;
wrong if I married you for any one of the&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
reasons you have mentioned; and I should&#xD;
certainly feel that I had justified the opinion~&#xD;
of all those who are good enough to consider&#xD;
me an adventuress!"&#xD;
"But if you loved me, Norah?"&#xD;
"If I loved you I should marry you, let;&#xD;
the whole world say what it would," answered&#xD;
she, with a smile so bright and so defiant&#xD;
that it thrilled him to the heart. "I do not&#xD;
love you, however, and I have not the least;&#xD;
desire to marry anybody; so you see we h e&#xD;
wasted a great deal of time in talking a ut;&#xD;
something which is not likely to eo e to~&#xD;
pass. By-the-by, don't you think it is time&#xD;
for you to let my hand go? You are really&#xD;
hurting it."&#xD;
She took it from him before he could car-&#xD;
ry it to his lips, as he plainly intended to d~,&#xD;
adding, with a nonchalance which was not par-&#xD;
ticularly encouraging to a crestfallen suitor&#xD;
"I won't say let us try and forget what&#xD;
has passed, because that is all nonsense -&#xD;
few are able to forget disagreeable things&#xD;
just when they please-but I do say let us&#xD;
try to avoid any constraint or awkwardness.&#xD;
It is so inconvenient and so absurd! We&#xD;
like each other as well as we did before, and,&#xD;
after all, it is a good thing to have had a.&#xD;
clear explanation, and settled matters."&#xD;
"It may be a good thing," said he, a little&#xD;
doubtfully, "but it has not settled as much&#xD;
as you think. If I do not exactly make the&#xD;
boast of Philip of Spain, and say, 'Time and&#xD;
I against any two!' I know that time some-&#xD;
times works wonders for any one who loves&#xD;
as well as I do-and then I am your defender&#xD;
and champion if you had rejected me a hun-&#xD;
dred times!"&#xD;
"When will you understand that I am my&#xD;
own defender, and that I need no champion?"&#xD;
asked she, impatiently. "What folly you&#xD;
talk! But then you are young-something&#xD;
must be allowed for that, I suppose. Now,&#xD;
let usgo back to the house, for I see that we&#xD;
are likely to continue talking in a circle as&#xD;
long as we stay here, and really the weather&#xD;
is too warm for such excessive loquacity."&#xD;
Back to the house they went accordingly&#xD;
- in more amicable companionship than&#xD;
might perhaps be imagined, for Norah Des-&#xD;
mond was not ~ woman to allow a man to be&#xD;
ill at ease in her society. It was a point of&#xD;
pride with her, indeed, that she had a very&#xD;
effective way of dissipating any thing like&#xD;
constraint when she chose to do so. With&#xD;

A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Middleton she did choose, and, before they&#xD;
reached the house, she had so tantalized,&#xD;
amused, and charmed him, that he was more&#xD;
hopelessly and desperately in love than ever.&#xD;
If she had been asked why she did this, she&#xD;
woidd probably have answered that she liked&#xD;
the pleasant young fellow in his way, and&#xD;
that, since it was certain that they would in-&#xD;
habit the same house for some time to come,&#xD;
it would be exceedingly disagreeable to be on&#xD;
stiff or formal terms with him. In truth,&#xD;
being a wo~nan accustomed to exercise pow-&#xD;

not fancy the idea of surrendering the only&#xD;
homage which was available just then, and,&#xD;
consequently, she exerted herself to make&#xD;
Carl understand that there need be no change&#xD;
in their relation to each other. "You really&#xD;
ought to be obliged to inc for not leaving ac-&#xD;
cepted you," she said to him.&#xD;
"If Iliad, whom would youfiirt with? You&#xD;
would be in as bad a condition as the French-&#xD;
man, who asked where he should spend his&#xD;
evenings when advised to marry the Jady&#xD;
with whom he had spent them for twenty&#xD;
years.~~&#xD;
"I have nothing of the Frenchman~in my&#xD;
composition," said he, "but, if it were abso-&#xD;
lutely necessary for mc to flirt with some-&#xD;
body, I might find Mrs. Sandford useful in an&#xD;
emergency. Leslie tails me that she will be&#xD;
here in a day or two,"&#xD;
"And who is Mrs. Sandford?"&#xD;
"A person of note in a small way. She&#xD;
was a fast young lady when I left home;&#xD;
afterward I heard that she was a fast married&#xD;
woman; now she is a fast widow."&#xD;
"She has run the gamut, then, of fastness&#xD;
in all conditions of life. What a study she&#xD;
will be for me! I have not an idea what&#xD;
constitutes a fast woman on this side of the&#xD;
Atlantic, though I know very well what con-&#xD;
stitutes it on the other."&#xD;
The house looked cool and airy when they&#xD;
entered it. In the wide halt there was a&#xD;
pleasant green light from the closed blinds&#xD;
at each door, which kept out the fierce noon-&#xD;
day glare. Chairs and lounges were placed&#xD;
there; books, newspapers, and work, were&#xD;
scattered about-every thing showed that it&#xD;
was a favorite and informal gathering-place&#xD;
of the family. Mrs. Middleton, who was&#xD;
seated alone, looked up as they entered.&#xD;
"Did you not find it very warm?" she&#xD;
asked. "Leslie reported the heat to be in-&#xD;
&#xD;
tense, and Mr. Tyndale seemed almost over-&#xD;
powered by it. I was opposed to his walking&#xD;
back to Strafford; but he insisted upor~ going&#xD;
-young people are always so obstinate Z"&#xD;
"So Tyndale went back, did he?" said&#xD;
Cail. "If the heat was so overpowering, I&#xD;
wonder he walked over simply for the sake&#xD;
of spending hall an hour or so with Leslie."&#xD;
"He came as an act of courtesy to Miss&#xD;
Desmond, I think," answered Mrs Middleton,&#xD;
in her stately way. "Otherwise, he would&#xD;
have been kept at home by a business en-&#xD;
gagement all the morning, he said. Tie has&#xD;
promised to dine with us this evening, how-&#xD;
ever-and his cousin," she added, turning to&#xD;
Norah; "so you will be able to see more of&#xD;
him."&#xD;
Miss Desmond bowed with the air of one&#xD;
profoundly grateful for such a privilege.&#xD;
"Is the cousin at all like Mr. Tyndale?"&#xD;
she asked, by way of a diversion that would&#xD;
not be too far away from the subject to excite&#xD;
attention.&#xD;
"Not in the least," answered Leslie's gay&#xD;
voice behind her. "Fancy Arthur's opposite&#xD;
in every thing-that is Captain Tyndale!"&#xD;
"You don't like him, then, I suppose?"&#xD;
said tjarh&#xD;
"And pray, why should that follow?"&#xD;
asked she.&#xD;
"If he is the exact opposite of your Prince&#xD;
Charming, I don't see how you could con-&#xD;
veniently manage to like both of them."&#xD;
"There are things which 'differ, in order&#xD;
to correspond,' Mr. Philosopher," said she,&#xD;
smiling. "Want of similarity is not always&#xD;
want of harmony. I should be very ungrate-&#xD;
ful if I did not like Captain Tyndale, for he&#xD;
certainly is very fond of Arthur."&#xD;
"Did you not say that he is half a French-&#xD;
man?" asked Miss Desmond. "How does&#xD;
that happen?"&#xD;
"His father was attached to the American&#xD;
legation in Paris," said Mrs. Middleton, who&#xD;
had one of those memories of the old school,&#xD;
that never forget a genealogical point. "He&#xD;
married a Frenchwoman, and, after that, lived&#xD;
principally in France. So it came to pass&#xD;
that Captain Tyndale is half French in blood,&#xD;
and almost wholly French in training."&#xD;
"I suppose he cannot be reasonably blamed&#xD;
for either %hct," said Carl; "but really it is&#xD;
very hard on the poor fellow! Why couldn't&#xD;
his father have stayed at home, or else gone&#xD;
to Germany?"&#xD;
&#xD;

ARTIItTR'S ELAN OF DECEPTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am afraid we shall have another France-&#xD;
Prussian War when Captain Tyndale and your-&#xD;
self meet," sai~d Leslie. "Come, Norab,&#xD;
luncheon is ready-after that we will take&#xD;
our siesta; and, after that, you shall make&#xD;
yourself as lovely as possible for dinner."&#xD;
-4---&#xD;
CUAI'TER IX.&#xD;
"Said I not so?&#xD;
0 my prophetic heart!&#xD;
He has not betrayed me-he could not betray me.&#xD;
I never doubted it."&#xD;
WuEN that obstinate young man, Arthur&#xD;
Tyndale, reached Strafl'ord, after a ve~y warm&#xD;
and exceedingly disagreeable walk, he found&#xD;
his cousin established in the shady library,&#xD;
with a novel and a cigar. "Confound the&#xD;
fellow, how comfortable he looks 1', was the&#xD;
first thought of the over-heated pedestrian,&#xD;
as he enteredd this cool retreat-green shade&#xD;
rustling without the open windows, mellow&#xD;
depths of oak wainscot and book-lined walls&#xD;
within-and observed, with a sense of ex-&#xD;
asperation, the air of repose which pervaded&#xD;
every line of the figure extended at full length&#xD;
on a couch at the farther end of the room.&#xD;
"You are back rather soon," said Max,&#xD;
looking up lazily. "Didn't you find it very&#xD;
warm?"&#xD;
"Warm!" repeated Arthur, in a tone of&#xD;
impatience. He flung himself into a chair,&#xD;
and pushed back the rings of' damp hair that&#xD;
clung moistly to his brow. "Go out int6 the&#xD;
sun and try it a little, won't you? I think&#xD;
you'll be snore likely to call it infernally&#xD;
hot!"&#xD;
"I thought you would be apt to find it&#xD;
so," said Max, philosophically. "Order some&#xD;
iced sherbet, my dear fellow. It is the most&#xD;
refreshing thing you can--"&#xD;
"Deuce take refreshment!" interrupted&#xD;
the other, irritably. "I haven't time to think&#xD;
about iced sherbet just now. Max, you can't&#xD;
imagine what cursed ill-luck I have had this&#xD;
morning!"&#xD;
"Indeed!,' said Max. He raised himself&#xD;
on his elbow, with a quick look of interest in&#xD;
his dark eyes. "How was it?" he asked.&#xD;
"Does Miss Grahame khow or suspect any&#xD;
thing?"&#xD;
"Not the least thing, as yet; but there is&#xD;
no tellixig how soon she may know every&#xD;
thing. Norah opened the ball, last night,&#xD;
&#xD;
with a vengeance, by informing the assembled&#xD;
family that she had met me abroad."&#xD;
"The devil!"&#xD;
"Or, if not me-it seems she did not stand&#xD;
to that point-sonse one bearing the name of&#xD;
Tyndale."&#xD;
"Well, that's rather more vsgue.~~&#xD;
"So they have decided-Mrs. Middleton&#xD;
and Leslie-that it must have been you."&#xD;
"Mel "Mid Captain Tyndale. He opened&#xD;
his eyes still wider for a moment, ~sen burst&#xD;
into a laugh. "Pas-bteu, but that is a good&#xD;
joke! What did you tell them?"&#xD;
"I told Leslie, at first, that it was absurd;&#xD;
hut, when Mrs. Middleton spoke of it, I&#xD;
thought I would le&amp;amp;ve the matter for you to&#xD;
contradict. After all, I am not supposed to&#xD;
be aware of all the women Whom you may&#xD;
have met in your life."&#xD;
"That is very true; but still you know&#xD;
that I have never met Miss Desmond"&#xD;
"Yes, I know it; but there is no earthly&#xD;
reason why you should not have met her; and&#xD;
-and, if you had, it would make matters a&#xD;
good deal easier for me."&#xD;
"Granted, with all my heart; but the fact&#xD;
remains the same, that I have not had that&#xD;
pleasure."&#xD;
"But, hang It, Max! it would do no harm&#xD;
to let them think so-for a little time, you&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"Let them think so!" repeated Max.&#xD;
He shot a keen glance at lAis companion.&#xD;
"Do you mean that I should tell a downright&#xD;
lie?" he asked. "I don't know how else I&#xD;
could 'let them think so.' And it would not&#xD;
only be a lie, as far as I am concerned, but a&#xD;
most unwas-rantable liberty, as far as Miss&#xD;
Desmond is concerned."&#xD;
"I am not asking you to tell any thing&#xD;
at all," answered Arthur, impatiently. "Con-&#xD;
found it, you are amazingly straitlaced all at&#xD;
once! Can't you see that all I ask you to do&#xD;
is to let the thing pass, and not to deny that&#xD;
you were the man whom Miss Desmond met&#xD;
abroad?"&#xD;
"Bitt don't you see that, if I were inclined&#xD;
to oblige you a hundred times, it would do no&#xD;
good? Miss Desmond herself can certainly&#xD;
tell sokom she met abroad, and she is not like-&#xD;
ly to mistake my mahogany face for your red&#xD;
and white one?'&#xD;
"Of course, the whole thing hangs on her;&#xD;
but, if she allows it to be tacitly accepted&#xD;
that you were the man-and, somehow, I&#xD;

TIlE CAPTAIN'S OPINION.                   53&#xD;
&#xD;
A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
have an idea that she may-all I ask of you&#xD;
is, that you will take the advantage thus af-&#xD;
forded you to do me another and still greater&#xD;
favor."&#xD;
"So there's another, is there?" said Max.&#xD;
Tie rose as he spoke, and walked across the&#xD;
floor~ "See here, Hal," he said, stopping&#xD;
after a while, "this will not do! You know&#xD;
pei'.fectly well that, in any thing which is&#xD;
open and fair, I would serve you heartily;&#xD;
but I cannot consent to take either a passive&#xD;
or an active part in such a gross deception as&#xD;
that which you are practisiag on a woman&#xD;
w1io deserves better things at your hands I"&#xD;
"Am I asking you to take any part in it?"&#xD;
demanded Arthur, angrily, but conscious that&#xD;
he could not afford, just then to quarrel with&#xD;
Max. "This deception, as you call it, is a&#xD;
thing which I detest as much as you do; but&#xD;
it is also a thing in which I became entangled&#xD;
without my 'knowledge, and from which I&#xD;
must free myself as best I can. All that I&#xD;
ask from you is your assistance in doing this.&#xD;
If you refuse it, well and good: I can get&#xD;
along without you, no doubt. But don't make&#xD;
a pretext of refusing it on Leslie's account,&#xD;
for the best way to serve her would be to end&#xD;
all question of deception at once."&#xD;
"What is it you want me to do?" ask~d&#xD;
the other, reluctantly. "I don't promise that&#xD;
I will do it, mind you! but still there's no&#xD;
harm in hearing what it is!"&#xD;
"It is simply this: to find out from Norah&#xD;
what she menus to do-whether she intends&#xD;
to hold her tongue or to make mischief-and,&#xD;
if possible, to obtain my letters from her."&#xD;
"Great Heaven 1" said Max, aghast.&#xD;
"Are you mad? How on earth could I ap-&#xD;
proach a woman, of whom I know nothing,&#xD;
with such demands as those?"&#xD;
"Simply by understanding, in the first&#xD;
place, that any thing like chivalrous delicacy&#xD;
would be quite out of place with such a wom-&#xD;
an as Nor~h Desmond," said Arthur, with a&#xD;
bitter sneci'. "And, in the second place, by&#xD;
going about the business like a diplomatist,&#xD;
and not with point-blank 'demands."'&#xD;
"I have been bred in camps, and not in&#xD;
drawing-rooms," returned Max, dryly. "If&#xD;
you want diplomacy, I am afraid you must go&#xD;
elsewhere for it."&#xD;
"I only propose such a plan," -said the&#xD;
other, with fresh irritation, "because you&#xD;
are not fettered as I am-nobody will think&#xD;
it remarkable if you walk or talk with Norah&#xD;
&#xD;
-while I could ~nly see her by stealth if I&#xD;
saw her at all; for, besides the Middletons,&#xD;
who look on me with any thing but eyes of&#xD;
love, there's a young sprig of a nephew there&#xD;
who is head over ears in love with her, and&#xD;
already suspicious of me."&#xD;
"How have you managed to find that&#xD;
out?"&#xD;
"Easily enough-as you shall hear."&#xD;
Then he told the story of the scene in the&#xD;
summer-house-of his own discomfiture when&#xD;
he attempted to sound Miss Desmond, and of&#xD;
Carl's inopportune appearance just when he&#xD;
could not have failed to overhear that last&#xD;
significant appeaL It need not be imagined,&#xD;
however, that, in relating these occurrences,&#xD;
Mr. Tyndale was of necessity obliged to give&#xD;
them exactly the coloring of reality. He was&#xD;
too much a man of the world to represent&#xD;
himself in a contemptible or badly-worsted&#xD;
light; and, although he gave Max a sub-&#xD;
stantially correct outline of what had taken&#xD;
place, he was careful to say nothing of his&#xD;
own blunders or of Norah's scorn. On her&#xD;
passionate defiance, however, he dwelt em-&#xD;
phatically.&#xD;
"She absolutely went so far as to threaten&#xD;
rue with immediate exposure if I spoke to&#xD;
her again," he said. "So, you see, my only&#xD;
hope is in you."&#xD;
"And she gave you no hint as to what&#xD;
she meant ro do?"&#xD;
"Not the least. Now, you know this un-&#xD;
certainty-this soi~t of sword - of- Damocles&#xD;
business-is more than a man can be ex-&#xD;
pected to endure. As far as I personally am&#xD;
concerned, I should not mind it in the least.&#xD;
I should simply let Miss Desmond do or say&#xD;
her worst. I am not the first man who has&#xD;
flirted with a fast coquette. But there is&#xD;
Leslie. It would be hard on ker."&#xD;
"Yes," said Max. He turned on his heel&#xD;
and walked to the window as he spoke.&#xD;
Standing there, looking out over the green&#xD;
landscape and the bosky depths of summer&#xD;
shade, his mind went back to the May even-&#xD;
ing when he had loitered by Leslie's side&#xD;
among the roses, and when she had spoken&#xD;
with almost wistful sadness of her great hap-&#xD;
piness. He had seen then that this happi-&#xD;
ness, whether for good or ill, was irrevocably&#xD;
bound up in Arthur Tyndale, and, with this&#xD;
knowledge, had come the resolution that Ar-&#xD;
thur should "keep straight," if he had any&#xD;
power to make him do so. ' It was too late to&#xD;
&#xD;
think of his worthiness or unworthiness for&#xD;
the great gift that had fallen into his life.-&#xD;
too late to ask whether that loyal and tender&#xD;
heart might not have been better bestowed-&#xD;
what was done was done with such distinct&#xD;
completeness that Max plainly perceived that&#xD;
any event which proved his cousin unworthy&#xD;
would stab Leslie's life all the more deeply&#xD;
for Leslie's pride. Feeling this by an in-&#xD;
stinct which is not often given to men, and&#xD;
feeling, also, with the sort of despair common&#xD;
to us all, that she must take things (and peo-&#xD;
pie) as they are, witho~it hoping or expect-&#xD;
ing to make them what they should be, he&#xD;
recognized that his best way of serving Leslie&#xD;
was to help Arthur as far as possible out of&#xD;
Miss Desmond's net. 'Of Miss Desmond her-&#xD;
self, it may be said, in passing, that he had&#xD;
the lowest possible opinion. A woman who&#xD;
was a celebrity at Baden and Homburg, who&#xD;
had an adventurer for a father, and who was&#xD;
plainly determined to make Arthur pay a&#xD;
heavy price for freedom from entanglement,&#xD;
offended every one of his most cherished&#xD;
ideas and opinions. If he had consulted his&#xD;
own taste, he would have preferred to have&#xD;
nothing to do with her; but, since that was&#xD;
impossible, he made up his mind to further&#xD;
his cousin's cause with as much earnest ef-&#xD;
fort as he could exert.&#xD;
So it came to pass that Arthur-still lean-&#xD;
ing back in the depths of his chair, and con-&#xD;
templating a bust of Dante with a frown of&#xD;
petulant discontent and ill-humor-was rath-&#xD;
er surprised when the tall figure at the win-&#xD;
dow turned with its quick, military swing,&#xD;
and Max's voice said:&#xD;
"Don't think me churlish for having taken&#xD;
some time to consider matters, Hal. I doubt&#xD;
if I shall be a very valuable auxiliary, but,&#xD;
nevertheless, I'll do my best for you as far as&#xD;
I can!"&#xD;
"I was sure you'd never leave me to get&#xD;
out of the scrape by myself, old fellow," an-&#xD;
swered Arthur, gratefully. And in those few&#xD;
words the compact was made and the matter&#xD;
ended.&#xD;
Six or seven hours later-the heat of the&#xD;
day being over, and the long, cool shadows&#xD;
of late evening lying over green turf and&#xD;
dusty, sun-baked road-the two cousins drove&#xD;
up to the door of Rosland in Mr. Tyndale's&#xD;
dog-cart. The disk of the sun was just touch-&#xD;
ing the horizon when they entered the' draw-&#xD;
ing room, and his level rays were pouring&#xD;
&#xD;
through the western windows in a stream of&#xD;
light which made so dazzling an illumination&#xD;
that, for a few seconds, the young men were&#xD;
absolutely unable to tell who was before&#xD;
them. The transcendent glory was short.&#xD;
lived, however. Even while they hesitated,&#xD;
the great orb sank, and they saw that three&#xD;
ladies and two gentlemen made up the group&#xD;
gathered in the centre of the large apartment.&#xD;
Greetings having been exchanged, and Cap-&#xD;
tain Tyndale having been presented to Miss&#xD;
Desmond, such commonplaces as people in&#xD;
the country usually talk, ensued.&#xD;
"Found it very dusty, didn't you?" said&#xD;
Mr. Middleton to Arthur., "I never knew&#xD;
rain needed Worse than it is just now."&#xD;
~ Every thing is so dreadfully parched ~&#xD;
said Mrs. Middleton, in a confiding aside to&#xD;
Max. "It really makes one sad to go into&#xD;
the garden. Don't you feel as sorry for flow-&#xD;
ers, when they droop, as for people, when&#xD;
they are sick? I always do."&#xD;
"The Andersons, who were here this&#xD;
morning, report the drought still worse with&#xD;
them," said Leslie. "They say their garden&#xD;
is literally burned up. By-the-by, Arthur,&#xD;
Lizzie Anderson is to marry Frank Tabor,&#xD;
after all. Are you not surprised to hear it?&#xD;
She rejected him half a dozen' times, people&#xD;
said. Fancy accepting a man; at last, whom&#xD;
you had rejected half a dozen times!"&#xD;
"There is always luck in odd numbers,&#xD;
you know," said Tyndale, with a smile of&#xD;
'tolerably well simulated interest, "and seven&#xD;
is an odd number, if my arithmetic serves&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"There is encouragement for me I" said&#xD;
Carl, in a discreet aside to Norah. "If Frank&#xD;
Tabor-whom I remember as a black-eyed&#xD;
young rascal at school-persevered after six&#xD;
rejections, I certainly should not despair,&#xD;
after one! But imagine, if you can, the&#xD;
moral pluck, or the mental despair, of a man&#xD;
who could screw his courage to the sticking-&#xD;
point of a seventh proposal!"&#xD;
* "It proves that he was exceedingly fool-&#xD;
ish, as well as rather obstinate," said Norab&#xD;
-and, as a lull had just then fallen in the&#xD;
general conversation, her words were audible&#xD;
to all the group. "No woman in the world is&#xD;
worth half so much trouble! I never see a&#xD;
man desperately bent upon such a chase that&#xD;
I.do not feel inclined to remind him of the&#xD;
fact that there is any number of other wom-&#xD;
en in the world, multitudes of whom are pret-&#xD;

tier, and cleverer, and more desirable in every&#xD;
way, than the one of whom he is so madly&#xD;
"But what are other women to a man who&#xD;

don't exactly admire. the trait: and I have&#xD;
ltixown many women, and some men, who&#xD;

should we emit constancy intQ such a virtue?&#xD;
It certainly is not according to the law of Na-&#xD;

body is the same at twenty-live and forty-.-&#xD;
neither is any man's character. Therefore,&#xD;
why should we expect his heart alone to he&#xD;
unchanged?"&#xD;
"I had no idea that y~n were such a here-&#xD;
tic I" said Leslie, laughing but she felt, in&#xD;
the silence SrQW1d, that the careless, ~lellant&#xD;
words had shocked most of the audience~&#xD;
"You. forget one thing," she, added, after a&#xD;
moment; "if constancy is not according to&#xD;
the law of Na.turc~-wbkh I freely grant-At&#xD;
is because it is o~ovc Nature,. as many other&#xD;
virtues are. I ant sure you will not deny&#xD;

"It would require a person more fond of&#xD;

and to be obliging, I would surrender the&#xD;

But, since dinner was anneuneed just then,&#xD;
&#xD;
his apology was brought to an end, together&#xD;
.with the young philosopher's somewhat cyni-&#xD;
cal satire. As they left the drawing-room,,&#xD;
Captain Tyndale thought that Miss Desmond&#xD;
was quite as disagreeable as he had expected&#xD;
to find her. In fact, during these few mimi-&#xD;
utes, she had shown her character in even a&#xD;
worse light than he had anticipated. Her&#xD;
tone of mingled levity and skeptivism.-with&#xD;
a certain bright, bard cleverness showing&#xD;
through-jarred on and disgusted hIm more&#xD;
than the most free and easy "fastness" c~uld&#xD;
have done. "Arthur is right; she is a Belie.&#xD;
mian adventuress," be thought, "more out-&#xD;
spoken than the most of her class, but with&#xD;
nothing of a true woman in her." Like a&#xD;
great many other people, Captain Tyndalc for-&#xD;
got to ask himself by what authentic standard&#xD;
he had measured his ideal "true woman;" or&#xD;
whether, after all, his abstract idea of what&#xD;
the sex should be~ in general, was quite a fair&#xD;
rule for judging Miss Desmond in particular.&#xD;
He could not but acknowledge, however,&#xD;
that her beauty was something extraordinary,&#xD;
as, he sat opposite her at dinner, and studied&#xD;
the perfect face, line by line, and feature by&#xD;
feature. Even with her beauty, however, he&#xD;
found fault. It was too brilliant for his taste.&#xD;
He agreed with Mrs. Middleton that a thor-&#xD;
ough-bred woman should never make a "sen-&#xD;
sation;" and it was undeniable that Norah&#xD;
Desniond could riot have walked through the&#xD;
quietest village in. Christendom without draw-&#xD;
ing eager glances of admiration to herself.&#xD;
Looking from her to Leslie, be thought how&#xD;
much more of attraction there was in the&#xD;
delicate face of the latter, with its silken soft&#xD;
brown hair, and&#xD;
loveliness which rather lay&#xD;
In light than color;"&#xD;
and it chanced that, while he was so thinking,&#xD;
Leslie turned and spoke to him.&#xD;
"I have been telling Norab, Captain Tytr~&#xD;
dale, that I am sure she must have known&#xD;
you abroad. She thinks that she remembers&#xD;
having met some one named Tyndale at Ba-&#xD;
den or Homburg; and, since it, was not Ar-&#xD;
tkur~ I think it must have been yourself.&#xD;
Tell me, am I not right? Have you not seen&#xD;
her before?"&#xD;
"What a horribly direct question I" Ar-&#xD;
thur tho~e~ht, consoleus that. his complexion&#xD;
was changing color just, then in its meet try-&#xD;
ing wanner. "1 will never venture to&#xD;
&#xD;
answer it in the affirmative. Why on earth&#xD;
should Leslie bring up the subject just now I&#xD;
Confound all women and their toagnes, I&#xD;
say I"&#xD;
But Max, meanwhile-with no change of&#xD;
color on his weather-beaten visage-had cool.&#xD;
ly lifted his eyes and met Miss Desmond's&#xD;
glance. There was a defiance in it which he&#xD;
was sufficiently quick to read artght. "Take&#xD;
your cousin's identity upon yourself, i1 you&#xD;
dare !"it said to him; and he smiled a little&#xD;
as he answered:&#xD;
"It is probable enough that Miss Des.'&#xD;
mend does not remember me; but I have&#xD;
certainly had the pleasure of seeing her be-&#xD;
fore."&#xD;
It amused him a little, as he uttered these&#xD;
words, to observe that, instead of any thing&#xD;
like surprise, an expression of scarcely-veiled&#xD;
contempt came over Norab's face. "You&#xD;
have spoken falsely!" her eyes said to him,&#xD;
but her lips onhy parted in the smile of scorn&#xD;
peculiar to them.&#xD;
"Captain Tyndale's memory is so much&#xD;
better than my own that I do not like to run&#xD;
the risk of telling him that he is mistaken,"&#xD;
she said, very coldly; and Arthur gave a sigh&#xD;
of relief as he saw that she did not mean to&#xD;
make a "scene." "But I suppose that I may&#xD;
at least iie per~nitted to say that I have not&#xD;
the faintest recollection of himself or his&#xD;
face."&#xD;
"My face is not an uncommon one," said&#xD;
Max, carelessly. "It has its disadvantages,&#xD;
especially in the fact of looking like a mill-&#xD;
ion or two other faces; but, then, it has its&#xD;
advantages, also, some of which are very sol-&#xD;
id ones. If I wanted to escape from a detec-&#xD;
tive or a woman,, for instance, how much bet-&#xD;
ter my chance would be than Arthur's here!"&#xD;
"Yes, if Norali had seen Arthur, she cer-&#xD;
tainly could not have forgotten him," said&#xD;
Leslie, innocently.&#xD;
"You are mistaken about one thing, how-&#xD;
ever," said Norab, looking at Max. "A wom-&#xD;
an's eyes, when sharpened by love or hate,&#xD;
pierce through alL disguises; and, although&#xD;
your face is in general like a good many other&#xD;
ihees, especially fains in France, it has a&#xD;
great deal of individuality besides."&#xD;
"Thanks," said he, quietly. "I am glad&#xD;
to hear that it has individuality, even though&#xD;
it lessens somewhat my problematical chance&#xD;
of escape if I should ever kill a man or be-&#xD;
tray a woman."&#xD;
&#xD;
"If you intend to do one or the other,"&#xD;
said ~he~"take my advice, and kill a man. It&#xD;
is the safer experiment of the two."&#xD;
The dilating glow of her ey~s, as she ut-&#xD;
tered the last words, was eert~rinly superb;&#xD;
but it was also full of unpleasant significance&#xD;
to one person at least. Arthur Tyndale in.&#xD;
voluntarily lifted his glass of wine to his lips&#xD;
and drained it. He felt that he stood in need&#xD;
of support, and this was the most convenient&#xD;
form in which it presented itself to him.&#xD;
"What does she mean to do?" he thought.&#xD;
The devil seems to possess her! I hare&#xD;
half a mind to make a clean breast of it all to&#xD;
Leslie, and so block her game." But that&#xD;
such a resolution nas utterly impracticable,&#xD;
Mr. Tyndale wus thoroughly conscious, even&#xD;
while he gave mental utterance to it He&#xD;
was at Miss Desmond~s mercy. He felt that&#xD;
fact to the bottom of his boots-felt it with a&#xD;
responding sense that even the mellow glow&#xD;
of the wine he had so liberally quaffed could&#xD;
not dispel.&#xD;
Just then, to his great relief, Carl Middle.&#xD;
ton changed the dangerous course of conver-&#xD;
sation. Instinct warned him to do this im.&#xD;
mediately after Norali's last speech, and he&#xD;
plunged at once into the first convenient~ sub-&#xD;
I jeet, which chanced to be the existing state&#xD;
of government in Franca&#xD;
"By-the-way, what do you think of M.&#xD;
Thiers?" he asked Max, with a degree of&#xD;
relevance that was rather startling. "How&#xD;
long do you think he will be able to hold his&#xD;
own over there in Paris?"&#xD;
"Probably till the Prussians are safely&#xD;
oil' the soil 6f France," answered the other,&#xD;
who rarely betrayed surprise, however much&#xD;
he might feel it.&#xD;
"And who do you think will be most&#xD;
likely to succeed him-to profit by the pres-&#xD;
sent state of affairs, you know?" proceeded&#xD;
Carl, in a aispassionate tone of inquiry.&#xD;
Max shrugged his shoulders with a rath-&#xD;
er amused expretsionof face. "How can I&#xD;
tell?" he said. "I am no prophet. Per-&#xD;
haps there are no better words in which to&#xD;
answer you than those which have lately fall-&#xD;
en from royal lips 'La parole est7el in France&#xD;
"I remember that sentence," said Carl.&#xD;
"I was struck by its epigrammatic force when&#xD;
I saw it first. Poetically it does very well&#xD;
indeed."&#xD;
"Young Germany, you see, quite excludes&#xD;
&#xD;

56                       A DAUGHTER&#xD;
the idea of God (save in poetry) from the af-&#xD;
fairs of nations," said Leslie.&#xD;
"Mr. Middleton is one of the people who&#xD;
only believe in the existence of their own&#xD;
senses," said Norah; "and1 since metaphys-&#xD;
ics have proved conclusively to him that he&#xD;
has no senses, he is in rather a bad condition&#xD;
-that is, theoretically. Practically, he sup.&#xD;
jorts the inconvenience of being a blank ne-&#xD;
gation verjv well indeed."&#xD;
"He certainly does not look at all like&#xD;
one," said'Mr. Middleton, senior, dryly.&#xD;
In this manner, although Carl's zeal drew&#xD;
the conversation upon himself, it accom-&#xD;
plished what he desired in the way of effect-&#xD;
ing a diversion. Ranging here and there-&#xD;
through fields political; literary, and social-&#xD;
the stream of talk did not again approach the&#xD;
dangerous question of what Tyndale Miss Des-&#xD;
mond had known abroad.&#xD;
Only when the ladies were alone in the&#xD;
drawing-room did Leslie recur to the sub-&#xD;
ject.&#xD;
"You see I was right, Norah I" she said,&#xD;
triumphantly. "It was Captain Tyndale, af-&#xD;
t~r all, whom you knew abroad."&#xD;
"You are so often right that I should not&#xD;
think it would be a very novel sensation to&#xD;
you," said Miss Desmond, smiling. "Now, as&#xD;
for me, I am so often wrong, that I really feel&#xD;
scarcely inclined to trust my own judgment&#xD;
on any point whatever. Perhaps I ought to&#xD;
add my memory also, for Icertainly have not&#xD;
the faintest recollection of Captain Tyndale's&#xD;
face. Yet I don't think it is as much like&#xD;
every other man's as he fancies. If you had&#xD;
not told me that he belonged t~o the French&#xD;
army, I should have known it. There is some-&#xD;
thing strikingly suggestive of the Chasseur&#xD;
d'Afrique in his appearance."&#xD;
"I hope you mean to like him. He is&#xD;
worth liking, we think."&#xD;
"Do you!' But why not say 'Ithink?'&#xD;
Surely you do not think, as the army of Flan-&#xD;
ders reasoned, in platoons?"&#xD;
"Not by any means. But the opinion of&#xD;
many is worth more than the opinion of one,&#xD;
is it not P&#xD;
"That depends so much upon who are the&#xD;
many and who is the one, that I don't feel&#xD;
equal to giving a general opinion."&#xD;
"You are a perfect Talleyrand in petti-&#xD;
coats," said Leslie, laughing. "One would&#xD;
certainly imagine that you believed words to&#xD;
have been invented for tl~ purpose ~f con-&#xD;
&#xD;
OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
ceiling thoughts. But you must learn to like&#xD;
Captain Tyndale. He is a special favorite of&#xD;
mine.~~&#xD;
"And an old acquaintaicc of mine-pray&#xD;
don't forget that."&#xD;
There was such a gleam of mockery in her&#xD;
eyes as she uttered the last words, that Les-&#xD;
lie said, quickly:&#xD;
"I believe that you half suspect Captain&#xD;
Tyndale of having claimed your acquaintance&#xD;
without any right to do so. Now, if you&#xD;
knew him at all, you would know that he is&#xD;
incapable of taking such a liberty-a liberty&#xD;
which would be a gross presumption 1" she&#xD;
added, indignantly.&#xD;
"You are right," said Norah, quietly.&#xD;
"It would certainly be 'a gross presump-&#xD;
tion.' "&#xD;
"Not by men like Max Tyndale, I am&#xD;
sure."&#xD;
"Hm-I am not sure. Are you acquainted&#xD;
with any man irho carries his character on&#xD;
his face for women to read? Not that I se-&#xD;
riously impugn the veracity of your mirror&#xD;
of truth and honesty. It is a law of logic&#xD;
that a crime presupposes a motive for the&#xD;
crime, is it not? Well, I am not an impor-&#xD;
tant person, nor a particularly agreeable per-&#xD;
son; therefore, it stands to reason that Cap.&#xD;
tam Tyndale could have had no interested&#xD;
motive in claiming my acquaintance."&#xD;
"Yet I thought you allowed the claim&#xD;
very coldly."&#xD;
"Did I? Set the fact down, then, to sur-&#xD;
prise. I had not an idea that the man wQuld&#xD;
venture to say 'Yes' to your question."&#xD;
"Was there any reason why he should not&#xD;
have ventured to say it if he had really known&#xD;
you?" asked Leslie, looking keenly into the&#xD;
beautiful, unruffled face.&#xD;
"None at all," answered Miss Desmond,&#xD;
indifferently.&#xD;
They had been standing by an open win-&#xD;
dow while they talked-one, of those which&#xD;
overlooked the veranda-and, as she uttered&#xD;
those last words, Norah stepped through and&#xD;
stood for a minute outside.&#xD;
"I think I shall go in search of our Mario&#xD;
of last night," she said, half turning to Les-&#xD;
lie. "Don't come !-Mr. Tyndale will be in&#xD;
before long, and you look so lovely where&#xD;
you are I You may send the cousin - the&#xD;
old acquaintance of mine-after me, if you&#xD;
choose. Of course, we shall naturally have&#xD;
a great deal to say to each other."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
"The weakest woman is pitiless to weakness in&#xD;
a man, and the gentlest of a gentle sex has no miti-&#xD;
gation of scorn for the man that has betrayed the&#xD;
gentlest quality of her nature-implicit trust.&#xD;
"There is no pardon for desecrated ideals."&#xD;
THE soft summer twilight was exquisitely&#xD;
mingled with the faint lustre of a new moon&#xD;
-a pretty, baby crescent hanging in the still,&#xD;
tinted sky-when Norah strolled across the&#xD;
lawn toward the rose-hedge, where the mock-&#xD;
ing-bird had piped so sweet a lay the evening&#xD;
before. But mocking-birds can be fickle as&#xD;
well as men. From the leafy depths came no&#xD;
delicious trill or full-throated note to-night.&#xD;
Save for a few irrepressible katydids, all was&#xD;
stillness and silence in this part of the&#xD;
ground's. The fresh fragrance of grass and&#xD;
flowers, the great oaks, with their brown&#xD;
trunks and mighty depths of shade, the state-&#xD;
ly magnolias, and tropical shrubs, all seemed&#xD;
full of that supreme magic of repose which&#xD;
dwells in midsummer gloaming. Athwart the&#xD;
grass, and against the hedges, fire-flies were&#xD;
beginning to gleam in* their fitful way; but&#xD;
other sign of life there was none. Perhaps&#xD;
the dewy freshness, the perfect quiet, the&#xD;
shadowy loveliness of the scene, served Miss&#xD;
Desmond's purpose as well as the mocking-&#xD;
bird could have done. At all events, she did&#xD;
not retrace her steps toward the house; but,&#xD;
finding a convenient garden-chair, she sat&#xD;
down, looking like a fair dream-lady, outlined&#xD;
by the dark shrubbery behind.&#xD;
In this place and attitude Max Tyndale&#xD;
found her when he crossed the lawn and en-&#xD;
tered the shrubbery ten minutes later, having&#xD;
been sent by Miss Grahame in search of the&#xD;
wanderer, somewhat to his own discomfiture,&#xD;
and greatly to Carl's disgust. "flow well&#xD;
s~ie has arranged herself for effect I" was his&#xD;
first thought. "What an actress she is!"&#xD;
T~ien, pausing, he lifted his hat.&#xD;
"I have the honor to obey your summons,&#xD;
Miss Desmond," he said, coldly.&#xD;
"You arc very kind," answered Miss Des.&#xD;
mond, more coldly still. She did not rise,&#xD;
but only looked at him, with a certain proud&#xD;
steadfastness, as he stood before her, erect&#xD;
and tall, in the soft dusk. "You are ver;&#xD;
kind," she repeated, after a second's pausd~;&#xD;
"but I am sure you are aware that I should&#xD;
not have troubled you with any 'summons'&#xD;
if I had not desired to learn what end your&#xD;

&#xD;
EXPLANATION.                       57&#xD;
cousin or yourself hope to serve by the ac-&#xD;
quaintance which you did me the honor to&#xD;
claim at dinner?"&#xD;
The challenge came more quickly and&#xD;
more peremptorily than he had expected.&#xD;
Despite his large fund of imperturbable cool-&#xD;
ness, Max felt the blood rushing warmly to&#xD;
his face. After all, it wa.s an awkward posi-&#xD;
tion; and, Bohemian though she might be,&#xD;
the girl looked just then like an archduchess.&#xD;
Somewhat to his own surprise, he found him-&#xD;
self a little confused in his reply.&#xD;
"If you will allow me to explain," he said,&#xD;
"I do not think that you will find that Ar-&#xD;
that any one beside m-yself is accountable for&#xD;
the act of presumption of which I acknowl-&#xD;
edge that I was guilty at dinner."&#xD;
"I have found that men are rarely guilty,&#xD;
even of an act of presumption, without some&#xD;
motive for it," said she, haughtily. "Yours&#xD;
is not difficult to find. Your cousin was in an&#xD;
awkward position, and you were kind enough&#xD;
to rescue him at the slight expense of truth.&#xD;
I am not so dull but that I can read clearly&#xD;
enough that far. What puzzles me is to im-&#xD;
agine what good end he proposes to serve by&#xD;
such a stratagem. Does he think that, if I&#xD;
choose to open my lips, he will be likely to&#xD;
gain any thing by the desperate policy of de.&#xD;
nying that he ever knew me? If so, he must&#xD;
be prepared to deny also the evidence of his&#xD;
own letters. Or perhaps you, sir, will affirm&#xD;
that you were also the Tyndale who wrote&#xD;
those?"&#xD;
"I shall certainly not affirm any thing&#xD;
which is untrue, mademoiselle," answered&#xD;
Max. "And you must pardon me if I repeat&#xD;
that you are entirely wrong in supposing that&#xD;
I claimed your acquaintance falsely, in order&#xD;
to serve any interest that 'my cousin may&#xD;
have."&#xD;
"With or without an interest, the fact re-&#xD;
mains that you spoke falsely!" said she, im-&#xD;
periously. "You cannot deny it."&#xD;
"Pardon me again; but I must have ex-&#xD;
pressed myself very badly, or you must have&#xD;
understood me very ill, if you have not yet&#xD;
comprehended that I do deny it most omphat-&#xD;
ically."&#xD;
"You deny it--to mc!" Great as was&#xD;
her natural fluency and command of language,&#xD;
her power of expression seemed for a moment&#xD;
to go no further than that. "You are play-&#xD;
ing a bolder game than I thought, monsieur,"&#xD;
she said, then, contemptuously. "You will&#xD;

&#xD;
tell me, next, that we arc indeed old acquaint-&#xD;
ances - that I have danced with you at&#xD;
Baden, and flirted at Homburg.. Grdce d&#xD;
.Dieu I I should have remembered that de-&#xD;
nial is, after all, only a matter of words; and&#xD;
how little words count with any of your sex,&#xD;
I learned long ago."&#xD;
"Mademoiselle," said Max, who began to&#xD;
feel as if it were within the range of possible&#xD;
events that he might lose his temper, "I re-&#xD;
peat, again, that you are charging me with&#xD;
falseliood iu the most causeless and unpro.&#xD;
yoked manner. I have no connection what.&#xD;
ever with my cousin's affairs; and, in saying&#xD;
at dinner that I had seen you abroad, I said&#xD;
nothing more than was strictly true."&#xD;
"In that case," said she, throwing back&#xD;
her head with an air of defiance, "you can&#xD;
certainly tell when and where you met me,&#xD;
and how it is that such a fact should have es.&#xD;
eaped my memory altogethei-."&#xD;
"It is not remarkable that your memory&#xD;
should not bear testimony to a fact which&#xD;
never had a place in it," he said, coolly. "If&#xD;
you will dome the justice to remember, I did&#xD;
not. venture to say at dinner that I had Arnown&#xD;
you abroad, but simply that I had ~reerz you.&#xD;
This was perfectly true. I saw you, two years&#xD;
ago, at the opera, in Paris."&#xD;
Even through the twilight - momently&#xD;
growing deeper-he caught the scornful and&#xD;
incredulous curl of her lip..&#xD;
"I congratulate you on your inventive&#xD;
powers, monsieur," she said. "Such a very&#xD;
definite place and date certainly put your as-&#xD;
sertion beyond all dispute."&#xD;
"You may believe me or not, as you&#xD;
choose," answered he, beginning to grew a&#xD;
little haughty in turn; "but I speak on my&#xD;
honor as a gentleman when I say that £ re-&#xD;
membered your face the moment I saw it in&#xD;
the drawing-room before dinner. Up te that&#xD;
time, I had not entertained the faintest idea&#xD;
that I had er-cr seen you; but the instant the&#xD;
sun sank-you remember how it dar.ziedour&#xD;
eyes ?-.-I said to myself 'Here is the face I&#xD;
~aw at the opera, in Ptris, two years ago 1"'&#xD;
"What lucky coincidences there are in&#xD;
this world!" said she, dryly. "How foittu.'&#xD;
nate that, you should, have made this discov-&#xD;
ery just when it would benefit your cousin s~&#xD;
much I"&#xD;
"I see that you doubt me still," lie said.&#xD;
4~As far as I am. concerned, that Is net a.&#xD;
matter Qf any importance; lint,, for .&amp;amp;rthu~"s&#xD;
&#xD;
sake, I should like you to believe that I am&#xD;
speaking the truth. It is not likely that you&#xD;
remember one special night in June two&#xD;
years ago; hut I do-partly because of other&#xD;
events, partly because one does not often see&#xD;
such a face as yours. I remember the pee-&#xD;
plc who were with you, and, if necessary, I&#xD;
could tell even' the color of the dresa you&#xD;
wore."&#xD;
She looked at him quickly and keenly;&#xD;
baffled, however~ by the growing obscurity&#xD;
which veiled his face as it veiled the trees&#xD;
and shrubs aud distant uplands.&#xD;
"If this is true," she said, at last, "Ibeg&#xD;
your pardon. instead of accusing you of&#xD;
falsehood, it seems that £ should only have&#xD;
accused you of equivocation, which is as&#xD;
bad l"&#xD;
"To that charge I must plead guilty,"&#xD;
answered he. "But two things teml)ted me:&#xD;
one was to assist Arthur; the other (if yan&#xD;
will pardon me), to mystify you."&#xD;
"Mystify me, you did not," said she, cold-&#xD;
ly. "-You only made me believe that you&#xD;
were assisting your cousin at the expense of&#xD;
your own honor~-ifindeeda man ever counts&#xD;
his honor forfeited by a lie.?'&#xD;
"I am afraid your experience among men&#xD;
bus been very unfortunate."&#xD;
"It has been very extensive, at least."&#xD;
"There are many classes of men, how.&#xD;
ever."&#xD;
"I have known many of all classes-your&#xD;
cousin among the rest."'&#xD;
"Will you glyc me leave to inquire," said&#xD;
he, abruptly, "how it is that you take it so&#xD;
entirely for granted that I am aware of Ar-&#xD;
thur's connection with yourself?"&#xD;
She laughed slightly-the faint cadence,&#xD;
though with little of mirth in it, ringing out&#xD;
sweetly etiougir on the still, evening air.&#xD;
"I learned to read faces early," she an.&#xD;
twered. "It cost me no effort to road in&#xD;
your face, the m~men11 your eyes fell on me:&#xD;
'So this is theBohemian girl over whom Ar-&#xD;
thur once made &amp;amp;fool of himself l'"&#xD;
"I must endeavor to keep ray face in bet-&#xD;
ter order," said he, smiling a little.' "You&#xD;
are right, however.. I have heard Arthur's&#xD;
story, and,, without seeking to excuse his&#xD;
fault, I should like to ask whether the woin~&#xD;
an whom he once loved can find no leniency&#xD;
for him in her heart?"&#xD;
"Has ho requcated you~ to ask such a&#xD;
question?" demanded she. "If se, you may&#xD;
&#xD;
tell him that, in a woman's eyes-I speak of&#xD;
women who are not spaniels-nothing can ex-&#xD;
cuse falsity and cowardice."&#xD;
"You speak strongly, mademoiselle."&#xD;
"I might speak more strongly if I added&#xD;
s1~rnder to falsity and cowardice."&#xD;
"In doing so I am sure that you would&#xD;
wng him deeply."&#xD;
"Are you? Be good enough to tell me,&#xD;
en, in what manner and what character he&#xD;
Ii a spoken of me to you."&#xD;
"As a woman to whom he was once deep.&#xD;
ly attached," answered Max, thankful for this&#xD;
lo p-hole of evasion, and full of devout hope&#xD;
t at she might not press her ~wkws.rd ques.&#xD;
ti n any further. But, in indulging 'such a&#xD;
h pe, he certainly di~l not know any thing of&#xD;
N rah Desmond..&#xD;
"Y6u spoke a moment ago of your honor&#xD;
as a gentleman," said she. "If you realty&#xD;
possess any thing so foreign to my experi~&#xD;
e~cc of the Tyndale name, I beg that you will&#xD;
te~l me whether or not your cousin has spoken&#xD;
of' me as a woman worthy of faith and re-&#xD;
spect, or as a fast flirt, with whom men only&#xD;
Desmond, is it fair-..."&#xD;
make you testify against the man&#xD;
yqu call your friend?" interrupted she. "Per.&#xD;
h4pa not. I will spare you an answer, there..&#xD;
fore, especially since your hesitation auth-&#xD;
ciently answers me. And yet, you wonder&#xD;
that I have no inclination to spare such a&#xD;
man!" she added, with a ring of vibrating&#xD;
contempt in her voice. "You wonder that I&#xD;
-the woman he once professed to love, the&#xD;
woman to whom he was solemnly engaged,&#xD;
the woman whom he not only deserted and&#xD;
betrayed, but whom he has slandered and&#xD;
d~famed-should think him a coward and a&#xD;
dt~stard!"&#xD;
"Still, if you could apprecinte his anxiety&#xD;
-4f you could know how much he desires&#xD;
some assurance of what you mean to do-.-."&#xD;
"That assurance he will not obtain, either&#xD;
in his own person or through his agents,"&#xD;
said she, decidedly. "Let him understand&#xD;
this once for all."&#xD;
"lie has empowered me to say for him&#xD;
that he is willing to make any concession,&#xD;
any arrangement-"&#xD;
"Spare your diplomacy, Captain Tyadale,"&#xD;
sh~ interrupted, more coldly and haughtily&#xD;
than ever. "What. possible concession does&#xD;
Arthur Tyndale imagine' that I require at his I&#xD;
&#xD;
hands? In my own time, I will name my&#xD;
own terms, and, whatever they are, you may&#xD;
be sure that be will accede to them."&#xD;
The tone of confident power which filled&#xD;
the last words, and the glance which accom-&#xD;
panied them, told Max, more plainly than&#xD;
many assurances could have done, the hope.&#xD;
lessness of his mission.&#xD;
"I see, indeed, that I waste time and ef-&#xD;
fort," said he. ~A But I had hoped that, for&#xD;
your sister's sake, at least-"&#xD;
"For my sister's sake I should certainly&#xD;
he inclined to sacrifice a great deal," said&#xD;
she, quietly, as he paused. "We have known&#xD;
each other' so long and so well, have been&#xD;
so closely associated together and grown&#xD;
in sisterly affection as we grew in years,&#xD;
that you are right to calculate upon such a&#xD;
bond.. Your cousin, too, may safely shelter&#xD;
himself behind it.."&#xD;
Now, it must not be supposed that there&#xD;
was any vulgar banter in this speech. Save&#xD;
for the faintest possible accent of mockery-&#xD;
an accent so natural to her that her voice&#xD;
was scarcely ever free from it-Max might&#xD;
have supposed that she was speaking in per-&#xD;
fect seriousness and good faith. As it wa~,&#xD;
he felt a little puzzled how to answer her,&#xD;
and his thoughts left Arthur and Leslie for a&#xD;
moment to consider how thoroughly disa-&#xD;
greeable this woman was. lie made a men-&#xD;
tat comparison of her changing moods, her&#xD;
passion, her mockery, her cynicism, with&#xD;
Miss Grahame's graceful and gracious sweet-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
"0ood Heavens, to think that such wom-&#xD;
en should he even l~alf-sisters 1" he thought.&#xD;
Just then he felt more inclined to excuse&#xD;
Arthur than he had even felt before.&#xD;
Miss Desmond, with a quickness of per-&#xD;
ception which often startled people into a&#xD;
belief that she had some dealing with the&#xD;

"You feel more inclined to pity than to&#xD;

she said. "You think that such a woman as&#xD;
I am is hardly worth keeping faithwith, after&#xD;

&#xD;
kind. On the contrary, I think there is no&#xD;
justification whatever for Arthur's conduct."&#xD;
"And yet you make yourself his agent&#xD;
and advocate!"&#xD;
"Not exactly the first, nor at all the last,"&#xD;
answered he "It is simply as his friend&#xD;
that I have endeavored - though very un-&#xD;
availingly-to serve his cause."&#xD;
"It is a poor cause, and scarcely worth&#xD;
being served," said she. "As for your fail-&#xD;
ure, it would be strange if you had not failed.&#xD;
Your cousin has every thing to fear from me,&#xD;
while I have absolutely nothing to fear from&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"I begin to appreciate that," said Max,&#xD;
a little grimly.&#xD;
"I have nothing to gain from him, and&#xD;
nothing to lose by him," she repeated, after&#xD;
a minute. "Therefore he-who professes to&#xD;
know the world so well-can judge whether&#xD;
or not he is wise in appealing tome."&#xD;
"But it is impossible that you can refuse&#xD;
absolutely to give him a clew to your inten-&#xD;
tions in a matter that concerns him so vital.&#xD;
ly I "said Max, beginning to perceive that this&#xD;
woman was indeed a very cool and subtle&#xD;
adversary.&#xD;
"I refuse absolutely," she answered.&#xD;
"It seems that I must repeat this very often.&#xD;
Are you so accustomed to finding women like&#xD;
wax in your hands, that you cannot under-&#xD;
stand a woman's resolution when you meet&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"I beg your pardon," replied he, hastily.&#xD;
"I should not have forced you to repeat what&#xD;
you have already said."&#xD;
"And now I believe that we have finished&#xD;
all that we have to say," she went on, rising&#xD;
and gathering up her light dress from the&#xD;
dewy grass. "In going back to the drawing-&#xD;
room, you must not forget that you have the&#xD;
part of an 'old acquaintance' to play. It is&#xD;
one of the disadvantages of equivocation that&#xD;
it generally places you in a false position even&#xD;
when you have adhered to the rigid letter of&#xD;
the truth."&#xD;
But the3f found, when they emerged from&#xD;
the shrubbery, that it was not necessary to&#xD;
return to the drawing-room. Even across&#xD;
the lawn, it was evident that the rest of&#xD;
the party were assembled on the veranda,&#xD;
whence their light tones and laughter floated&#xD;
out on the still night-air. As the two ab-&#xD;
sentees approached, they heard Carl hum-&#xD;
ming one of Miss Desmond's songs, from&#xD;
&#xD;
which he managed to extract all the melody,&#xD;
while Leslie's voice said:&#xD;
* "Norah and Captain Tyndale must have&#xD;
discovered that they possess a great many&#xD;
reminiscences in common to tempt them to&#xD;
extend their walk so far and their talk so&#xD;
long. I am selfish enough to wish they&#xD;
would come back; I want Arthur to hear No.&#xD;
rah sing."&#xD;
"Here I am, Leslie!" said Norab, ad.&#xD;
dancing out of the shadowy darkness, "but&#xD;
I am afraid you must excuse me from singing&#xD;
to.night. I am like our friend the mocking-&#xD;
bird-out of sorts and out of voice, though not,&#xD;
like him, absent in body as well as in mind."&#xD;
"Was he absent? Did you not find him,&#xD;
after all? I am sorry."&#xD;
"So was I-really disgusted! But, like&#xD;
most great singers, he is capricious, and Mr.&#xD;
Middleton offended him by talking, all through&#xD;
jhis most beautiful song last night."&#xD;
"I object to being held accountable for&#xD;
the caprices of the mocking-bird," said Carl's&#xD;
voice from out the demi-obseure in which it&#xD;
was scarcely possible to tell who was who.&#xD;
"But there are half a hundred singing in the&#xD;
copse at the back of the house, Miss Des.&#xD;
mond, if you care to hear them."&#xD;
"One in the rose-hedge would have been&#xD;
better," said Norah' "It is a very disagree-&#xD;
able trait in human nature that we do not&#xD;
care for any thing which we can have in&#xD;
abundance and with little trouble."&#xD;
"I never knew a woman who contradicted&#xD;
herself as often as you do," said Carl. "Be-&#xD;
fore dinner you told me you cared for noth-&#xD;
ing which cost trouble!"&#xD;
"Ab, but that was my trouble!" said&#xD;
she, laughing.&#xD;
"And the trouble which is necessary as a&#xD;
zest is somebody else's, I suppose?"&#xD;
"He that runs might read that much, I&#xD;
should think," said his uncle. "Miss Des-&#xD;
mond's taste is like that of the rest of her&#xD;
sex, but her frankness is her own."&#xD;
"You are quite right, sir, my frankness&#xD;
is my own," said she. "It is Quo thing to&#xD;
which I can lay fair claim."&#xD;
"You must allow the rest of us to think&#xD;
that there are other things to which you can&#xD;
lay quite as fair claim," said Mr. Middleton,&#xD;
who occasionally made puns of such a brill-&#xD;
iant nature, that nobody but himself was&#xD;
aware of them until they were elaborately cx-&#xD;
plained~&#xD;
&#xD;
"If you really want to flatter me," said&#xD;
she, "say that tl~pre is something Irish in my&#xD;
tongue. There is no hing of which I am half&#xD;
so proud of as belonging to the most ready-&#xD;
witted people on the face of the earth."&#xD;
"We'll say any thing you please, if you'll&#xD;
only go and sing for us," said Leslie.&#xD;
"I suppose I must be more obliging than&#xD;
the mocking - bird," said she, with a sigh.&#xD;
"But I shall sing execrably, I give you warn-&#xD;
ing of that. I always do, when I don't feel&#xD;
like it."&#xD;
"Your worst must be better than many&#xD;
other people's best, I am sure."&#xD;
"After such flattery as that, how can I&#xD;
refuse?" said she, turning to Max. "Stay&#xD;
where you all are, then, and I will go an4'&#xD;
sing fqr you."&#xD;
She moved across the veranda as she&#xD;
spoke, and entered the drawing-room; but&#xD;
one member of the group did not obey her&#xD;
last injunction. When she reached the piano,&#xD;
she found Carl Middleton at her side.&#xD;
"Did you not hear me tell you to stay&#xD;
outside ?" she asked, impatiently. "What&#xD;
do you mean by following me like this? Don't&#xD;
you know that it is the thing of all others&#xD;
whieh I most detest?"&#xD;
"I can never enjoy music unless I see the&#xD;
singer," said he, coolly. "Besides, can't you&#xD;
give me credit for a little curiosity? I am&#xD;
anxious to hear bow that fellow out~ yonder&#xD;
managed to defend his audacious assertion at&#xD;
dinner."&#xD;
"Is it so incredible that a man who has&#xD;
lived in France all his life should have seen&#xD;
me, who have lived there the greater part of&#xD;
mine ?"' she asked, indifferently.&#xD;
"Not incredible, nor even remarkable as&#xD;
an abstract fact. As a particular fact, how-&#xD;
ever, I would be willing to wager my next&#xD;
good horse that it is a pure invention of his&#xD;
own impudence and his cousin s necessity."&#xD;
"Perhaps so," said she, lightly running&#xD;
her hand over the keys, "but there are some&#xD;
things which it is less trouble and better pol-&#xD;
icy to believe than to disbelieve: This is one&#xD;
of them."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
"For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,&#xD;
Our fancies are more giddy and infirm,&#xD;
More longing, wavering, sooner lost and won,&#xD;
Than women's are."&#xD;
Axoxo all the pleasant rooms at Rosland,&#xD;
the dining-room in the morning was perhaps&#xD;
the pleasantest. On one side the windows&#xD;
opened down to the green turf, on the other&#xD;
upon a vine-latticed alcove-half piazza, half&#xD;
room-which, being delightfully cool, served&#xD;
as an after-dinner smoking-room to Mr; Mid-&#xD;
dieton and his masculine guests.&#xD;
"What a pleasant place!" Norah said,&#xD;
strolling into it on the morning after th9 Tyn-&#xD;
dales had dined at Rosland. She had come&#xD;
down rather early, and, entering the break-&#xD;
fast - room, found only Carl in occupation.&#xD;
"How charmingly airy, and what a fragrant&#xD;
odor of good tobacco seems to pervade every&#xD;
thing! Do you know," she added, laughing,&#xD;
that, although I would 'not for any considera-&#xD;
tion betray the fact to our friends here, I am&#xD;
very fond of a cigarette, and I should like&#xD;
nothing better than to take one after dinner&#xD;
in this pretty nook."&#xD;
"Why not do it, then ?" asked he. "You&#xD;
cannot really think that my aunt or Leslie&#xD;
would' be so narrow-minded or so ill-bred as&#xD;
to object?"&#xD;
"Object! Oh no, they would not dream&#xD;
of doing that; but they would give me over&#xD;
to utter reprbbation as fast, as Bohemian,&#xD;
and every thing else that good society con-&#xD;
demns. Now, you may not think so, perhaps,&#xD;
but I am on my best behavior at present, and&#xD;
I' don't want to shock them more than I can&#xD;
help. This is my first introduction into re-&#xD;
spectable life, and I must try and learn to be&#xD;
as much like respectable people as I can."&#xD;
"You'll never succeed. There's the stamp&#xD;
of another life and another rearing on you."&#xD;
"That is encouraging, at any rate. But&#xD;
you have yet to learn that I generally succeed&#xD;
in whatever I undertake."&#xD;
"I wish you would undertake to like me,&#xD;
then," said he, with a tone of only half jest&#xD;
in his voice.&#xD;
"That would be quite unnecessary, since I&#xD;
like you already," answered she. "I informed&#xD;
you of that fact yesterday, and you may be&#xD;
sure that I should not have done so if it had&#xD;
not been true. Polite fiction is a branchof&#xD;

A DAUGBTBR OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
AT BREAKFAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
social accomplishment which I have never&#xD;
cultivated. Have you looked at the morning&#xD;
papers. What is the news from France?"&#xD;
She turned carelessly back into the break-&#xD;
fast - room as she spoke, and, walking to a&#xD;
side-table, began turning over the mail that&#xD;
lay there. Provoked by her nonchalance,&#xD;
Carl remained where he was, and in this so-&#xD;
ciable attitude Leslie found them when she&#xD;
entered a few minutes later. It was one of&#xD;
the little things which sometimes occur, as if&#xD;
with strange perversity, to justify an erro-&#xD;
neous opinion. "I think you are wrong about&#xD;
Carl," Miss Grahame had said the evening&#xD;
before to her aunt. "I do not believe he is&#xD;
in love with Norah. He admires her, of&#xD;
course; but I am sure he has not an idea of&#xD;
any thing more." It must be said that con-&#xD;
ecience pricked Leslie a little as she made&#xD;
these comforting remarks; but, as she came&#xD;
in now, she thought how right she had been.&#xD;
No man in love could have resisted such an&#xD;
opportunity for a fi~te-d4~te, she felt sure;&#xD;
therefore it followed, 'with a logic irresistible&#xD;
to the feminine mind, that Carl was not in love.&#xD;
*   "how early you are!" she said to Norah.&#xD;
"Are you looking to see if you have any let-&#xD;
ters? It is too soon yet, is it not?"&#xD;
"To hear from Kate, do you mean? Yes;&#xD;
she would scarcely have written immediately&#xD;
after I left, especially since she started at the&#xD;
same time for Ireland with papa. But there&#xD;
is an attraction in turning over letters, even&#xD;
when they are not for ourselves; and here&#xD;
are a great many."&#xD;
"Let us see whom they arc for," said Les-&#xD;
lie. She took and began sorting them. "Half&#xD;
a dozen for uncle, three for Aunt Mildred, and&#xD;
more than it will be pleasant to answer for&#xD;
znyself.-Carl, there are none for you."&#xD;
"I have mine already - thanks," said&#xD;
Carl, emerging from the alcove.&#xD;
"But here is one which may interest you.&#xD;
It is from Mrs. Sandford, I think."&#xD;
She opened a pale-gray envelope, stamped&#xD;
with monogram~ and crest, and inclosing a&#xD;
sheet of paper filled with writing-&#xD;
---- - as when a field of corn&#xD;
BoWs all its ears before the roaring cast "-&#xD;
as fashionable, illegible, and full of long tails,&#xD;
as such calligraphy usually is.&#xD;
"Yes, it is from Mrs. Sandford," she add-&#xD;
ed, after a minute. "She says she will be&#xD;
here to-day. Think of that, Carl 1"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am thinking of it as hard as possible,"&#xD;
said he; "but I don't know whether I am&#xD;
expected to be overpowered with ecstasy or&#xD;
with disgust."&#xD;
"You will not ask when you are in full&#xD;
tide of flirtation to-morrow."&#xD;
"I have sworn off from flirtation," he an-&#xD;
swered, walking to the window. "Champagne&#xD;
* is a very good thing for holidays, but it is not&#xD;
wholesome when taken as the staple of a&#xD;
man's life."&#xD;
"What is not wholesome when taken as&#xD;
the staple of a man's life?" asked Mr. Mid-&#xD;
dieton, coming in just then, with his feet ar-&#xD;
rayed in the gorgeously-worked slippers which&#xD;
were always such a conspicuous feature of&#xD;
his morning toilet.&#xD;
"Champagne," answered Leslie. "Did&#xD;
you know that it was not goo~l when taken&#xD;
in any way? But Carl, having become philo-&#xD;
sophical, has begun to talk in metaphors and&#xD;
illustrations, like a sage."&#xD;
"I am afraid you are cultivating satire,&#xD;
Leslie," said Carl, strolling back to the table.&#xD;
"Take my advice, and don't-even in its&#xD;
mildest form it makes a woman~so exceeding-&#xD;
ly disagreeable!"&#xD;
"And how does it make a man?"&#xD;
"It is not pleasant in any case, but pleasant&#xD;
things, as a rule, are not expected from a man."&#xD;
"Are they not? This is the first time I&#xD;
ever heard that freedom to be unpleasant is&#xD;
1 one of the many monopolies which your sex&#xD;
are kind enough to claim."&#xD;
"There's nothing like living and learn-&#xD;
I ing," said he, sitting down. "Now, pray,&#xD;
leave your correspondence for the present1&#xD;
and give me a cup of coffee, like a good girl.&#xD;
I have eaten a dozen apricots and three pears&#xD;
already; but one needs something a little&#xD;
more substantial, even in July."&#xD;
Since Mrs. Middleton seldom appeared at&#xD;
breakfast, Leslie took the seat of honor (and&#xD;
trouble) at the head of the - table; and her&#xD;
pretty, deft hands were soon busy among the&#xD;
cups and saucers. It was an anomalous but&#xD;
attractive-looking breakfast over which she&#xD;
presided. Besides the standard dishes-the&#xD;
crisply-broiled "spring-chickens," the flaky&#xD;
rolls and waffles which are the pride of every&#xD;
Southern cook-therewere fruit-stands heaped&#xD;
with peaches, apricots, pears, and plums, beau-&#xD;
tiful enough in color and variety to have&#xD;
tempted any artist alive to make a study of&#xD;
them.&#xD;
&#xD;
am not sure that in midsummer one&#xD;
needs any thing 'more sabstantial than this,"&#xD;
said i~iorah, holding up a peach -with cheeks&#xD;
as gkraring as her own. "You remember the&#xD;
old proverb which says that fruit is golden&#xD;
in the morning, silver at noon, and lead at&#xD;
night?'"&#xD;
"Whatever it may be," said Mr. Middle-&#xD;
ton, "1 cannot say that I like it at breakfast.&#xD;
Of course, there is no accounting for partien-&#xD;
Jar tastes; but give me a beefsteak and a cup&#xD;
of coffee, all the year round."&#xD;
"Give it to me also, if a positive choice&#xD;
must be made," said Norab. "I have nothing&#xD;
whatever ethereal about me-appetite least&#xD;
of all."&#xD;
In this way they were taking their break-&#xD;
fast lei~urely, and talking lightly, as people&#xD;
do who have nothing in particular before&#xD;
them aU day, when a man's figure suddenly&#xD;
appeared on the turf outside the window, and&#xD;
a familiar voice said:&#xD;
"May I come in?"&#xD;
It was Arthur Tyndile, who, being bidden&#xD;
cordially to enter, came in and took the empty&#xD;
seat by Leslie's tray.&#xD;
"I thought I would walk over before it&#xD;
became so very warm," lie said, by way of&#xD;
explanation "Will you take me on your&#xD;
hands for the day? It is really insufferably&#xD;
dull over there at Stratford. I thought yes.&#xD;
terday that I would not attempt to pull&#xD;
through another long warm day with no bet.&#xD;
ter amusement than a novel and Max."&#xD;
"I was under the impression that men&#xD;
were never bored by each other's society,"&#xD;
said Leslie, with that light, rippling laugh&#xD;
which is so significant of happiness on a&#xD;
woman's lips. "Norah and I, now, might be&#xD;
supposed to find each other dull; but Captain&#xD;
Tyndale and yourself-the idea never occurred&#xD;
to sue for a moment! "-&#xD;
"It occurred to us, however, very strong-&#xD;
ly-at least, it occurred to me."&#xD;
"Why did you not bring Captain Fyndale'&#xD;
over with you?" asked Mr. Middleton, hos-&#xD;
pitably.&#xD;
"Simply because the unsociable rascal&#xD;
would not come. lie intends to spend the&#xD;
day tying in the shade on the verge of the&#xD;
lake, and fancying that he is fishing."&#xD;
"There are worse occupations for such a&#xD;
day as this," said Carl-" that is, unless the&#xD;
fish are too much demoralized by the heat to&#xD;
bite. I have half a mind to go out for the&#xD;
&#xD;
same amusement myself.-What do you say,&#xD;
Miss Desmond" (turning quickly), "will you&#xD;
come, also?"&#xD;
"If you will guarantee that it shall be&#xD;
cool and pleasant all the time, that we shall&#xD;
catch as many fish as we desire, and that I&#xD;
shall be neither sunburnt nor freckled."&#xD;
"Let us all goP' said Tyndale, eagerly.&#xD;
"If we drive over to the lake, where Max is,&#xD;
we shall find it very cool and pleasant; Straf-&#xD;
ford is near at hand for luncheon, and we can&#xD;
come back in thecool of the evening to dinner"&#xD;
"There is only one objection," said Les-&#xD;
lie. "Mrs. Sandford is coming to-day."&#xD;
"Mrs. Sandford! Is siw coming to-day?"&#xD;
said Tyndale. An expression of deep disgust&#xD;
fell over his face. It was evident at a glance&#xD;
that this was any thing but a pleasant item&#xD;
of news to him.&#xD;
"Mr. Tyndale seems inclined to furnish&#xD;
you with the ecstasies which I was unable to&#xD;
niford, Leslie," said Carl.&#xD;
"Mrs. Sandford is no favorite of mine,"&#xD;
answered Tyndale; "I confess I am not ~lad&#xD;
to hear that she is coming.&#xD;
"It cannot be helped now, however," said&#xD;
Leslie, "and so-don't you think the fishing&#xD;
might be a good plan for to-morrow? I&#xD;
should like Norah to see Strafford and its&#xD;
grounds."&#xD;
"Yes, let us go to-morrow, by all means,"&#xD;
said Carl.&#xD;
And, since Norah did not say any thing,&#xD;
the matter seemed to be settled that they&#xD;
were to go.&#xD;
After breakfast that general aimlessness&#xD;
and want of purpose which always charac-&#xD;
terize a set of idle people in the country,&#xD;
took full possession of this group. Somebody&#xD;
threw out a suggestion about walking, which&#xD;
somebody else negative by saying it was too&#xD;
warm; Leslie talked of ordering the carriage&#xD;
to pay a visit in the neighborhood, but was&#xD;
readily dissuaded on the score of dust; Carl,&#xD;
being questioned as to why he did not carry&#xD;
out his intention of going fishing, replied that&#xD;
the house could not furnish any good tackle&#xD;
-and so they all sat on the lawn, under a&#xD;
large tulip-tree, and did nothing, until the&#xD;
sun invaded their retreat, and, Mr. Middle-&#xD;
ton coming up just then, carried the two&#xD;
young men off to the stable to look at a horse&#xD;
he had bought, Or was thinking of ouying-&#xD;
nobody besideshimself understood veryclearly&#xD;

04                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.                                                A. TROPICAL STORM.                 65&#xD;
&#xD;
Then, as the two girls returned to the&#xD;
house, Norah said:&#xD;
"You must excuse me, dear, if I leave you&#xD;
for the rest of the morning. I have all my&#xD;
letters yet to write, and you know that epis.&#xD;
tolary effort is not the easiest thing in the&#xD;
world such weather as this."&#xD;
"I am very sorry that you have to go,"&#xD;
said Leslie, in her cordial, sincere voice;&#xD;
"but, of course, letters cannot be put off, and&#xD;
I hope you feel that you are at home-that&#xD;
you can do exactly as you please. Give my&#xD;
dearest love to Kate, anti tell her that if she&#xD;
were here it would be the only thing which&#xD;
could add to my happiness just now."&#xD;
"You are certainly very kind!" said No.&#xD;
rah, with a quick thrill in her voice. "I'll&#xD;
tell Kate with pleasure; and I'll tell her,&#xD;
also, that you deserve all, and more than all,&#xD;
of the happiness of which you speak."&#xD;
So it came to pass that when the two gen-&#xD;
tlemen returned from inspecting Mr. Middle-&#xD;
ton's equine purchase, they found Leslie alone&#xD;
in the hall. "Norah has gone to write let-&#xD;
ters," she said; and Carl felt immediately&#xD;
that human endurance of heat, eiznui, and&#xD;
gossip, had reached its utmost limit. The&#xD;
withdrawal of the sun behind a cloud typifies&#xD;
but poorly the blank cheerlessness which No-&#xD;
rah's withdrawal brought over his world.&#xD;
"I've. got a letter or two to write myself,"&#xD;
he said, and so went off-not to the library,&#xD;
or to his own chamber; but to the little&#xD;
smoking-den by the dining-room, where his&#xD;
letter-writing consisted in lying on a lounge&#xD;
and consuming many more cigars than were&#xD;
good for him. He entertained no doubt, how-&#xD;
ever, but that his epistolary labors were quite&#xD;
as genuine as Miss Desmond's. The idea that&#xD;
she had really gone to her room to write let-&#xD;
ters never for a moment occurred to him.&#xD;
She had gone to avoid Tyndale, he felt sure-&#xD;
so sure that if, indeed, "curses, like young&#xD;
chickens, always come home to roost," Carl&#xD;
certainly provided himself with a liberal brood&#xD;
that morning. "D-n the fellow!" he found&#xD;
himself saying again and again, even while&#xD;
trying to read two orthree alternate newspa-&#xD;
pers and a magazine. "How does he dare to&#xD;
thrust himself into her presence like this? I&#xD;
wish to Heaven she would let me teach him&#xD;
better?" That Mr. Tyndale had a right to&#xD;
be at Rosland irrespective of Norah's pres-&#xD;
ence there, or that Leslie might possess some&#xD;
slight claim upon his consideration, never for&#xD;
&#xD;
an instant occurred to this zealous champion.&#xD;
Neither did it occur to him that he knew ex-&#xD;
ceedingly little of Miss Desmond's "cause,"&#xD;
and that little only by inference. With re-&#xD;
gard to this cause, there was justification&#xD;
enough for all possible ardor in the one&#xD;
grand, simple, and wholly satisfactory reason&#xD;
that it was her own.&#xD;
Meanwhile Arthur Tyndale began to dis-&#xD;
cover that time might hang heavily at Ros-&#xD;
land as well as at Strafford. Fond as he was&#xD;
of Leslie, and charming and bright as she al-&#xD;
ways made herself to him, he felt this morn-&#xD;
ing a certain lack of zest in her society, a&#xD;
certain vague want of the pungent flavor of&#xD;
au excitement which he had specially come to&#xD;
seek. It was so vague-this sense of flatness&#xD;
and tameness - that he was scarcely more&#xD;
than conscious of it, and yet he could not&#xD;
banish it. "I believe you are bored, after&#xD;
all," Leslie said to him, smiling, and, although&#xD;
he quickly denied the assertion, he could not&#xD;
so readily shake off the fact. Yet, in truth,&#xD;
he was something more than merely "bored"&#xD;
-which is a passive state of suffering at least.&#xD;
He was actively conscious of a subtle excite-&#xD;
ment which made the shaded room, with its&#xD;
perfect quiet and whiff of roses on the air, al-&#xD;
most intolerable to him. Leslie herself, for&#xD;
the first time in her life, jarred on his mood&#xD;
through her very unconsciousness of it,&#xD;
through her utter ignorance of the restless&#xD;
craving which possessed him, and to which&#xD;
he would have found it difficult to give a&#xD;
name, being a man little addicted to self-&#xD;
analysis. In fact, he was not a man who&#xD;
ever troubled himself very much about his&#xD;
motives, or who could have been said to own&#xD;
a particularly high standard for any thing,&#xD;
though it can fairly be added for him that he&#xD;
was not in any sense a bad man. He was&#xD;
only one of a large class whose impulses are&#xD;
stronger than their principle; whose courage&#xD;
is not great in the moral order, and who are&#xD;
in all respects born epicureans and seekers of&#xD;
pleasure. Just now he was in a state of&#xD;
transition, which puzzled and annoyed him&#xD;
not a little. He felt that he was outraged-&#xD;
that he had good cause for being outraged&#xD;
-with Norah Desmond: she had defied, in-&#xD;
sulted, scorned, and mocked him, until he&#xD;
could almost have lifted %his hand and struck&#xD;
her down in the proud insolence of her beauty&#xD;
-yet she had so stung and roused him, that&#xD;
he could not banish her from his thoughts&#xD;
&#xD;
let him do what he would. All other things&#xD;
seemed tame after the supreme excitement&#xD;
of her presence, the varying spell of her face,&#xD;
the haunting music of her voice. Leslie, sit-&#xD;
ting in the green shade of the Venetian blinds,&#xD;
with the dainty needle-work of which she was&#xD;
foad in her slender white hands, had little&#xD;
idea of the feverish restlessness which filled&#xD;
her companion. Yet, even to Leslie, it was&#xD;
a relief when their t~te-d-t~te was interrupted&#xD;
by the entrance of Mr. Middleton with a ba-&#xD;
rometer in his hand.&#xD;
"Just as I thought!" he said, with an air&#xD;
of gratification. "We are going to have a&#xD;
storm at last. I was sure this sultry heat&#xD;
meant something of the kind."&#xD;
"Are we going to have a storm?" asked&#xD;
Leslie.~ "If so, I. hope it will clear both the&#xD;
physical and moral atmosphere. Somehow I&#xD;
think we are all more or less affected by the&#xD;
weather this morning-at least, I know we&#xD;
arc all more or less out of sorts."&#xD;
"That might be caused by something be-&#xD;
sides the weather," said her uncle; "but I&#xD;
am pretty sure we shall have a storm, and&#xD;
the usual result of a storm is to clear the&#xD;
physical atmosphere, at least."&#xD;
"I think the day is growing more sul-&#xD;
try," she went on, after a minute, letting her&#xD;
work drop and beginning to apply her fan.&#xD;
-.-" Arthur, will you open the blinds? After&#xD;
all, one must have air, even if one is obliged to&#xD;
take heat with it."&#xD;
* The blinds being opened, it was found&#xD;
that the vertical heat was untempered even&#xD;
by the faintest breeze. The blazing noon&#xD;
seemed beating with fie1~ce power upon the&#xD;
parched earth which lay helpless ~mder its&#xD;
scorching glare. Sound there was none.&#xD;
Through all the wide domain of Nature a&#xD;
stillness reigned, compared to which mid-&#xD;
night is vocal with noise. Not a leaf rustled,&#xD;
not a single bird found courage to chirp; only&#xD;
a locust now and then lifted up its solitary&#xD;
voice in the burning land. The sky above&#xD;
was cloudless and intensely blue; but along&#xD;
the verge of the horizon, especially in the&#xD;
southwest, white, fleecy clouds were lying&#xD;
piled in great masses, which dazzled the eye&#xD;
as it fell on them.&#xD;
"If the rain is coming at all, the sooner&#xD;
it comes the better," said Mr. Middleton,&#xD;
walking to and fro, with the barometer in&#xD;
one hand and a palm-leaf fan in the oth-&#xD;
er. "This is unendurable-or would be un-&#xD;
&#xD;
endurable-if there was any way to remedy&#xD;
it!"&#xD;
Way thero was none, however, save to&#xD;
wait for the storm, which really seemed at&#xD;
last as if i~ meant to come; for, while they&#xD;
panted and gasped for air in the stillness of&#xD;
the burning~ noon, the first distant rumble of&#xD;
thunder smote suddenly like welcome music&#xD;
on their ears. Then, by slow degrees, the&#xD;
dazzling white cloud moved higher up the&#xD;
sky, the rolling sounds grew more frequent,&#xD;
though stilt very distant; the leaves began&#xD;
to rustle a little, as if in thirsty expectation,&#xD;
though the sun still shone with the same&#xD;
pitiless glare on the dusty ground and dried.&#xD;
up herbage. "It really seems impossible that&#xD;
we shall have any rain!" said Leslie, skepti-&#xD;
cally; and, considering how long it had been&#xD;
since they had last seen a cloud, her skepti-&#xD;
cism was excusable. This cloud, however,&#xD;
plainly meant business. It gradually changed&#xD;
from fleecy whiteness to a dark, blue-gray,&#xD;
lurid mass, in the depths of which vivid&#xD;
flashes of lightning leaped and played among&#xD;
Alpine peaks and crags. As it marched&#xD;
steadily up the sky, overspreading and taking&#xD;
possession of the whole heavens, like an army&#xD;
with banners, it was a sight well worth wit-&#xD;
nessing. When it finally reached and en-&#xD;
shrouded the sun, the darkness which fell&#xD;
over the land was like an eclipse. In the&#xD;
house it was scarcely possible to see any&#xD;
thing. The party, who were just then sitting&#xD;
down to luncheon, looked at each other in&#xD;
dismay. It is too much to expect of human&#xD;
nature that it will eat by faith and not by&#xD;
sight in summer weather. There was a mo-&#xD;
ment's pause; then, while Mr. Middleton,&#xD;
with his eye-glass, was closely examining the&#xD;
dish before him, preparatory to announcing&#xD;
its name and nature to the company, Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton ordered Robert to light the gas.&#xD;
"The storm must be near at hand," she said.&#xD;
When the gas was lighted, Leslie uttered&#xD;
a slight exclamation. "WhyNorah is not&#xD;
here!" she said. "It was so dark that I&#xD;
really did not notice her absence before."&#xD;
"I suppose she did not hear the bell,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Middleton.-" Robert, send up and&#xD;
let Miss Desmond know that luncheon is&#xD;
ready."&#xD;
"Perhaps she is asic-"&#xD;
It was Miss Grahame who began this sen-&#xD;
tence, but it was never finished. At that in-&#xD;
stant a flash of lightning, like a solid sheet&#xD;
&#xD;

A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
of flame, seemed to fill the room, paling into&#xD;
insignificance the glow of the gas, and light-&#xD;
ing up every thing with a lurid and terrible&#xD;
glare itapossible to describe. Following so&#xD;
closely that it seemed almost simultaneous, a&#xD;
volleying crash ofthunder shook the house to&#xD;
its very foundation. With this magnificent&#xD;
though rather~ startling prelude, the storm&#xD;
burst. Before the last mighty reverberation&#xD;
had died away, the rush of pouring rain&#xD;
sounded on the roof and down the dry water.&#xD;
spouts.&#xD;
"Are our heads still on our shoulders?"&#xD;
asked Leslie, as soon as it was possible to&#xD;
speak at all. "Did anybody ever see the&#xD;
like of such a flash? What a mercy that&#xD;
none of us were killed?"&#xD;
"As soon as Robert comes back he must&#xD;
close the shutters," said Mrs. Middletos, who&#xD;
had laid down her knife and fork ana turned&#xD;
very pale. "It will not do to run such a&#xD;
risk."&#xD;
"What nil uproar!" said Carl, laying&#xD;
down his knife and fork to listen. "By Jove!&#xD;
wouldn't you think there was a tremendous&#xD;
artillery -duel going on in the celestial re-&#xD;
gions?"&#xD;
"It is more like a pitched battle," said&#xD;
Tyndale. "Listen You cannot only hear&#xD;
the boom of heavy guns, but the rattling vol.&#xD;
leys of musketry."&#xD;
"I thought we should have a deluge when&#xD;
it came," said Mr. Middleton, helping himself&#xD;
complacently to cold mutton, and thinking&#xD;
what a good thing it was for the corn, which&#xD;
needed rain terribly~&#xD;
In the xnidet of the din, which was truly&#xD;
deafening, Robert came back, and said a few&#xD;
words to his miStress, the effect of which was&#xD;
to make that lady look very much astonished.&#xD;
~'Not in the house!" she repeated. "Are&#xD;
you sure? Why, where on earth cam shebe?"&#xD;
"Where can who be?" asked Leslie,&#xD;
quickly. "sot Norah-you can't mean that&#xD;
Norah is not in the house?"&#xD;
"So Robert says," answered Mrs. Middle.&#xD;
ton, "though I scarcely think it can be po~-&#xD;
sible."&#xD;
"Me and Maria's looked everywhere fur&#xD;
her, ma'am, but she can't he found," said&#xD;
Robert, speaking to Miss Grahame; "and&#xD;
Ellen says she saw her going toward the&#xD;
woods 'bout an hour ago, with a book under&#xD;
her arm."&#xD;
"Toward the woods!" two or three&#xD;
&#xD;
simultaneous voices made this exclamation.&#xD;
"Good Heavens!" "You must be mista-&#xD;
ken!" "It can't be pos'dblc!"&#xD;
"Miss Desmond is not crazy, is she?"&#xD;
said Mr. Middleton, when these disjointed ex-&#xD;
clamations were for the moment exhausted.&#xD;
"If not, it stands to reason that she could&#xD;
not have done any thing so foolish as to go&#xD;
to the woods in the burning heat of an hour&#xD;
ago, with a storm plainly coming up."&#xD;
"But where is she, then?" asked Leslie.&#xD;
"She must be somewhere, you know.-Carl,&#xD;
what are you going to do?"&#xD;
"I am going after her," said Carl, rising,&#xD;
and pushing back his chair with a quick jerk&#xD;
-"if you are sure she is not in the house,&#xD;
Robert."&#xD;
"I am perfectly sure, sir," answered Rob-&#xD;
ert. "Me and Maria looked everywhere."&#xD;
"You need not trouble yourself, Mr. Mid-&#xD;
dieton," said Tyndale, also rating abruptly;&#xD;
"Jam going in search of Miss Desmond."&#xD;
"Arc you?" said Carl, haughtily. Their&#xD;
glances met and crossed like two swords.&#xD;
"But, if you will pardon me, I think I had&#xD;
better take that liberty, since I am an old&#xD;
acquaintance of Miss Desmond's, and you are&#xD;
not.'1&#xD;
He turned and was leaving the room, when&#xD;
Mr. Middleton interfered.&#xD;
"Don't be a fool, Carl !" he said, irrita-&#xD;
I bly. "What is the sense of talking about&#xD;
I going out in such a hurricane as this, espe~&#xD;
cially since you have not the faintest idea&#xD;
where Miss Desmond is?"&#xD;
"You don't expect me to sit still with the&#xD;
consciousileSs that ~Ae is out in the hurricane,&#xD;
do you, sir?" answered Carl.-" Leslie, will&#xD;
you send somebody to get mc a water-proof&#xD;
and a shawl or two ?-~-Robert, tell Ellen I&#xD;
want to speak to her in the hall."&#xD;

NORAH'S LETTER TO KATE.&#xD;
&#xD;
07&#xD;
&#xD;
notwithstanding Carl's incredulity, she had a&#xD;
goodly number on hand-she naturally found&#xD;
that it was very warm work. There are warmer&#xD;
things, perhaps-making hay may be one of&#xD;
them-but certainly it is a -sufficiently warm&#xD;
thing to sit down in the exhausting heat of a&#xD;
July day to write two or three letters to that&#xD;
class of people who expect to hear " every&#xD;
thing about every thing " in detail. Now,&#xD;
ready as Norah was with her tongue, she was&#xD;
not particularly ready with hey pen, and she&#xD;
found that her ideas and energy were forsak-&#xD;
ing her in the most disheartening manner.&#xD;
"It is the' intolerable heat," she said, at&#xD;
last, throwing down her pen after an hour~'s&#xD;
fruitless labor. " Horace Walpole himself&#xD;
could not have written any thing more than a&#xD;
string of commonplaces under such circum-&#xD;
stances. 'If I could only get out into the open&#xD;
air! It never is as warm in the open air as&#xD;
it is in-doors, let people say what they will."&#xD;
Fired with this desire, she rose, drew back&#xD;
her blind, and, finding the coast apparently&#xD;
clear on the side of the house next the shrub-&#xD;
bery, proceeded to tie on a garden-hat ,to take&#xD;
a portfolio under her arm, and to cautiously&#xD;
sally forth down the back staircase.&#xD;
Fortunately, or unfortunately, as the case&#xD;
might have been esteemed, Carl was taking a&#xD;
short nap over his novel just then, and so he&#xD;
missed the light footstep which crossed the&#xD;
dining-room, and the light finter of a dress&#xD;
which passed through one of the open win-&#xD;
dows to the lawn. Rejoicing in her escape,&#xD;
Miss Desmond unfurled her parasol, and took&#xD;
a short cut across the sunlit turf to the green&#xD;
depths of the shrubbery beyond.&#xD;
" There are at least a dozen pleasant places&#xD;
there where I can sit and scribble without&#xD;
being suffocated," she thought. "Have I&#xD;
really any gypsy blood, I wonder ? No Zin-&#xD;
gali ever hated the confinement of four walls&#xD;
worse thanlIdo!"&#xD;
But even in the shrubbery she discovered&#xD;
that, at high noon, pleasant places, which&#xD;
should be also shady places, were hard to find.&#xD;
The shadows of the largest trees seemed in-&#xD;
finitesimally small, and proved wholly unsat-.&#xD;
isfactory. Strolling on from point to point,&#xD;
she scarcely knew where dhe was going until&#xD;
she found herself in the neighborhood of the.&#xD;
summer.house where her interview with Ar-&#xD;
thur Tyndale had taken place the day before,.&#xD;
It seemed so full of the recollection of&#xD;
this scene that she turned away impatiently&#xD;
&#xD;
E&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I".&#xD;
&#xD;
for- a moment. But then-as.if remembering&#xD;
herself-she turned back again and took her&#xD;
way toward it with atn air of resolution.&#xD;
" This will not do! !' she said, half aloud ;&#xD;
"I cannot afford to indulge myself in matters&#xD;
of sentiment, even in little things ; It is a bad&#xD;
precedent. One must do whatever is the best&#xD;
thing to do  and just now it is the best thing&#xD;
to find shelter from the sun."&#xD;
The door of the summer-house was stand.&#xD;
ing open, as it had been the day before; the&#xD;
chairs were sitting exactly as they ha'd been&#xD;
left; and on the small table in the centre of&#xD;
the floor was a faded rose which Norah re-&#xD;
membered to have laid there when she at-&#xD;
tempted tofolow Leslie.&#xD;
"Wazs it only yesterday ?" she thought,&#xD;
taking up the flower and looking at it. "Some-&#xD;
how it seems to me a much longer time !"&#xD;
-Then she laid her portfolio on the table,&#xD;
opened both easements to secure as much of&#xD;
a thorough draught as possible, and, taking a&#xD;
fresh sheet of paper, resumed the letter on&#xD;
which she had last been engaged.&#xD;
"You would scarcely credit, Kate," she&#xD;
wrote, "for I scarcely credit it myself until I&#xD;
had fairly tested it, how entirely my old love&#xD;
--was it love, or- only fancy, as you warned&#xD;
me once ?-for this man is dead!i Looking&#xD;
at him as ho stood before mieyesterday--here,&#xD;
ini this very summer-house where I am writing&#xD;
now-I scorned myself, with a scorn that tin.&#xD;
gled to the very ends of my fingers, that I had&#xD;
ever loved him for an hour, and, above all and&#xD;
over all, that I had ever been mad enough to&#xD;
tell him so. For, Kate, he taunted me with&#xD;
it! Think of that-imagine that-if you&#xD;
can! Whether you can or cannot, the fact&#xD;
remains the same-he taunted me with it 1&#xD;
Re asked me-me, whom he was insulting&#xD;
and defying-if I dared to deiiy that I had&#xD;
loved him once! Are you acquainted with&#xD;
any epithet strong enough to express your&#xD;
opinion of such a man ? If so, oblige me by&#xD;
bestowing it upon him, for lam not.&#xD;
"Ah, Kate, he is so pitiful in his cowrard-&#xD;
ice and fear of me! Re has not even the&#xD;
courage necessary for being wholly false. lie&#xD;
alternately blusters and cringes, in order to&#xD;
learn what I 'mean to do.' Baffled in this&#xD;
endeavor, he has set his cousin on the trek&#xD;
of discovery. This cousin is al very trans-&#xD;
parent diplomatist, however, and I do not&#xD;
think will be likely to discover very much.&#xD;
In a small way, he is something of a puzzle&#xD;

68                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.                                                IN THE SUMMER-HOUSE.                 09&#xD;
&#xD;
to me. Yesterday evening I changed my&#xD;
opinion of him several times-which is rather&#xD;
unusual for me, wh~ have had such good&#xD;
cause to know men well, and to read them&#xD;
easily. He possesses the unusual combine.&#xD;
tion of a certain direct frankness (either real&#xD;
or assumed), together with a great deal of im-&#xD;
perturbable self-possession; but what chiefly&#xD;
puzzles me is his motive for espousing his&#xD;
cousins cause, since you are probably as well&#xD;
aware as I am that men do not readily under-&#xD;
take delicate and difficult negotiations (es-&#xD;
pecially with a woman) out of pure friendship&#xD;
for another man. What Captain Tyndale cx-'&#xD;
pects to gain by obtaining from me certain&#xD;
concessions for~ his cousin, which he never&#xD;
soW obtain, I cannot as yet imagine. You will&#xD;
say, with that peculiarly deep knowledge of&#xD;
lwman nature which distinguishes you, that&#xD;
probably the cousin has promised to pay his&#xD;
debts, or to afford hin~ substantial aid in some&#xD;
other form, if he succeeds. I do not know.&#xD;
perhaps it is because the martial diplomate&#xD;
bears the name of my old hero in 'Wallen-&#xD;
stein,' that I do not think he looks like a man&#xD;
to whom it would be exactly safe to make&#xD;
such a proposal. A gentleman, I should say,&#xD;
a man of better moral fibre than his cousin,&#xD;
as well as of higher 'tone '-he proved that&#xD;
last night when he approached with courtesy&#xD;
and respect a woman whom he had evidently&#xD;
been taught to think worthy of neither.&#xD;
"For he-the coward whose name just&#xD;
now I cannot force myself to write - has&#xD;
added, to the passive insult of treating mc as&#xD;
if I were an adventuress, the active insult of&#xD;
saying that I am one. What he, has said,&#xD;
and what left unsaid, what insinuated, and&#xD;
what openly avowed, I can scarcely tell you,&#xD;
foz~ it has been merely hinted to mc. Carl&#xD;
Middleton-hi~lf in honest warning, half with&#xD;
the jealous instinct of a man in love-told&#xD;
me yesterday that Mr. Tyndale had been kind&#xD;
enough to warn Leslie against sending for&#xD;
me, assuring her that I was a woman "with a&#xD;
notoriously fast reputation,' and one with&#xD;
whom 'it would not be well for her to associ-&#xD;
ate.' You kpow these men of the world, as&#xD;
they love to call themselves; you know how,&#xD;
with an accent, an arch of the eyebrow, a&#xD;
shrug of the shoulders, they can put more&#xD;
force and meaning into one simple sentence,&#xD;
than all the eloquence of all the advocates&#xD;
who have ever lived since the beginning of&#xD;
the world could disprove. I can see, I can&#xD;
&#xD;
hear, Arthur Tyndale, as he delivered that&#xD;
warning against me.&#xD;
"And perhaps you womIer how I felt&#xD;
when I heard it repeated by other lips. In&#xD;
truth, my Kate, not much more scorn than I&#xD;
had felt before-scorn so great, so overpow-&#xD;
ering, that, for a time, it literally swallowed&#xD;
up all other feeling. Then, after a while, in.&#xD;
dignatron came over me. I thought, my poor&#xD;
Kate, of our friendless, unprotected girlhood;&#xD;
of our careless, wandering, vagrant life; of&#xD;
how hard we have striven-against odds that&#xD;
none but ourselves can even guess-to keep&#xD;
our names above reproach. I thought-for,&#xD;
in the still hours of the night, I added up my&#xD;
debt against Arthur Tyndale item on item--&#xD;
how well he knew these things, how thor.-&#xD;
oughly he had appreciated our position, how&#xD;
entirely he was aware that the hand which&#xD;
Leslie held out might have been to both of us&#xD;
scarcely less than a hand from heaven. Then&#xD;
I thought of his passionate and persistent de-&#xD;
votion when we knew him first; of his reso-&#xD;
lute determination that I-who had already&#xD;
learned to put scant faith in men's admiration&#xD;
or men's love-should learn to love him; of&#xD;
his success, at last; of his departure; of his&#xD;
silence; of the manner in which he flung this&#xD;
love, which he had won at such great cost&#xD;
and from so proud a heart, into the dust, like&#xD;
a worthless thing. I recalled the manner in&#xD;
which he had denied to my face that he ever&#xD;
knew me; the insult which he had added to&#xD;
treachery, the slander to scorn; I burned it&#xD;
into my comprehension and memory that, not&#xD;
content with having broken his faith, and&#xD;
thrown his honor to the winds, he had opened&#xD;
his false lips-than which falser never spake&#xD;
since the birth of time-to take away that&#xD;
good name which, of great value to all wom-&#xD;
en, is simply priceless to us.&#xD;
"And, when the debt was all added up, it&#xD;
w~is so great that I thought to myself, 'What&#xD;
reprisal can ever equal it?"'&#xD;
The passionate excitement of the writer&#xD;
had waxed so great over the last paragraph&#xD;
that, as her pen dashed, rapidly across the&#xD;
paper, covering it with a heavy, black chirog-&#xD;
raphy, very unlike a woman's usual hand, she&#xD;
had failed to notice the steadily advancing&#xD;
cloud, or the muttering thunder overhead.&#xD;
At the last words, however, that sudden dark.&#xD;
ness fell which amazed the party assembled&#xD;
round the luncheon-table at Rosland; andy&#xD;
&#xD;
wondering what strange eclipse had overtaken&#xD;
the noonday, she looked up with a start.&#xD;
Then she saw the cloud, of whose approach she&#xD;
had before been merely vaguely conscious, and&#xD;
saw, also, how near at hand it was. Through&#xD;
the open door she commanded an excellent&#xD;
view of the lurid blackness which had over-&#xD;
spread the whole western heavens, against&#xD;
which the green depths of summer foliage&#xD;
stood out in vivid relief. As yet every thing&#xD;
was very still-but, as she gazed, a low, sigh-&#xD;
ing wind swept by, and two or three birds&#xD;
flew up out of a neighboring copse, uttering&#xD;
shrill, discordant cries. "There is going to&#xD;
be a storm!" she thought-a conclusion in&#xD;
which a child of two yearS old might have ac-&#xD;
quiesced-" shall I have tinfe to reach the&#xD;
hous~ before it bursts?"&#xD;
Since there was no weather-seer at hand&#xD;
to answer this question, she paused irreso-&#xD;
lutely and looked at the cloud. As she&#xD;
looked, it gave its terrible and majestic an-&#xD;
swer back. Her very eyeballs seemed&#xD;
scorched by the blinding glare that suddenly&#xD;
lit up the whole face of Nature, and she felt&#xD;
as if the house in which she stood was tum-&#xD;
bling over her head in the pealing crash which&#xD;
followed. Immediately after this, her breath&#xD;
was literally swept away by a storm of wind&#xD;
which rushed into the summer-house like an&#xD;
incarnate fiend; and, when she recovered it,&#xD;
she found herself seated again in the chair&#xD;
from which she had risen, clutching the table&#xD;
by a blind instinct, while her portfolio and&#xD;
papers were already gone from sight, dancing&#xD;
a demoniac dance on the wings of the wind,&#xD;
thanks to the convenient and delightful&#xD;
thorough draught which she had arranged.&#xD;
Her first idea was that she had been&#xD;
struck by that awful and vivid flash of light-&#xD;
ning; but, finding this to be an erroneous im-&#xD;
pression, she then decided that it would be&#xD;
well to close the windows against the storm&#xD;
which was rushing in. It cost her a struggle&#xD;
to accomplish this feat, especially on the&#xD;
southern side, for the hurricane beat her&#xD;
back again and again with fierce violence.&#xD;
Succeeding at last, however, she then' turned&#xD;
her attention to the door. It proved, how-&#xD;
ever, even more unmanageable thanthe win-&#xD;
dows had done. The bolt being defective,&#xD;
as fast as it was closed the wind burst it&#xD;
open again with a 'triumphant blast~ Dis-&#xD;
mayed at the third repetition of such a per-&#xD;
formance, Norah tried the effect of placing a&#xD;
&#xD;
chair against it. The effect was simply that&#xD;
of seeing a chair knocked over in the floor,&#xD;
and the door burst wide open for the fourth&#xD;
time. Then she tried the table, which, being&#xD;
a little more substantial, held its own for&#xD;
several minutes. During these minutes, Miss&#xD;
Desmond had time to consider how very warm&#xD;
it was, now that she was safely shut up in a&#xD;
box, to think that she had much better have&#xD;
stayed in the house after all, to wish that she&#xD;
had noticed the approach of the storm a lit-&#xD;
tle earlier, to wonder how long it would last,&#xD;
and to discover that the roof of the sum-&#xD;
mer-house was leaking-when the door was&#xD;
burst open for the fifth time, and the drenched&#xD;
figure of a man appeared on the thresh-&#xD;
old.&#xD;
"Carl !" she said, involuntarily, but a&#xD;
pair of long, dark mustache had not apper-&#xD;
tamed to Carl's personal appearance when&#xD;
she saw him last, and, a very battered hat&#xD;
being pushed back at that moment, she rec-&#xD;
ognized Max Tyndale.&#xD;
The astonishment on both sides was very&#xD;
great, and without any real or simulated ad-&#xD;
mixture of pleasure.&#xD;
"Miss Desmond!" said Max. Then he&#xD;
took off his hat and laughed-shaking him-&#xD;
self like a Newfoundland dog. "I suppose&#xD;
you were caught in the rain as well as my-&#xD;
self," he said. "I had no alternative but to&#xD;
seek the nearest shelter. It is a regular&#xD;
tropical storm!"&#xD;
"I have not been in the rain, but I was&#xD;
caught here," answered Norah. "Pray shut&#xD;
the door if you are coming in," she added,&#xD;
anxiously. "I was sure the wind had burst&#xD;
it open again."&#xD;
"I suppose I ought to have asked if I&#xD;
might come in," said he, proceeding to obey&#xD;
her directions. "But I had no idea of find-&#xD;
ing any one, and then-"&#xD;
"And then you know that you have quite&#xD;
as much , right to be here as I have. Don't&#xD;
make foolish apologies, Captain Tyndale;&#xD;
but push the table as hard as you can against&#xD;
the door, else it will not stay shut."&#xD;
"Is that the way?" asked he, pushing&#xD;
very hard indeed.&#xD;
"Yes, that is the way, but I am afraid it&#xD;
will be open agaha in a few minutes-the&#xD;
storm seems really increasing in violence.&#xD;
Oh! I have an idea! You intend 'to sit&#xD;
down, I imagine. Well, suppose you sit on&#xD;
tkal? It will help to.keep it firm."&#xD;

&#xD;
"On the table, do you mean?"&#xD;
"Yes, on the table, of course."&#xD;
"Very well," said he, and immediately&#xD;
sat down, without exhibiting any sign of cur.&#xD;
prise, or making any objection.&#xD;
"You must be invaluable as a 'soldier,"&#xD;
said Miss Desmond, after a short pause, dur.&#xD;
ing which she had regarded him as he sat&#xD;
with his arms crossed and his back against&#xD;
the door~&#xD;
"You are very kind," he answered, "but&#xD;
it would not become me to say that you are&#xD;
right."&#xD;
"Prompt, unquestioning obedience is the&#xD;
greatest virtue of a soldier, is it not?"&#xD;
"It is one of the most necessary, at&#xD;
least."&#xD;
"You certainly seem to possess it in&#xD;
more than ordinary degree."&#xD;
"I have generally found it less trouble to&#xD;
obey than to question; therefore, you see&#xD;
that my obedience would scarcely come under&#xD;
the head of a virtue."&#xD;
"It might come under the head of a rec.&#xD;
ommeudation though."&#xD;
"It has done that once or twice in my life."&#xD;
"As when-?"&#xD;
"Oh," said he, smiling, "I hope you don't&#xD;
think me so fodlish or so egotistical as to&#xD;
entertain a woman with accounts of military&#xD;
events."&#xD;
"And pray why not?" asked she, a lit.&#xD;
tle piqued. "Do you think a woman inca-&#xD;
pable of understanding them?"&#xD;
"Not necessarily; but' the chances are,&#xD;
in the 'first place, that 'she would be very~&#xD;
much bored; and, in the second place, that&#xD;
the relator would be tempted to embroider,&#xD;
or at least to dwell upon his own achieve.&#xD;
raents-.-two things which no man of sense&#xD;
ever does."&#xD;
"You should not snake such sweeping as.&#xD;
sectionss about men of sense; you condemn&#xD;
the majority of mankind altogether."&#xD;
"Being in the majority, tl~ey can afford&#xD;
to support the fact with philosophy, since&#xD;
majorities govern most things in this fine&#xD;
world of ours,"&#xD;
"Yes-unfortunately. Would it not be&#xD;
a singular, and, from some points of view,&#xD;
rather a pleasant thing, if we were able to&#xD;
reverse matters and give the power to ml.&#xD;
~noritles for a time? I belong to so many&#xD;
minorities myself that I should like it cx.&#xD;
tremely."&#xD;
&#xD;
"And I should not object. Matters could&#xD;
not be much worse than they are' at present."&#xD;
"I am surprised that fishing has not in-&#xD;
duced you to look at the affairs of the world&#xD;
more cheerfully~ People who like that amuse.&#xD;
went say that one views every thing so phil.&#xD;
osophically from an angling point of view."&#xD;
"Not when the fish refuse to bite, when&#xD;
one breaks a good line, and when a storm&#xD;
comes up and wets one to the skin."&#xD;
"I am afraid you must be very wet," said&#xD;
she, as if the idea had occurred to her for&#xD;
the first time. "Don't you think you will&#xD;
take cold?"&#xD;
"It is not impossible, but scarcely prob-&#xD;
able."&#xD;
"How did 'you chance to come here?"&#xD;
she went on, after a minute. "' I thought your&#xD;
cousin said that you were fishing in some&#xD;
lake which cannot be very near at hand?"&#xD;
"I was fishing there, but I grew tired of&#xD;
an amusement which came to nothing, and I&#xD;
was on my way to Rosland for luncheon when&#xD;
the storm came up."&#xD;
"It must have come i~p very quickly, for&#xD;
I was writing, and did not notice it until&#xD;
there was not time to reach the house."&#xD;
"Writing !-'were you writing I~er.e 9 That&#xD;
accounts for various waifs and strays of paper&#xD;
that I saw tossing about. One of them came&#xD;
as straight to me as if it had been directed&#xD;
und sent by post. I was hurrying along,&#xD;
when it blew intG my hand so oCten and so&#xD;
persistently that I caught arA crammed it&#xD;
into lay pocket.-By.the-by, I suppose it is&#xD;
there yet."&#xD;
He put his hand into one of his pockets&#xD;
as he spoke, and drew forth a crumpled mass&#xD;
of blotted paper, which he proceeded to&#xD;
smooth out on the table.&#xD;
"The rain has made the ink run to such&#xD;
an extent that I fear it is almost illegible,"&#xD;
he said. "But, still, I think it must be yours,&#xD;
Miss Desmond."&#xD;
"Why do you think so?" asked she.&#xD;
He looked up with a quick glance in his&#xD;
dark eyes.&#xD;
"Becanse, if you will excuse me, I see a&#xD;
sentence here which no one else could have&#xD;
written," he answered.&#xD;
"What is it?" she asked, as coolly as he.&#xD;
fore.&#xD;
"Shall I bring the letter and show it to&#xD;
von?"&#xD;
"No; read it aloud."&#xD;

"Well, did you not hear me? The thun-&#xD;
der does make a great noise. I said, 'Ilead it&#xD;
~&#xD;
"Are you in earnest?"&#xD;
"Am I likely to be in jest?" demanded&#xD;
she, haughtily.&#xD;
"It is your own affair, of course," said he,&#xD;
with the momentary. surprise vanishing from&#xD;
his face. "I only beg you to believe that my&#xD;
eye fell on the passage accidentally, and that&#xD;
I have seen nothing else. This is it"-he&#xD;
bent over the letter and read aloud 'the fol-&#xD;
lowing, with the utmost san~rfroid:&#xD;
"'Looking at him as he stood before me&#xD;
yesterday-here, in this very summer-house&#xD;
where I am writing now--I scorned myself,&#xD;
with a scorn that tingled to the very ends, of&#xD;
my lingers, that I had ever loved him for an&#xD;
hour, and, above all and over all,~that I had&#xD;
ever been mad enough to tell him so 1"'&#xD;
"And you think lam the only person who&#xD;
could have written that?" asked she, in a&#xD;
quick voice, as he stopped.&#xD;
He looked up again, and, as he did so,&#xD;
womler seized him that she should have&#xD;
forced him to read aloud any thing which had&#xD;
power to bring such a blush to her face-&#xD;
such a look of pain to her eyes.&#xD;
"Forgive me," he said, almost humbly.&#xD;
"I was guilty of gross presumption in tliink~&#xD;
lug or saying any thing about it."&#xD;
"You were guilty of nothing of the kind,"&#xD;
answered she, imperiously. "How could a&#xD;
man possibly be guilty of gross presumption&#xD;
toward a woman. whom he holds as you hold&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"Miss Desmond, I must protest-"&#xD;
"I~rotest nothing," interrupted she, quick-&#xD;
ly, "or you will force me to hold your word&#xD;
as lightly as that of any other man. 'No&#xD;
doubt you are like all the rest of your sex;&#xD;
but, as yet, I have not found it out. For&#xD;
novelty's, sake, therefore, let me believe that&#xD;
you sometimes' tp~ak truth-even to a wotn-&#xD;
an!"&#xD;
"Believe me, I was not going to speak&#xD;
any thing else when you interrupted me2'&#xD;
"Were you going to protest that you do&#xD;
not take me to be the woman whom' Arthur&#xD;
Tyndale has descrIbed?"&#xD;
"No; I was ~nly going to protest against&#xD;
your interpretation of my thoughts, and your&#xD;
idea of my opinions."&#xD;
"Well, you are candid so far, at any rate,"&#xD;
&#xD;
said she, smiling a little. "Do you know,"&#xD;
she added, after a minute, "that I am half&#xD;
inclined to ask you to read that blotted letter&#xD;
which has come so singularly into your&#xD;
hands? You cannot Mieve that I bad any&#xD;
intention of the kind when I wrote it. There.&#xD;
fore, you may take it as a truthful statement&#xD;
of certain facts which you have no doubt&#xD;
heard differently rendered-froan your cous-&#xD;
in's point of view."&#xD;
lie looked at her keenly.&#xD;
"Will you pardon me if I ask again wheth-&#xD;
er you are in earnest?" he said, gravely.&#xD;
"I am perfectly in earnest," she answered,&#xD;
" unless you consider the matter of too little&#xD;
importance to be worth the trouble of deci-&#xD;
phering such a scrawl!"&#xD;
* lie replied by taking up the letter and be-&#xD;
ginning to read. For some minutes after&#xD;
this, silence reigned-that is to say, n~ words&#xD;
were spoken; but the pouring rahi and the&#xD;
rolling thunder made any thing but silence in&#xD;
the literal sense oF tb~ tertn~ Norah watched&#xD;
Max oiosely,~ as his eye traveled down 'the&#xD;
pages of the letter, but she was&amp;amp;ble to make&#xD;
very little of his face0 in truth, he knew that&#xD;
he was being watched, and so put on his niost&#xD;
thoroughly impassive and non-committal look.&#xD;
This look he carried through to the ~rcry&#xD;
end of the letter; but, when he lifted his eyes&#xD;
at last, the keen glance of the woman before&#xD;
him read in tl&amp;amp;em that she had won his belief&#xD;
and respect. When he spoke, his words were&#xD;
very, simple and characteristic:&#xD;
"' I am glad you did me the honor to show&#xD;
me this, Miss De~niopd. Without holding&#xD;
any such opinion of you as you have imagined&#xD;
that I did, I certainly was not aware of the&#xD;
truth asit is here told."&#xD;
"I did not suppose it possible that you&#xD;
were," she answered, "sad: I.~s.~well, I do not&#xD;
usually care what peop'1~ think of me, but&#xD;
this opportunity seemed to come without my&#xD;
seeking, and I took advantage of it on an im.&#xD;
pulse which I may possibly regret."&#xD;
"I hope you wilI~ not do so!" he said,&#xD;
quickly. "I hope you do not think so poorly&#xD;
of sue as to imagine that I misunderstand in the&#xD;
least, or could make any use w1~ieh you would&#xD;
disapprove of the contents of this letter,."&#xD;
"No," said she, slowly. "I think you&#xD;
may be honest-and honorable. The two&#xD;
things are not the same, you knew, and many&#xD;
men who arethe ~rst are not the last."&#xD;
"Thanks," said he, sailing "I consider&#xD;

&#xD;
that as an aniende honorable for being called&#xD;
'a transparent diplomatist."'&#xD;
"I am not sure that you are such a very&#xD;
transparent diplomatist," said she, looking at&#xD;
him, and smiling also. "As you may have&#xD;
noticed, I confessed to Kate that your motive&#xD;
for espousing your cousin's cause-a cause&#xD;
which you could not have failed to suspect to&#xD;
be a poor one-puzzled me."&#xD;
"I noticed that you spoke of me in much&#xD;
better terms than I deserved," said he, flush.&#xD;
ing suddenly, "for I-I did not think very&#xD;
highly of ~you when I approached you last&#xD;
night, Miss Desmond."&#xD;
"I was aware of that at the time," said&#xD;
she, ." and therefore I appreciated your cour-&#xD;
tesy Rnd respect all the more."&#xD;
"You did not resent what lay behind&#xD;
those things?"&#xD;
"No. Why should I have resented that&#xD;
which was perfectly natural I"'&#xD;
"Most women would not stop to reason&#xD;
on a question of that kind."&#xD;
"So mntich the worse for most women,&#xD;
then. But 'let us return to our sheeps,' as&#xD;
t~e Frenchman said. Were we not talking&#xD;
of your motive for advocating your cousin's&#xD;
cause?"&#xD;
" You were talking of it."&#xD;
"Which means that you do not wish to&#xD;
do so?"&#xD;
"No," said he, "it does not mean that,&#xD;
for really I have no objection to telling you&#xD;
what my motive is and has been."&#xD;
"Well," said she, with frank curiosity,&#xD;
"wkat is it, then? You must' forgive me if&#xD;
I am inquisitive, but I cannot bear to be puz.~&#xD;
zled."&#xD;
"There is no reason why you should be&#xD;
puzzled "-he ~eg~n, when, just at that mo.&#xD;
ment, they beeitme conscious that somebody&#xD;
outside was knocking violently on the door,&#xD;
and shouting in an unintelligible manner be.&#xD;
sides.&#xD;
"Another unfortunate has been caught in&#xD;
the storm and wants shelter, I suppose," said&#xD;
Norah. "We have no alternative but to let&#xD;
him in, have we? Really, this begins to put&#xD;
one in mind of an inn in a play."&#xD;
"Don't break down the door-.I'll open it&#xD;
in a minute!" shouted Max to the outsider,&#xD;
who certainly seemed in violent haste.&#xD;
He descended from the table as he spoke,&#xD;
and, drawing it aside, the door swung quickly&#xD;
back - revealing the water. proof- enveloped&#xD;
&#xD;
figure of Carl Middleton, with a broken um-&#xD;
brella in one hand and a bundle of wraps&#xD;
under the other arm.&#xD;
"How glad I am to find you! ~ he said,&#xD;
stalking breathlessly forward to Norab. "I&#xD;
was terribly afraid you would not be here,&#xD;
although the gardener swore he saw you as&#xD;
he passed the door an hour ago. You've no&#xD;
idea how anxious they all are about you at&#xD;
the house!'&#xD;
"Did you come out in all this storm to&#xD;
look for me?" she said. "How could you&#xD;
be so foolish! It is so kind of you, and so&#xD;
provoking of you, both at once! You will&#xD;
take your death in the way of a cold, and&#xD;
then what shall I do for a champion?"&#xD;
"I will never die while you need me, you&#xD;
may be sure. But are you confident you are&#xD;
not wet? Have you not been caught in the&#xD;
rain ~t all?"&#xD;
"Not at all. Not any more than if I had&#xD;
been sitting in my own room, where it would&#xD;
have been wiser to have stayed. But there is&#xD;
Captain Tyndale, who was even more wet than&#xD;
yourself when he first sought refuge here."&#xD;
Thus recalled to a sense of propriety, Carl&#xD;
turned and shook hands with Max.&#xD;
"I beg pardon for not speaking before,"&#xD;
he said, "but I was so anxious about Miss&#xD;
Desmond-I left Leslie, firmly persuaded that&#xD;
she had been struck by a bolt of lightning, or&#xD;
knocked over by a falling tree."&#xD;
"I am sorry to have caused so much un.&#xD;
easiness," said Norah, "but it is a very good&#xD;
rule in life to expect the best until the worst&#xD;
happens. It spares one so much unnecessary&#xD;
annoyance."&#xD;
"I suggested something of that kind to&#xD;
Leslie," said Carl, "but she paid no,~tention&#xD;
to it."&#xD;
"We are none of us likely to be philos-&#xD;
ophers in an emergency," said Max. Then&#xD;
he walked to the door, which still remained&#xD;
open, and stood there, drinking in the fresh,&#xD;
rain-laden air. "I think your imprisonment&#xD;
will be at an end very ~oon, Miss Desmond,"&#xD;
he went on. "The storm will be likely to&#xD;
pass as quickly as it came. Already the clouds&#xD;
are breaking in the west, and the worst is&#xD;
plainly over."&#xD;
His prediction was amply verified. Fifteen&#xD;
minutes later, Norah decidedthat it was quite&#xD;
possible for her to attempt to return ~o the&#xD;
house. Trues the ground was a literal lake,&#xD;
and the clouds were yet sending quick show-&#xD;
&#xD;
ers upbn it, but Carl had brought a pair&#xD;
of overshoes, besides a water-proof and two&#xD;
shawls, so she felt able to defy moisture ei-&#xD;
ther above or below. When she was equipped&#xD;
for departure, when the overshoes had been&#xD;
fitted on, and she had drawn the dark hood&#xD;
of the water-proof over her graceful head,&#xD;
she turned and looked at Max.&#xD;
"Of course you are coming too, are you&#xD;
not?" she said.&#xD;
"I believe not," he answered. "My ward-&#xD;
robe is at Strafford, and therefore I must&#xD;
turn my steps in that direction. After all, it&#xD;
is not very much farther to go. Good-day,&#xD;
Miss Desmond, and let me hope sincerely that&#xD;
you will not suffer any ill effects from your&#xD;
exposure."&#xD;
"That is a very stiff, disagreeable fellow,"&#xD;
said flarl, as, having parted, they went their&#xD;
different ways. "L cannot understand how all&#xD;
those people at Rosland like him so much."&#xD;
"And perhaps he cannot understand why&#xD;
they like you so much," said Norah. "Lik.&#xD;
ing and disliking are arbitrary and inscrutable&#xD;
things at best. By~the way," said she, start-&#xD;
ing suddenly and speaking half to herself,&#xD;
"he carried my letter with him!"&#xD;
"Your letter!" repeated Carl, surprise&#xD;
and jealousy instantly appearing in mixed&#xD;
quantities on his face. "What the deuce, is&#xD;
he doing with a letter of yours? You must&#xD;
have takem amazing strides toward intimacy~&#xD;
while you were shut up there together!"&#xD;
"You forget that we are old friends,"&#xD;
said she, maliciously. "And, after all, the&#xD;
letter does not matter, being of little or no&#xD;
importance.~~&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
"Let the world roll blindly on!&#xD;
Give me shadow, give me sun,&#xD;
And a perfumed day as this is:&#xD;
Let me lie,&#xD;
Dreamfully,&#xD;
When the last quick sunbeams shiver&#xD;
Spears of light across the river,&#xD;
And a breeze which seems the sigh&#xD;
Of a fairy floating by,&#xD;
Voyly kisses&#xD;
Tender leaf and feathered grasses;&#xD;
Yet so soft its breathing passes,&#xD;
These tall fernejust glimmering o'er me,&#xD;
Blending goldenly before me,&#xD;
Hardly quIver!"&#xD;
"How beautiful your sister is, my dear I "'&#xD;
said Mrs. Sandford, enthusiastically. "You I&#xD;
&#xD;
can't imagine how much I am charmed with&#xD;
her!"&#xD;
"Yes, Norah is certainly very beautiful !"&#xD;
said Leslie. "I am glad you like her. She&#xD;
is very attractive, too, I think, although her&#xD;
manner may strike you at first as a little&#xD;
cold-"&#xD;
"Oh, no, no-only dignified, and reserved,&#xD;
and delightful."&#xD;
"-But, after a while, you will see that it&#xD;
is only manner. I do not think that she is&#xD;
cold herself."&#xD;
"Well, now, do you know I rather like&#xD;
cold people," said Mrs. Sandt'ord, opening&#xD;
her blue eyes very wide indeed. "I am so&#xD;
warm - hearted, so outspoken, so impulsive&#xD;
myself, that I admire and really envy people&#xD;
like Miss Desmond, who are always self-con-&#xD;
tuined, always say and do the right thing,&#xD;
and never possibly commit themselves to any&#xD;
thing wrong."&#xD;
I hope Norah does not deserve quite&#xD;
such high praise as that," said Leslie. "So&#xD;
great an amount of perfection would be unin-&#xD;
teresting."&#xD;
"She is charming," repeated Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford-" really charming! I assure you that&#xD;
I have fallen quite in love with her!"&#xD;
This assurance wars given on the morning&#xD;
after the volatile lady's arrival at Rosland.&#xD;
Breakfast being over, she found herself for a&#xD;
few minutes alone with Miss Orahame in the&#xD;
drawing-room, and it was impossible to allow&#xD;
these few minutes to pass without going into&#xD;
raptures over such a convenient and tempting&#xD;
subject for raptures as Miss Desmond. Les-&#xD;
lie, who understood her guest very well, was&#xD;
not at all surprised.&#xD;
"Norah would be flattered if she knew&#xD;
how well she had impressed you," she said,&#xD;
moving back a few paces, to see if some flow-&#xD;
ers she had been arranging stood well in the&#xD;
vase. "She is not exactly the kind of woman&#xD;
whom other women usually like."&#xD;
"Because she is so beautiful, I suppose,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Sandford. "But, then, I never was&#xD;
jealous in my Iife.-never! My greatest&#xD;
friends have always been among beautiful&#xD;
women."&#xD;
"You have never had any need for jeal-&#xD;
ousy," said Leslie: it was impossible in com.&#xD;
mon courtesy to say less. But then she&#xD;
changed the subject-paying and receiving&#xD;
compliments being very little to her taste.&#xD;
"Come and tell me if you do not think this&#xD;

vase iS well arranged," she said, "and look&#xD;
what lovely sofrano-buds these are 1"&#xD;
While Mrs, Sandford was going into rap-&#xD;
tures over the vane and over the sofrano-buds,&#xD;
Uarl entered the room, looking rather out of&#xD;
humor.&#xD;
"Have you given up the fishing expedi-&#xD;
tion, Leslie?" he inquired. "I heard you&#xD;
promise Tyndale last night that we would be&#xD;
over there early this morning, but I don't see&#xD;
any movement that way, and the sun is get.&#xD;
ting higher and hotter every minute."&#xD;
"I ordered the carriage when we left the&#xD;
bk'eakfast-table," Leslie answered, "and I was&#xD;
only waiting until it came round, to propose&#xD;
that we should put on our hats."&#xD;
"The carriage!" repeated he, in a tone&#xD;
of disgust. "Why did you not order thq&#xD;
phaeton for Mrs. Sandford and yourself, and&#xD;
let Miss Desmond go with me on horse-&#xD;
back?"&#xD;
"Because Norah declined such an arrange-&#xD;
mont, saying that her habit would be too&#xD;
much in the way at Stratford."&#xD;
"Mrs. Middleton is not going with us,&#xD;
then?" said Mrs. Saudford, turning round&#xD;
from the roses.&#xD;
"No; she is not fond of damp grass, and&#xD;
she thinks that you will be chaperone enough&#xD;
for the party," answered Leslie, smiling.&#xD;
"How absurd it seems to talk of m~i being&#xD;
a chaperone at all," said the pretty widow,&#xD;
with a silvery laugh-so even that ill-natured&#xD;
people averred it had been practiced at the&#xD;
key-board. "I never can repress ray amuse-&#xD;
inent at the idea !-..One feti.s so young, Mr.&#xD;
Middleton, even after one has ceased to be ex-&#xD;
actly young."&#xD;
"If feeling follows appearance, I can well'&#xD;
imagine that you might fancy yourself six-&#xD;
teen," Said Carl, paying with only tolerable&#xD;
grace the tribute which was plainly expected&#xD;
from him.&#xD;
"The French say that, in the matter ~f&#xD;
age, a woman is what she looks," said Leslie,&#xD;
coming to his reliaf.-" Carl, what do you&#xD;
think of going to inquire if the carriage is&#xD;
not coming to the door to-day?"&#xD;
Ten minutes later, the carriage drove to&#xD;
the door, and the ladies in linen dresses-&#xD;
dresses not likely to be injured by mud or&#xD;
water-and becoming sailor-hats were assem-&#xD;
bled on the veranda. Mrs. Middleton, pro-&#xD;
vided with a fan and a novel, and established&#xD;
in a comfortable wicker-chair, looked at them&#xD;
&#xD;
with compassionate surprise. It was a dis-&#xD;
pensation of Providence, she thought, that&#xD;
young people required amusement-but what&#xD;
amusement was to be found in driving two or&#xD;
three miles for the purpose of spending the&#xD;
day on damp grass and in wet boats, with a&#xD;
scorching sun overhead, when they might&#xD;
have staid in a cool house or on a shaded lawn,&#xD;
and taken life ,easily, she was unable to im-&#xD;
agine.&#xD;
"You think you will not be back to&#xD;
luncheon?" she asked, in a tone which plain.&#xD;
ly said, "If you are wise, you will be."&#xD;
"Oh, no," Leslie answered, turning on the&#xD;
steps, while Carl assisted Mrs. Sandford and&#xD;
Miss Desmond into the carriage. "I prom.&#xD;
ised Arthur that we would certainly take&#xD;
luncheon at Stratford. We shall be back in&#xD;
time for dinner, but not before."&#xD;
"Very well," said Mrs~Middleton. "I am&#xD;
sure I hope you will have a pleasant day, but&#xD;
I do not think the rain has tempered the heat&#xD;
at all, and in shady places you will be likely&#xD;
to find it very damp, indeed."&#xD;
"Aunt Mildred is evidently of the opinion&#xD;
that our prospects of enjoyment are not very&#xD;
brilliant," said Leslie, after they had driven&#xD;
off. "'As a general rule, I agree with her in&#xD;
thinking that al-fresco parties are mostly fail-&#xD;
ures-but occasionally they are pleasant."&#xD;
"Chiefly when they are impromptu," said&#xD;
Carl. "Rarely ever when they have been&#xD;
talked over and arranged."&#xD;
"This one is impromptu, is it not?" asked&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford.&#xD;
"Partly so; enough, perhaps, 'to i'~sure its&#xD;
being moderately pleasant,"' answered he.&#xD;
"Plans of the kind, however, ought to be car-&#xD;
ried out when they are perfectly fresh. To&#xD;
defer their execution is like waiting five min-&#xD;
utes to drink a glass of soda-water."&#xD;
"You ought.to be very glad that it was not&#xD;
carried out yesterday," said Norah. "Fancy&#xD;
having been caught without shelter in that&#xD;
storm of wind and rain l"&#xD;
"I am glad you waited till to-day on my&#xD;
account," said Mrs. Sandford. "I shall be so&#xD;
glad to see Strafford! I have heard so much&#xD;
of it from my cousins! And then there is&#xD;
Captain Tyndale. I shall really be very glad&#xD;
to see Aim, though Ithink 'he might have been&#xD;
civil enough to come over to Rosland and see&#xD;
me last night."&#xD;
~'IIe did not know that you 'were expee't-&#xD;
ed" said Leslie.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, that accounts for it, then "said she,&#xD;
with the air of one who accepts a satisfactory&#xD;
explanation. "He was at my house so eon-&#xD;
stsntl~~ before he left the city, and we made so&#xD;
many plans for seeing a great deal of each&#xD;
other down here, that I thought his absence&#xD;
very strange last night. It is certainly very&#xD;
pleasant," she added, with a laugh. "Do&#xD;
you know, Leslie, that it is town.tnlk in Alton&#xD;
that I am engaged to him?"&#xD;
"Is it, indeed?" said Leslie. "No, I&#xD;
should never have suspected such a thing."&#xD;
"I tell my friends that they are really&#xD;
quite absurd," said Mrs. Sandford, shrugging&#xD;
her shoulders. "They engage me 'to a new&#xD;
man every m6nth, though I have said again&#xD;
and again that I have not the faintest idea of&#xD;
marrying cmy~ody for at least five years to&#xD;
come! One can do as one pleases when one&#xD;
is a widow, which is considerably more than&#xD;
one can do as a wife; and, therefore, I find it&#xD;
a great deal pleasanter than having a jealous&#xD;
husband to worry one."&#xD;
"But husbands are not necessarily jeal-&#xD;
ous," suggested Carl.&#xD;
"Indeed, I don't trust any of them not to&#xD;
be," said she, and it was evident that she&#xD;
meant it; "I don't trust any of them not to&#xD;
be jealous of me! '~'&#xD;
"Of course I bow to your superior kuowi.&#xD;
edge," said he. "It is certainly based on a&#xD;
much more extended experience than I can&#xD;
boast."&#xD;
In such instructive and entertaining con-&#xD;
versation the drive passed. It was a greater&#xD;
distance to Strafford by the high~road than by&#xD;
the short cut across the fields whioh Arthur&#xD;
and Max chiefly affected, but before long they&#xD;
saw the tall chimneys and brown gables of the&#xD;
house showing through the green foliage of&#xD;
the park. The nooks and dells of the latter&#xD;
were full of more than usual beauty as the&#xD;
early sunlight slanted across the wet grass&#xD;
and through the mighty branches of the great&#xD;
oaks, throwing entrancing shadows on the&#xD;
turf. It was not oaks alone, however, which&#xD;
filled the park. There was scarcely one of&#xD;
the magnificent variety of Southern shade-&#xD;
trees which was not represented, with bosky&#xD;
depths of copse-like shrubbery intermixed.&#xD;
Every thing was as green und still as an&#xD;
enchanted forest, every thing was glitter-&#xD;
ing yet with the rain of the day be.foro,&#xD;
and every thing, even to the moss - grown&#xD;
palings, bore eloquent witness that this home&#xD;
&#xD;
of the Tyndales was not a place of yester-&#xD;
day~&#xD;
That it wasa beautiful place no one could&#xD;
deny. They all said so with one accord as&#xD;
they entered the wide gates mid drove to the&#xD;
front of the house, where Arthur and Max&#xD;
were standing in the shade of the stone por-&#xD;
tico waiting for them. When the carriage&#xD;
stopped, the former stepped forward, looking&#xD;
iwen more hands~ine and 'high-bred than usual.&#xD;
Perhaps it was the consciousness of standing&#xD;
on his own threshold which helped him to a&#xD;
new dignity and courtesy of manner. Cer-&#xD;
tainly it is a consciousness which cannot fail&#xD;
to have its effect upon any man who is not&#xD;
hopelessly parvenu in blood and sentiment.&#xD;
Next the door, which he opened, sat Mrs..&#xD;
Sandford and Leslie, who naturally descended&#xD;
first, and, while they were being assisted to&#xD;
the ground,  Torah said, in her quick, izape~&#xD;
rious way, to Carl:&#xD;
"Open the other door, and let me out. It&#xD;
is not necessary to wait on them, is it?"&#xD;
"Not in the least," he answered; and, im.&#xD;
mediately wrenching the door open, he sprang&#xD;
out and extended his hand to her.&#xD;
As she was about to take it, Tyndale spoke'&#xD;
quickly, having deposited Leslie on the ground,&#xD;
and turning his back on Mrs. Sandford, who&#xD;
was greeting Max with an enthusiastic ripple&#xD;
of words and laughter.&#xD;
"Take care, Miss Desmoud, there is a&#xD;
great deal of mud on that side. Let me as-&#xD;
sist you out here."&#xD;
But Norah had already given her hand to&#xD;
Carl, and, before he finished speaking, she&#xD;
was on the ground, with the slight .m~sadven-&#xD;
ture of brushing her dress against a muddy&#xD;
wheel, and stepping deep with one kid boot in&#xD;
the soft loam.&#xD;
"Look I" she said, holding out her foot t~&#xD;
Carl. "Is it not a pity?"&#xD;
"Let me 'take it off," said he, and, stoop-&#xD;
ing, he drew out an immaculate white.eambrie&#xD;
handkerchief for the purpose.&#xD;
"Don't be absurd, Sir Walter Raleigh,"&#xD;
said she, drawing back the foot with a laugh.&#xD;
"Mud is more appropriate to shoes than to&#xD;
handkerchiefs, if it must be on one ~r the&#xD;
other. It is a small penalty to ;pa~ for es-&#xD;
caping the necessity of having my baud&#xD;
touched by Aim I" she added, in a lower&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
After this they passed into the house,&#xD;
where Mrs. Sandford went into a rapture of&#xD;

A FISHING EXCURSION .&#xD;
&#xD;
76                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
admiration over the fine Qid hall, with it~&#xD;
carved oaken staircase, its paneled walls, its&#xD;
family portraits, and antlered stag - heads&#xD;
which had gazed serenely down for many a&#xD;
long day since that by-gone time when they&#xD;
had looked their last on the fair greenwood,&#xD;
with its dewy coverts, its tangled depths, and&#xD;
gleams of summer shade and sheen.&#xD;
They lingered for a little while in the&#xD;
pleasant, old - fashioned drawing - room - so&#xD;
lofty, spacious, and softly toned, that it did&#xD;
not look as if heat could ever invade it. On&#xD;
the green terrace without, deep, cool shadows&#xD;
were lying. It seemed impossible to imaging&#xD;
a scene more suggestive of repose.&#xD;
"One might almost forget that there was&#xD;
such a thing as time in a place like this 1"&#xD;
said Carl, following Norah, who, after a while,&#xD;
walked to the end of the room~to look at a&#xD;
statue. "There seems -a sort of dreamy&#xD;
stillness in the very atmosphere. I should&#xD;
call it- stagnation, but some people - Mr.&#xD;
Tennyson's lotos.eaters, for example-might&#xD;
like it extremely, I dare say."&#xD;
"It is more a melancholy than a dreamy&#xD;
stillness," answered she. "One feels that&#xD;
life has lohg been absent from these rooms.&#xD;
Do you know that I am enough of a barba-&#xD;
rian to prefer a new house to an old one?"&#xD;
sdded she, suddenly. "An old house al.&#xD;
ways seems to me peopled with ghosts. I&#xD;
am sure that lady, for example "-turning&#xD;
her back on the marble Psyche, and pointing&#xD;
to a faded beauty in the costume of fifty or&#xD;
sixty years before-" comes1down and walks&#xD;
the floor at night in her satifi and pearls."&#xD;
"You, don't mean that you believe~ in&#xD;
ghosts?"&#xD;
"One believes in what one has seen gen.&#xD;
orally. I saw a ghost once."&#xD;
"Indeed!" - laughing and arching his&#xD;
brows. "Pray when and where was it?"&#xD;
"Ask in a tone of faith, and perhaps I&#xD;
may tell you."&#xD;
"But I thought faith was to come after.&#xD;
ward "-he began, when at that moment Ar-&#xD;
*        thur Tyndale advanced down the room tow.&#xD;
ard them.&#xD;
"Leslie says that she thinks we had bet-&#xD;
ter go to the lake now," he said, address.&#xD;
ing Norah, with rather a deprecating look&#xD;
in his violet eyes. "That is - if you are&#xD;
ready." -&#xD;
"I am quite ready," she answered, with&#xD;
careless coldness. Then she turned to Carl.&#xD;
&#xD;
"If you will promise to be quite credulous, I&#xD;
will tell you all about it," she said.&#xD;
What the "it" was, Tyndale, of course,&#xD;
did not know; but he did know that she&#xD;
wished to show him in this way, as in every&#xD;
other, that his intercourse with her was to&#xD;
be restricted to the narrowest possible limits.&#xD;
Turning, she walked down the room with&#xD;
Middleton, and he had no alternative but to&#xD;
follow at some distance behind them.&#xD;
They found Leslie, Mrs. Sandford, and&#xD;
Max, waiting on the terrace outside-a ser-&#xD;
vant in attendance laden with fishing-gear.&#xD;
"If we are to go at all, I think we had better&#xD;
go at once," the former said; and so they set&#xD;
forth.&#xD;
Their way lay across the park, under its&#xD;
green shade, across its fresh, fragrant grass.&#xD;
The earth and air seemed asked clean by the&#xD;
late rain; the former exhaling a sweet, moist&#xD;
odor, the latter clear and bright as crystal,&#xD;
with a buoyancy in it different indeed from&#xD;
the sultry heat of the days that had gone be-&#xD;
fore. The air was full of soft, woodland&#xD;
sounds-a ringing echo of the rejoicing mirth&#xD;
of every bird and insect. The sky was the&#xD;
tenderest sapphire, crossed by a few fleecy&#xD;
clouds, and the distant, violet hills gtood out&#xD;
clearly, unrelieved by the faintest drapery of&#xD;
haze.&#xD;
Before long they came to the lake a&#xD;
transparent, winding sheet of water, on the&#xD;
farther side of which rose the slender stems&#xD;
of pines, with delicate, spear-like crests, out-&#xD;
lined like pencil tracery against the clear,&#xD;
blue heavens. On -the side where they stood&#xD;
were many nooks and inlets, shadowed over&#xD;
by drooping trees, and made more beautiful&#xD;
by the broad green leaves and pure white&#xD;
blossoms of the water-lily.&#xD;
"Is it not pretty?" said Leslie, turning&#xD;
to Norah. "Of course, it is only an artificial&#xD;
sheet of water, but it has been seventy years&#xD;
since it was made-has it not, Arthur ?-nnd&#xD;
so we may fairly suppose that- it has forgot.&#xD;
ten by this time that it is not quite uatn-&#xD;
ral."                      -&#xD;
"Nobody would ever suspect that it was&#xD;
artificial," said Norah, "It is very pretty&#xD;
indeed."' But in this as in every thing else,&#xD;
she seemed to avoid saying very much about&#xD;
the beauties of Strafford, thinking, perhaps,&#xD;
that from her lips such praise might sound&#xD;
like regret.&#xD;
Then each lady's line was arranged by&#xD;
&#xD;
her attendant cavalier, and, having estab-&#xD;
lished themselves-two-and-two-at different&#xD;
points along th~ shore, they proceeded to&#xD;
fish.&#xD;
As might reasonably and safely have been&#xD;
predicted, however, the fishing came to very&#xD;
little. Patience and silence are, as a general&#xD;
rule, two absolute requisites for success in this&#xD;
sport, and neither of these virtues is likely&#xD;
to be displayed in eminent degree by a pair&#xD;
of young people, i~ho, being more or less in&#xD;
love, or more or less inclined to flirt with&#xD;
each other, aresitting side by side in a green&#xD;
nook, with limpid water at their feet, a blue&#xD;
sky overhead, and the whole glory of a mid-&#xD;
summer day around. Max, ~ho was the best&#xD;
angler of the party, contrived to catch a fish&#xD;
or two, despite his companion's unceasing&#xD;
chatter but Norah was the only one of the&#xD;
feminine trio who had any success. Instead&#xD;
of displaying exultation, however, it must be&#xD;
recorded of her that she was sufficiently&#xD;
weak-minded to insist that Carl should throw&#xD;
the gasping trout back into its native ele-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"It is mine! I will do as I please with&#xD;
it I" she said, authoritatively, when he de-&#xD;
murred. "If you will not- throw it back, I&#xD;
can call Albert" (this was the servant) "to&#xD;
do it. I shall never again impale a poor&#xD;
creature upon a hook and draw it out of the&#xD;
water to die."&#xD;
So the trout was thrown back, to Albert's&#xD;
great disgust, and Miss Desmond pronounced&#xD;
her fishing over for the day. "It is too beau-&#xD;
tiful to do any thing more than be merely&#xD;
idle 1" she' said, 'leaning back against the&#xD;
great brown trunk of a water-oak, and tilting&#xD;
her hat over her brow, low enough to keep&#xD;
the sun out of her eyes, but not low enough&#xD;
to shut out a view of the level expanse of&#xD;
water, the curving shore, and the dark, sol-&#xD;
emn pines,' whence now and then the breeze&#xD;
brought whiffs of that spicy, aromatic odor&#xD;
familiar' to the nostrils of all those who have&#xD;
ever lived in a pine-region.&#xD;
After a while, however, she grew weary&#xD;
of quiescence, and, rising, sauntered away, re-&#xD;
fusing absolutely to allow Carl to accompany&#xD;
her, "Stay where you are, and catch my&#xD;
fish again~If you can," she-said, a little mock-&#xD;
ingly. "As for me, I am tired of society just&#xD;
now, and I want a little solitude."&#xD;
"Tired of your society," would have been&#xD;
the true rendition of that sentence, if poor&#xD;
&#xD;
Carl had only known it; but the 8tars will&#xD;
fall indeed when it begins - to enter the re--&#xD;
motest conception of a man in love that his so~&#xD;
ciety can possibly ever bore the woman with&#xD;
whom he is in love.&#xD;
So Miss Desmond wandered away into&#xD;
solitude, farther and farther from the group&#xD;
she had left behind, front the sound of Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford's theatrical little scream every time&#xD;
Captain Tyndale drew forth a fish, from Les-&#xD;
lie's pleasant, ringing laugh, from Arthur-&#xD;
talking to Oarl and Carl talking back to Ar-&#xD;
thur, each out of his own leafy covert-wan-&#xD;
dered aimlessly on and on, plucking absently&#xD;
at a water-lily which Carl had procured for&#xD;
her at the imminent risk of a plunge-bath..--&#xD;
thinking, meanwhile, thoughts neither very&#xD;
sweet nor very bitter, but simply grave, if it&#xD;
were possible to judge by the expression of&#xD;
her face. -&#xD;
After a while she came to a nook so pret-&#xD;
ty that it involuntarily tempted her to pause.&#xD;
The shore rounded just here into a mimic&#xD;
bay, the green turf sloped softly down to the&#xD;
water's edge, and, under the silvery branches&#xD;
of a willow that bent until it touched the lake,&#xD;
a little skiff was lying, with the oars across it.&#xD;
At this Norah looked, with desire in her eyes;&#xD;
but it had been many a long day since she&#xD;
l~iad handled an oar, and she had a great dis-&#xD;
like to trouble, added to a still greater dis~&#xD;
like of making herself ridiculous. "Better&#xD;
never do a thing at all than not do it well,"'&#xD;
was her motto-a motto which she faithfully&#xD;
observed, for she never did attempt to do any&#xD;
thing at all unless 'she was sure of being able-&#xD;
to do it well. Hence, in the present instance,&#xD;
she contented herself with sitting down on&#xD;
the grass and throwing a longing glance at&#xD;
the boat lying ~so restfully under the willow.&#xD;
She was almost sorry now that she had not&#xD;
allowed Carl to come with her-" except that&#xD;
I am so horribly tired of him," she said,&#xD;
aloud, throwing' a tiny pebble into the water&#xD;
with a plash.&#xD;
" So' horribly tired of whom?" asked a&#xD;
voice over her head; and then, as she start-&#xD;
ed and looked up, Max Tyndale added "I&#xD;
beg' pardon, Miss Desmond. should not&#xD;
have answered your remark, only the tempta-&#xD;
tion wtt~ great." -&#xD;
"The temptation to play eavesdropper?" -&#xD;
asked she, haughtily. "But, then, people-&#xD;
who soliloquize in the open air must expect&#xD;
eavesdroppers, I suppose. It seems to me,&#xD;

&#xD;
Captaitt Tyndale," she added, in a different&#xD;
tone, "thai you are always begging my par-&#xD;
don about something or other."&#xD;
"Yott mean, perhaps, that I am always&#xD;
doing something for which I need to beg your&#xD;
pardon.? "'&#xD;
"Perhaps that is it. For example, what&#xD;
are you doing here now? I came away to en-&#xD;
joy ssydelce far nisnte; and I did not imagine&#xD;
that th~ whole party would soon be following&#xD;
'I&#xD;
Sue.&#xD;
"Am I the whole party? It has really&#xD;
struck me that I am only one, and an insig-&#xD;
niflca~stmemhe!of it"&#xD;
"It ~.s easier to fancy that the whole party&#xD;
are cowing' than that you have come alone,&#xD;
unless, like myself~ you are in search of the&#xD;
twin reads, silence and solitude."&#xD;
"I am afraid that you are the only 9read&#xD;
whom I can honestly plead guilty of being in&#xD;
search of,"&#xD;
"And, may I ask, why are you in search&#xD;
of me?"&#xD;
"I answer in the words of Katharine to&#xD;
Petruehio,,' I am scat to bid you come in to&#xD;
dinner '----or rather to luncheon."&#xD;
"It is a pity to leave out any thing so ap-&#xD;
propriate as the first part of that sentence.&#xD;
Why arc you not honest enough to quote in&#xD;
full~ and say, 'Against my will, I am sent to&#xD;
bW yen come in to dinner?"'&#xD;
'~ ~imply because it was not against my&#xD;
wl~"ftuswered he. "I not only Insisted upon&#xD;
C9IISing, ~but I bore off the palm from Middle-&#xD;
teti, who was anxious to be sent on the same&#xD;
errand."'&#xD;
"Hose very tired you must have grown of&#xD;
Mi's. Sa.udford 12' said she; then, as he flushed,&#xD;
she laughed. "Confess that being bored was&#xD;
the secret of your anxiety to corae-if, in-&#xD;
deed, you were anxious."&#xD;
"Well, yes, I confess that was it," said&#xD;
hs, laughing in turn, but emulating her frank.&#xD;
ness with remarkable ease. "Mrs. Sandford&#xD;
is a very pleasant person, and one who dces&#xD;
rae the honor of professing to be a friend of&#xD;
mine; 'but still, a whole morning spent in&#xD;
her society is--.is-.---" Here he paused.&#xD;
"...-Is rather exhausting, I should think,"&#xD;
said Mis.s Desniond. "I found an hour of it&#xD;
a great deal too much for me last night."&#xD;
"Yet she speaks west enthusiastically of&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Does she? Tlrst in very good of her,&#xD;
especially since I em unable to return&#xD;
&#xD;
any of the compliments she way have paid&#xD;
me.~&#xD;
." I confess that I like, to hear a woman&#xD;
speak pleasantly of other women," said Cap-&#xD;
tain Tyndale He was leaning back against&#xD;
a tree, and looking meditatively at the charm-&#xD;
ing picture which the beautiful woman, be.&#xD;
fore him wade. "It shows amiability, at&#xD;
least."&#xD;
"Do you think so? Knowledge of wom-&#xD;
en is your special Ar~e, is it not, Captain&#xD;
Tyndale?"&#xD;
* "Very far fr-em it," answered he. "I sm&#xD;
old-fashioned enough to credit women with a&#xD;
great many wore virtues than they-than&#xD;
many of them, that is-seem to care to be&#xD;
credited with at present."&#xD;
"I don't \think any woman of sense likes'&#xD;
to be set up on a pedestal, with a label&#xD;
of conventional virtues attached," said she.&#xD;
"We are what God has wade us-a subtle&#xD;
mixture of good and bad, of sense and folly.&#xD;
But we are nothing if we are not sincere.&#xD;
Now, a woman like Mrs. Sand.ford, with only&#xD;
honey on her lips, is not sincere.~~&#xD;
"You mean, I suppose, that 'who dare&#xD;
not censure, scarce can praise?"'&#xD;
"I mean that praise which is given indis~&#xD;
criminately is worth nothing.-~--execpt to show&#xD;
the weakness or falsity of the speaker. You&#xD;
look shocked! See how you men are shocked&#xD;
if you hear a woman speak truth once in a&#xD;
way2'&#xD;
"I cannot think that it is truth, Miss Des-&#xD;
wend- I cannot believe that amiability al-&#xD;
ways means weakness or falsity."&#xD;
"And I never said or implied any thing&#xD;
of the kind. But you are one of the urea&#xD;
who will live and die worshiping an ideal, un-&#xD;
less, indeed, you have the misfortune to mar-&#xD;
ry it2'&#xD;
"And then?"&#xD;
"Oh, well, thenyon will find that gall is&#xD;
occasionally mixed with the honey."&#xD;
"Shall I?" said he, a little dreamily. It&#xD;
is likely that he was not thinking of Mrs.&#xD;
Sandferd, as he passed his hand half absently&#xD;
acroSs the red mark wbieh the straw hat in&#xD;
his hand had' left on his forehead. "But&#xD;
there are some women who have no gall in&#xD;
their nature," said he,&#xD;
"When you find such a woman, you may&#xD;
reasonably hope that a century hence her&#xD;
name will take its place in the calendar of the&#xD;
Church."          -&#xD;
&#xD;
"How can you be so incredulous of good&#xD;
in your own sex I" said he, almost sharply.&#xD;
"I am not ia~rcdulous of good, hut of&#xD;
perfection. Besides, you sh~uId remember&#xD;
that my experience of life has not been fa-&#xD;
vorable to seeing much of the qualities which&#xD;
you laud in my own sex~ Few women have&#xD;
honey on their lips for a beautiful Bohemian&#xD;
like myself. Such fr-lends as I have made in&#xD;
my life-and they are few enough, God knows!&#xD;
-have all been men."&#xD;
"All, Miss Desmond?"&#xD;
"All except the nuns of a convent in&#xD;
which I once spent a few months, and ac-&#xD;
quired all the education and all the religion&#xD;
that I possess."&#xD;
She spoke half defiantly, as if to say,&#xD;
"See and know the worst of me!" but Max'&#xD;
made no reply. He was not at all shocked-&#xD;
for few things are able to shock a. man who&#xD;
has seen much of the world-but he thought&#xD;
how. different this woman was from any wom-&#xD;
an whom he could possibly admire or love.&#xD;
Beautiful though she was-beautiful with a&#xD;
glory of flesh aud blood rarely equaled-her&#xD;
Bohemian defiance and recklessness con.&#xD;
damned her utterly in his eyes. Again he&#xD;
compared her with Leslie-thereby ignoring&#xD;
the different circumstances that had made the&#xD;
different women what they were - and tried&#xD;
to fancy that graceful embodiment of all wom-&#xD;
anly gentleness denying the good in her own&#xD;
sex, and openly proclaiming the fact that all&#xD;
her friends were men! While he was trying&#xD;
to do this, and failing utterly, Norab's voice&#xD;
roused him-a 'toice, with that tone of mock-&#xD;
ery in it, which, of all her tones, was most&#xD;
distasteful to his ear.&#xD;
"Now that I have thoroughly shocked&#xD;
you, Captain Tyndale, and showed you how&#xD;
entirely I belong t~ the life in which Iwas&#xD;
born and reared, I will let you go to luncheon.&#xD;
Don't trouble about we. I will come after&#xD;
a while when I feel like it. Just now, I don't&#xD;
feel like it in the least. 'I am comfortable&#xD;
and lazy.~~&#xD;
"So am I," said he, "and therefore, if&#xD;
you will be good enough to let use stay-"&#xD;
"Let you stay! But are you not hungry?&#xD;
Men always are hungry."&#xD;
"I don't think they always are-at least,&#xD;
tam sure 'that I am not, just at present."&#xD;
"I see that you are afraid of Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford," said sire. "Honey clogs after a time,&#xD;
even on the palates of' those who like it. But&#xD;
&#xD;
you may stay on one condition-.-.-that you will&#xD;
take rue out on the water in that charming&#xD;
little boat under the willow there."&#xD;
"I will take you with pleasure, if you&#xD;
care to go, but are you not afraid of the sun?&#xD;
Arthur decided not to propose boating until&#xD;
this afternoon."&#xD;
"The sun can do nothing but tan me a&#xD;
littIe~ and that I am not afraid of'. But, if&#xD;
you object to the exertion-.--"&#xD;
"I object to the exertion? I'll have the&#xD;
boat out in a minute, and take you round the&#xD;
lake, if you care to go."&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
"The day so mild&#xD;
Is Heaven's own child,&#xD;
With Eartlrpnd Ocean reconciled;&#xD;
The airs I feel&#xD;
Around me steal&#xD;
Are murmuring to the murmuring keel.&#xD;
"Over the rail&#xD;
My hand I trail&#xD;

Ajoy Intense,&#xD;
The cooling sense&#xD;

"An, how delightful! "said Norab. "Could&#xD;
any thing possibly be more pleasant?"&#xD;
It was the first genuine expression of&#xD;
pleasure which she had uttered at Strafford,&#xD;
and seemed drawn from her involuntarily, as&#xD;
she found herself floating on the still bosom&#xD;
of the lake, with the golden noonday lying&#xD;
all around her, and a breeze, which had just&#xD;
then sprung up, bringing spicy wafts of pine.&#xD;
land fragrance over them.&#xD;
"It is pleasant," said Max-." pleasanter&#xD;
then I thought it would be! If we coast along&#xD;
in the shade, we shall not suffer from heat at&#xD;
all, and we can go to the bead of the lake if&#xD;
you like."&#xD;
"If I like!" repeated she. "If you leave&#xD;
the question of how far we shall go to we, I&#xD;
warn you that I shall be likely to have no&#xD;
mercy on your arms. I can imagine nothing&#xD;
more delightful than the lulling charm of this&#xD;
gliding motion."&#xD;
"You ~poke of doles far rriente a little&#xD;
while ago," said he, pullin~ along with the&#xD;
easy skill ofa practiced. oarsman. "This is'&#xD;

A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.                                            A MANY-SIDED CHARACTER.              81&#xD;

than to lie on the grass under the shadow&#xD;
of a tree."&#xD;
"So I think; and yet you did not want to&#xD;
come!',&#xD;
"Pardon me-I only wanted to warn* you&#xD;
that you would be likely to find the sun very&#xD;
warm."&#xD;
"I am not afraid of the sun. I have&#xD;
lived mostof my life in the south of Europe,&#xD;
where people love and enjoy it."&#xD;
"But where they also understand how&#xD;
and when to keep out of it. For stillness&#xD;
and repose, commend me to a high-noon in&#xD;
Italy or Spain."&#xD;
"And yet how you see the fishermen and&#xD;
lazzaroni basking ia that very high-noon! I&#xD;
have seen it often, and wished that I were&#xD;
one of them."&#xD;
"What a lucky thing that our wishes are&#xD;
not always gratified, isn't it?"&#xD;
"I am not sure of that. With regard to&#xD;
my wish, for instance, I envied the lazzaroni,&#xD;
because they are so entirely contented with&#xD;
life, and all that life has given them. I know&#xD;
no other class of people who are half so well&#xD;
satisfied. I have never, to my knowledge,&#xD;
envied a duke or duchess, but I have often&#xD;
envied the beggar curled up in a palace door-&#xD;
way. We Bohemians are next to them in&#xD;
devil-may-care recklessness, and indifference&#xD;
to all save the passing hour; but we lack the&#xD;
sublime philosophy and trust of our poor re-&#xD;
lation on a Neapolitan door-step."&#xD;
"Your poor relation may have a sublime&#xD;
trust, but he has also a keen eye to the chance&#xD;
of a penny.~~&#xD;
"So have we - a keen eye to whatever&#xD;
may advantage us, a keen sense of all the lib-&#xD;
e~ty, pleasure, and respect, that flows from&#xD;
money. I know, for instance, exactly how&#xD;
much it would take to live like a gs-and~e dame&#xD;
in Paris; and I confess I should like as well&#xD;
to try the experiment as our poor relation&#xD;
likes macaroni on a fete day."&#xD;
"I should think your life in Paris would&#xD;
not be difficult to compass," said he, looking&#xD;
at the beautiful face before him. "Women,&#xD;
with fewer advantages than yours, have often&#xD;
made brilliant marriages."&#xD;
"Women, with less beauty and less clev-&#xD;
erness, perhaps ±ou mean," answered he,&#xD;
coolly. "Those are trump cards, and sure to&#xD;
win when one's position in life s~port~them&#xD;
-otherwise they only secure for tlt~ir pos-&#xD;
sessor attention and admiration little removed&#xD;
&#xD;
from insult. The beauty and wit of a vagrant&#xD;
are of small account in the respectable world,&#xD;
Captain Tyndale. I learned that by the time&#xD;
I was fifteen."&#xD;
"You seem to have learned a great many&#xD;
hard lessons for one so young."&#xD;
"A street Arab generally learns a little&#xD;
more of life than a mother's darling in his&#xD;
nursery at home."&#xD;
"And you-?"&#xD;
"I have been one of the Arabs of civiliza-&#xD;
tion ever since I was born. You would laugh&#xD;
if you knew how strange the life in which I&#xD;
find myself here seems to me. Its ease, its&#xD;
luxury, its comfort, are literally incredible.&#xD;
I find myself expecting all the time some jar&#xD;
of the wheels, some proof of sordid care, of&#xD;
debt and trouble and want of money, behind&#xD;
the scenes."&#xD;
"What a life you must have lived!"&#xD;
"And yet it has been a freer and happier&#xD;
one than many you would hold enviable by&#xD;
the side of it. We know how to enjoy our.&#xD;
selves iii Bohemia; in the worst weather we&#xD;
know how to keep. 'on the windy side of&#xD;
care;' and, when we do have any money, we&#xD;
know how to spend it royally!" -&#xD;
"I am aware of that," said lie, laughing.&#xD;
"And, although I have sometimes felt as&#xD;
if I would give any thing to hold some definite&#xD;
position in lire," said she, trailing Carl's lily&#xD;
slowly through the water," as if I would like&#xD;
to stand no longer in an attitude of defiance&#xD;
to society, yet I know that I could not endure&#xD;
the bondage and stagnation of ordinary re-&#xD;
spectable existence-of your ideal woman's&#xD;
existence, for example - for an hour! I&#xD;
should pine as the lion which Girard brought&#xD;
from the desert, pined in his cage, in the Jar.&#xD;
din des Plantes."&#xD;
"Then you mean to live and die a Bohe-&#xD;
mian?"&#xD;
"I mean to do nothing save take life as it&#xD;
comes-as I am taking it to-day. Look up&#xD;
at that sky, Captain Tyndale-it is beautiful&#xD;
enough for Italy! And see how the green&#xD;
boughs go across it! Ah, i~s something to&#xD;
be alive on such a day as this-just to be&#xD;
alive! One need not wish or ask for any&#xD;
thing more!',&#xD;
She threw her head back and looked up-&#xD;
ward, the flickering shadows falling lovingly&#xD;
across the white arch of her throat and the&#xD;
rounded outlines of her form. The attitude&#xD;
was as free from affectation or self-conscious.&#xD;
&#xD;
ness as that of a child, and yet graceful as&#xD;
that of the most thoroughly-trained actress.&#xD;
She seemed reveling, as she had said, in the&#xD;
simple ~ensuousness of existence-a nature&#xD;
full of vitality and keenly alive to beauty,&#xD;
thrilling with the full pulse of life, ~&#xD;
steeped to the lips in the golden charm&#xD;
the summer day. Max looked at her criti-&#xD;
cally. After all, he could not wonder that&#xD;
Arthur had loved this woman with a passion&#xD;
greater than any which he had given to Les-&#xD;
lie Grahame. She was eminently the kind of&#xD;
woman to fascinate a man of Arthur's stamp,&#xD;
Captain Tyndale decided - a woman with&#xD;
moods like a chameleon, a woman who could&#xD;
be simple as a child one moment, and impe-&#xD;
rious as a queen the next-yet who might,&#xD;
perhaps, fascinate even while she puzzled,&#xD;
annoyed, and repulsed. "But it would fare ill&#xD;
with any man who tied his heart-strings to he~-&#xD;
rudder!" he thought, going back in imagi-&#xD;
nation to that "serpent of old Nile" whose&#xD;
infinite variety age could not wither nor cus-&#xD;
tom stale. In truth, even Captain Tyndale's&#xD;
cool judgment began to find itself a little at&#xD;
fault with this "beautiful Bohemian," us she&#xD;
called herself. She had already shown him&#xD;
so many different sides of her character, that&#xD;
he began to wonder which was the real one-&#xD;
or if, indeed, there were a real one! As fast&#xD;
as he felt an inclination to like or admire her,&#xD;
she shocked and disconcerted him; as soon&#xD;
as he detected a trace of womanly gentleness,&#xD;
it turned into haut~ar or mockery. "What&#xD;
the deuce am I to do?" thought be, medi-&#xD;
tatively.&#xD;
It may be imagined, perhaps, that there&#xD;
was no very incumbent necessity upon him&#xD;
to do any thing, as far as Miss Pesmond and&#xD;
her peculiarities of manner and character&#xD;
were concerned; but the "martial diplo-&#xD;
mate," as she called him, thought otherwise.&#xD;
He could not forget that he had solemnly&#xD;
promised to obtain, if possible, some assur-&#xD;
ance of what she meant to do, and he could&#xD;
not forget, either, that this assurance was as&#xD;
yet entirely unobtained. In the morning&#xD;
Arthur had reminded him of this fact. "You&#xD;
will have an opportunity to see Norah alone&#xD;
to-day, Max," he said. "For Heaven's sake,&#xD;
try and draw something definite from her!"&#xD;
iThw, with Mrs. Sandford and Carl Middleton&#xD;
in the background, Max knew perfectly well&#xD;
that the present was the only opportunity&#xD;
for seeing Norah alone, and therefore he was&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
naturally anxious to make the most of it, and&#xD;
open his important negotiation at once. But&#xD;
how to do it? That was the question.&#xD;
It was a question which dwelt on his&#xD;
mind not a little, as he rowed along in the&#xD;
perfect stillness of the noonday, under the&#xD;
drooping shadow of the trees that lined the&#xD;
shore, past the tiny, curving bays and inlets,&#xD;
and finally around a point which opened to&#xD;
them a different part of the lake altogether-&#xD;
a part more beautiful than any they had seen&#xD;
before, Norah thought, as she looked at the&#xD;
crystal water stretching away, until it seemed&#xD;
to vanish in the depths of a green, shadowy&#xD;
forest which fringed it at the upper end, such&#xD;
a forest as those who have never seen South-&#xD;
ern forest-growth, especially in the vicinity&#xD;
of water, cannot even imagine. -&#xD;
"The tropics must be like this, I ima-&#xD;
gine l" said she, pointing to the broad-leaved&#xD;
water-plants around, and the indescribable&#xD;
blending of color in the foliage and under-&#xD;
growth beyond. "How much more beauti-&#xD;
ful than the park, for we are past the park&#xD;
now, are we not?"&#xD;
"Entirely past it"&#xD;
"And does tizis"-iadicating with a mo-&#xD;
tion of her hand the magnificent verdure be-&#xD;
fore them-" does tide belong to Arthur Tyn-&#xD;
dale, also?"&#xD;
"Every rod of ground around us belongs&#xD;
to him."&#xD;
"I am sorry!" said she. "Oh, not ~orry&#xD;
that he is rich!" she added, quickly, as she&#xD;
met Max's glance. "That is not a matter of&#xD;
the least importance. I only meant that I&#xD;
am sorry there is no breathing-place for me&#xD;
even in those beautiful woods, for I cannot&#xD;
breathe freely on Arthur Tyndale's ground."&#xD;
"Do you hate him so much, Miss Des-&#xD;
mond?"&#xD;
"Hate him!" She turned her full, brill-&#xD;
iant glance on him. "No, Captain Tyndale,&#xD;
I do not 'hate him' in the icast."&#xD;
"Why, then-" he began, but seemed to&#xD;
think better of the question, and paused.&#xD;
She finished it for him with the impetu-&#xD;
osity to which he had by this time become a&#xD;
little accustomed.&#xD;
"Why, then, do I feel that I cannot breathe&#xD;
in his house or on his lafids? Simply because&#xD;
I scorn the man, with a scorn which I cannot&#xD;
express to you, and because I scorn myself&#xD;
not a little for being here to-day, for playing,&#xD;
or seeming to play, a part which degrades me!"&#xD;

82                       A DAUGHTER&#xD;
Max saw his oppoTtunity and seized it at&#xD;
once-despite the quick passion that lit up&#xD;
her mobile features at the last words.&#xD;
"Will you allow me to ask why you do&#xD;
play it, then?" he said.&#xD;
"Because I choose to do so," she an-&#xD;
swered, curtly.&#xD;
After this there was naturally nothing&#xD;
more to be said. Captain Tyndale devoted&#xD;
himself in silence to his oars; Miss Desmond&#xD;
still trailed Carl's lily through the ~ater, and&#xD;
was silent also. They had proceeded some&#xD;
distance, and were floating rather than row-&#xD;
ing past a shore along which tangled vines,&#xD;
with starry leaves and brilliant crimson flow-&#xD;
ers, were running i~i many trailing loops and&#xD;
graceful festoons, when Norah spoke again&#xD;
-abruptly:&#xD;
"That was ver.j rude-that last speech&#xD;
of mine! I might have told you civilly, at&#xD;
least, that I choose to keep my affairs to my-&#xD;
self~ might I not?"&#xD;
"I have no right to quarrel with the in-&#xD;
civility of your reply, Miss Desmond; my&#xD;
question drew it on myself."&#xD;
"You always contrive to blame yourself,&#xD;
Captain Tyndale. Are you very amiable or&#xD;
very hypocritical?"&#xD;
"Neither, I think-I never take blame to&#xD;
myself when I do not honestly believe that I&#xD;
deserve it."&#xD;
She laughed; and, throwing the lily care-&#xD;
IessI~' away, plunged her white, gleaming&#xD;
hand into the water instead.&#xD;
"How pleasant. I" she said. "Who would&#xD;
not be a naiad, if she could!" Then,&#xD;
abruptly: "But you have taken blame to&#xD;
yourself once or twice when it wss 1 who de-&#xD;
served it."&#xD;
"Was it? I think you must be mistaken.&#xD;
I am not enough of a preux chevalier to be&#xD;
ever gallant for the mere sake of gallantry."&#xD;
"You puzzle me a little," said she, look-&#xD;
ing at him with inquisitive eyes. "I never&#xD;
met a man exactly like you before-and that&#xD;
is something unusual in my experience. Most&#xD;
men are alike on all general points."&#xD;
"In what particular have I struck you as&#xD;
unlike other men?" asked he, looking in-&#xD;
tently at the beautiful face, on which the.&#xD;
broad light of noonday fell, showing every&#xD;
delicate tint and perfect curve.&#xD;
"Well, for one thing," said she, candidly,&#xD;
"most men lose their heads in talking to me.&#xD;
You have not done so."&#xD;
&#xD;
OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I prefer to keep my head under all cir-&#xD;
cumstances," said he, coolly. "It is more&#xD;
convenient. Men who lose their heads lose&#xD;
every advantage that skill or chance can give&#xD;
them. I prefer to take all of mine."&#xD;
"Soshouldl; ifiwereaman!"&#xD;
"And, although you ar~ a very beautiful&#xD;
woman, Miss Desmond, you are' not a wom-&#xD;
an-"&#xD;
"Finish your sentence," said she, quietly,&#xD;
as he paused. "Say that I am not a woman&#xD;
whom you admire.~~&#xD;
"You credit me with more impertinence&#xD;
and less taste than I deserve," answered he.&#xD;
"Should I have been likely to have remem-&#xD;
bered your face, as I saw it in Paris two years&#xD;
ago, if I had not admired it? No; if I had&#xD;
finished my sentence, I should have said that&#xD;
you are not a woman whom a wise man would&#xD;
allow to deprive him of his head or of his&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
"Wise men sometimes do very foolish&#xD;
~things," said she, looking at her hand as it&#xD;
lay idly under the water. "They sometimes&#xD;
put their heads and their hearts into the&#xD;
hands of a fool, and that is worse than put-&#xD;
ting them into the hands of-you may char-&#xD;
acterize me, if you choose, Captain Tyn-&#xD;
dale."&#xD;
"Shall I say, then-of a beautiful woman&#xD;
who is trying to believe that she has no&#xD;
heart?" A&#xD;
"You a~i~perti~ent!" said she, sud-&#xD;
denly turning h~r face round, and flashing an&#xD;
eloquent glance of anger upon him.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon. I see that one is&#xD;
never safe, under any circumstances, in tnk-&#xD;
ing a woman at her word."&#xD;
"You might have called me a Bohemian&#xD;
adventuress, or a fast flirt, and I should not&#xD;
have cared."&#xD;
"As far as I can venture to judge, how-&#xD;
ever, you are neither of those things."&#xD;
"But to say that I-lam 'trying to be-&#xD;
lieve' that I have no heart!"&#xD;
"It would have been wiser not to say it,&#xD;
perhaps."&#xD;
"What should I do with a heart, if I had&#xD;
it?" asked she, with a low, scornful laugh.&#xD;
"Let another man amuse himself with it as&#xD;
long as he likes, and then throw it away to&#xD;
harden or break as it pleases ? ~'&#xD;
"Before you could ask such a question,&#xD;
Miss Desmond, you must have forgotten that&#xD;
there are men of honor in the World."&#xD;
&#xD;
EXPLANATORY CONVERSATION~&#xD;
&#xD;
"Men of honor to women of assured&#xD;
position in life, very likely," said she, dryly.&#xD;
"Men who would hold themselves bound&#xD;
by their plighted word if it were given to one&#xD;
of the lazzaroni of whom you spoke a little&#xD;
while ago," said he, almost sternly.&#xD;
She shrugged her shoulders.&#xD;
"We need not discuss the subject. You&#xD;
believe in the general honeyed nature of&#xD;
women - Bohemian women excepted - from&#xD;
your experience. I believe in the general lax&#xD;
ideas of honor in men from my experience.&#xD;
We all look at the world from a one-sided&#xD;
point of view. It is a thing which cannot be&#xD;
helped, I suppose."&#xD;
"In our cynical moments most of us are&#xD;
apt to look very gloomily on human nature,?'&#xD;
said he; "but sometimes human nature&#xD;
pro~1es itself better than we expected-more&#xD;
generous, more faithful, more worthy of trust.&#xD;
Miss Desmond, that is a riddle. Will you&#xD;
read it?"&#xD;
"I never read a riddle in my life, Captain&#xD;
Tyndale."&#xD;
"Then, in plain words," said he, quickly,&#xD;
"I should like to think that you will prove&#xD;
more generous than any one-than Arthur&#xD;
Tyndale, least of all-has a right to expect&#xD;
that you will be!"&#xD;
"Ah~ said she, looking at him with a&#xD;
sudden keen glance, "you have taken u~&#xD;
your r6le of devil's advocate again, have you?&#xD;
By-the-by, this reminds me thatr when we&#xD;
were interrupted yesterday afternoon, you&#xD;
were about to tell me what was your motive&#xD;
for espousing your cousins cause and giving&#xD;
him the invaluable aid of your diplomatic&#xD;
talent. We are not likely to be interrupted&#xD;
here, so you can tell me now."&#xD;
"I have no objection to doing so," said&#xD;
he. "My motive for desiring to serve Ar-&#xD;
thur is partly on account of my friendship ?or&#xD;
him, but more particularly and principally on&#xD;
account of your sister."&#xD;
"On account ~f my sister!"&#xD;
"Yes," said he, steadily, although he felt&#xD;
with vexation that the keen eyes bent upon&#xD;
him were noting a sudden flush which showed&#xD;
itself through his bronzed skin. "I saw long&#xD;
age-I mean months ago-that her happiness&#xD;
is wholly bound up in Arthur, and that, if her&#xD;
trust in him is once broken, it-~it will be a&#xD;
terrible blow to her."&#xD;
Captain Tyndale felt that he had fallen&#xD;
into the depths of abject commonplace in&#xD;
&#xD;
this speech; but he would have been a brave&#xD;
man and a fluent man who could have held&#xD;
his thoughts and his tongue under propercon-&#xD;
trol with the lustrous challenge of Norali Des-&#xD;
mond's glance bent upon him. Max felt his&#xD;
ideas and his words alike forsaking him when&#xD;
he suddenly remembered that the "terrible&#xD;
blow" which he deprecated for Leslie had al-&#xD;
ready fallen on her.&#xD;
"So you think that Leslie's happiness is&#xD;
'bound up' in Mr. Tyndale 1" she said, as he&#xD;
paused-an incisive coolness in her voice&#xD;
striking unpleasantly on his ear. "I should&#xD;
have given her credit for being more of a&#xD;
woman of the world, and looking at things&#xD;
from a more worldly and philosophical point&#xD;
of view."&#xD;
"Then you must pardon me if I say that&#xD;
you understand her very little," said he, bend-&#xD;
ing with sudden energy to his oars.&#xD;
"I have imagined that her engagement to&#xD;
Mr. Tyndale is much such'an engagement as&#xD;
is often made in society-convenience amply&#xD;
consulted on both sides," she added, 'after a&#xD;
short pause.&#xD;
"It is impossible, Miss Desmond!" he&#xD;
said, indignantly. "You could not have&#xD;
known your sister for an hour, and done her&#xD;
*so much injustice."&#xD;
"Injustice! Is that injustice? I know&#xD;
so little of your world that you must for-&#xD;
give* me. I really thought it was high&#xD;
praise."&#xD;
"You arc m6cking both her and me," he&#xD;
said, after a minute. "Since I have brought&#xD;
it on myself, I suppose~ I have no right to com-&#xD;
plain; but, if you will allow me to apologize&#xD;
for having opened the subject, I can safely&#xD;
promise never to do so again. My r6le of ad-&#xD;
vocate is over."&#xD;
"Is it?" said she, quietly-..-the mocking&#xD;
light vanishing from her eyes, the mocking&#xD;
tone from her voice. "I am glad to hear it,&#xD;
Captain Tyndale, for it is not a r6le that be-&#xD;
fits an honest man. As far as Leslie is con-&#xD;
cerned, however, you are right. She is as&#xD;
diftbrent from me as day is from night-so&#xD;
different that, if we lived together for fifty&#xD;
years, we should be no nearer any real sym-&#xD;
pathy for each other than we are to-day-but&#xD;
I see and recognize all the sweetness ftnd&#xD;
strength that make up her character. I see&#xD;
that she is engaged to Arthur Tyndale simply&#xD;
because she loves him; and I, who came here&#xD;

"Why is a socialist's heart hard against&#xD;

than I, not to desire to make her feel a little&#xD;
of the bitterness which fihlcd my heart."&#xD;
"And so it was~that you came?"&#xD;
"Yes, so it was that I came-came pre-&#xD;
pared for any amount of patronage and con-&#xD;
descension, but not for one iota of the affec-&#xD;
tion and kindness which met me in her honest&#xD;
eyes."&#xD;
"And for her sake-for her sake alone,&#xD;
Miss Desmond-can you not spare Arthur&#xD;
Tyndale the exposure which I freely own he&#xD;
deserves?"&#xD;
"Even for her sake~ Captain Tyndale,&#xD;
would you advise mc to do so?"&#xD;
"Why should I not advise you to do&#xD;
so?"&#xD;
"Simply because you might put yourself&#xD;
in Leslie's place, and see whether you would&#xD;
thank the mistaken kindness which sent you&#xD;
through life holding a lie for truth, dishonor&#xD;
for honor, a coward for a brave man I"&#xD;
"But you do not look at the matter as I&#xD;
do," said he, earnestly. . "A4hur Tyndale is&#xD;
no worse than many other men who go&#xD;
through life safe in the loving esteem of faith-&#xD;
ful hearts.' He has fallen into dishonor more&#xD;
through weakness than intent. But this dis-&#xD;
honor does not touch his loyalty to your sis-&#xD;
ter. I~e loves her unquestionably. You&#xD;
think, perhaps "-as her lip curled-" that&#xD;
this is a consideration of little importance.&#xD;
lInt it is of great importance if we look at the&#xD;
matter as it regards her, and we are looking&#xD;
at it simply as it regards her, are we not?&#xD;
Hence we cannot afford to ignore the fact that&#xD;
Arthur's dishonoxi, as I said before, has not&#xD;
affected his loyalty to her. For the rest, I I&#xD;
&#xD;
am sure that you do not need for me to tell&#xD;
you that she loves him. Neither can you&#xD;
need for me to tell you what it would be to&#xD;
her to discover the position which lie holds&#xD;
to you. You see in all this," said he, break-&#xD;
ing off abruptly, "I am taking for granted&#xD;
that you have no feeling of-of the sort that&#xD;
some women would have, left for him."&#xD;
"I have no idea what sort of feeling some&#xD;
women would have left for him," said she,&#xD;
carelessly, "but I have none save contempt.&#xD;
If it were possible to cut away with a sharp&#xD;
knife and at any expense qf pain all that part&#xD;
of my life into which he entered, I would do&#xD;
it-simply that I might not include myself ia&#xD;
this contempt. Beyond that, I have no feel-&#xD;
ing of any kind for your cousin, Captain Tya-&#xD;
dale."&#xD;
"You can realize, however, that, to your&#xD;
sister, such contemptuous renunciation of&#xD;
what was once love, might not be so easy.&#xD;
11cr pride would hold her aloof from him, but&#xD;
I scarcely think that her scorn would enable&#xD;
her to fling all need of him out of her life as&#xD;
you have done."&#xD;
"Would it not?" said Norah.&#xD;
Again she turned a quick, intent glance&#xD;
on the speaker.&#xD;
"I am inclined to disagree with you," she&#xD;
added, after a minute. "I think that if an-&#xD;
other man-more worthy, and loving her as&#xD;
well, perhaps better than Arthur Tyndale-&#xD;
came into her life, she would soon learn to&#xD;
love 1dm."&#xD;
"I am presumptuous enough to say that&#xD;
I think you are mistaken. I am sure that&#xD;
Miss Grahame is one of those women who are&#xD;
faithful by a divine instinct of Nature-faith-&#xD;
ful often to unworthy objects and in their&#xD;
own despite. Therefore it might be better&#xD;
fo,~ her to go through life 'holding a lie for&#xD;
truth' than to be overtaken by utter ship-&#xD;
wreck at its very beginning."&#xD;
"Certainly in the former case she would&#xD;
not fare worse than other women have before&#xD;
her," said Norah, cynically. "Was Satan&#xD;
right, after all, I wonder? Ia it 'folly to tell&#xD;
women truth?' Would they 'rather live on&#xD;
lies, so they be sweet?' One might think so&#xD;
from the universal practice of men. But, for&#xD;
mc "-she turned on him with a sudden, pas-&#xD;
sionate energy for which he was unprepared&#xD;
-" I would rather a thousand-fold be miser-&#xD;
able than deceived! Let any fool's paradise&#xD;
into which I have entered be shattered forev-&#xD;
&#xD;
er, so that the clear light of truth comes&#xD;
in!"&#xD;
"Still, can you not see that there may be&#xD;
eases-"&#xD;
"Yes, I can see that there may be cases&#xD;
in which your conventional ideal woman&#xD;
would rather be left to worship her clay idol&#xD;
in ignorance. But, despite your opinion' of&#xD;
Leslie, I think there may be better stuff in&#xD;
her than that, She may be brave enough to&#xD;
face the truth, and, if so, Captain Tyndale,&#xD;
on myhonor as a Christian woman, she shall&#xD;
have it! The choice shall rest with her-&#xD;
self, however, I promise you that; and here&#xD;
is my hand upon it!"&#xD;
With a sudden, graceful motion, she drew&#xD;
her hand, nil wet and gleaming, from the wa-&#xD;
ter, and held it out to him. Dripping though&#xD;
it was, the man would have been made of&#xD;
strange material who hesitated to take it;&#xD;
and, as Max bent forward to do so, he thought&#xD;
that the first sweet smile he had ever seen on&#xD;
the lovely lips before him was faintly curving&#xD;
them just then.&#xD;
"Thu are more generous than I ventured&#xD;
to hope," he said. "But promise me that in&#xD;
any case you will incline more to mercy than&#xD;
to justice."&#xD;
"I think you ought to be content with&#xD;
what you have gained, Mr. Devil's Advocate,".&#xD;
answered she, with the smile deepening a lit-&#xD;
tle. "I cannot make any rash promises, even&#xD;
though the hand on which ~t would be rati-&#xD;
fied is rather slippery!"&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
"How many years since she and I&#xD;
Walked that old terrace, hand-in-hand!&#xD;
Just one star in the rosy sky,&#xD;
And silence on the summer land.&#xD;
And she?...&#xD;
I think I hear her sing&#xD;
That song-the last of all our songs.&#xD;
How all comes back! thing after thing,&#xD;
The old life o'er me throngs 1"&#xD;
"I noN'T know what anybody else may&#xD;
think," said Mrs. Sandford, "but I call such&#xD;
conduct very fast, indeed!"&#xD;
The irately virtuous tone of this remark&#xD;
would have suited the chiefest of social Phari-&#xD;
sees, instead of a lady famous for willful dis-&#xD;
regard of all the laws and canons of proprie-&#xD;
ty; but, when we are angry, very few of us are&#xD;
strikingly consistent or logical, and Mrs. Sand.&#xD;
ford was as angry just then as a pretty wom-&#xD;
&#xD;
an who is fond of admiration ever becomes&#xD;
in the presence of a man to whom' she is not&#xD;
related.&#xD;
"I don't know exactly what constitutes&#xD;
fast conduct in a Chasseur d'Afrique," said&#xD;
Carl, who was lying at full length o~i the&#xD;
grass by her side, "but I think 'it is amazing-&#xD;
ly inconsiderate conduct in your friend Cap-&#xD;
tain Max,"&#xD;
"You may be sure it is not Captain Tyz-&#xD;
dale's fault !-" said she, with marked emphasis&#xD;
on that gentleman~ s name. "He is not so&#xD;
great an admirer of Miss Desmond's that he&#xD;
would be likely to go off of ida own accord&#xD;
and spend the whole day in her company."&#xD;
"Whose accord 'could he have gone of,&#xD;
then, I wonder?" said Carl. "Certainly not&#xD;
on mine, for, as you may remember, I was&#xD;
quite as anxious to go in search of her as he&#xD;
was."&#xD;
"I did not observe that he was anxious at&#xD;
all."&#xD;
"Didn't you? 'You must have been very&#xD;
busy just then counting all the fish you had&#xD;
caught."&#xD;
"He does not admire Miss Desmond in&#xD;
the least" (returning to that point with a&#xD;
positive and somewhat triumphant air). "He&#xD;
would scarcely acknowledge that she was&#xD;
beautiful when I asked him if he thought so,&#xD;
and, therefore, it is impossible that he' is in&#xD;
fault for all this long absence."&#xD;
"No man with any worldly knowledge, or&#xD;
with tact above a grasshopp9r, ever tells one&#xD;
woman that another woman is beautiful,"&#xD;
said Middleton, placidly; "but, if Tyndale is&#xD;
not in fault for all this long absence, it natu-&#xD;
rally follows that Miss Desmond must be.&#xD;
Yet I don't think she has any particular fancy&#xD;
for Aim."&#xD;
"Miss Desmond is the sort of woman who"&#xD;
has a fancy for the society of any man. Is is&#xD;
only that of women which she dislikes."&#xD;
"I am not sure that you are wrong there,"&#xD;
said he, laughing. "She may not fancy the&#xD;
society of any man-to alter your emphasis a&#xD;
little-but I think that, as a general rule, she&#xD;
prefers men to women.~~&#xD;
"Those Bohemian adventuresses always&#xD;
do," said the pretty widow, provoked, until she&#xD;
scarcely knew what she was saying. "They&#xD;
know that women can see through them I"&#xD;
"And they probably know,' also, how much&#xD;
amiability and kind judgment they can expect&#xD;
from women!" said Carl, with a flash, net of&#xD;

86                 A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.                                               CARL IN A JEALOUS HUMOR.               87&#xD;
&#xD;
laughter, in his eyes) while his brow knitted&#xD;
into its quick frown.&#xD;
"No woman was ever more disposed fo~&#xD;
kind judgment than I am," said Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford, quickly-conscious, perhaps, that she&#xD;
ha4 gone a little too far. "I am foolishly, ab-&#xD;
snrdly lenient in my opinions, but, when every-&#xD;
body who knows any thing about the family,&#xD;
knows what Miss Desmond's rearing has been,&#xD;
she ought really, out of consideration for&#xD;
herself; to be more careful in her conduct."&#xD;
"I think I shall go in search of her," said&#xD;
Carl, rising lazily to his feet, and leaving a&#xD;
crushed outline of himself on the grass.&#xD;
"This becomes interesting and mysterious.&#xD;
One, two, three hours since Tyndale disap-&#xD;
peared, and no sign of either of them yet.&#xD;
If there were panthers in this wood, one&#xD;
would know what to think; but, as it is, I'll&#xD;
give Miss Desmond your hint, Mrs. Sandford,&#xD;
for which, no doubt, she will be properly&#xD;
grateful, and send Tyndale as soon as I find&#xD;
him."&#xD;
With this cavalier adieu, he sauntered&#xD;
away, leaving Mrs. Sandford-a desperate&#xD;
being in ~cris linen~ and blue ribbons-alone&#xD;
on the margin of the lake. She did not throw&#xD;
herself in, however, but was found, in a pictu-&#xD;
resque, musing attitude, by Miss Grahame and&#xD;
Mr. Tyndale when they came up a little while&#xD;
after.&#xD;
"What, all alone?" said Leslie. "Has&#xD;
Carl vanished too?"&#xD;
"Oh, Mr. Middleton is so bewitched by&#xD;
Miss Desmond, and so inconsolable at her&#xD;
absence, that I really could not keep him&#xD;
any longer on my hands!" answered this in-&#xD;
genuous lady. "I i~gsted upon his going in&#xD;
search of her, and he left. only a minute ago."&#xD;
"I cannot imagine what has become of&#xD;
Norak and Captain Tyndale," said Miss Gra-&#xD;
hame, "unless Arthur is right in thinking&#xD;
that they ha~e probably taken the boat and&#xD;
gone to~the head of the lake."&#xD;
"I am sure they have done that," said&#xD;
Arthur. "I noticed a short while ago that&#xD;
the boat has vanished from the place where&#xD;
Max usually leaves it."&#xD;
"But it was very selfish of them to go off&#xD;
alone," said Mrs. Sandford, in a tone of th~&#xD;
most genuine vexation. "I should have&#xD;
liked to see the head of the lake, too I"&#xD;
"Some accident must have occurred to&#xD;
detain them," said Leslie, "else I am sure&#xD;
Morah would have been back before this."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I think I hear the sound of oars now,"&#xD;
said Tyndale, walking nearer to the shore.&#xD;
This proved to be the case. The sound&#xD;
of oars and of voices was heard, together with&#xD;
a light laugh, which the listener had cause&#xD;
to know well. The next moment, around a&#xD;
curve of the shore, the two delinquents came&#xD;
into sightMax pulling so lazily on his oars&#xD;
that it was scarcely wonderful they had not&#xD;
arrived before; Norah, with her lap full of&#xD;
wild-flowers, trailing one long, leafy spray in&#xD;
the water, as she had trailed Carl's liardly-&#xD;
won and lightly-thrown-away lily before it.&#xD;
"Have you wondered what had become&#xD;
of us? ~ she asked, as Max ran the boat up&#xD;
to the bank and she stepped ashore, being&#xD;
forced to accept, in doing so, a slight assist-&#xD;
ance from the hand which to avoid she had&#xD;
soiled her boot in the morning. "fr~is all&#xD;
my fault. I carried Captain Tyndale off&#xD;
whether he would or no, and we f~und a&#xD;
fairy-land in those beautiful woods at the&#xD;
head of the lake. See! are not these beauti-&#xD;
ful ?" She held up her flowery spoils. "Does&#xD;
anybody know enough of botany to tell me&#xD;
what they are?"&#xD;
While Leslie was admiring the flowers,&#xD;
and naming the most familiar varieties, Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford turned to -Captain Tyndale, who,&#xD;
having, also stepped ashore, was making his&#xD;
craft fast to a convenient tree.&#xD;
"Unless I should have been entirely de&#xD;
Irop, I think y~u might have been kind&#xD;
enough to come back and invite me to accom1&#xD;
pany you on your expedition," she said, open-&#xD;
ing a perfect battery of reproachful glances&#xD;
on him. "I should have liked nothing bet-&#xD;
ter than to have gone. I adore boating!"&#xD;
"Do you?" said he, lifting his head after&#xD;
having fastened the boat. ~'But you adore&#xD;
croquettes and Heidsick, also, don't you? If&#xD;
you remember, you were all going to luncheon&#xD;
when Miss Desmond and I started on our 'ex-&#xD;
pedition.'."&#xD;
"And, pray, are you and Miss Desmond&#xD;
so ethereal that you are able to dispense with&#xD;
food altogether? or did you find luncheon a~&#xD;
well as flowers at the head of the lake?"&#xD;
"We found a few well-baked blackberries,&#xD;
the very last of the season."&#xD;
"You must have\left the boat to find&#xD;
those I"&#xD;
"Of course we left the boat. I suppose&#xD;
we spent an hour wandering about in search&#xD;
of the flowers Miss Desmond has."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Indeed!" said Mrs. Sandford. She gave&#xD;
a glance at Norah, as she stood with flushed,&#xD;
lovely face and torn dress-for her encoun-&#xD;
ters with bushes and briers had not been few&#xD;
-farther in the shadc~ Then she laughed&#xD;
her rippling laugh, which sounded like a&#xD;
piano-forte scale. "It is really refreshing to&#xD;
see a-woman who knows so well how to make&#xD;
men of use as Miss Desmond does!" she&#xD;
said. "As for me, I am so afraid of being&#xD;
troublesome that I scarcely ever venture to&#xD;
make such downright demands on their time&#xD;
and patience."&#xD;
"You should not be so modest," said&#xD;
Max, with a tone of irony in his voice. "Men&#xD;
are nothing if not useful."&#xD;
"I don't think one gains any thing but&#xD;
boredom by modesty, after all," said she;&#xD;
"so, 4f you are sure you are not tired, you&#xD;
may take me out on the lake for a little while,&#xD;
please."&#xD;
"Delighted to do so, I nsa sure," said he,&#xD;
with one of thos~ ready falsehoods which we&#xD;
all tell so glibly, and solace our consciences&#xD;
by thinking it merely "conventional,"&#xD;
So, complying weakly with a feminine in-&#xD;
vitation, for the second time that day, Cap-&#xD;
tain Tyndale found himself again afloat, row-&#xD;
ing across the lake with tired arms, and lis-&#xD;
tening to his companion's emphasized conver-&#xD;
sation with a somewhat tired mind.&#xD;
Carl, meanwhile, made his appearance,&#xD;
having caught a glimpse of the homeward-&#xD;
bound boat as he sauntered along the shore,&#xD;
more bent on escaping Mrs. Sandford than on&#xD;
finding Norah. Although he had carried off&#xD;
matters so lightly with the former, he had&#xD;
in truth been sorely offended by Miss Des-&#xD;
mend's desertion and long absence. Hope-&#xD;
less as he was, or might have been, for him-&#xD;
self, he was ready to be jealous of anybody in&#xD;
the world on whom the light of her eyes should&#xD;
chance to fall, and he anathematized Max&#xD;
Tyndale almost as warmly as he had before&#xD;
anathematized Arthur, while the long hours&#xD;
which the former was spending at her side&#xD;
wore away. "She can no more help flirting&#xD;
than she can help breathing," he thought.&#xD;
"Of course she is making a fool of him!"&#xD;
Now, although the after-effects of being made&#xD;
a fool of are not pleasant, it is nevertheless&#xD;
(with a woman who thoroughly understands&#xD;
her business) a very delightful amusement at&#xD;
the time, aJ3d of this Carl was fully nware.&#xD;
Hence, he indulged in savage thoughts of&#xD;
&#xD;
[ Captain Tyndale, who was just then, no&#xD;
doubt, enjoying this delight. Hence, also, he&#xD;
looked remarkably grave and a trifle de-&#xD;
pressed when he came up to where Norab,&#xD;
Leslie, and Arthur, were standing on the&#xD;
bank, watching Max as he pulled the little&#xD;
boat vigorously along in the full blaze of the&#xD;
afternoon sun.&#xD;
"Captain Tyndale must surely be in&#xD;
training," said Carl. "Does he do this sort&#xD;
of thing often? He has been rowing steadily&#xD;
on a stretch-for how znany hours?"&#xD;
"He did very little rowing when I was in&#xD;
the boat," said Norah. "We floated most&#xD;
of the time. You have no idea how pleasant&#xD;
it is if one keeps in the shade."&#xD;
"Very pleasant, I dare say" (a little&#xD;
grimly). "But is he trying to disgust Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford, that he is keeping so broadly in the&#xD;
sun just now?"&#xD;
"The shadow is on the other side of the&#xD;
lake at present," said Miss Desmond. "In&#xD;
the morning it was on this side. That makes&#xD;
the difference." Then she turned to Leslie.&#xD;
"Have you had much sport since I left?"&#xD;
she asked. "Have you caught many fish?&#xD;
You know Mr. Middleton promised to eat all&#xD;
of your catching."&#xD;
"He will not be troubled or gratified, as&#xD;
the case may be," answered Leslie. "I have&#xD;
ca~ight literally nothing. In fact, a more harm-&#xD;
less set of people never amused themselves&#xD;
by dropping baits in water, I am sure."&#xD;
"It has been so profitless,'.' said Tyndale,&#xD;
"that I am afraid you must be tired. Sup-&#xD;
pose we go to the house? Max and Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford can follow at their leisure."&#xD;
To the house, therefore, they took their&#xD;
way-along the path which they had followed&#xD;
in the morning-rather subdued in appear-&#xD;
anke and manner-as people are apt to be&#xD;
af~er a day of "pleasure." Certainly it is&#xD;
or4y when we have set ourselves deliberately&#xD;
to ~work to capture enjoyment, that we begin&#xD;
to realize what a very elusive thing it is-al-&#xD;
most as elusive as the love which-&#xD;
"....will fly away from an emperor's match-&#xD;
To dance at a penny wedding."&#xD;
A very elusive thing it certainly seemed&#xD;
to have proved to Carl, who at last broke si-&#xD;
lence, with a frank expression of his senti-&#xD;
ments:&#xD;
"I knew the whole thing would be a fail-&#xD;
ure," he said, "but really I was not prepared&#xD;

been!"                                    I sible attraction for me. I am anre I should&#xD;
&#xD;
"What a pity, Mr. Tyndale could not hear&#xD;
you!" said Norali. "It would serve as a warn-&#xD;
ing to him not to invite such an exi1qcant gen.&#xD;
ileman on another fishing-party."&#xD;
"Do you mean to say, that you have not&#xD;
been bored ? " demanded he, turning suddenly&#xD;
upon her.&#xD;
"Not particularly," answered she, indif-&#xD;
ferently. "I did not expect any thing very&#xD;
exhilarating in the way of amusement, and,&#xD;
when one's expectations are moderate, one's&#xD;
disappointment cannot be very severe."&#xD;
"Yet you certainly must have been amused&#xD;
after a fashion," said he, quickly and suspi.&#xD;
ciously, "else you would not have remained&#xD;
away with Tyndale so long."&#xD;
"I cannot say that I was specially amused,&#xD;
but it was better than sitting on a rug; hold-&#xD;
ing a line in the water, and waiting for a fish&#xD;
to impale itself on a hook."&#xD;
"I should think it would have been worse&#xD;
than any or all of those things to have that&#xD;
heavy fellow on your hands for such a length&#xD;
of time."&#xD;
"My experience among 'heavy fellows'&#xD;
h~s been so great that I have grown thor.&#xD;
roughly accustomed to them. I am afraid I&#xD;
should scarcely know what to do with a brill-&#xD;
iant one if I were to meet such a s-era avis."&#xD;
"Indeed!" said Carl, flushing, and real-&#xD;
izing afresh that in any word - encounter he&#xD;
was always sure to get the worst of Norah's&#xD;
keen tongue.&#xD;
After this, very little more was said. Miss&#xD;
Desmond evidently meant to keep her own&#xD;
counsel on the score of her long t~te-d-t~te with&#xD;
Max-as, indeed, those who knew her were&#xD;
soon forced to learn that she kept it on all&#xD;
subjects. , It may have been that she owed to&#xD;
the peculiar circumstances of her hap-hazard,&#xD;
vagrant lif~,~ knowledge of the great worldly&#xD;
wisdom wjaich lies in habitual reticence. At&#xD;
all events, she possessed it in remarkable de-&#xD;
gree for one so young.&#xD;
When they reached the house, its cool&#xD;
rooms looked doubly inviting after their green-&#xD;
wood experience of five or six hours, as they&#xD;
all agreed, sitting at ease in the pleasant&#xD;
*  ,        drawing-room.&#xD;
"I am sure I should not have liked to be&#xD;
Maid Marian," said Leslie. "I scarcely think&#xD;
Robin Hood himself could have tempted me."&#xD;
"sow different people are!" said Norah.&#xD;
&#xD;
have 'fled to the forest' with Allen-a-Dale&#xD;
without compunction - and probably been&#xD;
an unrepentant victim of chronic rheumatism&#xD;
six months afterward."&#xD;
"What an inducement you give one for&#xD;
becoming an outlaw!" said Carl, with a tone&#xD;
of only half jest in his voice.&#xD;
But she turned from him impatiently-&#xD;
addressing Arthur for the first time volunta-&#xD;
rily:&#xD;
"I have noticed but one thing lacking in&#xD;
your beautiful grounds," she said. "Have&#xD;
you no flower-garden  "'&#xD;
"There is one," he answered, as if taken&#xD;
by surprise, "but it is old- fashioned and&#xD;
greatly neglected. Flowers soon run into&#xD;
weeds, you know. Such as it is, however,&#xD;
will you "-he paused, hesitated a moment,&#xD;
then went on deprecatingly-" will you come&#xD;
and look at it?"&#xD;
"No, thanks," she was beginning, when&#xD;
Leslie interposed:&#xD;
"Yes, Norab, pray go! I want you to&#xD;
see every thing at Strafford, and I think the&#xD;
garden will be beautiful when it is put in or-&#xD;
der again.-Take her, Arth\ur-and don't for-&#xD;
get to show her what a lovely view there is&#xD;
from the terrace just above."&#xD;
"Will you come?" said Arthur again,&#xD;
more deprecatingly than before.&#xD;
He looked at her eagerly, so did Carl.&#xD;
Both were uncertain what she would do. To&#xD;
the surprise of both, she smiled suddenly-a&#xD;
queer, puzzling smile-and, rising, bent her&#xD;
head in assent. "Yes, I will go," she said.&#xD;
Five minutes later, Tyndale and herself&#xD;
w~re walking round the terrace-alone. The&#xD;
long shadows of afternoon were stretching&#xD;
across the greensward of the park; the gold-&#xD;
en sunshine, slanting through the brown&#xD;
trunks of the trees, had a mellow glory in it&#xD;
- that serene, pathetic glory which ever&#xD;
dwells in the close of a summer day. Some-&#xD;
thing of this look seemed to rest on Norah's&#xD;
face and in Norah's eyes when she turned at&#xD;
last to her companion.&#xD;
"Why did you ask me to come with you?"&#xD;
she said, coldly, but more gently than she had&#xD;
spoken to him yet. "Did I not tell you that&#xD;
we were to be as strangers to each other?"&#xD;
"And has not even a stranger the right to&#xD;
ask you to walk around a terrace, to look at -&#xD;
a flower-garden?" said he, with a thrill of&#xD;

passion in his voice. "Stranger though I&#xD;
may be to you, Norah..-exiled forever from&#xD;
your heart, infinitely less to yo~i than these&#xD;
men whom I have hated for. being at your side&#xD;
all day-can I not even venture to do that?"&#xD;
"No," answered she, with quick kauleur.&#xD;
"You cannot even venture to do that, and so&#xD;
I would have showed you, without an instant's&#xD;
hesitation, if I had not desired to speak to you&#xD;
-to say a few words which mu~t be uttered&#xD;
in private."&#xD;
"I am ready to hear them," said he, quict-&#xD;
ly, "more than ready to hear any thing-the&#xD;
worst thing-you can have to say to me!&#xD;
Even the worst is better than not to hear your&#xD;
voice or meet your eyes at tNll I"&#xD;
"You will not be likely to intoxicate my&#xD;
N       brain, or to disarm wy judgment, by such com~&#xD;
monpl~ce flattery as that, Mi Tyndale," said&#xD;
she, contemptuously. "Instead, you may in-&#xD;
jure your cause more than you know by words&#xD;
£       which are gratuitous insults to me."&#xD;
"They are truth, Nora , if the truth is an&#xD;
insult," said he, ely.' Then he stopped&#xD;
suddenly and looked fnto her face. "My God,&#xD;
what a mad fool I have been!" he said. "Do&#xD;
you think I do not rdtl~e that now? Do you&#xD;
think I can look at you-that I can catch a&#xD;
glimpse of your face, that I can hear a tone of&#xD;
your yoke-without remembering the old,&#xD;
happy days at Baden? As you stand there&#xD;
now-the terrace, the trees, your attitude-all&#xD;
recall that evening when, coming down from&#xD;
the castle, we paused on one of the terraces&#xD;
of the mountain, and I told you how I had&#xD;
learned to love you. Norah, have you for.&#xD;
gotten?"&#xD;
"I remembermany things which you might&#xD;
be pardoned for wishing that Ishould forget,"&#xD;
answered she. "But you must have forgotten&#xD;
very much before you could dare to talk like&#xD;
this to me-Norah Desmond I"&#xD;
The tone in which she uttered her own&#xD;
name, the manner in which she drew herself&#xD;
up, in all the stateliness of her superb stat-&#xD;
ure, would have befitted a princess rather than&#xD;
a young person of very questionable Bohemian&#xD;
descent; but Arthur Tyndale remembered this&#xD;
haughty pride of old; and he'remembered,&#xD;
also, that it would have fared ill with any&#xD;
man who ventured to disregard it. In those&#xD;
days of which he had spoken be had known&#xD;
more than enough of the bitter school in which&#xD;
Norah had gained her armor; and he knew,&#xD;
likewise, how well it had served her in the&#xD;
&#xD;
scenes and associations among which her life&#xD;
had been spent.&#xD;
"Forgive me!" he said, humbly. "I&#xD;
meant to do any thing sooner than insult or&#xD;
ofi'end you. I am too gkd to have oven a miii-&#xD;
ute, in which to speak to you alone, to be will.&#xD;
ing to shortefi it by a second. But I cannot&#xD;
-Norab, it is impossible-I cannot forget the&#xD;
past."&#xD;
"Is it necessary for you to forget the past,&#xD;
Mr. Tyndale?" asked she, with the mockery,&#xD;
which had so greatly exasperated him in&#xD;
their first interview, in her eyes, and on her&#xD;
tongue. "When one is able to ignore a thing&#xD;
as completely as you have done-when one is&#xD;
emancipated from all trammels of honor or&#xD;
faith-when one is free from all embarrass.&#xD;
ment attending a plighted word-why should&#xD;
it be necessary to forget the past?"&#xD;
"Norab," he said, turning pale, and speak.&#xD;
ing with lips which fairly quivered, "for God's&#xD;
sake, spare me! I am not fit to cope with&#xD;
you-I never was, for that.matter~-but now I&#xD;
can only feel that I have ruined all the happi.&#xD;
ness of my life, and that I-I have no one to&#xD;
blame for it but myself!"&#xD;
"No one to blame but yourself!" repeated&#xD;
Norab, the merciless. "Do you blame your.&#xD;
self~ Mr. Tyndale? I should never have fan.&#xD;
e.ed such a thing for a moment. I was Sure,&#xD;
on the contrary, that you praised and glorified&#xD;
yourself for having displayed a great deal of&#xD;
worldly acumen. Will you telime," said she,&#xD;
changing her tone suddenly, "what you mean&#xD;
by all these innuendoes? Why do you blame&#xD;
yourself, and for what? It is too late to think&#xD;
of your honor, I should imagine, and I scarce*&#xD;
ly suppose that even your vanity could make&#xD;
you fancy that my happiness is in jeopardy."&#xD;
"Your happiness 1 "repeated he. "No. I&#xD;
see plainly that your happiness has passed be.&#xD;
yond my reach forever. I am selfish, as I&#xD;
have been from the first, Norah-I think only&#xD;
of myself. It is of tn~y happiness that I have&#xD;
made utter shipwreck."&#xD;
There was a minute's silence-a minute in&#xD;
which he felt that Norah's unflinching eyes&#xD;
were reading him through and through. It&#xD;
chanced that they had paused immediately in&#xD;
front of the library; and, if either of them&#xD;
had noticed, just then, a slight rustle would&#xD;
have been heard in one of the windows be-&#xD;
hind them-if they had glanced around, they&#xD;
might have seen a shadow which advanced,&#xD;
hesitated, then quickly retreated&#xD;
&#xD;

90                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.                                         ARTHUR'S UNHAPPY POSITION.             91&#xD;
&#xD;
"Again I say that you must tell me ex-&#xD;
plicitly what you mean, Mr. Tyndale," said&#xD;
Norab, imperiously. "More may depend on&#xD;
it than you imagine. Do you wish me to un-&#xD;
derstand that you do not love Leslie, and that&#xD;
you are pleased to imagine again that you do&#xD;
love me?"&#xD;
"I mean," said he, recklessly, "that I&#xD;
have made a desperate and a terrible mistake&#xD;
-that I do not love Leslie; and that, with all&#xD;
the power of' my soul, I do love you!"&#xD;
After this declaration, there was another&#xD;
minute's silence-a minute in* which Norah&#xD;
looked at him with a scorn, impossible to de-&#xD;
scribe, kindling on her face."&#xD;
"And these are the creatures to whom we&#xD;
give our hearth" she said, at length-the&#xD;
passionate cadence of her voice thrilling like&#xD;
music on the still air. "We let such men as&#xD;
this take our love and make a plaything of it!&#xD;
Have you as honor?" cl4ed she, turning upon&#xD;
him with sudden, scorching passion. "Are&#xD;
you true to nothing-to nobody? Arc you&#xD;
more unstable than water, more shifting than&#xD;
sand? Or do you think that you will find in&#xD;
me the weak and contemptible material of the&#xD;
woman who allows herself to serve for amuse-&#xD;
ment twice?"&#xD;
"I only think-" he began, as passionate-&#xD;
ly as herself.&#xD;
But, at this moment, there came a sudden&#xD;
crash in the window behind, which.made them&#xD;
both start and turn-the blood rushing guilt-&#xD;
ily to their faces, their pulses throbbing with&#xD;
a quick alarm. If Leslie-&#xD;
But, instead of Leslie, it was Mrs. Sandford,&#xD;
who appeared in the window, holding up her&#xD;
white hands, in playful deprecation, to Arthur.&#xD;
"0 Mr. Tyndale," she cried, "are you&#xD;
t~sere ?-ean you ever forgive me? I-oh, I&#xD;
are so sorry-so very sorry I In looking over&#xD;
your book-shelves, I have been so miserably&#xD;
unfortunate as to throw down this beautiful&#xD;
pedestal, and break the bust of Dante."&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
"Oh, hadet thou always better thought of men,&#xD;
Thou hadst then acted better. Carat suspicion!&#xD;
Unholy, miserable-doubt t To him&#xD;
Nothing on earth remains unwrenched and firm&#xD;
Who has no faith."&#xD;
AT eleven o'clock at night-the night of'&#xD;
the day which had witnessed, among a million&#xD;
&#xD;
or so other social transactions, the excursion&#xD;
of Miss Grahame and her guests to Strafford&#xD;
-Arthur Tyndale was walking from Rosland&#xD;
across the starlit fields in the direction of his&#xD;
own domain. Strongly against his inclina-&#xD;
tion, he had been obliged to return with the&#xD;
party to dinner. Max had unequivocally de-&#xD;
dined this pleasure; but Max was a free man&#xD;
and could do as he liked, despite Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford's appealing glances. Arthur, on the oth-&#xD;
er hand, was bound in the chains of one of&#xD;
the most oppressive forms of bondage on this&#xD;
earth of curs-that of an "engaged" man.&#xD;
ilowevor unexacting hisfianc~ie may be-and&#xD;
singularly unexacting Leslie was-society de-&#xD;
mands certain observances and attentions&#xD;
from the man who has entered into an en.&#xD;
gagement of marriage, which not seldom weigh&#xD;
with a most irksome weight on his spirit.&#xD;
"You are coming with us, Arthur, are you&#xD;
not?" Miss Grahame had said when they&#xD;
took their departure; and Arthur-who would&#xD;
have given any thing to answer "No "-stood&#xD;
literally devoid of a decent excuse for doing&#xD;
so. He could not say that the day had been&#xD;
so oppressively wearisome that it had ren-&#xD;
dered him uiifit for any other social duty;&#xD;
still less could he say that, to be in Nornh's&#xD;
society without any opportunity of obtaining&#xD;
a word or even a glance from her, had grown&#xD;
intolerable to him. The memory of other&#xD;
days was with him all the time-of days when&#xD;
no one in the world had a right to come be-&#xD;
tween them, when she was his, his only, his&#xD;
forever, as he had thought, according to the&#xD;
poor jargon in which we dress up our brief&#xD;
fever-fits of fancy.&#xD;
Now all this was changed. She was Carl's,&#xD;
Max's, anybody's, rather than his - and he&#xD;
was engaged to Leslie Grahame. These were&#xD;
two facts which stared him relentlessly in the&#xD;
face, as he walked through the quiet, dewy&#xD;
fields, watching the sinking, crescent moon,&#xD;
while he smoked his cigar and pondered va-&#xD;
rious things, profitable and otherwise. Chief&#xD;
among the latter class were many thoughts&#xD;
of Norah Desmond. He could nut forget that&#xD;
this woman, who stood as far from him now&#xD;
as one of the planets journeying tranquilly&#xD;
over his head, might, a year before, been his&#xD;
wife at a word. It was in vain that he told&#xD;
himself that things were much better as they&#xD;
were; that Leslie suited him incomparably&#xD;
better than her brilliant Bohemian sister ever&#xD;
could have done - his heart, his fancy, his&#xD;
&#xD;
passion, whatever was most concerned, said&#xD;
"Nay" to it all. He felt in every fibre that&#xD;
he was Norah's slave again-that he had been&#xD;
her slave ever since the mouaent she first&#xD;
looked at him with her imperious eyes.&#xD;
Yet this folly-this sudden, reckless revi-&#xD;
val of a passion which, for eighteen months,&#xD;
had lain dormant and made no sign-did not&#xD;
blind his eyes to the position in which he&#xD;
stood. Norah'5 cynicism was founded on&#xD;
truth in one respect at least-men arc not&#xD;
likely to play fast-and-loose with their plighted&#xD;
word when it is passed to one of their own&#xD;
order, to a woman supported by all that wealth&#xD;
and position can give, however lightly they&#xD;
may hold it where the daughter of a Macaire&#xD;
is concerned. To disregard an engagement&#xD;
with Norah Desmond was one thing, to break&#xD;
an engagement with Leslie Grahame quite&#xD;
another. Mr. Tyndale fully recognized the&#xD;
distinction .which made this difference.&#xD;
So it was that his reflections went much&#xD;
in a circle, like a vicious syllogism. Norah&#xD;
and Leslie, Leslie and Norah; the terrace at&#xD;
Baden and the terrace at Strafford made a&#xD;
strange medley in his mind, as he walked&#xD;
slowly through wood and field; and when,&#xD;
after having smoked half a dozen cigars, he&#xD;
found himself at last at the door of Strafford,&#xD;
he was still unable to perceive any ray of&#xD;
light illuminating the predicament in which&#xD;
he found himself. "I'll see Max, anyhow l"&#xD;
he thought. Max had come to fill very much&#xD;
the position of a moral bolster to Mr. Tyn-&#xD;
dale's wavering desires and resolutions.&#xD;
But when he paounted to Max's room-&#xD;
from which a light was streaming out on the&#xD;
summer night-he found it deserted. A fresh&#xD;
breeze was blowing through the open win-&#xD;
dows, and tossing over a number of loose&#xD;
papers on a table in the centre of the floor,&#xD;
but the deep leather chair beside the table,&#xD;
in which Max had evidently been lounging,&#xD;
was empty. Into this chair Arthur flung him-&#xD;
self-resting his head against the back, and&#xD;
closing his eyes wearily. lie would wait for&#xD;
his cousin, he thought, feeling literally inca-&#xD;
pable of any further exertion in the way of&#xD;
sear~l, just then. To employ his own phrase,&#xD;
he was "dead beat" by the listless wander-&#xD;
ings and various emotions of the day. It had&#xD;
been, from first to last, not only a bore, but&#xD;
something much worse than a bore to him.&#xD;
lie had been full of intense weariness' and&#xD;
passionate jealousy both at once, combined&#xD;
&#xD;
with the absolute necessity of showing nei-&#xD;
ther; and the overwrought strain consequent&#xD;
upon this state of affairs, had caused his in-&#xD;
sane outbreak of the afternoon. What harm&#xD;
he had done himself by this outbreak he could&#xD;
not as yet determine. Though he could not&#xD;
drive the memory of Norah's last words or&#xD;
Norah's last looks from his memory, he felt&#xD;
that it was impossible to pause and weigh&#xD;
them in their practical bearing. His head&#xD;
was not cool enough for such work. Max,&#xD;
now, might very readily be capable of it, but&#xD;
the very last thing in the world which Arthur&#xD;
thought of doing, was of telling the story of&#xD;
his folly to Max. He knew his cousin's par-&#xD;
tisanship for Leslie Grahame, and his cousin's&#xD;
stern ideas of honor, too well to v~ture upoii&#xD;
such a recital.&#xD;
It may be imagined, perhaps, that the&#xD;
thought of having been overheard by Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford -~-- who had so unexpectedly an-&#xD;
nounced her presence in the library-window&#xD;
-was a trifle the reverse of pleasant, and&#xD;
added another complication to those already&#xD;
thickening around him. But there- are some&#xD;
fortunate people in the world who, with re-&#xD;
gard to all matters not absolutely certain, are&#xD;
able to believe just what they wish to belieite.&#xD;
Probability is for them tinged entirely with&#xD;
the color of their own needs and desires.&#xD;
Conscience itself readily becomes their ad-&#xD;
vocate. To this class, Arthur Tyndale be.&#xD;
longed. It was not convenient to him to in-&#xD;
troduce another element of annoyance into&#xD;
the troublesome imbroglio in which he found&#xD;
himself - therefore he chose to ignore the&#xD;
probability that Mrs. Sandford had overheard&#xD;
any thing of what passed on the terrace.&#xD;
Her presence in the library was, as she had&#xD;
explained, a mere accident. She had just&#xD;
come in-she could have heard nothing-she&#xD;
had evidently been entirely unaware -of the&#xD;
near neighborhood of any one else. All this&#xD;
he believed, because it suited him to believe&#xD;
it. There arc many people in the world whe&#xD;
are unable to give any better reason for much&#xD;
more important creeds.&#xD;
So, going over the same tread-mlfl of ex-&#xD;
asperating thought, he yawned and waited,&#xD;
and waited &amp;amp;nd yawned, half' an hour for Max.&#xD;
But, even at the end of' half au hour, Max&#xD;
ba4 not appeared.&#xD;
"What the deuce keeps the fellow?"&#xD;
Arthur thought, impatiently.&#xD;
Just then a fresher breeze than 4ny which,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8066-00000054"/>&#xD;
92                 A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.                                              THE CAPTAIN'S REPORT.               93&#xD;
&#xD;
had gone before swept into the room, waving&#xD;
back the curtains, making the flame of 'the&#xD;
lamp flicker, and scattering broadcast over&#xD;
the floor the already fluttering papers on the&#xD;
table.&#xD;
"He'll find his things in fine confusion&#xD;
when he does come!" thought the visitor,&#xD;
lazily.&#xD;
But it did not occur to him to remedy&#xD;
this confusion by recapturing any of the odds&#xD;
and ends which were wafted past him. On&#xD;
the contrary, he watched them with indolent&#xD;
interest as they were blown to and fro into&#xD;
the. nooks and corners-some into the fire-&#xD;
place, some under the bed-until, glancing&#xD;
back to the table, his eye suddenly lighted&#xD;
upon a letter which lay there idly fluttering&#xD;
as if uncertain whether or not to follow its&#xD;
companions.&#xD;
As his glance fell on it, he started vio-&#xD;
lently. His complexion flushed, and then&#xD;
paled again; he caught his breath audibly.&#xD;
Blotted and blurred though it was, he recog-&#xD;
nized in an instant Norah Desmond's writing.&#xD;
For a minute amazement held him literally&#xD;
motionless. As he satgazing stupidly at the&#xD;
familiar characters-for to mistake that bold,&#xD;
black chirography for the writing of any&#xD;
other woman would have been as impossible&#xD;
as to mistake Norah herself for a fashionable&#xD;
* nonentity from a boarding-school-a dozen&#xD;
wild thoughts and conjectures rushed into&#xD;
his mind. What was the meaning of it?&#xD;
How did such a letter come to he here? Had&#xD;
it been addressed to Max? Were they either,&#xD;
or both of them, playing idm(Tyndale) false?&#xD;
Was it a flirtation? Was it a negotiation?&#xD;
his brain felt in a whirl. One thing only&#xD;
was certain: whatever it was, it concerned&#xD;
him vitally, and he must know what it meant.&#xD;
There was no time for scruples or wiredrawn&#xD;
notions of honor when he was being ~deceived&#xD;
and tricked like this! Had not Max, that&#xD;
very morning, assured him that his inter-&#xD;
course with Norah had been entirely unsatis-&#xD;
factory, as well as very slight; and now, here&#xD;
on Max's table, lay a letter which in itself&#xD;
went far to prtve such a statement utterly un-&#xD;
true!&#xD;
"I could not have believed it of him!"&#xD;
Arthur thought, aghast at the gulf of perfidy&#xD;
which yawned before him. His indignation&#xD;
amounted, indeed, to a sense of absolute out-&#xD;
rage-a curious fact, which those will readily&#xD;
credit who have observed what a different.&#xD;
&#xD;
standard in love, friendship, faith, or general&#xD;
morality, we have for our friends and for our-&#xD;
selves. We gracefully stretch the truth to&#xD;
meet the pressure of any necessity which&#xD;
may arise; we govern our conduct by the&#xD;
strictest rule of expediency; we allow our-&#xD;
selves the widest latitude in every possible&#xD;
respect, and demand that no evil' shall be&#xD;
thought-but, if we have the slightest reason&#xD;
to suspect that others are doing unto us as&#xD;
we have done unto them; disgust and misan-&#xD;
thropy are very sure to follow. "This is hu-&#xD;
man nature!" we cry, when we detect in one&#xD;
falsehood the agreeable friend to whom we&#xD;
have probably told a dozen. "This is affec-&#xD;
tion, this is friendship! Oh, who would put&#xD;
faith in either?" So it was with Tyndalc.&#xD;
He had felt toward Max as toward a brother;&#xD;
he had trusted Max with every thing; and&#xD;
now for Max to deceive him on such a vital&#xD;
point as this!&#xD;
But he must read the letter. He must&#xD;
know how far he had been deceived, how far&#xD;
betrayed. No doubt it contained some definite&#xD;
assurance of what Norah meant to do. It&#xD;
was imperative that he should gain this as-&#xD;
surance at any cost. He repeated again that&#xD;
it was no time for scruples or hesitation. He&#xD;
was being deceived, and in self-defense he&#xD;
must know in what manner and in what de-&#xD;
gree.&#xD;
So, serving himself to an act from which&#xD;
every instinct even of conventional honor&#xD;
shrank, he at last extended his hand and&#xD;
took up the letter-a letter which seemed&#xD;
destined to be the plaything alike of chance&#xD;
and of the winds of heaven-and opened it.&#xD;
The first line told him that it was not ad-&#xD;
dressed to Max. Before he had time to read&#xD;
a second, he heard Max's quick, ringing step&#xD;
in the hall below.&#xD;
It was the work of an instant to fold the&#xD;
sheet of paper and slip it into the breast-&#xD;
pocket of his coat. There was no time for&#xD;
thought or deliberation. Impulse said, "It&#xD;
is as much yours as his-take it!" and he&#xD;
followed the dictate of impulse. Before Cap.&#xD;
tam Tyndale had mounted the stairs and&#xD;
reached the door, he had thrown himself&#xD;
back, and was shading his eyes from the light,&#xD;
as if half asleep.&#xD;
"What! you here?" said the former, in&#xD;
a tone of surprise, as he entered "When&#xD;
did you get back from Rosland?"&#xD;
"At least half an hour ago," answered&#xD;
&#xD;
Arthur, starting as if abruptly roused. "I&#xD;
have been waiting for you until I had almost&#xD;
given you up. Where the deuce have you&#xD;
been all this time?"&#xD;
"Taking a turn in the park to cool my&#xD;
head," answered Max. "I suppose it is our&#xD;
unusual gayety which has upset it; but I&#xD;
found myself amazingly warm and restless in&#xD;
the house."&#xD;
"It is warm again; but I should think&#xD;
you would have rowed off all inclination to&#xD;
restlessness to.day."&#xD;
"I did very little rowing, except when I&#xD;
took Mrs. Sandford out; then I was anxious&#xD;
to bring her back as soon as possible."&#xD;
"You did bring her ba~ck very quickly,"&#xD;
said Arthur, in rather an injured tone. "It&#xD;
could not have been an hour after I left her&#xD;
on the1lake when, to my surprise, she was&#xD;
smashing Dante in the library."&#xD;
"Yes, I made short work of it," said the&#xD;
other, complacently. "Rather shorter work&#xD;
than she took to be civil, I fancy; for, while&#xD;
I was fastening the boat, she started off to&#xD;
the house by herself and, since I was not&#xD;
particularly anxious to overtake her, we did&#xD;
not meet again till after tbe Dante calamity.&#xD;
I suppose when she came in she thought she&#xD;
would do a little exploring on her own ac-&#xD;
count."&#xD;
"Confound her!" sai4 Arthur, wit!) the&#xD;
most sincere emphasis. Then - conscious&#xD;
that he was verging on dangerous ground-&#xD;
be went on hurriedly, lest this subject might&#xD;
lead to some inquiry with regard to~ Norah&#xD;
and himself: "You see I have been taking&#xD;
life easily while ~ waited for you," he said,&#xD;
"though you needn't think it is I who have&#xD;
been playing the mischief with your papers.&#xD;
The wind served you that trick, and I was&#xD;
too lazy to set things to rights."&#xD;
"It is not a matter of any importance,"&#xD;
said Max, casting a careless glance at his&#xD;
scattered effects. "Yo.u have returned soon,"&#xD;
he added, leaning back in his chair, and cov-&#xD;
ering a yawn by pulling his long mustache.&#xD;
"Soon, do you call it? It can't be less&#xD;
than twelve o'clock."&#xD;
"And isn't that soon for a summer night,&#xD;
with stars, and bright eyes, and all that sort&#xD;
of thing to keep you awake?"&#xD;
"The bright eyes were looking rather&#xD;
sleepy when I left Rosland. I don't think&#xD;
we can flatter ourselves that our fishing-party&#xD;
was very much of a success, Max."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I never flattered myself for a moment&#xD;
that it would be, my dear fellow," answered&#xD;
Max, cheerfully.&#xD;
"And yet," said Arthur, quickly, "it&#xD;
ought to have been a success in one respect&#xD;
at least. You certainly had a sufficient op-&#xD;
portunity to-day for finding out something&#xD;
about Norah's intentions."&#xD;
"To possess an opportunity and to use it&#xD;
are two very different things. I am sure you&#xD;
are aware of that."&#xD;
"You mean, then, that you did not dis-&#xD;
cover any thing?"&#xD;
"I mean that my attempt to do so was&#xD;
rewarded with very little success. Miss Des-&#xD;
mond was as reticent as ever, and I was un-&#xD;
able to extract any thing at all definite from&#xD;
hei'."&#xD;
"That was unfortunate!" said Arthur.&#xD;
The other did not notice, the sudden jarring&#xD;
tone in his voice, nor the suspicious look in&#xD;
his eyes. "You know nothing, then, of&#xD;
what her intentions are?" he added, after a&#xD;
minute, endeavoring with only tolerable suc-&#xD;
cess to keep all significance out of the inquiry.&#xD;
"Nothing," answered Max, slowly, "ex-&#xD;
cept-" He paused just there and hesitated.&#xD;
"If your exception does not rest under&#xD;
the seal of confidence, pray don't hesitate on&#xD;
my account," said Arthur. "I can credit&#xD;
~Miss Desmond with any degree of resentful&#xD;
feeling and resentful determination to avenge&#xD;
her wrongs."&#xD;
"You will credit her with something,&#xD;
then, of which I have seen no sign," answered&#xD;
Max, glancing with some surprise at him.&#xD;
"I was about to say-though I beg you to&#xD;
understand that I have received no pledge to&#xD;
such an effect-that I think it likely Miss&#xD;
Desmond may be more generous than you&#xD;
anticipate."&#xD;
"Generous I" - a flush came over the&#xD;
handsome, blond face. "That i&amp;amp; an indefi-&#xD;
nite expression at best. What does it stand&#xD;
for? That she will bind herself to say noth-&#xD;
ing of the past, and that she will deliver up&#xD;
the letters?"&#xD;
"No. She binds herself to nothing. You&#xD;
must be as well aware as I am that you are in&#xD;
no position to demand that she should do so."&#xD;
"The upshot of the matter then is that&#xD;
site is to be bound to nothing, and that lam&#xD;
to remain entirelrat her mercy?"&#xD;
"I am afraid it is not ~pfuch more than&#xD;
that," said Captain Tyndale, gravely.&#xD;

&#xD;
"By Heaven, I will not endure it 1" said&#xD;
the other, vehemently. "Max, do you mean&#xD;
to tell me that this is all that you have been&#xD;
able to obtain from her?"&#xD;
"It is all," answered Max, a little coldly.&#xD;
"But, unless you deliberately go to work to&#xD;
injure your own cause, I do not think that&#xD;
you have very much to fear. She is a proud&#xD;
woman, and a generous woman, this Norah&#xD;
Desmond."&#xD;
"Do you imagine that you know her bet-&#xD;
ter than I do?" asked Arthur, sneeringly.&#xD;
"It is true you spent three hours alone in&#xD;
tier society to-day; but the character that&#xD;
Norah Desmond shows you when she meanf&#xD;
to make a fool of you, and the character she&#xD;
shows you after she has made a fool of you,&#xD;
are twQ very different things."&#xD;
"Miss Desmond is not likely to waste her&#xD;
ammunition on me," was the dry response.&#xD;
"You may set your mind at rest on that&#xD;
point. As for the three hours which I spent&#xD;
in her society, they were chiefly spent in your&#xD;
service. As far as I was concerned, I should&#xD;
have preferred a cigar under a pine-tree."&#xD;
"And yet you accomplished nothing?"&#xD;
"If you call it nothing to have gained a&#xD;
moral certainty that she will give you no&#xD;
trouble; that you may marry Miss Grahame&#xD;
to-morrow without any fear of what she may&#xD;
do-or say."&#xD;
Arthur winced a little at this assurance.&#xD;
Max would have been still more surprised if&#xD;
he could have seen how very little inclina-&#xD;
tion he felt just then to marry Leslie Gm-&#xD;
hame, with all her sweetness and all her&#xD;
grace, on the next day, or any other day~ for&#xD;
that matter.&#xD;
"Moral certainties don't count for much,"&#xD;
he said, after a minute. "I'd rather have&#xD;
one proof that she means it."&#xD;
"I am sorry to say I have no proof to offer.&#xD;
An ambassador's word should be worth some-&#xD;
thing, however, shouldn't it? I have no rea-&#xD;
son for deceiving you."&#xD;
"For deceiving me-no! But you may&#xD;
be mistaken."&#xD;
"True enough. I advance no claim to in-&#xD;
fallibility-especially with regard. Zo women."&#xD;
"Still, you think that she means to let&#xD;
the matter rest?"&#xD;
"I think so, undoubtedly," answered&#xD;
Max, impatiently. He ditl not understand&#xD;
the drift of these reiterated questions. It&#xD;
was growing late, he was growing tired, and&#xD;
&#xD;
when he felt like yawning again he did so,&#xD;
without any pretense of pulling his mustache.&#xD;
Arthur took the hint, and rose.&#xD;
"I see you feel as thoroughly used up as I&#xD;
do," said he; "therefore I'll leave you to turn&#xD;
in. In fact, I owe you an apology for having&#xD;
kept you up so long. But this cursed busi-&#xD;
ness dwells on my mind! I don't believe&#xD;
there ever was a man in such a position be-&#xD;
fore! You've done your best for me, how.&#xD;
ever, Max-I see that plainly-and shall not&#xD;
forget it. I am more grateful than you can&#xD;
tell-especially for your assurance-but, if I&#xD;
fail to give exactly your degree of credit to it,&#xD;
it is because I have the advantage of knowing&#xD;
Norah Desmond better than you do."&#xD;
"I make no pretensions whatever to know.&#xD;
ing Miss Desmond very well," Max answered.&#xD;
And so they parted.&#xD;
When Arthur went to his own room, .his&#xD;
first act was to lock the door-although the&#xD;
danger of interruption was infinitesimally&#xD;
small-his second, to take the letter from his&#xD;
pocket and read it eagerly through, from be-&#xD;
ginning to end.' As he did so, his face would&#xD;
have been a study for any observer of human&#xD;
nature and human physiognomy-of whom,&#xD;
however, there was unfortunately none at&#xD;
hand. The color came and went in vivid al-&#xD;
ternations of red and white; his lips quivered,&#xD;
and now and then he gnawed the under one&#xD;
nervously. +11 these were significant signs&#xD;
with him. Once he caught his breath with&#xD;
the quick gasp of a man to whom a startling&#xD;
surprise has come. This was when he found&#xD;
that Norah had learned in what manner he&#xD;
had endeavored to deter Leslie from making&#xD;
any attempt to know her. "She'll never for-&#xD;
give that!" he mutZered. ~" It's certain to be&#xD;
a duel to the death now!"&#xD;
Then he went on, his eye traveling down&#xD;
line after line of the paragraph in which she&#xD;
summed up the various items of her debt&#xD;
against him. Even the written words seemed&#xD;
instinct with the passion which had dictated&#xD;
them. He seemed to hear her voice, to meet&#xD;
her eyes, in every sentence. And, when he&#xD;
reached the climax, in which her fiery energy&#xD;
spent itself-when he read the significant&#xD;
words, dashed out broad and black upon the&#xD;
white paper, in which she declared that, after&#xD;
having added up the debt, she felt constrained&#xD;
to ask what reprisal could ever equal it, his&#xD;
eyes remained fastened on the page for a full&#xD;
minute, a~ if fascinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
Then suddenly he flung the letter on the&#xD;
table, by which he had been stan(ling, and,&#xD;
turning away, walked across the room. He&#xD;
felt stunned-as if he had been thrown down&#xD;
suddenly by an unexpected hand. Such vin-&#xD;
dictive passion, such scornful renunciation,&#xD;
was worse than he had expected-iv~rse even&#xD;
than he had feared-but, what surprised him&#xD;
even more than the spirit here displayed, than&#xD;
all of Norah'5 anger, or Norah's resentment,&#xD;
was the apparently causeless duplicity of Max.&#xD;
With this letter in his possession, he had not&#xD;
hesitated to say that he had a "moral certain-&#xD;
ty" of Miss Desmond's intention to ignore the&#xD;
past! With the assertion before his eyes that&#xD;
there was no reprisal great enough to repay&#xD;
her debt, he had talked of her generosity, and&#xD;
given hopes-nay, positive assurances-that&#xD;
she had' relinquished all idea of using the pow-&#xD;
er which rested in her hands!&#xD;
"What a lesson against trusting any-&#xD;
body!" Tyndale thought, coming back to the&#xD;
table, and looking at the letter, which lay be-&#xD;
fore him. "No doubt she has turned his&#xD;
head, and won him completely over to her&#xD;
side. I might have expected that. I might&#xD;
have known that would be her first move.&#xD;
And yet Max-I did not think there was the&#xD;
woman in the world who could have made&#xD;
Max act like this! But treachery is a thing&#xD;
which must be expected from everybody who&#xD;
is not tied fast by interest to one's cause," he&#xD;
went on, after a minute's pause. "Good&#xD;
Heavens! how wise I was to take this letter!&#xD;
-how entirely, hereafter, I must rely on my-&#xD;
self alone! She had plainly determined to&#xD;
throw me off my guard by insinuating such&#xD;
vague assurances as I received to-night, and&#xD;
then to fire the whole thing upon me when I&#xD;
am least expecting it. Well "-folding up&#xD;
tle letter with a defiant air, and placing it in&#xD;
his pocket-book-" we shall see! The battle&#xD;
is opened in earnest now~ and it will go hard&#xD;
with me if I cannot even yet outwit this&#xD;
shrewd schemer and her new ally!"&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
"A lie which Is all a lie may he met and fought&#xD;
with outright,&#xD;
But a lie which is part of a truth is a harder mat-&#xD;
ter to fight."&#xD;
Tus morning after the fishing-party at&#xD;
Strafford, Captain Tynda!e walked over to&#xD;
&#xD;
Rosland. It was such a rare thing for him to&#xD;
make his appearance so early in the day-the&#xD;
morning being usually esteemed sacred to&#xD;
Arthur-that Mrs. Middleton could not re-&#xD;
strain an involuntary expression of surprise&#xD;
when he w~s shown into the drawing-room,&#xD;
where she chanced to be sitting alone.&#xD;
"I hope I do not intrude upon you at a&#xD;
barbarous hour," he said, apologetically, as&#xD;
he crossed the floor to her favorite alcove,&#xD;
where, with a desk open, she was inviting a&#xD;
letter, with a gold pen, on the palest sea-green&#xD;
paper. "I came over to inquire how the&#xD;
ladies are after their fatigue of yesterday.&#xD;
Better, I hope, than Arthur, who really seems&#xD;
considerably the worse for his dissipation,&#xD;
this morning."&#xD;
"Indeed! I am very sorry to hear it,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Middleton, in the highly-sympathetic&#xD;
tone in which people usually say such things.&#xD;
"But I thought the excursion a very impru-&#xD;
dent one for everybody concerned. The sun&#xD;
this time of year is exceedingly injurious,&#xD;
and then the dampness-but I am glad to say&#xD;
that nobody seems the worse for it here.&#xD;
They were fatigued last night, but this morn-&#xD;
ing they are all much as usual. I hope Mr.&#xD;
Tyndale's indisposition is not serious?"&#xD;
"Oh, not at all. Lie complains of a head-&#xD;
ache, and of having been a little feverish last&#xD;
~night. It is no thing much, I fancy, but I&#xD;
recommended him to keep out of the sun."&#xD;
Yes, that is the great point," said Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton, earnestly-everybody has a hob-&#xD;
by, and her hobby was, that an ounce of pre-&#xD;
vention is worth many pounds of cure, with&#xD;
regard to sickness. "People talk of the&#xD;
night air being unwholesome on account of&#xD;
malaria, but I always think that whoever is&#xD;
careful to keep out of the sun is sure to do&#xD;
very well. I sleep with my windows open&#xD;
every night, but I never go out in the sun, and&#xD;
I have not had an attack of fever in fifteen&#xD;
years. If you don't take care, Captain Tyn-&#xD;
dale, you will be ill," she went on, as if&#xD;
moved by a sudden impulse to utter a word&#xD;
of seasonable warning. "You are not used&#xD;
to our climate, and I think the manner in&#xD;
which Mr. Tyndale and yourself walk over&#xD;
here in the broiling sun, without even an um-&#xD;
brella-"&#xD;
"But you forget, madame," said Max,&#xD;
laughing-~-.he showed his French breeding in&#xD;
always saying "madame," instead of our&#xD;
curt English '~ madam" ~"that a soldier&#xD;

never carries an umbrella. He would rather&#xD;
a thousand times endure death by a coup do&#xD;
aoleil than be guilty of any thing so opposed&#xD;
to the spirit of military discipline. I flatter&#xD;
myself I know something about your climate.&#xD;
If it means to kill me, it ought t~ have done&#xD;
so while I was marching some years ago in&#xD;
your army. It will not have such another&#xD;
opportunity soon."&#xD;
"Things never come when we are expect-&#xD;
ing them," said Mrs. Middleton, shaking her&#xD;
head.&#xD;
And, as if to point this oracular remark,&#xD;
a vision arrayed in purple and white-the&#xD;
first below, the latter above, according to the&#xD;
present fashion of piebald costume-whom&#xD;
they were neither of them expecting, ap.&#xD;
peaked just then in the open door.&#xD;
"0 Captain Tyndale!" cried Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford, with a start, "is it possible this is yea?&#xD;
I had no idea that you were here I "-Robert&#xD;
had only informed her of the fact five minutes&#xD;
before-" I came down-stairs in search of a&#xD;
book. I found" (appealing with infantine&#xD;
blue eyes to Mrs. Middleton) "that I really&#xD;
could not force myself to write my letters.&#xD;
Why can we not telegraph to our friends?"&#xD;
(this to Max). "If we say 'I am well-how&#xD;
are you?' it would be all that is neces-&#xD;
sary."&#xD;
"Not quite all, I am afraid," answered he,&#xD;
advancing and taking the hand she offered&#xD;
him with bewitching frankness. "If I were&#xD;
fortunate enough to receive one of your tele-&#xD;
grams, I could scarcely content myself with&#xD;
an equally terse reply. I~ should be con-&#xD;
strained to add that I kissed your hands, at&#xD;
least."&#xD;
"But what would be the sease of doing&#xD;
by telegraph what you never did in fact?"&#xD;
asked she, with admirable naivete'.&#xD;
"Then, in view of future telegraphing&#xD;
contingencies, we had better make it fact at&#xD;
once," said he, raising the hand-a very pretty&#xD;
one, which he still held-to his lips.&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford did what a foolish woman&#xD;
does on all possible occasions-she laughed;&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton looked as if she was not ex-&#xD;
actly certain what she thought of such con-&#xD;
duct; but Max was so thoroughly at his ease,&#xD;
and so evidently meant his act of gallantry to&#xD;
be regarded in the light of something entirely&#xD;
conventional and free from tender signifi-&#xD;
cance, that after a moment she laughed, too.&#xD;
"Captain Tyndale is initiating you into&#xD;
&#xD;
foreign modes of salutation," she said to Mrs..&#xD;
Sandford.&#xD;
"What an original you are!" said that&#xD;
lady, surveying Captain Tyndale with a glance&#xD;
of manifest approval. "A thing that most&#xD;
men do in a corner, and look foolish and&#xD;
sentimental over, you do in broad daylight and&#xD;
before anybody, with the utmost 8aflh1-froid."&#xD;
"lt is because we regard the matter from&#xD;
different points of view," said he. "One&#xD;
kisses a lady's hand in France as one shakes&#xD;
it here."&#xD;
"I confess that this universal habit of&#xD;
shaking hands strikes me very unpleasantly,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Middleton. "It proves more con-~&#xD;
elusively than' any thing else the free-and-&#xD;
easy tone which has come over society. The&#xD;
idea of a young lady and a young gentleman&#xD;
greeting each other like a pair of school-&#xD;
boys I Inmy day people knew how to bow-a&#xD;
thing which they seem to have entirely for-&#xD;
gotten now-and a lady never shook hands&#xD;
with any but her most intimate acquaint-&#xD;
ances."&#xD;
"I am heartily glad that was not my&#xD;
day!" said Mrs. Sandford, enthroning her-&#xD;
self on a sofa, and looking up with blue-china&#xD;
eyes at Max. "Fancy living like a set of&#xD;
pokers! I know how to bow, too-in the&#xD;
lancers-but I would rather shake hands any&#xD;
day!"&#xD;
"So should I," said he, sitting down be-&#xD;
side her-as she invited him to do by draw-&#xD;
ing her drapery jiside-" provided I might&#xD;
choose the hands to shake."&#xD;
"But under any circumstance~ you would&#xD;
rather kiss them, I suppose."&#xD;
"Infinitely rather, if they are like yours."&#xD;
"What a flatterer you are!" cried she,&#xD;
fluttering her fan with delight.&#xD;
"A flatterer because I have eyes to see&#xD;
that your hands are beautiful? You have&#xD;
eyes yourself, and you can't possibly think&#xD;
that."&#xD;
In this key the conversation proceeded&#xD;
for ten minutes. Mrs. Middleton went back&#xD;
to her letter philosophically. She had seen&#xD;
enough of modern society to lie little sur-&#xD;
prised by any thing which could be said or&#xD;
done by the most advanced thinkers. As for&#xD;
Max, let that man who has never yielded to&#xD;
the demands for admiration and the invitation&#xD;
to folly held out by a pretty, vain woman,&#xD;
throw the first stone at him. Partly to please&#xD;
his companion, partly to amuse himself, he&#xD;
&#xD;
went on heaping Pelion upon Ossa in the way&#xD;
of compliments, until at last-having ex-&#xD;
hausted his invention-it occurred to him to&#xD;
ask where Miss Grahame and Miss Desmond&#xD;
were.&#xD;
"Leslie drove, after breakfast, to Wexford,&#xD;
to do some shopping," Mrs. Sandford answered,&#xD;
"and Miss Desmond went with her. I really&#xD;
could not think of going! It is too horribly&#xD;
warm!"&#xD;
"Mr. Carl Middleton went with them, ~&#xD;
suppose?&#xD;
"No" (with a quick glance to see why&#xD;
he had asked the question). "I have no&#xD;
doubt he would have liked to do so-for it is&#xD;
really quite absurd to see how he is infatu-&#xD;
ated with Miss Desmond-but. his uncle in-&#xD;
sisted on his going with him to pay a visit to&#xD;
some i/elation in the neighborhood. What a&#xD;
bore relations are, are they not?"&#xD;
"Sometimes," answered Max, absently.&#xD;
He looked down on the hideous figures that&#xD;
covered a Japanese fan in his hand. He was&#xD;
thinking that he was glad Norah and Leslie&#xD;
were for once alone. It would give them an&#xD;
opportunity to know each other better; it&#xD;
would give the former, in especial, an oc-&#xD;
casion to test her sister's feelings with re-&#xD;
gard to Arthur Tyndale, to judge whether or&#xD;
not he had been right in the opinion which he&#xD;
had expressed, and the course he had urged.&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford caught the preoccupied tone&#xD;
in his voicr, and immediately set it down to&#xD;
the fact that he had just heard of Miss Des-&#xD;
mond's absence. Had he, then, come to see&#xD;
her? Instinctively the lady's mind went&#xD;
back to that three hours' absence on the lake&#xD;
yesterday-the absence which had been no&#xD;
more satisfactorily explained by Max than by&#xD;
Norah, Now, it may be said, once for all,&#xD;
that the pretty widow had no lendresse, likely&#xD;
to lead to tragedy or despair, for Captain&#xD;
Tyndale; but she was a woman insatiably&#xD;
fond of admiration, a woman who grasped at&#xD;
all opportunities for obtaining it, and relin-&#xD;
quished none. In Alton society Max had&#xD;
been something of a lion; in Alton society,&#xD;
also, he had been credited to her, if not ex-&#xD;
actly as a serious conquest, still as one of&#xD;
the admirers whom she always liked to keep&#xD;
fluttering around her-1men whom she did&#xD;
not wish or intend to marry, but with whom&#xD;
it was very good pastime to flirt. She had&#xD;
found it such very gooil pastime to flirt with&#xD;
a French chasseur-albeit the advances were&#xD;
&#xD;
mostly on her own side-that she had come&#xD;
down to Rosland simply to pursue that amuse-&#xD;
ment, and, if possible, to "break the poor&#xD;
man's heart" in the course of a few idle,&#xD;
summer weeks. It was a disappointment,&#xD;
therefore, that the poor man evinced very&#xD;
little desire to have his heart broken, even in&#xD;
the most scientific manner. This she saw&#xD;
sufficiently soon, and with sufficient plain.&#xD;
ness; ~but it is not in feminine nature-even&#xD;
of the most dove-like kind-to relinquish a&#xD;
possible, probable, or positive admirer with.&#xD;
out a struggle. Mrs. Sandford perceived, or&#xD;
thought she perceived, that Max had serious&#xD;
intentions of deserting her standard for that&#xD;
of the beautiful Bohemian, who had already&#xD;
secured the only other eligible admirer in the&#xD;
field, so she made up her mind to show him&#xD;
at once what kind of a game this beautiful&#xD;
Bohemian was playing.&#xD;
Max, still absorbed in the contempla-&#xD;
tion of his fan, and still thinking of what&#xD;
might be going on at that moment in Miss&#xD;
Grahame's phaeton, was a little surprised&#xD;
when a golden head-a head indebted to the&#xD;
chemist rather than to Nature for its gold-&#xD;
was bent toward him, and a sweet voice said,&#xD;
in a mysterious whisper:&#xD;
"4ake an excuse, please, for our going&#xD;
out. I have something very important which&#xD;
I must ask your advice about."' Then aloud,&#xD;
extending two wrists, slender and white&#xD;
enough to match the hands already compli-&#xD;
mented: "See how unlucky I have been! I&#xD;
lost one of my gold bands last night in the&#xD;
shrubbery, and no one has been able to find&#xD;
it yet. I am afraid no one will find it, though&#xD;
I have offered fabulous rewards to all the&#xD;
servants of the establishment. You don't&#xD;
know how I should dislike to lose one of&#xD;
these bands. They were poor Mr. Sandford's&#xD;
lastpresenttomeandthereforelwearthem&#xD;
all the time."&#xD;
Max thought that if he had any intention&#xD;
of succeeding poor Mr. Sandford, he should&#xD;
hope devoutly that the band might remain&#xD;
lost, and its fellow speedily follow it; but,&#xD;
since he had not the least aspiration that&#xD;
way, he cheerfully proposed-what its dis-&#xD;
consolate owner plainly desired-that they&#xD;
should go in search of it.&#xD;
"I always have wonderful luck," he said.&#xD;
"I don't think I ever looked for any thing&#xD;
that I did not find it; I am sure that I never&#xD;
laid a wager0 that I did not win it, nor sat&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
down to a gaming-table without rising suc-&#xD;
cessful."&#xD;
" Oh, you are just the person to find my&#xD;
bracelet then!i" cried she, clapping her hands&#xD;
in an artless fashion. " Let us go at once 1&#xD;
I shall not mind .the sun at all, if you will&#xD;
only wait until I get my hat and parasol." -&#xD;
As Max acceded to-this moderate request,&#xD;
she ranufrom the room in a tumult of enthu-&#xD;
siasma which would have done credit to the&#xD;
affectation of sixteen. ,&#xD;
"How very excitable Mrs. Sandford is !"&#xD;
said Mrs. Middleton, ar hing her brows in a&#xD;
manner inore significant~ than many words, as&#xD;
she looked up from the~letter she had finished&#xD;
aund was folding.&#xD;
"Very excitable, indeed !" answered Max,&#xD;
dryly.a Then he laughed, and added: " It is&#xD;
constitutionalwith some people, I suppose."&#xD;
The lady with whom excitement was con.-&#xD;
stitutional met him~ presently in the hall, ar-&#xD;
rayed in a hat which seemed fashioned for&#xD;
the especial purpose of affording no shade&#xD;
whatever to the face, and. armed with a club-.&#xD;
handled parasol, provided with fringe enough&#xD;
to leave a little on the branches of every tree&#xD;
and shrub in the grounds, add still have some&#xD;
to spare. -&#xD;
T : eaving athe house, they took their way&#xD;
directly to the shrubbery, where she proposed&#xD;
tod'show him dudctly the spot at which the&#xD;
hidelethad been lost.&#xD;
*"If you know exactly the spot, we may&#xD;
expect .to find it 'lying on the ground," he&#xD;
said.&#xD;
" Oh, I fear I am not so Exact ,as that,"&#xD;
answei-ed she,.shaking her head. "I looked&#xD;
for it, and Mr. Middleton looked for it, and&#xD;
my maid has spent the morning doing little&#xD;
eisc, so I fear even ydurn luck will scarcely be&#xD;
equal toiding it. I should not have brought&#xD;
you iutinto the sun simply on that account,"&#xD;
she added, " but you know I told you that I&#xD;
wanted to ask 'your advice about something&#xD;
yery important"&#xD;
"I reieniber, and I am all attention."&#xD;
"Let ua sit down here, thenn" pointing to&#xD;
a garden-scat in a sufficiently shaded position&#xD;
--" I never can :talk about any thing of par-'&#xD;
ticular interest-when I am walking."&#xD;
Max resigned himself to the situation&#xD;
with as much grace as most men manage to&#xD;
display in similar circumstances. He brushed&#xD;
off the seat with hia handkerchief', and they&#xD;
sat down; Mrs. Sandford arranged herself in&#xD;
&#xD;
a picturesque attitude, unfurled her fan, and&#xD;
lifted her eyes to his face.&#xD;
" If you could only know what I feel 1"&#xD;
she began, with a deprecation calculated to&#xD;
-disarm any thing like harsh judgment or crit-&#xD;
icism.&#xD;
" Is it absolutely necessary that I should&#xD;
know ?" asked Max. lie felt inclined to&#xD;
laugh, only he knew that such an offense&#xD;
would never be forgiven. There are some&#xD;
natures to whom ridicule is the unpardon-&#xD;
able sin. Already Mrs. Sandford looked at&#xD;
him a little suspiciously. The tone of his&#xD;
question did 'not please her.&#xD;
" It is not necessary," she answered, with&#xD;
a serious gravity, calculated to check all lev-&#xD;
ity-her eyes so wide open that hie began to&#xD;
amuse himself with a speculation as to wheth-&#xD;
er they could possibly expand any wider-&#xD;
'But if you could know you would under-&#xD;
stand the great reluctance I feel to saying any&#xD;
thing even to you ;' yet I am so uncertain&#xD;
about what I ought to do, and I am so anx-&#xD;
ious to do what is right--"&#xD;
.:(" What on earth does the woman mean ?"&#xD;
thought Mar. " Is she going to consult me&#xD;
about her will or her marriage ?")&#xD;
" It was so purely accidental," pursued&#xD;
she, dropping her eyes to her fan. "I had&#xD;
so little idea-not the least in the world, in&#xD;
fact--of any thing of the kind when I went&#xD;
into the library, or no earthly consideration&#xD;
would have induced me to go l "&#xD;
" Can it be the Dante she is talking&#xD;
about ?" thought Max, becoming. more thor-&#xD;
oughly puzzled every minute. Then aloud:&#xD;
" Really, Mrs. Sandfoird, I fearyou will think&#xD;
me very stupid,.bnt I have not as yet grasped&#xD;
your meaning at allt What was it that you&#xD;
had not the least idea of when you entered&#xD;
the library ?"&#xD;
" That Mr. 'Tyndale and Miss Desmond&#xD;
were on the terrace outside," answered she,&#xD;
lifting'-her eyes again, and looking directly at&#xD;
him,&#xD;
And, whether it was on account of the&#xD;
glance, or of the tone, or whethei- it was the&#xD;
significance of 'the words themselves, it is at&#xD;
least- certain that Captain. Tyndale started&#xD;
with a 'quick, nervous motion, foreign to his&#xD;
usual manner. Arthur and Miss Desmond&#xD;
on the terrace outside ! What had this fool-&#xD;
ish, fluttering widow overheard ?&#xD;
" Well," he said, trying to speak lightly,&#xD;
and not achieving a very striking success,&#xD;

" there was nothing remarkable in that fact,&#xD;
was there ? Mr. Tyndale and Miss Desmond&#xD;
had certainly a right to he on the terrace,&#xD;
had they not ?"                        ,&#xD;
." There was something very remarkable,&#xD;
I think," answered she, with marked empha-&#xD;
sis. " You would, have thought so, too, if&#xD;
you had overheard the declaration which I&#xD;
-in the most accidental manner in the world&#xD;
-overheard Mr. Tyndale make before I had&#xD;
been in the library five minutes."&#xD;
" A declaration !" repeated Max. He put&#xD;
up his hand to his mustache, which was a&#xD;
very real and present help to him in times&#xD;
of embarrassment. " There are a great many&#xD;
different kinds of declarations," he added,&#xD;
after a minute-a very lame, and certainly&#xD;
not a very brilliantly diplomatic conclusion.&#xD;
" Certainlyy" said Mrs. Sandford, in a tone&#xD;
of petulant satire, "I am perfectly well aware&#xD;
of that. There are declarations of war and&#xD;
declarations of peace, and declarations of&#xD;
love. Mr. Tyndale's declaration, as it chanced,&#xD;
belonged to the latter class."&#xD;
" To declarations of love !" repeated Max,&#xD;
starting again.. "You-pardon me, but you&#xD;
must be mistaken ! It is impossible !"&#xD;
" Unfortunately, it is so !" said she, em-&#xD;
phatically. " Never, in all my life, have I&#xD;
heard a declaration made more plainly. He&#xD;
said, as clearly as possible, that he had made&#xD;
a great and terrible mistake, that he did not&#xD;
love Leslie, and that he did love Miss Des-.&#xD;
mond passionately. That was his expression&#xD;
-passionately!/"&#xD;
" Indeed !" said Max. He was so taken&#xD;
by storm, as it were, that for .a minute he&#xD;
forgot that he had any part to play, or any&#xD;
secret to guard. His bronzed skin changed&#xD;
color quickly, and the expanding flash of his&#xD;
eye fairly startled her. " Arg you in ear-&#xD;
nest ? ' he asked, after a minute, and his&#xD;
voice seemed to lower and quiet strangely.&#xD;
" Did you hear Arthur say that ?"&#xD;
" Yes, I heard him say that -- exactly&#xD;
that !" answered she, gratified, according to&#xD;
a curious instinct of human nature, at the&#xD;
sensation she had caused. " But, indeed "--&#xD;
mindful of the special object she had in view&#xD;
-" I do not think one ought to blame Mr.&#xD;
Tyndale very much. You men are so foolish !&#xD;
--you will saiy any thing when a certain kind&#xD;
of woman leads you on ! Now, although I&#xD;
did not overhear very much "-she did not&#xD;
add that this was not her fault or her merit&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
-"I heard enough to tell me that Miss Des-&#xD;
mond had led him on."&#xD;
"Are yout sure of that ? ' asked Max. lie&#xD;
looked at her keenly. Much as he distrusted&#xD;
Norah, he just then distrusted this fair, im-&#xD;
pulsive, silvery - tongued being still more.&#xD;
" Did Miss Desmond exhibit no indignation&#xD;
at such a declaration from a man who is .en-&#xD;
gaged to her sister " he added, after a mo-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
Still wider opened the blue eyes, and the&#xD;
carefully - darkened eyebrows arched them-&#xD;
selves.&#xD;
" Indignation ! I do not think Miss Des-&#xD;
mond dreamed of such a thing, I am sure she&#xD;
did not show it. I did not hear much more&#xD;
than Mr. Tyndale's declaration; however, for&#xD;
just then I unfortunately threw down the&#xD;
Dante, and that ended the love-scene."&#xD;
." The love-scene 1" repeated Max, sternly,&#xD;
and his brows knit themselves into a quick&#xD;
frown. "Do you mean that you can apply&#xD;
such a term as that to any thing which took&#xD;
place ?"&#xD;
" I scarcely know what other term it&#xD;
would be possible to apply. Romeo was not&#xD;
more passionate than Mr. Tyndale, though&#xD;
Miss Desmond seemed less demonstrative,&#xD;
and struck me rather in the light of a person&#xD;
,who was playing a cool, steady game of some&#xD;
kind."-&#xD;
" So she is !" he muttered.&#xD;
Those last words went further toward re-&#xD;
moving his doubts of the story thatn any&#xD;
thing else had done. They at least were&#xD;
true. Norah was playing a cool, steady game,&#xD;
of which not even he could flatter himself&#xD;
that he saw the end. He could fancy just/&#xD;
how she had listened to Arthur's madness-&#xD;
the madness which had put every thing which&#xD;
he most wished to keep secret into the hands&#xD;
of a "prying eavesdropper," as Captain Tyn-&#xD;
dale did not hesitate to call his fair coinpan-&#xD;
ion in the sacred recesses of his thoughts.&#xD;
." It is very evident that Miss Desmond is&#xD;
one of 'those women who cannot live without&#xD;
the admiration and adulation of every man&#xD;
they meet," said Mrs. i~andford, after a while,&#xD;
in a virtuous tone. " But it is very strange&#xD;
and ver'y dreadf'ul-something I cannot under-&#xD;
stand--that she should desire to obtain the&#xD;
affections and attentions of the man to whom&#xD;
her sister is engaged !"&#xD;
"Such wavering affections are worth very&#xD;
little !" said Max, bitterly.&#xD;

"But, of course, Leslie world not feel&#xD;
that way," answered she, eagerly. "And do&#xD;
you know it is about tAct I wanted to consult&#xD;
you-shall I tell Leslie? Of course, it would&#xD;
be a ~very painful thing to do; but still, if it&#xD;
were right-"&#xD;
"Good Heavens, no!" cried he, fairly&#xD;
aghast. "It would be a terrible blow to come&#xD;
upon her without any preparation. Let me&#xD;
beg you most earnestly not to think of such a&#xD;
thing!"&#xD;
"I will not-indeed I will not!" said she,&#xD;
hastily. "I determined when I was consid-&#xD;
ering the matter last night-I really could not&#xD;
sleep on account of it-that I would ask&#xD;
you what to do, and take your advice. I&#xD;
promise you that I will not say a word to&#xD;
Leslie.''&#xD;
"Thank you," said he, cordially. Then,&#xD;
after a second's pause, he added: "I agree&#xD;
with you that it is hard for any one like&#xD;
Miss Grahame to be deceived in this manner&#xD;
-a manner which I cannot trust myself to&#xD;
characterize either as regards her lover or her&#xD;
sister-but our first duty is to think of her,&#xD;
and I-if you will allow me, I should like to&#xD;
examine this matter further before I decide&#xD;
to let her hear the truth."&#xD;
"Oh! I shall be so glad if you zeill take&#xD;
all responsibility off my hands," cried she,&#xD;
eagerly. "It was what I hoped you would&#xD;
do! I know how much you admire Leslie;&#xD;
and then you are such a friend of Mr. Tyn-&#xD;
dale's that I am sure you will endeavor to&#xD;
show him what Miss Desmond's true charac-&#xD;
ter must be. I confess I shudder when I&#xD;
think of her "-the shudder came in play in&#xD;
the most striking and artistic manner-" her&#xD;
conduct shows such an utter want of the&#xD;
commonest sentiments of honor. But, then,&#xD;
what else was to be expected from her rear-&#xD;
ing? Oh, what a pity that Leslie should&#xD;
ever, ever have brought her here!"&#xD;
IfCaptain Tyndale did not echo these sen-&#xD;
timents entirely, he at least agreed with them&#xD;
in a measure. Norah had most gratuitously&#xD;
played him false, he thought. With her as-&#xD;
sumption of frankness, her outspoken scorn&#xD;
and contempt for Arthur Tyndale, she had&#xD;
made him believe in her thoroughly; and all&#xD;
the time she was ready to listen to passionate&#xD;
protestations of devotion from the man she&#xD;
affected to despise, the man who was engaged&#xD;
to her sister! It may be said for Max that&#xD;
he would not have been likely to give implicit&#xD;
&#xD;
credence to Mrs. Sandford's narrative, if other&#xD;
proofs had not confirmed it. But something&#xD;
in the expression of Arthur's face and Arthur's&#xD;
tone when he had spoken the night before of&#xD;
her presence in the library-that presence&#xD;
which the broken bust of Dante attested-&#xD;
came back to him like a ray of light. This&#xD;
was what it meant: There had been a "love-&#xD;
scene" on the terrace with Norah-with No-&#xD;
rnh, who an hour before had uttered such bit-&#xD;
ter words of Arthur and Arthur's love! Well,&#xD;
there could be no doubt Mrs. Sandford was&#xD;
right-that she was integrally false. After&#xD;
all, was it remarkable? Could any thing else&#xD;
be expected from a girl whose life had been&#xD;
spent among the adventurers and adven-&#xD;
turesses of Bohemia? Perhaps she was bent&#xD;
on a bolder stroke than he had even fancied&#xD;
-perhaps she meant to lead Arthur back&#xD;
into the chains og the old infatuation, and&#xD;
then make him marry her! How easily this&#xD;
might be accomplished, Max scarcely ven-&#xD;
tured to acknowledge to himself. lie felt&#xD;
that there was nothing in Arthui~s character&#xD;
on which, in any emergency, it was possible&#xD;
to rely. What could be predicated with safe-&#xD;
ty of a man who, in open disregard of his&#xD;
plighted faith, averred that he loved "pas-&#xD;
sionately" a woman whom he had only men-&#xD;
tioned in tones of contemptuous repugnance&#xD;
a month before? Thinking of him, Max felt&#xD;
that hopelessness which we have many of us&#xD;
known in similar cases. With a person, how-&#xD;
ever bad, who possesses any thing like sta-&#xD;
bility, it may be possible to Isnow, after a&#xD;
fashion, what to do; but, with one whose&#xD;
opinions, feelings, and resolves, are like the&#xD;
yielding sand, he must be a sage, indeed, who&#xD;
can resolve upon any fixed course of action.&#xD;
Pondering such thoughts as these, Cap-&#xD;
tainTyndale walked by Mrs. Sandford's side to&#xD;
the house-the sun having at last forced them&#xD;
to abandon their position-and it was like an&#xD;
echo of, or a commentary upon, his train of&#xD;
reflection when the first person whom he saw&#xD;
on entering the drawing.room was Norah Des.&#xD;
mond. Leslie was there, also, and Mrs. Mid.&#xD;
dieton, but it was in the nature of things that&#xD;
the eye should fall first on Miss Desmond.&#xD;
If two or two hundred other women were in&#xD;
the room, she attracted the gaze as naturally&#xD;
and involuntarily as a ray of sunlight or a&#xD;
brilliant flower.&#xD;
Yet it must not be supposed that there&#xD;
was any thing brilliant or flower-like in her&#xD;
&#xD;
costume, which was singularly simple as a&#xD;
general rule, avoiding all bizarre effects, even&#xD;
such as are sanctioned in this heyday of&#xD;
bizarre modes. She was evidently determined&#xD;
that nobody should say there was any thing&#xD;
" Bohemian" in her taste. And it was sur-&#xD;
prising-it was like a revelation to eyes only&#xD;
accustomed to overloaded women - to see&#xD;
how this simplicity of attire enhanced her&#xD;
really extraordinary beauty. Indeed, Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford confided to her maid, in the deep&#xD;
injury of her soul, that it was on this account&#xD;
Miss Desmond dressed so plainly-that she&#xD;
wore few flounces, and still fewer ornaments.&#xD;
"She wants to show that she ecu do it!"&#xD;
the acute lady said. "Poverty may havc&#xD;
something to say in the matter, but affecta-&#xD;
tion has still more!"&#xD;
Whatever were Norah's reasons, there&#xD;
certainly was no question of her success in&#xD;
an aesthetic point of view. Just now Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford looked like an overdressed doll, in&#xD;
all her purple and white glories, by the side of&#xD;
the other's plain morning-dress, unrelieved by&#xD;
any thing more than a bit of black velvet&#xD;
tied rouiid her throat. No pendant, no ear-&#xD;
rin"s, no sash, no "any thing," Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford would have said, except exquisite fresh-&#xD;
ness and artistic simplicity. Max looked up-&#xD;
on her, and his eye was so well satisfied with&#xD;
seeing that, by a masculine result of mascu~-&#xD;
line logic, he began to ask himself if it were&#xD;
possible that this beautiful, stately creature&#xD;
was, indeed, the consummate actress and&#xD;
scheming adventuress which circumstances&#xD;
seemed to indicate. He certainly would have&#xD;
been something more or less than man if he&#xD;
could have resisted the sunlight of the smile&#xD;
with which she presently turned to him.&#xD;
"We have beefs talking of you, Captain&#xD;
Tyndale-Leslie and I," she said. "Have&#xD;
your ears been burning at all' this morning?"&#xD;
"They have been too much engaged in&#xD;
listening," he answered, walking over to where&#xD;
she sat. "I have been in the shrubbery with&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford, and-have your ears given you&#xD;
warning that you were a topic of conversation,&#xD;
Miss Desmond?"&#xD;
"No," she answered, quietly; but she&#xD;
looked up at him as he stood, tall and straight,&#xD;
before her, with a sudden flash of intelligence&#xD;
in her eye, which shoved him that she under-&#xD;
stood at once what he meant. It was' not&#xD;
likely that she had forgotten Mrs. Sandford's&#xD;
presence in the library the evening before,&#xD;
&#xD;
and she possessed none of Mr. Tyndale's fa-&#xD;
cility for believing just that which was the&#xD;
least trouble and the most agreeable to be-&#xD;
lieve.&#xD;
"We have been talking of you-Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford and I," repeated Max, impressed al-&#xD;
most against his will by the clear frankness&#xD;
of her glance, the utter want of any shade of&#xD;
detected guilt on her face. "And, if you do&#xD;
not object, I should like to ask some expla-&#xD;
nation of a story which she has been good&#xD;
enough to tell ~&#xD;
She looked at him steadily for a minute&#xD;
before she answered; then another quick,&#xD;
bright smile came over her face.&#xD;
"You go to your point very directly," she&#xD;
said. "I like that. It answers better, with&#xD;
some people, than the diplomacy of a Talley-&#xD;
rand. Yes, Captain Tyndale, I will give you&#xD;
a full explanation of whatever story you may&#xD;
have heard, because you have thought well&#xD;
enough of me to come and ask for it like a&#xD;
man of honor."&#xD;
Captain Tyndale winced, a little at this.&#xD;
Half an hour before he certainly had not&#xD;
"thought well" of her; but there was some-&#xD;
thing magnetic about this woman. Let him&#xD;
doubt or distrust her as he might out of her&#xD;
presence, he could not do so in it; he could&#xD;
not bear the clear ring of her voice, or meet&#xD;
the frank glance of her eye, and say, "This is&#xD;
falsehood!"&#xD;
"Will you tell me now?" he asked, eager-&#xD;
ly. "Shall we go~out on the veranda? I do&#xD;
not think we are likely to be disturbed."&#xD;
But, even as lie spoke, Mr. Middleton and&#xD;
Carl entered the room, and the latter at once&#xD;
came over to Norah. A few minutes later&#xD;
they went to luncheon, and all hope of an im-&#xD;
mediate explanation was at an end.&#xD;
At luncheon Captain Tyndale found that&#xD;
there was a social engagement on hand for&#xD;
the afternoon.&#xD;
"We have to go over to the Covingtons&#xD;
to play croquet," Leslie told him. "It is&#xD;
very tiresome, but they made such a point of&#xD;
it I scarcely like to disappoint them. What&#xD;
a barbarous idea it is to have afternoon&#xD;
amusements in summer, is it not? I think&#xD;
the afternoon should always be sacred to one's&#xD;
sie2ta."&#xD;
"A croquet-party will at least have the&#xD;
merit of novelty to me," said Carl. "1 have&#xD;
heard of the game very often, but I have never&#xD;
seen it."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="102-103" xml:id="VAC8066-00000060"/>&#xD;
102                A IPAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.                                                     MISCHIEF-MAKING.                   103&#xD;
&#xD;
"Never seen it!"&#xD;
A note of admiration poorly expresses&#xD;
the tone in which those three words were&#xD;
echoed round the table.&#xD;
"Never seen it! We could not have im-&#xD;
agined such depth of ignorance, even in Ger-&#xD;
many," said Mrs. Sandford.&#xD;
Max laughed, and raised a glass of wine&#xD;
to his lips.&#xD;
"Happy man I" ho said. "We drink to&#xD;
your continued ignorance."&#xD;
"I am not sure that I desire it to con-&#xD;
tinue," said Carl. "A man might as well&#xD;
know a little of every thing. Something like&#xD;
billiards, isn't it?"&#xD;
This remark was addressed to the company&#xD;
in general.&#xD;
"Like billiards!" repeated Leslie. "'As&#xD;
moonlight is to sunlight, or as water unto&#xD;
wine,' or as the weakest tea you can imagine&#xD;
to good champagne."&#xD;
"A more tiresome thing never was in-&#xD;
vented," said Mrs. Sandford, with unction.&#xD;
"Why do you all play it, then?" asked&#xD;
Norah, also addressing the company. "When&#xD;
one has to submit to being bored in a case&#xD;
of necessity or duty, I can stand it as well as&#xD;
any other woman or man, but, when it is bor-&#xD;
ing, pure and simple, and you call it amuse-&#xD;
ment, I cannot see the sense of it."&#xD;
"Nor I," said Carl. "I never could."&#xD;
"Unfortunately, we cannot help our-&#xD;
selves," said Mrs. Middleton "There are&#xD;
certain social amusements which are social&#xD;
duties. If one shirks them, one must give&#xD;
up society altogether."&#xD;
"But do you really find no pleasure in&#xD;
your social gatherings?" asked the young Bo-&#xD;
hemiari, curiously. "How strange that you&#xD;
should continue to call them 'amusements,'&#xD;
then! I should be honest, and say 'bores' at&#xD;
once."&#xD;
"How very evident it is that Miss Des-&#xD;
mo~d has never been in society!" said Mrs.&#xD;
Sandfdrd, with her rippling laugh. "What&#xD;
would she think if she had gone through the&#xD;
exhaustion of two or tikree seasons, I won-&#xD;
"I should probably think that I was much&#xD;
the worse for wear in every particular," an-&#xD;
swered Miss Desmond, quietly.&#xD;
This was such a keen home-thrust-since&#xD;
evei~ybody who had known Mrs. Sandford in&#xD;
her first youth was so thoroughly conscious&#xD;
that eke was the worse for wear-that Leslie&#xD;
&#xD;
turned the course of conversation at once by&#xD;
addressing Max.&#xD;
"Can you not come with us this after-&#xD;
noon?" she asked. "You know that the&#xD;
Covingtons would be very glad to see you."&#xD;
"I hope you have not forgotten that you&#xD;
have an engagement to drive with me this&#xD;
afternoon," said Carl, speaking quickly to&#xD;
Norah. "The croquet-party need not inter.&#xD;
fere with it, for I can drive you over to the&#xD;
Covington place."&#xD;
"No, thanks," said Max to Leslie. "You&#xD;
are very kind, and so would the Covingtons&#xD;
be, but I really cannot agree with Mr. Mid.&#xD;
dieton in thinking that croquet is either&#xD;
worth knowing, or-if one has the misfortune&#xD;
to know it after a fashiontworth playing.&#xD;
I shall go back to Strafford~and see how Ar.&#xD;
thur is coming on."*&#xD;
He had not gone back to Strafford, how.&#xD;
ever, when the carriages-c0nsisting of Les-&#xD;
lie's phaeton and Carl's new dog-cart-drove&#xD;
to the door, and the three ladies, in their&#xD;
pretty croquet costumes, came down-stairs.&#xD;
"How neatly I settled that fellow!" said&#xD;
Carl, looking at Captain Tyndale as they&#xD;
drove off~ "Did you notice how he paused&#xD;
and glanced at you when Leslie asked him if&#xD;
he would not come with us? He would have&#xD;
said 'yes' in a minute if I had not showed&#xD;
him that I had a prior claim upon your time&#xD;
and attention."&#xD;
"How exceedingly foolish you are!" said&#xD;
Norali, with delightful candor. "It is really&#xD;
astonishing to see how completely you disre-&#xD;
gard such trifles as fact at~d reason. If Cap-&#xD;
tain Tyndale looked at me when Leslie spoke&#xD;
to him, it was doubtless in much the same&#xD;
way that you look at your horse when I speak&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
"It is impossible but that you must see&#xD;
that the man is ready to make a complete&#xD;
fool of himself about you!" said Carl, with&#xD;
jealous and not particularly lucid energy.&#xD;
"It is perfectly possible that I see noth-&#xD;
ing of the kind," she an~wcred. "Neither&#xD;
would you, if your eyes ha~ not a glamour of&#xD;
absurdity over them. If ~~ou must know the&#xD;
truth," she added, impatiently, "you might&#xD;
have seen it for yourself~-.-by-the-way, Cap-&#xD;
tain Tyndale is in love with Leslie."&#xD;
"In love with Lesli~l" repeated he, in a&#xD;
tone of incredulity, turning to look into her&#xD;
face. "You-you are not in earnest?"&#xD;
"I am entirely in earnest," she answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
"He is certainly in love with Leslie; and I&#xD;
think" (this very deliberately) "that he&#xD;
would suit her infinitely better than his ac-&#xD;
complished cousin will ever do."&#xD;
"Do you?" said Carl. "But that is for&#xD;
Leslie to judge, is it not? Unless, indeed-"&#xD;
Here he broke off abruptly. A sudden&#xD;
strain of new suspicion darted into his mind.&#xD;
There is something really inexhaustible in the&#xD;
versatility of jealousy-something that can&#xD;
freshly amaze every day and every hour even&#xD;
those who have had most cause to know and&#xD;
best opportunity to study that remarkable&#xD;
passion. It may be said that this was just&#xD;
now the master-passion of Carl Middleton's&#xD;
life. Feeding his love for Norah day by day&#xD;
on the magic of her presence, he had fed his&#xD;
tormentor also on the words and smiles which&#xD;
she g~ve so freely to others, until he was&#xD;
ready to believe any thing, to see any thing,&#xD;
to fancy any thing, that might tend to add to&#xD;
his discomfort, however improbable it might&#xD;
intrinsically be.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Mrs. Sandford was doing a&#xD;
little mischief-making on a small scale with&#xD;
Leslie. She was too mindful of her promise&#xD;
to Max, to attempt any thing of the kind on&#xD;
a great scale; but the desire to meddle and&#xD;
to talk, to advise wisely or to hint what she&#xD;
was not allowed to confide, was too much for&#xD;
her-as it has been too much for many an-&#xD;
other woman since the days of Eve. If she&#xD;
did not venture to disregard entirely the em-&#xD;
bargo which had been laid upon her tongue,&#xD;
it was not because she attached any particu-&#xD;
lar binding significance to a promise, but&#xD;
rather because ~he was not prepared to brave&#xD;
the anger which she knew Max would feel, or&#xD;
to sacrifice the advantage she had gained by&#xD;
discreet confidence and appeal. She began,&#xD;
therefore, on the outskirts of the subject, be-&#xD;
gan discursively to talk of Miss Desmond,&#xD;
expressing herself with all the moderation&#xD;
and good sense which usually characterized&#xD;
her conversation:&#xD;
"So charming, so beautiful, with such a&#xD;
peculiar gift of fascination !" she said. "I&#xD;
never knew before what a real enchantress&#xD;
a woman can be - an enchantress such as&#xD;
one reads of, you know. Miss Desmond&#xD;
seems to possess such a peculiar attraction&#xD;
for men! I have never seen any thing like it."&#xD;
"I am afraid Carl is more in love with&#xD;
her than is good for him," said Leslie, flick-&#xD;
ing Romulus and Remus lightly with the&#xD;
&#xD;
whip. "But I am not aware that she has&#xD;
displayed her conquering talent with regard&#xD;
to any one else as yet."&#xD;
"That is because you have not observed,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Sandford, with a shako of the head.&#xD;
"If you had- But I think there is nothing&#xD;
more beautiful than that perfect and implicit&#xD;
trust which you scene to feel in every one you&#xD;
love."&#xD;
"I certainly could not love any one whom&#xD;
I was forced to suspect," answered Leslie,&#xD;
flushing. "If you are speaking of Norab&#xD;
"My dear, I am not speaking of anybody&#xD;
-that is, of anybody in particular," inter-&#xD;
rupted the other, quickly, "Of course, it is&#xD;
no affair of mine. I am, unfortunately, too&#xD;
observant-I see and know too much. I of-&#xD;
ten feel as if I would give any thing to have&#xD;
your delightful repose and confidence."&#xD;
"You are right in saying that I trust im-&#xD;
plicitly those whom I love," said Miss Gra-&#xD;
hame, with some lzasetczer-for it is slightly&#xD;
trying to be politely accused of obtuse stu-&#xD;
pidity-" but, with regard to other people, I&#xD;
am not conscious of wearing a bandage over&#xD;
my eyes. I make no very great claim ~to&#xD;
worldly acumen, but I think I can ~see as&#xD;
clearly as most of my fellows."&#xD;
"I never implied or meant to imply for a&#xD;
moment that you wore a bandage over your&#xD;
eyes," said Mrs. Sandford, with the sweetest&#xD;
conciliation. "I only meant that you are&#xD;
blind-quite blind-where your affections are&#xD;
concerned. You acknowledge that yourself."&#xD;
"Not that I am blind, but that I do not&#xD;
suspect readily. There is a distinction be-&#xD;
tween the two things."&#xD;
"Is there? I suppose I am very stupid,&#xD;
but I really eanuot see it. It seems to me&#xD;
that one is blind if one does not suspect when&#xD;
one is deceived, for instance."&#xD;
"When one is deceived!" Something in&#xD;
the tone which uttered those words-a scarce-&#xD;
ly-veiled significance and meaning - ~truek&#xD;
with a cold chill to Leslie's heart. She felt&#xD;
suddenly that Mrs. Sandford was not talking&#xD;
at random, that she had a particular object&#xD;
in view, and that her words pointed like ar-&#xD;
rows directly toward that object. If Miss&#xD;
Grahame had followed her impulse, she would&#xD;
have turned authoritatively and said, "What&#xD;
do you mean? For Heaven's sake, speak&#xD;
plainly!" But she was a woman of sufficient&#xD;
worldly experience to know that such an im-&#xD;
pulse was not a wise one. To bid some pee-&#xD;

104                      A DAI~TGHTER&#xD;
ple speak plainly is simply to offer them a&#xD;
premium for further innuendo and mystery.&#xD;
"Of course if one is deceived, one may&#xD;
desire and should endeavor to know it," she&#xD;
said, after a minute. "Self-respect-which&#xD;
is often, however, merely another name for&#xD;
selfishness-teaches that much, at least."&#xD;
"But if one does not suspect - if one&#xD;
does not open one's eyes and look, how can&#xD;
one know?" asked Mrs. Sandford, more&#xD;
meaningly than ever. Just then she felt so&#xD;
much sincere compassion for Miss Grahame,&#xD;
that it required her strongest thoughts ~f&#xD;
Captain Tyndale to refrain from telling the&#xD;
whole truth, as she conceived it.&#xD;
Leslie looked at her with a half-pathetic&#xD;
keenness in her soft gray eyes.&#xD;
"I would not turn away from any proof&#xD;
of deception which came to me," she said,&#xD;
gravely, "but I would never lower myself&#xD;
sufficiently to go in search of it."&#xD;
"Oh, my dear, lam sure you never would!"&#xD;
cried the other, who began to think she had&#xD;
gone far enough. She had put Leslie on her&#xD;
guard, and she had not broken faith with&#xD;
Max. While congratulating herself on the&#xD;
diplomacy which had secured both these ends,&#xD;
she felt that this was the golden moment in&#xD;
which to retreat. Enough (for her purpose)&#xD;
had been said, and not too much: another&#xD;
word might involve her in the necessity of&#xD;
an explanation, and spoil all. "I am sure&#xD;
you never would I" she i-epeated. "I al-&#xD;
ways thought you had the keenest sense of&#xD;
honor I have ever known in any one. How 1&#xD;
strange it is to consider how unlike the near-&#xD;
eat relations may be!" (This hint was so&#xD;
tempting,.that she could not resist throwing&#xD;
it in.) "By-the~.by, do tell me if there is no&#xD;
talk of any of these Oovington girls being&#xD;
married? Do they mean to grow into a whole&#xD;
houeeful of old maids?"&#xD;
The conversation was easily turned in this&#xD;
way-for Leslie was too proud to make any&#xD;
effort to continue a subject which the other&#xD;
evidently wished to drop-but Mrs. Sandford&#xD;
was safe in thinking that she had sowed a&#xD;
seed which was destined to ripen int9 fruit,&#xD;
and worked mischief not likely to pass harm-&#xD;
lessly away.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
"A woman is a foreign land,&#xD;

ON the evening of the same day, dinner&#xD;
was over at Rosland, the lights were turned&#xD;
low in the drawing-room, and the party-&#xD;
somewhat tired and languid after their cro-&#xD;
quet-were assembled on the veranda, when&#xD;
Arthur Tyndale came across the lawn in the&#xD;
shadowy moonlight and joined them.&#xD;
They were a little surprised to see him,&#xD;
and he had to run a gantlet of inquiries about&#xD;
his indispositionn," all of which he answered&#xD;
with remarkable brevity, and then dropped&#xD;
into a seat under the shadow of the vines by&#xD;
Leslie's side.&#xD;
"I am sorry to hear you have been un-&#xD;
well," she said, in her tender voice-a voice&#xD;
which sounded like a C minor chord in mu-&#xD;
sic-" has it really been serious? Do you&#xD;
think the fishing yesterday had any thing to&#xD;
do with it?"&#xD;
"It has not been in the least serious," he&#xD;
answered, in a tone of subdued irritation.&#xD;
"A little headache-nothing of any impor-&#xD;
tance. I cannot imagine what induced Max&#xD;
to say that I was ill."&#xD;
"He did not say that you were ill-only&#xD;
unwell."&#xD;
"But I was not even unwell-lazy would&#xD;
have been much nearer the truth. This weath-&#xD;
er pulls one down horribly," he added, impa-&#xD;
tiently. "I have almost made up my mind&#xD;
not to leave the house again while the sun is&#xD;
above the horizon.&#xD;
"Have you?" said Leslie. She did not&#xD;
say any thing more, for, like a flash, it oc-&#xD;
curred to her that, if Arthur discontinued the&#xD;
morning visits which he had paid ever since&#xD;
her arrival, at Rosland, it would effectually&#xD;
put an end to all their private interviews.&#xD;
She was too fastidious in taste and breeding&#xD;
to withdraw from the circle of the evening in&#xD;
any marked manner, and there are few of us&#xD;
who have not learned that the intercourse of&#xD;
two people, in which half a dozen others&#xD;
more or less participate, is rarely satisfacto-&#xD;

AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT.             107&#xD;
&#xD;
106               A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
somebody do something for the general amuse-&#xD;
ment ?-Miss Desmond, won't yougo and sing&#xD;
forus?"&#xD;
"Pray do, Miss Desmond," said Mrs. Mid-&#xD;
dleton, courteously~ It was the best thing&#xD;
this lady knew of Norab, that she could sing.&#xD;
Miss Desmond yielded without demur-&#xD;
she was unusually quiet this evening, more&#xD;
than one Qf the party remarked-and, as she&#xD;
rose to enter the drawing-room, Tyndale rose&#xD;
also, somewhat to Leslie's surprise, greatly&#xD;
to Carl's indignation, and followed her.&#xD;
Being in advance, Norali was not aware&#xD;
of his presence until she reached the piano.&#xD;
Then, turning to say, "What shall I sing?"&#xD;
she found herself facing hi'm instead of Carl,&#xD;
as she expected.          -&#xD;
She started a little, a flush which he knew&#xD;
to be one of anger rose to her face, and her&#xD;
lips enclosed impetuously. But sometimes it&#xD;
is possible to pause in the very act of utter-&#xD;
ance, and so Norah paused now. The reason&#xD;
of this was not far to seek. She had caught&#xD;
a glimpse of the bald top of Mr. Middleton's&#xD;
head, and, although several audible sounds&#xD;
indicative of slumber were proceeding from&#xD;
his nose, she was too cautious a woman to&#xD;
utter aloud the haughty words of impatience&#xD;
trembling on her tongue.&#xD;
"I thought you were Mr. Middleton," she&#xD;
said, with a quietness that amazed Tyndale;&#xD;
for he did nctsee the bald head or hear the&#xD;
sounds which it would have been an insult to&#xD;
call snoring.&#xD;
"I thought that I might venture to conic&#xD;
instead of Mr. Middleton," he answered, un-&#xD;
certain whether to augur good or ill from her&#xD;
sudden change of manner. "You asked what&#xD;
you should sing," he went on, quickly. "May&#xD;
I answer that question? May I say that I&#xD;
should like of all things to hear once again&#xD;
that little German song which you sang-do&#xD;
you remember?-that night at Coblents to&#xD;
which I alluded a little while ago?"&#xD;
"I remember," said Norah.&#xD;
She looked at him intently, almost curi-&#xD;
ously, as she spoke. Of what was this man&#xD;
made, that he ventured to brave her like this?&#xD;
Was he mad that he, who had every reason to&#xD;
conciliate her (if such a thing could be done),&#xD;
instead brought&amp;amp; forward memories which&#xD;
might have hardened the heart and strength-&#xD;
ened the resolution of a far less proud and&#xD;
passionate woman? It is impossible to say&#xD;
whether she felt most contempt or puzzled&#xD;
&#xD;
indignation as she stood looking at him with&#xD;
her keen, brilliant glance, but it is at least&#xD;
certain that she understood him far better&#xD;
than he understood her when she answered&#xD;
at last.&#xD;
"You mean the little German ballad called&#xD;
'The Pledge?'" she asked. "Yes, I wiU sing&#xD;
it for you-that is, if I can remember it. I&#xD;
do not think I have sung it since that night&#xD;
at Coblentz, when I sat on the balcony with&#xD;
one who was to leave the next day, and&#xD;
watched the moon go down behind the vine-&#xD;
clad hills, with the voice of the Rhine in our&#xD;
ears."&#xD;
"My God! how I remember it all!" he&#xD;
said, passionately; but, as he spoke, a warn-&#xD;
ing glance in her eye made him stop short.&#xD;
"Will you go yonder, across the room,&#xD;
and look for my fan on one of those tables?"&#xD;
she said, quickly.&#xD;
While he obeyed, she sat down to the&#xD;
piano, and, when he came back, a single&#xD;
glance at his face showed her that lie had&#xD;
seen Mr. Middleton.&#xD;
She smiled, and, secure from any further&#xD;
allusion to the past, it may be that she was&#xD;
not averse to showing him her indifference&#xD;
to it.&#xD;
"This is the song yen mean, is it not?"&#xD;
she asked, striking a few chords, and then&#xD;
beginning to sing.&#xD;
It was a very beautiful ballad, though sufil-&#xD;
ciently simple in subject and execution-only&#xD;
a pledge of faith which a maiden gave her&#xD;
lover when they parted-but the theme was&#xD;
treated as only the Germans know how to&#xD;
treat such a theme, lifting, it out of the region&#xD;
of commonplace into the realm of pure artistic&#xD;
simplicity.&#xD;
Norah sang it exquisitely, with a pathos&#xD;
and sweetness which thrilled even those who&#xD;
were gathered on the veranda in the moon-&#xD;
light.&#xD;
"How charming!" cried Mrs. Sandford,&#xD;
"and with how much expression Miss Desmond&#xD;
is singing !-You understand German" (this&#xD;
to Carl); "tell us what it is about."&#xD;
"It is the promise of a girl to be faithful&#xD;
through all things to her lover," he answered&#xD;
-a coldness and constraint in his voice which&#xD;
it was impossible for him to disguise.&#xD;
"Oh I" said Mrs. Sandford~ To do her&#xD;
justice, she uttered that long-drawn exclama-&#xD;
tion involuntarily. It was little more than a&#xD;
thought spoken aloud. "How pretty such&#xD;
&#xD;
promises always are-in poetry and music,"&#xD;
she added, after a minute, "and how pretty&#xD;
Miss flesmond looks while she sings it! '&#xD;
"When does not Miss Desmond look&#xD;
pretty?" asked Carl, in a sharp, quick tone,&#xD;
full of mingled tenderness and jealousy, which&#xD;
was any thing but soothing to the ears or the&#xD;
feelings of Mrs. Middleton.&#xD;
He rose, as he spoke, from his own scat,&#xD;
and crossed over to where Mrs. Sandford was&#xD;
sitting, just outside one of the open windows.&#xD;
It was like looking at a picture to stand there&#xD;
in the fragrant darkness, and gaze down the&#xD;
the long room, with its mirrors, and paintings,&#xD;
and polished floor, to where Norah sat at the&#xD;
piano in her filmy white des~, with one scar-&#xD;
let flower glowing on her breast, another in&#xD;
the rich masses of her hair-only Carl was&#xD;
not cxaptly in that calm, msthetic frame of&#xD;
mind necessary for the appreciation of a work&#xD;
of art. He did not take in the general effect&#xD;
of the scene; his eyes were fastened on the&#xD;
face which just then wore its most lustrous&#xD;
beauty. How could he imagine what bitter&#xD;
memories of the past, what overpowering&#xD;
scorn of the present, had made that face&#xD;
blossom into such vivid loveliness of light&#xD;
and color?&#xD;
Even Tyndale thought that he had never&#xD;
seen it more beautiful; even he thought that&#xD;
it was the spell of the song-that subtle as-&#xD;
sociation which dwells in music as in odor-&#xD;
which had brought such glowing light to No-&#xD;
rah's eyes, such brilliant carmine to her&#xD;
cheeks. If the first cadence made him re-&#xD;
member that September night on the Rhine&#xD;
until his pulses throbbed, how must it be with&#xD;
her in whose mind the brief romance which&#xD;
ended then had dwelt more deeply and more&#xD;
constantly? It must not be supposed that he&#xD;
forgot, meanwhile, the letter resting safely in&#xD;
his pocket-book-that letter in which Norah&#xD;
said that her love for him had died so utter a&#xD;
death-but it was easier to believe that she&#xD;
had deceived herself, or that she meant to de-&#xD;
ceive her sister, than tbat such an assertion&#xD;
could possibly rest on fact. Beyond a certain&#xD;
point, credulity cannot go. This point in the&#xD;
general masculine mind is reached when it&#xD;
becomes necessary to believe that a woman&#xD;
has learned to forget, to ignore, or to despise,&#xD;
as the case may be, the ~aan whom she once&#xD;
loved. Let this man have good cause, or&#xD;
sometimes no cause, to imagine that any thing&#xD;
like a passion or a tender sentiment has been&#xD;
&#xD;
~ntertained for him, and, in the face of rea-&#xD;
son, fact, and probability, he will retain a&#xD;
firm belief in his power to the last. So it&#xD;
was with Tyndale. He knew that Norah had&#xD;
loved him once, and consequently he no more&#xD;
believed that this love was dead than ho be-&#xD;
lieved that he was a fool, or any other patent&#xD;
absurdity.&#xD;
"I wonder what Leslie thinks of this&#xD;
pretty scene!" said Mrs. Sandford, in a dis-&#xD;
erect aside to Carl. "Upon my word, it is&#xD;
quite lover-like, is it not? What is Mr. Tyn-&#xD;
dale doing now? Looking over the music?&#xD;
But I thought it was one of Miss Desmond's&#xD;
affeeta-peculiarities, never to sing by note~"&#xD;
"So it is one of her peculiarities," said&#xD;
CarL "That is Leslie's music he is turning&#xD;
over. What he means by setting it up before&#xD;
Miss Desmond, I don't know. She does uot&#xD;
sing any of those mezzo-soprano songs."&#xD;
"He has a reason for it, you may be&#xD;
sure," said Mrs. Sandford, philosophically.&#xD;
A minute later this reason became appar-&#xD;
ent-much more apparent than Mr. Tyndale&#xD;
intended or desired. The piece of sheet-mu-&#xD;
sic which had been set up as a screen un-&#xD;
fortunately fell down just as he was in the act&#xD;
of offering a folded paper-apparently a note&#xD;
---to Norah, which Norab, on her part, seemed&#xD;
hesitating whether or not to receive. The&#xD;
tableau only lasted a second. As the music&#xD;
fell forward on the key-board, her hesitation&#xD;
ended-she quietly accepted and slipped it&#xD;
unread into her girdle. Then she turned&#xD;
back to the piano and began singing again.&#xD;
Mrs. Saudford and Carl Middleton in-&#xD;
stinctively looked at each other. Both had&#xD;
seen so plainly and palpably what passed,&#xD;
that there was no room for evasion, no need&#xD;
for silence.&#xD;
"What a mysterious and dramatic bit of&#xD;
by-play 1" said the former, with her light,&#xD;
empty laugh. "Why cannot people say all&#xD;
that they want to while they are together, I&#xD;
wonder?"&#xD;
"Perhaps they lack opportunity to do so,&#xD;
and desire to make one," said Carl, bitterly.&#xD;
But the words were scarcely uttered be-&#xD;
fore he repented himself, and would have&#xD;
given much to recall them. This was be-&#xD;
cause he appreciated the feliX of having spo-&#xD;
ken so plainly to a woman like Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford. His repentance would have been still&#xD;
deeper if he had known that Leslie was stand-&#xD;
ing at his elbow when he uttered them.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="108" xml:id="VAC8066-00000063"/>&#xD;
108               A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Let no one condemn Carl for absolute want&#xD;
of sense when it is recorded of him that he&#xD;
did not close his eyes in slumber during the&#xD;
short hours which remained of that moonlit&#xD;
summer nigh~t. There are two or three facts&#xD;
which may be pleaded in part extenuation of&#xD;
this act of folly. First, as Norah had once&#xD;
said in magnanimous excuse for him, he was&#xD;
young-and when one is young, one cannot&#xD;
only be guilty of a great deal of nonsense,&#xD;
but one can also dispense with a great deal&#xD;
of sleep with impunity. Secondly, he was in&#xD;
love-desperately, hopelessly in love, accord-&#xD;
ing to the impetuo~is though ofttimes short-&#xD;
lived fervor of the mercurial disposition.&#xD;
Thirdly, he was jealous-savagely jealous of&#xD;
the man who, he felt sure, was Norak's lover,&#xD;
oven while he was Leslie's fiane~. Fourthly,&#xD;
he was puzzled, more puzzled than can readi-&#xD;
ly be expressed, by Miss Desmond's inex-&#xD;
plicable conduct. Fifthly, the night was very&#xD;
warm - one of those breathless Southern&#xD;
nights when one's bed, instead of being that&#xD;
"heaven of rest" which Hood calls it, is&#xD;
strikingly suggestive of St. Lawrence's grid-&#xD;
iron; and, sixthly, he had just received a&#xD;
new box of very excellent cigars.&#xD;
All of these causes, combined and operat-&#xD;
ing together, were not conducive to somno-&#xD;
lence. With a ~nind irritatingly wide awake&#xD;
and bent onf thoughts of love and jealousy,&#xD;
he could see no reason for leaving the bal-&#xD;
cony, where he sat at ease, smoking cigar&#xD;
aft~r cigar, and obtaining the benefit of any&#xD;
breeze which chanced to be stirring, for rest-&#xD;
less tossing on a mattress within. There are&#xD;
some fortunate people who, in the face of*&#xD;
any trouble or annoyance, can take their&#xD;
usual quantum of rest-and of these we may&#xD;
confidently predicate that they will safely&#xD;
weather any storm which Fate may send&#xD;
upon them-but Carl was not one of them.&#xD;
It was also necessary to look at his face to&#xD;
read the sign - token of that high - strung,&#xD;
nervous organization which consumes itself&#xD;
with its own fire, and tears itself with its&#xD;
own strength. It would be as wise to bid&#xD;
such natures stop breathing as to bid them&#xD;
"take things easily," as we too often do.&#xD;
Stronger than any thing else in this strange&#xD;
world of ours-stronger than circumstances,&#xD;
resolution, love, or hate - is the resistless&#xD;
and mysterious strength of that which we&#xD;
have agreed to call temperament.&#xD;
Concerning the thoughts which occupied&#xD;
&#xD;
Carl's mind during the hours-first moonlit,&#xD;
and then starlit-that elapsed between the&#xD;
last good-nights down-stairs and the first&#xD;
lightening glow in the east, which told of&#xD;
breaking day, it is not necessary to enter&#xD;
into detail. His suspicions were, as yet, un-&#xD;
formed, his gathering wrath somewhat vague,&#xD;
not in itself, but as regarded the object&#xD;
against whom it was directed. At this time,&#xD;
a trifle might have made it waver again as it&#xD;
had wavered before. Afterward it was too&#xD;
late for this. Afterward not all the elo-&#xD;
quence of men or angels c6uld have turned&#xD;
him from his fixed belief; or his fixed pur-&#xD;
pose.&#xD;
Weary at last from his night's vigil, and&#xD;
conscious of being a little sleepy, he threw&#xD;
his last cigar away, as the glow of the east&#xD;
brightened and deepened into roseate splen-&#xD;
dor, and, leaning back with a yawn, made up&#xD;
his mind that he would "turn in." To make&#xD;
up one's mind to do a thing, however, and to&#xD;
do it, are occasionally very different things.&#xD;
Just now they proved very different indeed&#xD;
with CarL He had scarcely taken his reso-&#xD;
lution, and he certainly had not as yet moved&#xD;
an inch toward carrying it into execution,&#xD;
when the sound of an opening blind near at&#xD;
hand made him start. This. start was not&#xD;
because there was any thing remarkable in&#xD;
the fact of a blind being opened at daylight&#xD;
on a summer morning-.though people sleep-&#xD;
ing on the eastern side of the house would&#xD;
have been more likely to close theirs-as be-&#xD;
cause sleeplessness and tobacco had together&#xD;
produced their natural effect of nervousness,&#xD;
together with the fact that the sound ap-&#xD;
peared to proceed from Miss Desmond's room,&#xD;
which chanced to be in the neighborhood of&#xD;
his own. A minute later it was repeated,&#xD;
and then he knew that it proceeded from her&#xD;
room. Immediately Suspicion sprang up,&#xD;
ready~ armed and on the alert. What was&#xD;
~orah doing awake at that hour? It was&#xD;
impossible to fancy it could be a servant, for&#xD;
the servants at Rosland had far too much re-&#xD;
gard for their own comfort, and knew the&#xD;
habits of their master and mistress too well,&#xD;
to rouse themselves at such a time.&#xD;
For ten minutes Carl sat listening intently,&#xD;
with strained attentIon, for any further proof&#xD;
of matutinal rising on Miss Desmnond's part.&#xD;
All night he had spent in going over and over&#xD;
accordingg to the distracting fashion of night&#xD;
meditation) that little scene at the piano-all&#xD;

&#xD;

EARLY RISING.&#xD;
&#xD;
night he had taken an active part, as counsel&#xD;
for the defense, in an exhaustive mental ar-&#xD;
gument to prove that there could have been&#xD;
nothing of importance in that folded paper&#xD;
which looked so suspiciously like a note.&#xD;
Now, he found, in the most discouraging man-&#xD;
ner, that his trouble had all been for naught.&#xD;
At the first sound from Norah'5 room, his&#xD;
thoughts flew back to the suspicion-point of&#xD;
the night before. What was in that note?&#xD;
What was the meaning of this early rising?&#xD;
Reason said it did not follow of necessity that&#xD;
there was any connection between the two&#xD;
facts. Instinct said, "You may be sure that&#xD;
there is a connection of the closest kind."&#xD;
Between the two, Carl felt not a little puz-&#xD;
zled; but he inclined toward instinct, as, in&#xD;
little or in great, we all more or less do in-&#xD;
cline. Besides, there was reason on that&#xD;
sidetoo. He had known Miss Desmond well&#xD;
enough and long enoughto be aware that she&#xD;
had nothing of the lark in her composition.&#xD;
Only the day before he had heard her say&#xD;
that there was nothing she detested*so much&#xD;
as early rising; and now-&#xD;
Well, he thought, the man would be fit&#xD;
for a lunatic asylum, indeed, who expected&#xD;
consistency in a woman; and, after all, the&#xD;
fact of the open blind did not prove that she&#xD;
had risen. She might have wanted a little&#xD;
air (of which there was not the least stirring),&#xD;
or she might have wanted to admire the sun-&#xD;
rise. This last idea was so improbable that&#xD;
he caught himself smiling over it; and, as he&#xD;
did so, the sun, which had been reddening&#xD;
the tree-tops for some time, rose in full ma-&#xD;
jesty; the first idvel, golden lines of light&#xD;
came slanting across the green, dewy earth,&#xD;
and&#xD;
in the crystal cnp of day&#xD;
Lay melted the pe4rl of dawn."&#xD;
The marvelous stillness, freshness, and&#xD;
beauty of the scene arrested ev~i Carl's un-&#xD;
observant gaze. For a tainute he forgot his&#xD;
passionate, jealous thoughts, in admiration&#xD;
of the picture outspread before him-the&#xD;
shadows, long and deep as those of afternoon,&#xD;
the sunlight full of still glory, the sparkling&#xD;
freshness of grass and foliage, the purple mist&#xD;
clinging softly to the. distant hills, the lucid&#xD;
clearness and brightness of the air. As he&#xD;
looked and listened-for, from copse ~snd tree&#xD;
rose the matin song of many feathered char-&#xD;
isters-another sound made him start, and&#xD;
diverted his attention in a moment from all&#xD;
&#xD;
the glory of Nature. This sound was the&#xD;
soft enclosing of a door immediately beneath&#xD;
his balcony.&#xD;
Instantly he leaned forward and looked&#xD;
over the railing. As he did so, a light-gray&#xD;
dress fluttered below, a figure wearing a straw&#xD;
hat stepped into full view, and the next mo-&#xD;
ment he recognized Norah Desmnond as she&#xD;
walked with her quick, stately tread across&#xD;
the dewy grass.&#xD;
Careless- whether or not she should turn&#xD;
and see him, Carl sat motionless, staring&#xD;
after her as she crossed the lawn and disap-&#xD;
peared along a winding path of the shrub-&#xD;
bery. What did it mean? This was what&#xD;
he asked himself-ignoring the fact that Miss&#xD;
Desmond was at liberty to take as many&#xD;
walks at sunrise as she felt inclined to, with-&#xD;
out any one possessing the right (he, least of&#xD;
all) to inquire why she did so. "She has&#xD;
gone to meet that scoundrel!" he said, after&#xD;
a while, striking his clinched hand violently&#xD;
on the railing against which he leaned, hurt-&#xD;
ing it severely, by-the-by- only people do&#xD;
not mind such trifles as this when they are&#xD;
excited.&#xD;
Having decided that she had gone to meet~&#xD;
the scoundrel in question, Carl felt himself&#xD;
fired with the spirit of one. of Mr Wilkie&#xD;
Collins's detectives. There was only a single.&#xD;
objection to following her and settling, the&#xD;
point at once: this was an inconvenient sen-&#xD;
~Iment of honor, a~ inconvenient feeling that,&#xD;
as a gentleman, he had no right and little en-.&#xD;
cuse for prying into Miss Desmond's affairs,&#xD;
and sitting in judgment on her conduct. But'&#xD;
then, if he meant to serve her-as he did&#xD;
mean to serve her, by showing Arthur~ Tyn-&#xD;
dale that he could not, with impufmity, play-&#xD;
such a part between herself and Leslie-was&#xD;
it not necessary for him to know the truth?&#xD;
This view of the case struck l~im forcibly, and&#xD;
seemed unanswerable. Certainly it was neces-&#xD;
sary that he should know the truth; certain-&#xD;
ly, also, there was no other means for learn-&#xD;
ing it than this which seemed to him in a&#xD;
measure dishonorable, Yet, after all, was he&#xD;
not regam~ding the matter in rather an exag-&#xD;
gerated light? Was it dishonorable to sat-&#xD;
isfy himself-by sight, merely-of a matter&#xD;
concerning which it was vitally important&#xD;
that he should possess satisfaction? The&#xD;
strictest of moral casuiste might have been&#xD;
excused for answering "No."&#xD;
At least, this was Carl's view of the ease.&#xD;

&#xD;
Just then, probably, he was a particularly&#xD;
strict moral casuist. Few of us are when&#xD;
our own desires and interests are at stake.&#xD;
Unquestionably the matter ended as might&#xD;
have been expected. He entered his room,&#xD;
dressed quickly, and, going down-stairs as&#xD;
quietly as possible, passed out of the door&#xD;
which Norah had left ajar, and followed the&#xD;
path which she had taken into the shrub-&#xD;
bery.&#xD;
Ten minutes later, he came in sight of the&#xD;
Dutch summer-house-toward which the in-&#xD;
stinet, that occasionally serves as a mariner a&#xD;
compass on dry land, led his feet. It was&#xD;
there that Norah had gone, he felt sure; it&#xD;
was there that he would learn the best or&#xD;
worst of that which he desired to know.&#xD;
Full of this conviction-a conviction ap-&#xD;
proaching to a positive certainty-he paused&#xD;
in the shrubbery at some distance from the&#xD;
summer-house, contenting himself with com-&#xD;
manding a good view of the door. All he&#xD;
desired was to see; no casuistry could have&#xD;
convinced him for a moment that it was hon-&#xD;
orable to hear.&#xD;
He waited for some time without any&#xD;
thing occurring which justified the suspicion&#xD;
that had brought him there. "I am a fool!"&#xD;
he thought, and was about to turn away and&#xD;
to resume his search in another direction,&#xD;
when suddenly his heart gave a great throb&#xD;
that almost suffocated him. Framed in the&#xD;
summer - house window at. that moment he&#xD;
saw Norah's beautiful, grave face gazing out&#xD;
over the bright landscape which he had&#xD;
showed her first; and, almost simultaneously&#xD;
with this picture, his eye caught a glimpse&#xD;
of Arthur Tyndale's graceful figure advancing&#xD;
rapidly from the opposite direction.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
"Woman, and will you east,&#xD;
For a word, quite off, at last,&#xD;
Me, your own, your you-&#xD;
Since, as Truth is true,&#xD;
I was you all, the hippy past-&#xD;
Me do you leave aghast&#xD;
With the memories we amassed?"&#xD;
NonAn was standing, with her hack to the&#xD;
door, gazing half abs~ently out of the open&#xD;
window, when the sound of Tyndale's step, as&#xD;
he entered the summer-house, made her start&#xD;
and turn around. By the quick lighting-up&#xD;
&#xD;
of his eye, the quick flush of pleasure which&#xD;
rose to his face, it was evident that he had&#xD;
not been at all certain of finding her; but the&#xD;
expression of her face did not change in the&#xD;
least as she walked slowly forward and paused&#xD;
at the table in the centre of the floor. Evi-&#xD;
dently she was there for a purpose, and evi-&#xD;
dently, also, it was one with which pleasure&#xD;
had little to do.&#xD;
"You are late," she said, quietly, before&#xD;
he could utter any salutation. "I have been&#xD;
waiting for some time."&#xD;
"Have you? I am sorry, very sorry!" he&#xD;
answered, with the flush deepening on his&#xD;
face. It is always awkward to be late in&#xD;
keeping an appointment which one has made&#xD;
one's self; but Tyndale was a man who piqued&#xD;
himself on the observance of the little things&#xD;
in which high-breeding consists, and he knew&#xD;
that for a gentleman to be late in keeping an&#xD;
appointment with a lady is an unpardonable&#xD;
social offense. "How can I ask you to par-&#xD;
don me?" he said. "I had no idea you&#xD;
would be~able to leave the hous&amp;amp;so early-it&#xD;
is very early, you know."&#xD;
"Is it?" said she, carelessly. "But, after&#xD;
all, early is a relative term. If one had been&#xD;
awake all night, for instance, one might eall&#xD;
it late."&#xD;
"Fins have not been awake all night, I&#xD;
trust?" (rather tenderly).&#xD;
"No" (very indifferently). "But I slept&#xD;
brokenly, and the heat was intense. What i~&#xD;
it Hood says?-&#xD;
'They must be wretched who cannot sleep&#xD;
When God himself draws the curtain!'&#xD;
Well, I was not particularly wretched-n~t&#xD;
wretched at~ all, in fact-but still I did not&#xD;
sleep. I had bad dreams and bad dreams al-&#xD;
ways upset me for the day. I dreamed about&#xD;
you!" (with startling directness).&#xD;
~ hopeyou don't mean to imply that&#xD;
your dreams were bad because they were of&#xD;
"Yes, I mean to imply just that-they&#xD;
were bad because they were of you! But I&#xD;
dreamed of other disagreeable things, also,&#xD;
and therefore I was glad when day dawned,&#xD;
and the night was over. I did not come to&#xD;
talk of my dreams, however," said she, sitting&#xD;
down. "Suppose we proceed at once to busi-&#xD;
ness? Early or late, I cannot spend much&#xD;
time here."&#xD;
"I have not yet told you how glad, how&#xD;
&#xD;
110&#xD;
&#xD;
happy I am to find you!" he began, eagerly;&#xD;
but she interrupted him.&#xD;
"There is not the slightest reason why&#xD;
you should be either glad or happy. I am&#xD;
here simply because your note seemed to in-&#xD;
dicate that there was an urgent necessity for&#xD;
you to see me. The more briefly you tell nie&#xD;
what this necessity is, the more indebted to&#xD;
you I shall be."&#xD;
"You will not even allow me to thank&#xD;
you-&#xD;
"Have I not explained that there is noth-&#xD;
ing for which to thank me?" she interrupted,&#xD;
again. "I have not come on your account,&#xD;
or because you desired it. Pray understand&#xD;
this at once. It will save time and words-&#xD;
neither of which I like to waste."&#xD;
"Then, if you did not come on my ac-&#xD;
count, or because I desired it, may I venture&#xD;
to inquire to what I am indebted for your&#xD;
presence?" asked he, irritated, against his&#xD;
will, by the seW-possession of her manner,&#xD;
the contemptuous indifference of her tone.&#xD;
"I have already told you," said she, "that&#xD;
you are indebted to the assurance of your&#xD;
note-an assurance given on your honor-if&#xD;
such a trifling form of asseveration has any&#xD;
weight with you-that there Was an impera-&#xD;
tive need for you to see me. I credited this,"&#xD;
she added, "not so much because you asserted&#xD;
it as because I was myself able to imagine&#xD;
what the need in question might be."&#xD;
"Were you, indeed?" said he. The ever-&#xD;
changing flush on his face deepened again.&#xD;
He could not be with her five minutes without&#xD;
being galled to the quick, and yet he was so&#xD;
far gone in madness that he would not have&#xD;
exchan~cd this bitterness for all the honey&#xD;
that ever dropped from lips of coral. "In&#xD;
that case, it may save time and words if you&#xD;
will be kind enough to tell me what you have&#xD;
imagined this need to be."&#xD;
"Is that necessary?" asked she. "Is&#xD;
there more than one thing which I could have&#xD;
imagined it to be?"&#xD;
"There is certainly more than one tfiing&#xD;
which you could have imagined," answered&#xD;
he, with more coolness than he had displayed&#xD;
before, "since there is more than one thing&#xD;
of which I desire urgently to speak to you."&#xD;
"A desire is one thino-- a need is quite&#xD;
another. You said nothing of the first, but a&#xD;
great deal of the last; in your note2'&#xD;
"I fancied that the latter would have&#xD;
more weight with you than the former."&#xD;
&#xD;
"You were quite right," she rejoined.&#xD;
"The former would have had no weight at&#xD;
all." Then she added, impatiently: "The&#xD;
purpose for which I am here has nothing&#xD;
to do with listening to idle speeches, how-&#xD;
ever; and any thing more idle than a discus-&#xD;
sion of your desires it would be impossible&#xD;
to imagine. Since the interview is of your&#xD;
seeking, I might insist that all necessary ex-&#xD;
planation should come from you ; but perhaps&#xD;
it may shorten matters to say at once that,&#xD;
when I read your note, I felt little doubt but&#xD;
that the 'urgent need,' upon which you laid&#xD;
so much stress, was the need of telling me a&#xD;
fact of which I am already well aware-that&#xD;
Leslie is on the eve of knowing, if she does&#xD;
not already know, the whole story of that&#xD;
folly in which you were overheard at Straf-&#xD;
ford the other day."&#xD;
"Leslie on the eve of knowing the folly&#xD;
in which I was overheard at Strafford the&#xD;
other day!" repeated he, too thoroughly as-&#xD;
tonished to do otherwise than echo her&#xD;
words. "I do not understand. What do you&#xD;
mean?"&#xD;
"What do I mean?" repeated she, losing&#xD;
patience altogether. "Are you crazy or stu-&#xD;
pid that you do not know what I mean? Is&#xD;
it possible you have forgotten that there was&#xD;
a spy ambushed in the library - window at&#xD;
Strafford, who overheard all that you were&#xD;
foolish enough to say on the terrace that&#xD;
day?"&#xD;
"I trust that I am neither crazy nor stu-&#xD;
pid," answered he. "I remember now. You&#xD;
are speaking of Mrs. Sandfor&amp;amp; But I do&#xD;
not think there is any thing to fear from her.&#xD;
In the first place, it is not at all probable&#xD;
that she overheard any thing. In the second&#xD;
place, even if she had done so, I have no idea&#xD;
that she would think of interfering to make&#xD;
mischief!"&#xD;
"Have you not?" said Norah.&#xD;
She looked at him with a glance which he&#xD;
had often before encountered, and felt to be&#xD;
of an uncomfortably keen nature. With all&#xD;
her hardly-earnea worldly wisdom, one thing,&#xD;
which this daughter of Bohemia had not&#xD;
learned, or disdained to practise, was the im-&#xD;
portant art of never appearing to see too&#xD;
much or read too clearly. Especially in a&#xD;
woman is this art essential. Last of all&#xD;
~things which a man can forgive, is the con-&#xD;
sciousness that the companion of his hours&#xD;
of relaxation, the smoother of his pillow of&#xD;

cares, has regarded him with steady, level&#xD;
gaze, has sounded the depths of that ofttimes&#xD;
shallow well which he calls his mind, has&#xD;
ventured to sit in criticism on his errors of&#xD;
judgment, and learned to know his weak&#xD;
points as well or better than he knows them&#xD;
himself. Thoroughly aware of this fact,&#xD;
many women keep their lids drooped on sys-&#xD;
tern, only lifting them to look up in that meek&#xD;
attitude of adoration fit for th~ weaker yes-&#xD;
sel and humbler creature.&#xD;
"I have known Mrs. Sandford a long&#xD;
time," he said, in answer to the incredulity&#xD;
of her glance, "and I have never seen any&#xD;
trace of malice in her. She is foolish and&#xD;
vain, but I do not think she would act in a&#xD;
dishonorable manner."&#xD;
"But Mrs. SandCord may not think that&#xD;
she is acting in a dishonorable manner in&#xD;
putting Leslie on her guard against two such&#xD;
grass deceivers as you and I," said Norab,&#xD;
with a sudden gleam of laughter, which Tyn-&#xD;
dale felt to be very ma? cl propo~, indeed,&#xD;
coming into her eyes-that devil-may-care&#xD;
gleam of Irish humor which there is not&#xD;
trouble enough. on all this round earth of&#xD;
trouble to quell. "No doubt she defends&#xD;
the step-or would defend it if it were as-&#xD;
sailed-on very high moral grounds. Can&#xD;
you not imagine what they might be, Mr.&#xD;
Tyndale?"&#xD;
"I cannot imagine hi the least," answered&#xD;
lie, coldly, suspicious of the satire lurking&#xD;
under her words. "My imagination is nei-&#xD;
ther so ready nor sa brilliant as your own.&#xD;
I am only confident that you do her injus-&#xD;
tice."&#xD;
"It is bad policy to be 'confident' of any&#xD;
thing or of anybody," said Norab. "That is&#xD;
article first of my worldly creed. Let me&#xD;
recommend you to make it an article of yours.&#xD;
If you had done so a little earlier, you would&#xD;
not be astonished when I tell you that Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford has already made one confidant,&#xD;
and may soon make another."&#xD;
"One confidant!" repeated he, aghast.&#xD;
"Good Heavens! are you in earnest? Who?&#xD;
-what ?-when?"&#xD;
"Your cousin, Captain Tyndale, was the&#xD;
'who;'the 'what,' I have no doubt, was all&#xD;
that she knew, together with as much as she&#xD;
could invent; the 'when' was yesterday&#xD;
morning in the shrubbery."&#xD;
"Afar! has she told Max? Are you&#xD;
sure ?-is there no mistake?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I scarcely think there can be any mis-&#xD;
take. He implied as much ve~y plainly&#xD;
when speaking to me yesterday; but, before&#xD;
he could enter into any explanation, we were&#xD;
interrupted."&#xD;
"Max!" repeated Arthur. lie did not&#xD;
say so, but he felt that he would almost as&#xD;
soon it had been teslie. "The meddling,&#xD;
prying eavesdropper!" he said, alluding to&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford. "To think that she should&#xD;
take advantage of a mere accident to inter-&#xD;
fere in a matter which does not concern her&#xD;
in the least! In the name of"-a pause-&#xD;
"Heaven, what can be her motive?~~&#xD;
"Have you generally found that it is at&#xD;
all worth while to trouble one's self with re-&#xD;
gard to people's motives?" asked Norah,&#xD;
calmly. "When one finds them, they are&#xD;
generally so very small and so very shabby&#xD;
that one hardly feels repaid for the search."&#xD;
"What did Max say?" asked he, eagerly.&#xD;
"How did he take it?"&#xD;
"I have~ already mentioned that we were&#xD;
interrupted before he had time to say any&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
"And Leslie; do you think she knows?&#xD;
Do you think that-that woman has told her&#xD;
any thing?"&#xD;
"I cannot tell; but she was alone with&#xD;
that woman for two or three hours yesterday&#xD;
afternoon."&#xD;
"Was there ever a man so deceived and&#xD;
betrayed as I have been!" said Tyndale, in a&#xD;
Hamlet-like tone. "You think that I have&#xD;
acted badly," he added, turning irripetuously&#xD;
to Norah, "but, if you could only know how&#xD;
others have treated me! There's Max, for&#xD;
instance; I would have trusted Max, if all&#xD;
tl~e women in the world had proved false,&#xD;
and yet even he has failed me!"&#xD;
"I should scarcely have fancied that,"&#xD;
said Norab.&#xD;
She wondered a little what had come be-&#xD;
tween these two men, one of whom had so&#xD;
warmly advocated the other's cause two days&#xD;
before, but she did not choose to ask. Max&#xD;
Tyndale was nothing to her save the hopeless&#xD;
and deserving lover who might probably, at&#xD;
the end of the (drama, marry Leslie Gra-&#xD;
hame.&#xD;
"None of this is of any importance," she&#xD;
went on, in her decided fashion. "The ques-&#xD;
tion is not 'Who has deceived or who be-&#xD;
trayed you?' but 'What is to be done?' Will&#xD;
you tell Leslie the truth, or shall I?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Tell Leslie-the truth!" he stammered&#xD;
Such a downright and uncompromising d&#xD;
mand almost took away his breath. Wa&#xD;
she mad-this beautiful, imperious creature&#xD;
of whom his fear was even more lively thai&#xD;
his admiration?&#xD;
"Yes, the truth!" repeated Miss Des&#xD;
mond, looking at him steadily. '~Does th&#xD;
word frighten you? Well, it is sometimes&#xD;
hard thing-this truth-but, at its worst,&#xD;
is never so hard as the consequences of tha&#xD;
other thing called falsehood. You migh'&#xD;
have learned this fragment of wisdom som&#xD;
time since."&#xD;
"You are plainly determined to teach ii&#xD;
to me," said he, with paling lips. "God&#xD;
knows it would have been better if I hac&#xD;
told Leslie the truth at ~lrst, but now-it h&#xD;
too lat0!"&#xD;
"Too late for what?" asked Norah'E&#xD;
trenchant voice. "Is it ever too late to stef&#xD;
out of the mire on to dry land? Po you&#xD;
mean too late on account of Mrs. Sandford?&#xD;
If you speak bravely and openly, even Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford's story will weigh little with Leslie.&#xD;
But I warn you frankly that it is only by&#xD;
speaking openly that you can save yourself.&#xD;
Sooner or later, Leslie must know the truth.&#xD;
If you and I are silent, sh&amp;amp;will learn it from&#xD;
others."&#xD;
"Apparently you do not m to be si-&#xD;
lent," said he, catching at her last words.&#xD;
"You are mistaken," she answered. "I&#xD;
decided yesterday that Leslie should not&#xD;
hear the truth from me; I made up my mind&#xD;
that I would go back to the old vagabond&#xD;
life at the first excuse, and leave her unmo-&#xD;
lested in her fools' paradise. But you see&#xD;
that the matter has been taken out of my&#xD;
hands. Your own folly has betrayed your&#xD;
secret to a person who will not hesitate to&#xD;
use it unscrupulously. Hence I-who have&#xD;
no interest in the matter save the interest of&#xD;
honestly desiring to scare Leslie, who has&#xD;
honestly attcmp~ed to serve me-I tell you&#xD;
- that your only hope of saving yourself in her&#xD;
eyes is to go and speak the truth, as a more&#xD;
honorable man would have spoken it long&#xD;
ago."&#xD;
"You are hard on me,'~ he said, changing&#xD;
color from white to red and red to white&#xD;
again. "You have been hard on me from&#xD;
the first! Can you not comprehend that a&#xD;
man may be ted into things without meaning&#xD;
to act falsely or dishonorably? If you could&#xD;
8&#xD;
&#xD;
only understand how little I meant to act&#xD;
~- toward you as I have done-!"&#xD;
a "Your conduct toward me requires no&#xD;
~, apology," said she. "You have greatly mis-&#xD;
a understood all that I have said if you think&#xD;
it necessary to offer one."&#xD;
"I have not misunderstood a single word&#xD;
e that you have uttered," answered he, quickly.&#xD;
i "I am not offering an apology. It is the&#xD;
t last thing I should think of offering to you.&#xD;
t I only hope you will grant as much credence&#xD;
and attention to what I am about to say as I&#xD;
have given you."&#xD;
"I am afraid I must ask you to be kind&#xD;
enough to 'speak briefly," answered she,&#xD;
I glancing at her watch. "I have already&#xD;
I spent more time than I intended."&#xD;
"Can you not even spare me a few min-&#xD;
utes?" demanded he, half angrily - " you&#xD;
who give long hours to Max, and that Mid.&#xD;
dleton puppy, whom I suppose you intend to&#xD;
I marry!"&#xD;
"Do you?" said she, indifferently; but&#xD;
she did not add, "lamor am no~ going to&#xD;
do so." Plainly Mr. Tyndale must under-&#xD;
stand his position was that of a mere ac-&#xD;
quaintance-of one to whom she allowed no&#xD;
part or interest in her life. "But thia~ is&#xD;
wandering from the subject of which you in-&#xD;
tend to speak," she added. "I hope you&#xD;
~mean to explain that 'urgent need' for my&#xD;
presence which you have not explained yet-&#xD;
since it seems that I was wrong in my idea&#xD;
concerning it."&#xD;
"How can I explain any thing when you&#xD;
treat me like this, when you remove me to&#xD;
such an infinite distance from you?" said he,&#xD;
with a sudden vibration of passion in his voice&#xD;
which startled her, for she was not expecting&#xD;
any thing of the kind just then. "You must&#xD;
know, you must feel, what it is that I wish to&#xD;
say! That 'folly' of which you talk, at&#xD;
Strafford the other day, was nearer wisdom&#xD;
than folly.. You urge me to tell Leslie the&#xD;
trnth. Do you know what it would be if I&#xD;
did tell her? It could only be that I love&#xD;
you, Norah-you only, you forever, you so&#xD;
far dbove all other women, that I would rath-&#xD;
er be miserable with you than find myself&#xD;
condemned to live without you!"&#xD;
"That is unfortunate!" said Norah-her&#xD;
clear, cold voice making an indescribable&#xD;
contrast to the passionate eagerness of his-&#xD;
"since you are not likely to possess the&#xD;
option of being miserable with me! I fear,&#xD;

&#xD;
on the contrary, that yon will find yourself&#xD;
reduced to the necessity of heing happy with.&#xD;
out me-only, for your consolation, I can&#xD;
honestly say that I do not think a gentleman&#xD;
who changes his mind and his fancy so often,&#xD;
will be likely to find an exceeding amount of&#xD;
happiness in any position of life."&#xD;
"For God's sake, spare me your mock-&#xD;
ery!" said he, hoarsely. "If you could&#xD;
know what I have suffered during the last&#xD;
few days, you would pity me. I never knew&#xD;
what the hell of jealousy was until I have&#xD;
endured it in seeing you surrounded by other&#xD;
men, each of whom has had a better right to&#xD;
yQUF time and attention than I! At last I&#xD;
could bear it no longer, and I determined to&#xD;
make one effort to gai~i an opportunity-this&#xD;
opportunity-to tell you all that is impera-&#xD;
tive you should know-"&#xD;
She interrupted him here.&#xD;
." Imperative to whom 1'" she-asked.&#xD;
"To me principally; to you, I hope, in&#xD;
a measure," he answered, Then he leaned&#xD;
across the table which divided them, and&#xD;
would have taken her hands if she had not&#xD;
drawn back haughtily. "Norah," he said&#xD;
-and the supreme excitement of his voice&#xD;
seemed to clash on the still air-," I swear to&#xD;
you that I love you more passionately, more&#xD;
intensely, than I did when we were so happy&#xD;
two years ago, at Baden! You are infinitely&#xD;
dearer, infinitely mere necessary, to me than&#xD;
on the night we parted in Coblents. Norab,&#xD;
have you in love left for me? Is it all dead?&#xD;
Can I bring none of it to life again by the de-&#xD;
votion of a lifetime? 0 lqve! love !-they&#xD;
say that women never forget. Oh, if I could&#xD;
only hope that you would come to me again&#xD;
as you caine to me once before!"&#xD;
He stopped abruptly, partly because he&#xD;
was out of breath, and partly because there&#xD;
was something exceedingly discouraging to&#xD;
any prolonged effort of eloquence in the steady&#xD;
brilliance of Norab's eyes. Not for a moment&#xD;
had this gaze wavered from his face; not&#xD;
once bad the long lashes drooped in becoming&#xD;
maidenly shyness, or the flush on her cheeks&#xD;
deepened. Her self-possession was simply&#xD;
imperturbable, unruffled by any sign of cpu.&#xD;
fusion or trace of indignation. When he&#xD;
ceased speaking, she answered him as. quietly&#xD;
as if he had made the most commonplace&#xD;
proposal in the world:&#xD;
"And if I came to you, Mr. Tyndale, pray&#xD;
what would you do with me? We do not&#xD;
&#xD;
live in Asia, and I believe you are engaged to&#xD;
marry Leslie."&#xD;
"But 1 was en~qaged to you first 1" an-&#xD;
swered he, with a sudden flash of hope light..&#xD;
ing up his face. Surely, this girl, with her&#xD;
passionate Irish blood, her reckless Bohemian&#xD;
rearing, would never have taken his declara-&#xD;
tion so coolly as this, unless she meant to&#xD;
grant all that he desired. "Norab, have you&#xD;
forgotten that? I can never forget it. I was&#xD;
engaged to you first, and I love you-hence&#xD;
my first duty is to you,"&#xD;
"In other words," said she, leaning on&#xD;
the table, and looking more intently than ever&#xD;
into his face, "you are kind enough to offer&#xD;
to break your engagement with Leslie for me.&#xD;
Is that it? I always like things put into&#xD;
plain English."&#xD;
"I offer to put the engagement aside, and&#xD;
act as if it 4id not exist, which, in truthit&#xD;
does not," he answered, with a ring of de-&#xD;
fiance in his voice. "A man cannot be bound&#xD;
to two women, and I gave my faith and my&#xD;
heart to you two years ago. Do you remem-&#xD;
ber the pledge we exchanged when we parted&#xD;
in Coblentz? What I desire, above all things,&#xD;
now is, to redeem that pledge."&#xD;
"How?" demanded she, laconically.&#xD;
"Is there more than one way ~" asked&#xD;
he, thinking that surely no man, in making a&#xD;
proposal, was ever assailed by such point-&#xD;
blank questions before. "We promised to&#xD;
marry each other, Norah; and I-I am more&#xD;
than willing to fulfill that promise now."&#xD;
Men seldom talk well when they are mak-&#xD;
ing love-unnumbered novelists and poets to&#xD;
the contrary notwithstanding-.--but, if Tyn.&#xD;
dale talked uii~esually badly, it can at least be&#xD;
said for him that he talked at a remarkable&#xD;
disadvantage. Very few men, at such a time,&#xD;
have the misfortune to address an attention&#xD;
critically on the alert, much less to feel a&#xD;
pair of steady eyes gazing through and through&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Into those eyes there came a sudden gleam&#xD;
at h~s last words; but, as it came quickly, so,&#xD;
also, i~ vanished.&#xD;
"now kind og you!" said she, but so&#xD;
quietly that only the words themselves be-&#xD;
trayed their irony. "Have you made any&#xD;
arrangement by which this generous inten-&#xD;
tion can be converted into an accomplished&#xD;
fact?"&#xD;
He looked at her doubtfully. Never had&#xD;
he felt more thoroughly puzzled how to&#xD;

~' take" her. Was she in earnest, or was&#xD;
she only amusing herself with him? She&#xD;
had been so little in the habit of amusing&#xD;
herself with.him of late, however, and it was&#xD;
so exceedingly improbable that she would se-&#xD;
lect such a subject as this on which to begin,&#xD;
that he finally' decided she must he in ear-&#xD;

"Arrangernento are easily made," he an.&#xD;
swerved. ~' I have thought of one plan which&#xD;
seems to me feasible. It is, that to-day-to-&#xD;
night-to-morrow-any time you choose, but&#xD;
the sooner the better-you should meet me at&#xD;
some appointed rendezvous, from which we&#xD;
can drive to Wexford, and take the train for&#xD;
Alton. As soon as we reach the latter place,&#xD;
we will be married; and then, if you desire&#xD;
it, we can sail at once for Europe."&#xD;
- "Ak-c you in earnest?" asked she, chan-&#xD;
ging color for the first time. "Do you really&#xD;
mean this?"&#xD;
"Try me I ". said he, passionately. "That&#xD;
is all I ask. Appoint the hour, and let inc&#xD;
show you whether or not I am in earnest."&#xD;
She was silent for a minute, which seemed&#xD;
an hour to him. Then she said, abruptly,&#xD;
with the air of one who has definitely made&#xD;
up her'niind:&#xD;
"There is a train which passes' Wexford&#xD;
at ten o'clock at night for Altoi,, is there&#xD;
not? How would that answer for your pnr-&#xD;
pose? I should say our purpose, should I&#xD;
not? You -know there will be some ~eoplc&#xD;
here for dinner this evening, and Leslie talks&#xD;
of a moonlight croquet-party. It will afford&#xD;
aim ~xeellent opportunity for leaving unob-&#xD;
served2'&#xD;
"It will be an excellent opportunity,"&#xD;
said he, eager still, but certainly amazed.&#xD;
He had not flattered himself with any antici-&#xD;
ration of such quick success as this, end-&#xD;
and it rather tslonished him. He attributed&#xD;
it, however, to. the resistless passion which,&#xD;
despite all her asseverations to the contrary,&#xD;
Norah still felt for him; and, being somewhat&#xD;
beside himself with passion~ for her, he bad&#xD;
little disposition to find fault with it. "To-&#xD;
night, then!" he said, quickly. "And now,&#xD;
0 my darling, how can I-"&#xD;
Do what, waS never detes-mnined; for at&#xD;
that moment she rose to her feet, looking at&#xD;
her watch again as she did so.&#xD;
"I %lndthat I have considerably exceeded&#xD;
the time which I allowed for your explana-&#xD;
tion," she said, coolly. "Its novel and en-&#xD;
&#xD;
grossing nature must bemy excuse. I have&#xD;
never before been invited to elope-much less&#xD;
to be actively instrumental in the jilting of&#xD;
m.y own sister. Let me thank you for a new&#xD;
sensation, Mr. Tyndale, as well as for half an&#xD;
bour'~ excellent entertainment. And now,&#xD;
gOQd.n3orning I"&#xD;
She bent her head-the mockery which,&#xD;
of all her moods, he hated most, quivering&#xD;
about her lips and shining in her eyes-and&#xD;
would have swept past him to the door, if he&#xD;
had not stepped quickly forward and barred&#xD;
her path, as he had done once- before in that&#xD;
very spot.&#xD;
"By-" he said, forgetting himself far&#xD;
enough to utter a deep, bitter oath under&#xD;
his breath, "you shall not go like this? Yog&#xD;
shall tell me the truth at least, before you do&#xD;
go! flave you deliberately been making ~&#xD;
fool of me? Have you been lying to me with&#xD;
your eyes and with your tongue all thin time?&#xD;
Do you not mean to marry me, after all?"&#xD;
"Marry you!" repeated she, turning upon&#xD;
him with a scorn in her face and in her voice&#xD;
which was fairly majestic-" marry you, Ar.&#xD;
thur Tyndale-yan! Not if there was never&#xD;
another man on all God's earth! And when&#xD;
you talk of my eyes or of my tongue lying&#xD;
to you," she went on, indignantly,. "it is you&#xD;

courage would ~mave fallen back, at that mi-&#xD;
periou~ comn~aad, and before the look of-dc.&#xD;
fiance which accompanied her last words.&#xD;
As he fell back, she passed out, and he-&#xD;
thus left alone-sat down like one half-&#xD;
stunned, and, flinging his arms across the&#xD;
table, buried his face upon them.&#xD;

A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
vants had arisen in the interval of her ab-&#xD;
sence and done their work, so that all the&#xD;
lower apartments stood open, fair, and cool,&#xD;
and fresh, to the early summer morning; but&#xD;
an enchanted palace could not have been&#xD;
more still. She glanced at the large, old-&#xD;
fashioned clock-Mr. Middleton's special pet,&#xD;
for it had been brought over from England&#xD;
by his grandfather-which faced her as she&#xD;
entered the hall. It pointed to seven o'clock,&#xD;
and she knew that breakfast was never ready&#xD;
before nine.&#xD;
"What am I to do with myself all this&#xD;
time?" she thought, with a slight feeling of&#xD;
dismay.&#xD;
Somehow one feels an odd, incumbent ne-&#xD;
cessity to do something with one's self-&#xD;
something useful or virtuous-when, by an&#xD;
extraordinary chance, one is astir very much&#xD;
In advance of one's usual time of rising.&#xD;
Then Norah's pulses were still thrilling with&#xD;
an excitement which even yet had not quieted&#xD;
down. The first thing which occurred to her&#xD;
was that she must change her dress, her dew-&#xD;
draggled skirts bearing significant witness to&#xD;
the wet grass which she had crossed, the&#xD;
damp paths she had followed; but, with two&#xD;
unoceu~ied hours stretching before her, she&#xD;
feltthat there need be no hurry about this.&#xD;
If she went up-stairs at eight o'clock, there&#xD;
would be quite time enough for a much more&#xD;
elaborate toilet than any she was likely to&#xD;
make. Meanwhile the sitting-room looked&#xD;
temptingly cool and delightful, with its half-&#xD;
closed Venetian blinds, through which the&#xD;
long, golden sunbeams of early morning were&#xD;
stealing. She crossed the hall and went in.&#xD;
After all, she must take time for reflection;&#xD;
she must consider at once what she meant to&#xD;
do; and there could be no better opportunity&#xD;
for such consideration than the present.&#xD;
As she entered the room, with her hat&#xD;
still on her bead, she was thinking of this so&#xD;
deeply, and expecting so little to see any one,&#xD;
that she had more than half-crossed the floor&#xD;
before she became aware of the presence of a&#xD;
gentleman, who rose from the depths of Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton's favorite chair with an open news-&#xD;
paper in his hand.&#xD;
"Good-morning, Miss Desmond," he said.&#xD;
And then, looking up with a start, Norah&#xD;
found that she was advancing directly upon&#xD;
Max Tyndale.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.,&#xD;
"For a chance to make your little much,&#xD;
To gain a lover hnd lose a friend,&#xD;
Venture the tree and a myriad such,&#xD;
When nothing you mar, but the year can mend&#xD;
But a last leaf-fear to touch.&#xD;
"GOOD-MORNING, Miss Desmond."&#xD;
"Good - morning, Captain Tyndale," an-&#xD;
swered she. "Excuse my inattention, but I&#xD;
was not expecting to see any one."&#xD;
"You could not have been expecting it&#xD;
less than I was," said he, smiling. "I know&#xD;
the habits of the household so well that I&#xD;
had resigned myself to at least two hours of&#xD;
prospective solitude."&#xD;
"Your resignation was apparently ac~&#xD;
companies with philosophy,"' said she, glan-&#xD;
cing from the newspaper to the arm-chair.&#xD;
"Don't be alarmed, and imagine that I have&#xD;
come to disturb you! I am on my way up.&#xD;
stairs to change my dress before breakfast;&#xD;
but I felt a little tired, and this room looked&#xD;
cool and inviting."&#xD;
"You seem to have been walking," said&#xD;
he, glancing in turn from her hat to her dew-&#xD;
stained boots and skirt. "Pray sit down" ~&#xD;
-he drew a chair forward. "You are not&#xD;
disturbing me in the least."&#xD;
" Thanks~" said she, sinking almost in-&#xD;
voluntarily into the ~oft depths. As she did&#xD;
so, he saw that she was evidently more than&#xD;
"a little tired." Indeed, she looked so ex-&#xD;
hausted that for a second he was absolutely&#xD;
startled.&#xD;
"Shouldn't you like a fan?" he asked,&#xD;
glancing round vaguely in search of onc~&#xD;
"Or water? I can ring and have some&#xD;
brought, if you say so."&#xD;
She shook her head.&#xD;
"I shall do very well, thank you, without&#xD;
any thing. I am only tired because I am&#xD;
not accustomed to .such matutinal exertion."&#xD;
"If you are not accustomed to it, I&#xD;
scarcely think you are wise to begin in this&#xD;
climate, and at this time of year. Do you&#xD;
not know that it is a maxim of health with&#xD;
all Southern people to stay in-doors until the&#xD;
dew is dried?"&#xD;
"If it is a maxim of health, it is one&#xD;
which you seem to disregard with impunity,"&#xD;
said she, looking at kis boots.&#xD;
"Oh, a soldier should not mind trifles,&#xD;
you know," said he. (Max always fell back&#xD;
on his profession when a question of health&#xD;
&#xD;
116&#xD;
&#xD;
came up.) "Besides, I was restless last&#xD;
night, I could not sleep-something in the&#xD;
atmosphere, I suppose-and there was noth-&#xD;
ing for it but to turn out early this morning.&#xD;
Arthur left the house before I did, and, fancy-&#xD;
ing that he was coming over here to break-&#xD;
fast, I followed. But it seems I was mista-&#xD;
ken. If he is coming, he has not yet arrived."&#xD;
He looked at Norah very steadily as he&#xD;
uttered the last words, and Norah returned&#xD;
his glance unflinchingly.&#xD;
"I do not think Mr. Tyndale is coming,"&#xD;
she said. "At least, he did not mention&#xD;
such an intention when I left him ten minutes&#xD;
ago."&#xD;
"You have seen him, then l" said. Max.&#xD;
He could not help starting, though he added&#xD;
-almost involuntarily, as it seemed-" I sus-&#xD;
pectesl as much."&#xD;
"I hav6 had the pleasure of seeing him&#xD;
by appointment," she proceeded, with a cool-&#xD;
ness so unruffled that it amused even while it&#xD;
perplexed him. "You suspected t1~at, also,&#xD;
perhaps."&#xD;
"No," answered he, sitting down again&#xD;
in the chair from which he had risen, and&#xD;
looking at her very doubtfully-much as he&#xD;
might have looked at a spot where he had&#xD;
reason to suspect the existence of masked&#xD;
batteries-" no, I did not suspect that."&#xD;
"Yet what could have been more natu-~&#xD;
ral? Think how ruthlessly your friend Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford interrupted the most tender point&#xD;
~of our interview at Strafford the other day,&#xD;
~nd then wonder, if you can, that we should&#xD;
'have been anxious to resume it as soon as&#xD;
possible."&#xD;
* "I have ceased to wonder at any thing&#xD;
which a woman may say or do," answered&#xD;
'he, dryly. "Whether you are in earnest or.&#xD;
whether you are in jest, Heaven only knows&#xD;
-but, in either case, your conduct is quite&#xD;
inexplicable to me."&#xD;
"Is your cousin's conduct any more ex-&#xD;
plicable to you?" asked she. "Or have you&#xD;
ceased, also, to wonder at any thing which a&#xD;
man may do? Of the two, that would be the&#xD;
more useful frame of mind."&#xD;
"My cousin's conduct is sufficiently ex-&#xD;
plicable;" said he, with his whole face dark.&#xD;
ening. "He is not the first man whom I&#xD;
have known to forget where his honor and&#xD;
faith are due!"&#xD;
"It would be rather difficult to decide to&#xD;
urhom your cousin's honor anti faith are due,&#xD;
&#xD;
NORAR'S ARRANGEMENTS.               117&#xD;
&#xD;
would it not?" said she, carelessly. "A&#xD;
little while ago, he thought that they were&#xD;
due tQ Leslie. Now he decides that they are&#xD;
due to me."&#xD;
"Does he?" said Max, his face darkening&#xD;
still more; "and I suppose you agree with.&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
"4Jould I do 'other than agree with him?&#xD;
Captain Tyndale-you who have&#xD;
been prejudiced against me from the begin.&#xD;
ning-whether his honor and faith (as much&#xD;
as he has of either) do not belong to me by a&#xD;
better right than they do to Leslie?"&#xD;
"If you mean that he was bound to you&#xD;
first, I grant that" (a little reluctantly).&#xD;
" But still-"&#xD;
"But still," her lip curling proudly, "a&#xD;
Bohemian like myself-a bit of vagabond,&#xD;
flirting material-should know better than to&#xD;
take an pied de is retire all that a fine gentle-&#xD;
man may chance to say in the course of a&#xD;
summer idling!"&#xD;
"Iwas not going to say that, Miss Des-&#xD;
mond. You know I was not going to say&#xD;
that!"&#xD;
"What does it matter whether you were&#xD;
going ~o say it or not? ' You meant it. And&#xD;
you are not far wrong. Of course, it would&#xD;
be nonsense to talk of Mr. Tyndale's being&#xD;
bound to me if he was not good enough to&#xD;
allow the fact himself."&#xD;
If she had not taken pleasure just them&#xD;
in mocking herself in the bitterness of her&#xD;
spirit, she might have laughed outright at&#xD;
the expression of Max's eyes, as he regarded&#xD;
her-it was so grave and so thoroughly puz-&#xD;
zled. What to make of her he certainly did&#xD;
not know. She had been an enigma to him&#xD;
from the first. One while he thoroughly dis-&#xD;
trusted, and again as thoroughly trusted her.&#xD;
l{ow he did neither; he simply wondered&#xD;
what she meant.&#xD;
"Captain Tyndale," she said, suddenly,&#xD;
with impetuous decision, "why should we not&#xD;
speak plainly and understand each other?&#xD;
We have nothing to lose; we may have some-&#xD;
thing to gain by it. lam a waif and a stray,&#xD;
who n~ay naturally be supposed to want a&#xD;
home, who may naturally be excused for&#xD;
taking one, even under slightly unfavorable&#xD;
circumstances, if it were offered. You are&#xD;
in love with Leslie~ Nay "-holding up her&#xD;
hand imperatively, as he attempted to speak&#xD;
-" hear me out. We may serve each other's&#xD;
interests better than you think-at least I&#xD;
&#xD;

give i~e, for example, to accept an offer of&#xD;
marriage which Mr. Tyndale has generously&#xD;
made to me this morning-the fulfillment,&#xD;
you know, of our two years' engagement-&#xD;
dnd in this way leave the coast clear for&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"Miss Desmond I"&#xD;
It was fairly a gasp. Never had Max&#xD;
Tyndale beOn sothoroughly astonished.-never&#xD;
had his breath been so completely taken away&#xD;
by any creature born of woman as by this&#xD;
audacious girl. She had pushed her hat back&#xD;
from her flushed, beautiful face; her defiant&#xD;
eyes faced hltn fully. If she was not in&#xD;
earnest, it was at least certain that no one&#xD;
ever appeared more thoroughly so.&#xD;
"Well," she said, after a minute, quite&#xD;
impatiently, "lam waiting for your answer.&#xD;
You cannot def~y that you are in love with&#xD;
Leslie. I have been that from the first, and&#xD;
my eyes never deceive me. Now, if I elope&#xD;

pose that I shoi4d do, you will be able, with&#xD;
the least possible exercise of discretion and&#xD;
judgment, to step Into his vacated place."&#xD;
"Do you mean to tell me,'~ said Max, de-&#xD;
liberately, "that you are in carnest.-that&#xD;
Arthur has seriously asked you to elope with&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
"I am so entirely in earnest that the af-&#xD;
fair is ~ll arranged. We are to take ]'rench&#xD;
leave of Leslie's croquet.party to-night, to&#xD;
drive to Wexford, and take the ten-o'clock&#xD;
train for Alton. Arrived in the latter place,&#xD;
we can be~married at once) and sail for Eu-&#xD;
rope immediately thereafter. V~i14 foul?".&#xD;
"Arthur proposed this!" said Max, his&#xD;
breath coming short and hard, "anl you--&#xD;
may I venture~ to ask what you said to such&#xD;
an arrangement?"&#xD;
"Can you doubt that I dropped a cour-&#xD;
tesy, and thanked very humbly the gentleman&#xD;
who was kind enough to reward my long con-&#xD;
stanc~ by ~u~h a gratifying offer?"&#xD;
"I can imagine any thing in the world&#xD;
sooner than that you accepted it," said he,&#xD;
bluntly.&#xD;
"And pray why not?" asked she. "Is&#xD;
it nOt more than good en~iugh for me? Bah!&#xD;
Captain Tyndale, a truce to nonsense. Tell&#xD;
me, instead, whether you are prepared to take&#xD;
advantage of the golden opportunity which&#xD;
Arthur and I.-liberally aided and abetted by&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford'-...'mcan to give you?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"If you will excuse me," said Max, "it is&#xD;
you who are talking nonsense. I no more&#xD;
believe that you have agreed to elope with&#xD;
Arthur-well, than I believe that you have&#xD;
agreed to elope with me I" Then, after a&#xD;
short pause: "If you will only meet me&#xD;
frankly, as you did once before, and tell me&#xD;
what he has really said, and what you really&#xD;
mean to do, I shall be infinitely indebted to&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"That is exactly what I don't know. I&#xD;
have no idea what I mean to do, or what I&#xD;
ought to do," answered she, suddenly drop-&#xD;
ping her tone of defiant mockery, and looking&#xD;
at him wi~h grave, anxious eyes. "What&#xD;
shdll I do? Shall I pack my trunk, and tell&#xD;
Leslie the truth, or shall I simply leave her&#xD;
to learn, suspect, or guess it, as best she&#xD;
can?"&#xD;
"God knows ! "answered he. "The mat-&#xD;
ter has grown so complicated that it is far&#xD;
beyond my diplomatic abilities, which, as&#xD;
you are aware, were never of the best. It&#xD;
seems impossible to leave Miss Grahame in&#xD;
ignorance of Arthur's conduct, and yet it will&#xD;
be a terrible thing to tell her the truth."&#xD;
"But if we leave it untold, there is Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford ready to enlighten her," said Norah.&#xD;
lIe glanced at her quickly and keenly.&#xD;
"You know, then, that Mrs. Sandford was&#xD;
in the library at Strafford when-"&#xD;
"When our p'eux ~e1aeva1ier offered inc his&#xD;
hand and heart-or I believe it was only his&#xD;
heart on that occasion?" she said, as he&#xD;
paused. "Yes, I know it. So Leslie may&#xD;
hear the truth-or at least a garbled version&#xD;
of it-any day."&#xD;
"There, I think, you are mistaken," said&#xD;
he. "Mrs. Sandford promised me yesterday&#xD;
that she would, on no consideration, mention&#xD;
the matter to Miss Grahame."&#xD;
"Mrs. Sandford promised I" repeated No-&#xD;
rah. She leaned her head against the back&#xD;
of her chair and laughed. It was impossible&#xD;
to avoid it she had beard something like&#xD;
this so very recently. "how you men do&#xD;
believe in wounen-..&amp;amp;ometimes!" she said.&#xD;
"In pretty, innocent widows especially! I&#xD;
have discovered the 'open sesame' to your&#xD;
afihetions and trust, and, when I am thirty, I&#xD;
shall act as if Iwere six. Then I may be able&#xD;
to play eavesdropper in a library~window, and&#xD;
yet be credited with the most high-minded&#xD;
and honorable sentiments imaginable."&#xD;
"It is sca ~cely fair to call Mrs. Sandford&#xD;
&#xD;
or BoBEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
an eavesdropper," said Max, who liked Miss&#xD;
Desmond's caustic tone with regard to her&#xD;
own sex least of any thing about her. "It&#xD;
was purely accidental her being in the library,&#xD;
and she regretted it exceedingly."&#xD;
"Indeed!" (very dryly). "I confess&#xD;
my credulity is not as great as your own~&#xD;
perhaps because my appreciation of infantile&#xD;
blue eyes is less lively. It seems to hue that&#xD;
if Mrs. Sandford had regretted the accident&#xD;
which revealed to her a matter in which she&#xD;
had no possible concern, ~he would-have&#xD;
held her tongue."&#xD;
"I think she will hold it as far as Miss&#xD;
Grahame is concerned."&#xD;
"That is to say, you have faith in your&#xD;
influence over her. Well, you can best judge&#xD;
of the extent of that."&#xD;
"F see that you have very little faith in&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"You are mistaken. I only think that&#xD;
she does not love Ciesar less, but Rome more&#xD;
-in other words, her devotion to you is~great,&#xD;
but her devotion to mischief-waking is even&#xD;
greater."&#xD;
"We shall see."&#xD;
~Yes, we shall see. Meanwhile, have we&#xD;
decided upon any course of action? I must&#xD;
determine what to do."&#xD;
"It is a hard matter to tell,~~ said he,&#xD;
having recourse to the ends of his long mus-&#xD;
tache, and beginning to twist them cry hard&#xD;
indeed. After a short time spent in this way,&#xD;
he looked up with a deprecation which sat&#xD;
oddly on his face.&#xD;
"Don't think me very weak-minded, Miss&#xD;
Desmond, if I beg you to defer any definite&#xD;
action for-say twenty-four hours! Give me&#xD;
this time in which to sound Arthur, and find&#xD;
what he really desires and means to do. I-&#xD;
you can't tell how hard it is for inc to make&#xD;
up my mind to the necessity that Miss Gm-&#xD;
hame must hear the truth."&#xD;
"And yet how eagerly many men in your&#xD;
position would grasp such an opportunity!"&#xD;
said she, looking at him meditatively.&#xD;
He flushed-a very unusual thing with&#xD;
him. "Permit tue to say that your imagina-&#xD;
tion has led you entirely astray with regard&#xD;
to the feeling which I entertain for Miss Gra-&#xD;
hame," he said. "I will not deny thttt she&#xD;
charms ray taste more than any other woman&#xD;
I have ever known, and no doubt, if she had&#xD;
been free, I should very easily have fallen in&#xD;
love with her; but she was nof free-even in&#xD;

&#xD;
fancy-.when I met her first. Therefore, that&#xD;
which might have been love stopped short at&#xD;
sincere friendship."&#xD;
"Indeed l" said Norah again. It flutist&#xD;
be confessed that she arched her eyebrows a&#xD;
little incredulously. The young Bohemian&#xD;
had learned to look with very much the eye&#xD;
of a cynic upon any thing verging on pla~&#xD;
tonics.&#xD;
"Well," she said, after a short pause, "I&#xD;
am quite willing to give you twdhty -four&#xD;
hours in which to decide what 'sincere&#xD;
friendship' may dictate with regard to tell-&#xD;
ing Leslie the truth. But I should not advise&#xD;
you to be influenced by any thing which your&#xD;
cousin may promise or affirm. Captain Tyn-&#xD;
dale," she said, with sudden energy, "there&#xD;
is no truth in that man! If you do not re-&#xD;
alize and remember this, you will regret&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"I realize it fully," answered he, some-&#xD;
what sternly, "and I do not think there is the&#xD;
least danger of my forgetting it."&#xD;
At this point the conversation ended.&#xD;
The clock struck eight, and, like another Cin-&#xD;
derella, Numb rose. "I must go," she said.&#xD;
"I have my breakfast toilet yet to make,&#xD;
and if I stay longer, some one may come&#xD;
down and find us tifte4.I~te, which would be&#xD;
awkward-for you!"&#xD;
"Pray don't trouble yourself on my ac-&#xD;
count," said he. "I am not particularly afraid&#xD;
of Mrs. Griindy."&#xD;
But, as he spoke, she left the room.&#xD;
At breakfast everybody seemed languid-&#xD;
a very usual result of the exhausting heat of&#xD;
a Southern summer-night. As they came in&#xD;
one after another, the gentlemen in cool&#xD;
linen, the ladies in their lawns, significant&#xD;
signs of lassitude show~id in their faces and&#xD;
movements. Mrs. Middleton did not appear&#xD;
at all, and Leslie looked unusually pale as she&#xD;
sat at the head of the table pouring out cof-&#xD;
fee, which was as clear as brandy and "strong&#xD;
enough to knock a man down," the cook had&#xD;
said. Mrs. Sandford seemed to have fared&#xD;
better than any of the party, though she was&#xD;
most voluble in her complaints of enervation&#xD;
and heat. When Norah came in, she found&#xD;
her describing graphically her attempts to&#xD;
sleep during the r~ight. "What between the&#xD;
mosquitoes and the heat, one was in a regu-&#xD;
lar quandary," she said. "One could not put&#xD;
up one's bars, on account of the mosqultoies,&#xD;
nor keep them down on account of the heat.&#xD;

&#xD;
A DAU~IHTER OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
I confess I spent the night doing first one&#xD;
thing and then another."&#xD;
"And I spent it in smoking," said Carl,&#xD;
dropping a lump of sugar into his coffee-cup&#xD;
and motioning the cream -jug disdainfully&#xD;
away. "What a pity you had not thought&#xD;
,t~ tILaU It would have enabled you to defy&#xD;
both mosquitoes and heat.".&#xD;
"I will take a supply of paper and to-&#xD;
bacco up-stairs with me to-night, and amuse&#xD;
myself making cigarettes," said she.-" Miss&#xD;
Desmond, will you join me ?-Or, better still,&#xD;
can't we all sleep to-day, and spend the night&#xD;
on the lawn?"&#xD;
"Some of us might be very well disposed&#xD;
to sleep to-day, without any ultimate design&#xD;
of spending the night on the lawn," said Mr.&#xD;
Middleton. Then to Carl: "Will you tell me&#xD;
what possessed you to get up and knock the&#xD;
chairs about over my head at daylight this&#xD;
morning?"&#xD;
"I had really forgotten that your head&#xD;
was below me," answered Carl, "but I cannot&#xD;
remember that I did any particular knock-&#xD;
ing about of chairs. I chanced to be up at&#xD;
daylight simply because I had been up all&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"It was you, then, whom I heard going&#xD;
down-stairs somewhere about five o'clock?"&#xD;
"It may have been I~ I did go down-&#xD;
stairs shortly after that hour." -&#xD;
He looked across the table at Norah as&#xD;
he uttered the last words-it was a look com-&#xD;
pounded strangely of misery and triumph-a&#xD;
look which said as plainly as words could&#xD;
have done, that he was aware of her inter-&#xD;
view with Tyndale; and unfortunately others&#xD;
besides Norah were able to read its jealous&#xD;
significance. These others were Mre. Sand-&#xD;
ford and Leslie-Max might be added, only&#xD;
Max understood the full meaning of the&#xD;
glance, which they did not. A sharp pang&#xD;
seized L~slic's heart. At that moment she*&#xD;
thought only of Norah. What was Norab&#xD;
doing? - what was going On between Carl&#xD;
and hereelf?-what did that glance mean?&#xD;
It was too plainly, too desperately in earnest,&#xD;
not to mean something. In truth, Caji had&#xD;
forgotten himself and shot a veritable thun-&#xD;
der-bolt of war out of those brown, laughter-&#xD;
loving eyes of his. Norah received the thun-&#xD;
der-bolt composedly, but Mrs. Sandford gave&#xD;
a little dramatic start and looked at Max.&#xD;
She remembered the note of the night before,&#xD;
and it suddenly occurred to her, as it had oc-&#xD;
&#xD;
cured to Carl, that it might have meant-an&#xD;
appointment.&#xD;
Nothing more was said on the subject,&#xD;
however, and breakfast passed rather more&#xD;
silently than this sociable meal usually did at&#xD;
Rosland. After breakfast Max pleaded "busi-&#xD;
ness" as an excuse, and ~vent back to Straf-&#xD;
ford, much to Mrs. Sandford's disgust. She&#xD;
had flattered herself that her presence was&#xD;
the magnetic attraction which had drawn him&#xD;
forth at such an early hour, and she had in-&#xD;
tended to take him into the shrubbery again&#xD;
for the benevolent purpose of confiding to him&#xD;
the whole history of the note at night, and&#xD;
the appointment of the morning. But Max&#xD;
was deaf to her hints, and blind to the implor-&#xD;
ing glances of her eyes. Back to Strafford he&#xD;
went, and the pretty mischief-maker was left&#xD;
disconsolate. Carl, meanwhile, had met No-&#xD;
rah in the hall after breakfast, and spoken in&#xD;
the most open and decided manner.&#xD;
"I must see you ~ he said. "Will&#xD;
you come and take a walk with me?"&#xD;
"Is there any necessity why you should&#xD;
see me alone?" she asked. "It is very warm&#xD;
for walking."&#xD;
"We can go to the summer-house," he an-&#xD;
swered. "It will not be much warmer there&#xD;
now than it was at five o'clock~ this morn-&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
In making this remark, he was not aware&#xD;
that Mrs. Middleton was coming down the&#xD;
staircase just behind him, else he might not&#xD;
have spoken either so loudly or so significant-&#xD;
ly. Norah, who was aware of the fact, saw at&#xD;
once that she could not provoke any further&#xD;
allusion to her five-o'clock appointment. She&#xD;
extended her hand, therefore, and, lifting her&#xD;
hat from the table near bysaid, coldly:&#xD;
"We can take a short walk, if you desire&#xD;
it."&#xD;
He had no cause to congratulate himself,&#xD;
however, for no sooner were they safely out&#xD;
of the house than she turned upon him haugh-&#xD;
tily.&#xD;
"What is the meaning of this?" she&#xD;
asked. "What right have you to demand an&#xD;
interview with me in such a manner as this?"&#xD;
"As much right as Mr. Tyndale had to ap-&#xD;
point one, I suppose," answered he, losing all&#xD;
control of himself.&#xD;
But he saw in a moment that he had made&#xD;
a mistake. There was nothing of tameness&#xD;
in the lightning that flashed upon him from&#xD;
Norah's eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You forget yourself!" she said. "The&#xD;
distinction which makes a difference between&#xD;
Mr. Tyndale aud yourself is the distinction of&#xD;
my choice. I chose to meet him this morn-&#xD;
ing: I do not choose to walk with you now.&#xD;
Therefore, I shall return to the house.&#xD;
She turned majestically; but, as she did&#xD;
so, he turned also, and, keeping close to her&#xD;
side, spoke with imploring haste.&#xD;
- "Pray forgive me!" he said. "I have&#xD;
offended you. I should not have said that.&#xD;
But, if you could know how wretched, how&#xD;
miserable,*1 am!-"&#xD;
It was almost identically the same thing&#xD;
which Tyndale had said before him. At this&#xD;
repetition, Norah's patience-never, as we are&#xD;
aware, of particularly long tether-altogether&#xD;
gave way.&#xD;
"4nd, pray, why should I desire to&#xD;
know?" she asked. "It cannot be particu-&#xD;
larly interesting to learn exactly how wretched&#xD;
and miserable you may chance to fancy your-&#xD;
self. On the contrary, you must excuse me&#xD;
if I say that a spy deserves to be miser-&#xD;
able!"&#xD;
"And you think I am a spy!" he said, a&#xD;
deep, burning flush overspreading his face.&#xD;
"Can I think otherwise?" she asked,&#xD;
pausing for the better convenience of facing&#xD;
him. "Can you deny that you watched, that&#xD;
you even followed, me this morning? What&#xD;
is that but the conduct of a spy?"&#xD;
"It is the conduct of a man who loves you&#xD;
too well to think of any thing but that love!"&#xD;
he answered.&#xD;
But the-manner in which her short upper&#xD;
lip curled was not particularly encouraging to&#xD;
this plea: "A man of honor loves like a man&#xD;
of honor," she said. "He may forget every&#xD;
thing else, but he never forgets his hon.&#xD;
or."&#xD;
Carl's brow knitted, and his hands invol-&#xD;
untarily clinched themselves. It was hard&#xD;
work to keep down the excitement within&#xD;
him, hftrd work to allow no expression to the&#xD;
overmastering force of his jealous and resent-&#xD;
ful passion:&#xD;
"I do not think that I have quite forgotten&#xD;
my honor," he said, with a sort of forced&#xD;
calmness that sat strangely on him, and did&#xD;
not promise exceedingly well for fair weather&#xD;
ahead in the way of temper. "At least I&#xD;
have never made love to one woman while I&#xD;
was engaged to another."&#xD;
"What extraordinary self-control!" said&#xD;
&#xD;
CARL M&#xD;
&#xD;
A SPY.                            121&#xD;
Norab. "But, if a man has never robbed a&#xD;
henroost, is that any reason why he should&#xD;
feel particularly virtuous in stealing a hare?"&#xD;
It was now Carl's turn to draw himself up&#xD;
haughtily: the homeliness of the comparison&#xD;
made it doubly odious.&#xD;
"You misunderstand me entirely if you&#xD;
think that I acted as a spy-upon your move-&#xD;
ments this morning," lie said. "I spoke the&#xD;
honest truth at breakfast when I said that I&#xD;
had been up all night, and I was just thinking&#xD;
of turning in when I saw you leave the house&#xD;
and cross the lawn. I was very much sur-'&#xD;
prised-you can credit that, I am sure-and,&#xD;
suspecting that you had gone to meet Tyn-&#xD;
dale, I-I simply wished to set my suspicions&#xD;
at rest one way or another. So I followed&#xD;
you, and, as soon as I saw that you kad gone&#xD;
to meet him, I came away."&#xD;
"Naturally-after having gained all that&#xD;
you wanted," said she.&#xD;
"And now," said he, ignoring the con-&#xD;
temptuous indifference of her tone, "I want&#xD;
to ask if this is to continue? How has this&#xD;
man so much influence over you, that you-&#xD;
you whom he has denied and insulted-will&#xD;
accord him private interviews, and keep ap-&#xD;
pointments which he has made?" Then,&#xD;
waxing more passionate: "flow does he dare&#xD;
to trifle with you like this? Is it because he&#xD;
knows, or thinks, that you have no defender?&#xD;
0 Norah-Miss Desmond-only say one word,&#xD;
and I will show him how far you are from&#xD;
being defenseless!"&#xD;
All this, which might have been very ab-&#xD;
surd and melodramatic, was, in truth, so deep.&#xD;
ly, tr~igically earnest, that even Norah felt&#xD;
no inclination to laugh. Young as she was,&#xD;
she had seen much of the mischief which the&#xD;
passions of men sometimes work even in this&#xD;
eminently practical age of ours, and there-&#xD;
fore she felt a little uneasy as she faced the&#xD;
desperate, passionate eyes of the man before&#xD;
her. She certainly did not want another&#xD;
complication of trouble on her hands. Per-&#xD;
haps it was on this account that her voice&#xD;
was softer when she spoke again.&#xD;
"flow often must I tell you that I need&#xD;
no defender? I am able to take care of my-&#xD;
self if a dozen Arthur Tyndales were matched&#xD;
against me, instead of one!"&#xD;
"Are you sure of that?" he asked. He&#xD;
did not say, as he had done once before, that&#xD;
he knew she was. Besides being desperate&#xD;
and passionate, his eyes were just then full&#xD;

122&#xD;
&#xD;
A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
of painful doubt. Like Max, he too was&#xD;
puzzled what to think of her.&#xD;
"You know how I love yen," he went on,&#xD;
wistfully, after a moment. "You know how,&#xD;
happy I should be if you would only make&#xD;
this love of some account to you l-if you&#xD;
would only let me make it a shield to hold&#xD;
between you and the world! If you would&#xD;
only give me the right which, if you do not&#xD;
give me, I may take for myself, to call this&#xD;
scoundrel to account! I have tried to be pa-&#xD;
tient, but I can bear it no longcr-Norah, is&#xD;
there no hope for me? ".&#xD;
Norah looked at him intently as he stood&#xD;
before her - eager, impassioned, desperately&#xD;
in earnest. The protection that he offered&#xD;
was much, the love that he offered was more,&#xD;
the wealth and position that 'he could give&#xD;
were most of all in the scale of temptation to&#xD;
this girl who had been an outlaw from her&#xD;
birth. But outlaw and Bohemian though she&#xD;
was, the instinct of the woman was strong&#xD;
within her-that divine instinct which, un-&#xD;
warped by social training, recoils even from&#xD;
love, when love in turn does not rise to wel-&#xD;
come it.&#xD;
"Why should I giv'e you hope?" she&#xD;
asked at last, very slowly. "'I suppose I&#xD;
ought to thank you for loving me-though&#xD;
really I should have much preferred you had&#xD;
lot-but I do not love you."&#xD;
"That may be because you still love Ar-&#xD;
thur Tyndale," said he, bitterly.&#xD;
It would have been an ill-advised speech&#xD;
to make to any woman. To Norah Desmond&#xD;
it was a speech which signed ~nd sealed his&#xD;
metaphorical death -warrant at once. She&#xD;
drew herself up to the full height of her&#xD;
stately figure, the eloquent blood flashing&#xD;
into her fair cheeks, her eyes expanding with&#xD;
their superb full-orbed glow.&#xD;
"A few minutes ago I was foolish enough&#xD;
to imagine that the sentiment of love included&#xD;
that of respect," she said. "You are kind&#xD;
enough to show me my mistake. At least, it'&#xD;
is impossible to imagine that you can enter-&#xD;
tain the faintest semblance of such a feeling&#xD;
for the woman whom you insult by declaring&#xD;
that she may be in love with the man who is&#xD;
engaged to her sister! Understand, once for&#xD;
all, that this subject is ended between us!"&#xD;
she went on, with a sharp edge' to her voice.&#xD;
"If you have clung to a single thregd of hope&#xD;
up to this time, I snap it now! Henceforth&#xD;
~ou have no concern with me or uiy affairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
It does not matter to you what I choose to&#xD;
do, or whom I choose to meet. When you&#xD;
made yourself a spy upon me, you ended at&#xD;
once and forever any regard which I felt, or&#xD;
might have learned to feel, for you!"&#xD;
Pitiless as youth is prone to be, and too&#xD;
angry to care what dangerous strife of pas-&#xD;
sions she might have awakened, she turned&#xD;
and walked away, leaving those stinging&#xD;
words behind her. This time Carl made no&#xD;
effort to follow, lie only felt, as he watched&#xD;
her cross the sliadow.dappled lawn and enter&#xD;
the house, that he had, with rude, impatient&#xD;
hand, shaken down his last leaf of hope.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
"Not from the heart beneath-&#xD;
'Twas a bubble born of breath,&#xD;
Neither sneer nor vaunt&#xD;
Nor reproach nor taunt-&#xD;
See a word how it sever~th!&#xD;
Oh, power of life and ileteth&#xD;
In the tongue, as the preacher saithU'&#xD;
"LEsLIS," said Mrs. Middleton, gravely,&#xD;
"I really do not like the manner in which&#xD;
things seem to be going on between Carl and&#xD;
Miss Desmond."&#xD;
For a wonder, the two ladies of the house&#xD;
were alone. After Max had taken his de.&#xD;
parture, and Norah and Carl had disappeared,&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford had retired to her chamber-&#xD;
in a fit of misanthropy, probably-and Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton, entering the sitting-room, found&#xD;
Leslie quite alone and quite idle, with a&#xD;
strange, preoccupied look on her face. It was&#xD;
so unusual to see Leslie idle; and' so entirely&#xD;
without precedent, to see her wear that intro.&#xD;
spective expression, that her aunt might have&#xD;
been startled into uneasiness if her thoughts&#xD;
at that time had not been full of Carl's infat-&#xD;
uation and its probable consequences. As it&#xD;
was, the significant attitude, and more sig.&#xD;
nificant expression, only made a mon~ntary&#xD;
impression upon her.&#xD;
"What has happened, auntie?" asked&#xD;
Miss Grahame, looking up. "What is going&#xD;
on between Carl and Norah that you do not&#xD;
like?"&#xD;
"You might see what is going on," an-&#xD;
swered the elder lady, in a vexed tone. "Of&#xD;
course, you may say that flirtation does not&#xD;
generally mean any thing; but when it is&#xD;
flirtation between a man as headstrong as&#xD;
&#xD;
Carl, and a girl who is naturally auxiobs to&#xD;
establish herself in life, like Miss Desmond,&#xD;
it may come to mean a great deal."&#xD;
"I am afraid Carl is very much in love&#xD;
with Norah," said Leslie, in the tone of one&#xD;
who makes a reluctant admission. "But I&#xD;
really do not think she is in the least in love&#xD;
with him."&#xD;
"In love!" repeated Mrs Middleton, im-&#xD;
patiently. "Who talked of her being in&#xD;
love? Do you suppose that a woman like&#xD;
Miss Desihoud is likely to marry foa- love?"&#xD;
"I don't know," answered Leslie, doubt-&#xD;
fully. Somehow the question brought a slight&#xD;
cloud over her face. Was she only just be-&#xD;
"inning to realize how little she knew of this&#xD;
strange sister of hers?&#xD;
"The mere idea is absurd!" said her&#xD;
aunt, with decision. "Women of Miss Des-&#xD;
mond's stamp-.-I put the unfortunate circum-&#xD;
stances of her life entirely out of considera-&#xD;
tion-are the last women in the world to in-&#xD;
troduce a matter of sentiment into the im-&#xD;
portant business of their establishment. If&#xD;
Carl is mad enough to offer l4mself, you may&#xD;
be sure that she will accept him without any&#xD;
hesitation on the score of what she may or&#xD;
may not feel for him!"&#xD;
"Carl has been in love very often before,"&#xD;
said Leslie, by way of consolation.&#xD;
"That makes it all the wor~e," promptly&#xD;
rejoined Mrs. Middleton. "He has now passed&#xD;
the age for boyish fancies, and this is likely&#xD;
to be a serious matter. You know his tem-&#xD;
~erament-.-~you know' how impulsive he is&#xD;
about every thing. 0 Leslie, I am sorry to&#xD;
reproach you, but if you had only listened to&#xD;
the advice of your uncle and myself, none of&#xD;
this trouble would have come to pass."&#xD;
"Yet I did not think of myself-I meant&#xD;
to act for the best," said Leslie. She spoke&#xD;
more to herself'than to her aunt. She seemed&#xD;
to be answering some inward appeal. She&#xD;
had not thought of herself, she had meant to&#xD;
act for the best-for Norah and for Kate-&#xD;
why, then, should this strange, new suspicion,&#xD;
this complicating trouble of more than one&#xD;
kind, have sprung from what she had done?&#xD;
"~Jy darling, who knows that better thai1&#xD;
I?" said Mrs. Middleton, coming over an~&#xD;
kissing her. "Don't think that I am blam-&#xD;
ing you-I would not do that for the world-&#xD;
I only mean, if you had listened, Leslie!"&#xD;
"Yes, I know it is all my fault," said&#xD;
Leslie. "You may blame inc as much as&#xD;
&#xD;
MRS. MIDDLET(&#xD;
&#xD;
)N AND LESLIE.                      12S&#xD;
you like, and I am very sorry that I have&#xD;
brought anxiety to Uncle George and your-&#xD;
self; but still I have a conviction -it is&#xD;
borne in upon me, as the Quakers say-that&#xD;
Norah will never marry Carl."&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton shook her head. Just&#xD;
then she stood as the personification of&#xD;
worldly wisdom, and worldly wisdom de-&#xD;
clined to credit the idea of a girl, without a&#xD;
shilling, refusing to marry a man who was&#xD;
young, sufficiently good-looking, of fair for-&#xD;
tune, and unexceptionable social position.&#xD;
"There is no question but that she will&#xD;
marry him if he is foolish enough to offer&#xD;
himself," said the worldly-wise woman. "If&#xD;
you could have heard what I did a few min-&#xD;
utes ago! I was coming down-stairs, and&#xD;
they were in the hail. Carl asked Miss Des-&#xD;
mend to go to walk, and she answered that it&#xD;
was too warm. Then he said, in the most&#xD;
significant tone-a tone which plainly meant&#xD;
something which they beth understood-that&#xD;
they could go to the summer-house, where it&#xD;
would not be warmer than at five o'clock this&#xD;
1~1orning. Miss t~esmond was apparently&#xD;
about to refuse, but, looking up at that mo-&#xD;
ment and seeing me, she took her hat and&#xD;
went. Ko~v, Leslie, I would not say any&#xD;
thing in the world to hurt your feelings, but&#xD;
you can ask yourself whether any but a very&#xD;
fast girl would be likely to act in such a man-&#xD;
ner as that."&#xD;
"In such a manner as what? It does&#xD;
not follow that Norah was at the summer-&#xD;
house at five o'clock, because Carl said that&#xD;
it is no warmer there now than it was then,"&#xD;
answered Leslie, though her heart sank. She&#xD;
remembered the glance at the breakfast.table&#xD;
-a glance which did not look much as if&#xD;
Carl had becu the companion of Miss Des-&#xD;
mend's walk, or the person with ~vhem she&#xD;
kept an appointment.&#xD;
"The tone was more significant than the&#xD;
words," said Mrs. Middleton, whose eyes and&#xD;
ears were beth more than ordinarily quick.&#xD;
"My dear, there was something connected&#xD;
with the summer-house at five o'clock, you&#xD;
may be sure. When Miss Desmond saw me&#xD;
she changed color, and you may judge wheth.&#xD;
er she was likely or net to have done that&#xD;
without cause."&#xD;
Leslie, answered nothing. She knew No-&#xD;
rah's supreme self-possession too well to deny&#xD;
this telling point.&#xD;
"Besides," said Mrs. Middleton, "I&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8066-00000073"/>&#xD;
124:               A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.                                                     THE TWO SISTERS.                   125&#xD;
&#xD;
asked Robert, whom I met a moment later,&#xD;
if he knew whether any one had left the&#xD;
house very early this morning. He said that&#xD;
the glass door at the end of the side-passage&#xD;
was ajar when he first opened the house, and&#xD;
that about seven o'clock Miss Desmond came&#xD;
in from the shrubbery."&#xD;
"But this only shows that she took a&#xD;
walk," said Leslie. Her heart was growing&#xD;
sorer every moment with a soreness of which&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton did not even faintly guess;&#xD;
but she fought loyally for Norah all the same.&#xD;
"Surely, dear Aunt Mildred, there is no harm&#xD;
in that. I don't think the strtitest.laced per-&#xD;
son in the world could call it improper to&#xD;
take a walk in the shrubbery and come back&#xD;
at seven o'clock. As for an appointment&#xD;
with Carl-why should she make an appoint.&#xD;
ment with him when they can see each other&#xD;
at any and every hour of the day?"&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton only shook her head again.&#xD;
rroof she had none; but her conviction was&#xD;
as a mountain.&#xD;
"There was something more than a mere&#xD;
walk in question," she said. "Carl would&#xD;
never have spoken, Miss Desmond would&#xD;
never have looked, as they did, if there had&#xD;
not been! Leslie, what did I tell you the&#xD;
day that she came? Did I not tell you that&#xD;
I distrusted her? This distrust has grown&#xD;
with every hour since that time until now-&#xD;
now I feel confident that she is playing some&#xD;
underhand game which will shock us dread-&#xD;
fully when it comes to light 1"&#xD;
"How can you say such a thing~" said&#xD;
Leslie. She grew suddenly pale. That feel-&#xD;
ing which the French call a ses'rement du ewur&#xD;
seized her in its terrible constriction. For a&#xD;
minute she could not utter another word.&#xD;
The scene of the preceding night rose before&#xD;
her with startling vividness; she seemed to&#xD;
be looking again out of the shadowy dark-&#xD;
ness down the long, lighted room to where&#xD;
Norah sat in all her brilliant beauty at the&#xD;
piano, with Arthur Tyndale's fair, handsome&#xD;
face bending over her. She saw the slip of&#xD;
folded paper pass from one to the other; she&#xD;
heard again Carl's bitter, jealous speech, the&#xD;
memory of which came back to her like a&#xD;
~fiash of illuminating light~ "Perhaps they&#xD;
lack an opportunity, and desire to make one."&#xD;
Was that what five o'clock in thea summer-&#xD;
house meant?&#xD;
But she had a brave, proud heart, and she&#xD;
refused to be overcome by the dark thoughts&#xD;
&#xD;
and 'darker doubts which rushed upon her.&#xD;
She set her back, as it were, against a wall,&#xD;
crying out to her foes as they came, "I will&#xD;
not yield to you! I will not lower myself,&#xD;
and, it may be, wrong others, by listening to&#xD;
these demons of suspicion and jealousy which&#xD;
I have all my life held in scorn!', And she&#xD;
controlled all outward expression of that&#xD;
which wrung her heart as few women of twice&#xD;
her age could have done. It was strange,&#xD;
but it is nevertheless true, that at this mo-&#xD;
ment of all moments-this moment when, in&#xD;
a lower nature, the iron of suspicion would&#xD;
have entered the soul to poison every gen.&#xD;
erous impulse-a dim, struggling sense of&#xD;
something akin to the grand old noblesse oblige&#xD;
came to Leslie. "This is the hour of trial,"&#xD;
an inward voice seemed to. say. "Now prove&#xD;
whether or not you are able to rise above it!&#xD;
Prove whether or not it is of necessity that this&#xD;
pang should debase as well as torture you!"&#xD;
And she rose above it-for the time, at&#xD;
least. There was something almost heroic in&#xD;
the effort which it cost her to turn to her&#xD;
aunt and say quietly, though with slightly.&#xD;
quivering lips:&#xD;
"I think-I hope-that you wrong Norah.&#xD;
I do not believe that she would play an un-&#xD;
derhand game of any kind. As for Carl, I&#xD;
am almost sure that she has no idea of mar.&#xD;
rying him."&#xD;
"I can scarcely believe that," said Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton. "But, if it were possible to find&#xD;
out what she really means to do, I should he&#xD;
in a measure relieved. Leslie, I don't want&#xD;
to ask you to do any thing disagreeable, but&#xD;
she is your sister, after all, and-and if you&#xD;
could find out something definite about her&#xD;
intentions-"&#xD;
"I fear it is impossi-" Leslie was begin-&#xD;
ning, when the sound of a step, the rustle of&#xD;
a dress in the hall, made her start &amp;amp;nd turn.&#xD;
She expected to see Mrs. Sandford, but in-&#xD;
stead it wasNorab, who, having advanced to&#xD;
the door, stood there, framed like a beautiful&#xD;
picture.&#xD;
For a moment that slight, embarrassing&#xD;
pause fell which even the most highly-bred&#xD;
people are sometimes unable to rostraiji when&#xD;
a person of whom they have been talking&#xD;
suddenly appears.&#xD;
Then Mrs. Middleton broke the silence&#xD;
with one of her courteous commonplaces.&#xD;
"I am afraid you found the sun too warm&#xD;
for walking, after all, Miss Desmond."&#xD;
&#xD;
"It is very warm," answered Norah; but&#xD;
she did not say in words, orimply iz~ manner,.&#xD;
that she had returned to the house on ac-&#xD;
count of the heat. "Shall I disturb~you if I&#xD;
come in?" she added, after a moment.&#xD;
"You seemed so much engaged that I hesi-&#xD;
tated:"&#xD;
"There was no need to hesitate; you will&#xD;
not disturb us in the least," answered both&#xD;
ladies.&#xD;
"Indeed, we were just speaking of you,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Middleton, taking the bull by the&#xD;
horns with an ease which did her infinite&#xD;
credit.&#xD;
"Perhaps for that very reason I had bet-&#xD;
ter not conic in," said Norah. "You may&#xD;
not have quite exhausted the subject, and, in&#xD;
that case, it would be a pity to interrupt&#xD;
you."j&#xD;
"We were not discussing, but only speak-&#xD;
ing of you," said Leslie, with her sweet, frank&#xD;
smile. "Is there not a difference? But I&#xD;
think you might trust your character in my&#xD;
hands."&#xD;
"I think I might," answered the other,&#xD;
looking at her with a quick glance-a glance&#xD;
compounded strangely of various expressions&#xD;
-as she entered the room nnd crossed the&#xD;
floor.&#xD;
"Did not Carl come in with you?" asked&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton, looking at her in turn with&#xD;
rather keen scrutiny as she sat down and un-&#xD;
tied her hat.&#xD;
"No," was the reply. "I left him in the&#xD;
shrubbery."&#xD;
"You did not go to the summer-house,&#xD;
then&#xD;
"No" (as indifferently as before), "we&#xD;
did not walk so far."&#xD;
"It is too warm fo:- walking," said Leslie,&#xD;
quickly. This identical remark had been&#xD;
made, on an average, at least fifty times a day&#xD;
during the last week; but Miss Grahame was&#xD;
too anxious. to change the conversation to&#xD;
make any effort for novelty at that moment.&#xD;
"It is very warm!" said Mrs. Middleton,&#xD;
with an equal degree of original brilliance.&#xD;
Then she opened her fan, and, rising, walked&#xD;
away. "I had almost forgotten that I must&#xD;
see Betsy," she said.-Betsy was the house-&#xD;
keeper, and quite a character in he~ line.&#xD;
So it was that the two sisters found them-&#xD;
selves alone. Leslie understood perfectly that&#xD;
her aunt had gone, because she was anxious&#xD;
to give her a fair opportunity to sound the&#xD;
&#xD;
depths of Miss Desmond's intentions with re-&#xD;
gard to Carl; but Leslie, who would not have&#xD;
felt a particular aptitude for such a task at&#xD;
any time, was peculiarly conscious just now&#xD;
of her utter inability to cope with Norah's&#xD;
reticence and self- possession. She might&#xD;
have been a little surprised if she had known&#xD;
that Norah was at that moment endeavoring&#xD;
to determine how she could best sound the&#xD;
depths of her character and intentions.&#xD;
A minute of silence passed, which Leslie&#xD;
was the first to break-half timidly:&#xD;
"We have seen~ so little of each other&#xD;
since you have been here, Norah! I wonder&#xD;
if you have-felt it as well as I? It has really&#xD;
pressed upon me with a constant weight of&#xD;
regret. I have been sorry that there should&#xD;
have been so many people to come between&#xD;
us, so many social engagements to separate&#xD;
us. We are not half so well acquainted as I&#xD;
should like for us to be."&#xD;
"Perhaps we are sufficiently well acquaint-&#xD;
ed," said Norah, in her careless way. "Per-&#xD;
haps, if you knew me better, you might not&#xD;
like me at all. I-think that you do like me a&#xD;
little now," she added, witl~ a slight, wistful&#xD;
cadence in her tone.&#xD;
"I like you very much, indeed," said Les-&#xD;
lie, frankly; "and I am sure I should soon&#xD;
grow to love you dearly. How can you think&#xD;
that, under any circumstances, I could possi-&#xD;
bly not like you at all?"&#xD;
"Because we have been reared so differ-&#xD;
ently," was the response. "Because we must,&#xD;
of necessity, possess so little in common.&#xD;
We belong to different worlds; we bear the&#xD;
stamp of different trainings-bear it not only&#xD;
outwardly but inwardly-and hence it maybe&#xD;
better that we should see each other (at least,&#xD;
that you should see me) in the superficial&#xD;
manner which you regret."&#xD;
"I do not believe it," said Leslie. Despite&#xD;
the suspicious tugging at her heart, it was&#xD;
impossible for her to believe it, as she looked&#xD;
at the face before her. "You wrong yourself&#xD;
when you talk so! You do not know what&#xD;
some-some people might imply! They might&#xD;
think that there was a radical defect in your&#xD;
character or your training."&#xD;
"They would not be far wrong," said the&#xD;
other, bitterly. "A radical defect, did you&#xD;
say? There might be a hundred, for all the&#xD;
effort to the contrary any one ever made-ex-&#xD;
cept Kate-Kate, who has been an augel ever&#xD;
since she was born! That is a queer thing&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="126-127" xml:id="VAC8066-00000074"/>&#xD;
126                      A DAUGHTER&#xD;
to say of the daughter of a Bohemian adven-&#xD;
turer, is it Dot? But, then, she comes of&#xD;
Irish blood. And every man and woman and&#xD;
child in Ireland has the blood of saints and&#xD;
martyrs in their veins. You would never&#xD;
guess it from some of us-from papa or from&#xD;
me, for example-.-but it comes out in Kate."&#xD;
"I should like to know Kate," said Les.&#xD;
lie, smiling a little. "But, still, I am glad to&#xD;
know you-very glad! And we are sisters,&#xD;
Norah," she added. "Don't forget that! I&#xD;
feel half envious as I see your eyes light up&#xD;
when you talk of Kate. She has had you,&#xD;
and you have had her-.but I have had no-&#xD;
body!"&#xD;
"You may envy me the possession of&#xD;
Kate as much as you please, and with good&#xD;
cause," said Norah, "but you need not envy&#xD;
Kate the possession of me. I have given her&#xD;
any amount of trouble all my life, or, rather,&#xD;
all her life, for I am the oldest."&#xD;
"If you have gone through the world&#xD;
turning men's heads and breaking men's&#xD;
hearts as you have do~ie in the short time&#xD;
you have been here, I scarcely wonder," said&#xD;
Leslie. She saw her opportunity, and took&#xD;
advantage of it after a fashion; but she could&#xD;
not help feeling mean as she did so. It seemed&#xD;
like making an attempt to surprise Norah's&#xD;
confidence. She might have spared her .com.&#xD;
functions if she had only known how little&#xD;
Norah's confidence was lj~ely to be sur-&#xD;
prised.&#xD;
"Have I turned anybody's head or broken&#xD;
anybody's heart since I have been here?"&#xD;
asked that young lady. "I really think you&#xD;
must be mistaken. One cannot work de-&#xD;
struction-at least, not tha~ kind of destruc-&#xD;
tion-without being aware of it."&#xD;
"Oh! I think one can," said Leslie. "At&#xD;
least, I mean one may learn that one has&#xD;
worked it too late." (" She is thinking of&#xD;
Captain Tyndale!" commented her hearer&#xD;
mentally.) "But I am sure you will not pre-&#xD;
tend to deny that Carl is in love with you!"&#xD;
"Why should I deny it?" asked Norah.&#xD;
"It is no fault of mine, even if it is a dis-&#xD;
credit to him. But I thought you were talk-&#xD;
ing of something which had occurred since I&#xD;
came here."&#xD;
"And had 1l~is occurred before you came&#xD;
here, then?~' cried Leslie, astonished, but&#xD;
somewhat relieved. -" It has not been my&#xD;
fault, after all!" she thought.&#xD;
"Perhaps I ought to refer you to your&#xD;
&#xD;
cousin for an answer to that question," an-&#xD;
swered Norah. "He had never done me the&#xD;
honor to ask me to marry him, before we&#xD;
came here; but, of course, any woman, with&#xD;
a grain of common-sense, knows when a man&#xD;
is in love with her."&#xD;
"And now that he has asked you-for,&#xD;
of course, he has-" said Leslie, eagerly, "do&#xD;
you mean to marry him? 0 Norah, if this is&#xD;
so-,,&#xD;
"But it is not so!" interposed Norah,&#xD;
sharply. "What have you seen-in me-to&#xD;
make you fancy such a thing?"&#xD;
"I have seen nothing whatever to make&#xD;
me fancy that you are in love with Carl," said&#xD;
Leslie, thinking that she would round boldly,&#xD;
since she was sounding at all. "But some&#xD;
women-that is, all women-'do not wait for&#xD;
love in making up their minds to marry."&#xD;
"That is very true, indeed; and it would&#xD;
ill become any one like me to talk high.&#xD;
minded sentiment on such a subject, would&#xD;
it not? But still I may be permitted to say&#xD;
that, if there are other things besides love to&#xD;
be taken into consideration, there are also&#xD;
other things besides carriages and horses--&#xD;
excellent as they are!"&#xD;
"Nobody can deny that," said Leslie; but&#xD;
she looked a little puzzled-what was coming&#xD;
next?&#xD;
Sympathy is the first of these things,"&#xD;
said Norah. "I don't mean romantic sym-&#xD;
pathy-union of heart and soul, and all that&#xD;
absurdity-..-but the rational sympathy of&#xD;
tastes, habits, breeding, and inclinations.&#xD;
This is essential. I would rather share a&#xD;
garret and a crust of bread with a thorough-&#xD;
ly sympathetic person, than li~o in a palace&#xD;
with one whose ideas, tastes, and opinions&#xD;
jarred upon, wearied, and yet controlled me.&#xD;
The next great essential is freedom. I have&#xD;
belonged from my birth to the Bedoulas of&#xD;
civilization. A tread-mill of commonplace do-&#xD;
mestic or social life would prove so utterly&#xD;
unendurable to me that no paraphernalia of&#xD;
wealth-no carriages, diamonds, millinery, or&#xD;
furniture-could reconcile me to it. I should&#xD;
like money very much-as much, I suppose,&#xD;
as anybody else in the world- but money&#xD;
would be to me what it was to Robinson Cru-&#xD;
soe on his~desert island if I could not go into&#xD;
the world--my world-to spend it. And, in&#xD;
speaking of my world, you must not think&#xD;
that I mean Bohemia-I would gladly shake&#xD;
off that tomorrow, if I could-but I mean the&#xD;
&#xD;
OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
great world, the world in which people live,&#xD;
instead of merely vegetating! So, you see"&#xD;
-smiling faintly and a little scornfully-&#xD;
"that your uncle and aunt may quiet their&#xD;
anxiety. Though your cousin offers me sev-&#xD;
eral very good gifts - himself among the&#xD;
number-they are gifts in a form which would&#xD;
be worse than useless tp me. When the first&#xD;
restlessness of youth is over, he will settle&#xD;
down into the groove in which his fathers&#xD;
and grandfathers have walked before him.&#xD;
Do you think that I could share such a life?&#xD;
Not with the wild blood that is in my veins-&#xD;
not with the wild love of change and excite-&#xD;
ment in my heart."&#xD;
"But do change and excitement make&#xD;
happiness?" asked Leslie.&#xD;
"Does any thing make happiness?" was&#xD;
the cynical rejoinder. "Of happiness as a&#xD;
positive state, I know nothing. I am only&#xD;
able to make my comparison by the greater&#xD;
or lesser degree of' misery and discomfort."&#xD;
"0 Norali!"&#xD;
"You see, I told you that perhaps it is as&#xD;
well that our acquaintance heretofore has&#xD;
been superficial," said Norah. "If we knew&#xD;
each other well, I should only shock you.&#xD;
One who has been tossed about the world as&#xD;
I have been is not likely to look at things as&#xD;
you do, and I have always observed that hnp-&#xD;
py people regard with suspicion and distrust&#xD;
the unfortunate class for whom life has not&#xD;
been painted in rose-color. They look upon&#xD;
it as a striking instance of the depravity of&#xD;
humau taste that anybody should choose to&#xD;
be miserable in such an agreeable world."&#xD;
"Where did you learn such ideas?" asked&#xD;
Leslie, in a tone of absolute pain. "Would&#xD;
you believe rue if I were to say that you are&#xD;
entirely wrong?"&#xD;
"I am not sure how far I might perjure&#xD;
myself if you looked at me with such wistful&#xD;
eyes as those," answered Norah, smiling.&#xD;
"So perhaps I had better go" (she rose as&#xD;
she spoke). "I was awake very early this&#xD;
morning, and I feel like anticipating my siesta&#xD;
by several hours."&#xD;
"Awake very early this morning!'~ Those&#xD;
words brought back the doubts which, for a&#xD;
moment, Leslie had forgotten. Her change&#xD;
of countenance was so great and so entirely&#xD;
beyond her control, that Norah saw it and&#xD;
stopped short. "She suspects or knows part.&#xD;
of the truth !" she thought; "shall I tell her&#xD;
the rest?" The words necessary for doing&#xD;
&#xD;
OF BOHEMIAN.                                                   A LOST OPPORTUNITY.                   127&#xD;
&#xD;
127&#xD;
&#xD;
so rushed to her lips. In another second they&#xD;
would have found utterance, if the recollec-&#xD;
tion of her promise to Max Tyndale had not&#xD;
risen up and checked them. "Give me twen-&#xD;
ty-four hours!" he had said, and she had&#xD;
promised to give them to him. To break&#xD;
that promise was impossible, or seemed im-&#xD;
possible to her. Still she could test Leslie-&#xD;
she eould see if she were ready to meet the&#xD;
truth. That would be something gained.&#xD;
"We spoke a little while ago of marriage,"&#xD;
she said, slowly, "and-o~ love. Do you&#xD;
agree with me in thinking that if one had&#xD;
put one's whole freight of happi~ess-you&#xD;
believe in happiness, you know-upon the&#xD;
truth or falsehood of a single person, and&#xD;
that person was false instead of true, it&#xD;
would be better to know it-better to face&#xD;
any bitterness or desolation---than to live a&#xD;
life, however sweet, that was built nipon a&#xD;
lie?"&#xD;
Tli~ earnestness of her voice, the steady&#xD;
glow of her eyes, said evcn more than her&#xD;
words. A great fear suddenly seemed to&#xD;
come over Leslie. She felt as if she were&#xD;
standing on the brink of something terrible,&#xD;
of something that would shatter her whole&#xD;
fabric of existence, of something which she&#xD;
could not bear to know. For the first time&#xD;
in her life, she shrank like a coward.&#xD;
"I I cannot tell," she said. "Why&#xD;
should you say such thinrsS No one whom I&#xD;
know could possibly deceive me. But even&#xD;
if it were so "-with a pale, quivering ghost&#xD;
of a smile-" you know that where ignorance&#xD;
is bliss it is always folly to be wise."&#xD;
"I know it!" said Noruh. "Pardon me&#xD;
-it is the last thing in the world which I&#xD;
know or* desire to learn. Give me the truth&#xD;
always, at all times, and under all circum-&#xD;
stances, even if it crushes my heart and ruins&#xD;
my life! It is entirely a matter of taste,&#xD;
however. Let those live on lies who like&#xD;
them. I have no disposition to force my&#xD;
choice upon any one."&#xD;
She turned away as she spoke; but Les-&#xD;
lie, moving forward quickly, laid hcr hand on&#xD;
her arm.&#xD;
"Stop!" she said shortly, almost sternly.&#xD;
"You must tell me what you mean. I scarcely&#xD;
knew what I said, a minute ago I have no&#xD;
more desire. to live on lies than you can have.&#xD;
If-if you kmiow any thing which I ought to&#xD;
hear, for Heaven's sate tell me what it&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb  n="128-129" xml:id="VAC8066-00000075"/>&#xD;
But Norab had already said more than&#xD;
she intended, and now-bound in the fetters&#xD;
of her promise to Max-she found herself in-&#xD;
volved, greatlyto her disgust, in the absolute&#xD;
necessity for an evasion.&#xD;
"I merely put a case to you," she said.&#xD;
"Every one does not think as I do. I was&#xD;
anxious to know how you felt. I am glad&#xD;
that you are brave enough to be able to face&#xD;
the truth if it should ever be necessary for&#xD;
you to do so. None of us can tell how soon&#xD;
such a need may arise. But you must forgive&#xD;
me if I have startled you. I did not mean to&#xD;
do that.",&#xD;
"Did you not ~"said Leslie, and the faint,&#xD;
quivering smile passed over her face again.&#xD;
"Yet you spoke very much as if you meant&#xD;
to speak with a purpose. Of course it rests&#xD;
with yourself; however, to give an explana-&#xD;
tion or not."&#xD;
But, as she uttered these words, her eyes&#xD;
were less proud than her lips. They asked&#xD;
this explanation so plainly, so imploringly,&#xD;
that Norah's conscience smote her as she&#xD;
turned away. She felt that it would have been&#xD;
bard to tell the truth; yet it was still harder&#xD;
to leave it untold. She could not force her-&#xD;
self to say, "I have nothing to explain;" so,&#xD;
murmuring some half - incoherent words of&#xD;
regret, she passed from the room, conscious&#xD;
that she left behind an aching heart and a&#xD;
lost opportunity.&#xD;
This consciousness was not particularly&#xD;
conducive to amiability, as she mounted the&#xD;
stairs to her own room. She felt that every&#xD;
thing was going wrong in the most exasper-&#xD;
ating manner. Arthur, Leslie, Max, Carl-&#xD;
and Mrs. Sandford in the background-were&#xD;
so many different sources of annoyance and&#xD;
anxiety. "After all, had I not better pack&#xD;
my trunk and take the train to-night alone9"&#xD;
she thought. "This state of affairs cannot&#xD;
continue long-there is too much electricity&#xD;
in the atmosphere. Perhaps it would be well&#xD;
to escape the explosion.~~&#xD;
Full of these thoughts she passed quickly,&#xD;
and, as it chanced, almost noiselessly, across&#xD;
the matting-covered floor of the upper hall to&#xD;
her own chamber. As she opened the door,&#xD;
she paused on the threshold. Had she mis-&#xD;
taken the room? A quick glance, at the&#xD;
familiar furniture, and her own familiar be-&#xD;
longings, assured her that she had not, yet a&#xD;
graceful figure in a Nansook robe de chambre&#xD;
was standing at the toilet-table, apparently&#xD;
&#xD;
engaged in critically overlooking its miscel-&#xD;
laneous articles.&#xD;
When Mrs. Sandford retired to her own&#xD;
room after breakfast, she felt as much out&#xD;
of sorts as a very pretty widow, with a satis.&#xD;
factory-account at her banker's and a charm-&#xD;
ing wardrobe in her trunk, could possibly&#xD;
feel. Gratifying to .hcr eyes had been the&#xD;
sight of Captain Tyndale at the breakfast-&#xD;
table, and still more gratifying to her feelings&#xD;
the prospect of a demi-flirtation under the&#xD;
convenient guise of confidential disclosures&#xD;
touching the unquestionable guilt of Arthur&#xD;
and Norah. To have a summary end put to~&#xD;
this prospect, was more than she could bear&#xD;
with equanimity. Outraged by Max's de-&#xD;
parture, she found it necessary to blame some&#xD;
one besides himself. "That creature has been&#xD;
talking to him!" she thought-for it is as-&#xD;
tonishing how vexation will sharpen even dull&#xD;
wits-" she has been making out her case&#xD;
Oh, if I only could speak to him ~or a moment&#xD;
-if I could only tell him about the note last&#xD;
~night!"&#xD;
Following hard upon this thought came&#xD;
another. "If I only knew what was in that&#xD;
note! I am sure that it was an appointment!&#xD;
I am sure she went out this morning to keep&#xD;
~lt-~-but if I only knew! He could not refuse&#xD;
to believe such clear proof as that; and it&#xD;
really seems an incumbent duty to expose her&#xD;
duplicity. To think of poor, dear Leslie!&#xD;
And then, there is Max himself; if I don't&#xD;
show him beyond doubt what game she is&#xD;
playing, he may be in her train next. Men&#xD;
are such fools-and I think two strings to her&#xD;
bow are quite enough!"&#xD;
Moved by such high-minded reflections as&#xD;
these, the next step was to consider~ how to&#xD;
obtain a knowledge of what was in the note.&#xD;
Clearly there was but one way of doing this&#xD;
-from the note itself. "If I could only see&#xD;
it!" mused she. "If there was only any way&#xD;
of seeing it!" Then, impatiently, "If I could&#xD;
only think of any way of seeing it!" When&#xD;
any one has gone as far as this, it is not dif-&#xD;
ficult to go farther, it is not difficult to re-&#xD;
solve, "I will find some way of seeing it!"&#xD;
To this point Mrs Sandford soon came. She&#xD;
was not a person who was accustomed to&#xD;
think much of right or wrong, of honorable&#xD;
or dishonorable deeds. What she wished to&#xD;
do was generally her criterion for what she&#xD;
did do. She had never before wshed to in-&#xD;
terfere with any one's private correspondence,&#xD;
&#xD;
128&#xD;
&#xD;
128                 A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.                                                MRS. SANDFORD'S INQUISITIVENESS.           129&#xD;
&#xD;
129&#xD;
&#xD;
but, now that the emergency had arisen, she&#xD;
could see no just cause or reason why she&#xD;
should not find, read, and perhaps appro-&#xD;
priate, Mr. Tyndale's note, if Miss Desmond&#xD;
had been obliging enough to leave it within&#xD;
her reach.&#xD;
Of course, in order to institute such a&#xD;
search, it was necessary to enter Miss Des-&#xD;
mend's chamber, but of that Mrs. Sandford&#xD;
thought lightly. It was so easily done that&#xD;
really, as she said to herself, it seemed no&#xD;
more than crossing her own floor. She had&#xD;
only to step through one of her windows to&#xD;
the balcony upon which it opened, and to&#xD;
walk a few steps to find herself at the cor-&#xD;
respo.nding window of Norah's room. If they&#xD;
had been established in their present quarters&#xD;
with a view to possible contingencies of this&#xD;
kind, avery thing could not have been better&#xD;
arranged. To plan a campaign and to exe-&#xD;
cute it, the greatest generals have sometimes&#xD;
found to be very different things; but, in the&#xD;
present instance, there was no more difficulty&#xD;
in the execution than in the plan. This fair&#xD;
general knew that Norah had left the house&#xD;
with Carl; she fancied her safe for at least&#xD;
an hour's flirtation in the shrubbery; hence,&#xD;
she felt no hesitation in leaving her own&#xD;
room, in walking down the balcony, in open-&#xD;
ing the half- closed Venetian blinds of the&#xD;
adjoining chamber, and in boldly stepping&#xD;
within.&#xD;
Every thing was cool and fresh and in per-&#xD;
fect order The housemaid had finished her&#xD;
work and gone. None of the loose odds and&#xD;
ends, the thrown-off dresses and discarded&#xD;
ribbons, of a later hour, were lying about.&#xD;
The wardrobe had engulfed the first, the toi-&#xD;
let-table, drawers, and boxes, had, no doubt,&#xD;
received the last. Mrs. Sandford's glance&#xD;
traveled critically round the room, as she&#xD;
paused for a moment by the window. "It is&#xD;
handsomer than mine!" she thought, resent-&#xD;
fully. "What do they mean by giving it to&#xD;
her!" It made little difference in her resent-&#xD;
ment that, as a matter of fact, any one not&#xD;
accustomed to appraising furniture might&#xD;
have been puzzled to decide which was the&#xD;
most luxurious of the two apartments; those&#xD;
infantine blue eyes knew to a shilling the&#xD;
probable cost of every article on which they&#xD;
rested, and they wandered now from the&#xD;
carved bedstead in an alcove, with its tent-&#xD;
like canopy and draperies of white netting,&#xD;
over the deep chairs and couches, the swing.&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
ing mirrors, the china, and marble, and lace,&#xD;
and upholstery, which made a very pretty&#xD;
"interior." On none of these things did they&#xD;
rest, however. That distinction was reserved&#xD;
for a small table standing. near an end win-&#xD;
dow, on which a large and more substantial&#xD;
writing-desk than ladies generally use was&#xD;
placed.&#xD;
Now, confident as she was that there was&#xD;
no danger of being surprised, Mrs. Sandford&#xD;
had yet no disposition ~to waste time; and,&#xD;
crossing the floor, she at once began examin-&#xD;
ing this desk. To her infinite disappoint.&#xD;
ment and disgust, it was locked. She had&#xD;
by this time so fully entered into the spirit&#xD;
of what she was doing that, on making this&#xD;
vexatious discovery, she at once seized a pen.&#xD;
knife which lay open on the table, and, re-&#xD;
gardless of consequences, tried to force the&#xD;
lock. If it had been the toy which is usually&#xD;
placed on ladies' desks, she could easily have&#xD;
succeeded, but, for a wonder, it-was firm and&#xD;
strongand guarded its trust faithfully. After&#xD;
a minute she relinquished the attempt as&#xD;
hopeless, and threw the knife impatiently&#xD;
down. "Yet this proves that she has some-&#xD;
thing to conceal !" she said, aloud, almost&#xD;
triumphantly. "If I could only open it-if I&#xD;
only could!"&#xD;
Since the gratification of this moderate&#xD;
desire was impossible, save by recourse to&#xD;
more desperate measures than any she felt&#xD;
inclined to adopt, her next step was to look&#xD;
about the room and see if she could find any&#xD;
thing of a criminating nature which Nornh&#xD;
might have neglected to secure under lock&#xD;
and key. Here, however, she found herself&#xD;
baffled at all points. In the course of her&#xD;
life, Miss Desmond had evidently learned&#xD;
that the best of all policies is the policy of&#xD;
caution. With an extended knowledge of&#xD;
young ladies' habits, and of the nooks and&#xD;
corners into which they arc most likely to&#xD;
cram letters or notes, Mrs. Sandford found&#xD;
herself entirely at fault. A moderate num-&#xD;
ber of laces, ribbons, and frills, rewarded her&#xD;
search; but absolutely nothing of more im-&#xD;
portance. The only scrap of any thing bear-&#xD;
ing writing which she found was an envelope&#xD;
that Norah had evidently addressed to her&#xD;
sister, and then thrown aside because a blot&#xD;
of ink bad fallen upon it. This she at once&#xD;
put into her pocket. "It may serve to com-&#xD;
pare with some of her writing," she thought,&#xD;
from which it will be perceived that Mrs.&#xD;

130                  A DAUGHTER OF BOH1~ML~~.&#xD;
&#xD;
Sandford was in training for a very excellent&#xD;
detective, indeed.&#xD;
This envelope she found in a side-drawer&#xD;
of the toilet-table. There was a correspond-&#xD;
ing drawer on the other side, which she had&#xD;
not yet examined. Encouraged by her first&#xD;
measure of success-success which a less san-&#xD;
guine nature might have esteemed rery scant&#xD;
-she turned to explore this receptacle.&#xD;
Blank disappointment awaited her-blank&#xD;
disappointment, and a dozen or two long-&#xD;
legged hair-pins. It was while she was sur-&#xD;
veying these with irritation that the doot&#xD;
opened, and Norah stood on the t&#xD;
For at least a minute Mrs. Sa~dford re-&#xD;
mained in ignorance of her presence. She&#xD;
glanced over the whole toilet-table critically,&#xD;
opened the powder-box, sniffed at a bottle&#xD;
of Farina cologne, tried the effect of a mosaic&#xD;
ear-ring against her face, and finally, shrug-&#xD;
ging her shoulders with an air of disgust,&#xD;
turned away, to face the owner of the castle&#xD;
whieh she had so coolly invaded.&#xD;
~he started violently, blushed crimson,&#xD;
and for a moment was too much disconcerted&#xD;
to find any words with which to acCount for&#xD;
her presence. In truth, Norah's face ~tnd&#xD;
manner were not particularly reassuring.&#xD;
She made no attempt to conceal her indig-&#xD;
nant surprise and anger as, after a second,&#xD;
she advanced into the room, closing the door&#xD;
behind her.&#xD;
- "Ganido any thing for you?" she asked.&#xD;
"Were you looking for any thing which I&#xD;
can furnish?"&#xD;
If Mrs. Sandford had beqn in the palace&#xD;
of truth she would certainly have replied that&#xD;
she soas looking for something which Miss&#xD;
Desmond could furnish; but, as it was, she&#xD;
recovered the use of her tongue to answer&#xD;
with ready, though mther lame apology:&#xD;
"I beg a thousand pardons! I had no&#xD;
idea-I mean I thought you would not mind&#xD;
if I eame in to try the effect of your mirror.&#xD;
Mine is one of the. horrid broadening kind,&#xD;
and it makes such a fright of me that I never&#xD;
know how I look, or how my dresses sit. My&#xD;
maid complains of it all the time, so I thought&#xD;
I would just step over and try yours. I was&#xD;
anre you would not object 1"&#xD;
The last sentence was uttered. with an&#xD;
pealing look, which would have gone straight&#xD;
to the heart of any man in the world. Per-&#xD;
haps it was because Norah was not a man&#xD;
that her heart rather hardened than softened&#xD;
&#xD;
under its influence. She hal an instinct of&#xD;
the business which had brought this beguil-&#xD;
ing creature into her chamber, and she did&#xD;
not feel inclined, to deal very gently with her.&#xD;
"At the risk of seeming rude, I must say&#xD;
that I do object to my room being entered in&#xD;
my absence," she answered, even more cold.&#xD;
ly than she had spoken before. "It strikes&#xD;
me as a little singular, also, that you should&#xD;
never have thought of trying the cffe~t of my&#xD;
mirror until you knew that I was out of the&#xD;
house."&#xD;
"I am sorry that I should have thought&#xD;
of trying it at all!" said Mrs. Sandford, crim-&#xD;
soning again, partly from mortification, part-&#xD;
ly from anger. "I certainly did not expect&#xD;
such a reception as this I But of course one&#xD;
must make allowances," she added, bitterly.&#xD;
"Courtesy is not cultivated in Bohemia, I&#xD;
suppose."&#xD;
"We certainly think it of less importance&#xD;
than honesty," answered Norah, in her clear&#xD;
voice. "You may spare your taunts, Mr~.&#xD;
Sandford! You could not sting me if you&#xD;
were to try all day; and how little you could&#xD;
increase my knowledge of yourself, I may per-&#xD;
haps let you know in the simple fact that I&#xD;
am not at all surprised to find you here in&#xD;
my absence. We are both guests in this&#xD;
house, and, down-stairs, we must of necessity&#xD;
meet on neutral ground; but, in my own&#xD;
room, you are certainly well aware of the rea-&#xD;
sons why I feel no inclination to receive&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
"I am perfectly well aware of a reason&#xD;
why Imight decline to come here," said Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford, thinking that the sooner she car-&#xD;
ried the war into Africa the better. "You&#xD;
cannot help knowing, Miss Desmond, that, if&#xD;
I chose to open my lips and betray your-&#xD;
your conduct to Leslie, your hours as a guest&#xD;
in this house would be numbered."&#xD;
"If I might venture to ask you to do me&#xD;
a favor," said Norab, "it would be to open&#xD;
your lips and betray my conduct to Leslie as&#xD;
soon as possible. But, in truth, you dare not&#xD;
do this; you are not certain enough of the&#xD;
ground on which you stand; you did not&#xD;
learn enough in the library window at Straf-&#xD;
ford. Perhaps it is to a natural desire to in-&#xD;
crease your knowledge that I owe the pleas-&#xD;
ure of finding you here to-day?"&#xD;
11cr piercing eyes seconded this point-&#xD;
blank interrogation so well that, with a dis-&#xD;
comfited sense of getting the worst of this&#xD;

132                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
back to Norah's recommendation of the morn-&#xD;
ing-her assertion that if Arthur were once&#xD;
removed from Leslie's life, he (Max) might,&#xD;
by the exercise of common discretion and&#xD;
judgment, step into the vacated place. Still&#xD;
pacing back and forth, watching the shadows&#xD;
shorten toward noon, and waiting for Arthur's&#xD;
return, he let his reflections turn from the&#xD;
more vexatious view of the subject to dwell&#xD;
on that audacious proposal. "Was she in jest&#xD;
or in earnest ?" he thought-puzzled gs many&#xD;
a straightforward man has been puzzled before&#xD;
him by a woman's chameleon moods. "Did&#xD;
she take me to be a scoundrel or a lover on the&#xD;
melodramatic model, ready to profit on anoth-&#xD;
er man's dishonor? or was she only amusing&#xD;
herself by an attempt to play upon my credul-&#xD;
ity?" This question being rather difficult to&#xD;
answer by one not yersed in the abstruse study&#xD;
of feminine ethics, our chasseur shook his head&#xD;
over it. But, like moths around a candle, his&#xD;
thoughts still fluttered about the memory of&#xD;
Norah's eyes and smile. Not at all a woman&#xD;
in his style-not in the least a woman whom&#xD;
he admired--still, a woman with a charm, he&#xD;
could not but confess. A creature of infinite&#xD;
variety, energy, and resource, to whom he&#xD;
could not deny the grace of fascination, how-&#xD;
ever much he might prefer something gentler&#xD;
and more feminine. Then his thoughts re-&#xD;
ceived a new impetus of indignation in the&#xD;
recollection of how Arthur had distorted&#xD;
every feature of her character in his descrip-&#xD;
tion of it-how he had drawn its noble out-&#xD;
lines rudely, and dashed its fine tints with&#xD;
vulgar coloring. What could be said of a&#xD;
man who thus willfully added slander to de-&#xD;
ception? This was the text of Max's medi-&#xD;
tations, when suddenly a graceful figure which&#xD;
he knew well, but was not at that moment ex-&#xD;
pecting to see, mounted the terrace-steps and&#xD;
advanced toward him.&#xD;
The encounter was a surprise on both&#xD;
sides. Although Arthur had emerged from&#xD;
the large gate which shut in the stable do-&#xD;
main, and followed a path which led to the&#xD;
foot of the terrace, he had not noticed Max,&#xD;
while Max, on his part, had seen nothing of&#xD;
him. Both men, therefore, started, and in-&#xD;
voluntarily drew back a little.&#xD;
"By Jove !-~-are you here?" said Arthur,&#xD;
in no very gracious tone.&#xD;
" So you are back at last!" said Max,&#xD;
rather curt in turn.&#xD;
"Is it remarkable that I should be back?"&#xD;
&#xD;
asked the former, with a touch of defiance in&#xD;
his manner-a manner which a great many&#xD;
people, who ought to know better, assume&#xD;
when they desire to place themselves on the&#xD;
defensive.&#xD;
"Not at all remarkable," was the reply.&#xD;
"I was only surprised to see you so unex-&#xD;
pectedly."&#xD;
"I came up from the stable-I have been&#xD;
over to Wexforil," explained the other, care-&#xD;
lessly. Theii he gave a somewhat forced&#xD;
laugh. "I should rather express surprise at&#xD;
seeing ~iou I" he said. "I supposed you were&#xD;
over at Rosland-you must have gone out&#xD;
very early this morning, for you were not here&#xD;
at breakfast."&#xD;
"I was very little behind yourself in go.&#xD;
ing out," answered Max, thinking, perhaps,&#xD;
that he might save time by plunging into his&#xD;
subject at once. "The only difference was,&#xD;
that you came back to breakfast, and I did&#xD;
not."&#xD;
"Behind me!" Arthur ccho~d. Accord.&#xD;
ing to his usual fashion, he changed color&#xD;
vividly-this time more from anger than con-&#xD;
fusion. "I was not aware," he said, haughti-&#xD;
ly, "that my goings - out or comings - in con-&#xD;
cerned you in the least."&#xD;
"You are quite right," returned Max, de-&#xD;
liberately. "They do not concern me in the&#xD;
least-except in so far as they concern a mat-&#xD;
ter in wliieh you have more than once CXCiI-&#xD;
citly requested my interference."&#xD;
"If I was fool enough to request your in-&#xD;
terference at one time," said Arthur, angrily,&#xD;
"understand that I quite as explicitly request&#xD;
your non-interference now! Whatever I may&#xD;
choose to do, or leave undone, is none of&#xD;
your affair."&#xD;
"You are mistaken about that," said Max.&#xD;
lIe did not lose control over himself, though&#xD;
the manner of the other did not incline him&#xD;
to adopt any great degree of conciliation.&#xD;
"What you are proposing to do or to leave&#xD;
undone may be more my affair than you im-&#xD;
agine.~~&#xD;
"Indeed!" said Arthur, with an angry&#xD;
sneer, which was not a striking success as a&#xD;
sneer. In truth, angry men should never at-&#xD;
tempt to employ this potent weapon of of-&#xD;
fense, for, in order to be effective, a sneer&#xD;
should always be passionless. perhaps Ar-&#xD;
thur felt this, or perhaps there was something&#xD;
in the keen dark eyes regarding him which&#xD;
made him change his tone. "At all events, he&#xD;
&#xD;
132&#xD;
&#xD;
AN ANGRY INTERVIEW.                133&#xD;
&#xD;
did change it. Don't be a fool, Max!" he&#xD;
said, impatiently. "You know, as well as I&#xD;
do, that this is nonsense-more than non-&#xD;
sense, indeed, if I chose to resent it! I was&#xD;
absurd enough to give you some excuse for&#xD;
your interference, and so I shall let it pass.&#xD;
But I insist upon your dropping the subject&#xD;
at once and finally!"&#xD;
"Suppose I decliuc to do so?"&#xD;
"Then I shall decline to listen to you. I&#xD;
have had enough - more than enough~- of&#xD;
this!"&#xD;
"I scarcely think you will decline to lis-&#xD;
ten to me when you hear that I come from&#xD;
Miss Desmond."&#xD;
"And, pray, why should I not decline to&#xD;
listen to you even then? What is Norah Des.&#xD;
mond to me that I should give any more at-&#xD;
tention to her messenger than to herself?"&#xD;
'1What was she this morning when you&#xD;
asked her to elope with you?"&#xD;
"So!" said Arthur, drawing in his breath&#xD;
with a sharp, quick sound. "You have heard&#xD;
that, have you?" Then, with a short, harsh&#xD;
laugh: "You were fool enough to believe it,&#xD;
were you? How completely she must have&#xD;
drawn you into her net! Bat I should have&#xD;
thought even you knew Norah Desmond bet-&#xD;
ter than that!"&#xD;
"Do you deny it?" demanded Max. There&#xD;
was a tense chord in his voice which the other&#xD;
scarcely understood. Something like a slight&#xD;
quiver passed over him. As yet he held his&#xD;
indignant passion well in leash; but, if the&#xD;
denial came-&#xD;
It did not come. Even Arthur Tyndale&#xD;
shrank from such downright perjury. Not so&#xD;
much because it was a perjury, as because he&#xD;
had a wholesome fear of Norah. It was one&#xD;
thing to insinuate that she had spoken false-&#xD;
ly, another thing openly to declare it. His&#xD;
courage, which was quite equal to the first&#xD;
achievement, failed a little at the last. He&#xD;
turned in wrathful impatience upon his cousin.&#xD;
"I shall say nothing about it, one way or&#xD;
auo'ther!" he cried. "Again, I repeat that&#xD;
it is no affair of yours. Why the devil do&#xD;
you insist upon interfering like this?"&#xD;
"Because I mean to know definitely what&#xD;
you intend to do !"the other answered, stern-&#xD;
ly. "It is too late to take this tone with me.&#xD;
You invited my interference in the first in-&#xD;
stance; there are others who have as good a&#xD;
right as yourself to do so, who have invited&#xD;
it, in the second."&#xD;
&#xD;
133&#xD;
&#xD;
"I suppose you mean Norah Desmond?"&#xD;
said Arthur, with the bitter inI~ction of con-&#xD;
tempt which invariably accompanied his ut-&#xD;
terance of her name. "But, by Heaven! there&#xD;
is no interference which I will not tolerate&#xD;
sooner than kers!"&#xD;
"I see that you have lost all sense of&#xD;
reason for the present," said Max, curtly.&#xD;
"It will be useless to attempt to talk to you&#xD;
unless you can listen in a different spirit from&#xD;
any yen have displayed as yet. I shall walk&#xD;
to the end of the terrace," he added. "If&#xD;
you are gone when I come back, or, if you&#xD;
still refuse to listen to me, then Ishall go,&#xD;
and your last chance of obtaining any con-&#xD;
sideration at Miss Desmond's hands will be&#xD;
over."&#xD;
As l~e uttered these words, he turned away&#xD;
without~ giving the other time to speak, and&#xD;
walked slowly around the terrace. When he&#xD;
gained the end, he paused and stood still for&#xD;
a few minutes. rrobably he felt that he, as&#xD;
well as Arthur, needed this little breathing-&#xD;
space. It was the thought of Leslie which&#xD;
had made him exercise so much self-control,&#xD;
and now he was conscious of a necessity to&#xD;
gird himself up, as it were, with that thought&#xD;
afresh - with the memory of her tenderness,&#xD;
her sweetness, her grace, her devoted love for&#xD;
the man behind him, her (he thought) entire&#xD;
unsuspiciousness. If it seemed hard that she&#xD;
should never know of what poor clay her idol&#xD;
was made, that, as Norah had said, she should&#xD;
"go through life holding a lie for truth,'&#xD;
still Max was enough a man of the world to&#xD;
know that she was not singular, either among&#xD;
men or women, in that fate. If it is true in&#xD;
countless instances, that-&#xD;
"We loved ourlost loves forth love wegave them,&#xD;
And not for any thing they gave our love,"&#xD;
it is still more true that there could be no&#xD;
sadder revelation on this sad earth of ours&#xD;
than the revelation of the wandering of those&#xD;
hearts which we have fancied truest, tender-&#xD;
est, most our own. This pang Max was de-&#xD;
termined should be spared Leslie. "It is&#xD;
not as if she could make another life for her-&#xD;
self! "he muttered. "It is not as if she had&#xD;
the facile power of forgetting of an ordinary&#xD;
woman; or her sister's pride and courage. It&#xD;
would be a shock which might darken her&#xD;
whole life. Arthur's impressions are so&#xD;
evanescent that, when Miss Desmond goes&#xD;
away, he will most likely return to his alle.&#xD;

glance, and be all that he was before. Not&#xD;
worthy of l~er-never, under any circum-&#xD;
stanOes worthy of her-but one of the neces-&#xD;
sary compromiseS of which life is full!"&#xD;
* Braced by this cheerful view of things,&#xD;
Captain Tyndale turned at last to retrace his&#xD;
steps. The terrace-walk ctwved so that he&#xD;
could not see the spot where he had left Ar-&#xD;
thur, and his mind was naturally full of un-&#xD;
cei-tainty concerning that unmanageable per-&#xD;
eon. Would he still be there? Had he defi-&#xD;
nitely taken leave of his senses, or was it&#xD;
only a temporary aberration which might be&#xD;
over, in a measure, at least, by this time? In&#xD;
aflOth~r second he would turn the corner of&#xD;
the house, and the question would be an-&#xD;
swered. As he turned it, a quick, blank feel-&#xD;
ing of disappointment settled over him in-&#xD;
etantly. ~" He has gone," he thought. The&#xD;
next moment showed him that he was mis-&#xD;
taken. Arthur was pacing up and down the&#xD;
path which he had himself followed an hour&#xD;
before.&#xD;
Seeing his approach, the young man paused&#xD;
abruptly. His handsome face was paler and&#xD;
firmer than Max had ever seen it before; his&#xD;
violet eyes had a steady, angry lustre in&#xD;
them. Plainly, If cooler thoughts had come&#xD;
to him, milder ones had not.&#xD;
"Well," he said, before the other could&#xD;
speak, "you see I have waited for you. But&#xD;
it has not been to listen to any thing which&#xD;
you may have to say either in your own char-&#xD;
acter or in that of envoy. It has only been&#xD;
that I may request an explanation of your&#xD;
extraordinary conduct-that I may learn how&#xD;
it' is that you think yourself at liberty to&#xD;
treat me in such a manner as this?"&#xD;
"I did not come here to discuss my own&#xD;
conduct," answered Max. "Think what you&#xD;
like of it! Just now I am occupied with&#xD;
yours. Just now I must repeat the question&#xD;
which I have already asked: What do you&#xD;
mean to do with regard to your engagement?"&#xD;
"' And I repeat what Ihave already asked:&#xD;
How does any thing connected with it con-&#xD;
cern you 1'"&#xD;
"Granting that it does not concern me at&#xD;
all, you certainly cannot deny that it con-&#xD;
cerns Miss Desmoud. You msjr consider me&#xD;
as her envoy, if you prefer to look on me in&#xD;
that light."&#xD;
"Her dupe and tool, more likely!" was&#xD;
the bitter response. "But 'uhy should .she&#xD;
make such an inquiry?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Simply because it is necessary with ref-&#xD;
erence to her own conduct," answered Max,&#xD;
who was beginning to lose patience. "Are&#xD;
you aware that you may do yourself infinite&#xD;
harm by this obstinacy?" he asked. "Un-&#xD;
less you desire to break your engagement,&#xD;
Miss Desmond, on her part, is willing to leave&#xD;
the truth untold, if you will pledge yourself&#xD;
to keep faith with her sister."&#xD;
"Miss Desmond is infinitely generous!"&#xD;
"She is certainly more generous than&#xD;
many women would be!" said Max, with&#xD;
growing sternness. "If you reject her offer,&#xD;
however," he added, turning away, "my in-&#xD;
terference is at an end. I have the honor to&#xD;
bid you good-morning!"&#xD;
"Stop!" said Arthur, quickly. "Don't&#xD;
go like this! Are you in earnest ?-does No-&#xD;
nih offer to bind herself to-to tell her sister&#xD;
nothing?"&#xD;
"I think I may safely say that she offers&#xD;
even that, in case ymne bind yourself in turn&#xD;
to keep faith with Miss Grahame, and to suf-&#xD;
fer her to suspect nothing."&#xD;
"By Jove!" said Arthur. For a minute&#xD;
he looked quite astounded. It seemed No.&#xD;
rah's special province to go through life as-&#xD;
tonishing people. "I did not expect this,"&#xD;
he said, slowly. "I thought it was all over&#xD;
this morning. She left me like a tigress, and&#xD;
I was sure she had told Leslie every thing&#xD;
before the present time. I was so confident&#xD;
of it that I have made my arrangements to&#xD;
leave!" he added, shrugging his shoulders.&#xD;
"It would be too hot for me here after things&#xD;
came out. My ticket is in my pocket. I&#xD;
meant to go up to Alton to-night, and-and&#xD;
anywhere else that I felt inclined afterward.&#xD;
It wouWl have been rather a relief' to-be rid&#xD;
of the whole infernal business!" he said,&#xD;
with a tone of genuine regret in his voice.&#xD;
"But, if it is to go on, of course this arrange-&#xD;
ment will be best. Only you must under-&#xD;
stand one thing: I shall not trust Norah&#xD;
Desmond's pledge or promise, either given or&#xD;
sent. I must have proof that she does 'not&#xD;
mean to play me false at last."&#xD;
"What kind'of proof?"&#xD;
"My letters-the letters of which I have&#xD;
spoken before. Let her return those, and I&#xD;
will know she is in earnest."&#xD;
"I do not think it likely that she will ac-&#xD;
cede to such a request," said Max. "But I&#xD;
will lay it before her. One thing, however, I&#xD;
know that I am safe in demanding on her part&#xD;
&#xD;
ARTHUR'S FINAL DECISION.&#xD;
&#xD;
-the return of her letters, if you still have&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"Her letters!" repeated Arthur. "Good&#xD;
heavens! do you take me for a woman or a&#xD;
fool, that I should be treasuring up such rel-&#xD;
ies? I have not, to my knowledge, a shred&#xD;
of one of them, else she should certainly have&#xD;
it. God knows I want to keep no recollection&#xD;
of' her, or the part she has played in my life!"&#xD;
he added, with sudden, bitter passion.&#xD;
And, little as Max was inclined to trust&#xD;
him, he saw that he was speaking truth, and&#xD;
he kaew, moreover, that it is the rarest thing&#xD;
in the world when a man does keep such&#xD;
tokens of the past. It is women, preiimi-&#xD;
nently, who love to make packets of old let-&#xD;
ters, over which they weep and sigh, or smile&#xD;
and laugh. Men's lives are too busy, and, as&#xD;
a rule, too practical, for such tender, foolish&#xD;
acts 6f remembrance.&#xD;
"And if Miss Desmond refuses-as, in my&#xD;
opinion, she is very likely to refuse-to re-&#xD;
turn your letters," said Max, "what then?"&#xD;
The other drew the railroad - ticket of&#xD;
which he had spoken trom his pocket and&#xD;
held it up. "This is what then!" he&#xD;
said.&#xD;
Max made one quick step forward-then&#xD;
checked himself and fell back. After all,&#xD;
violence would serve no good purpose. But&#xD;
it was almost a minute before he could com-&#xD;
mand his voice sufficiently to speak.&#xD;
"Do you mean it?" he asked, hoarsely.&#xD;
"Do you mean that you will dare to leave&#xD;
Miss Grahame like that!"&#xD;
"I mean," answered Arthur, "that I will&#xD;
not trust Norah Desmond! If she refuses to&#xD;
return my letters, I shall know that' she has&#xD;
a trap laid for me, and I am not quite fool&#xD;
enough to walk into it with my eyes open.&#xD;
You may tell her that if you like. I will not&#xD;
live such a life as I have been leading lately!&#xD;
It is infamous !-it is too much to expect of&#xD;
any man! If she refuses to return my let-&#xD;
ters, I shall leave the country, and she may&#xD;
take the burden of explanation on her own&#xD;
shoulders! It is all he~- fault from beginning&#xD;
to end! It was a cursed day for me when I&#xD;
first saw her face!"&#xD;
"This is your ultimatum, then," said&#xD;
Max, feeling that he must get away-that he&#xD;
would not be able to restrain himself many&#xD;
minutes longer. "You make the return of&#xD;
your letters an absolute condition for keep-&#xD;
ing faith with Miss Grahame?"&#xD;
&#xD;
185&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, an absolute condition!" said the&#xD;
other, emphatically..&#xD;
With this understanding they parted.&#xD;
As Max went across the park to Rosland, be&#xD;
could not restrain the indignation which pos-&#xD;
sessed him; and yet even indignation was&#xD;
subordinated by uneasiness. "Is it doing&#xD;
well? is it a thing which can be excused un-&#xD;
der any circumstances, to put Leslie's hap~&#xD;
pines into such keeping? " he asked him.&#xD;
self. "Is one so false likely to be more&#xD;
constant or more honorable in the future&#xD;
than in the past?" There was only one an-&#xD;
swer to such a question as this-leslie had&#xD;
put her own happiness into his hands. No&#xD;
outside person had been to blame for that.&#xD;
The sole point to be considered now was&#xD;
whether to leave her in happy ignorance, or&#xD;
to wake her to bitter knowledge; and this&#xD;
point, as we are aware, Max had long before&#xD;
decided. He shook his head many times,&#xD;
however, as he strolled slowly along through&#xD;
the woods and across the fields. He began&#xD;
to realize that it was a dangerous business-.&#xD;
this interfering, even with the best intentions,&#xD;
to make or mar the happiness of others' lives.&#xD;
When he reached Rosland they were at&#xD;
luncheon, and his entrance created a slight&#xD;
Stir of interest in what was else a very lan-&#xD;
guid company. "We did not expect you&#xD;
back so soon !" said Mrs. Sandford, wit!, a&#xD;
subdued flutter, as he sat down by her. She&#xD;
felt, no doubt, that it was on her account he&#xD;
had returned. His heart, or his conscience,&#xD;
or both together most likely, had smitten&#xD;
him after his return to Strafford, and he had&#xD;
come to seek pardon in the depths of her be-&#xD;
guiling eyes. Those eyes looked at him with&#xD;
the faintest shade of reproach imaginable&#xD;
gleaming through their gratification.&#xD;
"You don't deserve to be spoken to!"&#xD;
she confided to him. "Why did you go&#xD;
away this morning and leave me to be so&#xD;
frightfully dull? It was very, very unkind&#xD;
of you!"&#xD;
"I really cannot flatter myself that I&#xD;
should have had any power to keep the dull-&#xD;
ness at bay," he answered, impatient of her-&#xD;
self and her eyes, yet seeing no means of&#xD;
escape. A glance round the table showed&#xD;
him that everybody was dull and somewhat&#xD;
silent, as people are apt to be in the midat&#xD;
of "one of the warmest days of the season."&#xD;
Carl was the only exception to this rule.&#xD;
He looked restless instead of dull, and Max&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="136-137" xml:id="VAC8066-00000080"/>&#xD;
136                 '    A 'DAUGHTER&#xD;
encountered more than one glance expressive&#xD;
of any thing but amiability leveled at him-&#xD;
self Jy the brown eyes out of which all laugh-&#xD;
ter seemed, to have died. "Something un.-&#xD;
common is the matter with that fellow!" hie&#xD;
thought, as he seasoned his chicken plen-&#xD;
tifully with Worcestershire sauce, and an-&#xD;
swered Mrs. Sandford's remarks with dis-&#xD;
couraging brevity. Carl, meanwhile, was&#xD;
debating gloomily in his mind whether " that&#xD;
fellow " was in love with Norah himself, or&#xD;
was merely acting as the envoy of his cousin,.&#xD;
The' suggestion that any thing but Norah&#xD;
could have brought him to Rosland, would&#xD;
have been scouted contemptuolisly by this&#xD;
infatuated young man. " He who is giddy&#xD;
thinks the world turns round," and Carl was&#xD;
very giddy indeed at this time. Indeed, he&#xD;
was half mad with love and hopelessness and&#xD;
jealousy, and no more accountable for his&#xD;
thoughts or actions than a lunatic in a strait-&#xD;
jacket.&#xD;
It is a good thing that there is no Asmo-&#xD;
deus to lift the roofs from off our heads, or&#xD;
to open the doors of our hearts and, show&#xD;
what thoughts and feelings possess us. If&#xD;
there had been such an, inconvenient sprite,&#xD;
he might have revealed the fact that it was&#xD;
a very uncomfortable party who talked com-&#xD;
monplaces about the heat; and the coming&#xD;
guests of the evening. Of them all, Norah&#xD;
took things most philosophically. "When&#xD;
the worst comes, I shall simply pack my&#xD;
trunk and leave!" she thought. This reso-&#xD;
hition was possible to her, who had no keen-&#xD;
ly personal share in the annoyances-she was&#xD;
not tortured by doubt, or stung with pain, as&#xD;
some of the others were, Next to Norab,&#xD;
Mr. Middleton took things moat placidly.&#xD;
He was emphatically of the opinion that the&#xD;
whole business (Carl's infatuation, Norah's&#xD;
visit, and Leslie's engagement understood)&#xD;
was a confounded nuisance-it 'may even be&#xD;
that he characterized it still more strongly-&#xD;
but a man cannot excite himself with impu-&#xD;
nity when tbe thermometer is at eighty-five&#xD;
degrees, and Mr. Middleton dismissed his&#xD;
share of anxiety until cooler weather.&#xD;
When they were leaving table, Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford said, in a whisper, to Max: "I must&#xD;
speak to you as soon as possible, and alone.&#xD;
I have something of the utmost importance to&#xD;
tell you. Can you make an opportunity, or&#xD;
shall I? "&#xD;
"I-oh-I'll do it!" answered he, cast&#xD;
&#xD;
OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
down to the very earth by this bold assault.&#xD;
Where was any hope of rescue or escape ? If&#xD;
he allowed himself to he entrapped into a&#xD;
private spot to receive Mrs. Sandford's over-&#xD;
flowing confidence, where would it end ?-&#xD;
when should he be able to see Norah ? Just&#xD;
then he could have echoed most heartily Mr.&#xD;
Weller's well-known sentiments with regard&#xD;
to widows. He felt desperate-and a desper-&#xD;
ate idea entered his mind. "I'll make an op-&#xD;
portunity as soon as possible," lie said. Af-&#xD;
ter this, he hurried away in search of Norah.&#xD;
Instead of Norah, it was Leslie whom he&#xD;
found in the sitting-room, where he had spent&#xD;
so many pleasant hours. It looked as pretty&#xD;
as ever, though he felt instinctively that the&#xD;
charm of repose, which had chiefly made it so&#xD;
delightful, had vanished. The same green still-&#xD;
ness brooded behind the half-closed blinds ;&#xD;
the table was covered with work and hooks-&#xD;
new magazines and novels principally ; the&#xD;
fragrance of roses was heavy ow the air;&#xD;
every thing was outwardly the sgme that it&#xD;
had been ten days before ; but the unseen stir&#xD;
and strife of passion had changed the place-.&#xD;
The air, which before was full of peace and&#xD;
serenity, now seemed full of fears,. doubts,&#xD;
suspicions-Max wondered if it was only his&#xD;
imagination which fancied this-.&#xD;
Leslie was standing by the centre-table,&#xD;
in the middle of the room, when he came in.&#xD;
He thought how pretty she looked, her slen-&#xD;
der figure "gowned in pure white," her grace-.&#xD;
ful brown head drooping like that of a classic&#xD;
statue! But there was something pathetic,&#xD;
as well as classic, in this drooping head, and&#xD;
she seemed fingering, half absently, the flow-&#xD;
ers which filled a large vase in the centre of&#xD;
the table.&#xD;
"See!" she said, turning with a smile-&#xD;
faint, and evidently forced-when Max came&#xD;
in. "Our poor roses !-the heat is too much&#xD;
for them. These are all that the garden af-&#xD;
fords, and see how imperfect they are-really&#xD;
scarce worth gathering!"&#xD;
"Very different from those you showed&#xD;
me in May," said he, coming and standing by&#xD;
her. "Do you remember that evening in Al-&#xD;
ton ?-How lovely the roses were ! and how&#xD;
you laughed at me for not knowing more of&#xD;
their nomenclature !"&#xD;
"I remember," she said. " You mean the&#xD;
evening that Mrs. Sandford came in, and-&#xD;
and Arthur was there ? Yes, they were love-,&#xD;
ly- every thing was lovely- that evening'.&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
But we cannot have the roses of May in&#xD;
July." '&#xD;
" No," said he, looking at her face, out of&#xD;
which its delicate roses had fled. " You are&#xD;
not well," he added, abruptly. "I-I am&#xD;
afraid you may be worrying about something."&#xD;
" Why should you think that ?" asked she,&#xD;
looking at him with a quick keenness in her&#xD;
soft gray eyes. "I am perfectly well, and-&#xD;
what should I worry about ? "&#xD;
"Women find a thousand things to worry&#xD;
about, of which a man knows nothing," an-&#xD;
swered he. "I thought perhaps you might&#xD;
have fancied, imagined something-you are&#xD;
not looking well!" he repeated, positively.&#xD;
At that moment he felt a strong and very un-&#xD;
gallant inclination to choke Mrs. Sandford.&#xD;
" Had her tongue done this mischief ?"&#xD;
" I was never a person to fancy or imagine&#xD;
things," said Leslie, lifting her lily-like neck&#xD;
prog1dly. " I have always had a great con-&#xD;
tempt for people of that kind. They not only&#xD;
make their own misery, but the misery of all&#xD;
around them. They are mean, and suspicious,&#xD;
and-and jealous at last, perhaps ! I would&#xD;
die sooner than give way to such .en inclina-&#xD;
tion !" cried she, with a sudden pang-a rush&#xD;
of unshed tears-in her voice, 'which told her&#xD;
listener the whole story of her struggle.&#xD;
And what could that listener say ? Neither&#xD;
reassurance nor comfort was his to give.&#xD;
Besides, what right had he to offer it to&#xD;
Arthur Tyndale's future wife ? His heart was&#xD;
touched as it might have been by the bravely-&#xD;
borne suffering of a child. But Leslie Gra-&#xD;
hame was no child. She was a woman whom&#xD;
he might once have loved, who iight have&#xD;
made his life as different as he would certain-&#xD;
ly have made hers, if the caprice of Fate had&#xD;
not decided otherwise. Now there was no&#xD;
thought of love in his heart-nly pity-akin&#xD;
to tenderness, as he watched the quick flush&#xD;
of pain coming and going in her pale cheeks.&#xD;
" I ,told you once-on that evening of&#xD;
which we were speaking a minute ago," he&#xD;
said, " that, even if one crushed a lily, its I&#xD;
fragrance would remain. If you were crushed&#xD;
by the worst trquble in the world, I am sure l&#xD;
you would still be yourself, and therefore in-&#xD;
capable of an ungenerous thought. But why I&#xD;
should you think of such things ? There is&#xD;
no need for you to do so." '&#xD;
"Is there no need for me to do so ?" asked 1&#xD;
she, turning suddenly and facing him with a&#xD;
breathless look in her eyes. "On your hionor,t&#xD;
&#xD;
Captain Tyndale, do yiou know of no need for&#xD;
me to do so? "&#xD;
On his honor ! What could Max say ?&#xD;
Some men have an idea that they can better&#xD;
tell a lie on any thing else than on their&#xD;
"honor." Others, as we are aware, hold that&#xD;
abstraction very lightly indeed. Max was&#xD;
one of theformer class. He hesitated, flushed,&#xD;
looked uncomfortable and awkward, when&#xD;
called upon to perjure himself. Leslie turned&#xD;
away with a little dreary laugh-in which&#xD;
there was a heart-sick sound, if he had been&#xD;
quick enough to catch it.&#xD;
"How foolish I am!", shc said. "How&#xD;
should you know any thing about it ? See&#xD;
what nonsense you have led me into talking&#xD;
Where is Norah, I wonder ? Do you know ?&#xD;
And Mrs. Sandford seems to have vanished,&#xD;
too."&#xD;
" You must not misunderstand my si-&#xD;
lence," he began; but she interrupted him&#xD;
quickly:&#xD;
" Have I not told you that I am the last&#xD;
person in the world to' misunderstand any&#xD;
thing ? Tell me whom you would like to take&#xD;
in to dinner, this evening, and I will try to&#xD;
see that you are gratified. Mrs. Sandford ?"&#xD;
-"Good Heavcns, no!" he answered, in&#xD;
genuine dismay; but, before he could say any&#xD;
thing further to avert such a fate, Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford herself appeared in the open door.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
" How often one dead joy appears&#xD;
And, let us own, the sharpetertpe&#xD;
Which human patience may endure&#xD;
Pays light for that which leaves the beart&#xD;
More generous, dignified, and pure."&#xD;
SHE was armed and equipped for conquest.&#xD;
Mfax saw that in a moment, with a sinking of&#xD;
the heart impossible to describe. He was&#xD;
rather hlind to the details and intricacies of&#xD;
feminine costume as a general rule, but a&#xD;
sense of danger sharpens the eyes wonderful-&#xD;
y, and he perceived at a glance that the brief&#xD;
time which Mrs. Sandford had spent up-stairs&#xD;
had sufficed for several important changes of&#xD;
toilet. He was not sufficiently learned in the&#xD;
names of different articles of dress to have&#xD;
been able to specify that she had donned a&#xD;
different polonaise, and added a butterfly-how&#xD;
o the already elaborate arrangement of her&#xD;
&#xD;
LESLIE. AND CAPTAIN TYNDALE.&#xD;

138               A DAUGHTER OF BOHE~IIA.                      I&#xD;
&#xD;
hair; but he recognized the fact of some&#xD;
change-and he knew what it meant I&#xD;
"I thought you had retired for your&#xD;
siesta," said Lesli~, turning round from the&#xD;
roses; and then eke saw the change of toilet,&#xD;
and knew, also, what it meant.&#xD;
"I think this is the coolest room in the&#xD;
house," said the pretty widow, with a con-&#xD;
scious air. "Mine is really intolerable just&#xD;
now, though it is so pleasant usually. I&#xD;
think warm weather is apt to make one rest.&#xD;
less. Don't you think so, Captain Tyndale?&#xD;
It must have made ziou restless "-with a&#xD;
little playful arch of the eyebrows-" else&#xD;
yen would not have undertaken so many&#xD;
Walks through the sun to-day."&#xD;
"Might not something besides restless.&#xD;
~iess account for that?" asked Max. lie&#xD;
was tired to death of the woman-of her af.&#xD;
fectations, and mannerisms, and great wide-&#xD;
open blue eyes; but it is not exactly com-&#xD;
patible with civility in general, nor with the&#xD;
chivalry due to the fair sex in particular, to&#xD;
turn a deaf ear to l~emarks which were spe.&#xD;
cially addressed to him, backed by the eyes&#xD;
aroresaid, and a new French muslin polonaise&#xD;
of the latest and most becoming fashion.&#xD;
"It is not restlessness which draws the&#xD;
~ieedle to the magnet," said Leslie, smiling,&#xD;
For she knew what Mrs. Sandford thought.&#xD;
"Then, if Captain Tyndale is the needle,&#xD;
somebody else must be the magnet," said&#xD;
that lady.-" Who is it, Captain Tyndale?&#xD;
We insist upon your telling us who it&#xD;
is-&#xD;
"Do you?" said Captain Tyndale. "But,&#xD;
unless you have thumb-scr~ws at hand, I am&#xD;
afraid there is no chance of your wringing a&#xD;
confession from me."&#xD;
In this, species of nonsense several min-&#xD;
utes passed. Max began to feel more and&#xD;
more desperate. Where was Norah? He&#xD;
saw Leslie glance at the clock; he knew that&#xD;
before long she would apologize, retire for&#xD;
her 8~eeta, and leave him to his fate-the hor-&#xD;
rible fate of spending tWo or three hours of a&#xD;
broiling afternoon shut up in a flower-scented&#xD;
room with Mrs. Sandford. If he could only&#xD;
see or hear any thing of Norahl He begali&#xD;
to grow impatient, as well as desperate. She&#xD;
knew-she must have known-that he had&#xD;
come over to Rosland to see her, and yet she&#xD;
had coolly taken herself out of his way.&#xD;
"She might have spared me half an hour&#xD;
from her beauty-sleep; or from her flirtation&#xD;
&#xD;
with Middleton!" he thought. "It was not&#xD;
for myself that I wanted to see her!"&#xD;
Feeling injured and indignant, he began&#xD;
to meditate how he could best make his es-&#xD;
cape, when the sudden tramp of a horse's&#xD;
feet on a carriage-drive beyond the veranda&#xD;
made them all start. "Is any one coming?"&#xD;
asked Leslie, in that tone of horror-stricken&#xD;
deprecation which the approach of a visitor&#xD;
so often calls forth. She opened the blind&#xD;
cautiously and looked out. "No; it is only&#xD;
Carl!" she said, with a sigh of relief "What&#xD;
a strange time of day to be going any-&#xD;
where I"&#xD;
"lie is a strange kind of person," said&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford, languidly. There was no-&#xD;
body she felt less interest in than Carl, for&#xD;
the very good and sufficient reason that he&#xD;
had not paid her the compliment of evincing&#xD;
the lcastinterest in her.&#xD;
"An untimely fancy for exercise seems&#xD;
to have seized more than one member of your&#xD;
household," said Max, starting up, and walk-&#xD;
ing to another window a window which,&#xD;
being on the shady side of the room, stood&#xD;
partly open, and commanded a view of the&#xD;
grounds beyond. "Is not that Miss Des-&#xD;
moud yonder?"&#xD;
"Upon my word, I believe it is!" said&#xD;
Leslie, aghast. "Is she trying to get a sun-&#xD;
stroke or a fever, do you suppose, that she&#xD;
has gone to walk at such an hour?"&#xD;
"Perhaps she has an engagement to meet&#xD;
Mr. Middleton somewhere," said Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford, putting up her eye-glass, and scrutiniz-&#xD;
ing the graceful figure which at that moment&#xD;
was thrown into vivid relief by a deep-green&#xD;
hedge. "Miss Desinond has a fancy for that&#xD;
kind of thing, I believe. It gives a spice of&#xD;
-of what you might call Bohemianism to&#xD;
her intercourse with gentlemen."&#xD;
"I think you are mistaken," said Leslie,&#xD;
quickly. "There are many people who have&#xD;
never lived in Bohemia, who are much more&#xD;
fond of that sort of thing, as you call it, thaii&#xD;
Norah is; and," added the loyal advocate,&#xD;
proudly, "her society is sufficiently attractive&#xD;
in itself to dispense with any spice offastness."&#xD;
"My dear," said Mrs. Sandford, with efl~u~&#xD;
sion, "you must really excuse me.l I am&#xD;
sure I' meant no harm, but my tongue is so&#xD;
heedless, and you certainly are the kindest&#xD;
and most generous person in the world to&#xD;
talkac!"&#xD;
"I really do not see what my appreciation&#xD;

A KINDLY WARNING.&#xD;
&#xD;
139&#xD;
&#xD;
of Norali has to do with kindness and gener-&#xD;
osity," answered Leslie, still haughtily in&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
"Nobody can appreciate her more than I&#xD;
do!" said Mrs. Sandford-which; in a certain&#xD;
way, was quite true "~obody can deny&#xD;
that she is very beautiful and very attract-&#xD;
Good Heavens I Captain Tyndale, what are&#xD;
you going to do?" she cried, breaking off&#xD;
with a sudden exclamation of alarm.&#xD;
"I don't think Miss Desmond ought to be&#xD;
allowed to take a sunstroke or a fever with-&#xD;
out a warning," answered Max, who had&#xD;
swung himself over the low sill of the open&#xD;
window to the ground outside. "I am going&#xD;
to warn her, therefore. If she does not&#xD;
choose to listen to mc, my conscience will be&#xD;
clear at least'&#xD;
lie stepped ruthlessly across a flower-bed&#xD;
which made a mass of bloom in front of the&#xD;
window, and walked quickly away in the&#xD;
direction Norah had taken-so quickly that&#xD;
a looker-on might have been pardoned for'&#xD;
thinking that he was afraid of being called&#xD;
back.&#xD;
But Mrs. Sandford was speechless. She&#xD;
gazed after him with crinison cheeks and&#xD;
angry eyes; but she had sense enough to say&#xD;
nothi~ig. Leslie, who felt sorry for her, was&#xD;
the first to speak.&#xD;
"Captain Tyndale Will be back in a few&#xD;
minutes, no doubt. He cannot mean to go&#xD;
far-in this sun!"&#xD;
"If he comes back instantly, lie will not&#xD;
find me," answered Mrs. Sandford, in a voice&#xD;
that quivered-~--with anger, not with tears.&#xD;
She rose as she spoke. Leslie could not&#xD;
help thinking how pretty she looked. Ex-&#xD;
citement had, as it were, torn oft' her habitual&#xD;
veil of affectation; the real woman was in&#xD;
arms against the slight which had been&#xD;
passed upon herself and her elaborate toilet.&#xD;
Her cheeks were like carnations, her eyes&#xD;
flashed ire~ It was a tempest in a teapot,&#xD;
but even tempests in teapots may sometimes&#xD;
work mischief. At that moment it was a&#xD;
gratifying thought that she could, at least,&#xD;
break her promise to Max, and in that way&#xD;
cause him a little annoyance.&#xD;
"If Miss Desmond even walks across the&#xD;
lawn,, other women must, of course, expect&#xD;
to be forsaken immediately!" she said, with&#xD;
that faint, scornful laugh which is significant&#xD;
of any thing in the world but amusement.&#xD;
"For a young lady who keeps so many&#xD;
&#xD;
strings to her bow, she manages them all&#xD;
with a great deal of skill!"&#xD;
"It was not Norah's fault that Captain&#xD;
Tyndale went after her," said Leslie. "Par-&#xD;
don mc, Mrs. Sandford, but you must really&#xD;
understand that I cannot listen-"&#xD;
"It is not my affair, of course," said Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford, interrupting her, but without any&#xD;
of the honeyed apology of a little while be-&#xD;
fore in her words or voice. "Miss Des-&#xD;
mond's admirers, or lovers, or whatever they&#xD;
may he, do not concern me. It would be&#xD;
well, perhaps, if everybody could say the&#xD;
same thing; but when a woman has that&#xD;
insatiable love of admiration, there is no tell-&#xD;
ing wAere it will stop!"&#xD;
"Is it Norah whom you mean has an in-&#xD;
satiable love of admiration?" asked Leslie,&#xD;
dully csnscious'that it was even itt this wom-&#xD;
an's powei~ te add to her pain. "I have not.:&#xD;
observed it."&#xD;
"My dear," said the other, soleznsily,~&#xD;
"what hare you observed? It is beautiful&#xD;
to see your perfect 1ra~at, your generous blind..&#xD;
ness; but, 'indeed, 'it is not wise, it is not&#xD;
doing jilatice to your-"&#xD;
She stopped short, for' Leslie turned tow-i&#xD;
ard her with a look on her thee such as. no-&#xD;
body had ever seen the fair, serene f&amp;amp;atnrea&#xD;
~vear before.&#xD;
"What do you mean?" she~asked. "Yen.&#xD;
said something like this yesterday, but I aifr&#xD;
not quick to read innuendoes - indeed, I'&#xD;
should scorn to read almost as much. as I'&#xD;
should scorn to make them. If you have.&#xD;
any thing to any-any thing to tell me-~--speak'&#xD;
plainly, and I will 'listen to you. But if yen&#xD;
only mean to hint and suggest like this, I&#xD;
have heard enough."&#xD;
"It is impossible for inc to speak plainly,"'&#xD;
said Mrs. Saudford, "atlenat, not now. But,&#xD;
o Leslie, if you would only open your eyes&#xD;
and look-"&#xD;
"I have heard enough I"' repeated Leslie,&#xD;
haughtily. She turned decidedly and walked&#xD;
a~y. "I should not be surprised if we had&#xD;
a thunder.storra this' afternoon," she said.&#xD;
"The air is sultry."&#xD;
"I. se~ that I had better go," said Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford, mounting a high horse of injured&#xD;
feeling. "I hat~e driven Captain Tyndale&#xD;
away, and offended you; but it may not be&#xD;
long before you will be sorry for not having&#xD;
listened to me, Leslie!"&#xD;
"I shall never be sorry for not having&#xD;

140                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.                                                    MORAL COWARDICE.                  141&#xD;
&#xD;
listened to anybody who dares not, or will&#xD;
not, speak outright!" said Leslie, turning&#xD;
round again ~' I detest insinuation!" she&#xD;
cried, in her proud, passionate, pained voice.&#xD;
"It means something, or it does not. In&#xD;
either case it is the weapon of a-" She&#xD;
stopped abruptly. "Coward," she would&#xD;
have added, if courtesy had not come to her&#xD;
aid in time.&#xD;
"Oh, pray say what you please!" cried&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford. "People who attempt to&#xD;
serve their friends must always expect to be&#xD;
treated like this. I knew it, of course, but&#xD;
my heart is so easily touched-I could not&#xD;
keep silence! As I said before, you will be&#xD;
sorry-when it is too late, perhaps."&#xD;
Then she turned hastily and left the room.&#xD;
It was not only the natural feminine desire&#xD;
for the last wQrd, which made her do this;*&#xD;
it was a measure of precaution lest she&#xD;
should be forced into a (metaphorical) corner,&#xD;
and made to confess oii how little of actual&#xD;
knowledge her insinuations were based. A&#xD;
few broken words on the terrace at Strafford&#xD;
which she had caught, and which might be&#xD;
denied outright by either~or both of the par-&#xD;
ties concerned-it would have been a sore&#xD;
humiliation to be obliged to confess that this&#xD;
was all. No, before she could speak, as she&#xD;
meant to speak, she must have proof, some-&#xD;
thing which could n0( be gainsaid. "I'll&#xD;
stay here until~I find that!" she said to her-&#xD;
s~lf, when she gained the solitude of her own&#xD;
room. It was a magnanimous resolution to&#xD;
take, and showed that she was in earnest in&#xD;
her desire-to serve Leslie! As a rule, she&#xD;
did not stay at. any place where she was not&#xD;
amused, and if Max deserted her standard4&#xD;
amusement (of the kind she liked) would cer-&#xD;
tainly be hard to find at Rosland.&#xD;
Max, meanwhile, had overtaken, .without&#xD;
very much difficult, the young, lady in a pur-&#xD;
ple muslin dress, which had not been donned&#xD;
for his benefit, since it was the same in which&#xD;
she had appeat~ed at both breakfast and lunch-&#xD;
eon, who was sauntering along under a sun-&#xD;
umbrella. Hearing his step, she had paused&#xD;
and turned round-brightening into wonder-&#xD;
ful beauty, he thought, as she smiled at his&#xD;
approach.&#xD;
"Is that your usual rate of walking?"&#xD;
she asked, as he gained her side. "If so,&#xD;
you mubi get over great dei~1 ~f ground in a&#xD;
very short time."&#xD;
"Is it your usual custom to come out at&#xD;
&#xD;
three r. M. of a July day 1' If so, you must&#xD;
be proof against sunstrokes and fevers."&#xD;
"It is very uncivil to answer a question&#xD;
by asking one."&#xD;
"I only wanted to show you that other&#xD;
things, as well as your present exercise, may&#xD;
be exceptional.~*&#xD;
"My present exercise is for a purpose,"&#xD;
said she. "What was the good of attempt-&#xD;
ing to talk to you in the house ?-and I saw&#xD;
you had something to say to me."&#xD;
"You are quite right," he answered. "I&#xD;
have something to say to you-something&#xD;
which brought me over from Strafford-but&#xD;
I really cannot imagine how you could have&#xD;
expected me to follow you, without a word to&#xD;
notify mc of your intention of going out."&#xD;
"Are you so stupid that words are neces-&#xD;
sary for you?" asked she. "I have known&#xD;
some men who might really have dispensed&#xD;
with language. A tone, a glance, was enough&#xD;
for them. One did not need to say, point-&#xD;
blank, 'Monsieur, put on your hat and meet&#xD;
me in the garden.' They knew-they divined&#xD;
-without a word."&#xD;
"What remarkably clcvcr fellows they&#xD;
must have been!" said Max. "But you&#xD;
might have discovered, some time ago, that I&#xD;
do not belong to such a class. I need words&#xD;
-the plainer the better. The proof of it is&#xD;
that it was only by chance I saw you-only&#xD;
by change that I am here now."&#xD;
"You must have been blind if you had&#xD;
not seen me!" said she, impatiently. "What!&#xD;
a woman in a purple dress walk across a green&#xD;
lawn in full view of an open window, and you&#xD;
tell me that it was only 'by chance' you saw&#xD;
her! You ought to have borrowed Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford's eye-glasses! She has so little need for&#xD;
them that she might readily have spared&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"That would have been turning her weap-&#xD;
ons against herself with a vengeance.'~&#xD;
"You mean that she was so anxious for&#xD;
you to remain? You share the proverbial&#xD;
modesty of your sex, I perceive! But, since&#xD;
you are here, suppose we proceed to business?&#xD;
You did not come for pleasure any more than&#xD;
I did, I any sure."&#xD;
"Speak for yourself!" said he, smiling.&#xD;
Her dauntless coolness and self-possession&#xD;
amused, even while it piqued him a little.&#xD;
He wondered if it WQuld not be possible to&#xD;
make her cheeks flush, her eyes droop, her&#xD;
ready tongue falter. Nothing was more un-&#xD;
&#xD;
likely, but he had an odd desire to see such a&#xD;
transformation.&#xD;
Indeed, I have not the least disposition&#xD;
to speak for you," said she, in answer to his&#xD;
last speech. "You have a tongue: you are&#xD;
able to do that for yourself'~ (this in rather a&#xD;
disparaging tone, as if there might be several&#xD;
other things which he was not able to do for&#xD;
himself). "If it amuses you to walk out&#xD;
here in the heat, I am glad of it; but it does&#xD;
not amuse me in the least, and therefore I&#xD;
wish you would say what you are going to&#xD;
say at once."&#xD;
"As a preliminary step, can't we sit down&#xD;
somewhere? Perpetual motion i~not pa~ticu.&#xD;
larly agreeable in cool weather, but in warm&#xD;
weather, it is intolerable."&#xD;
"There is nowhere to sit, unless we sit on&#xD;
the ground. The rustic seats are all on the&#xD;
other side of the lawn. You might have&#xD;
brought a camp-stool along if you had thouglft.&#xD;
Then I might have stood over you with an um-&#xD;
brella and a fan."&#xD;
"The prospect is so entrancing that I&#xD;
have half a mind to ~o back for the camp-&#xD;
stool."&#xD;
"Don't expect to find me when you return&#xD;
-that is all."&#xD;
"Let us try the ground, then," said he,&#xD;
taking out his handkerchief, and spreading it&#xD;
at the foot of a large tree. "Unless you are&#xD;
rheumatic, it is not likely to injure you."&#xD;
"I am afraid that, if I sit down, you will&#xD;
talk for an hour," said she, frankly; but she&#xD;
sat down, nevertheless. "Now, pray be brief t"&#xD;
she said, as he east himself carelessly on the&#xD;
warm grass by her side.&#xD;
"Very well," answered he. "To be as&#xD;
brief as possible, then, I have seen Arthur,&#xD;
and I have found him even more intractable&#xD;
than I expected. His character seems to&#xD;
have undergone the most sudden and wonder-&#xD;
ful change. , sullen and defiant and so&#xD;
He is&#xD;
impatient of the annoyance, which has been&#xD;
his own work, that I absolutely found him&#xD;
ready-prepared-to leave the country."&#xD;
"Indeed!" said she; but she evinced no&#xD;
~urprise. "Perhaps his character has not&#xD;
changed so much as you imagine," she added;&#xD;
"perhaps it has only developed. Well, he&#xD;
has made up his mind to leave the country,&#xD;
has he? But how about Leslie? She is not&#xD;
exactly a person whom even Mr. Arthur Tyn.&#xD;
dale can afford to jilt with impunity. Awom-&#xD;
an who, baa wealth, and position, and friends,&#xD;
&#xD;
0 ~&#xD;
&#xD;
to shield her, is not like a Bohemian waif.&#xD;
He ought to. remember that."&#xD;
"He is not sufficiently cool at present to&#xD;
remember any thing. But, when I-thinking&#xD;
only of Miss Grahame-ventured to offer for-&#xD;
* getfulness, in your name, and silence with re~&#xD;
gard to the past, he half agreed to keep faith&#xD;
with her."&#xD;
"Half agreed! Is the man mad? He&#xD;
must fancy himself a second King Louis of&#xD;
Bavaria-able, if he feels inclined, to jilt prin-&#xD;
cesses."&#xD;
"He professes himself unable to trust&#xD;
your promise. He insists upon some sub-&#xD;
stantial proof that you mean to allow the past&#xD;
to drop into oblivion. I am half afraid to tell&#xD;
you what this proof is."&#xD;
"Perhaps ~ can guess," said she, calmly.&#xD;
"He wants his letters, does he not?"&#xD;
"Yes, he wants his letters."&#xD;
"Really," said she, with a 1aug11, "his au-&#xD;
dacity is greater than even I had imagined!&#xD;
So he thinks himself able to dictate terms to&#xD;
me / And suppose I decline to return the let-&#xD;
ters-what then?"&#xD;
"I asked him that very question, and he&#xD;
replied by showing me his railroad-ticket.-&#xD;
That is 'what, then!' he answered."&#xD;
"Do you think he means it?" she asked,&#xD;
with a sudden flash in her eye. "Do yoa&#xD;
think he would dare it?"&#xD;
"I am sure he means it. I am inclined&#xD;
to thinI~ he would dare it. Easiest of all&#xD;
things to a moral coward is the thing called&#xD;
running away."&#xD;
"But, suppose I run into the house-this&#xD;
minute-and lay tile matter before Leslie's&#xD;
uncle? Cannot he find a remedy? Will he&#xD;
see her treated like this?"&#xD;
"He would probably insist at once upon&#xD;
her breaking the engagement, and h.~m would&#xD;
certainly forbid Arthur ever to enter his&#xD;
house or claim his acquaintance again."&#xD;
"Would he do nothing more than that?"&#xD;
"What else could he do? Gentlemen do&#xD;
not assault each other either with horse-&#xD;
whips or epithets. Dueling is not in Mr.&#xD;
Middleton's line, I imagine; and in any case&#xD;
the man is more than a fool who draws&#xD;
a woman's name into an affair of that&#xD;
kind."&#xD;
"Then the matter stands thus: I must&#xD;
either tell Leslie the truth, in order that she&#xD;
may be able to take the initiative step in&#xD;
breaking the engagement, or I must comply&#xD;
&#xD;

142&#xD;
&#xD;
A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
with this coward's demand and return his&#xD;
letters."&#xD;
"That is the light in which it stands, cci-&#xD;
tainly."&#xD;
"The coward!" said she, again, between&#xD;
her clinched teeth. "The false-hearted cow-&#xD;
ard! But do you not see that it would be&#xD;
madness to do this?" she cried, turning sud-&#xD;
denly, almost fiercely, upoti him. "Do you&#xD;
not see that, if I give up these letters, I place&#xD;
myself in Arthur Tyndale's power? My good&#xD;
name lies at his mercy! He could say any&#xD;
thing of me, and I should have no power to&#xD;
refute it! You do not think of me-you&#xD;
think altogether of Leslie, Captain Tyndale;&#xD;
but, when it comes to snob a point as this, I&#xD;
must think of myself."&#xD;
"You are mistaken," said Max. He spoke&#xD;
coolly enough, but, as he raised himself with&#xD;
sudden energy from the grass, there was a&#xD;
look of excitement not common with him on&#xD;
his face. "I do think of you; I have thought&#xD;
of you ever since lie made the proposal, but&#xD;
I wanted to see what you would say. You&#xD;
are quite right. There are no circumstances&#xD;
which would justify you in resigning those&#xD;
letters to a man whom no pledge of honor&#xD;
seems capable of binding."&#xD;
"And yet what remains for me?"&#xD;
"To tell the truth to Miss Grahaine."&#xD;
"You say that?" A look of surprise&#xD;
came into her face. Then she laughed-a&#xD;
faiiit, low laugh, which he did not understand.&#xD;
"You are very generous, Captain Tyndale. I&#xD;
fancied you would have been willing to sacri-&#xD;
fice me, and every thing connected with me,&#xD;
to spare Leslie one pang."&#xD;
"Why should you have fancied such a&#xD;
thing?" said he, almost ir~dignantly. "I&#xD;
know that women are prone to imagination,&#xD;
but still you do not realize as I do, Miss Des-&#xD;
inond, what you would be giving up if you&#xD;
relinquished those letters."&#xD;
"I think I realize perfectly," answered&#xD;
she. "I have seen a great deal of the world,&#xD;
and, as a rule, it does not show its best side&#xD;
to vagabonds. But there are one or two&#xD;
points to be considered," said she, plucking&#xD;
absently at the grass by her side. "In the&#xD;
first place, Arthur Tyndale's life and mine&#xD;
will, after this, lie far apart; it will be out&#xD;
of his power, therefore, to harm me very&#xD;
much. In the second place, he will have&#xD;
no reason to speak ill of me-on the con-&#xD;
~rary, it will be to his interest to keep all&#xD;
&#xD;
knowledge of our past acquaintance from&#xD;
Leslie."&#xD;
"It is not safe to trust to such contin-&#xD;
gencies as those," said Max, earnestly. "You&#xD;
cannot tell how far your life may yet meet,&#xD;
cross, be affected, by that of Arthur. It is&#xD;
as impossible to thrust people as to thrust&#xD;
memories absolutely away; they come back&#xD;
npon us when we are least expecting them.&#xD;
As for his having no reason to speak ill of&#xD;
you, young as you are, you ought to be&#xD;
enough a woman of the world to know better&#xD;
than that. You have~stung his vanity, and&#xD;
wounded his pride. Is not that reason enough&#xD;
to make you expect any degree of enmity,&#xD;
any falsity of slander?"&#xD;
"I must expect those things of neces-&#xD;
sity," said she. "I have tried them. They&#xD;
are not pleasant, but I can bear them."&#xD;
"You can bear them ! "repeated Max. He&#xD;
stared at her aghast. "You don't know&#xD;
what you are talking about," lie said, impa-&#xD;
tiently. "These things which you talk of&#xD;
'bearing' are poisoned arrows which have&#xD;
slain many a heart as high and proud as&#xD;
yours. You were right a few minutes ago&#xD;
when you said that you would put your good&#xD;
name absolutely into Arthur Tyndale's power&#xD;
by returning him these letters. Forgive me&#xD;
if I speak plainly, but it is necessary that&#xD;
you ~should understand why such a thing&#xD;
must not ~e done."&#xD;
"Not even for Leslie's sake?" asked she,&#xD;
looking at him intently.&#xD;
"No I" answered he, sharply. "The sac-&#xD;
rifice is too great-far greater than the occa-&#xD;
sion. Not to save your sisters heart from&#xD;
breaking, have you a right to do it!"&#xD;
She looked at him for a little while longer&#xD;
with eyes that softened momently. Some in-&#xD;
ner feeling seemed at work. Her lips quiv-&#xD;
ered slightly~a wave of color swept into her&#xD;
face, and then ebbed away. It was not quite&#xD;
the transformation for which Max had wished&#xD;
a short time before, but it was something&#xD;
like it.&#xD;
"You are very kind," she said, at last, in&#xD;
a voice that struck the ear as being full of&#xD;
more than one emotion. "It is very good of&#xD;
you-you who are Arthur Tyndale's cousin&#xD;
and Leslie's friend-to think of me. I had&#xD;
not expected it. You see I am not used to&#xD;
consideration - admiration, and attention,&#xD;
perhaps, but not consideration. I thought&#xD;
you would think of Leslie and Leslie~s inter-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
IHE ONLY ALTERNATIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
eat alone. Well, since~ you do not think of&#xD;
it, I must," she added. "Captain Tyndale,&#xD;
do you know what Leslie is to me?"&#xD;
"Your sister, is she not?" said he, doubt-&#xD;
fully, wondering what would come next. Sure-&#xD;
ly this was an incomprehensible woman-n&#xD;
woman who made such wild havoc of all his&#xD;
previous opinions concerning her that he be-&#xD;
gan to resign himself to having no opinion at&#xD;
all, but simply accepting whatever view of her&#xD;
varying character she chose to show him.&#xD;
"My sister," repeated she, doubtfully.&#xD;
"Yes, she is that, and I suppose it means&#xD;
something- but not very much! She is&#xD;
more than that, Captain Tyndale. She is the&#xD;
first person who has ever-ever in nil our&#xD;
lives-made a kind advance to us, or held&#xD;
out a helping hand. My mother's relations&#xD;
have ,never taken the slightest notice of us.&#xD;
Papa's relations long ago discarded him. He&#xD;
comes of good people," said she, drawing her-&#xD;
self up with all the pride of her Milesian&#xD;
blood; "but, of course, that did not help us,&#xD;
since the good people had long since-before&#xD;
I was born, I suppose-given him up. But&#xD;
Leslie came forward-without any need to do&#xD;
so, in the face of all the prejudices of her&#xD;
caste-and held out her hand to us. It makes&#xD;
a tie stronger than that of blood!" cried she,&#xD;
with eyes that melted and flashed both at&#xD;
once. "She meant to do u~ good, and shalL&#xD;
my coming work her harm? Not if I can&#xD;
help it, you may be sure!"&#xD;
"But can you help it?" asked lie, look.&#xD;
ing at her, and thinking that he had never&#xD;
seen a more beautiful and majestic creature&#xD;
than she seemed just then.&#xD;
* "I can help it by giving Arthur Tyndale&#xD;
what lie demands-his letters."&#xD;
"You will not!" cried he, quickly-al-&#xD;
most passionately. "You are not in earnest;&#xD;
you will not do such a thing!"&#xD;
"Yes, I am in earnest," answered she.&#xD;
"After all, he may have some faint instinct&#xD;
of honor, and the fact that I am in his power&#xD;
may seal his lips."&#xD;
"I might have thought that yesterday,&#xD;
but not to-day. To-day I know him to be&#xD;
false and treacherous to the very core-to be&#xD;
literally without a single instinct of the man&#xD;
of honor!"&#xD;
"Still," said she, "I must risk it, since&#xD;
you tell me that this is the only alternative;&#xD;
that lie will certainly leave as he threatens if&#xD;
I refuse-&#xD;
&#xD;
143&#xD;
&#xD;
"Upon my word, Miss Desmond," inter-&#xD;
rupted he, "you tempt me to go to your sis-&#xD;
ter and tell her the whole truth on my own&#xD;
responsibility."&#xD;
"You would not dare to do such a thing!"&#xD;
cried she. "It is not your secret! You have&#xD;
no right !-it would be infamous!"&#xD;
"I only said you tempted me; but it would&#xD;
be better than this which you propose."&#xD;
"I must make one condition, however,"&#xD;
said she, imperiously, sweeping his objections&#xD;
away like cobwebs, as he could not help feel-&#xD;
ing; "my letters, if Arthur Tyndale still re-&#xD;
tains them, they must be returned."&#xD;
"I made that condition in your name, and&#xD;
lie assures me-I am ineliped to think, truly&#xD;
-that he has not a line of one of them."&#xD;
Then, as it to apologize, "Men seldom keep&#xD;
such things, you know."&#xD;
"It does not matter very much whether&#xD;
lie is speaking truly or falsely," said she, care.&#xD;
lessly.. "I am glad to remember that I was&#xD;
not foolish enough to put any thing on record&#xD;
against myself which the whole world might&#xD;
not read. A propose of letters," said she,&#xD;
turning suddenly again, "did you destroy, or&#xD;
have you still, the one I wrote to Kate, and&#xD;
which the wind carried to you?"&#xD;
"Destroy it!" repeated he, starting. "I&#xD;
-I do not think so. Why do you asJ~?"&#xD;
"Simply because I feel a natural curiosity&#xD;
to know what has become of it, and a natural&#xD;
reluctance to its falling into other hands. I&#xD;
wrote more freely in that letter than I often&#xD;
do. Ink and paper are unsafe things to trust,&#xD;
if only for the reason that they often outlast&#xD;
more solid things. Since you have not de-&#xD;
stroyed the letter, I shall be glad if you will&#xD;
return it."&#xD;
"I am very sori'y," said he, looking at her&#xD;
with honest, troubled eyes, "but I am serious-&#xD;
ly in doubt about that letter. * I do not know&#xD;
what has become of it. I may have destroyed&#xD;
or I may have mislaid it; but, at least; I can-&#xD;
not. find it. I know there is no excuse for&#xD;
me, but I have looked for it several times, and&#xD;
I will look again."&#xD;
"How is it possible that you could have~&#xD;
destroyed it without knowing?" asked No-&#xD;
rab. If she had glanced at him nuspieiou8ly,&#xD;
it might have been forgiven her. That expe-&#xD;
rience of the rougher side of life, on which&#xD;
she dwelt so much, did not incline her to a&#xD;
very childlike faith in men or thei~' asser-&#xD;
tions.&#xD;

"I am often very absent - minded," said&#xD;
Max, who saw the suspicion, but had sense&#xD;
enough not to resent it. "I have often de-&#xD;
stroyed a letter, and then wanted it. I may&#xD;
have destroyed this one, or I may have mis-&#xD;
laid it, though .1 can't magicc where!" said&#xD;
he, with a puzzled look.&#xD;
This look somewhat convinced her of his&#xD;
sincerity. She questioned him closely as to&#xD;
when he had seen the letter last, what he had&#xD;
done with it, and where he had put it, until&#xD;
she finally elicited the fact that it had "prob-&#xD;
ably" been left on his table, with other pa.&#xD;
pers, on the evening of the day which they&#xD;
had spent at Strafford. "Is that your last&#xD;
recollection of it?" asked she, looking at&#xD;
him keenly.&#xD;
"That is my last recollection of it. I re-&#xD;
member I walked out for a few minutes that&#xD;
night "-one's memory plays one tricks some-&#xD;
times: Max honestly thought it had only been&#xD;
a few minutes-" and when I came back I&#xD;
found the wind had scattered my papers over&#xD;
the floor."&#xD;
"But when you gathered them up, did&#xD;
you not notice whether this letter was among&#xD;
them?"&#xD;
"I did not gather them up at once, be-&#xD;
cause-" He stopped short. A flash of light&#xD;
seemed to come to him. "By Jove!" he&#xD;
said, under his mustache; "could its have&#xD;
done such a thing?"&#xD;
"Mr. Tyndale, do you mean?" asked No-&#xD;
rah, whose ears were quick. "I have not&#xD;
doubted from the first but that he has the let-&#xD;
ter. If you found him in your room on the&#xD;
night you missed it, that is very good proof.&#xD;
Well, I make the return of it a 'condition also&#xD;
-let him understand that, Captain Tyndale."&#xD;
*"He may deny that he has it-he may&#xD;
affirm that he has destroyed it."&#xD;
"The first you know to be false; the sec-&#xD;
ond is not likely."&#xD;
"I cannot imagine how I shall constrain&#xD;
myself to meet him, to speak to him!" said&#xD;
the young man, bitterly. "He has proved&#xD;
himself so false-he is so utterly unworthy of&#xD;
the name he bears!"&#xD;
"If we never met or spoke to people who&#xD;
are false, our list ~f acquaintances would be a&#xD;
very small one!" said Norah, cynically. "But&#xD;
it has certainly struck me more than once that&#xD;
you have taken a great deal of annoyance and&#xD;
trouble upon yourself from pure friendship-&#xD;
riatonic and otherwise."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
"Caii a man sit mute by a fast-barred door&#xD;
While the night-showers cut through the shiv-&#xD;
ering skin,&#xD;
Yet love in her hardness, love on, love more,&#xD;
That cold-eyed beauty who smiles within?&#xD;
Such a man-he is dead long since-I knew:&#xD;
There was one thatnevercould know him-you!"&#xD;
Ir the events of this particular day have&#xD;
seemed long in narrating-and they are not&#xD;
yet over-they seemed even longer in tran-&#xD;
spiring to me than one member of the house-&#xD;
hold at Rosland. As Norab, having com-&#xD;
pleted her dinner - toilet, stood before her&#xD;
open window for a moment, looking out on&#xD;
the dying beauty of the summer evening, she&#xD;
asked herself if it had really been only one&#xD;
day since she had looked out of the window&#xD;
on the sparkling freshness of early morning.&#xD;
"It has seemed like two or three days melt-&#xD;
ed into one!" she said, wearily. "And it is&#xD;
not yet over-indeed, its most trying period&#xD;
is yet to come!"&#xD;
The sound of carriage-wheels warned her,&#xD;
however, that she could not give any more&#xD;
time to meditation; so, taking her fan and&#xD;
gloves, and with a last glance in the mirror,&#xD;
she went down-stairs. The drawing-room was&#xD;
already full, but the hum of conversation&#xD;
ceased a little as she entered. Many of the&#xD;
guests had not seen her before, others were&#xD;
anxious to see her again-a slight, involun-&#xD;
tary thrill of admiration passed round the&#xD;
r6om. Nobody could deny Norah Desmond's&#xD;
beauty. It was for the comprehension and&#xD;
appreciation alike of prince and peasant. She&#xD;
was so well accustomed to the sensation&#xD;
which her appearance always made, that it&#xD;
brought no added color to her face, no tinge&#xD;
of self - consciousness to her manner. She&#xD;
spoke to one or two people whom she knew,&#xD;
and then crossed the room to Leslie, before&#xD;
she perceived that Arthur Tyndale was stand-&#xD;
ing by her aide. Recognizing him with a&#xD;
start, she bowed, and then turned to her sis-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
"I fear I am late," she said, more for the&#xD;
sake of saying something than because she&#xD;
really did fear it&#xD;
"Not at all," answered Leslie. "There&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
A DINNER-PARTY.&#xD;
&#xD;
are several people yet to come-people wh&#xD;
do not understand the necessity of punctu&#xD;
ality at a dinner-party. And there is Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford just entering!" she said, with some&#xD;
thing like a laugh in her voice. "Fancy&#xD;
how some of our old-fashioned friends arc&#xD;
shocked!"&#xD;
Norah turned. Her first thought was&#xD;
that the old - fashioned friends in question&#xD;
might be excused; for certainly a lady so d6.&#xD;
co1let~e as Mrs. Sandford was, is rarely seen&#xD;
in a country drawing-room. Magnificent of&#xD;
train and 6o~~,fante of overskirt was her laven-&#xD;
der silk, with its thread-lace flounces of fabu-&#xD;
Ions value; but the fashionable lowne~s of&#xD;
her corsage, and the fashionable shortness of&#xD;
her sleeves, were a revelation to the country-&#xD;
bred eyes looking on. 'k~id you ever see&#xD;
the like of that?" more than one lady said&#xD;
in a w~iisper to her neighbor, while one un-&#xD;
sophisticated young person turned into a cor-&#xD;
ner to blush. The shoulders and arms thus&#xD;
lavishly displayed had some flesh on them,&#xD;
however - which is more than can always&#xD;
be said-and the diamonds which encircled&#xD;
them soon brought public virtue down to&#xD;
a temperate point of tolerance.&#xD;
Somewhat to Norah's surprise, she found&#xD;
herself assigned to Max Tyndale when dinner&#xD;
was announced.&#xD;
"This is kinder of Mrs. Middleton than I&#xD;
hoped!" she said, frankly, as they moved&#xD;
out of the drawing-room. "I fully expected&#xD;
to be given over to the tender mercies of a&#xD;
oQuntry Philistine-probably that young Coy-&#xD;
ington who took my breath away a few min-&#xD;
utes ago by coolly addressing me as 'Miss&#xD;
Norah~'"&#xD;
"Did you not know that that is the cus-&#xD;
tomary form of address in this country?"&#xD;
asked Max. "It is scarcely likely that he&#xD;
intended to be impertinent."&#xD;
"Do you mean to say that it is the cus-&#xD;
tom of the country among well - bred peo-&#xD;
ple?" asked she. "Do you mean to tell me&#xD;
that it is considered good style? Why, it is&#xD;
atadge of vulgarians abroad."&#xD;
"It is not the custom of the country&#xD;
among the very best-bred people," answered&#xD;
he; "but a great many people who are well&#xD;
bred in every thing else do it, and mean no&#xD;
harm-like our guileless young friend, who&#xD;
never called any woman ~y her surname for&#xD;
more than ten minutes, I suppose~"&#xD;
"He will not be likely to call mc by any&#xD;
10&#xD;
&#xD;
145&#xD;
&#xD;
thing else again," said she, laughing. "I&#xD;
- gave him a stare which petrified him."&#xD;
*     "How would you like to be called 'Mi~~&#xD;
- Nonie?'" asked he, smiling. (They had sat&#xD;
down to table by this time.) "I heard a&#xD;
young lady, who was baptized Leonora, ad-&#xD;
dressed by that euphonious diminutive the&#xD;
other day."&#xD;
"I detest all hut a very few abbrevia-&#xD;
tions," said she, "and with silly ones I have&#xD;
no patience. If I were a queen, I would rig-&#xD;
orously abolish them. Anybody found guilty,&#xD;
for instance, of transforming the queenly&#xD;
name of Margaret into Maggie, should cer-&#xD;
tainly be imprisoned; and I should make it a&#xD;
* capital offense to call a Mary by any of the&#xD;
numerous nicknames of that most holy and&#xD;
beautiful of names.~~&#xD;
"I am afraid your subjects would rebel.&#xD;
Nothing is so dear to the feminine heart as&#xD;
abbreviations. There is Mrs. Sandford, for&#xD;
instance, who looks like the Queen of Sheba,&#xD;
or Solomon in all his glory, yet who writes&#xD;
little gushing school-girl notes, and signs them&#xD;
Nellie.' "&#xD;
~' Mrs. Sandford will smack of bread-and-&#xD;
butter as long as she lives," said Norah.&#xD;
"By-the-by, she is looking handsome, is she&#xD;
not? But her dress would suh a ball better&#xD;
than a dinner-with a game of ckquet in&#xD;
prospect."&#xD;
"Do you remember a little poem of Owen&#xD;
Meredith's, called 'Madame Ia Marquise?"'&#xD;
asked Max. "Of course you do-everybody&#xD;
does! It might answer for a portrait, don't&#xD;
you think ?-especially these verses:&#xD;
'Could we find out her heart through that velvet&#xD;
and lace!&#xD;
Can it beat without ruffling her sumptuous&#xD;
drass?&#xD;
She will show us her shoulder, her bosom, her&#xD;
face;&#xD;
But what the heart's like, we must guess.&#xD;
'With live women and men to be found in the&#xD;
world-&#xD;
(Live with sorrow and sin-live with pain anil&#xD;
with passion)-&#xD;
Who could live with a doll, though its locks should&#xD;
be curled,&#xD;
And its petticoats trimmed in the fashion?'"&#xD;
"I am sure Mrs. Sandford would be much&#xD;
complimented by the comparison," said No-&#xD;
rah, mischievously. "She told me the other&#xD;
day that she 'adored' Owen Meredith. I&#xD;
took it for granted that she meant his po-&#xD;
etry."&#xD;

.146                      A DAUGHTER&#xD;
Qbserving the precept of charity after&#xD;
this admirable fashion, their conversation&#xD;
flowed like a stream of easy, rippling water.&#xD;
Norah's tongue always had the true Milesian&#xD;
Ilt~ency-flobody aver had to "make talk"&#xD;
with her.-and Max was not half a Frenchman&#xD;
for nothing. One topic naturally led to anoth-&#xD;
er, and it was not until a momentary lull&#xD;
camethathe said:&#xD;
" I did~ not see Arthur, after all. He had&#xD;
left Stratford when I got back, and he did not&#xD;
return before coming here. So I have not&#xD;
delivered your message."&#xD;
"Indeed 1-I am sorry!" she answered.&#xD;
That was all she trusted herself to say; there&#xD;
were too many inquisitive ears around&#xD;
According to the English fashion-which&#xD;
was a novelty in M-..- County-the gen-&#xD;
,tlemen were left over their wine, while the&#xD;
ladies scattered about the drawing-room in&#xD;
knots and groups, talking bits of country&#xD;
gossip, mingled with remarks on the state&#xD;
of the gardens, the st&amp;amp;te of the roads,&#xD;
and the state of the weather. Everybody&#xD;
knew everybody else - for it was a "nice"&#xD;
neighborhood- and general good-fellowship&#xD;
prevailed. Norah was the only person who&#xD;
was outside the charmed circle of sympathy&#xD;
and knowledge. The ladies were shy of her&#xD;
because' they were afraid of her; she was&#xD;
stiff with them because she knew very little&#xD;
of women, and because she had a habit of&#xD;
instinctively arming herself against possible&#xD;
or probable patronage. She was tired, too,&#xD;
and the chatter of many voices wearied her;&#xD;
*           so, stepping through an open window' to the&#xD;
veranda beyond, she stood under one of the&#xD;
leafy arches, resting her mind with the soft,&#xD;
fragrant quiet of the outer world, and watch-&#xD;
ing the moon rising in majesty above the tree-&#xD;
tops into the clear eastern heaven.&#xD;
*              How beautiful it was! The earth seemed&#xD;
lying in a trance under the silvery lustre&#xD;
which made a brightnesS like that or day&#xD;
without its heat. The sky was a deep hya-&#xD;
cinth - blue, the shadows where they rested&#xD;
were dark without being dense,' but where&#xD;
the moonlight fell in broad, white glory, every&#xD;
leaf and spray was clearly visible, every peb-&#xD;
ble shone like a jeweL It is something for&#xD;
which we should thank ~od afresh every time&#xD;
it comes - this marvelous, matchless beauty&#xD;
of moonlight, this tender, dazzling radiance,&#xD;
which, putting aside all the colors that deck&#xD;
the day, paints the earth in black and white,&#xD;
&#xD;
OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
and makes it of a something so fair that we&#xD;
are fain to liken it to our earthly imaginings&#xD;
of the "city of the saints of Ood2'&#xD;
Norab was so absorbed in the beauty of&#xD;
the scene, and so rapt in thought, that she&#xD;
did not notice the entrance of the gentlemen&#xD;
into the room behind her; and she was still&#xD;
standing- a statue-like figure in the lustrous&#xD;
light, with the graceful tracery of leaves and&#xD;
starry flowers all around her-.-when some one&#xD;
came to her side and said, "I thought it&#xD;
could only be yod I"&#xD;
She turned abruptly-fancying, for a mo-&#xD;
ment, that the voice was that of Arthur Tyn.&#xD;
dale- but it was Carl Middleton who was&#xD;
looking at her, with something strangely pas-&#xD;
sionate and wistful on his face. She was so&#xD;
much relieved that she smiled.&#xD;
"Is it you?" she said. "I thought it was&#xD;
some one much more disagreeable!"&#xD;
"I am glad to know that there is any one&#xD;
whom you consider more disagreeable," said&#xD;
he. "I fancied that, in your eyes, I had cer-&#xD;
tainly attained the superlative degree in that&#xD;
quality at least."&#xD;
"You know that is nonsense," answered&#xD;
she, impatiently. "I do not consider you&#xD;
disagreeable at all, unless-unless you make&#xD;
yourself so 1"&#xD;
"That is to say, if I chose to talk com-&#xD;
Inonpiaces, like any other man~ to whom you&#xD;
were introduced an hour ago, you w~uld tol-&#xD;
erate me as you tolerate him. Well, it does&#xD;
not matter. Your toleration, or want of tol-&#xD;
eration, will soon be over for me. I came to&#xD;
say good-by."&#xD;
"Good-by !" she echoed. His manner star-&#xD;
tled her even more than his words; there was&#xD;
something in it totally new, something which&#xD;
she did not understand. "But why 'good-&#xD;
by?' Are you going away-now.?"&#xD;
"Yes, I am going away now. I need&#xD;
change of air-I do not think this climate&#xD;
agrees with me. Besides" (fiercely)," I am&#xD;
done with making a fool of myself! I see at&#xD;
last how useless and hopeless it is! I eenze&#xD;
too tate / What can a man do against the&#xD;
spell of old association? I am going- at&#xD;
once!"&#xD;
"It is a very good resolution!" said No-&#xD;
rah, coldly. Nobody can blame her if she was&#xD;
tired of this violent and impracticable suitor&#xD;
of hers. A man who cannot understand a&#xD;
rejection, and who refuses to take it quietly,&#xD;
makes himself worse than a bore in the eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
CARL MIDDLETON'S RESOLUTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
of a woman. However sorry she may have&#xD;
been for him at first, this sorrow inevitably&#xD;
changes into impatience, disgust, and con-&#xD;
tempt, if she is annoyed by undesired per-&#xD;
sistence. Now, Norah had not only been&#xD;
wearied by Carl, but she had been provoked&#xD;
and insulted by him-he had indeed repeated&#xD;
his worst offense in his last words there-&#xD;
fore her voice sounded like ice when she&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"It is a very good resolution."&#xD;
"I was sure you Would think so!" he&#xD;
said, defiantly. ~' I was sure I could not&#xD;
bring you better news. But you do n~t ask&#xD;
roe where I am going-.I thought you might&#xD;
take enough interest in me for that! '~&#xD;
She looked at him doubtfully. What did&#xD;
he mean 2 More and more it struck her how&#xD;
unlike himself he wan More and more she&#xD;
perceived what a pale, passionate face it was&#xD;
on which the moonlight shone.&#xD;
"If you would let me, I should be glad&#xD;
to know-I should be glad to take interest,"&#xD;
she said, hesitatingly. After all, he 'was not&#xD;
accountable, perhaps, for hi~ defiant looks,&#xD;
his significant tones, hi~ reckless words.&#xD;
Men are such fools-that was the result of&#xD;
Norah's experience as well as Mvs. Sandford's&#xD;
-and he was crazy just now, poor 'boy!&#xD;
"I am going down to L-.--..- County to see&#xD;
my relations there. Even ha the short time&#xD;
that I have been here they have given me no&#xD;
peace," he said, after u minute. "That is in&#xD;
the opposite direction from Alton, you know&#xD;
-or perhaps you don't know. I take the&#xD;
down-train which pasaes.--whieh has lately&#xD;
passed-Wexford at 9.40, and meets the&#xD;
Alton train at the station below."&#xD;
"Yes," said Norah. He puzzled her more&#xD;
and more. This information about trains&#xD;
seemed given with a purpose, and yet what&#xD;
could it be? "If your train passes Wenford&#xD;
at 9.40, and you mean to leave to-night, you&#xD;
will have to go very soon, then, will you&#xD;
not?" she asked, more for want of any thing&#xD;
else to say than because she had any dispo-&#xD;
aition to hasten his departure.&#xD;
"Yes, I shall have to go very soon-at&#xD;
once, indeed,'? he said, looking at her quick-&#xD;
ly, with a suspicious, sidelong glance.&#xD;
But, despite this fact, 'he stood beside her&#xD;
for a minute longer. Something seemed to&#xD;
rise to his lips; he hesitated an instant, then&#xD;
did not utter it. Steps were heard appro~tch.&#xD;
ing-voices sounded at the open window. He&#xD;
&#xD;
turned away-.'~then suddenly Itumed bwck and&#xD;
grasped her wrIst.&#xD;
"X don't think you will ever know wI~at&#xD;
yen havethrowu away hi throwing away rite,"&#xD;
he said.~.this is soaietliing) by-the-by, whThh&#xD;
a grant many men think, Though most uf&#xD;
them refrain from uttering it t.-..." I would&#xD;
have done any thing to serve you, any thing&#xD;
on God's earths I would have hesitated at&#xD;
aotkiuy, Norah I lint you have showed me&#xD;
that you prefer falsehood, and 'treachery, and&#xD;
deceit, to an honest man's honest love, and I&#xD;
-'what cani do? But if even yet-.-e'vea yet,&#xD;
Norab-."&#xD;
4'Iiet go my arm!" said Nor ,-4fl purl-&#xD;
ously, and in the moonlight he saw the&#xD;
haughty lightning that ~aahed from her eyes.&#xD;
"I have heard enough. I hope that change&#xD;
of air will restore your senses to 'you; but at&#xD;
present you have certainly lost them alto-&#xD;
gether!"&#xD;
"When it is too Into, remember that it is&#xD;
your own Dtult-~.that I gave you one last op-&#xD;
portunity!" he said, dropping her arm.&#xD;
And even in the midst of her anger, his&#xD;
tone startled her again. It. was so s'ignifi-&#xD;
cant-it so plainly meant something more&#xD;
than met the ear. Had he really gone crazy?&#xD;
What was he talking about? This was what&#xD;
Notah asked herself', puzzled, bewildered, in-&#xD;
dignant, all at once.&#xD;
While she ttillstood hesitati~g.-uncertain&#xD;
whether or not to demand an explanation.--.&#xD;
Mr. Middleton stepped through the open win~&#xD;
dow behind them, and her opportunity was&#xD;
lost.&#xD;
"What t--.are you here yet, Carl?" he&#xD;
said, in a tone of surprise. "I told your&#xD;
aunt a minute ago that I thought you 'were&#xD;
gone. She doesn't like it at all, I can tell&#xD;
you-leaving a party in the lurch this way~-.'&#xD;
so perhaps, as you are Still here, you had beta&#xD;
ter put off your departure till to - morrow&#xD;
morning."&#xD;
"No," said Carl, in a quick, obstinate&#xD;
voice, "I shall go to-night. I am sorry if&#xD;
Aunt Mildred does not like it-.--but I must&#xD;
go."&#xD;
"You know your own affairs best, of&#xD;
course,' said his uncle, coldly; "but I think&#xD;
you are likely to miss the trahi If you stay&#xD;
here ranch langar."&#xD;
"It Is not quite nine o'clock," said t~arl~&#xD;
glancing at his watch.. "I can certainly drir.&#xD;
to Wexford in forty minutes."&#xD;

148&#xD;
&#xD;
A DAUGItTER OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
The game of croquet was by this time be-&#xD;
ing organized on the lawn. The hoops were&#xD;
er~eted, and the opposing parties had mar-&#xD;
shalled themselves. Some one caine up to No-&#xD;
rah. Would she play? At first she declined,&#xD;
but, on second thought, consented. The te-&#xD;
dious hours had to be got through in some&#xD;
fashion - perhaps croquet was as good a&#xD;
means as any other. So she walked away,&#xD;
and Carl turned into the house. He had his&#xD;
dinner-dress to change, he muttered, for a&#xD;
traveling-suit.&#xD;
At nine punctually he took his departure.&#xD;
Norah, who was standing, mallet in hand, on&#xD;
the farther side of the croquet-ground, heard&#xD;
a rattle of wheels, and, looking across the&#xD;
lawn, saw the light dog-cart spinning around&#xD;
the drive and out of the gate.&#xD;
"Who is that?" asked her companion,&#xD;
surprised. "Surely, nobody is leaving at&#xD;
this hour of the evening!"&#xD;
"I think it is Mr. Middleton-Mr. Carl&#xD;
Middleton," she answered, stooping to give&#xD;
her ball a very unscientific blow. "He said&#xD;
that he had to go away to-night-to see some&#xD;
friends, I think."&#xD;
"Carl's a queer fellow? isn't he?" said I&#xD;
the other-the same free-and-easy young gen-&#xD;
tleman who had called her "Miss Norab."&#xD;
"We've seen nothing of him in this part of&#xD;
the country since he was grown; but every-&#xD;
body always expected that he would marry&#xD;
Miss Leslie, and there was great astonish-&#xD;
ment on all hands when we heard that she&#xD;
was engaged to Arthur Tyndale. Not but&#xD;
that it's a capital match, you know, but still&#xD;
it was always understood that she was te&#xD;
marry Carl, and so we were astonished."&#xD;
"Was it understood that she was to mar-&#xD;
ry Carl?" asked Norab, starting. "Such&#xD;
things seldom come to pass as parents and&#xD;
guardians wish them to do," she said.&#xD;
Meanwhile Leslie was moving among her&#xD;
guests with a very sore and troubled heart.&#xD;
She had been almost, if not quite, ready to&#xD;
forget all her doubts and suspicions when&#xD;
Tyndide had appeared before dinner- the&#xD;
first sight of his fair, handsome fa~e, the first&#xD;
tone of his voice, had made her heart leap up&#xD;
with a loving, grateful sense that all must be&#xD;
well, that in him, at least, could be no decep-&#xD;
tion nor wrong; but afterward she could not&#xD;
banish the sense that some change had come&#xD;
over him. He was not himself. There was&#xD;
something wrong with him. She felt that in-&#xD;
&#xD;
stinctively. In her society he was constrained&#xD;
-she felt Ikat with a pang which only those&#xD;
who have ever seen this subtle but most im-&#xD;
passable barrier coming between themselves&#xD;
and those they love can imagine. After din)~&#xD;
ncr she was dully, sorely conscious that he&#xD;
was avoiding her. He sat down by Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford, and began what looked very much&#xD;
like one of the old-time flirtations. *But Lea-&#xD;
lie had never been jealous of the old-time&#xD;
flirtations. Now she was not exactly jealous,&#xD;
but her heart burned within her; the scene&#xD;
of the night before came back again. "Any-&#xD;
body but me!" she thought, "anybody but&#xD;
me!" Once, when he spoke to her, she fan-&#xD;
cied-for she was not blind, as many women&#xD;
are-that there was the glow of champagne&#xD;
on his cheeks, the light of champagne in&#xD;
his eyes. Then her heart grew sorer still.&#xD;
He had never forgotten himself like this be-&#xD;
fore. What did it mean?&#xD;
Mrs. Sauzlford was not playing croquet.&#xD;
That might readily have been predicted from&#xD;
her toilet. In the drawing-room, and, after a&#xD;
while, on the moon-lighted veranda, she sat&#xD;
with a court round her, like the Madame Ia&#xD;
Marquise to whom Max had likened her. She&#xD;
had indulged in more than one innuendo to&#xD;
Arthur T5?ndale, but her courage had not been&#xD;
equal to touching openly the subject of his&#xD;
"flirtation" (so she would mildly have phrased&#xD;
it), with Norah 'Desmond. Opportunity had&#xD;
not been lacking; but she had found it pleas-&#xD;
anter to flirt with him herself, to bend her&#xD;
elaborately coiffed head toward him, to shrug&#xD;
her white shoulders, to open wide her blue&#xD;
eyes, to ripple over with exclamations and&#xD;
adjectives. As for Arthur,~ it was the easiest&#xD;
thing at hand to do-it certainly required no&#xD;
effort either of mind or body-and, remem-&#xD;
bering what Norah had told him, he had an&#xD;
idea that he might win this pretty widow, his&#xD;
"old friend," over to his side again.&#xD;
When others claimed his attention, how-&#xD;
ever, he rose and strolled away. A spirit of&#xD;
restlessness possessed him. He looked inte&#xD;
the drawing-room. Whist and conversation&#xD;
reigned there. He shrank equally from both,&#xD;
so he wended his way across the lawn to the&#xD;
croquet-party. Even that was better: he&#xD;
might see Leslie, plead a headache, and take&#xD;
leave at once.&#xD;
On reaching th~ players, he found that&#xD;
Leslie was not to be seen. She had been&#xD;
looking on for a while; but she had walked&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE LOST I&#xD;
&#xD;
away with a stranger who admired the&#xD;
grounds, and wanted to see more of them.&#xD;
This was what somebody told Arthur. He felt&#xD;
vexed and impatient-just then every thing&#xD;
vexed this unreasonable young man. "Why&#xD;
was she out of the way?" he thought.&#xD;
Standing there in the moonlight, a sudden&#xD;
feeling of isolation came over him; the elink&#xD;
of the balls, the merry peals of laughter, the&#xD;
fragments of speech, jarred upon and irritated&#xD;
him. He felt none of the spell of the dreamy,&#xD;
lustrous night-a sublimated day, it seemed&#xD;
-none of the poetry, which youth and happi-&#xD;
ness always create, in the scene. "Your&#xD;
play, Miss Desmond!" somebody called out.&#xD;
Then he started and frowned. Norah's name&#xD;
was worst of all!&#xD;
At that moment he made up his mind to&#xD;
take French leave of the party, and return to&#xD;
Straffdrd. With regard to Leslie, he felt&#xD;
reckless. He had already neglected her so&#xD;
much, that a little more neglect scarcely mat-&#xD;
tered. He had half turned away, when a&#xD;
young man, who was standing not far off, with&#xD;
a girl, called out:&#xD;
"Tyndale, can you lend me a pencil?"&#xD;
"I suppose so," answered Tyndale, invol-&#xD;
untarily. He did not feel in a particularly&#xD;
obliging mood; but, when we are asked to&#xD;
I ad a thing which we kndw to be reposing in&#xD;
pocket, the impulse is with most of us&#xD;
tl~at we do it. He took out a pocket-book,&#xD;
and, drawing a pencil fror~i it, handed it to&#xD;
the other. "What do you want to do with&#xD;
it?" he asked, carelessly.&#xD;
"I want to write off a capital acrostic for&#xD;
Miss Minnie," the young man answered. "If&#xD;
you'll wait a minute&#xD;
"Oh, the pencil is of no importance," said&#xD;
Tyndale, walking away. He felt a momentary&#xD;
envy for people who could be amused by&#xD;
"capital acrostics," and yet a certain con-&#xD;
tempt, also. "Vapid fools!" he called them,&#xD;
in his own mind, as he closed the pocket-&#xD;
book, and returned it to his pocket.&#xD;
Returned it! That is to say, he tkougkt&#xD;
that he returned it; but the chaippagne must&#xD;
have been in his fingers, as well as in his&#xD;
head, for certainly the book slipped, in some&#xD;
unaccountable way, past the pocket, or out&#xD;
of the pocket, and thence down to the ground,&#xD;
where he, unconsciously, walked away and&#xD;
left it.&#xD;
* There it still lay, a dark object on the&#xD;
moonlit sward, when Mrs. Sandford came&#xD;
&#xD;
'OCKET-BOOK.                          149&#xD;
across the lawn to look at the game, attended&#xD;
by a brace of cavaliers, with her silken train&#xD;
thrown over her white arm. One of the cava-&#xD;
liers in question struck his foot against this&#xD;
object, and, stooping down, picked it up.&#xD;
"By George!" he said. "Some fellow&#xD;
has lost a pocket-book, and left all his secrets&#xD;
of love and war at the mercy of the public.&#xD;
Who was it, I wonder ?-Armistead, have you&#xD;
lost any thing of the kind?"&#xD;
"Not I," answered the other cavalier.&#xD;
"But it will not be difficult to find the owner.&#xD;
-I say, Cour~enaye" (turning round to ad-&#xD;
dress the writer of the acrostic), "have you&#xD;
lost a pocket-book?"&#xD;
"No," answered Courtenayc; "but Tyn-&#xD;
dale has, very likely. At least he took out&#xD;
his, to lend me a pencil, about ten minutes&#xD;
ago."&#xD;
"Tyndale!"repeated Mrs. Sandford, quick-&#xD;
ly She extended her hand, and seized the&#xD;
pocket-book, before its astonished finder knew&#xD;
what she meant to do. "We can easily set-&#xD;
tIe that point!" she said, opening it.&#xD;
Mr. Courten~ye was right. On the fly-leaf,&#xD;
Arthur Tyndale's name was written. "It is&#xD;
his!" said Mre. Sandford, with a thrill, as of&#xD;
exultation, in her voice. Then, somewhat to&#xD;
the surprise of the lookers-on, she coolly&#xD;
slipped the book into 1~er pocket. "I'll give&#xD;
it back to him, with a lecture on his careless-&#xD;
ness!" she said, with a laugh.&#xD;
Almost at the same moment that this&#xD;
scene was occurring on the lawn, Max met&#xD;
Leslie as she was emerging from the house.&#xD;
"Do you know where Arthur is?" he asked,&#xD;
stopping her. "I want to speak to him a&#xD;
moment."&#xD;
"No," she answered-and, as she turned&#xD;
her face toward him, he saw the look of pain&#xD;
in her eyes-" I have not seen Arthur since&#xD;
-scarcely since dinner."&#xD;
"Indeed!" said Max. He had seen noth-&#xD;
ing of Arthur himself; had known nothing&#xD;
of the mannerin which he was avoiding Les-&#xD;
lie, and he was naturally astonished by this&#xD;
information. Anger-quick, hot, overmaster-&#xD;
ing-rushed into his heart and into his eyes.&#xD;
It coat him a minute's effort before he could&#xD;
control its expression for the sake of the pa-&#xD;
thetic face before him. "He must have gone&#xD;
home," he said, then, with as much careless-&#xD;
ness as he could aSsume. "I don't think he&#xD;
has been exactly-very well to-day."&#xD;
"Has he not?" asked Leslie. Her eyes&#xD;

'b No t I this conflict longer will not wage,&#xD;
The conflict Duty claims-the giant task-&#xD;
Thy spells, 0 VIrtue, never can assuage&#xD;
The heart's wildfire-this oflTeringdo not ask?"&#xD;
IlAum an. liQur latet, Max Tyndale mounted'&#xD;
the terrace-steps at Strafford, and found him.&#xD;
self facing a stream of light. which issued&#xD;
from one of the. flower-wreathed windows of&#xD;
the dining-room. Wondering what, Arthur&#xD;
was doing in that particular room at that&#xD;
beur, he' walked wp to the window and looked&#xD;
in. A glance at the open sideboard, and one&#xD;
or tw~ decanters on the table, showed him at&#xD;
once what Arthur was. doii~g, and made him&#xD;
shrug his shoulders as he entered-stooping&#xD;
his tall head t little in order to do so. Hear-&#xD;
ing the step, Arthur turned-bc bad been&#xD;
sitting in a deep chair, with his back to the&#xD;
window-and,, seeing Max, be frowned imps-&#xD;
tiOntly.&#xD;
"Why the deuce cant you. come in. bythe&#xD;
door, and not startle one like this?" he said,.&#xD;
pettishly. "'Yen. are back early!"&#xD;
"Not so early as yourself," answered Max,.&#xD;
advancing and taking a scat on the other shie&#xD;
of the table. He. meant t.o keep his temper,&#xD;
if possible, let Arthur be as trying as he&#xD;
&#xD;
would, but already it felt inclined to give&#xD;
way.&#xD;
"I-oh, I could not stand it any longer I"&#xD;
said the latter, in an aggrieved tone. "It is&#xD;
too much to ask of a man to endure such a&#xD;
mob of stupid people for three or four hours&#xD;
on a stretch."&#xD;
"Some of the people were not stupid, how-&#xD;
ever," said Max. "There was Miss Grahame,&#xD;
for instance. I met her just before I left, and&#xD;
she seemed to feel your neglect. I should&#xD;
advise you to be a little more careful. She is&#xD;
not a woman to endure that kind of thing&#xD;
tamely."&#xD;
"It makes very little difference to me&#xD;
whether she is or not," said Arthur, dogged-&#xD;
ly.' "I am sick of the whole business, and I&#xD;
don't intend to put any further compulsion on&#xD;
myself! D-n it, Max, it isn't you who have&#xD;
had to'play the part of a shuttlecock between&#xD;
these two women!"&#xD;
"It is not I, certainly," said Max, gravely.&#xD;
lie looked at the other with his keen, dark.&#xD;
eyes, understanding perfectly the crimson&#xD;
flush on his cheeks, the bright glitter in his&#xD;
eyes. He saw that he had been drinking&#xD;
deeply, and he hesitated, asking himself it'&#xD;
there was any use in broaching the subject of&#xD;
the letters to him that night. But, like No-&#xD;
rab, he began to feel an impatience of the&#xD;
matter, a conviction that the sooner it was&#xD;
ended the better. Arthur might be sober&#xD;
enough to recognize his own interests, at&#xD;
least. On that hypothesis, he spoke:&#xD;
"I wanted to see you this afternoon," he&#xD;
said, "but you had left before I returned. If&#xD;
you had waited for me, you might have been&#xD;
glad to hear that Miss Desmond agrees to re-&#xD;
turn your letter's."&#xD;
"Does she?" said Arthur, starting. Deep-&#xD;
er color came into his cheeks, brighter light&#xD;
flashed into his, eyes. He had not expected&#xD;
such good news. It would be something, cer-&#xD;
tainly~-it would be a great deal, indeed-to&#xD;
be safely out of Norali Desmond's power.&#xD;
The next moment, however, he looked at his&#xD;
cousin suspiciously.&#xD;
'~ "Miss Elesmond is too shrewd a woman&#xD;
to surrender those letters without expecting&#xD;
something in return," he said. "What is&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"What any woman in her posit&amp;amp;cir has a&#xD;
right~ to expect and to 'demand," answered&#xD;
Max, growing stern in spil&amp;amp;or lihiis~.li~.: ~'*Ier&#xD;
own letters."&#xD;
&#xD;
MISS DESMOI4D&#xD;

"I told you that I bad not one of them-..&#xD;
that I never dreamed of keeping them."&#xD;
"I told her that;. and, if you assert the&#xD;
fact on your honor, she is willing to accept&#xD;
it,"~said Max, not without a grim sense of the&#xD;
satire involved in his words. "But "-and&#xD;
he leaned forward here to note the effect of&#xD;
what he had to say-" she is not sure, and&#xD;
neither am I, that you have not a letter of&#xD;
hers w1~ic1a was not addressed to you, in your&#xD;
possession.~~&#xD;
"What the devil do you mean ~" asked&#xD;
Arthur, angrily. He knew perfectly well&#xD;
what the other meant, but this question is&#xD;
every one's first expedient to gain time.&#xD;
"I fancy that you. know very well what I&#xD;
mean," answered Max, quietly. "I'~niean that&#xD;
I think you. have in your possession a letter&#xD;
of Miss Desmond's addressed to her sister,&#xD;
which you found on my table, among various&#xD;
other papers, the night-Thursday night-&#xD;
that you were in my room alone."&#xD;
"In your room alone!" repeated Arthur,&#xD;
wrathfully. "I never heard such insolence!&#xD;
Do you mean to insinuate that I have stolen&#xD;
your letter, or Miss Desmond's letter, or&#xD;
whoever letter it chanced to be?"&#xD;
"I have already told you that it was a let-&#xD;
ter addressed to Miss Desmond's sister, mid&#xD;
written by Miss Desmond herself~," answered&#xD;
Max. "I insinuate nothing; I merely ask if&#xD;
it is not in your possession."&#xD;
"And I reply emphatically that such a&#xD;
question is an insult, and that I decline to&#xD;
answer it."&#xD;
"Then, in that ease, I am en~poWered by&#xD;
Miss Desmond to say that she declines to sur-&#xD;
render your letters."&#xD;

&#xD;
what power does Miss Desmond imagine that&#xD;
she possesses over my actions, that she can&#xD;
lay down arbitrary conditions after such fash-&#xD;
ion as this?"&#xD;
"She does not imagine that she possesses&#xD;
any power,'but she clainis a right to name&#xD;
the conditions upon which she will surrender&#xD;
the letters you are anxious to obtain."&#xD;
"Not so anxious as you imagine, perhaps,"&#xD;
said the other, sneeringly. "I fancy I am&#xD;
safe enough from any use she may be tempted&#xD;
to make of those letters. No woman, with&#xD;
the instincts of a lady- and those, at least,&#xD;
Norah Desmond has-ever likes to proclaim&#xD;
herself jilted."&#xD;
"And how does a man, who ought to have&#xD;
the instincts of a gentleman, like to be branded&#xD;
with dishonor?" asked Max, shortly. A fire,&#xD;
not common to his eyes, gathered in them.&#xD;
The last shreds of his well-worn patience be.&#xD;
gan ti~ give way. "Let us make an end of&#xD;
this," he said, rising to his feet. "Once for&#xD;
all, will you accept ~the offer which Miss Des.&#xD;
mond makes, or will you force upon her the&#xD;
alternative of going to Miss Grahame with&#xD;
these letters in her hand?"&#xD;
"She may go to Miss Grahame or to the&#xD;
devil!" answered Arthur, with a defiance&#xD;
born of champagne and French brandy. "If&#xD;
I choose to make an efl~ort' to hold my own&#xD;
with Leslie, I do not anticipate any difficulty&#xD;
in doing so because a woman like Norab Des.&#xD;
mond brings forward some relics of an old&#xD;
folly. Her character, wherever she is known&#xD;
abroad, is so notorious, that her word will&#xD;
pass for very little when I once make Leslie&#xD;
clearly understand that she is, a mere Bohe.&#xD;
mian adventuress, a mere-"&#xD;
"Stop " said Max. ~n sudden, fiery in.&#xD;
tensity, the word was almost equivalent to a&#xD;
bloW. "I have heard enough of this. You&#xD;
are not defending yourself by slandering Miss&#xD;
Desmond-you are only proving how right I&#xD;
was when~,I told her that it was worse than&#xD;
folly to surrender the letters which prove the&#xD;
utter falsehood of every word you have ut.&#xD;
tered, or are likely to utter, concerning her!"&#xD;
"They may prove it to you," paid thur.&#xD;
"No doubt you have had ample 'opportunity&#xD;
for judging. But'you are right-this has gone&#xD;
fhr enough!" said he, springing suddenly to&#xD;
his feet, and speaking in a voice which was&#xD;
full of passion. "Even now, if you were not&#xD;
standing as a guest under my own roof-"&#xD;
"I shall not be a guest under your roof&#xD;
&#xD;
much longer," interrupted the other. "I ac.&#xD;
cept no obligation-least of all that of hos-&#xD;
pitality-from a man' whom I have ceased to&#xD;
hold in any respect, who has forfeited every&#xD;
characteristic of a man of honor!"&#xD;
"You will answer for this!" said Arthur,&#xD;
through his clinched teeth.&#xD;
"Answer for it ! - what is there to an.&#xD;
swer?" returned Max, contcnptuously. "Is&#xD;
it not true? Have you not been tried in the&#xD;
balance and found wanting in every instinct&#xD;
of honor, every regard for truth? God&#xD;
knows," said lie, with a sudden, passionate&#xD;
vehemence, "I trusted in yQu, believed in&#xD;
you, hoped in you, to the last! But after to.&#xD;
day I should be a fool indeed if I put further&#xD;
faith in you. ThereforO j go now to tell Miss&#xD;
Desmond the failure of my mission, and at&#xD;
daylight I shall leave your house."&#xD;
He moved toward the door as lie spoke,&#xD;
but Arthur made one stride and stood before&#xD;
him - a flame of coloi~ in his fair cheeks, a&#xD;
gleam of menacing light in his 'dolet eyes.&#xD;
"You are altogether wrong if you think&#xD;
you can insult inc like this, even in my own&#xD;
house,' with impunity!" he said. "You shall&#xD;
not leave this room until you have passed&#xD;
your word to give me the satisfaction of a&#xD;
gentleman."&#xD;
"I should as soon think of ghing satis.&#xD;
faction to my own brother - which, thank&#xD;
God! you are not!" was the response. "I&#xD;
have only spoken truths which your own con-&#xD;
science must echo, and I have spoken them&#xD;
because our intimate friendship and near kin-&#xD;
ship gave me a right to do so. It is a iight&#xD;
which I shall not claim again, however. I&#xD;
repeat that, after to-night, I am done with&#xD;
I you-done with you and your affairs utterly&#xD;
and forever! Now stand aside and let .me&#xD;
pass. This is child's play."&#xD;
"We'll make it something else, then!"&#xD;
said Arthur, between his set teeth. He took&#xD;
a 'step forward as he spoke - his purpose&#xD;
plainly to be read in his gleaming eyes, his&#xD;
knitted brows, and tight.set lips-but, though&#xD;
he was quick and lithe as a panther, the man&#xD;
who iuet him was like a rock. He extended&#xD;
his hand, seized the assailant by. the collar,&#xD;
and swung him out of his path, just as the&#xD;
door opened, and the face of a servant-first&#xD;
grave: and decorous as usual, then stricken&#xD;
with amazement-looked in.&#xD;
"I beg pardon, sir," he said, falling back&#xD;
a step or two as Max strode toward the door.&#xD;

ARTHUR INSULTED.                    163&#xD;
&#xD;
It is likely that he feared summary ejection;&#xD;
at all events, he retreated crab-fashion into the&#xD;
hail, as ~the young man advanced upon him.&#xD;
"What brought you here i"' demanded&#xD;
Captain Tyndale, sharply-pausing at last in&#xD;
the middle of the ball-" An ignorant servant&#xD;
might be excused, but you know better-you&#xD;
know that you have no business to enter a&#xD;
room unless you have been summoned."&#xD;
"I-I beg pardon, sir," repeated the man&#xD;
again-he was a well-trained English servant,&#xD;
whom Arthur had brought with him from&#xD;
abroad, and therefore, as Max said, could not&#xD;
plead ignorance for his shortcomings-" but&#xD;
I saw a light in the dining-room, and, not&#xD;
knowing that either of you gentlemen had&#xD;
come back, I thought I would just come and&#xD;
-and see what it was about."&#xD;
"You might have known that your master&#xD;
or myself must be there," said Max, unmolli-&#xD;
fled. "You ought to be aware that this kind&#xD;
of thing will not answer. A servant must&#xD;
learn to come only when he is bidden, and"&#xD;
(with emphasis) "to hold his tongue."&#xD;
"I think I know how to hold mine, sir,"&#xD;
said the man, respectfully.&#xD;
"It will be well for you if you do!" said&#xD;
Captain Tyndale, significantly. Then he turned&#xD;
away and walked toward the hall-door, which&#xD;
stood open to the dreamy beauty of the magi-&#xD;
cal moonlight. Before he reached it, how-&#xD;
ever, a thought seemed to strike him - he&#xD;
wheeled round again, and addressed the ser-&#xD;
vant, who was still lingering where he had&#xD;
been left.&#xD;
"Do you know what time the earliest&#xD;
train passes Wexford to-morrow morning for&#xD;
Alton "' he asked.&#xD;
"About half-past six, sir, I think," was&#xD;
the answer.&#xD;
"Tell Anderson, then, to have something&#xD;
at the door for me and my luggage about&#xD;
half-past five. I find that I am obliged to go&#xD;
up to the city." -&#xD;
"Very well, sir."&#xD;
"Half-past five, mind! I don't want to&#xD;
be leCt."~&#xD;
"I'll take care of that, sir."&#xD;
After Max passed out, the speaker shook&#xD;
his head solemnly.&#xD;
"There's been no end of a row 1" he&#xD;
said, half aloud. "It's no more than I ex-&#xD;
pected all the time. I never yet seen two&#xD;
gentlemen thicker than brothers but what L&#xD;
says to myself-"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Giles!" cried an irritable voice in the&#xD;
rear. "Giles, don't you hear? Why the&#xD;
devil don't you keep your ears about you,&#xD;
and come when you're called?"&#xD;
"I didn't know you had called before,&#xD;
sir," said Giles, turning round and facing&#xD;
his master, who was standing in the open&#xD;
dining-room door. Even to the servant it&#xD;
was plain, at a glance, how deeply he had&#xD;
been drinking, and it flashed through his&#xD;
mind fhat the "row" might not be so very&#xD;
serious after all.&#xD;
"You were too busy taking Captain Tyn.&#xD;
dale's orders to listen to me, I suppose," said&#xD;
Arthur, more angrily than before. "But I&#xD;
want you to understand that it is I who am&#xD;
master in this house, and not Captain Tyn.&#xD;
dale."&#xD;
"I know that, sir," said Giles.&#xD;
"What was he telling you to do ?-what&#xD;
was that order I heard him giving you?"&#xD;
"He told me to tell Anderson to have&#xD;
something at the door for him and his lug.&#xD;
gage at half-past five to-morrow morning; he&#xD;
wants to leave on the half-past six o'clock&#xD;
"He does, does he?" said Arthur, chang-&#xD;
ing color violently. "We'll see about that."&#xD;
"I'm not to tell Anderson, then, sir?"&#xD;
"D-n Anderson, and you too! Leave&#xD;
the house, this instant! and the next time&#xD;
you come where you are not called and not&#xD;
wanted, you'll leave it for good I"&#xD;
"Very well, sir," said Giles, sullenly.&#xD;
He felt strongly inclined to say, "I'll leave&#xD;
it now for good," but the thought of Ar.&#xD;
thur's usual kind, treatment, the light ser-&#xD;
vice, excellent wages, and more excellent per-&#xD;
quisites of his place, restrained thuis spirit of&#xD;
noble independence. He left the hall by the&#xD;
back-door, and, once out on the moonlit&#xD;
sward, relieved his mind by the use of vari-&#xD;
ous expletives of a forcible nature.&#xD;
Arthur, meanwhile, turned back into the&#xD;
dining - room, poured out half a glass of&#xD;
brandy, and drank it off. "We'll see about&#xD;
th~t!" he repeated, as he set the glass down&#xD;
with a ringing sound. A wild light scelned&#xD;
instantly to flame into his eyes. It was evi-&#xD;
dent that th'e brandy mounted to his brain&#xD;
like lightning. "If he thinks that he can&#xD;
treat me like this, insult me to my face, and&#xD;
then refuse me satisfaction, I will show him&#xD;
that he is mistaken!" he said, nodding with&#xD;
a truculent, drunkeil air to. the tall, flaring&#xD;

It was probably as a means of seeing&#xD;
about it that he went into the library, and,&#xD;
opening a drawer, took out a silver-mounted&#xD;
pistol-one of the small revolvers in such&#xD;
common and deadly use at present - and,&#xD;
having ascertained that it was loaded, slipped&#xD;
it into the breast-pocket of his coat. Thus&#xD;
equipped, with a fiery flush on his cheeks,&#xD;
and a fiery light in his eyes, he seized the&#xD;
first convenient hat which came to hand,&#xD;
stepped out into the moonlight, and, leaving&#xD;
the house all open, the library and dining-&#xD;
room all ablaze with light, behind him, took&#xD;
his way across the park, following the path&#xD;
which Max had followed fifteen or twenty&#xD;
minutes before:&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
"We two stood there with never a third,&#xD;
But each by each, as each knew well,&#xD;
The sights we saw and thesounds we heard,&#xD;
The lights and shades made up a spell&#xD;
Till the trouble grew and stirred.&#xD;
"Oh, the little more, and how much It Is!&#xD;
And the little les~. and. what worlds away I&#xD;
how a sound shall quicken content to bliss,&#xD;
Or a breath suspend the blood's best play,&#xD;
And lIfe be a proof of this I"&#xD;
Wnzx Oaptain Tyndale reached the bridge&#xD;
spanning the stream which divided the Straf-&#xD;
ford lands from the Rosland grounds, he hesi-&#xD;
tated a nioment, doubtful whether to turn&#xD;
aside to the sumxner.house, which was situ.&#xD;
ated at some. distance on his right, orto keep&#xD;
straight on to the villa. He was back sooner&#xD;
than he had aaticipated.-considerably In ad-&#xD;
vance, indeed, .of the time he had named to&#xD;
Norab Tht meeting him--and it was likely,&#xD;
therefore, that she had not 'yet come to the&#xD;
place of rendezvous. Therewere somt un-&#xD;
qaeatienablo advantages to he gained by see-&#xD;
iug her an the lawn or in the dra~whxg-rooxn&#xD;
-.~tha advantage, above all, of avoiding an&#xD;
&#xD;
interview which would excite much o~ ill-&#xD;
natured comment if it were suspected or din.&#xD;
covered, and from this comment Max, who&#xD;
knew his world better than Norah did, was&#xD;
anxious to shield her; but then there was the&#xD;
great disadvantage of not being able to speak&#xD;
freely, of not being secure from interruption&#xD;
or distraction. Besides this, if he went to&#xD;
the house and she were not there, it would&#xD;
excite a great deal of attention-in fact, be&#xD;
very "marked," if he left again abruptly in&#xD;
evident search of her. Again, he might not&#xD;
be able to leave abruptly. Max was an old&#xD;
'bird, who had been caught too often in so-&#xD;
ciety nets, not to be wary of them. He could&#xD;
imagine himself held captive while Mrs. Sand.&#xD;
ford or some other woman talked nonsense&#xD;
to him, and Norab waited alone in the sum-&#xD;
mer.house. Lastly-&#xD;
"View mortal man, none ever will you find,&#xD;
if the gods force him, that can shun his fate;"&#xD;
and Captain Tyndale being emphatically a&#xD;
mortal man, felt very little inclination to&#xD;
shun an interview alone with Korah..-his&#xD;
lust, just then it occurred to him-which the&#xD;
gods seemed determined to force upon him.&#xD;
After meditating duly upon all these con-&#xD;
siderations, he decided to go to the summer-&#xD;
house and wait for her. He glanced at his&#xD;
watch. It was a quarter-past eleven. He&#xD;
had told her that he would probably be there&#xD;
at half-past that hour. Again he hesitated.&#xD;
Should he go to the villa? There was still&#xD;
time enough, and a dozen words would be&#xD;
sufficient to tell her the result of his mission.&#xD;
But, then, it must be confessed that he felt&#xD;
strongly inclined for more than a dozen words.&#xD;
She was not in his style at all, and, after to-&#xD;
night, he would probably never see her again&#xD;
-but that was all the more reason for giving.&#xD;
his last looks time to linger on such a beauti-&#xD;
ful face, for letting his ears drink in again&#xD;
the sound of a voice sweet ~as that of the&#xD;
sirens. He turned with an air of decision,&#xD;
put his watch back into bin pocket, and en-&#xD;
tered the shrubbery to the right.&#xD;
Is it worth while to say that, if he had&#xD;
decided differcutly-'4f he had gene to seek&#xD;
Norah in thepresenceof thelarge and respect-&#xD;
able social gathering at Rosland-4he after-&#xD;
events~ which followed would have been very&#xD;
difThvent? Of what actioxi of our life might&#xD;

predicated? Yet the consequences whieb&#xD;

U&#xD;
&#xD;
A PUNCTUAL MEETiNG.&#xD;
&#xD;
less immediate and less unpleasant than those&#xD;
which followed this apparently trivial deci-&#xD;
sion of Max's-a decision born of the magic&#xD;
of a woman's fair face, as xnauy a man's de-&#xD;
cision has been before.&#xD;
When he reached the summer.housc, he&#xD;
found, as he had expected, that Norah had&#xD;
not yet arrived. This fact did not trouble&#xD;
him very much, however; she had not said,&#xD;
"I will come if possible," but she had said,&#xD;
"I will come!,' and instinct told him that&#xD;
what Norab Desmond premised would as-&#xD;
suredly be performed. Lighting a cigar,&#xD;
therefore, he sat down on the steps to wait&#xD;
for her. The balmy, voluptuous night was all&#xD;
around Ixim like a spell. In its white lustre&#xD;
every object stood out clear and distinct.&#xD;
The distant hills melted away in silvery mist;&#xD;
the woods, in their dark, shadowy beauty,&#xD;
stretched as far as the eye could reach. On&#xD;
the smooth sward around the summer-house,&#xD;
flecked delicately with leafy shadows, every&#xD;
dainty fay and sprite of the greenwood might&#xD;
have danced. A chorus of katydids sounded&#xD;
from the large oaks behind him. From the&#xD;
depths of the shrubbery in front rose sudden-&#xD;
ly the sweet, melodious voice of a tnocking-&#xD;
bird. Save these sounds, every thing was so&#xD;
still that the voice of the stream was distinct-&#xD;
ly audible, as it flowed along it~ hollow, sing-&#xD;
ing to itself iii the silent night.&#xD;
After a while he looked at his watch&#xD;
again. It was thirty minutes past eleven.&#xD;
"She will be here before long now t" he&#xD;
said to himself, and, as he said it, a white&#xD;
figure emerged from the shrubbery in the&#xD;
direction cC the house and advanced toward&#xD;
him.&#xD;
He threw away his cigar, and, rose as she&#xD;
approached, conscious of a strange sensation&#xD;
of pleasure which he did not stop to analyze,&#xD;
lint which was quite apart from the "busi-&#xD;
ness" end that he had in view.&#xD;
"1 am so exactly on time," she said; as&#xD;
she came up, "that I thought it likely I&#xD;
should have to wait for you."&#xD;
"Qa the contrary, I have been Waititig ftn~&#xD;
yOU for a quarter of an hour."&#xD;
"Is i6 possible? But that was your own&#xD;
fault, Punctuality does not mean being be-&#xD;
fore one's time any more than after one's. time,&#xD;
it means being on it~~4a~ tam."&#xD;
"I did not mean to claim the vittue of&#xD;
punetuality~-..thaa certainly belongs to you; I&#xD;
only meant I was glad anynecessary share&#xD;
&#xD;
of waiting should have fallen to my lot in-.&#xD;
stead or to yours. This would be an uncanny&#xD;
place, as the Scotch say, in which to be eJone&#xD;
at midnight!"&#xD;
"Why? because it is lonely? I should&#xD;
not be afraid of that. Mem are not likely to&#xD;
oome here, I suppose, unless by appointment;&#xD;
and, if the ghost of a Dutchman appeared, I&#xD;
should make the sign of the cross, and ex-&#xD;
pect to see him vanish in blue smoke."&#xD;
" There might be more unpleasant visitors&#xD;
than the ghost of a Dutchman. But will you&#xD;
come into the summer-house, or shall we&#xD;
"Here, by all means. One cannot have&#xD;
too much of such a night as this."&#xD;
"It is beautiful, certainly," said Max, but&#xD;
he was not thinking of the night as he spoke.&#xD;
He was thinking rather of the woman who,&#xD;
gain as the night, sat. down on the steps frorki&#xD;
which hehad risen, and looked up at him with&#xD;
a smile.&#xD;
"Does it not make you think of Loreuzo&#xD;
and Jessica? '~ she asked; and, before he&#xD;
could answer, she began to repeat:&#xD;
"'The moon shines bright. In such a night as&#xD;
this,&#xD;
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees,&#xD;
And they did make anolse,-ln such a night&#xD;

with a laugh, "if I had not been very stout&#xD;

with year cigar glowing likean angry eye."&#xD;
"1 scarcely fancied you would have seen&#xD;
it in such a lustrousatmosphere as this. But&#xD;
i(Ilooked like t Cyclops~ you certainly&#xD;
looked like the incarnate spirit of the moon-&#xD;
light as you came across the sward."&#xD;
"I ant not ethereal enough to look like&#xD;
an incarnate spirit of any thing'," said she,&#xD;
glancing up again, the n~eonIight shining on&#xD;
th(i match1e~s lines of her fkee,. the tran-&#xD;
scendent faIrness of her skin, the liqtxid ,soft~&#xD;

156                      A DAUGhTER&#xD;
heightened her loveliness. The young man&#xD;
caught his breath, Impassive though he was,&#xD;
he felt his pulses thrilling and his brain&#xD;
whirling a little. Not a woman in his style,&#xD;
not a woman whom he admired, but still a&#xD;
woman whose equal in abstract beauty he&#xD;
could scarcely hope* ever to see again - a&#xD;
woman at whose feet a man might almost~&#xD;
have been pardoned for falling down in abso-&#xD;
lute worship as she sat there with the silver&#xD;
night about her like a benediction, and all&#xD;
Nature wrapped in stillness. "What fools&#xD;
some men would make of themselves if they&#xD;
were in my position!" Max thought, with an&#xD;
agre~abIe sense of superior wisdom, which he&#xD;
immediately justified by plunging into the&#xD;
business that had brought them there. After&#xD;
all, what was Norah Desmond's beauty to&#xD;
him? A. soldier with little or nothing be-&#xD;
sides his pay could not ttfford to fall in love&#xD;
with the penniless daughter of a Bohemian&#xD;
adventurer, if she were a second Helen.&#xD;
"I have just come from Arthur," he said,&#xD;
abruptly. "I am sorry to say-sorry, at least,&#xD;
on your account, that he refuses absolutely to&#xD;
accede to your demand about the letters."&#xD;
"Indeed!" said she, starting-an expres-&#xD;
skin like a wave of surprise sweeping over&#xD;
her face. "Does he deny, then, that he has&#xD;
theletter which I wish returned?"&#xD;
"No; he professes himself insulted by the&#xD;
charge, and will neither deny nor acknowledge&#xD;
any thing concerning ik"&#xD;
"Do you not think that is equivalent to&#xD;
owning that he has the letter?"&#xD;
"I do not 'think' so; I am sure of&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"And equivalent, alsQ, to refusing it?"&#xD;
"Equivalent to that, also."&#xD;
"I did not expect this in the least," said&#xD;
she, after a minute's pause. "I thought he&#xD;
would have been more than willing to buy&#xD;
his letters back at such a price. What is the&#xD;
meaning of it, Captain Tyndale? He must&#xD;
be anxious to obtain them, while that letter&#xD;
has no value to him It tells him nothing&#xD;
which he did not know before, or which he&#xD;
could by any possibility desire to use."&#xD;
"I must confess," said Max, reluctantly,&#xD;
"that he was not at all sober, which may&#xD;
have had something to do with his foolish&#xD;
obstinacy. But you must forgive me if I&#xD;
say it is a good thing, Miss Desmond. More&#xD;
clearly than before-if that be possible-do&#xD;

'he, energetically, "have you a right to throw&#xD;

your possession. Believe me, I mean what I&#xD;
say. Arthur Tyndale is not a man to he&#xD;
trusted. Even you do not know how far he&#xD;
has gone in dishonor-how little he would&#xD;
hesitate over any falsity!"&#xD;
"Has he been uttering any fresh slander&#xD;
about me?" demanded she, with eyes that&#xD;
began to glow, and lips apart. "If so, don't&#xD;
hesitate-tell me at once what it was."&#xD;
"He only insinuates slander at present,"&#xD;
answered Max, dryly. "He will wait to do&#xD;
more until he has the letters safely in his&#xD;
hands."&#xD;
"But he cannot be anxious to obtain&#xD;
them, since he does not even think them&#xD;
worth a blurred fragment like my letter to&#xD;
Kate."&#xD;
"I have told you that he was not sober;&#xD;
I may add that he worked himself into a&#xD;
violent rage, which ended in his demanding&#xD;
'satisfaction~ of me, and refusing absolutely&#xD;
to entertain any of your proposals."&#xD;
"How little I expected this!" she re-&#xD;
peated. "I was so sure you would have been&#xD;
successful, that I brought the letters with&#xD;
me. See I "-she drew a package from her&#xD;
pocket and held it in the palm of one hand,&#xD;
looking meditatively at it-" Here they are-&#xD;
so many ounces of passionate devotion, love,&#xD;
trust, faith, etcetera! Is it any wonder I am&#xD;
willing to dispose of them-that is the mer-&#xD;
cantile phrase, isn't it ?-to the original own-&#xD;
er, very cheaply indeed?"&#xD;
"I can imagine that they arc valueless&#xD;
to you; but, nevertheless, you should keep&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"What will you wager, that, when be is&#xD;
sober, he will be willing to give all that I ask,&#xD;
and more besides, to obtain them?"&#xD;
"Very likely; but nothing should induce&#xD;
you to accept any thing which he offers. He&#xD;
will respect no pledge an hour longer than he&#xD;
cares to do so. Remember, that is my last&#xD;
caution to you."&#xD;
She looked up with an inquisitive glance.&#xD;
"What do you mean by that? Why&#xD;
should it be your 'last?"'&#xD;
"Because I am going away to-morrow&#xD;
morning," he answered-not unwilling, per-&#xD;
haps, to note the effect of such a sudden an-&#xD;
nouncement on her.&#xD;
&#xD;
The effect-as much, at least, as he saw&#xD;
of it-was only astonishment, mingled some-&#xD;
what with regret.&#xD;
"You are going away!" she repeated,&#xD;
after a short pause. "And to-morrow morn-&#xD;
ing! How sudden! Will you think that I&#xD;
speak only from interested motives if I say&#xD;
that I am sorry? I really am."&#xD;
"You nrc very kind!" he muttered-dis-&#xD;
appointed byher self-possession, though he&#xD;
had not the faintest reason for expecting any&#xD;
thing else.&#xD;
"I think it is you who have been kind,"&#xD;
she said, after another pause - "you who&#xD;
have taken so much trouble and annoyance&#xD;
upon yourself without any hope of reward;&#xD;
and now-"&#xD;
"How do you know that it was without&#xD;
hope of reward?" he said as she broke off&#xD;
abruptly-only hcr eyes supplying the words&#xD;
unsaid-" how do you know that I have not&#xD;
been rewarded already? To be honored by&#xD;
your confidence and your presence would re-&#xD;
pay much more than I have done."&#xD;
"Do you think so?" asked she, laughing&#xD;
-but the laugh, instead of being the little&#xD;
tinkle of gratified vanity which Max knew so&#xD;
well, had a bitter, jarring sound in it. "You&#xD;
surely 'do not know how easily such honor&#xD;
can be obtained-in Bohemia, Captain Tyn-&#xD;
dale."&#xD;
"Why are you so un.fusc to yourself?"&#xD;
said he, angrily. "You know better than&#xD;
that! You know that neither in Bohemia&#xD;
nor out of it is such honor easily obtained&#xD;
from a woman as proud as you are, Miss Des-&#xD;
mond."&#xD;
"And pray," demanded she-flushing so&#xD;
suddenly and deeply that he saw the suffusion&#xD;
even in the white moonlight-" what right&#xD;
have you to suppose that I have given you&#xD;
more than 1 should have given any other man&#xD;
who crossed my path?"&#xD;
"Don't be angry," said he, smiling; "and&#xD;
don't think me presumptuous before I deserve&#xD;
it. I have never for a moment imagined&#xD;
that it was any merit of my own which has&#xD;
won for me the confidence you have given me&#xD;
-the confidence which you certainly would&#xD;
not give 'any man who crossed your path '-&#xD;
but only the singular circumstances which&#xD;
have thrown us together, aud made us know&#xD;
each other very well even in the course of one&#xD;
short week."&#xD;
"A great deal can be done, thought, felt,&#xD;
&#xD;
157&#xD;
&#xD;
and said, in a week," said she, half dreamily,&#xD;
looking, not at him, but at the melting line&#xD;
of moonlit hills far away. "But, when you&#xD;
speak of knowing me," she added, with an-&#xD;
other low, bitter laugh, "you are talking ab-&#xD;
solute nonsense. I have a hundred charac-&#xD;
ters: you have seen only one."&#xD;
"But in that one lies the key to all the&#xD;
rest," said he.&#xD;
She shook her head, half sadly.&#xD;
"I am not a book, to be read at sight,"&#xD;
she said. "Sometimes I think that I am writ-&#xD;
ten in cipher, even to myself."&#xD;
"You are a book, to make and to repay&#xD;
the study of a man's life!" said Max. He&#xD;
knew that he was a fool when he uttered the&#xD;
words; but, just then, his senses were be-&#xD;
witched. That fair face, with the moonlight&#xD;
shining on it, might have made wild havoc&#xD;
with any man's senses.&#xD;
But Norah only smiled: she was too well&#xD;
used to such speeches and such tones to give&#xD;
them any significance beyond the amusement&#xD;
of the hour.&#xD;
"How good of you to think so!" said she.&#xD;
"But my character is nothing to you," she&#xD;
added, with a sudden flash of impatient anger.&#xD;
"Why are we discussing it? I came here to&#xD;
speak of your cousin and Leslie. Let us talk&#xD;
of them."&#xD;
"How do you know that your character is&#xD;
nothing to me?" demanded Max, in turn-&#xD;
ignoring her last command-and with a curi-&#xD;
ous, vibrating thrill in his voice, born of folly,&#xD;
madness, moonlight, Heaven only knows what.&#xD;
"How can you tell but that "&#xD;
It is impossible for any one to tell what&#xD;
he might have uttered hext, if, at that mo-&#xD;
ment, a pistol-shot had not rung out clearly&#xD;
on the still night-air, making them both start&#xD;
and gaze at each other with amazed, interrog-&#xD;
ative eyes.&#xD;
Norah was the first to break the pause&#xD;
which ensued.                (&#xD;
"What can it mean?" she sar&amp;amp;-" and so&#xD;
Sicar at hand, too!"&#xD;
"I don't understand it at all," s5id Max.&#xD;
He thought of Arthur. But, even if Arthur&#xD;
had left Strafford and followed him-which&#xD;
he did not conceive to be at all likely-at&#xD;
whom could he be firing? "That shot was&#xD;
certainly fired within the grounds;" he said,&#xD;
rising to his feet. "If you will excuse me,&#xD;
Miss Desmond, I will soon see-"&#xD;
"Do you mean that you are going away'&#xD;

158&#xD;
&#xD;
A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMiA.&#xD;
&#xD;
and leave me here?" said Norah, quietly-&#xD;
and her tone stopped him more effectually&#xD;
than a dozen screams could have done-"!&#xD;
should ~not have been afraid to be alone be-&#xD;
Core, but now-."&#xD;
"True," said he, quickly. "I forgot.&#xD;
While I went in one direction, the shooter,&#xD;
or shooters, might come in this. After all,&#xD;
perhaps it may be only one of the negroes,&#xD;
who is amusing himself' with a pistol. It&#xD;
cannot be a nocturnal duel, for there was only&#xD;
one shot, and it does not seem that there is&#xD;
to be another."&#xD;
"From what direction did it seem to you&#xD;
that the sound came?" asked she.&#xD;
He pointed in the direction of the stream&#xD;
and the bridge. "There?" he answered,&#xD;
briefly.&#xD;
"So I thought," she said. Then, after a&#xD;
short pause, she added, in a quick, nervous&#xD;
~voice: "Do you think it could have been Mr.&#xD;
Tyndale?"&#xD;
"Impossible. At whom, or at what, could&#xD;
he have been firing?"&#xD;
There was silence after this for two or&#xD;
three miau~tes~ They both listened attentive-&#xD;
ly, but no other r~pox't followed-the' katy~&#xD;
dids, the gra~shoppers, the crickets, and the&#xD;
mocking-birds, had all the night to them-&#xD;
selves. Then Norah laughed a little-a laugh&#xD;
relieved, but somewhat nervous still.&#xD;
"It was queer," she said; "b~$ it could&#xD;
not have been any thing serious, since no&#xD;
other shot has followed."&#xD;
"I suppose not," said Max; but he spoke&#xD;
slowly-somehow, he had an instinct that it&#xD;
karl been something serious,; and 'that he&#xD;
would have done well to have followed his.&#xD;
£1~st impulse, and gone to see about it; but,&#xD;
'then, how could he leave Norah alone? He&#xD;
might not have hesitated so much on this,&#xD;
score if he had only known how little Norah&#xD;
felt any fear for herself, how entirely her&#xD;
whole assumption of it had been for him, in&#xD;
order that he might not be drawn into a trap&#xD;
and shot down, perhaps-she did not stop to&#xD;
ask herself by'whom. Night breeds fantastic&#xD;
fears even in the bravest heart, and braver&#xD;
breast than that of this Bohemian girl one&#xD;
seldom meets.&#xD;
After another minute, she spoke again:&#xD;
"I believe there is only one thing more to&#xD;
be said: since your cousin refuses my terms,&#xD;
I shall keep these letters; and, since you are&#xD;
going away, I must decide at once whether or&#xD;
&#xD;
not to show them to Leslie. What do you&#xD;
advise me to do? Tell me, and-perhaps----I&#xD;
may do it."&#xD;
"flow encouraging!" said he, with a&#xD;
smile "But, in truth, I scarcely know what&#xD;
to tell you-.-4 have lost all confidence in my&#xD;
own judgment." 'lie did not add that he had&#xD;
lost all interest in the subject under discus-&#xD;
sion. Even his Platonic devotion to Leslie&#xD;
bud faded away like "snow-wreath in thaw."&#xD;
He knew that the interruptio~i of the pistol-&#xD;
shot had only just come in time to save him&#xD;
from making ~ ~onsisznmate 'foOl of himself-&#xD;
and yet the temptation to do so rertsained as&#xD;
great as before the interruption. But it can&#xD;
at least be said for Max that he was a man of&#xD;
honor: he knew that he could not afford to&#xD;
'marry Norah Desmond, even if she were will-&#xD;
ing to marry him; therefore he knew, also,&#xD;
that he had no right to utter one word of the&#xD;
madness which had suddenly come upon him&#xD;
like a flood.&#xD;
"You have not even confidence enough in&#xD;
your own judgment to advise me whether or&#xD;
n~t to let mattes-s take. theb~ Course, or to tell&#xD;
the truth to Leslie without delay?" asked&#xD;
she, looking at him curiously.&#xD;
"I cannot even tell 'you that," he an-&#xD;
swered, desperately ~ You must judge for&#xD;
yourself. I am done 'with the whole affair.&#xD;
I told Arthur that to-night. My diplomatic&#xD;
career has been little besides a succession of&#xD;
blunders. It is a good thing that it is draw-&#xD;
ing to a close."&#xD;
"And you are going away to - morrow&#xD;
morning?"&#xD;
"Yes, I am going away to-morrow morn-&#xD;
ing, at half-past siZ o'clock. This 'mCst be&#xD;
our good-by, therefore, and-and you must&#xD;
let me thank you, Miss Desmond."&#xD;
"Thank me !-for what?"&#xD;
"For having trusted me as you have done,&#xD;
and for having so kindly overlooked the pre-&#xD;
judice with which I met you first."&#xD;
"I knew whom to credit with that," said&#xD;
she. "~For the rest, you have treated me&#xD;
with a courtesy and respect for which I owe&#xD;
~ios thanks-'---I believe I have told you that&#xD;
before. And now," said she, turning to him&#xD;
with a smile which dazzled and bewildered&#xD;
him both at once, "when are we to meet&#xD;
again?"&#xD;
"When?" repeated he, catching his&#xD;
breath shortly. "Heaven only knows. Nev~&#xD;
er, perhaps!"&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SEPARATION-.&#xD;
&#xD;
159&#xD;
&#xD;
"You mean, then, that if you were to see&#xD;
me again across the opera - house, in Paris,-&#xD;
you would not even bow to me?"&#xD;
"I mean that, if I were wise, in such a&#xD;
case I would go my way without recalling&#xD;
myself to the memory of one who will prob-&#xD;
ably by that time have forgotten all about&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"'It is very probable, indeed, that I shall&#xD;
have forgotten all about you," said she, "for&#xD;
I do forget people very soon; but still, you&#xD;
know, you could recall yourself to my mem-&#xD;
ory, and we could shake' hands, say 'How-&#xD;
d'ye~do?' and think of-to-night."&#xD;
"Perhaps the best thing for me to do will&#xD;
be to try and forget to-night," said he, slow-&#xD;
ly. Now, as ever, she puzzled him. He&#xD;
could not tell whether she were trifling with,&#xD;
tempting, or mocking, him. He only felt&#xD;
that tkis was a scene and a time to hold in'&#xD;
remembrance while life should last. The&#xD;
majestic silence of midnight was upon the&#xD;
earth. The moon had reached mid-heaven,&#xD;
end was looking serenely down upon them;&#xD;
the shadows were small as those of noonday,&#xD;
while over plain and hill and river, over the&#xD;
lawn where the croquet hoops and mallets&#xD;
were lying, over the woods full of the sweet&#xD;
tinkle of distant waters and the soft hum of&#xD;
insect - life, the marvelous silver radiance&#xD;
rested. They were all alone-entirely alone&#xD;
-with only the night and the moon to be&#xD;
witness to whatever they might utter-the&#xD;
night and the moon, which have seen and&#xD;
heard so much of human folly as well as of&#xD;
human crime.&#xD;
But Max was resolved that it should wit-&#xD;
ness no further 'folly of his. He suddenly&#xD;
turned and held out his hand, speaking a lit-&#xD;
tie hoarsely. "Good-by!" he said.&#xD;
"~Good-by 1" she echoed, almost coldly,&#xD;
but she laid her slender, white hand in his.&#xD;
It was the first time that their hands had met&#xD;
since the day when he had clasped hers; all&#xD;
wet and gleaming, in the boat. That recol-&#xD;
lection came back to both of them. Their&#xD;
eyes suddenly met. There was a thrill in&#xD;
look as well as in touch. "Remember that&#xD;
I kept my pledge, at least," she said, smiling&#xD;
faintly. "I may be fast, mercenary, Bohe-&#xD;
mian-every thing that y6u most dislike-&#xD;
but don't forget that I kept faith as far as I&#xD;
could!"&#xD;
"I shall never forget it!" said he. And&#xD;
then the mooii saw some of the old, old folly.&#xD;
&#xD;
All of our impassive ckasseur's resolution&#xD;
melted like wax exposed to steady flame. He&#xD;
lifted the hand which he held to his lip~, he&#xD;
murmured words which wisdom would never&#xD;
have sanctioned. It was only the abrupt&#xD;
movement with which Norab drew back that&#xD;
brought him, in a measure, to himself.&#xD;
"Stop, Captain Tyndale," she said, "and&#xD;
listen to me. I am sorry we could not have&#xD;
parted without this. I am sorry that I can-&#xD;
not think that one man holds me in sufficient&#xD;
respect to treat me as he would treat the&#xD;
women of his own class. Do you think I&#xD;
have not seen, for an hour past, that, what&#xD;
with the night, and the moonlight, and my&#xD;
pretty face, I might have fooled you to the&#xD;
top of your bent?" asked she, with a certain&#xD;
scornful indignation. "But I wanted for&#xD;
once to see if some one could not know me&#xD;
and like me, and-and not try to amuse his&#xD;
idle hours by flirting with me! I find, how-&#xD;
ever, that this is too much to expect. I am&#xD;
flirting material or I am nothing. I like you&#xD;
well enough to prefer to be nothing to you-&#xD;
therefore good-night. Perhaps it is as well&#xD;
that you are going to-morrow."&#xD;
"Norah - Miss Desmond- for heaven's&#xD;
sake, listen to me!" he cried.&#xD;
But, snatching her hand from him, she&#xD;
turned with a gesture of almost passionate&#xD;
pride.&#xD;
"You would never have spoken to Leslie&#xD;
like this!" she said. "After all, you are&#xD;
alike-you and your cousin. You both think&#xD;
that I am for one use and she is for another!&#xD;
No doubt you are right enough, too," she&#xD;
added, with a sudden return to calmness.&#xD;
"No doubt, also, I shall grow used to my&#xD;
position in life after a while. I have not&#xD;
learned to do so as yet; but, then1 I am&#xD;
young-at least, I ought to be. Good-night&#xD;
again, Captain Tyndale. I hope you will&#xD;
have a pleasant journey and a safe arrival&#xD;
wherever you are going."&#xD;
"You will not leave me like this!" said&#xD;
he, imploringly.&#xD;
But, before the last words left his lips,&#xD;
she had drawn her shawl closer around her&#xD;
llgureund passed so lightly and swiftly across&#xD;
the mootilit award that he saw in a mo~nent&#xD;
it was hopeless to follow her.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
"There are sorrows&#xD;
Where of necessity the soul must be&#xD;
I~s own support. A strong heart will rely&#xD;
On its own strength alone."&#xD;
Ar~za the last guest was gone, and the&#xD;
last good-night exchanged, Leslie went to her&#xD;
chamber with a lagging step. It was much&#xD;
more than mere weariness which weighed&#xD;
upon her: it was a terrible soreness of heart,&#xD;
an unutterable sickness of soul, which it is no&#xD;
more possible to grasp and embody in words&#xD;
than it would be possible to paint a death-&#xD;
agony on canvas. All that she had endured&#xD;
during the day seemed but a faint prelude to&#xD;
the anguish which had possessed her, which&#xD;
shehad bravelyborne and as bravely concealed&#xD;
during the long hours of the evening. Such&#xD;
hours it has fallen to the lot of most women&#xD;
to endure once or twice in life; but time&#xD;
dulls the memory of all things, and only those&#xD;
to whom such pangs are fresh can realize&#xD;
what Leslie endured as she went among her&#xD;
guests with a smiling face,, talking, laughing,&#xD;
uttering the light nothings of society, while&#xD;
pala and doubt, suspicion and jealousy, were&#xD;
gnawing, like the traditional fox of the Spar.&#xD;
tan boy, at her heart. But no one-save, in-&#xD;
deed, Max Tyndale-suspected any thing of&#xD;
this from her face or manner. Is it the au-&#xD;
thor of" Guy Livingstone" who says that it is&#xD;
chiefly in the power to endure that good blood&#xD;
shows itself in these later days of ours? Who-&#xD;
ever~ said it, it is true enough-especially of&#xD;
women like Leslie Grahame. She was thor-&#xD;
ough-bred, not only in blood, but in instinct&#xD;
-not so invariably as we fancy, perhaps, do&#xD;
the two things go together-and there was&#xD;
in~ her the stuff of which martyrs are made,&#xD;
as well as the high-bred reserve, the supreme&#xD;
pride which shrinks from displaying an inner&#xD;
feeling, in a manner which a lower nature lit-&#xD;
erally fails to understand. Leslie could have&#xD;
died sooner than made a sign which would&#xD;
betray, even to the aunt who had been a&#xD;
mother to her, all that she was suffering.&#xD;
After the guests left, she still wore her sniil-&#xD;
ing mask until she parted with the last mem-&#xD;
ber of the household. Then she went to her&#xD;
room where her maid was waiting, restrained&#xD;
an inclination to dismiss the latter at once-&#xD;
knowing that such a proceeding would excite&#xD;
great deal of domestic i'emark-went through&#xD;
&#xD;
all the duties of the toilet as usual, and it&#xD;
was only when every thing was finished, and&#xD;
she was at last alone, that she sank into a&#xD;
chair and buried her face on the cold marble&#xD;
of the toilet-table with a low, pathetic moan.&#xD;
Then the dark waters came surging over&#xD;
her, wave on wave. Her pain was all the&#xD;
more bitter for the mystery which seemed to&#xD;
encompass it. Who was to blame? What&#xD;
had happened? Why wa~ she alone ignorant&#xD;
of what every one else seemed to know?&#xD;
Hard questions, these - questions which it&#xD;
was impossible to answer, though they rose&#xD;
again and again in her troubled mind. Of&#xD;
course the doubt and mystery were dwarfed&#xD;
by the terrible certainty-a certainty borne&#xD;
in upon her with a force which even the most&#xD;
foolish of blindly-foolish women could not&#xD;
have disregarded - of Arthur's alienation;&#xD;
but they were too closely connected with this&#xD;
to be banished altogether. The love which&#xD;
she had leaned upon as a stuff which was to&#xD;
last through life, had broken-cruelly broken&#xD;
-under her hand; but, in the blank bewil-&#xD;
derment of pain which ensued, she was still&#xD;
able to remember all the innuendo which had&#xD;
gone before, still able to ask, "What does it&#xD;
mean?" Round and round this treadmill of&#xD;
hopeless thought her brain went, until she al-&#xD;
most felt as if she should go mad if some&#xD;
light were not thrown upon the subject, if&#xD;
some elucidation of the mystery did not come.&#xD;
But it was characteristic of the woman&#xD;
that she never for an instant thought of seek-&#xD;
ing this light or this elucidation. Although&#xD;
aware that there were two people within a&#xD;
stone's-throw of her room who probably pos-&#xD;
sessed the key which she lacked-who, at&#xD;
least, had spoken as if they did-she never&#xD;
stirred or dreamed of stirring to demand it of&#xD;
them. It was not in her nature to do such a&#xD;
thing. If the explanation came to her, she&#xD;
would receive it, provided always that it came&#xD;
openly and honorably; but to solicit it was&#xD;
something which never occurred to her. So&#xD;
she sat motionless, her hot brow on the mar-&#xD;
ble slab, her hot hands clasped in her lep,&#xD;
while the night wore on toward midnight,&#xD;
and the last sound or movement died away&#xD;
in the house.&#xD;
She was still sitting in this fashion, and&#xD;
beginning to wonder if the sick pain which&#xD;
seemed to pervade every faculty of her body,&#xD;
mind, and spirit, would ever merge into the&#xD;
* blessed unconsciousness of sleep, when a&#xD;
&#xD;
knock sounded on her door, a subdued, hesi-&#xD;
tating, insinuating tap. Instantly she raised&#xD;
her head, her nerves strung like tense cords,&#xD;
her heart beating as if it would stifle her. "It&#xD;
has come!" That was what instinct said to&#xD;
her; that was what held her for a moment&#xD;
absolutely speechless; that was what cost&#xD;
her a sharp struggle before she was able&#xD;
to command her voice and say, "Come&#xD;
in,"&#xD;
Then the door slowly opened, and, instead&#xD;
of Norah - whom she had hoped and yet&#xD;
dreaded to see-Mrs. Sandford appeared.&#xD;
"I am so glad to find you are not in bed l"&#xD;
that lady said, advancing into the room, and'&#xD;
closing the door with elaborate caution be-&#xD;
hind her. "I should have been so sorry to&#xD;
disturb you-and yet, I could not have made&#xD;
up my mind to wait until to-morrow. "0 my&#xD;
dearest! "-suddenly clasping the passive&#xD;
form of the girl in a gushing embrace-" I&#xD;
hope you have resolution to bear a tesrible,&#xD;
terrible blow,* and I hope you will forgive me&#xD;
for being the bearer of it. I would do any&#xD;
thing in the world to spare you pain; but, to&#xD;
deceive you-to stand by and see you de-&#xD;
ceived-oh, my darling Leslie, ask yourself&#xD;
if I should be indeed your friend if I could&#xD;
do that?&#xD;
"Will you not sit down?" said Leslie,&#xD;
disengaging herself; and drawing a chair for-&#xD;
ward. At that moment pride made her nerves&#xD;
as firm as steel. She even smiled at the self-&#xD;
important, anxious look with which the other&#xD;
was regarding her. "You are very kind to&#xD;
come at such an unseasonable hour," she&#xD;
said, quietly, "if, as I imagine, you are here&#xD;
on my account.' But, if you will say what&#xD;
you have to say at once, it will be better for&#xD;
both of us."&#xD;
"It is impossible for me to tell you what&#xD;
a struggle it has cost me to come l" said Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford, sitting down and putting her hand-&#xD;
kerchief to her eyes. "I simply had to force&#xD;
myself, and nothing but my great friendship&#xD;
and love for you, Leslie-"&#xD;
"Yes," said Leslie, with a cadence of&#xD;
weary impatience in her voice. She felt as&#xD;
if she could not bear these 'false platitudes.&#xD;
If the woman would speak out, if she would&#xD;
only say what she had come to say, that was&#xD;
all she desired. "What terrible blow is it&#xD;
that you are the bearer of?" she asked,&#xD;
standing bythe toilet-table erect and stately,&#xD;
the shadowy glass imaging her slender figure,&#xD;

&#xD;
her pale, lovely~ face, her soft, brown hair,&#xD;
hanging loose. Save that there was nothing&#xD;
wan or melancholy in her aspect, she might&#xD;
have stood for Ophelia.&#xD;
"Oh, my dear, I scarcely know how to tell&#xD;
you!" said Mrs. Sandford. This was strictly&#xD;
true. With her story on her tongue, and the&#xD;
proofs of her story in her hand, a sudden,&#xD;
strange embarrassment came over her. For&#xD;
one thing, she had not counted upon being&#xD;
met by so much self~posaession and reticence.&#xD;
She had pictured a passionate, weeping gii-l,&#xD;
whom she could kiss and soothe and lead as&#xD;
she liked.&#xD;
"It does not matter in the least how you&#xD;
tell me," said Leslie-and through her usual-&#xD;
ly gentle voice 'a jarring chord rang-" so&#xD;
that you do tell me. Suspense is worse than&#xD;
any blow. You ought to know that. Come&#xD;
to the point at once! Tell me whom your&#xD;
story-I see that you have a story-concerns&#xD;
besides myself."&#xD;
"It concerns Miss Desmond and Mr. Tyn.&#xD;
dale!" said Mrs. Sandford, sharply. "Leslie,&#xD;
it is impossible !-you must have seen, you&#xD;
must have suspected, something between&#xD;
them!"&#xD;
"Seen !-suspected!" said Leslie-she&#xD;
threw her head back haughtily. "What do&#xD;
you take me for? How could I suspect my&#xD;
sister and-and the man whom I had prom-&#xD;
ised to marry? Take care, Mrs. Sandford I"&#xD;
-no one who had not seen it would have be-&#xD;
lieved what fire could gather in those soft,&#xD;
gray eyes-" unless you are very sure of what&#xD;
you are\saying, this subject had better end&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"But I am sure!" cried Mrs. Sandford.&#xD;
Her blood was up now. She had made the&#xD;
plunge, and the rest was easy enough. "I&#xD;
suspected, from the first,, that Miss Desmond&#xD;
and Mr. Tyndale were not such new acquaint-&#xD;
ances as they professed to be-as you, poor&#xD;
darling I took them to be-and now I find&#xD;
out that I am right," she said, with energy.&#xD;
"Leslie, they knew each other long ago-they&#xD;
had a love-affair with' each other long ago in&#xD;
Europe. You wrote to this girl about your&#xD;
engagement-she came here at once to break&#xD;
it off, and to draw Arthur Tyndale back to&#xD;
herself. This I know. I overheard a love-&#xD;
scene between them on the terrace at Straf-&#xD;
ford the day we were all there, and I should&#xD;
have told 'you then, only I had no proof, and&#xD;
I knew they might deny every thing. Last&#xD;

162                      A DAUGHTER&#xD;
night I SSW Mr. Tyndale give Miss Dearnond a&#xD;
note; this morning 1 1~mew that she went Out&#xD;
at daylight to meet him-Leslie, my darling&#xD;
girl, it goes to my heart to tell you all this;&#xD;
but how can I know how much further you&#xD;
might be deceived if I let it go on?"&#xD;
"YelL are quite right to tell me, if it is&#xD;
true," said Leslie, calmly. She was deter-&#xD;
mined the other should not guess what a&#xD;
sense of deadly faintness came over her, how&#xD;
things grew black before her eyes, or how she&#xD;
was fain to lean heavily against the toilet-&#xD;
table in order to support her trembling limbs.&#xD;
"But you must pardon me if I say that all&#xD;
this is merely assertion," she added, after a&#xD;
moment. ~' In a matter of such grave impor.&#xD;
tance-a matter touching not only my own&#xD;
happiness, but the honor of those nearest and&#xD;
dearest to me-'I should do them grievous in-&#xD;
justice if I were convinced by any thing short&#xD;
of proof."&#xD;
"And I l~ave proof!" said Mrs, Sandford,&#xD;
exultantly. Sl~e forgot herself, and let that&#xD;
tone of her voice betray her real feeling-not&#xD;
sympathy, not indignation for Leslie's wrongs,&#xD;
but exultation, pure and simple, in the fact&#xD;
that she held proof, absolute, indisputable&#xD;
proof, in her hand, at last!&#xD;
"What kind of proof?" asked ]~ eslie&#xD;
She had caught the tone, and it hard4~ncd her&#xD;
heart, and braced her nerves, which for a mo-&#xD;
ment had been in danger of failing.&#xD;
lThr answer7 Mrs. Sandford drew from her&#xD;
pocket a letter1 and laid it on the toilet-table,&#xD;
s~ that its calligraphy could be plainly oh.&#xD;
served, and, if necessary, read. "I suppose&#xD;
you know that writing?" she said, with the&#xD;
veiled falseness coming back to her voice.&#xD;
"I am sure the sight of it must go to your&#xD;
heart,~ my dear; for oh, what a stab it gave me&#xD;
when I openeli the, pocket-book and saw&#xD;
it! "'&#xD;
"The pocket-book-what poeket-book?"&#xD;
asked Leslie. She knew the writing in a mo-&#xD;
ment-blurred and defaced though it was,&#xD;
there was no mistaking those bold, black&#xD;
oharaeters-.-.but, even in this supreme me-&#xD;
mont of doubt~ temptation, and the sharp cer-&#xD;
tainty of betrayal, her exquisite instinct of&#xD;
honor remained with the girl. Touch the let-&#xD;
tar' she would Dot, until she knew whether or&#xD;
not she had a right to do so.&#xD;
"Mr. Tyhdale's pocket-book!" answered&#xD;
)irn Saudford, with a tone of triumph, despite&#xD;
all her efforts', ringing again in the words.&#xD;

OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
"lIe lost it to-night, and Mr. Ransome found&#xD;
it as we were crossing the lawn. I put it into&#xD;
my pocket, and forgot all about it until a lit.&#xD;
tIe while ago, wHen I took off my dress.&#xD;
Then, examining it-to find out to whom it&#xD;
belonged, you know-I f&amp;amp;und this letter. It&#xD;
seemed providential, for I was just debating.&#xD;
whether or not I should come and tell you all&#xD;
that I knew without any proof-but, of course,&#xD;
with thi8, I could not hesitate any longer. I&#xD;
don't clearly understand how it came into&#xD;
Arthur's possession," she continued, with a&#xD;
puzzled look, "for it is not addressed to him,&#xD;
and it tells Miss Desinond's story from her&#xD;
point of view; but still-if you take all that&#xD;
she says with a great deal of allowance-you&#xD;
will see bow they knew each other in Burope,&#xD;
and how-"&#xD;
"Bxcuse me!" said Leslie-she held up&#xD;
her hand with an indignant, silencing motion&#xD;
-" I woul4 rather hear no more! Indeed, I&#xD;
absol~ztely decline to hear any more !-Noth-&#xD;
ing will induce me to read a line of the con-&#xD;
tents of this letter!" she added, with sudden&#xD;
passion. "I should never have listened to&#xD;
you, as I have done, if I had imagined for a&#xD;
moment how your information was obtained.&#xD;
If you have no other proof than this to offer,&#xD;
our conversation is at an end. I will listen to&#xD;
no morel"&#xD;
"That is just as you please, of course'!"&#xD;
said Mrs. Sandiord. Seldom in her life had&#xD;
she been more taken by surprise, seldom in&#xD;
her life had she been more angry. A flush&#xD;
of color came over her face, her blue eyes&#xD;
expanded with something besides their usual&#xD;
infantine artlessness. "If this is your grati-&#xD;
tude for all that I have done for you," she&#xD;
cried, in a voice tremulous with indignation,&#xD;
"of course, it is quite useless to say that I&#xD;
never thought of myself'. Why should I&#xD;
have thought of myself? Neither Miss Des-&#xD;
mond nor Mr. Tyndale is any thing to me!&#xD;
They might elope to-morrow, and Ishould not&#xD;
care! I only thought of you-and this is you~&#xD;
gratitude!"&#xD;
"Pardon we, if I said more than I should&#xD;
have done!" answered Leslie. "I scarcely&#xD;
knew what I was saying I did hot mean to&#xD;
be ungrateful. No doubt you desire to serve&#xD;
me; but I would rather remain in ignorance&#xD;
forever, than gain knowledge by suchk a means&#xD;
as this,~t she added, firmly.&#xD;
"I consider that absurd-worse than ab.&#xD;
surd!" cried Mrs. Snndf'ord, angrily. "When&#xD;
&#xD;
S&#xD;
&#xD;
ARTHUR TYNDALE'S L~TTBR.&#xD;
&#xD;
one is deceived and betrayed, one has a right&#xD;
to defend one's self."&#xD;
"By deceiving and betraying in turn ~&#xD;
asked Leslie. "'I cannot agree with you. If&#xD;
I am deceived and betrayed, that is the fault&#xD;
of others; but it is my own fault if I disre~&#xD;
gard my own sense of honor and integrity."&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford would have liked to dalI&#xD;
these commendable sentiments "melodramat-&#xD;
ic stuff!" but, not having the requisite cour-&#xD;
age, she shrugged her shoulders in a man-&#xD;
ner calculated to -express the same thing&#xD;
without words. "It is just as you please, of&#xD;
course!" she suid ugain, more stiffly than b&amp;amp;&#xD;
fore. "'I am ~sorry that I came but thought&#xD;
you might to know all that Is going on. No~&#xD;
body else would speak, and circumstances&#xD;
put the proof into say hands."'&#xD;
"It is impossible for me to' use it," said'&#xD;
Leslie. She stood like a rock, with her proud,&#xD;
pathetic face, her wistful eyes with their look&#xD;
of bitter pain. "If I read that letter, I&#xD;
should never respect myself again !" she&#xD;
cried, with a vibrating thrill in her' voice.&#xD;
"' I suppose I had better' take it and put it&#xD;
back into the pocket-book, then," said' M~rs.&#xD;
Sandford', with a tone of contemptuous vex-&#xD;
ation in her voice. Itergrand o-wip had: ended&#xD;
in failure, and at that' moment she was so&#xD;
angry with Leslie that she could' scarcely&#xD;
trust herself to speak. She rose, and, ad-&#xD;
vanc~ng' to' the toilet-table, laid' her hand on&#xD;
the letter; but, to her' surprise, Leslie inter-&#xD;
posed.&#xD;
"If you will excuse' me~"" she said, "I&#xD;
should prefer to keep this. I have the best&#xD;
right to do so, and it will enable me to return&#xD;
it to its owner~"&#xD;
Oh, certainly;" said Mrs~ ~andford, draw-&#xD;
ing back her hand. "I have no right to it,&#xD;
and not the least disposition to' claim one.&#xD;
As' I said before, Miss Desmond's and Mr.&#xD;
T~ndnle's conduct is nothing' to me!"&#xD;
But, as she spoke thus, the pretty widow&#xD;
thought cynically that, after all, Leslie had&#xD;
indulged in a most absurd and unnecessary&#xD;
pretence of pharisaical honor. It was evi-&#xD;
dent at a glance that she meant to keep the&#xD;
letter'to read; why, then; 'could she not have&#xD;
read' it at once, without all this "fuss?"&#xD;
nut; even aw she asked the question, her in-&#xD;
dignant contempt changed oddly enough into&#xD;
something like respect. Leslie', it was evi-&#xD;
dent, knew "what she was about."' She&#xD;
to read the letter, but she did 'not&#xD;
&#xD;
163&#xD;
&#xD;
- mean to be detected in doing so. Mrs. saud-&#xD;
ford felt able to appreciate' the shrewdness 01'&#xD;
this manoeuvre.&#xD;
"To think that I should have been foot&#xD;
enough to be deceived for a minute by all her&#xD;
high-flown nonsense!" she said, to herself, as&#xD;
she left the room and walked down the cor-&#xD;
ridor to heroin chamber. "I ought to have&#xD;
known better. Thit~ she Is shrewder than I&#xD;
gave her credit' for' being-oh, much shrewd~&#xD;
or! What a point she will make now of not&#xD;
having' read it, when she returns It, and all&#xD;
the time she' wilL know every word in It at&#xD;
well or better than' I do r might have pre~&#xD;
tended the same thing if I had ebesen F"&#xD;
thought the fair widow, ~irtneus'ly. "'But,&#xD;
after all, it it safer to' tell the' truth-..--there"s&#xD;
some comfort in that."&#xD;
Left alone for the second titne, Leslie&#xD;
stood for several. minutes quite' motionless,&#xD;
looking at the letter as it lay before her en&#xD;
the marble where Mrs~ Sandford had' first laid&#xD;
it. During those minutes' she wrestled' with'&#xD;
and overcame as' sharp a temptation as' falls&#xD;
'to the lot of most of us during this mortal&#xD;
life. In that letter was the truth-the truth&#xD;
unglossed by deceiving words, or looks, or&#xD;
tones-the truth as it was~ and not as it might&#xD;
perhaps be told to her; it had been brought&#xD;
and laid before her by no a'ct of her own; if&#xD;
she put it from bet, could she ever be quite&#xD;
sure that the mystery under whfch sh~&#xD;
writhed was made plain as this would make&#xD;
it plain?&#xD;
After a while she turned abruptly away,&#xD;
and walked across the room to an open win-&#xD;
dow which overlooked~ the lawn, on which&#xD;
moonlight and shadow were blended, the&#xD;
shrubbery, the woods, the' distant flelde and&#xD;
hills all~'tbc' serene, beautiful, Silver-flooded&#xD;
prospect, with' the marvelous sky arching&#xD;
overhead, and the murmur of the rIver over'&#xD;
its rapids far away makin'g'a weird; mystical&#xD;
music on the summer' night. Here she stood,&#xD;
asking herself, vainly and torturingly, what&#xD;
she should do. They had known each other,&#xD;
loved each other, long ego! That was' the&#xD;
refrain of all her thoughts; the sharpest sting&#xD;
of' all her paint They had deceived her from&#xD;
the first! Although she repeated this again&#xD;
and again, she could not realize it-she coirki&#xD;
not force her comprehension te grasp it atan&#xD;
intelligent fact. ~he'fcund hersSlf goingbaek&#xD;

&#xD;
A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
ed shrinking from her, Norah's pretended ac-&#xD;
quaintance with Max. "And they knew each&#xD;
other then," she would think. "All the time&#xD;
they were deceiving me, and smiling to them-&#xD;
selves, perhaps. It was all false ! false&#xD;
false!"&#xD;
Yes, all false-every thing false! The&#xD;
lover's love, the sister's affection~-i~ll false!&#xD;
She had never really possessed either the&#xD;
ene or the other. For some inscrutable rea-&#xD;
son, they h~d chosen to make a tool and dupe&#xD;
of her, but she had been no more to either of&#xD;
them than that. She thought of all her trust&#xD;
iii Arthur, of all her plans respecting the&#xD;
change she would make in Norah's life.&#xD;
Somehow, these things came back to her as&#xD;
she stood there in the moonlight-alone with&#xD;
~ier great desolation, her inexpressible pain.&#xD;
And it was while she still stood, gazing&#xD;
blankly, dumbly out on the jewel-like beauty,&#xD;
which she did not see, that her attention was&#xD;
attracted - how, she scarcely knew - by a&#xD;
white-clad figure which emerged from the&#xD;
shrubbery, and, crossing the lawn, came slow-&#xD;
ly, as if careless of observation, toward the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
~That it wns Norah she knew in a moment.&#xD;
There was no mistaking the lines of the fig-&#xD;
ure, or the stately,, unconscious majesty of&#xD;
the gait. Her head was bent a little, in an&#xD;
attitude not ~sua1~with her; but the free,&#xD;
elastic step was unchanged. Varying the&#xD;
monotony of its dull pain, a throb of bitter&#xD;
anguish seemed to seize and rend Leslie's&#xD;
heart. It was true, then, all that Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford had said! There were assignations,- et-&#xD;
ings-this, no doubt, had been one of th&#xD;
Oh, the misery, the bitterness ,of feeling, of&#xD;
knowing, of seeing, how she was betrayed! A&#xD;
great passion of outraged love and 'jealousy&#xD;
swept over the, girl like a flood. She sudden-&#xD;
ly smote her hands together with an unuttered&#xD;
prayer. "0 my God, my, God, teach me how&#xD;
to bear it!" was her inward cry-a cry which&#xD;
He to whom she spoke scarcely left unan-&#xD;
swered.'&#xD;
Meanwhile; she heard Norah enter the&#xD;
veranda, open one, of the Venetian blinds of&#xD;
the sitting-room-the, windows were rarely&#xD;
closed at night-and so ,pass, without diffi.&#xD;
culty, into the, house. ,It is likely that she&#xD;
took offer shoes ,before ascending the stair-&#xD;
case, for, after this, Leslie heard no further&#xD;
aound. ' , '&#xD;
But, in truth, she ~id not 'listen for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
Her mind was full of something else. A reso-&#xD;
lution came to her like a flash of inspiration.&#xD;
She would go to Norah! That was the best&#xD;
thing to do. Unconsciously to herself-or, at&#xD;
least, unacknowledged by herself-Leslie felt&#xD;
that there was no hope of hearing truth fro~n&#xD;
Arthur Tyndale. But Norah-Norah, with&#xD;
her defiance and recklessness, might tell -it,&#xD;
perhaps, when confronted with the plain proofs&#xD;
of all that had'~been revealed by chance or&#xD;
accident.&#xD;
Leslie did not give her resolution time to&#xD;
change. She was in one of those moods when&#xD;
even the most impassive feel that they must&#xD;
act or die. She turned from the window,&#xD;
crossed the floor, took the letter from the&#xD;
table, where it still lay, and, opening the door&#xD;
noiselessly, passed, in her bare, unslippered&#xD;
feet, down the 'corridor to Norah's room, un-&#xD;
der the door of which a bright stream of light&#xD;
shone.&#xD;
In this room Norah had not been more&#xD;
than five minutes, and she was still lying,&#xD;
where she had thrown herself in utter exhaus-&#xD;
tion, across the foot of the bed, when Leslie's&#xD;
sudden knock startled her. Immediately her&#xD;
alert vitality asserted itself She sprang to&#xD;
her feet, unable to conjecture what such a&#xD;
sound, at such an hour, could possibly mean&#xD;
-and, instead of saying "Come in," walked&#xD;
quickly to the door and opened it. Her&#xD;
amazement when she faced Leslie-Leslie, in&#xD;
her night-dress, and pale as a statue-could&#xD;
scarcely have been exceeded.&#xD;
"Leslie!" she exclaimed. "What is the&#xD;
matter? What has happened? Come in!"&#xD;
"Nothing is the matter-at least, I mean&#xD;
nothing has happened," answered Leslie,&#xD;
coming in. "I want to see you-that is all.&#xD;
I am sorry to have startled you.".&#xD;
"Oh nothing startles me very, much," an-&#xD;
swered i~orah, who had regained all her self-&#xD;
possession. "My nerves are good-Kate often&#xD;
says that she thinks I have none. Pray, sit&#xD;
down-you look pale. Here is a comfortable&#xD;
chair."&#xD;
Leslie sat down-indeed, she was trem-&#xD;
bling from head to foot, and more than ready&#xD;
to do so. The reaction from her tense strain&#xD;
of nervous excitement began to make itself&#xD;
felt. But, as yet, the strong, power of will'&#xD;
bore her up. Her voice was as steady and&#xD;
quiet as usual when she looked at Norab and&#xD;
spoke again.&#xD;
"I ought to beg pardon for disturbing you&#xD;
&#xD;
at such an hour. I should not have done so&#xD;
if I had not seen. you cross the lawn a few&#xD;
minutes ago, and therefore I knew you were&#xD;
still ~&#xD;
"Yes, I crossed the lawn a few minutes&#xD;
ago," said Norab, quietly-but there was a&#xD;
slight strain of defiance in her voice. Had&#xD;
Leslie come to lecture he~ on propriety?&#xD;
This was the idea which at once occurred to&#xD;
her.&#xD;
But Leslie was thinking of something be-&#xD;
sides propriety. At another ti'~e she would&#xD;
certainly have been shocked at the idea; of a&#xD;
young lady wandering,' either alone or at-&#xD;
tended, about the grounds, at midnight, when&#xD;
all the rest of the household were safely and&#xD;
decorously in bed-but now she had no time&#xD;
to spare for being shocked. She accepted&#xD;
the fact that Norah had been to meet Arthur,&#xD;
and ~passed on at once to the other, the more&#xD;
importautmatter bearing relation to this fact.&#xD;
"Since I saw you last," she said, "a letter&#xD;
has been put into my hands which belongs&#xD;
to you, or, at least, was written by you, and I&#xD;
have thought it best to bring it to you my-&#xD;
self2'&#xD;
As she spoke, she laid the letter down on&#xD;
a table which was near at hand-the same&#xD;
table on which stood the desk that had so&#xD;
tempted and so baffled Mrs. Sandford. The&#xD;
moment that her hand was lifted from it,, No-&#xD;
rah recognized it. A glow of color flashed&#xD;
into her face., She glanced from the letter to&#xD;
Leslie, and from Leslie back to the letter. To&#xD;
imagine where it had come from certainly&#xD;
puzzled her.&#xD;
"Yes, this is mine," she said, taking it up&#xD;
and glancing at the blurred pages. "It is a&#xD;
letter to Kate, which I wrote several days&#xD;
ago, and-lost."&#xD;
"Lost!" repeated Leslie, involuntarily.&#xD;
Ilope assuredly springs eternal in the human&#xD;
breast. At that moment her heart gave a&#xD;
leap; she was almost ready to believe that&#xD;
the whole thing had been a great and terrible&#xD;
misconception. But Norah's glance, and No-&#xD;
rah's tone, the nextmoment, undeceived her.&#xD;
"I suppose, of course, you have read it?"&#xD;
she said, glancing from the letter to the pale&#xD;
face before her with a keenness and coolness&#xD;
which seemed to faIl like ice on Leslie's heart.&#xD;
"No," the latter answered, not indig-&#xD;
nantly, but so quietly that the word sounded&#xD;
almost indifferent. "It was not mine; I had&#xD;
no right to read it."&#xD;
&#xD;
MRS. SANDFORD'&#xD;
&#xD;
S INTERFERENCE.                      165&#xD;
"And may I ask how it came into your&#xD;
possession?"&#xD;
"You have a right to do so, I suppose.&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford brought it to me; she f~und it&#xD;
in a pocket-book of Ar-of Mr. Tyndale's,&#xD;
which he dropped on the lawn."&#xD;
"Indeed I" said Norab.&#xD;
Expressive as this monosyllable can be&#xD;
made, it has seldom been more expressive&#xD;
than as it fell from her lips.' It meant many&#xD;
things which Leslie did not understand: for&#xD;
one thing, that Max and herself had been&#xD;
right in believing that Arthur had the letter;&#xD;
and, for an other, that it was no wonder he&#xD;
had declined to deliver what had passed out&#xD;
of his possession. She did not know that he&#xD;
had firmly believed himself possessed of the&#xD;
letter at the very time when he refused to&#xD;
acknowledge any thing about it to Max, and&#xD;
that his conduct could only be accounted' for&#xD;
on the, grounds. of general depravity and&#xD;
drunken obttinacy.&#xD;
"This ~,s not th6 first time that Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford has interfered in a matter which does&#xD;
not concern her in the least,~' Miss Desmond&#xD;
said, after a little while, very coldly-even at&#xD;
this supreme moment of preoccupation Leslie&#xD;
could not help being struck by the utter ab-&#xD;
sence of any thing like "detected guilt" in&#xD;
her manner or appearance-" I need hardly&#xD;
ask whether or not she has favored you with&#xD;
an account of the various items of inforina-&#xD;
tion with regard to Mr. Tyndale and myself&#xD;
which she has gleaned by eavesdropping' and&#xD;
other honorable means?"&#xD;
"She made some statements which cer-&#xD;
tainly seemed to me very strange," said Leslie.&#xD;
She could scarcely articulate; her lips seemed&#xD;
parched, her tongue was heavy as lead. It&#xD;
was true, then, all true; and this matchless&#xD;
assurance was only the careless insolence of&#xD;
,one to whom detection was of no importance.&#xD;
"For one thing," she said, gathering courage,&#xD;
"she told me that Mr. Tyndale and yourself&#xD;
had known each other long ago abroad."&#xD;
"She is quite right," said Norah. She&#xD;
was leaning her elbow on' the table as 'she&#xD;
spoke, and her smooth chin in the pink palm&#xD;
of her hand, while her full chestnut eyes met&#xD;
Leslie's own. "Mr. Tyndale and I knew each&#xD;
other very well when he was abroad two&#xD;
years ago."&#xD;
"And yet you told pie," cried Leslie, with&#xD;
passionate indigpation-but here her voice&#xD;
choked and broke down.&#xD;

After all, some things are too great for&#xD;
speech. Her agony of ruined love and slat-&#xD;
t.ered truSt, was ~ of them&#xD;
"I told you.-.-cr X allowed you to imagine&#xD;
-what was not true," laid ,Norah, in her&#xD;
clear voice. "Yes, ~ acknowledge that. ~ut&#xD;
it was, or I thought it was, a necessity of my&#xD;

"What do you mean?" asked Leslie, with&#xD;
a gasp&#xD;
Py this time her mind felt as if it was lit.&#xD;
ovally reeling under the continually varying&#xD;
and multiplying impressions which were&#xD;
thrust upon it, She was only aware now of a&#xD;
strange consciOnsness&amp;amp; that. Norah was mis-&#xD;
tress of the situation; that Norah held the&#xD;
key of all this mystery which so puzzled and&#xD;
Wrmentcd her, There was something of su-&#xD;
preme gentleness and pity in those brilliant&#xD;
eyes, and Norab's tone was very dill'erent from&#xD;
that of one arraigned for'her own misdeeds.&#xD;
"Shall I tell you what I mean?" said she,&#xD;
gravely. "Are you strong enough to bear&#xD;
the trsi~h...4he whole truth? If you are, you&#xD;
shall bear it? I said tlzat from the Jirat. If&#xD;
you wished to live on lies, I was willing to&#xD;
let you do so. lint, if you want the truth-"~"&#xD;
"I do want the truth?" interrupted Les-&#xD;
lie, passionately. "What else should I want?&#xD;
for what else am I here? The truth, howev-&#xD;
er bitter and terrible it may be I" she cried,&#xD;
clasping her hauds~ "I have endured the&#xD;
sting, the misery, th. agony of deception,&#xD;
until I am roady..-oh, snore than rea4y~"to&#xD;
hehrthO truth, whatever it may be!"&#xD;
"Then you shall hear it," said ~orah, al-&#xD;
most solemnly, She extended her hands,&#xD;
and, with one of the quick, impetuous mo-&#xD;
tions which characterized her, opened and&#xD;
spread out the letter which lay between them.&#xD;
"If you will read this," she said, "it will tell&#xD;
yen something; the rest I can supply, and&#xD;

VHM'TBR XXVIII.&#xD;
"'Tis a stern and startling thing to think&#xD;
How often mortality stands on the brink&#xD;
01' its grave without any misgiving;&#xD;
And yet in this slippery world of strife,&#xD;
In the stir of human bustle so rife,&#xD;
There are daily sounds to tell us that Life&#xD;
Is flying, and Deathis living 1"&#xD;
Faox midnight, of a midsummer night, t~&#xD;
the time when the first rosy flush of day be-&#xD;
gins to break in the east, is not very long, as&#xD;
most of us have, at one time or another of&#xD;
our lives, practically diseov~retl. Max Tyn-&#xD;
dale discovered as much for himself after he&#xD;
parted with Norab, and, returning to Straf-&#xD;
ford, began to prepare for his intended jour-&#xD;
ney. With most men that special terror of&#xD;
the feminine soul, "packing," is a process&#xD;
chiefly remarkable for simplicity and brevity;&#xD;
but Max had been established at Strafford&#xD;
long enough to ilnd a good deal on his hands&#xD;
when it became necessary to prepare for a&#xD;
Ilnal departure in this abrupt fashion. For~&#xD;
tunately, he had a natural neatness and love&#xD;
of order added to his military training, so&#xD;
that the gathering together and disposing of&#xD;
many odds and ends was not so serious a mat-&#xD;
ter to him as it would have been to the ma-&#xD;
jority of men~ In an hour or two his labors&#xD;
were finished. Thea he sat down and wrote&#xD;
a few lines to Arthur, thanking him for his&#xD;
hospitality, and regretting that they had&#xD;
parted so angrily-dines t,2.uched somewhat&#xD;
by the memory of old kindness, though Max's&#xD;
heart was still hard against his cousin, After&#xD;
this, he threw himself on the bed, and, having&#xD;
a good conscience, and a not particularly&#xD;
damaged heart, was soon sleeping soundly,&#xD;
while the air freshened, the moon sank tow-&#xD;
ard the west, and the cast began to glows&#xD;
Qf course, he dreamed of Koral l~esmond&#xD;
~.-what ~nan could have failed to do so, with&#xD;
the scene of the snmmcr.house freh in his&#xD;
recollection ?.-but his dreams werex~t by any&#xD;
means as agreeable as the reality. lIe saw&#xD;
her again standing before him in the moon-&#xD;
light, beautiful and proud, with her hand ex-&#xD;
tended in farewell; but, when he was in the&#xD;
act of taking it, the shot which had startled&#xD;
them sounded again', and she bank dead at his&#xD;
feet. Qddly enough, he was distinctly con-&#xD;
scions that it was a nightmare; but he could&#xD;
not waken himself sufficiently to shake it off,&#xD;
and the dream went~ on. She was.taken and&#xD;
&#xD;
T~&#xD;
&#xD;
borne to the honse-.-he saw the fair face, with&#xD;
the death-agony stamped upon it, in the coffin&#xD;
.-nay, he even heard them nailing down the&#xD;
lid. Did they know ~that they were nailing&#xD;
down his heart with it? life knew it now,&#xD;
too late. He tried to move and cry out.-&#xD;
Suddenly he sprang to his feet, wide awake,&#xD;
conscious that it was broad daylight, and that&#xD;
Giles was knocking at his door.&#xD;
"Come in.-why the deuce don't you come&#xD;
in?" he cried, snappishly-even the best-&#xD;
natured people are sometimes snappish when&#xD;
waked abruptly at five o'clock in the morning.&#xD;
"Door's locked, sir!" responded. Giles,&#xD;
struggling with the handle on the other side.&#xD;
"True enough-I forgot that," said Cap-&#xD;
tain Tyndale. He glanced at his watch: it&#xD;
wa~ just five o'clock. Then he crossed the&#xD;
floor and unlocked the door-which he had&#xD;
absen~ly fastened behind him the iiight before,&#xD;
"What is the matter?" he demanded.&#xD;
"What are you making such a confounded&#xD;
row about? I told you I wanted to get off at&#xD;
kelf.pest five, and it is only five now."&#xD;
"I know that, sir," said Giles. "I didn't&#xD;
come on that account, sir. I come to ask if&#xD;
you know where Mr. Tyndale is?"&#xD;
"Where he is! In bed, I suppose," an-&#xD;
swered Max, opening his eyes. "Where else&#xD;
should he be?"&#xD;
"But he isn't there, sir," said the servant,&#xD;
looking puzzled. "He went out a little after&#xD;
you did, last night, sir, and I don't think he&#xD;
could have come back. At least he isn't in&#xD;
his room, and I've been all over the house,&#xD;
and he isn't anywhere.'?&#xD;
"Isn't anywhere?" repeated Max. He&#xD;
looked, as he felt, considerably astonished.&#xD;
A recollection of the shot of the night before&#xD;
came back to him; and, although he could&#xD;
see no reason for connecting it with Arthur,&#xD;
instinct sometimes connects things in spite&#xD;
of reason. "He may have gone over to los-&#xD;
land, and accepted an invitation to spend the&#xD;
night," he said, after a short pause-though&#xD;
he felt how extremely improbable such a thing&#xD;
was.-" Did he leave the house on foot, and&#xD;
how long after I did?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, he left it on foot," said Giles,&#xD;
looking a little suspicious, and a~ if he fancied&#xD;
that this information was not exactly neces-&#xD;
sary. "I saw him come out 6f the library-&#xD;
window, and cut across the park-in your&#xD;
very tracks, sir-about ten minutes, or maybe&#xD;
~ quarter of an hour, after youleft the house."&#xD;
&#xD;
"And you are sure he did noteome back?"&#xD;
"I'm quite sure of that, sir. His bed hasn't&#xD;
been slept in, nor hi~ room set' foot in, last&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"What can have become of him?" said&#xD;
Captain Tyndale, amusingly. Having mentally&#xD;
pooh-poohed his first vague idea about the&#xD;
shot, be felt more curiosity than alarm con-&#xD;
cerning this mysterious disappearance. He&#xD;
knew what Arthur's condition had been the&#xD;
night before, and that he .was ready for any&#xD;
thing, however desperate or absurd. The&#xD;
question was, what desperate or absurd thing&#xD;
had he done? Max's own impression was&#xD;
that he had gone away, as he had threatened&#xD;
to do, the day before; but, of course, he said&#xD;
nothing of this to the servant standing by si.&#xD;
lent, watchful, and expectant.&#xD;
"Your master is able to take care of him-&#xD;
self," he said. "No doubt he'll turn up nil&#xD;
right after a while. Dy-the-by, I suppose you&#xD;
don't know whether any train passes Weiford&#xD;
about midnight, or a little later, do you?"&#xD;
"Anderson's just been telling me that the&#xD;
schedule changed yesterday," answered Giles.&#xD;
"He was over at Wexford and heard it; but&#xD;
he don't know exactly about the hours. He&#xD;
heard the railroad people saying that the ten-&#xD;
o'clock train wouldn't be along tillafter mid-&#xD;
night; but he don't know any thing about the&#xD;
half-past six-"&#xD;
"Tell him to be at the door by a quarter&#xD;
to six, at all events, and we'll drive over and&#xD;
see about it," said Max, curtly-having no&#xD;
fancy for a longer stay at Strafford under any&#xD;
circumstances. "See that there's a cup of&#xD;
coffee in the dining - room for me when I&#xD;
come down," he added; "and what arc you&#xD;
waiting for? That is alL"&#xD;
"Hadn't I better send a messenger over&#xD;
to ask whether Mr. Tyndale's at Mr. Middle-&#xD;
ton's, sir?"&#xD;
"If you want Ma. Tyndale to break your&#xD;
head, you had certainly better do so. He is&#xD;
not a baby, and I don't think he would ex-&#xD;
actly relish being treated as if he were."&#xD;
With this reply Giles took his departure,&#xD;
long-faced and serious. It may be said for&#xD;
him that he was anxious as well as puzzled.&#xD;
It was impossible for any one to be closely&#xD;
associated with Arthur Tyndale without be-&#xD;
coming attached to him. Seen generally and&#xD;
superficially, be was generous, amiable, frank&#xD;
of manner, and open of hand-a debonair&#xD;
young prince'with whom the world went well,&#xD;

168                      A DAUGHTER&#xD;
and who was willing to throw a little of his&#xD;
sunshine on the lives of those around him.&#xD;
This when the world did go well with him.&#xD;
What he was when it went -ill these pages,&#xD;
which record an exceptional and not a usual&#xD;
phase of his character,-may tell.,&#xD;
Meanwhile, half an hour went on, and no&#xD;
sign of him appeared. A general impression&#xD;
that something was wrong had, by this time,&#xD;
diffused itself throughout the Strafford house-&#xD;
hold. Under the stress of these circum-&#xD;
stances Giles's tongue was loosed, and he gave&#xD;
forth hints respecting what he might say con-&#xD;
cerning a serious difficulty between the two&#xD;
cousins the night before. These hints,&#xD;
coupled with Arthur's disappearance and&#xD;
Max's proposed departure, were enough to&#xD;
set the tongues of half a dozen servants at&#xD;
work. The cook shook her turbaned head&#xD;
over the cup of coffee rshe was making for&#xD;
Captain Tyndale ; Anderson shook his head&#xD;
over the horses he was harnessing in the sta-&#xD;
ble ; the housemaidl stood with a broom in her&#xD;
hand talking to Giles on the front portico,&#xD;
and both of them shook their heads at inter-&#xD;
vals. "I wouldn't a' asked Cap'n Tyndale&#xD;
no odds-r'd a'sent to Rosland anyhow,"&#xD;
Mary Ann was saying, indignantly, when,&#xD;
greatly to her dismay, Captain Tyndale him-&#xD;
self stepped out of the open hall-door upon&#xD;
them.                ---&#xD;
" I am going for a short turn in the park,"&#xD;
he said. " Have the coffee ready, and bring&#xD;
my luggage down-I shall not be gone ten&#xD;
minutes."&#xD;
" Very well, sir," said Giles. He turned&#xD;
into the house at once, like the well-trained&#xD;
servant he was, but Mary Ann stood her&#xD;
ground, and, under pretense of sweeping off&#xD;
the portico-steps, watched Captain Tyndale&#xD;
as :he descended the terrace, and struck&#xD;
across the dewy grass, and cool, long shad-&#xD;
ows, straight in the direction of Rosland.&#xD;
In truth, Max was conscious of a queer,&#xD;
uneasy sensation which he could not set at&#xD;
rest-a persistent recollection and connection&#xD;
of Arthur's excited face and the pistol-shot of&#xD;
the night before, which hie found it-impossible&#xD;
to dismiss. He called himself a nervous fool&#xD;
to attach any .serio s significance to his cous-&#xD;
in's absence; but, all the same, he felt that he&#xD;
could not turn his back on Strafford without&#xD;
having satisfied himself by personal observa-&#xD;
tion that nothing tragical had occurred. He&#xD;
certainly thought Arthur's absence singular,&#xD;
&#xD;
though he had not admitted as much to Giles,.&#xD;
It was folly to suppose that he had gone to&#xD;
Rosland, and the idea that he-a sybarite of&#xD;
sybarites-had walked to Wexford in order&#xD;
to take the train, was simply ludicrous.&#xD;
What, then, had become of him ?-where&#xD;
had he spent the night ? Max was aware&#xD;
that the vagaries of a drunken man are often&#xD;
beyond the astutest range of sober intelli-&#xD;
gence, but he wanted to be sure that no harm&#xD;
had come to the young man, and, as a means&#xD;
of ascertaining this, instinct, rather than rea-&#xD;
son, turned his steps in the direction of the&#xD;
bridge, on which or near which the pistol&#xD;
'must have been fired the night before.&#xD;
If the night had been beautiful, the day&#xD;
was peerless; but, as he walked along, he&#xD;
scarcely heeded its glory or freshness. The&#xD;
shadows stretched serenely beautiful over the&#xD;
sparkling grass ; the air was like crystal in its&#xD;
lucid clearness; the distant violet hills. stood&#xD;
out with exquisite distinctness against the&#xD;
horizon-line ; in the leafy depths off the woods&#xD;
an infinite number of birds were singing,&#xD;
twittering, chirping, ushering in the summer&#xD;
day with a chorus of melody. Every thing&#xD;
was jubilantly joyous-jubilantly full of life-.&#xD;
Half unconsciously Max felt this ; half uncon-&#xD;
sciously it jarred on his mood. He was more&#xD;
nervously, indefinitely uneasy than he eared&#xD;
to acknowledge even to himself. One of those&#xD;
presentiments at which we laugh (when they&#xD;
are not fulfilled), warned him that "some-&#xD;
thing had happened," and this feeling in-&#xD;
creased with evewy minute.&#xD;
It increased as he left the park behind,&#xD;
passed through a belt of outlying forest, and&#xD;
came to a bend of the path which led across&#xD;
a some fields. As he emerged out of the green&#xD;
region of shadow into the full glow of sun-&#xD;
light-already warm, even at this early hour&#xD;
-he caught sight of a dark figure at some&#xD;
distance advancing at a rapid pace toward&#xD;
him.&#xD;
For a second the thought occurred to hima&#xD;
that it might be Arthur. The next instant he&#xD;
saw that, instead of being Arthur, or any-&#xD;
body like Arthur, it ewas a negro, without a&#xD;
hat, running at full speed-a negro who, when&#xD;
he saw him, threw up his arms and shouted&#xD;
something unintelligible.&#xD;
The young man stopped short, stopped as&#xD;
if he had been shot, and stood motionless,&#xD;
rooted to the ground. At that moment an&#xD;
instinctive certainty of what had happened&#xD;
&#xD;
rn&#xD;
&#xD;
came to him as clearly as if it had been ut-&#xD;
tered in plainest language in his ear. A con-&#xD;
stricting hand seemed to seize his heart and&#xD;
hold it still for a minute-a long, horrible&#xD;
minute in which the bright, beautiful, golden&#xD;
prospect lay spread out before him unchanged,.&#xD;
and that dark figure speeding along seemed&#xD;
to advance at a snail's pace. .&#xD;
When the boy-a field-hand, whom he&#xD;
chanced to know by sight and name-reached&#xD;
him, he was panting so that he could scarcely&#xD;
articulate. But, if ever terror and horror&#xD;
were imprinted on a human countenance,&#xD;
they were imprinted on his. No need to ask&#xD;
what presence he had seen. There is but one&#xD;
before which humanity quails in such wild&#xD;
consternation. His eyes were distended so&#xD;
that they looked as if they might start from&#xD;
his head, his lower lip was hanging like that&#xD;
of an idiot, and quivered convulsively. -He&#xD;
stammered forth his news so that Max only&#xD;
caught two words - " Mass Arthur " and&#xD;
" dead."&#xD;
Those two words were enough. They told&#xD;
him all that he had blindly, instinctively felt&#xD;
assured that lie should hear, and, face to face&#xD;
with the certainty, his nerves seemed to quiv-&#xD;
er for a moment, and then grow firm again.&#xD;
Hie had not afterward the faintest recollec-&#xD;
tion of what he said or did; but the boy,&#xD;
who was literally chattering like an idiot,&#xD;
often related, to wondering audiences, how&#xD;
coolly Captain Tyndale looked at him and&#xD;
spoke.&#xD;
" Take time and tell me plainly what is&#xD;
the fratter," he said. " Where is Mr.. Tyn-.&#xD;
dale, and how do you know that he is-"&#xD;
He stopped -i even his self - possession&#xD;
could not enable him to utter that final&#xD;
word.&#xD;
" He's down at the creek ! " was the unex-&#xD;
pected answer, given in a horror-stricken&#xD;
whisper. " I was a-comin' across, sir, an' I&#xD;
seen a man lyin' there, so I went down, an'&#xD;
--an'-an' it was Mass Arthur 1 " said the&#xD;
boy ; and, having been brought up on the&#xD;
Tyndale estate, he ended by bursting into&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
" At the creek ! " repeated Max. He asked&#xD;
no further questions. .That was all he wanted&#xD;
to know-wer-e. He started ,at once at a&#xD;
pace equal to a run, crossed the fields, en-&#xD;
tered another belt of woods, and soon reached&#xD;
the stream, the .small creek which bound-&#xD;
ed the Rosland grounds,. and has been Sev-&#xD;

&#xD;
eral times mentioned in the course of this&#xD;
story.&#xD;
Approaching from the side next Strafford,&#xD;
he could see nothing until he gained the very&#xD;
edge of the bank, which, just at the bridge,&#xD;
was some ten or twelve feet above the pres-&#xD;
ent level of the water. As he drew near, his&#xD;
pace involuntarily slackened a little ; he gave&#xD;
one quick, heaving breath; for an instant he&#xD;
felt as if it were literally impossible to advance&#xD;
farther. But he shook off this weakness and&#xD;
went on, until, standing at the entrance of&#xD;
the bridge, he laid his hand on the railing&#xD;
and looked over.&#xD;
Instinct, rather than any conscious act of&#xD;
the reasoning faculties, had guided his steps&#xD;
within the railing of the bridge; and it was&#xD;
foi-tunate for him that it had been so, since,&#xD;
prepared though he was for the sight that&#xD;
awaited him, the first glance upon it almost&#xD;
unmanned him. A sudden trembling seized&#xD;
his frame ; his sight grew so dim that, after&#xD;
that first look, he gazed wn on a thick-&#xD;
white mist only. The 'on nerves that had&#xD;
been unshaken when ullets were raining&#xD;
like hail, and men fall ng like leaves, around&#xD;
him, quivered now with a sick faintness he&#xD;
had never known on the bloodiest battle-field.&#xD;
That was in the high carnival of death and&#xD;
carnage, however; what else could have been&#xD;
looked, for then ? But now, amid all this&#xD;
wealth of sylvan beauty and joy, for Arthur&#xD;
-of all human beings, Arthur-to be lying&#xD;
dead, stricken out of life in the glory of his&#xD;
youth, his beauty, his strength, and health,&#xD;
seemed something far too terrible and hideous&#xD;
for belief!&#xD;
Yet it yas so ! The step of the panting&#xD;
negro, as he reached Max's side, roused the&#xD;
latter to something of his usual self-posses-&#xD;
sion. He pressed his hand over his eyes for&#xD;
a minute to clear away their dimness, then he&#xD;
looked down again, and saw a motionless&#xD;
form, a white, rigid face, on which the golden&#xD;
sunbeams fell quiveringly through the green&#xD;
leaves softly rustling overhead..&#xD;
He stood with his eyes fastened upon the&#xD;
dead man for what seemed a long time to the&#xD;
spectator beside him ; but there was some-&#xD;
thing in the expression of his face which pre-&#xD;
cluded the possibility of the negro's ventur-&#xD;
ing to disturb him. At last he turned and&#xD;
spoke quietly, almost gently:&#xD;
"Go over to -Rosland, Lewis, as fast as'&#xD;
you can, and tell Robert that you want to see&#xD;

170               A DAUGHTER OF BOflEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Middleton-say that you have a message&#xD;
on business for him. Take care, however,&#xD;
and don't mention any thing about-this-or&#xD;
it may get to the ears of the ladies of the&#xD;
family, and, you know-"&#xD;
"Yes, sir," said Lewis-his eyes distend-&#xD;
ing again with a gleam of intelligence-as&#xD;
Captain Tyndale stopped suddenly, with a&#xD;
sort of gasp in his voice, "I'll iiot say a word,&#xD;
sir.&#xD;
"Speak to Mr. Middleton alone,, and ask&#xD;
him to come over to Strafford immediately-&#xD;
say that I want to see him on very particular&#xD;
business, or I should not send for him at&#xD;
such an hour. Come back with him, and, as&#xD;
soon as you are out of hearing of the house,&#xD;
tell him what is the matter."&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
Left alone, Max stood still for seine time&#xD;
longer, trying to realize the awful truth that&#xD;
was there before his eyes. Try as he would,&#xD;
however, it was something which he found it&#xD;
impossible to d~. Connect that silent figure&#xD;
with Arthur he could not: and it was only&#xD;
by aii effort he reused himself at last, and,&#xD;
slowly leaving the bridge, walked along the&#xD;
bank of the creek for some twenty or thirty&#xD;
yards toward a spot where th~ ground sloped&#xD;
gradually downward until the greensward&#xD;
was but a few inches above the bed of the&#xD;
stream, which, shrunken now by the summer&#xD;
drought to less than half the width and ye!-&#xD;
time of its winter current, rippled clear and&#xD;
shallow along the middle or deepest part of&#xD;
its channel, leaving a dry, sandy margin on&#xD;
each side. At another time, or under other&#xD;
circumstances, Captain Tyndule might not&#xD;
have been so deliberate in his movements,&#xD;
might not have walked until he could make&#xD;
an easy step from the grassy bank to the&#xD;
creek-bottom. But why should he be in haste&#xD;
now? One glance had told him that all earth-&#xD;
ly effort would be vain-that Death had set&#xD;
his inexorable seal on the victim he had&#xD;
chosen! So he walked lingeringly along&#xD;
the bank, slowly stepped from the soft&#xD;
grass to the barren sand, and, turning, went&#xD;
back toward the bridge, almost immediate-&#xD;
ly beneath which the body of Arthur was&#xD;
lying.&#xD;
For the third time Max paused, when he&#xD;
stood beside the body-for the tbird time a&#xD;
sense of suffocating emotion seized him as he&#xD;
looked on the dead presence that in life had&#xD;
been so familiar to his eye-as he began at&#xD;
&#xD;
last to realize the strange, incomprehensible&#xD;
truth that Arthur was decaL how poor, and&#xD;
petty, and unworthy of remembrance, seemed&#xD;
now the clouds that had come between them&#xD;
of late !-how entirely his thoughts went back&#xD;
to the better days of that~cordial, almost&#xD;
brother-like intercourse and affection which&#xD;
had existed between them for years. A. great&#xD;
pain was at his heart-a great dimness (not&#xD;
of tears, for his eyes were hot and dry) was&#xD;
over his vision, lie bent over and took one&#xD;
of the cold hands in his own. The touch&#xD;
acted like an arousing shock to him. lie&#xD;
shuddered; he let the hand gently fall from&#xD;
his hold; he felt that he must control him-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
"This won't do!" he muttered, as he&#xD;
pushed the hair back from his forehead,&#xD;
throwing off his hat unheedingly in the act.&#xD;
And at that moment an exclamation from a&#xD;
human voice attracted his attention. lie&#xD;
looked up, and saw the pale, horror-stricken&#xD;
face of Mr. Middleton, leaning over the bridge&#xD;
above.&#xD;
"Good God! Tyndale, what is the mean-&#xD;
ing of this?"&#xD;
"God only knows!" Man answered~ with&#xD;
more literal meaning than is often put into&#xD;
those trite words. Truly, and indeed in every&#xD;
sense, God and God alo~ie knew what was the&#xD;
meaning of the scene which the midnight had&#xD;
witnessed here. But that which was merely&#xD;
an exclamation, suggested to him suddenly&#xD;
what he had not thought of before-the ques-&#xD;
tion of lww Arthur had died.&#xD;
"Come down hbre," he said to Mr. Mid-&#xD;
dleton; and the latter, looking a little be-&#xD;
wildered and doubtful as to how he could get&#xD;
down, Max briefly directed him the way he&#xD;
had come himself. Partly the appearance of&#xD;
Mr. Middleton on the scene, and partly the&#xD;
train of thought which his involuntary cry&#xD;
had awakened, at once restored him to his&#xD;
characteristic composure of mind and man-&#xD;
ner, There was something to be done-and&#xD;
the soldier was ready to do it.&#xD;
When Mr. Middleton came to his side,&#xD;
they steeped down beside the body and pro-&#xD;
ceeded to examine it as well as it was pos-&#xD;
sible to do without infringing the law which&#xD;
forbids the touching the body of one found&#xD;
dead until it has been inspected by a jury of&#xD;
inqueSt.&#xD;
Almost'as graceful in death as he. had&#xD;
been in life, Arthur lay in what looked an&#xD;
&#xD;
easy attitude, half on his side, his shoulder&#xD;
supported against a large, flat stone7 his head&#xD;
falling back so that the face was fully ex-&#xD;
posed to view. his right hand the one&#xD;
Max had grasped a few minutes before-&#xD;
rested carelessly beside hini on the saud,&#xD;
palm downward, with loosely.curved fingers,&#xD;
like that of one sleeping; the left arm was&#xD;
bent, and half doubled under the reclining&#xD;
form. The expression of the face-or, more&#xD;
properly speaking, its want of expression-&#xD;
was that of deep, dreamless slumber. Not&#xD;
the slightest shade or contraction marred the&#xD;
beauty of the white f~ehead and pale-tinted&#xD;
but clearly - penciled brows; there was no&#xD;
hollowness under the eyes, where the long&#xD;
lashes swept the cheek, veiling from sight&#xD;
that which "thought shrinks from;" the&#xD;
straight, chiseled nose had no sharpness&#xD;
about it~ lines, and the well-cut lips were&#xD;
closed naturally under the silky waves of the&#xD;
blond mustache.&#xD;
At first they could see no signs of vie.&#xD;
lenee, except that the dress was slightly dis-&#xD;
arranged about the chest and throat, but a&#xD;
moment's scrutiny showed signs of blood on&#xD;
the left side of the head. lEan gently put&#xD;
aside the waves of fair hair, and then they&#xD;
perceived a deep, gaping wound high up on&#xD;
the left temple- the death-wound, as they&#xD;
recognized at a glance. When he saw this,&#xD;
the young man thor~ht again of the shot he&#xD;
had heard the night before, but the shape&#xD;
and general character of the ragged incision&#xD;
forbade even a momentary suspicion that it&#xD;
could have been caused by a pistol-ball. It&#xD;
looked rather as if made by some rough,&#xD;
three-cornered instrument, and convinced the&#xD;
two men at once that the death had not been&#xD;
caused by accident, but was the work of de-&#xD;
liberate desigzm-in plain words, a murder.&#xD;
As the wound looked as if it must have bled&#xD;
profusely, they directed their attention to&#xD;
the ground to See if they could find further&#xD;
traces, and were soon startled by a new dis-&#xD;
covery. A few paces from where the body&#xD;
lay was a spot which had evidently been a&#xD;
pool of blood. .tksd been a pool of blood-it&#xD;
having trickled in a small stream down to&#xD;
the water, no doubt, filtering gradually&#xD;
through the dump sand, also, as it went,&#xD;
leaving only a red stain, which, however,&#xD;
could not be mistaken. But it was not this&#xD;
sanguinary sign which struck theni most.&#xD;
Just beside it was a small, sharp stone, the&#xD;
&#xD;
shape of which seemed to both of them iden-&#xD;
tical with that of the wonu&amp;amp; On examina-&#xD;
tion, they found that it was merely the ex-&#xD;
posed point ot a larger atone embedded im-&#xD;
movably in the sand-a point a good deal&#xD;
like an Indian arrow-bead, and not much&#xD;
larger. In fact, it did not protrude more than&#xD;
an inch above the ground; but it was flint-&#xD;
hard as steel and sharp a~ glass. While&#xD;
they regarded it with mnomently - increasing&#xD;
conviction as to its instrumentality in the&#xD;
death of Arthur, their uncertainty was set at&#xD;
rest by another discovery. Exactly on a line&#xD;
with the stone for about the length of a man's&#xD;
body there was a faint, but perfectly percept&#xD;
tiblo indentation on the sand. They looked&#xD;
at it for an instant, and then Mr. Middleton&#xD;
spoke.&#xD;
"It is plain enough, so far as the mere cir-&#xD;
cumstance of his death is concerned," he&#xD;
said, in that hushed tone to which the voice&#xD;
involuntarily attuned itself in the presence&#xD;
of the great destroyer. "He must have been&#xD;
waylaid and attacked as he went home from&#xD;
my house last night. Them was a struggle,&#xD;
evidently "-he pointed to the loosened c1ravat&#xD;
and other appearances about the upper part&#xD;
of the dress, which could only have resulted&#xD;
from a personal conflict-" and he has been&#xD;
hurled violently down, hishead strikingagainat&#xD;
that stone. But I don't understand why he&#xD;
should be here-how he got here-"&#xD;
He paused, looking vaguely round; and,&#xD;
as by a common impulse, he and Captain&#xD;
Tyndale. rose to their feet, and began to be-&#xD;
stow the same scrutiny on the locale around&#xD;
which they had just given to the body it--&#xD;
self.&#xD;
It would have been hard to find a lovelice&#xD;
spot than this, which was to be evermore a&#xD;
picture, in the memory of both of them, as a&#xD;
scene of, hoi'ror, a background of mocking&#xD;
beauty to the ghastly central object before&#xD;
them. The bridge, a rustic, picturesque struct-&#xD;
nrc of wood, had been thrown over the creek&#xD;
at the point where the stream was narrowest&#xD;
and the banks highest; and almost imme-&#xD;
diately beneath its span they now stood. The&#xD;
banks rose, perpendicular as the walls of a&#xD;
chamber, to at least ten feet above them on&#xD;
each side, for some distance boTh above and&#xD;
below the bridge; and, as the stream made a&#xD;
sudden horseshoe bend just here, they were&#xD;
literally shut in-to the sight-between walls&#xD;
of most varied and luxuriant verdure-shrubs,&#xD;

&#xD;
A DAUGHTEI~ OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
moss, clinging vines, and even trees that bent&#xD;
their limbs over from above, or shot up their&#xD;
stems from the rich, loamy deposit just at&#xD;
the verge of the water. The blue sky, with&#xD;
a few fleecy clouds floating like pearly mists&#xD;
in its liquid depths, was overhead; the sun.&#xD;
shine flickered down tWrough the spreading&#xD;
boughs that fringed the bank on its eastern&#xD;
side, throwing here a gleam, there a broad&#xD;
sheet, of brightest gold over the clear, shald&#xD;
low winter' that flowed noisily by, and upon&#xD;
the dry creek-bed o~i which was stretched the&#xD;
slender, gracefulfigure of the dead man.&#xD;
The first thing which at the same moment&#xD;
attracked the attention of the two gentlemen&#xD;
was the crushed and broken appearance of&#xD;
the shrubs on the bank, at one point a few&#xD;
paces lower down the stream than the spot&#xD;
where the body lay. Several bushes had been&#xD;
uptown, and now hung to their native earth by&#xD;
thefibres of their roots alone, ~while a larger&#xD;
one-a small tree, in fact, it was-had only suf-&#xD;
fered in the breaking of some of its branches.&#xD;
There were signs, too, on nearinvestigation,&#xD;
of a man's feet having been dug into the soil&#xD;
at intervals, in a slanting direction, along the&#xD;
sheer, perpendicular face of the bank-making&#xD;
it plain that somebody had~clambcred down&#xD;
by clinging to the thick, tough growth with&#xD;
which it was clothed.&#xD;
"Could it have been Arthur himself?"&#xD;
was the thought which occurred to both, and&#xD;
which was expressed in the' glance they ex-&#xD;
changed.&#xD;
Again, as with one 'thought, they turned&#xD;
to ascertain this by examining his boots,&#xD;
which would necessarily retain traces of the&#xD;
moist earth, if it had been he. A glance&#xD;
satisfied them that it was not. Both his&#xD;
boots and trousers were immaculate of earth-&#xD;
stain or speckof any kind, as when he had&#xD;
entered 'Mrs. Middleton's drawing-room the&#xD;
evening before.&#xD;
"Strange!" said Mr. Middleton. "There&#xD;
was.a struggle, unquestionably."&#xD;
"Unquestionably," assented Max; "and&#xD;
it is equally unquestionable that, somebody&#xD;
has scrambled down the bank here, and that&#xD;
it was not-himself."&#xD;
'!Yes. What is most unaccountable to&#xD;
rae, though, is how he got here, what he was&#xD;
doing down he'~e, if the murderer came down&#xD;
after him. And, then, that mark there is&#xD;
certainly the print of his body, to say noth-&#xD;
ing of 'the wound: yet he lies in a position&#xD;
&#xD;
which shows he has been moved since he&#xD;
fell." Then, with a fresh burst of horror:&#xD;
"Great Heavens! to think of it! Arthur&#xD;
Tyndale murdered! One of the last men in&#xD;
the world that I shoul~ have expected to see&#xD;
meet such a fate! And here, right at his&#xD;
own door, almost in sight of my house!&#xD;
I Good Heaven~! I can scarcely believe the&#xD;
evidence of my own sense! What could&#xD;
have been the object of such a murder? Can&#xD;
you imagine? 'Oh! "-as ,a sudden' thought&#xD;
struck him-" it may have been a robbery as&#xD;
well as a murder. No!" (after ascertaining&#xD;
that neither watch n~r purse was missing).&#xD;
"There seems no clew to the mystery.&#xD;
Well "-raising himself with a short but&#xD;
deep and audible sigh-" well, we must see&#xD;
about-"&#xD;
"Stop!" said Max. "We will examine&#xD;
the ground above there.-Stay heic, Lewis,"&#xD;
he added, turning to the boy, who had fol-&#xD;
lowed Mr. Middleton closely, and now stood&#xD;
near in open-mouthed wonder, "while we go&#xD;
up on the bridge."&#xD;
He turned and lcd the' way rapidly down&#xD;
the bed of the stream, until he came to a&#xD;
point where he had no difficulty in mounting&#xD;
the bank by the aid of the roots and trunk&#xD;
of a small, gnarled beech-tree; but Mr. Mid-&#xD;
dleton, who was neither so active in move-&#xD;
ment nor so long of leg as himself, kept on&#xD;
to the place they had both passed over in&#xD;
coming, a 'few minutes before, and conse-&#xD;
quently he was considerable behind Max&#xD;
when the latter, after mounting the acclivi-&#xD;
ty, stopped at the entrance of the bridge to&#xD;
wait for him. While be came puffing and&#xD;
blowing up the steep ascent, Max walked upon&#xD;
the bridge, and looked closely at the floor,&#xD;
especially at that part just above the spot&#xD;
where the body lay. As he looked, he shook&#xD;
his head. There were no signs of a struggle&#xD;
having taken place, and, if such a thing had&#xD;
been, the evidences must have appeared, since&#xD;
a thick coating of dust covered the boards,&#xD;
and 'any unusual movement upon it would&#xD;
have left unmistakable traces. The young&#xD;
man turned, and, passing outside the railing,&#xD;
began to direct his scrutiny to the green-&#xD;
sward which stretched along the edge of the&#xD;
bank. He had scarcely turned the corner, so&#xD;
to speak, of the railing-it should be re-&#xD;
marked that this railing, as a matter of pre-&#xD;
caution o&amp;amp; account of the height of the bank,&#xD;
was run out for a considerable distance from&#xD;

A BEARER 0]&#xD;
&#xD;
the edge of the stream upon the land-when&#xD;
a sudden exclamation from him quickened&#xD;
the pace of Mr. Middleton, who was by this&#xD;
time but a few yards oh'. Hastening forward,&#xD;
that gentleman echoed the exclamation with&#xD;
emphasis, as he gazed down up'pn the crushed&#xD;
and trampled turf to which Max's hand point-&#xD;
ed. Here the struggle had been, it was plain,&#xD;
a hand-to-hand struggle, for the grass, which&#xD;
was high and luxuriant, bore the print of&#xD;
trampling feet that had moved in a very small&#xD;
space, and obviously irregular manner, along&#xD;
the very edge of the bank, from which a frag-&#xD;
ment of turf had been broken in one place.&#xD;
Except on this spot, there were no majks of&#xD;
footsteps in any direction. (&#xD;
"So !-there is no question but that he&#xD;
was waylaid, as I have said," observed Mr.&#xD;
Middleton - "and the body must have been&#xD;
thrown fr9m here, instead of off the bridge,&#xD;
as we supposed." He went close to the mar-&#xD;
gin of the bank, looked cautiously over, and&#xD;
was about to speak, when another exclama-&#xD;
tion-this time it was almost a cry-from his&#xD;
companion, startled him so that he nearly&#xD;
lost his balance, and was for an instant in&#xD;
danger of going head-foremost the way he&#xD;
had just expressed his belief that Arthur Tyn-&#xD;
dale had gone. Recovering his equilibrium,&#xD;
he looked round to see what had excited Max&#xD;
so greatly-looked just in time to see the lat-&#xD;
ter start forward, stoop, and seize some ob-&#xD;
ject that lay half eonce~led beneath the&#xD;
sweeping foliage of a small shrub near by.&#xD;
A gleam of sunshine chanced to fall just upon&#xD;
the place, and lighted the plate of burnished&#xD;
metal which had caught Max's eye by its glit-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
"What is it?" said Mr. Middleton, eagerly.&#xD;
"A pistol, you see," was the reply; and&#xD;
the young man held it up to view. "His own&#xD;
pistol, as I perceived in an instant - here is&#xD;
his name." He pointed to the silver plate on&#xD;
which the name was engraven, and then went&#xD;
bn in a tone of deep agitation: "Great God!&#xD;
if I had but gone when I started to go, last&#xD;
night-when I heard that shot-I might per-&#xD;
haps have prevented this! But-"&#xD;
He stopped short-remembering why he&#xD;
had not gone, and, even at that moment,&#xD;
conscious that he must be careful what he&#xD;
said lest he should compromise Norah.&#xD;
"Heard a shot!" repeated Mr. Middleton.&#xD;
"Is it possible you heard a shot last night?&#xD;
When?"&#xD;
&#xD;
? BAD NEWS.                         173&#xD;
"Some time between eleven and twelve&#xD;
o'clock. I was in your grounds-"&#xD;
"Good Heavens!" broke in Mr. Middle-&#xD;
ton, to whose mind, by some association with&#xD;
the word "grounds," the recollection of Les-&#xD;
lie at this instant occurred for the first time&#xD;
since he had come upon the scene of the&#xD;
tragedy-" Good Heavens, Tyndale! 1 had&#xD;
forgotten Leslie! Poor child! "-a sudden&#xD;
moisture came into his eyes, and his voice&#xD;
sounded husky. "I must return home im-&#xD;
mediately "- he went on, hurriedly-" God&#xD;
forbid that sech news should reach her from&#xD;
the tattle of servants, or without preparation!&#xD;
Meanwhile, the body cannot be moved until&#xD;
the jury has ~een it."&#xD;
"Of course not," said Max. "But I will&#xD;
send Lewis to Strafi'ord to have every thing&#xD;
prepared, so that it can be moved as soon as&#xD;
possible. And about the jury&#xD;
"I'll dispatch a messenger to f lie coroner&#xD;
at once-and, as soon as I have told my wife,&#xD;
I will join you again. You remain here, I&#xD;
suppose?"&#xD;
~ said Max.&#xD;
"Fortunately," said Mr. Middleton, "this&#xD;
is a very cool, shady place - and I hope we&#xD;
may get the inquest over in the course of the&#xD;
morning. Now, I'll go."&#xD;
He held out his hand; the two exchanged&#xD;
that nervous grasp which is often more cx-&#xD;
prdssive of strong feeling than many words&#xD;
could be; and then he turned and strode with&#xD;
the vigor of a young man across' the bridge&#xD;
toward Rosland-while the other once more&#xD;
descended to where he had left the servant,&#xD;
as a watcher beside the dead.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII&#xD;
"Love and be loved! yet know love's holiest&#xD;
deeps&#xD;
Few sound while living! when the loved one&#xD;
sleeps,&#xD;
That last, strange sleep, beneath the mournful'&#xD;
sod,&#xD;
Then Memory wakes, like some remorseful god,&#xD;
And all the golden past we scarce did prize,&#xD;
Subtly revives, with light of tender eyes."&#xD;
As Mr. Middleton took his way to Ros-&#xD;
land, it would be difficult to describe the&#xD;
tumult in which his mind was plunged. The&#xD;
first impression of the shock having, in a&#xD;
measure, subsided, he was able to face it&#xD;
more clearly, able to understand all that it&#xD;

&#xD;
isrroived~ and all that must. flow from it-es-&#xD;
pecially with regard to Le~lie. flow was it&#xD;
possible to tell her that the lover from whom&#xD;
she had parted a few hours before in the flush&#xD;
of youth and health, was now' lying dead-&#xD;
foully murdered? How would she bear such&#xD;
an overwhelming blow? It was natural, per-&#xD;
haps, that this consideration should have&#xD;
weighed with him even more than pity for&#xD;
the unfortunate young man who had been&#xD;
hurled so abruptly out of a life which every&#xD;
gift of Fortune con4ired to render one of&#xD;
exceptional brightness. The mystery over-&#xD;
hanging his fate made it doubly tragical; but&#xD;
then that fate was accomplished, the worst&#xD;
was over and done, while Leslie-who could&#xD;
foresee what effect such a shock might have&#xD;
upon her future life? ~i~is was what Mr. Mid-&#xD;
dieton thought, as he walked forward, his&#xD;
steps unconsciously growing slower as he ap.&#xD;
pvoaehed the house, his heart quaking as the&#xD;
veriest coward's' who ever aer~ed in military&#xD;
ranks might have quaked whem~ the order to&#xD;
charge a battery was given. A l~attery! Mild-&#xD;
est of civilians though he was, Mr. Mid~dleton&#xD;
would have faced teli batteries just then, in&#xD;
preference to bearing the news which he car'-&#xD;
ned within the walls of Rosland. As he&#xD;
crossed the lawn, he glanced round at the&#xD;
scattered mallets and croquet-hoops. "Great&#xD;
Heavens! he was here latt night!" he said to&#xD;
himself. Here last night, and now-where?.&#xD;
When he entered the hall, the first person'&#xD;
whom he met, much to his aurprfse, was his&#xD;
wife. Disturbed by the message which' had&#xD;
come for him, and vaguely uneasy concerning&#xD;
what it might portend, Mrs. Middleton had&#xD;
risen, early though it was, and weary as she&#xD;
might well have bceii from the dissipation o'f&#xD;
the night before. "Something is the mat-&#xD;
ter!" she thought ;~ and, since she was not&#xD;
one of the women who are ready to think&#xD;
this on nIl occasions, her instinct may have&#xD;
counted for something. It is at least certain&#xD;
that she did not disturb any one elsewith her&#xD;
apprehensions and forebodings. The whole&#xD;
house was wrapped in itS early morning still.&#xD;
ness as she sat in the halT, fresh and cool, and&#xD;
pleasant to look upon as ever, trying to di.&#xD;
vert her mind with a newspaper which she&#xD;
had taken np, but in reality seeing not one&#xD;
of the sentences on which heiv eyes rested,&#xD;
when ber husband,~ with. a face so pale' that&#xD;
it scarcely bore any resemblance to his own;&#xD;
walked in upon her.&#xD;
&#xD;
This face in itself would have been cnongh&#xD;
to frighten anynerveus woman into a scream,&#xD;
but Mrs. MiddIeton, fortunately for the peace&#xD;
of the household, rarely screamed. As she&#xD;
glanced up, holding her gold. rimmed eye-&#xD;
glass still before her eyes, she uttered a faint&#xD;
cry of surprised alarm, but that was all. The&#xD;
eye-glass fell with a click-she rose to her&#xD;
feet:&#xD;
"George 1" she said-" George t-for&#xD;
Heaven's sake, what is the matter?"&#xD;
Then George, seeing that his face had be-&#xD;
trayed him, and, being a sufficiently sensible&#xD;
man to know that bad news is only made&#xD;
worse by any attempt to "break it," took her&#xD;
trembling hands into his own, and answered&#xD;
plainly;&#xD;
"Something so terrible, Mildred, that God&#xD;
only knows how that poor child up-stairs is&#xD;
to bbar it. Arthur Tyndale is dead!"&#xD;
"Arthur Tyndalc-dead l " she repeated,&#xD;
with a gasp-her eyes opening wide and' star-&#xD;
tIed, her face turning so white that he passed&#xD;
hi's arm quickly around her. "Ge6rge, do&#xD;
you know what you are saying? How-how&#xD;
can Arthur Tyndale be dead ~"&#xD;
"He has been murdered, I fear," said!&#xD;
Mr. Mid~flcton, reluctant'1y "He was fomrl&#xD;
dead down inthe ercek'-bottom by his cousin,&#xD;
who sent for me. There are plain signs of&#xD;
violence, and-courage, Mildred! I thought&#xD;
it best to tell y~u the truth at once - you,&#xD;
who are not like other women - hut try to&#xD;
bear up fon poor Leslie's sake 12'&#xD;
The adjuration was necessary, for she ha~&#xD;
buried her face on his shoulder, shuddering&#xD;
and almost convulsed. Dead ! - murdered!&#xD;
It would have been awful enough if he had&#xD;
been the most ordinary of the guests who&#xD;
had been with her the evening before; but&#xD;
the man who for months had been as intimate&#xD;
in her house as if he had been a son of it,&#xD;
the man whom Leslie was to marry - those&#xD;
who have never passc5i through such a shoek&#xD;
can ill conceive the overmastering horror' of&#xD;
it. At' the sound of Leslie's name, however,&#xD;
she hurst suddenly into passionate tears.&#xD;
"0 my poor teslic 1-0 my poordarling!"&#xD;
she cried. "0 George, George, how will she&#xD;
bear it 12"&#xD;
"It is you who must help her to bear' it,"&#xD;
'said Mr. Middleton, leading' her' into the sit-&#xD;
ting-room and closing the door. The hail was&#xD;
too open and public a place for such a scene&#xD;
as this-for such a story as he had to tell.&#xD;
&#xD;
As he told all that he knew, and all that&#xD;
Max and himself had together conjectured, it&#xD;
was not strange that her sense of the awful&#xD;
nature of the tragedy deepened many fold.&#xD;
It seemed something too appalling for grief,&#xD;
according to the ordinary meaning of that&#xD;
term; it was something which dwarfed all the&#xD;
conventional words in which we speak, all&#xD;
the conventional thoughts we think. Some-&#xD;
times we are tempted to wonder if our power&#xD;
of feeling is as limited as our power of ex-&#xD;
pression. It almost seems so: at least it is&#xD;
certain that a great shock tends as inevitably&#xD;
to deaden the sensations and throw the mind&#xD;
into chaos, as to bewilder the tongue and de-&#xD;
prive us of words. Into something of chaos&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton's mind was thrown now, only&#xD;
dominating all other thoughts was the thought&#xD;
of Leslie, and the necessity - the inexorable,&#xD;
cruel necessity - of telling her the terrible&#xD;
news. From this necessity she shrank, as&#xD;
the weakest woman alive might have done.&#xD;
"I cannot tell her l" she cried. "0&#xD;
George, I cannot! It will kill her I"&#xD;
"The people whom such things kill are&#xD;
weaker people, mentally and physically, than&#xD;
Leslie," answered Mr. Middleton, who had by&#xD;
this time regained something of his usual&#xD;
manner. "It will be a blow which may leave&#xD;
its mark on her till she. dies, but I do not&#xD;
think it will kill her. God knows I would&#xD;
do any thing on earth to spare her," he said,'&#xD;
walking hurriedly to and fro; "but there is&#xD;
nothing to be done. She must bear it; and&#xD;
what we are oNige~ to endure, DIihlred, we&#xD;
can endure. You know that."&#xD;
"But this is so fearful, so sudden! And,&#xD;
then, the doubt-the horrible doubt-George,&#xD;
what am Ito tell her?"&#xD;
"The truth. Any thing else, in such a&#xD;
case, is gratuitous cruelty, not kindness."&#xD;
"I cannot 12' said she, shuddering. "It&#xD;
is too much to ask of me. Oh, to think that&#xD;
sh~ is unconscious now! My poor darling!&#xD;
God help her!"&#xD;
While the woman who had been a mother&#xD;
to her was thus weeping and unnerved below,&#xD;
Leslie, dry-eyed and full of misery-misery&#xD;
which she was too proud to vent in sigh or&#xD;
sob-had risen, Long before her usual hourj&#xD;
from a sleepless couch. It chanced that, in&#xD;
*   her healthy, happy youth, she had never en-&#xD;
dured such a thing before as a sleepless night&#xD;
-a night in which the mind persistently re-&#xD;
fused to allow the body to rest-and the sen-&#xD;
&#xD;
stations which accompany such a vigil were&#xD;
all new to her. She had hitherto entered so&#xD;
little upon the heritage of grief and pain,&#xD;
common to all the children of earth, that she&#xD;
had never before risen with weary lassitude&#xD;
pervading every limb, with a sick heart and&#xD;
an aching head, with a mouth parched as if&#xD;
from fever, with eyes that burned, and lids&#xD;
that felt tense'and strained as they stretched&#xD;
across them. "Was ever sorrow like unto&#xD;
my sorrow? Was ever desolation~ like unto&#xD;
mine?" had been the cry of her soul during&#xD;
all the long hours of that wearynight. Weep?&#xD;
She would have scorned herself if she had&#xD;
felt one tear rise to her eyes. What had she&#xD;
to weep for? For having poured out her love&#xD;
and trust like water on barren ground?~ for&#xD;
having given every thing, and received noth-&#xD;
ing? for having been deceived from first to&#xD;
last? These were not things for which to&#xD;
weep. "'If he had died," she said to herself&#xD;
more than once, with a low moan, "it would&#xD;
have been so different!" Such a thought&#xD;
comes often hand-in-hand with the keen sting&#xD;
of betrayal, and it was not singular, there-&#xD;
fore, that it should have come to Leslie; but&#xD;
if she could have known on what the moon&#xD;
was looking down at that very moment!&#xD;
No instinct came to warn her, however, as&#xD;
she lay' gazing out on the summer night, or&#xD;
the fresh glory of the summer dawn, measur-&#xD;
ing the full height and depth and length and&#xD;
breadth of her desolation, as the hours went&#xD;
by. She was not melodramatic or passionate&#xD;
iii her grief; she d1~I not think that life was,&#xD;
in any sense, over for her. On the contrary,&#xD;
she knew better; she knew that she must rise&#xD;
with the morning to face the necessities of&#xD;
her position, to bear her burden bravely, to&#xD;
let no one even suspect how deep the sting&#xD;
had pierced. A few women-only a few-.&#xD;
are capable of doing this; and Leslie was one&#xD;
of them. There was none of the stuff of a&#xD;
lovesick maiden in her. She could have died&#xD;
sooner than said to the world, in word, look,&#xD;
or tone, "I have been disappointed and be-a&#xD;
traded!" If she had been tried by the or-&#xD;
deal which she anticipated, there is no ques-&#xD;
tion but that her courage would have matched&#xD;
her endurance, no question. but that victory&#xD;
would have come4to her in. the end, as it nl-&#xD;
ways comes to the brave of heart and the&#xD;
strong of purpose.&#xD;
But over this fiery ordeal she had not to&#xD;
pass. As she stood before her mirror, lan-&#xD;

17~6&#xD;
&#xD;
A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
gurdly combing out her soft, brown hair, and&#xD;
trying to think when and how she had better&#xD;
tell Arthur that all was known toher, a low,&#xD;
hesitating knock sounded on her door-a&#xD;
knock which seemed to echo the palpitations&#xD;
of the heart behind it. She started, and&#xD;
turned round. Perhaps it was her over-&#xD;
wrought frame of mind which filled her in-&#xD;
stantly with an instinct of ill. At least, it is&#xD;
certain that she felt it. Was it Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford again? she wondered.&#xD;
"Come in," she said, coldly; and, When&#xD;
the door opened, it was not Mrs. Sandford, but&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton, who stood on the threshold.&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton, with the news she had&#xD;
come to tell a~ clearly printed on her face as&#xD;
it had been on her husband's when he en-&#xD;
tered the hall! One glance at that face Les-&#xD;
lie gave; then she clutched the back of the&#xD;
nearest chair for a support-the room reeled&#xD;
around, her limbs trembled under her, her&#xD;
tongue seemed paralyzed. She could not&#xD;
speak; she could only wonder what had hap.&#xD;
pened-what could possibly have occurred-&#xD;
to make her aunt look like that.&#xD;
As for Mrs. Middleton, she felt as if all&#xD;
power of language deserted her-all knowl-&#xD;
edge or judgment how to act. What to do,&#xD;
what to say, in presence of that white, im-&#xD;
ploring yet unconscious face, she did not&#xD;
know. For an awful minute she stood silent.&#xD;
Then she did the best as well as the simplest&#xD;
thing; she came forwar~l, and took the girl in&#xD;
her arms.&#xD;
"Leslie! Leslie! 0 my poor darling!"&#xD;
she cried, and then fell to weeping so sorely&#xD;
that Leslie felt at once that only one calamity.&#xD;
out of all the calamities of earth, could have&#xD;
befallen her.&#xD;
"What is it, auntie?" she asked, quiver.&#xD;
ingly, regaining her voice at length~ "Is it&#xD;
about Arthur? Has any thing happened to&#xD;
him? Whatever it is, tell me at oiice! I&#xD;
can bear any thing better than this."&#xD;
But the story was too terrible to be told&#xD;
at once-Mrs. Middleton retained that much&#xD;
judgment, at l6ast-and it was only by de-&#xD;
grees that the horror-stricken girl heard her&#xD;
lover's fate. Only by degrees she learned&#xD;
that there was no need now to think of him&#xD;
bitterly, no need now to consider how to give&#xD;
him back his pledge with sufficient scorn!&#xD;
The passions of earth and the things of time&#xD;
were all over for him to whom the great sanc-&#xD;
tification of death had come.&#xD;
&#xD;
And so it was that the love which life&#xD;
had taken from Leslie, death gave to her. In&#xD;
that bitter hour, pride sank down and died&#xD;
utterly; she did not ask any longer whether&#xD;
he had ever really loved her; she did not re-&#xD;
member the sting or the indignity of his de-&#xD;
ception. The last few troubled days of&#xD;
doubt, the last terrible night of certainty,&#xD;
passed from her recollection as entirely as if&#xD;
they had never been. The majesty of her&#xD;
own love rose and asserted itself. She might&#xD;
have crushed and stifled it, while life and all&#xD;
life's possibilities of happiness were his; but&#xD;
now-in that great agony of remorseful love,&#xD;
of tenderness washing out all stain which&#xD;
death awakens-it came back like a flood&#xD;
upon her soul. The golden hero of her&#xD;
youth, the prince nhose kiss had first waked&#xD;
her heart from its maiden trance, was hers&#xD;
again. No power of earth could take him&#xD;
from her now. Worthy or unworthy? Who&#xD;
could ask such a question? When we enter&#xD;
Death's mighty treasure-house, * it is with&#xD;
bared head and reverent breath. The touch,&#xD;
which is like a sacrament, has been pressed&#xD;
upon our gold, and we do not stop to cavil or&#xD;
to ask how much alloy it may contain.&#xD;
Diverse as the faces and the natures of&#xD;
men, arc the ways in which grief displays it-&#xD;
self. Who has not seen the volatile tempera-&#xD;
ment stunned into strange quietness, or the&#xD;
quiet temperament rise into the madness of&#xD;
passionate excitement? Rarely do people&#xD;
"take things" as we expect them to do.&#xD;
Leslie did not take this great shock as her&#xD;
aunt had feared that she might. When she&#xD;
mastered the truth at last, she slipped out of&#xD;
the arms which encircled her, and, with one&#xD;
cry of agony beyond expression, sank upon&#xD;
her knees. "Dead !" she repeated, again&#xD;
and again-and then she would break into&#xD;
low, shivering moans. That was all. Pas-&#xD;
sion, despair, insensibility - none of these&#xD;
things came. Perhaps, though her aunt knew&#xD;
it not, she had already gone through t~o&#xD;
much for any ~triolcnt excess of emotion. In&#xD;
a measure, at least, she was stunned. Her&#xD;
agony of the night had been so intense that&#xD;
she might well have uttered Thekla's words&#xD;
when the bearer of evil tidings entered:&#xD;
"The worst is said already: I can hear&#xD;
Nothing of deeper tlngnlsh 1"&#xD;
* "Death is the great treasure-house of love."-&#xD;

NORAR'S ASTONISHMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
Meanwhile, the news spread through the&#xD;
household with the subtle rapidity of an elec-&#xD;
tric flash. That something of an unusual na-&#xD;
ture had occurred, all the servants Were very&#xD;
well able to surmise when Mr. Middleton was&#xD;
summoned away by an agitated and mysteri-&#xD;
ous messenger; when Mrs. Middleton rose at.&#xD;
an hour unprecedented in the experience of&#xD;
those who had served her for years; when one&#xD;
servant reported that he had met his master&#xD;
on the lawn with a face "like death," and&#xD;
another thnt she had seen her mistress going&#xD;
up-stairs "crying as if she would break her&#xD;
heart.~' But, with all this, they were unpre-&#xD;
pared for the announcement which the ser-&#xD;
vant whom Mr. Middleton summoned to take&#xD;
his message to the coroner made when lie&#xD;
came forth. "Good Lord, Maria, Mr. Tyn.&#xD;
dale's been murdered I" he said, with a dis-&#xD;
mayed a~id yet an important face, to Leslie's&#xD;
maid, whom he met first. "Master says he's&#xD;
been found a.lyin' dead down in the creek!"&#xD;
Then it was that, like hightnhig, the news&#xD;
dilTused itself through the house. Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford's maid flew with the intelligence to her&#xD;
mistress. Maria, aware that Mrs. Middleton&#xD;
was with Leslie, b thought herself of Miss&#xD;
Desmond, and of th immediate necessity of&#xD;
enlightening that yo a y. us it came&#xD;
to pass that, five minutes later, orah was&#xD;
waked from her morning sleep by an excited&#xD;
figure at her bedside-a figure wringing its&#xD;
hands wildly, and announcing, without pref'.&#xD;
ace or preparation, that Arthur Tyndale had&#xD;
been murdered.&#xD;
"What!" she cried, springing up in bed&#xD;
-wide awake, in an instant, startled, incredu-&#xD;
lous, doubting her own ears. "What is it&#xD;
you say? Who has been murdered?"&#xD;
"Mr. Arthur Tyndale, miss!" answered&#xD;
Maria, with something between a sob and a&#xD;
groan in her throat. She was as near hys.&#xD;
teri~cs as it was possible for a young person&#xD;
of the raving-distracted kind to be; but, for&#xD;
all that, it cannot be denied that a certain&#xD;
satisfaction pervaded her breast at this mo-&#xD;
ment. Who could have been insensible to&#xD;
the gratification of being the first to announce&#xD;
such an unexampled item of intelligence?&#xD;
"Arthur Tyadale!" repeated Norab. For&#xD;
a minute she could do nothing but stare at&#xD;
the speaker with distended eyes-amazement,&#xD;
horror, and incredulity, precluding all power&#xD;
of further speech. Then she suddenly sprang&#xD;
to her feet, extended her hands, and, taking&#xD;
12&#xD;
&#xD;
177&#xD;
&#xD;
the maid by the shoulder, gave her a quick&#xD;
shake.&#xD;
"Have you lost your senses, that you&#xD;
come to me with such an absurd story as&#xD;
this?" she cried, sharply. "You know it&#xD;
cannot be true!"&#xD;
The tone and the shake together were re-&#xD;
markably efficacious in dispelling most of the&#xD;
alarming symptoms of hysterics.&#xD;
"It is as true as can be!" said Maria,&#xD;
retreating a step. "I-I thought you'd like&#xD;
to know, miss. Master told Jim himself.-'&#xD;
and Jim tcdd me. Mr. Tyndale's been found&#xD;
murdered down at tIre creek."&#xD;
"Murdered ! - do you mean that he is&#xD;
dead?" cried Norah.&#xD;
It was a very stupid question; but people&#xD;
sk stupid questions at such times as these.&#xD;
he most brilliant of us are not generally&#xD;
brilliant in the face of an overwhelming shock,&#xD;
and to Norah, no more than to the rest of&#xD;
the household, was the immediate realization&#xD;
of such an appalling fact possible.&#xD;
"La, yes, to be sure, miss," answered Ma-&#xD;
na, opening her eyes very wide indeed. "At&#xD;
least, that's what Jim said-murdered? Of&#xD;
course, when a gentleman's murdered, he's&#xD;
dead, miss."&#xD;
"Murdered! My God! Can it be possi-&#xD;
ble?" said Norah. She put tier hands to her&#xD;
head for a moment. Her brain seemed reel-&#xD;
ing. It would be hard to enumerate all that&#xD;
flashed upon her at that instant. Arthur,&#xD;
Max, Leslie, the events of yesterday and of&#xD;
last night-much which she could not con-&#xD;
nect-came to her, as the events of his past&#xD;
life are said to come to a dying man. She&#xD;
was silent scarcely a minute, but Maria thought&#xD;
she had never seen a face so changed as hers&#xD;
was when she looked up. "Does ~1r. MiddleL&#xD;
ton know or suspect who committed the mur-&#xD;
der?" she asked - a sharp, hard4 metallic&#xD;
ring in her usually rich voice.&#xD;
"Not as I knows of, miss," answered Ma-&#xD;
ria, reluctantly. It was hard to be forced to&#xD;
confess ignorance on such an important point&#xD;
as this.&#xD;
"And Leslie-do you know whether she&#xD;
has heard it?"&#xD;
"Mistis' is in her room with her now,"&#xD;
said the girl, with bated breath. Even ~he&#xD;
felt what those words implied.&#xD;
"What!" cried Norah, "is it so certain&#xD;
as that? Great Heaven, girl! do you mean to&#xD;
tell me that Ehere is no doubt?"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="178-179" xml:id="VAC8066-00000104"/>&#xD;
178                      A DAUGHTER&#xD;
"I don't think there's any doubt, miss,"&#xD;
answered Maria-awed and almost frightened&#xD;
by the passionate vehemence of the appeal-&#xD;
"master's sent Jim for the kurroner."&#xD;
"For the what?"&#xD;
"The kurroner, miss-the man that always&#xD;
comes and sits on people when they're found&#xD;
dead4"&#xD;
"And, since he has been sent for, you&#xD;
think it is certain that Mr. Tyndale is dead?"&#xD;
"I'm sure of that, anyhow," was the an-&#xD;
swer, delivered with perfect faith, "for master&#xD;
told Jim."&#xD;
"My God! what does it mean?" said No-&#xD;
rah, under her breathe Then she looked up,&#xD;
imperious and haughty as ever "You can&#xD;
go!" she said-adding, impatiently, as the&#xD;
girl stood still, scarcely understanding her,&#xD;
"don't you hear? Your news is told-you&#xD;
can go!"&#xD;
After the indignant Maria had retired, the&#xD;
first thing Norah did was to walk across the&#xD;
room. It was a purely involuntary movement,&#xD;
born of. that impulse to act which was inher-.&#xD;
ent in her' temperament. Any thing to her&#xD;
was better, was more possible, than passive&#xD;
endurance. Any bodily effort'was preferable&#xD;
to sitting still to be rent by thoughts like&#xD;
vultures.  ' Who san think of hearing, while&#xD;
there is' any thing to do?" she often said.&#xD;
And, even when there was nothing to do-as&#xD;
in the present case-the instinct and longing&#xD;
of her nature was so much for action, that&#xD;
she rushed into movement and speech as&#xD;
other ' women rush into hysterics and tears.&#xD;
Thrilled to the core, as she was, by the ter-&#xD;
rible news she had heard, the energy of her&#xD;
character asserted itself. "What can I do?"&#xD;
was her first thought. As yet her mind re;&#xD;
fused tocredit the fact which had been forced&#xD;
upon it~' The idea that Arthur could be dead&#xD;
-.Arthur, con~rnin~ whom she had sat, till&#xD;
long past midnight, talking to Leslie-seemed&#xD;
utterly impossible, too wildly improbable to&#xD;
be true&#xD;
But, even as she thought this,, a sudden&#xD;
recollection of the shot which she had heard&#xD;
the night before came back to her, as it had&#xD;
come back to Max. That was grim evidence&#xD;
which could' not be set aside. She stopped&#xD;
short, her head thrown back; her hands inter-&#xD;
laced, her whole 'attitude suggestive of one&#xD;
drawn up short by the curb of 'some unex-&#xD;
pected thought. 'What did it mean I' That&#xD;
was what she qaked herself with quickening&#xD;
&#xD;
OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
breath. If the report which she heard-eke,&#xD;
the woman who loved him once-had been&#xD;
Arthur's death-shot, from what hand had it&#xD;
come? What midnight assassin could possi-&#xD;
bly have lain in wait for him? And he-had&#xD;
not Max said that he had left him at Strafford?&#xD;
What, then, was he doing in, or near, the&#xD;
Rosland grounds? Questions, these, which&#xD;
she was unable to answer; but they seemed&#xD;
to fire her with renewed energy, even while&#xD;
she felt an unutterable faint sickness in every&#xD;
fibre. It was 'characteristic of the woman&#xD;
that she turned suddenly, and began to dress&#xD;
with impetuous haste. "I must see Mr. Mid.&#xD;
dleton!" she said to herself. "I must know&#xD;
all that has happened!',&#xD;
But, with all her haste, she found, when&#xD;
she went down, that Mr. Middleton had gone&#xD;
back, as he* had promised, to join Captain&#xD;
Tyndale. Mrs. Middleton was still with Les-&#xD;
lie, and, of course, there was no one else to&#xD;
whom she could apply. "Where is Mr. Carl&#xD;
Middleton?" she asked, before she remem-&#xD;
bered that he had left the night before, and&#xD;
Robert stared a little as he answered to that&#xD;
effect.&#xD;
There was nothing to be done; therefore,&#xD;
but to pace the hall to and fro, and try to&#xD;
realize that which must certainly be true,&#xD;
since a pall seemed to overhang the house,&#xD;
since the very servants' came' and went aim-&#xD;
lessly with terror-stricken, curious faces, and&#xD;
the whole household machinery was plainly in&#xD;
that interesting liouleversement which a domes.&#xD;
tic calamity always causes. Not many min-&#xD;
utes had she been here, however-.-minutes&#xD;
measured off as methodic$ly by the old-fash-&#xD;
ioned English clock as if time had not ceased&#xD;
forever for one soul-when a figure becoming-&#xD;
iy arrayed in a blue dressing-gown, a figure&#xD;
which had not allowed its feelings to run away&#xD;
with it to the extent of forgetting its chignon,&#xD;
swept down the staircase and rushed to her.&#xD;
"Good Heavens, Miss Desmond!" cried&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford, with more alarming signs of&#xD;
hysterics than even Maria had displayed. "Is&#xD;
it true, this awful, 'awfut news?"&#xD;
"I am afraid it is true that Mr. Tyndale is&#xD;
dead," Norah answei~ed-and, feeling the curi-&#xD;
osity of the blue eyes bent on her, pride&#xD;
steadied her voice and hardened her face into&#xD;
an indifference as great as if she had spoken&#xD;
of some chance acquaintance of the day be-&#xD;
fore-" whether or not he has been murdered,&#xD;
I do not know."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MRS. SANDEORD'S CURIOSITY AND MALICE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"But how can he be dead?" cried Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford, "and oh, who could have murdered&#xD;
him? I thought I should faint when Ellen&#xD;
rushed upon me with the news! I told her&#xD;
it cozdd not be true! I can't believe it! Why,&#xD;
he was here last night! Miss Desmond"&#xD;
(with an assurance of tone and manner which&#xD;
Norah felt to be absolutely insolent), "I am&#xD;
confident that ~,'ou know whether or not it is&#xD;
so!"&#xD;
"I know nothing about it!" Norah an-&#xD;
swered. She had. neither time nor inclination&#xD;
to waste words on this woman. She turned&#xD;
from her with impatient. disdain, and began&#xD;
her sentinel walk again. What had happened?&#xD;
What was going on at Strafford? What had&#xD;
been the meaning of that shot? These were&#xD;
the thoughts which filled her mind. Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford's talk, full of nervousness, malice,&#xD;
and distracted curiosity, flowed by her un-&#xD;
heeded, with all its italics and exclamation-&#xD;
poihts. 7igtc-d-te~te in this fashion, Mrs. Mid-&#xD;
dieton found them when she came down.&#xD;
stairs.&#xD;
On her Mrs. Sandford flung herself with a&#xD;
wealth of condolence. " Oh, my dear, dear&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton," she cried, "what a terrible&#xD;
blow to all of us! Oh, how does our poor&#xD;
darling Leslie bear it? And oh, is it true&#xD;
-quite true-that Mr. Tyndaleis dead?"&#xD;
"It is quite true," answered Mrs. Middle.&#xD;
ton, whose pale face and tear-stained cheeks&#xD;
made her look ten years older than she had&#xD;
done the day before. She sat down with an&#xD;
air of utter exhaustion in the nearest chair.&#xD;
"Leslie bears it better than I could have ex-&#xD;
pected," she said; "but it is a fearful blow,&#xD;
to her-fearful! 'My heart bleeds for her;&#xD;
and yet, there is nothing which any one can&#xD;
do. That is the hard part of it."&#xD;
"Oh, it is terrible!" cried Mrs. SandFord&#xD;
again, her eyes expanded, her whole face full&#xD;
of the liveliest interest and curiosity. "Oh,&#xD;
dear Mrs. Middleton,'pray do tell me some-&#xD;
thing about it. I have heard nothing-abso-&#xD;
lutely nothing-but I cannot b'~lieve that Mr.&#xD;
Tyndale is really~--dead!"&#xD;
"Unfortunately, 'it is impossible 'to dis-&#xD;
believe it, unless we close our ears to the&#xD;
truth," said Mrs. Middleton. "Mr. Tyndale&#xD;
is certainly dead-my husband had seen him&#xD;
when he came back to tell me.'&#xD;
"And is it true th~tt he was murdered?"&#xD;
asked Mrs. Sandford, in an awe-struck whis-&#xD;
per.&#xD;
p&#xD;
&#xD;
179&#xD;
&#xD;
The elder lady bent her head; for a min-&#xD;
ute she could not speak. Then, in a voice&#xD;
full of tears, she said: "Yea. That is what&#xD;
makes it so hard-so horrible! He has been&#xD;
murdered. Mr. Middleton thinks there is no&#xD;
doubt of it."&#xD;
"flow?" asked Norah, speaking for the&#xD;
first time. She had paused in her walk, and&#xD;
stood leaning against the foot of the stair-&#xD;
case, her arm around a small bronze statuette&#xD;
that made a finish to the end of the balus-&#xD;
trade. As Mrs. Middleton glanced toward&#xD;
her, she thought, with a sense of repulsion,&#xD;
that the girl looked cold and utterly heart.&#xD;
less; even Mrs. Sandford's effusion had more&#xD;
"sympathy" in it than this unmoved calm.&#xD;
"Mr. Middleton could not tell exactly&#xD;
how he had been killed," she answered. "lie&#xD;
seemed to feel uncertain, and I did not press&#xD;
him for any details. The fact itself was&#xD;
enough for me, and I am sure for Les-&#xD;
lie."&#xD;
"Was he shot?" asked Norah. She&#xD;
fully understood the significance of that last&#xD;
sentence, bu$she chose to satisfy one of the&#xD;
many doubts which were harassing her mind.&#xD;
"No," answered Mrs. Nfiddleton. "My&#xD;
husband said they found a pistol,' but it was&#xD;
Mr. Tyndale's own-and he was not shot."&#xD;
"If he had a pistol, why on earth didn't&#xD;
he shoot the murderer?" cried Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
lord, with the air of one who propounds a&#xD;
perfectly new question, or makes a perfectly&#xD;
new suggestIon. "I can't conceive how he&#xD;
could have failed to do that!"&#xD;
"The fact puzzled George and Captain&#xD;
Tyndale very much," said Mrs. Middleton.&#xD;
"Altogether it is a most mysterious as well&#xD;
as a most terrible thing !-My' poor Leslie I"&#xD;
Then she turned to Miss Desmond again.&#xD;
"Leslie told me to ask if you would come to&#xD;
her for a little while," abe said, with some-&#xD;
thing even more c6ld and stately than usual&#xD;
in her niannor; and it must be confessed&#xD;
that, to Miss Desmond, she always displayed&#xD;
a considerable amount of both coldness and&#xD;
statMiness. "Will you go? "-&#xD;
"Assuredly," said Norah. She was sur-&#xD;
prised, but she did not' show it in tone or&#xD;
manner. Mrs. Sandford, 'on her parts could&#xD;
not restrain a glance of the blanket aston-&#xD;
ishment. For Leslie to send for' her sister&#xD;
after all that' she (Mrs. Sandford) had told&#xD;
her the night before, was inexplicable. "Shall&#xD;
I go at once?" Norah added, turning and&#xD;

placing one foot on the lower step of the&#xD;
staircase.&#xD;
"At once, if you will be so kind," Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton answered. "Excuse me that I do&#xD;
not accompany you, but I think Leslie wishes&#xD;
to see you alone."&#xD;

LuSLIE was alone when Norah entered her&#xD;
roam. She was lying quietly on the bed&#xD;
where Mrs. Middleton had insisted upon pla-&#xD;
cing her, and the blinds were closed-for&#xD;
what mocks and jars upon grief like sun-&#xD;
shine? But, as her sister approached, she&#xD;
raised herself, and, looking strangely white&#xD;
and eerie in the green half-light, motioned&#xD;
her to come close.&#xD;
This Norah did. She uttered no words-.&#xD;
what could she say ?-but she came, and,&#xD;
kneeling down by the slender, erect figure,&#xD;
pat her arms around it for the first time since&#xD;
they had known each other. There was some.&#xD;
thing magnetic-something strangely, if Si-&#xD;
lently, full of sympathy-in her ~ouch. It&#xD;
seemed to express more of tenderness and&#xD;
pity than many words could have done. It&#xD;
was at once strong and full of infinite gentle.&#xD;
ness-like her face, Leslie thought, as she&#xD;
turned toward it. Perhaps it was the wist.&#xD;
ful look of that face-the wistful compassion&#xD;
of its eyes - which suddenly unlocked the&#xD;
great fountain of tears that had hitherto been&#xD;
sealed in the girl'a heart. It Is certain that&#xD;
her head sank down on the shoulder which&#xD;
was at once that of a sister and a rival, and,&#xD;
with one mighty sob, the great passion of&#xD;
grief burst forth.&#xD;
Not that flow of relieving tears over which&#xD;
sympathizing friends nod their heads and say,&#xD;
"Poor thing! it will do her good!" but a&#xD;
storm of the soul like unto, that which, in&#xD;
the natural world, uproots forests and lashes&#xD;
seas into fury, leaving desolation and ruin in&#xD;
its track. It was a storm which frightened&#xD;
even Norak by the intensity and abando7z of&#xD;
its passion. Never before had she seen a&#xD;
&#xD;
human heart laid bare in such keen agony,&#xD;
such supreme desolation. It may be said,&#xD;
also, that her amazement was almost asgreat&#xD;
as her concern. Were these tears which&#xD;
flowed in torrents, these sobs which seemed&#xD;
as if they might rend the very breast asun-&#xD;
der, for the man who had not only deceived,&#xD;
but who had been willing to forsake, this&#xD;
woman who trusted him? It was something&#xD;
which the sterner nature could with difficulty&#xD;
comprehend-something which touched and&#xD;
almost awed the girl who, though she could&#xD;
be true as steel to truth, was also hard as&#xD;
iron to falsehood or deception. Nature had&#xD;
given her certain grand traits-this Norah&#xD;
Desmond-little as she may have seemed to&#xD;
show them thus far, but among these traits&#xD;
was nothing half so majestic as the great,&#xD;
generous, unselfish love which Leslie flung&#xD;
like a royal mantle over the corpse of her&#xD;
dead love.&#xD;
She felt this herself, and said as much,&#xD;
when Leslie at last regained something of&#xD;
composure-if composure that could be called&#xD;
which was little more than utter exhaustion-&#xD;
and, lifting her heavy lids, said, faintly:&#xD;
"No doubt, you think this strange; but&#xD;
I-I have forgotten every thing, except that&#xD;
I love him, and he is dead."&#xD;
"Strange!" repeated Norah, and out of&#xD;
her own proud eyes a quick, hot shower fell.&#xD;
Then the girl showed what tender impulses&#xD;
came to her sometimes; she bent her head,&#xD;
and kissed the tear-drenched hand which had&#xD;
dropped from Leslie's eyes. "If this is hu-&#xD;
man love, what must that which is divine&#xD;
be?" she said.&#xD;
"Something greater-oh, surely, far great-&#xD;
er-than we can guess!" said Leslie, throw-&#xD;
ing back her head in order to catch the white&#xD;
gleam of an ivory crucifix hanging against&#xD;
the ti,,ted wall above her bed. "Put you&#xD;
loved him too, Norab," she said, turning with&#xD;
sudden passion to her sister. "Do you mean&#xD;
to tell me that your love is dead-that love&#xD;
can ever die?"&#xD;
"Not love like yours, perhaps," said&#xD;
Norah, gently, "but mine-well, mine may&#xD;
net have been love. God knows. At all&#xD;
events, it died long age-so long ago that I&#xD;
have flO tears, save those of pity, to weep for&#xD;
Arthur Tyndale now."           -&#xD;
"I thought mine had died last night," said&#xD;
Leslie; "I thought nothing butpsin was left;&#xD;
but, you see, I was mistaken, And now it&#xD;
&#xD;
does not matter. Whatever he may have&#xD;
been, I love him-that is enough. And he is&#xD;
all mine now-mine to remember, mine to&#xD;
love, mine to weep over! If he had lived, I&#xD;
should never have seen his face more than&#xD;
once again; but, since he is dead, he is&#xD;
mine!"&#xD;
"And anger, resentment-all that you&#xD;
felt last night-are they dead, too?" asked&#xD;
Norah. "Forgive me if I speak of what I&#xD;
should not; but you set me the example."&#xD;
"I sent for yon to speak of it," said Les-&#xD;
lie. "I wanted to tell you howl have changed.&#xD;
Last night seems like a hideous dream; I&#xD;
want to put it away like a dream; I want to&#xD;
think of him only as I knew him before you&#xD;
came. I think he loved me before you came,"&#xD;
she said, wistfully.&#xD;
"lie loved you all the time!" cried Norah,&#xD;
passio~ately. "Leslie, as God hears me, I&#xD;
speak the truth in saying that. Re never&#xD;
loved me-no, not even in Germany-I know&#xD;
that now. I never suited him. You did. He&#xD;
felt this, and knew it, even when he let mad-&#xD;
ness carry him away."&#xD;
"Do not let us talk of it," said Leslie.&#xD;
"I did not want to do that. I only wanted&#xD;
to tell you that anger and pride are dead&#xD;
within me, and that I love him-I shall al-&#xD;
ways love him! It is as well, perhaps, that&#xD;
I heard the truth; but I am glad that I did&#xD;
not hear it earlier; I am very glad that no&#xD;
cloud of bitterness ever came between us.&#xD;
There is something of comfort in that."&#xD;
"Is there?" said Norab.&#xD;
She looked at the speaker, wonderingly.&#xD;
Was it true, after all, that&#xD;
- love is not love&#xD;
That alters when its alteration finds,&#xD;
Or bends with the remover to remove."&#xD;
"Regret for that which is past is worse&#xD;
than useless," she said, in a low voice; "but&#xD;
I am sorry, very sorry, that I told you any&#xD;
thing last night."&#xD;
"Sorry!" repeated Leslie. "Why are&#xD;
you sorry? Would it have been better to&#xD;
let me eat out my heart with doubt, suspi-&#xD;
cion, and jealousy-all those passions which&#xD;
come to us even while we scorn them? Would&#xD;
it have been better to let me think that you&#xD;
were-what you were not? There is nothing&#xD;
to regret. You spoke the truth in your own&#xD;
defense, and, as regards yourself, I remember&#xD;
it, but, as regards Aim-ah, it is less than&#xD;
&#xD;
nothing to me now! He is dead, and I love&#xD;
him. All is said in that."&#xD;
All was said, indeed-all of tenderness,&#xD;
of faithfulness, of love supremely beyond the&#xD;
bounds of passion or of self. Yet, at that&#xD;
moment, something like rebellion rose up in&#xD;
Norah's heart. She thought of the man who&#xD;
had so little deserved this, the silken egotist&#xD;
and epicurean, the careless trifler with all&#xD;
that men of honor hold most sacred; and&#xD;
then she thought with a curious pang of the&#xD;
other, the man of whose devotion Leslie&#xD;
guessed so little, the man who had served her&#xD;
so faithfully, the man who would have been&#xD;
so true if Fate had only granted to Aim the&#xD;
great gift of this loving heart. "Is it always&#xD;
so?" she said to herself with a quick shiver&#xD;
of passionate indignation; and, as she asked&#xD;
the question-which many a sick heart has&#xD;
asked before-Leslie turned and spoke, with&#xD;
a sudden tense sound in her voice, a sudden&#xD;
tense eagerness in her face.&#xD;
"Norah," said she, quickly, and, as she&#xD;
uttered the name, she grasped Norah's slender&#xD;
hands until the latter could have cried out&#xD;
with pain-" Norah, promise me that you will&#xD;
not misunderstand, that you will not think I&#xD;
mean any thing more than I say, when I-I&#xD;
ask you a question."&#xD;
"Ask what you please," answered Norah,&#xD;
"and I promise to answer truly, and to mis-&#xD;
understand nothing."&#xD;
"You will forgive me, I am sure," said&#xD;
Leslie, her eyes seeming to quiver and glow&#xD;
with great dilated pupils in her white face.&#xD;
"Norah, you will not misunderstand, you will&#xD;
not think.-It is this, then: you cannot have&#xD;
forgotten that, when I went to your room&#xD;
last night, you had just come in; ten minutes&#xD;
before, I had stood at my window and seen&#xD;
you cross the lawn - Norab, had you not&#xD;
parted from Arthur then?"&#xD;
"Leslie! "-despite the promise which she&#xD;
had given the moment before, Norah wrenched&#xD;
her hands out of those which held them, and&#xD;
drew back, outraged, indignant, aghast -&#xD;
"After all that I told you last night," she&#xD;
cried, her clear voice thrilling on the hushed&#xD;
atmosphere," can you ask me such a question&#xD;
as that? Do you think that I would bave&#xD;
given another interview to Arthur Tyndale,&#xD;
and an interview at such an hour and such a&#xD;
time? If you can think that of me, you must&#xD;
believe me to be utterly false!"&#xD;
"I do not think that you are false," said&#xD;

&#xD;
Leslie, simply. "I onlythought that, if you&#xD;
had seen him, you might know something-&#xD;
you might be able to throw some light on this&#xD;
horrible mystery. He was so unlike himself&#xD;
last night-he avoided me so strangely-that&#xD;
the awful thought of suicide has not left my&#xD;
mind for an instant since Aunt Mildred first&#xD;
came to me. You know "-her voice sank&#xD;
here, she shuddered in every fibre .4" that&#xD;
means the death of the soul as well as of the&#xD;
body-Norah, I shall go mad if I am forced&#xD;
to think that I"&#xD;
"There is no reason why you should think&#xD;
it for a moment," said Norah. "From what&#xD;
Mr&amp;amp; Middleton~told me a while ago, there is&#xD;
no question but that he was murdered-there&#xD;
is not one singTh indication of suicide. But&#xD;
when you talk of 'my'knowing any thing, of&#xD;
my being able to throw any light, you do not&#xD;
know what you say," she went on, with some-&#xD;
thing like a gasp in her voice. At 'that mo-&#xD;
ment, a sense of her position came to her&#xD;
like a flash of light., If Leslie opened 'her&#xD;
lips to others, if it were known that she had&#xD;
been in the neighborhood of the bridge at&#xD;
midnight, what might not be the result 1'&#xD;
"I did not see Arthur Tyndale last night,"&#xD;
she said, '~after I left the dinner-table."&#xD;
"Yet you were in the grounds," said Les-&#xD;
lie, feverishly. "Norah, if you know any&#xD;
thing, for God's sake do not 'keep it from&#xD;
me!"&#xD;
"Why should you think that I know any&#xD;
thhlg?" asked Norah, more and more dis.&#xD;
quieted. "Leslie, for Heaven's sake, be more&#xD;
reasonable! It is true that I was later in re-&#xD;
turning to the house last night than I ought&#xD;
to have been, but I saw nothing, I heard noth-&#xD;
ing of Arthur Tyndale. 'Do you not believe&#xD;
me? Shall I take that crncifix'and swear to&#xD;
my ignorance on it?"&#xD;
"No," answea~ed Leslie. "I do believe&#xD;
you. But was there no one ?-.--Did you see&#xD;
no trace of any one who might-"&#xD;
Norah's lifted hand stayed the words on&#xD;
her lip. The girl's face had grown white as&#xD;
marble. It Was like marble, also, in the 'ri-&#xD;
gidity which came 'to the beautiful features.&#xD;
For a moment, her heart seemed to stand&#xD;
still. Had she seen any one who might-she&#xD;
could not finish the sentence even to her-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
"I saw no one,"she said, after a minute-&#xD;
her voice was~ hoarse, her lips seemed stiff-&#xD;
"no ~ne whom it would be possible to con-&#xD;
&#xD;
neet with such a crime. The only person&#xD;
whom I saw was one who would have given&#xD;
his life to save Arthur Tyndale; but no' one&#xD;
who-O Leslie, do you not comprehend? Do&#xD;
you not see that, if you speak of this, you&#xD;
may plant the seed of an evil to end-God&#xD;
only knows where I On my faith and honor,&#xD;
I know nothing, I saw nothing, I heard noth-&#xD;
ing of Mr. Tyndale's death-for it seems that&#xD;
a shot which I heard had no connection with&#xD;
it. I went thnre simply and solely to serve&#xD;
you. Leslie, will you repay me by throwing&#xD;
you know not what of suspicion on me or&#xD;
on some one as innocent as I am?"&#xD;
"Throw suspicion on ~ou!~~ repeated Les-&#xD;
lie, stricken aghast. "Norab, are' you mad?&#xD;
How can you misunderstand me so utterly-&#xD;
so horribly? How can you think I meant to&#xD;
ask-to imply-"&#xD;
"I do not think you meant to imply any&#xD;
thing," said Norah, who was trembling in&#xD;
every limb; "but, 0 Leslie, promise me that&#xD;
you will give no hint of this. It would be&#xD;
too terrible if any, one were-promise rue you&#xD;
will say nothing! Remember," cried she,&#xD;
clutching eagerly at a plea which at another&#xD;
time she would never have made, "that my&#xD;
good nameis in your hands; and, oh, promise&#xD;
-promise me!"&#xD;
Her eagerness might have defeated its&#xD;
own end, and wakened the suspicior~ of a&#xD;
suspicious nature; but, farthest in the world&#xD;
from a suspicious nature was Leslie Grahame.&#xD;
The charity which "thinketh no evil" was&#xD;
hers in* superlative degree. Suspect I Sus-&#xD;
pect the sister whose arms were round her,&#xD;
whose limpid eyes met her own-there was&#xD;
nothing which she could not sooner have&#xD;
done. She answered, 'therefore, ~out of the&#xD;
fullness of her heart:&#xD;
"I can promise-I do promise, if you wish&#xD;
it, but I never thought of speaking to any one&#xD;
else. I sent for you in order that I mighty ask&#xD;
you, and you alone. I was tormented by the&#xD;
thought that you might knw something which&#xD;
would tell me - a little - how he died. 0&#xD;
Norah "- she threw here&amp;amp;If on her sister's&#xD;
shoulder, the agony of tears And sobs broke&#xD;
forth afresh-" it is this which is so unutter-&#xD;
ably terrible! It is never to know how he&#xD;
died, never to have another glance, word, or&#xD;
tone, even in farewell! If I had only' known&#xD;
last night-ah, if I had only known! To&#xD;
have one last good-by to remember, would be&#xD;
better' than this awful silence and strange&#xD;
&#xD;
ness. Oh ! "-with a long, shuddering gasp&#xD;
-" why had I not instinct enough to take&#xD;
that last good-by I"&#xD;
And Norah was not able to say, "It is&#xD;
better so!,' though she knew that for such a&#xD;
blow to cut sharp and clean, is far better than&#xD;
a prolonged agony of foreboding suspense.&#xD;
People talk of "preparation," but in reality&#xD;
there is no such thing. It a surgeon were&#xD;
going to amputate your limb, would you like&#xD;
him to hack at it for an hour, iii order to pre-&#xD;
pare you for the final operation?&#xD;
"It will not kill me," Leslie said, after&#xD;
a while, piteously. "Grief is not merciful&#xD;
enough to kill. No doubt I shall live through&#xD;
the agony as others have done before. But&#xD;
oh, the bitterness, the anguish of thinking&#xD;
that I did not even say, 'Good-night!"'&#xD;
-4----&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
"To-morrow is a day too far&#xD;
To trust, whatever the day be.&#xD;
We know, a little, what we are;&#xD;
But who knows what lie may be?&#xD;
'Tis God made man, no doubt, not Chance:&#xD;
He made us great and small;&#xD;
But, being made, 'tis Circumstance&#xD;
That finishes us all."&#xD;
Seen an event as the death of Mr. Tyn-&#xD;
dale, of Straft'ord, coukl not do other than&#xD;
make an immediate and very great sensation&#xD;
in his native county. That it became known&#xD;
very soon, and very widely, will not surprise&#xD;
those who have seen how quicklynews passes&#xD;
from lip to lip, and plantation to plantation,&#xD;
in country districts. Mr.-M~,,,ddleton's excited&#xD;
messenger galloping full-speed to Wexford&#xD;
for the coroner, took care to communicate&#xD;
his intelligence to every man, woman, and&#xD;
child, whom he met; and from Wexford it-&#xD;
self the news soon spread in a hundred 'dif-&#xD;
ferent channels. In less than an hour after&#xD;
Mr. Middleton and Max parted on the bridge,&#xD;
the nearest neighbors of the dead man 'made&#xD;
their appearance on the scene; and, after&#xD;
that, friends, acquaintances, relations, and&#xD;
connections, poured in by the score. The&#xD;
coroner, coming over at once-for, when a&#xD;
man of wealth and position has been mur-&#xD;
dered at his own thre~old, officials are not&#xD;
likely to delay, as they are sometimes known&#xD;
to do in eases of inferior humanity-the cor-&#xD;
oner, I say, coming over at once, had no ~dif-&#xD;
&#xD;
faculty in obtaining his jury, and the inquest&#xD;
took place imtnediately.&#xD;
No new facts were elicited. The marks&#xD;
of the struggle on the sward at the side of&#xD;
the bridge, the footprints at the extreme edge&#xD;
of the bank, the broken sod showing so dis-&#xD;
tinctly the very spot from which Arthur had&#xD;
apparently been cast over into the chasm,&#xD;
the slight print of the body on the damp sand&#xD;
where he fell, the evident correspondence of&#xD;
the wound with the shape of the stone around&#xD;
which were the traces of blood-all was so&#xD;
obvious at one glance that the most stupid&#xD;
of the jurors found no difficulty in perceiving&#xD;
and understanding, and no excuse for differ.&#xD;
ence of opinion. liven the physician, attend-&#xD;
ing professioiially-a pompous man, who was&#xD;
in the habit of indulging, on such occasions,&#xD;
in long disquisitions~ interlarded with many&#xD;
high-sounding technical terms, upon the va-&#xD;
rious probabilities and possibilities as to the&#xD;
cause of death-was for once reduced to the&#xD;
necessity of expressing a plain fact in plain&#xD;
words.&#xD;
As soon as the inspection of the locale had&#xD;
been made the body was removed to Strafford,&#xD;
the jury accompanying, more for the conven-&#xD;
ience of holding their deliberation in com-&#xD;
fortable quarters than from any necessity for&#xD;
further examination of the remains. Before&#xD;
twelve o'clock they had brought in their ver-&#xD;
~dict to the effect that "the deceased Arthur&#xD;
Tyndale came to his death from fracture of&#xD;
the skull, caused by having been violently&#xD;
thrown against the sharp point of a stone by&#xD;
some person or persons unknown."&#xD;
Beyond this verdict, neither the jury it-&#xD;
self, nor the large number of attendant friends,&#xD;
was abJe to advance even a conjecture. Who&#xD;
the assailant and murderer had been, no one&#xD;
was able to imagine. There were none of the&#xD;
usual surmises and opinions afloat. Men&#xD;
seemed for once silenced by the mystery en-&#xD;
veloping the whole affair. That they talked&#xD;
a great deal, no one who has ever seen such&#xD;
an assemblage on such an ocCasion will be&#xD;
able to doubt; but out of all their talk no&#xD;
single suggestion of any importance catne-&#xD;
no single opinion worth a moment's attention&#xD;
was-elicited. From his position in the house,&#xD;
Max had to bear the brunt of much of this&#xD;
talk, and to endure, as be~t he could, a great&#xD;
deal of very useless and aimless questioning.&#xD;
In dealing with these questions, he was more&#xD;
curt than was either exactly courteous or ex-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
THE VERDICT.&#xD;
&#xD;
183&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="184-185" xml:id="VAC8066-00000107"/>&#xD;
184                      A DAUGHTER&#xD;
aetly prudent. Iii fact, he was not only&#xD;
wretched-..full of a grief which can scarcely&#xD;
be exaggerated-but he was horribly at a loss&#xD;
what to do or say. If b&amp;amp; acknowledged his&#xD;
presence in the Rosland grounds the night&#xD;
before, how could he account for this pres-&#xD;
ence without bringing Norah's name into a&#xD;
notoriety which would be fatal to it-a noto-&#xD;
riety from which every instinct of the gentle-&#xD;
man shrank ?-and, if he did sot acknowledge&#xD;
it, his silencewould certainly bear a very sin-&#xD;
gular and suspicious seeming, in case the fact&#xD;
was discovered. It was a position which&#xD;
might have sorely pnzr.led any man. Yet it&#xD;
did not puzzle Max in the sense of leaving&#xD;
him in doubt what to do. There was no hesi-&#xD;
tation about that. He must shield Norah at&#xD;
any cost. But the burden of concealment&#xD;
sat uneasily on him, and he chafed under it.&#xD;
Every time that the pistol was mentioned, he&#xD;
felt an almost irresistible impulse to say, "I&#xD;
heard that shot;" and it required an effort to&#xD;
restrain the words. lie did not forget that&#xD;
he had uttered them to Mr. Middleton on an&#xD;
impulse which he afterward regretted; but he&#xD;
was relieved to observe that Mr. Middleton,&#xD;
who had paid little attention at the time, had&#xD;
apparently suffered the fact to escape entirely&#xD;
from his memory.&#xD;
One fact had, also, entirely escaped Max's&#xD;
memory, or, to speak more correctly, had not&#xD;
yet occurred to it. This was the fact that, in&#xD;
ease of Arthur's dying intestate-which thei'e&#xD;
was every reasonable probability to suppose&#xD;
that he had done-he (Max) succeeded to the&#xD;
Tyndale estate aS heir-at-law, If he did not&#xD;
think of it, however, there were plenty of&#xD;
others who did. Next to* the mysterious&#xD;
death itself~ the question of heirship was the&#xD;
great topic on every tongue. This was natu-&#xD;
ral enough. Such things have been since the&#xD;
world began, and will doubtless be as long as&#xD;
the world endures, unless the socialists get&#xD;
the upper hand, and take care that a man has&#xD;
no estate to leave, no probable last will and&#xD;
testament to be canvassed before the breath&#xD;
has fairly left his lips. Solemn and long.&#xD;
faced as Arthur's friends and kinsmen were,&#xD;
their grief was not so absorbing but that they&#xD;
were able to take a very lively interest in won-&#xD;
dering whether he had ever thought of making&#xD;
a will, or whether the young soldier, and half-&#xD;
foreigner, whom none of them particularly&#xD;
liked, was to fall heir to the rich inherit-&#xD;
a~ce.&#xD;
&#xD;
The day-which chanced to be Sunday-&#xD;
seemed of the length of many days, both at&#xD;
Strafford and Rosl,,nd. At the former place,&#xD;
It was more like a hideous nightmare than&#xD;
any thing else-at least, to Max-servants dis-&#xD;
traught, people thronging everywhere-filling&#xD;
with a strange tide of life the quiet old rooms,&#xD;
the halls, the piazzas-and Arthur lying in&#xD;
state apai~t from all, with the majestic calm&#xD;
of death on his fair, handsome face.&#xD;
Mr. Middleton did not go home to lunch-&#xD;
eon, not because he was not hungry, not be-&#xD;
cause he would not have been heartily glad&#xD;
of a little quiet and rest, but because he&#xD;
shrank with all the proverbial and universal&#xD;
cowardice of his sex from the tears which, he&#xD;
was well aware, reigned supreme at Rosland.&#xD;
Instead of luncheon, dinner was served at&#xD;
Strafford for half a hundred people (more or&#xD;
less), unlimited eating and drinking being a&#xD;
recognized consequence of death in the coun-&#xD;
try districts, where old customs and traditions&#xD;
still linger. After dinner, Mr. Middleton es-&#xD;
caped from one or two inveterate talkers who&#xD;
had clung to him all the morning, and took&#xD;
his meerschaum and himself out on the ter-&#xD;
race where Arthur and Norah had stood when&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford overheard their conversation&#xD;
from the library-window. All was quiet and&#xD;
still there. The old - fashioned flower - gar-&#xD;
den, neglected and overgrown, but still beau-&#xD;
tiful, lay immediately below; the shadows&#xD;
were long, the afternoon was. full of golden&#xD;
serenity and bcauty-it seemed impossible to&#xD;
realize that death was so near, that the mas-&#xD;
ter of all these fair acres could now only&#xD;
claim the allotted six feet of earth to which&#xD;
every child of man is entitled.&#xD;
While Mr.. Middleton sighed and smoked,&#xD;
and smoked and sighed-thinking now of&#xD;
Leslie and now of Arthur-a quiet footstep&#xD;
came round the house and advanced toward&#xD;
him. Being slightly deaf, and not listening&#xD;
besides, he did not hear it, and it was not&#xD;
until an unexpected voice at his side said,&#xD;
"Can I speak to you a moment sir?" that&#xD;
he started and turned.&#xD;
Then he saw that it was Arthur's English&#xD;
servant who had addressed him.&#xD;
"Well, Giles," he said-" I believe your&#xD;
name is Giles, isn't it ?-what do you want?"&#xD;
"I should like to speak to you, if you&#xD;
please, sir," repeated Giles, respectfully.&#xD;
"Very well," was the careless reply,&#xD;
speak away I Though you had better have&#xD;
&#xD;
gone to Captain Tyndale if you have any&#xD;
business on hand."&#xD;
"I couldn't 'ave gone to Captain Tyndale,&#xD;
sirbecause I want to speak to you about&#xD;
Captain Tyndale," responded Giles, solemnly.&#xD;
"About Captain Tyndale-indeed 1" said&#xD;
Mr. Middleton. He looked up, at this, with&#xD;
more attention. What did the fellow mean?&#xD;
The fellow in question looked pale and a tri-&#xD;
fle agitated, but also determined, and ani-&#xD;
mated, perhaps, by that "sense of duty"&#xD;
which plays such an important part in the re-&#xD;
solves of his betters.&#xD;
"I 'ave nothing against Captain Tyndale&#xD;
in any way, sir," he said, meeting Mr. Mid-&#xD;
dletou's glance. "lie 'as been a gentleman&#xD;
to me in every way, and I wishes him no ill&#xD;
in the world; but duty i~ duty, sir, and that&#xD;
I'm sure you'll agree to."&#xD;
"Ceitainly," said Mr. Middleton. "I'll&#xD;
agree to it with pleasure. 'Duty is duty,&#xD;
unquestionably, and should always be per.&#xD;
formed, even if it is not particularly agree-&#xD;
able. But what has your duty to do with&#xD;
Captain Tyndale?"&#xD;
"It 'as this, sir: that I'm of the opinion.&#xD;
that it's my duty to let the gentlemen who&#xD;
'ave been sitting on Mr. Tyndale's body know&#xD;
certain things what came to my knowledge&#xD;
last night, sir-quite accidental, as one may&#xD;
say."&#xD;
"Facts about his death?" said Mr. Mid~&#xD;
dleton, startled into interest at once. "Of&#xD;
courRe, if you know any thing abo'it that, it&#xD;
is your duty to tell it immediately. The jury&#xD;
of inquest are done with the case; but, if you&#xD;
know any thing about how Mr. Tyndale came&#xD;
to his death-any thing of real importance-&#xD;
you can go to a magistrate and give your evi-&#xD;
dence on oath. Give it to pie first, however,&#xD;
and let me judge of its value. Now, what&#xD;
is it?"&#xD;
Thus energetically brought to the point,&#xD;
Giles-who, to do him justice, evinced no dis-&#xD;
position to fall back-made a plain state.&#xD;
ment of the facts, with which the reader is&#xD;
already acquainted- of the altercation be-&#xD;
tween the two cousins, which, according to&#xD;
his testimony, had reached the point of per.&#xD;
sonal contest when he surprised them; of&#xD;
Captain Tyndale's leaving the house; of Ar.&#xD;
thur's following him; of the return of the&#xD;
former cdone some time after midnight. Told&#xD;
simply, and, as the man averred, honestly,&#xD;
without any ill-feeling toward Max, the story&#xD;
&#xD;
was even more effective that if it had been&#xD;
freely colored by suspicion or partisanship.&#xD;
"It's my duty to my dead master, sir, to tell&#xD;
what I know, and that's what I know," he&#xD;
said, in conclusion. As for Mr. Middleton,&#xD;
he was amazed, startled, aghast, and yet in-&#xD;
credulous. lie attached very little impor-&#xD;
tance to the account of the quarrel-setting&#xD;
most of it down to the exaggeration which&#xD;
seems inherent in the serving nature-and he&#xD;
did not believe for a moment that Max had&#xD;
borne any part in his cousin's death; but he&#xD;
was certainly confounded by the circumstan-&#xD;
tial evidence thus abruptly brought forward&#xD;
against him. "Good Heavens I" he said to&#xD;
himself. Here was a new element of trouble&#xD;
-an element which he must, if possible, nip&#xD;
in the bud. Hence, after a minute's reflec-&#xD;
tion, he turned to Giles:&#xD;
"It is an excellent thing, and shows your&#xD;
discretion, that you came privately to me&#xD;
with this story," he said, gravely. "I do&#xD;
full justice to your motives, which I am sure&#xD;
are good ones; but you are entirely wrong in&#xD;
your conclusions, and might have done great&#xD;
mischief if you had expressed them publicly.&#xD;
It is impossible to connect Captain Tyndale&#xD;
in any way with his cousin's death, and the&#xD;
events which seem so important to you strike&#xD;
me in the light of mere coincidences. They&#xD;
would have no legal valuelam sure; but&#xD;
they might cause a great deal of scandal and&#xD;
gossip. Therefore, if you wish to serve your&#xD;
master as well as Captain Tyndale, you can&#xD;
best do so by holding your tongue."&#xD;
Giles's face fell a little. He looked disap-&#xD;
pointed and-obstinate. Mr. Middleton saw&#xD;
the first expression: the latter escaped his&#xD;
observation.&#xD;
"I am sure you mean well," he said again,&#xD;
with emphasis. "But this story must go no&#xD;
farther. Understand that. It is a family&#xD;
matter, of which nothing must be said."&#xD;
"I can't help thinking that it's my duty,&#xD;
sir, to let the jury know," said Giles, with&#xD;
some of the obstinacy of his face creeping&#xD;
into his tone, and asserting itself very distinct.&#xD;
ly there.&#xD;
"The jury be hanged, sir, and your duty,&#xD;
too I" said Mr. Middleton, angrily. "Do you&#xD;
mea~z to set your judgment up against misc?&#xD;
The jury have brought in their verdict, and&#xD;
their business is done. Yours is done, too,&#xD;
when you have brought your story and told&#xD;
it to rue. The responsibility of acting or not&#xD;

acting upon it is my affair No one could&#xD;
have better, reason for desiring to discover&#xD;
the murderer of your master than I have;&#xD;
but, as for crediting an absurdity like this-&#xD;
Again I repeat that your motives are no doubt&#xD;
good, but I don't wish to hear any more of&#xD;
the subject."&#xD;
"Very well, sir," said Giles. ." I am sor-&#xD;
ry to have troubled you. I'll take care not&#xD;
to trouble you again."&#xD;
"The trouble is of no importance,~~ said&#xD;
Mr. Middleton. "You were right to come to&#xD;
me. I only wish you to understand that the&#xD;
matter is to go no further."&#xD;
Giles made nn reply. He took his div.&#xD;
missal very quietly and walked away; but, if&#xD;
Mr. Middleton had seen his face and read its&#xD;
expression rightly, he would not have enter-&#xD;
tained any very sanguine expectations of his&#xD;
letting the matter go no furthers&#xD;
In truth, Giles was as deteFinined as a&#xD;
man could be that, since Mr. Middleton de-&#xD;
clined to act for him, he would act for him.&#xD;
self. A sense of duty had something, per-&#xD;
haps, to do with this resolution, and sincere&#xD;
regard for his master had more; but, most&#xD;
of all, was the important sense of possessing&#xD;
a clew to the mysterious murder which no one&#xD;
else possessed. Holding this clew-this posi-&#xD;
tive knowledge-should he make no use of&#xD;
it? "The man what knows of a crime, and&#xD;
conCeals a crime, as good as commits it," said&#xD;
Giles, solemnly. Where he had learned this&#xD;
scrap of legal or other kind of wisdom, it is&#xD;
impossible to say; but he was fnlly resolved&#xD;
to act upon it.&#xD;
Before taking any further steps, however,&#xD;
he waited until Mr. Middleton left Strafford-&#xD;
which that gentleman did in the course of the&#xD;
afternoon. "I'll go home, take a little rest,&#xD;
and be back to-night," he said, as he 'shook&#xD;
hands with Max at parting. "Not bnt tl~at&#xD;
you'll have enough and more than enough&#xD;
people on your hands."&#xD;
"I suppose so," said Max, who looked as&#xD;
thoroughly broken down as a man with strong&#xD;
fibres and strong nerves ever appears. The&#xD;
excitement and "worry" of the day, 1'ollow-&#xD;
ing close upon the terrible shook of the morn-&#xD;
ing, had tried him almost beyond endurance.'~&#xD;
Mr. Middleton, who had thought of giving&#xD;
him a hint concerning Giles's story, had&#xD;
enough of kindly disereti~n to hold his&#xD;
tongue when he noticed how pale and woi~n&#xD;
he looked. He left without having said any&#xD;
&#xD;
OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
thing, and Max, not long afterward, went to&#xD;
his own room and locked himself in-I-to rest,&#xD;
he said.&#xD;
In this way, the coast was left clear for&#xD;
Giles, who, from his position in the back-&#xD;
ground, was keeping his eyes and cars very&#xD;
well open indeed. Having failed so utterly&#xD;
with Mr. Middleton, he made up his mind&#xD;
that the next person to whom he applied&#xD;
should be of an entirely different stamp from&#xD;
that worthy gentleman He had sense ~nougli&#xD;
to know that his story would not be likely to&#xD;
receive much more attention from a magis-&#xD;
trate than it had already received from Mr.&#xD;
Middleton, unless he was supported by some&#xD;
gentleman of influence, and, if possible, a&#xD;
connection of the murdered man. There&#xD;
were several connections of the murdered&#xD;
man in the house, and one, in especial, was&#xD;
of marked influence and position~. This was&#xD;
a distant cousin of Arthur's-one of the dis-&#xD;
agreeable relations concerning whom he had&#xD;
once spoken to Leslie, and with irhom his in-&#xD;
tercourse during life had always been as dis-&#xD;
tant as their relationship. The name of this&#xD;
gentleman was Colville, and, though he was&#xD;
an eminently unpleasant man, he was one of&#xD;
the men who seem to mount in life on the&#xD;
score of their very unpleasantness&amp;amp; Nothing,&#xD;
perhaps, in human nature is more marked&#xD;
than the tendency to allow itself to be brow-&#xD;
beaten and bullied by almost any man who&#xD;
possesses sufficient force of character for the&#xD;
purpose. Force of character Mr. Colville cer-&#xD;
tainly possessed, united to aggressively vio-&#xD;
lent opinions on every possible' subject, and an&#xD;
indomitable obstinacy. He was a man who&#xD;
"owned" half the county, people said. They&#xD;
did not mosn its literal acres, but its flesh-&#xD;
and-blood inhabitants. What of such and&#xD;
such a man? somebody would say, and the&#xD;
t~nswcr would be, "Oh, he belongs to Col-&#xD;
ville!', In other words, Mr. Colville had sue-&#xD;
; ceded in reducing a certain number of his&#xD;
ellow - citizens to the condition of puppets,&#xD;
who moved with exemplary obedience aS he&#xD;
pulled their strings. With this kind of man&#xD;
there are only two courses open-you arc his&#xD;
subject or his opponent. Arthur Tyndalc&#xD;
had never been a subject, therefore Mr. Col-&#xD;
yule at least had always reckoned him an op-&#xD;
ponent. Of Max this gentleman knew little,&#xD;
but that little was, in his opinion, of a dis-&#xD;
paraging character. Since his arrival at&#xD;
Strafford, his harsh voice had been chiefly&#xD;
&#xD;
heard in loud disapproval of every thing&#xD;
which had been done, and protest against&#xD;
every thing which it was proposed to do.&#xD;
This was the man to whom Giles went with&#xD;
a request for a private interview.&#xD;
It is almost unnecessary to say that Mr.&#xD;
Colville at once acceded to this request.&#xD;
Nothing gratified him more than such an ap-&#xD;
peal. He left a group, whom he was instruct-&#xD;
ing in their social, moral, and political duties,&#xD;
to enter the library, seat himself in Arthur's&#xD;
favorite chair, and bid Giles, in his loud, pa.&#xD;
tronizing voice, "speak out."&#xD;
This Giles, whQ was by no means troubled&#xD;
with diffidence, proceeded to do. He told his&#xD;
story as he had told it to Mr. Middleton, sim-&#xD;
ply and without pretense. Again he laid&#xD;
stress upon the fact that he had "nothing&#xD;
against" Captain Tyndale; It was a pure sense&#xD;
of duty )vhich urged him to make this state-&#xD;
ment, he said; and, indeed, to do Giles justice,&#xD;
he was undoubtedly buoyed up by a conscious-&#xD;
ness of disinterested virtue, which was, in a&#xD;
certain sense, its own reward.&#xD;
After the cold water which Mr Middleton&#xD;
had thrown on his story, it was unquestion-&#xD;
ably gratifying to excite such vivid interest&#xD;
and belief as that which made Mr. Colville's&#xD;
grizzly hairs stand on end. No thought of&#xD;
incredulity caine to him. Amazement, cer-&#xD;
tainly-horror, perhaps-disgust at his own&#xD;
obtuseness in a measure; but not incredulity&#xD;
in the least degree.&#xD;
"Good God!" he said, when he found&#xD;
voice to speak at last. "Who would have&#xD;
believed it? Here, under my very eyes, and&#xD;
nobody to suspect such a thing for a minute!&#xD;
Even I-I never tothink of it! You should&#xD;
have spoken to me before," he said, turning&#xD;
sternly upon Giles. "What on earth do you&#xD;
mean by letting the whole day pass, and wait-&#xD;
ing until sunset, before you open your mouth&#xD;
to give such important information as this?"&#xD;
"I did speak before, sir," said Giles, who&#xD;
was deeply offended by such a mode of ad-&#xD;
dress. "I went to Mr. Middleton, but he&#xD;
didn't Seem' to think the story worth any at-&#xD;
tention."&#xD;
"Mr. Middleton!" repeated Mr. Colville,&#xD;
in a tone of inexpressible scorn. "What the&#xD;
devil put it into your head to go to Mr. Mid.&#xD;
dleton? If you had wanted to find an incom-&#xD;
petent person, you couldn't have done better;&#xD;
And pray what did'Mr. Middleton say?"&#xD;
"He said I had better hold my tongue,&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. COLVILL&#xD;
&#xD;
E AND GILES.                         187&#xD;
sir.-.-that the story would only make scandal&#xD;
and gossip-but I had a sense of duty, sir;&#xD;
and I couldn't think but what I ought to state&#xD;
the facts."&#xD;
"hold your tongue! Heaven and earth!"&#xD;
said Mr. Colville, his gray hair bristling more&#xD;
and move on his scantily-covered head -.--" I&#xD;
never heard any thing to equal it!" he said,&#xD;
with indignation rising hotter. "That any&#xD;
man, with the least sense of duty, should en-&#xD;
deavor or desire to conceal such' a crime-it&#xD;
is almostt incredible! To conceal a crime is&#xD;
to connive at it!', said he, bending his bushy.&#xD;
gray eyebrows and small gray eyes in a terrify.&#xD;
ingmanner upon poor Giles. "It isagood thing&#xD;
that you did not take Mr. Middleton's most&#xD;
extraordinary-I may even say, most criminal&#xD;
-advice! It is a good thing that you came&#xD;
to me. But it would have been a better thing&#xD;
if you had not wasted time, if you had come&#xD;
tomcat once!"&#xD;
"I'm sorry I did not, sir," said Giles, over-&#xD;
awed, as Mr. Colville mostly did overawe those&#xD;
with whom he came in contact. "But I knew&#xD;
Mr. Middleton best, and Mr. Tyndale was en-&#xD;
gaged to his niece, and so I thought-"&#xD;
"There is no time to waste in' excuses,'&#xD;
said Mr. Colville, waving his hand. "You&#xD;
should have known my position in the family&#xD;
sufficiently to come to me at once. Now, go&#xD;
and find Mr. Armistead and tell him that I&#xD;
wish to see him-here in the library. Hold&#xD;
yourself in readiness to ride 'to Wexfor~l with&#xD;
him in th~ course of the next hour, and take&#xD;
care that you don't open your lips, so that a&#xD;
word of this comes to Captain Tyndale's ears."&#xD;
"I shall take care, sir," said Giles, meekly.&#xD;
He went in search of Mr. Armistead-an-&#xD;
other connection of the family, and loyal vas-&#xD;
sal to Mr. Colville-whom he found on the&#xD;
front portico, listening to a voluble gentleman,&#xD;
who was proving, to his own entire satisfac-&#xD;
tion, that Arthur's death' had been purely ac-&#xD;
cidental. "Yes," Mr. Armistead was saying,&#xD;
meditatively, "I quite agree with you;" when&#xD;
Giles summoned him away to the presence of&#xD;
his dictatorial chief. He was a pleasant, gentle.&#xD;
manly man, of mild temper and indolent hab-&#xD;
its, who found that it saved trouble tO be gov~&#xD;
erned by his wife at home and by Mr. Colville&#xD;
abroad - a man whose abilities might have'&#xD;
helped him to a very fair position in the world,&#xD;
if he had not chanced early in life upon the&#xD;
misfortune ofmarrying an heiress. That fact&#xD;
had crushed all active manhood out of, him,&#xD;

188                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.                                                 THE CAPTAIN'S ARREST.               189&#xD;
&#xD;
as it has crushed it out of many another&#xD;
man. "I suppose I ma~ be allowed a word&#xD;
about the management of the property, Mr.&#xD;
Artuistead, since Ibrought it into the fami-&#xD;
ly!" his sharp - tongued better - half would&#xD;
say. "As many words as you please, my&#xD;
dear," Mr. Armistead would answer, taking&#xD;
up his gun -hunting and shooting were the&#xD;
only things in which he really felt an interest&#xD;
-and walking away. This was the man whom&#xD;
Mr. Colville summoned to hIs privy council,&#xD;
and who strolled into the library with his&#xD;
hands in his pockets, and an air of exceeding&#xD;
listlessness on his face. The listlessness died&#xD;
away, however, when he saw the bent brows&#xD;
and bristling hairs which made Mr. Colville's&#xD;
visage a thing of terror and dismay.&#xD;
"What is the matter, Colville?" he cried.&#xD;
"What the deuce has happened?"&#xD;
Mr. Colville frowned majestically. He&#xD;
was swelling with a sense of ~gnified im-&#xD;
portance, on which the other's free-and-easy&#xD;
question jarred.&#xD;
"What has happened," he said, "is not a&#xD;
subject for levity. Even ignorant levity may&#xD;
sometimes be very ill-advised."&#xD;
"I was not aware that I had displayed any&#xD;
particular levity," said Mr. Armistead, care-&#xD;
lessly. "I only asked what had happened;&#xD;
a man may do that without giving offense, I&#xD;
suppose."&#xD;
"Nothing has happened-at least nothing&#xD;
new," said Mr Colville, after a minute - he&#xD;
disliked few things more than to answer a&#xD;
question, or enter upon an explanation; but&#xD;
sometimes, as in the present instance, he was&#xD;
obliged to do it-" I have only received posi-&#xD;
tive information touching the murder of poor&#xD;
Tyndale."&#xD;
"The devil you have !~" cried Mr. Armi-&#xD;
stead, excited for once. "By George! Why,&#xD;
Denton has just been trying to prove th~tt he&#xD;
was killed accidentally."&#xD;
"Denton's a fool I" said Mr. ColvilIe,&#xD;
sharply. And people who waste their time&#xD;
listening to him are not much better! I&#xD;
knew, of course - any man with eyes must&#xD;
have known - that Tyndale had been mur-&#xD;
dered; but I confess that I did not think of&#xD;
attaching suspicion to the very man whom a&#xD;
child might have suspected-the man who, in&#xD;
all probability will profit so largely ~nd ex-&#xD;
clusively by his death."&#xD;
Mr. Armistead had sat lazily down in a&#xD;
Qhair after the rebuke to his levity; he sprang&#xD;
&#xD;
now to his feet, as completely astonished, as&#xD;
thoroughly startled, as a man could be ira-&#xD;
agined.&#xD;
"Great Heaven 1" he said. Do you mean&#xD;
Max Tyndale? Is it possible you suspect Max&#xD;
Tyndale 1"'&#xD;
"I did not say that I suspected any thing,&#xD;
but that I kneu' the truth," responded Mr.&#xD;
Colville, sharply If Giles was not a parti-&#xD;
san, he eertainl~ was. There are some people&#xD;
to whom an impartial frame of mind, even for&#xD;
five minutes, is impossible.&#xD;
"I suppose you have no objection to let-&#xD;
ting me hear what your grounds of belief&#xD;
are?" said Mr. Armistead, sitting down&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"Since you are, in a measure, a connection&#xD;
of the family "-Mrs. Armistead had been a&#xD;
Miss Colville, and a forty-second cousin of&#xD;
Arthur-" I sent for you for- that purpose,"&#xD;
said Mr. Colville, magisterially. He then re-&#xD;
capitulated what Giles had told him-a rela-&#xD;
tion which, as it may be imagined, took lib-&#xD;
eral color from his own- belief, and therefore&#xD;
impressed his hearer even more strongly than&#xD;
it would otherwise have done. The train of&#xD;
circumstances was clear enough, however, to&#xD;
have impressed any one-especially a man of&#xD;
indolent mind, who usually liked his thinking&#xD;
done for him. When the story was ended,&#xD;
Mr. Armistead agreed that the events were&#xD;
"suspicious-very suspicious, indeed!" but&#xD;
he ventured to add a hope that tl~e other did&#xD;
not mean to "make them public.'~&#xD;
"Not make them public!" repeatedly Mr.&#xD;
Colville, the blood rushing into his face, an-&#xD;
grily, his hairs bristling again. "I shall cer-&#xD;
tainly see that the evidence is brought before&#xD;
a magistrate as soon as possible, if that is&#xD;
what you call making it public! I have a&#xD;
sense of duty, sir; and to allow a murderer&#xD;
to go scot - free, because his apprehension&#xD;
might reflect discredit on the family, is some.&#xD;
thing that I have no idea of doing."&#xD;
"Well, what the deuce do you want with&#xD;
me?" said Mr. Armistead, rather more snap.&#xD;
pishly than he usually spoke. "You are a&#xD;
magistrate: you can take the matter in hand,&#xD;
and hear the evidence, if you've a mind to."&#xD;
"I ant a magistrate, it is true," said Mr.&#xD;
Colville; "but, as a member of the family, I&#xD;
should prefer that the ease was not brought&#xD;
before me. I want you, therefore, to take this&#xD;
servant and go over to Wcxford. Let him&#xD;
give his evidence before Purcell; and see that&#xD;
&#xD;
the warrant is issued as soon as possible, and&#xD;
sent out here."&#xD;
"I'll be d.-d if Idol" saidMr. Armistead,&#xD;
with a fiat rebellion for which his chief was&#xD;
wholly unprepared. "I don't call this the&#xD;
conduct of one gentleman to another gentle-&#xD;
man. Before taking the evidence of a servant&#xD;
against Captain Tyndale, it is as little as you&#xD;
could do to send for him and give him a&#xD;
chance to speak for himself."&#xD;
"A chance to saddle a horse and leave the&#xD;
cotintry, more likely!" said the other, with&#xD;
angry contempt. "One gentleman to another&#xD;
gentleman, indeed! I am not intending to&#xD;
treat Captain Tyndale as a gentleman, but as&#xD;
a criminal-which he certainly is. If you&#xD;
don't choose to take the servant to Wexford,&#xD;
however, you have only to say so, and I'll&#xD;
take him myself!"&#xD;
"Oh,,I suppose I can take him," said Mr.&#xD;
Armistead, apparently thinking better of his&#xD;
resolution. "It is not I who have to give the&#xD;
evidence. But you see how late it is !-It&#xD;
strikes me it is scarcely worth while to go&#xD;
this evening. Won't to-morrow morning an-&#xD;
swer as well?"&#xD;
"It will not answer at all," said Mr. Col-&#xD;
yule, emphatically. "There has been too&#xD;
much delay already; I'll not take the respon-&#xD;
sibility of an hour longer on my shoulders.&#xD;
If Giles had not been fool enough to go to&#xD;
Middleton, instead of coming to me, there&#xD;
would not have been the delay there has&#xD;
been!"&#xD;
-4----&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
"Most learned Judge f-A sentence; come, prepare."&#xD;
NoTwrrnsrAuDIua Mr. Colville's anxiety&#xD;
for haste, it was not until the next morning&#xD;
that a constable arrived at Strafford with a&#xD;
warrant of arrest for Captain Tyndale. His ap-&#xD;
pearance fell like a thunder-bolt on the assem-&#xD;
bled party~ To chronicle all the disjointed&#xD;
exclamations, and all the Babel of discussion&#xD;
which ensued, would be to try the patience&#xD;
of the most long-suffering reader, and would,&#xD;
moreover, serve no purpose in advancing the&#xD;
history of events. Max himself, after the&#xD;
first shock, was perhaps (with the exception&#xD;
of Mr. Colville, and one or two of his most&#xD;
intimate subjects), the person least taken by&#xD;
surprise. Not that he had definitely expected&#xD;
such a result as this, but he had been so&#xD;
&#xD;
thoroughly conscious all the day before of the&#xD;
false position in which h~s reticence was,&#xD;
placing him, that instinct may he said to have&#xD;
warned him of its consequences. Public sen-&#xD;
timent, generally, was one of disapproving&#xD;
surprise. It was an underhanded piece of&#xD;
business, men said, who, whatever their other&#xD;
faults, believed in, and, as a rule, stood up for;&#xD;
fair play. Only two or three of Mr. Colville'§&#xD;
immediate friends were found to support the&#xD;
measure. "Wait until you hear the evidence&#xD;
against him!" they said, nodding sagely.&#xD;
As for Mr. Middleton, he was overcome&#xD;
with indignation when he heard the news.&#xD;
He blamed himself severely thnt he had not&#xD;
warned Max of the story which Giles had&#xD;
brought to him. "I ought to have dorm that&#xD;
at once I "' he thought, as he went in search&#xD;
of the young man.&#xD;
He found him in his own room, dressing,&#xD;
having lain down to snatch a little sleep in&#xD;
the latter part of the night, and having been&#xD;
ruthlessly waked on the appearance of the&#xD;
constable and the warrant. If he had lost&#xD;
his composure in the first shock, he had by&#xD;
this time regained it, for he turned to Mr.&#xD;
Middleton with a coolness which excited that&#xD;
gentleman's surprise and admiration-though&#xD;
an under-current of emotion seemed vibrating&#xD;
through his voice when he spoke.&#xD;
"I suppose you have heard what has hap.&#xD;
pened," he said. "What do you think of&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"I think that I am more sorry than I can&#xD;
say that I did not warn you yesterday that&#xD;
your cousin's servant came to me with a story&#xD;
which I suppose he has since carried to more&#xD;
credulous or malicious ears, and of which this&#xD;
is the result," Mr. Middleton answered. "I&#xD;
take it for granted that you know what I&#xD;
mean. Something about a difficulty between&#xD;
Arthur and yourself."&#xD;
"Giles!" said Max, starting. A flash of&#xD;
light seemed to come to him. "So it was&#xD;
Giles, was it? I did not think of that. And&#xD;
you say he came to you with the story?"&#xD;
"He came to me yesterday afternoon, and,&#xD;
when he found that I paid no attention to it,&#xD;
he went-so I judge from what I hear down-&#xD;
stairs-to Colville. You know Colville. You&#xD;
won't be surprised to learn that he is at the&#xD;
bottom of the whole affair."&#xD;
"No, I am not surprised," said Max; but&#xD;
he stood for a minute apparently lost in&#xD;
thought. "I mean I am not surprised that&#xD;

A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
MAX'S DEFENSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Colvihle, who seems to dislike me, should&#xD;
be ready to believe any report to my dis-&#xD;
credit," he added, after a while; "but how lie&#xD;
or any one else could think lhi8-"'&#xD;
" CoIville dislikes every one who does not&#xD;
belong to him body and soul," saidMr. Mid-&#xD;
dleton, dryly; "but you need not go far to&#xD;
find a reason why he dislikes you particularly,&#xD;
or why he is ready enough to credit even this-&#xD;
you are the heir-at-law of the Tyndale estate."&#xD;
"Good God!" said Max, with uncontrol-&#xD;
lable agitttion, "but that. makes it all the&#xD;
more terrible. How can any man believe&#xD;
that I-the heir-at-law, as you say-could&#xD;
have laid violent hands on Arthur; that I&#xD;
could have left him dead and come back to&#xD;
sleep under his roof; that I could- Great&#xD;
Heaven! is it for tlzcd they suspect me of&#xD;
murdering him?" demanded he, turning upon&#xD;
Mr. Middleton, with passion and horror min-&#xD;
gled in his face.&#xD;
"It is very likely they have not stopped&#xD;
to think about it at all,"' answered the other.&#xD;
"A sort of frenzy seizes people at such times,&#xD;
you know;. a fever of suspicion and doubt.&#xD;
Colville is a sort of moral bull-dog, moreover,&#xD;
and there is no more use in appealing to his&#xD;
sense of reason than there would be in ap-&#xD;
pealing to a deaf man's ears, or a blind man's&#xD;
sight. The magistrate who issued this war-&#xD;
rant-Purcell, of Wexford-is a blockhead&#xD;
also, a~d very much under his thumb. V~ou can&#xD;
scarcely appreciate the nature of the charge&#xD;
better than I do," he went on quickly; "bnt,&#xD;
surely it will not cost you much trouble to&#xD;
prove the groundless folly-I may say the in-&#xD;
famous outrage -of it!"&#xD;
"I cannot tell," said Max. "' It ought to&#xD;
be easy; but with such men as you describe,&#xD;
who knows? One or two points may tell&#xD;
against me." He drew on his coat as he&#xD;
spoke, then paused a moment; his bronzed&#xD;
face grew paler than it had been before, his&#xD;
eyes were cast down, his hand went as usual&#xD;
to the long ends of his mustache. "Who&#xD;
knows 1"' he repeated. "There are one or&#xD;
two things which it is impossible to explain 1&#xD;
-the cause of the dispute between Arthur&#xD;
and myself, for instance." '&#xD;
"Was it a serious dispute?" asked Mr.&#xD;
Middleton, anxiously. "You will excuse the&#xD;
question, but I should like to know."&#xD;
He was interrupted by a tap at the door.&#xD;
"Ready,' sir?" asked the constable's voice ~&#xD;
on the outside.                 '&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, I am ready," answered Max.-" I&#xD;
hope I shall be able to clear myself," he said,&#xD;
turning to Mr. Middleton; "but, if not-"&#xD;
emergency," interrupted that gentleman. "I&#xD;
"I ani going along to stand by you in any&#xD;
ordered the dog-cart when I came up, and&#xD;
we'll drive over, settle that insolent English&#xD;
rascal, and bring Purcell to his senses, before&#xD;
breakfast."&#xD;
"You arc very kind," said Max, grate-&#xD;
fully; but it is likely that he had his own&#xD;
reasons for not feeling quite so sure of'ae-&#xD;
comphishing these desirable results, either&#xD;
before breakfast or after, as Mr. Middleton&#xD;
did.&#xD;
When they went down-stairs, they found a&#xD;
number of horses and buggies before the&#xD;
door, and a number of men assembled in the&#xD;
hall and portico. The whole clan were evi-&#xD;
dently intending t&amp;amp; follow the prisoner into&#xD;
Weaford. There did not breathe one man&#xD;
with soul so dead that he was not eager to&#xD;
hear the examination. Indeed, the sensation&#xD;
of to-day almost paled the sensation of yes-&#xD;
terday, and the living Tyndale suddenly be-&#xD;
came of infinitely more importance than the&#xD;
dead one, even in the eyes of the friends and&#xD;
kinsmen who had gathered to do the latter&#xD;
such scant honor and reverence as it is in the&#xD;
power of life to pay unto death. When Max&#xD;
appeared, there was a movement which was&#xD;
almost unanimous toward him~ Men pressed&#xD;
forward to shake hie hsnd warmly, to express&#xD;
indignation, sympathy, and hearty wishes for&#xD;
his speedy release.' He thanked them briefly,&#xD;
and then, accompanied by Mr. Middleton, and&#xD;
followed by 'the constable-who looked de-&#xD;
cidedly sheepish, as if he felt rather ashamed&#xD;
of his part of the business-he walked to the&#xD;
dog-cart and sprang in. They drove oiY&#xD;
rapidly, and with various degrees of speed&#xD;
avery man followed-leaving only Arthur be.&#xD;
hind, wtih the calm serenity of hi~ face un-&#xD;
mified by this paltry temult of life.&#xD;
Mr. Colville had gone on to Wexford con-&#xD;
dderably in advance of this, and, on entering&#xD;
he justice-room, neither Max nor Mr. Mid-&#xD;
hleton wa~ surprised to find him in consulta-&#xD;
:ion with a tall, gaunt, gray-whiskered gen-&#xD;
leman who was plainly thernagistrate. They&#xD;
rere both sitting behind a table on which lay&#xD;
greasy book and some papers. Giles,' look-&#xD;
ag rather uncomfortable, was standing by a&#xD;
window not far off, and had watched Captain&#xD;
~yndale's arrival. Mr Armistead was not&#xD;
&#xD;
if&#xD;
&#xD;
visible; but a dozen or so other men were&#xD;
lounging about, or gathered into knots talk.&#xD;
ing. Some of them were from the country&#xD;
others belonged to the village. These last&#xD;
stared with undisguised interest and curiosity&#xD;
at the prisoner, who was also the heir, as he en.&#xD;
tered. Mr. Middleton and himself were talk.&#xD;
lag as they easn~ in, but they broke off before&#xD;
any one could catch the subject of their con-&#xD;
versation, and the former gentleman, advan-&#xD;
cing up the room, addressed one of the minis.&#xD;
ters of justice very unceremoniously.&#xD;
"Well, Purcell," he said, "here is Captain&#xD;
Tyndale come to see what the devil you mean&#xD;
by such a confounded piece of folly as this."&#xD;
"lam glad to make Captain Tyndale's ac-&#xD;
quaintance," said Mr. Purcell, bowing gravely,&#xD;
"though I should have preferred making it&#xD;
under other circumstances. I shall be happy&#xD;
if he is able to prove that the charge brought&#xD;
against ~him is unfounded-but I am sure you&#xD;
are aware, sir" (turning to Max, who also had&#xD;
advanced), "that a magistrate is bound to do&#xD;
his duty, and that it would have been impos-&#xD;
sible for me to dismiss without examination&#xD;
such a grave chsyge as this which is brought&#xD;
against you."&#xD;
"Since the charge has been brought, it is&#xD;
of course your duty to examine it," said Max.&#xD;
"You will excuse me if I say that the sooner&#xD;
that is done the better. I cannot defend my.&#xD;
self until I know what is alleged against me.t'&#xD;
He sat down as be spoke. Every one-&#xD;
present noticed the perfect coolness of his&#xD;
manner. Yet he knew well what was coming.&#xD;
It came at once, for there was no delay in&#xD;
the proceedings. Mr. Purcell may or may not&#xD;
have been a blockhead, but he was at least a&#xD;
good magistrate-a man who did not waste&#xD;
time, who knew the law passably well, and&#xD;
who had a mind sufficiently clear to seize the&#xD;
strong points of evidence. Giles, being sum-&#xD;
moned, testified on oath to the circumstances&#xD;
which he had already related-to the "diffi-&#xD;
culty" between the two cousins, to Arthur's&#xD;
angry words and excited manner after Captain&#xD;
Tyndale had left the house, to his having seen&#xD;
him follow his cousin, and to having heard&#xD;
Max return after midnight-alone. When he&#xD;
finished, Mr. Purcell turned to Captain Tyn-&#xD;
dale and asked what he had to say in reply to&#xD;
this strong array of cia~cumstantial evidence.&#xD;
The young man rose to his feet with no&#xD;
trace of nervousness in his manner, though&#xD;
his dark eyes were glowing in his pale face.&#xD;
&#xD;
" With your permission, sir," he said,&#xD;
quietly, "I will answer by putting a question&#xD;
or two to this witness, who seems anxious to&#xD;
afford some material for gossiping wonder&#xD;
in a case so mysterious as the one under con-&#xD;
sideration-though I am sorry to be obliged&#xD;
to bring forward a fact which otherwise need&#xD;
not have transpired." Then, turning to Giles,&#xD;
he continued in the same tone:&#xD;
"What condition was your master in at&#xD;
the time of the 'difficulty~ you have just de-&#xD;
scribed?"&#xD;
Giles's face had fallen during the first part&#xD;
of the foregoing sentence. Perhaps he had&#xD;
scarcely been aware how much the motive&#xD;
attributed to him had influenced his course of&#xD;
action, until the idea was thus put into words.&#xD;
It fell still more, however, at the concluding&#xD;
interrogation. He colored, cleared his throat,&#xD;
hesitated-but Captain Tyndale's keen eye&#xD;
was on him; he answered at last, stammer-&#xD;
ingly:&#xD;
was a little-he 'ad been drinking 'a&#xD;
little too much, sir."&#xD;
"A little too much! Was that all ?"&#xD;
The man looked down; his face answered&#xD;
the question plainly enough, but his inquisi-&#xD;
tor demanded words.&#xD;
"Well?" he said.&#xD;
"He--lie wasn't at himself, sir."&#xD;
Max turned to the magistrate.&#xD;
"As I said before, I very much regret be-&#xD;
ing compelled to bring forward a fact which I&#xD;
shouldY~t have mentioned to any one-much&#xD;
less publicly-if the necessity had not been&#xD;
forced upon me in this way. I will now make&#xD;
a plain statement of what has just been pre-&#xD;
sented in a very distorted light:&#xD;
"On Saturday night, at a dinner-party at&#xD;
Mr. Middleton's, wishing to speak to my cous-&#xD;
in, I looked through the company, both in the&#xD;
house and on the lawn, without finding him.&#xD;
I had observed at dinner that he was drinking&#xD;
toO much-and afterward I noticed that his&#xD;
face and manner both showed the effects of&#xD;
this to one familiar with him-though, to gn&#xD;
ordinary observer, he was at that time appar-&#xD;
ently sober. As Icould neither see norhear any&#xD;
thing of him, when I was searching for him, I&#xD;
thought it likely he had become conscious&#xD;
that the wine he had taken was affecting him,&#xD;
and had therefore gone home, and I followed,&#xD;
intending to see him for a few minutes, and&#xD;
then return again to Rosland-~-as I afterward&#xD;
did-it being still early in the evening.&#xD;

A DAUGHTER OF BOH'~MIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I was surprised and concerned to find&#xD;
Arthur in the dining-room, with wine and&#xD;
brandy before him. He had been drinking&#xD;
deeply since his return borne, and it soon be.&#xD;
came evident to me that he was not in a con-&#xD;
dition to speak rationally on any subject. I&#xD;
made one or two efforts to talk to him; that&#xD;
is, to induce him to listen to what I had to&#xD;
say; but, as he was perfectly impracticable&#xD;
-being, in fact, too much under the influence&#xD;
of wine to know what he was doing or saying&#xD;
-I rose to go. With the folly of a drunken&#xD;
man, he began to complain of the manner in&#xD;
which I was treating him, and placed himself&#xD;
before me to prevent my leaving the room. I&#xD;
had just put him aside-quietly, of course-&#xD;
and turned to the door to go, when it opened,&#xD;
and this servant entered the room. He ac-&#xD;
counted for the intrusion by an excuse which&#xD;
satisfied me at the time as reasonable enough;&#xD;
though his subsequent conduct proves that he&#xD;
must have been watching about for some mis-&#xD;
chief-making purpose."&#xD;
"No, sir I" here interposed Giles, in a&#xD;
half-deprecating, half-indignant tone. "If&#xD;
you will allow me to speak, sir-i"' he added,&#xD;
and, Ma; not objecting, he went on, with some&#xD;
excitement of manner: "It was just as I told&#xD;
you at the time, sir. I 'ad no wish, and I&#xD;
haven'tt any now to make mischief, but I didn't&#xD;
know w~iat to make of there being a light in&#xD;
the dining-room that time o' night-"&#xD;
"Very well," interrupted Captain Tyndale,&#xD;
cutting short the man's flow of words, and&#xD;
again addressing the magistrate. "I left the&#xD;
room and strolled back to Rosland. Finding&#xD;
it later than I had thought, I did not go into&#xD;
the house, but, after smoking in the grounds&#xD;
for a while, returned to Strafford, and imme-&#xD;
diately went to bed. The next morning at&#xD;
five o'clock I was awakened by my cousin's&#xD;
servatit, with the information that his master&#xD;
had iiot returned home the night before.&#xD;
Though rather surprised to hear this, I was&#xD;
not alarmed wntil I suddenly remembered a&#xD;
oireurnstance which had occurred while I was&#xD;
in the Rosland grounds the last time; the rec-&#xD;
ollection of which made me a little uneasy.&#xD;
This was the sound of a pistol-shot in the di-&#xD;
rection of the bridge. I had attached no im-&#xD;
portance to it at the time; but now the more&#xD;
I thought of Arthur's non-appearance, the&#xD;
more strange it seemed, and I grew very un-&#xD;
comfortable, not to say alarmed, at the idea&#xD;
that there might be some connection between&#xD;
&#xD;
the shot I had heard and his absence. Consid-&#xD;
ering his condition when I parted from him,&#xD;
there wafi no telling what he might have done&#xD;
-or where he might have gone. I thought it&#xD;
not improbable that he had started to go to&#xD;
Rosland, stopped by the way, been overcome&#xD;
by sleep, and spent the night in the open air.&#xD;
At all events, I could not leave Strafford-as I&#xD;
was intending to do that morning, to take the&#xD;
train at Wexford-without ascertaining what&#xD;
had become of him; and sol walked toward the&#xD;
bridge, purposing, if I did not find him asleep&#xD;
somewhere by the way, to go on to Rosland&#xD;
and see if he were there. Before I reached the&#xD;
bridge I met Lewis, one of the Strafford ser-&#xD;
vants, who Ilad just discovered his body2'&#xD;
His voice sank at the last words: some-&#xD;
thing of the grief and horror he had felt at&#xD;
the moment to which he alluded, vibrated&#xD;
through its tones, as every one present could&#xD;
not but observe; and the short pause which&#xD;
he made was unbroken. After an instant, he&#xD;
resumed:&#xD;
"These are the circumstances, which have&#xD;
been distorted and exaggerated by my cousin a&#xD;
servant into what you were pleased to call 'a&#xD;
grave charge,' sir."&#xD;
Again there was a short pause: Mr. Pur-&#xD;
cell hesitated, and even looked slightly em-&#xD;
barrassed. He had opened his lips to speak,&#xD;
but to what effect did not appear; since at&#xD;
this instant Mr, Colville, who sat close beside&#xD;
him, and who had been moving impatiently in&#xD;
his chair, leaned over, and said a few words&#xD;
in his ear. The magistrate's face cleared.&#xD;
"You say you heard a pistol-shot while in&#xD;
the Rosland grounds. Did the rest of the&#xD;
company, who were in the grounds at the&#xD;
same time, hear this shot also? and did no one&#xD;
express surprise st such a circumstance, or&#xD;
think of ascertaining what it meant 1"'&#xD;
"As I mentioned before, I found it later&#xD;
than I was aware it was when I looked at&#xD;
my watch shortly after entering the Rosland&#xD;
grounds; and, supposing probably that Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton's guests were dispersing by that&#xD;
time, I did not go on to the house, but turned&#xD;
aside and sat down on the steps of a summer-&#xD;
house, smoking for a while; after which I re-&#xD;
turned to Strafford."&#xD;
"You did not see any one at Rosland,&#xD;
then? You cannot call upon any witnesses&#xD;
to testify as to your presence there?"&#xD;
"I cannot produce any witnesses," an-&#xD;
swered Max, quietly.&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
EVASIVE ANSWERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Purcell shook his head. "That&#xD;
unfortunate," he said;. adding, in a ton&#xD;
which was equally compounded of gentle&#xD;
manly apology and magisterial pomposity&#xD;
"All men are ejual in the eye of the law, am&#xD;
in legal affairs the same formality is require&#xD;
in all cases. However unimpeachable th&#xD;
character of a man may be, these formalities~&#xD;
are demanded and must be complied with.&#xD;
am sorry to say, Captain Tyndale, that th&#xD;
fact of your not being able to bring testi.&#xD;
mony to prove your presence at Rosland,&#xD;
makes a rather strong point against you-in&#xD;
law. The witness there "-he pointed to&#xD;
Giles-"testifies on oath that on Saturday&#xD;
night-the night on which Mr. Tyndale came&#xD;
to his death-there occurred a difficulty&#xD;
amounting to a personal collision between the&#xD;
deceased and yourself; that you left the&#xD;
house shortly afterward, and were followed&#xD;
almost immediately by the deceased; that he&#xD;
-the witness-heard you return after mid-&#xD;
night alone. You say yourself that you entered&#xD;
the grounds of Rosland, but did not go to the&#xD;
house, or see any of the company assembled;&#xD;
that you turned aside to a summer-house,&#xD;
and, after some time spent in smoking, re-&#xD;
turned to Strafford and went to bed. You say,&#xD;
also, that, while in th~ grounds at Rosland,&#xD;
you heard a pistol-shot in the direction of the&#xD;
bridge; that you attached no importance to&#xD;
the circumstance at the time, but the next&#xD;
morning, when informed that deceased had'&#xD;
not returned home the night before, you rec-&#xD;
ollected this shot with some uneasiness, and&#xD;
walked toward the bridge, the direction from&#xD;
which it had sounded. In the investigation,&#xD;
which took place before the coroner's jury,&#xD;
did you mention the factof your having heard&#xD;
this shot?"&#xD;
"I did not," said Max. "There seemed&#xD;
no necessity for doing so; it being evident&#xD;
that the wound which caused my cousin's&#xD;
death could not have been made by a pistol-&#xD;
ball."&#xD;
"I think I have understood that a pistol&#xD;
was picked up upon the ground ?~"&#xD;
"You have understood correctly. A pistol,&#xD;
belonging to my cousin himself, was found&#xD;
by me ~ipon the spot. Mr. Middleton was&#xD;
present when I discovered itandlmen.&#xD;
toned to him that I had heard a shot the&#xD;
night before.-You remember this, I suppose,&#xD;
Mr. Middleton?"&#xD;
'~ Yes, certainly," answered that gentle-&#xD;
13&#xD;
&#xD;
193&#xD;
&#xD;
a man, who was overcome with indignation at&#xD;
e the manner in which the magistrate was pro.&#xD;
- exceeding.&#xD;
"Did it not occur to you, Captain Tyn-&#xD;
I dale, that the shot might have been fired by&#xD;
I the deceased, as it was his pistol?"&#xD;
"I did not, and do not yet, know what to&#xD;
think about either the pistol or the shot,"&#xD;
answered Captain Tyndale, who was as thor-&#xD;
oughly aware as the magistrate, or any one&#xD;
present, that the evasive answers he was giv.~&#xD;
ing could not but make another "rather&#xD;
strong point in law," against him. But what&#xD;
could he do? Compromise Norah he would&#xD;
not-that he was determined-let whatmight&#xD;
happen to himself. And, thanks to his sound&#xD;
nerves and habitual self-control, he succeeded&#xD;
in maintaining a composure and case of man-&#xD;
ner which went far to counterbalance the&#xD;
effect of his seemingly suspicious reticence-&#xD;
not only in the opinion of the by-standers,&#xD;
but in that of Mr. Purcell himself. Mr. Col-&#xD;
ville, however, was not to be hoodwinked by&#xD;
this "military effrontery," as, in his own&#xD;
mind, he pronounced Max's self-possession to&#xD;
to be. Once more he leaned close to the ear of&#xD;
the presiding magnate, and uttered a few sen-&#xD;
tences in a low but sharp and vehement tone.&#xD;
And once more Mr. Purcell, thus primed and&#xD;
loaded by his leader, returned to the charge.&#xD;
"You mentioned, I think, Captain Tyn.&#xD;
dale, that it had been your intention to leave&#xD;
Strafford on the morning following the mur-&#xD;
der. Was this intended departure caused by&#xD;
the altercation which had occurred between&#xD;
Mr. Tyndale and yourself?"&#xD;
At this question there was a sudden flicker&#xD;
of haughty light in Max's dark eyes-.-- his&#xD;
brows contracted sternly for an instant. But&#xD;
he recovered himself almost immediately, and~&#xD;
replied as readily as ever, though perhaps&#xD;
there was a shade of curtness now in his&#xD;
tone:&#xD;
"I cannot conceive that it rests within the&#xD;
province of the law to inquire into a matter&#xD;
entirely personal to myself. My motives for&#xD;
leaving Strafford are aside from any question&#xD;
involved in the present investigation. The&#xD;
fact of my having made my arrangements to&#xD;
go, may be another thing; and this factican&#xD;
prove by my cousin s servant there." Turn-&#xD;
ing to giles-" I presume you have not for-&#xD;
gotten what I said to you in the hall on Satur-&#xD;
day night, just before I went out?" he in-&#xD;
quired.&#xD;

"No, sir," answered Giles; "I remem-&#xD;
ber very well what you said. You ordered&#xD;
me to tell Anderson to have some conveyance&#xD;
at the door to take you to Wexford in the&#xD;
morning in time for the train; and to be snre&#xD;
to wake you early enough for you to get off."&#xD;
"You decline, then, Captain Tyndale, to&#xD;
answer my question as to whether there was&#xD;
any connection between your intended depart.&#xD;
ure from Strafford, and the difficulty which&#xD;
you admit existed with Mr. Tyndale I"' said&#xD;
Mr. rurcell, in a much more magisterial tone&#xD;
than he had spoken before.&#xD;
"I decline to answer a question which&#xD;
seems to ~me irrelevant," was the reply.&#xD;
"I must suppose, sir," said the magistrate,&#xD;
with increasing coldness, "that you are not&#xD;
well acquainted with the laws in force here-.&#xD;
I understand you are a foreigner - or you&#xD;
would be aware that any circumstance, bear.&#xD;
ing the most remote connection with a case&#xD;
of this kind, and likely to throw light upon it,&#xD;
is legitimate subject of legal investigation. It&#xD;
is in virtue of this fact that I, must request&#xD;
you to explain the nature and subject of your&#xD;
conversation with Mr. Tyndale on the night&#xD;
before his death."&#xD;
"That I absolutely decline to do," an7&#xD;
swered Max, quietly, but very decidedly. "I&#xD;
can only say that it related to a matter of&#xD;
business about which my cousin had con-&#xD;
sulted me, and which did not in the slightest&#xD;
* degree concern myself."&#xD;
There was a pause. Then the magistrate&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"I recommend you to reconsider your&#xD;
reply."&#xD;
"That is impossible," the young man an-&#xD;
swered in the same tone as before."&#xD;
*   "In that case I have no further questions&#xD;
to ask," said the magistrate, after exchang-&#xD;
ing a few words with his coadjutor. "It&#xD;
- only remains for me to perform what, I assure&#xD;
you, ails, is a ~e~y painful duty."&#xD;
With this preface, he proceeded to reca-&#xD;
pitulate the evidence in the case; beginning&#xD;
with the charge lirought against Captain Tyn-&#xD;
dale by Giles, pointing out the train of cir-&#xD;
cumstantial evidence upon which this charge&#xD;
rested; dwelling on Captain Tyndale's in~&#xD;
* ability to produce any. proofs, or make any&#xD;
explanations to exonerate himself from sus-&#xD;
picion; and ending by committing him to&#xD;
prison to aWait the action of the grand-jury.&#xD;
At~this stage of the proceedings the jus.&#xD;
&#xD;
OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
tice-room became a scene of no small com-&#xD;
motion and excitement. There was a general&#xD;
murmur of dissatisfaction; a large majority&#xD;
of those present having already arrayed them.&#xD;
selves as partisans on the side of Max. It&#xD;
was true that they knew him very slightly-&#xD;
many of them not at all. But there was&#xD;
something in the man himself which excited&#xD;
confidence and sympathy; while the fact of&#xD;
his being a stranger added to the latter feel-&#xD;
ing. As for Mr. Middleton, his wrath ex-&#xD;
ploded in a burst of passionate invective&#xD;
against the magistrate and his "wire-puller,"&#xD;
as he denominated Mr. Colville, the like of&#xD;
which he had not been guilty of indulging for&#xD;
years. There is nothing more true than that&#xD;
it is goed-natured, equable-tempered people&#xD;
who are always most violent when once roused.&#xD;
This gentleman, usually so mild and cour-&#xD;
teous, was, upon the present occasion, so&#xD;
much the reverse; and gave the two offenders&#xD;
in question the benefit of hearing a few home&#xD;
truths in such very plain and emphatic lan-&#xD;
guage that several of the other gentlemen&#xD;
present deemed it prudent to interfere as pa-&#xD;
cificators, seeing that the said offenders (Mr.&#xD;
Colville in especial) began to swell and red-&#xD;
den with a passion which threatened to emu-&#xD;
late that by which it had been excited. Max&#xD;
himself-who, whatever were his feelings,&#xD;
still retained an unruffled demeanor out-&#xD;
wardly-was one of the principal of these&#xD;
peace-makers. "For Heaven's sake, my dear&#xD;
sir, don't let me be the cause pf your in-&#xD;
volving yourself in a difficulty with two such&#xD;
men as theac I', he said, earnestly, in a low&#xD;
tone. "Come, ct~me, Middleton, you're rather&#xD;
too hard on Purcell I Hecan't help being a&#xD;
fool, you know!" whispered a friend into his&#xD;
left ear. "You'll do a good deal more harm&#xD;
than good," said another friend, with a warn-&#xD;
ing shake of the head, and knitting of the&#xD;
brows. "At this rate of going on, you'll not&#xD;
be allowed to give bail, as I suppose you want&#xD;
to do," cried a third into his right ear.&#xD;
This last significant suggestion had an&#xD;
immediate effect in restoring Mr. Middleton&#xD;
to something like his accustomed manner.&#xD;
As a matter of policy, he even tried to smooth&#xD;
matters over a little for the wounded amour&#xD;
propre of Mr. Purcell, remonstrating still&#xD;
with that gentleman, but in a different tone.&#xD;
But remonstrances, representations, persua-&#xD;
sion, all proved vain; the magistrate was&#xD;
too deeply offended by some of the stinging&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
truths he had just been obliged to listen to, and Purcell held up to universal scorn as the&#xD;
and which had been heard and appreciated, fools which he esteemed them. Still, he could&#xD;
as he knew very well, by the crowd around, not but confess that Max's obstinate silence&#xD;
not to be glad of an opportunity for annoy. was calculated to prejudice the public mind&#xD;
ing his assailant in turn. He was obstinately against him. "He must have seen somebody&#xD;
deaf to all appeal from his first decision, in my grounds," the puzzled gentleman&#xD;
"Well," said Mr. Middleton, at last, "I thought. "If he would only say who it was&#xD;
suppose it is useless to say any thing more-" -if he would only call a witness-the whole&#xD;
"Quite so," interrupted the magistrate, charge must fall to the ground."&#xD;
dryly. "Constable__"                    .   Full of these thoughts, he turned his&#xD;
"But of course you'll take bail," con- horse's head into the gates of Rosland. He&#xD;
tinted Mr. Middleton, quickly. "What shall knew that he could not remain there long&#xD;
the amount be?"                          that since Max was under arrest - the fact&#xD;
"Excuse me," said the magistrate, stiffly came back upon him now and then with the&#xD;
(so effectually had his spleen been roused actual sensation of a physical shock-the ar-&#xD;
that he needed no prompting or bolstering rangements with regard to the funeral would&#xD;
from his wire-puller now), "I cannot take devolve upon him; but it was impossible to&#xD;
bail in this case."                     resist the temptation for a little rest; besides&#xD;
And to this resolution he adhered,    which, he knew that no one would be so well&#xD;
able as himself to break the news of this ad-&#xD;
ditional misfortune to 'his wife. As he en-&#xD;

'I should have known what fruit would sprIng that there might be visitors at the house,&#xD;
from such a seed."&#xD;
and, in that case, he unhesitatingly made up&#xD;
Mu. MIDDLETON, having shaken hands with his mind to go back to Strafford at once.&#xD;
Max, and cheerfully advised him to keep up Any thing was better than to be forced to&#xD;

spirits reduced to as l~w an ebb as could questions. On this point, however, he was&#xD;

to be comfortable, however, and he could net the damp gravel. "Is anybody here?"&#xD;

but .a comfortable condition. There was not "That is, I mean no company. Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
only poor Leslie, for whom the stout fibres of ford and Miss Desmond's here. Mistis and&#xD;
his heart ached, but there was Arthur cut off Miss Leslie's gone over to Strafford, in the&#xD;

position which was decidedly unpleasant, to "Gone over to Strafford-is it possible!&#xD;
say the least of it. Then he fell to consider- When did they go?"&#xD;
ing why Max was so remarkably reticent "'Bout an hour ago, sir, I reckon."&#xD;
with regard to that interval of time at mid- "Did you hear when they expected to be&#xD;
night which he had affirmed that he had spent back?"&#xD;
in the grounds of Rosland. Some men-men "No, sir, I ~&#xD;

this reticence as very suspicious; but Mr. looked meditatively at the sPeaker. He had&#xD;

able to say whether or not he ha~I seen any&#xD;
one else. "You say Miss Desmond is in the&#xD;
house?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
Alighting, he walked into the silent house, I&#xD;
over which an unseen pall of grief seemed to&#xD;
hang. Singularly enough, this aspect struck&#xD;
himmuch more here tl~an at Strafford. Per-&#xD;
haps the cause of this rested in the fact that,&#xD;
at Strafford, there were~ no women, only men,&#xD;
who, with the exception of Max and himself,&#xD;
felt little affection, and nothing more than&#xD;
conventional regret, for the dead. Here there&#xD;
had been sighs, and sobs, and bitter tears.&#xD;
Albeit the farthest in the world from a fanci.&#xD;
ful man, Mr. Wddleton felt them in the very&#xD;
atmosphere. He shoo~ Jiis head mournfully&#xD;
as he walked into the fmpty sitting-room and&#xD;
rang the bell. "Tel~ Miss Desmond that I&#xD;
would like to speak td her," he said to Maria,&#xD;
who answered it.&#xD;
Having sent this message, he sat down&#xD;
and fanned himself, hoping devoutly that&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford might not flutter down upon&#xD;
him from some unforeseen nook or corner.&#xD;
He might have spared hisfears. Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford was at that moment in her room busily&#xD;
engaged in writing an account of all that had&#xD;
occurred to her friends in Alton. Little as&#xD;
Mr. Middleton thought it, the last sensational&#xD;
item had reached Rosland, ar~d was at that&#xD;
moment being chronicled as fast as pen could&#xD;
go, with many double underscoring and ex-&#xD;
clamation - points. The fair correspondent&#xD;
had that morning debate(1 whether she would&#xD;
not pack her trunk, and bid adieu to a house&#xD;
which had become any thing save an abode&#xD;
of gayety; but a keen desire to ~ee "the end&#xD;
of the matter" had for once prevailed over&#xD;
ennui. Now she had her reward. Now it&#xD;
would be her privilege to send this second&#xD;
item of intelligence like an electric shock&#xD;
into the circles of Alton society. "You can&#xD;
imagine the state of painful excitement, the&#xD;
terrible nervoue distress that I am in," she&#xD;
wrote, "but, of course, it is impossible for&#xD;
me to think of leaving dear Mrs. Middleton&#xD;
and our poor darling Leslie, both of whom&#xD;
seem to lean upon me."&#xD;
Mr. Middleton had not long to wait for&#xD;
Norah. He had scarcely settled himself and&#xD;
begun to appreciate the coolness and quiet&#xD;
of the room, when a step sounded in the, hall&#xD;
and she stood before him in the open door.&#xD;
As he rose she advanced, and he had time to&#xD;
&#xD;
OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
notice as she crossed the floor how strangely&#xD;
pale she looked-not nervous, not as if she&#xD;
had b~en weeping, not overwrought or hys-&#xD;
terical, but simply devoid of all color, and&#xD;
consequently wholly unlike herself in appear-&#xD;
ance.&#xD;
"Is it true?" she said, as she came near&#xD;
him~-speaking before he could utter a word&#xD;
-"is it true that Captain Tyndale has been&#xD;
arrested on a charge of-of having caused his&#xD;
cousin's' death?"&#xD;
"I am sorry to say that it is quite true,"&#xD;
Mr. Middleton answered, surprised at being&#xD;
met by the knowledge which he meant to im-&#xD;
part. "He has not only been(arrested, but&#xD;
the examination is over, and, thanks to ~i pair&#xD;
of obstinate, dunderheaded fools, he has been&#xD;
"Committed?"&#xD;
"To jail for trial. They absolutely went&#xD;
so far as to refuse bail."&#xD;
Norab uttered a cry-it was her first, so&#xD;
she may be pardoned-and sank into a chair&#xD;
which chanced to be near by. There was&#xD;
nothing of affectation in this, her limbs abso-&#xD;
lutely refused to support her. She put her&#xD;
hands to her face and shuddered. Strong and&#xD;
brave as she was, her nerves and her heart&#xD;
both gave way. Arrested !-committed! It&#xD;
seemed too terrible to believe!&#xD;
"It is astonishing with what rapidity bad&#xD;
~1ewsLtravels!~, said Mr. Middleton, in a vexed&#xD;
tone. He thought her nervous and theatrical,&#xD;
and felt more than half sorry that he had sent&#xD;
for her. "May I ask how this information&#xD;
reached you ?.-and have my wife and Leslie&#xD;
heard it?"&#xD;
"It reached us through a servant who was&#xD;
~i Strafford," answered Norab, looking up.&#xD;
"Yes, Mrs. Middleton and Leslie have both&#xD;
heard it. It was because they heard it-be-&#xD;
cause the servant told them that every one at&#xD;
Strafford had gone to Wexford-that they&#xD;
went over there. Leslie insisted upon going,&#xD;
and Mrs. Middleton thought it best to take&#xD;
advantage of he house being empty."&#xD;
"It was v ry well that she did !" said Mr.&#xD;
Middleton, w o was heartily glad that ke had&#xD;
gone to W d. There was scarcely any&#xD;
place, indeed, t which lie would not have&#xD;
gone to escape th pain of being under the&#xD;
same roof that witne sed Leslie's last parting&#xD;
with her dead love.&#xD;
"This is a bad case for Tyndale," he said,&#xD;
after a minute, "though he has his own oh-&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
NORAH'S STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
stinacy to thank, as well as the folly of others.&#xD;
He admits that he was in the grounds here&#xD;
at midnight-which was about the time that&#xD;
poor Arthur was killed, as near as we can&#xD;
tell-but he either can't or won't give the&#xD;
name of any person whom he saw or talked&#xD;
with; so that his own admission tells against&#xD;
him. I confess that I don't understand it!"&#xD;
said he, in a half-annoyed, half-puzzled tone.&#xD;
"I can't believe that he was the person who&#xD;
had that struggle with Arth~ir at the bridge,&#xD;
and yet his silence is inclining people to sus-&#xD;
pect him who never thought of doing so at&#xD;
first."&#xD;
"You mean, then, that he acknowledges&#xD;
he was here - in these grounds - at mid-&#xD;
night?" said Norah, in a voice which scarce-&#xD;
ly sounded like her own, so tense and sharp-&#xD;
ened was it.&#xD;
"Yes,1 he acknowledges it. He had no&#xD;
option, indeed, about doing so-the servant's&#xD;
evidence proved that he left Strafford, and&#xD;
that Arthur followed him. What took him&#xD;
out at that hour of the night he won't say,&#xD;
however. It is a queer business altogether,"&#xD;
said Mr. Middleton, summing it up sharply.&#xD;
"The more I think of it, the queerer it seems.&#xD;
If I had chosen to volunteer my evidence,&#xD;
and say that the guests here had all left be-&#xD;
fore he gould have got back-according to&#xD;
Giles's statement of the time he left Strafford&#xD;
-it would have made the matter still more&#xD;
suspicious. As it is, I cannot conceive what&#xD;
he did with himself that he is so loath to&#xD;
tell."&#xD;
As he ceased speaking, silence fell-a si-&#xD;
lence in which he might almost have heard&#xD;
the quick breathing of the girl near him.&#xD;
She put her hand to her th~at, where some-&#xD;
thing seemed choking her. As in a mirror&#xD;
she saw all the array of merciless conse-&#xD;
quences that must follow if she opened her&#xD;
lips, and said, "He came to meet me." Yet,&#xD;
it must not be supposed that she wits silent&#xD;
because she hesitated to say it. She was si-&#xD;
lent literally because she could not speak.&#xD;
Such a host of emotions assailed her that she&#xD;
felt like one whose breath is taken away in&#xD;
the whirl of a great tempest. Foremost&#xD;
among these was amazement - amazement&#xD;
that Max should endure arrest, suspicion, im-&#xD;
prisonment, should face the thought of all&#xD;
that might ensue, sooner than utter words&#xD;
which might throw a shadow on her name.&#xD;
To understand the light in which Norab re-&#xD;
&#xD;
197&#xD;
&#xD;
guarded this which Max took to be a very plain:&#xD;
and simple rule of honor, it must be remem-&#xD;
hered that she had spoken according to the&#xD;
stern letter of the truth when she said. that,&#xD;
though admiration and love had been freely&#xD;
offered her in the course of her life, consider-&#xD;
ation and that chivalry of respect which is&#xD;
the flower of courtesy, had rarely, if ever,&#xD;
come within the range of her experience.&#xD;
"What is my good name to him, that he&#xD;
should guard it?" she thought, with such a&#xD;
~rush of supreme gratitude that, at that mo-&#xD;
ment, she even forgave him the words which&#xD;
he would "never have spoken to Leslie."&#xD;
"I did not know that you .had heard the&#xD;
news of the arrest," Mr. Middleton said, while&#xD;
she still remained silent-still gasped for&#xD;
breath~ still felt that, if she tried to speak,&#xD;
she would probably disgust and shock her lis-&#xD;
tener by bursting into tears-" so I thought I&#xD;
would come in and tell you, since Mrs. Mid.&#xD;
dieton is not here. Do you know, by-the-by,&#xD;
how long she is to remain at Strafford?"&#xD;
"No," answered Norah. It cost her such&#xD;
'an effort to articulate the word that it came&#xD;
out with a force which was almost equivalent&#xD;
to a moral cannon-ball-startling Mr. Middle-&#xD;
ton not a little. He looked at her suspicious-&#xD;
ly. What ailed the girl? He noticed again&#xD;
that she was deathly pale, and that her lips&#xD;
quivered. He began to be afraid of hysterics.&#xD;
He extended his hand, and grasped his hat,&#xD;
which was on a table near by.&#xD;
"I have a good deal of business," he said,&#xD;
hastily. "I think I better__"&#xD;
"Be going," he would have said, if Norab&#xD;
had not suddenly risen, and, in so doing,&#xD;
barred his way. Her great eyes burned steady&#xD;
and lustrous in her white face. There was no&#xD;
faltering or hesitation now.&#xD;
"If you can spare a few minutes longer,"&#xD;
she said, "I wish you would be kind enough&#xD;
to tell. me what I must do-how I must give&#xD;
my evidence. I know what Captain Tyndalo&#xD;
did in the grounds here that ni~t."&#xD;
"Thu know!" repeated Middleton,&#xD;
amazed. "Why, how on earth do you know?"&#xD;
"Because he came to m~et me," she an-&#xD;
swered. "Because he did meet me, and we&#xD;
spent some time-an hour, perhaps-on the&#xD;
steps of the summer-house. We were sitting&#xD;
there together, when we beard the report of&#xD;
the pistol, which was found near Arthur Tyn.&#xD;
dale's body."&#xD;
"God bless my soul! "said Mr. Middleton.&#xD;

198                      A DAUGHTER&#xD;
Yin was so astounded that he sat down again&#xD;
in the chair from which he had risen. "Is it&#xD;
possible?" he said, after a minute. "Are&#xD;
you really in earnest in telling me this?"&#xD;
"I am perfectly in earnest,", she answered&#xD;
-a sudden flush, like the hectic spot of fever,&#xD;
coming into, her cheeks. "Do you think I&#xD;
would say such a thing if it were not true?&#xD;
What reason could I have for doing so?&#xD;
Surely you must see that Max Tyndale has&#xD;
been ~ilent in order to spare me. He has&#xD;
borne this suspicion rather than involve me,&#xD;
rather than drag my name into such a matter.&#xD;
-But he thinks more of me than I think of&#xD;
myself!" she cried, pamionatcly. "No earth-&#xD;
ly consideration could make me accept such&#xD;
a sacrifice. Sir-Mr. Middleton - tell me&#xD;
where to ~o, and what to do, and I will do it&#xD;
this minute!"&#xD;
"Sit down, and be quiet," said Mr. Mid.&#xD;
dleton. "That is the best thing you can do&#xD;
at present. Neither the magistrates nor Tyn.&#xD;
dale are likely to run away. Now tell me&#xD;
what is the meaning of this? Why should he&#xD;
have come to meet you, at midnight, in the&#xD;
grounds, when you could see him at any hour&#xD;
of the day in the house?"&#xD;
Then it was-face to face with this in-&#xD;
quiry, and the keen eyes enforcing it-that&#xD;
Norah felt the consequences of her disclosure.&#xD;
How could she say what she must say, how&#xD;
could she explain what must be explained,&#xD;
without telling, the whole story of Arthur's&#xD;
deception? It would have been hard to do&#xD;
this at any time but it seemed doubly hard&#xD;
now' that he was dead, now that he could&#xD;
utternever another word in his own defense.&#xD;
It seemed cowardice to assail the dead; but,&#xD;
then, might not mercy to the dead mean in-&#xD;
justice to the living? Max wss already suf-&#xD;
fering from Arthur's, fault; should he suffer&#xD;
still 'more?' This thought ended her doubt.&#xD;
Mr. Middleton saw the lines of her face settle&#xD;
into determination, the lips brace themselves&#xD;
for a second, the drooping lids lift. He was&#xD;
a man, though an elderly one, and 'the mute&#xD;
though proud appeal of her eyes touched him&#xD;
before she spoke.&#xD;
"It is a long story, and not a pleasant&#xD;
o~h~" she said; "but, if you wish to hear it&#xD;
-,~j~itis necessary for you to hear it-I am&#xD;
ready to tell it. But I warn you beforeha~id&#xD;
that it will make you think bitterly of him&#xD;

his own defense again.&#xD;

OF BOHEMIAN.                                              THE MIDNIGHT INTERVIEW.             199&#xD;
&#xD;
"What do you mean?" asked Mr. Middle.&#xD;
ton. He felt bewildered, and yet something&#xD;
like a gleam of light shot athwart the cloud&#xD;
of puzzled doubt which surrounded him. His&#xD;
brows beat, a spark of angry light came into&#xD;
his eyes. Had Arthur Tyr~dale forgotten his&#xD;
honor and ,his faith far enough to let this&#xD;
fair-faced siren make a fool of him? Had he&#xD;
been going.to meet her when he met his death?&#xD;
"What do you mean?" he repeated, sternly.&#xD;
"Whatever it is, you must explain." At that&#xD;
moment he had neither respect nor compas-&#xD;
sion for her in his heart.&#xD;
But, as she read his thoughts, her color&#xD;
rose, her eyes began to glow, the majesty of&#xD;
bearing, which chiefly made her beauty so un-&#xD;
like that of other women, came back to her.&#xD;
She looked at him like a queen-one bora to&#xD;
rule, by right divine, over the great realm of&#xD;
hearts.&#xD;
"I mean this,~~ she said, "that, when Max&#xD;
Tyndale came to meet me on Saturday night,&#xD;
he did not come on his own behalf, nor with&#xD;
regard to any thing which concerned himself;&#xD;
he came in the cause of the man of whose&#xD;
murder he stands accused, the man who was&#xD;
engaged to me before he ever knew Leslie-&#xD;
the man whose letters are in my possession&#xD;
now to prove that I speak the truth."&#xD;
"Engaged to you!" repeated Mr. Middle-&#xD;
ton. Astonishment stupefied him. "Do you&#xD;
-do you know what you are saying 1','&#xD;
"It was about those letters, which Arthur&#xD;
was anxious to recover, that Captain Tyndale&#xD;
came to me," Norah went on, with resistless&#xD;
impetuosity. "I had agreed to surrender&#xD;
them; but I wanted-not unnaturally, you&#xD;
may think-some guarantee of good faith on&#xD;
his part, some proof that he would not return&#xD;
my generosity by slander. Perhaps you are&#xD;
not aware that men do such things sometimes,&#xD;
even fine gentlemen such as Arthur Tyndale&#xD;
-wag." Her voice dropped over the last&#xD;
word; it seemed as if, in the midst of the old&#xD;
bitterness, a thrill of remembrance came to&#xD;
her that he of whom she spake now only&#xD;
"was." There was a short pause; then she&#xD;
resumed more quietly: "All of ,this I can&#xD;
prove, if you care for proof. But it is not of&#xD;
these things 1 wish to speak. It ws~s of Cap.&#xD;
tam Tyndale. I Want-you to understand why&#xD;
he came to meet me; I want you to believe&#xD;
that he had no personal reason for desiring to&#xD;
see me. It waa as entirely a matter of busi-&#xD;
ness with him as if I went to see my banker&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
-supposing that I had one. So it seems&#xD;
hard that he should suffer, does it not? And&#xD;
I-how much of this will Ineed to tell? Sure.&#xD;
ly not the whole, for Leslie's sake, and even&#xD;
for his sake-who is dead."&#xD;
"Good' Heavens!" said Mr. Middleton.&#xD;
"How can I tell? Give me a minuteto think&#xD;
-to take it in! I never liked him; but to&#xD;
suspect him of such dishonorable conduct as&#xD;
this never occurred tome- never for an in-&#xD;
stant! The false -hearted scoundrel !" said&#xD;
he, grinding his teeth, and forgetting for a&#xD;
moment what stupendous gulf-silencing all&#xD;
speech, ending all wrong-lay between him.&#xD;
self and the man of whom he spoke.&#xD;
"He was not so false as weakI think,"&#xD;
said Norah, gravely. "But it does not matter&#xD;
now. Leslie has forgiven him-.."&#xD;
"Does Leslie know?" interrupted he,&#xD;
quickly, almost fiercely. "Surely you had&#xD;
humanity enough not to tell ker this story?"&#xD;
"I told her the truth when I found that&#xD;
she had heard a garbled falsehood, which was&#xD;
worse than the truth," Norah answered.-and&#xD;
the dignity of her manner impressed, even if&#xD;
it did not convince her listener-" I told it to&#xD;
her on that night, after I came in from the&#xD;
shrubbery. I had no alternative. Mrs. Sand-&#xD;
ford had overheard a conversation, and so&#xD;
knew enough to make mischief. This mis-&#xD;
chief she made. Again I repeat, that her&#xD;
garbled falsehood was even worse than the&#xD;
truth."&#xD;
"But," said Mr. Middleton, with gathering&#xD;
indignation in his eyes and in his voice, "she&#xD;
could never have overheard any thing, she&#xD;
could never have found any thing, she would&#xD;
never have been t~bIe to make mischief, if&#xD;
you had not put it in her power to do so!&#xD;
Do you think that it was honorable conduct&#xD;
to come here with such a secret as this in&#xD;
your possession, Miss Desmond? If you&#xD;
knew any thing to Mr. Tyndale's discredit,&#xD;
and wished to break off your sister's engage-&#xD;
ment, it would have been honest to write and&#xD;
warn her. I~ut to come here-to hold inter.&#xD;
course-to write~ letters-to meet him clan-&#xD;
destinely-nothing can justify it!"&#xD;
"I know that now," said Norah. ~" I rec-&#xD;
ognize it as fully as you can do. But I-&#xD;
-well, I knew no better. I have lived a&#xD;
more 'vagrant and hap-hazard life than you&#xD;
can well imagine," said she, looking at him&#xD;
with something half pathetic in her eyes.&#xD;
"Nobody ever taught me any thing. I I&#xD;
&#xD;
have had only my own instincts and impulses&#xD;
to guide me, and it is not strange that I-&#xD;
a girl of nineteen - have been sometimes&#xD;
guided wrongly. I am sorry, very sorry, that&#xD;
I came to make trouble in your home as I&#xD;
have done-but I promise you that I will not&#xD;
stay any longer than it is necessary for me 'to&#xD;
do in order to clear the name of an innocent&#xD;
man. Oh, sir," she clasped her hands and&#xD;
leaned toward him with great crystal drops-&#xD;
drops which did not fall - standing in her'&#xD;
eyes, "don't think of me just now. Re-&#xD;
strain your indignation for a little while, and&#xD;
think of Captain Tyndale. Where must I&#xD;
go, what must I do, to give my evidence for&#xD;
him?"                         4'&#xD;
"Good Heavens I" said Mr. ~Iiddleton,&#xD;
irritated, exasperated, and yet touched. "Try&#xD;
to be a little reasonable I Women can be&#xD;
reasonable sometimes, I suppose - if they&#xD;
try! Did I say any thing about-about want-&#xD;
ing you to go?" (The words nearly choked&#xD;
him', for he would have said any thing in the&#xD;
world sooner.) "I said that it was a pity&#xD;
you came with this secret in your possession,&#xD;
unless you came to give an open, honest&#xD;
warning to your sister. However, that is&#xD;
over, and we are not likely to gain any thing&#xD;
by going back upon it. You want to know&#xD;
what you must do now to give your evidence&#xD;
for Tyndale. Well, it is a disagreeable ne-&#xD;
cessity, and one which will make any amount&#xD;
of scandal and gossip, but you must go with&#xD;
me to Wexford and testify to the fact that he&#xD;
was in the grounds *ith I/on, before the magis-&#xD;
trates who committed him -like a couple&#xD;
of fools as they are!"&#xD;
"To Wexford !-must Igo? "said Norah.&#xD;
She shrank back piteously, and covered her&#xD;
face with her hands. A terrible, cowardly&#xD;
instinct said, "Why did you not keep silence,&#xD;
and this need not have been?" A vision&#xD;
of all the scandal, and gossip of which he&#xD;
spoke rose up before her. How could she&#xD;
meet it-court it, as it were?&#xD;
"You must certainly go, unless you mean&#xD;
to let that poor fellow suffer all the conse-&#xD;
quences of what you say was no fault of his,"&#xD;
answered Mr. Middleton, dryly. "I am as&#xD;
loath to advise such a thing as you can be to&#xD;
do it, for it will let loose a thousand tongues'&#xD;
like so many hounds upon you, upon Leslie,&#xD;
upon all of us; but there is no alternative.&#xD;

&#xD;
to pay heavy penalties sometimes for appoint-&#xD;
ing midnight interviews in the grounds."&#xD;
His tone roused Norah more quickly than&#xD;
any thing else could have done. 11cr hands&#xD;
dropped, and she looked up. The short-lived&#xD;
color had ebbed from her face; it was pale&#xD;
again and very firm. In that moment,&#xD;
"strength came to her ithat equaled her de-&#xD;
sire." She put the weakness, which had al-&#xD;
most conquered her, down, and set her foot&#xD;
upon it.&#xD;
"You are right," she'said-her voice was&#xD;
as clear and steady as the notes drawn from&#xD;
a violin by a master's hand "the conse-&#xD;
quences of what has happened must fall&#xD;
where they belong, and they certainly do not&#xD;
belong to Captain Tyndale, whose only fault&#xD;
is that he has served his friends too well. I&#xD;
am ready to go with you at once~ After all,&#xD;
what is my name worth, that I should guard&#xD;
it so tenderly 1' Less than nothing if, by&#xD;
bringing a shadow on it, I can clear one on&#xD;
which no shadow belongs!"&#xD;
"In talking that way, I do not think you&#xD;
realize at all-" Mr. Middleton began, shocked&#xD;
by the recklessness which was ready to sac.&#xD;
riflee even that which women in general hold&#xD;
to be worth nsore~ than life. But, as he spoke,&#xD;
a figure stood in the open door, the appear-&#xD;
ance of which hushed the words on his lips.&#xD;
It was Leslie, with the long veil which she&#xD;
wore thrown back from her fair face-a face&#xD;
which the majesty of sorrow lifted into a&#xD;
nobler beauty than it had ever known before.&#xD;
It was but an instant that she stood there-&#xD;
framed like a beautiful and touching picture&#xD;
to their sight - then, seeing that the room&#xD;
was not empty as she had imagined, she&#xD;
turned, without a word, and passed across&#xD;
the hail and up to the staircase, her head&#xD;
drooping a little, but her whole bearing other-&#xD;
wise unchanged.&#xD;
Though she had come.and gone so swiftly&#xD;
and so noiselessly, her appearance, which had&#xD;
broken the thread of their conversation,&#xD;
seemed to come with a certain strange appeal&#xD;
to both of them. It seemed to plead for gen-&#xD;
tle thoughts and merciful silence toward him&#xD;
whom she mourned, him from whose dead&#xD;
presence she had come. "We must think&#xD;
of her!" Mr. Middleton muttered; and, as&#xD;
he spoke, his wife entered the room.&#xD;
"Are you here, George?" she said, with&#xD;
a gleam of pleasure coming over her sad,&#xD;
weary face. "How glad I am of it! I have&#xD;
&#xD;
just been making myself doubly miserable by&#xD;
thinking how worn-out and worried you must&#xD;
be I Are you not tired to death, dear?" she&#xD;
asked, laying one hand on his shoulder as&#xD;
she reached his side. It was a gesture full&#xD;
of tenderness, and as near a caress as Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton would have permitted herself in the&#xD;
presence of a third person.&#xD;
"I suppose I am," said George, taking the&#xD;
hand into his own, "but I have not had time&#xD;
to think about it. One thing has followed&#xD;
so fast on another. Sit down, Mildred: I&#xD;
have a great deal to say to you, and you are&#xD;
just in time.. Miss Desmond tells me that&#xD;
you have heard of Tyndale's arrest?"&#xD;
"Is it true, then? Servants have such a&#xD;
singular capability for distorting facts, that&#xD;
I never know what to believe, that comes&#xD;
through them-but they were all very posi-&#xD;
tive about it at Strafford"&#xD;
"It is unfortunately quite true. He has&#xD;
been arrested, examined, and committed to&#xD;
prison by those pillars of law and wisdom,&#xD;
Colville and Furcell."&#xD;
"0 George, is it possible ? - how ter-&#xD;
rible! What grounds are there for such a&#xD;
charge?"&#xD;
"Scant enough grounds, but it is astonish-&#xD;
ing what a number of blockheads there are&#xD;
in the world. I knew all the time that the&#xD;
whole charge was absurd, but because he was&#xD;
not able-or, rather, because he would not&#xD;
say exactly what he was doing at midnight in&#xD;
my grounds, they committed him to jaiL"&#xD;
"At midnight !-but what ices he doing at&#xD;
midnight here?" exclaimed Mrs. Middleton.&#xD;
"Every one had gone home some time before&#xD;
that, and Captain Tyndale I was sure-I' was&#xD;
certainly under the impression-left early in&#xD;
the evening I',&#xD;
Mr. Middleton looked at Norab, Now&#xD;
was her time to speak. But what woman has&#xD;
not felt what Norah felt then, that it is easier&#xD;
to make almost any cause good to a man&#xD;
~than to a woman? She flushed and paled as&#xD;
she felt her hostess's glance follow her hus-&#xD;
band's and rest on her face. But, if the ex-&#xD;
planation must be given, it might as well be&#xD;
given at once. That thought nerved her to&#xD;
return the look of the cold eyes bent on her,&#xD;
and say:&#xD;
"Captain Tyndale did leave the grounds&#xD;
early in the evening; but he came back-to&#xD;
meet me."&#xD;
The audacity of this assertion almost took&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. Mid4~leton's breath away. "To meet&#xD;
you, Miss D~smond-.at midnight! Is it pos-&#xD;
sible that I hear you aright?" -&#xD;
You certainly hear me aright, madam,&#xD;
though you may not understand me," Norah&#xD;
answered. "I repeat that Captain Tyndale&#xD;
came to meet me, that he was sitting with me&#xD;
on the steps of the summer-house when we&#xD;
were startled by hearing a pistol-shot, and&#xD;
that he was with me for some time afterward&#xD;
-facts which prove conclusively that he&#xD;
could not have been the assailant of his&#xD;
cousin."&#xD;
"They may prove that," said Mrs. Middle-&#xD;
ton, with icy coldness, "but you must excuse&#xD;
me if I say that they also prove that you have&#xD;
very little idea of decorum. You are a young&#xD;
lady in my house and under my care, Miss&#xD;
Desmond, therefore I have a right to say--&#xD;
indeed it is my duty to say-that such con-&#xD;
duct as t1his is totally opposed to any code of&#xD;
propriety with which I am acquainted."&#xD;
"That may very readily be," said Norah.&#xD;
"But it is enough for me that I hold the&#xD;
necessary evidence for clearing the name of&#xD;
an innocent man-a man who came to meet&#xD;
me, not, as you may imagine, madam, because&#xD;
he wished to flirt with me, but because he&#xD;
was anxious to serve the interests of his&#xD;
cousin and of Leslie."&#xD;
"And pray may I ask," said Mrs. Middle-&#xD;
ton, haughtily, "what possible concern there&#xD;
was between a midnight interview with youi-&#xD;
self and the interests of Mr. Tyndale and&#xD;
Leslic?"&#xD;
"More than you imagine, perhaps," was&#xD;
the reply. "More than I like to remember,&#xD;
for it is the bitterest memory of my life that&#xD;
I was once engaged to Arthur Tyndale."&#xD;
"You!" said Mrs. Middleton with a gasp. -&#xD;
She could say no more. If she had not been&#xD;
the thorough-bred woman that she was, she&#xD;
would have said, "It is false!" As it was, I&#xD;
her look said it for her, and Norah caught&#xD;
that look.&#xD;
"I see that you do not believe me," she&#xD;
said. "Fortunately, your' belief is not a mat-&#xD;
ter of any importance. If It were, proofs, ~&#xD;
and to spare, are ready to my hand. Mr.&#xD;
Tyndale's letters are still in my possession,&#xD;
though it was to return them that I met Cap- a&#xD;
tam Tyndale on Saturday night. I am dull a&#xD;
on the subject of decorum, 1 suppose, but I a&#xD;
could certainly see no glaring impropriety in t&#xD;
turning from my last good-night to your t&#xD;
&#xD;
guests, and going to fulfill an appointment&#xD;
with him at the summer-house in order to&#xD;
speak without interruption on a matter which&#xD;
in reality concerned either of us very little.&#xD;
I was willing to relinquish Mr. Tyndale's&#xD;
letters-relics as they were of a past which&#xD;
had lost all association save that of pain for&#xD;
me-but I should have been mad if I had&#xD;
given them up without some pledge of good&#xD;
faith from him. This he refused to give,&#xD;
and so the letters are still in my possession.&#xD;
"If this is all true," said Mrs. Middleton,&#xD;
"and I-I can scarcely realize that it is-do&#xD;
you appreciate how great yotfr duplicity has&#xD;
been? If Mr. Tyndale was so utterly false&#xD;
to Leslie, what were you? What did you ex-&#xD;
pect to gain by it?" shejcried, with a passion&#xD;
which was totally foreign to her usual manner.&#xD;
"You must have had an object--you could&#xD;
not have come here and made all this mischief&#xD;
without one!"&#xD;
"I cannot cntci upon my object now,"&#xD;
said Norah, putting her hand with a sudden,&#xD;
involuntary gesture to her head. It was not&#xD;
strange that the latter began to swim a little,&#xD;
that she began to ask herself when and where&#xD;
all this would end. Then she turned abruptly&#xD;
to Mr. Middleton.-" Are we not wasting&#xD;
precious time?" she said. "Should I not go&#xD;
at once and give my evidence? Surely they&#xD;
will not refuse to hear it without delay. And&#xD;
every hour counts with Aim- Captain Tyn-&#xD;
dale!"&#xD;
Before Mr. Middleton could answer, his&#xD;
wife interposed.&#xD;
"Are you mad, Miss Desmond?" she said.&#xD;
Can it be possible that you think of taking&#xD;
~kis-this story-into a court of law? If&#xD;
you have no regard ibr your own good name&#xD;

;ay that I will not allow it! I have a right&#xD;
:o say that you shall not leave this house to&#xD;
~o and drag our names through the mire of&#xD;
ublic gossip and public scandal I"&#xD;
"Madam," said Norah, firmly, "you have&#xD;
io such right at all! Though I have had no&#xD;
advantage of social training, I know i~s well&#xD;
.s you can tell me, that when a woman's rep-&#xD;

almost wistfully, "that I may take the whole&#xD;

ton.&#xD;
'~ I do not think so," he answered, hesi-&#xD;
tatingly-" at least, I hope not.-I am afraid&#xD;
there is no help for it, Mildred," he added,&#xD;
turning to his wife. "I feel it as much as&#xD;
you can do, but I see no alternative. Cap-&#xD;
tahi Tyndale, like a man of honor, has re-&#xD;
fused to say what brought him into the&#xD;
grounds. For this silence he is now suffer-&#xD;
ing, and since Miss Desmond knows what&#xD;
~ brought him-since she saw and spoke with&#xD;
him-it is only right that she should give her&#xD;
evidence in his favor."&#xD;
"Not at such ~. sacrifice as this," said&#xD;
Mrs. Middleton, with a face set like graniI~e.&#xD;
"Captain Tyndale is a man-he is able to&#xD;
endure suspicion. But for a woman to come&#xD;
forward and give such evidence ag'~iinst'her-&#xD;
self-it is beyond every thing that he could&#xD;
ask or expect."&#xD;
"There is no help for it," repeated Mr.&#xD;
Middleton, with a sigh. Then he turned to&#xD;
Norah.-" You are right, Miss Desmond,"&#xD;
he said, coldly. "We are wasting valuable&#xD;
time.' If you will put on your bonnet, I will&#xD;
drive you into Wexford and try to settle the&#xD;
business at once."&#xD;

WHEN Norah went up-stairs to put on her&#xD;
bonnet as Mr. Middleton had directed, she&#xD;
paused in the act of doing so, and looked in-&#xD;
tently at her face as reflected in the mirror.&#xD;
( t was paler thnu usual, but this paleness, in-&#xD;
tend of detracting from its loveliness, rather&#xD;
*    drew' attention from the mere brilliance of&#xD;
coloring to the perfect outlines of the nobly-&#xD;
cut features, to the richsculpturesque waves&#xD;
&#xD;
OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
of her chestnut hair, and the full-orbed splen-&#xD;
dor of the eyes. Any woman might well have&#xD;
been content with such a face,' yet Norah&#xD;
'looked uncertain and dissatisfied. In truth,&#xD;
she was wondering what effect her beauty&#xD;
would have upon the magistrates whom she&#xD;
expected to confront, and whether she had&#xD;
better enhance it-as a pretty woman knows&#xD;
so well how to do-or to disguise it as much&#xD;
as possible-which it would have been im-&#xD;
possible to do in any perceptible degree. She&#xD;
had not lived nineteen years in the world&#xD;
without having learned to appreciate fully&#xD;
the power which this face exercised over&#xD;
men of all ages and all degrees. Wherever&#xD;
she went, the sterner sex (called thus in&#xD;
irony!) were willing and ready to do her 8cr.&#xD;
vice, obdurate officials melted at a glance&#xD;
from her eyes, no one was too high or too&#xD;
low to refuse her the homage to which beau-&#xD;
ty is entitled, and which it ever commands.&#xD;
The question she now asked herself was&#xD;
whetherthis beauty would tell for or against&#xD;
Max'Tyndale. Would the magistrates yield&#xD;
their point to her, as many men, older and&#xD;
wiser had done before? or would they fall&#xD;
into the grave error of thinking that it was&#xD;
love or admiration for lwr which had drawn&#xD;
Max to Roslaxid on that fatal night 1' In that&#xD;
case-if they once had a clew to her connec-&#xD;
tion with Arthur Tyndale-her beauty might&#xD;
very readily work harm instead of good.&#xD;
"Is not here a cause," they might say, "a&#xD;
cause of strifeand bloodshed old as humani-&#xD;
ty? Need we go farther than that fair face&#xD;
to find a reason for all that has occurred?"&#xD;
Having given this probability due weight,&#xD;
and after mature deliberation-deliberation&#xD;
so mature, indeed, that Mr. Middleton grew&#xD;
quite impatient below-~-Norah, who had as&#xD;
little vanity as any woman, short of a nun,&#xD;
could possibly possess, decided to make her-&#xD;
~self as plain as possible. She descended,&#xD;
therefore, in the course of the next ten min-&#xD;
utes, wearing her traveling-bonnet, with all&#xD;
the rich masses of her hair hidden almost en-&#xD;
tirely from sight, and a heavy veil over her&#xD;
face. Mrs. Middleton had disappeared. Al-&#xD;
though she had not yielded to her husband&#xD;
far enough to admit that this disagreeable&#xD;
step might' be a necessity, she did not choose&#xD;
to make any further "scene" by opposing it.&#xD;
But she had declared, very decidedly, that she'&#xD;
could not see Norah again before she left.&#xD;
"I cannot trust myself," she averred. "I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
NQRAH BEFORE&#xD;
do not know what I might say. There arc&#xD;
no words to express the bitterness I feel tow-&#xD;
ard her. It was a black day for all of us-&#xD;
but especially for poor Leslie-when she first&#xD;
set her foot across this threshold. I felt it&#xD;
then as clearly as I know it now. Oh, why&#xD;
de we not heed our own instincts more often&#xD;
than we do? They are so seldom wrong."&#xD;
So it came to pass that Norah found only&#xD;
Mr. Middleton awaiting her. The carriage was&#xD;
at the door. "You will be stared at enough,&#xD;
unavoidably," he said, grimly. "I do not&#xD;
~choose for you to be stared at in any way&#xD;
which can possibly be avoided, so I ordered&#xD;
this."&#xD;
The drive from Rosland to Wexford was&#xD;
short under all circumstances, but it seemed&#xD;
to Norah now of no length at all. Sliq would&#xD;
gladly have drawn it out to twenty miles, so&#xD;
much did she dread the ordeal before her,&#xD;
but, un4uckily, it was out of her power to&#xD;
add another yard to the road over which the&#xD;
horses trotted as gayly as if the sinking heart&#xD;
behind had not wished them shod with lead.&#xD;
This was when she thought of herself. When&#xD;
she thought of Max the way seemed to length-&#xD;
en interminably, and the horses to creep.&#xD;
But, although she hated herself for doing so,&#xD;
it was natural that just at this time she&#xD;
should think most of herself. That whi~&#xD;
lay before her might well have daunted the&#xD;
courage of the bravest woman alive-for&#xD;
bravery does not mean audacity, fa~jt less&#xD;
shametessness Norah was not afraid that&#xD;
her courage would fail her when it was need-&#xD;
ed, and she kept every cowar~lly doubt and&#xD;
fear locked fast in her oi~'n breast; but, all&#xD;
the same, she shrank, as any woman with a&#xD;
woman's instincts must have done, and wished&#xD;
unavaiIin~ly that such a necessity might have&#xD;
been spared her. Very little was said, either&#xD;
by Mr. Middleton or herself, on the way. He&#xD;
gave her a few directions with regard to the&#xD;
manner in which it would be best for her to&#xD;
give her testimony, aud added, with a sigh&#xD;
of relief; that he was glad she was not like.&#xD;
ly to be nervous, or to lose her head. "Wom-&#xD;
en usually make complete fools of them-&#xD;
selves," he added, candidly.&#xD;
As they entered Wexford he grew a little&#xD;
nervous himself. "Purcell can refuse an.&#xD;
otherexainination if he chooses," he said to&#xD;
Norah, "and he may do it out of spite to me.&#xD;
I told him very plainly what I thought of his&#xD;
~onduet this morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MAGISTRATE.                     203&#xD;
"And if he refuses," said Norah, aghast,&#xD;
"what then?"&#xD;
"Then we shall have to apply for a writ&#xD;
of ka6eas corpus, and take him before the&#xD;
judge of the district."&#xD;
"Him! Do you mean the magistrate!"&#xD;
"The magistrate !"(with a laugh), "not&#xD;
exactly. Tyndale, I mean." Then, putting&#xD;
his head out of the window, "Drive to Mr.&#xD;
Purcell's house," he said, to the coachman-&#xD;
adding, to Norah, as he drew back-" He is&#xD;
more likely to be there than anywhere else&#xD;
this time of day."&#xD;
When the carriage drew up before Mr.&#xD;
Purcell's house-a pleasant, rambling, double.&#xD;
story building, in a large grove-Mr. Middle-&#xD;
ton alighted, and told Norah to remain where&#xD;
she was., "I'll see if he is here, nndifhe&#xD;
will grant the examination," he said. "He&#xD;
may be more reasonable when he hasn't got&#xD;
Colville by."&#xD;
"Please persuade him to do it," said No-&#xD;
rah. "I know you can if' you will try! Or&#xD;
take me along and let me try!"&#xD;
"That is not necessary," said Mr. Middle.&#xD;
ton, who did not rate as highly as he should&#xD;
have done the valuable aid of Norah's lovely&#xD;
face and Norah's eloquent tongue. So ho&#xD;
went to the house alone-passing up the&#xD;
shaded walk, across the piazza, on which were&#xD;
several chairs and a child's rocking-horse, to&#xD;
~he wide-open doors of the hall. Here, as&#xD;
Norah's keen eyes perceived, a gray-whis-&#xD;
ke~ed gentleman met him, and, sitting down&#xD;
in full view, they proceeded to talk. She&#xD;
watched them eagerly-trying to gain some&#xD;
idea of what they were saying from the dumb&#xD;
show of gesture and the expression of atti-&#xD;
tude. Passers-by on that quiet village street&#xD;
were few, but even those few cast curious&#xD;
glances at the beautiful face, from which the&#xD;
disguising veil had been carelessly pushed&#xD;
aside. For once, Norah was unconscious of&#xD;
either attention or admiration. What were&#xD;
they saying? When, w quId they have done?&#xD;
Did the magistrate menb to grant the exami-&#xD;
nation? These were the impatient questions&#xD;
which filled her mind.&#xD;
Suddenly an instinct came to her that the&#xD;
magistrate did tact mean to grant the exami-&#xD;
nation. How this impression was conveyed&#xD;
she did not know, neither did she stop to&#xD;
doubt its accuracy. Her impatience became&#xD;
uncontrollable, and the desire to act, which&#xD;
was always her governing impulse, ~med to&#xD;
&#xD;
p&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="204-205" xml:id="VAC8066-00000117"/>&#xD;
take irresistible possession of her. Before&#xD;
she was scarcely aware of what she meant to&#xD;
do~ she hadstepped from the carriage, crossed&#xD;
the sidewalk, and opened the gate. A mlii.&#xD;
ute later she was moving quickly up theover.&#xD;
shadowed walk, conscious that the two gen-&#xD;
tlemen were regarding her with considerable&#xD;
surprise from the piazza.&#xD;
As she ascended the steps they both rose.&#xD;
Mr. Middleton looked annoyed as well as sur.&#xD;
priced. He had found Mr. Purcell very im-&#xD;
practicable indeed, and was provoked that&#xD;
Norah should have come forward in this un-&#xD;
necessary manner.&#xD;
"I am afraid I have kept you aidingng&#xD;
some time, Miss Desmond," he said, stiffly.&#xD;
Then, turning to the magistrate, he added:&#xD;
"This is the witness of whom I spoke.-Miss&#xD;
Desmond, let me introduce Mr. Purcell."&#xD;
"I came in to see Mr. Purcell," said No-&#xD;
rah, in her frank, clear voice. She declined&#xD;
by a gesture the chair which Mr. Purcell&#xD;
hastened to offer. He, on his part, was as&#xD;
much struck by her beauty as she could have&#xD;
desired, and felt an involuntary softening of&#xD;
his resolution, if not of his heart. He had&#xD;
not looked for any thing so interesting as this&#xD;
dazzling young lady. Mr. Middleton had 1&#xD;
spoken of a witness, but he had entered into&#xD;
no particulars, and Mr. Purcell ,having his&#xD;
pride and obstinacy both in arms, had de-&#xD;
clined to grant another examination. Now&#xD;
he began to feel a little 'curiosity to hear&#xD;
what the witness had to say, and Norah did&#xD;
not leave him long in doubt on this point.&#xD;
"It is likely that I am very presumptuous&#xD;
in fancying that I may be able to influence&#xD;
you more than Mr. Middleton," she said, with&#xD;
a smile that nearly took the worthy magis-&#xD;
trate's breath away; "but I could not remain&#xD;
quiet when so much depends on your dcci.&#xD;
sion, and I have come to say that I hope you&#xD;
will grant the examination. Surely" (look.&#xD;
ing at him with anxious, wistful deprecation)&#xD;
"you have not refused to do so ~&#xD;
"I-I have been telling Mr. Mi~dleton&#xD;
that I-really I cannot see why I should do&#xD;
so," answered Mr. Purcell, stammering like a&#xD;
school-boy. "It was in Captain Tyndale's&#xD;
power to have brought forward any evidence&#xD;
which he desired to produce, and he not only&#xD;
refused to do so, but his refusal was given in&#xD;
a very curt and contemptuous manner. There.&#xD;
fore, I cannot see-"&#xD;
"Shall I tell you why he refused ?" inter. I&#xD;
&#xD;
erupted Norab, with her eyes glowing like two&#xD;
stars. "It was because he did not wish to&#xD;
bring me into notoriety, as a witness in his&#xD;
favor I-it was because he would not shield&#xD;
himself by throwing the least shadow on a&#xD;
woman's name. I was with Captain Tyndaic&#xD;
during the time that he was in the Rosland&#xD;
grounds, Mr. Purcell, and, although he did&#xD;
not choose to summon me as a witness, I have&#xD;
come to testify on his behalf. Do you mean&#xD;
to tell me that you are going to refuse to hear&#xD;
my evidence ? '~&#xD;
"Certainly not," answered Mr. Purcell,&#xD;
promptly.' "I-of course, this alters the&#xD;
state of the case entirely. If it was a natural&#xD;
and commendable reluctance to drag you into&#xD;
such a matter which made Captain Tyndale&#xD;
refuse to summon you as a witness, it is pos-&#xD;
sible for me to stretch a point, and have an-&#xD;
other examination of the case.-Usually, how-&#xD;
ever," turning to Mr. Middleton, with an evi-&#xD;
dent desire to save his credit, "this would be&#xD;
quite irregular. After the prisoner has been&#xD;
committed, the only proper way to procure&#xD;
another examination is by means of a writ of&#xD;
habeas cos-pu~, issued by-"&#xD;
"I know all about that," said Mr. Middle-&#xD;
ton, impatiently. "But it is only a-hem l~&#xD;
exceptional magistrate who adheres so rigidly&#xD;
to the letter of the law. There's latitude in&#xD;
these things, Purcell-great latitude. But,&#xD;
since you have finally decided in favor of the&#xD;
examination, suppose that we have it over at&#xD;
once 1' It is an unpleasant business ~o Miss&#xD;
Desmond under any circumstances, and the&#xD;
sooner it is dqne the less attention it will cre-&#xD;
ate."&#xD;
Mr. Purcell made no difficulty about this.&#xD;
He suddenly became as obliging as possible&#xD;
-so obliging, indeed, that Mr. Middleton felt&#xD;
that he had made a great mistake and* lost&#xD;
much time in not bringing Norah forward at&#xD;
once. If the truth had b~en known, how-&#xD;
ever, he would have learned that the worthy&#xD;
magistrate was not only fired with chivalric&#xD;
gallantry by Norah's exquisite face, but he&#xD;
was also burning with curiosity to learn-&#xD;
as it would be his "duty" to do-what part&#xD;
in the tragedy she had played; for, alas!&#xD;
Norah's misgivings were true. Mr. Purcell j~&#xD;
had already settled in his own mind what ~&#xD;
her r6le had probably been.' This was the&#xD;
ill turn which that delusion and snare, called&#xD;
beauty, did for her.&#xD;
They drove at once to the justice-room,&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
and the prisoner was sent for. His first , e-&#xD;
quest when left alone had been for pen and&#xD;
paper, and he was writing a letter to Norah&#xD;
when the sheriff came for him. In this letter&#xD;
he had forcibly stated the reasons why she&#xD;
should keep silence with regard to having&#xD;
met him on that fatal night, and it may be&#xD;
imagined, therefore, that his surprise and&#xD;
consternation were great when he entered&#xD;
the justice-room, where the first person whom&#xD;
he saw was Norah, sitting by Mr. Middleton.&#xD;
He uttered an exclamation, and would have&#xD;
walked up to her immediately, if the magis-&#xD;
trate had not interfered.&#xD;
"Excuse me, Captain Tyndale, but I must&#xD;
ask yoi~ to defer speaking to the witness until&#xD;
after she has given her testimony. I have&#xD;
been induced to relax my usual rules and&#xD;
grant your case another investigation, be-&#xD;
cause I have been informed that she- has im-&#xD;
portan~ evidence to offer in your behalf-"&#xD;
"I think there is some mistake," inter-&#xD;
rupted Max, impetuously. "Miss Desmond&#xD;
knows nothing-it is impossible that she can&#xD;
know any thing-bearing at all upon what you&#xD;
are good enough to call my 'case;' in other&#xD;
words, the death of my cousin."&#xD;
"Miss Desmond is certainly the best&#xD;
judge of what she knows," answered the&#xD;
magistrate. He had no liking for this brusque&#xD;
young soldier, and did not hesitate to show&#xD;
as much. "Be good enough to sit down and&#xD;
keep quiet, sir.-Miss Desmond, I am ready&#xD;
to hear your evidence."&#xD;
Then Norah, who had not spoken to Max&#xD;
-who, indeed, had not done more than barely&#xD;
give one glance at him as he entered-ad-&#xD;
vanced to the table, behind which the magis-&#xD;
trate was sitting. Despite Mr. Middleton's&#xD;
anxiety to get the thing over and keep it&#xD;
quiet, the' news of another~ examination had&#xD;
spread, and a considerable number of sight-&#xD;
seers had followed in the train of the sheriff&#xD;
and prisoner. Fr~m lip to lip the intelligence&#xD;
had passed that Mr. ;Middleton had brought&#xD;
in a lady to give evidence-a young lady, a&#xD;
pretty lady, those who had seen her in the&#xD;
carriage at Mr. Purcell's gate averred-there.&#xD;
fore the justice-room was filled in an almost&#xD;
incredibly short space, and Norah faced quite&#xD;
an audience when she rose.&#xD;
Then it was that the training of her life&#xD;
stood her in good stead. If her beauty, when&#xD;
she threw back her veil, sent a thrill through&#xD;
all present, the supreme dignity and grace of&#xD;
&#xD;
her bearing-her perfect self-possession and&#xD;
complete unconsciousness-astonished them&#xD;
still more. As for Max, he held his breath as&#xD;
he looked at her. He was enraged-enraged&#xD;
that she should causelessly (as he thought)&#xD;
draw down upon herself all the comment, the&#xD;
certain gossip and possible scandal, which&#xD;
would ensue: but he was also fascinated so&#xD;
deeply that for a minute he forgot the pres-&#xD;
ence of every one but herself. He wondered&#xD;
that he had never seen before ahe grandeur&#xD;
that dwelt in those perfect features, the brave,&#xD;
strong, dauntless soul which looked out of the&#xD;
lustrous eyes. In a position where almost&#xD;
any girl would have trembled, and blushed,&#xD;
and faltered-for notanother's woman's face&#xD;
was in the crowded room-she stood like a&#xD;
princess, with no deepening flush of color on&#xD;
~her faiL- face, no quiver of self-consciousness&#xD;
in her manner.&#xD;
Having taken the necessary oath, she&#xD;
made her statement in a voice which was dis-&#xD;
tinctly audible to every one present-her&#xD;
clear, pure enunciation serving instead of any&#xD;
elevation of tone.&#xD;
"On Saturday night," she said, "there&#xD;
was a dinner.party' at ~lr. Middleton's. I&#xD;
think it must have been about ten o'clock&#xD;
that Captain Tyndale came up to me as I was&#xD;
sitting on the lawn, and told me that be had&#xD;
been looking for his~cousin, but that, not being&#xD;
~able to find him among the guests, he thought&#xD;
it likely that he had gone back to Strafford.&#xD;
He intended to follow him, he said., in order&#xD;
to speak on a matter of business; and he&#xD;
asked me-since I, also, had some connection&#xD;
with this business-if I could not see him&#xD;
if he came back to Rosland afterward. I&#xD;
thought that the company would probably&#xD;
not be dispersed by that time, and I agreed&#xD;
to do so-telling him that I would meet him&#xD;
at a summer-house in the grounds at half-&#xD;
past eleven o'clock. At that hour the last of&#xD;
the guests were taking leave-most of them&#xD;
saying that they could not stay later because&#xD;
it was Saturday night-and it chanced that&#xD;
nobody observed me when I entered the&#xD;
shrubbery to keep my appointment with Cap-&#xD;
tain Tyndale. I found him waiting for me&#xD;
at the summer-house, and the first, thing&#xD;
which he told me was that his cousin had&#xD;
been drinking so deeply that he was quite&#xD;
impracticable, and had refused absolutely to&#xD;
listen tb him. We were both sorry for this,&#xD;
and discussed it at some length. Afterwar?&#xD;
&#xD;
204                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA..                                                 MISS DESMOND'S TESTIMONY.            205&#xD;
&#xD;
'I.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="206-207" xml:id="VAC8066-00000118"/>&#xD;
THE WHOLE TRUTH.                   207&#xD;
&#xD;
206               A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
we were talking of other things, when iv,&#xD;
were startled by the report of a pistol ap&#xD;
parentlyin the direction of the bridge. Cap&#xD;
tam Tyndale was anxious to go and see wha'&#xD;
it meant, but I objected to being left alone&#xD;
and therefore ha remained with me. ~inee rn&#xD;
other report followed, we did not attach mud&#xD;
importance to the shot, and soon returned t&#xD;
the conversation which it had' interrupted&#xD;
Not very long after this we separated. That&#xD;
sir, is all that I know, and I am sure it is all&#xD;
that Captain Tyndale knows, of the murder of&#xD;
Arthur Tyndale."&#xD;
After the clear tones ceased, there was s&#xD;
moment of dead silence. Mr. Purcell looked&#xD;
as he felt, embarrassed what to say. Th&#xD;
spectators held their breath and pricked theii&#xD;
ears to hear what would come next.&#xD;
As the minute of suspense ended, peopl&#xD;
became conscious that a gray-haired man&#xD;
with bushy, gray eyebrows and a short whiji&#xD;
in his hand, was pushing his way roughly&#xD;
through the crowd to the magistrate's table.&#xD;
This was Mr. Colville, who, by a lucky chance&#xD;
(as he said to himself), had not left town&#xD;
when the news of the second examination&#xD;
reached him. He hurried at once to the jus-&#xD;
tice-room and entered t~ie door in time to&#xD;
hear Norah's testimony. As he came forward&#xD;
now, she, like every one else, turned to look&#xD;
at him, and, although she was not aware of&#xD;
his importance in the eyes of his neighbors&#xD;
or of himself, she recognized at a glance that&#xD;
he was a ~man of influence, and she also rec-&#xD;
ognized that he was an obstinate believ-&#xD;
er in Max's guilt, and' a man who would he&#xD;
proof against even the fascination of her&#xD;
beauty&#xD;
He walked past her as if he had not seen&#xD;
her, and addressed himself with a frowning&#xD;
brow to the magistrate.&#xD;
"I am astonished at this, Purcell-really&#xD;
astonished! If you meant to do any thing so&#xD;
wholly unnecessary and foolish as to grant a&#xD;
second examination, you might at least have&#xD;
notified me of the fact, and not assumed the&#xD;
entire responsibility in this manner."&#xD;
"I should of course have sent and notified&#xD;
you at once, but I thought you had left town,"&#xD;
Mr. Purcell hastened to answer, in rather a&#xD;
deprecating tone. "I - I could not well&#xD;
refuse the examination under the circum.&#xD;
stances," he went on, lowering his voice,&#xD;
"but I "am glad to see you-very glad. I&#xD;
think you will have to take the case in hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
Really, I am quite at a loss what to think.&#xD;
- Here's an alibi proved very~p~inly."&#xD;
"Nothing of the sort," said Mr. Colville,&#xD;
in his hard, rasping voice. "The young lady&#xD;
merely asserts that Captain Tyndale met her&#xD;
at midnight in Mr. Middleton's grounds-for&#xD;
what purpose she does not state - but this&#xD;
fact does not at all exonerate him from the&#xD;
charge against him. The murder may have&#xD;
occurred at any time between midnight and&#xD;
I daylight."&#xD;
Mr. Middleton and Max both rose on the&#xD;
same impulse to speak, but, before any words&#xD;
could escape from the lips of either, Norah's&#xD;
clear voice sounded.&#xD;
"There is one point in my evidence which,&#xD;
in making such an assertion, you certainly&#xD;
overlook, sir. 'I have distinctly testified on&#xD;
oath that Captain Tyndale and myself heard&#xD;
a shot, which effectually proves when Mr.&#xD;
Tyndale was assailed - since I have under-&#xD;
stood that a discharged pistol was found near&#xD;
the scene ofthe struggle."&#xD;
A lawyer could not have made this point&#xD;
more neatly, and so Mr. Colville felt. He&#xD;
first stared and then colored. In his zeal he&#xD;
1~ad' overlooked that fact, and it would have&#xD;
been disagreeable enough to be reminded of&#xD;
it by anybody, but by a girl -it was intoler-&#xD;
able!&#xD;
"You attach more importance to that&#xD;
point than it deserves," he said, sharply.&#xD;
"The pistol which was found had no ap-&#xD;
parent connection with Mr. Tyndale's death.&#xD;
It might very readily have been placed near&#xD;
the spot where the struggle-evidently a per-&#xD;
sonat struggle, closely resembling one which&#xD;
Mr. Tyndale's servant testifies to having wit-&#xD;
nessed in the house-took place, in order to&#xD;
draw off suspicion, and with a view to the&#xD;
fact that you had heard a pistol discharged&#xD;
in that direction at or about midnight."&#xD;
Mr. Middleton and Max looked at each&#xD;
other. "This is intolerable!" said the lat-&#xD;
ter between his clinched teeth; and, regard.&#xD;
less of consequences, he was abOut to step&#xD;
forward, when the elder gentleman's band'&#xD;
fell on his shoulder.&#xD;
"Keep quiet!" he said, though his own&#xD;
voice was trembling with anger. "You'll only&#xD;
do harm, by making a scene.' Not but that I&#xD;
should like amazingly to knock the insolent&#xD;
blookhead down myself !-still, it is best to&#xD;
keep quiet. I believe Miss Desmond will&#xD;
prove a match for him anyhow."&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
"But how on earth can you expect me to&#xD;
stand by and see her browbeaten and insulted&#xD;
on my account 1" said Max, who was almost&#xD;
choking.&#xD;
"He'll not insult~her," said the other, sig-&#xD;
nitKleantI~. "Let hik~i bluster as he will, Col-&#xD;
yule know~ ~gJettar than to try that!"&#xD;
This colloquy, *hich took place in short,&#xD;
nervous whispers, ~did not occupy a minute.&#xD;
With a parting "i~ep quiet!" Mr. Middleton&#xD;
moved forward to the side of Norah. But&#xD;
Norah needed no defender. She regarded&#xD;
Mr. Colville with eyes so steady that they al-&#xD;
most abashed him, and a face filled with elo-&#xD;
quent, indignant scorn.&#xD;
"Your private suppositions, sir," she said,&#xD;
coldly, "cannot possibly affect the evidence.-&#xD;
That," turning to Mr. Purcell, "I have given&#xD;
before the magistrate, and it is for him to act&#xD;
on it."&#xD;
"Mi~. Colville also forgets or ignores one&#xD;
thing," said Mr. Z4dleton, speaking here.&#xD;
"The servant, on wi4se single and unsup-&#xD;
ported evidence all t~iie infamous and insult-&#xD;
ing accusation rests, testified explicitly that&#xD;
he heard Captain Tyndale return to Strafford&#xD;
and enter his room a little after midnight.&#xD;
It follows, there fore, that he must have re-&#xD;
turned home immediately after parting with&#xD;
Miss Desmond."&#xD;
"I really think the case is very strong in&#xD;
his favor, Colville," said Mr. Purcell, in ~&#xD;
whisper.&#xD;
"So far from being in his favor, the case&#xD;
is as strong as ever against him," said Mr.&#xD;
Colville, in a loud, positive voice. His blood&#xD;
and his mettle were both up. He looked&#xD;
upon his colleague as a weak-minded fool,&#xD;
and would not have hesitated to tell him so.&#xD;
He believed that Max was guilty, and he&#xD;
meant to prove him so. The idea that he-&#xD;
the' murderer-should be sent forth scathe.&#xD;
less to enjoy the inheritance of the man he&#xD;
had murdered, seemed to Mr. Colville too&#xD;
monstrous to be allowed!&#xD;
"There is one point-the most important&#xD;
point-which rests in mystery yet, and which&#xD;
it is necessary should be cleared before any&#xD;
evidence can be said to be in the prisoner's&#xD;
favor," he went on, 'after a short pause.&#xD;
'~ This is the subject of his dispute with the&#xD;
murdered man. He refused to give any ac-&#xD;
count of it himself, but, since Miss Desmond&#xD;
has come forward to offer her evidence on&#xD;
another point, it is likely that she may be&#xD;
&#xD;
able to enlighten us also on this.-Will you&#xD;
state," turning to Norah, "what was the ex-&#xD;
act nature of that 'business' which Captain~&#xD;
Tyndale had with his cousin, and in which,&#xD;
you have already said, that you also were&#xD;
concerned)'&#xD;
"That can have nothing to do with the&#xD;
matter-that cannot be necessary'(' said No-&#xD;
rah. Max, watching her closely with eager,&#xD;
anxious eyes, saw that i~he did not flush, but,&#xD;
on the contrary, turned very pale. He thought&#xD;
she would recognize now, with a sense of dis-&#xD;
may, what she had brought upon herself. He&#xD;
did not know that she ha4 seen it all, and&#xD;
counted the cost of it all beforehand.&#xD;
"Do you refuse, then, to answer the ques-&#xD;
tion?" said Mr. Colville, growing exceedingly&#xD;
like a turkey-cock in the face.&#xD;
Norah hesitated. She did not know how&#xD;
far his power extended, but she had a vague&#xD;
fear of consequences if she did refuse. Not&#xD;
consequences to herself- she had flung all&#xD;
thought of herself to the winds-but ,to Mnx.&#xD;
Was the wiwle truth the only ~t~hin which&#xD;
I would clear him? Yet she h*d l~ped to&#xD;
I leave part of it untold, if only I'or Leslie's&#xD;
sake. Suddenly it occurred to her that Mr.&#xD;
Colville had no right to make such an in-&#xD;
quiry, and, acting upon this thought, she&#xD;
turned to Mr. Purcell with the dignity and&#xD;
grace of her bearing unchanged.&#xD;
"I thought that you, sir, were conducting&#xD;
the examination," she said'. "Will you al-&#xD;
low me, therefore, to ask if it is necessary&#xD;
that I should answer the question which this&#xD;
very courteous gentleman thinks fit to address&#xD;
tome?"&#xD;
"This gentleman is Mr. Colville, and a&#xD;
justice of the peace as well as myself," said&#xD;
Mr. Purcell, hurriedly. "I-hem !-think it&#xD;
would be best for you to answer the question&#xD;
he has asked."&#xD;
Norah looked at Mr. Middleton, appeal-&#xD;
ingly, but her glance received no answer.&#xD;
Angry, mortified, indignant, furious with Col-&#xD;
ville, yet knowing that the story of Arthur&#xD;
Tyndale's conduct must sooner or later tran-&#xD;
spire, he' looked down, and dared not trust&#xD;
himself to utter a word lest he should explode&#xD;
in the invectives which he had used once be-&#xD;
fore that day. Then she looked at Max. It'&#xD;
was the first time that their eyes had met,&#xD;
and the mute appeal of her 'glance was too&#xD;
much for the young man, who had momently&#xD;
felt the leash in which he held himself slipping&#xD;
&#xD;

208                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIA.                                                    THE WRONG MAN.                    209&#xD;
&#xD;
from ha grasp. He sprang to his feet with&#xD;
a quick motion, and, before the sheriff or&#xD;
anybody else could interfere, stood by her&#xD;
side.~&#xD;
"Take care that you do not go too far,&#xD;
sir!" he said, addressing Mr. Colville, with a&#xD;
ring in his voice, and a glance in his eye,&#xD;
which made that gentleman take an involun-&#xD;
tary step backward. "The charge on which&#xD;
you have seen fit to cause my arrest is in.&#xD;
- famous and unfounded enough, as you must&#xD;
be aware; but when you undertake to brow-&#xD;
beat and insult a lady, who has generously&#xD;
come forward, of her own accord, to testify in&#xD;
my behalf, you are going too far-muck too&#xD;
* far! If you presume on the fact that I am a&#xD;
prisoner now, you might remember that I am&#xD;
not likely to remain one-~4'or, surely, in~this&#xD;
country judges and juries are not fools as&#xD;
well as magistrates ! - and when I am at&#xD;
liberty, sir, you shall answer for this con-&#xD;
duct, as surely as there is a sun tin the&#xD;
~&#xD;
"Tyndale! Tyndale!" said Mr. Middle-&#xD;
ton, in a warning tone - but M~ax, having&#xD;
yielded himself up to passion, haA no ear&#xD;
for friendly remonstrances. He shook off the&#xD;
other's hand, impatiently, and looked at Mr.&#xD;
Colville with the most fiery eyes which it is&#xD;
likely that gentleman had ever encountered&#xD;
in his life. But Mr. Colville, who was not&#xD;
easily intimidated, saw his advantage, and in&#xD;
a moment seized it.&#xD;
"Any one who doubts this man's guilt,"&#xD;
* said he, looking magisterially -around at the&#xD;
breathless but excited crowd, "has now an&#xD;
opportunity to test the justice of his opinion.&#xD;
The man who would venture to threaten a&#xD;
magistrate in the prosecution of his duty,&#xD;
would, certainly, be capable of assaulting his&#xD;
cousin, with whom he had some mysterious&#xD;
cause of disagreement, and whose heir-at-law&#xD;
he was, in a secluded place at midnight."&#xD;
Whatever this argument might have been&#xD;
called in logic, it had its effect upon the lis-&#xD;
tening crowd. A slight murmur rose. Norah&#xD;
turned to Max.&#xD;
"See what you have done!" she whis-&#xD;
pered. "Pray-pray, go hack and be quiet!&#xD;
I might as well answer the question. It must&#xD;
come out sooner or later."&#xD;
"Don't think of such a thing!" answered&#xD;
he, impetuously. "For God's sake, don't&#xD;
think of it! They have no right-it is in-&#xD;
famous!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Tyndaic, if you don't want a scene, you&#xD;
had better go back to your seat. Colville is&#xD;
speaking to the sheriff," said Mr. Middleton,&#xD;
anxiously.&#xD;
r" The first thing that Mr. Colville knows,&#xD;
he, or his friends, will have something for&#xD;
which to commit me in earnest!" said Max,&#xD;
who felt that patience and forbearance had&#xD;
some time since ceased to be virtues in this&#xD;
particular case.&#xD;
Affairs were in this interesting condition,&#xD;
the spectators were growing more excited,&#xD;
and Mr. Colville more angry every instant,&#xD;
the sheriff was hesitating, Max was defiant,&#xD;
and Mr. Middleton was uneasy, when a young&#xD;
man, who had elbowed his way from the door,&#xD;
and whom nobody had observed in the pre-&#xD;
vailing excitement, walked up to the magis-&#xD;
trate's table and addressed Mr. PurcelL&#xD;
"You have the wrong* man in custody,&#xD;
sir," he said. "I know all the circum-&#xD;
~tances and the cause of Mr. Tyndale's&#xD;
death."&#xD;
ChAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
"1 was too proud the truth to show,&#xD;
You were too blind the truth to know,&#xD;
And so we parted long ago."&#xD;
Ir would be difficult to describe the pause&#xD;
of absolute astonishment which fell over the&#xD;
excited crowd at those words. Every eye in&#xD;
the room turned at once on the new-corner,&#xD;
while Mr. Middleton, wheeling round upon&#xD;
him, uttered an exclamation of mingled amaze.&#xD;
ment and credulity, so violent that it startled&#xD;
every one present.&#xD;
"Great Heaven!" he said, " C'arl I-is it&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"It is I, sir-all ~right!" answered Carl,&#xD;
extending his hand. lie spoke mechanically,&#xD;
and looked so jaded, pale, and grim, that it&#xD;
was not surprising that very few persons had&#xD;
recognized him as lie made lis way up the&#xD;
room. "I did not mean to spring the thing&#xD;
on you like this," he said, as his uncle took&#xD;
the extended hand, half doubtfully, and looked&#xD;
at him with a score at least of interrogation.&#xD;
points in his eyes. "I thought I would go to&#xD;
Rosland, talk it over quietly, and take your&#xD;
advice about the best course to pursue; but&#xD;
when I got off the train ten minutes ago, I&#xD;
heard that ~yndale had been taken up and&#xD;
was being examined, so I thought the best&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
thing I could do would be to come in at once,&#xD;
state exactly how it all occurre'l, and take&#xD;
the consequences, whatever they may be."&#xD;
"But, are you mad?" said Mr. Middle.&#xD;
ton. "It can't be possible that iou know any&#xD;
thing of Arthur Tyndale's death, for you were&#xD;
not even in the county."&#xD;
"You are mistaken," sa~id the young man,&#xD;
quietly. "I know every thing-every thing&#xD;
about it." Then he turned abruptly to&#xD;
Norab. 4. change which' it is hard to analyze&#xD;
came over his face, a quick shiver of passion&#xD;
crept into his voice. "Forgive me," he said,&#xD;
"that I have to drag your name forward. If&#xD;
it were possible to avoid it, I would do so, at&#xD;
any risk or cost to myself!"&#xD;
"My name!" said Norali. "What has&#xD;
my name to do with it?"&#xD;
But even as she i~sked the question, she&#xD;
felt what ~er name had to do with it, and a&#xD;
sudden sense of faintness came over her. It&#xD;
must all be told, then-there was no help for&#xD;
it! The faces around suddenly seemed to&#xD;
swim before her. She turned to Max with a&#xD;
blind instinct that in another moment she&#xD;
would make a scene. "Let me sit down!',&#xD;
she said, faintly.&#xD;
But, after he had taken her to a seat, she&#xD;
detained him and would not allow~ him to&#xD;
open a window or ask for water. "Don't!"&#xD;
she said. "People will think that I have&#xD;
something to dread, and it is not of ,nysclf&#xD;
that I am thinking. You know that."&#xD;
"Bt4 you should think of yourself," he&#xD;
said, angrily. What does this mean? What&#xD;
can this hot-headed young fool have to say&#xD;
about you?"&#xD;
"Only the old ~tory seen from his point&#xD;
of view. Hush! - what is he saying? Let&#xD;
me hear!~~&#xD;
He had taken the oath and was giving his&#xD;
evidence to the magistrate with the manner&#xD;
of one who wishes to tell his story and be&#xD;
done with it. His quick, nervous voice-for&#xD;
it was evident that his coolness was only the&#xD;
result of supreme excitement - rang through&#xD;
the rooms clearly that-everybody heard dis-&#xD;
tinctly all that was said. The silence was&#xD;
profound. Men pressed nearer, but no one&#xD;
spoke. Mr.Purcell listened with the air of&#xD;
a man who has reached tha last point of&#xD;
possible astonishment, Mr. Colville eyed the&#xD;
speaker sternly with an air of mingled sus-&#xD;
picion and incredulity; Mr. Middleton sat&#xD;
down with an audible groan. This was a.&#xD;
14&#xD;
&#xD;
terrible blow to him. Meanwhile, Carl was&#xD;
speaking:&#xD;
"In saying that I am acquainted with the&#xD;
circumstances of Mr. Tyndale's death, I must&#xD;
add that I was unfortunately the cause of&#xD;
that death," he said, with his head upheld,&#xD;
his face white and set, his brown eyes steadily&#xD;
meeting the magistrates'. "The death itself&#xD;
was purely accidental; but~he was struggling&#xD;
with me when it~ occurred-when, stepping&#xD;
back incautiously, he lost his balance-so it&#xD;
is possible that the law will bold me account-&#xD;
able for it. * However that may be, I am here&#xD;
now to speak the truth and clear suspicion&#xD;
from a man who has becir unjustly accused."&#xD;
"You are rather late in coming to speak&#xD;
the truth," said Mr. Colville, abruptly. ~' May&#xD;
I ask where you have been ever since the&#xD;
murder was discovered?"&#xD;
"I will explain that point presently,"&#xD;
said Carl, with a motion of the hand which&#xD;
could scarcely have been more carelessly con-&#xD;
temptuous if he had been brushing afly aside.&#xD;
Then he went on, addressing himself to Mr.&#xD;
Purcell with pointed directness:&#xD;
"In order that you may understand the&#xD;
cause of the struggle which resulted in Mr.&#xD;
Tyndale's death, it is necessary that I should&#xD;
tax your patience far enough to enter into a&#xD;
detail of some personal circumstances which&#xD;
preceded it. ~n last Saturday I decided to&#xD;
leave my uncle's honac for a short visit to&#xD;
some relatives in a lower county. Chancing&#xD;
to drive into Wexford on business during the&#xD;
earlier part of the day, I thought that I might&#xD;
save time, in case I was late at night, by&#xD;
buying my ticket then; so I went to the&#xD;
ticket-office, where I was informed of the&#xD;
change of schedule, which threw the trains&#xD;
several hours later than the time on which&#xD;
they hadbeen running, and where I also heard&#xD;
that Nir. Tyndale was intending to leave Wex.&#xD;
ford that night. This intelligence struck me,&#xD;
for I "-he paused, hesitated, a glow of color&#xD;
came into his face, then paled again.--."I at&#xD;
once connected such an intention with some&#xD;
words which I had overheard by chance that&#xD;
mqyning -words exchanged between Miss&#xD;
Desmond and Mr. Tyndale. They were talk-&#xD;
ing in a summer-house in my uncle's grounds,&#xD;
under the window of which I paesed"-he&#xD;
emphasized this word for Norah, as she felt,&#xD;
though he did not turn his glance on her-&#xD;
"and, in so passing, caught a reference to the&#xD;
ten-o'clock train at night which puzzled me.&#xD;

When I learned the news of Mr. Tyndale's&#xD;
proposed departure, however, all seemed plain&#xD;
enough. I saw then that the man who was&#xD;
engaged to one woman, had asked another&#xD;
womanto ~lope'with him,' and, furthermore; I&#xD;

- "But..sin&amp;amp;e Mr. 'Middleton.is the head of&#xD;

&#xD;
actuated mc," answered Carl, waxing more&#xD;
haughty still. "Why I did not apply to my&#xD;
uncle has nothing whatever to do with the&#xD;
circumstances lam detailing." Then lie took&#xD;
up the thread of his story again.-a story to&#xD;
~which Max and Norah listened as eagerly as&#xD;
any one else: "I entered the Roslax~d grounds&#xD;
unobserved, and 'tbok'my way to the bridge.&#xD;
I had an instinct that I should meet Arthur&#xD;
Tyndale there, and I was not mistakenn' As&#xD;
I crossed the bridge, I saw 'him advancing&#xD;
from the opposite.side toward me. I "-he&#xD;
stopped and hesitated for a minute-" I have&#xD;
scarcely a clear recollection of what followed.&#xD;
I met him just beyond the bridge, and asked&#xD;
him where he was going. He answered with&#xD;
an insolent refusal to tell inc. I charged him,&#xD;
then, his intention. Upon this, he grew&#xD;
very. viol~'~ accused me of insulting inter-&#xD;
ference,: and finally drew- a pistol on me. 1&#xD;
was uiiarmed; but I was the cooler man of&#xD;
the two-besides which, I saw that he had&#xD;
been drinking-and, as he was in the act of&#xD;
firing, I knocked the pistol out of his hand.&#xD;
Then' he sprang at me like a tiger, and we&#xD;
closed. It was a hand-to-hand struggle for a&#xD;
minute or two-how long, exactly, I can't tell.&#xD;
I think he, would have got the best of me, if I&#xD;
had not pressed him-almost unconsciously-&#xD;
toward the edge of the ravine. It was there&#xD;
his foot slipped,'and-with my weight telling&#xD;
against him-he was hurled over. I should&#xD;
have go~ie too, if iliad n~t save4 myself by&#xD;
catching a:small tree.' He went down."&#xD;
Again the speaker's voice ceased abruptly.&#xD;
It was evidently only by.a 'strong effort that&#xD;
he had forced himself to utter the last words.&#xD;
These, words were simple enough, yet there&#xD;
was something in tbem-an.unspoken. power,&#xD;
an expressiOfl of reality-which thrilled every&#xD;
one present. They' all ~felt that they had&#xD;
listened to 'the truth. The magnetism of the&#xD;
youpg man's tones seep~edto bring befoj~e&#xD;
them, like a vivid picture, the midnight strug4&#xD;
gle, with its awful ending. As for him, he&#xD;
laid one hand on the table to steady himself,&#xD;
while with the other be took up and drank oil'&#xD;
a glass of water.; lie had not finished. There&#xD;
was something still to tell and he must ~do it.&#xD;
No ofle; spoke.' Even Mr~ Colville for~ once&#xD;
was silent.' They waited eagerly, breathlessly,&#xD;
until he went on:&#xD;
"I was horribly startled when Tyndale&#xD;
fell-for I knew the height of the bank just&#xD;
there-and I waited for a minute that seemed&#xD;

A STRAIGHTFORWARD STORY.               211.&#xD;
&#xD;
to me an hour, to see if he would move or&#xD;
speak. Since he did neither, I spoke to him.&#xD;
He gave no answer. Then I struggled down&#xD;
the bank as well as I could in the dim light,&#xD;
and went to where he was lying. He "-a&#xD;
short pause-" he breathed once or twice af-&#xD;
ter I reached him, but he neither spoke nor&#xD;
groaned. That is all."&#xD;
"Not quite all," said Mr. Purcell, in a&#xD;
grave voice, after a moment's pause, To him,&#xD;
no more than to any one else~ did any doubt&#xD;
of the statement come. Sometimes there is&#xD;
an irresistible power in truth to ihake itself&#xD;
felt, and this was one of those o .~casions.&#xD;
No sane man could possibly have suspected&#xD;
that any thing like falsehood lurked behind&#xD;
Carl Middleton's white face, and simple,&#xD;
straightforward story. "There is one thing&#xD;
yet," said the magistrate. "If the death oc-&#xD;
curred as y~u have described, why did you not&#xD;
at once summon witnesses and acknowledge&#xD;
the share you had borne in it ? "&#xD;
"Because I was too horror-stricken and&#xD;
excited to take time for rational thought,"&#xD;
the young man answered. "The first im-&#xD;
pulse which came to me when I realized what&#xD;
had happened, was to leave the spot. This I&#xD;
did at once. I retraced my steps to Wexford&#xD;
so rapidly, that I reached there in time for&#xD;
the Alton train, which I took. My undefined&#xD;
intention was to leave the country as soon&#xD;
as possible-not so much because I dreaded&#xD;
any consequences of what had occurred, as&#xD;
because I wished to fling it and all association&#xD;
with it behind me. But, yesterday, cooler&#xD;
thoughts came to mc. I began to realize that&#xD;
the right thing to do was to'come back and&#xD;
tell the truth, especially since I feared that&#xD;
some innocent person.-I did not think of Cap-&#xD;
tain Tyndale, however-might fall under sus-&#xD;
picion. The result proves that this instinct&#xD;
was a right one."&#xD;
"I am sorry-extremely sorry-that Cap-&#xD;
tain Tyndale should have suffered so much&#xD;
annoyance," said Mr. Purcell-it was worthy&#xD;
of note thateven such meagre expression of&#xD;
regret as this stuck in Mr. Colville's throat,&#xD;
as "amen" did in that of Macbeth-" I hope&#xD;
he will remember that I only did my duty ac-&#xD;
cording to the evidence given before me.&#xD;
Such disagreeable mistakes will occur some-&#xD;
times, but it gives me sincere pleasure to re-&#xD;
lease him from custody now, with-with an&#xD;
apology for his detention."&#xD;
"I think you are proceeding rather fast,&#xD;
&#xD;
Purcell," said his colleague, sti~y "The&#xD;
law receives with reluctance-great reluctance&#xD;
'-the evidence of a man against himself. There&#xD;
are one or two points yet to be considered in&#xD;
Mr.-ahem 1-Middleton's testimony. He does&#xD;
not assert, but he leads us to suppose," pro-&#xD;
ceeded this benig~.i minister of justice, "that&#xD;
the ruling motive of the conduct which he&#xD;
describes-very ungentlemanly and insulting&#xD;
conduct, in my opinion-was a violent passion&#xD;
for Miss Desmond, united with jealousy of Mr.&#xD;
Tyndale. But it is a well-known fact that Mr.&#xD;
Tyndale was engaged to Miss Grahame, and it&#xD;
is scarcely likely, therefore, that he should&#xD;
have been contemplating"(Mr. Colville was&#xD;
fond of long words which had an imposing&#xD;
effect) "an elopement with a young lady who&#xD;
is-as I understand-related to Miss Gra.&#xD;
hame."&#xD;
Before Carl could reply-though the quick&#xD;
lightning which leaped into his eyes replied&#xD;
for him-Norah rose and came forward.&#xD;
"Now is my opportunity!" she said, in a&#xD;
nervous whisper to Max, and Max did not try&#xD;
to detain her. He went forward with her,&#xD;
however, and stood by her side while she ad-&#xD;
dressed the magistrate.&#xD;
"If you will excuse me," she said-and her&#xD;
clear, sweet voice thrilled like music on all&#xD;
the listening ears, after the harsh, masculine&#xD;
tones to which they had been hearkening-&#xD;
"I s~houId like to answer now the question&#xD;
which was addressed to me before Mr. Mid~&#xD;
dleton came in-the question relating tothe&#xD;
business which took Captain Tyndale to Straf-&#xD;
ford, and in which I have already said that I&#xD;
was concerned. It will serve to explain and&#xD;
in a measure substantiate the statement which&#xD;
Mr. Middleton has made."&#xD;
I am quite ready to hear any evidence that&#xD;
.yo~ have to offer," said Mr. Purcell, cour-&#xD;
teously. Elopement or no elopement, lie&#xD;
could not resist the charm which Norah's&#xD;
lovely countenance had for him. In fact, he&#xD;
credited nothing in her disfavor, and would&#xD;
not have minded breaking a lance for her iii&#xD;
his old-fashioned way.&#xD;
"I must ask you to believe, then, that it&#xD;
is with deep regret, and only to'explaia things&#xD;
which are misunderstood, and which may be&#xD;
misrepresented, that I speak," she said. "I&#xD;
am more than sorry-oh, much more than&#xD;
sorry-to utter any thing which may reflect&#xD;
discredit on the dead, or whieh can pain the&#xD;
living; but I have no alternative. In justice&#xD;

212                      A DAUGHTER&#xD;
to myself I must ~state the truth-.~-.in which&#xD;
Captains Tyndale will bear me witness."&#xD;
She then began, and, with a clear, un-&#xD;
faltering voice, told the history of all that&#xD;
had occurred between Arthur and herself,&#xD;
together with the part which Max and Carl&#xD;
had played therein; a history which has al-&#xD;
ready been giv~i in detail, and need not&#xD;
again be given in general outline. Mr. Mid-&#xD;
dleton~writhed in his chair: but what could&#xD;
he say? Even if objection would have done&#xD;
any good, how could he object? He had&#xD;
sense enough to know that this, which was&#xD;
important to Norab, was essential to Carl.&#xD;
Without her evidence, the cause of his quar-&#xD;
rel with Arthur Tyndale would have rested&#xD;
on his single, unsupported assertion. Now it&#xD;
was proved beyond question by her testi-&#xD;
mony and that of Max, corroborating all that&#xD;
she said.&#xD;
After the last words were uttered, she&#xD;
drew down her veil and turned away. "That&#xD;
is all I" she said. Then she walked up to&#xD;
Mr. Middleton, who sat with one hand over&#xD;
his eyes, the other resting on the top of his&#xD;
gold-headed cane. "Will you take me to the&#xD;
carriage?" she said to him, in a low, depre-&#xD;
cating voice. "I suppose I may go now-&#xD;
maylnot?"&#xD;
"I suppose these gentleman will kindly&#xD;
allow you to do so, since they have gratified&#xD;
their curiosity by ferreting out all that they&#xD;
wanted to know," he answered, bitterly. He&#xD;
rose as he spoke and offered her his arm.&#xD;
Keenly as he resented her. conduct, "from&#xD;
first to last," as he said to himself, he would&#xD;
not for any consideration have seemed lack-&#xD;
ing in the most minute punctilio o~ respect-&#xD;
especially before all the curious eyes that&#xD;
were bent upon them. Leaning on his arm,&#xD;
she passed down the aisle which the curious&#xD;
crowd, killing back on either side, made-and&#xD;
so out of the justice-room.&#xD;
Mr. Middleton placed her in the carriage,&#xD;
which was waiting on the outside, and then&#xD;
closed the door. "After you havei~aken Miss&#xD;
Desmond to Rosland, bring the carriage&#xD;
back," he said to the coachman. "I must&#xD;
trouble you to explain my absence to my&#xD;
wife, Miss Desmond," he atded-very coldly-&#xD;
to Norah. "Tell her that I will conic as soon&#xD;
as possible-as soon as I get through with&#xD;
those men in yonder, and am able to bring&#xD;
Carl with me."&#xD;
"Had you not better write a line to Mrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
,OF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Middleton?" said Norah. "I-how can I&#xD;
tell her all that has occurred? It is not that&#xD;
I would shrink from the pain on my own ac-&#xD;
count," she added, eagerly, "but it would&#xD;
make it much worse to her if she heard it&#xD;
from me."&#xD;
He knew this was true. "Wait a minute,&#xD;
then," he said, and, opening his pocket-book,&#xD;
he began to scribble a few lines on a blank&#xD;
page. While he was so engaged, Max Tyn-&#xD;
dale (who had taken immediate advantage of&#xD;
his newly-acquired freedom) came up to the&#xD;
doorof the carriage. His face was still very&#xD;
pale, but, his dark eyes were glowing.&#xD;
"Are you going away without even giving&#xD;
me an opportunity to thank you for all that&#xD;
~ou have done for me?" he said, in a low&#xD;
voice-a voice that seemed full of emotion.&#xD;
"What is there to thank me for?" she&#xD;
asked, almost brusquely. "I merely came&#xD;
forward and told the truth. It was you who&#xD;
were enduring suspicion and imprisonment&#xD;
sooner thai~-4han call on me for this evi-&#xD;
dence, as should have done at once."&#xD;
"As I~w9uId have endured a thousand&#xD;
times more~ a~ooner than have done 1" said he.&#xD;
"You canno1~7tell what I felt when I came in&#xD;
and saw yo4i-you cannot tell what I have&#xD;
endured duy:yig this last hour!"&#xD;
"It has been something very hard, even&#xD;
to me-something which I am not likely ever&#xD;
to forget;" she said. "But you see that, un-&#xD;
der any circumstances, it must have come to&#xD;
pass. There was no help for it. If I had not&#xD;
offered myself as a witness for you, I should,&#xD;
no doubt, have been summoned as a witness&#xD;
for Carl Middleton."&#xD;
"Have you suspected him at all?" asked&#xD;
he, looking at her intently.&#xD;
"Not at all-never for a moment. But I&#xD;
feared from the first that you might be sus-&#xD;
pected."&#xD;
"And Leslie-Miss Grahame! What has&#xD;
she thought ?-surely she has not believed&#xD;
that I was guilty?"&#xD;
"No; Leslie did not believe it," answered&#xD;
Norah. She spoke quietly, almost indiffer-&#xD;
ently; but there was a pang at her heart. It&#xD;
was of Leslie, he thought; not of her. She&#xD;
had periled Jier good name in his defense;&#xD;
but all that he cared to learn was whether&#xD;
Leslie, in the midst of her sorrow ~nd in the&#xD;
safe seeIusi~ of her home, had tl4~ught him&#xD;
guilty! At~.3east this was what Norak&#xD;
thought. Sb~would not look at him to read&#xD;
&#xD;
her mistake-if mistake it were-in his eyes.&#xD;
She was buttoning her glove, with fingers&#xD;
much more quick and nervous than her voice,&#xD;
when she said, "What will be the result of&#xD;
all this, us far as that mad boy is con-&#xD;
cerned?"&#xD;
"Nothing very serious, I hope," Captain&#xD;
Tyndale answered. "I left the magistrates&#xD;
deciding at what amount they will fix his&#xD;
bail. He will be at liberty until the grand.&#xD;
jury has taken cognizance of his cas'e."&#xD;
"And then?"&#xD;
"Then they may find a bill against him,&#xD;
and he may have to stand a trial, but the&#xD;
result can only be final acquittal. I have no&#xD;
doubt but that every thing occurred exactly&#xD;
as he states."&#xD;
"Nor I," said she, in a low voice.&#xD;
As she spoke, he saw that she was trem-&#xD;
bling, and it suddenly occurred to him to&#xD;
wonder jwhat Carl Middleton was to her.&#xD;
What right had he possessed to take upon&#xD;
himself the part of defender, which he had&#xD;
played with such woful results? Not that&#xD;
of an accepted suitor, certainly. His own&#xD;
avowal had made that much clear. Indeed,&#xD;
it was very evident that he had quitted Ros-&#xD;
land as a hopeless or rejected suitor. Rut&#xD;
many a hopeless or rejected suitor has pos-&#xD;
sessed the heart of the woman who rejected&#xD;
him, and that MaZ knew. He also knew&#xD;
enough of No~ah Desmond by this time, to be&#xD;
aware that she had sufficient pride to hold&#xD;
aloof even from the man she loved, if she&#xD;
thought that his family would be unwilling to&#xD;
receive her-and of the unwillingness of the&#xD;
Middletons there could be no question.&#xD;
These thoughts went through Max's mind like&#xD;
a fiash&#xD;
"I don't think you need be uneasy about&#xD;
Mr. Middleton," he said. "Your testimony&#xD;
supported his own so well that-"&#xD;
"Here is the note, Miss Desmond," said&#xD;
Mr. Middleton, coming between them. "I&#xD;
am very sorry to have detained you so long.&#xD;
-Bring the carriage back as quickly as pos-&#xD;
sible," he added to the coachman.&#xD;
At this hint Max felt that he must fall&#xD;
back. Not one straight look into Norah's&#xD;
eyes had he gained yet. "She is thinking&#xD;
too much of Middleton to care for me',' he&#xD;
thought, with that exquisitediscerntnent and&#xD;
reason which distinguishes a man to whom&#xD;
love begins to come as enlightened and mys.&#xD;
tifier both at once. Still he leaned forward&#xD;
&#xD;
NORAH'S RETUR&#xD;
&#xD;
N TO ROSLAND.                        213&#xD;
quickly, and took the hand which was ab.&#xD;
sently holding Mr. Middleton's note.&#xD;
"God bless you 1" he said, in a voice&#xD;
which rang in Norab's ears for many a long&#xD;
day afterward. "If I were to try forever I&#xD;
could never thank you for all that you have&#xD;
endured for me-for the revelation of you?.&#xD;
self you have made to me to.dayl There is&#xD;
much yet to be done-at Strafford-which&#xD;
claims my attention now, but I will ~ee you&#xD;
very soon."&#xD;
The words were little-the tone was every&#xD;
thing. If Norah had looked up, a single&#xD;
glaneemight have settled every thing between&#xD;
them; hut Norah did not look up. She dared&#xD;
not. Instinct warned her that tears-or a sug-&#xD;
gestion of tears-were in her eyes, and she&#xD;
wouldhave soonerdied(atI~ast so she thought)&#xD;
than show those tears to gax Tyndale. He&#xD;
was only meaning to th'~nk her -of that&#xD;
she felt sure-and what ere his thanks to&#xD;
her? She steadied her voice until it w~s al-&#xD;
most cold, as she said-&#xD;
"Good-by 0'&#xD;
Only that. The next moment her hand&#xD;
lay iii her lap-a poor, little crushed hand, if&#xD;
she had taken time or thought to feel its pain&#xD;
-and the carriage was driving rapidly away.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
"Man cannot make, bitt may ennoble fate,&#xD;
By nobly bearing It. So let us trust&#xD;
Not to ourselves, but God, and calmly wait&#xD;
Love's orient out of darkness and of dust.&#xD;
"Farewell, and yet again farewell, and yet&#xD;
Never farewell-if farewell mean to fare&#xD;
Alone and disunited. Love hath set&#xD;
Our days, in music, to the self-same air."&#xD;
WHEN Norah reached Rosland, her first&#xD;
act-after having sent the note of which she&#xD;
was the bearer, up to Mrs. Middleton-was to&#xD;
go to Leslie. She found her alone. From&#xD;
exhaustion and weariness, she had fallen into&#xD;
a light sleep, but the sound of the opening&#xD;
door, and the rustle of Norah's dress, as she&#xD;
crossed the room, wakened her. She caine&#xD;
back to consciousness with a start, but the&#xD;
sense of sorrow had not left her even in&#xD;
sleep, and she was spared that keen pang&#xD;
which usually comes with waking to those in&#xD;
grief.&#xD;
"Are you back, Norah?" she said, spring-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="214-215" xml:id="VAC8066-00000123"/>&#xD;
214                      A DAUGHTER~&#xD;
ing to a sitting posture. "Has Captain Tyn.&#xD;
dale been disoharg~d? Is it all over?"&#xD;
"It is all over," said Norah, coming to&#xD;
her side. "He has been discharged. I knew&#xD;
you would be glad to hear it, so Icame to you&#xD;
at once."&#xD;
"Yes, I am very glad to hear it," said&#xD;
Leslie. "But what a terrible charge to have&#xD;
been ~nade against him, of all people! Ar-&#xD;
thur's cousin-I almost feel as if he were&#xD;
Arthur's brother-Norah, were they mad to&#xD;
say such a thing of him?"&#xD;
"They had some show of reason for their&#xD;
suspicions," said Norab, hesitatingly. The&#xD;
truth must be told, and yet she scarcely&#xD;
knew how to tell it. "You know that he&#xD;
was in the grounds with me at midnight.&#xD;
We heard a shot-TI did not tell you this be.&#xD;
fore, dear-and it was then that Mr. Tyndale&#xD;
was killed. We thought very little of it at&#xD;
the time, but you can imagine that such a&#xD;
fact might have thrown suspicion on Captain&#xD;
Tyndale, especially since he would not ac.&#xD;
count for his absence by summoning me as a&#xD;
witness, or, indeed, by mentioning me at all."&#xD;
"Aunt Mildred told me that," said Leslie,&#xD;
simply. "It was not more than I should&#xD;
have expected of him."&#xD;
"It was more than I should have ex-&#xD;
pected," said Norah. "But that does not&#xD;
matter. Of course it was not likely that I&#xD;
should expect any thing more than common&#xD;
courtesy and respect. My testimony went&#xD;
very far toward clearing him," she added.&#xD;
"Indeed, I suppose it would have cleared&#xD;
him entirely, but-"&#xD;
"But what?" asked Leslie, anxiously, as&#xD;
she paused. "Is he not cleared?"&#xD;
"Yes-for the real circumstances of Mr.&#xD;
Tyndale's death are now known."&#xD;
"Known? Are they known?" said Leslie.&#xD;
She started violently, her eyes expanded, her&#xD;
face blanched even whiter than it had been&#xD;
before, her lips enclosed. "Norah I" she&#xD;
gasped. "How was it? Tell me I-I can&#xD;
bear any thing!"&#xD;
"There is nothing worse than you know&#xD;
akeady to bear," said Norah; but as she spoke&#xD;
her heart was beating at a suffocating rate.&#xD;
"Indeed, there may be something better. It&#xD;
scull be better to think that he died by acci-&#xD;
dent, than that he was murdered, will it not?&#xD;
That is what is now known."&#xD;
*     "But, how is it known? "demanded Leslie,&#xD;
feverishly. "Norah, you are keeping some-&#xD;
&#xD;
SOF BOHEMIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
thing from me. I see it-I know it! But&#xD;
you need not be afraid-I can endure any&#xD;
thing! Have you not learned yet how strong&#xD;
I am?"&#xD;
"There is nothing to test your strength in&#xD;
this," said Norah, gently. "Mr. Tyndale's&#xD;
death was purely accidental. You must appre-&#xD;
ciate that, Leslie-you must put all thought&#xD;
of violence away from you-for it was-it&#xD;
was some one whom you know very well who&#xD;
was the unfortunate cause of his death."&#xD;
"Some one whom I know very well!" re-&#xD;
peated Leslie. As she spoke, a whirl of con-&#xD;
jectures passed through her mind. Then a&#xD;
ray. of intuition came to her, and just as&#xD;
Norah, who did not mean to keep her in sus-&#xD;
pense, was on the point of speaking, she ut-&#xD;
tered a cry. "Carl!" she said, catching her&#xD;
sister's hands, in a quick, nervous grasp.&#xD;
"Norab!" Was it-was it Carl ?"&#xD;
Her eyes were bent on Norah's face to de-&#xD;
tect any thing like evasion or subterfuge; but&#xD;
Norah had no intention of employing either.&#xD;
"Yes, itwas Carl," she answered, quietly-so&#xD;
quietly that her words had more of a sooth-&#xD;
ing than an exciting effect. "But, Leslie,&#xD;
you must listen to me, and you must believe&#xD;
me. He had no inure intention of killing&#xD;
Arthur Tyndale than I had."&#xD;
"How did he do it?" asked Leslie. Her&#xD;
lips seemed' parched. A sudden shivering&#xD;
sense of horror came over her. Carl! It&#xD;
had been 'Carl 1 Out of her own household&#xD;
had come: the slayer of the man she loved!&#xD;
Norah saiv that she was thinking this, and&#xD;
her voice sounded almost peremptory. "You&#xD;
must listen to me!" sle repeated. "It is&#xD;
only justice to do so."&#xD;
And then she told Carl's story better than&#xD;
Carl had told it himself-that is, she brought&#xD;
it even more forcibly ana clearly to the coin-&#xD;
prehensio~'ofher listener. She dwelt strongly,&#xD;
yet with 4nfinite gentleness and considera-&#xD;
tion, upon the state in which Max had left&#xD;
his cousin, thus making it apparent that Carl&#xD;
must have spoken truth when he said that&#xD;
Tyndale had been the aggressor in the strug-&#xD;
gle which ended so fatally. Leslie heard her&#xD;
without word or sign. She sank back on the&#xD;
pillows, and covered her face as she listened.&#xD;
When NoraWfinished, a low, shuddering sigh&#xD;
was her only comment on all that she had&#xD;
heard. After waiting vainly for a minute or&#xD;
two, the former bent over her.&#xD;
"Leslie," she said, "do you not believe&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
A SENSIBLE&#xD;
&#xD;
me ?-do you. not believe Carl? Do you not&#xD;
see that it was accident; and that he was not&#xD;
to blame, further than that he should not have&#xD;
interfered in what did fiot concern him?"&#xD;
"I see it all!" said Leslie-and the words&#xD;
were an absolute groan. " You were the be-&#xD;
ginning and end of the whole, Norah!"&#xD;
The words sounded so much like a re-&#xD;
proach, that Norah drew back. She had not&#xD;
meant to do ill, but just then her conscience&#xD;
stabbed her like a sword. It was true! She&#xD;
had been the beginning and the end of the&#xD;
whole! If she had not come to America,&#xD;
Leslie might have been happy still, no more&#xD;
deceived than many another woman has lived&#xD;
and died. But Leslie had not' meant her&#xD;
words for a reproach, and, feeling that retreat-&#xD;
ing motion, she looked up, holding out her&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"Don't misunderstand me," she said; "I&#xD;
did no~ mean to blame you for what was no&#xD;
fault of yours. It is well that I should re-&#xD;
alize it. I was nothing; you were every&#xD;
thing. And it all came from his deception.&#xD;
But Carl-what will be done to Carl?"&#xD;
"Nothing-Captain Tyndale thinks. I&#xD;
have i~ot spoken to your uncle about it. I&#xD;
can see that he feels very bitterly toward&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Why should he?"&#xD;
"Because, as you say, it has been through&#xD;
me that it has all eqine to pass. 0 Leslie,&#xD;
Leslie, can you forgh~e me? I shall never&#xD;
forgive myself-never, never!"&#xD;
Then all the over-wrought calm in which&#xD;
she had been holding herself for so long, gave&#xD;
way-and a great passion of tears burst forth&#xD;
-a passion that fairly startled Leslie, and yet&#xD;
did her good, for it drew her away from her-&#xD;
self. All the inherent gentleness and noble-&#xD;
ness of her character came out then. She&#xD;
put her arms around Norah's shaking form&#xD;
and uttered words of kindness, which the&#xD;
other never forgot. In that hour they be-&#xD;
came sisters in heart as well as in fact. To&#xD;
the tie of blood which hadrhitherto united&#xD;
them, Was added the deeper and rarer tie of&#xD;
sympathy and affection. The shock which&#xD;
would have divided forever two ordinary na-&#xD;
tures, bound these together, showed these&#xD;
one to the other more plainly and more clearly&#xD;
than years of surface intercourse could have&#xD;
done.&#xD;
Yet, when Norah recovered her self-con-&#xD;
trol, she announced a resolution which took&#xD;
&#xD;
RESOLUTION.                        215&#xD;
Leslie by surprise - which, amazed her, in-&#xD;
deed. "I have come to tell you that I must&#xD;
leave you," she said. "Surely you .are not&#xD;
surprised! Surely you know why I must go?&#xD;
It does not require either words or looks to&#xD;
tell me how unwelcome my presence is to&#xD;
your uncle and aunt."&#xD;
"Why should you think such a thing?"&#xD;
said Leslie. "They are too just to visit on&#xD;
you all that has occurred! Norah, you must&#xD;
not think of such a thing! It would be doing&#xD;
yourself a grave injustice in the eyes of the&#xD;
world. People would say-what would they&#xD;
not say if you left us now?"&#xD;
"What people say is a matter of very&#xD;
small importance to me," answered Norah.&#xD;
"I think very l(ttle-too little, perhaps-of&#xD;
that! Besides which, they are likely to say&#xD;
all that you fear, as it is. No, I cannot stay,&#xD;
Leslie-you must not press me to do so. I&#xD;
was wrong ever to come. This world is not&#xD;
my world. I must go back to Bohemia.&#xD;
You have been very good-very kind and&#xD;
very generous-to me, my dear. I shall&#xD;
never forget that. But still I must go."&#xD;
"Norah, it is impossible! Not now-not&#xD;
at once!"&#xD;
"At once!" said Norab, firmly.~ "I am&#xD;
told that a train for Alton leaves Wexford at&#xD;
four o'clock this afternoon. I must take that.&#xD;
Nay, Leslie, my dear Leslie, don't look at me&#xD;
~so imploringly! You cannot tell how many&#xD;
reasons there are which force me to go. IC it&#xD;
seems terrible to you that I should start on&#xD;
such a voyage alone, remember that I have&#xD;
had a different training from any you can&#xD;
ever imagine. Nobody has ever shielded me&#xD;
from the world. I have gone everywhere and&#xD;
done every thing. It would be rather late,&#xD;
therefore, to begin to hesitate about doing&#xD;
this. Even if it seemed as terrible to me as&#xD;
it does to you, I must still do it-I must&#xD;
go."&#xD;
And his was the final ends of all argu-&#xD;
ments, a~I pleadings. She must still do it-&#xD;
she must go! Leslie at last saw that it was&#xD;
hopeless to oppose or attempt' to dissuade&#xD;
her. But, when Mrs. Middleton heard of. the&#xD;
intended departure, she was outraged. This&#xD;
seemed the crowning' stroke of all ~"orah's&#xD;
enormity. "What will people say?" was the&#xD;
thought. "For Leslie's sake, she must be&#xD;
stopped. 1 wish to Heaven she had never&#xD;
come, but since she Ace come, it would be the&#xD;
source of endless scandal for her to leave&#xD;

2168&#xD;
&#xD;
A DAUGHTER OF BOHEM4.&#xD;
&#xD;
like this!~' Yet even Mrs. Middleton remon-&#xD;
strated in vain. Norak was decided. She&#xD;
would g~.&#xD;
Mr~ Middleton, meanwhile, having settled&#xD;
with the magistrates about Carl's bail, was&#xD;
anxious to take the latter back to Rosland&#xD;
with him. But Carl, naturally enough, shrank&#xD;
from that. "It is impossible, sir," he said.&#xD;
"I must go away. I feel like Cain. It is&#xD;
true I did not kill the poor fellow-but lean-&#xD;
not forget that if I had not interfered in&#xD;
what was no affair of mine, if I had not lost&#xD;
my senses, he might be alive now! I cannot&#xD;
go ~back to Rosland. I cannot face Leslie&#xD;
and-and Miss Desmond, with that thought&#xD;
between us. It is impossible 1 "~&#xD;
"Very well," said Mr. Middleton, with a&#xD;
sigh of resignation. "Where are you going?&#xD;
Back to Alton 1"'&#xD;
"Where everybody will be reading this in&#xD;
the morning papers and canvassing it to-mor-&#xD;
row ?-No I I could stand Rosland better than&#xD;
that! I shall go in the other direction-&#xD;
where, I don't know. The farther away, the&#xD;
better."&#xD;
"Go, if you wish to do so," said his uncle.&#xD;
"But don't carry any morbid ideas with you;&#xD;
to lead you into Tresh trouble, perhaps. lie-&#xD;
member that an accident is only an accident&#xD;
in the sight of man and God. After all,"&#xD;
said he, shaking his head, "it may be as well&#xD;
for Leslie. I never had any liking for the&#xD;
*          match, though I did not suspect Tyndale of&#xD;
such dishonorable conduct as he was plainly&#xD;
guilty of."&#xD;
So it happened that Mr. Middleton came&#xD;
back alone to Rosland-a ?act which was a&#xD;
*           relief to every 6ne concerned. "It is, as well&#xD;
that Carl has gone," Mrs. Middleton said,&#xD;
"though it is hard that he should be forced&#xD;
to go." Then she added, bitterly: "Having&#xD;
* given as much trouble as possible in every&#xD;
other way, Miss Desmond is determined to&#xD;
cause any amount of unpleasant talk by leav-&#xD;
ing us Immediately after-after all that has&#xD;
taken place to-day."&#xD;
"Is she going away?" said Mr. Middle-&#xD;
ton. Men usually think less of "unpleasant&#xD;
talk," than women do, and he was honestly&#xD;
relieved by this news. "She has brought&#xD;
trouble enough in her train," he said. "Per-&#xD;
haps she may leave us a little peace when she&#xD;
goes. I think it is a sLensible resolution, Mil-&#xD;
dred."&#xD;
"It is a resolution which shows that she&#xD;
&#xD;
holds her ~'a~ne very lightly-but then, her&#xD;
whole conduct has proved gkat," said Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton. "One could expect nothing else&#xD;
from her rea~ng, I suppose; but it is hard on&#xD;
Leslie-very~4rard."&#xD;
"My dear," said her husband, with un-&#xD;
wonted gravity, " does it occur to you to re-&#xD;
member that her coming, and every thing&#xD;
connected with it, has been Leslie's fault?&#xD;
Do you recollect that morning-last May, was&#xD;
it ?-when we tried to dissuade her from such&#xD;
a step, and warned her of the ill consequences&#xD;
I that might result? I cannot forget that, if&#xD;
she had listened to reason and advice, none&#xD;
of all this would have ocwjrred."&#xD;
"I am sure it was very natural and very&#xD;
generous of her to desire such a thipg," said&#xD;
Mrs, Middleton, who was in arms for her dar-&#xD;
ling instantly. "Though I tried to dissuade&#xD;
her, I knew that, and felt that it was natural,&#xD;
at the time. But there was no excuse for&#xD;
Arthur Tyndale-none! Not any more than&#xD;
for this Bohemian girl I"&#xD;
"I am half afraid that this Bohemian&#xD;
girl, as you call her, may end by marrying&#xD;
Carl at last," said Mr. Middleton, uneasily.&#xD;
"It would be an awful blow if she did, and&#xD;
for that reason I am glad to hear of her in-&#xD;
tended departure. The sooner she goes the&#xD;
better, Mildred-you may be sure of that!&#xD;
What doer a little gossip, more or less, mat-&#xD;
ter in com~arisou-with serious mischief; and I&#xD;
tell you that woman is made to work mischief&#xD;
wherever she goes!"&#xD;
In view of this emphatic opinion, Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton made little further effort to detain&#xD;
Norab. Not that any effort would have mat-&#xD;
1~rcd, or changed the girl's resolution. She&#xD;
felt too plainly th~ coldness and suspicion&#xD;
which~ sui~rounded her, to be able to endure&#xD;
such an atmosphere any longer. Besides&#xD;
which, there was a reason of her own-a pri-&#xD;
vate reason-in the background which im-&#xD;
pelled her to go. More than ever she con-&#xD;
gratulated herself upon having insisted upon&#xD;
being supplied with money enough for such&#xD;
an emergency. "I may not be able to en-&#xD;
dure these people for a day," she had said to&#xD;
her father. "I will not go unless you give&#xD;
me the means to return immediately, if I&#xD;
choose to do so.'~ And he, after much demur,&#xD;
was obliged to comply with this demand,&#xD;
though he cherished a warm hope that, in-&#xD;
stead of coming back immediately, Norah&#xD;
might be going to make or win her fortune.&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
MISS DESMOND'&#xD;
&#xD;
Norah thought rather grimly of those hopes&#xD;
and anticipations, as she packed her trunk.&#xD;
They would h~ve a downfall indeed, when&#xD;
she walked, penniless, in upon her father and&#xD;
Kate, in the shabby Dublin lodgings, which&#xD;
she knew so well.&#xD;
She was nervously anxious to be off; how-&#xD;
ever; and insisted upon leaving as soon as&#xD;
luncheon was over, though Mr. Middleton&#xD;
assured her that the train was not due in&#xD;
Wexford until four o'clock. "It is better to&#xD;
be too early than too late!" she said; and,&#xD;
when the carriage came to the door, she went&#xD;
at once to Leslie's ro9m te~ say farewell.&#xD;
This had been something from which she&#xD;
shrank-with reason. It was bitterly painful&#xD;
on both sides-so painful, that it was short&#xD;
and almost speechless . "This is not the&#xD;
end, Norah," Leslie whispered, with pale,&#xD;
quivering lips. "It cannot be the end of all&#xD;
I hoped-wished-planned. Some day we&#xD;
must meet again. Promise me that."&#xD;
"I see no hope of it now," Norah an-&#xD;
swered. "But if ever there i8 hope, dear, I&#xD;
promise!"&#xD;
And so-they parted,&#xD;
When Norah came down-stairs, she found&#xD;
Mrs. ~audI'ord lfl the hail with Mrs. Middle-&#xD;
ton. The costume of the former was a work&#xD;
of art, expressing chastened regret in the&#xD;
most charming and becoming manner. She&#xD;
was not one of the class of people who wear&#xD;
black dresses to weddings, or gay ribbons at&#xD;
a funeral; it was a point of pride with her&#xD;
to be always dressed according to the oc-&#xD;
casion, and, since she was in a house of&#xD;
mourning, she dressed, if not exactly in&#xD;
mourning, at least in sympathy with mourn-&#xD;
ing. It must have been a very dull person&#xD;
who would not have appreciated at a glance&#xD;
the exquisite sentiment displayed in her at-&#xD;
tire. Her dress of black grenadine was re-&#xD;
lieved by soft white frills Qf illusion, and, in-&#xD;
stead of a jeweled pendant with a chain like a&#xD;
cable, a plain gold cross on a band of black&#xD;
velvet showed to great advantage the white&#xD;
roundness of her throat. She came forward&#xD;
after Mrs~ Middleton had taken leave of No-&#xD;
rak-with an heroic effort to appear cordial&#xD;
'-and held out her pretty, white hands, bound&#xD;
with jet bands (also for sympathy) at the&#xD;
wrists.&#xD;
"I am so sorry that you are going, Miss&#xD;
Desmond," she said-her blue eyes wide open,&#xD;
her dark (penciled) eyebrows arched-" but&#xD;
&#xD;
S DEPARTURE.                       217&#xD;
we must part good friends-I insist upon that!&#xD;
You must forgive all the unlucky mistakes I&#xD;
have made, one way or another, and, if you&#xD;
ever come back to America, I shall be 80 glad&#xD;
to see you at my house in Alton."&#xD;
"You are very good," said Norah, in a&#xD;
tone compounded equally of coldness and&#xD;
scorn, "but it is not at all likely that I shall&#xD;
ever come back to America" (this was what&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford had specially desired to learn),&#xD;
"I am willing to shake hands, however, and&#xD;
wish you much health and happiness, if that&#xD;
is what you mean by parting good friends."&#xD;
"Oh, I mean more, much more than that,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Sandford, with effusion; and before&#xD;
the girl could draw back, she had leaned for-&#xD;
ward and kissed her. "Have you no message&#xD;
for Captain Tyndale 1"' she asked then, with&#xD;
the pleasure which she felt springing, whether&#xD;
she would or no, into her eyes. "Surely you&#xD;
are not going away without leaving a word&#xD;
for him-after your bravery in his behalf, too!&#xD;
I assure you that I shall be very glad to de-&#xD;
liver any message."&#xD;
"I have nothing with which to trouble&#xD;
you," said Norah, even more coldly than be.&#xD;
fore. She drew down her veil abruptly, and&#xD;
turned to Mr. Middleton. "I am ready," she&#xD;
said.&#xD;
He put her into the carriage, and followed&#xD;
himself. To do him justice, he would will-&#xD;
ingly have gone with her to Alton, or even to&#xD;
the seaboard, if Arthur Tyndale's funeral had&#xD;
not interfered. But his first duty, as he said&#xD;
to his wife, was there. He bad told Miss&#xD;
Desmond that, if she would defer her de-&#xD;
parture for twenty-four hours, he would ac-&#xD;
company her; but this offer Miss Desmond&#xD;
declined. There was nothing for him to do,&#xD;
therefore, but to take her to Wexford, see&#xD;
her safely on the train, and telegraph to a&#xD;
friend in Alton to meet her at that point and&#xD;
see that she was safely started with a through-&#xD;
ticket for New York.&#xD;
N~t more than half an hour after the car-&#xD;
riage had rolled away, Mrs. Sandfo' d was&#xD;
sitting on the veranda alone - feeling very&#xD;
much depressed, exceedingly bored, and a&#xD;
little inclined to regret that she had not&#xD;
borne Miss Desmond company as far as Al.&#xD;
ton. The only thing which kept her at Ros-&#xD;
land now was the consideration of Max. She&#xD;
was not likely to forget; that his cousin's&#xD;
death made him pwner of Strafford, and much&#xD;
more besides-elevating him from a fair sub-&#xD;

&#xD;
A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
ject for flirtation to a very gbodparli. The&#xD;
fancy which she had entertained for him all the&#xD;
time, she now felt could very readily become&#xD;
more than a fancy, in the light of this great&#xD;
good fortune. He was one of the few men&#xD;
whom she had ever met who was thoroughly&#xD;
izidifferent to her, and for that reason, more&#xD;
than any other, perhaps, she had bent, and&#xD;
was prepared yet to bend, all her energies to&#xD;
his subjugation. She was thinking of him as&#xD;
she sat under the green shade of the vines, in&#xD;
a low, luxurious chair-as bewitching a pict-&#xD;
ure, taken all in all (stained eyebrows and,&#xD;
powdered complexion thrown~ in!) as a man&#xD;
could ask to see even on that golden summer&#xD;
afternoon.&#xD;
But Max Tyndale was not thinking of be-&#xD;
witching pictures, or caring to see them, as&#xD;
he crossed the lawn where he had last been&#xD;
on the night of the dinner-party, and ascended&#xD;
the veranda-steps on which he had parted&#xD;
with Leslie when he went hi search of Arthur.&#xD;
These things haunted him, together with the&#xD;
dead face he had left behind at Strafford, and,&#xD;
though it wa~ impossible for him not to de-&#xD;
sire to meet Norah, he was able to say hon.&#xD;
estly that he had not come to Rosland for&#xD;
that purpose. He wanted to see Mr. Middle-&#xD;
ton with regard to some of the final arrange-&#xD;
ments which had been left undecided, and he&#xD;
also wanted to escape 'from Strafford and the&#xD;
intolerable gossips who filled it. Nothing was&#xD;
further from his wishes, however, than to&#xD;
meet Mrs. Sandford, and so he started, and&#xD;
did not look particularly pleased, when that&#xD;
fair widow rose out of the green nook and&#xD;
waylaid him, wUh extended hands.&#xD;
"Ah," she said, with a faltering voice,&#xD;
"how can I tell you how glad, how very glad&#xD;
I am to see you!"&#xD;
"Thanks-you are very kind," said Max,&#xD;
taking one of the hands-he could not have&#xD;
conveniently taken the other also, unless he&#xD;
had dropped his hat on the floor-and giving&#xD;
it a nonchalant, indifferent shake which irri-&#xD;
tated its owner very much. Then it occurred&#xD;
to him that he ought to say that he was glad&#xD;
to see her, but, since this would have been&#xD;
stretching the truth to a really alarming ex-&#xD;
tent, he asked, instead, how she was.&#xD;
"Oh, thank you, quite well," she said-for&#xD;
she was very much piqued-" I have sineS been&#xD;
well," she added, on second thought, "but I&#xD;
am better to-day-at least this afternoon. 0&#xD;
Captain Tyndale ! "-a delicately worked and&#xD;
&#xD;
scented handkerchief went to her eyes -&#xD;
"when I think of all that has occurred since&#xD;
I saw you last, I-oh, I wonder how we have&#xD;
all lived through it!"&#xD;
"We can live through a great deal," said&#xD;
Max, knitting his straight, dark brows a little:&#xD;
It is hard to say how this woman's artificial&#xD;
words and tones jarred on him -how he&#xD;
shrank from hearing her touch with any shal-&#xD;
low, ready-made platitudes the subject of that&#xD;
tragedy which had been so awfully real. "How&#xD;
is Miss Grahame?" he asked. "It must have&#xD;
been a terrible ordeal to her."&#xD;
"Leslie bears it better than might have&#xD;
been expected," said Mrs. Sandford; "much&#xD;
better, I am sure, than 1 could have done.&#xD;
She seems almost like herself to-day-though&#xD;
her sister's departure was quite a shock to&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"I suppose you mean her going to Wex-&#xD;
ford this morning," said he. "It was a shock&#xD;
to me-that is, I deeply regretted it-but it&#xD;
was so bravely and unconsciously done-"&#xD;
"Excuse me," interrupted his listener,&#xD;
rather sharply, "I meant what I said-her&#xD;
departure /-Lsee that you are not aware that&#xD;
she has left Rosland."&#xD;
He started, and looked at her keenly.&#xD;
"Do you mean that Miss Desmond has left&#xD;
Rosland?" he said. "Where is she going?"&#xD;
"She left half an hour ago. I think, as&#xD;
well as I understoodthat she is going~o&#xD;
Ireland. Of course it is very natural that she&#xD;
cannot stay here after the expos which has-&#xD;
Good Gracious, Captain Tyndale! What is&#xD;
the matter? What are you going to do?"&#xD;
"I am going to Wexford in order to see&#xD;
Miss Desmond before she leaves," he an-&#xD;
swered, turning quickly away. "It is "-&#xD;
glancing at his watch-" only half-past three.&#xD;
The Alton train is not due, I think I was told,&#xD;
until four. That gives me time enough to&#xD;
reach there."&#xD;
"You are really very devoted," said Mrs.&#xD;
Sandford, sarcastically. "But you must par.&#xD;
don me if I say that I doubt whether Miss&#xD;
Desmond will be very glad to see you. At&#xD;
least, I asked her expressly if she would not&#xD;
leav~ a word or a message for you, and she&#xD;
answered as coldly and curtly as possible&#xD;
that she had nothing to say."&#xD;
"I am unlike her, then," said he, quietly,&#xD;
"for I have a great deal to say, and I am&#xD;
sure you will excuse me if I go at once, in&#xD;
order to be able to say it2'&#xD;
&#xD;
MAX'S PJ&#xD;
&#xD;
He then made no farther apology, but&#xD;
went with all haste to the stable where, much&#xD;
to the ostler's astonishment, he ordered out&#xD;
the best saddle-horse. Five minutes later, he&#xD;
was galloping out of the gates of Rosland.&#xD;
Mrs. Sandford watched him, with bitter,&#xD;
angry eyes, from the veranda. She knew&#xD;
now that all was over, and the realizatiQn cost&#xD;
her a very sharp pang. It was a pang in which&#xD;
wounded vanity played a greater part than&#xD;
wounded feeling; but it was none the less&#xD;
hard to bear on that account. A lacerated&#xD;
amour-propre is almost as painful as a lacer-&#xD;
ated heart, though it is a very strong point in&#xD;
its favor that it can be cured more readily.&#xD;
She went into the house after the rider dis-&#xD;
appeared from sight, and told her maid to&#xD;
pack her trunk. "This time to-morrow I&#xD;
shall go back to Alton," she said-which was&#xD;
her way of beginning a cure.&#xD;
Mak, the while, galloped, without draw-&#xD;
ing rein, 'into Wexford, and, disregarding the&#xD;
many curious glances cast on him, did not&#xD;
pause until he found himself before the rail-&#xD;
road-station. The train was already there,&#xD;
had been there for some minutes, a lounger&#xD;
told him. It was evident that he would not&#xD;
have time for more than a word with Norab,&#xD;
but even a word was worth much, and his&#xD;
eagerness for it increased with the apparent&#xD;
hopelessness of gaining-it. He sprang off his&#xD;
horse, and, throwing the rein with a quick,&#xD;
"Pray, oblige me!" to the man who had&#xD;
given the information, hurried along the plat-&#xD;
form to the cars. As he came in sight of&#xD;
them, the engine suddenly gave its warning&#xD;
shriek of departure-at the same moment he&#xD;
saw Mr. Middleton shake hands quickly with&#xD;
a veiled lady who sat by one of the open win-&#xD;
dows-the next instant, with a rumble and&#xD;
clang of machinery the long train started into&#xD;
motion and sped swiftly out of sight.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
"Fair, and kind, and gentle one!&#xD;
Do not morn and stars and flowers,&#xD;
Pay that homage to their sun,&#xD;
That we pay to ours?&#xD;
"Sun of mine, that art so dear-&#xD;
Sun that art above all sorrow I&#xD;
ShIne, I pray thee, on me here&#xD;
Till the eternal morrow!'~&#xD;
Ox the deck of the Cunard steamer, out-&#xD;
ward bound from New York on the Saturday&#xD;
&#xD;
PROPOSAL.                            219&#xD;
following Miss Desmoud's departure from&#xD;
Rosland, there was all the hurry, bustle, and&#xD;
confusion, the shaking hands of friends, the&#xD;
kisses of relations, th&amp;amp;tears and laughter, the&#xD;
good wishes, the waving handkerchiefs, the&#xD;
brass-bound trunks and general bouleversement&#xD;
common to such occasions. In the midst of&#xD;
it, a young lady who had come unattended on&#xD;
board, walked across the deck, and, taking her&#xD;
position on the side which overlooked the&#xD;
water, not the wharf, quietly turned~ her back&#xD;
upon all the commotion. There is nothing&#xD;
in the world, perhaps, more forlorn than to&#xD;
be alone in such a scene, to have no fare-&#xD;
wells to give or receive, no friends to hope&#xD;
that you may have a pleasant voyage, no hand&#xD;
to clasp, no good wishes to exchange. But&#xD;
to such a feeling of isolation, Norah Desmond&#xD;
had long since grown accustomed. If she&#xD;
felt it a little now-if she was drearily con-&#xD;
scious of her loneliness amid all the eager,&#xD;
chattering crowd-no one would ever have&#xD;
thought so, as she stood by the taifrail in all&#xD;
the grace of her self-possessed bearing, with&#xD;
her beautiful, clear-cut face turned seaward,&#xD;
as if she drank in the salt breeze coming so&#xD;
freshly from the wide, liquid plain which lay&#xD;
far oil'. The attention of every one else being&#xD;
turnedtoward the city they were leaving, she&#xD;
was almost alone on this side of the deck;&#xD;
and, as she watched with wistful eyes the&#xD;
distant horizon line, her mind left her present&#xD;
surroundings to go back upon all that had oc-&#xD;
curred-the events which had followed each&#xD;
other so fast-since she landed here so short&#xD;
a time before. How short a time it had been!&#xD;
-and yet how much had happened! Norah&#xD;
could scarcely realize how much. "Yet the&#xD;
end of it all is that I am going back to the&#xD;
old, weary life of vagabondage 1" she thought,&#xD;
with something between a sigh and a sob It&#xD;
was a quick, nervoxis sound in her throat,&#xD;
more significant of emotion than a hundred&#xD;
undisguised sobs could have been.&#xD;
But Bohemia teaches her children a better&#xD;
philosophy than that of mourning over any&#xD;
milk, spilt or otherwise. The old defiant light&#xD;
came back to Norah's eyes in a minute, the&#xD;
old defiant compression to her lips. "It is&#xD;
the life to which I was born," she thought.&#xD;
"What right have I to expect any other?&#xD;
What is the sense of regretting that which is&#xD;
past ?-what is the sense of 4jining about&#xD;
that which is to come? The day is bright,&#xD;
and th~ sea is smooth, and I well, I an~&#xD;

220                A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMiA.&#xD;
&#xD;
young. When one has youth, one has-or&#xD;
ought to have-hope. The great world of&#xD;
the Possible is all before me * a ad yet-and&#xD;
yet-"&#xD;
11cr head drooped a little. Was it a tear&#xD;
that dropped into the briny, discolored water&#xD;
below? Just then Bohemia might have hesi-&#xD;
tated to own her child; and just then a tall&#xD;
man, with long, dark mustache and keen&#xD;
dark eyes, who had been making his way in&#xD;
a very inquisitive manner among the throng-&#xD;
ing crowd on the other side of the deck, hur-&#xD;
ried over to this side and looked around.&#xD;
lie had been the last passenger to come up&#xD;
the ship's side, and as he stood there now,&#xD;
with a wrap hanging carelessly across his&#xD;
arm, there was a jaded look on his face, as if&#xD;
he had traveled long and far. It was only a&#xD;
second that~ he hesitated. The next instant&#xD;
he caught sight of the stately, graceful figure&#xD;
which he knew so well, and a few quick steps&#xD;
took him to Norah's side.&#xD;
"How glad I am to find you!" he said,&#xD;
breathlessly. "I was almost afraid that&#xD;
there might be some mistake! -that you&#xD;
might not be on board!"&#xD;
"Captain Tyndale!" exclaimed Norah.&#xD;
She turned upon him pale, astonished, quiver-&#xD;
ing from head to foot. "How is this? How&#xD;
did you come here?"&#xD;
"By rail most of the way," ho answered,&#xD;
smiling. It was such a pleasure to see her&#xD;
again-to meet her frank eyes, to hear 'her&#xD;
sweet voice-~-that it is likely he would have&#xD;
smiled if he had been going to execution&#xD;
the next minute. "Did you not know that I&#xD;
was going to cross in this steamer?" he&#xD;
*     asked, with an admirable assumption' of non-&#xD;
chalance. "If I had not been just one min-&#xD;
ute too late in reaching Wexford the day you&#xD;
left-thanks to Mrs. Sandford, who detained&#xD;
me to hear that you had refused to icayc me&#xD;
even a message of common farewell-I should&#xD;
have told you so."&#xD;
"You-is it possible you are going to&#xD;
cross?" said Norah, incredulously. "I did&#xD;
not think that you would go abroad again-&#xD;
that is, so soon."&#xD;
"May I ask, why not?"&#xD;
"Because "-she blushed and hesitated-&#xD;
"because you ha~ve inherited your cousja's&#xD;
fortune, have you not?"&#xD;
"I believe people suppose that I have," he&#xD;
answered, carelessly, "but I have not taken&#xD;
time to ascertain whether they are right or&#xD;
&#xD;
wrong. There was something nearer my heart,&#xD;
and of much more importance to me than a&#xD;
hundred inheritances could be," he added,&#xD;
quickly. "Norab-can you not guess what&#xD;
that was?"&#xD;
"You have become very1 familiar since&#xD;
we parted, Captain Tyndale," said Norah,&#xD;
who was herself again by this time. "No, I&#xD;
cannot guess in the least what it was, unless&#xD;
you mean to resign your commission in the&#xD;
French army. But, you should have taken a&#xD;
French steamer, should you not?" This will&#xD;
land you at Liverpool, unless you land en&#xD;
peasant, as I shall do, at Qucenstown."&#xD;
"I should have taken no other steamer&#xD;
than the one on which you sailed," he an-&#xD;
swered. "As for my commission, I have not&#xD;
thought of it any more than of my probable&#xD;
inheritance. You know as well as I do," he&#xD;
said, breaking off suddenly, in a quick, short,&#xD;
passionate voice, "that I have thought only&#xD;
of ~you I "&#xD;
"Of me!" ejaculated Norab, scarcely&#xD;
knowing what she said, Her heart was beat-&#xD;
ing and thrilling as it had not beat or thrilled&#xD;
on that summer evening at Baden, when Ar-&#xD;
thur Tyndale told l~is love, or on that autumn&#xD;
evening at Coblentz, when he said good-by.&#xD;
What she felt tken had been flattered fancy,&#xD;
girlish romance, any thing but this strange&#xD;
feeling, which seemed to take away all her&#xD;
graceful readiness of speech, and leave her as&#xD;
silent and abashed as any convent-bred girl;&#xD;
"Yes, of you," said Max, growing bolder,&#xD;
as he saw the white lids sink over her eyes,&#xD;
and the clear carmine come into her cheeks&#xD;
as he had fancied one day at Rosland that he&#xD;
should like to make it come. "Did I not tell&#xD;
you when we parted in Wexford, after you&#xD;
had borne so much for mc, that I should see&#xD;
you very soon again-and did you think that&#xD;
I would let such trifles as time and space&#xD;
stand between you and the expression of my&#xD;
gratitude?'~&#xD;
"Spare me the expression of your grati-&#xD;
tude, Captain Tyndale," said she, almost im-&#xD;
patiently. "I have no claim on it-no desire&#xD;
for it. I did a very plain and simple act of&#xD;
duty-nothing more! If there is any grati-&#xD;
tude necessary in the matter, it is Iwho owe&#xD;
it to you. It was you who were willing to en-&#xD;
dure more than I like to remember for me!"&#xD;
"And did you not think-did no instinct&#xD;
tell you-what a happiness it was to me to&#xD;
endure any thing for you?" said he. "Did&#xD;
&#xD;
220&#xD;
&#xD;
A SATISFACTION&#xD;
&#xD;
you not guess tkat much at least of the&#xD;
truth?"&#xD;
"No," said she-and her voice trembled.&#xD;
*" How could I guess it? How could I think&#xD;
that I was any thing to you but a girl whom&#xD;
your cousin had narrowly escaped making a&#xD;
fool of himself by marrying?"&#xD;
"If you were even that to me," said he,&#xD;
"it was so long ago, that it seems swept into&#xD;
the dimness of memory. What you have been&#xD;
to me of late, I scarcely know how to tel! you&#xD;
without making you think that I have gone&#xD;
wild with the extravagance of passion."&#xD;
"I can scarcely fancy that," said she,&#xD;
turning her face seaward again. The steamer&#xD;
was out of the docks by this time, and a fresh&#xD;
breeze met them-a breeze to make the heart&#xD;
leap up with the spirit of its gladness. It&#xD;
deepened the flush on Norah's cheek, and&#xD;
waved back the short fringe of her chestnut&#xD;
hair, showing the fair, candid brow which it&#xD;
has been the policy of fashion to conceal as&#xD;
much as possible for some time past. She&#xD;
looked more like a beautiful princess than&#xD;
ever, Max thought, and the doubts and fears&#xD;
which had borne him company on all the long&#xD;
journey from Alton, came back upon him now&#xD;
with sudden force. After all, would his heart&#xD;
prove any thing more than a new plaything&#xD;
to this fair Bohemian, this woman who had&#xD;
jarred upon and disgusted him, and yet whom&#xD;
he could no more help loving than the earth&#xD;
could refuse to put forth bud and leaf and&#xD;
flower at the bidding of the sun? He could&#xD;
not tell-it was likely enough; and yet, for&#xD;
good or ill, his heart was hers. He knew&#xD;
that now. Standing beside her, trying vainly&#xD;
to read the riddle of her averted face, he felt&#xD;
that he would freely sign away every other&#xD;
good gift of life, if only he might claim and&#xD;
~possess this one for his own. At last, out of&#xD;
very impatience, he broke the silence which&#xD;
had lasted between them for some time.&#xD;
"We are off!" he said. "We are on the&#xD;
sea together, you and I! Norab, you have&#xD;
not told me yet-are you glad or sorry that I&#xD;
came?"&#xD;
"Is it necessary for me to be either?"&#xD;
asked she, with a slight cadence of laughter&#xD;
in her tone. After all, a man is deaf as well&#xD;
as blind when he is in love, or Max would&#xD;
have known every thing from that tone.&#xD;
"You must be one or the other," said he.&#xD;
"I am your only acquaintance on board, am&#xD;
I not? In that case you will have to see so&#xD;
&#xD;
~RY ANSWER.                         221&#xD;
much of me that you mu8t be either glad or&#xD;
sorry that I came."&#xD;
"In that case, I suppose I am not sorry,"&#xD;
said she, sihiling. "It is rather dull being&#xD;
quite alone, though I ought to be used to it&#xD;
by this time, and then I always manage to&#xD;
make acquaintance, or, to put it more cor-&#xD;
rectly, people manage to make my acquaint.&#xD;
ance."&#xD;
"I hope you will not let any of these&#xD;
people make your acquaintance, for I am&#xD;
selfish enough to want your society all to my-&#xD;
self until we reach Qucenstown."&#xD;
"But can you not imagine that I might&#xD;
like a little variety?" asked she, laughing&#xD;
again. "I might not want your society all&#xD;
the time until we reach Queensthwn 1"&#xD;
"That is very true. I should have thought&#xD;
of that, perhaps. Will you promise, then, to&#xD;
take as mueh of me as you want, and to dis.&#xD;
miss me without ceremony when you do not&#xD;
want me?"&#xD;
"I am not sure that I should not dismiss&#xD;
you at once," said she, turning her bright,&#xD;
fearless eyes upon him. "I have had more&#xD;
than enough of 'blarney' in my life-you&#xD;
can imagine that, perhaps and my head&#xD;
ou~ht to be steady enough to stand any&#xD;
amount of it by this time; bu't I am really&#xD;
afraid of the effect of your blarney for nine&#xD;
days at sea. Now, that is a compliment for&#xD;
you," she ended, with a smile that was rather&#xD;
forced.&#xD;
"I shall go back with the pilot if you say&#xD;
so," he answered, quietly-but his face grew&#xD;
paler as he spoke. "You know why I have&#xD;
come," he went on, after a short pause. "I&#xD;
only waited at Strafford, as I was in duty&#xD;
bound to do, until poor Arthur's funeral was&#xD;
over. Then I followed you, without pause or&#xD;
arest, as fast as steam could bring me, in order&#xD;
to say, face to face, that I love you: in order&#xD;
to ask you to be my wife. Norah "-with a&#xD;
passionate cadence in his voice-" you cannot&#xD;
imagine half how well I love you! Norah,&#xD;
will you not be my wife?"&#xD;
Only the simple words as they rose out of&#xD;
his heart to his lips. No eloquence-no at-&#xD;
tempt at eloquence. Indeed, men rarely use&#xD;
fine phrases when they are in such deep&#xD;
earnest as Max Tyndale was then; and he on&#xD;
his part felt the suspense too sharply not to&#xD;
desire to end it at once. But it was not ended&#xD;
as far as any word from Norah Desmond was&#xD;
concerned. She turned her face from him&#xD;
&#xD;

A DAUGHTER OF BOHEMIAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
quickly-almost abruptly-and gazed seaward&#xD;
again. Yet, as she gazed, a mist came over&#xD;
her sight, obscuring all the green beauty of&#xD;
the waves, 'and her heart seemed beating in&#xD;
her throats It was not altogether her fault&#xD;
that she was silent; she tried to speak, and&#xD;
failed to utter a word. So, after a minute~&#xD;
Max went on:&#xD;
"Norab, is there no hope for me? I sup.&#xD;
pose I am mad to come to you like this-mad&#xD;
to think that you, who have known so many&#xD;
men, could learn to love me-but I could not&#xD;
bear to leave any chance untried. I could&#xD;
not bear to burden my life with the haunting&#xD;
regret of thinking that I might, perhaps, have&#xD;
won you if I had only spoken in time. I&#xD;
thought it better to risk every thing on a&#xD;
single stake, and rise up-winner or loser for&#xD;
life. Norah-which is it to be?"&#xD;
"How can you speak to me like this?"&#xD;
said she, turning upon him passionately.&#xD;
"You know youdo not love me-or, if you&#xD;
do, it is merely after a fashion, for my pretty&#xD;
face! You do not care for me as-as you care&#xD;
for Leslie! You are enough of a gentleman&#xD;
to have showed me more respect than any one&#xD;
ever did before-for which, to my dying day, I&#xD;
shall never, never forget you! But, in your&#xD;
heart you hold me in the colors Arthur Tyn-&#xD;
dale painted me. You think me fast-Bohe.&#xD;
rnian, bizarre-"&#xD;
She paused abruptly, or, to speak more&#xD;
correctly, he interrupted her by taking into&#xD;
his possession the hand lying on the.taffrail.&#xD;
"Do not wrong yourself and me by such&#xD;
words aa these!" he said. "I think of you as&#xD;
&#xD;
I think of the sun which is giving life to the&#xD;
world. You are m~i sun-the only one thing&#xD;
which can give light and fragrance to my life.&#xD;
Not care for you as I care for Leslie Gra-&#xD;
hame! My darling, are you blind? Leslie&#xD;
Grahame is nothing to me, and you are every&#xD;
thing-every thing, Norah! What I may&#xD;
once have though of you-in what colors&#xD;
poor Arthur may once have painted you-&#xD;
has passed from me as absolutely as if it&#xD;
had never been. I can neither ask nor de-&#xD;
sire any change in you as I know you and&#xD;
love you now!"&#xD;
She looked up at him with tears, which&#xD;
she did not try to conceal, shining in her&#xD;
eyes. A new beauty-a beauty full of the&#xD;
most exquisite softness-came over her face.&#xD;
It was the happy content of the child mm.&#xD;
gled with the tender joy of the woman.&#xD;
"Are you in earnest?" she said. "Do&#xD;
you really think all this of me? It isvery&#xD;
gqod of you, but you are wrong-quite wrong.&#xD;
I am full of faults which will shock you and&#xD;
jar upon you. Think what my life has been!&#xD;
You cannot tell-you cannot even guess-&#xD;
half that I have gone through!"&#xD;
"You shall never go through any more-&#xD;
never so long as God gives me power to shield&#xD;
you!" he said. Then he covered her hand&#xD;
eagerly in both his own. "You have not&#xD;
told me yet whether I must go back with the&#xD;
pilot or not," he said. "Norah, my darling,&#xD;
must I go or stay?"&#xD;
And Norali's eyes as well as Norab's lips&#xD;
answered-&#xD;
"Stay!"&#xD;

Rhoda Broughton.&#xD;
9&#xD;
"We believe that with one exception this authoress may be classed as the most popular writer of&#xD;
fiction of her sex. The reasons are manifold: in her stories the plot is ever simple, but yet of in-&#xD;
tense interest; her ideal characters are sketched with consummate skill; they are never crowded on the&#xD;
mimic scene, yet thus afford contrasts thi~t yividly attract the reader's imagination~; added to this, a&#xD;
bright, witty dialogue, a charming descriptive power, and a great depth of pat os, and we have&#xD;
summed up the attributes that distinguish Rhoda Broughton."-N. Y. Albion.&#xD;
