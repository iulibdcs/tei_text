               <p>IT was far into the night when they reached Deep Dell, and put up at the large log tavern that fulfilled the manifold duties of country store, post-office, smithy, meeting-house, court-house, and hotel, and was consequently a place of great bustle, if not business. Here our emigrant pair, by special favour, were accommodated with the landlady's own parlour, and promised a private supper. The tavern was full of people, for this was mail day, and the post-boy from Huttontown was expected every moment.</p>
               <p>Magnus went out to put his wagon under cover, and to feed and stable his mules.</p>
               <p>And Elsie sat to employ his absence in writing a few lines to her mother, which she enclosed and directed to Mr. Wilson, the young Methodist minister.</p>
               <p>She had scarcely concluded when supper, consisting of fine coffee and rich cream, buckwheat-cakes, fresh butter, and<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7856-00000005"/> venison steaks, with currant-jelly, was brought in and neatly arranged upon the table.</p>
               <p>Magnus came in, and Elsie, with a blush and a smile, took her seat at the head of the board. This was the first time she had "done the honours of the table," and her half-womanly, half-childly heart was pleased at the novelty of her position.</p>
               <p>As for Magnus, he was as gravely comfortable as if he had been used to his vis-a-vis all his life.</p>
               <p>Very early the next morning the mules were fed and watered and put to the wagon, and a substantial breakfast prepared for our travellers.</p>
               <p>But when Magnus went to the bar to pay his bill, the barkeeper, with the slow nonchalance of a country postmaster, handed him a letter, which he said had been brought by the Huttontown post-boy late the night previous. Magnus took the letter. It was superscribed in the handwriting of Mr Wilson. He turned it to break it open, and found, to his dismay, that the seal was BLACK. He tore it open. It was short, even abrupt in its annunciation.</p>

                           <p>I keep the post-boy waiting while I write to announce the painful intelligence of the death of Mrs. Garnet. She expired suddenly about two o'clock this morning—three hours before you left Huttontown, although we did not receive the sad news of her decease until seven o'clock. The funeral is fixed for to-morrow afternoon at four. Return immediately, if you would be present to pay the last respects to the memory of the sainted dead. May Heaven grant that this season of awful and mutual bereavement may be sanctified to the hearts and souls of the father and daughter, of the father-in-law and the son-in-law, and that you may be all reconciled—each to the other, and all to God—is the prayer of</p>

               <p>"Why, <emph>why</emph> was not this letter given me last night?" exclaimed Doctor Hardcastle, in strong excitement.</p>
               <p>"Because, sir, the mail did not get in until an hour after you had gone to bed."</p>
               <p>"Have you any description of carriage here, lighter than my wagon? We must set off instantly, on our return to Huttontown."</p>
               <p>"I hope there's no bad news, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—my wife's mother died yesterday."</p>
               <p>"Good Heaven, sir; was the poor lady sick when you left?"</p>
               <p>"No, no—it was unexpected—quite suddenly; we left her in perfect health. <emph>Is</emph> there any vehicle I can procure?"</p>
               <p>"Why, sir—dear me, this is very shocking; I am very sorry to hear it. Yes, there's Mrs. Barber—her old carry-all."</p>
               <p>"Have my mules put to it on the instant," said Magnus; and pale with trouble, he went into the little breakfast parlour where Elsie sat at the head of the breakfast table awaiting. His grave demeanour, his troubled face, and the open letter with the broken black seal, alarmed her. Starting up in haste, she rushed to his side. He threw his arms around her, and placed the letter in her hand.</p>
               <p>Elsie read the first lines. She was too strong, and full of blood, to faint, but the strength and sanguinity that kept her from falling under the sudden, tremendous blow, gave greater energy and passion to her grief. Breaking from her husband's arms, with a wild shriek, she gave herself up to passionate lamentations and bitter self-reproaches:</p>
               <p>"I should not have left her—I should not have left her! Oh, I see now, it was thoughtless—it was selfish—it was <emph>cruel</emph> to leave her! If I could scarcely bear my father's tyranny, how could she? How could she—so delicate, so sensitive! Died suddenly!—oh, yes, done to death—done to death! And to keep it secret for four or five hours—oh!"</p>
               <p>"Elsie—dear, darling Elsie—hush! do not say bitter and sinful things, which you will repent."</p>
               <p>"Oh, don't put your arms around me, Magnus! It would be heinous for me to be loved, or comforted by your sympathy, now. I who left my gentle, fragile mother alone, to be done to death for me; my dove-like mother, in the claws of the vulture. I, who was so much stronger, and who, having your protection also, should have remained to protect her. <emph>I</emph> to leave her, defenceless, and in peril for my sake, and to come flaunting off, so happy and thoughtless, like a very wanton. Oh, Magnus, I could go to a nunnery, Magnus—I could go to a nunnery, Magnus. A hundred serpents are gnawing at my<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7856-00000006"/> heart! Oh, Magnus, I can never be happy—never make you happy in this world again. Oh, Magnus, I am sorry—<emph>so sorry for you, too!</emph> You did not deserve a sorrow-stricken, remorseful wife. Oh, mother, dear, gentle mother, what harm did your innocent life do to any one, that it should have been trampled out?"</p>
               <p>And then she burst into tears—such copious tears, such floods of tears, as only one of her strong and sanguine temperament could have shed.</p>
               <p>Tears and lamentations are the natural vent of a healthful sorrow. It is only the sorrow unto death that is mute and dry.</p>
               <p>And while she was drowned in tears, and wringing her hands, and wailing, and talking, Magnus walked up and down the floor, waiting as patiently as he would have waited for a storm of thunder, lightning, and rain to subside, except when some unfilial expression of bitter indignation against her father would escape her lips, when he would go up to her, and gently risk to stop her:</p>
               <p>"Dear Elsie, you must not speak so. Nothing that your father can do or say to me, or to others, can affect <emph>your</emph> duty towards him. Elsie, you must speak of your father with respect, or not speak of him at all. That is what your sainted mother would have advised, and, gentle as she was, <emph>enforced.</emph> There was nothing more admirable in Alice Garnet's blameless character and conduct than the delicate reserve with which she concealed her own sufferings, and the gentle dignity with which she constrained the respect of all her friends for General Garnet. I often compared her to the dove, folding her wing over her mortal wound, to hide it from all eyes."</p>
               <p>"Blessed mother!—oh, angel mother!" said Elsie, bursting into fresh floods.</p>
               <p>"<emph>She</emph> respected the husband in General Garnet—will <emph>you</emph> not respect the father?" at last said Magnus.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes—yes, I will, indeed! I will never say another word about him. If I do, stop me—don't let me, please, Magnus. I don't wish to do wrong; but, oh, Magnus, is it not enough to try one's faith—to kill one's faith—when one so good as my mother is permitted to suffer and to die?" exclaimed claimed Elsie, giving way to another extravagant burst of sorrow.</p>
               <p>Magnus knelt by her side, and took her hands, and stroked her hair, and wiped her tears, until the fresh gush of grief had spent itself, and then he said,</p>
               <p>"Dear Elsie, it is the great strengthener and supporter of faith—the sufferings and premature death of the good. It makes immortality, Heaven, certain, because necessary; and necessary, because just. Dear Elsie, what is the life and death of Christ intended to teach? What is the resurrection and ascension intended to insure?"</p>
               <p>"I know—oh, I know she is an angel in Heaven; but Heaven itself needs 'familiarizing' to our feelings, before it can console us for the lost—much."</p>
               <p>At this moment the bar-keeper came in, and said that the carryall was ready. Doctor Hardcastle re-arranged the cloak around his almost helpless companion, tied her hood, and leading her out, fixed her in the back seat of the carryall.</p>
               <p>The journey back was commenced—oh, under what different auspices, and with what different feelings to those which blessed the drive of yesterday!</p>
               <p>Elsie sat in the back of the carryall, with her head bowed upon her hands, pale and silent, with that heavy, dull, deadening soul-ache, that marks an abiding sorrow; or else breaking out into passionate bewailings, as some sharp, sudden realization of her bereavement pierced her heart.</p>
               <p>So was the first part of the journey performed. But Elsie was too right-minded to give way to hopeless sorrow long after the first shock was over. Before they had got half way to Huttontown, her fine temperament had reacted healthfully, and came up to the aid of the moral strength that would have controlled these extravagant manifestations of grief. Her tears and lamentations were silenced. Her muffled and sullen despair was conquered, and she lifted up a pale, but tearless face, and entered into conversation with her husband. And though her sorrow was as deep—yes, deeper than before, because it had subsided from expression into her silent heart—she did not again either rave, or sink under it, during that mournful drive home.</p>
               <p>She explained to her husband how it was, that in the very last of the parting scene with her poor mother, her suspicions<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7856-00000007"/> of her father's tyranny and her mother's silent sufferings had been first aroused; that she had banished the idea as one too unfilial, too heinous to be entertained for an instant; that it had recurred again, to be driven away again; and so until the minister's note, the sudden death, the four or five hours' concealment, had confirmed her worst misgivings.</p>
               <p>"Dearest Elsie, I know every pang these severe trials have given you. I know the terrible struggle between old respect, affection, and confidence, and the new set of feelings these revelations tend to arouse. But, dearest Elsie, your duties to your father remain precisely the same—I repeat—you must <emph>speak</emph> of him without disrespect, or resentment, or you must never speak of him at all. You must <emph>think</emph> of him without disrespect, or resentment, or you must never think of him at all, except to pray for him."</p>
               <p>"But my mother! <emph>Oh,</emph> my mother! can I forget her wrongs and sufferings?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Elsie, yes; forget her sufferings, if you cannot remember them without remembering your father's wrong doings. Yes, forget them. Your mother, your sainted mother herself, would entreat you to forget."</p>
               <p>"Because she <emph>was</emph> a saint; because she <emph>is</emph> an angel. But I am only a sinful human being, with Garnet blood in me besides. Oh, mother! oh, mother!" she cried, about to break out again into loud lamentations, but checking the impulse by a great moral effort.</p>
               <p>She silently covered her face with her hands, and her bosom heaved convulsively for a while, and then grew still; and presently she took the hand of her husband, and resting her head upon his breast, looked up into his face, saying, slowly,</p>
               <p>"Oh, Magnus! I honour you very much, indeed, from my soul I do! Oh, Magnus! I value you more and more every day. Sorrowful as I am, I am very blessed in being your wife, Magnus. You are <emph>always</emph> good and great; and I, though I have my moments of high and fervid moral and religious elevation and enthusiasm, in which I think I could accomplish great things for earth and heaven; yet they pass away—barren! barren!—except in words and protestations; while my sinful fits of passion are not so fruitless of evil as the better moods were of good. Oh, Magnus! my strength, my light, my patient, faithful mentor! take strong side with my good, against my evil; be patient with my faults, and faithful to rebuke them; and, sorrow-stricken as I am, I will love you to adoration."</p>
               <p>"Your better moods are not so barren, dear Elsie. Wait; the opportunity has not been presented—in due time the harvest will come."</p>
               <p>But the countenance of Magnus began to show anxiety; and he urged his animals to their greatest speed. He took his watch out from time to time, and anxiously examined it. The prospect of their reaching Huttontown in time for the funeral, was each moment more remote. It was two o'clock, and they were not half way. The obscurity of the cloudy day, and the sameness of the long, long forest road, and her own absorption in one subject, had deceived Elsie in regard to time and distance, and he did not wish to affect her with his own anxiety. Still he urged his mules to their utmost speed over the dreadful road. Three o'clock came, and they had still fifteen miles to go. The mules went in a fast trot. Four o'clock came, and ten miles lay before them. Five o'clock came; it was nearly dark, and they were still several miles from town. At length, at a little before six, when it was quite dark and piercing cold, they entered Huttontown.</p>
               <p>Elsie had long in silence given up the hope of getting even to the church in time for the funeral service there; and now she whispered, in a low, solemn, sorrow-fraught tone,</p>
               <p>"Drive to the church—to the house of the sexton. We must see her again, if only in the vault."</p>
               <p>"It will be too much for you, oh, my Elsie!"</p>
               <p>"No, no; I <emph>entreat,</emph> I implore you, take me to the vault."</p>
               <p>St. John's Church, or the New Church, as it was more commonly called, from its very recent erection upon the site of the old one, lay about a quarter of a mile out of the village of Huttontown, on the up-country road. It was pitch dark, and biting cold, as they drove slowly and sadly through the village. The darkness protected them from the eyes of the stragglers, whom the cold had not been able to banish from street corners and grocery doors. As they drove slowly, sadly, and silently past these groups, their ears were pained by the one general subject of gossipping conversation—the sudden decease of the lady of Mount Calm, and the harshness and severity of her husband as the indirect cause of her death. And high<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7856-00000008"/> was the love and honour manifested for the sainted victim, and deep was the regret expressed for her untimely death, and great was the indignation and hatred declared against the living tyrant.</p>
               <p>Elsie shuddered, and cowered nearer her husband. He encircled her with his arm, and drove faster through the street. She whispered, falteringly,</p>
               <p>"You hear, Magnus. Oh, Magnus, you <emph>hear!</emph> There is but <emph>one</emph> voice—all agree in <emph>one thing.</emph> But oh, Magnus, I will heed your lesson; and when all men condemn him, Magnus, I will pray for him. But, oh, Magnus, how could the secrets of that house have escaped?"</p>
               <p>"By the gossip of the servants; if not by that, by instinct, intuition. The truth is often better known, or guessed, than we think."</p>
               <p>They drove rapidly through the village, and turned off into the up-country road, and entered the thick forest.</p>

               <p>A SILENT drive of about half-an-hour's length brought them to the deep and sheltered forest dell in which St. John's Church stood. A side wall separated the church-yard from the road. A ruder gate gave admittance to such vehicles as entered there. A stile farther up the way accommodated foot passengers. Instead of driving through the gate into the church-yard, a feeling of profound reverence, induced by the awful solemnity of their purpose, caused them to pause at the main entrance, alight from their carriage, and pass humbly on foot into the sacred precincts of the dead. It was pitch dark; not a star shone in the heavens; the heavy sky seemed let down, and hung low and black over the earth. Scarcely by the fitful gleam of the snow-clad graves, and white spectral tombstones, could their dreary pathway be discerned. From the midst of the darkness loomed the Gothic building of St. John's Church, its steeple seeming lost in the low clouds. Surrounding the dell was the boundless forest, whose nearer trees stood up, stark, and black, in strong contrast with the snow. Within the circle of these grim trees gleamed a single ray of red light, shooting in a line of crimson across the grave-yard. This came from the window of the old sexton's log-house, that stood just within the shelter of the forest. Taking this ghostly light as their guide, and picking their way cautiously and reverently among the tombs, they approached the lone dwelling. As they drew near, they saw the light fitting backwards and forwards in the house, and then perceived an old negro with a saddled mule at the gate. Before Dr. Hardcastle could<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7856-00000009"/> speak to ask a question, the door of the house was opened, and the old sexton came forth, clad in a shaggy over-coat, fox-cap, and fur gloves, and carrying a lantern in his hand. Seeing two strangers, he made an exclamation of surly surprise, and asked their business. Dr. Hardcastle drew him apart, explained to him who they were, and what they wanted. The old man then changed his tone, invited them into his house, and, lantern in hand, slowly led the way. With plain kindness, he took the hand of Elsie, and led her to a rude armchair in the chimney corner, telling her, that being about to go away for the night, he had put out the fire, but that he would soon kindle it up again to warm her. Then going to an obscure corner of the room, he brought forth a quantity of oily pine knots, and lighting one at the candle in the lantern, and placing it on the hearth and piling others around it, and heaping more upon them, in an instant he had a very hot fire. Then he turned to Dr. Hardcastle, begged him to be seated, and explained that he had just been summoned away to Green Mills to see his brother, who was dangerously ill; that he had therefore to depart on the instant, lest he should not see his brother alive; that if Dr. Hardcastle would dispense with his services, and take the keys of the church and let himself in, he would be very much obliged; farther, that if Dr. Hardcastle should choose not to return to Huttontown in the severe cold, this poor cottage was at his service, with all it contained; only when the Doctor left, would he please to put out the fire, and lock up everything, both at the church and at the cottage, securely, and put the bunch of keys under the stone by the door step. Dr. Hardcastle thanked him, accepted the keys, promised security to all things intrusted to his care, and even hastened to dismiss the old man. When the sexton and the negro had departed, Magnus turned to Elsie, who had sat all this time in the arm-chair by the chimney corner, with her face covered by the flap of her cloak, and whispered,</p>
               <p>"Elsie, my dear, dear girl, pause, think; do not insist upon going into the vault!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes! yes, I entreat you; something in my heart urges me beyond the possibility of keeping back; haste! haste, I implore you. I am sick with impatience while you hesitate. I feel as if something momentous, something tremendous hung upon this instant of time; haste, haste!" she said.</p>
               <p>"My darling, my poor darling, strong as you are, this has been too much for you; you are nervous, excited, flighty; but, come along, I can take care of you."</p>
               <p>Elsie arose and took his arm, and solemnly and silently they passed out of the old sexton's house, and took their mournful way towards the church. Solemnly and silently they entered its portals, and, dimly lighted by the lantern, passed up its shadowy aisles—silently, but for the mournful echo of their footsteps. The door of the vault was situated at the side of the altar. Opening this door with reverential care, and still bearing the lantern, Magnus Hardcastle descended, followed by Elsie, pale with grief and awe, into its shadows. There is a depth of solemnity about the last resting-place of the dead which overwhelms the wildest sorrow with awe, and subdues it into death-like stillness. Magnus and Elsie entered the vault with profound calmness. But here was only the darkness and repose of death. The vault, like the church, was new. Only two mortals—an aged man and an infant—had been placed there to rest, just before Alice Garnet fell asleep, and was laid by their side. As the two mourning pilgrims entered, the light of the lantern partially revealed the new, gray stone walls, the white ground floor, and the three coffins. That of Alice was, of course, easily recognised. Reverently, mournfully, they approached and knelt by its side. With reverent hands Magnus raised the top of the outer case.</p>
               <p>A glass-plate set in the lid of the coffin, gave the features of the quiet face once more to the view of the mourning son and daughter. There was the face, even as Elsie had seen it often in its natural sleep; only more serene than in slumber, for in her life the very sleep of Alice had seemed troubled or too death-like. Was this repose death-like? Was this DEATH? Beautiful, strangely beautiful, was that heavenly face, in its deep repose, in its <emph>rapt</emph> repose, for there was a look of ecstasy in the countenance, in the elastic fullness of the muscles, in the faint colour on the rounded cheeks, and the full and pouting lips. Was this death? Some one's reverence for the beautiful had left the amber ringlets straying from the close border of the cap, and now so life-like looked the lovely face, that these ringlets seemed to tremble as with a trembling breath. Was this DEATH? Was the suddenness with which life had left the clay, the cause of this life-like look? There<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7856-00000010"/> are moments when the most rational have wild hopes, moments when the most habitually self-collected, doubt the evidence of their own senses; it was thus in amaze that they gazed upon her countenance, seemingly instinct with life; with the freshness, and fullness, and bloom of life; the colour seemed brightening upon her cheeks and lips with life; the eyelashes and the amber ringlets seemed quivering with life; and even as they gazed with amaze, the view was obscured by a mist on the glass, and the beautiful countenance veiled from their eyes. Elsie spoke with a voice full of tears:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Magnus! dear Magnus! wipe off the glass. Our breath, as we looked too close, has dulled it. I cannot see her angel face any longer for the mist upon the glass."</p>
               <p>Magnus drew out his silk pocket-handkerchief and wiped the glass carefully.</p>
               <p>"I cannot see her yet, Magnus. I cannot see her yet. Oh, I want to see her again, that that divine countenance may be indelibly fixed in my memory—oh-h-h!"</p>
               <p>Magnus wiped the glass again very carefully, looked, wiped it a third time most carefully, and taking up the lantern, threw its whole light upon the plate, rubbing it assiduously as he did so. Why did Doctor Hardcastle start— <q>
                     <l>"As if the Archangel's trump he heard?"</l>
                  </q> THE NEW MIST UPON THE GLASS WAS FROM WITHIN THE COFFIN. To snatch a hunting-knife from his belt, to wrench open the coffin-lid with one wrench of his strong hand and throw it off, to give her fresh air; to snatch her from the coffin to the warmth and shelter of his living arms and bosom; to turn to the thunder-stricken Elsie, and exclaim,</p>
               <p>"ELSIE, DON'T FAINT! Be strong, I command you! Your mother LIVES! SHE LIVES! She has been placed here in apparent death only; she must not recover to find herself in this dreadful place; to see these grave-clothes; to know what horrors have befallen her, lest reason be shocked for ever from its seat. Give me your cloak, Elsie! Quick! quick! My God, don't faint, I adjure you; I'll never forgive you, if you faint now. Your cloak, I say; your cloak, quick! to throw around this shroud, which she must not see."</p>
               <p>Elsie, with pallid lips and dilated eyes—too amazed, and doubtful of her own senses and sanity, to receive the joyful truth—with mechanical promptitude, threw off her cloak and handed it to Magnus.</p>
               <p>"<emph>That's</emph> my brave girl; that's my pioneer wife!" he said, receiving the cloak, and folding it hastily yet carefully around the form he held in his arms, and pressing it closer to his bosom. "There, Elsie! Now my little heroine, shade the lantern; quick, Elsie, lest she open her eyes and see the place we bear her from. Quick, Elsie! she is moving restlessly in my arms now, and her form is getting warm, thank Heaven; as warm almost as yours, my Elsie. There, now follow me close behind, Elsie, my little soldier, and you may let the lantern shine as soon as we get out of the church."</p>
               <p>And so folding the form of Alice closer in his sustaining arms, closer to his sheltering bosom, and followed by Elsie, bearing the darkened lantern, he hurried up the stairs of the vault, down the aisle of the church, out of the great door, and across the grave-yard towards the cottage of the sexton, never pausing in his speed until he reached the door of the cabin, which, without stopping to unlatch, he pushed open with a blow of his foot.</p>
               <p>He bore her in, followed by Elsie with the lantern. The fire they had left there was still burning brightly, warming and lighting the whole room. In the upper end of the apartment stood a poor but neat and cleanly bed.</p>
               <p>Towards this he hastened with the form of Alice. He turned down the cover, and hastily divesting her of the heavy cloak, laid her in the bed, and covered her warmly up. He stooped and looked at her with intense interest, then took her arm and felt her pulse. It was moderately full and quick. He gazed upon her face, the colour was still brightening in her cheeks and lips; her eyelids were quivering as if about to fly open; her full fresh lips were slightly apart, as if about to speak; she was moving gently, breathing softly, murmuring melodiously. He bent his ear to catch that low musical murmur: low and musical as the faintest breath of the eolian harp. The words of that strange melody were: "Oh, angels, let me go! I—only I of all the earth love him well enough to be the instrument of Christ for his redemption—I—only I of all the earth have faith in its possibility."</p>
               <p>"Wandering, flighty, delirious," said Dr. Magnus, quietly dropping the wrist he had held, and rising and going towards<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7856-00000011"/> Elsie. "Elsie, I dare not leave your mother for an instant now. Pick up your cloak, wrap yourself well in it, take the lantern and haste to the gate, where we left the carriage; take my medicine chest from the box, and bring it hither; haste, Elsie, haste! every second counts a year of life."</p>
               <p>Mechanically as an automaton, Elsie had obeyed his every direction. She looked unnatural with her pale face and great dilated eyes. And she performed her part with the abstracted air and literal and mathematical precision of a sleep-walker. With this strange, absent air she went out, and after an absense of about fifteen minutes, returned with the medicine chest.</p>
               <p>Magnus heard her coming, and left his patient for an instant to open the door and relieve her of her burden. But here another subject unexpectedly arrested his attention and claimed his care. As she gave the chest into his hands, she stared straight at him—straight through him and past him with such unconscious eyes, that he grew alarmed for her. Setting down the medicine chest upon a bench, he took her hands and drew her up to the fire, and laying his hand upon her shoulder, and looking straight in her eyes, he said, cheerfully,</p>
               <p>"Wake up, Elsie! Rouse yourself, my child! This is very awful, but not unnatural."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Oh-h-h!</emph>" sighed Elsie, dropping into the arm-chair. "<emph>Oh-h-h!</emph> I know it is not unnatural, or uncommon either, for loved ones to die, and hearts to be bereaved and broken; but, dear Magnus, I am afraid I am going crazy; I am afraid to tell you what I wildly imagined just now: what an extravagant fancy I took into my head."</p>
               <p>"What was it, then?"</p>
               <p>"Now, don't be too much astounded at my folly, dear Magnus, for I have been so grievously tried."</p>
               <p>"What was it, then? quick! I have no time for idle talk."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, I fancied—<emph>Oh-h-h! such</emph> a mad, frenzied fancy—that my beloved mother was alive again. Am I not going mad? I thought my dear mother was alive again!"</p>
               <p>"And you KNOW she is!" he exclaimed, dropping his hand upon her shoulder, with hearty, kindly roughness,—"you KNOW she is! Rouse yourself, this moment, Elsie, I command you; collect your thoughts; remember where you are, and what has occurred. What sort of behaviour is this? Have I been premature and too partial in ascribing to you strength of mind; courage, coolness, promptitude in emergency? Can I depend upon <emph>you</emph> in extremity? Come out of this amazement, this instant, Elsie! Wake up, and make yourself useful; weakness is meanness. Be strong; strength is grandeur. Be heroic; strength is heroism. Make me proud to call you wife. Stand up, now; give me both your hands. Look me straight in the eyes, and let me see if I cannot infuse some sanity and strength into that amazed and fainting soul of yours."</p>
               <p>Elsie placed the back of her hands against her brow, while she slowly arose to her feet, and then slowly throwing off her hands, as if to dispel an illusion, she said,</p>
               <p>"There; the cloud has passed, Magnus; the weakness has left me; I will be worthy of you. What is it that I can do, Magnus?"</p>
               <p>"There; I knew you were not a poltroon: only a fatigued hero, Elsie. Come, one kiss, and then to work."</p>
               <p>And he caught her to his bosom with an ardent clasp and fervent kiss, that inspired from his own rich and strong vitality all the life, and warmth, and energy, and activity, that her weaker nature needed at this trying moment. Then he led her to the bedside of her mother, whispering as he did so,</p>
               <p>"Now, my own heroic wife, no relapse into weakness."</p>
               <p>"No, no, indeed, my strength; I will be worthy of you. Oh, Magnus, I think you have life enough to raise me from the dead, if I were to die. Oh, Magnus, I begin to realize now that SHE LIVES, and that I am blessed: blessed to the fullness of content," said Elsie, sinking upon her knees, and raising her clasped hands and streaming eyes to Heaven.</p>
               <p>"Calmly, calmly, my Elsie," said Magnus, laying his hand gently on her head. "There, rise, now, and sit beside your mother, and watch her, and listen for her words, that we may know the nature of her illusion, and not rudely shock it. She seems in a happy trance, now—and her pulse is good, yet her state is so critical, that her waking must be watched for."</p>
               <p>"Hush-h-h! her lips move! she speaks!" said Elsie, bending over her. "Oh, mother! mother! darling mother! Warm<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7856-00000012"/> and living, and restored to me! What shall I render Heaven in exchange for thee? Hush-h-h! she is saying something! Oh, Magnus, that look of quiet ecstasy has left her countenance, and the troubled earthly look she used to wear has come again! What is the reason of it?—oh, what is the reason of it? Oh, see how her brow contracts! how her lips quiver! Oh, see her hands fly together, and clasp like vices! Oh, Magnus! Magnus! DO SOMETHING! She is going into a spasm."</p>
               <p>"No, no, child, she is not—NATURAL life is coming again. Her mind is taking up the train of thoughts at the place where it was lost. Nothing can be done as yet, but to listen—yes, listen—she speaks again—hear!"</p>
               <p>"Forgive Elsie—only forgive Elsie, and I will forget that I have been betrayed, and scorned, and trampled under foot. At least I will never, never speak of it," murmured Alice, in a heart-broken tone; and then her hands flew up, her eyes flew open, and she looked around in the full possession of all her faculties, which was evident from the surprise with which she glanced upon the strange scene.</p>
               <p>Magnus and Elsie had drawn back, not to shock her with their sudden appearance.</p>
               <p>Yes, catalepsy, epilepsy, apparent death—whatever the medical faculty in their wisdom might have pronounced the fit to be that had held her life spell-bound for two days—was over, quite over, and she raised up in the full possession of all her senses.</p>
               <p>"Where in the universe am I?" she asked, rising upon her elbow, and looking around. "Has he turned me out of doors, really, and has one of the negroes taken me into a quarter during a fainting fit? Let me recollect. What happened after he threw me down? I remember nothing after that. 'Now <emph>die</emph> of RAGE,' he said, and spurned me from him. Yes, that is the last link in memory's chain. I must have fainted after that; he must have thrust me out, and one of the poor negro women must have picked me up, and brought me to her quarters, and here I have recovered. Oh, I wonder how long I have lain in this swoon—not long. It was <emph>near</emph> daylight when I lost recollection. It is not <emph>quite</emph> daylight yet. Oh, I have not lain here long, perhaps not ten minutes. I wish some one would come. I want to warn them not to speak of this. It must not be talked of on the plantation. It must not get out among the neighbours. And never, <emph>never</emph> must Elsie hear of it—guess at it. God! God! save Elsie from this knowledge! Let her still respect her father. Let her still be happy in thinking of me in my home—<emph>'home'—my home.</emph> Alas! it is not <emph>my</emph> home any longer! I do not own an interest there—not even a wife's interest in the homestead which I should have had, even had the estate come by General Garnet, for I have signed even <emph>that</emph> away—'<emph>all</emph> right, title, and interest.' Yet it <emph>is</emph> my <emph>home,</emph> if not my homestead, for it is my husband's place of permanent residence, and therefore my home. And I must go back to it. I must beg him to let me in. <emph>I must,</emph> no matter how I may be received. <emph>I must,</emph> no matter how I may be afterwards treated. <emph>I must,</emph> even if his other daughter is there to insult me. <emph>I must,</emph> to spare Elsie the knowledge of this. Elsie must never know—must never suspect this." And Alice arose, and sitting up straight in bed, prepared to throw the cover off and arise, when Elsie sprang forward, and threw herself upon the bed, exclaiming, in heart-broken tones,</p>
               <p>"Elsie <emph>does</emph> know it, darling mother. Elsie knows it <emph>all.</emph> God nor angels would suffer her to be kept in ignorance of it—of all the sufferings—of all the sacrifice that has made it her duty never to leave you nor forsake you again. And may Heaven forsake me, mother, the hour that ever I leave you again!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Elsie! good, but rash child, have you ventured to come back here? Oh, Elsie!" And Alice threw her arms around the neck of her daughter, and clasped her to her bosom, and both wept copiously.</p>
               <p>At last—"Tell me what has happened, dearest child. I have no recollection of anything since my swoon," said Alice, in a faint voice, slipping from the embrace of Elsie.</p>
               <p>"Mother, darling mother, won't you please to rest now, without asking any questions? You must be so weak," replied Elsie, laying her gently down, and arranging the cover over her.</p>
               <p>"I feel weak, yet well, light, renewed; but I won't ask questions that will pain you to answer, dear child. I am almost certain of what has occurred. I swooned, and was picked up by one of the women and brought to this quarter,<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7856-00000013"/> and she sent for you. Dear Elsie, I am afraid she alarmed you. Did Magnus come, too?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, dearest Mrs. Garnet, I am here," said Doctor Hardcastle, advancing to the bedside with a cordial in his hand.</p>
               <p>Elsie raised her mother once more, and taking the restorative draught, placed it to her lips. Alice drank it, and then said,</p>
               <p>"Magnus, Elsie, I am afraid they have told you a dreadful tale of what occurred to me after you left the house. Dearest, you must not believe all that you may have heard, and you must excuse the rest. You know negroes, especially negro women, <emph>will</emph> exaggerate. They do not intentionally transcend the truth, but their quick fancies and warm sympathies lead them into extravagance. General Garnet, in the temporary insanity of rage, has done something violent, no doubt; but not so violent as has appeared to you, and no doubt he regrets his anger now. Elsie, do not think too hardly of your father. Give him time. All will come right at last. In the meanwhile, darling, I must return to the house. I must not seem inclined to make the <emph>most</emph> of his anger by absenting myself. Dearest Elsie, this morning we must part again. We will take breakfast together in this humble quarter, and then we must part, dear child, until better times. You must go with your husband, Elsie, and I must return to mine," said Alice, lifting up her arms, and embracing her child.</p>
               <p>Elsie looked at Magnus in despair. He stooped, and said,</p>
               <p>"Dear Mrs. Garnet, you must <emph>sleep</emph> now. I am your physician as well as your son. You must be silent, close your eyes, and lie still."</p>
               <p>"I cannot, Magnus. I do not feel the least inclined to sleep. I feel as though I had had a very <emph>long</emph> sleep. I feel quite fresh and renewed, though a little weak, as from want of nourishment. Besides, day is breaking. It is time to rise. This is the day you were to depart for the back-woods, and you intended to have made an early start. I cannot hinder you. I must rise. We must have one more social meal together, and then depart to our several duties." Alice spoke in a low, calm tone, but covered her face to conceal the quivering features.</p>
               <p>Magnus seized the chance to draw Elsie aside, to whisper hurriedly in her ear,</p>
               <p>"Elsie, she must know all about it. She is strong enough to bear the knowledge, and so it is perfectly safe to break it to her gently. In fact, to tell her the truth is the <emph>only</emph> safe plan. Her Providential recovery from apparent death must not be made known to any one for the present, or until General Garnet's secret disposition is ascertained and can be safely trusted. She has nothing to <emph>hope</emph> from him; she shall have nothing to <emph>fear.</emph> She must be perfectly secure from his persecutions and annoyances, until he is in a better frame of mind. This I think the safety of her life and of her reason demands. I consider that she is Providentially dead to General Garnet and living to us. She must accompany us to the West. We must be en route within an hour, lest the old sexton return and discovers all. Listen, I will go back to the church and restore everything there to such complete order, that no suspicion shall be excited. And while I am gone, do you assist her to arise, if she wishes it. When she gets up and looks about her, she will see where she is, and that will greatly prepare her for my explanation. If she asks you any questions, refer her to me alone for explanation. There, love, is the bundle of clothing you put up in your haste when about to leave Deep Dell. I brought it from the carriage just now, while you were talking with your mother. Get your double wrapper out, and slip it on her, before the window-shutter is opened. I would not have her see <emph>that</emph> garb suddenly." And having given these hasty directions, Magnus hurried out to the chapel, and having restored everything there to primal order, returned to the cottage. He found Alice sitting up by the fire with her hands clasped, and her head bowed with a look of deep thoughtfulness. Elsie had hung the tea-kettle on to make coffee, and had set the table, and was now handing out the contents of the old man's cupboard.</p>
               <p>As Doctor Hardcastle entered, Alice, without raising her head, held out her hand to him, saying,</p>
               <p>"Magnus, come here. Where am I?"</p>
               <p>And Doctor Hardcastle went and drew a chair to her side, and took her hand, and slowly, and gently, and cautiously, made known to her the events of the last two days. Alice made no comment.</p>
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7856-00000014"/>
               <p>The awful solemnity of the facts disclosed—the apparent death, the burial, veiled, softened as they were in the telling—overwhelmed her soul. She dropped her head upon her open hands, and neither moved nor spoke for a long time, or until Elsie came to her side, passed one arm earnestly over her shoulder, placed a cup of coffee at her lips with the other hand, bending her bright loving face smilingly upon her the while. Then Alice lifted up her head, took the cup, and kissed the gentle hand that gave it.</p>
               <p>While Alice drank the coffee, Dr. Hardcastle went out and attended to his mules: When he returned, they all gathered around the breakfast table. It was during that meal that he proposed to Alice the plan of accompanying them, urging upon her the strong necessity of her doing so.</p>
               <p>Alice combated all his arguments as well as her instincts taught her.</p>
               <p>Dr. Hardcastle avowed his intention of accompanying her back to Mount Calm, and remaining in the neighbourhood, in case of her perseverance in her present intention of returning. Alice sought to dissuade him from that plan.</p>
               <p>Finally, after much talk, Alice agreed to accompany them on the first stage of their journey as far as Deep Dell, and remain there incognito, while he should return to Mount Calm, and ascertain the disposition of General Garnet, and, if possible and <emph>prudent,</emph> break gradually to him the fact of his wife's unexpected restoration to life.</p>
               <p>Having agreed upon this plan, Doctor Hardcastle made rapid preparations for the re-commencement of their journey. They—he and Elsie—restored everything about the cottage to complete order; put out the fire, fastened up the cupboard, and the windows, and then the doors, and tying a little purse of money to the door-key, by way of compensation for all they had used, hid it "under the stone by the door-step," as requested, entered the carriage, and commenced their journey.</p>

               <p>THE little sea-girt homeland of Hutton's Isle had never recovered from the fatal devastation of the great tempest and flood. The fences had never been re-constructed strong and complete as before. The house had never been properly repaired. All the little mending and rebuilding that had been done had been the joint work of Miss Joe and her factotum Pontius Pilate. And these slight repairs were of such a temporary character as to require renewal every few months. And every year the house sank and fell, and grew more ruinous and dilapidated. And every year the isle became more desolate and desert. Every season the soil was less productive, and the crop poorer. The oyster-banks had failed entirely. The fisheries were becoming precarious. Nothing remained in primeval abundance except the flocks of water-fowl that still flew in vast clouds over the isle, darkening the very air at certain times, like night or storm.</p>
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7856-00000015"/>
               <p>So much for the house and isle. Now for the inmates and inhabitants.</p>
               <p>From having been always poor, they were now upon the verge of penury—destitution. Miss Josephine Cotter, the good fairy of this sea-girt isle, was, to use her own expression, growing older and older every day of her life. She did not know, she said, which was most likely to topple down first, she or her old house. This being the case, the good woman, who was completely consistent in her provident thrift, began to think of making some provision for her soul's eternal future. And to this end she worked hard night and day, at weaving a fine yarn counterpane, which, when completed, she took to Huttontown, to the village store, to exchange for a Bible and prayer-book. So far, so good. But, alas! no sooner had the saving soul possessed herself of these treasures—the nice new brown leather-bound Bible and red morocco prayer-book—than her old passion of care-taking returned upon her in full force, and prevailed to such an extent, that without even suffering the leaves to be opened, she laid her new books upon the top of the chest of drawers, along with other treasures of strictly ornamental character, such as a little black japanned waiter, with a wine-glass and tumbler, a plaster effigy of the Virgin and Child in a little glass case, and a Dutch picture of the Disciples gathering up the twelve baskets of fragments, that nothing might be lost; and which, by the way, Miss Joe said, was the only picture she ever could see any sense in. And here lay her new purchases, and upon no pretext whatever would she suffer them to be taken down, or even touched. No, indeed; they cost too much to be used, and were a great deal too nice to be handled; for books were not like other things—if they should be torn or soiled, they could not be either washed or mended, and that proved they ought not to be used. So to keep people out of the way of temptation, Miss Joe would not even suffer the leaves of her Bible and prayer-book to be cut.</p>
               <p>Under the accumulating weight of years and infirmities, and troubles that increased in an inverse ratio with her ability to bear up against them, the excellent old lady was beginning to lose something of that extraordinary industry, energy, and enterprise that had distinguished her; though she declared that she never experienced the slightest consciousness of fatigue or weariness, until she would sit down—which instigated saucy little Nettie to advise her to keep moving. The death of Pontius Pilate in the beginning of the winter, and a severe attack of rheumatism in her limbs, had seemed to be the climax of the poor old lady's misfortunes. It was now that she avowed herself "ready to sit down and give right up, and let everything go straight to the dogs;" it was now that the bread she had cast upon the waters, returned to her hands fraught with blessing. The old lady had not a friend or relative in the wide world. There was not a human being in the wide world upon whom she had the slightest claim of kinship or friendship, for succour and assistance. She was desolate in all the desolation conveyed by the words, old, poor, and alone; alone, but for society of the children she had succoured years ago—these children, the thought of whose possible want and sufferings, burdened her heart far more than any personal fear for herself. Care, tenderness for the young, was one of the strongest instincts in that rugged nature. All her toiling, saving, managing, indeed, had always been for some nephew, or grandnephew, or little cousin—<emph>never</emph> for herself. All her late efforts had been made in behalf of Hugh and Garnet—to make something, to save something for <emph>them.</emph> But all her struggles had been vain, or only served, as she said, "to keep things a little together," up to this time. And now, in her old age, she was left destitute. And now, in the depth of winter, absolute want was staring her in the face. It was immediately after the burial of Pontius Pilate, that Miss Joe was sitting down in the depth of despair, with her apron thrown over her head, and her head bowed upon her knees, Hugh and Garnet suddenly stood before her.</p>
               <p>"Don't cry any more, granny. I and Nettie can work the farm," said Hugh, in a cheerful, confidant tone.</p>
               <p>"You and Nettie work the farm!" replied Miss Joe, looking up with pity, anger, and contempt, in the expression of her countenance, and in the tone of her voice. To her, a woman past sixty, the boy of twelve and the girl of nine, seemed yet infants. "You and Nettie work the farm!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, granny, and haul the wood, and fish, and shoot—"</p>
               <p>"Pah, pah! Hush talking; you make my head ache."</p>
               <p>"Granny, I have sometimes taken the plough from Pont,<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7856-00000016"/> and ploughed a row for fun. I know a little practice would make me perfect at <emph>that.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Granny, Hugh can hoe up the hills, and I can drop corn. Hugh can cut wood, and I can fetch and carry it. And now, as there is no fish near the Isle, Hugh can go out in the boat, and I can go with him to bait his hooks, and look after the basket."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes. You can do anything that will give you an excuse to hang on to Hugh's coat tails."</p>
               <p>And the old lady covered her head with her apron, and began rocking to and fro, and groaning bitterly,</p>
               <p>"If it weren't for this rheumatiz, I could do everything myself; I know I could! But here it is; if I go out in the wind or wet, I am laid up with racking pains; if I try to do up a washing of clothes, I am laid up helpless with racking pains. Oh, dear!—if only one of the plagues was taken away, I could bear all the rest cheerfully. If the rheumatiz was taken away, I could get along with poverty. Or if poverty was taken away, along o' the need of exposing myself to the wind and rain and snow, I could get along very comfortable with the rheumatiz; but both together! Oh, it do seem to me as if God A'mighty had forgotten me."</p>
               <p>"Pray to Him! remind Him of you that way, granny;" said Hugh. "But He hasn't forgotten you, granny; it is more likely you that have forgotten Him. He has not forgotten you, for He has put it into my head and heart to do a hundred things I should never have thought of doing before. Oh, granny, never you fear; a living can be made off of this little place <emph>yet.</emph> The fish have forsaken its shores, it's true, and the oyster-bank has given out—but there are shoals of maninosies, granny; and I intend to collect them every day, and carry them to the village to sell. The money will get us what groceries we want. That's one resource; and then there are ninety-nine others—too many to talk about. As for you going out in the wind and wet, and putting your hands in the wash tub, you shan't do it, granny; I'll do it myself."</p>
               <p>"You? If I wa'n't so sorrowful, I could laugh! Who ever heard tell of a <emph>man</emph> even doing the washing, much less a <emph>boy?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"If I were a <emph>man,</emph> you may depend I would do everything that needed to be done; and now I am but a boy, why not do everything I <emph>can</emph> do, whether it be woman's work or man's work? Indeed, granny, I am so very strong! I am stronger than a grown-up <emph>woman,</emph> anyhow."</p>
               <p>He was. Like all the sons of his hardy race, Hugh Hutton was a model of Herculean strength and beauty. It is true, that up to this time, this iron force had been employed, ay, and augmented, by the wild sports of the sea coast and the Isles. But now—well did Hugh keep his word to supply the place of Pontius Pilate.</p>
               <p>And do you guess all the hard and manifold work the boy did?</p>
               <p>It was the dead of winter—the earth was frozen hard, and two feet deep with snow, crusted with ice. All the wood that was burned on the Isle had to be cut and hauled from the forest behind Huttontown, and brought over to the Isle in a boat. And the boy, with no implements but a hatchet, a small wheelbarrow, and a little row boat, performed all that labour alone, until one day, when he had made very slow progress, and effected very little, and returned home near frozen, from having been so long at work in the snow and among the ice-clad trees.</p>
               <p>Then Nettie threw herself into a violent paroxysm of excitement, and vowed that she would go with him the next day to help him gather wood in the forest. And she went. And while Hugh cut the brush and the lighter branches of the dead trees, Nettie would break them up and pile them in the wheel-barrow, enlivening the earnest, thoughtful boy all the time with her wild and joyous talk.</p>
               <p>Nettie! Child of the lonely red Isle!—solitary in her resplendent life as the sea-girt Isle she dwelt upon; glad and bright as the sunlit waters that danced and flashed around it; free, wild, and impetuous as the wind that blew over it; loving as the blessed sunshine that bathed it; beautiful and glorious as the whole divine panorama of nature around her; how shall I describe her? Full of harmony, and beauty, and fragrance, and softness, and fire, was that rich nature. Full of electricity as a torpedo was that intense and concentrated life. A whole creation of nature was crowded into it. Brilliant as a fire-fly, talkative as a magpie, joyous as a lark, proud as a peacock<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7856-00000017"/> cock, loving as a turtle-dove, was Nettie! Those are only some of the birds. She was kin to all the beasts, too. Brave as a lion, fierce as a tiger, fleet as a deer, agile as a goat, mirthful, mischievous, and imitative as a monkey, yet gentle as a lamb, was Nettie! A concentrated, double extract of everything; a minute, intense microcosm was Nettie! But the great, distinguishing trait in her singular character, was her confiding trust in all things and all persons. She was without fear and without doubt. She possessed a nature that received only all the surrounding good and repulsed all the evil. She recognised and elicited all the goodness and beauty that was in persons and things about her, and ignored all the illness and deformity. She seemed, one might say, blind to evil, or perhaps it would be more correct to say, she was strangely protected from its knowledge and influence. Highly imaginative as she was, her fancy escaped from the hard and bitter realities of her actual life, and revelled amid images of love, beauty, freedom, glory.</p>
               <p>It was in the arm of the forest that girdled the foot of Mount Calm, where they usually cut wood; and now, when the ground was white with snow, and the forest trees covered with ice, and sparkling and corruscating in the rays of the sun, Nettie would shout with delight as her blazing eyes would flash around upon the flashing scene:</p>
               <p>"This is an enchanted forest, such as we read of in the fairy book. Oh, it is! The trees are all of gold, with emerald leaves, and ruby fruits, and sapphire flowers. Oh, don't you see it is? See, how the emeralds sparkle, and the rubies burn, and the sapphires blaze. And all the ground is covered over with fine pearls and diamonds, thick as dust. See, how they glisten. Oh, this is a great enchanted forest, and here lives some powerful fairy or potent magician, who will one day make me a great Princess!—See, if he don't, that's all. And then I know who shall be Prince when I am a Princess."</p>
               <p>And then all the energy of exuberant life and joy that was in the child would break out into the wildest extravagances. And it would be impossible to guess how much or how little she might believe of her own fairy tale. And so her wild, elfish imagination would light up and purple with its fancies every scene in which she might be called to figure. It seemed impossible for Nettie to feel cold. The more piercing the cold, the brighter blazed her crimson cheeks and lips, the fiercer flashed her eyes, the more joyous were her screams and laughter, the wilder were her fancies.</p>
               <p>"See the jewels in my hair, Hugh! See the pearls and diamonds in my hair. The powerful, and munificent fairy Frostina, who dwells in this enchanted forest, has touched the little Islander with her wand, and lo! her hair is sparkling with priceless gems!" she would cry, holding up the long, long tresses of her rich dark hair, with her breath congealed to frost upon them.</p>
               <p>Nettie became the shadow of Hugh, or rather the ray, the sun-beam, the fire glow that followed him whithersoever he went. Wood-chopping, fishing, trapping, gunning, no matter what the hard labour or the dangerous sport was that took Hugh from home, Nettie would accompany him. Sometimes, on tempestuous days, Miss Joe would lay her commands on the little water-witch to stay in-doors, but Nettie, with the agility of a monkey, and the face of a Newfoundland dog, would spring upon the old lady, overwhelm her with wild and rude caresses, until she cried "Mercy!" and then bound off and rush out after Hugh.</p>
               <p>When night came the children would return together with a load of brush, a basket of maninosies, a bunch of partridges, or a string of fish, and sometimes with all these things together. Then after their frugal supper, while the old lady would sit and knit, and doze in her chair, the children would sit upon the hearth reading one of the two books that composed their whole library—"Tooke's Pantheon, or Heathen Mythology," and the "Fairy Book." Both these books were worlds of delight to Nettie. She received, without a doubt, every word of both. She believed every syllable of the Pantheon most devoutly. To her, Pan and the wood-nymphs still roamed through the forest; Neptune, Amphytrite and the Nereides still lived in the deep, deep sea. And if any one had pretended disbelief in the existence of these beings, Nettie's wild laugh of surprise and incredulity would have put such an one to shame. She knew that the gods <emph>did</emph> live. True—she had never seen Pan and the wood-nymphs distinctly face to face—though she had been on the lookout for them ever so long; but she had often, very often in the twilight caught glimpses<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7856-00000018"/> of them as they flitted through the forest trees and vanished out of her sight. And as for Neptune, Amphytrite and the Nereides, she had seen them frequently. Of an afternoon when she would be upon the beach, when the sun was setting in a blaze of glory, and the sea was clear and deep, and reflecting all the purple and golden and crimson clouds, she had looked down into the deep, profound waters, and vaguely as through a golden haze, discerned Amphytrite and the seanymphs floating languidly, luxuriously through their sea palaces of amber and coral. She talked of Zephyr and the Sylphs, too, but they were delicate spirits, she said, and would not manifest themselves. She liked Boreas better. Boreas was her good friend. She used to stop amid her evening reading when the winter wind howled around the house, and laugh aloud, and say,</p>
               <p>"<emph>That's</emph> Boreas, growling for me to come out and have a romp with him. No I won't, old fellow; you buffet me too roughly winter's nights."</p>
               <p>She worshipped Apollo. She vowed she knew that she was the child of the sun. That he had given her those glowing, crimson cheeks and lips—that lustrous black hair, with the rings of red fire glittering around the long spiral curls—and that warm blood that the fierce cold could not freeze or chill. She believed in the fairies also, but not with the ardent enthusiastic love and faith with which she received the Pantheon. She could very often see the fairies upon moonlight nights; when the frothy waves were breaking softly on the beach, she could dimly perceive their gossamer forms rising and falling, flitting and dancing between the sea and land. Like an enchanted child of some wild Eastern tale, she lived a charmed life. From the midst of the coarsest, hardest, bitterest realities of poverty, her spirit escaped to revel in the gorgeous panorama of nature, and in the free and joyous world of imagination, peopled by her own illusions. It was useless for Hugh to combat her fancies, to persevere in telling her that no such beings as the daily companions of her thoughts ever existed. Her look of wonder and pity, her wild ringing laugh of incredulity and triumph, would disconcert him. If he told her there was but one God, Nettie's countenance would become overshadowed with an awful solemnity, and she would whisper in a hushed tone of awful reverence, "I know that there is but one God above all gods; He dwelleth high in the highest Heavens!" and then, as if the subject was too solemn for her wild nature, she would break away or change it. And the earnest, thoughtful, practical boy, Hugh, would watch her, love her, bear her on his soul and up with his prayers to that awful Throne she shrank from.</p>

               <p>IT was late in the afternoon of a stormy day, near the end of December, that the two children, Hugh Hutton and Garnet Seabright, might have been seen wandering on the cold, bare, snow-clad, north-west beach of Hutton's Isle.</p>
               <p>Hugh was at this time a fine, handsome, athletic boy of twelve and a half years of age; tall, broad-shouldered, deep-chested, strong-limbed, with the high Roman features, dark complexion, and commanding countenance of all his race; a noble boy, undisguised even by the old, worn, faded, and patched suit of homespun cloth in which he was clad. Bitterly cold as it was, his head and feet were bare—<emph>bare,</emph> because though Miss Joe might shear the sheep, and card and spin the wool, and knit him socks enough, yet shoes and hats cost a great deal more money than Miss Joe or Hugh could often get together, and so shoes and hats were luxuries and elegancies only to be indulged in on Sundays and high holidays.</p>
               <p>Garnet Seabright was now about ten years of age; a beautiful, brilliant, sun-burned, or rather <emph>sun-gilded</emph> brunette, whom the sea air and sun-rays had made as hard, bright, dark, and resplendent, as the burning, crimson, sea-coast gem, whose name she bore. Child of Apollo and Amphytrite she was. Her eyes were large, dark, and burning bright; her rich and glossy hair seemed jet black in the shade, but emitted gleams of red light wherever the sun shone upon it; her complexion was rich and glowing; she wore a dress of scarlet country cloth, with coarse shoes and stockings, and a coarse straw hat;—and altogether, her bright presence warmed and illumined the cold, bleak desolation of the sea-coast, like some cheerful fire. She followed close behind Hugh, stopping whenever he stopped, and digging with a little stick wherever the little round holes in the sand indicated the presence of the maninosies, left by the subsiding wind and ebbing tide upon the beach. Very necessary was it that they should fill their basket, for very little else had they at home for supper.</p>
               <p>Their task was finished just as the clear, red winter's sun sank to a level with the horizon, lighting up all the bay like a sea of fire.</p>
               <p>The boy and girl having filled their basket, put it down, and seated themselves upon a large stone; not from fatigue—they were far too strong, and too much inured to toil and hardship to feel it now—but from that mood of idleness which will come sometimes over even the most active and energetic natures, and also from that deep, unspoken, but high, exulting love of free, wild nature, which was the peculiar characteristic of these sea-coast children.</p>
               <p>As they sat there, the attitude, bearing, and expression of countenance of Hugh was calm, high, proud, and self-reliant. One might have said, that with the coming tide of the ocean his soul was filling with strength and gladness.</p>
               <p>But the brightness of Garnet's brilliant face was overcast and clouded, and the glad song that was ever on her jocund lip was silenced.</p>
               <p>Her long fit of taciturnity at length aroused Hugh from his cheerful revery; and, putting his arm around her waist, and drawing her closer to him, he asked,</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Nettie?—I never saw you so serious and silent."</p>
               <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7856-00000020"/>
               <p>"Matter! I will never go to that school in Huttontown, again—never! I have tried it a week now, and I will not try it any longer. I cannot stand it—indeed I cannot, Hugh. Thank Heaven, this is New Year's Eve! I went there before the holidays, because I knew no better than to go. If I go there again, it will be my own fault."</p>
               <p>Well might Hugh open wide his eyes with amazement, at the looks and words of his little companion. Was this Nettie?—the confiding, joyous Nettie? It was incredible. But he concluded that this new development of character was caused by some new revelation of the little world to which the wild child had been lately introduced; and he answered calmly, by asking her a cool question—</p>
               <p>"But why don't you like your school, Garnet? You ought to like it. You ought to be very glad, and even very grateful, for this opportunity of getting an education. I am sure I should be both glad and thankful if the opportunity were offered <emph>me,</emph> and I had the leisure to accept it."</p>
               <p>"And wasn't I? Very happy and very grateful I was when Parson Wilson told me that I might come to his day school for nothing. Very glad and thankful I was. You know I danced with joy. Oh! it was because I did not know the school-girls would call me the charity scholar, and the poor people's child, that couldn't pay for her schooling; that they would gather themselves together, and edge away from me, when we all should go out to play. Oh, Hugh! I could not understand it at first, to save my life. I would keep on following them up, and talking with them, and laughing with them—because I felt so happy and sociable—and still they would go off from me, and still I <emph>couldn't</emph> understand their meaning, Hugh; but I sat and thought, and thought; and brooded over it; and wondered, and wondered. But, Hugh, all the time they were forcing their meaning on me, and grinding their meaning into me, until at length, Hugh, away here at the end of the week, I took it. I now understand them; and I will never go back to that school again. I will <emph>never</emph> put myself in the way of being treated so again."</p>
               <p>"Dear Nettie, do not say so. Dear Nettie, be patient. The treatment you complain of—"</p>
               <p>"I don't complain of it. I SCORN it!" exclaimed Nettic, bounding like a young lioness to her feet.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, this behaviour that you scorn will not last long. It was because you were a stranger that they treated you so at first. That was so natural, you know, Nettie. Even the very birds peck and bite at a stranger that comes among them at first. But afterwards they are sociable and loving enough, you know. So it will be with your school-mates. Little girls cannot behave so long. Next week you will find they will treat you very kindly. And week after next, they will be wishing to give you of all their little treasures. All the little girls I ever knew in my life were really <emph>good</emph> under all their little imitative airs of worse grown people. They will be forcing everything they can gather on you next week."</p>
               <p>"I do not want their kindness; I do not want their things! I would rather give people things, than let people give <emph>me</emph> things; for one makes me feel proud, and the other makes me feel humble. 'It is more blessed to <emph>give</emph> than to <emph>receive</emph>.' I understand that text of Scripture <emph>now,</emph> if I never did before. They have made me understand it; they have made me feel it; they have rubbed it well into me!"</p>
               <p>"No, dearest Nettie, you do not understand or feel the holiness and beauty of that text. If to give makes you feel proud, and to receive makes you feel humbled, you are very far from understanding that Scripture, and farther yet from feeling it."</p>
               <p>Without heeding his reproof, Garnet continued in the same strain:</p>
               <p>"<emph>Then</emph> it seemed so natural that I, who had no money, should not be expected to pay, that it never struck me as degrading. <emph>Now</emph> they have made it appear very different; and I will never go to that school again. They are all rich people's daughters who go there; they looked down upon me; they made me feel ashamed of my homespun frock and sunburnt face; they made me feel mean. I will never, <emph>never</emph> forgive <emph>myself</emph> for feeling so!"</p>
               <p>"No, never forgive yourself for being made to feel mean! They could not have made you feel so without your own consent—that is certain," said Hugh, indignantly.</p>
               <p>Still, without seeming to notice his rebuke, Garnet proceeded—</p>
               <p>"Here on our Island—poor as they say it is—poor as they<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7856-00000021"/> say <emph>we</emph> are—I was always free and glad and proud. I was the child of Amphytrite, and Queen of the Isle, the sea, and the winds! And the birds and fishes and sea-fowl were my subjects. I was queen of them all, and akin to them all. Yes, akin to the waters, winds, and birds, and fishes! I loved them all, and they loved me. I romped with them all,—I flew away with the birds, when they would arise and take wing over the wide waters! I dived with the fishes when they would glance down to the bottom of the deep, clear sea. At least I felt so. Every <emph>body</emph> loved me here, and every <emph>thing</emph> loved me. Many a romp have I had with the buffeting wind. And, oh! when I have stood upon the beach and laughed aloud at the leaping waves dancing, foaming, sparkling, breaking on the shore, ha! ha! hurrah! it was because I knew they were laughing at <emph>me</emph> also. And oh! of nights—of starlight nights, when I could not sleep; when I have left my little bed and come out of doors; and everything would be so calm and silent—the great lonely ocean, and the great lonely sky, with its myriads of bright stars looking down on me so steadily, so smilingly, I could almost hear them whisper and say, 'This is our little girl—this is our queer child!' And I could look up and laugh, because I was so happy—always happy day and night. But now—"</p>
               <p>"Well, but now?"</p>
               <p>"But now I shall never be happy again. Now I know I am not the daughter of Amphytrite, and the little Queen of the Bay Isle. Now I know I am nothing but a poor miserable little orphan girl, dependent on the young Methodist preacher for her schooling, if she gets any, and despised by her schoolmates—by her <emph>rich</emph> schoolmates! Why am I not rich, too? Or why are they not poor like me? Why are not <emph>all</emph> rich, or else <emph>all</emph> poor?—or, what is better still, all neither rich nor poor, but half-way between?"</p>
               <p>"Why, if there was to be such a general division, and all were to be equally well off, it would not last long. Idle, extravagant, and worthless people, and generous, liberal, magnanimous people would lose and spend their means, and impoverish themselves and their children; while careful, thrifty, industrious folks, and selfish, stingy, grasping, sordid folks, would accumulate and increase their means and enrich themselves and their heirs."</p>
               <p>"I don't feel what you say. I know I haven't been idle or extravagant, and I know I don't deserve to be poor—at least, so poor as to be despised. It is not just and fair. I know and feel that it is not just and fair for all them to be so rich, and for me to be so poor. For them to scorn me for that misfortune, which I cannot help, and which should be <emph>respected</emph> if it is a misfortune. <emph>Why</emph> should they have wealth while I have need? They do not deserve it more than <emph>I do.</emph> They do not deserve it <emph>as much;</emph> for if <emph>I</emph> had wealth I would not scorn the poor. If <emph>I</emph> had wealth, there should be <emph>no</emph> poor around me. Oh, I wish—how I do wish I was rich!"</p>
               <p>"Nettie, do you remember our pastor's text and sermon last Sunday week—'It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven?'"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I <emph>do;</emph> and I remember feeling very uneasy for the rich people who were there, and I looked at them, but they did not seem to be very much alarmed."</p>
               <p>"Do you not recollect that he proved to us all very clearly that riches could not make any of us happy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know he said so, but he didn't look as if he believed it; and I, for my part, should like very much to try it all by myself alone, and then I should feel more certain about it. Oh, Hugh, how I want to be rich, that I may hold up my head among the best of them. Oh, Hugh, dear Hugh, haven't I got any very wealthy relatives anywhere—away off in the West, or the North, or across the seas in the Old Country, who might hear of me, and give me a great fortune?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed, Nettie; you have no near relations at all, and your distant ones are all very poor."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Hugh, all I ask of fate, in this world, is only <emph>one thing</emph>—wealth; and it seems there is not a bit of chance of my getting it."</p>
               <p>"I have heard of the curse of a granted prayer, Garnet," said Hugh, sadly.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Hugh, I should like to be just a little bit cursed with riches. Oh, Hugh, what golden days were those, when old granny in the corner always turned out to be a powerful and beneficent fairy, and turned pebbles into gems, pumpkins into coaches, and mice and rats into horses and footmen. And when poor little despised and forsaken Cinderella wept to go<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7856-00000022"/> to the Prince's Ball, with a single wave of the wand, turned all her rags to splendid apparel, and sent her off in a coach and six! Oh, Hugh, I have been waiting these many years to see our old granny in the corner, cast her slough and come out a young, beautiful, potent, and beneficent fairy queen, who would turn this barren island into a great kingdom, and that ruined lodge into a magnificent palace. And the sand and pebbles into gold-dust and diamonds, and the ducks and geese into lords and ladies, and you and me into king and queen. But, oh dear! I am almost tired of waiting. I'm beginning to fear that granny will never be anything but what she insists that she is—'a poor old creetur, killed up with the rheumatiz;' and you and I will never be anything but what we now are—two poor children."</p>
               <p>"Begging your pardon, I think we shall be man and woman some of these days. Now be hopeful, my dear Garnet. I tell you that the fairy of your fancy really does exist."</p>
               <p>"What! a fairy who will turn this island into a kingdom; this lodge into a palace; the sand and pebbles into gold-dust and precious stones?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes; a hundred times yes."</p>
               <p>"Where, Hugh, where?"</p>
               <p>"HERE!" said Hugh Hutton, tapping his own forehead, significantly. "But be easy, Garnet; be easy, or else be anxious for better things. <emph>I</emph> will make a fortune for you, and more than that, I will make position, rank, HONOUR for you! YOU SHALL 'hold up your head with the highest in the land.' Not because you are wealthy, but because you will stand by my side, and I will stand—HIGH! I know it; I feel it, Nettie; and I can wait and work for it."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Hugh, my brother! I do love you so dearly!"</p>
               <p>"Only be good, and be easy, Nettie, and do the duty of the present hour. Do you recollect, sister, the subject of our pastor's sermon only the last Sunday that ever was?"</p>
               <p>"No, I did not heed it much. I was too busy watching that bright, beautiful Miss Elsie. Miss Garnet, of Mount Calm. How lovely, how charming she looked; so radiant! softly radiant, like a light, silvery cloud floating high in the heavens among the sun-rays. Now I did not mind <emph>her</emph> being so very wealthy. It seemed to be all right that she should be raised above all the hardness and roughness and coarseness of the earth. She was so soft, so fair, so airy. I was glad to see her wrapped in the beautiful blue satin mantle, with the white swan's-down around her throat; and to see her lovely face in the delicate white bonnet, with the floating gossamer veil and plumes. They seemed to suit her. I was happy to see her waited on to her splendid carriage by so many gentlemen. It looked right that she should be so served. I was glad to see that splendid carriage, with the prancing gray horses, and smart coachman, and footmen, roll off so slowly and grandly towards Mount Calm. And I gazed up at the fine mansion-house on the hill, and thought that it was all right that such a beautiful and radiant creature should have such a handsome house to dwell in. Because I do not see how she could live in any other way."</p>
               <p>"Humph! What would you think, Nettie, if I should tell you that I saw that 'beautiful and radiant creature,' that delicate and elegant lady, who seemed born only to live in palaces, ride in carriages, be attended by trains of gentlemen, and served by slaves dressed as gentlemen—and to wear only soft clothes, and touch only soft things, and smell only sweet and fragrant odours, and see only beautiful sights, and hear only harmonious sounds—to listen only to words of praise and flattery! What would you say if I were to tell you that I saw that lady, wrapped in a coarse brown cloak, with a brown silk hood, sitting in an emigrant wagon, drawn by mules; sitting by the side of her husband, among boxes, bundles, and house-hold utensils; about to start for the back-woods; to live in a log cabin in the wilderness; to sleep hard, and to fare hard, and <emph>work</emph> hard; to be the only housekeeper and servant in her husband's cabin—to cook, and wash, and iron, and scour, if need be, while her husband should till the ground, or track the deer, or visit his patients—if he should get any. What would you think if I should tell you that she looked happier than you ever saw her look? Yes, with a diviner happiness. What would you think, Garnet?"</p>
               <p>"Well, sure I should think you were telling me a fairy tale, or else that I was dreaming one."</p>
               <p>"Yet, Nettie, what I have told you is strictly true. Nettie, when I bade her good-bye, before the tavern door of Huttontown, I would have knelt and kissed the hem of her<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7856-00000023"/> garment, and prayed for her blessing, as if she had been saint or angel."</p>
               <p>"And you do not say that it is true? that the lovely lady left all her ease, and luxury, and wealth, and splendour, to go to a log cabin in the wilderness, to hard work and to hard living?" said Nettie, with her starry eyes agaze.</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And that she was willing to go?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And happy?"</p>
               <p>"Divinely happy!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>What was the mystery?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"A mystery of a single word, whose full, deep meaning I only dimly apprehend myself, Nettie—but I do know that it is a religion—LOVE!"</p>
               <p>"Love?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear Nettie. But come; 'let us do the duty of the present hour,' as our minister said. And it does seem to me that the duty of the present hour is to take this basket of maninosies home to Aunt Joe, who must be waiting for them."</p>
               <p>And smiling, with his grave, sweet smile, Hugh Hutton arose, lifted the basket of shell-fish to his shoulders, and gave his hand to Nettie.</p>
               <p>As they turned towards home, they perceived that the cottage windows already gleamed with the light of the evening fire.</p>

               <p>THE fire-light gleamed redly through the cottage windows on the snow, as the boy and girl approached and opened the door.</p>
               <p>The night was closing in very dark and cold. The slight moisture in the air was congealing, and settling in the form of heavy, cold vapour, all over the island and the surrounding waters, and enveloping everything in a cold, shroud-like mist.</p>
               <p>Very welcome was the warmth and shelter of the poor lodge, bare and bleak as it was. The room had undergone few changes, since we saw it last. The broad fire-place, with its great iron fire-dogs, still spread out its wide flanks, requiring almost a quarter of a cord of wood to fill it. A great fire of brush was blazing there now. The shelves of the corner cupboard on the right still shone resplendent with rows of pewter plates, and gay with variegated delf-ware, chosen by Miss Joe, because, she said, their mixed colours wouldn't show dirt. An innocent illusion of the old lady's economy, for she never had any dirt about her house or goods to show. The humble bedstead, with its nice bed and bedding of immaculate cleanliness, covered with the neat blue plaid yarn counterpane, and surmounted by pillows, large, full, light, and white as snowdrifts<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7856-00000024"/> drifts, still stood upon the left. At the upper end of the large room the spinning-wheel and the loom occupied opposite corners. The chest of drawers, with its mirror, its scriptural picture, its wine-glasses and tumblers, and its show-Bible and prayer-book, stood upon one side of the room, and the white deal table on the other. A few coarse flag-bottomed chairs completed the humble furniture. Miss Joe was—spite of the rheumatism—moving about almost as busily as ever, clad in her striped yarn petticoat, coarse cotton short-gown, white cotton cap, and sheep-skin mittens, and coarse, but clean shoes and stockings. She hurried to meet the boy and girl, to take the basket from them, and order them to the fire, throwing to each a bunch of cotton to pick, so as not to be losing time while they warmed themselves. Then she took the basket of shell-fish, and emptied them into a tub of water, preparatory to cooking them for supper. And next, as this was New Year's Eve, she began to mix the materials for a crackling pone; a great luxury to the hungry children, and one they had often declared to be just as good as pound-cake. Well, their frugal supper was soon ready, and by the time the boy and girl had finished their task of cotton-picking, it smoked upon the table. A cup of weak bohea tea, "scared" with a little coarse brown sugar, and liberally diluted with milk, a tureen of savoury-stewed maninosies, and a pone of rich, crackling bread—that was all,—a very good supper for a poor family on a cold winter's night; one with which the healthy, hearty, hungry lad and lass were abundantly satisfied, and with which Miss Joe might have been well contented; only that the people of the Western Shore—that rich and fertile land, abounding in every description of game, fish and water-fowl—whatever their circumstances may be in other respects, as far as their tables are concerned, are accustomed to good and even very luxurious living.</p>
               <p>And so Miss Josephine Cotter, when she sat down to a frugal meal, thought herself so ill used by Providence, that she burst into tears.</p>
               <p>In an instant Nettie had bounded and sprung upon her neck, covering her with hearty caresses, deafening her with assurances of affection, as if affection was the consolation for all the evils upon earth. Hugh stood up and looked grave and troubled.</p>
               <p>"Sit down, Nettie, child, and eat your supper if you <emph>can</emph> eat it. Hugh, take your seat and make out a meal if you <emph>can</emph> do so. I suppose you can. Children almost always have good appetites, and never have sense enough to take trouble. Such weak tea! I have been a housekeeper—this—fifty-odd <emph>year,</emph>" said Miss Joe, snubbing and sobbing as she poured out the tea and handed it round—"<emph>year,</emph> and never, <emph>never</emph> did I sit down to supper on New Year's Eve without—without—without cake and SWEETMEATS." This last word was blurted out with a loud sob, wail, almost yell. "And never, <emph>never,</emph> so long as I have kept house, this fifty year and more, have I kept Christmas and New Year without a—TURKEY, and, and, and MINCE-PIE. Oh!-h!-h! I'm a goin' to the dogs as fast as ever I can go, that's a sure thing. Ef that derned old General Garnet—General Iron, as the niggers call him—had o' done <emph>his</emph> duty, I shouldn't o' been to this here pass."</p>
               <p>"He's my God-father. Ain't he?" asked Nettie, blowing her tea and sipping it. "Say, granny, he's my God-father, ain't he?"</p>
               <p>"No! he's your Devil-father, that's what he is."</p>
               <p>"But ain't I his God-child?"</p>
               <p>"No! You're his Devil-child. That's what I believe, and always did."</p>
               <p>"I do wish you had turkey and mince-pie, granny. Indeed if I knew where to get them for you I would get them," said Nettie, surmising that the want of the turkey and mince-pie was at the bottom of all Miss Joe's ill humour.</p>
               <p>"If General Garnet had behaved like a Christian man, I should have had both. It has been a many a long day since I applied to him, Nettie, on your account. I gin it up long ago. I'd scorn to ask him to <emph>give</emph> me anything. I'd scorn to ask him to <emph>lend</emph> me money. But just about a week ago, just afore Christmas, seeing as how I couldn't raise a turkey for Christmas no way, I just writes him a note, and making an excuse by telling him how <emph>you</emph> was a getting along, and how you were well and hearty, and going to school to the Riverint Parson Wilson. I just axes him to lend me the loan of a good fat turkey hen, and I'd pay him after New Year.<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7856-00000025"/> And, bless patience, if he tuk one bit o' notice of my note at all!"</p>
               <p>"But, Aunt Joe, you know that was the day his daughter was married and left home, and you may depend he had a great deal to think of," suggested Hugh.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, and why didn't he 'tend to it arterwards? Tell me that, since you will make excuses for him?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Aunt Joe, you <emph>know</emph> his wife died suddenly, and surely <emph>that</emph> was enough to put every other thing out of his head."</p>
               <p>"Well! the poor, dear, sweet creature, God bless her! she's a great deal better off than we poor sinners; still I was very sorry for her, and should o' been sorrier still ef I hadn't had so many troubles of my own to think of. But Hugh, she's been dead and buried these four or five days, and he's had plenty o' chance to tend to my little note. But, no! he won't do it. He never <emph>would;</emph> he never <emph>did.</emph> If ever he'd answer any letter I'd write him about Nettie, it was always to make some excuse; he made the same excuse so many times that I got it by heart. It was always—'circumstances beyond my control'—pish! tush! tut! pshaw! He didn't want to do anything, and he didn't mean to do anything," exclaimed Miss Joe, rising from the table in great wrath, and going vigorously to work clearing away.</p>
               <p>Hugh and Nettie started up and began to assist her, and in an incredibly short space of time the table was cleared away, the hearth swept up, and the fire replenished.</p>
               <p>Then Miss Joe gave Nettie a large bunch of seedy cotton to pick, handed Hugh a pair of cards to card rolls, and, lastly, drew her small wheel up to the chimney-corner, and sat and spun. They were all working in unity, and this was the order of their labour. Nettie had the lightest part of it. She picked the seed from the cotton, and handed the clear cotton to Hugh. Hugh took it, rubbed it on the teeth of his cards, and carded it into long rolls, which he passed to Miss Joe, who attached it to her spindle, and spun it into yarn.</p>
               <p>There was something very enlivening about this social fireside labour. Each one felt its cheering effects. They were so really comfortable, too. All was so profoundly still without. All was so quiet, snug, and warm within. The fire blazed so brightly, lighting up the whole room. Little Nettie forgot her dissatisfaction with the social relations of the rich and poor. Miss Joe forgot that she was "going to the dogs as fast as she could go." Hugh—but <emph>he</emph> was always cheerful. What if they were three isolated human beings on the lonely bay isle—cut off by miles of sea from every other human being? what if when they paused in work or talk, the awful stillness of the solitary place was not broken by any—the slightest—the most distant—sound of human life? by anything save the monotonous boom of the sea upon the beach? They did not pause to listen to the dread silence. Miss Joe merrily turned her wheel; Hugh vigorously pushed his cards; and little Nettie, perhaps because her cotton picking was too soft and gentle work, to help give vent to the life of energy in her, began to hum—then to trill—and finally broke out into singing a lively glee. Hugh caught up the refrain, and they sang and shouted, and shouted and sang, back and forth, forth and back, until the old smoke-dried rafters of the lodge kitchen rang again; until Miss Joe, pausing in the swift turning of her wheel, exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Can't you hush? I thought I heard a man's step crunching through the snow."</p>
               <p>"A man's step!" echoed Hugh, with a look of surprise.</p>
               <p>"A man's step!" re-echoed Nettie, her eyes wide open with astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Yes! A man's heavy step crunching through the snow. There, listen! there it is again. It seems to be coming up the hill towards the house—listen!"</p>
               <p>They all listened.</p>
               <p>Crunch, crunch, crunch came the heavy, regular, monotonous tramp.</p>
               <p>And it is impossible to convey the effect of that regular, heavy sound breaking upon the profound stillness and solitude of night on that sea-girl isle.</p>
               <p>"In the name of Heaven who can it be?" exclaimed Miss Joe, as nearly frightened as ever she was in her life.</p>
               <p>Crunch, crunch, crunch came the step, nearing the door.</p>
               <p>"I am going to see," exclaimed Hugh, seizing up a pine knot, lighting it at the fire, and making for the door.</p>
               <p>Miss Joe could scarcely repress a scream.</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7856-00000026"/>
               <p>Nettie stood like a young panther at bay. Clinging to Miss Joe in terror, yet looking towards the door with her eyes ablaze with defiance.</p>
               <p>Just as a loud rap startled them afresh, Hugh swung the door open, and a tall, majestic-looking man, wrapped in a large cloak, strode into the room.</p>

               <p>"THAT'S goodfather! As sure as a gun that's godfather!" exclaimed Nettie, making one bound from the place where she stood to a chair, and springing thence to the bosom of the new comer, where she clung desperately, pressing her arms around his neck; holding his head between her hands, while she kissed his eyes, and cheeks, and lips; then rubbing and rooting her head into his bosom, and screaming with delight.</p>
               <p>"And is it possible you recollect me, little Nettie?" asked General Garnet (for it was he), in a tone of voice almost sad.</p>
               <p>"Recollect you, godfather, sure I do! Though you have been away so long; I haven't seen you since I was a woodsprite, and that was a long time ago, and now I am a waternymph," exclaimed Nettie, rubbing her head into him, and clinging around him, laughing with joy.</p>
               <p>"Wild as ever, Nettie!"</p>
               <p>"Wild! yes! You know when I was a wood-sprite I could climb trees like a squirrel; well, now I am a sea-nymph—I can swim like a duck and dive like a fish—ask granny if I can't!" cried Nettie, reiterating all her exclamations of affection and delight, and repeating all her impetuous caresses.</p>
               <p>"It seems to me that you love me a little, Nettie?" said he, in the same sad tone.</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7856-00000027"/>
               <p>"Love you a little, godfather! Oh! just open your cloak and take me inside next to you. Oh! just unbutton your coat, and button me up inside of that, too. I love you well enough to let you swallow me, godfather," exclaimed the imp, nestling close to him with her arms about his neck, her head tucked into his bosom, and wriggling with delight.</p>
               <p>"Yes, you do love me—disinterestedly—poor, forsaken child! And you are the only thing on earth that does love me," said he, folding both arms about her.</p>
               <p>All this took place in a very few minutes, while Miss Joe was rising in her corner, setting aside her wheel, smoothing down her apron, and coming forward to meet her visiter, saying,</p>
               <p>"Nettie, jump down this moment, and don't trouble the 'gentleman.'" But Nettie clung tighter, and General Garnet held her closer. "General Garnet, sir, it is an unexpected honour to see you here. Pray, come to the fire and sit down. Hugh, shut that door, and set a chair for the General, and throw more brush on the fire. General, do sit down, and don't let that wild child bother you so. Come down, Nettie, I say."</p>
               <p>"I sha'n't, granny!"</p>
               <p>"Never mind, Miss Joe, I like to have her here," said General Garnet, throwing off his cloak, seating himself in a large arm-chair at the fire, and seating Nettie on his knee. "Well, my old friend, how does fate use you now-a-days?" he finally asked of the old lady.</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, very well, indeed; fust-rate, I thank you," answered proud Miss Joe.</p>
               <p>"I am very glad to hear it," commented her visiter, with one arm still clasping Nettie, while he glanced sarcastically around the room.</p>
               <p>Miss Joe did not perceive the irony, but she saw his suit of deep mourning, and suddenly recollected that she might be expected to say something appropriate to the occasion. So, composing her countenance to funeral solemnity, she looked at General Garnet and said, very seriously, the following common-place—</p>
               <p>"We have heard of your heavy bereavement in the sudden death of your wife, General Garnet, and we are very much grieved. But you know, sir, death is the common lot of all. It is the only condition we can—can have life <emph>on!</emph> It's just as natral as being born. And so, sir, I hope you'll be able to bear up under your fate like a philosopher. Besides which, it is the will of God. And being just so, I trust you will have grace to resign yourself to your trials like a Christian."</p>
               <p>"I trust so, I trust so," replied General Garnet, speaking quickly; then he added, "It augments my sorrow very much, however, to remember that it was the misconduct of the daughter that precipitated the fate of the mother."</p>
               <p>"Good Heaven! you don't say so, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; you may as well know the truth, my good old friend. Elsie threw herself entirely away; eloped and went off to the West with that worthless beggar, Hardcastle," said he, looking around to see the effect of his words.</p>
               <p>Hugh's head sprang up with an expression of indignant astonishment, denial and defiance on his fine countenance.</p>
               <p>Nettie gazed at him—appalled.</p>
               <p>Miss Joe stared, with mouth and eyes all open with wonder, exclaiming,</p>
               <p>"Good gracious, sir, you don't tell me so. I heard <emph>something—</emph> but I didn't—I never—well, dear me—Lord a-mercy. Was it really that away, arter all?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and now my good friend, my excellent friend, let us change the subject; it is too painful; much too painful: even you can judge what a father's and a husband's feelings must be upon such an occasion. Let us leave the agonizing topic, and never revert to it again. Let us turn to a more agreeable subject. My dear little goddaughter here," said he, bending over the child on his knee with his soft, bright smile,—a smile as charming as full, beautifully curved lips, pearly teeth, and a dark moustache, and the spirit of Belial could make it; "my dear little godchild here—she is a very fine little girl, and will one day, no doubt, make a very accomplished woman. You have taken good care of her; it is easy to see that. What rosy cheeks she has!"</p>
               <p>"I have taken as good care of her as I could, sir,—which being an old woman—too old to follow after children—wasn't much."</p>
               <p>"I am under great obligations to you, Miss Joe, and must find some way in which to repay you for the years of trouble<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7856-00000028"/> and expense you have been put to upon account of my little ward."</p>
               <p>"Not at all, sir; you owe me nothing," said the proud old lady. "I have always been a t'iling, striving, saving soul; but I never saved anything, as I thought any one near me, 'specially a little child, was a sufferin' for. No, General Garnet, ef I am to be paid at this hour of the day, I had rather the Lord pay me. I don't want <emph>you</emph> to take it out'n His hands."</p>
               <p>General Garnet, turning to little Nettie, again took her hand, looked at the beautifully moulded but sun-browned thing, and said, softly and smilingly,</p>
               <p>"You have a very pretty-shaped hand, my dear little girl. You ought to take care of it. You ought to wear gloves."</p>
               <p>"Hain't got any, godfather."</p>
               <p>"But you should get them or have them got for you—why don't you?"</p>
               <p>"Couldn't dig for maninosies or break brush with gloves on, godfather."</p>
               <p>"Why, you don't do these shocking things?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeedy! and I'm going coon-hunting with Hugh next moonshiny night that comes."</p>
               <p>"Next moonlight night that comes you will be in a very different-looking place from this," said he, pushing the lurid black ringlets back gently behind her ears, and noticing for the first time that sure index of "gentle blood" in human kind or horses—<emph>the small and elegantly formed ear.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Where shall I be, godfather?"</p>
               <p>"Never mind where! They have not bored your ears, Nettie!"</p>
               <p>"No; I haven't had my ears bored, but I saw a picture of an Indian with his <emph>nose</emph> bored."</p>
               <p>"Pooh!—yet after all, one is about as barbarous as the other, little Nettie. Nettie, my little girl, would you like to go home and live with me?"</p>
               <p>"Go home and live 'long o' you! Um—m—m—me—no! I had rather you'd come and live 'long o' me."</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"'Cause I don't want to leave granny; she wouldn't have anybody to hug her up and keep her back warm at night."</p>
               <p>"But if we were to take granny with us, too?"</p>
               <p>"Um—m—m—me. Could you take <emph>Hugh</emph> along, too?" asked the child, with the astute air of one making a shrewd bargain.</p>
               <p>"<emph>No,</emph>" very decidedly answered General Garnet; adding, in a lower tone, "no more childish friendships ripening into mature love."</p>
               <p>"Very well, then, godfather, if you love me, you'll have to come and live 'long of us; for I can't go home 'long o' <emph>you.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Why not, pray?"</p>
               <p>"'Cause, godfather, how could Hugh live here by himself?"</p>
               <p>"Well, little 'Martha,' anxious and troubled about many things, Hugh need not live here by himself. Suppose I was to get a situation for Hugh?"</p>
               <p>"A what?"</p>
               <p>"Suppose I were to put Hugh in the way of getting an honest living?"</p>
               <p>"La, godfather, no white men about here except niggers ever get an honest living, and I can't let you black Hugh's face and crisp his hair—<emph>that's</emph> black enough already—and make a nigger of him!"</p>
               <p>"You silly child, you will let me make a lawyer, or a doctor, or a parson of him, won't you?"</p>
               <p>Before Nettie could answer, Hugh Hutton came up, cap in hand, and stood facing General Garnet.</p>
               <p>"Well, my boy?" said the latter.</p>
               <p>"General Garnet, if you have any notion of taking Nettie away from here, just look out for <emph>her</emph> and the old lady, who has had the care of her so long, and never mind me. I can take care of myself. Nettie, darlin', never stop for me; I know what to do with myself. And now, General, as long as I am talking to you, I must tell you I don't believe one word about Doctor Hardcastle's being a worthless man, because I know he is a good and great man; nor do I believe one word of Miss Elsie's breaking her mother's heart, because—because I know she is as good as she is beautiful. You needn't be angry. I should have hated myself if I hadn't spoke out!" exclaimed the boy, his frank, brave spirit flashing boldly from his eyes.</p>
               <p>But the words had scarcely left the lips of Hugh before<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7856-00000029"/> Nettie had jumped to her feet, and administered a sound box of the ear to him, exclaiming,</p>
               <p>"<emph>Now!</emph> take that! Now, <emph>you</emph> make godfather out to be a story-teller again!" and having given her sharp little lesson, Nettie sprung back to her seat, and threw her arms again around his neck. General Garnet, without seeming to have seen her action, regarded the boy with a sort of gentle, dignified surprise, and leisurely scorn, merely saying,</p>
               <p>"Why, you impertinent young dog!"</p>
               <p>Nettie sprung down a second time. General Garnet gently attempted to restrain her, but she dashed his hands away, exclaiming,</p>
               <p>"Let me alone, godfather. You are wicked and ugly, and I <emph>hate</emph> you. He's <emph>not</emph> an impudent young dog at all! he is my dear, gentle brother Hugh," she said, throwing herself about the neck of the boy, who folded his arms around her.</p>
               <p>"You must please to excuse Nettie, sir; indeed she is the wildest, queerest child that ever was born—but then, you know, she was wild and queer before ever I took her in hand," said Miss Joe, who was all this time busy with a saucepan over the fire; and a pitcher, a bowl, and some eggs, sugar, and spices on a chair by her side.</p>
               <p>"Nettie seems to have very little self-control or any other sort of control," dryly observed the General.</p>
               <p>"Now if you ain't mad long o' granny. Just as if it was <emph>her</emph> fault. And <emph>she</emph> making you mulled cider, too, to keep the cold out of your stomach. And taking the top-knot hen's eggs, too, that she was saving to set, because they're a firstrate breed of hens, that lay eggs all the winter, and she wants more of them. And she had but six eggs, and now she's taken three to make you mulled cider to keep the cold from striking to your stomach; and you to get mad long o' her, and cut her up short for nothing. Never mind him, granny. I'll speak right up for you, and take your part," said Nettie, with her arms still clasped around Hugh's neck, looking at her guardian, who was regarding her with a smile of mingled amusement and condescending toleration.</p>
               <p>"Don't you mind her, sir. Eggs ain't no scarcity in this house; no, nor anything else you could want. Would you like the leg of a cold turkey, broiled, with a little currant jelly, sir? Or a few queen-cakes, with a glass of good old sherry?"</p>
               <p>"Why, granny, I thought you hadn't—"began Nettie, but Hugh put his hand over her lip, and whispered,</p>
               <p>"Don't talk too much, Nettie. Go make friends with your guardian."</p>
               <p>Nettie turned—saw once more the tolerant, indulgent smile that was beaming on her—and, with her usual way of assimilating only the good and the beauty of a mixed thing, sprang at once to his arms, to his neck, and caressing him vehemently, asked—</p>
               <p>"You are not mad with me, are you, godfather? I love you dearly! dearly! 'deed I do, godfather!" and turning around his bushy face between her little hands, she kissed him many times, repeating her question—"You are not mad 'long 'o me, are you, godfather?"</p>
               <p>"No, darling little <emph>Nettle,</emph> I am not."</p>
               <p>I have often thought that the spell of power that child held over that man's hard, stern, reserved nature was this:—the blending of passionate fondness, with perfect freedom, frankness and fearlessness in her feelings and her manners towards him.</p>
               <p>General Garnet then turned, and addressing himself seriously to the old lady, informed her that he thought the time had come for him to discharge the great obligation under which he lay to his worthy deceased friend, the late gallant Corporal Seabright, and redeem the promise made to his widow, when dying—by taking care of the rearing, education, and future fortunes of their orphan girl. That it was now expedient that his dear little goddaughter and ward should be brought into proper restraint and training. That in order this should be fittingly accomplished, it was necessary that his sweet little ward should become an inmate of his house, and live under his immediate protection and supervision. That being most unhappily a widower, and having no lady at the head of his establishment to look after his household, and do the honours, he should be under the necessity of engaging the services of some highly respectable matron as housekeeper. That he thought no more competent person for the duties of the position could be found in the world than Miss Josephine Cotter—and, under all the circumstances, no one<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7856-00000030"/> could be found to fill the situation with such perfect propriety. That if she chose to exchange her lodge on the isle for the housekeeper's rooms at Mount Calm, she might name her own salary, and he would come up to it, or exceed it.</p>
               <p>Miss Joe's eyes twinkled under her iron-bound spectacles, but she hesitated to answer.</p>
               <p>General Garnet gave her full time to digest his proposition, while he toyed with the child upon his knee—telling her of her new home, and new prospects as far as he thought she could comprehend them—promising her new dresses, books, playthings, a pony, &amp;c. Finally, he raised his head and turned to Miss Joe, saying,</p>
               <p>"Well, madam, have you reflected upon my proposition? and what do you think of it?"</p>
               <p>Miss Joe hemmed, cleared her throat, blew her nose, wiped the tears from her eyes, rubbed her specs and replaced them, and then said,</p>
               <p>"She didn't know. She was used to staying where she was. She had lived there twenty odd years, and did not feel like leaving it at her time of life. Besides, she must see what could be done for Hugh. She must take time to consider. She couldn't give an answer no way till next day."</p>
               <p>General Garnet acceded to the short delay, and smiling to himself, arose to take leave; tasted and praised Miss Joe's mulled cider; kissed and fondly embraced little Nettie; nodded to Hugh Hutton; shook hands with Miss Joe, and withdrew.</p>

               <p>VERY early on the morning of the second of January, while yet the level rays of the newly-risen sun were projecting golden lines of light aslant the snow-covered earth, the travelling carriage of General Garnet passed through Huttontown on its way to the beach, to take in Miss Joe and little Nettie, who were that day to leave their island home.</p>
               <p>At the same hour, Miss Joe was bustling over her last preparations at the Isle. The simple furniture was to be safely stowed away, and left in the house; the most valuable portion of their personal effects was to be transported to Mount Calm at more leisure; her own and Nettie's clothing was packed into a chest ready to be taken away.</p>
               <p>Hugh's bundle was made up and slung at the end of a stick across his shoulder. The boy certainly looked the most hopeful and happy of the three.</p>
               <p>"Dear Hugh, you do just 'mind me of Jack in the fairy tale, going to seek his fortune," said Nettie, gazing at him with admiration."</p>
               <p>Nettie herself was wild with joy and expectation. Scarcely had she slept or ate since the noted visit of her godfather<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7856-00000031"/> How could she?—all the fairy tales she had ever read in her life, were about to be realized in her own person: she was Cinderella, going in splendid style to the royal palace, to be married to the king's son; she was Beauty, who had just discovered the Beast to be a handsome, powerful prince, who was going to make a princess of her; or, if not literally <emph>so,</emph> her dreams were equally fanciful and extravagant. But how different was the reality, poor Nettie! more fairy-favoured as wood-sprite in the forest wild, or water-nymph in her sea-girt Isle, than ever as heiress of the millionaire in the cold magnificence of Mount Calm.</p>
               <p>The last thing Miss Joe did was to put out the fire, and dress Nettie in a little cloak of scarlet country-cloth, made with a hood to go over her head.</p>
               <p>At which Nettie, with many extravagant capers, declared herself to be Little Red Riding Hood in person.</p>
               <p>When all was done, and the house locked up, the three took their way down the solitary foot-path through the snow to the water's edge.</p>
               <p>Hugh had already cleaned out the boat, and they all got into it. Hugh took the oar. The water was very smooth, the current in their favour, and in twenty minutes the boy landed his charge safely upon the beach.</p>
               <p>The carriage of General Garnet was in waiting.</p>
               <p>Miss Joe and Nettie were handed in by Hugh, and then the boy put in his hand to bid them good-bye.</p>
               <p>Miss Joe burst into tears, sobbed aloud, told Hugh if he should not find his place as shop-boy at Mr. Fig's grocery pleasant, to let her know, and she would go right back to Hutton's Isle, and they two would work together, and see better times when the warm weather should come.</p>
               <p>Nettie, for her part, much as she loved Hugh, could not cry. She had read too many fairy tales not to know how her own ought to end; and so Nettie felt perfectly assured that by some denouement at Mount Calm, every wish of her heart must be accomplished, most especially the dearest wish of all, that of having her playmate always with her. So they took leave Hugh struck into a by-path, and walked off briskly towards the store of Mr. Fig. And the carriage rolled on up through the main street of the village, and out over the country try road that led over the snow-covered hills and through the hollow to Mount Calm.</p>
               <p>Arrived at Mount Calm, they were met by General Garnet, who, receiving little Nettie in his arms, pressed her fondly and carried her into the house, followed by Miss Joe. Here, in the hall, he delivered the little girl to the charge of a neatly-dressed, "lady-like" mulatto girl, with a gay Madras turban on her head, and a pair of heavy gold hoops in her ears, telling her to take Miss Seabright to the chamber lately occupied by Miss Garnet, and to prepare her for the breakfast-table.</p>
               <p>"And what's your name?" asked Nettie, looking up with curiosity at the gay mulatto.</p>
               <p>"Nettie, my darling, she is Hero, your maid," said General Garnet.</p>
               <p>Hero took the hand of the child, and was about to lead her up the great staircase, when Nettie suddenly broke from her, and exclaiming, interrogatively, "This way?" sprang up the stairs like a squirrel.</p>
               <p>Hero tripped after her, overtook her on the landing, and gently took her hand, saying,</p>
               <p>"Miss Seabright, young ladies oughtn't to romp through a quiet house, and race up stairs in that manner."</p>
               <p>"I know young ladies oughtn't to, but I am a little gal."</p>
               <p>"You are a little lady, and should act like one. But here is your chamber, Miss Seabright," said Hero, opening the door of Elsie's beautiful room.</p>
               <p>"Oh, how—how grand!" exclaimed Nettie, breaking from her maid, springing into the midst of the apartment, and standing gazing, speechless with admiration, upon the splendours—for such they were to her—of the furniture.</p>
               <p>The French paper on the walls, with its pretty pattern of wild-rose vines climbing up gilded pillars and forming into arches; the carpet on the floor, chosen to match, with wild-rose vines runing over a white ground; the pink, damask, and white muslin curtains of the windows, that suffused the whole chamber with a soft, roseate light; the rose-wood dressing bureau standing between these two windows, with its tall mirror and marble top, and elegant ornaments of porcelain, pearl, and gold; the rose-wood bedstead, standing in the opposite recess, with its white-embossed counterpane, and rich valance,<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7856-00000032"/> all softly shaded by hanging curtains of pink damask, like those of the windows; the wardrobe, with its mirror doors, occupying the side to the left of the chimney; the marble-top table, with its elegant trifles—a work-box of mother-of-pearl and gold, a standish of ebony, inlaid with ivory; a portfolio, books, &amp;c.; the work-stand of satin-wood; the luxurious sofa, chair, and ottoman, covered with rose-coloured cut velvet to suit the draperies; the polished steel grate, with its silver mounting, and marble mantel-piece, with its ormolu clock, vases, statuettes, medallions, &amp;c.; lastly, the paintings, few, but admirable, though attractive to Nettie chiefly upon account of the massive and richly-gilded frames.</p>
               <p>Introducing Nettie into that elegant, luxurious chamber, was like letting a monkey loose in a fancy-shop. For a moment she stood shading her eyes with her hand, as she would have done in looking upon a dazzling winter landscape, gazing transfixed with surprise; and then she ran hither and thither, seized this and that, upset an inkstandish, seized a porcelain bottle by its stopper, letting the other part fall and break; knocked down an elegant dressing-case, splitting off its pearl corners, and spilling all its contents; jumping up into one of the beautiful chairs and standing on it, snatched a statuette of Thalia from the mantel-piece, and calling it a doll-baby, declared she would make it a red petticoat, and give it the name of Dolly.</p>
               <p>All this was the work of a minute, for then Hero went and took her hand again, and said,</p>
               <p>"Come, Miss Seabright, all these pretty things are yours, but you must learn to handle them carefully, so as not to break and destroy them. Come, now, I have got to get you ready for breakfast. You are to eat breakfast with the General. Come, let me wash your face and comb your hair."</p>
               <p>"No indeed ain't you agoin' to wash my face and comb my hair. I've washed my own face and combed my own hair ever since I can remember, and I ain't agoin' to let anybody else do it now."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, you do it; and here is such a pretty blue dress of Prince's cloth, all trimmed with black braid; and here is a black silk apron and a nice lace tucker, and silk mits, and a tortoise-shell long comb to keep your curls back, and here is a pair of black morocco boots, see."</p>
               <p>"Oh, how beautiful!" exclaimed the child, admiringly, as she hastened with her ablutions.</p>
               <p>When Nettie was arrayed in her new dress, she scarcely permitted her maid to tie the last thing, or turn the last long ringlet behind the comb, before she sprang from under her hands and fled down stairs to "show godfather and granny how she looked dressed like a little lady."</p>
               <p>As Nettie sprang into the presence of her guardian, he arose and walked towards her, took her hand gently, and told her that little girls must walk, and not jump and skip through the rooms of a house. Then he led her into the breakfast room, where Miss Joe was already installed at the head of the table, attended by a "genteel" waiter. General Garnet seated his ward and took his own place. Hero now made her appearance and stood by her little mistress. But Nettie's eyes were wandering from the elegancies of the breakfast-table, with its damask table-cloth, fine napkins, Sevres China service, &amp;c., to the superb sideboard, with its splendid array of cut-glass and silver plate; and from the rich Turkey carpet to the wonderful paper hangings of the walls that showed the city of Paris by morning light. And Nettie's maid had several times to remind her that little ladies did not stare about, but ate their breakfast prettily, before she could withdraw her attention from the new glories around her, and fix it upon her breakfast.</p>
               <p>But before the meal was half over, Nettie had sprung up and bounded out of the room in search of more novelties. The hall, the library, and the picture-gallery, the parlour and the drawing-room, the saloon and the conservatory—all on the first floor—were in turn invaded and overhauled by the eager, impetuous child. Then all the chambers on the second floor were visited and ransacked. And then the indefatigable little explorer made for the attic, and besieged the doors of the locked-up rooms there. Through all these runnings and ramblings, Hero followed her, telling her that little ladies should not do this, or that, or the other.</p>
               <p>When night came, a little tired with her incessant running, and a little fretted and dispirited with the ceaseless accompaniment of her maid's tuitions and fault-finding, Nettie went into the library, where her guardian sat luxuriating in his easychair at a table covered with books and papers, before a fine fire.</p>
               <p>Nettie was too tired to notice the elegant and luxurious appointments of General Garnet's favourite retreat: the superb<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7856-00000033"/> book-cases at intervals along the walls; the rare and costly statues, busts, and oil-paintings; the tables laden with prints and articles of virtu; the easy-chairs, sofas, and foot-cushions; the deep, soft carpet, "stealing all noises from the feet;" the heavy damask curtains excluding all cold air, and the splendid chandeliers pendent from the ceiling, and diffusing through their stained glass shades a rich, warm, and glowing light throughout the apartment. Nettie sauntered straight up to General Garnet, climbed upon his knees, and threw her head and arms languidly upon his bosom.</p>
               <p>"Tired, my little Nettie?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, very tired, godfather, indeed. Take me in your arms and rock me back and forwards, as Hugh does."</p>
               <p>"You must forget Hugh and the Isle, and the lodge, and all your infantile life, little Nettie. You are going to be a young lady, and some day you may feel mortified if any one remind you of these things."</p>
               <p>"But I think it would be wicked to forget them, godfather, and indeed I won't forget them either," said Nettie, lifting herself from her resting-place.</p>
               <p>General Garnet saw his error. If he wished Nettie to forget her past life, companions, and occupations, <emph>he</emph> must never remind her of them. If <emph>she</emph> spoke of them, he must not keep her mind fixed upon the subject even by opposing it. He must draw her attention to something else. Reaching out his hand, drawing a book of coloured prints up before him, and opening it, he said,</p>
               <p>"You have a great deal of curiosity, little Nettle. Here are views taken on the Mediterranean; pictures of strange places and old cities, which I will tell you about. But as I do not wish to talk to a listless hearer, you must first tell me when you see a picture that interests you, and question me about anything that excites your curiosity, and then I shall know that I am speaking to an attentive pupil."</p>
               <p>Nettie kissed her guardian rapturously, and still sitting on his knees, bent forward and eagerly turned over the leaves of the folio, until a view on the coast of Greece arrested her attention, and pausing upon it, she caressed her guardian, and claimed the explanation. General Garnet was absorbed in the description and history of this plate, and Nettie was listening eagerly, when the front-door bell was heard to ring. General Garnet ceased talking, and raised his head and listened. Nettie pressed her lips to his and listened too. The library door opened; a servant entered, and announced,</p>
               <p>"Doctor Hardcastle!"</p>
               <p>"Show Doctor Hardcastle in," said General Garnet, gathering Nettie closely to his bosom with one arm, resting the other hand upon the table, and elevating his head and Roman nose to the loftiest angle of scorn. A minute passed, and then the door opened again, and Magnus Hardcastle, still clothed in his rough emigrant suit, entered the library, walked down its length, and stood face to face with General Garnet.</p>

               <p>THUS they stood:—</p>
               <p>General Garnet had arisen, and put Nettie from his bosom, but she stood upon the chair he had just vacated, with her arms around his neck, gazing at the new comer.</p>
               <p>Doctor Hardcastle stood, cap in hand, immediately before him.</p>
               <p>They looked at each other. The countenance of General Garnet was calm and impassible; he could <emph>afford</emph> to be calm; he had his revenge in his hands—<emph>in his arms!</emph> The countenance of Magnus was frank, open, eager as ever, yet tempered with a certain gravity and earnestness of expression.</p>
               <p>But a single instant they thus regarded each other, and then:—</p>
               <p>"Well, sir?" said General Garnet.</p>
               <p>Magnus held forth his hand, saying, seriously,</p>
               <p>"General Garnet, I have come a day's journey back from my Western road, to offer you my hand in amity, to say to you how kindly I feel, and must eyer feel, towards the father of my beloved wife—to say how much I desire your friendship—how much we all desire a reconciliation. Will you take my hand?" General Garnet drew himself up and remained silent. Nettie, with her arms still around his neck, gazed with interest at their visiter. Magnus dropped his hand, but continued, "Sir, I can understand the resentment of disappointed ambition. But I do not, and will not, believe such anger to be implacable; not now—not under the afflicting dispensation of your recent deplorable bereavement. General Garnet, I had proceeded a day and night upon my Westward journey, before I received a letter from Mr. Wilson, announcing the sudden death of Mrs. Garnet. My dear wife was overwhelmed with sorrow, a sorrow which I also deeply felt. She reproached herself bitterly with a thousand fancied sins against her lost mother, vowing in her remorse and despair what she would give, or do, could the grave but give up its dead. 'The grave is inexorable!' General Garnet, <emph>to some extent</emph> I have judged <emph>your</emph> heart by <emph>hers.</emph> The husband and the daughter have a common sorrow. The husband must have suffered as much as the daughter. General Garnet, can I venture to speak candidly to you? Can I venture to say that little as your Alice may have been loved or valued while she was still by your side, in your daily path, yet now that she has vanished from your sight, you miss her in a thousand endearing attentions—in a thousand gentle ministrations every moment of your life. You miss her in countless comforts, and nameless <emph>refinements</emph> of comfort, of which she, <emph>till lost,</emph> was the quiet, unsuspecting origin. And now you find out the cause by missing the effect!"</p>
               <p>"'How blessings brighten as they take their flight!'" said General Garnet, in a low, ironical tone, filling up the pause made by Magnus. But without observing the sneer, Doctor Hardcastle replied, gravely and sweetly,</p>
               <p>"<emph>Yes!</emph> 'We knew not that an Angel had been with us till we saw the glory of her <emph>vanishing wing!'</emph> In your deep heart was it not thus with <emph>you,</emph> General Garnet? Is it not so in a modified way with many of us? Oh, the loved and lost! we may have misapprehended, undervalued, misused them in life; but let the inexorable hand of Death be laid upon them, and how changed are all our feelings towards them! How remorsefully we appreciate their worth; how despairingly we love them! What would we not sacrifice to restore motion, warmth, consciousness to that still, cold heart, so we might press it beating to our bosom; to restore light to those folded<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7856-00000035"/> eyes, so we might gaze into them all the remorse, all the love we feel, but cannot speak; to restore life to the dead, that we might see them again at our fireside or table in the old, familiar dress, with the old, familiar look; that we might serve them soul and body, day and night; that we might be a saint or a slave to them thenceforth for ever! Take a closer case; take that of your Alice. Could now the doors of that vault where you laid her fly open and yield up its beautiful dead—or, to leave the supernatural and impossible out of the question, could Alice be found to have been laid there during a fit of epilepsy, as has sometimes been the case with others, and could she now be restored to you living, loving, would you not rejoice as you never rejoiced before—would you not love and value her as you never loved or valued her before—would you not do anything on earth to render her renewed life happy?" Magnus paused again to see the effect of this hint of the truth, thinking also, that in the event of General Garnet remaining obdurate, he had possibly verged too nearly upon a disclosure.</p>
               <p>But the stern, immovable countenance of the latter betrayed no emotion either of suspicion or of relenting. It positively gave no clue to his thoughts or feelings. Magnus hoped the best, yet withdrew from the precipice of a dangerous confidence, by saying,</p>
               <p>"But to leave <emph>improbable</emph> things also. Could you wake up in the morning and find that you had only <emph>dreamed</emph> her death, and see her by your side—living, beautiful, loving—would you not clasp her to your heart in joy, exclaiming, 'Oh, dearest wife, I have had such a dreadful dream! It seemed, too, so <emph>very real.</emph> I dreamed that you were <emph>dead,</emph> Alice. Thank God, it was nothing <emph>but</emph> a dream! Now, ask me what you will, Alice, for I am so happy to know I have you yet—to know that you have not gone from my side, but are here—<emph>here!</emph>—that I can refuse you nothing.' Would those not be your words and feelings? And what would Alice say—what would Alice ask? What was nearest her heart when she fell asleep? What would she say could she now be restored, and should you ask her what would make her happy, but, 'Father, be reconciled to your daughter!' General Garnet, the same letter that announced our sudden and mutual bereavement, the letter of that Christian minister, expressed a hope that the hand of Death, which had led our friend away from our midst, leaving us all in a common sorrow, might reunite <emph>our</emph> hands in amity. General Garnet, that hope is <emph>my</emph> prayer. I <emph>entreat</emph> you, take my hand!"</p>
               <p>General Garnet recoiled a step, and answered, scornfully,</p>
               <p>"Sir, I know you for an orator of old. But if you hope to work upon my feelings through the sorrow of my recent and very sudden loss, you deceive yourself. And now, hear me! <emph>Could</emph>—as you have put the question—<emph>could</emph> the doors of my wife's tomb fly open—and <emph>could</emph> she be restored to me, living, loving, in all the beauty and goodness of her being—<emph>could</emph> such impossibilities occur—and <emph>should</emph> the first boon she craved to bless her renewed life, be the reconciliation you desire, that boon would be refused, though that refusal should send her back into the grave! Now I hope you understand me thoroughly."</p>
               <p>Doctor Hardcastle nodded his head several times, keeping time to his thought, as he said, in his heart,</p>
               <p>"And little do you surmise, poor man, that your refusal <emph>will</emph> send her back to the grave—<emph>for you.</emph> That she <emph>will</emph> be indeed dead—<emph>to you!</emph>"</p>
               <p>General Garnet, taking this nod for one of assent, added,</p>
               <p>"And now, I hope, sir, that no more false hopes may be raised upon <emph>me.</emph> Neither you nor your wife need ever expect anything at my hands. By my fireside, and at my board, and in my heart, the place of the late Miss Garnet is filled. <emph>This</emph> little girl, sir, is my daughter and heiress. I have regularly and legally adopted her. The late Miss Garnet had, but for your reminder, passed from my memory. <emph>Mrs. Hardcastle</emph> is an alien and a stranger, and I desire that she remain such. I beg you also to remember, sir, that though I have a slight electioneering acquaintance with <emph>Doctor</emph> Hardcastle, such as every prominent politician may have with persons, not to be recognised under any other circumstances, I do not wish even that acquaintance to continue. And I beg you to recollect that I have never even <emph>seen Mrs.</emph> Hardcastle, and never wish to see her. I do not know the person, and never wish to know her. Have you any thing more to advance, Doctor Hardcastle?"</p>
               <p>"YES, SIR!" said Magnus, drawing himself up, and as his fine chest expanded, looking at his adversary, with a brow—a glance that made him quail and drop his eyes. "You have<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7856-00000036"/> dared to misrepresent my purpose in coming to you, or else you have <emph>naturally</emph> mistaken my motives—naturally—for it may not be in your nature to understand them. Yet no, it is not so. You do NOT mistake me. And do not DARE to affect it again. You KNOW that your fortune is nothing, absolutely nothing to me, and never was. So little do rank and fortune weigh with me against hearts and souls, that had I been a millionaire, and had Elsie been the child of a beggar instead of the daughter of General Garnet, and the heiress of Mount Calm, I would have taken her to my bosom in the face of all the world. And <emph>more, farther,</emph>—had Elsie possessed, in her own unalienable right, hundreds of millions, and I possessed no more than the clothes I wore, I would have married her, and not thanked her for the millions she brought me, but simply <emph>loved</emph> her for the beauty, the goodness, the love, the dear WOMANHOOD she gave me. So <emph>little</emph> do I value money where nature and affection are concerned. As it is, we are <emph>both</emph> poor, <emph>both</emph> will have to work hard. Elsie has chosen her lot in life, and shall abide by it. Even you, her father, shall not rescue her from it with your wealth. You cannot change her destiny. Your fortune could not do it. I am resolved to <emph>make,</emph> to <emph>command</emph> whatever success may be in life for us. Yet," he added, with a softening brow and tone, "yet, father of my dear wife—for her sake—for your own—for <emph>mine,</emph> I would be reconciled with you. Spite of all the bitter things written upon your forehead, and spoken by your lips, and which I do not think your <emph>heart</emph> endorses, I would be at peace with you; bitter talk is but hasty breath. Let us forget it. Let us be friends. Now, then, for the last time, I offer you my hand. For the <emph>last</emph> time, I beseech you take it."</p>
               <p>General Garnet frowned darkly, and averted his head.</p>
               <p>But Nettie, who had been gazing kindly and admiringly at the speaker, now suddenly thrust out her little hand, and emphatically striking it into the broad, open palm of Magnus, exclaimed, cordially,</p>
               <p>"Yes! Let us be friends. <emph>I'll</emph> be friends. I like you."</p>
               <p>There was no resisting that sparkling, cordial smile—that earnest, confiding manner, and Magnus closed his hand upon the child's hand, pressing it kindly.</p>
               <p>"Godfather, why don't you ask the good-looking gentleman to sit down, and why don't you ring the bell and have wine brought for him like you did for Mr. Judge Jacky? Sit down, gentleman, in that arm-chair, and <emph>I</emph> will go and ring the bell;" she said, jumping down, and running to the bellrope, which she pulled vigorously.</p>
               <p>"Will you be seated, sir?" said General Garnet, ironically.</p>
               <p>"Will you first take my hand, General Garnet?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>No, sir! To forbear</emph> is the utmost limit of my self-control. I cannot go farther, and <emph>forgive.</emph> Yet you are in my house—standing by my fireside. While you bestow upon us your presence, I beg you be seated."</p>
               <p>Magnus waved his hand in rejection of this invitation, and turned to go, but Nettie, returning from her vociferous bell-ringing, stopped him by seizing both his hands and leaning up against him as she exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"No! you <emph>mustn't</emph> go till you get something—I hear a boy coming now."</p>
               <p>And at this moment, indeed, the door was opened, and a waiter appeared, in answer to the noisy summons.</p>
               <p>"Get some good wine and some sort o' witches—you make with bread and butter and ham—<emph>sandwitches,</emph> and bring up here for this gentleman. And make haste, you hear, because he is in a hurry," said Nettie to the waiter.</p>
               <p>The man looked with surprise and perplexity from the self-constituted little mistress to the master. And General Garnet, in some perversity of mood, exclaimed, fiercely,</p>
               <p>"<emph>Well, sir!</emph> Why do you pause? did you hear Miss Seabright's order?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, but—"</p>
               <p>"Go and obey it, then. Do you wait for me to tell you that her commands here are only second to my own?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, why don't you go along when I tell you that the good-looking gentleman is in a great hurry? What makes you look so queer?" exclaimed Nettie, stamping with impatience, but not with ill-humour.</p>
               <p>The man bowed and withdrew.</p>
               <p>Again Doctor Hardcastle sought to free himself from his loving little captor, but Nettie clung to him like a very nettle, or an opossum to a tree, exclaiming,</p>
               <p>"No, sir, you mustn't go; <emph>you shan't go,</emph> till the wine comes."</p>
               <p>And before he could get away, the wine and sandwiches arrived<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7856-00000037"/> rived. As the waiter walked straight up the room and set the refreshments upon the table, General Garnet turned coldly to Doctor Hardcastle, saying,</p>
               <p>"My little daughter invites you to take something. Will you do so, sir?"</p>
               <p>Doctor Hardcastle, who had been released by Nettie, declined the invitation, and retired—followed into the hall by Nettie, who sought to recapture and detain him. He raised the child, kissed her, and left the house.</p>
               <p>After he had gone, Nettie remained standing in the hall so long, that General Garnet came out to seek her. Having found her, he exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Why do you linger so, my little Nettie? Come with me into the library, and let us go on with the pictures and stories."</p>
               <p>"I don't want to go back to the library with you, godfather."</p>
               <p>"What! don't want to return with me and see the beautiful pictures, and hear the wonderful stories?"</p>
               <p>"No, I don't care for the pictures, nor the stories, nor you <emph>either,</emph> godfather. I want to go to my own room—and I wish you would call my maid."</p>
               <p>"Whe-ew! how my little princess takes state upon herself! But I must say it becomes her—rarely. But why does she not care for pictures, stories, or godfather <emph>either?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Because, godfather, you treated the pleasant-spoken gentleman so meanly. I'm sure when I and Hugh, and granny, lived in the poor lodge, and had nothing to offer but persimmon beer and sour, knobby apples, we never treated <emph>our</emph> visiters so meanly. No, <emph>that</emph> we didn't. Granny used to say 'Hospit—something or other, before everything,' which meant that it was a shame to treat well-behaved company meanly. And you treated the pleasant-spoken gentleman meanly. 'Deed I thought he preached nice as the parson. But you treated him meanly—and I <emph>don't want to</emph> have anything to do with you, and I <emph>won't either</emph> have anything to do with you, godfather. I want my maid. Will you please to send her to me?"</p>
               <p>Piqued, amused, attracted by the naive candour and courage of the fond but passionate child, General Garnet laughed and held out his arms, saying,</p>
               <p>"Oh, come to me, my little Nettie. Come and kiss me, and give me one of your tight hugs."</p>
               <p>"'Deed I won't, godfather!"</p>
               <p>"Won't! Why?"</p>
               <p>"'Cause I don't <emph>feel</emph> like it, one bit."</p>
               <p>"Don't feel like it! Well, then, now what shall I give my little Nettle for a good hearty hug and kiss—say? Shall it be a pony, or a little carriage, or a great wax doll, or what? Come, say now. What shall it be?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, godfather. You will give me all <emph>them</emph> things, anyhow, 'cause you promised them to me if I'd come and live 'long o' you. But I ain't sure that I will take any of them—and I ain't even sure that I shall stay."</p>
               <p>General Garnet laughed aloud, and said,</p>
               <p>"Very well! if you won't come and give me a good hearty hug and kiss, neither for free love nor bribery, I can come and give you one;" and he went toward her.</p>
               <p>Nettie ran, <emph>flew</emph> up the stairs, and from the first landing looked down to see if she was pursued, and said,</p>
               <p>"No you mustn't, indeed, godfather. I had rather any one hit me a hard lick right in the face, than kiss me when I don't want to be kissed. And I don't want to be kissed by <emph>you,</emph> godfather. I wouldn't kiss you hardly to save your life."</p>
               <p>And having said this, Nettie fled the rest of the way up stairs. Hero was already there with a light, to take charge of her.</p>
               <p>"Strange! <emph>how</emph> strange it is, that I love that wild child more and more—need her love more and more every hour that I live! Strange, passing strange, that with all her wilfulness, I love that half-savage, but most beautiful thing, better than I ever loved any one in the wide world! Oh, it is not strange, after all! It is because she loves <emph>me</emph> thoroughly—with every fibre of her soul and body; because I can trust in her, for she hides nothing from me—not even her childish anger."</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Doctor Hardcastle returned to Huttontown, and to the tavern where he was to lodge that night. He intended to retire early, preparatory to a very early start the next morning. But first it was necessary to go to Mr. Fig's, for the purpose of making a few purchases of articles that had been forgotten in his first packing up.</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7856-00000038"/>
               <p>When he entered the grocery, he saw, to his surprise, Hugh Hutton behind the counter, ready to serve him.</p>
               <p>"Well, my boy," said he, extending his hand, "I am surprised and happy to see you again."</p>
               <p>"Oh, doctor! have you really turned back? I am so very glad!" exclaimed Hugh, his countenance actually illuminated with joy.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my boy. We had proceeded but a day's journey, when we heard of Mrs. Garnet's death, and came back."</p>
               <p>"Where is Mrs. Hardcastle? Is she at the inn?"</p>
               <p>"No, my boy; finding that we came too late for the funeral, I took Mrs. Hardcastle immediately back to Deep Dell, where she now sojourns, waiting for me. I found it necessary to come back a second time. I have travelled the road between Huttontown and Deep Dell forth and back twice within a week, Hugh; and, to-morrow morning, at five o'clock, I make the third start."</p>
               <p>"The old folks say that there is great luck in the third attempt," said Hugh.</p>
               <p>"I should think there was in my instance, if I could take you back with me, my boy."</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, Doctor Hardcastle, you can if you will," exclaimed Hugh, in a tone of anxious, eager solicitude.</p>
               <p>"I assuredly <emph>will,</emph> if I <emph>can.</emph> And no obstacle exists with <emph>me.</emph> But your little sister, my boy?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, my little sister is better provided for than I could hope to provide for her for many years to come. She is the ward of General Garnet, and he has just this morning taken her home to live with him, and to be educated."</p>
               <p>"How? What? Is it possible? The little, fond, wild, beautiful creature I saw at Mount Calm, to-night?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, that was she, Garnet Seabright."</p>
               <p>"What kin is she to you, boy?—<emph>not your sister?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No kin at all, sir; but dear to me as if she were my <emph>twin sister.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"A beautiful child! A sweet, wild, haunting thing!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, sir; and so true and good!—<emph>so trusting!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"A little eyrie, sprite-like thing! What a pity!" said Doctor Hardcastle, communing with himself; then, raising his voice, he said, "Well, you desire to accompany me, my boy? —but how long have you been with Mr. Fig, and what are your obligations to him?"</p>
               <p>"No obligations at all, sir. The truth is, seeing that from having been a help to aunty and Nettie in the time of their need, I had got to be a hindrance in the way of their doing better than I could do for them, I went to Mr. Fig, and told him that I would stand behind the counter, and help about the store, for no more than my mere board—not even asking clothing—on conditions, it should be understood, I was to go to the West the very first chance that came. Well, Mr. Fig knew me, and how much I could do, and agreed to my plan; and so I came this morning, and have done a very hard day's work, too,—hauling several cartloads of freight from the brig up to the store, and unloading them, and storing them in, and waiting behind the counter the rest of the time. All that makes me feel well to-night. So, you see, sir, I owe Mr. Fig nothing but good friendship; and I am ready to set out with you to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Be it so, then, my boy. And I am rejoiced to know that in thus following the bent of your inclinations, you abandon no duty. Will you join me to-night, or early to-morrow morning?"</p>
               <p>"Early to-morrow morning, Doctor Hardcastle. You may pick me up at the south gate of the falling-field, behind Mount Calm—that will be directly in your road. I must go up to Mount Calm, to-night, to bid good-bye to Aunt Joe and Nettie."</p>
               <p>"Very well, my boy. Be punctual."</p>
               <p>And having obtained the articles for which he came, Doctor Hardcastle left the store.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>That night Hugh Hutton went up to Mount Calm. He succeeded in obtaining entrance to his Aunt Joe's rooms, but found, to his regret, that Nettie had some time before retired to bed, and was now fast asleep. He spent the night on a pallet in his aunt's room, and in the morning made up his bundle to start. Miss Joe objected, cried, bemoaned her fate and Hugh's, but finally consented to his departure; for Miss Joe believed in Hugh, and had faith in Doctor Hardcastle;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7856-00000039"/> besides, it would not sound so badly to tell the neighbours, by and bye, that her nephew, Hugh Hutton, was "studying medicine underneath Doctor Hardcastle." So Miss Joe gave him her blessing, and went to wake up Nettie, to bid him farewell, prophesying all the while that Nettie would "take on dreadful." But Nettie <emph>did not</emph> "take on" at all; she threw herself joyously around Hugh's neck, gave him a hearty hug and kiss, and declared, that with his bundle across his shoulder, he was Jack the Giant-Killer, going to seek his fortune; and that he must let her know about every giant he killed, and every enchanted lady he freed, and every magician's castle he took, and every beautiful princess that loved him. And then she pulled the scarlet worsted comforter from her neck, and wound it around Hugh's throat, tucking the ends into his coat breast, and bid him good-bye. Hugh went to the door, turned to take a last look, impulsively darted back, clasped his old aunty, and then Nettie, in a last embrace, sprung from the room, and was gone. A rapid walk brought him to the spot where he found Doctor Hardcastle, just arrived in his carryall, waiting for him, and exclaiming—</p>
               <p>"Just in time, my boy—and very welcome. Jump in! All right!"</p>

               <p>THE place selected by Magnus Hardcastle as the field of his life labour, was that grandly picturesque portion of Maryland, now known as Alleghany County, but then called indifferently the Mountains, the Wilderness, or the Back-woods. The site chosen for his home was a wildly beautiful spot in the midst of a deep, narrow valley, lying between two ridges of the Alleghany Mountains, and watered by a branch of the Potomac River. Although Magnus Hardcastle's first idea of a home in the back-woods presented nothing but a log cabin, and although his young and lovely bride was quite ready to dare and share the unmitigated rudenesses and privations of such a home and life, yet Providence, who "tempereth the wind to the shorn lamb," mercifully ameliorated the hardships of the condition for the delicately nurtured girl, who, however willing, was, notwithstanding all her health and strength, scarcely able to bear the shock of such a sharp and sudden change. The contents of that casket—the bridal gift of Alice Garnet to her daughter—amounted to nearly five thousand dollars, and though the whole of this sum would go but a very little way towards supplying the superfluities of a fashionable<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7856-00000040"/> bride's trousseau, yet the half of it went very far towards completing and furnishing a comfortable back-woods home for our young couple. Their house was a log cabin indeed, but one of "ample size," and commodious appointments.</p>
               <p>It was near the close of a fine winter day, that Alice and Elsie were together in the family-room of the cabin. This apartment was large, and supplied with all needful furniture. The walls were lathed and plastered, but not whitewashed, and, retaining the original stone colour, gave a soberer tone to the air of the room. There was no carpet on the floor, but the broad hearth was a notable specimen of the fine arts, by Hugh Hutton, who declared, in his pride, that it was an interesting, instructive, and endless study, to any one fond of tracing the individuality, and infinite variety of natural form and colour. The hearth was, in fact, a fine mosaic of fragments of rocks, of divers forms, sizes, and colours, perfectly filled in, levelled, and chinked with a hard, white composition, that formed an irregular boundary line between the pieces. Each side the ample fire-place were dressers, constructed of strong plank, and at once laden and ornamented with crockery ware. From the lowest and broadest shelves hung dark calico curtains, reaching to the floor, and concealing "the humble little household gods," as Elsie called them. There were chairs and tables made more for strength than beauty, ranged along the walls. The windows were curtained with dark calico. There was no article of luxury, no superfluity in the room; but everything was convenient, orderly, and immaculately clean.</p>
               <p>A fine fire blazed in the broad chimney, and though the hour was growing dark, it illuminated the room, so as to render a lighted candle unnecessary. The tea-kettle hung over the blaze, an oven lid sat upon the logs by its side, and the oven was turned up against the front of the fire to heat for baking.</p>
               <p>Elsie stood at a deal-table, making out biscuits—busy, healthful, and happy as ever.</p>
               <p>A little to the left of the blazing, too-hot fire, sat Alice, in a rocking-chair, and—a revery. There was but one change in Alice since we saw her last. The sunny ringlets of her unfaded hair (be it remembered that she was but thirty-five), the sunny ringlets of her hair were turned around her cheek, and their ends twisted around with her back braid. A little lace cap which she wore, because she said a cap was proper for her at her time of life, and in her relations, sat gracefully upon her still beautiful head, and gave a softness to the outline of her delicate and spiritual face, making her seem even more youthful and beautiful than before. She had been embroidering an infant's dress, but the work had dropped into her lap, and her hand had fallen upon the little snow-white heap of muslin, and the richly chased gold thimble glittered idly in the fire-light—but the tiny foot, in the delicate slipper, was not idle—it turned upon the rockers of a cradle, where, amid downy pillows and soft white drapery, reposed a lovely babe of about two months of age. Altogether this beautiful and graceful group was a little out of keeping with the log cabin, to which it nevertheless lent a charm. But then, Elsie had always laughingly said that her mother was an ingrain "lady," while she herself, for her own part, was "only a woman."</p>
               <p>Elsie having finished making out her biscuits, brought the tray to the fire to put them on to bake. While kneeling with one knee upon the hearth to arrange her bread in the oven, she looked up at her mother's pensive face, and said, sympathetically,</p>
               <p>"Dear mother, it seems to me you are not happy, though you would have us believe it is so?"</p>
               <p>"Elsie, no one is perfectly happy; that is a saying as old as the plucking of the forbidden fruit that first brought suffering into the world, and yet we never believe it. We are ever striving for that perfect happiness which is impossible."</p>
               <p>"I do not believe it to be impossible, dear mother. I am a firm believer in perfect earthly happiness; I am so near it myself. Why, even <emph>now,</emph> I should be perfectly happy but for the shadow on <emph>your</emph> brow, mother."</p>
               <p>"'But,' there is ever a <emph>but.</emph> It is the order of life, and I am content with it. Be at ease, dear; I, <emph>too,</emph> should be perfectly happy, <emph>but</emph>—"</p>
               <p>"<emph>What,</emph> dearest mother?"</p>
               <p>"I am a living falsehood, Elsie."</p>
               <p>"Mother!"</p>
               <p>"Child, I did not mean to speak so strongly. But I have<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7856-00000041"/> a secret to keep that pains me always—a sinful secret, inasmuch as I am conscious that the keeping of it may cause sin in others."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Sin,</emph> mother?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Elsie; your father is in the prime of life; he believes himself to be a widower. What if he were to marry again?"</p>
               <p>"Ha! I never thought of that. It seems so <emph>strange</emph> to me that people should <emph>ever</emph> marry again."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>know</emph> it does, my happy Elsie; but, nevertheless, they do, you know. Elsie, I have refrained from speaking of my thought, because I did not wish to distress you or have an argument with your husband; but, my love, I feel that I ought to write to General Garnet, and after that, as you and yours are doing so very well, and as you are all so comfortable and happy, and as I should not be missed among you, I think, if General Garnet wishes it, I ought to go home."</p>
               <p>"He will not wish it, mother; you know he has a gentlemanly horror of a nine days' wonder. Sweet mother, you must remain with us. Not <emph>miss</emph> you, whom should we have to wait upon and adore if you were gone? And as for <emph>writing,</emph> mother, talk to Magnus about that. Here he comes now, and Hugh with him, as usual, and—a <emph>stranger</emph> with him, as unusual. Who can it be?" said Elsie, as, setting the lid upon the oven and replacing the tray upon the table, she looked out of the window into the moonlit yard.</p>
               <p>The door opened, and Magnus Hardcastle entered, accompanied by a gentleman, and followed by Hugh Hutton. The stranger was clothed in a suit of rusty black, his tall, slim figure was slightly bowed, and his black hair was thickly mixed with gray.</p>
               <p>"Come in, sir; come in, sir. Hugh, my student, there, will care for your horse. Come in, sir. It is needless to say that you are most gladly welcome. A guest is a God-send to <emph>us.</emph> Come to the fire, sir," said Doctor Hardcastle, leading the way.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Garnet, let me present to you the Reverend Mr. Sinclair, Missionary to the Winnebagoes, who will do us the honour of resting in our cabin for a few days, on his western route. Mr. Sinclair, Mrs. Garnet, of Mount Calm."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible! <emph>Alice!</emph>" ejaculated the stranger, dropping hat, gloves, and whip, and reeling on his feet.</p>
               <p>A slight paleness overspread the face of the lady, but rising with perfect ease, she offered her hand, saying,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Sinclair, it is many years since we last met. I am very glad to see you."</p>
               <p>He drew back, then took the hand she offered, and looked wonderingly, searchingly, into her face, as if to read her soul. Her face was impassible to him. Turning to Doctor Hardcastle, she said,</p>
               <p>"My dear Magnus, this is a very old acquaintance you have brought me, an acquaintance of my girlhood. Elsie, my love!"</p>
               <p>Elsie came forward.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Sinclair," she continued, still retaining his hand, "let me introduce you to my daughter, Mrs. Hardcastle. Elsie, my love, Mr. Sinclair is a very old friend of mine."</p>
               <p>"I am <emph>very</emph> glad to see you, sir. I should be glad even if you were a perfect stranger, but I am <emph>very</emph> glad to see an old friend of my mother's. Do take this chair between mother and the chimney corner, sir; it is not the post of honour, perhaps, but it is the most comfortable and convenient seat, as you can rest and toast your feet and talk over old times with mother at the same time—old times, I said. She does not look like she had seen any <emph>very</emph> old times, does she, sir?" said Elsie, gayly talking on, while she shook the hand of the guest and installed him in his seat.</p>
               <p>"Mamma—'Mrs. Garnet of Mount Calm'—pray take the entertainment of Mr. Sinclair upon yourself, while I attend to that for which I have the most talent—I mean the <emph>creature comforts.</emph> Don't tell him, mamma, that if ever I lose my soul through either of the three great enemies of souls, 'the world, the flesh, and the devil,' it will be by the flesh, for that I have very little of worldliness, not a whit of diabolism, but a grand passion for creature comforts," said Elsie, laughing, as she raised the lid off of the oven. "These biscuits are going to be very nice," she remarked, as the steam of the fresh warm bread greeted their nostrils. She then replaced the lid, perceived and picked up the fallen hat, gloves, and whip of the minister, looked at him as the most careless and slovenly man<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7856-00000042"/> she ever saw in her life, brushed and put away the things, and hurried on with her preparations for supper.</p>
               <p>"And is <emph>this</emph> the residence of the wealthy and distinguished General Garnet's widow and daughter?" said Sinclair, in a deep, stern tone, looking around upon the rough walls.</p>
               <p>"It is the home of General Garnet's daughter, certainly, and the temporary home of his wife."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Ah!</emph> I beg your pardon, earnestly—yet—the mistake was <emph>very</emph> natural," said the minister.</p>
               <p>"Hugh, attend to that gentleman's animal in the very best manner. Dear Magnus, please to get me some more wood. Hugh, take the bucket, and as you come back, bring me a bucket of water. Dear Magnus, we must not forget to request the minister to christen our baby. It may be a long time before we have another opportunity, and anyhow, I prefer Mr. Sinclair to officiate; it will be so interesting, he being mother's old friend," said Elsie, as she hurried about, speaking to first one and then another, attending to everything and forgetting nothing. Supper was speedily placed upon the table—tea, fresh butter and eggs, venison, and the nice biscuits. The minister asked a blessing, but ate little. And soon after they arose from the table, Mr. Sinclair pleaded fatigue, and requested to be shown to his room.</p>
               <p>Doctor Hardcastle attended him to his chamber.</p>
               <p>When Magnus returned to the family-room, he found the tea things had been already washed up and put away, the hearth swept, the fire replenished, and the two ladies with their needlework, and Hugh with his books, all gathered around the table that was lighted by but one tallow candle. He drew a chair up with the rest, and putting his hand in his pocket, said,</p>
               <p>"I have got a letter from Huttontown."</p>
               <p>"A letter from Huttontown!" exclaimed all three, looking eagerly up.</p>
               <p>"Yes, from Mr. Wilson."</p>
               <p>"What's the news? How is father?" asked Elsie.</p>
               <p>"Does he speak of the General? How is he?" inquired Alice, anxiously.</p>
               <p>"How are <emph>all</emph> the folks? How is Aunt Joe and Nettie?" asked Hugh Hutton. All were speaking together, and all eagerly awaiting an answer.</p>
               <p>"Peste, ladies and young gentleman, I cannot answer all at once," said Magnus, smiling, yet with something constrained in his manner. "I will read the letter; it is very short; a mere note—a mere matter of business."</p>
               <p>"Well?" said Alice, seeing him pause.</p>
               <p>"A mere announcement, in truth—a—but I will read it. Hugh, you're discreet?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"Elsie, my dear, I have been anxious to submit this letter to your mother and yourself all the evening."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, Magnus. My mother is on thorns, and I am scarcely more at ease. Has anything happened? You look 'perplexed, yet not in despair'—not like the recipient of very ill news."</p>
               <p>"Why no, not of ill news, yet strange news; perplexing news. You know before I came away from Huttontown the last time, I requested the Reverend Mr. Wilson to inform me immediately by letter of anything important that might occur at Mount Calm, and concern us."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes. Well?"</p>
               <p>"He has done so. Here is his letter—listen."</p>

                           <p>Dear Doctor Hardcastle—At our last interview, you desired me, in the event of General Garnet's contemplating any second matrimonial engagement, to inform you, by letter, without delay, saying that it virtually concerned the welfare of all parties that this should instantly be done. Without having the most remote idea of the cause of your very emphatic instructions, I hasten to obey them, by advising you that General Garnet and Miss Wylie, of Point Pleasant, are to be married on Tuesday next. Nothing is talked of but the match and the great preparations making for the wedding at Point Pleasant, and for the reception of the bride at Mount Calm. The family of the lady seem very well pleased with the match. Ulysses Roebuck, the jilted lover, has gone—sailed for Europe, with the purpose of making the grand tour.</p>
                           <p>There, you have the facts that most interest you. There is nothing else stirring; all the same dull, dead level; a<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7856-00000043"/> birth, death, or marriage, would be an historical event in this village.</p>

               <p>"Good Heaven! <emph>There,</emph> what did I tell you, Elsie!" exclaimed Alice, clasping her hands.</p>
               <p>"My dear mother! my darling mother! never mind. There is one love on earth that shall never fail you. I can have no second mother," said Elsie, rising and throwing her arms around the lady's neck.</p>
               <p>"Magnus, you see that I must go. I must write to-night, to prepare him for my arrival, and to-morrow I must set out myself."</p>
               <p>"Oh, <emph>no,</emph> mother; <emph>don't go!</emph> It will be worse than ever now in your old home. Oh, mamma, <emph>don't</emph> go! <emph>Write—</emph> only write. Or if it be indispensable that <emph>some</emph> one go, <emph>Magnus</emph> will. Will you not, Magnus?"</p>
               <p>"I will do whatever your mother wishes."</p>
               <p>"Then, dearest Magnus, mail my letter to-night, even late as it is, and prepare to set out with me to-morrow. Yet, no; you must not leave Elsie. Prepare me a way to go alone."</p>
               <p>"Dear Mrs. Garnet, dear friend, I implore you not to think of going. I will go myself."</p>
               <p>"Magnus, dear, you know that upon some points I can be stubborn. I <emph>must go straight to Mount Calm,</emph>" said Alice.</p>
               <p>And despite all arguments and entreaties, she persisted in her resolution.</p>
               <p>"Then, since you <emph>will</emph> go, I shall attend you to the end of your journey, and—bring you <emph>back—</emph> perhaps."</p>
               <p>"But, Elsie; you can not leave her alone and unprotected at home."</p>
               <p>"She will not be alone; Hugh will be with her; and for protection, my brave wife can protect herself, if necessary. Pooh! my dear madam, I would leave Elsie here in the heart of the wilderness, six months, if needful, without fear or hesitation. She is one in a million, our Elsie. What say you, dear Elsie?"</p>
               <p>"I say—go with mother if you love me, Magnus. See her safe to her journey's end, and, if it be possible, bring her safe <emph>back</emph> to me again."</p>
               <p>That same night Alice's letter was written and mailed.</p>
               <p>The next morning at an early hour, Alice Garnet set out, under the protection of Doctor Hardcastle, for the East.</p>
               <p>An hour later, when the Reverend Mr. Sinclair arose and came down to breakfast, Mrs. Hardcastle tendered him the compliments and excuses of his host, informing him that a domestic affair of vital moment called Mrs. Garnet suddenly to Mount Calm, whither Doctor Hardcastle was instantly obliged to attend her.</p>
               <p>After breakfast the minister, leaving his respects and adieus for the absentees, took leave and proceeded on his journey.</p>

               <p>IT was two days before the appointed wedding day, and General Garnet sat in his library, over his wine, in deep consultation with his lawyer.</p>
               <p>"And, you say, sir, that my will might be <emph>successfully</emph> contested?" he asked, setting down his empty glass, and looking anxiously, half angrily, at the attorney.</p>
               <p>"I give it, sir, as my best digested legal opinion, that in the event of your death, should the will by which you bequeath all this vast property to your adopted daughter, be contested, it would probably be set aside in favour of Alice Chester Hardcastle, the only living representative of the old Chester family, who have held the land from the first settlement of the country to the present time—upwards of two hundred years. You know, sir, that the decision of the case would rest finally with the jury, and such are the prejudices in favour of wealth, rank, hereditary descent, and—"</p>
               <p>"Well! speak out—<emph>justice,</emph> you would add, I suppose," said General Garnet, filling his glass, and passing the bottle.</p>
               <p>The lawyer bowed.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir! what <emph>of</emph> these prejudices?—finish your sentence."</p>
               <p>"That scarce a jury could be found to give a verdict against your <emph>legal</emph> daughter—a Chester—and in favour of your—,—I beg your pardon—<emph>adopted</emph> daughter—a stranger and an alien."</p>
               <p>"Sir, you know nothing of the law. I shall seek better legal advice," exclaimed General Garnet, bringing down his glass upon the table with a force that shivered it, and rising in an excited manner.</p>
               <p>"You may seek <emph>other,</emph> and find more <emph>palatable</emph> advice, sir. <emph>Our</emph> consultation ends here. I wish you good-evening, sir," said the lawyer, rising, and going to the door.</p>
               <p>"Stay!" said General Garnet, going after him.</p>
               <p>But the attorney bowed deeply, and retired.</p>
               <p>General Garnet continued to pace up and down the floor, with a strange, excited manner, totally at variance with his usual serene self-possession. Frequently, also, he stopped—poured out, and quaffed a glass of wine. At last, pausing, he struck his forehead, emphatically exclaiming—</p>
               <p>"I have it, now!—<emph>a deed!</emph> To-morrow morning, the first thing I do will be to have drawn up, sign, seal and record <emph>a deed of conveyance,</emph> giving the whole of this estate to Garnet Seabright, and retaining only a life interest in it myself. Yes! <emph>a deed!</emph> There will be no contesting or setting aside <emph>that,</emph> I fancy. And whether I die next year, or a hundred years hence, Nettie, if she lives, becomes possessed of all this property. Yes! yes! I <emph>must</emph> revenge myself upon Hardcastle. I <emph>must</emph> punish that ungrateful daughter—true scion of the stubborn Chesters. And by all means, by <emph>any</emph> means—I <emph>must</emph>—WILL!—elevate and aggrandize Nettie—my child, my darling, my darling, the only thing on earth that loves me, Yes! elevate and aggrandize her until I FORCE the world to recognise her. Nettie, my heart's core!—whose thought has power to banish even the image of my young bride from my mind!—to banish it, because fair and lovely and loving as she is—<emph>her</emph> fantastical and selfish passion, flattering as it is—is a more selfish thing than your sweet, frank affection, my darling child. Yet she <emph>is</emph> beautiful, this fervid Ambrosia! And once this business settled—this deed that secures wealth and rank to my Nettie, executed and recorded, I shall be free to yield up soul and senses to this dream of passion. How my thoughts wander! I am giddy. I am not well. When ever did I talk to myself before? I must stop this. I will consult a physician to-morrow," said General Garnet, sitting down, and drinking great draughts of wine.</p>
               <p>The next day, true to his purpose, he rode to Huttontown,<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7856-00000045"/> and had the deed of conveyance, giving all the great Mount Calm property to Garnet Seabright, and reserving only a lifeinterest in it himself, drawn up, signed, and witnessed with all legal formula. Then he rode with it himself to the county town, and had it recorded. In the course of the day the slight indications of approaching illness that had visited him the night before, returned, and now, with more marked emphasis. Sudden vertigo, with failure of sight and confusion of thought, would seize him an instant, pass away—return again, and again pass. He drew up his horse at last before a doctor's office, entered, sat down, and apologizing for troubling the physician with such a trifling indisposition, by saying jestingly, that he wished to be in <emph>perfect</emph> health upon his wedding-day—he related his symptoms.</p>
               <p>"It is nothing, sir," said the physician, after he had felt his pulse, &amp;c. "It is nothing. Do not be alarmed, I beseech you! Keep a calm mind; it is of vital importance that you keep <emph>a calm mind.</emph> I would advise you to defer your marriage for a few weeks."</p>
               <p>"Do you think, sir, that I am threatened with—"</p>
               <p>"No, sir! Oh, no, there is not the least occasion for alarm; these symptoms must yield to a very little judicious treatment. Abstain from the use of wine and stimulating food, and above all things, <emph>avoid all agitation and excitement, keep from all places and persons that have the least effect upon your nerves.</emph> A day or so will set you up again. Stay, I will write you a little prescription. Here, sir, take this—it is simply a cooling draught—follow my directions, and all will be right."</p>
               <p>General Garnet took the scrap of paper, bowed, and withdrew, with a contemptuous smile upon his lips, muttering to himself,</p>
               <p>"Fool that I am, to seek medical advice of a fellow whose interest it is to make and keep me ill for a month or so! Shall I take this prescription, now? No, I feel better already. The fresh air has revived me. I will go to Point Pleasant and spend the evening with Ambrosia; her sweet smile and gentle touch will charm this fitful illness."</p>
               <p>And turning his horse's head, General Garnet took the road to Judge Wylie's. The sky was clouding up, but heedless of the threatened rain, he rode on rapidly to Point Pleasant. He spent a long, delightful evening with Miss Wylie, and left, at a late hour, more intoxicated than ever with the alluring beauty of his promised bride, and repeating, in an impassioned tone, many times, the words of his parting: "To-morrow! oh, <emph>tomorrow,</emph> Ambrosia."</p>
               <p>He faced a cold and driving rain all the way home, and arrived at his own gate, dripping wet.</p>
               <p>Throwing the reins of his horse to an attendant, he hastened into the house. The voice of Nettie greeted him.</p>
               <p>"Here, godfather! come in here to the library; here is a good fire, and your dressing-gown and slippers all warm, and hot coffee and oysters and wine. I made them for you."</p>
               <p>Divesting himself of his wet overcoat, cap, leggings and gloves, he walked into the library, where he found Nettie presiding over the comforts she had prepared for him.</p>
               <p>"My dear little brownie! Why are you up so late?"</p>
               <p>"The rain waked me up, godfather, and then I couldn't sleep any more for thinking you were out in it. So I got up and dressed myself, and came down here to make things comfortable for you."</p>
               <p>"My own Nettie! <emph>I</emph> have been making things comfortable for <emph>you,</emph> also! But where is your granny?"</p>
               <p>"Gone to bed these two hours."</p>
               <p>"And now <emph>you</emph> must go, my dear little one. Come and kiss me close, and then, good-night."</p>
               <p>The elf sprang to his neck, squeezing him tightly, and rooting herself into his bosom, as though she would grow there, and then suddenly springing off, bounded from the room.</p>
               <p>The little supper standing before him did not tempt his appetite. With another retrospective glance of contempt at the physician's advice, he turned to the table and poured out and swallowed glass after glass of wine. Then, without heeding the mail-bag that hung upon the chair, or ringing for a servant to clear off the things, or even closing up the house as was his invariable custom, he arose and retired to his chamber.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>At this same hour, on the turnpike road, about six miles distant from Mount Calm, plunged on through darkness, mire and driving rain, a one-horse chaise, occupied by two travellers—Doctor Hardcastle and Mrs. Garnet. They travelled on in perfect silence for two hours, before reaching the grounds of<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7856-00000046"/> Mount Calm. But, upon passing the outer gate and entering upon the premises, Alice became nervous and uneasy, and at length she asked,</p>
               <p>"Magnus, do you feel positively assured that he has received my letter, that he is prepared and expecting to see me?"</p>
               <p>"Without a doubt, dear Mrs. Garnet, he got your letter today at noon; assuredly, late as it is, he must be now expecting us."</p>
               <p>"I wonder if he really <emph>does.</emph> I wonder if he has spread the news among the people of the plantation! It is really necessary to know, dear Magnus. Else my sudden and unexpected apparition among them will cause a general alarm, and rouse the neighbourhood."</p>
               <p>"Very true, and at the first quarter I come to, I will alight and find out."</p>
               <p>They rode on in silence until they came to a solitary quarter on the outskirts of the plantation. Then Doctor Hardcastle alighting, gave the reins to Mrs. Garnet, and trudged through the deep mud and pelting rain, to the cabin from whence a faint light issued, and the low, sweet sound of a violin was heard. He rapped smartly with the handle of his riding whip. The music ceased, and a voice, which he recognised as belonging to Bob, the driver, called out from within,</p>
               <p>"Hoo dar! rappin' at my door dis onseasonable hour o' de night?"</p>
               <p>"Me, Bob! your old friend, Doctor Hardcastle; open the door and show yourself."</p>
               <p>"Oh, my Gor A'mighty, Marse Magnate, is it you, sure 'nough, come from forrin parts?" ejaculated the old negro, fumbling at the wooden latch and wrenching open the door. "Come in, come in—come in, Marse Magnate, come in. Oh, my bressed Lor'! I'm so joyed to see you. How is Miss Elsie! she long o' you? Come in!"</p>
               <p>"No, Bob, I can not come in. I am going straight on to the house. Elsie is not with me; she is at home, and well! I can't come in. I only called by to see you, my old friend, and to ask you if all were well at the house, and if anything new had happened."</p>
               <p>"All well dar, honey, 'deed dey is, fus rate. Nuffin new, honey, 'cept 'tis Marse I'on gwine be marry to Miss Ambush Wylie, to-morrow night."</p>
               <p>"Ah! Well, I wrote to General Garnet to say that I was coming to-night; is he expecting me, do you know?"</p>
               <p>"'Deed he got de letter, honey, caze I fotch it from de pos' office myself dis mornin', an' de pos' marser said how it war from out yonder where you gone to. But I never hear General I'on say nuffin 'bout 'spectin' no one to de weddin', 'deed I didn't, honey. Let me run along to de house an' rouse 'em all up and tell ole marse how you've come."</p>
               <p>"No, by no means, Bob. Thank you, good-night," said Doctor Hardcastle, jumping into the carriage.</p>
               <p>"All right, he has received your letter, madam; but has not imparted its contents to any one. <emph>He</emph> is doubtless expecting you momentarily; but as no one <emph>else</emph> is, your sudden appearance would strike a panic to the household, suddenly roused up out of their sleep, or perhaps send them all shrieking from the plantation."</p>
               <p>"But, would not <emph>your</emph> presence by my side—they know you're alive—re-assure them."</p>
               <p>"My dear Mrs. Garnet, they assisted at your funeral, twelve months ago, and seeing us enter at midnight together, will sooner believe <emph>me</emph> to be a second ghost, than <emph>you</emph> to be a living woman. No, my dear friend, you must veil yourself closely, and after I have got you into the house, pass quietly up to General Garnet's chamber, and reveal yourself to him. Here we are at last," said Doctor Hardcastle, pulling up before the front door of the mansion.</p>
               <p>All was dark except a fitful light that gleamed and sunk, and gleamed and sunk, from the upper windows of General Garnet's chamber—as of a candle expiring there in the socket.</p>
               <p>"It must be near two o'clock—yet he is still sitting up for me—see there," whispered Alice, pointing to the flashing and darkening light.</p>
               <p>"He must be alone, and have dropped asleep by that expiring light," murmured Magnus, as he led her up the stairs to the front door. "Now, courage, my dear friend. Remember, that in me you have a protector near you," whispered Doctor Hardcastle, as he fumbled about in the dark for the knocker. In doing so the door swung silently open—it had evidently been left ajar. They entered noiselessly. The hall was perfectly dark and silent; no sound was heard but the moan of the wind and the heavy fall of the rain without.<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7856-00000047"/> "Now, dearest Alice, he has evidently left the door ajar that you might enter without rousing the servants, and make your way at once to his chamber, where he awaits you. Go on—yet! STAY! I do not like the looks of this thing either. No one knows of your existence—no one knows that you were expected here; he awaits you alone in the solitude, silence, and darkness of deep night. No, Alice! I cannot let you go alone to his baleful presence—I must attend you."</p>
               <p>"Not for the world, Magnus. What monstrous thought is in your mind? Does midnight storm and solitude raise such phantoms of fear in your strong mind?"</p>
               <p>"Alice! bethink you! he is a man of fearful passions, yet of profound subtlety and secretiveness. He believed you dead, and was about to be married. He finds that he has been deceived in your death, and that his own marriage is about to be ridiculously broken off. He has imaginary injuries to revenge, and endangered joys to secure—both ends to be reached by <emph>one means.</emph> And more than all, he has the fearful temptation of fancied impunity. Alice, take care! this open door—this silent house—this lonely watcher in the solitary chamber—this deep night hour—and the expected lonely visiter. Alice, take care!" whispered Magnus.</p>
               <p>"Horrible! most horrible. You make my blood curdle. Not with fear, but with horror, at the monster in your imagination. You must not enter with me. I will go in alone. Follow, if you please to-do so, at a short distance.<emph>I</emph> have no such dreadful fear or doubt. I tremble, it is true; but I should also tremble if, in broad daylight, a score of people witnessed our meeting. Come on, and remain upon the landing while I go in."</p>
               <p>They passed silently up the stairs, and Alice, more dead than alive—really almost pale and cold as a corpse—reached the door of General Garnet's chamber, into which we must necessarily precede her, to describe how passed the interval between the moment of his retiring thither, and that of her arrival.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>On entering his chamber, General Garnet suddenly bethought himself of <emph>something</emph>—he could not exactly think <emph>what</emph>—forgotten. A strange absence of mind, temporary loss of memory, transient confusion of thought, had fitfully afflicted him all day long. He put his hand to his forehead, and walked up and down in doubt and perplexity, then suddenly recollecting what he wanted, he rang the bell, and when a servant, half-dressed, appeared, demanded, impatiently—</p>
               <p>"Anything from the post office, to-day, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, marser. Bob, he went to de post office, an' fotch de bag."</p>
               <p>"Then where is it, you scoundrel? and why was it not brought to me?" stamped the master.</p>
               <p>"De-ur-ur-ur—" stammered the negro, in fear and perplexity, scratching his head for an answer.</p>
               <p>"SIR!" thundered General Garnet.</p>
               <p>And the reply bolted from the lips of the negro as if thumped out by a blow between his shoulders.</p>
               <p>"Ugh! Yes, sir! You wan't comed home when it 'riv, marser, an' I hanged it on a chair by de liberry table, where you could see it when you comed."</p>
               <p>"And if I had forgotten all about it, as I did, you scoundrel! Go, and bring it to me. Vanish."</p>
               <p>The man precipitately retreated, and soon re-appeared with the mail-bag, which he placed in the hands of his master, who immediately opened, and turned out its contents.</p>
               <p>"Only one letter! And <emph>that</emph>—D——n!" exclaimed General Garnet, recognising the handwriting of Magnus Hardcastle in the superscription of Alice's letter. "Here, you sir! Come here!" added he, hastily blotting out the superscription, and re-directing it. "Come here! take this letter! By the earliest dawn tomorrow, take it back to the post office, that it may be in time for the mail, and tell the postmaster to send it back where it came from." He tossed the letter towards the feet of the negro, who tremblingly approached, picked it up, and retired from the chamber.</p>
               <p>Left alone, he paced up and down the floor in troubled thought, for about the space of an hour. All about the house was profoundly still; no sound was heard but the mournful murmur of the wind, and the dreary beating of the rain. The clock struck twelve, and the strokes fell through the awful stillness of the night with preternatural solemnity.</p>
               <p>"So late! and I not yet—<emph>calm enough</emph> to sleep—<emph>fearing</emph> to sleep, almost, lest I should never wake again. What <emph>is</emph> this? Why, now, does the solitude and silence of my chamber<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7856-00000048"/> ber so affect—so appal me? The truth is, I am <emph>ill!—must</emph> be, or I should not be so <emph>weak.</emph> I did not kill her. No, I did not kill her. <emph>I did not take any means to recover her for hours?</emph> Well! what if I did not? That was not murder! <emph>I let her die in her fit for want of assistance?</emph> She might have died anyhow. Why hoes her image haunt my bed, driving sleep thence? Oh, miserable weakness! Oh, cowardice! Would my bitterest enemy believe it of me?—that I dread to look around me, lest I see her face? It is <emph>this</emph> that is my illness. Oh! doctor, can your drugs banish <emph>her</emph> thought? Pshaw! They say nothing evil can come into the neighbourhood of innocence. Nettie! my Nettie is near me! in the next room. Surely my reason wanders. What evil <emph>could</emph> come nigh me! <emph>She</emph> was not 'evil' on earth. She is not 'evil' in Heaven. <emph>She</emph> would not avenge herself, if she could. Oh, wretched drivelling! What am I talking of? I am ill—I must be. It is illness that raises these phantoms of dread. And solitude and uncommunicated thoughts and sorrows have caused this illness. Courage! This is my last lonely night. To-morrow and ever after to-morrow, the cheerful face of that fair girl shall banish all such sickly fancies. To-morrow, and ever after to-morrow. But, to-night, I cannot rest at all. I—I will go and look at Nettie, sleeping, the innocence of slumbering childhood shall disperse the cloud of devils lowering over me. Nettie! '<hi rend="i"/>The sins of the father shall be visited upon the children—'. I dare not. No! I dare not now. No! I dare not."</p>
               <p>He dropped upon a chair—struck both hands to his forehead—whence the cold sweat oozed. He sat there, heedless, while the wind moaned around the house, and the rain beat drearily against the windows. He sat there, motionless, until the clock struck one, and the stroke fell like a knell. He started then, but relapsed, immediately, into statue-like stillness. The hour passed on, while the rain still beat, and the wind still moaned. The candle burned low in its socket, but he did not heed it. It flashed—filling the room with a strange brilliancy, and sunk, leaving it in darkness—but he did not heed it. It flashed and darkened—and flashed and darkened ever—but he did not heed it.</p>
               <p>The door swung open—but he did not know it. Alice—his lost wife, stood within, motionless—pale—but he did not see her. She gazed at him—growing paler every instant—she glided towards him—she stood over him—where he sat, with his face buried in his hands—but he gave no sign of consciousness. Trembling, pale, and cold with fear, she laid her icy hands upon him, saying, in a voice faint and hollow with exhausting emotion—</p>
               <p>"Aaron, I have come."</p>
               <p>He sprang up, as if shot; his face ashy pale, his countenance aghast, hair bristling, eyes starting with horror, as he exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"THEN SUCH THINGS ARE! You have taken form at last!—or else—yes!—it must be so—I am mad—MAD!—"</p>
               <p>Dashing his hands against his forehead, as though to shut out a horrible vision, he sunk back into his chair.</p>
               <p>Astonished, terrified, shuddering, Alice approached again, kneeled by his side, spoke gently, soothingly, deprecatingly to him.</p>
               <p>But, ere she ceased speaking, his hands dropped from his forehead, his head sank upon his bosom, his form swayed to and fro an instant, and then he fell forward, prostrate, at the feet of his wife.</p>
               <p>A succession of violent screams from Alice, brought Doctor Hardcastle rushing in at one door, and Nettie, in her nightgown, flying in at the other.</p>
               <p>They gathered around the fallen man. They raised him, set him in his chair.</p>

               <p>IT was the morning of Garnet Seabright's majority, when she was to come into possession of the vast estate given her by her adopted father, and she was expecting a visit from her trustee to give an account of his stewardship, and yield up his office.</p>
               <p>Lionel Hardcastle, fore-ordained by General Garnet as the husband of his inheritrix, had been appointed trustee of the estate, and guardian of the heiress, and of—his own interests at the same time.</p>
               <p>And well had he fulfilled his trust; no Eastern despot had ever established a stricter guard over a young Georgian maid, than did this guardian over the heiress. At the early age of twelve he had placed her at a strict convent school, where she avowed that she had to eat, drink, and sleep; pray, sing, and learn lessons; sit, stand, and walk; by exact rule. We may fancy the effect of such a discipline upon our wild child. The fleet deer of the mountain—penned! the free bird of the air caged! was nothing to this wild child of sea and land—confined! At first she was anxious to go; for all children like change; but at the first visit of her guardian, whom with her confiding nature she already loved, she sprang upon his lap, threw her arms around his neck, entreated, prayed, <emph>wept</emph> to be taken away; and when she found her vehement solicitations vain, she passionately dashed her hand into his face, called him an evil spirit, sprang from his arms, and threw herself face downwards flat upon the floor; called the good sisterhood a pack of old witches, with Hecate at their head, and threatened to starve herself to death, as the partridge did she tried to tame once; and so, by this conduct, got herself into disgrace for a week. There is great adaptativeness in childhood, and in time our little girl became reconciled to her convent, especially as the gentle nuns took an affectionate interest in civilizing the little barbarian, who, notwithstanding her faults, drew all hearts to herself. The effect of this conventual education was altogether good. It cultivated and directed the powers of her intellect and moral sense, and taught her to control the almost savage strength and daring of her passionate and energetic nature. But she left the convent distinguished by the same inflexibility of will with which she had entered its walls. By the will of her adopted father, she was not to marry until she had attained the age of twenty-one, and though then her choice was not absolutely controlled, it was directed to her guardian. It was upon this account, and to seclude her from society, and the chance of forming another attachment, that, despite the conscientious expostulations of the Mother Superior, he left her boarding at the convent until she had nearly reached her twentieth birth-day. About that time, Miss Seabright became inspired with a desire to see the world—not society, but the earth and all thereon; so, without asking any favours, she expressed her will to leave the convent and travel for a year. This proposition well suited the views of her guardian, as it obviated the awkward necessity of leaving her in the convent, or the impolitic alternative of introducing her into society, and gave him an admirable opportunity of pressing his suit, and even imposing upon her the inevitable <emph>propriety</emph> of accepting him.</p>
               <p>They made the tour of Europe together, journeying over the kindred soil of Old England, the "sunny land" of France, the old chivalric mountains of Spain, the classic plains of Italy and Greece, the Alpine precipices of Switzerland; along the forest, rock, and castle-shadowed rivers of Germany; over the snow-clad plains of Russia, and thence down amid the mosques and seraglios of Turkey. By Mr. Hardcastle's position and<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7856-00000050"/> connexion in America, and his letters of presentation to our ministers abroad, he might have obtained introduction for himself and ward into the best society of every capital in Europe, but it did not suit his policy to do so. And even when her love of travel was somewhat sated, and Miss Seabright expressed a desire to enter the world of society, he put her off from time to time with various excuses. As her wish to mingle with the world was not very strong, she did not insist. And thus at the end of thirteen months' travel in Europe, Miss Seabright set out on her return home as "innocent of the knowledge" of the world as when she had left her convent walls. She had had the opportunity of studying deeply but one specimen of human nature, and him she had well learned—her guardian and travelling companion, Lionel Hardcastle. Repeatedly had he pressed his suit, and eloquently had he pleaded the passion with which his recent intimate association with the unique and beautiful girl had inspired him. And repeatedly, amid protestations of gratitude and friendship, had she lamented her utter inability to meet his love. <emph>He bided his time!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>It was in this relative position that the guardian and ward returned to Mount Calm early in the spring of 18—. Miss Seabright had gratified her artistic taste by the collection of rare articles of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">virtù;</foreign> specimens of ancient art; one or two fine old oil paintings by the old masters; a few choice statuettes, &amp;c., in Italy, and had indulged her love of luxury with the purchase of elegant furniture in France. These had been transported to Mount Calm, where the mansion-house had been superbly fitted up for the reception of its young mistress.</p>
               <p>It was then a fine day in the month of March that Miss Seabright sat in her library, awaiting the arrival of her guardian. This superb apartment was even more luxuriously furnished than before. In addition to the gorgeous furniture, costly books, and choice pictures and statues, there were other and rarer works of art: various instruments of music; elegant vases filled with exotics; throwing an air of high refinement over the splendour and luxury of the room. Miss Seabright paced slowly up and down this room with a majestic tread, in profound yet joyous thought. It is said that the greatest charm of beauty consists in some peculiarity; no one could have gazed on Garnet Seabright without feeling the truth of that. Observe her! at first glance she seems only a very fine, imperial looking woman, arrayed in a rich, dark satin, with a high, Roman profile, and a profusion of long black ringlets falling before, and looped up with a jewelled comb behind. Yet observe her closer; the peculiarity of Garnet Seabright's wonderful beauty was in the colour of her hair, eyes, and eyebrows. See, as she slowly crosses that sunbeam from the window; the hair you thought so black scintillates in thread-like rings of crimson fire wherever the sun falls; and the eyes that seemed so dark and tender burn with an unquenchable light that half terrifies while it attracts you. The character of that beauty would be fierce as well as fiery, but for the delicacy of the forehead, nose, and rounded chin, and the ineffable tenderness of the lips; <emph>they</emph> reassure you; silently they tell you that blaze as those burning eyes may, there is a world of charity, tenderness, forbearance, upon which you might throw yourself with all your sins and sorrows, and be sure of sympathy, comfort, and repose.</p>
               <p>"Mr. LIONEL HARDCASTLE!" announced a servant, throwing open the door. Miss Seabright seated herself before the library table, and Mr. Lionel Hardcastle entered the library, accompanied by old Mr. Hardcastle, his father, and a lawyer.</p>
               <p>Miss Seabright arose to receive them, invited them to be seated, and pointed to chairs, which they immediately drew to the library table, where they placed themselves.</p>
               <p>A half-hour was then occupied in the reading and transferring of certain documents, of which the lawyer finally took charge.</p>
               <p>Then the gentlemen got up to take leave. Miss Seabright also arose, to dismiss them; but when she saw that Lionel Hardcastle was about to bow the others out with the purpose of remaining himself, she courteously advanced, and invited them all to remain and dine. A quick telegraphic look from Lionel Hardcastle to his father, arrested the old gentleman's intention of accepting, so that, excusing himself, he took leave and withdrew, followed by the lawyer. Miss Seabright also followed, with the intention of leaving the library, but Lionel Hardcastle intercepted her purpose by bowing the gentlemen out, and closing the door after them. Miss Seabright retreated to the library table, where she stood erect, with one<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7856-00000051"/> hand resting upon the table, and with her fiery eyes concentrating all their rays into a burning focus in the gaze she fixed upon his face. Yet he winced not; but advancing calmly towards her, said, "That attitude and gaze, Miss Seabright, would remind me that my authority as your guardian ceases from this hour."</p>
               <p>"Without referring to that circumstance, Mr. Hardcastle, I would only plead excessive weariness of this room, and to be excused for the remainder of the day."</p>
               <p>"You do not look in the least fatigued; and just now you even invited my father and your lawyer to remain and dine with you."</p>
               <p>"And extended the same invitation to yourself; which I now repeat. Will you now accept it, and excuse me for an hour's repose until dinner time?" she asked calmly—calmly; yet he could see by those dark eyes, which blazed and darkened under their heavy lids like a flashing and expiring flame, that under that quiet exterior, volcanic passion stirred, threatening every instant to break out in destroying fury, and only restrained by the force of her own will, and the power of her own moral sense.</p>
               <p>He folded his arms, and gazed on her; his look was resolved, his face was ashen pale, all the strength and fire of his nature seemed concentrated and burning in his eyes, and in the gaze he fixed upon her face. He answered, slowly, "No, Miss Seabright; there is no repose for <emph>me,</emph> shall be none for <emph>you,</emph> until you hear me. I will not leave this room, nor suffer you to leave it, until you hear me. Hitherto you have disregarded your benefactor's expressed will and wishes, contemned my claims, despised my love."</p>
               <p>"Your 'love'?—is <emph>yours</emph> the language or the deportment of <emph>love?</emph>" she asked, in the deep, stern tone of suppressed indignation.</p>
               <p>His manner suddenly changed; and from insolent and threatening, became submissive and deprecating. He dashed his hands suddenly against his forehead, then threw himself at her feet, seized her hands and dropping his head upon them, almost wept, exclaiming, "No, no, Garnet! mine were not the words or acts of love, but of 'love to frenzy driven.' I forswear them. Pardon me, pardon me. Garnet, I love you! I adore you! I worship you!—not that you have beauty, grace, genius—all these I have seen in other women, with an undisturbed heart—but there is an unique power in your look, that draws me to you; there is a fire in your soul and in your eyes that draws me to you as the sun attracts the earth. Daughter of the sun you are indeed, with all his reddest rays concentrated in your being, as in the burning gem, your family namesake. Garnet, oh, Garnet, I rave still, and more insanely than before. Garnet, restore peace, calmness, self-possession and <emph>reason</emph> to my soul! Give your peerless self to me! Be my salvation! <emph>Speak</emph> to me! <emph>Answer</emph> me! Say something, oh, dear Garnet!"</p>
               <p>Her lightning anger, quick to subside as to flash forth, had died away. As he held her hands, kissing them and almost weeping over them, she answered, in a low voice, "Alas! Mr. Hardcastle, what shall I say? What <emph>can</emph> I say, that I have not said with pain before this? I feel honoured by your esteem; I feel grateful for your love; I feel humbled that I cannot return it. It is no disparagement to you—it is a misfortune, perhaps, to me—that I cannot do so. One cannot always admire what may be admirable, or esteem what may be estimable, still less can they always love what is lovable. Yet I am disposed to entertain a profound friendship for you. My dear guardian, cease then to torment yourself and me farther with this question. I cannot marry," she said, gently but firmly, as she sank into the chair behind her.</p>
               <p>"Cannot marry!" he repeated, rising, and throwing himself upon a sofa near her, "Cannot marry! Have you then made a vow of celibacy? Has your convent education imbued you with that notion?"</p>
               <p>"No; Heaven forbid! I have formed no resolution of leading a single life. I should not be happy in such a destiny, should not even if I were already blessed with father and mother, sisters and brothers, cousins and friends—how could I possibly expect to be, standing perfectly alone as I do?"</p>
               <p>"You could not, my Garnet; you could not. And where, in these solitudes, could you find a man worthy of you? Why, you are already twenty-one years of age, and have no suitor but myself. You will yet bless me with your rich affections, you must! You are destined for me, and by all my hopes of Heaven, I will never give you up!"</p>
               <p>"Stay—I will be frank with you, my guardian; for I think<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7856-00000052"/> that harsh frankness is better that false hope. I will be frank with you, even to the charge of egotism. Listen, then. I shall not always live in these solitudes. I am not fitted for it. I am social, benevolent, energetic, venturesome. I have wealth, time, freedom, and some talent. I purpose to use their powers for my benefit, and for the benefit of others. I intend first to do what good I can here—then elsewhere. I shall leave this place, travel, make acquaintances and friends."</p>
               <p>"And still all this tends to leading a single life; to becoming—oh, Miss Seabright, you will not become that monster of nature, a masculine woman—a—"</p>
               <p>"No; sometime and somewhere, in the natural course of events, I shall meet with some noble, aspiring, elevated nature, such as that to which, in dreams, my whole being with all its strength and fire instinctively tends, and by a life-association with which, my nature shall become more noble, elevated, and aspiring; and his greater wisdom and knowledge shall guide and direct me aright in the faithful stewardship of my wealth and power."</p>
               <p>Her face was radiant with enthusiasm and hope as she spoke. He turned deadly pale, and hissed between his teeth.</p>
               <p>"You will then become an adventuress, and fall into the hands of some sharper."</p>
               <p>"Look at me, well. Am <emph>I</emph> a woman to fall a prey to a fortune-hunter? No; the man who marries me must already have 'achieved' such greatness, that he shall be great and good by the universal suffrages of society—must be loved, honoured, distinguished by the world. You have told me that I have beauty, genius, rich affections: if I have, I hold them all in sacred trust for just such a man."</p>
               <p>"I will remember your words; and when you have fallen into the hands of some sharper, remind you of them. <emph>Dreamer!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"If I do dream, such men as I dream of do, nevertheless, really live in this world. Not many of them, perhaps, but a few, and, out of the few, ONE who needs me. My guardian, I never take up a newspaper, but, besides the columns of casualties, and the report of crimes, and, amid all the sin and misery of the world of which it is a transcript, I still see, like stars shining out among the clouds, the saying and doings of certain great and god-like men, who are now living and acting; and my heart burns within me to meet such, and I feel and know, that when I enter society I <emph>shall</emph> meet such, and among them ONE who will seek me, ONE to whom all I am and have will not be more a gift than a debt."</p>
               <p>Her look and tone were eloquent, impassioned, inspired for an instant, and then they sank, and she added seriously, in a low voice,</p>
               <p>"My guardian, if I have unveiled to you the Holy of Holies in my heart, it is to show you that I have shrined a <emph>dream</emph> there, and you cannot enter. Yet I have a sisterly affection for you—<emph>not love!</emph> There be many affections; but only <emph>one love!</emph> only one—marriage."</p>
               <p>He had restrained himself as long as it was possible to do so. He now started from the sofa where he had reclined, watching her with pale cheeks and burning gaze, and starting towards her with clenched fist, he exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Yes, haughty girl, you speak truth; there is but one marriage—<emph>for you!</emph> You are compelled to marry <emph>me!</emph> The world expects it of you. Is not the will of your benefactor known? Are we not generally supposed to be betrothed? Did we not make the tour of Europe <emph>alone together?</emph> The world expects you to marry me. And you will for ever lose the respect of the world by failing to do so."</p>
               <p>Her brow crimsoned, her eyes blazed, she arose to her feet and answered slowly,</p>
               <p>"And I will rather lose the respect of the world by rejecting you, than <emph>deserve</emph> to lose it by accepting you."</p>
               <p>"FOOL! Have you no regard for your reputation?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; but think it wrong to secure good <emph>reputation</emph> at the expense of good <emph>character.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"What paradox, what nonsense is that?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! they are not synonymous terms, character and reputation; on earth they never have been, on earth they never will be. Often they are antagonistic words. Many of the heroes and martyrs of history, the demigods of our adoration, were men of the best characters, with—while they lived—the worst reputations."</p>
               <p>"Then you <emph>have</emph> no respect for the good opinion of the world?"</p>
               <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7856-00000053"/>
               <p>"<emph>Yes!</emph> my aspiring heart! <emph>too much,</emph> I fear, for my soul's good; and I know, I know by all the glorious gifts of Heaven to me, I know by all my mighty power for <emph>good</emph> or <emph>ill,</emph> by all my absolute unswerving <emph>will</emph> to <emph>good,</emph> I <emph>know</emph> that I have a right and title, Heaven-patented, not to the passive good opinion, but to the HONOUR, the co-operation of the world."</p>
               <p>"And <emph>I</emph> tell you, haughty woman, as you stand here a very goddess of Pride, I tell you as you stand here beneath these halls, where you should never have stood, invested with all this power, that you should never have possessed; armed with the might of vast wealth and of high talent, arrayed in the magic charms of young womanhood and perfect beauty. I tell you, that you <emph>are now</emph>—naught, that you <emph>will be,</emph> unless you marry me—a suspected, proscribed, banned, OUTCAST woman!" He expected this to overwhelm her. But she turned her large, dark, solemn eyes, solemn <emph>now</emph> with prophetic inspiration, upon him, and inquired calmly,</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"Listen, girl: You are ambitious, arrogant, scornful. Yet a few words from me will subdue all that, by showing you, that you are obliged to marry <emph>me.</emph> Attend! we made the tour of Europe <emph>alone together,</emph> putting up at the same hotels, having a common parlour, a common table, a common carriage—"</p>
               <p>"Well, sir! That is easily understood in guardian and ward."</p>
               <p>"Not when the guardian is a man of thirty-seven, and the ward a girl of twenty; not when <q>
                     <l>'Both are young and one is beautiful,'"</l>
                  </q> he added, sneeringly, "Often, you know it, we were mistaken for a married pair—"</p>
               <p>"And for brother and sister," she added, the blood mounting to her brow.</p>
               <p>"Which we were not. Now attend! All that familiarity may be understood in a guardian and ward, who are, <emph>besides,</emph> known to be betrothed to each other, and who keep their tacit promise to society by marriage. Now listen! if you should not consent to marry me—"</p>
               <p>"<emph>If</emph> I do not! I will not. There is no <emph>if.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Then all your beauty, wealth and talent, with all the power they give you, avail you nothing. You are an outcast!"</p>
               <p>She dropped into her chair again, she paled even to her lips, the fire died out of her eyes, and even from every lurid ring of her dark, bright hair. He gazed at her ironically, saying, slowly,</p>
               <p>"Ah! you do not <emph>care</emph> for the opinion of the world."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Do I not?</emph>" she exclaimed, with sudden and impassioned energy, "do I not aspire to the <emph>honour</emph> of all the world? Do I not know and feel by all that I <emph>am</emph> and <emph>have,</emph> and by all that I purpose to <emph>do</emph> and to <emph>be,</emph> that I have a God-given patent to such honour? Has not my soul prophesied it?"</p>
               <p>"And I repeat to you, haughty woman, that unless you marry <emph>me,</emph> you will not have it. Your <emph>powers</emph> are all <emph>paralyzed.</emph>"</p>
               <p>She dropped her hands upon her lap, her head upon her bosom, in the collapse of despair.</p>
               <p>"Ha! trapped, palsied, helpless!" he exclaimed, exultingly, "where is now your vaunted independence? your pride? your scorn? gone! quite gone! why, so much the better. You will make the better wife for the loss of that. Come, Garnet, I love you; could worship your beauty, sometimes, only that it seems to spoil you; come, I love you. Let us cease this absurd quarrel and be friends. Come, do not look so despairingly. Harsh and stern as I may be when threatened with your loss, I shall not make such a bad husband. And for the rest—Bless me, girl, you know my family and my standing,—shall I be such a very ill match for General Garnet's—"</p>
               <p>He paused, and she raised her death-like brow, and wiping the cold drops of sweat from its pallid surface, said, slowly and with profound sadness,</p>
               <p>"Oh-h-h! You miserably misconceive my grief. It is this that overwhelms me, it is the thought of your—"</p>
               <p>"Villany! Speak out, I will relieve you!" he said, sarcastically.</p>
               <p>"I did not mean to use the word."</p>
               <p>"Policy, then! for it was no more nor less; only finish."</p>
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7856-00000054"/>
               <p>"It is this, then, that crushes me with sorrow; the knowledge that <emph>you,</emph> my only protector, who should have warned my inexperience against the least social mistake, and shielded my good name from the slightest chance of injury, that <emph>you,</emph> my guardian, having perfect authority over me, and indisputable control of all my actions; that <emph>you,</emph> my friend, having my perfect confidence and affection, that YOU should have abused that authority, betrayed that confidence, and wounded that affection by leading me into a course of conduct, pre-calculated, pre-contrived to fetter my choice in woman's dearest privilege, or to blast my fair fame and palsy my powers of usefulness for ever."</p>
               <p>"Rave on! be abusive, scornful, insulting as you please. But I tell you, arrogant woman, that he whom you abuse, insult and scorn, will be your husband yet."</p>
               <p>"And <emph>I</emph> tell <emph>you,</emph> insolent man!" she exclaimed, starting to her feet with all the fire of her nature burning in her cheeks, and blazing in her eyes, "<emph>I</emph> tell <emph>you</emph> that, wronged, suspected, proscribed, <emph>outcast</emph> as I may be; and add to that poor, friendless, ill, persecuted, desolate as I may be, I could not fall <emph>so</emph> low as to become the wife of the wretch <emph>you</emph> are. I repel your pretensions with scorn and loathing. Begone!"</p>
               <p>He gazed at her in speechless amazement. Was this incarnate storm, his ward? the dignified, self-restraining, self-governing Miss Seabright? Yes, the violent passions of her nature, restrained for many years, had now burst the bonds of moral power. The volcanic tide of fire that had ebbed and flowed, and been repressed through all this scene, had now broken forth in appalling power. Her form was erect—and dilated her cheeks—her brow was crimson, her eyes blazed and darkened, and blazed and darkened, with terrific rapidity.</p>
               <p>"BEGONE!" she thundered, "out of my sight, or by the Heaven that made me, I will summon my slaves and have you thrust forth with contumely from my gates!" Her hand was on the bell, her insane purpose was indubitable.</p>
               <p>With a gesture of desperation he rushed from the room.</p>
               <p>She gazed after him until he had closed the door. She stood mentionless a long, long time, while the tide of fire ebbed; then sinking with the reaction of the exhaustion and self-reproach, she covered her face with her hands, murmuring in heart-broken tones, "<emph>God pity me! God forgive me!</emph> What a nature is mine! With a heart and bosom torn, tortured, convulsed by storms of ferocious anger, scorn and pride, yet with a spirit brooding highly, calmly over all—as above the clouds, and thunder, and lightning of the earth, shine the holy stars of Heaven."</p>

               <p>LONG remained Miss Seabright with her head bowed upon her hand in bitter thought. Twice a servant came and announced dinner, without her seeing or hearing him. The third time, when he approached and spoke close to her ear, she raised her head languidly, and said,</p>
               <p>"Ask Miss Joe to dine without me."</p>
               <p>And when Miss Joe herself came in with anxious inquiries about her health, and affectionate offers of tea and toast and jellies, she answered, with a bitter smile,</p>
               <p>"Oh, be easy, dear friend; a little fasting will not hurt <emph>my</emph> flesh and blood!"</p>
               <p>Day waned, and still she maintained her silent and thoughtful posture. Night came, and a servant entered with candles. The glare of light aroused her, and looking up, she saw the dark face of the man turned ashen gray with fear. "What is the matter, Cæsar?"</p>
               <p>"Light on de island, Miss; you kin see it plain as star ashinin!"</p>
               <p>"Light on the island? Well, I will go and see myself. Where can this light be seen from?"</p>
               <p>"From de garret window, Miss, sure as you're born."</p>
               <p>"Go on before me," she said, rising from her recumbent posture, and following the man up the several flight of stairs to the attic.</p>
               <p>Arrived there, in the very front room where Elsie had been a prisoner, on the last night of her stay at Mount Calm, they paused.</p>
               <p>Miss Seabright advanced to the window, threw it up, and looked out at the clear, brilliant, starlight night. There was not a breath of wind stirring. The air was still and cold. The rolling hills and plains white with snow, and intersected only by the belt of forest around the foot of Mount Calm, reached silently on to the dark boundary of the sea.</p>
               <p>"Why, I see no light at sea; none anywhere except the myriad light of stars in Heaven!" said Miss Seabright, letting down the window.</p>
               <p>"Bress you soul, miss, no more you can't, least wise you puts out de candle and looks t'rough the spy-glass!"</p>
               <p>"Why, here's a fellow! who not having causes of trouble enough near him, must put out the light and take a telescope to find out distant ones! Well, set the candle outside the door, and give me the glass." And taking the telescope she went again to the window and hoisted it. "Yes," she said, after taking sight, "yes, there is a light shining still and clear, and apparently fixed near the ruins of the old lodge!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, it can be seen plain as possible from the village," said Miss Joe, who now entered, followed by other members of the household.</p>
               <p>Miss Seabright closed the window, and turning to the assembled group, said, with her singular smile,</p>
               <p>"Well, now, this is really a very small affair for conjecture, and could interest none but a country family in the depth of winter. Let us go down stairs. It is probably some poor, lone soul, who, having no other shelter, has put together the ruins of the old lodge, and lives there and supports himself by fishing and shooting."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Miss Joe, "that might be well enough, and nobody think nothing of it, only you see, honey, the folks from the village have been over on the island in the broad day time sarching, and they can't find the leastest signs of human habitations; the poor, dear old lodge is more tumble-down-der than ever, as in course it must naterally be every winter, with no one to keep the dear, old crippled thing on its legs. Lord,<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7856-00000056"/> child, the neighbours from Huttontown found all so dessolute that the very stars of heaven were shin down into the water collected in the cellar. No roof, no chimneys, no <emph>floors</emph> even; nothing but the lonesome, dessolute walls, and the stagnant cellar. They didn't find anybody, nor any sign of anybody, though they sarched all over the island—but, mind, <emph>that</emph> was at sunset, and that night about dark the light blazed up there as bright as ever!"</p>
               <p>"Why did not the neighbours go and search <emph>then?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"<emph>They did.</emph> They got into the boats and rowed straight back, watching the ghostly light all the time, and just afore they landed, it was out."</p>
               <p>"Did they carry a light in their boats?"</p>
               <p>"Certain."</p>
               <p>"Then the great problem is solved. It was some fugitive slave, a refugee on the island, who, seeing the approach of the boats by the lights they carried, extinguished <emph>his</emph> light, and concealed himself."</p>
               <p>"As if he could. Lor', child, where <emph>could</emph> he hide away on that island? All plain and bare, and bleak as it is; no bit o' woods, no hollow; nothing but the outside walls o' the old lodge, with its cellar full o' water, and the lonesome, bare trees standin' far apart like ghosts."</p>
               <p>"True; very true; there is not a hiding-place <emph>possible</emph> on the island. But I cling to the thought of the fugitive refugee, who, seeing the invaders, probably extinguished his light, and <emph>took boat for the open sea.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No, honey, that w'a'nt it. Bless you, <emph>they</emph> thought of that at once, and lit more pine knots, and separated, and run all around the coast of the little islet, and flashed their lights about, and couldn't see of a boat on the waters."</p>
               <p>"Then I am at the end of conjecture. Come, let us go down. It is cold up here. Take up the candle, Cæsar," said Miss Seabright, turning from the room.</p>
               <p>"Yes, let's go down; it is <emph>so</emph> cold up here. And supper's ready in the little red parlour. <emph>That's</emph> what I come to tell you, when these niggers all followed me. I told Milly, long as you hadn't eat any dinner, and felt sort o' low spirited, to get supper airly, and br'il a pair of pa'tridges. A cup o' good, strong Young Hyson tea, with light biscuits and br'iled pa'tridges, is very good for lowness o' spirits. I knows it, 'cause I've tried it myself."</p>
               <p>They hurried through the bleak passages, and down stairs.</p>
               <p>Miss Seabright, preceded by the servant bearing the candle, and followed by the old lady, entered the parlour. The comfortable little parlour, with its thick carpet, heavy curtains, soft sofa, bright fire, and elegant tea-table, was certainly a specific for mere low spirits. The old lady bustled past Garnet, and set the urn upon the table, burning her fingers slightly, and rubbing them, while she exclaimed cheerily,</p>
               <p>"There now; sit down. As there's no one here but you and me, you know, you can draw the end of the sofy to the table and loll on that, while I pour out your tea and butter you a biscuit. Cæsar, you cut up that pa'tridge for your young mist'ess—not <emph>that</emph> one, you stupid creetur! <emph>t'other</emph> one, it's the plumpest. Now you see, honey, the maids have got through their day's work, for a wonder, and I have got time to stay in the parlour and enjoy myself 'long o' you. And so we'll have a jolly good evening; you can loll on the sofa and enjoy yourself with your low-spirits and cologne bottle—only don't waste it—and I can sit here and patch my old gown, and talk about old times."</p>
               <p>Garnet looked at the good-natured face of the old lady, and felt compunction for the answer she was about to make—</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to spoil the plan of your evening's entertainment, Miss Joe, but I am going to explore Hutton's Island to-night."</p>
               <p>"Going to explore Hutton's Island to-night!" exclaimed Miss Joe, dropping knife and fork, and staring at her.</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"<emph>You!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"The Lord have mercy upon her! I've been havin' of my misgivins all this time, but now I <emph>know</emph> she's a little deranged!" said Miss Joe, to herself. Then speaking aloud, in something of the tone one would take in addressing a sick and delirious child, "No, no, honey, don't think of it! You're sick, you know, and it is cold and dark and dangerous. Then, it isn't proper for a young lady to do such a thing, anyhow!"</p>
               <p>Miss Seabright smiled a queer smile, as she replied,</p>
               <p>"For the first objections, my good old friend, cowardice is not one of my weaknesses; for the last—" she paused and<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7856-00000057"/> her smile deepened in meaning—"I made a start in life by quite innocently perpetrating a heinous, a fatal—crime? no, <emph>impropriety!</emph> I broke no law of God or man; yet I am told that for that I shall be banished from society, <emph>unless</emph> I do commit a sin, in open day, in the face of society; who will then forgive me!"</p>
               <p>"Mad! mad!" said Miss Joe, to herself, gazing at the ironical girl.</p>
               <p>"Well! <q>
                     <l>'What's <emph>banished</emph> but set free?'</l>
                  </q> I will do whatever I please—conventional or unconventional! I will break no law of God's or man's, and after that is said, all is said for me. For the rest, I will do whatever my spirit impels me to do, whether the world likes it or not!" said Garnet, speaking more to herself than to another, and rising and ringing the bell.</p>
               <p>"Mad! mad! mad! and getting worse every minute," said Miss Joe, hurrying out, and hastening into the front hall, where Cæsar was lighting the lamp.</p>
               <p>"Cæsar, come here to me, quick—close. Hush! don't say anything. Go as hard as you can to Hemlock Hollow, and tell Mr. Lionel Hardcastle how he must come as fast as possible here; how he's wanted badly, <emph>very</emph> badly. Hurry—mount a fast horse, and go as quick as ever you can!"</p>
               <p>The man, with his eyes staring wide, ran to obey. Miss Joe then returned to the parlour, where she found Garnet giving directions to a servant to have two horses saddled, and prepare himself to attend her down to the shore. Miss Seabright was giving her orders with so much calmness and precision, that the old lady thought she had a lucid interval in her madness, and that this afforded her an excellent opportunity for argument; so, as soon as the man retired, she said, coaxingly,</p>
               <p>"My dear child, <emph>think</emph> of it!"</p>
               <p>"I do, Miss Joe; and the more I think of it the more I want to go. I am determined to vary the tedious monotony of my days with a little adventure!"</p>
               <p>"My dear child, you have heard of the fate of Agnes! How she was either murdered, or carried off from that island by unknown ruffians!"</p>
               <p>"I heard long ago of her mysterious disappearance, Miss Joe, and I always thought, and think now, that in her deep despair for the sudden loss of her husband, she drowned herself. I think so the more, that never before or since that strange occurrence, has any outrage been attempted on the island. Think of the years <emph>we</emph> lived there alone with nothing to disturb our quiet. Why, <emph>often</emph> in the fond superstition of my childhood, when I have waked up in the night, have I risen and gone out into the starlight, and rambled all over the isle, in the hope of surprising the fairies at their midnight revels! Well, if I never found <emph>them,</emph> I never found anything worse. No, Miss Joe, there is no danger. If there <emph>were,</emph> I do not know the fear of it. That solitary light on the isle belongs to some solitary wretch, poorer and more friendless even than <emph>we</emph> were; one whose misfortunes or crimes make him dread and shun the approach of his fellow men; one whom I do not fear to seek; one whom, if I find, I shall try to relieve. And I will tell you, if that will ease your kind anxiety upon my account, I will direct Pompey to take a pair of pistols."</p>
               <p>As she finished speaking, a servant appeared at the door, and announced that the horses were ready.</p>
               <p>She left the parlour, and soon returned prepared for her ride, and immediately set out.</p>
               <p>Miss Joe fidgeted up and down the hall in great disturbance of mind. In about ten minutes after Miss Seabright had left the house, the quick trampling of horses announced the arrival of Lionel Hardcatle. He hurried into the house, booted and spurred as he was, and asked, rapidly,</p>
               <p>"Where is Miss Seabright? Has she sent for me?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir; <emph>no.</emph> It was <emph>me</emph> that sent for you. Come here—here in the parlour, sir. I have got something terrible to tell you. Shut the door."</p>
               <p>He followed her into the parlour, closing the door as requested, and stared with astonishment at the old lady's excited countenance, while, with rapid enunciation, she related all that had happened just before, and since his visit in the forenoon. Miss Seabright's excited manner when talking about a mere "old smoky picture," her extravagant tale about giving so many hundred dollars for the "ugly dingy thing," her profound mourning all the afternoon, refusing to eat, drink,<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7856-00000058"/> or talk; and then her mad resolution of going that night to Hutton's Island to find out about the light, and above all, her "<emph>real crazy</emph>" talking about committing a sin before the world in order "to keep in long o' the world." Mr. Hardcastle listened with a sarcastic smile until he heard of her night expedition; then his sinister face lighted up with demoniac joy, to conceal which he quickly averted his head.</p>
               <p>"Ha! with only one attendant, say you?"</p>
               <p>"With no one, sir, but Pomp—sure as you're born."</p>
               <p>I must instantly go after her then."</p>
               <p>"Oh, <emph>do,</emph> sir! <emph>do</emph> hurry!" said Miss Joe, and in five minutes more Lionel Hardcastle, with the dark and lowering brow of a fiend hidden by the night, was galloping swiftly towards the coast, muttering in his heart, "Now, scornful girl, shall my love and vengeance both be sated!"</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Garnet had reached the shore at which the Mount Calm fleet of boats were chained—boats of all sizes, from the long skiff to the twelve-oared canoe, and the sail-boat. She entered the smallest of the skiffs, followed by Pompey, who immediately unlocked the chain, took the single oar, and pushed off from the sandy beach. The bay was perfectly smooth, and reflected the dark, resplendent sky, with its myriads beyond myriads of shining lights so distinctly, that the little skiff seemed to glide among the stars as it sped over the waters. Soon before them lay Hutton's Island, like a darker line upon the sea. And there, like a single star, shone the solitary light! Yet so much deeper was Garnet's love of nature than of adventure, that she delivered herself up to intense enjoyment of the starlight night on the waters, forgetful of her errand, until the slight shock of the skiff, touching upon the strand of the island, aroused her from her trance. Then, when she looked up, the light on the isle was gone.</p>
               <p>"That is very provoking! Now who would have thought that darkly and silently as we came, we should have been perceived? However, light your pine knot, Pompey, and come along."</p>
               <p>Pompey had been selected as her attendant in this expedition, by Miss Seabright, as being the least superstitious and cowardly of all her men, yet now the namesake of "The Invincible" shrank back in dread, muttering,</p>
               <p>"Indeed, indeed, miss, you'd better not!"</p>
               <p>"Pompey! whoever the dweller on this isle is, it is some poor wretch, more worthy of our pity than of our fear; weak and timid, since it watches and hides from even such harmless visiters as we. Come along!"</p>
               <p>"'Deed—'deed, miss, that ain't good reasonin'! 'Deed, 'fore my Hebbenly Marster, ain't, miss. 'Deed—'deed—'deed—'deed—"muttered Pompey, his teeth chattering, until he lost his voice.</p>
               <p>"Give me the torch then, Pompey; I will go before. You may follow me as distantly as you please, and run at the first alarm!"</p>
               <p>"I think that would be de mos' safes', miss; caze dey wouldn't be so apt to shoot a young lady, miss, as dey would to shoot a coloured gemman ob my siteration in deciety."</p>
               <p>Without hearing Pompey's compromise with his cowardice and his conscience, Miss Seabright, torch in hand, walked up the gradually ascending rise of ground to the ruins of the old lodge. From being so long out in the night, her eyes had become accustomed to it, so that now, under the brilliant starlight, the scene was distinctly, though darkly, before her—the ruin, the isle, and the sea. No sign of fence or out-house could be seen as she approached the ruined lodge, whose skeleton walls stood up square around what seemed a deep, stagnant pond, whose stillness was drearily broken by the plunge of some toad, snake, or other loathsome reptile. Blinded or scared by the glare of the torch, bats flitted to and fro about the ruined walls, water rats ran in and out among the broken stones, and plunged into the stagnant waters, and lastly, a huge screech-owl took flight from the blasted tree by the fallen chimney, "making night hideous" with his yells. Profoundly saddened by seeing the beloved home of her wild childhood so desolate, Garnet turned silently away, and passing mournfully over the bleak ground, reached the strand. Then passing slowly all around the beach, she looked out upon the waters in search of any stray boat that might contain the supposed fugitive of the isle. As far as the eye could reach, no sign of a boat could be seen. She then turned inland—if the tiny isle could be said to have an inland—and searched carefully about, walking around every spectre-like tree standing far apart on the bare, bleak island, and quite incapable after all of concealing the smallest possible fugitive in the <emph>human</emph> shape. But<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7856-00000059"/> she looked around and up into them, as I have seen men look under candlesticks, and into tiny drawers for their missing hats, umbrellas, and boot-jacks! After her thorough search was quite over, she turned to her attendant, and said,</p>
               <p>"Well, I am disappointed. There is positively no one here, and the mystery of the island light is still unsolved."</p>
               <p>Her attendant did not answer. Thinking that he was still under the influence of fear, she said,</p>
               <p>"Why, Pompey, we are as safe and as quiet here as I was when I lived here with Aunt Joe and Hugh."</p>
               <p>Still her follower did not speak, but rather lingered behind her, and she herself relapsed into silence, and fell into a revery, until she arrived at the farthest extremity of the isle, opposite to that on which she had landed. This was the north-western point of the island, and the same beach upon which she and the sole companion of her childhood, Hugh, used to pick maninosies. Here, as she walked about watching the starlit waves break gently on the beach, noting the numerous perforations, where the maninosies had buried themselves in the sand, the tide of memory rolled back, overwhelming the apprehension of the present. She saw herself a tiny, sprite-like child, stealing out on starlight nights, and sitting on the pile of rocks, on this very spot, watching in fond faith for the swimming of the nereids, and mistaking the reflection of some purple cloud, high up in the heavens, for the royal robe of Amphytrite in the "deep, deep sea." She saw herself again in the day-time, when the setting sun, like Macbeth's blood-crimsoned hand, would <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"The multitudinous seas incarnadine,</l>
                        <l>Making the green—one red!"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> she saw herself well shod and warmly clothed, and Hugh, the manly boy, barefooted, bareheaded, and coarsely clad, yet grandly handsome "as Hercules ere his first labour!" Hugh, with his noble look and noble nature; and she smiled to think of the high faith, and hope, and love, that irradiated his fine countenance, as he confidently promised to make a fortune for <emph>her,</emph> his sister; to get wealth, rank, honour for <emph>her!</emph> And the tears rolled down Garnet's cheeks, as she thought of the glorious boy, and thought how many, many years it had been since she had even inquired his residence or his destiny.</p>
               <p>"He thought," she said, speaking to herself, in a low, self-communing voice, he thought to have made a fortune before <emph>me</emph>—to have conferred wealth, rank, honour upon <emph>me!</emph> The case might be reversed—it <emph>might!</emph> oh! I wish it <emph>could!</emph> There is only one way in which it could, and that is not impossible, though remote. This <emph>'dream'</emph> that I have enshrined within my heart—this <emph>ideal</emph> of goodness and greatness with which only I will unite—<emph>this</emph> I owe to Hugh. And oh! if he has fulfilled in his manhood the glorious promise of his boy-hood, whatever his external fate may be, if he has fulfilled in <emph>himself</emph> the promise of matured goodness and greatness—then—"</p>
               <p>"<emph>What then?</emph>" said a deep voice at her elbow.</p>
               <p>She started slightly and exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"My guardian!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Miss Seabright, your guardian; who never found you more in need of his guardianship than at present."</p>
               <p>"Sir! why have you followed me here?—where is my servant?"</p>
               <p>"Having come upon him, cowering, several yards behind you, I took the liberty of sending him back to the mainland, by the boat in which you came!"</p>
               <p>Garnet's eyes began to blaze and darken with fearful rapidity. Yet repressing the mounting fire of anger, she strove to ask, calmly,</p>
               <p>"And why <emph>did</emph> you 'take the liberty' of sending my servant away, sir? And why have you further presumed to break upon my privacy?"</p>
               <p>"One question at a time, if you please, Miss Seabright. I sent your servant away that I might have the pleasure of a private interview. I break upon your solitude for the furtherance of the same purpose."</p>
               <p>"And your object, sir?"</p>
               <p>"To come to a full and final reckoning with you!" he said, his manner suddenly becoming threatening.</p>
               <p>Garnet pressed both hands upon her bosom, to restrain its violent throbbings, and answered slowly,</p>
               <p>"I thought, sir, that our last interview, of only this morning, had finally settled all between us? Upon that occasion I told you some harsh truths—and with some violence, which I regret; feeling sorry that the honest verdict of my head<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7856-00000060"/> and heart should not have been delivered with more temperance."</p>
               <p>"And which you shall more deeply regret before we part, scornful girl."</p>
               <p>Her eyes blazed wide and full, like sudden meteors, and then fell into darkness, as she replied, with constrained calmness,</p>
               <p>"I pray you, sir, do not provoke me. I am subject to anger, as other people are to ague and fever."</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha, ha! Is that meant for an appeal or for a threat? If for an appeal, I am not subject to magnanimity, as other people are to insanity!—if for a threat, how ridiculous! Be angry—furious—violent! What <emph>can</emph> you do <emph>now?</emph> Why, thou foolish girl, thou art completely in my power."</p>
               <p>"In <emph>your power!</emph> Not so, insolent creature, 'whom it were base flattery to call a man;' there are no circumstances whatever, that could put me in your power."</p>
               <p>"Why, you absurd woman! look around you. Deep and silent night hangs over the world. You stand alone with me upon a barren, uninhabited, sea-girt isle. How far off do you suppose the nearest human being is from us? How loud a shriek from this lone spot could raise the distant sleepers of the mainland from their beds?"</p>
               <p>Garnet raised her proud head to give some indignant answer, but meeting the gaze of her companion, the burning, scathing anger of her reply froze in horror ere it passed her lips:—for never did night lower over a countenance darker, more dreadful with demoniacal malignity of purpose. Garnet turned her eyes from the baleful glare of Hardcastle to throw them over the lone and desert isle on which they stood, and for the first time a sense of the appalling danger of her situation swam in upon her brain, and, for a moment, nearly overwhelmed her. <emph>His</emph> countenance lighted up with a fiendish triumph. He continued:</p>
               <p>"Yes, Miss Seabright. Yes, Garnet. You have read my look and purpose aright. This <emph>night</emph> must you and I come to a reckoning. This <emph>hour,</emph> haughty girl, shall your pride be humbled. <emph>To-day</emph> you reject my hand with scorn. <emph>To-morrow</emph> shall you sue for it as for life. Ha! already my triumph begins. You grow pale, lady."</p>
               <p>"No!—pale? If my cheek did so belie my soul as to grow pale before a wretch like you, <emph>by</emph> my soul, I would paint it black for the rest of my life, and sell myself to base servitude as being too low for any other sphere. Oh, sir! the sudden revelation of your enormous wickedness shocked me for a single instant, as if I had unexpectedly been confronted with the foul fiend!—that was all! And now I tell you that even on this lone sea isle I do not feel myself to be in your power. I am not the least afraid of you!—<emph>afraid of you?</emph> I am afraid of nothing. I do not know the word. I never <emph>did</emph> know it; and it is not likely that <emph>you</emph> can teach it to me."</p>
               <p>"By Heaven, she defies me even here!" exclaimed Hardcastle, pale with rage, and striding towards her.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Garnet, recoiling a step or two, and standing upon the fragment of rock where she had so often sat in childhood; "yes," she said, reverently raising her eyes and hand, "by <emph>Heaven,</emph> I do defy you! Under the protection of Heaven, in the name of Heaven, I <emph>do</emph> defy you!"</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! <emph>Thou fool!</emph> Why, what shall hinder me now from refuting you and taking my revenge?" he said, again striding towards her.</p>
               <p>"OFF! A parley, I say! Listen to me a moment. God! myself! <emph>yourself</emph> shall hinder you. Mr. Hardcastle, I have this hour conquered a greater and stronger adversary than yourself—<emph>even mine own spirit!</emph> I have overcome my anger; I have the lion of my temper chained beneath my feet. And now, to put <emph>you</emph> down will be a much lighter task—much easier victory. And I tell you now, in coolness, what I told you before in heat, that I am not afraid of you. Nor shall you falsely take the tone towards me of one who has the advantage. I know you, Mr. Hardcastle. And I know your present evil scheme by your former revealed treachery. Heaven purify my soul from the sin of the knowledge! I know that now you think you have me at your mercy, and you intend to terrify me into making conditions with you."</p>
               <p>"In the fiend's name, young woman, what do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>This,</emph> to be explicit: You think to frighton <emph>me,</emph> Garnet Seabright, into the promise to become your wife, and endow you with the broad lands of Mount Calm, upon condition of your sparing me, showing mercy to me, and taking me safely home to Mount Calm."</p>
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7856-00000061"/>
               <p>"By all the demons, girl! I wonder that you should <emph>dare</emph> to give breath to that fear!"</p>
               <p>"NOT fear!"</p>
               <p>"To that <emph>suspicion,</emph> then. I am amazed that you should venture to place these conditions before me."</p>
               <p>"That I should detect and pluck the villanous scheme from your heart, and hold it up before you. Well, I will go further in my defiance of you, Mr. Hardcastle, and tell you that, threaten what you may, I will never, under any circumstances, promise to be your wife. Now, you see that I know I am not at your mercy."</p>
               <p>"By Satan, Miss Seabright, I am thunderstruck at your audacity! Girl, you would be but a sparrow in my grasp! Who could rescue you?"</p>
               <p>"I thank you for the word you used in illustration of my weakness. It recalls in good time the words of a favourite old volume of mine—a book, perchance, with which you have not chanced to meet. Listen! 'Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? Verily, I say unto you, not one of these shall fall to the ground without your Father. Are ye not of more value than many sparrows?' Heaven pardon me! I should not have quoted Scripture here, Mr. Hardcastle. Nevertheless, it helps to make me fearless now. Sir, I will tell you once for all, WHY I do not fear you. First, because I trust in God. Next, because I trust in myself. Finally, because I can something trust in <emph>you!</emph> Cut off as we now are from all communion with our fellow-creatures,—alone, defenceless, unprotected, and at your mercy as I seem—<emph>you dare not harm me, and I know and feel it!</emph> You are not mad or intoxicated; <emph>therefore,</emph> you will not. You are not of a passionate, impetuous nature, therefore you will not. You are a cold-blooded, clear-headed, calculating, forecasting schemer—therefore you will not dare to do me an injury that will end in ruin to yourself. You are a gentleman by birth, education, and position. You are a gentleman—however undeserving of the name—and you will not exchange the title for that of—FELON! I am under the protection of God and of the laws! Lay but your hand in insult on me, and by the Heaven that watches over us, as soon as I reach the mainland, cost what it may to my woman's heart, for the sake of sacred right will I denounce you! Murder me!—sink my body in the sea!—the crime would still be traced to yourself. We were known to have been left here alone."</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! We were known to be left here alone together! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! By none but the negro, and a negro's evidence is not received in any court of law! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!" he laughed, in fiendish triumph. "I have allowed you to spring from my hands, and I have listened to your talking, only to make game of you. Only as a cat lets a mouse run before finally seizing it. But this has lasted long enough!" he exclaimed, ferociously springing towards her, seizing and hurling her from the rock.</p>
               <p>Summoning all her great strength, the intrepid girl, with a mighty effort, threw him from her, and before he could spring upon his prey again, the fragment of rock near them rolled down the slope to the beach—a sudden light glared upon the scene, and a tall woman, wildly clad, and waving a torch above her head, emerged, and stood before them. The sudden irruption of this human being from the bosom of the earth did not astonish Garnet as did the look of Lionel Hardcastle. Struck pale as death, and statue-still, but for the universal tremor that shook his frame, he stood and gazed with stony eyes and chattering teeth upon the apparition. At last—</p>
               <p>"AGNES!" he gasped, shaking as with an ague fit.</p>
               <p>"Yes, pirate!—AGNES!" said the woman, approaching him slowly, holding the torch above her head; then stooping, fixing her eyes intently upon him, and thus creeping towards him, as a lioness preparing for a couch and spring. She paused before him, and still glaring on his face, said, very slowly—"So, pirate! we meet again, <emph>at last!</emph> We meet upon the spot of that outrage which first separated me from home and country, friends and kindred, holiness and Heaven! We meet upon this spot that you would again desecrate with crime! We meet in an hour of retribution! For this have I lived! For now that at last I see my mortal foe, never will I lose sight of you again, until I have put you in the hands of justice! Never will I cease to pursue you, until I hunt you to the scaffold! Never can I die, until I see you dead before me by the death of a felon!"</p>
               <p>While she spoke, with such slow tones of settled hatred and determined vengeance, he held his hand in his bosom. As she ceased speaking—</p>
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7856-00000062"/>
               <p>"FALSE PROPHETESS! YOU DIE NOW!" he thundered, levelling the pistol he held at her head.</p>
               <p>She sprang forward, seized his arm, turning the weapon aside. They struggled violently for a moment, and then the pistol was discharged, and Lionel Hardcastle fell, shot through the chest.</p>
               <p>Frozen with horror, Garnet Seabright drew near, and stooped over the fallen man. Agnes also bent over her prostrate foe a moment, then turning to Garnet, and throwing her wild hair back, she said,</p>
               <p>"I did not kill him, madam; though if I had 'twould have been but just."</p>
               <p>The eyes of the dying man flared open once, and fixed upon the face of Garnet. Raising himself upon his elbow, he said, in low and broken tones,</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, Garnet—and—believe this!—whatever were the hidden sins of my youth—neither piracy nor bloodshed was among them! I was a—prisoner among them! Ship—wreck—plank—waves—picked up—oh, God, forgive me!" His head fell back—he rolled over in a mortal struggle, and then grew still in death.</p>

               <p>"THE Beehive" was the name that had been given by Elsie to her first back-woods home, and afterwards transferred by her to the substantial home of hewn rock that had replaced the log cabin.</p>
               <p>It is late in the afternoon of a blustering March day that I shall again introduce you into the household of Doctor Hardcastle. And it is a large and interesting family for which the doctor is now responsible.</p>
               <p>First, there is himself, as glorious a type of manhood as ever stood in the exposed outer circle of existence, interposing his own body between the storms and cares of life, and the cowering forms of women and children.</p>
               <p>Then, there was his pupil, Hugh Hutton— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"As tall, as sinewy, and as strong</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">As earth's first kings—the Argo's gallant sailors;</l>
                        <l>Heroes in history, and gods in song,"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> and bearing, in that genial dignity of form, countenance, and manner which was the natural expression of great conscious power and goodness, a general resemblance to his master.</p>
               <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7856-00000063"/>
               <p>There was Mrs. Garnet, in her simple widow's dress of black silk, with surplice bosom, inside handkerchief, and little lace cap—somewhat jaded, yet with her graceful form, fair complexion, delicate features, and pensive thoughtfulness of expression, presenting a pleasing image of the "intellectual system of beauty." In charming contrast to her was her daughter, Mrs. Hardcastle, in the full bloom of perfectly developed vital beauty, revealing that marriage and maternity had been to her healthful, sanguine, and joyous organization, what they should be to all women, a continuous accession of new life, health, and happiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>She</emph> had made no mistake in the calculation of <emph>her</emph> future. Active, bustling, often very laborious her lot had been indeed, but suited to her strong and cheerful nature. Her life had been guided, besides, by almost unerring intelligence, sustained by undying love, and cheered by unfailing hope. Anxieties had come, indeed, but these had not been suffered to grow into corroding cares. Sorrow had visited them, too, but this had not been permitted to crush them with despair, or even bow them long in despondency. In the second year of their married life, the Angel of Death had entered their dwelling and lifted their only child from its mother's bosom. Yes, the firstling of their little flock—the first-born of their youthful love, that strong and beautiful child, so full of glorious promise, whose health and life seemed so secure, who was, besides, so watched and tended—that idolized child was born away from their arms, and the hearts of the parents long writhed in the anguish of bereavement before they could understand and receive the Divine message in the infant's little life and death. They had been so independent, so confiding, so happy in their earthly lot, so absorbed in their worldly plans, that they might never even have lifted their eyes to Heaven but for gazing after the soaring wing of their cherub; might never have lifted their hearts to Heaven, but for yearning after the ascended and glorified child; for "where the treasure is, there will the heart be also."</p>
               <p>They had now been married eleven years, and six other children claimed their love and care; six children—boys and girls—with their ages ranging from one year old to nine. They were not rich. They owned the homestead, farm, and improvements upon the latter, but beyond this they did not possess sess a thousand dollars. Doctor Hardcastle's practice was very extensive, and very profitable to—his patients; not very enriching to himself. With a large and growing family, with a strong and sympathetic nature, generous heart, and open hand and purse, how <emph>could</emph> Magnus Hardcastle grow rich? Indeed he must have been much poorer than he was, but for the efficient aid of his "woman-kind."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Garnet had gradually assumed to herself the responsibility of the needle-work of the family.</p>
               <p>Elsie did all the housework.</p>
               <p>Hugh Hutton constituted himself hewer of wood and drawer of water, stock-driver and feeder, gardener, assistant nurse and tutor, doctor's boy, big brother, and helper-in-general to the establishment.</p>
               <p>And he found time, besides, for the systematic and assiduous study of medicine, so that within the last year he had been dubbed by the neighbours the young doctor of the professional firm.</p>
               <p>For the last two years, Hugh had spent the winters in an Eastern city, attending lectures at the Medical College. Upon these occasions, he usually left home upon the first of December, and returned upon the first of March. This was the last winter of his purposed migrations East, and his friends at home were expecting his return with unusual impatience. The first of March had come, however, and he had not yet arrived. A letter from him had informed his friends that he remained in the city, for the purpose of presenting himself before the medical board of examination as a candidate for a diploma.</p>
               <p>The family were now in daily expectation either of his arrival or of another letter. It was upon the evening of the seventh of March, then, that the commodious family-room of the house was occupied by Mrs. Garnet and six children of Elsie's. This room was well-warmed and lighted by a large fire of pine logs in the chimney, and a couple of lighted candles upon the mantel-piece. The supper table was set, and supper was ready to be served as soon as the doctor should get in from his rounds. It had not long to wait; for soon Doctor Hardcastle was seen to ride into the yard, dismount, and take off his saddle-bags and booted spurs, and, great coated as he was, came into the house. As soon as he set foot within the room, the children swarmed upon him like bees upon a sunflower<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7856-00000064"/> flower stalk, or the Lilliputians upon Gulliver; and he lifted and kissed them one by one, but looking around impatiently the while for one he loved even more than all these little ones—to wit, the mother. At last—</p>
               <p>"Where is Elsie, Mrs. Garnet?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Gone, again; I do wish, Magnus, you would prevent her. She makes herself a slave to these poor neighbours of hers. I do really think that she has family cares and toils enough; and that when she has performed her household duties as well as she <emph>always does,</emph> she might consider herself discharged from other social obligations. I do wish you would talk to her very seriously about it. Now to day she has had a very fatiguing time indeed; she was ironing all the forenoon, and this afternoon baking. And yet, this evening, as soon as she had got supper and set the table, she placed the children all in my care, and against my advice, high as the wind is, and deep as the snow is drifted, she took a basket and filled it with provisions, and started to carry it to those poor Millers on the mountain. Indeed, I wish, Magnus, you would tell her not to do it."</p>
               <p>"Me tell Elsie to do or not to do! Whew! Do you know, my dear lady-mother, what is the highest, the <emph>very</emph> highest boon of God to man? FREE WILL—the blessed liberty of going even to the old Nick if they please. There are those so fond of 'freedom,' that they would prefer going to perdition by the exercise of their free will, to being arbitrarily predestined to Heaven!"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps so; but Elsie is not one of those, Dr. Hardcastle. If you were but to hint to your wife that you disapprove and dislike her thus exposing herself, she would stop it at once; she would think it her duty to do so."</p>
               <p>"I know it; and therefore I have to be more chary in meddling with her docile spirit than if she had the self-will and temper of Xantippe. But, ah! do you think it does not make my heart ache to see her expose herself to wind and snow, and to think that I have not yet provided a carriage for her, and to see her work from early morning till night, doing all the housework of the family, and think that I have not yet got a servant for her? And now having brought her to all this, shall I fetter her will? no, by my soul!" said Doctor Hardcastle, with strong emotion.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Garnet arose and went to his side, and stood there, and drew his arm over her shoulder, caressingly, as she said,</p>
               <p>"Magnus, you have made Elsie completely, divinely happy; I mean, as a <emph>mortal woman can be!</emph> No man could do more for his wife, very few can do so much. As for her privations and toils, it is <emph>I,</emph> only <emph>I,</emph> whose weakness caused all that! It was <emph>I</emph> who disinherited her! I!"</p>
               <p>"Hush! hush! a truce to self-criminations! Elsie is the only consistent, rational, equable one in the family, now Hugh is gone. And here she comes, the darling! and without her cloak, as I live! Come, Mrs. Garnet, we will <emph>both</emph> scold her for that. Let's open upon her as soon as she gets in."</p>
               <p>He kissed Alice's hand, and hastened to meet his wife.</p>
               <p>Here she came, cold as the weather was, actually without her cloak.</p>
               <p>He opened the door quickly, and received her in his arms, pressing her cold hands under his chin, to his bosom, to warm them, and drawing her on towards the fire.</p>
               <p>"Now where have you been, facing the wind, and plunging through the snow-drifts?"</p>
               <p>"I have been on the mountain," said Elsie, untying her bonnet, and giving it to one child, and throwing her shawl upon the arms of another. "I have been on the mountain to see those poor Millers. Their little girl, almost barefooted, came over here this afternoon for me to go to her mother, who is confined. I knew they were suffering, and so I filled the basket and went home with the little one."</p>
               <p>"But your cloak, dear! What in the world have you done with your cloak?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! I laid it over Susan Miller and her babe, until I could come home, and send them a blanket. Oh, now don't look so shocked! I am warmly clothed without the cloak; besides, the distance was short, and I ran along fast. Nonsense, now! How is it that children are half their time out running and romping in the cold, without being wrapped up, and only grow more robust by the exposure?" said Elsie, laughing, as she arose, pushed her curls back from her blooming face, and went and lifted her crowing babe from the cradle.</p>
               <p>Then she sat down and nursed it, while Mrs. Garnet, assisted by the eldest child, a little girl of nine years old, began to arrange the supper upon the table.</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7856-00000065"/>
               <p>As Elsie sat and nursed the child, her blooming, joyous face softened into sadness, tears gathered in her eyes, and she sighed deeply, bowing her head over the babe. Magnus was watching her. He was accustomed to her occasional moods of sorrowful tenderness, which, he said, compared with her usual, bright, cheerful temper, as a general, steaming thaw contrasts with a fine, clear, frosty morning. He stooped over the back of her chair, and bending his head close to hers, asked,</p>
               <p>"Of what are you thinking so sadly, Elsie?"</p>
               <p>A slight flush warmed her cheek, and she replied, meekly, without raising her head,</p>
               <p>"An unworthy thought, dearest; at least, ungrateful and presumptuous. I was thinking of that poor family, of the little good that I was able to do them, and the great pleasure it gave me to do even that. I will confess to you all the egotism of my thought—<emph>then</emph> I thought how generous I really was by nature, and how I should delight in doing a great deal of good, if I had the means; and then an emotion of discontent, and a disposition to murmur, came upon me, and I thought what a pity it was that I, so really liberal by nature, should be compelled to repress so many generous impulses—that I should not have a fortune to spend—and I sighed from self-pity. I am ashamed that such ungrateful emotions should have disturbed my heart, and I speak of them now with shame, for now I feel how presumptuous they really were; for why, indeed, should I have a fortune, or anything else that we have not gained by our own toil? I, who am already so happy in the wealth of family affections, Magnus."</p>
               <p>"Dear Elsie, if the material and <emph>temporal</emph> good of mankind were first to be thought of, doubtless then it were better that wealth should be in the hands of the benevolent and philanthropic. But such is not the case. It is the spiritual and eternal welfare both of the individual and of the race that is provided for; and hence each individual is placed in circumstances, not where he can do the most seeming good, but where he can best develop his moral and spiritual nature. Thus, <emph>you have</emph> benevolence. You do not need to have that virtue cultivated by the contrast of your own wealth with another's want, and by the exercise of almsgiving; hence, you are not schooled in prosperity and the duty of beneficence. But, Elsie sie, as you are not perfect, perhaps there are other virtues you lack, and which can be developed only in poverty. But I did not mean to preach you a little sermon, darling. And now, in requital of prosing, I will tell you two pieces of good news—first, that as this is the last year in which we shall be put to any expense for Hugh's college course of lectures, we shall have a hundred or so dollars over our annual expenditures—half of this sum you shall disburse in judicious alms. That is my <emph>first</emph> piece of glad tidings, and my <emph>second</emph> is like unto it—Hugh himself will be home to-night."</p>
               <p>"Hugh home to-night? Oh, you don't say so!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; this afternoon, in passing the post-office, I got a letter that arrived <emph>yesterday,</emph> and that I should have <emph>got</emph> yesterday. And this letter announces the arrival of Hugh this very evening."</p>
               <p>"Hugh coming home this evening? Oh, I am <emph>so</emph> glad! Children, children, did you hear? Brother Hugh is coming home this evening."</p>
               <p>"Brother Hugh is <emph>come!</emph>" said a pleasant voice, as the door opened, and Hugh Hutton stood among them.</p>
               <p>All arose, and Magnus and Elsie hastened to meet him.</p>
               <p>"Dear friends," he said, shaking hands right and left, "I could not resist the desire I felt to go to the window and look in upon you while you were all at your quiet evening occupations. I have been watching you for the last two minutes"</p>
               <p>"You rogue! But come to the fire, come to the fire. Supper is just ready," said Doctor Hardcastle, while Hugh threw off his great coat, and laid it aside with his hat. "Oh, Hugh, we are so glad to see you! Had you a pleasant journey? What time did you get to the village? You have travelled day and night, I am afraid? And then you have walked from the village here?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I couldn't have got a horse for two or three hours, and I really couldn't wait, I was so eager to get home."</p>
               <p>"Dear Hugh, you must he so tired and hungry! Here, sit down in this chair near the fire," said Elsie, pushing a chair forward with one hand, while she held the child with the other arm.</p>
               <p>Hugh threw himself into the chair, and mechanically stretched out his arms and took the crowing, laughing infant<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7856-00000066"/> from its mother, and set it upon his knee, playing with it all the time he talked to others.</p>
               <p>"Oh, have you got your diploma, Hugh? Let's see the document with our own eyes," said Doctor Hardcastle, coming forward.</p>
               <p>"Yes; here it is," said Hugh, rooting in his pocket with one hand, while he hugged the baby up with the other. "Here it is. I took it out of my trunk to bring along as a sort of credential that your years of kindness have not been thrown away upon me, my best friend;" and Hugh produced the parchment, and laid it on the table.</p>
               <p>"Good! good! here it is, Elsie. Come, look! Here is Doctor Hutton's warrant to kill and cure, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">secundum artem.</foreign> Here is the diploma. Here is the prize for which he has toiled so hard—the good of his race."</p>
               <p>"No; not the <emph>good,</emph> but the great <emph>starting place.</emph> Is it not so, Hugh?" said Elsie, coming forward.</p>
               <p>"Yes, true, the starting point. She is worthier than I. The starting point, my boy. And now for a brilliant career. Aim <emph>high,</emph> Hugh. He who aims at the sun may not bring it down, but his arrow will fly highest. You must be more successful than I have been, Hugh. <emph>I</emph> am a useful—if you please—an <emph>extensively</emph> useful member of my profession, and of society. <emph>You</emph> must be a distinguished honour to the faculty and the world! Oh! I have a grand ambition for you, Hugh, my son!"</p>
               <p>"My dear friend! my best friend! all that I am and have I owe to you, to your patient, disinterested teaching of many years. Oh, yes! and all that I may become or may possess, I shall still owe to you! Ah! Doctor Hardcastle! I speak of a debt! I shall never be able to pay the debt I owe to you."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Why, Hugh!</emph>" replied Doctor Hardcastle, throwing his arm affectionately over the shoulder of his young friend, and speaking in a voice as harmonious and gentle as a woman's. "<emph>Why, Hugh!</emph> never let me hear another word of owing anything but brotherly love to <emph>me.</emph> You who have been my second self in all my labours and professional cares; a son to me, except that you have given me no anxiety, but much ease. My brother, companion, confidant! Why, what, ever, could I have done without you, Hugh? What could <emph>any of us</emph> have done without you? Mrs. Garnet! how could you have got along without your son, Hugh? Elsie! how could you have managed to conduct your domestic and business affairs without Hugh? Children! little ones, I say! what would you take for 'big brother?'"</p>
               <p>The last named little shareholders in the Hugh Hutton property, swarmed around him, some with gentle, some with vociferous demonstrations of affection. And their mother laid her hands affectionately on his shoulders, and looking up in his face, said,</p>
               <p>"Dear Hugh! No! no one could possibly have supplied your place to us, since we have known you. You have been, indeed, like a younger brother, or an elder son of the family, only that, as the doctor says, instead of giving us trouble, you have relieved us of it. Oh, Hugh! our dear boy! only be half as eminent as we hope you will be, and we shall be so proud and happy in your success!"</p>
               <p>"Come, come, Elsie, a truce to sentiment! Supper waits, and a man who has staged night and day for a week, and walked three miles to-night, must have a good appetite for his supper, and a strong disposition to his bed. Come; give the babe to his sister, there, and draw your chair up. The children have been suffered to sit up in honour of your arrival, Hugh. They are usually in bed at this hour. Come," said Doctor Hardcastle, seating himself at the table, when all the others were seated, "let's see! What have we here to tempt a traveller's appetite? Mocha coffee—some of that which you sent us by the wagon, Hugh—and cream and butter, such as Elsie only can make. Here are some buckwheat cakes; just try one. Our buckwheat has surpassed itself this year. There, I don't think you ever met with buckwheat cake like <emph>that</emph> in the city. Indeed, I don't think people east of the mountains know what good buckwheat really <emph>is.</emph> Take honey with your cake. <emph>There's</emph> honey for you. The comb clear and clean like amber and frost. Our bees have distinguished themselves this season. There are venison steaks before you. Use the currant jelly with them, Hugh, it is better than the grape. That is the finest venison that I have seen this winter. Ah, Hugh, you should have been with me when I brought that stag down. I shot him on the Bushy Ridge. Great fellow!—eight antlers!—five inches of fat in the brisket!—weighing—how much did<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7856-00000067"/> he weigh, Elsie? No matter. You are laughing, Hugh. What at, sir, pray?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>At you,</emph> and myself, and stag-hunting, and deer-stalking, and story-telling. The truth is, I never hear of stags and antlers, but I think of a fine, bragging tale I was cut short in while telling to my fellow-students at a little farewell supper given by them to me when I was coming away. I was trying to persuade some of them to come out here, and boasting of the country. I was launched into the midst of a grandiloquent eulogium. 'Glorious country, sir!' said I, 'glorious country! sublime mountains, piercing the clouds! mag-<emph>nif</emph>-i-cent forests stretching five hundred miles westward! splendid trees, sir, standing but two feet apart, their trunks measuring three yards in circumference! their luxurious branches inextricably intertwined! and game, sir! superb deer, with antlers six feet apart, bounding through those forests—' 'Where the trees grow but two feet apart, and their branches are inextricably entwined, how the very deuce do they manage to get through them, Hutton?' asked my friend, bringing my magniloquence to a sudden stand. I never was so disconcerted in my life. I knew I had been telling the truth, yet had made it sound like a fiction. At last I answered, 'By Dian, sir, that is <emph>their</emph> business, not <emph>mine, or yours!'</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha, ha! Yes, pretty good! Yet, Hugh, you are not romancing. There <emph>are</emph> parts of the forest where the great trees grow in such thickets as you have described; but they are as impassable to the deer as to us, of course; and then there are superb game in the forest, which may never approach within miles of such thickets. Take another cup of coffee?"</p>
               <p>"No, no, not any more," said Hugh, pushing up his plate and cup.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hardcastle gave the signal, and they arose from the table. The children had also finished their milk and bread, and their mother took them up stairs to be put to bed, while Mrs. Garnet washed up the tea things, and Doctor Hardcastle replenished the fire.</p>
               <p>When the table was cleared away, and Elsie had returned, and they were all gathered around the evening fireside, deeply engaged in telling and in hearing all that had happened to each during the winter's separation, Hugh suddenly clapped his hand to his pocket, with a—</p>
               <p>"Lord bless my soul!"</p>
               <p>"What's the matter?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, was ever such absence of mind!"</p>
               <p>"Never in the world, of course. Only what's it about?" laughed Doctor Hardcastle.</p>
               <p>"Why, a letter—a letter that came in the same stage with myself—a letter from Huttontown, for you. I took it out of the office, and—indeed, I hope I have not lost it," continued Hugh, fumbling first in one pocket, and then in another. "Oh, here it is," he exclaimed, producing the letter, and handing it to the doctor.</p>
               <p>"The superscription is in a strange hand, to begin with—a lady's hand. Who can it be from?" said Doctor Hardcastle, breaking the seal. "Dated 'Mount Calm.'"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Mount Calm!</emph>" exclaimed all three of his hearers, in a breath.</p>
               <p>"Yes, dated 'Mount Calm,' and signed 'Garnet Seabright.'"</p>
               <p>"Garnet Seabright?" exclaimed Mrs. Garnet, in a tone of surprise and displeasure.</p>
               <p>"My little sister Nettie," said Hugh, bending forward with interest.</p>
               <p>"Can you read it aloud, doctor?" inquired Elsie, in a low voice.</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear," replied Doctor Hardcastle, stooping to pick up a second letter, that had fallen out of the first, and retaining the one in his hand while he read the other, as follows:</p>

Suddenly he sprung up, overturning the chair, and dropping the letter, as he exclaimed, vehemently,</p>

               <p>"Oh, doctor, no jesting. This is serious—this is terrible. Only—quick!—can I have your horse?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, certainly, Hugh. But tell me, in one word, what's the matter?"</p>
               <p>"My mother, my long-lost mother, is found, and at Mount Calm, but ill and dying, I fear. There! read Nettie's letter, while I saddle the horse. I must ride at once to the village—the mail stage starts from there at ten o'clock. I must go in it," said Hugh, hastening out.</p>

               <p>"Hope for the best, Hugh. You used to be hopeful. And, oh, Hugh, be sure that we feel your trouble as if it were our own. It <emph>is</emph> our own," said Elsie, laying her hand gently upon him.</p>
               <p>"My horse is ready. I only run in to say good-bye, goodbye, dear friends. Good-bye, Mrs. Garnet—pray that I may not be too late! Good-bye, Mrs. Hardcastle—give my love to the dear children when they ask for me to-morrow. Good-bye, Doctor Hardcastle, my best friend. I will write to you from Mount Calm," said Hugh, shaking and squeezing hands right and left, and then preparing to hasten out.</p>
               <p>"Ain't you going to take your great coat?" asked the doctor, holding it up.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes; I had forgotten it. I haven't time to put it on. I can throw it upon the horse," exclaimed Hugh, hurriedly throwing the garment over his arm. "Once more, good-bye to all."</p>
               <p>"If I had a second horse, or had time to borrow one, I would go with you, Hugh," said Doctor Hardcastle, attending him from the house.</p>

               <p>THE full moon was shining broadly and brightly over the snow-clad hills and plains around Mount Calm, when Hugh Hutton rode up to the front entrance of the mansion in a full gallop. He threw himself from his horse, flung the reins to a servant in attendance, ran up the marble stairs, and without stopping to ring, pushed at once into the house.</p>
               <p>A large hanging lamp lighted up the hall, and its rays fell upon the form of a majestic and beautiful girl, whose presence immediately arrested the impetuous hurry of the visiter. Pausing, he bowed with deference, saying,</p>
               <p>"Miss Seabright?"</p>
               <p>He had always thought of her as Nettie; until he saw her he purposed to have called her Nettie; but this was not to be thought of now, in the presence of this imperial-looking girl, with whom he would no more have ventured upon familiarity than he would have dared to make free with an empress. She, too, had thought of her childhood's companion as plain Hugh, had addressed him as dear Hugh in her letter; but now, when she saw before her this stately and reserved man, she blushed to think of it. And when, with deferential suavity, he repeated his question,</p>
               <p>"I presume—Miss Seabright?"</p>
               <p>She answered, "Yes, Doctor Hutton;" and added, with mournful gentleness, "under happier circumstances I should say that I am very glad to see you, sir; but now I can only tell you truly that you are very, very welcome to Mount Calm." And she offered him her hand.</p>
               <p>"My mother? Miss Seabright! How is my mother?" he inquired, alarmed at the sorrowful manner of his young hostess.</p>
               <p>"Come into the parlour, Doctor Hutton, there is a fire there, and you are chilled," said Garnet, sadly evading the question, and leading the way.</p>
               <p>"My mother?" again inquired the guest, when she had conducted him into the drawing-room.</p>
               <p>"Sit down, pray, sit down, you look so weary—here, near the fire," said his hostess, drawing a chair to the hearth. He dropped into the seat—his prophetic heart already prepared for the words she was about to utter.</p>
               <p>"Your mother, Doctor Hutton, is above all pain and grief now."</p>
               <p>"Dead! dead!" exclaimed Hugh, dropping his head upon his open hands.</p>
               <p>Garnet bent over the side of his chair, and laid her hand gently on his shoulder, and bowed her head until her tears fell upon his hands, but said nothing.</p>
               <p>At last—"How long since?" he asked, raising his head.</p>
               <p>She seated herself by his side, and with her hand gently laid upon his, she replied,</p>
               <p>"Your mother was ill but three days, Doctor Hutton. Upon the first day I wrote to you—upon the third she passed away. It is four days since, so that you see you could not have reached here, even by the utmost speed; and so you have nothing to blame yourself for."</p>
               <p>"Dead! really dead! dead four days!" he exclaimed, burying his face in his hands.</p>
               <p>"No, not dead—<emph>living, in Heaven!</emph> You <emph>know</emph> that—try to <emph>feel</emph> it also," she said, tenderly.</p>
               <p>He did not reply, nor did he speak again for some time, nor did she break upon the sacred silence of his grief by any illjudged attempt at consolation.</p>
               <p>At last he broke forth in bitter lamentation,</p>
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7856-00000070"/>
               <p>"Oh, that she had but lived! Oh, that my poor mother had but lived! That her son might have atoned in the last half of her life for the sorrows of her youth! Oh, that my mother had but lived!"</p>
               <p>"Ah! do not mourn so; believe me, it is far better as it is. There are some lives so wronged, so broken, that nothing but death can set them right. Such a life was hers. There are some sorrows so deep that nothing but Heaven can cure them. Such sorrows were hers. Oh! believe me, by all the loving kindness of the Father, it is better as it is," said Garnet, kindly pressing the hand she held.</p>
               <p>"If I could have seen her but once! Oh, Miss Seabright! I thought but little about her in my boyhood, but as I grew to man's estate, the one secret, cherished hope of my heart was to find my mother—to devote my life to her. Oh, that I could have found her; oh, that I could have reached here in time to have seen her living face but once, so as to have known and remembered it."</p>
               <p>"Again I say it is better as it is. The tender mercy of God spared you the trial. Would you have carried away in your heart the picture of a countenance transiently distorted by delirium, as the only impression of your mother's face? Oh, no! Think of her only as she has been described to you in her youthful beauty, or think of her as she is now, in her immortal beauty. She has always been shrined in your heart as a beautiful and sacred memory, and hope. Let it be so still, and let the hope be immortal."</p>
               <p>She ceased speaking, and both relapsed into silence, that lasted until the door opened, and a servant entered, bringing coffee and other refreshments upon a waiter.</p>
               <p>"Wheel the table forward here, and set the waiter upon it, and then you may go, Pompey," said Miss Seabright, in a low voice. The man obeyed and left the room.</p>
               <p>When they were alone together again, Miss Seabright poured out a cup of coffee, and offered it to her guest. He thanked her, but declined it, and dropped his head again upon his hands, and fell into silence and despondency.</p>
               <p>Miss Seabright put the cup of coffee down and came and sat by his side, and laid her hand upon him again, and said, softly,</p>
               <p>"I feel how you suffer, Doctor Hutton; and I can imagine that when we have lost a dear friend or near relative, especially a parent, we should think it almost a sin to take comfort in any way, and selfishness even to refresh the wasted, wearied frame with needful food and sleep. It is so natural to feel so. Fasting and vigil are first compelled by anxiety and grief, and afterwards, when all is over, and when nature has reasserted her claims, and made us feel the need of food and rest—still often the heart's fond superstition will not yield, and fasting and vigil are offered as a tribute to the memory of the lost. It is so natural—but so wrong, Doctor Hutton—the rent garments, and the torn hair, and the ashes sprinkled on the head, and the inordinate worship of grief, belong to Pagan bereavement, which is 'without hope, and without God'—not to Christian sorrow, which should be calmed by resignation, and cheered by faith. My friend, you are very weary and depressed—you need refreshment. Come, <emph>Hugh,</emph> lift up your head; take this coffee from my hand—Nettie's hand."</p>
               <p>As she stooped over him offering the cup, the ends of her soft ringlets touched his brow, and her breath fanned his cheek. He raised his head, received the refreshment, and gratefully pressed the gentle hand that gave it. When he had drained the cup, and set it down, he said,</p>
               <p>"Miss Seabright, how much I thank you for your sympathy and kindness none can know but God. Dear and gentle comforter, tell me, now, the facts of this sad discovery. When did my mother return, and under what circumstances?"</p>
               <p>"Had you not better defer hearing this story for the present, Doctor Hutton? You look so tired. Retire early, and sleep well to-night, and to-morrow morning I will tell you everything you desire to know."</p>
               <p>"Miss Seabright, I have not slept since I received your letter, telling me of my mother's advent and illness. I shall never be able to sleep until I have heard all you have to tell me of that mother's history and sorrows. But, Miss Seabright, I beg your pardon—you are so good, that your very goodness has made me selfish, and forgetful of the trouble I may give you. You are doubtless fatigued, and should not be longer harassed by the presence of an exacting egotist like me. If so, let me bid you good-night," said Doctor Hutton, rising.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, sit down; besides, I cannot let you go to-night. You are to remain with us, certainly, to-night—and as many<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7856-00000071"/> more days and nights as your convenience will permit. Sit down; I am not the least wearied, and if, indeed, you think you will rest better after having heard the story I have to tell you, why, of course, I will willingly tell it. Yes, and upon second thought, I feel that it is better you should hear it tonight. To-night let the grave close in faith over the sad past. To-morrow, you will arise with new hope for the future."</p>
               <p>They both resumed their seats. And Miss Seabright related to him the story of the nightly light seen on Hutton's Isle; her visit there, to ascertain the cause; her guardian's unexpected arrival; the sudden apparition of Agnes; the encounter and the death of Lionel Hardcastle by the accidental discharge of the pistol. Having reached this point of her story, she went on to say:</p>
               <p>"At the first appearance of your mother, I saw by her wild look and frenzied manner, that reason had fled. But instantly after the fall of Lionel Hardcastle, the sudden change, the quiet manner with which she exculpated herself from the suspicion of blood-guiltiness, deceived me so that I mistook for sanity that mood which was only the reaction of frenzy—or at best, a lucid interval of madness. As soon as I had ascertained the victim to be quite dead, and had collected my thoughts for action, I determined to return to the mainland and rouse the magistrate, Judge Wylie. The unhappy woman was sitting upon the ground, with her head bowed upon her hands, and her wild hair streaming all around her, like a veil. I spoke to her, and told her my purpose, and asked her to accompany me. She gave me no reply. I spent a long time in trying to persuade her to get up and go with me—but I could not get a word or gesture from her. I made no more impression on her than if she had been a statue. Finally, I was obliged to leave her for the purpose of procuring assistance. I went down to the beach, got into the skiff, took the paddle, and rowed swiftly to the landing at Point Pleasant? I found all the family there still up, owing to the decease of old Mrs. Wylie, who had just expired. Judge Wylie, with his usual promptitude, gave me all the help that was needful. I returned with the party to Hutton Isle, where we found the unfortunate woman in the same posture in which I had left her. I spoke to her again, and with no more success than before. Finding it impossible to make any impression upon her, I requested Mr. Ulysses Roebuck, who had the command of the party, to lift her up gently and convey her to the boat. He attempted to do so, but on being raised she broke into sudden frenzy. Doctor Hutton, spare me and yourself the details of this illness—it is over now. It is sufficient to say, that she was brought hither, that she had the best medical attendance, and the best nursing that could be procured. She recovered her reason about an hour before her death, and asked to see a clergyman. Mr. Wilson, the Methodist preacher, attended her. Of the circumstances of her forcible abduction, and the misfortunes that ensued to her, she refused to make any revelations, saying that the dying should not drop a fire-brand into the circle they were leaving. When told that she had a son, she blessed you, and left this message for you, that 'Forgiveness is the only remedy for some wrongs;' and of herself, she said, that 'Death was the only rectifier of some lives.' She died at set of sun—camly and hopefully. At some future day I will show you where they have laid her. As for the unhappy man who met his death so suddenly—the Coroner's jury sat upon his case before his remains were permitted to be removed from the Isle. The body was then conveyed to Hemlock Hollow for burial. Old Mr. Hardcastle has not been able to leave his bed since the shock of his son's sudden death threw him upon it. It is supposed that he cannot recover." This Miss Seabright added with the purpose of partially diverting the mind of her guest from dwelling too intently upon the circumstances of his mother's death.</p>
               <p>At the close of her recital Doctor Hutton remained silent for a few minutes, and then taking and pressing her hand, he thanked her, with much emotion, for the care she had bestowed upon his mother.</p>
               <p>Miss Seabright rang for night-lamps, and when they were brought, directed the servant to attend Doctor Hutton's leisure, and when he felt inclined to retire, to show him to his chamber. Then bidding her guest good-night, she left the room.</p>
               <p>The next morning Doctor Hutton came down very early and found Miss Seabright already in the drawing-room. She advanced to meet him, holding out her hand. After the usual courteous inquiries about health, &amp;c., Doctor Hutton said,</p>
               <p>"Miss Seabright, I scarcely know how to pardon myself for<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7856-00000072"/> my forgetfulness of an aged and worthy relative last evening; but pray tell me now, how is my old aunt?'</p>
               <p>"Miss Joe! oh, very well, indeed. The only mark of infirmity I can perceive in her is her wish to go to bed earlier now than heretofore. She had retired before you arrived last night, and I would not have her disturbed. She is in the breakfast-room superintending breakfast. She knows that you are here, but does not know that you have risen. Shall I send for her?"</p>
               <p>"If you please, Miss Seabright. I have not seen my aunt for two years. I have generally made it a point to come and see her every year or two since I first left her, and should have visited her this spring even, had not your letter summoned me now. Ah! here she comes."</p>
               <p>Miss Joe came in smiling and weeping, and wringing her nose, and wiping her spectacles with her check apron, and as soon as she saw her nephew, she ran to him and fell in his arms, laughing and crying and talking all at once, and not regaining self-possession until she became alarmed for the propriety of her cap and kerchief, when she extricated herself, smoothing down her apron, and exclaiming,</p>
               <p>"There, Hugh! There, Neffy! You're not a baby now; don't tumble my cap and my handkercher—there's no sense in it;" though, dear old soul, the fault lay all the while in her own fondling—not Hugh's. "<emph>There,</emph> come to breakfast now. It is all on the table waiting, and will get cold."</p>
               <p>Doctor Hutton offered his arm to Miss Seabright, and they went in to breakfast.</p>
               <p>After the meal was over, Doctor Hutton made a motion to depart, but Miss Joe vigorously opposed his purpose, supplicating him to remain at Mount Calm for only a few days, if not longer. Miss Seabright joined her invitation to the old lady's entreaties, and Doctor Hutton finally consented to stay, and retired to his room to write letters to his friends in the West.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The few days of Doctor Hutton's projected stay at Mount Calm grew into a week, and the week was stretching into a month, and still Hugh Hutton found it daily more difficult to tear himself away from Garnet Seabright, for every time he would make an attempt to go, she would say,</p>
               <p>"Not yet, Doctor Hutton. Not <emph>just</emph> yet! Stay till tomorrow;" and she would <emph>think,—"Why does he not speak?</emph> He loves me! He stays here at my bidding. He must know that I love him, too! Why does he not speak? Will he go away without an explanation? Can it be that my fortune and his own lack of wealth hinders him? There are some men so proud that they will not marry an heiress, lest it be said of them that they owe all they have to their wives. But such a thought would never enter the head of my noble Hugh! He would not elevate money on one side or the other into importance enough to divide two hearts that love. Yet there is <emph>some</emph> reason, and some <emph>good</emph> reason why, when his eyes and tones and gestures tell me every hour that he loves and esteems me, his <emph>words</emph> never do." And then sometimes when alone, she would break forth, impatiently, thus—"<emph>Indeed,</emph> I won't bear this much longer! No, <emph>that</emph> I won't! I sha'n't have Hugh's heart and my own tormented in this way to no good purpose! I will make him tell me what it all means! Feeling very sure he loves me, he shall tell me what all this hesitation means."</p>
               <p>Such would be her impatient resolve, but Garnet never could bring herself to lead her lover on to any explanation, until one night, when Hugh, for the dozenth time, made known that he should leave Mount Calm the next morning. It was after supper, when Miss Joe retired, and they were playing a game of backgammon together. Miss Seabright looked up from her dice, and said,</p>
               <p>"Well, Doctor Hutton, since you <emph>are</emph> going to-morrow, and I feel that we cannot justly keep you from your business any longer, I wish, before you depart, to ask your advice—I—"</p>
               <p>"Well, Miss Seabright?"</p>
               <p>"I—you know that my social position is a very singular one."</p>
               <p>"It is indeed, Miss Seabright."</p>
               <p>"Responsible as I am for the faithful stewardship of a very large fortune—"</p>
               <p>"It is indeed, in your case especially, a very heavy responsibility."</p>
               <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7856-00000073"/>
               <p>"Yes—and I have neither father nor brother to aid and counsel me."</p>
               <p>"My poor counsel is at your command always, Miss Seabright."</p>
               <p>"Thank you! It is in relation to the stewardship of Heaven's goods intrusted to me, that I wish your advice. One should not live for themselves alone, you know."</p>
               <p>"Assuredly not," said Doctor Hutton, giving her his close attention.</p>
               <p>Miss Seabright then related at length certain very judicious and extensive schemes of benevolence, and desired his opinion upon them.</p>
               <p>"Your plans of usefulness and beneficence would be both wise and good, reflecting honour on your head and heart, but that they lack the proper foundation of all schemes of action."</p>
               <p>"What is that?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Justice.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Justice?"</p>
               <p>"JUSTICE!"</p>
               <p>"I do not understand you in the least!"</p>
               <p>"Miss Seabright, have you ever learned how it was that you came into possession of all this estate?"</p>
               <p>"My dear godfather gave it to me."</p>
               <p>"Do you know why he conveyed it to you in his life, rather than bequeath it to you at his death?"</p>
               <p>"No"</p>
               <p>"Because, had he merely bequeathed it to you, his will would have been set aside by our courts of justice in favour of his wife and child."</p>
               <p>"Well, he <emph>did</emph> convey it to me! It is mine, at all events!" said Garnet, with a flushed cheek and brow.</p>
               <p>"And yet he had a wife and daughter whom he beggared to enrich you—was this right?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Right! Yes,</emph> it was right! He cut off a fugitive wife and a rebellious daughter! <emph>Right!</emph> Yes, it was <emph>right! he</emph> did it, and he could have done no <emph>wrong! therefore</emph> it was right! Right! Yes, it <emph>was</emph> right! Who dares to gainsay it?" she exclaimed, with her bosom heaving, and her colour rising.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Miss Seabright, it is an ungracious task indeed, to unveil before you the true character and hidden motives of your benefactor, of one whom you have always looked upon with affection and respect—"</p>
               <p>"STOP!" exclaimed Garnet, breathlessly, and pressing both hands upon her bosom, as was her custom, when trying to repress an irruption of anger. "STOP! If you are about to breathe a syllable reflecting upon the memory of my godfather—HOLD! I will not hear a breath, believe me! A word that should wound his good name, would transfix my own heart."</p>
               <p>"For your dear sake, Miss Seabright, I will respect the name of General Garnet—but for the dearer sake of justice, I will plead the cause of his widow and daughter."</p>
               <p>"Of <emph>his</emph> widow and daughter! I am not—the Lord knows it!—ungrateful, ungenerous, or cruel; I will largely dower them both."</p>
               <p>"You will do no such thing, Miss Seabright! I trust there is too much latent nobility in your character to permit you to add such 'insult' to their 'injury.'"</p>
               <p>"Then <emph>what is it</emph> that you wish me to do?"</p>
               <p>"What your conscience shall, after you understand the matter, dictate to be done. He who gave you the Mount Calm estate had no just right to do so. The whole of the estate came by his <emph>wife,</emph> and should descend to <emph>her</emph> daughter. It was held by her family, the Chesters, for two hundred years."</p>
               <p>"Well, I think two centuries quite long enough for any one family to hold any one landed estate. I think it quite time the property had passed into other hands," said Miss Seabright, firmly. Then she added, "Besides, my godfather must have had a legal right to the property, else he could not have conveyed it to me."</p>
               <p>"Miss Seabright, if you will permit me, for justice' sake, I will tell you the whole history of the transaction by which General Garnet became legally possessed of the Mount Calm estate. It is right—it is <emph>necessary</emph> that you should know it."</p>
               <p>"Say on, sir."</p>
               <p>Doctor Hutton began, and, softening as much as possible, for her sake, the conduct of General Garnet, related the atrocious history of his life and actions,—first how, aided by her father, he sundered the engagement existing between Alice Chester and Milton Sinclair, and forcibly married the heartbroken child; their wedded life of tyranny on his side and<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7856-00000074"/> sufferance on hers; the separation of the mother and daughter; in after years of betrothal of Elsie and Magnus; his subsequent attempt to break their engagement, from mercenary motives; his furious anger at their marriage; the arts by which he gained from his wife a deed of the Mount Calm estate; his revenge in disinheriting his daughter; the taunts and cruelties by which he had nearly caused the death of his wife, and had finally driven her from him; and lastly, the legal acumen with which, for the sake of more surely impoverishing his wife and child, he had <emph>conveyed</emph> the estate, instead of <emph>bequeathing</emph> it, knowing that the will, upon account of its crying injustice, would have been set aside by the courts, in favour of the widow and daughter.</p>
               <p>"There, Miss Seabright, that is the way in which your godfather first, and you after him, came into possession of the Mount Calm property."</p>
               <p>Garnet Seabright had not listened patiently to this recital. Many times her large, heavily-fringed eyes blazed and darkened—her cheeks crimsoned and faded, and though she pressed both hands to her chest, her bosom heaved and fell like the waves of the sea. Many times she interrupted him, and nothing, perhaps, but the felt law of justice, enabled Doctor Hutton to persevere to the close of his ungracious and unwelcome narrative.</p>
               <p>When he had closed by revealing the hypocrisy, treachery, and revenge of General Garnet, all the colour was suddenly struck out from her face, as though she had been blasted by a stroke of lightning, so white, so still and aghast was her aspect. Doctor Hutton hastened to her side, and took her hand. At the touch, she rose in trepidation, and scarcely heeding what she said, exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Not now! Not one single word now! I must be alone, or die! To-morrow!—to-morrow I will hear you!" and hurried, or rather reeled from the room.</p>

               <p>THE next morning she appeared at the breakfast table, with a face so pale and stern, as almost to awe the good Miss Joe from making an inquiry as to her health. And when at last the old lady asked her if she were not well, she replied, curtly,</p>
               <p>"An ill night's rest!" and the questioning ceased.</p>
               <p>When she had retired to the drawing-room, Doctor Hutton followed her thither. He found her standing on the rug, and resting her forehead against the mantel-piece. Her long ringlets hanging low, concealed her face from his view, until she turned around and said, in a very low voice,</p>
               <p>"Doctor Hutton, you are not going away this morning, are you?"</p>
               <p>"No, Miss Seabright!—no, Garnet. I did not rouse a war in your soul to leave you until peace should be restored."</p>
               <p>"I do not know why you should say there is a war," said Garnet, in a deep voice.</p>
               <p>"I can see it. That fiery blood that has left your brow and cheeks and very lips of a gray paleness, has mustered somewhere. Besides, I know you, Garnet. You were always<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7856-00000075"/> very transparent to me. I know that in your soul the powers of good and evil are drawn out in battle array against each other."</p>
               <p>With an adjuring gesture, she left her position, and, crossing the room, threw herself into a chair. He watched her some few minutes, where she sat with her pale brow resting on one hand, and the other hanging listlessly down, and then he slowly crossed the room, and dropping upon one knee by her side, raised her hand to his bosom, and said, in a voice deep with passion.</p>
               <p>"Miss Seabright!—Nettie, my dear sister!—my wife, if you will bless me so!—I <emph>wish</emph>—I <emph>do</emph> wish I had a kingdom to offer you to replace this Mount Calm. As it is, I have only myself, and an affection, an affection, Nettie, that—Oh, I cannot tell you in a few words, a few seconds, that love which it will take all the years we live together to express, to live out!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Hugh!" she said, in broken accents, "if you knew where this rack screws and strains my heart-strings most—to think that one whom I always loved and honoured with a passionate enthusiasm as the very first in human excellence—but no more of that! Not <emph>my</emph> lips shall breathe one word of blame, though all earth and Heaven cry shame on his memory!" said Garnet, as her dark eyes smouldered, and flashed, and sank again, as she breathed, in heart-broken tones—"No more of that! Oh, God, that I could say to my <emph>thoughts,</emph> as to my <emph>tongue</emph>—'No more of that!'"</p>
               <p>And scarcely heeding her lover, she arose, threw back her falling hair, pressed both hands upon her bosom, and passed out of the room.</p>
               <p>It was late in the evening before he saw her again. He went into the library after the lamps were lighted, and found her sitting at one of the reading tables, with her head bowed down upon her folded hands. He went and sat by her, saying,</p>
               <p>"Garnet, dearest, do not keep your thoughts and troubles all to yourself; let me share them. Come, come," he continued, caressing her, "this is unkind! I have had a very solitary day."</p>
               <p>"A solitary day! I wish you joy of it! <emph>Mine</emph> has been 'peopled with the furies.' Oh, Hugh, even in my wild infancy fancy I was such an ambitious child! Though Heaven knows there was nothing around me to foster ambition, unless it were the want of everything, and the study of fairy tales! Oh, Hugh! if the little wild water-witch of the isle was ambitious—"</p>
               <p>"'The woman, gifted with beauty, talent, wealth, and largest liberty, is a hundred times more so,' you would say," said Hugh. "But, Garnet, do you know there is an ambition more noble than all others—that of moral greatness! Garnet, <emph>you</emph> have the opportunity granted to few—the opportunity of moral heroism!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Hugh! before I saw you, I had great schemes! great schemes!"</p>
               <p>"I know it, dear Garnet; but they did not demand the great moral force required of you to-day."</p>
               <p>"But since you came, Hugh—" Here her voice broke down, and she dropped her head upon the table for a few minutes. Then lifting it up again, she held her veil of ringlets back, and said—"But since you came, Hugh, all schemes have given place to one; I had been living in such a golden dream, dear Hugh! Oh, listen! You know when we were two poor children, obliged to pick our frugal meal of maninosies from the beach, and I, inspired by the Arabian Nights Entertainments, would be talking my wild, childish talk about sudden riches, and fairy grandmothers, you said you had a fairy in your head who could convert the sand and clay into gold-dust and precious gems?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I remember. It was when I dreamed of being an agriculturist."</p>
               <p>"And you promised you would make a fortune for me; confer rank, and wealth, and honour upon me?" she asked, smiling very sadly.</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes, Nettie!" he answered, solemnly. "Yes, and I hold myself bound to redeem that boyish pledge. Doubly bound now, Nettie; for I must repay you for all you lose."</p>
               <p>"Oh, stop!—hear me out. Well—heigho! I thought if Hugh could give Garnet a fortune, he might also take one from her—take one with her. Oh, Hugh! I knew I could not confer upon <emph>you</emph> rank or honour, you must make them for both of us, but I dreamed that I could give you wealth to aid in doing it. Hugh, listen! I heard you say that you<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7856-00000076"/> would like to travel, and spend some time in London, Paris, and at some of the German cities, for the sake of perfecting your medical knowledge. I then heard you regret that necessity which urged your immediate settlement in some Western neighbourhood, to commence practice. Well, Hugh, I dreamed that necessity would be obviated. I dreamed, Hugh, that we would make a bridal tour to Europe, and sojourn in all these capitals, while you pursued your studies at your ease. Now my dream is over!—over!"</p>
               <p>"God bless you for saying that, Garnet! God bless you for saying that! The dream is over!—the dream is over!—the <emph>battle</emph> is over, and your moral sense has nobly conquered; you will yield up this property!"</p>
               <p>"Over!—the battle—the <emph>doubt</emph> over! No! no! no! no! I did not say that either!" exclaimed Miss Seabright, her whole aspect changing. Suddenly rising, with flashing eyes and burning cheeks, and pacing the room with rapid steps—"Over! no! Man! man! is it a flower, a ring, an orange you ask me for, that I should give it up without a struggle—as a matter of course? Give up this estate! why, I should be insane, frantic, frenzied! nothing short of ranting mad! Why, Hugh, is there a man, woman, or child, now living on this earth, who would voluntarily yield up an estate which they might keep—an estate of two millions of dollars—for—what?—a point of conscience! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Come, answer me!" she exclaimed, throwing herself into a chair, with a strange, unnatural air of audacity. "Say! is there a man, woman, or child, living, who would do this?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. <emph>Any</emph> child would do it. There is one man I know who would do it. There is one woman who <emph>will</emph> do it."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Me?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You!"</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Why, Doctor Hutton—any one, if they were <emph>very</emph> wealthy, might give up a thousand—<emph>ten</emph> thousand dollars, for conscience' sake—but two millions! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Why, Doctor Hutton! I am a human being, subject to like passions and foibles with other people. I rather <emph>like</emph> wealth, handsome houses and furniture, and dress and jewels, and servants and equigages, and travelling, sight-seeing, and change of scene. And if there were nothing to be given up but <emph>these,</emph> how great would be the sacrifice. But then I have magnificent plans of extensive philanthropy; glorious prospects of social distinction. <emph>And to renounce these!</emph> How tremendous the renunciation!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Nettie! with your usual perfect openness, you have revealed the very death-throes of your expiring selfishness. For your selfishness—will die! Conscience will conquer it. The cup of earthly prosperity is brimful, and at your lips—but you will put it, untasted, away. I know you will. I have perfect faith in you."</p>
               <p>"Hugh, you kill me! You madden me! Have you no pity? I believe you think you will make me do it!" she exclaimed, starting up, and pacing the floor rapidly. "I do believe you fancy that you will make me give up this estate, by asserting confidently that I will do it."</p>
               <p>"I think your true nobility of soul will constrain you to it."</p>
               <p>Suddenly she stopped, threw both hands to her breast, and turned so ghastly pale, that Doctor Hutton sprang to her side, exclaiming,</p>
               <p>"Garnet, you are ill! is it possible that this struggle produces such an effect upon you?"</p>
               <p>She dropped her hands from her bosom, her colour returned, and, smiling strangely, she said,</p>
               <p>"Why, Hugh, do you fancy that I am such a spoiled child as to grow ill because I want to have my own in all things? No! But as I hurried up and down the room in such a heat, I was arrested suddenly by a quick, sharp pang; a deathly pang that caught away my breath. It seemed to me as if another movement would have been fatal; it seemed as if in the very flow of my high tide of life and audacity, the skeleton fingers of death had closed around my heart and squeezed it. It is gone now. Nay, now, nonsense, Hugh. Do not look at me with such a death-warrant in your eyes. If you look at your patients that way you will frighten them to death!" she said, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Garnet, sit down. There, give me your wrist. Did you ever experience this symptom before?"</p>
               <p>"Symptom! Bless you, <emph>Doctor</emph> Hutton, it is not a symptom. Doctor Hutton, if you are out of practice, and wish to get your hand in again, I refer you to all the hypochondriacal<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7856-00000077"/> old men and women on the plantation, who will delight your professional heart with 'symptoms' for any length of time."</p>
               <p>"Garnet, you <emph>have</emph> been too much agitated to-day, for one of your excitable temperament. Go to rest."</p>
               <p>"I will—I feel, for the very first time in my life, a little exhausted," she replied, rising, and extending her hand.</p>
               <p>He drew her unresisting to his bosom, pressed a kiss upon her brow, and led her to the door.</p>
               <p>He did not see her again until the next day at dinner, when she appeared in full dress, and looking grandly beautiful, joyous, and decided. He congratulated her. She smiled exultingly, and said,</p>
               <p>"I feel well, very well, because I have come to a decision."</p>
               <p>When dinner was over, she challenged him for a walk on the terrace around the roof of the house. When they had reached this elevated site, she advanced to the front of the balustrade, and stretching one hand out towards the magnificent prospect, she said,</p>
               <p>"Look, Hugh! Saw you ever a fairer scene?"</p>
               <p>"It is indeed a sublime and beautiful prospect."</p>
               <p>"And has it no more interest than that? Listen, Hugh. All these waving forests and rolling hills and plains, all these fields and barns and granaries, all these orchards, vineyards and gardens, these terraces, with their statues, fountains and conservatories, this mansion-house, with its stately chambers, halls, and saloons—<emph>is ours</emph>—is our beautiful, our superb home, if you will take it—when you take me," she said, turning to him.</p>
               <p>"Nettie, when Satan wished to tempt Christ, he took Him up into a very high mountain, and showed Him the kingdoms of the earth and the glory thereof, and said, 'All these will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and worship me.'"</p>
               <p>"Upon my soul I thank you for the parallel you have chosen to run between me and Satan!" exclaimed Miss Seabright, with a burning cheek.</p>
               <p>"You misconstrue me, dearest Garnet. You do not tempt me. I am not tempted. It is the <emph>Christ in you</emph>—the angel in you—the good in you that is tempted by Ambition."</p>
               <p>"Hugh! Hugh! It is not for myself now so much as for <emph>you</emph> that I am ambitious. With the power this fortune would give, when joined to your talents, you could become so distinguished."</p>
               <p>"Again, Garnet. When Satan tempted Christ, it was not through any puerile idea, but through the grandest passion of the human soul—the passion by which the great Archangel fell—Ambition. But, I tell you, Garnet, that if ambition be the most glorious of human passions, <emph>remorse</emph> is the most terrible. And, too often, one follows the other as surely as night follows day."</p>
               <p>She did not reply, and both remained silent for a few minutes, when, taking her hand, he said, impressively,</p>
               <p>"Do not think me ungrateful, dearest Garnet. Very deeply do I feel the blessing of your sweet love, very highly do I estimate the honour of your ambition for me. But listen, dearest. In erecting your edifice of earthly happiness, it would be well to lay the <emph>basement sure.</emph> You might possess and inhabit a princely palace, luxuriously furnished, yet you would not glory in its splendour, or even enjoy a moment's repose under its roof, if you knew its <emph>foundation to be insecure</emph>—that at any instant in the midst of enjoyment, it might suddenly fall and crash you under its magnificent ruins. Garnet, such an insecure dwelling-place, such a transient phantasmagoria, is any plan of earthly happiness not based upon the principles of justice. Such, Garnet, is your edifice of enjoyment,—for you will feel that Death, which hangs over us all at all times, may at any moment summon you from its possession to place you at the bar of Eternal Justice, to answer for the sin of your soul. And your ill-gotten splendours here will be your condemnation hereafter. Oh, believe me, dear Garnet, to say nothing of the sublime beauty of faith displayed in the sacrifice of earthly interests to Heavenly prospects—of temporal pleasures to eternal joys—there is <emph>great good sense</emph> in seeking 'first the Kingdom of God, and His righteousness;' for, look you, I may gain wealth and renown, but if my fortune is <emph>ill-gotten,</emph> I cannot fully enjoy it, for knowing that at any time my soul may be snatched from its possessions to the Bar of God, and stained with falsehood and injustice as it is, be hurled thence to perdition. But, on the other hand, if my fortune is founded upon righteousness, and built up with the blessing of God, then I may be as rich and as great as I please, and yet enjoy this world with a surer joy, for knowing that it leads<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7856-00000078"/> to a better and an eternal one. Life, dear Garnet, is a journey to the Judgment Seat. In all your plans, therefore, of life's journey, <emph>look to its end.</emph> If you set out upon a road that you knew was leading you to misery—no matter how fine the carriage in which you travelled, how soft the cushions on which you sat, how beautiful the country through which you passed—you could not enjoy it, for every mile that should draw you nearer to its close would increase your uneasiness, for you would know its end to be misery. Such a journey, dear Garnet, will be your life, if you set out upon it with ill-gotten riches. Now, look on the other side of the question. If you should start upon a journey that you know will bring you finally to a haven of rest and honour—no matter how common your vehicle, how rough your road, how ordinary the landscape, how full of unpleasant accidents—you will endure it, and at every stage with more cheerfulness, for knowing that it brings you nearer to its end, and that its end is repose and happiness. <emph>And,</emph> if your journey should be pleasant, its very pleasures will be enhanced by the knowledge that its goal is rest, honour, and joy. Such a journey will <emph>our</emph> lives be, dearest love. You will resign this estate. We will marry, and feeling the smile and blessing of God upon us, we will go forth strongly and hopefully, and labour for our living. We shall have some early struggles, but God will be with us. He will bless our sacrifice, and we shall finally prosper. And while weeks are slipping into months, and months gliding into years, we shall really enjoy the very making of a fortune, taste prosperity piecemeal, and get the good of every morsel. Every little comfort that we may be able to add to our daily domestic life will be relished the more that we have felt the want of it, and blessed the more that it has come to us from God. And for our future years, I hope highly, but may not prophesy. They are in the hands of God," he said, raising his hat with profound reverence. Then his tone changing to one of deep tenderness, he stretched forth his arms, and said: "Come, Nettie! Come, my darling wife. You will give up all this ill-starred wealth, and trust in God to restore you an hundred fold."</p>
               <p>Pale and drooping with excess of feeling, she sank upon his bosom, murmuring,</p>
               <p>"Oh, God bless you, Hugh! Large and full heart, God bless you! Where could I find my life but in you? But, oh, dear Hugh, do not be a martyr at this rational age of the world! Take my fortune with me."</p>
               <p>"Never, Nettie! Never, so strengthen me Heaven! When I take you I will take no sin with you."</p>
               <p>She started, burst from his embrace, and broke forth with passionate vehemence:</p>
               <p>"SILENCE! I will not hear you. I will never give up my privileges. I will NOT be a fanatic to please you. Oh! look at me, Hugh; and do not think I speak from vanity, but from a war of conflicting passions, that rends my soul in twain. <emph>Do</emph> I look like one to be condemned to poverty, and privation, and domestic toil, and drudgery? I will speak out, though, in your eyes, I convict myself of vanity and presumption. You never called me beautiful in words, but you have said so with your eyes a thousand times. Oh, Hugh, I valued my beauty as I did my wealth, for your sake. But should I be beautiful in poverty? <emph>You know that I know what poverty is!</emph> Look at my hair, Hugh. Yesterday you took the whole mass up in your hand and looked at it as at a treasure, so proudly; then you singled out a ringlet and examined it as a strange beauty, so curiously. Now look at the ringlets again. Do you think it requires no care to keep them so soft and glossy, and in such full curl? Why a rose-bush will not bloom in full glory unless it is cared for and tended; neither will my beauty. Hugh, I do not know why I may not venture to speak before you what I dare to think before God. I know that my soul's habitation is beautiful; and it seems to me fit that it should be so, and that its beauty should be enhanced by rich drapery, and preserved from all uses. How could that be done in bitter poverty?"</p>
               <p>"Garnet," he answered, solemnly, "the <emph>soul</emph> is greater than its temple. Would you preserve the temple sacred from all uses, yet degrade the greater Deity within it? Would you preserve the delicacy of your beauty, and clothe your form in gorgeous apparel, by an action that would stain your soul with foul dishonesty?"</p>
               <p>"DON'T talk to me any more. You will drive me frantic. DISHONESTY! that is the low vice of ignorant and debased<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7856-00000079"/> natures, for which they are sometimes sent to the state's prison."</p>
               <p>"And yet which is more excusable 'in ignorant and debased natures,' than in intelligent and exalted ones," said he, sternly.</p>
               <p>"DISHONESTY! What have I to do with that? This estate is legally mine. To keep it is not even injustice. WHY do you talk to me so?" she exclaimed, tearing at her bosom, as she wildly walked up and down the terrace, as if to pluck away the burning pain there. "WHY do you torture—exasperate—<emph>madden me so?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"It is not I, Garnet. No mere words that I could speak could disturb your bosom's peace. It is the awful CONSCIENCE there that refuses to be silent," said Hugh, solemnly.</p>
               <p>She paused before him, trembling all over; clenching her chest with her spread hands, as though to clutch the passion there; her eyes burning in their intense lurid fire, in fearful contrast with the ghastly paleness of her brow and cheeks, and gasped between her white lips,</p>
               <p>"You are an incendiary; sent here to convulse my soul with war, until Reason herself is hurled from her throne! Man! Man! You know what civil war in a nation is. <emph>Do</emph> you know—<emph>can</emph> you guess what the internal conflict of a divided <emph>soul</emph> is? No, you do not. <emph>Your</emph> well balanced mind, like a well governed state, is always quiet. <emph>But mine?</emph> Oh, you have raised an insurrection in <emph>my</emph> soul that can never, never be suppressed! Oh, man! man! it is a grievous wrong that you have done me. I was so highly happy in my glorious hopes and prospects, until you came. You have killed all my joy. But do not think," she exclaimed, with another violent outburst of passion, "do not think that you have succeeded. <emph>Do not!</emph> Never suppose that to please your fanaticism, I will give up my estate; never! never! never!"</p>
               <p>"No, Garnet. Not to please my fanaticism, as you call it, will you do so, but in obedience to your awakened and aroused conscience, will you do so."</p>
               <p>"<emph>What!</emph> Never! What! resign all my great plans of usefulness, of benevolence, of wide philanthropy? Renounce all my glorious prospects of worldly honour—perhaps renown? Man! do you <emph>know</emph> what you ask of me? They are worth my soul's price. Give up my fortune! Do you know its amount? Why, my income is almost a queen's revenue. Do you <emph>know,</emph> as I do, with what power it clothes me?"</p>
               <p>"I know the vast amount and great power of your wealth, Garnet. And I know the great good that you, with your wonderful beauty, talent, and enterprise, could do with it; the great distinction you could gain by it. I know your pride, your ambition, your burning aspiration after worldly glory, and I feel the stupendous force of the temptation that is upon you."</p>
               <p>"I tell you, my power, my plans and prospects, are worth almost my soul's price!" she exclaimed, vehemently.</p>
               <p>"'Almost,' not quite. There is a surplus value and weight about the soul that will weigh down the scale, and toss the fortune up."</p>
               <p>"NEVER, I tell you. Never!" she repeated passionately.</p>
               <p>Doctor Hutton regarded her fixedly for some moments, then he asked, coldly,</p>
               <p>"And this, then, is your final decision, Miss Seabright?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; please Heaven it is."</p>
               <p>"But it will <emph>not</emph> please Heaven, Miss Seabright. I only waited for your decision. I have it, and I shall leave here to-morrow. Had your conclusion been otherwise—but no more of that. And now," said he, sternly, "<emph>listen to me!</emph> You will go forth into the world. Your wondrous beauty, genius, and your riches, will draw around you the mighty in intellect, wealth, and position. Yet, queen of that court as you will be, you will take no joy on your throne; you will know you have usurped the seat of another. Your graces of mind and of person will be the theme of every tongue, yet you will know that they clothe a soul spotted with dishonesty. Your extensive philanthropy will be the admiration of sages and statesmen, yet their praises will <emph>reproach</emph> you with the thought that your munificence is at the expense of another. Your benevolence will be the sustaining hope and comfort of all the poor and wretched around you, yet their very blessings will <emph>curse</emph> you with the thought that you have relieved them with means falsely taken and falsely kept from a widow. You will dwell in lordly mansions, yet their magnificence will oppress you with the consciousness that they belong in justice<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7856-00000080"/> to another. You will be arrayed in costly garments, yet you will be scarcely able to bear the glare of their splendour, for you will know they cover a woman degraded from her pristine nobility by base ambition, and stained with foul injustice. You will be adorned with priceless gems, yet the diamond tiara on your brow will burn and sear your brain like a diadem of flame; the diamond necklace on your bosom will scorch and eat into your heart like a circlet of fire."</p>
               <p>"Hugh! Hugh! spare me! I tell you you will drive me mad!" she cried, clasping her temples.</p>
               <p>"At last you will cap the climax of your hopes by marrying some grand magnate of the land, yet you will bear within your bosom all the while, a false, a widowed, and a lonely heart, for you will know that your husband is not your true mate; for you will know—you <emph>do</emph> know, oh, Garnet!—you feel by all the instincts of your nature that it was to this—<emph>this</emph> bosom, that God wedded you from the first!" he said, dropping his voice to a gentle tone, and drawing her towards him.</p>
               <p>She dropped her face upon his shoulder, and wept and sobbed as if her heart would break. Such convulsions of sobs; such a deluge of tears. Gasping all the while—</p>
               <p>"<emph>Oh, I do!</emph> I know it, Hugh. Then <emph>why</emph> will you cast me from you because I happen to be burdened with a fortune? Is not that a strange new reason for leaving the girl that you love?"</p>
               <p>"Garnet! darling Nettie!" said Hugh, tenderly; "if you were suddenly bereft of your enchanting beauty, my love would be strong enough to bear the change; for the heart and soul that I loved most would live for me unaltered. But smirch not the fairness of your soul, Garnet, for I will not wed moral deformity."</p>
               <p>"This is weakness! This is miserable drivelling!" exclaimed Miss Seabright, starting from her resting-place upon his bosom, and dashing the tears from her flashing eyes. "I am no mendicant for your love, sir. No! nor will I purchase it at too high a price, either!" she added, bitterly, throwing off his deprecating hand, and hurrying from him into the house.</p>
               <p>Hugh looked after her in deep thought; then said to himself,</p>
               <p>"The flow and ebb of ocean's tide is nothing to the waving forth and back of her mind in its present phase. How strong—how terrible is the death-agony of her ambition! If the contest were simply between ambition and love, ambition would triumph in a high, proud nature like hers; but <emph>justice</emph> sides with love, and together they are invincible. I would the battle were over, though."</p>
               <p>He did not see her again during the day. She did not appear even at the supper-table.</p>
               <p>I have no time to tell you how Garnet Seabright spent that night, how the battle in her soul was fought and won. I have only time left for results.</p>
               <p>In the gray of the morning Hugh Hutton came down stairs, booted, great-coated, and laden with his saddle-bags, preparatory to mounting his horse, to set forth on his journey. He found Garnet Seabright in the great hall, apparently waiting for him. She stood at the foot of the stairs and leaned for support against the balustrades. She was looking very haggard as from loss of rest and anxiety; yes, through all the physical weariness, there radiated the light of a calm joy. He lifted his hat and bowed, intending to pass her, when she raised her hand, and by an adjuring gesture stayed him, murmuring very low:</p>
               <p>"Doctor Hutton, was it really your intention to leave me this morning?"</p>
               <p>"It was, Miss Seabright," he replied, in a deep constrained voice.</p>
               <p>"'It was,' and is it?" she added in a low tone, gently moving from her position.</p>
               <p>"<emph>It was, and is!</emph> Miss Seabright, unless you give me the only good reason for staying."</p>
               <p>She advanced towards him slowly, slowly, with averted face and deeply blushing cheek, laid both her hands in both of his, and murmured almost timidly,</p>
               <p>"Stay then, Doctor Hutton, I give up the estate."</p>
               <p>Hugh Hutton dropped his saddle-bags, drew her to his bosom and pressed her there, but spoke no word as yet.</p>
               <p>"Yes, take me, Doctor Hutton! I am not worth much, bereft of all my glory, shorn," she smiled faintly, "quite shorn of all my beams; but such as I am, you may have me, Doctor<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7856-00000081"/> Hutton," she murmured, dropping her head on his shoulder. Then as he strained her to his bosom, the passion-fraught heart of the man found expression for its fullness of emotion in one "great heart-word,"</p>
               <p>"<emph>My Wife!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes, your wife," she whispered very softly, hiding her glowing face on his bosom. "Your wife! no more nor less than simply that cheerful toiler by your side. I thought to have conferred wealth on <emph>you!</emph> It was a proud presuming thought—it is past now."</p>
               <p>"My wife! my wife! you have! you do—"ejaculated Hugh Hutton, with his full heart gushing in every tone, until it choked his utterance, and he stopped.</p>
               <p>Through all their painful struggle, he had not broken down until now—and now—but she was talking again, murmuring in her sweet deep tones again, and he bent to listen, to hear her whisper,</p>
               <p>"Oh Hugh! such a night as I have passed; such resistance of the demon, before he would flee from me. But the war is over now, <emph>quite</emph> over! The estate, the projects are all resigned, and not regretted—for oh! Hugh, where could I find such richness and fullness of life and joy as"—her low voice died away with her breath along his cheek and chestnut hair. But it was Garnet's nature or her present mood to pour forth the fullness of her heart in words. She spoke again: "Oh Hugh! I am so glad, so comforted and strengthened, so <emph>proud</emph> of you, that you did not yield one jot or title of the right, even for my love. Oh Hugh! Oh Hugh! my guide and guard! be always, good, and great, and strong; that I may have full life and joy in loving you. And when you have drawn your Nettie up to your own high moral level, <emph>so are you higher still,</emph> that, though rising herself, she may see you ever above her, and honour you as now! as now!"</p>
               <p>"Oh God, have I deserved this!" exclaimed Hugh Hutton, raising his eyes in grateful adoration an instant, and then bending them with unutterable love on Garnet, as he ejaculated in earnest, fervent, broken language, "Nettie! Nettie! not Heaven, not <emph>Heaven</emph> could give me a higher incentive to high resolve, than it has given me in your faith—in your faith!"</p>
               <p>He pressed his lips to hers, and from that first burning kiss, the tide of eloquence found way. He snatched her up in his arms, hurried into the parlour, set her in a chair, sank down by her side, and folding his arms adoringly around her form, poured forth, in words of fire, the long-pent great passion of his heart.</p>

               <p>IT was Saturday night, and Doctor Hardcastle had not yet returned home to supper. The family, except Elsie, had all retired to bed. Elsie had had a very fatiguing day, as most industrious housekeepers must have in bringing the week's work to a conclusion. Elsie's work, however, was not done yet, though the clock was on the stroke of nine, for having gotten through with all the heavy household labour, cleared up the supper-table, put the children to bed, and persuaded her mother to retire to rest, she set the coffee-pot and a covered plate and dish to keep hot for Magnus, replenished the fire, drew a little table up before it, and sat down with a large basket of stockings to darn—a couple of dozen of little hose and half a dozen pair of large ones—all to be looked over, and half to be mended. And Elsie, with her usually happy alchemy of turning everything into a subject of congratulation, said to herself that it was very fortunate she had so many stockings to darn, as it made the time pass so much quicker while waiting for Magnus. Yet, Elsie was very weary; very well prepared to appreciate the blessings of the Sabbath that makes cessation from work a positive duty. Yes, she was very weary, though the only signs of fatigue she showed were in the deeper flush of her cheek, the brighter light of her eyes, and the clammy moisture of her fair forehead that half uncurled the golden ringlets. The last little stocking was drawn upon her hand, and the bright needle swiftly gliding in and out among the meshes of the last rent, when the quick gallop of a horse into the yard, apprised her that her husband had come, and in an instant more the door was thrown open, and Doctor Hardcastle entered. Elsie was about to rise and receive him, when something strange and novel in his air and manner arrested her attention, as he said,</p>
               <p>"No, do not stir! Sit still, dear Elsie! I want to look at you just as you are a moment." He threw off his great coat, drew a chair to her side, seated himself by her, and gazed at her for the space of half a minute. Then he took her hand into his palm, pressed it, and opening his hand, watched the rosy tide ebb and flow through her still beautiful fingers. "Elsie," said he, "how long have we been married, dear wife?"</p>
               <p>"Eleven years and more," replied she, looking up, inquiringly.</p>
               <p>"Do you remember, dear, Judge Wylie's ball given in honour of your return from school? Do you remember that we had just heard of my changed prospects, and that we knew if we should marry we would have to go forth to a life of toil and self-denial—and do you remember that I took this hand into mine with fear and trembling for its destiny as it lay in my broad, brown palm, a tiny snow-white thing, sparkling with diamonds like icicles on snow, a fairy hand—an ideal hand?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I remember you talked a great deal of poetry about my hand, dear Magnus—and I remember that seeing you loved its beauty so much, I made a rash promise to keep it always beautiful for your sake. I could not do it, dear Magnus. It is not so fair and elegant now as it was then," said Elsie, smiling, and holding it up.</p>
               <p>"But, oh! how much dearer! how much more beloved! Then it was an ideal hand—now it is a human hand, a mother's hand," he said, taking it again and pressing it to his lips and bosom, and gazing fondly on her. Then, after a little, he spoke again, saying, "Elsie! dearest, there was <hi rend="i"/>an-<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7856-00000083"/>
                  <hi rend="i"/>other promise which you made, but in <emph>my name,</emph> and which I tacitly endorsed, yet have failed to perform."</p>
               <p>"Well, dear Magnus?"</p>
               <p>"Do you remember the dress you wore upon the memorable occasion of that ball? <emph>I</emph> do perfectly. I do not know the material of which it was made, but it floated around you as you moved—a soft and radiant mist. And when I spoke of it bemoaning the fate that would change it for a plain garb such as befitted a poor young doctor's wife—<emph>you</emph> smiled hopefully, and promised that in ten years, when I should have 'achieved greatness,' you would wear a much richer dress, which should still befit my station—and <emph>I</emph> endorsed the promise; yet ten years have passed, and I have failed to redeem it. My Elsie still wears coarse clothing, and works from morning till night."</p>
               <p>"Your Elsie is <emph>happy,</emph> dearest Magnus. And the Princess Charlotte herself, the idol lady of all England, could not say any more. Young people, especially where youth is brightened by such sanguine blood as mine, have too many extravagant hopes—make too many rash promises. I say again, your Elsie is happy, dear Magnus, and if she had the world she could not say more."</p>
               <p>He gazed on her in fond admiration for a little while, and then said,</p>
               <p>"Elsie, dearest, there is one thing at least in which we did not promise or expect too much—in which we have not failed to keep our promise—to love each other more and more every year we should live."</p>
               <p>She raised her eyes to his, and he read her answer in their loving glance.</p>
               <p>"Well, Elsie," he said, at last, "you are happy; yet it is not now the hope of better days to come, that makes you happy—for more than ten years have passed, and I have not laid by a thousand dollars. So you can scarcely expect now that I shall ever make a fortune by my profession."</p>
               <p>"Well, we make a comfortable living, and shall continue to do so; and as for our dear children, we must educate them to work, as we have done. Let me give you your supper now, Magnus."</p>
               <p>"No—not just yet," he said, smiling on her hand and pressing it.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, let go my hand a minute, till I finish darning little Ellie's stocking."</p>
               <p>"No! no more work to-night, Elsie," he said, firmly.</p>
               <p>"Oh! just let me finish this last stocking, it completes the whole job."</p>
               <p>"No! no more work to-night! No more work ever more for you. The long, long trial you have borne so patiently, so nobly, is over. Elsie! dearest Elsie! Fortune has come to us at last."</p>
               <p>Elsie stared at her husband with a look so blank, that you could not have told whether she had heard good or bad news—an instant, and then a sudden joy broke over her countenance, and she exclaimed, in a voice of wonder and gladness,</p>
               <p>"<emph>Fortune! You</emph> tell me so, Magnus, and it must be true."</p>
               <p>"Yes, fortune—yet it has come to us through such solemn, not to say tragic circumstances, that our prosperity must be received with a chastened spirit. Listen, dearest Elsie—this evening, as I returned home, I called at the post-office and found a letter from Reynolds, who used to do all my Uncle Hardcastle's law business. By his letter, I learned that about five weeks since, my unhappy cousin, Lionel, who had just returned from making the tour of Europe with his ward, was instantly killed on Hutton's Island, by the accidental discharge of a pistol. My uncle never recovered the shock of his death, and he sank gradually until about five days since, when he died—leaving me sole heir to all his property, and executor of his will."</p>
               <p>"Alas! Magnus, is it not a sad and grave thought, that no property which we do not make by our own toil, ever comes to us except through the death or the misfortunes of others! Alas! Magnus, our prosperity should indeed be received with a very chastened spirit."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sudden riches should be always received with fear and trembling; and when they come by sudden death—with awe!"</p>
               <p>Elsie looked down thoughtfully upon her clasped hands, and then after a little while inquired,</p>
               <p>"Well, Magnus! what will be your first movement under these new circumstances?"</p>
               <p>"I shall proceed at once to Hemlock Hollow to settle up affairs, and prepare the old hall for the reception of you and<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7856-00000084"/> the children. And by the time those arrangements are completed, the weather will be sufficiently settled to remove them. The only point of difficulty is in the temporary disposition of my professional business. I scarcely know what to do with my patients. I wish Hugh would return and take charge of the practice for a few weeks during my absence, or until the people could get another physician to settle among them."</p>
               <p>"It is quite time that we had heard from Hugh. But, dear Magnus, has this sudden news quite deprived you of your appetite?" said Elsie, rising and putting away her basket of work.</p>
               <p>"No—oh, no, dearest! Give me my supper."</p>
               <p>Elsie's nimble hands quickly laid the cloth, and spread the little supper. Magnus drew up his chair, and Elsie had just poured out his coffee, when the quick gallop of a horse up to the house, followed by a loud knocking at the door, arrested their attention. Magnus went to answer the summons, and in another instant Hugh Hutton entered. "Why, Hugh!" exclaimed Dr. Hardcastle and his wife in one breath.</p>
               <p>"Come in! Come in! We are so glad to see you! But where on earth did you come from? <emph>how</emph> did you come? You did not come by the stage this afternoon, for I was at the stage office myself when it came in," said Doctor Hardcastle.</p>
               <p>"No; I missed the coach at the last station, and had to hire a horse to bring me hither. But how do you all do?" said Hugh, shaking hands with both.</p>
               <p>"Well, very well! But you, Hugh, how is it with you?" asked Doctor Hardcastle, glancing at his black suit.</p>
               <p>"I may reply in your own words—'well, very well!' You got my letter?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, friends—it was a bitter blow to <emph>me</emph>—but I believe now, it was dealt in mercy to <emph>her.</emph> You have heard from Hemlock Hollow?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—but only this evening."</p>
               <p>"And what do you intend to do?"</p>
               <p>"To go on there immediately and prepare for the removal of my family as soon as the weather permits. But, come, Hugh—come, here is supper. See, Elsie has already set your plate and knife and fork, and poured out your coffee."</p>
               <p>"What! have you really not supped yet?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> have not! Draw up."</p>
               <p>The conversation at supper turned upon the affairs of Hemlock Hollow, Point Pleasant, Huttontown and its neighbourhood. Yet there was a studious avoidance of the subject of Mount Calm and Garnet Seabright, until the cloth was removed, and Doctor Hardcastle arose with the evident intention of showing his guest to his chamber.</p>
               <p>Then Hugh made a sign to his host to take his seat, and resumed his own, saying—"Well, my dear friends, you have inquired after everybody in our old neighbourhood except my fair young hostess, Miss Seabright, of Mount Calm; and yet one would think that she would interest you more than all."</p>
               <p>Hugh paused for a reply, and looked at them both. Elsie's brow crimsoned, and she turned away. Doctor Hardcastle looked very grave, and remained silent.</p>
               <p>"If you knew Miss Seabright personally, you would admire her very much. She is the most superbly beautiful woman I ever saw—of the brunette order, I mean," he added, bowing and smiling towards Mrs. Hardcastle, who averted her face with a heightened colour. "Yes, she is certainly the most splendidly beautiful brunette I ever saw—and with a soul, too, more beautiful than its shrine."</p>
               <p>Still Elsie averted her head, and Doctor Hardcastle continued gravely silent.</p>
               <p>"You do not answer me," said Hugh, perseveringly.</p>
               <p>"Hugh, my dear boy, Elsie and myself love and admire you sufficiently. Do not insist upon our loving and admiring your friend, Miss Seabright. Under all the circumstances it is too great a task for human nature."</p>
               <p>"Yet," said Hugh—and his voice faltered, and the tears swam in his eves—"yet last week I was the instrument in the hands of Providence in setting a far greater task than that to human nature, sir! And not to nature, well-disciplined human nature like yours, but to young, ardent, impetuous human nature—and I saw, through tears and groans, and writhings of the spirit, that task accomplished. What should you think of a young girl endowed with great wealth, peerless beauty, graces, and accomplishments—fitted in every way to adorn the highest circles of society—a girl, besides, of high self-appreciation—of great ambition—of adventurous enterprise—whose head and heart were busy with a hundred grand and glorious<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7856-00000085"/> plans of life—what, I ask you, should you think of such a girl, in such circumstances, giving up her wealth, her rank, her splendid plans and prospects, her soul's most cherished expectations and desires for the sake of simple, abstract justice?"</p>
               <p>"I should think that such a noble girl was worthy of a king's worship, or rather of a hero's love. But it is impossible! no girl would ever do this," said Doctor Hardcastle, turning and gazing at Hugh with wonder.</p>
               <p>"Will you please to look over these documents," said Hugh, drawing a packet of papers from his great-coat pocket, and laying them on the table.</p>
               <p>"The title deeds of Mount Calm, and legally conveyed to Alice Chester Garnet by Garnet Seabright!" exclaimed Doctor Hardcastle, examining them. Then he laid the documents down, squared himself round, placed his hands upon his knees, and staring full into the face of Hugh, said, "Hugh! What the d——, I never swore in my life! Don't make me begin now! But what the deuce <emph>does</emph> all this mean?"</p>
               <p>"You see what it means. Miss Seabright, having come of age, and feeling that she has no just right to the Mount Calm estate, conveys it to its rightful owner, Mrs. Garnet!"</p>
               <p>Elsie suddenly clasped her hands, and bent forward with flushed cheeks and open lips.</p>
               <p>Doctor Hardcastle continued his fixed, broad stare, until Hugh exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"God bless all our souls, Magnus Hardcastle, <emph>you</emph> are not the <emph>only</emph> noble specimen of God's workmanship on earth. There are <emph>others</emph> capable of magnanimity besides 'Magnus'—even the young girl, Garnet Seabright!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Garnet!</emph> she is a <emph>diamond</emph> of the first water. Is it possible that this should be so? I can scarcely credit the testimony of my eyes and ears! That Miss Seabright, as soon as she reached her majority, should have given up her estate. Oh! it must have been a mere impulse of youthful enthusiasm. She could not have known the value of money and property—and besides, you must have used great powers of persuasion with her."</p>
               <p>"No—you are wrong in every point. It was not enthusiasm—all her enthusiasm was enlisted on the other side, in favour of social distinction, for which she considered wealth indispensable. Nor was she ignorant of the value of money; no, enlightened by experiences in the extremes of—first, poverty, and afterwards, wealth—this girl of twenty-one had as accurate a knowledge of the value of money and property as any miser, beggar, or banker of forty-two. Nor was it without a struggle she resigned the estate. Most terrible indeed was the battle in her soul before Justice subdued Ambition. Nor was it through <emph>my</emph> persuasion that she made this glorious sacrifice to right. No—no mere words of mine could have subdued that towering pride—governed that aspiring ambition. No; I simply set the truth before her, and let it work its way. No; I set the truth before her, and then I might have gone to Patagonia or Bhering's Straits, and the result would have been the same. She would never have known an hour's peace until she had restored the property, at whatever sacrifice to her pride and ambition."</p>
               <p>Here Elsie broke forth, exclaiming,</p>
               <p>"Oh! what a noble girl! Oh! I love and admire her so much. I do think if I were in mother's place now, I should be Quixotic enough to convey the whole estate back again to her. At least, I know I would make her take back half of it. My heart burns towards that noble girl, and I feel half ashamed that we should benefit by her magnanimity. I feel as if by her giving and our receiving so much, that she is more noble than we are."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! she is indeed a noble, a wonderful girl," exclaimed Doctor Hardcastle.</p>
               <p>"And this noble, this wonderful girl," said Hugh, with his cheeks and eyes kindling with pride and joy—"this glorious girl is going to be my wife! Congratulate me, dear friends!" he suddenly exclaimed, impulsively thrusting out a hand to each.</p>
               <p>"Going to be your wife? I am so glad," exclaimed Elsie, pressing his left hand.</p>
               <p>"Going to be your wife? Why then, dear Hugh, this great sacrifice is fully as much <emph>yours</emph> as <emph>hers</emph>—since what was hers would have been yours," said Doctor Hardcastle, shaking his right hand.</p>
               <p>"Never mind that; only wish me joy!"</p>
               <p>"We do! we do! with all our hearts," said Elsie, clasping<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7856-00000086"/> ing his hand again. "But when are you going to be married, Hugh?"</p>
               <p>"Next Thursday four weeks. Having deprived Nettie of all her wealth, I must take her as soon as possible under my legal protection, unsettled as I am, and trust God with the result. Yes, next Thursday four weeks; that will give you time to prepare to come to Mount Calm, which, having been just handsomely fitted up for the reception of Miss Seabright, on her return from Europe, is in a proper condition to receive your family. Miss Seabright will remain at Mount Calm until our marriage, which will take place there. We wish you to arrive at or before our wedding day, that when we leave the mansion house, we may leave you in possession."</p>
               <p>"Hugh, we are not, of course, authorized to promise anything in the name of Mrs. Garnet, who is at this moment ignorant of Miss Seabright's magnanimity; but—I would she were here to answer for herself."</p>
               <p>Here the clock struck twelve, and Doctor Hardcastle, lighting another candle, said,</p>
               <p>"Friends, it is Sunday morning. Let us waive the discussion of worldly matters for to-day. Hugh, you know your chamber. Good-night!"</p>

               <p>IN the mean time, Miss Seabright was preparing to resign her state. Few can estimate the terrible trial it was to this just, but ambitious girl, to abdicate her elevated, social position, and step down upon the common level, to labour with the common herd. You have already seen how, in the fearful struggle which had ensued—in that dread bosom-tempest—all the latent selfishness which marred that noble nature, was thrown up and exposed upon the crests of the tossing waves of passion. But if, in this soul-storm, her hidden evil was cast up to view, it was also cast <emph>off.</emph> And then when the waves of her heart subsided, and the clouds on her brain dispersed, and the sun of right shone out clear and bright, illuminating her soul, and revealing her to herself—<emph>then</emph> she saw that there was something in her own nature greater than all her adventitious surroundings. <emph>Now</emph> she would not have said to Hugh what she had said before, "I am not much, shorn of my beams." No, indeed, there was consolidating in her heart, a noble, steadfast self-appreciation, that would no more falsify itself by factitious humility, than degrade itself by unjust action. And having once made the sacrifice, and<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7856-00000087"/> turned her back upon the splendours of her past fortune, there was no regret, no looking back, like Lot's wife; her face was set to her forward path—her strong, impetuous soul already rushing on to realize her future of loving and hopeful toil with Hugh for her companion and guide. With Hugh! How, at the recurring of his very name, the tide of emotion, like the rushing of a mighty river, would roll over her, overwhelming and confusing her soul with a sort of lost, delirious joy! Within this month of sacrifice, how much stronger and more concentrated had become her love for Hugh! And if the Judge of all hearts had demanded a reason for the mighty love that was in her, she would have been constrained to answer, "It is his moral integrity that has mastered my heart. It is his moral integrity that would not waver, for love or for ambition—those two mightiest passions of the human soul. I loved him before—I loved him well enough to have given him myself and all my wealth, but when I found in him a moral rectitude that would not bend for love of me, or hope of grandeur, I was drawn up to adore him. Yes, that is why I would rather follow him barefoot over all the earth, if necessary, and serve him as the Indian woman serves her lord, than be myself the object of worship to all the world."</p>
               <p>Yes, there was a man to love through life and unto death; there was a man to repose upon in all weakness, to confide in in all emergencies; whom the combined power of love and ambition, beauty, wealth, and the usages of society that would have justified him, could never move from his uprightness. There was a pillar of strength to cling to in a storm. It was with as much highborn pride and joy as love, that Garnet thought of her betrothed.</p>
               <p>The month and her preparations drew near their close. She was daily expecting to hear of the arrival of the family of Doctor Hardcastle at Hemlock Hollow. Doctor Hutton, who had not yet returned, was to come with them. She was looking for them by every stage, and hourly she added some new attraction to the preparations she was making to receive them. The ancients were accustomed to adorn a sacrifice before offering it up, and the same instinct impelled Miss Seabright daily to walk through her halls and chambers, designing, with her artistic taste, new improvements and embellishments for the palace home she was about to resign.</p>
               <p>The wedding-day arrived. It was a bright and beautiful day in May. Upon the evening previous, Doctor Hardcastle, with his family, had arrived at Hemlock Hollow. Therefore, there had been no time or opportunity for a meeting between them and Miss Seabright, previous to the marriage-day. Doctor Hutton was a guest at the Hollow, and a note from him to Miss Seabright, informed her that they would all be at Mount Calm at an early hour of the morning. Owing to the rather recent deaths in the family, and the peculiarity of the circumstances, it had been arranged that the marriage ceremony should be performed quietly at eight o'clock in the morning, in the saloon of Mount Calm, in the presence of few witnesses, and that immediately after the ceremony and breakfast, the young couple should depart to seek their Western home, leaving Mrs. Garnet in possession of the mansion house and the estate. The only guests invited were the Hardcastles, with Mrs. Garnet, Judge Wylie and Miss Wylie, and their old friend, the Reverend Mr. Wilson, with his wife and young sister. The marriage ceremony was to be performed after the Episcopal ritual, by the recently installed pastor of the New Church.</p>
               <p>At seven o'clock in the morning, therefore, the few privileged friends—with the exception of the Hardcastles, who had not yet arrived—were assembled in the saloon of Mount Calm, awaiting the entree of the bridal party.</p>
               <p>At last, the carriage containing the family from Hemlock Hollow drove up, and paused before the main entrance of the mansion, and Doctor Hardcastle alighted, followed by Doctor Hutton, who then handed out Mrs. Garnet and Mrs. Hardcastle. They passed up the marble stairs and into the hall, where they paused until Mrs. Garnet had sent up a servant to the bride, to request the favour of being received by her before she should come down into the saloon, and obtained and answer that Miss Seabright would be pleased to see Mrs. Garnet and Mrs. Hardcastle in her own apartment.</p>
               <p>The servant who brought back this message bowed and offered to show the ladies up. Mrs. Garnet and her daughter followed him up the broad stair-case into the upper hall, and through a door into an elegant front dressing-room, which Alice recognised with a smile as having been her own bed chamber.</p>
               <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7856-00000088"/>
               <p>The room, when they entered, was vacant of other occupants, but they had scarcely seated themselves at the front windows when the opposite folding doors opened, and Miss Seabright appeared before them.</p>
               <p>A novice, when she is about to renounce for ever the pomps and vanities of the world, and take the black veil of the nun, arrays herself for the last time in costly apparel. So, Miss Seabright, when about to resign for ever all pretensions to spendour, arrayed her glorious form with almost regal magnificence. Her bridal costume was a rich Mechlin lace over white and silver brocaded satin, and festooned with boquets of pearls and diamonds, a fine and ample lace veil confined above her lurid ringlets by a wreath of the same priceless gems.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Garnet raised her eyes to look upon the bride. She had never seen Miss Seabright before, and now at the first sight of her magnificently beautiful form and face, Alice started violently; all the blood suddenly left her cheeks for an instant, and then rushed back again, crimsoning her face to the very edges of her hair. So startling, so strong, so <emph>painful</emph> was the resemblance of Miss Seabright to the late General Garnet. Yes, there was the same majesty and sweetness of mien, the same regal turn of head and neck, the same fiery, dark hair, the same smouldering and flashing eyes, the same beautiful lips, the same bewildering smile. The only difference was, that in place of the latent diabolism under General Garnet's countenance, all Heaven shone from Miss Seabright's. Alice felt that she looked upon her late husband's face, only with its beauty idealized, elevated, made divine. The vague, half-formed suspicions concerning the paternity of Garnet Seabright, that had occasionally floated through her mind, now became painfully confirmed. As she gazed, chills and heats alternately shook her frame, and then a strong, yearning compassion mingled with the high admiration she had hitherto felt for the noble-souled girl, and she said to herself, "I wonder if she knows it?"—then looking at her more attentively, she exclaimed inwardly, "No! no! she does not know or suspect it. My soul upon it, she does not know or suspect it! No! there is a high self-appreciation, a grandeur in her mien and air, a majesty seated on that pure and lofty brow, unconscious of shame; unconscious of the very possibility of shame. God shield her from the knowledge! for oh! as I look upon her noble presence now, I feel too surely that the knowledge of her shame would kill her with a stroke swift, sharp, and sure. God shield her from the knowledge! It were sacrilege to discrown that imperial brow of its diadem of unsullied honour, and brand it with shame instead. God shield the innocent from the knowledge of guilt which is infamy! God shield her! Oh, I can now forgive my dead husband for having cheated me out of this beautiful daughter; when I think he had the grace to keep her innocent of the knowledge of her parentage and his guilt. Yet how he must have loved her! Oh! doubtless, many times when his brow was overcast with gloom and sullenness, it was with the thought of this child. He never confided his sins or his troubles to me. Would he had! I could have been as much of a friend as a wife to him. Would he had had faith enough in me, when the poor little one was orphaned, to have laid her on my bosom instead of exiling her to that bleak isle! I would have brought her up as my own. Did he dream that I would have been otherwise than good to a little child? But he would not trust me. He could tyrannize over me in a thousand useless ways, yet never could venture to bring the motherless child to my arms. No, he could never tell me until that night, when drunken both with brandy and bad passions—he taunted me with the fact."</p>
               <p>All these thoughts of Garnet's parentage passed with the rapidity of lightning through the mind of Mrs. Garnet, while Miss Seabright, with outstretched hands and radiant countenance, was advancing towards her.</p>
               <p>"No, she must never know it; that pure, bright brow, must never be smirched and darkened by the burning, blackening smite of shame! Yet shall she be another daughter to me," concluded Alice, as she arose to meet the bride. As Miss Seabright, being the taller of the two, bent to welcome Mrs. Garnet, Alice threw one arm caressingly over her shoulder, and saying,</p>
               <p>"<emph>We</emph> must not meet as strangers, my love," kissed her cheek.</p>
               <p>Miss Seabright looked down, with proud gravity, upon the gentle lady, for an instant, and then said,</p>
               <p>"I have great pleasure in welcoming you back to your native halls, Mrs. Garnet. Long may you live in the enjoyment of them!"</p>
               <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7856-00000089"/>
               <p>"The enjoyment of which I owe to you, noble girl."</p>
               <p>"Nay, madam; <emph>the long deprivation of which</emph> you owed to me, unfortunately. The repossession of which now you owe to nobody—nothing. It is simple justice."</p>
               <p>"But it is <emph>not</emph> justice, thou noble girl, that thou, who wast brought up in affluence—"</p>
               <p>"Nay, madam—I have known <emph>penury, too!</emph>" interrupted Miss Seabright, with a sort of proud humility, if the phrase be admissible.</p>
               <p>Without noticing the interruption, Mrs. Garnet resumed—</p>
               <p>"It is <emph>not</emph> justice, that one educated in luxury, and in the prospect of nearly boundless wealth, should be suddenly bereft of everything, and reduced to a position for which she is totally unfit,"</p>
               <p>"Oh, madam, pardon me. Had I not an example before me? Did not your own admirable daughter resign wealth and station, and go forth to a life of toil and privation, to preserve intact the integrity of her heart?" said Garnet Seabright, with gentle dignity, waving her hand towards Mrs. Hardcastle, who had withdrawn to a distant window during this colloquy.</p>
               <p>"Yes, to preserve the integrity of her heart, and the <emph>love</emph> of her heart—which latter gave her strength to do as she did. Yes, and that was scarcely a trial to Elsie, who possessed a cheerful, loving, and active temperament, and was, besides, without your aspiring ambition. No, Miss Seabright, <emph>nature,</emph> even more than education, has quite unfitted you for the life of active, household toil and privation, voluntarily assumed for long years by Mrs. Hardcastle. No, Miss Seabright; JUSTICE, as well as your own magnanimous conduct, have imposed <emph>this</emph> duty on me." Mrs. Garnet paused, and drawing from her pocket a roll of parchment, placed it in the hands of the bride.</p>
               <p>"What is this?" asked Miss Seabright.</p>
               <p>"It is a deed of conveyance of property to the amount of one-tenth the Mount Calm estate. Receive it, with my love, as a marriage portion."</p>
               <p>"I cannot, madam," said Miss Seabright, returning the deed.</p>
               <p>"Nay, take it! take it then as a mark of the high esteem—the honour I bear you!" persisted Mrs. Garnet, tendering the packet.</p>
               <p>"No, I cannot take it, madam."</p>
               <p>"Receive it then as your RIGHT, proud girl! Education and expectation have given you a RIGHT to this. Take it."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, believe me, I cannot, madam; though from my soul I thank you," said Miss Seabright, with emotion.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Garnet looked discouraged for an instant, and then, as her glance fell upon the bright and joyous form of Elsie, as she stood looking out from the front window upon the spring scene, her eyes lighted up, and she called to her,</p>
               <p>"Elsie, my love, come here. You have a gift of persuasion that I, with all my good will, never possessed."</p>
               <p>Elsie came smiling forward.</p>
               <p>"Miss Seabright, this is my daughter, Mrs. Hardcastle. (Ah, Heaven! if they knew they were sisters!)"</p>
               <p>As Miss Seabright bowed, Mrs. Hardcastle threw her arm around her neck, and kissed her heartily, exclaiming, simply,</p>
               <p>"Oh, I wished to meet you so much! I shall be so glad to know you well!"</p>
               <p>"I called you here, my love, to aid me in persuading Miss Seabright to suffer me to do her justice. You know—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know!" said Elsie, interposing her cheerful voice.</p>
               <p>I know all about it. See here, Miss Seabright! I never was crowned with magnanimity, sublimity, enthusiasm, or the rest of the Godlike virtues and frenzies! But I am gifted with some sound good sense, which is ever at the service of my friends, and I offer you a sample of it now. Magnanimity is Godlike, until it is distorted to fanaticism, when it is fool-like! It was magnanimous in you to give up the whole of this estate. It would be fanatical to refuse to take the tenth of it when it is offered to you."</p>
               <p>This aptness of this argument seemed to strike Miss Seabright, for smiling, she replied,</p>
               <p>"I refer you to Doctor Hutton. I underwent such a course of lessons from him upon the love of lucre, as opposed to the love of justice, that I shall not forget it soon. Ha! I am not sure that—should I go to the altar with a deed to the amount of half this estate in my pocket—he would not think I had backslidden in principles, and reject me even there!"</p>
               <p>Here, Miss Joe, who, unperceived, had entered the room and came up to them, interposed her voice, saying,</p>
               <p>"I wish he wouldn't—I just do! I shouldn't like to see<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7856-00000090"/> Hugh make such a fool of himself as that!" Then patting Miss Seabright affectionately upon the shoulder, she whispered, in a knowing, confidential tone, "You take it yourself, honey. Who has got a better right to some o' General Garnet's property than <emph>you?</emph> Sure, you're his own flesh and blood! and the image of him, too! You're his own flesh and blood, honey. I know all about it. It's all in the little yellow hair trunk among the letters. You take it, honey. <emph>You're his own flesh and blood!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Oh! Miss Joe, your rash words have destroyed—have blasted her!" exclaimed Alice, in a voice of agony, as the old lady, having fired this magazine, hurried out of the room quite heedless, because quite unsuspicious of the impending ruin.</p>
               <p>And ruined indeed looked Miss Seabright, with every vestige of colour blasted from her marble-like face. Still as a statue of despair, she stood with her dilated eyes immovably fixed upon the receding figure of the old woman, until it had disappeared from the room.</p>
               <p>Then, tossing back her bridal veil, and springing forward, she grasped the hand of Mrs. Garnet, and darting her wild gaze piercingly into the lady's gentle eyes, she asked, hurriedly—</p>
               <p>"Did I—did I hear aright? What did she say?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing; do not mind her, Miss Seabright," replied the lady, with a flushed brow.</p>
               <p>"<emph>What did she say?</emph>" repeated Garnet.</p>
               <p>"Nothing! Nothing worth telling, my dear."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I implore you, tell me what DID she say?"</p>
               <p>"My dearest girl! nothing that it is well you should hear."</p>
               <p>"Nay, then! I ADJURE you to tell me! By your soul's truth, I ADJURE you to tell me!" persisted the miserable girl.</p>
               <p>"She told you, dearest Garnet, that you were the daughter of my late husband; but—"</p>
               <p>"STAY! <emph>am I so?</emph>" interrupted Garnet, in a voice of indescribable anguish.</p>
               <p>"Yes—I believe so," replied Alice, gently.</p>
               <p>She dropped the hand she had grasped with such strength, and stood as if suddenly turned to stone, for an instant—and then springing forward with the wild energy of desperation, she exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"UNSAY those words! UNSAY THEM, or see me die before you!"</p>
               <p>Alice suddenly threw her arms around the form of the stricken girl, and catching her wild eyes, gazed into them deeply and tenderly as though she would have transfused all her own sweet love and resignation into that rampant soul, and said—</p>
               <p>"Dearest child! She told you only what <emph>we</emph> knew, and still loved you. Dearest child! you are my husband's daughter, and Elsie's younger sister—and we love you."</p>
               <p>"The child of your husband and not <emph>your</emph> child! The younger sister of your daughter, and <emph>you living!</emph>" exclaimed the wretched girl, sinking, withering, shrivelling as it were before the fell blast of this burning and consuming revelation. At last she groaned forth in tones of unutterable sorrow—"Oh! Oh! was it <emph>right,</emph> Heaven! was it <emph>well,</emph> Heaven! just as I had made a great sacrifice to duty, and achieved a great moral victory; was it <emph>well</emph> to strike me in my pride of place, and bring me down <emph>so low! so low!</emph>" Then with another spasmodic outbreak of energy, she exclaimed—"UNSAY those words! UNSAY THEM, or see me die before you! Take all I have—wealth, rank, prospects, hopes! all, all! but, for the love of God, UNSAY THOSE WORDS! Take all, all! but leave me my honourable name! Take all, all! but let me go an honoured, if an humble bride, to my husband's home! Oh, for the pity of God!"</p>
               <p>Again Mrs. Garnet threw her arms around the cowering form of the wretched girl, as though she would envelope, sustain, <emph>save</emph> her in this trying moment, by the might of love; and saying—</p>
               <p>"My dearest Garnet! my love! my love! you <emph>shall</emph> go an honourable and an honoured bride to your husband's home. One whom I will take to my bosom thus—is a worthy match for any man. You should have been my own daughter, Garnet, but that I was cheated out of you; but I claim you now. You are my husband's child, and the express image of his person; therefore you should have been my child; therefore I claim you now to be my child of right. I loved your father, Garnet! I love you! Believe me! Do not cover your<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7856-00000091"/> face, and turn it from me. Let me kiss you. Do not grieve so."</p>
               <p>"Grieve!" exclaimed the sinking girl, in a voice of anguish; "I do not grieve, lady! <emph>I die!</emph> Grieve! Oh! look you, madam! If I had suffered the loss of friends by death, or what is worse, by treachery; if I were miserably poor, ill, and abandoned; if I were dying of disease, want, and neglect; if I were misjudged, slandered, and persecuted; if I were unjustly charged, falsely imprisoned, and innocently doomed to death; if I were suffering ANY OTHER anguish of mind, or agony of body, <emph>then</emph> I might grieve—but now! now! that I know myself a living, breathing monument of guilt!" a terrible shudder shook her frame and arrested her speech—her form collapsed and sank more than before—and it was in a dying voice she resumed—"Now, that I know myself infected by worse than leprosy"—she paused and looked at herself from head to foot; she stretched forth her beautiful brown arm, frosted with pearls and diamonds, and surveyed it; she gathered up the lurid ringlets of her dark hair and gazed on them; then, dropping her arms wearily, she continued—"I was not so vain as grateful for my beauty. But now! oh, God! to think that every atom of flesh, and every drop of blood, and every nerve and vein to my heart's core is pervaded, permeated with sin and reproach! sin and reproach! Oh, God! oh, God! quickly take back the soul Thou didst send into this shape of sin!"</p>
               <p>Once more her form cowered, crushed beneath the over-whelming weight of ignominy. She tottered and must have fallen to the floor, but that Elsie sprang and aided her mother in supporting her to a sofa near.</p>
               <p>"I declare," exclaimed Elsie, in her positive manner, "there should have been no concealment, she should have grown up with the knowledge of her parentage!"</p>
               <p>"Oh-h-h! doubtless," murmured the nearly dying girl, "oh, doubtless they should have told me of my birth! And then my soul would have grown up familiarized with infamy, until it became as base as its proscribed dwelling-place!"</p>
               <p>"But," said Elsie, in her calm way, "is it possible you never suspected this? It is possible that, when you came home from school, with all your faculties alive and keen, you could have looked upon my father's portrait, and looked upon your own reflection in the glass, and not be struck by the resemblance, the <emph>identity</emph> of the two faces? Is it <emph>possible</emph> that you did not suspect this?"</p>
               <p>"Suspect this! suspect my birth! suspect my shame! Oh, woman, woman! you found me proud and joyous! how <emph>could</emph> I have suspected this? You found me <emph>living!</emph> how <emph>could</emph> I have suspected this and lived?" she exclaimed, in a voice of indescribable grief and reproach, and then her form subsided, as it were, prostrate among the cushions. And so it was throughout the scene; frequent convulsive outbreaks of anguish would be instantly followed by the prostration of all strength. And then she lay with her hands pressed upon her face a long time perfectly still, but for an occasional start and shudder. She lay there, with Elsie sitting by her side, until the clock struck eight—the marriage hour. Mrs. Garnet then approached, and kneeling by her, embraced and kissed her, saying,</p>
               <p>"My dear girl, my <emph>daughter,</emph> rouse yourself. The bitter trial of this needless revelation has shocked you nearly to death. But it will pass away, as all trials must, my love! Garnet, I too, have had trials in my time, heart-crushing disappointments and sorrows, from which I thought I never could recover. But I <emph>have</emph> recovered, you see. My sorrows are gone, long ago; gone down the stream of the past, and I have been happy for years. So it will be with you. We all think our first sorrow is going to kill us, but it does not. We live and recover. So you will find it. This sudden revelation has overwhelmed you, but you will get over it. We will make you forget it. You will be an honourable and honoured wife. You will be loved and happy. Come, rouse yourself! Your marriage hour has struck. Your husband waits you even now, come! Give me your hand! Arise!"</p>
               <p>"My marriage hour has struck! My husband waits me now! Oh, madam, do you then believe me base in <emph>soul</emph> as in birth?" exclaimed the miserable girl, with bitterness.</p>
               <p>"In the name of Heaven, what mean you?"</p>
               <p>"Do you think that <emph>I,</emph> stripped of all other possessions, will carry my dower of shame to my husband's home?"</p>
               <p>"In the name of mercy, what <emph>do</emph> you mean?" asked Alice, in alarm.</p>
               <p>"Oh, merely <emph>this,</emph> that this marriage <emph>must not</emph> and <emph>shall not</emph>
                  <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7856-00000092"/> proceed! Oh, no! Doctor Hutton must never blush for his wife's parentage!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Garnet glanced at Elsie in despair. Elsie here interposed her blooming face and hopeful voice, saying,</p>
               <p>"Miss Seabright, as I told you before, I have no grand sentiments, but I have some good sense, and it seems to me, as it takes two to make an engagement, it takes two to break it, honestly; I think, as you have plighted your troth to Hugh Hutton, you might consult him before breaking faith with him, for such a cause, at the very last moment."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Consult him!</emph>" said the poor girl, as the blood crimsoned her ashen brow. "<emph>How can I consult him?</emph> And if I could, I know his self-immolating generosity. I know, besides, that he loves me so, he would hold me to my word; he loves me so, he would take the shame with me. Consult him! <emph>No, no!</emph> for many reasons. But <emph>without</emph> consulting him, I will break with him; since in breaking faith I shall wrong him less than in keeping it!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Miss Seabright, that is sophistry! And sophistry is ingenious, but it deceives no one. Duty is very simple, and it never can be mistaken. But I hear the bridegroom and his friends approaching the door. Come, rise! let me re-arrange your hair and wreath."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Garnet opened the door, and admitted Dr. Hardcastle and Hugh Hutton. Dr. Hardcastle went up to his wife, who drew him off to a distant window, while Hugh Hutton, seeing his bride reclining, pale and disordered, upon the sofa, hastened to her, stooped over, took her hand, and gazed anxiously upon her, inquiring,</p>
               <p>"My dearest Garnet, what is the matter? Are you ill again?"</p>
               <p>She turned her face, whitened and sharpened with anguish, upon him, gazed intently in his countenance, but said nothing for a full minute—then, as by a new and sudden impulse, she exclaimed</p>
               <p>"Hugh! I know my birth. <emph>Do you?</emph>"</p>
               <p>Doctor Hutton dropped her hand, frowned, and compressed his lips.</p>
               <p>Garnet's features convulsed with a spasm of anguish, and she covered her face with her hands.</p>
               <p>When Hugh Hutton saw that, he dropped upon his knee at her side, removed her hands, and kissed her pallid brow, saying,</p>
               <p>"I know that God created you a beautiful and high-souled woman. I know that by no act of your life have you ever marred His creation. I seek to know—" he broke forth with sudden energy—"I <emph>consent</emph> to know no more."</p>
               <p>"Hugh," she said, looking at him piteously, "an evil covered up, is not an evil cured. Hugh, this marriage must not go on."</p>
               <p>"Nettie, you are insane!"</p>
               <p>"No, never more soberly, sadly sane than now."</p>
               <p>"What! would you break your engagement to me?—and at the last moment?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; for a sufficient reason."</p>
               <p>"But I will not consent to it."</p>
               <p>"I do not ask your consent. I break it."</p>
               <p>"Nettie!"</p>
               <p>"Hugh! stoop down here!—nearer—there. <emph>Hugh!</emph>" she said, tenderly running her pale fingers through the dark waves of hair, each side his massive forehead, and holding his head between her hands as she gazed fondly in his face—"<emph>Hugh!</emph> I <emph>know</emph> you love me. I have never doubted it one single moment. And <emph>I do love you.</emph> So much—so much, Hugh, I love you so much, that to save my own immortal soul I would not marry you."</p>
               <p>"You dare not refuse me. I claim your plighted faith. I claim you for my wife," exclaimed Hugh Hutton, passionately.</p>
               <p>"To save you I dare refuse you. To save you I dare break my plighted faith, and take the sin upon my own soul. Hugh! <emph>dear</emph> Hugh! in one great contest I yielded to you, because high principle was on your side. But this is a different matter, I am as inexorable as Death."</p>
               <p>"Nettie! Nettie! I am strong; but your loss would paralyze me. But oh! it cannot be. I will never, never leave you nor forsake you. <emph>If</emph> I do, may God abandon my own soul!"</p>
               <p>Her features were convulsed again, and for a moment she concealed them with her hands; then laying her hands tenderly upon the head of her kneeling companion, and looking with immortal love upon his troubled face, she said,</p>
               <p>"It does not matter much for <emph>me,</emph> for I think that death is<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7856-00000093"/> upon me—but for you, Hugh—oh, it is hard, it is hard for you. It is hard for you, so good and true, so noble as you are, to be so grievously wronged by disappointment. Oh! it shakes one's faith in goodness, in Heaven. But I love you so—I love you so that I will pray God, living or dying, I will pray God to give you another love, another wife, who shall be worthy of you."</p>
               <p>"By Heaven! I will have no other wife but you. And you will I have!" exclaimed Hugh Hutton, forgetting the presence of others, and speaking so loud as to startle Mrs. Garnet, who came forward and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, Hugh! my dear friend, is not this a trouble? What shall we do to persuade her?"</p>
               <p>"Dear friend, leave me alone with her for a little while. God has deputed to me some power over His self-willed child—this noble but stubborn girl. Leave me with her."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Garnet turned to go, but was met near the door by Miss Joe, who bustled in, and nudging the lady's elbow, whispered to her, saying,</p>
               <p>"I say! ain't it time for them all to walk down? The parson—Parson Sinclair—has been come for half-an-hour, and the company down stairs is getting out o' patience. Besides, if the ceremony don't make haste and get performed, the breakfast will get spoiled—the coffee will boil all its strength away, and the batter for the rice waffles will rise so much it will turn sour. What are they all waiting for?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing. And I do not know that there will be any marriage," replied Mrs. Garnet, sternly and bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Hugh, what is the matter?" exclaimed Miss Joe, looking around in surprise. Then perceiving the recumbent form of Miss Seabright, with Doctor Hutton still kneeling by her, she inquired, "Dear me! What ails Garnet?"</p>
               <p>"You have ruined her peace for ever," indignantly exclaimed Mrs. Garnet, unable to forbear reproaches. "You have <emph>killed</emph> her with your uncalled for revelations."</p>
               <p>"ME! ruined what? killed which?" exclaimed the innocent old lady, in perplexity.</p>
               <p>"Garnet Seabright. I say you have killed her."</p>
               <p>"Killed her! why I hain't even tetched her. I hain't done a thing to her, I hain't harmed a hair of her head. I hain't been a-nigh her. She was well enough when I come through here with the napkins."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Words</emph> kill! You told her the secret of her birth. You told her she was General Garnet's child, and the shock and the shame have overwhelmed, have killed her."</p>
               <p>The old lady listened with her eyes starting out of her head, and her mouth wide open with unmeasured astonishment, and then exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"ME! Me tell her she was General Garnet's child! Why, I didn't do no such a thing! Who says I did?"</p>
               <p>"I! I heard you with my own ears."</p>
               <p>"Why, you didn't hear any such a thing! High! how could I tell such a lie as that, when it wa'n't the truth?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Garnet, in her turn, stared with such unbounded astonishment and incredulity, that the old lady took high offence, and exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Well! upon my word! Next time it lightens, I shouldn't wonder if you accused me of setting the clouds afire. Come! if you don't b'lieve me, there's the young gal herself. Go ask her now. She ain't dying neither, no more 'an I am. She looks gashly as a corpse, to be sure, but Lord! I've seen her look <emph>that</emph> way afore, when she'd get into her tantrums long o' her guardian or Hugh. Come! I'll go;" and the old lady waddled precipitately across the room to the sofa, exclaiming, wrathfully, "Miss Seabright! Garnet Seabright, I say! Now did ever I tell you sich a falsity as that you were General Garnet's child?"</p>
               <p>Doctor Hutton started up from his kneeling posture, and stood staring at the excited old lady. Garnet sprang up from the cushions, and gazed at her face with all her soul in her eyes.</p>
               <p>"My goodness, child; don't stare at me so wild! You'll give me the fever 'n' ague. Answer my question."</p>
               <p>Here Doctor and Mrs. Hardcastle were attracted to the scene of action.</p>
               <p>"Can't you speak? Did ever I say you were General Garnet's child?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Did—you—not—say—so?</emph>" asked Miss Seabright, with life and death struggling in her bosom.</p>
               <p>"No! I did not say so. How could I tell such a lie, when it wasn't the truth?"</p>
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7856-00000094"/>
               <p>"<emph>And—he—was—not—my—father?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I wish people wouldn't be slandering of your poor, dear mother! poor, little, wild thing. She was distantly connected with myself."</p>
               <p>"But," said Elsie, interposing, "no one raised a doubt but yourself, Miss Joe, and we would like to hear you explain your words, that gave rise to all this trouble."</p>
               <p>"Words! what words?"</p>
               <p>"The words you whispered to Miss Seabright when you passed through the room, an hour ago."</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes. Why, I telled her she might's well have a share o' the property, seein' how she was General Garnet's granddaughter."</p>
               <p>"General Garnet's granddaughter," exclaimed every one.</p>
               <p>"Yes. Don't all talk to me at the same time, you 'fuse my head. I declare, if my heart ain't as big as a batch of light dough, and my head goes round like a coffee-mill!—that 'minds me of the breakfast—'deed it will get spoilt."</p>
               <p>"But you did not tell her that she was General Garnet's granddaughter. It was something else you told her," said Elsie.</p>
               <p>"I—don't 'fuse my mind. I don't 'member what the words were, but that's what the meaning was."</p>
               <p>"I remember what the words were exactly," said Elsie; "she said she was 'his own flesh and blood.'"</p>
               <p>"To be sure I did; that's just what I <emph>did</emph> say. It's all in the little yellow hair trunk—her mother's little yellow hair trunk. I never knowed anything about it until I come here to live, because I never had no chance to fool my time away ransacking of old papers afore. If you'll all stop talking to me, I'll tell you all about it, and you can read the rest. You see, General Garnet, when he was a boy about seventeen or eighteen years old, he falls in love long of a poor gal, and marries her secretly. In about a year arter this, the poor gal she died, leaving of a young infant son. Then General Garnet—he was <emph>Mr.</emph> Garnet then—he being a wild young man, and not wanting to be bothered with children, he puts this child out to nurse, and goes off and forgets all about it. But the boy, as he grew up, <emph>he</emph> knew, some how, who his father was, and sort o' always had a hankering arter finding him. Well, he didn't meet his father till he listed in the wars, when he was no more than fourteen years of age; and he served under him the whole length of the war; and though General Garnet—he was Captain Garnet then—being a handsome, dashing, gay young officer, would not acknowledge or even notice this son, yet the boy seemed to worship the very yeth his father walked on. He seemed to live for but one thing in the world—to love and serve his handsome but onnateral father. He watched over the safety of his life and his honour. Twice he saved his father's honour at the loss of his own reputation; and <emph>that</emph> was the reason why he never got to be anything better 'an a corporal, all the time he sarved in the war. I'll tell you all about it some time, or else you can read it all in the old letters in the little yellow hair trunk. Well, and at last he saved his father's life, at the expense of a dreadful wound, that, arter years of illness, caused his death. Well, this boy—though his father didn't set any store to him, and his comrades didn't vally him as they ought to 'a done—was thought a heap on by my wild little cousin. And so, when he come from the wars, wounded, and feeble, and broken-hearted, she stole away to him, and they were married. She said she could work for both, and she <emph>did</emph> work for both till he died. Well, arter the poor misfortunate young man was dead and gone, I suppose General Garnet's conscience, as had been stone dead long before, had a ressurrection, or else the ghost of his murdered conscience haunted him, for he paid a visit to the young widow, and found her grieving herself to death. Well, he made a whole parcel o' splendid promises as he never fulfilled. And when the poor young thing died, leaving her little darter in his care, he jest passed her over to me as a great favour, and that was the very last I ever saw or heard of him or his promises, till he quarrelled long o' his own darter, and then he comed over and 'dopted Nettie. You see, God never could prevail with him to do anything, but the devil could make him do as he pleased."</p>
               <p>"There, there, Miss Joe, that will do," interrupted Mrs. Garnet, to whom these severe reflections were deeply painful. "Never, Miss Joe, cast unnecessary reproach upon the memory of the dumb defenceless dead."</p>
               <p>"I won't. I am sure if the Lord pardons him, we can. I won't say any more. Only if you want to know all the particulars, you see, you can read the letters in the little yellow<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7856-00000095"/> hair trunk. And that's the end of the story; and now I know the coffee is spoilt."</p>
               <p>"Garnet, you <emph>have</emph> a right to blush for your parentage—but let it be a blush of enthusiasm, for never have I heard of two such disinterested souls," said Doctor Hardcastle, shaking her hand with cordial sympathy.</p>
               <p>Hugh Hutton said nothing as yet, but stood by her, pouring all his earnest loving soul through the gaze he fixed upon her face. And she—down her cheeks the tears had poured like rain. But now that copious and refreshing shower was over, and the sun of gladness shone out again. Garnet smiled brightly, while yet the tears sparkled like rain-drops on her ringlets. Mrs. Hardcastle, with her cheerful blooming expression, was standing behind her quietly re-arranging the disordered wreath and veil. Mrs. Garnet went to the door of the adjoining room, and beckoned the two young ladies who were to act as bridesmaids. Doctor Hardcastle opened the hall door and admitted the groomsmen, who entered and gave their arms to the young bridesmaids. Hugh Hutton took the hand of Garnet, and when she arose, Elsie arranged the folds of her robe, and whispered,</p>
               <p>"Never mind if you <emph>are</emph> very pale and agitated, dear; it is not so unbefitting a bride—besides, your veil is down, you know."</p>
               <p>The bridal party moved onward down stairs. As Doctor Hardcastle followed with his wife, he turned to her with an arch look, and whispered,</p>
               <p>"My dear Elsie, there is an old acquaintance of yours below stairs."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Many</emph> of them, I suspect."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but <emph>this</emph> one is an uninvited, unexpected, but most welcome guest."</p>
               <p>"Whom?"</p>
               <p>"The Honourable Ulysses Roebuck."</p>
               <p>"'The Honourable Ulysses Roebuck!' I remember 'Marse Useless,' as the negroes used to call him; but how on earth became <emph>he</emph> 'Honourable?'"</p>
               <p>Doctor Hardcastle shrugged his shoulders, elevated his eye brows with a queer smile, and answered,</p>
               <p>"I really suppose just as most of our Honourables become so. He failed at everything useful, went to a distant part of the state, took to politics, made stump-speeches 'full of sound and fury, signifying nothing,' and got himself sent to Congress. After an absence of ten years, he has just now revisited his native neighbourhood. He reached Point Pleasant by the early boat this morning, and finding that the family were all here, he followed them and is here also."</p>
               <p>"And his old lady-love, who jilted him to marry my father, and lost both, and who must be now near twenty-eight years of age, how <emph>did</emph> she receive him? I should like to have seen that meeting."</p>
               <p>"I saw it. When he first entered the saloon, he was caught in the arms of Judge Jacky, who ran to him and rapturously embraced him, overwhelming him with welcomes. Then, when released from the old gentleman's arms, he shook hands with all his friends and acquaintances, looking uneasily around the room all the while, as if in search of some one else. At last his flying glances alighted on the distant form of Ambrosia, standing near the fire-place. He made her a formal bow, which she acknowledged by a cold curtsy!"</p>
               <p>"After a lover's quarrel and a separation of ten years. That is a first-rate sign, Magnus; I should not wonder if he had cherished her image in his heart through all those years."</p>
               <p>"Well, they had not even spoken when <emph>I</emph> came away."</p>
               <p>"Better and better. I shall not be surprised if he propose for her before the day is over."</p>
               <p>They had now reached the saloon where the bridal party were already ranging themselves before the clergyman, who was no other than our oldest friend, the Reverend Milton Sinclair.</p>
               <p>"See!" whispered Doctor Hardcastle, pointing to where Miss Wylie sat gloomily at one end of the room, and Mr. Roebuck morosely at the other, "see! I do not believe they have spoken yet."</p>
               <p>"I believe they'll be married in a week!" laughed Elsie.</p>
               <p>But the clergyman had opened his book, the ceremony was was about to commence, and all became silent and profoundly attentive while it progressed. It was over, and friends crowded around to offer their congratulations to the newly married pair. In the crowd, Ulysses Roebuck, Mrs. Hardcastle, and Ambrosia Wylie got pressed together.</p>
               <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7856-00000096"/>
               <p>"I declare!" exclaimed Elsie, with her cheerful ringing tones, "if here are not two of my old, <emph>old</emph> playmates!" and seizing a hand of each, she shook them heartily, then joining those two hands in hers, she said, "Let me be the mediator. Be friends, as you long to be!" and slipped away, leaving them together.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Shall</emph> we be friends? Shall we be <emph>more</emph> to each other, Ambrosia?" said Ulysses, pressing her hand.</p>
               <p>"Yes! if you can forgive the infidelity caused by ambition, and expiated by whole years of suffering."</p>
               <p>"I have waited for you ten years, Ambrosia. I should think that an answer. Come! let's go to the bay window and talk over old times!"</p>
               <p>"Not now, the company are going in to breakfast," replied Ambrosia, taking his arm; and they followed in the wake of the foremost. Mrs. Garnet approached the clergyman, who still lingered as if lost in abstraction.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Sinclair," she said, "it gives me great happiness to see you back here and settled in our parish. I am much pleased, also, to welcome you to our house. The company have gone in to breakfast, will you come?" Mr. Sinclair bowed in grave silence, gave the lady his arm, and they followed the others.</p>
               <p>Breakfast was over. The travelling carriage of Mount Calm was packed and at the door to convey the newly married couple to the stage-office at Huttontown, whence they were to start for the West. The family party, consisting of Mrs. Garnet, Doctor and Mrs. Hardcastle, and the bride and groom, were grouped for a last leave-taking in the passage, when Miss Joe suddenly appeared among them, in her poke bonnet and brown shawl, with a band-box in one hand and a basket in the other, and followed by a negro man, bending under the weight of a great trunk. When the little party stared with surprise, she exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Well, now, you needn't look so queer all of you, 'cause I couldn't help of it! I've been a struggling, and a struggling with my feelings, and I couldn't help of it. I'm gwine long o' Hugh and Nettie. They're like my own children, 'cause I took care of them when they were little! And I'm gwine long o' them. Besides, long as they're poor, they'll want somebody to help them work. It ain't much I can do now, seeing I'm nigh on to seventy years old. But, leastways, I can mend their clothes, and darn the children's stockings, and mind the baby, and so on."</p>
               <p>There was no time for much argument now, but to all that Mrs. Garnet and the Hardcastles could say to prevail on her to remain at Mount Calm, the old lady turned a deaf ear. She was set to go with Hugh and Nettie, because they were like her own children, and because they were poor.</p>
               <p>"But they are <emph>not</emph> poor," said Mrs. Garnet; "and, oh! that reminds me, I have the deed of gift yet," continued the lady, producing the deed from her pocket, and placing it in the hands of Doctor Hutton.</p>
               <p>"What is <emph>this,</emph> madam?" he asked, examining the parchment.</p>
               <p>"It is merely a dower with your bride," said the lady.</p>
               <p>"It is a deed of conveyance, Hugh, investing me with properties to the amount of one-tenth the great Mount Calm estate. <emph>Can I take it?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No, dearest! no! you cannot!" replied Doctor Hutton, pressing her hand; then turning to the lady, she said, "Mrs. Garnet, we sincerely thank you. This generosity is so like yourself, that we are not surprised at it, while we must gratefully decline it."</p>
               <p>As no arguments could move Hugh Hutton from his resolution, the effort was at last abandoned.</p>
               <p>The carriage, into which Miss Joe was packed, drew up nearer to the door. Garnet embraced her friends successively. Hugh Hutton shook hands with them in turn, and handed his bride into the carriage. The steps were put up, the door closed, and the carriage rolled away.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Mrs. Garnet continued to reside at Mount Calm, happy in her vocation of "Lady Bountiful" to the neighbourhood—happy, that is to say, as long as the fine weather of spring, summer, and autumn, lasted, during which, in her missions of usefulness or benevolence, she could walk, ride, or drive through the most beautiful country in the world; but, when winter came, with its wind and rain, and hail and snow-storms, its impassable roads, and its long spells of tempestuous or intensely cold weather, and its longer reasons of enforced confinement<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7856-00000097"/> ment within-doors, the lonely lady of Mount Calm found the solitary grandeur of her mansion house dreary enough. The minister had been her coadjutor, and often her companion, in her labours of beneficence, during the preceding eight or ten months; and now, in the stormy winter weather, he was her willing representative and almoner among the sick, the poor, and the suffering. No fury of tempest overhead, or depth of snow, or quagmire under foot, could interrupt the weekly visits of the pastor to the lady. The solitary lady knew this; and so, even in the most frightful weather, during the darkest, dreariest, and loneliest seasons, there was one day in the week to which she could look forward with certainty of enjoyment, namely, to Wednesday; when, let the wind and the rain, the hail and the snow, do what it might to prevent him, the minister was sure to present himself at Mount Calm. Each Wednesday evening, it became more painful for these two old friends to part, and the parting was protracted to a later hour. One very stormy night in February, when he had lingered by her fireside later than ever before, and had at last arisen to take leave, he detained her hand in his a long time, in silence, and then faltered, "Alice, are we never to be more to each other than now?" The lady shook her head in mournful negation, and there was a "soul's tragedy" in the tone wherewith she answered, simply, "<emph>We are old, now.</emph>" The timid proposition was not renewed then; the shyness of age, worse than the shyness of youth, silenced the lips of the minister. The proposal probably never would have been renewed, but for the intervention of the cordial-hearted Elsie—that happy, healthful, sworn foe to all morbid scruples, and needless suffering. She had been made acquainted with her mother's early history, and for years past she had watched over the delicate lady with more care and tenderness than over either of her own robust and blooming babies. Now that she was divided from her, she felt increased solicitude for the welfare of the fragile, sensitive recluse. It was towards the spring that she was awakened to a knowledge of the attachment existing between the lady and the pastor; and, after taking observation for a few days, she one day said to her mother, "Mother, why don't you marry the minister?" "Dear Elsie, what could suggest such an absurd thing to your mind? What would the neighbours say? At our age, too?" "Dearest mother, they may wonder a little tle, but, upon the whole, they will be well pleased; besides, shall their wonder prevent you being comfortable? You need each other's society, you and the minister. You are both so lonely—you in your mansion, he in his lodgings—you need each other. Come, accept him, mother. Magnus and I will give you our blessing," laughed Elsie; and then, immediately regretting her involuntary levity, she said, seriously, "Dear mother, think of this. You have reached the summit-point of life; before you lies the descent into the vale of years; your old friend stands on the same ground, with the same road before him.—Give your hand to your dear old friend, and go ye down the vale together."</p>
               <p>Elsie was successful in her efforts. Before another winter the lady and the minister were married; and thenceforward the serene and beautiful life of the pair gave a poetic fitness to the name of their homestead, "Mount Calm."</p>
               <p>Doctor and Mrs. Hardcastle made Hemlock Hollow their place of permanent residence. They erected an elegant mansion, and improved and adorned the grounds with such artistic taste, that it was considered one of the most beautiful seats in old St. Mary's.</p>
               <p>The Honourable Ulysses and Mrs. Roebuck spent their summers at Point Pleasant, and their winters in the metropolis, until the Honourable Ulysses grew weary of political life, and careless of popularity, and lost his election; when they took up their permanent abode at the Point, with Judge Jacky Wylie.</p>
               <p>And the families of Hemlock Hollow, Mount Calm, and Point Pleasant, formed an intimate social circle, and kept up their agreeable relations after the St. Mary's fashion of family dinner-parties, social tea-drinkings, fish feasts upon the coast, fox-hunts among the gentlemen, neighbourhood dances, &amp;c.; while the gentle, but powerful influence emanating from Mount Calm spread the spirit of religion over all.</p>
               <p>Doctor and Mrs. Hutton eventually settled in a Southern State. Miss Joe Cotter remained with them to the end of her long life. Consistent in her economy to the very last, she devoted the remaining years of her life to "laying up treasures in Heaven." Doctor Hutton became one of the most celebrated physicians of the country, and amassed a large fortune. Mrs. Hutton became one of the brightest stars in the<pb n="204-205 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7856-00000098"/> great Southern constellation of beauty, genius, and fashion. Their home is a beautiful edifice on the banks of a Southern lake, within an easy distance of the city. For elegance, taste, and luxury, it is scarcely excelled by the far-famed palaces of the old world. From his present affluent ease, Doctor Hutton delights to look back upon his early struggles, and he repeats now, with more emphasis than before, that, "A young American should never permit himself to depend upon the accidents of fortune for success in life; for in our prosperous country, a man of good health and good habits need never fail to make an independence for himself and family, and to win the blessing of God."</p>

The best sketch is the story of 'Old Sugar,' which is illustrated by an exceedingly fine drawing by Darley. We feel, after inspecting the designs in this book, that we have heretofore underrated the comic powers of this admirable artist; there are evidences in some of these designs of a very high order of genius."—<title>N.

               <head type="sub">WITH A MEMOIR, AND A TRANSLATION OF HIS LATIN WRITINGS,</head>
               <head type="sub">BY BASIL MONTAGU, ESQ.</head>
               <p>In Three Volumes, Octavo.</p>
               <p>The American edition of the works of Lord Bacon, now offered to the public, is reprinted from the most approved English edition, that of Basil Montagu, Esq., which has recently issued from the celebrated press of Pickering, (the modern Aldus,) in seventeen octavo volumes. It contains the complete works of the illustrious philosopher, <emph>those in Latin being translated into English.</emph> In order to render the publication cheap, and therefore attainable by all our public and social libraries, as well as by those general readers who study economy, the seventeen octavo volumes have been comprised in three volumes, imperial octavo. Being printed from the most accurate as well as complete English edition, and carefully revised, the American edition will possess greater advantages for the critical scholar as well as the general reader.

               <p>"We may safely affirm, that, by giving the Inductive Philosophy to the world, Lord Bacon has proved one of its most signal benefactors, and has largely done his part towards promoting the final triumph of all truth, whether natural, or moral and intellectual, over all error; and towards bringing on that glorious crisis, destined, we doubt not, one day to arrive, when, according to the allegorical representation of that great poet, who was not only the Admirer of Bacon, but in some respects his kindred genius—TRUTH, though 'hewn like the mangled body of Osiris, into a thousand pieces, and scattered to the four winds, shall be gathered limb to limb, and moulded, with every joint and member, into an immortal feature of loveliness and perfection.'"</p>
               <p>"We are more gratified than we can find words to express, to find a publishing house in this country, putting forth a publication like the Complete Works of Lord Bacon, in a form at once compact, elegant and economical."—<bibl>Brother Jonathan.</bibl>

                  <p>Waverley, Guy Mannering, Antiquary, Rob Roy, Black Dwarf, Old Mortality, Heart of Mid-Lothian, Bride of Lammer-moor, Legend of Montrose, Ivanhoe, The Monastery, The Abbot, Kenilworth, The Pirate, Fortunes of Nigel, Peveril of the Peak, Quentin Durward, St Ronan's Well, Redgauntlet, The Betrothed, The Talisman, Woodstock, The Highland Widow, Two Drovers, My Aunt Margaret's Mirror, Tapestried Chamber, The Land's Jock, Fair Maid of Perth. Anne of Gierstein, Count Robert of Paris, Castle Dangerous, The Surgeon's Daughter.</p>
                  <p>The object of the publishers in thus reducing the price of the Waverley Novels, is to endeavor to give them a greatly extended circulation, and they have, therefore, put them at a price which brings them within the reach of every family in the country. There is <emph>now</emph> no fireside that need be without a set of the most charming works of fiction ever issued from the press: for there is no one that can't afford two dollars and a half—TWO DOLLARS AND A HALF for twenty-five of Sir Walter Scott's Novels! ten cents, for a complete Novel!! ten cents for "Ivanhoe," which was originally published at a guinea and a half!!! It seems impossible, and yet it is true. In no other way can the same amount of amusement and instruction be obtained for ten times the money, for the Waverley Novels alone form a Library.</p>
                  <p>The publishers wish it to be distinctly understood, that, while the price is so greatly reduced the work is in no way abridged, but is CAREFULLY PRINTED FROM, AND CONTAINS EVERY WORD IN THE LAST EDINBURGH EDITION, in forty-eight volumes, which sells for seventy-two dollars.</p>
                  <p>Now is the time to buy! Such an opportunity may never again occur. Let every one then, who wants the <emph>Waverley Novels for two dollars and a half, now purchase,</emph> for if the publishers do not find the sale greatly increased, by the immense reduction in price, they will resume the old price of twenty-five cents for each Novel, which was considered wonderfully cheap.</p>

               <head>THE Prose writers of Germany.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY F. H. HEDGE.</head>
               <head type="sub">ILLUSTRATED WITH PORTRAITS.</head>
               <p>The work mentioned above comprises a list of the most eminent writers of Germany, together with copious extracts from their works, beginning with LUTHER and reaching up to the present time. For those who are interested in the literature of Germany, it presents a valuable aid in becoming more intimately acquainted with the German mind; and even to the curious it offers an excitement which will grow stronger in proportion as their taste is cultivated.</p>
               <p>In the present volume we find valuable extracts given from their prose writings. Although the writers follow in chronological order, and LUTHER stands at the head of his intellectual brethren, the longest space is allowed to those who claim our greatest attention; and GOETHE therefore occupies the most conspicuous position both in the specimens given and the selection of the pieces. GOETHE is a writer who requires most of all to be studied; while others, as SCHILLER, in his passionate mood and ideal longings, requires no silent and incessant reflection, because he works his effects immediately by rousing the depth of our nature. Next to GOETHE, SCHILLER appears in an article upon Naïve and Sentimental Poetry, a bold effort of him, the success of which is however yet very disputed, to classify every produce of Art according to the impressions made upon the reader, and to dispense with the various and cumber-some forms of the departments into which we have been accustomed hitherto to arrange all subjects bearing upon poetry. The department upon which SCHILLER enters here, belongs properly to the philosophy of Art; to the aesthetics, the investigation of the beautiful.</p>
               <p>Foremost stands LESSING, the first critic of his time. Next to him comes HERDER, a devout philosopher, and a clear-sighted intellect, with the eyes of a child; curious to penetrate the maze and noisy market of the world, the variegated life among the ancients and the moderns in search for that beautiful humanity which he had sketched in his own mind, and which he would fain proclaim the order of an otherwise mysterious providence. The two brothers SCHLEGEL—William, the noble interpreter and translator of Shakspeare, and Frederic, known best by his investigations of the language and wisdom of the Indians—follow him, and MOSES MENDELSSOHN, a Jewish philosopher, closes the series of these writers. The treatise of the latter on the Sublime and Naïve will be read with interest by everybody who has only an ordinary reading of ancient and modern poetry. Distinct from all the rest stand WIELAND and JEAN PAUL RICHTER, best known in this country by the appellation of JEAN PAUL.</p>

               <p>"THE book is a noble defence of Marie Antoinette against the many calumnies breathed against her. Moreover, as a picture of manners during the latter years of Louis XV., and the entire reign of his successor, it has no superior; it is at once more decent and more veracious than the 'Life of Dubarry,' and the thousand other garbled memoirs of that period. A large number of notes, explanatory and otherwise, accompany the volume, and add materially to its value. Mr. Hart has published the book in a style of great elegance, and illustrated it with portraits, on steel, of Marie Antoinette and Madame Elizabeth. It is a book that should find a place on every lady's centre-table."—<title>Neal's Gazette.</title>

               <p>"These elegant volumes are a reprint from the third London edition of this very delightful work.

               </p>
               <p>"There is not a page of the work which is not deeply or amusingly interesting. The position of the author at the court of Louis XVI. gave her extraordinary opportunities for looking behind the scenes for the causes of much that was entirely inexplicable to the public. Indeed, there can be no question of her knowledge, while of her truthfulness, as far as she goes, there is abundant evidence in the volumes themselves. We cannot believe Marie Antoinette to have been as immaculate as she is painted by Madame Campan. Young, giddy, inexperienced and wilful, she was cast headlong into the most profligate court of Christendom. Surrounded by pleasures and temptations, amid a set of beings to whom gallantry was so habitual that it ceased to be remarked—with an impotent husband, and with all around him corrupt, venal, and licentious, we cannot believe that all the scandalous stories respecting the queen were entirely without foundation, that she was <emph>always</emph> misconstrued and maligned."—<title>Boston Morning Post.</title>

Of what possible concern is it to any body, whether Mr. Thomas Babington Macaulay be, or be not, overrun with faults, since he is nothing more than one of the three-day immortals who contribute flashy and 'taking' articles to a Quarterly Review? What great work has he written? Such questions as these might be put by the same men who place the Spectator, Tattler and Rambler among the British classics, yet judge of the size of a contemporary's mind by that of his book, and who can hardly recognize amplitude of comprehension, unless it be spread over the six hundred pages of octavos and quartos.—</p>

                  <p>Such men would place Bancroft above Webster, and Sparks above Calhoun, Adams and Everett—deny a posterity for Bryant's Thanatopsis, and predict longevity to Pollok's Course of Time. It is singular that the sagacity which can detect thought only in a state of dilution, is not sadly graveled when it thinks of the sententious aphorisms which have survived whole libraries of folios, and the little songs which have outrun, in the race of fame, so many enormous epics.—While it can easily be demonstrated that Macaulay's writings contain a hundred-fold more matter and thought, than an equal number of volumes taken from what are called, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">par eminence,</foreign> the 'British Essayists,' it is not broaching any literary heresy to predict, that they will sail as far down the stream of time, as those eminent members of the illustrious family of British clastics."</p>

               <p>From a very able article in the North British Review we extract the following:</p>
               <p>"It is a book not to be read only—but studied—it is a vast repository; or rather a system or institute, embracing the whole circle of letters—if we except the exact sciences—and contains within itself, not in a desultory form, but in a well digested scheme, more original conceptions, bold and fearless speculation and just reasoning on all kinds and varieties of subjects than are to be found in any English writer with whom we are acquainted within the present or the last generation. His choice of words is unbounded and his felicity of expression, to the most impalpable shade of discrimination, almost miraculous. Playful, lively, and full of illustration, no subject is so dull or so dry that he cannot invest it with interest, and none so trifling that it cannot acquire dignity or elegance from his pencil. Independently however, of mere style, and apart from the great variety of subjects embraced by his pen, the distinguishing feature of his writings, and that in which he excels his cotemporary reviewers, is the deep vein of practical thought which runs throughout them all"</p>

               <head>THE POEMS OF FRANCES SARGENT OSGOOD.</head>
               <p>Illustrated by the best artists.</p>
               <p>In one volume octavo, uniform with Carey &amp; Hart's illustrated Bryant, Willis, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The following exquisitely finished line engravings are from original designs, by our most celebrated painters, and are executed in the highest style of art:—Portrait of the Authoress; Hope; A Child playing with a Watch; The Reaper; Ida; Old Friends; The Child's Portrait; Little Red Riding Hood; The Life Boat; Twilight Hours; The Arab and his Steed; Zuleika.</p>
               <p>"There is nothing mechanical about her; all is buoyant, overflowing, irrepressible vivacity, like the bubbling up of a natural fountain. In her almost childish playfulness, she reminds us of that exquisite creation of Fouque, Undine, who knew no law but that of her own waywardness. The great charm of her poetry is its unaffected simplicity. It is the transparent simplicity of truth, reflecting the feeling of the moment like a mirror."—<title>Rev. Dr. Davidson.</title>
               </p>
               <p>"In all the poems of Mrs. Osgood, we find occasion to admire the author as well as the works. Her spontaneous and instinctive effusions appear, in a higher degree than any others in our literature, to combine the rarest and highest capacities in art with the sincerest and deepest sentiments and the noblest aspirations. They would convince us, if the beauty of her life were otherwise unknown, that Mrs. Osgood is one of the loveliest characters in the histories of literature or society."—<title>Pennsylvania Inquirer and Courier.</title>
               </p>
               <p>"The position of Mrs. Osgood, as a graceful and womanly poetess, is fixed, and will be enduring. To taste of faultless delicacy, a remarkable command of poetical language, great variety of cadence, and a most musical versification, she has added recently the highest qualities of inspiration, imagination, and passion, in a degree rarely equalled in the productions of women. The reputation which Mrs. Osgood enjoys, as one of the most amiable, true-hearted, and brilliant ladies in American society, will add to the good fortune of a book, the intrinsic excellence and beauty of which will secure for it a place among the standard creations of female genius."—<title>Home Journal.</title>

                  <p>"Mr. Hedge has displayed great wisdom in the selection of the pieces to be translated; he has given the best specimens of the best authors, so far as was possible in his limited space.</p>
                  <p>"We venture to say that there cannot be crowded into the same compass a more faithful representation of the German mind, or a richer exhibition of the profound thought, subtle speculation, massive learning and genial temper, that characterize the most eminent literary men of that nation."—<title>Harbinger.</title>

                  <p>The biographies are twenty-seven in number—Napoleon and his twenty-six marshals, being all those created by him—and therefore these pages have a completeness about them which no other work of a similar design possesses.</p>
                  <p>The style is clear and comprehensive, and the book may be relied upon for historical accuracy, as the materials have been drawn from sources the most authentic. The Conversations of Napoleon, with Montholon, Gourgaud, Las Cases and Dr. O'Meara have all been consulted as the true basis upon which the lives of Napoleon and his commanders under him should be founded.</p>
                  <p>"The article on Napoleon, which occupies the greater part of the first volume, is written in a clear and forcible style and displays marked ability in the author. Particular attention has been paid to the early portion of Napoleon's life, which other writers have hurriedly dispatched as though they were impatient to arrive at the opening glories of his great career."—<title>N.

                  <p>"We have long been convinced that the character of Napoleon would never receive 'even handed justice' until some impartial and intelligent American should undertake the task of weighing his merits and demerits. In the present volume this has been done with great judgement.

                  </p>
                  <p>'The style of this work is worthy of commendation—plain, pleasing and narrative, the proper style of history and biography in which the reader does not seek fancy sketches, and dashing vivid pictures, but what the work professes to contain, biographies. We commend this as a valuable library book worthy of preservation as a work of reference, after having been read."—<title>Balt. American.</title>

                  <p>"The publishers have spared no pains or expense in its production, and the best talent in the country has been engaged on its various histories.

                  </p>
                  <p>"The result of these joint labors is a series of narratives, in which the events succeed each other so rapidly, and are of so marvelous a cast, as to require only the method in arrangement and the good taste in description which they have received from the hands of their authors. The inflated and the Ossianic have been happily avoided."—<title>Colonization Herald.</title>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Their historical accuracy is unimpeachable, and many of them (the biographies) are stamped with originality of thought and opinion. The engravings are numerous and very fine. The book is well printed on fine white paper, and substantially bound. It deserves a place in all family and school libraries."—<title>Bulletin.</title>
                  </p>

                  <p>"We receive, therefore, with real pleasure, this new publication, having assurance that great pains have been taken in the preparation of each individual biography, and especially in collating the various authorities upon the early history of the Emperor. There appears to be nowhere any attempt to blind the reader by dazzling epithets, and the accuracy of construction throughout is highly creditable to the editor."—<title>Commercial Advertiser N.

Who the author is we know not; but we do know that the book will meet with a rapid sale wherever an inkling of its character leaks out. For watering places, or anywhere, during the hot weather, it is worth its weight in—gold we almost said.

               <p>"A rare book. Who in the world wrote it? Here are nearly five hundred pages with gems on every one of them. The satire is equal to that of Don Quixote or Asmodeus. The hits at society in this country are admirable and well pointed. The humbugs of the day are skillfully shown up, and the morals of the book are unexceptionable. The author cannot long escape detection, in spite of his shadowy concealment, and if a new practitioner he will jump to the head of his profession at once."—<title>Godey's Lady's Book.</title>

               <head>WASHINGTON AND THE GENERALS OF THE REVOLUTION.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY VARIOUS EMINENT AUTHORS.</head>
               <p>Now ready, in 1 vol. post Svo., price $1 25, with Portraits,</p>
               <p>CONTAINING <hi rend="i"/>Biographical Sketches of all the Major and Brigadier Generals who acted under commissions from Congress during the Revolutionary War.</p>
               <p>WE hail these beautiful volumes with undisguised delight. They supply, in a dignified and comprehensive form, valuable information, which will be sought with avidity, not only by the American public, but by the world at large. The want of a work of <emph>positive authority</emph> on this subject has long been felt and deplored. The enterprise and good taste of Messrs. Carey and Hart have given us two handsome and reliable volumes, betraying industry and talent, and replete with facts of the deepest interest. There is no idle romancing—no school-boy attempts at rhetorical display; on the contrary, the work is written in a clear, unaffected, business-like, yet beautiful manner. The authors had the good sense to think that the stirring events of "the times that tried men's souls," needed no embellishment. It is a complete, impartial, and well written history of the American Revolution, and, at the same time, a faithful biography of the most distinguished actors in that great struggle, whose memories are enshrined in our hearts. The typographical execution of the work is excellent, and the sixteen portraits on steel are remarkably well done. The first volume is embellished with a life-like portrait of Washington mounted on his charger, from Sully's picture, "<hi rend="i"/>Quelling the Whisky Riots." This is, we believe, the first engraving taken from it. There are biographies of <hi rend="i"/>eighty-eight Generals, beginning with "the Father of his country," and closing with General Maxwell. To accomplish this task, we are assured that "the accessible published and unpublished memoirs, correspondence, and other materials relating to the period, have been carefully examined and faithfully reflected." We earnestly commend this work. It will be found an unerring record of the most interesting portion of our history.—<title>The City Item.</title>
               </p>
               <p>This work differs from Mr. Headley's, having nearly the same title, in many important particulars; and <hi rend="i"/>as an historical book is much superior.—N. Y. Com. Advertiser.</p>
               <p>Certainly the most comprehensive and individualized work that has ever been published on the subject—each member of the great <foreign xml:lang="LAT">dramatis personæ</foreign> of the Revolutionary tragedy, standing out in bold and "sculptured" relief, on his own glorious deeds.—<title>Saturday Courier.</title>
               </p>
               <p>This work is a very different affair from the flashy and superficial book of the Rev. J. T. Headley, entitled "Washington and the Generals." It appears without the name of any author, because it is the joint production of many of the most eminent writers in the country, resident in various states in the Union, and having, from the circumstance, access to original materials in private hands, and to public archives not accessible to any one individual without long journey and much consumption of time. The result, however, is a complete and authentic work, embracing biographical notices of every one of the Revolutionary Generals. The amount of fresh and original matter thus brought together in these moderate-sized volumes, is not less surprising than it is gratifying to the historical reader. This will become a standard book of reference, and will maintain its place in libraries long after the present generation shall have enjoyed the gratification of perusing its interesting pages, exhibiting in a lively style the personal adventures and private characters of the sturdy defenders of American Independence.—<title>Scott's Weekly Newspaper.</title>
               </p>
               <p>The author's name is not given, and from what we have read, we presume that various pens have been employed in these interesting biographies. This is no disadvantage, but, on the contrary, a decided benefit, for it insures greater accuracy than could be looked for in such a series of biographies written by one person in a few months. The volumes are published in a very handsome style. The first sixty pages are occupied with the biography of Washington, which is written with force and elegance, and illustrated by an original view of the character of that great man. The number of the biographies in these volumes is much greater than that of Mr. Headley's work. There are eighty-eight distinct subjects.—<title>N. Y. Mirror.</title>
               </p>
               <p>We have read a number of the articles, find them to be written with ability, and to possess a deep interest. The author has manifested excellent judgement in avoiding all ambitious attempts at what is styled <emph>fine writing;</emph> but gives a connected recital of the important events in the lives of his heroes. The work will be highly interesting and valuable to all readers—particularly so to youth, who are always attracted by biographies. If a father wishes to present to his sons noble instances of uncorrupted and incorruptible patriotism, let him place this work in their hands. It should have a place in every American library, and is among the most valuable books of the season.—<title>Baltimore American.</title>

               <p>"We have looked over the lives of some of the Queens, presented in Mr. A Hart's new volumes, with great interest. While none are devoid of some degree of attraction, the most of them have a charm about their person or character exceeding anything we find in the most popular romances. They are full of sentiment and romance, rendered all the more touching from the graceful drapery in which they are adorned, and by the truthfulness of which the reader is strongly impressed. It is of course doubly attractive, in reading the strongly marked characters of history, to feel a conviction of the truth with which even the wildest and most thrilling incidents are invested. The Lives of these fair ladies are full of instruction, a merit that more romance seldom possesses. The author, Mrs. Forbes Bush, commences with Queen Basine, in the reign of Childeric I., or about four hundred years after the commencement of the Christian era.

               </p>
               <p>"For this beautiful volume, the student and practitioner of Surgery will feel grateful to the ability and industry of Prof Pancoast. The drawing and execution of the plates are splendid examples of American art, and do credit to Messrs. Cichowski and Duval, while the description is no less creditable to the author. We have examined the book with care, and feel great pleasure in declaring that, in our opinion, it is a most valuable addition to the surgical literature of the United States. It was a happy idea to illustrate this department of surgery, as it renders perfectly clear what the very best verbal description often leaves obscure, and is, to some extent, a substitute for witnessing operations. To those practitioners especially, who are called upon occasionally, only, to perform operations, we are not acquainted with any volume better calculated for reference prior to using the knife. There are similar works published in Europe, but they are much more expensive, without being superior in point of usefulness to the very cheap volume before us.</p>
               <p>"All the modern operations for the cure of squinting, club-foot, and the replacing lost parts and repairing deformities from partial destruction of the nose, &amp;c., are very clearly explained and prettily illustrated. It is questionable whether anything on this subject can be better adapted to its purpose, than Pancoast's Operative Surgery."—<title>Saturday Courier.</title>

               <p>"We do not possess a modern work on Dental Surgery, written by a British Author, which equals that of Dr. Goddard. One reason for this may arise from the circumstance, that the learned author is a practical anatomist, whose knowledge is on a level with the modern discoveries, and who has himself authenticated the latest researches into the minute anatomy of the dental structure. It is quite apparent that such knowledge must prove of immense value in enabling any one to arrive at just conclusions relative to the diseases of the teeth; and it is chiefly to be attributed to the want of such knowledge that most writers on Dental Surgery have erred so much relative to the causes and nature of these diseases. The work may confidently be recommended, as containing the <hi rend="i"/>best and most approved methods of performing all the operations connected with Dental Surgery.</p>

The profession are largely indebted to Dr. Betton, the translator, and Dr. Goddard, who has prepared the work for the press, as also the enterprising publisher, who has brought out this magnificent book, in royal quarto, with its multiplied illustrations, in a style of excellence as respects typography, engraving, and colouring, which will do honour to American art.

               <p>"This is a practical age, and it demands practical books. Of this class is the manual before us, addressing itself to a rapidly growing interest among us, and one, upon the prosperity of which depends, in a great measure, the destiny of the South. We have too long committed the fatal error of allowing Northern manufactories to convert our staple into the fabries we require for use, losing by the process all the expenses of a double transportation, the profits of manufacturing, and sundry incidental costs of interest and exchange. With the increasing attention to manufactures in the South, arises the need of information upon all their appliances and workings, and much that is valuable of this nature is found in the book before us. Mr. Baird was an expert and successful cottonspinner. His experience and observations are here afforded to his fellow-operatives, combined with the modern improvements in mechanics and methods. No intelligent man at the present day builds without 'counting the cost,' or enters upon a field of labour without a comprehensive knowledge of its capabilities and requirements. To those proposing to erect small factories, or now conducting them, the treatise before us could not fail to be of service, if well studied, and to such we commend it."—<title>Southern Literary Gazette.</title>

Hart, and was compiled chiefly from the papers of the late Robert H. Baird, well known as an expert cotton-spinner. It is gratifying to see that so respectable a house as that of Mr. Hart has undertaken the publication of books of this kind, for we believe that our operatives should possess a theoretical as well as practical knowledge of their several trades. This work gives the dimensions and speed of machinery, draught and twist calculations, with notices of the most recent improvements.

               <p>"This is one of the most interesting and valuable of the many excellent little treatises on mechanical and manufacturing pursuits which have been published by Mr. Hart. The construction and working of a cotton-factory are thoroughly explained. Buildings, main gearing, water-wheels, picking and spreading machines, cards and carding, drawing-frames, speeders, throstles and mule spinning, are elaborately discussed, and to those engaged in the production of cotton goods, the volume must be exceedingly useful. To political economists and others, who feel an interest in the great progress of our country, the historical and statistical portions of the book will also be of value.</p>
               <p>"'In 1770, there were exported to Liverpool from New York three bags of cotton wool; from Virginia and Maryland, four bags; and from North Carolina, three barrels.

In 1790 the first cotton-mill was erected in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. In 1850 the number of spindles in operation was computed at 2,500,000.'
