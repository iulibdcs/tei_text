SMTH; "AND A FUNERAL DISCOURSE BY THE DEVOUT CHAPLAIN OF THE MACKEREL BRIGADE. WASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 4th, 1863. THE more I see of our Honest Abe, my boy,--the more closely I analyze the occasional acts by which he individualizes himself as a unit distinct from  the decimals of his cabinet, -the deeper grows my faith in his sterling wisdom. Standing a head and shoulders above the other men in power, he is the object at which the capricious lightnings of the storm first strike; and were he a man of: wax, instead of the grand old rock he is, there would be nothing left of him but a shapeless and in- ert mass of pliable material by this time. There are deep traces of the storm upon his countenance, my boy; but they are the sculpture of the-tempest -on a natural block  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7327-00000005"/> I. ^    8       ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. of granite, graduating the features of young simplicity into the sterner lineaments of the mature sublime, and shaping one of those strong and earnest faces which God sets, as indelible seals, upon the- ages marked for immor- tality. Abused and misrepresented by his political foes, alternately cajoled and- reproached by his other foes, - his political friends, - he still pursues the honest tenor of the obvious Right, and smiles at calumny. His good-nature, my boy, is a lamp that never goes out, but burns, with a - steady light, in the temples of his mortality through all the dark hours of his time: "As some tall cliff that rears its awful form, Swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm; Though round its base the rolling clouds are spread, Eternal sunshine settles on its head." They tell a story about the Honest Abe which this good pen of mine cannot refrain from writing. A high moral, political chap from the Sixth Ward, having learned that there was a pleasing clerical vacancy in the Treas- ury Department, sought a hasty interview with the Hon- est Abe, and says he: "I am a member of our excellent National Democratic Organization, which is at this moment eligible for office, on the score of far more true loyalty to the Union of our forefathers than can be found in any other organiza- tion of the present distracting period.- I will admit," says the genial chap, in a fine burst of honesty, "that our Organization has done much for the sake of the South in times past; I will admit that we have seemingly sided with the sunny South for the sake of our party.  I will \   *I           THRD SERIES.         ft admit," says this candid chap, with a slight cough, is that our excellent Democratic Organization has at times seemed to sympathize with our wayward sisters for the sake of itself as an Organization. But now," says the impressive chap majestically, " having heard the recent news from Sumter, the excellent Organization of which I am a part, stands ready to sacrifice everything for the sake of the Union, and demands that it shall be admitted to all the privileges of undisguised loyalty." Here the excited chap blushed ingenuously, and says he . "Any offices which you might have to dispose of would be acceptable to the Organization of which I am a prominent part." The Honest Abe was wiping the blade of his jack- knife with his thumb at the time, and says he:  What you say about the present willingness of the Organization to sacrifice everything for the sake of the Union, neighbor, reminds me of a small tale. When I was beating the prairies for clients in Illinois," says the Honest Abe, smiling at the back of the hand in which he held the jack-knife,-" when I was stalking for clients, I knew an old 'un named Job Podger, who lived at Peoria."' Here the honest Abe leaned away over the arm of his chair toward the attentive political chap, and says he - "Podger didn't know as much as would fill a four-inch spelling-book; but he had enough money to make educa- tion quite dispensable, and his wife knew enough for all the rest of the family. This wife was a very good woman in her way," says the Honest Abe, kindly, -" she was a  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7327-00000006"/> O       ORPiHEUS C. KERB PAPERS. very good woman in her way, and made my friend Pod- ger so happy at home that he never dared to go away from home without her permission. Her temper," says the Honest Abe, putting one of his feet upon the sill of the nearest window, -u-her temper was of the useful nature to keep my friend Podger and the children sufficiently warm all the year round, and I don't think she ever called Job Podger an Old Fool except when company was present. If she had one peculiarity more than another, it was this: she was always doing some- thing for Podger's sake." Here the political chap was seized with a severe cough; but the Honest Abe only smiled pleasantly at his jack- knife, and went on: "She was always doing something for Podger's sake. Did she buy a new dress, it was for Podger's sake; did she have a tea-party and a quilting-bee, it was solely for the sake of Podger; did she refuse to contribute for the fund of the heathen, it was solely on account of Mr. Podger.   But her strong point in this matter," says the Honest Abe, leaning back in his chair against the wall, and scraping the sole of his left boot with his knife, " her strong point was, that she endured a great deal of suffer- ing for Podger's sake.  Did she sprain her ankle on the cellar-stairs, she would say: 'Just see what I suffer for your sake, Podger;' did she have a  sick headache from drinking too much Young Hyson, she would tie up her face in camphor, and say: ' Only see, Podger, how much I  bear for your sake;' did she catch cold from standing too long before a dry-goods shop window, she would go and sit in a dark room with a flannel stocking round her   THRD SERIES.         " neck, murmuring: ' I was a goose ever to marry such a fool of a man as you be,-- but I am willing to suffer even tins for your sake.' In fact," says the Honest Abe, com- mencing to cut his nails, - "in truth, that woman was always suffering for Podger's sake, and Podger felt him- self to be a guilty man. "One day, I remember, my friend Podger and his wife were going to Chicago to buy a new set of furs for Pod- ger's sake, and just as Podger got comfortably nested in his seat in the car, the suffering woman ate a lozenge, and says she: ' Hshan't be fit to live, Podger, if you don't go out to the baggage car again, and make certain sure that they'll get all our baggage.' "Now Podger had been out six times before to see ,- about the same thing," says the Honest Abe, earnestly; 'C he'd been out six times before, and began to feel wrathy. Our baggage I' says he, ( OUR baggage! Mrs. Podger.' Here my friend Podger grew very red in the face, and says he: 'I rather like that, you know,- OUR bag- gage!-two brass-bound trunks and covers, belonging to Mrs. Podger; three carpet-bags and one reticule with ' steel lock, the property of Mrs. P.; two bandboxes and a green silk umbrella, belonging to Mary Jane Podger; three shawls tied up in a newspaper, and two baskets, owned by Mrs. M. J. Podger; one clean collar and a , razor, carried by Job Podger. OUR baggage!' "Here my friend Podger attempted to laugh sardon- ically behind his, collar, and came near going straight into apoplexy. Would you believe it," says the Honest Abe, poking the political chap in the ribs with his jack-knife, "would you believe it? Mrs. Podger burst at once into  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7327-00000007"/> 12      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. bitter tears, and says she: ' Oh, o-h I a-hoo-hoo-hoo! to think I should have to suffer in this way for my husband's sake!' It wasn't long after that," says the Honest Abe, lowering his tone, '6 it wasn't very long after that, when Mrs. P. took a violent cold on her lungs,'from standing too long on the damp ground at a camp-meeting for Pod- ger's sake, and was soon a very sick woman. ' What particularly frightened my friend Podger was, that she didn't say that this was for his sake for two whole days, and in his horror of mind he went and brought a clergyman to see her. This clergyman," says the Honest Abe, with reverence of manner, " this clergyman was not one of those sombre, forlorn pastors, who would make you think that it is a grievous thing to be a priest unto your benignant Creator; he rather indicated by his ever- cheerful manner that the only perpetual happiness is to be found in a life of pious ministrations. When he followed my friend Podger to the bedside, he smiled encouragingly at the sick Mrs. P., and rubbed his hands, and says he: ' How do -we find ourselves now, my dear madam? Are we about to die this pleasant morning?' She answered hip feebly," says the Honest Abe, feelingly, " she answered him feebly, for she was very weak. She said that she feared she had nqt spent her life as she should, but trusted that the prayers she had breathed during her hours of pain would not be unanswered. ' Ah!' said she, ' I feel that I could suffer still more than I have suffered, for my Intercessor's sake! ' "The moment she uttered these last words," says the Honest Abe, "' the' moment she uttered these words, my friend Podger, who had been standing near the door, the           Tl 1}rD SEMtIES.1 very picture of misery, suddenly gave a start, brightened up with a look of intense joy, beckoned the clergyman to follow him into the kitchen, and fairly danced down stairs. In fact, the good minister found him dancing about the kitchen like one possessed, and says he: "' Mr. Podger 1 Job Podger! I am shocked. What can you mean by such conduct?' l "My friend Podger caught him around the neck, and says he: " 'She's going to get well-she's going to get well I knew she wouldn't go and leave her poor old silly Job in that way., Oh, an't I a happy old fool, though! "The clergyman stepped back in alarm, and says he: "' Are you mad, sir? How do you know your wife will get well?' "Poor Podger looked upon the parson with a face that fairly beamed, and says he: ' How do I know it? Why, didn't you hear her yourself? he's commenceto call  names!" Here the Honest Abe smiled abstractedly out of the window, and says he: ' She did get well, too, and -lived to suffer often again for Podger's sake: You see," says the Honest Abe, turning suddenly upon the political chap, as though he had not seen him before,- -"you see, Mrs. Podger had been so *much in the habit of suffering everything for my friend -Podger's sake, that when she spoke of suffering even for the noblest cause, he naturally thought she was only call- ing names. And that's the way," says the Honest Abe, cheerfiully, " that's the way with your Democratic Organ- ization. It has been so long in the habit of sacrificing  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7327-00000008"/> "     ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. everything for the sake of the sunny South and Party, that when it talks of sacrificing both for the sake of the holy cause of Union, it seems to me as though it is only calling names!" Immediately upon the termination of this wholesome domestic tale, the political chap sprang from his seat, smiled feebly at the ceiling for a minute, crammed his hat down over his eyes, and fled greatly demoralized. The New Year, my boy, dawns blithely upon our dis- tracted country as accurately predicted by the Tribune Al- manac; and having given much deep thought to the mat- ter, I am impressed with the conviction that the first of January is-indeed the commencement of the year. There is something solemn in the idea; it is the period when our tailors send in their little bills, and when fresh thoughts of the negro race steal upon our minds. How many New Years have arrived only to find the unoffending American, of African descent, a hopeless bondman,toiling in hopeless servitude, and wearing coarse underclothing! Occasion- ally, my boy, he would wear a large seal ring, but it was always brass; and now and then he would exhibit a large breastpin, butwit was always galvanized. When I seemmy fellow-mnen here wearing much jewelry, I think of the un- offending negro, and say to myself, " from the game shop, by all that's bogus!" Twas on New-Year's Eve that I took prominent part in a great literary entertainment at the tent of Captain Villiam Brown, near the shore of Duck Lake; and re- sponded to universal mackerel desire by sweetly singing an historical Southern   THRD SERIES.

I know not what there was way down in the black recesses of the man's hidden soul to make him want so much pork and beans. I look into my heart to find an answer to the question, but no answer comes. Providence does not reveal altl things to us. Is it not well it should be so? "He was a hard, iron-looking, adamantine man. His eyes were glowing furnaces for the crucibles of thought.

"John Smith hiccupped, as he helped himself to some more pork and beans. He did not notice that the foot which he had semi-consciously placed on a pale, sickly child, was beginning to move. But it did move, and there crawled from under it the shape of a diseased dwarf of womanhood. This timid, pallid thing, uplifted itself to its bleeding feet, and nestled to the side of John Smith.

"The sickly little waif cringed closer to that inscruta- ble great heart which underlaid a soul of eternal question- ing. She shuddered like a wounded hog, but could not answer. An inward fever was devouring her. "The man took some more pork and beans. ' Girletta,' he said, almost fiercely, ' the beasts teach me a lesson; but I will not, dare not, SHALL not heed it. I want a home; my heart demands some one to work for me; to support me. I am weary of labor, and want some one to labor and toil and suffer for me, and do my washing. I love you. Have me.' "The atom of womanhood contorted her diseased feat- ures into the pale twist of agony, and her bosom heaved with stormy wavings, like the side of a tortured and chok- ing brute. Falling to the ground, she writhed, and strug- gled, and kicked convulsively, as though seized with some inward pang. Then she rose slowly to her shattered little feet, and drew an old cupboard to the middle of the wretched cave and beat her head against it.

What were his thoughts as he looked down on that miniature fragment of womanly humanity? Perhaps he thought that there might be angels way up in heaven just like her. Bright seraphs, with ruby eyes, and silver wings, and golden harps, and just such pale, haggard, gaunt, sunken, bleared little faces. "' Girletta,' he said,' I hereby make thee mine.

Do you think they were any less happy, because they were way down in a dreamy, rayless coal-mine, where men work their souls away to give others warmth? If you think so, you have never felt what true love is. Your degraded and starless nature has never had one true soul to lean upon. When you lean upon a soul, you see everything through that soul, which gives its own hue to everything. Man's love is a pane in his bosom, and through that pane the eyes of woman look forth to see the new world. The medium is the ultimatum. God gives us love that we may live more cheaply an' happily together than if we were separate. A bread-pud- ding is richer where there are two hearts, than plum-pud- ding is to one alone. The world will learn this yet, and then the lion will lie down with the lamb, and even you will be less depraved. The First of April found Jolmn Smith unmarried, but it left him nearly wedded.

Are there not dozens of Smiths in this world, - ay, even John Smiths? I should think so, my boy, - I should think so. On Friday morning, I went to Accomac, to attend the funeral of a young chap who had finished with delirium tremens, and was deeply affected by the funeral sermon of the Mackerel Chaplain, who had kindly volunteered for the occasion. Having shaken hands with the parents of deceased, the worthy man commenced the service. He said that man was born to die. He had known a number of men to die, and believed that death was every man's lot. If our dear brother here could speak, he would say that it was his lot. What was death, after all, but an edict of liberty'? Death was the event that set us free, and freedom was a priceless blessing. 'Political dema- gogues pretended to believe that certain men should be, the slaves of other men, because their skins were a little darker than the - others. What a bright argument was this! If dark skins disentitled men to freedom, he (the speaker) could point out more than one Democrat who certainly ought to be a slave. (Great laughter.) Freedom was plain- ly the condition Providence intended for all men, without regard to color, no matter what Tammany Hall might say to the contrary. It was because we had permitted a vio- lation of this condition in the cases of four millions of fel- low-beings, that this terrible war had come upon us. We Ailii could only conquer by declaring the slaves, now and forever, FREE! (Tumultuous and enthusiastic applause.)  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7327-00000013"/> 24      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. It was the duty of every loyal man to see that this princi- ple was carried out, even as they were about to carry their departed brother out: though it must not be inferred that he meant it should be carried out on beer. (Great laugh- ter.) When we had once settled this matter at home, we could afford to say to John Bull and Louis Napoleon: ' Interfere if you dare. We are ready for you both." [Male parent of the deceased -"Why don't you go and fight yourself?"] That gentleman who spoke then, is as bad as the patient who said to the doctor who was rec- ommending some wholesome medicine to him: "Why don't you take it yourself, if it's good?" (Great laughter and applause.) But he would detain them no longer, or the papers would say that he had talked politics. At the conclusion- of this discourse, my boy, the male parent of the deceased offered the following preamble and resolution: WHEREAS, It has pleased an inscrutable and all-wise Providence to free our departed brother from the bonds of life; and WHEREAS, Freedom is the normal condition of all man- kind: therefore, be it RESOLVED, That we will vote for no man who is not in favor of Universal Liberty, without respect to color. Passed, unanimously. Politics, my boy, are, in themselves, a distinct system of life and death; and when we say that a man is politically dead, we mean that even his en-graving is forgotten; and that the brick which he carries in his hat is a species of head-stone.

LETTER  LXXXI, A  SHOWING HOW A MNION OF TYRANNY WAS TERRIBLY PUNISHED FOR INTERFERING WITH THE CONSERVATIVE WOMEN OF AMERICA; AND DESCRIBING THE KENTUCKY CHAP'S REMARKABLE SKIRMSH WITH HS THANKSGIVING DINNER. WASHINGTON, D. 0., Jan. 7th, 1863. As I make it a practice to pay all my honest debts, my boy, and have never flagellated a person of African descent, I could not properly come under the head of "Chivalry?" in an American dictionary, though I might possibly come under its feet in the "Union-as-it-Was ;" yet I have that in my nature which revolts at the thought of a war against women, and am sufficiently chivalrous to defend any cause whose effects are crinoline. The bell- shaped structure called Woman, my boy, was created expressly to conquer unresisting adversaries; to win en- gagements without receiving 'a blow, and to do pretty much as she pleases, by pleasing pretty much as she does. She is a harmless creation of herself, my boy; and to war directly against her because she may chance to influence her male friends to war against us, is about as sensible as it would be to execrate our hatter because a gust of wind blows our new beaver into the mud. If the hatter had not made the hat, the wind could not have blown it off, and if God had not made women, she could not encourage the well-known Southern Confederacy against us; but  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7327-00000014"/> ; s!      26      ORPHEUS C.

Not if we know ourselves, .my boy, and recognize the high moral spirit of justice obsEvable in the Constitution. , Being thus possessed of a reverence for that sex whose bonnets remind me of cake-baskets, I cannot refrain from frowning indignantly upon that horrible spirit of national tyranny which has inspired Sergeant O'Pake, -of the de- moralized Mackerel Brigade, to issue the following "( GENERAL ORDER. "For the purpose of simplifying national strategy to those conservative women of America who, while en- gaged in the pursuit of happiness as guaranteed by the Constitution, desire to-visit the Southern Confederacy, it is ordered that they shall answer the following paternal questions before passing the lines of the Mackerel Brigade: "I. For how many years has your age been Just Twenty-two? "II. How many novels do you consume per week? "H. Were you ever complained of to the authorities for inordinate piano-forte playing? "IV. Do you work slippers for the heathen? "V. If so; for what He, then? "'VI. What newspaper's ' Marriages and Deaths' do you consider the best? "VII. In selecting a church to attend, what colored prayer-book do you find most becoming to your complex- ion? "VIII. How much display of neck do you consider   necessary to indicate a Modesty which shrinks from show- ing an ankle? "IX. Did you ever stoop to folly? or is it Folly alone that stoops to you? "X. Did you ever eat as much as you wanted at din- ner, when members of the opposite sex were opposite? "It is also ordered that no female visitor to the cele- brated Southern Confederacy shall carry more than eight large trunks and a bonnet-box for each month in the year; and that no female shall pass the line, whose dimensions in full dress exceed the ordinary space be- tween two pickets, as the latter will, on no account be permitted to edge away from their stations at this trying crisis in the history of our distracted country. ' O'PAKE, "Sergeant Mackerel Brigade." This inhuman order had scarcely been issued when there came to the Mackerel lines in front of Paris a virtuous young female, aged 23 with the figures reversed, who was disgusted with the great vulgarity of the North, and wished to visit the marriageable Southern Confederacy, having heard that the Confederacy was carefully Husbanding its resources. Being a poor girl, with " nothing to wear," she only had seven Saratoga trunks, ten bandboxes, four- teen small carpet-bags, and a lap-dog; yet the ill-bred O'Pake was suspicious enough to examine one of her trunks.

"When tyrant purpose made the martial fool With brief authority profoundly drunk, Unto his minions issued forth a rule, To search each Southward-going woman's trunk. "There was a Sergeant of the Mack'rel ranks Made one attempt to carry out the law; But alhT- to Providence a thousand thanks!- He met a doom to fill the soul with awe. "Scarce had his impious hands the task begun ;- Scarce had he ope'd the vast and mammoth thing, - When, from the trunk's interior Phlegethon, Came forth a horrid phantom, with a spring I "It was a dreadful monster, without flesh, Made up of ever-less'ning, perfect hoops; More terrible to vision than secesh, With all his ragged, whiskey-drinking troops. "The wretched Sergeant started back with fear, And would have 'soaped the penalty incurred; But, ah! the spectre caught him by an ear, And held him trembling like a prisoned bird. "Wrought up to frenzy by mishap so dire, He struck the phantom in his thoughtless rage; But 'twas like fanning to put out a fire, And straight his hand was tangled in a cage!   ," And then his other tyrant hand he tried To ease the springs that pressed him ev'rywhere; His futile blow the Skeleton defied,-- His other hand was taken in a snare! "Then round his form the dread avenger coiled, Like snakes' backbones in unelastic curl; By prison-bars his wished retreat is foiled, And in a cage behold the trembling churl. a Still mad with terror at his grievous plight, He lifts a foot, as' though to kick at last; When, lo I his leg goes through an op'ning slight, And there two wiry circles hold it fast. "He plunges, staggers, tries to tear the bands Which make that woman's Skeleton complete i Then reeleth blindly unto where she stands, And falls in helpless bondage at her feet 1" When the poor tool of tyranny was released from this terrific skeleton, he looked as bewildered as one who had just returned from the outskirts of civilization; but still his fiendish taste for trunk-inspection was not conquered. He returned to the edge of the wardrobe abyss, dreWforth an immense white article, and says he: "Do my spectacles relate a fiction, or is this indeed a Sibley tent for the use of the Confederacy?" At this moment the excellent young woman hastily snatched the article away from him, and says she: "' You nasty thing, that's my " - here she blushed.

At other times, it is the eloquent protest of a fine intelligence which deprecates the test that would turn all its hidden beauties to the public eye, and means: Humility is born of Genius. But in this case, it was the lurid flush of anger, and meant -a petticoat. Not wishing to further betray the reproachful fact that he was an unmarried Mackerel, Sergeant O'Pake closed the trunk with emphasis, and permitted the triumphant young woman of America to trip it lightly to the South. The Mackerel Brigade at present constitutes one of three parallel lines, the other two being the celebrated City of Paris and the well known Southern Confederacy. Paris is the central one, and may be called the line of bat- tle, over which the Orange County Howitzers are contin- ually hurling shot and shell at the glorious sun. During the day it is much frequented by Southern Confederacies, who drink anything that will pour into a tumbler; and in the evening it is visited by our indomitable troops, who go to look at the empty bottles. You may ask, my boy, why the Confederacies are not routed, and Paris occupied? I X answer, that the new  General of the Mackerel Brigade will not attack an inferior force, and is waiting until there i shall be something worth killing on the opposite side. Too : often did the former General of the Mackerel Brigade make the mistake this high-minded conduct is intended to X avoid; too often, after an interval of only a- few months, did he lead the majestic Mackerels ahead of him into the field, and then hastily retire, upon finding that the Con- . federacies were too inferior in numbers to make their con- quest worth while. But we  shall have no more such   l   THRD SERIES.         81 mistakes, for the new General will not move against the foe until the latter is strong enough to make carnage de. sirable.

On Thanksgiving Day, however, we had a skirmish of thrilling intensity. The conservative Kentucky chap, ray boy, has got command of Company 2, Regiment 1, and having drilled them in swearing, to the sound of the Eman- cipation Proclamation, for a whole fortnight, he has brought them to a high state of discipline and profanity. On Thurs- day morning, just after one of our scouts had cleaned his spectacles, he beheld a Confederate turkey emerge from this side of Paris and proceed to insult the United States of America by hideous gobblings. The alarm was at once given, and after swearing at his men to give them confi- dence, the conservative Kentucky chap led them forth to capture the obscene bird. Onward pushed the spectacled veterans, with fixed bayonets, addressing their eyes with pleasant oaths, and hoping that they might meet Horace Greeley. The Confederate turkey was eating a worm at the mo- ment, and only paused long enough to eye our troops with that species of disdain which comest of Southern birth. He felt, as it were, that he was protected by the Constitu- tion of our forefathers.

The conservative Kentucky chap spat at a copy of the "Tribune," which he threw upon the ground for the pur- pose, and says he:    : "Notwithstanding any Proclamations whatsoever, Ken- tucky is not waging this war against the institution of slavery.

Here the Confederate turkey, who had finished his worm, turned heavily from the scene, and presently disappeared H on the other side of Paris. The Kentucky chap still kept staring afar off, and says / he: "Why, I can see him, though he appears to be at a great distance."

It had been secretly placed there the night before by a Democratic chap from the Sixth Ward, to give a constitutional turn to the war.

If our excellent national Demo- cratic Organization would have less talking during their public speeches, my boy, there need be no such inhu- man mistakes as that which has calumniated and utterly prostrated the Venerable Gammon. On Wednesday I took a trot on the war-path upon the architectural street, Pegasus, and found the veteran Mackerel Brigade back at Paris again. They had made a great march from the Blue Ridge, my boy, and when I reached the front I found a scientific chap from Cin- cinnati taking observations. He stuck a tall stick into the ground, and scratched a long line on the damp sod, , from the foot of this stick to the extreme right of the spec- tacled Brigade, letting the toes of the front rank of the Mackerels just touch it. Then he attached a powerful magnifying-glass to about the centre of the upright stick, and commenced looking through it very intently all along the line he had drawn. I observed him attentively, and says I: "What is the nature of your contract with the Government, my serious friend?" He rubbed the glass with his blue silk pocket-handker- chief, and says he: "I have invented this useful arrange- ment to ascertain whether or not the Army of Accomac is really advancing. I closely watch the line to which the toes of the front rank of the army are already very near, and could almost swear that the forward movement is still going on. The average speed of this army," says the scientific chap, calculatingly, "has hitherto been six miles in six weeks; but now that the war is about to corn- 4  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7327-00000020"/> 88      ORPHEU8 C.

And so they were, my boy, so they were; for the heel of the first rank's boots were almost on the line in less than an hour, --no Confederacies being in sight. Noticing a circle of Mackerel Officers a short distance a: in my-rear, I dismounted from Pegasus and walked thith-  er for greater speed, discovering that the brilliant staff were admiring the great equestrian gambols of the new Xi General of the Mackerel Brigade. , The new General is a dignified, middle-aged chap, my,  boy, with a face which expresses many whiskers, and an f eve to look you through and through when your meaning is transparent. He is not quite two yards high, has a i: head which looks like a lustrous apple-dumpling, dropped into the middle of a window-brush, and graduates down- ward into his boots without seeming to be either growing out of them, or running through them. And he is none of your military popinjays, my boy, all plastered with buttons and gold lace, but an earnest, hard- X working soldier.  His dress for the field is characterized by genuine republican simplicity, and consists of hard-,  working corduroy breeches, sternly patched; an earnest X pea-jacket, resolutely out at the elbows; a pair of straight- forward slippers, unflinchingly ragged around the toes, and an untrifling silk hat, determinedly mashed-in at various points. You feel as you look at him, my boy, that he means hard work, and is indifferent to good clothes as long as he  can save his distracted country. On the majestic brow of a true hero, a shocking bad hat is a far nobler, more glittering crown, than the circle i   TmlrxD SERIES.        39O  ,f filthy lucre which surmounts the head of Europe's bloated lespot. Grander, far grander is the nightcap of a Wash- ngton, than any style of army cap I have yet seen. The new General was mounted upon a long-tailed cob, mnd his horsemanship thrilled this manly bosom with rap- ure. Did he wish to deliver an order to his aid, he but lightly tightened the reins of his horse, and at once the loble animal arose to his hind legs and fired off a pistol leld for him by an orderly. Did he wish to go the rounds, ie but touched the left flank of his horse, and straightway the sagacious charger struck into a graceful waltz, leaping aver five-barred gates as he went along, and dashing through hoops held aloft by the troops. Did he desire to approach one of his Generals for consultation, he had but to give a low whistle, and forthwith the intelligent animal limped about on three feet, as though lame, and drank a bottle of wine presented' to him by an orderly. Did he have an inclination to review his troops, he was compelled only to gently pinch his horse's neck, and at once the graceful beast laid down upon his side and pretended to die as naturally as any human being. In short, my boy, it is argued from the earnest new General's bad clothes, that he will speedily bring the war to a good close ; and from his being such a particular horse- man, that he will never become any party's footman. But let me change -my subject for a time, and relate the great triumph of our new naval artillery on Duck Lake, which majestic sheet of water has returned to earth with the late rains. Rear Admiral Head has so improved the deadly swivel- gun of the Mackerel iron-plated squadron, that it will  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7327-00000021"/> 40 ,     ORPHEUS C.

The secret of this improvement is known. only to the Government, my boy, and will be used to ad- vantage when our gory conflict with combined Europe comes off.                      i It was on Thursdayv morning, my boy, when an en- thusiastic military mob, consisting of Captain Villiam  Brown, Captain Bob Shorty, and myself, stood once more upon the familiar shore of Duck Lake. The squadron, which has been named the "Secretary Welles," having been launched upon the treacherous element by Rear Ad- miral Head and one Mackerel, we took out our pieces of :: smoked glass and prepared for the naval pageant. We could plainly see the stern old Rear Admiral bustling about on the gallant Grandmother of the Seas, as I may term the noble craft, and hear him swearing in  his iron-plated manner.   "'Fracture my turret," says the old sea-dog, "if I X don't think this gun will surpass the Armstrong; block- X ade me, if I don't." When' it became the duty of the solitary Mackerel -: crew to load the awful instrument of destruction, it was discovered that the ramrod had been left behind at the Navy Yard Foundry.  This nautical disaster might have I marred  the experiments, had not the Rear Admiral chanced to have his brown gingham umbrella along with him.  This was used as a rammer, and the experiment proceeded.  The first charge was twenty pounds of powder, not more than nineteen of them running out of the touch-. hole.   The ball slightly touched the water and went  :;:/ i   THRD SERIES.         41  ' down, the recoil of the squadron being only the width of Duck Lake. The second shot was made with only one pound of powder, as it was feared that the rudder might be strained by too much concussion, and we saw the ball drop into the ocean wave. At this shot, the "Secretary Welles " only hopped out of the water a few inches. The third shot was made with half a pound of powder, as it was not deemed advisable to do too much damage to the sur- rounding country by the gunnery. We were gazing intently at the merciless implement of death, through our smoked glass, when this shot was fired, and suddenly beheld a phenomenon which made us catch our breath. Mixed up with the fire and smoke, there emerged from the mouth of the swivel-gun, what appeared to be an im- mense brown bird of some kind, spreading its huge wings as it came out, and skimming wearily to the shore! Captain Bob Shorty commenced to quake, and says he: "It's a Confederate insect!" J "No," says Villiam, lowering his smoked glass, and speaking in a solemn whisper, 4' It's the distracted bird of our country, floating spectrally on the battle-smoke. Ah!" says Villiam, abstractedly uncorking my canteen, "our distracted bird is no inseck." Was it indeed a majestic Eagle, my boy, stooping from his clouded heights to sanctify the terrible naval scene? I guess not, my boy, - I guess not; for we presently ascer- tained that, when the careless Mackerel crew rammed home that last charge, he heedlessly left Rear-Admiral &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7327-00000022"/> 42      ORPHEUS C.

REFERRING TO WASHINGTON CITY AND THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE, AND GIVING THE SOUHEKRN CONFEDERACY'S VERY REASONABLE PEACB PROPOSITION. WASHGTON, D. C., Jan. 28th, 1863. THE city of Washington, my boy, without her Congress, is like a maiden without her plighted young man. She surveys herself in the mirror of the Potomac, and says she: "Where's my Congress, without whom I am like a gas bracket deserted by its old flame?" Alas! all flesh is gas, my boy, and some of our congressmen are very fleshy. Their presence it is that makes Washington a light for the world, and many of them who once rode high horses have alighted. At the present moment our distracted country is enveloped in darkest night, and the day seems so far off that many Mackerels despair of ever seeing payday, even. At such a time what a blessing is that Congress which burns to illumine us after the man- ner of an elaborate chandelier I jit passes away to leave everything dark; it returns, and behold all is darkey. I was in my room at my hotel, when Congress com- menced to arrive, conversing with Captain Bob Shorty; and, as a seedy-looking, middle-aged chap passed by on the opposite tide of the street, the captain looked out of- the window, and says he: "That's one of the new legislators, my Pythias."

"Why," says Captain Bob Shorty, profoundly, " an old congressman never wears a tall hat. An old congress- man,' says Captain Bob Shorty, sagely, " always wears a soft hat, so that it wont be injured by being knocked over his eyes i'  I pondered deeply over this idea, my boy, and it seemed to me that a soft hat must be the real Cap of Liberty.                        d  Passing over the organization of Senate and House, which suggested thoughts of ancient Rome about the time she was saved by geese, I shall proceed to notice the Mes- ! sage which our honest Abe fired into Congress from his intellectual breastworks during the week. You have undoubtedly read this Abe L. paper, my boy, in the reliable morning journals, making due allow- ance for the typographical outrages committed by printers of opposite politics; but there was one portion of it gotten up for the honest Abe by the Chaplain of the Mackerel Brigade, and this portion is so mutilated in the publishing, that I cannot refrain from giving you the true version. Speaking of the cost to the country of Emancipation  X with compensation, the Chaplain wrote: -i "Certainly it is not so easy to pay something as it is to pay nothing; but it is easier to pay a small sum than  it is to pay a large sum; and it is easier to pay any bill when we have the money, than it is to pay a smaller bill when we have'no money.  Compensatedt Emanci- pation requires no more money than would be necessary to the progress of Remunerated Enfranchisement, which   THRD SERIES.         45 would not close before the end of five hundred years. At that time, we shall undoubtedly have five hundred' times as many people as we have: now, provided that no one dies in the mean time; arid supposing the premium on gold to increase in the same ratio as it has increased since our last census was taken, the premium on the specie belonging to five hundred times our present popu- lation will be amply sufficient to pay for all persons of African descent. "tI do not state this inconsiderately. At the same ratio of increase as we now realize, American gold will soon be worth more than all Europe. We have ten mil- lions nine hundred and sixty-three thousand miles, while Europe has three millions eight hundred thousand, and yet the average premium on specie, in some of the States, is already above that of Europe. Taking the brokers in the aggregate, I find that if one gold dollar is worth $1.30 in one year, It will be worth $2.60 in two years, " "  "  "   3.90 "  3  " "( "6 "  "   5.20 " 4   6 " "  "4 "6   6.50 " 5   "C This shows a yearly increase. If a gold dollar is worth $6.50 in five years, it will, of course, be worth $3,250 or five hundred times as much in five hundred years. Thus, when our population is five hundred times as great as at present, supposing each man to have a single gold dollar, the premium of $3,250 on his gold dollar will enable such man to purchase thirty-two and a half persons of African descent from the loyal slaveholders of our border States at et  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7327-00000024"/> "      ORPHEUS C.

X "This scheme of emancipation would certainly make the war shorter than it now has a prospect of being. In a - word, it shows that a dollar will be much harder to pay for the war than will be a dollar for emancipation on the pro- posed plan."    -  You will observe, my boy, that this same great mathe- matical idea is advanced in the Message as it is printed; f but our Honest Abe has chosen to vary the terms some- what. If you have a gold dollar, my boy, salt it down 3 for five hundred years, and some future generation of off- t spring will call you blessed for leaving them $3,250 in postage-stamps.                   '. On my last journey toward Paris, finding the Mackerel Brigade still halting before that ancient city, I rode  straight to the tent of Captain Villiam Brown, whom I found making himself a fall overcoat from some old news- papers, while the Chaplain sat near by, making himself a pair of shoes from a remnant of calico. "4 Well, paladin," says I to Villiam, " what is it that so long detains our noble army on the path of conquest?" Villiam sighed as he used a little more paste to fasten the sleeves of the garment he was constructing, and says he: " It's the overcoats." "Why," says I, epigrammatically, "don't they go far enough forward in front?" ' Ah!" says Villiam, thoughtfully, "they come far enough forwar4 in front, but then they leave the rear ex- posed. On Monday," says Villiam, reflectively, "Company i I   THRD SERIES,         47 Three's overcoats arrived, and I requested the warriors to attire themselves after the designs of frequent fashion- plates. But scarce had their manly forms commenced to assume the garments, when the garments tore frantically from their warlike shapes." "Hum!" says I, questioningly, 4" the overcoats were Rebels in disguise." "No," says Villiam, gloomily, (" but it took two Mack- erels to hold an overcoat together while another warrior put it on, and when it was buttoned in front, the rear pre- sented the aspeck of two separate departments. I am now making myself a stronger coat of Democratic newspa- pers," says Villiam, explainingly, " in order that my Con- stitution may be protected from harm." B I glanced at him askant, my boy, and says I, innocently, "I see a still better reason for your clothing yourself for battle in newspapers." "Ah!" says Villiam, complacently, " you think that I adopt the intellectual gayment to show that my line of battle is ten cents a line.", "1 No, my hero," says I, pleasantly, "I think you clothe yourself for battle in printed matter, to make sure that ' he who runs may read?"'  I would not say positively that Villiam "saw" this agreeable remark, my boy. I am not prepared to affirm that he took the hit; but as the canteen left his hand, my ears recognized a hasty whiz, and the effect upon the side of the tent, near my head, was perforating. Turning from the spot, I next had my attention attracted by a tall whiskered chap, in a paralyzed whirlpool of gray rags, who was closely examining a stack of Mackerel mus- 3  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7327-00000025"/> 48      ORPHEUS C.

Hearing me ask his object, he re- ::: marked casually that I was a " mudsill," and says he:  "As the unconquerable Southern Confederacy has a ,great contempt for the Yankee army, it has sent me here X to see whether these muskets are worth taking. If they :;] proved to be worth taking, the war was to continue; if not, X I was to offer indirect proposals for peace, .as the Sunny South does not wish to protect a struggle that does not pay."                         X Instead of replying to him, I stepped aside to give place ?:! to the Conservative Kentucky chap, who had just been ljt; denouncing the Message to the Mackerel Chaplain in the tent, and was greatly outraged by the Chaplain's response. It seems that he had abruptly addressed the Chaplain, and says he: "If that Message wants to make the nigger the equal of the conservative element by implication, I hereby announce that Kentucky considers herself much offended. I fight for that flag," says he, hotly, pointing to the national standard, -"I fight for the stirs on that flag, to aid the cause of the white man alone; and with X the black man Kentucky will have nothing, to do what- tj ever." The Chaplain looked dreamily at the flag, as it patched a the sky above him, and says he: "For men of your way of thinking, my friend, that : banner should bear a sun, rather than the stars." "Hem!" says the Kentucky chap. "How so?" : "Why," says the Chaplain, gravely, "beneath the  v stars alone, you cannot tell a black man from a white  man. The master and slave of the broad noonday are   equals under the stars; for if the sun shines upon the one a.              i   THRD SERIES.        49 working that the other may be idle, the gentle planets of the night make master and bondman of one hue and perfect equals in Natur/e's own Republic, -starry Night. The banner for you, my friend, should bear the sun, to show that it is but for a day." - The conservative Kentucky chap came away swearing, my boy; and hence, it was in no very good humor that he now saluted the Confederate raggedier. "Hem I " says he, ungraciously, " where did all those rags come from, and what is their name?" The Confederacy hastily put on a pair of white cotton gloves, and says he: "Am I addressing the Democratic Organization?" "You address the large Kentucky branch," says the Conservative chap, pulling out his ruffles. "' Then," says the Confederacy, "' I am prepared to make an indirect proposition for peace. My name is Mr. Lamb, by which title the Democratic Organization has always known the injured Confederacy, and I propose the following terms: Hostilities shall at once cease, and the', two armies be consolidated under the title of the Confed- erate States Forces. The war-debts of the North and South shall be so united that the North may be able to pay them without confusion. An election for a new President shall at once be held, everybody voting save those who have shown animosity to the sunny South. France shall be driven out of Mexico by the consolidated armies, the expense being so managed that the North may pay it without further trouble. Upon these terms, the Confederacy will become a peaceful fellow-man." "Hem I " says the Kentucky chap, "What you ask is  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7327-00000026"/> 50      ORPHEUS C.

Here I hastily stepped up, and says I, "But are you not going to consult the President at all about it, my Jupiter Tonans?"                   i  "The President? the President?" says the Conserva- 'tive Kentucky chap, with a vague look. Hem!" says he, "I really forgot all about the President!"    i The Democratic OrganiZation, my boy, in its zeal to  benefit its distracted country, is occasionally like that eminent fire company in the Sixth Ward, which nobly  usurped with its hose the terrible business of putting out a large conflagration, and never remembered, until its beau- tiful machine was all in position, that another company  of fellow-firemen had exclusive possession of all the water- works.

PROVING THAT RUSSIA IS INDEED OUR FRIEND; INSTANCING THH TERRIFIC BOMBARDMENT OF PARIS; AND TELLING HOW THE NEW GENERAL OF THE MACKEREL BRIGADE DELIGHTED ALL WITH HS SUR- PRISING "SHAPE." WASHINGTON, D. C., February 2d, 1863. THE sagacious Russian bear, my boy, is found to regard the Eagle of our distracted country with more than his ordinary liking, for fancy poultry, and our shattered bird may feel proud of a friendship proffered by such an excel- lent beast. Truth to tell, the present aspect of our nation- al chicken is not calculated to inspire an idolatrous passion in the breast of European zoology. All his tail-feathers have seceded, and are in rebellion against him; and he has got a black eye, my boy, from strategic gambols with the playful Southern Confederacy.  Hence, we should accept the bear's affection as a marvel of disinterested emotion; for I am almost sure, my boy, I am almost sure that nothing handsomer than a bear could have much real love for such a fractured fowl. A relative of mine, named A. Merry Kerr,* went to Russia some time ago, being secretly deputed by Govern- ment to expend the amount" of his passage-money in a judicious manner. He writes to me of his friendly recep- tion by Gorchakoff, and says he: * Excepting Mr. Bayard Taylor, no ordinary traveler ever excited so much wild affecticn in the breasts of foreign kings and noblemen as this gentleman.

Having  ! brushed me off and kissed me, l-e ordered some fried  ; candles for two, and then says he:  "How   comes on the Union cause, whose pregnant Ai misery on Potomac's shore has caused the heart of the Czar untold anguish?

Upon hearing me speak thus, Mr. Gorchakoff laid my head upon his bosom and smoothed my hair, and says he: "Oh, how I love your country! Russia will never join any scheme of foreign intervention against your beautiful fish." He said this in such a tone of real fondness that tears ! sprang to my eyes, and says I: "Heaven bless you, my Muscovy duck!"   , With a look of the deepest tenderness, Mr. Gorchakoff B now extended himself at full length upon the top of a " bureau near my chair, and allowed his head to hang over in such a manner that he was enabled to press his cheek against mine. !I   THRD SERIES.        53 "Wilt thou do me one favor, noble youth?" says he, with much emotion. I placed a hand upon my heart. "Then," says he, "just ask Mr. Seward not to write so many letters to me every week; because when my mail is so large, I don't have any time to attend to my Ifamily."'  I promised to do so, and then went out to get some oysters. The candles had made me quite light-headed. From this, my boy, you will perceive that Russia " may be counted upon in an emergency ;" as the man said of the bear-skin upon which he was reckoning his small change. On Thursday, bright and early, I mounted my gothic steed Pegasus, and started for Duck Lake. Upon reaching the Mackerel camp,-I found all the spectacled warriors under arms for a fray, the unaccom- modating Confederacies on the other side of Paris having urged some rifled objections to the construction of a pqn- toon bridge across Duck Lake. The chap who was build- ing the bridge had only just untied his second'paper of nails, when a potato from some Confederate marksman, in the second-story of Paris, hit him violently in the stomach. Simultaneously the -cover of a dinner-pot cracked his knuckles, and, as he fell back in good order, a brick-bat tapped him on the head. Believing that hos- tilities had commenced, the new General of the Mackerel Brigade hastily put on all his dirty clothes, and ordered the Orange County Howitzers to commit incendiarism with Paris, simultaneously directing Rear Admiral Head to moor the "Secretary Welles " abreast of the nearest Confederacy and shell him with great slaughter.  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7327-00000028"/> 54      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. Under command of Captain Samyule Sa-mith, the  ii Howitzers were opened upon Paris, and commenced such a tornado of round shot and grape that the surrounding landscape was very much defaced. There was much noise, my boy, - there was much noise. But the great sight of the hour was the manceuvring of the iron-plated Mackerel squadron on the tempestuous  waters of Duck Lake. After hastily making. a fire in i the stove on the quarter-deck, and placing a tumbler where it could warm, the stern old Rear Admiral ordered the Mackerel crew to report how much water there was  in the hold. The crew repaired to the stern-sheets and i reported "One pitcherful and two lemons;" whereupon  the hardy old sea-dog swore in his iron-plated manner, and ordered the swivel-gun amidships to be trained upon the basement windows of Paris. Everything being in   readiness, the word was given to fire! Bang! went the horrid instrument of carnage, and the hideous missile went crashing through the back basement windows, cutting a bow from the cap of a venerable Florence Nightingale, who was at that moment making a  sponge-cake for some sick Confederacies, and driving the stove-pipe clear through the wall. The aged Nightin- gale thought that something had happened, and says  she: "Well, I never did!"               X  Rear Admiral Head smiled; but it was the horrid smile of naval bloodthirstiness. "Revolve my turret I "  says he, grimly, "I fight not against women; but the other window must be broken." The venerable Neptune leaned over his columbiad to make sure of this shot, unconsciously pressing his stomach  'I  *          ^     THRD SERIES.        55 against the but-end of his gun. There was a report, my boy; the swivel-gun kicked, and the Rear Admiral fell upon the deck with a promiscuous violence. Meanwhile, Company 3, Regiment 5, under Captain Villiam Brown, had waded across Duck Lake in as many divisions as there were Mackerels, and immediately com- menced a tremendous- fire of musketry at the upper windows of Paris, wounding a Confederacy who kept a shoe-store up there, and reducing two flower-pots to frag- ments. Whilst I was witnessing this bombardment, my boy, and admiring the courage with which Villiam was slash- ing around with his sword, I noticed that thesquadron had suddenly ceased firing. It had ceased firing, because Rear Admiral Head had unexpectedly discovered that his Mackerel crew was a Black Republican; and had therefore engaged him in single combat, greatly to the detriment of the regular engagement. Scarcely had I turned to view this new phase of war, when the firing of howitzers and musketry behind me instantly ceased, and I heard a low murmur of wonder arising from the whole brigade. Quickly turning about again, I was hastening to where Captain Bob Shorty strode with the Conic Section, when I beheld General Wobert Wobinson, the new General of the Mackerel Brigade, cantering along the shore of Duck Lake on his trained charger, and exhibiting a form to pet- rify the whole world with admiration. "Ah! there's shape!" was the low cry of the spec- tacled veterans, as they gazed breathlessly at the picture. 3*  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7327-00000029"/> 56      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS.

"Oh!" says he, panting, "what Shape!"  Rear Admiral Head heard the sound in the midst of his . single combat, and paused to ascertain what it was. His spectacles scanned the horizon round and round, until they finally rested upon the figure of the new General of the Mackerel Brigade. "Fracture my armor!" says he, ecstatically, "did I  ever survey so much Shape!"  The battle was over for that day.   :l Shape, my boy, is a great thing in a General; for when Heaven's Great Printer commenced to set human type in the L' galley " of earth, He must have needed con- siderable General matter to fully make up His- " forms;" and when a General has a form fully up to His make, we may consider him well set up.     : Yours, typographically, ORPHEUS C.

I am very cold, my boy,-I am very cold, and my hatred of the present Cabinet is in- tense. But what shall I say about the agency of this same Government in producing a Military Necessity at the late great battle of Paris? Let me put on my overcoat and express my cold in a passionate cough, as I remark that its agency in this. matter forcibly reminds me of a chap I once knew in the sixth ward.- He was an aged chap of much red nose, my boy, and ".(67)  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7327-00000030"/> 58      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. lived with his youngest broadcloth son in the same house with his Wayward Sister. The Wayward Sister being an old maid of severe countenance, occupied such por- tions of the residence as seemed most safe from the in- trusion of that sex which seeks to make 'Woman its  :! broken-hearted slave; and as long as the patient old chap answered the door-bell and didn't smoke in the house, she  got along with him after the manner of a Methodist angel. Things went on pleasantly through the winter, X the high-minded maiden using the coal of her aged kin- 3! dred, and employing all his black tea without complain- X ing; but in the spring she joined a Woman's Rights   l Convention, and commenced to hold indignation-meetings of virtuously-indigniant females in the best room in the house. These meetings having decided, that, "Whereas, Man is a ojus creature which is constantly - preying upon that sex which it is his mother's, and deny- ing to it those inalienable Rights without which Womans  sphere cannot exist. Therefore be it         i "Resolved, That Woman is the Superior Sex.  ".Resolved, That union with man is incompatible with the good of a sex which it is ourselves; and that we will  immediately take  that household fiiniture of which 0 Woman is the only rightful owner, and only ask to be let alone."  The aged chap received a copy of these resolutions, my boy, and says the Wayward Sister: "I  can no longer consent to live in the same house with an inferior being."  The chap heard her in silence, and might have let her have her own   way, under ordinary circumstances, but  when he came home   next night he found that she had -   a }i   THRD SERIES.         59 packed'up all the furniture in the house to carry off with her, and expected him to give her his watch and night- key. He scratched his head, and says he: "I cannot per- mit this sort of thing, because I really want some furni- ture for my own use." The Wayward Sister threw her thim'ble at him, and says she: "Our male parient bought this furniture only because he got married to one of the Superior Sex; and as it was Woman which solely oc- casioned its purchase, it clearly belongs to Woman." But the chap could not see it in this light, my boy ; and as soon as his son came home he told him all about it. The manly youth took a look up the stairs to, where the maiden and four or five other spring bonnets were in- trenched behind the furniture, and says he: "It's an unnatural thin'g to have trouble with relations; but I'm just going up there to capture that big chair." By this time some of the neighbors had come in, and commenced to urge the old chap to take vigorous measures. He looked at his son, and says he: "Can you do it Tommy?" The child of his bosom winked twice, and immediately prepared to perform the feat, only pausing long enough to look in the glass and see if his necktie sat well. Then, gaining the head of the stairs, he leaned across a bureau barring the way, and was about to grasp the big chair, when the Wayward Sister hit him over the head with a broom, and presently he found himself prostrate at the foot of the stairs, with a violent pain in his nose. On witnessing this disaster, all the neighbors shrank with indignation from the aged father, and said it was all his doings. The poor old chap scratched his head, and says he                   -  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7327-00000031"/> 60      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS.

"Interfering?" says the paternal vchap, innocently. "Why, how could I interfere with Tommy, when I only let him do, in his own way, what he gave me to under-  ' stand he was able to?"                 X Here all the neighbors sighed grievously, and says one: "Miserable old man, we believe you mean well enough; but the fact is, you are a species of old idiot. It was your business to have had another son, who would have been this one's brother; so that if'one met with a heart-rending failure on the stairs, the other- could simultaneously have v entered that back window by a ladder, and taken the chair by the rear. But you are always interfering. Take our advice now, and either give up drinking altogether-, . or arrange it so' that those who drink with you may be l persons not distinguishable from ourselves." And they all departed, shaking their heads, my boy-  they all departed shaking their heads; leaving the unfor- tunate old chap to bind up his offspring's nose, and to :! reflect upon the great iniquity of interfering with one son's : success, by not, having another. - The Government of our distracted country, my boy, is  i so very much like this well-meaning but imbecile old chap, that the failure of any one of its generals is entirely due to its interference in not having another general; who, in case that general did not succeed, could take his place before he failed to do so. The Military Necessity produced by this interference v -    al   THRD SERIES.         61 took place at Paris, very recently, and shortly after the new General of the Mackerel Brigade had so nearly won the battle by that revelation of manly Shape to which I referred in my last letter. Finding -that the terrible bombardment of Paris, my boy, had routed the straggling Confederacies from that ancient city, the whole Mackerel Brigade marched safely across Duck Lake, leaving only the Orange County How- itzers on this side. Scardely had the spectacled host occu- pied the city, when there appeared upon the main street the overwhelming Shape of the new General of the Mack- erel Brigade, mounted upon a steed which was almost as sagacious as a human being; and holding his hat in one hand, after the manner of Washington entering Trenton. It was as though Frank Leslie's illustrated artist had just been commanded to draw a warlike picture, my boy, rep- resenting one of those equestrian heroes who all appear in precisely the same attitude, and seem to have lifted their hats for the particular purpose of showing with what math- ematical precision their hair is parted. Instantly there arose cheers so loud that they must have been heard by the cowardly Confederacies on the hills behind Paris, and several Mackerels became so enthusias- tic to be led against the enemy, that they actually started on the war-path by themselves, and only turned back when they discovered that they happened to be going in the wrong direction. Having received all the cheers, and immediately dis- patched them to the reliable morning journals around the country, the General of the Mackerel Brigade ordered the Conic Section, under Captain Bob Shorty, and Company  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7327-00000032"/> 62      ORPHEUS C.

Samyule formed his veterans in the shape of a horse- shoe, and says he: "Comrades, now is the time to repent of your sins, for  you haven't got much time left. As for myself," says Samyule, seriously, c; my sins are all those of commission, i and those who gave me my commission are responsible for them.  If any of you younger Mackerels have in your possession the last things your mothers gave you, now is  your chance to look upon them-for the last time." As Samyule spoke thus, a small blue object, carrying a drum, toddled forth from thie ranks, and saluted. It was a small Mackerel drummer, my boy, who had enlisted only ten days before, and his small eyes were wet with tears. The heroic child wiped his little nose on his sleeve, and  says he:   - "My mother gave me something."           -I Samyule was greatly affected, and says he:       "Was it the Family Bible, sweet cherub?      ! X No-0-o," sobbed the innocent,.as though his little heart X would break. Samyule wiped his tear-dimmed spectacles, and says he: "' Perhaps it was her daguerreotype?" The infant wept afresh, and says he: "No-o-o.;"  "Then," says Samyule, in a broken voice, " it must i have been her blessing."   THRD SERIES.          63 "No I no-o-o," cried the small Mackerel drummer, with quivering lips.            . "Then what in thunder was it that your mother gave you?" says Samyule, greatly bewildered. "It was a spanking!" screamed the affectionate little creature, cramming both his little fists into his little eyes, and blubbering unrestrainedly. Samyule gazed a moment at the child, and says he: "Well may affection bid thee weep, thou tender little one'! When a sweetheart blushingly places, a rose upon her lover's breast, the scene is affecting; but my own memory of childhood tells me that a far deeper feeling is excited when the tender mother selects a different flower, and places upon the back of her child the modest lady's slipper." Immediately after this affecting little incident, my boy, Samyule led his men to their duty, and they marched into one end of the defile as soldiers, to pass out of the other as spirits.   o Along the front, "Forward!" was the word, and the Conic Section swept to theiassault, like a sea of bayonets dashed against a shore of adamantine rock from the hollow- of an Almighty hand. Were it possible, my boy, for bul- lets to ascend perpendicularly until they just reached the top of mountain breastworks, and then slant down at an acute angle to where the foe lay hidden, it is possible that the frequent volleys from the Conic Section might have pro- duced some carnage; but as the face of the hill before our troops was straight up and down, with the noisy Confeder- acies on the extreme summit, the Mackerel musketry sim- ply occasioned a rise in Federal lead, without a fall in Confederate leaders.                         &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7327-00000033"/> "      OR PHEUS C.

Some Confederacies in their lofty intrenchments just tipped over a few cannon, so that the balls might roll out upon the mackerels, and, says one of them: "If you mudsills will stay there a little longer, we'll manage it so as to drop the shells on you from our hands, without using the guns at all." Captain Bob Shorty h'eard this jeer, and as he tied his handkerchief over a wound dn his forehead, a sickly smile - illustrated his ghastly face, and says he: ' , We might as well all die here together. The grave, :i after all, is a softer bed than many of these Mackerel beings have been accustomed to." Sergeant O'Pake who always takes things literally, turned to Bob, and, says he:               : "What makes it soft?"            -    i X "Because," says Captain Bob Shorty, looking vacantly at the sergeant, "it is a bed of down. Did you never hear the old song of ' Down among the Dead Men? '" But let me not linger over the scene, my boy. That night, the remaining Mackerels silently recrossed Duck Lake, and the General penned the following     X DESPATCH.             ; "I have withdrawn the Brigade across Duck Lake. The position of the Confederacies is impregnable. It was a Military Necessity to attack the enemy or retire. I have done both. WOBE;RT WOBINBON."  Just as the spectacled veterans gained this side of Duck Lake again, my boy, the Mackerel Chaplain was accosted by a Republican chap from Boston, and says he: "This   i -   - W   THRD SERIES.         65 really looks like action at last my friend. Our troops are evidently all enthuasiasm to be led once more against the foe." The Chaplain shaded his eyes with his hand, to look at the speaker, and says he: 4"They are indeed enthusiastic, my friend. So enthusi- astic, in fact, that at least half of them would not come back to this side at all." "Ah I " says the Republican chap; "'the noble fellows." "Yes," says the Chaplain, as softly as though he were speaking in a sick-room; " they remain there sleeping upon their arms. And, oh, my friend, they will never come back again." * He spoke truly, my boy: and may a kind Heaven see haught in the blood welling from their loyal hearts but the blush of a soldier's honor; the glow of a patriot fire in which all their human errors went up to God as the smoke of a glorious sacrifice. They sleep their last sleep upon the arms of their Country; and whether those arms, with which she folds-them into her heart, be white with the er- mine of winter, or green with the drapery of summer, the clasp shall be none the 'less strong with all a Mother's im- mortality of love.

I HAVE been very ill, my boy - I have 'been very ill; and even now, the hand which grasps the pen trembles with weakness, like the hand of the wind upon a slender' rush. I have been reminded of my latter end, and of our Excellent National Democratic Organization, by an out- rage upon- my Constitution and the Arbitrary Arrest of my health,--proceedings which seem to prove- that the well-known Southern Confederacy is entirely right in this war, and that the North is chiefly composed of Honest Old despots. (See proceedings of Democratic Organiza-  tion, Resolution 290.) As I lay sick in Strategy Hall the other day, so deso- X lately lonely that I almost wished to die, and without energy enough to finish reading the greenback I had commenced that morning, there came to see me an affable Democratic chap who had just recovered from a severe bilious attack brought on by the Conscription Bill, and wished to consult me as to the propriety of nominating Dr. Brandreth for President of-the United States in 1865. (66)   THRD SERIES.         67 "Why, my future Jefferson," says I, feebly, "what are you going to do with McClellan, then?" "Really," says he, just stepping across the ward to spit on a copy of the Tribune, which served as a window- curtain, "really, I forgot all about that manly form. Oh!" says the pleasant Democratic chap, replacing the Constitution in his hat, from which it had just fallen, - "Oh! what heroism do we find embodied in that youthful shape! The voice of a assembled universe asks: 4 Shall G. B. McClellan go unrewarded? ' There is no echo at the time. It asks again: ' Who, then, shall be President of the United States in 1865?' And echo triumphantly answers, General George Barnum McClellan!" Here the affable Democratic chap took off his spec- tacles, my boy, and beamed undisguisedly at a small black bottle on the table. "But," says I, softly, " his name is not George Bar- num McClellan at all. His middle name is not Barnum." "Hem!" says the Democratic chap, with a -severe aspect, "I don't know that it is. Really," says the Dem- ocratic chap, hastily picking up his umbrella and moving away, s" really, I don't know that it is." Mistakes, my boy, will happen in the best-regulated organizations; and, if we construe them maliciously, we de- serve, like a parcel of scandal-mongering old Bohea-mians, io be confined all our lives to small, coups of Phineas T. It was during my illness that the adoring citizens of  Mugville discovered that the Venerable Gammon had been defeated ten times in the election for County Clerk in his youth, and frantically instigated an overflowing ovation therefore to that venerable man.

KERR PAPERS. boy, what this aged and shirt-collared picture of perpetual beneficence had done to be such an idol. I cannot con- ceive why repeated defeats in his youth should entitle him to the adoration- of a fond populace at the present'-ex-  citing period; but the leading citizens presented him with a silver butter-knife and a serenade, my boy; and he made a benignant speech to show that he and Providence desired only the applause of their own consciences. "My children," says the Venerable Gammon, waving benefactions in his fat and heartfelt manner, "I accept this butter-knife, - not for my own merits, but because it symbolizes the only true means of restoring that Union of which I am a part. This knife," says the Venerable Gammon, eying the costly gift with oily and benignant satisfaction,-" this knife teaches us that only fiendish Abolitionism would think of using the Sword of Radical- ism to conquer the erring Confederacy which is still our sister, when the Butter-knife of Conservatisin was to be had."  Then all the leading citizens of Mugville observed joy- fully to each other that the country was redeemed at last, and four-and-twenty reliable morning journals published six columns each about the triumphant progress of the Venerable Gammon in the affections of the people. Among those present at this sublime ovation was an aged chap selling apples, who immediately burst into tears 'when the voice of the venerable man fell upon his ears. On being asked to explain his emotions, he cast his dim eyes upward toward an American flag which was being used by' a merchant near by to advertise some patent pills, and says he, brokenly:   THRD SERIES.         69 "When I hear that woice, and see that flag, all my manhood crumbles into scalding tears." He was an apple-seller offine feelings, and had once served as a deserter in the Army of the Potomac. Pathetic little incidents like these, my;, boy, humble though they may be, are pregnant with a deep and touch- ing meaning, of which I have not the remotest con- ception. There is a new Mackerel Hotel recently erected on the borders of Duck Lake, near Strategy Hall, for the benefit of Brigadiers who have not been accustomed to doing without a bar; and it was in one of the rooms thereof that the Conservative Kentucky Chap recently fell a vic- tim to the most remarkable optical illusion of this dis- tracted century. He was sitting with his back to a win- dow, my boy, his head drooped upon his breast beneath the weight of the Emancipation Proclamation, and, with arms folded and legs screwed awry on his chair, he was contemplating the opposite wall from under his Conserv- ative hat.    ^ "Hum," says -he, with subdued ecstasy, "How sweet it is to look upon the map of my native land, of which Kentucky is the guiding star I As I look upon that sim- ple map," says the conservative Chap, thoughtfully, "and reflect upon the recent improvements in Kentucky, it becomes a question in my mind whether Kentucky is the United States, or the United States is Kentucky." Following the direction of his eyes as he said this, I beheld upon the wall opposite where he was sitting:  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7327-00000036"/> 70      ORPHEUS C.

He moved as I spoke, and then,for the first timne, dis- covered his illusion.  ", Hum!" says he, "it is a map of the Union in the as sense that the Union is but a shadow of its former self." ,i The Conservative Kentucky Chap is actually so insuf- ferably egotistical, my boy, and so imbued with the idea that Kentucky is the whole country, that it is almost im- possible for him to sit on a chair without throwing his body into almost the exact shape of the American Conti- nent.

The Mackerel Brigade grows hoary with antiquity, and the capture of the Southern Confederacy is still delayed for the-ant of pontoons. And this reminds me that the Abolitionists of New England, who are entirely respon- sible for this war, with its taxes upon members of the Democratic Organization, have not yet sent any pontoons to the field. Whilst they would abridge the rights of white men, they even ignore white men's rights to a bridge. But let us not linger over such depravity, or we shall be delayed in our preparations for the Presidential canvass in 1865. The last new -General of the Mackerel Brigade is an officer of great age, named Cox, - known to the soldiery as the Grim Old Fighting Cox, - and I am happy to say, my boy, that he is an officer of great ability. Spurning all that vain pomp which too often makes our generals as clean in appearance as the military minions of the despot- ic powers of Europe, he makes it a practice to attire him- self like the unostentatious dustman of a true Republic; and when he rides abroad to inspect the regiments, it is universally admitted that he is like a father visiting his children, whose great numbers make such demands upon his means that he can't afford to dress himself respectably. Having assumed command of the Mackerel Brigade, the Grim Old Fighting Cox immediately summoned all his officers to his presence, and, having engaged each in single combat and defeated him, he proceeded to show his great ability. He beckoned to Captain Villiam Brown, who was at that moment taking the sun's altitude with his can- 4  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7327-00000037"/> 72      ORPHEUS C.

Villiam smiled affably, and says he: "I don't remem- ber just how many that *Republican institution will hold." t"Release them ALL!" thundered the Grim Old Fight- i ing Cox, violently rattling his sword, and firing a pistol in -m the air.                       / V "( Ah!" says Villiam, "here's Ability." , The next officer called was Captain Bob Shorty, and X says the General to him: "How many slow-matches did X my predecessor order for the Orange County Howitzers?" ;9 Captain Bob Shorty took three steps in a break-down, ?  and says he: "We have always ordered seventy-five."

KENTUCKY, my boy, has considered herself a general boon to mankind ever since she was discovered by Colonel Boone; but there are different kinds of boons known to mankind, and if -I should chance to mention the baboon as amongst the noisiest and least respectable of the species, my remark may not be regarded as entirely desti- tute of a personal bearing. It was in the honeyed accents of admiring friendship that I conveyed this chaste zoilog- ical idea to the Conservative Kentucky chap on Monday last, as we took Richmond together at Willard's bar, and I regret to say that he made it casus belli, Accidentally dropping his bowie-knife on the floor, and hastily replacing his ruffles over the handle, of his pocket revolver, he pol- ished the blade of his dirk with a blood-colored silk hand- kerchief, and says he: "Kentucky fought for Washington in the Revolution; she has, thus far, prosecuted the present war without fear; nor will shed shrink from even shedding personal gore where the provocation is the offspring of Yankee low- ness."

He said this, with exceeding majesty, my boy, and I felt that I was indeed involved in complications with the Bor- der States. "I understand you, my warrior," says I, calmly; '" but if this affair is to come off immediately, where are we to find our seconds?"                   . The Kentucky chap hastily called a small boy to him, I! and says he:  P"Sonny, just run out into the street and ask any two gentlemen you meet to step in here for a moment.") "You see," says he, turning to me,% it's better to have two brigadier-generals for seconds, as a battle might take place while we are away, and there are no private soldiers to spare at present." ".Yes," says I, thoughtfully, " that's very true." The brigadiers were obtained, my boy; and, with mur- der in our hearts, we started forth to seek a spot appropri- ate for carnage in private. It was just the hour of mid- day, and we were wending our sanguinary way in silence, when, upon turning a comer of one of the public build- ings, the sound of sweet music fell upon our ears, and we came suddenly upon a brass band and a party of singers, who were discoursing witching strains under one of the windows.  I listened for a moment, and then, says I: t"What may be the occasion for this noonday melody?" The Conservative Kentucky chap motioned for us to pause, and says he, feelingly: "It's a serenade to Secre- tary Welles of the Navy. Let us heed the voice of the singer." Here a young vocal chap, under the window, commenced singing the following words, in a fine tenor manner:   THRD SERIES.          75  SERENADE. "O lady, in thy waking glance There lurked a wondrous spell, To hold young Cupid in thine eye As in a prison cell. "And now, the god of Slumber finds Thy drooping lids so fair, He makes of them his chosen couch And dwells forever there." As the last note of the singer fainted into the eternity of lost sounds, I looked at the Conservative Kentucky chap, my boy, and beheld that his eyes- were suffused with the tears of an exquisite sensibility. "Yes," says he, softly, "-' and dwells forever there.' " Here the Kentucky chap shed another tear to wash out the stain of the last one, and says he, "Mr. Welles is in- deed a lady who offers some attraction to slumber. May he rest in peace! We were all too deeply affected to speak, but proceeded silently to a vacant lot across the river, where accommoda- tions for law-breaking were ample. Everything about us here seemed fraught with the spirit of peace; on each side, and as far as the eye could reach behind and before, were the tents of the Army of the Potomac, growing in the sptots where they were planted years ago. We alone, of all the human beings within sound of our weapons, were about to be breakers of the established war -to shed human blood.

At first, my boy, we had some trouble to keep the brig- adier-generals with us, as it suddenly struck them that they had not drawn their pay for two whole hours, and were frantic to return; but when I suggested, that if they should be missed from their posts, .they would probably X be nominated for major-generalship, they consented to re- main,. When the Conservative Kentucky chap took his posi- tion, I noticed that his countenance was contorted into a horrible expression of severity, and asked him why it 1 was?       -  "Hem!" says he, " this is a solemn moment, young man. We are both about to fly into the face of our Ma- - ker."  Here he pointed his weapon at me; and says he: i "I think you are frightened." "No," says I, making ready. The Kentucky chap's face then assumed the most ter- rifc expression I ever saw, and says he.: "Are you not alarmed at your awful position?" "No," says I.                   ! The Conservative Kentucky chap lowered his pistol, and, motioning for the brigadiers to come from behind their trees, advanced to my side. "Hem!" says he, frowning majestically, "I think I understood you to intimate that you were terrified." "No," says I. Here the Conservative Kentucky chap took me sudden- ly by the arm in a very confidential manner, and, having led me a few paces back, says he, in a horrible whisper: "You find yourself frightened, as it were." "Why, no," says I.   THRD SERIES.        " "Well," says the Conservative Kentucky chap, "I AM." And we all went home together. Since then, my boy, I have weighed and contrasted my own feelings and those of the Conservative Kentucky chap on that occasion, when I won an everlasting repu- tation for bravery; and I am satisfied that the bravery of a man in an affair of honor is a superior capacity for concealing terror. It was toward the middle of the week that I went down to Aecomac to attend a great Union meeting there, and it's my private opinion, my boy, my private opin- ion, that the human tongue is not without its province in this war. But before the meeting commenced, and whilst I was reflecting upon the fact that it was the day on which the Prince of Wales was to be married, a redeemed contraband saluted me, and says he: "Mars'r, I hab been made a free man by Mars'r Lin coln, and hab opened a tRefreshment Saloon on de Euro- pean plan.

ICH DIEN OYSTERS IN EVERY STYE. t There was one thing about this inscription that I did not understand, and says I to a chap near me:  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7327-00000040"/> 78       ORPHEUS C. KERR. PAPERS. "See here, my patriotic friend, what does this mean? What kind of things are Ich Dien Oysters?" "Oh," says he, obligingly, " you do not understand the Hanoverian tongue. ' Ich Dien', is the Prince of Wales' motto, and means ' Iserve.'   The phrase 'Ich Dien Oys- ters in Every Style' means, 'I serve oysters in every style.'" Then it was, my boy, that I saw in Mr. Negg's device  the despised African's testimonial of gratitude to Great   ? Britain for the recent reaction of anti-slavery sentiment   ; there.   A more delicate compliment, my boy, was never offered to the mother country, who has given us all at    X least 290 * reasons for loving her.              i And speaking of redeemed contrabands, reminds me of the new African hymn, which the more pious colored Americans of South Carolina might denominate DE GREAT HALLELUGERUM.

Among the distinguished speakers invited to be present at the great meeting in Accomac, were: the Emperor of Russia, the Emperor of France, the Sultan of Turkey, Queen Victoria, the King of Sweden, the President of the United States, and Theodore Tilton;   but, as the walking was very bad, they did not all come. The cele- brated American patriot, Mr. Phelim   O'Shaughnessy, took the chair in the absence of the President, and said, that as the Emperor of France was unavoidably absent, he would beg leave to introduce Mr. Terence Mulligan, whose ancestors were once Irishmen themselves. Mr. Mulligan was received with prolonged applause, and said, that although he bore an Irish name, he had never been ashamed to associate with Americans.

What we wanted now, was, that the example of our Irish citizens should be imitated by the others, and that the war should be prosecuted with vigor. -(Con- tinued cheering.) Irishmen peed never despair of this glorious Union, which had often been a House of Refuge for them, and could not fall without carrying Ireland with it, - so closely were the two great nations knit together. The Irish would never despair:               :  "For Freedom's struggle once begun, Bequeathed from bleeding sire to son, Though baffled oft, is ever won." When the enthusiam had subsided, the chairman ex- pressed his regret that the Emperor of Russia had not arrived yet; but felt confident that his place could not be better supplied than by Mr. Mickey Flanigan, whose fore- fathers were themselves the fellow-countrymen of Daniel O'Connell. (Great applause.) Mr. Flanigan arose amidst great cheering, and said that it was a time when every Irishman should feel as though the eyes of the whole world were upon him. He had found the natives of this country intelligent, kind, and hospitable; and though they had not taken his adviee as to the management of this war, he firmly believed that no Irishman would disagree with him when he said, that Irish arms and Irish hearts would finally conquer; "For Freedom's battle once begun, Bequeathed by loyal sire to son, Though baffled oft is ever won." *x                     ^^B   THRD SE;RIES. 1        88 As soon as the demonstrations of approval had suffi- ciently subsided, the chairman stated, that, for some un- known reason, Queen Victoria was behind time; yet he could not, for his part, feel sorry for an event which gave him an opportunity to introduce Mr. Figsey Korigan, who represented that element of the world's hidden, free spirit which had thundered in an Emmett and an O'Brien. (Great enthusiasm.) Mr. Korigan acknowledged the glorious welcome he had received, and declared that this was a proud day for Ire- land. Her sons were ever foremost in the ranks of human freedom, shedding their votes for the oppressed of all lands, and fighting all the time. He would say to that Irishman who despaired of this Union, that he was unworthy of any office, and should blush to call himself an American. The speaker's own family had always been Irish, though he himself was born in Cork, and he would be ashamed to stand on that platform if he did not believe that the free- born Irish soul would eventually triumph: "For Freedom's contest once begun, By bleeding sire bequeathed to son, Though baffled oft is ever won." The chairman now arose, amid frantic applause, and said that the meeting was now at an end; but proposed that all the persons present should enroll themselves as members of a Union League for the Prevention of Dis- tress among our Irish Soldiers in the Field. This was responded to with a thundering ' Ay."  He also proposed that each person present should contribute one dollar as a basi of a fund for the purpose. A gentleman hare moved  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7327-00000043"/> 84      ORPHEUS C.

Then all the Accomackians went pleasantly home, my boy, except one seedy chap who had stood patiently before the platform during all the proceedings; and there he still stood, withl his arms folded, when all the rest had gone. He was a somewhat loaferish chap, with some appearance of the philosopher. '% The chairman looked at him, and says he: "' What are you waiting for, my friend?" The chap gave an extra chew to his tobacco, and says "I'm waiting for that ere Great Union meeting to come off.- "Why," says the chairman, ( the meeting is all over." "Yes, I know - that meeting," says the chap, explain- ingly; " but I mean the Great Union meeting." It is astonishing, my boy, how much ignorance there is in this world. Here was a sane human being who had attentively stood all through a meeting in aid of our sacred national cause, and yet did not know that it was a Union meeting. Thursday was the day when I reached the head-quar- ters of the Mackerel Brigade, at the ancient city of Paris, arriving just in time to witness one of those strategic naval exploits which will yet cause the American name to be respected wherever there is nothing particular against it. It appears, that after his last successful experiment with his patent swivel gun, that stanch old sea-dog, Rear Ad- miral Head, devoted much of his time on Duck Lake fish-    THRD SERIES.         85 ing for bass, believing that noble expanse of waters to be free from all obstructions and open to the commerce of the world. The commerce did not come, my boy; but several insidious Confederacies did; and as our glorious old son of Neptune always sat with his back to their side of the lake when fishing, they constructed a pier which extended from the shore to the main deck of the iron-plated Mackerel Squadron, the "Secretary Welles," and had planted seven villanous horse-pistols to command the Admiral's fish- basket and umbrella before our hoary old salt discovered that the war was still going on. "Riddle my turret!" says the grim old Triton, in his iron-plated manner, "I believe a blockade is established; dent my plates if I don't." Heartily did that pride of our Navy call up the culpa- bly inattentive Mackerel crew, who were eating clams in the stern-sheets, and quickly was the gallant "Secretary Welles " withdrawn out of the range of the Confederacies' murderous fire ; her swivel gun raking the atmosphere fore and aft, whilst the fearless old sea-dog sat down upon a reversed pail amidships, and addressed a letter breathing future vengeance to the unseemly Copperheads of the North. "Sink my Monitor!" says he hotly ; " let them beware of the time when the Navy returns to its peaceful home!" But it was on Thursday, my boy, that the Rear Admi- ral was to run the blockade of the Confederacies' pier, and Captain Villiam Brown, Captain Bob Shorty, and myself, stood upon the edge of Duck Lake, with our pieces of smoked glass in our hands, to behold this triumph of con- summate naval strategy   &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7327-00000044"/> 86      ORPHEUS C.

At the hour appointed, we beheld Rear Admiral Head and his Mackerel crew slipping over the stern of the Machk- erel squadron into the water, and immediately the "Secre- tary Welles " commenced to float past the Confederacies' batteries with the tide. Onward she went, despite the plunging fire from the horse-pistols, and, presently, we could see her go safely ashore. Never shall I forget the beauti- ful glow of triumph that overspread the noble countenance of Rear Admiral Head, as he and his crew waded through the water to the place where we stood.  "Unrivet my armor!" says he, in his stern, iron-plated manner; "I call that running a blockade in good style." "Yes," says I, sceptically; " but how are you going to  get the squadron back again?" "Eh?" says he, "what was that question, young man?" "Why," says I, anxiously, " now that the squadron has run the blockade, how are you going to get her back again?" ' By all that's iron-clad," says the grim old sea-dog, violently, 1"I forgot all about that." "Ah I "' says Captain Villiam Brown, pleasantly, " can't you dig a canal?" At this moment' there was a tremendous explosion; something was seen flying through the air, and then the swivel gun of the "Secretary Welles," with the Admiral's fish-basket and umbrella attached, fell beside us on the sand.

CONCERNING INTELLECTUAL GIANTS AND PINS; WITH A FEW WORDS AS TO CERTAIN DRAMATIC STREET-SCENES SUPPOSED TO BE OF DAILY OCCURRENCE; AN AFFECTING WESTERN POEM; AND A BRIEF GLIMPSE OF AN ORDINARY CAVALRY DASH. WASHINGTON, D. C., March 22d, 18C3. GREATNESS of mind, my boy, like greatness of body, consists no less in a capacity for making good'use of small things than in an ability to master vast ones; and the in- tellect sublime enough to grasp the whole system of the universe, may not disdain to draw a useful lesson in hu- man nature even from so minute an object as the Sec- retary of the Interior. The elephant, in the full ampli- tude of his physical greatness,' has been briefly and com- prehensively characterized as an animal able to knock down a giant and pick up a pin; and how shall the glo- rious human mind boast its superiority over matter, if it be not also endowed with the power of stooping as well as soaring? I believe, my boy, in the mind. that picks up pins intellectual; especially in these days, when there are so few intellectual giants to knock down. Indeed, so im- portant to the general system of intellect is the system of taking no less note of small things than of great ones, that a multitude of writers who deal only in the smallest kind of matters all their lives may themselves be denom- inated intellectual pins. I hold Mr. Tupper to be an   THRD SERIES.         89 intellectual pin, and Mr. Willis has also become somewhat of a pin in these his later years. To the youthful soul, still steeped in those romantic dreams, of which a supper of pig's feet is the best artificial provocative I know, this war is a vast phantasmagoria of almighty giants struggling together in the clouds. There was a time when I, too, was able to see it to that extent; but time, and some experience in Virginia, have reduced my giants in the clouds to brigadiers in the mud; and from seeing our national banner in the character of a rainbow dipped in stars, I have come to regard it as an ambitious attempt to represent sunrise in muslin, the un- expected scantiness of the material compelling the in- genious artist to use a section of midnight to fill up. Down in Accomac, the other day, I overheard a sen- timental Mackerel chap, to whom I had imparted this flagging idea, inflicting it upon another Mackerel as original; but he was anxious to improve upon the com- parison, and says he: "Our National Standard is so much like a beautiful sunrise, that I could almost wish the full idea of an eter- nal mornipg could be further expressed in it by something to represent the dew." The inferior Mackerel scratched his head, and says he: "Why, my pay has been due for some time, and I myself am eternally mourning for it." If we cast pearls before swine, my boy, we must not be surprised to find them taken for the seeds of cabbage- heads. I once told a Wall-street broker that I considered the break of day one of Nature's most glorious sights;  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7327-00000046"/> 90      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. and he said that he didn't mind it himself, if he didn't happen to have any of Day's notes on hand at the time. But, to return to the giants and the pins; the absence of all giants in the way of events for the past week has induced me to take note of the pins; 'and close observa- tion of a few of the latter induces me to believe that a strong Union feeling is beginning to be developed amongst the loyal masses of the North. For instance: one of the passengers in one of the street-cars of Paris, the other day, ! was a venerable man of ninety-three years and seven months, who sat quietly between two lady-passengers, eat- : ing roast chestnuts, and permitting the shells to fall upon .! their laps. Upon his hoary locks rested a white hat, well worn and mashed-in with time; his once light overcoat buttoned close to his throat, represented a drawn battle between grease spots and torn places; his venerable lower members were encased in blue overalls, somewhat shaded about the knees; and the large feet, resting easily upon the cushions of the opposite seat of the car, wore one slipper and one disabled boot. With the exception of a scarcely heard hiccup between every two chestnuts that he ate, not a sound was emitted by this venerable and striking figure as he sat there thus unobtrusively in a public car, like any ordinary passenger. Presently, a young and boisterous lieutenant, vain of his new regimentals, and full of the airs of a new Jack- in-office, entered the car, and egotistically attempted to make his way to a seat. A faint hiccup saluted his ear, and, looking down, he found - his way barred by the aged legs of the venerable stranger., whose feet were upon the opposite cushions. *   THRD SERIES.         91 "Let me pass, old man?" says the vain youngster, with the smart air of one who wishes to get to his seat. The venerable stranger hardly raised his stern old eyes at the flippant remark, but ate another chestnut, as though n(, one had spoken. -Come, my friend," says the conceited stripling, -with fresh arrogance, "Be kind enough to move for a moment. I am Colonel P--." In an instant, the aged frame sprang to his feet, opened all the windows, turned the conductor out of the car, locked the doors, mashed his hat down over his eyes, and frantically tearing open his dilapidated overcoat, displayed the star of a major-general! In an instant, the newly-fledged colonel lost all his knowing braggadocio, and cowered before the glorious old veteran, like a cowed cur (female of a bull-dog). "Wr-r-r-etch " exclaimed the hoary commander, in tones of thunder, relieved with the vivid lightning of a hiccup, "Do you know me!" The abashed young boaster could only bow his head in shame, and took the first opportunity to dash himself from the vehicle wherein he had been taught such a les- son. And this should teach us all, my boy, that bad clothes are not always It sure sign of the wearer being only a reporter for the Tribune; nor do the ordinary symp- toms of intoxication always indicate that the possessor lacks high rank in our national army.             . Some hours later, on this same car, there transpired a somewhat different scene, but one equally calculated to prove that there is indeed a North. Twenty-three  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7327-00000047"/> 92      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. wealthy secessionists were in the swift vehicle, the only other passenger being a handsome lad of about sixteen, in the uniform of a brigadier. Rendered confident by their numbers, the enemies of our beneficent form of govern- ment entered into a venomous discussion of the siege of Vicksburg, assserting that the Yazoo Expedition had not yet captured forty-two steamboats of Confederacies, and that the announcement of the capture of the Mississippi River was premature. The young soldier of the Republic went on with some candy he was eating, an apparently indifferent spectator of this symposium of treason ; but the close spectator could not have failed to observe that his whole form was in- visibly convulsed with a patriotic indignation. Presently, however, when one of the more hideous conspirators heart- lessly remarked that we had not heard much of our army in Virginia lately, endurance ceas to be a virtue, and the young hero could no longer restrain 'himself. In a moment his whole aspect changed; his eyes burst into a devouring blaze, and his cheeks were in flames before aught could be done to check the conflagration. Animated by the strength of a giant, in a cause which he believed to be a noble one, he shot the traitors one by one with his revolver, and buried them in an obscure swamp near the track; he paid the driver and conductor their wages, and induced them to enlist for three years; then, after selling both the horses at auction, he broke the car into kindling-wood for the use of the poor. And this mere boy, who could make himself equal to an emergency,-what of him?

Will they sometimes give one idle thought to the unpretending litUrateur who has found the glorious reward of literary merit to be an assumption by one-horse country newspapers of the right to talk about him by his family name without troubling themselves to put in the civilized courtesy of "Mr."? Will they mention in their less urgent prayer, occasionally, the modest child of the quill, who would exceed all the horrors of the Inquisition with the foes of his country, by actually forcing them to write a column for a newspaper when'they felt men- tally incapable of penning a single coherent paragraph?

But let me not indulge in sentiment, my boy, while it is still before me to describe the recent successful recon- noissance of the Anatomical Cavalry, whose horses remind me of the celebrated war-horse described by Job, inas- much as it is believed that the far-famed patience of that ,scriptural patriarch would have stood a very poor chance with them. The Grim Old Fighting Cox, the new General of the Mackerel Brigade, having learned from the New York daily papers, of the week previous, that a few hundred thousand freshy-drafted Confederacies were massing them- selvds on his right, resolved to order a triumphant recon- noissance by the Anatomical Cavalry and the Orange County Howitzers, for the purpose of discovering whether the war was actually going on yet. As the steeds of the cavalry were widely dispersed through the various gravel meadows around the Mackerel camp, my boy, and had grown somewhat wild from long disuse, I was somewhat puzzled to know how they could all be caught quickly enough, and says I to Captain Villiam Brown, who was to command the combined expedition: "Tell me, my Pylades, how will you manage to organ-  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7327-00000050"/> 98      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS.         ! ize the equestrian bone-works without losing too many hours?"  "Ah!" says Villiam, briskly replacing the cork in his canteen, and startling his geometrical steed, Euclid, from a soft doze, " we must make use of our knowledge of nat- ural history, which is the animal kingdom. Observe the device used in such cases by the scientific United States of America." I looked, my boy, and beheld a select company of joy- ous Mackerels hoisting a huge board to the top of a lofty pole, which must have been visible for a mile distant. The board simply bore, in large letters, the simple words: "'THE OATS HAVE COME." and scarcely had it reached the top of the pole, when the anatomical steeds came pouring into the camp with frantic speed, and from every direction. i"Ah! ' says Villiam, thoughtfully, " how powerful is instink, even in a dumb animal. I once had a dog," says Villiam, reflectively, " whose instink was so powerful, that to stop his vocal barking it was only necessary to show him a good-sized piece of bark. He felt," says Villiam, explainingly, i" that it was a larger bark than 'his, and it made him silent." Truly, my boy, there' is often a marvellous similarity between instinct and reason, the former serving as the foundation of the latter, and not unfrequently being en- tirely destitute of a superstructure in military men. The Cavalry and Howitzers having been arranged in such order that each supported the other, and a prospect of some carnage supported them both, the word was given   THRD SERIES.          99  to advance, and the warlike pageant swept onward very much as we read in the reliable morning journals. I was proceeding at the head of the cavalcade, with Villiam, pleasantly discussing with hit the propriety of digging a canal to Richmond, and using the Cavalry on the tow- path, when there rode forth from the cover of a wood near at hand a horseman, whose stately bearing and di- shevelled hat announced Captain Munchausen, of the cele- brated Southern Confederacy.    He waved his sword courteously to Villiam, and says he: "You bring your hordes to measure sabres with us, I presume?"  Villiam rattled his good sword Escalibar * in its scab- bard, and says he, grimly, ' We are met together for that purpose."  Captain Munchausen smiled superciliously, and says he, "Is this intended by your vandals to be what you call a brilliant cavalry dash?" Villiam waved his hand majestically, and says he: "That is the exciting phrase."

Here Captain Samyule Sa-mith, of the Howitzers, who had come up while the talking was going on, suddenly slapped his knee, and says he: "That's so.

SHOWING HOW THE GREAT CITY OF ROME HAS BEEN RUINED BY THE WAR; CITING A NOTABLE INSTANCE OF CONTEMPT OF COURT; DE- SCRIBING REAR ADMRAL HEAD' S WONDERFUL IMPROVEMENT IN SWIVEL GUNS; AND PROVING THAT ALL IS NOW READY FOR THE REDUCTION OF FORT PIANO. WASHINGTON, D. C., March 29th, 1863. Af'Tnt due consideration of the different points of the Compass, and a fair estimate of the claims of each to su- periority, I am inclined to give the preference to the Great North-west. It is to the Great North-west that we are indebted for our best facilities of sunset; some of the greatest hogs of the day come from Cincinnati; the prin- cipal smells of the age belong to Chicago, and the whiskey of Louisville has almost entirely superseded the pump of our forefathers. Hence, my boy, it was with a feeling akinto reverence that I witnessed the arrival in Accomac of a delegation of high moral Democratic chaps from the Great North-west, the other day; their mission being,^to protest against all further continuation of a war which was degenerated into a mere bloodshed for the sake of New England; and to suggest that a convention of all the States be at once held in Kentucky, to arrange a peace that shall be acceptable to the Great North-west. I was asking the thoughtful chairman of the delegation what were his par- 'ticular grievances, and says he: ( 101)  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7327-00000052"/> 102     ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. "This war is ruining much valuable Real Estate in the Great North.-west, of which I and my fellow-beings are proprietors; and cannot continue without proving the entire destruction of some of our largest cities. Just before this war broke out," says the thoughtful chap, impressively, "I gave a three-years' note of seven hundred and sixteen dol- lars and fifteen cents for the city of Rome, situated on the future line of the Atlantic and Pacific Canal, and divided into four hundred water-lots of five fathoms each. As soon as the Atlantic and Pacific Canal was built, the water would have been drawn off by means of eighteen large hydraulic pumps supported by Eastern capital, leaving the lots all ready for building purposes. The main street would then have been graded, and paved with the new pa- tent Connecticut sub-drainage pavement, and would have extended two miles in a perfectly straight line, with a horse-railroad through the centre. The various intersect- ing streets I should have named numerically, commencing with' - First Street,' which faces upon the Atlantic and Pacific Canal, and so going on to ' One Hundred and Seventy-sixth street,' and so on. These streets would have been occupied exclusively by brown-stone-front res- idences, with a flag-staff bearing our national banner on the roof of each one, and rented to small private families without children. The full lots on the main street would have been used for the City Hall, the Lunatic Asylum, the Custom House, the Home for Deranged Persons, the Merchants' Exchange, the Qorn Exchange, the Refuge for the Insane, the Grain Elevator, the Institution for Friend- less Maniacs, the Principal Pork-Packing Establishment, the Hall of Records, the Office of the Superintendent of A, . .'

The sixty-eight principal banks would have discounted bills of exchange at sight, for the benefit of the numerous foreign vessels constantly arriving at the principal pier by way of the Atlantic and Pacific Canal, and the Fire Department would have been limited to twenty-three hundred hose-carriages and engines, with an educated Chief Engineer." Here the thoughtful Dem- ocratic chap gnashed his teeth, and says he: "But the City of Rome has been entirely retarded by this here Black Republican"New England war upon the sunny South, with which the great North-west has no earth- ly quarrel whatsoever." I was pondering a reply to this very reasonable speech, my boy, when word was suddenly brought that one of the Mackerel piclets had just assassinated a young Confed- eracy, who had only fired twice upon his inhuman mur- derer. No sooner did the thoughtful Proprietor of the City of Rome hear this sickening news than he at once formed the other Democratic chaps into a coroner's jury, and has- tily proceeded to hold a high moral inquest upon the body of the lamented deceased. There being no witnesses to examine, and nothing in the pocket-book found upon the body, the proprietor of Rome removed two tears with his red silk handkerchief, and briefly summoned up the case. Kneeling desolately beside the cold remains, and taking one of the lifeless hands within his own, he sniffed feelingly, and says he: "The young man which is here before us is another of them noble souls that have fallen gory sacrifices to the Mulock of War." . . .  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7327-00000053"/> 104     ORPHEUS C. KEBRR PAPERS. "You mean ' Moloch of War, " says a juryman. Whereupon he was commited to custody for contempt" of court. "This young man," continued the Proprietor of Rome, ,' may have had good cause to hate and despise the radical abolition offsprings of New England; but he had no quar- rel with the glorious Democratic party of the Great North-west, which is now blindly fighting for his wooden- nutmeg foes. I will venture to say," says the thoughtful Roman, with great emotion, "that he 'even loved the Great North-west in his heart. Behold how freely he per- mits me to clasp his left hand to my friendly'buzzom, even though he is dead." ';,; Just then there was a sudden silence, my boy, for the right hand of the deceased young Confederacy was ob- served to be slowly rising in the air! Overcome with awe, the jury gazed upon the strange spectacle, like men under a wizard's spell. Slowly, slowly, the hand arose, until nearly above the face of the slain Confederacy; then it descended until it reached the half-averted countenance ,f the dead, and convulsively seized the nose between the thumb and fore-finger. The Proprietor of the City of Rome changed color, and -ays he: "Well - ahem! - it can't be that -" Here he ,ooked more closely at the body, and says he: "I am at a loss to explain this remarkable phenom- ena." A venerable juryman, of much shirt-collar, coughed to attract attention, and says he: "I should take the pres- ent attitude of our departed Confederate brother to be that of a man who smells something obnoxious."   T'lhID SERIES.        105 Here the Proprietor of Rome suddenly dropped the left hand of the deceased Confederacy, and says he: "Why, he must mean to insult the Great North-west." "Yes," says the venerable juryman, "' there can be but one construction of the present offensive attitude of this dead young being." The thoughtful Proprietor of the City of Rome delib- erately took off his spectacles, blew his nose, buttoned his coat up to his chin, and says he: "I have always advo- cated a vigorous prosecution of the war, and believe that full nine-tenths of our gallant troops are Democrats. What's the werdict?" The shirt-collared juryman waved his hand impressive- ly, and says he: "We find the deceased guilty of con- tempt of court in the Last Degree." Then the Democratic chaps from the Great North-west held an enthusiastic mass meeting on the spot, and unanimously resolved that neither Kentucky nor Indiana would resist the Conscription Bill, should it be found un- safe to do so. Believe me, my boy, when I say that the great Demo- cratic party is stanchly loyal at heart, howeVer strangely its head may seem to err at times; and never will it take a side with the enemies of the country, even whilst those enemies make offers to it not only aside but affront. Upon going down to Baris on Friday, I found the well- disciplined and spectacled Mackerel Brigade greatly ex- cited and demoralized by the insidious report that their famous new General, the Grim Old Fighting Cox, had actually washed himself. This injurious rumor, my boy, suggested such humiliating national recollections of those  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7327-00000054"/> 106      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. days of consummate strategy, when a certain egotistical commander indulged in the vanities of soap and hair-oil, that the Brigade were naturally terrified. Finally, how- ever, the absurd story received a decisive quietus, when the Grim Old Fighting Cox was seen riding slowly on his unostentatious steed, the "Pride of the Canal," dressed in the unassuming republican habiliments of a stern and in- flexible coal-heaver. It is needless to say that he had not washed himself. This war is at length beginning in earnest. It is beautiful to see hdw the IGrim Old Fighting Cox is improving the morals of the venerable Mackerels, and winning their affection, confidence, and respect. Coming, unexpectedly, upon a Mackerel, who had just laid aside his uimbrella, and removed his spectacles, in order that he might weep the more freely, he fired a pistol over his head, and says he: "What is the matter, my dear sir?" "Oh!" says the poor Mackerel, sobbing, "I am in sore need of the pay which is due me for two years' faith- ful strategy to the Union, and know not where to get it." The Grim Old Fighting Cox was much affected, and says he, softly: "You must humbly kneel, and beseech Providence for it." The afflicted chap toyed with his spectacles, and says he: "But suppose Providence should refuse?" "Then come to ME!"    thundered the Grim   Old Fighting Cox, with the air of a stern national parent. I could relate hundreds of such significant anecdotes as this, my boy; though when the Grim Old Fighting Cox tells them himself to all the reporters of the reliable morning journals, he invariably desires that they shall go /tI   THRD SERIES.        107 no further; but other great events demand my immediate attention. It was very shortly after the victorious but disastrous blowing up of the Mackerel iron-plated squadron, the "Secretary Welles," on Duck Lake, by the infatuated Confederacies of Pier No. 1,--it was shortly after this event, which I duly recounted at the time, that our un- conquerable old sea-dog, Rear Admiral Head, invented an entirely new iron-clad after the model of a Quaker hat, the turret being of solid iron all through, and so arranged that it could be used to cover the gangway amidships. In fact, my boy, the turret was a movable block of iron, with the swivel-gun mounted on top; so that if the tur- ret happened to be hit, the artillery would not be disabled, and if the artillery was disabled, the turret would still be as good as ever. (Patent applied for.) There was some discussion as to what name should be given to this formi-  dable monster, nearly the whole six-barrelled Indian lan- guage having been almost exhausted by our national navy; but finally it was resolved to call her the "Shockinghad- hat," -an old Choctaw title of much simplicity, signify- ing originally "The Head what errs," but now under- stood as meaning "( The Head waters." There has also been a great improvement in the swivel- gun, my  boy, which has been so reconstructed as to rem- edy the evil of immediate bursting so common  to our heavier ordnance. A  select committee of Mackerels hav- ing been appointed to examine our national ordnance sys- tem, and discover the cause of its inefficiency, stated in their able report that the causes of the frequent bursting of our larger guns are, -  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7327-00000055"/> 108      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. irst. The powder used in propelling the appropriate missile against the enemy. Second. The addition of an incendiary spark to said powder. It was further stated in the report, that, although the barrel of a gun was frequently fractured when it exploded, there was no record of the touch-hole ever having - burst; and the committee believed that this curious fact should serve as a valuable suggestion to the manufacturers of future heavy ordnance. Acting upon this truly valuable suggestion, our stern old Son of Neptune caused his swivel-gun to be recon- structed upon a novel principle; the touch-hole was ex- tended to the usual size of a barrel, and the barrel was re- duced td the usual size of a touch-hole; so that, although the terrible weapon looked precisely the same as ever, it was, in reality, completely reversed! But while the t"Shockinghadhat " was being built, and receiving her terrific new armament, the shameless Con- federacies on their Pier in Duck Lake had been industri- ously building Fort Piano and mounting it with their vil- lanous horse-pistols; so that when the new Mackerel iron-plated squadron was ready for carnage and fishing, there was a hostile projection in the way. "Chip my turret! 1 says Rear Admiral Head, in his iron-plated manner, ," I think I shall have to blow a few more Rebels into eternity--smash my casemate! if I don't."- I stood upon the shore of Duck Lake, with a bit of smoked glass to my eye as usual, when our new monster of the deep came abreast of Fort Piano, and Rear Ad- e    THRD SERIES.        109 miral Head commenced to reconnoitre through his pocket- microscope. The venerable commander gazed steadfastly through it for a moment, and then, says he: "Crack my plates! if I don't perceive an insect on the wall of the hostile work." There was indeed a solitary Confederacy seated upon the front wall of Fort Piano, dining sumptuously upon some fresh hoe-cake, and says he: "You can't pass here without a New Jersey ferry- ticket." (New Jersey, my boy, is now a Southern Confederacy, or a Peace of one.) I could hear the glorious old naval hero say, in a sup- pressed voice, to the intelligent Mackerel crew on top of the turret-: "Depress your weapon four points to windward, grease the ball, and fire at his stomach."^  In another instant, the whole landscape shook with a tremendous explosion, jarring the Admiral so greatly that his spectacles fell off, and causing his blue cotton umbrella to tremble like a leaf. The ball ascended to the zenith in a parabolical curve, and was lost amongst the other planets. I do not think, my boy, that the Confederacy would have been offended at this, had not the sudden noise caused him to jump in such a manner that he dropped his hoe-cake into the dirt. Upon this occurrence, however, he sprang to his legs on the wall, drew up a long pole from behind him, disrespectfully cracked our glorious old Rear Ad- miral over the head with it, and then commenced shoving at the turret of the "Shockinghadhat." Perceiving the great danger of the squadron, and un-  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7327-00000056"/> "O     ORPHEUS C.

What's the use of push- ing my turret overboard?" He said this so mildly that the Confederacy burst into a ,prodigious horse-laugh, and drew in his pole again. "As no possible good could be attained by taking Fort Piano, the indomitable old Rear Admiral at once re- turned with the squadron to his original anchorage; hav- ing gained all that was required, and proved his iron-clad monster to be fully qualified for actual service. - Every- thing is now ready for the anticipated conquest of Duck Lake."- I give you the above in quotation marks, my boy, be- cause it is the official report as it appears in all the reliable morning journals, and clearly and satisfactorily explains everything.

FULE POEM OF THE HEART BY ONE OF THE INTELLECTUAL FEMALES OP AMERICA; AND REPORTING THE SIGNAL DISCOMFITURE OF MR. P. GREENE.    I WASHINGTON, D. C., April 5th, 1863. WOMAN'S heart, my boy, in its days of youthful imma- turity and vegetable development, may be felicitously likened unto a delicate cabbage, with an invisible worm      i feeding upon its sensitive petals. To the eye of the ordi-   ' nary and unfeeling observer, the cabbage is in perfect health, and its intense greenness is thoughtlessly accepted    l as a sure indication of an unravaged system. Man, proud man, with all his boasted human wisdom, would smile in- credulously, if told that the tender vegetable - the mag- nified and nervous white rose, as it were -had beneath all its seeming verdancy, an insatiable and remorseless worm gnawing at its hidden core. Man, I say, would thus wallow in his miserable ignorance, and persist in his disgusting blind- ness. But mark that dainty little figure coming up the gar den-walk, my boy. It does not walk erect, like boastful Man, does not spit tobacco-juice like haughty Man; and as it approaches nearer, we perceive that it is a hot-house Pig. Ay, my lord: I say to you, in all your glory of human understanding and trifling degree of snobbishness, it is a Pig.

Only a Pig! 0-0-ONLY a Pig! And why should we say " only " a Pig; as though a Pig were so very inferior to proud Man? We all accord to the awful and unfathomable German Mind a preternatural gift of philosophy, so far above the contemptibly-limited thing we call Ihuman understanding that no man can ever understand a word of it; and how does that German Mind express itself when it desires to de- scribe the Vast, the Extensive, and the Somewhat Large? Why, it simply observes "Das is von -PIxG' thing." And Is not this unaffected remark sufficient, my boy, to raise the wrongfully despised Pig to thei dignity of an adjective, at least? But look once more at the hot-house Pig in question, as he stoops thoughtfully to the1 cabbage which derisive Man has esteemed perfectly sound. He pushes it once with his nose; he raises his eyes, blinking in the glorious , sunshine; his tail vibrates a moment; a solemn wink, - a grunt of deep reflection,- and he turns to another cab- bage!      Yes'! this despised little roasting-pig, this unconsidered  Flower, as it were, has surpassed all the vaunted wisdom  of'stuck-up Man, and discovered the worm at the core of    the sensitive cabbage!     Woman's heart, my boy, in its days of youthful imma-   turity and vegetable development, is a metaphorical Cab-   bage with a figurative worm at its palpitating core. That worm is a passionate yearning for TRUE SYMPATHY . Heartless but wealthy Man comes along, and says: "This Cabbage is in perfect health; and I will Husband it." - He does Husband it my boy, and what is the consequence? Not knowing anything about the existence of the worm, ,n   THRD SERIES,         13 he cannot, of course, fiurnish that TRUE SYMPATHY which is necessary to end its horrible gnawings; and so the worm keeps feeding until the Cabbage HIeart becomes a mere shell, when the least zephyr will break it. How different the result had that Heart been -or, that is to say, how changed would the case have been- had she---or, in other words, what an opposite spectacle might we-or, rather she  - if he - if she- Really, my boy, I am all in a cold perspiration; for I find that I must have made some dreadful mistake in my argument.

This conclusion would be very insulting to the women of America, and there certainly must be some mistake about it. What led me into this philosophical vein of analytical thought was a touching poem of the home affections, which was sent to me for perusal on Monday by one of the intellectual Young Women of America. It is one of those revelations of Woman's inner-self which move us to tearful compassionfor a sex doomed to be the victim of man's selfishness and its Own  too-great sensibilities.

The Grim Old Fighting Cox,- my boy, has rashy determined, that the unfavorable weather shall not detain our national troops another single year, and there is at last a prospect that our grandchildren may read a full and authentic report of the capture of Richmond in the reliable morning journals of their time. And here let me say to the grandchild Or- pheus : "Be sure, my boy, that you do not permit your pardonable exultation at the triumph of your country's arms, to make you too severe upon the conquered foes of the Republic." I put in this little piece of advice to pos- terity, my boy, because I desire to have posterity mag- nanimous. I was conversing affably with a few official Mackerels about several mutual friends of ours, who had been born, were married, and had expired of decrepitude during the celebrated national sieges of Vicksburg and Charleston, when a civilian chap named Mr. P. Greene came into camp from New York, with the intention of proceeding immediately to the ruins of Richmond. He was a chap of much spreading dignity, my boy, with a carpet-bag, an umbrella, and- a walking-cane. "Having read," says he, " in all the excellent morning journals, that Richmond is being hastily evacuated by the starving Confederacy, I have determined to precede the military in that direction. Possibly," says he, impress- ively, "I may be able to find a suitable place in the desert- ed city for the residence of my family during the summer." 3.   THRD SERIES.         " Captain Villiam Brown listened attentively, and says "Is your intelligence official, or founded on fact?" The civilian chap drew himself up with much dignity, and says he: " find it in all the morning journals." Certainly this was conclusive, my boy; and yet our supine military men were willing to let this unadorned civilian chap be the first to enter the evacuated capital of the stricken Confederacy. Facing toward that ill-fated place, he moved off, his carpet-bag in his left hand, his umbrella in his right, and his cane under one arm, a perfect impersonation of the spirit of American Progress. By slow and dignified degrees he grew smaller in the distance, until finally he was out of sight.. It was some six hours after this, my boy, that we were conversing as before, when there suddenly appeared, coming toward us from the direction of the capital of the Confederacy, the figure of a man running. Rapidly it drew nearer, when I discovered it to be Mr. P. Greene, in a   horrible condition of dishevelment, his umbrella, cane, and carpet-bag gone, his hair standing on end, his coat-tails projective in the breeze, arid his lower limbs making the best time  on record. Onward he came, like the wind, and before we could stop him, he had gone by us, dashed frantically through the camp, and was tearing along like mad toward Washington.

The Venerable Gammon placidly placed his beneficent right hand between his patriarchal ruffles, and says he: "My friends, this war is like a great struggle between 6      (119)  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7327-00000061"/> 120      ORPHEUS C.

But what has particularly .endeared the Venerable Gammon to the hearts of his distracted fellow-countrymen is, his able report of the manner in which the war has conducted itself since the First of April, 1862. I cannot exactly understand my boy, how this benignant benefactor bf his species comes to'know anything at all about military matters; nor am I prepared to state that he had any call whatever to report upon national strategy; but he has issued a startling statement, and I give the whole REPORT. "On the first of April, 1862, on the day immediately succeeding the 31st of May in the same year, a solitary horseman might have been seen approaching the camp of the Mackerel Brigade from  Washington. He was a youth in the prime of life, and carried a carpet-bag con- taining the daily morning journals of that date. Upon reaching the tent of the General of the Mackerel Brigade, he sought an immediate interview with the latter, and at   THRD SERIES.        121 once revealed to him that it was reported in all the morn- ing journals, that the celebrated Southern Confederacy had evacuated Manassas just two weeks previously, there- by rendering an advance upon that stronghold by our national troops a subject demanding immediate atten- tion. "Upon discovering that this news was indeed contained in the morning journals, the General of the Mackerel Brigade at once ordered a report of our national victory to be conveyed to the Mackerels who had gained it; and having made several promotions for bravery, and tele- graphed to the excellent Democratic Organization in New York that he had rather capture Manassas than be President of the United States in 1865, he ordered an immediate advance upon Manassas. The'advance took. place without confusion or dismay, and on the following morning Captain Villiam Brown electrified the whole nation with the magical words: "'We have met the enemy, and they are hours- ahead of us.' "The backbone of the Rebellion being thus broken, the General of the Mackerel Brigade wrote to the Honest Abe at Washington, as follows: "DEAR SIR, - I have at length successfully surprised the stronghold of Manassas, and consider myself strong enough to continue the war, if you can send me a few more troops.. If you can spare 60,000 under Sergeant O'Pake, and 50,000 under Colonel Wobert Wobinson, from the defence of Washington, I can wait for the other hundred thousand until I push forward again.

On the Fourth of July, the Honest Abe addressed the following note to the General of the Mack- erel Brigade: "' GENERAL, - By your plan of drawing troops away from Washington, the capital would be left with fewer soldiers than it now possesses; and if the capital is weak- ened, it follows very clearly, that it will not be strength- ened. My plan is directly the reverse of your plan, so that your plan is immediately opposite to my plan. Al- low me to ask you the following questions: "' I. If your plan is different from my plan, how can my plan be the same as your plan? "' II. It my plan does not agree with your plan, wherein does your plan assimilate with my plan? "' III. If your plan and my plan are not the same plan, how can my plan and your plan be one plan? "' IV. If my plan, by opposing your plan, shows that my plan is not at all like your plan, how can your plan, by differing from my plan, save Washington according to my plan, which is not your plan?    H. ABE.' "Both plans were adopted, and in the course of the succeeding two months the Mackerel Brigade shot a cou- ple of Confederacies. Shortly after this, it was decided that an advance should be made upon the city of Paris by   X'telKD SERIES.      123 way of Duck Lake, the iron-plated squadron of Rear Ad- mirable Head being detailed from the blockade to take the Mackerels across, as soon as a heavy rain should make the lake too deep for navigation by personal wading. The troops were at the landing at the appointed time, and were about to embark in good order, when it was dis- covered by the negro servant of one of the officers, that they had forgotten to bring any ammunition with them, and that the iron-plated squadron had not arrived. This unfortunate discovery made it necessary for the Mackerel Brigade to fall back thirty-three and a half feet, and the General thus wrote to the Honest Abe at Washington: "DEAR SIR,- The safety of this Army depends en- tirely upon its immediate reienforcement by all the troops at Washington, as my plan is entirely different from your plan, and your plan differs somewhat from my plan. The importance of saving Washington by your plan, is as nothing when compared with the opposite tenor of my plan; which might, after all, be the. saving of Washington by my plan, though my plan does not agree with your plan. I will stay with this army, and die with it, if need be, by my plan. "' THE GENERAL OF THE MACKEREL BRIGADE.'

Colonel Wobert Wobinson is hereby ordered to take command of the Mackerel Brigade. (' ADJUTANT.' "Upon the assumnption of command by General Wob- inson, it was immediately observed that he possessed a great deal of Shape. He crossed Duck Lake on his Shape, and in pursuance of the plan of his predecessor, opened an instant attack upon Paris. Shortly after the attack, the whole Brigade was back across Duck Lake again, and  the new General sent his resignation to Washington.  It was refused, as unnecessary; and the General then devised a plan for startling the whole country, by organizing the Anatomical Cavalry upon an equestrian basis, and making a raid upon some Confederate oats known to be somewhere in the daily journals. The secret of this movement was confided to but three parties, --the Honest Abe, the Southern Confederacy, and the public; but before the move could take place it was divulged and frustrated. The General then sent in his resignation, which was refused as unnecessary. It was subsequent to this that a third great movement was ar- ranged, when a shower came up suddenly, and it had to be abandoned. It was upon this occasion that the Gen- eral sent in his resignation, when it was refused as un-    THRD SERIES.         125 necessary. Simultaneously, as it were, the officer popu- larly known as the Grim Old Fighting Cox, was ap- pointed to .the command, and here-our exciting tale ends for the present. "If the above record of a year of the war presents some discouraging features, it also offers many seeds of hope for the future, inasmuch as it would appear utterly impossible for the future to be less fruitful of national tri- umphs than the past has been. The greatness of our na- tion is sufficiently evidenced by the fact that we are spend- ing two millions of dollars per day; and as soon as the present rebellion shall have been crushed, the final de- feat of the celebrated Southern Confederacy will become a mere question of time, and we shall be prepared to com- mit immediate assault upon combined Europe.

I was thinking over its develop- ments as I wandered listlessly amongst the deserted Mack- erel fortifications this side of Manassas on Thursday, --I was thinking about it, I say, when my attention was attracted by a soldier's grave located in the very midst of the dismantled earthworks.

(If any man objects to that sort of thing, my boy, may he be whipped to death by the aged maidens of the Con- federacy, and utterly perish per flagellatioriem extremam.) And now I feel the Homeric inspiration in all my veins as I dip the impatient quill into the Black Republican ink, and hasten to record the deathless honors recently reaped by the Mackerel Iron-plated Squadronin a deathless attack upon Fort Piano. You may reinember, my boy, that the construction of a pier on Duck Lake by some shameless Confederacies, and the erection on the end thereof of Fort Piano, was first made known to our noble old sea-dog, Rear Admiral Head, whilst he sat on the quarter deck of his original iron-plated squadron fishing for bass, by the accidental knocking of the squadron against the end of the pier. His back being turned at the time, he had not noticed the building of the .terrible fortification ; and when the hor- rible jar of the collision caused him to look that way, he found six villanous horse-pistols so planted by the disre- spectful Confederacies as th exactly command his fish-.!   &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7327-00000066"/> 130     ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. basket and box of bait. You may also remember my boy, how our glorious old Neptune subsequently caused the stanch "Secretary Welles" to run the blockade of the fort, to thoroughly test the invulnerability of the iron-clad principle; and how the result of that test satisfactorily proved the iron-clad principle to be entirely testaceous. Since then, you have heard about the building of the new Mackerel iron-plated squadron, the "Shockinghad- hat," with Rear Admiral Head's newly improved turret and reversed swivel-gun; but you have not yet heard, my boy, anything at all about -the unique manufacture of six additional iron-plated squadrons, to participate with the "I Shockinghadhat " in the recent severe attack on Fort Piano. You have not heard of these six new monsters before, my boy, and respect for the really decent families of the inventors forbids that I should tell you anything descriptive about them now, save their names. It was intended that the name of the first should be something full of significance to perfidious England, and, at the same time, something never used in England. Hence, she was christened the "Aitch." The second was to bear a name signifying the power of bending without breaking; and so she was called after that elastic tree, the "Yew." In the name of the third, the Goverhment wished to pay a complimentary tribute to Rear Admiral Head; and, in honor of his daughter, Emma, the squadron was named the "Em." The fourth iron-plated invulnerable Mackerel monster it was deemed proper to decorate with a name expressive of industry coupled with a pbwer to sting; and so she was called the "Bee."   .      '   There was some discusssion about the proper title for the fifth patent iron-clad, each member of the generous Mackerel Naval Committee saying to the other: "' Why can't she be named after you.?"So, it was at length decided to happily compromise the matter by calling her the "You." By common consent the sixth invincible iron monster was adjudged to be known by the first of General George B. McClellan's initials, and was entitled the t"Gee." Add these new national champions of the deep, my boy, to the "Shockinghadhat," and you will have some idea of the glorious naval pageant prepared to administer whole- some correction to the irreverent Confederacies of Fort Piano and teach the world that-worn-out cooking-stoves can be sold to the sagacious Government of the United States of America for something better than old iron. The "Shockinghadhat" was the flag-ship; and, on the morning of the attack, the hoary Rear Admiral Head re- paired to the top of her turret with his umbrella, fishing- rod, and pocket-microscope, taking with him the Mack- erel crew to work the improved swivel-gun, which was also up there; andc giving orders to another unconquer- able Mackerel to locate himself amidships with a quart measure, for the purpose of measuring the number of bushels of shots striking the turret during the first two seconds of the approaching sea-fight. Ranged along the right shore of Duck Lake, my boy, to witness the battle and flend lustre to the landscape, was a land-force of virtuous Mackerels, under command of the venerable grandmother of Rear Admiral Head; and she was the one whose appearance gave rise to that rumor  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7327-00000067"/> 132     ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS.  amongst the Confederacies in the Fort, that Secretary Welles was reviewing the troops in person. On the opposite shore of the! Lake was a delegation of European chaps, come to behold the engagement; includ- ing Fatti O'Murphy, candidate for the vacant throne of Greece; the Hon. Mr. New Troloppe, of England; and le Marquis Non Puebla, French Minister to Mexico. At the head of the Lake, my boy, I stood myself, with my bit of smoked glass in my hand; and around me were the reporters of all the reliable and excellent morning journals, spitting on their hands, preparatory to writing their exciting descriptions of personal danger. Precisely at noon the Mackerels of' the land force raised their umbrellas, the Mackerel crews got aboard their respective squadrons, and exercises were commenced by the singing of- "My country, 'tis of thee." As the last strain died away, we could hear that grim old sea-dog, Rear Admiral Head, swearing in his iron- plated manner, and then the whole naval pageant swept magnificently to the front of Fort Piano; the "Shocking- badhat" leading, closely followed by the "Aitch," the "Yew," the "Em," the "Bee," the ' You," and the "Gee."  It was a glorious sight, my boy,--a glorious sight, and moved me like the First of May. For the purpose of testing the range and drawing the fire of the unseemly Confederacies' Artillery, Rear Ad- miral Head carefully let down his old white hat into the waves, and suffered it to drift slowly past the north-east face of Fort Piano. We held our breath as we saw the ?   'ljA iRD SERIES. .      133 artful decoy whirl for a moment in an eddy caused by a land-crab, and then drift against the pier, where it stuck. Immediately a hand was seen reaching down after it, the hat was drawn up, and a prodigious horse-laugh arose from the uncomely Confederacies in the Fort. They sup- posed the hat to be Mr. Greely's. "Sink my Keokuk!" roared Rear Admiral Head, in his iron-plated manner,-"I really believe the treasona- able insects have been and stolen my beaver, - obstruct my Ironsides, if I don't!" Scarcely had the words passed his lips, my boy, when a Confederacy en barbette discharged a double-barrelled fowl- ing-piece at the "Aitch " knocking off two of her front covers, breaking several bars of her grates, and piercing her oven in numerous places. Instantly the cry arose of "One of the cooking-stoves is sinking!" which so be- wildered Rear-Admiral Head that he discharged his swivel-gun one point too far to the windward, and im- mediately found his flagship entangled on several strings with which the Confederacies had obstructed the passage. "Disable my Patapsco!" exclaimed the indomitable old Neptune, in his iron-plated manner, "the insects have tied us fast,- bend my turrets if they haven't." At this time, my boy, the concentrated fire of the Fort was terrific, six' horse-pistols being in full play at once, and the Mackerel with the quart measure amidships reporting that the turret of the "Shockinghadhat" had been hit three quarts of times in thirty seconds. Such being the case, and the European delegation hav- ing gone home with a view to shaking off their inclination to fall asleep, the stern old commander ordered a wet blan- &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7327-00000068"/> 134      ORPHEUS C.

Shortly after the conclusion of this terrible artillery duel, and a few minutes subsequent to a touching exchange of congratulations between the unconquerable Rear-Ad- miral and his venerable grandmother, there hastily arrived from Paris an obese middle-aged chap, in black cotton. gloves and a scratch wig, and says he to the Admiral: "Allow me to bless you, Sir, -My name is Hunter, Sir,--for your excellent iron-clad conduct.

T 'TEEMNG WITH CONSUMMATE STRATEGY, AND RELATING AN EXTRAORDI- !;ji   NARY GEOMETBICAL EFFORT OF MLITARY GENIUS. -WASHINGTON, D. C., May 10th, 1863. As it was feared on Sunday last, my boy, that the venerable. Mackerel -Brigade was about to commit a breach of the peace by strategically assaulting the Con- federacies established in the mud between the Mackerel camp  and the ancient City of Paris, I mounted my architectural steed, the Gothic Pegasus, at an early hour in the morning, and perceptibly moved toward the scene of approaching tautology. The emaciated aspect of my architectural steed of the desert was so inviting to the fowls of the air, my boy, that divers disreputable crows circled suddenly around my hat, as my animal progressed with me by miscellaneously scattering his legs around be- neath himself, and at each particular " caw " of the winged ministers of famine, a perceptible shudder passed through the entire framework of the deeply agitated Pe- gasus. Abstractedly waving my umbrella, to inspire the sable birds for loftier flights, I pondered deeply upon .the lesson taught me by the evident emotions of my aged archi- tectural servant; to ride upon whose fluted back may be likened to sitting astride the peaked roof of a small coun- try chapel in the midst of a hard earthquake, and holding  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7327-00000069"/> 136      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. on by the steeple. If this Gothic creation, which is but a horse, thought I, is so agonized by the mere breakfast notes of a few demoralized crows in the atmosphere, how muchd more terrible must be the anguish of the fellow- beings known as Southern Confederacies, who must ever have a dreadful presentiment of being summarily expunged from the human race by any one of our brass- buttoned generals, who happens to board in their neighborhood for a few years. If I pity this architectural servant of mine, thought I, for his anguish at the proxim- ity of crows in the abstract, how much more tender should be my feeling for Southern fellow-beings, who arce contin- ually endangered by the much louder crows emanating from adjacent hostile Major-General roosters. As I pondered thus, my boy, a crow of much plumage and large-sized mien, suddenly alighted upon the pommel of my saddle, as though impatient to breakfast upon some pounds of horseflesh. For an instant Pegasus trembled throughout his works ; he paused suddenly in his peregri- nation, laid back his ears as though in deep thought, twisted his head suddenly about, and bit off the tail of the crow in the abstract! Simple as was the act, it at once relieved me, in my own mind, of all obligations to have a more tender feel- ing for my Southern fellow-beings than is consistent with a proper emotion of hatred against the enemies of my country. After all, we can learn much   more from brutes than' from men; and as Balaam's ass saw  the angel before his master did, so the Angel of Victory is likely to be distinctly obvious to any poor ass in the country, before he 'becomes visible to the sight of our strategic great men.   ll    -   THRD SERIES.        137 (I turn a pretty sharp corner in that' last sentence, my boy; but that is only safe strategy when you find your argument getting ahead of you.) It was high noon when I reached the Mackerel camp, and I found the spectacled veterans hastily preparing to. cross Duck Lake after the manner of aquatic warriors. By some strange fatality, all the pontoons were at hand in time, greatly to the distress of our more venerable troops, who seemed to fear that such unheard-of punc- bj - tuality must be an evil omen. As there were a great many pontoons, and it was not deemed best to waste any of them, two bridges were built instead of one, - it being considered that, inasmuch as it was purposed to surprise the unseemly Confederacies on the other side, two bridges would be just twice as surprising to them as one would be. There was logic in this idea, my boy- much logic and consummate Strategy. Gazing across the expanse of waters, I beheld a couple of regiments of Confederacies playing poker on the bank, and says I to Villiam Brown, who was at that moment returning a small black bottle to his holster: "Tell me, my fearless blue-back, how this can possibly be a surprise, when yonder gray-backs are looking on all the time?" "Ah I " says Villiam, with much loftiness of demeanor; "you are but an ignorant civilian inseck, and know noth- ing about war. The movement," says Villiam, placidly, '" is intended as a surprise to the enemy, upon the princi- ple that any movement whatever of this Army must surprise everybody." I was reflecting seriously upon this unanswerable ex-  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7327-00000070"/> 138      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. planation of profound strategy, my boy, when Captain Bob Shorty came rattling up with a paper in his hand, and says he:  "Attention, Company while I read a document calculated to restrain the licentiousness of a corrupt and vicious press: "GENERAL ORDER. "For the purpose of preventing the transmission of all news not previously published in the morning journals of the so-called Southern Confederacy, it has been determined by the General Commanding to require all correspondents of the press to affix their full names, ages; and addresses to whatever matter they transmit for publication, thus giv- ing to the journals of our time the- double character of newspaper and business-directory. Reporters having vul- gar names, like Jones, Smith, or Stiggins, will be at lib- erty to assume the names borne by the most popular char- acters in the exciting tales furnished by our weekly jour- nals of romance,- such as Lord Mortimer, Claude de Percy, Lester Heartsease. 4"Correspondents who do not comply with this require- ment will not be permitted to assist in surprising the so-called Southern Confederacy. "THE GENERAL OF THE MACKEREL BRIGADE." (Blue Seal.) After we had all duly digested this useful and sagacious General Order, my boy, Captain Samyule Sa-mith was ordered to make a detour of Duck Lake with the Ana- tomical Cavalry, and dig a canal in the rear of the well- known Confederacy; and the Mackerel Brigade, under   the personal supervision of the Grim Old Fighting Cox, commenced to cross the pontoon-bridges in two divisions. The bridge that I was upon, my boy, was at once attacked at the other end by a surprised Confederacy with a large pair of scissors, who malignantly cut that end loose. There was an aged civilian chap, from Albany, of much stomach and a broad-brimmed hat, standing near me; and when he found the bridge beginning to move, he smote his breast, and says he: "6 Where are we drifting to?" "' Be not alarmed, Mr. Weed," says I, pleasantly ; " we shall soon repair the damage." "Hem!" says he, 1"I wish I'd gone over on the other platform at first." He was quite an old man, my boy, slowly sinking into the rising waves of his own fat; and for that reason ap- peared to have a chronic fear of some unexpected sub- mersion. The Mackerel Brigade, in two parts, having reached the opposite shore of Duck Lake in safety, the Grim Old Fighting Cox ordered Captain Villiam Brown and Cap- tain Bob Shorty to take each a regiment of spectacled veterans and cautiously feel the Confederacies' lines, while he led the remainder of the national troops to a small village at hand, which had particularly requested to be immediately destroyed. It was his great strategical plan, my boy, to form his lines in the shape of a triangle, thus inclosing the unmannerly Confederacies between three fires, and winning a great geometrical victory. The Con- federacies being duly surrounded, and the village being set on fire at the apex of the triangle, the Grim Old   &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7327-00000071"/> "O      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. Fighting Cox withdrew to a tent, spread a map of the world upon a camp-stool before him, and proceeded to take topographical observations. Drawing from his sad- dle-bags an instrument of opaque glass, of tubular char- acter, quite large in circumference about half-way up, and then tapering into a neck, or smaller tube, of nearly the same length, he raised it in a semi-horizontal position to a point about one and a half inches above the lower circumference of his chin, until he could look through it at an angle bisecting its greater circumference upon the map below. The light, striking through the body of this instrument, cast a wavy, fluctuating sort of yellowish glare upon that part of the map representing the well- known Southern Confederacy, accompanied- by a species of soft, trickling sound. After an interval of some ten minutes, the operator saw, by this contrivance, just double the number of Confederacies he had to contend with. It only remained, then, for him to divide the number thus ascertained by two, and he knew exactly the num- ber of his foes! You will observe, my boy, that this singularly ingenious device at once revealed to the new General of the Mack- erel Brigade the true strength of his greatest enemy, and inspired him with a strong spirit. It was immediately after this, that the Grim Old Fight- ing Cox issued the following "GENERAL ORDER. ' The manner in which the crossing of Duck Lake has been accomplished proves that this is the finest Army ever seen on the plan-it, and is likely to prove equally   fine on the do-it. I have now got the well-known South- ern Confederacy where I wished to have her, and she, must either ignominiously retreat, or come out of her works, and be annihilated by me on my own ground, which is ground-arms I "(Blue Seal.) "THE GENERAL OF THE MACKEREL BRIGADE." Having let fly this General Order, my boy, the Grim Old Fighting Cox proceeded to complete his surprise of the enemy by leading a bayonet charge from his side of the triangle, and immediately telegraphed to the base of the triangle that the enemies of human freedom were retreating before him. This was truly the case; for the unseemly Confederacies not only retreated before him, but retreated with such impetus of flight upon Captain Villiam Brown at the base of the triangle, that they actually drove him clear out of his place, and proceeded to occupy the base themselves. Thus matters stood at the conclusion of the first day. Early on the second day, the Grim Old Fighting Cox charged again upon some fresh regiments of Confederacies, who retreated with such violence that they completely pressed Captain Bob Shorty from the right line of the tri- angle, and remained in that line themselves. This was the second day's battle. On the following morning, it was discovered that fresh Confederacies had cotme up from Paris. These were at. tacked irresistibly by the whole Mackerel Brigade, and only succeeded in making a stand when they formed, as it were, the left line of the triangle.  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7327-00000072"/> "2      ORPHEUS C.

You will perceive, my boy, that a great piece of geo- metrical strategy had been thus achieved; but it now turned out that the General of the Mackerel Brigade had' made a mistake, and a most serious one. While taking his observations with his ingenious glass instru- ment, he had seen just double the number of triangles (2) that might be formed by certain great strategical evo- lutions, as he had seen just double the number of the Confederacies; but, in his haste, he had neglected to divide the ascertained number of triangles by two, as he should have done; and now he discovered that only one triangle was formed, and that by the unseemly and chuck- ling Confederacies. Such a nice thing is strategy, and so easily is it deranged! Owing to this error, of course nothing more could be done, and on Tuesday evening the Mackerel Brigade re- turned, full of enthusiasm, to their original side of Duck Lake. The affair had been merely a reconnoissance. Last evening, at dusk, I was talking to the. Mackerel Chaplain about this singular strategical affair, and says he: t"God help us The skeleton regiments we have left standing are scarcely more than the skeleton regiments we have left sleeping; and only the sleeping ones can look upward." Let gentle charity, my boy, silence our tongues to the dread mistake that is past; for he who made it lost by it the glorious immortality his meanest soldier slain has won. Yours, gently, ORPHEUS C.

He came to me, and says he: "Learning, sir, that you are qualified to cull from your extensive poetical readings some unique couplet appro- priate for my approaching coat-of-arms, I desire you to furnish me with the same, and present your bill to our Excellent Democratic Organization, of which I am Chief Indian near-In short, a Sachem local.

But my patriotism hurls back the epithet of ' traitor,' and is clearly established by the fact that I had an ancestor in the Revolution. It is my wish," says this plausibly-spoken chap, nodding to a Faro-banker as he happened to pass at that moment, -" it is my wish that the couplet should express, neatly and figuratively as it were, the exact degree of my present patriotism, and its * derivation from my Revolutionary ancestor. Let it rep- resent me clothed in patriotism, as it were." I thought upon his words for a while, my boy, and then says I:  "For such unspeakable patriotism as yours, good Fuel, there can be no finer couplet than this: "'A painted vest Prince Vortiger had on, That from a naked Pict his grandsire won.,"    THRD SERIES.        145 lThe Honorable Fuel turned very crimson in the face with intense gratification, and says he: ." Ha! ha!- ahem! Yes, that's not bad. Ha! ha! very good- you infernal Black Republican you!" He left me, as a cloud might leave the sun with which it had vainly attempted to cut up shines, and I felt for a moment, like one lost in the Wood. With the best in- tentions in the world, I had only succeeded in adding Fuel to the flames of treason. It pleases me to say that Herr Suvchork, one of those eminent foreign strategists of war who have visited our dis- tracted country for the truly benignant purpose of teaching us how we may win battles only recently lost, has hon- ored me with a great metaphysical criticism upon the re- cent reconnoissance and triangular proceeding of the New General of. the Mackerel Brigade against the well-known Southern Confederacies on the other side of Duck Lake. We may all learn a valuable lesson, my boy, from this able critique, which reads thus: - "SOMEDINGS ABOUT ODDERDINGS. "I have notice in der bapers tha; der Genral Fight- ing Cok cross Dook Lake in two parts, the odder day, when he assaulted the Rebel Army von Lee, which was strongly post in entrenchment built especial for dees pur- pose.

To attack sooch Rebel Army in entrenchment built especial for dees purpose, it was necessaire as he should do everydings togedder; keep his troops altogedder, und fight them altogedder. t"I have not known Genral Fighting Cok in Germany, and I knows not as he is as good Genral as Sigel; so I cannot say as he is sooch goot Genral as Sigel und me. But merk auf!-es ist ein hohes wort--he has not so large militaire mind as     A. P. SUVCHORK.'" While you will join with me, my boy, in. acknowl- edging the soundness of this criticism from our able Ger- man critic, I am sure that we must both perceive some- thing like cruelty to animals in the very common practice of giving the exact directions for gaining a victory so soon after the battle has terminated in defeat. It is like telling a patient who has just taken a dose of salts, how he might have cured himself by a course ofpatgs defoie gras. And now let me direct your most intense attention to the Mackerel Camp on this side of Duck Lake, where the spectacled veterans are all repairing their umbrellas for another reconnoissance toward the first point of the com- pass that seems most vulnerable. They are all full of enthusiasm, my boy, over the loss of some of their comrades and arms in the recent triangular geometrical proceedings against the unseemly Confederacy, and unani- mously demand to be led against the enemies of human freedom that presume to show the freedom of human ene- mies.   You may rememnber that, just previous to the' recent crossing of Duck Lake, Captain Samyule Sa-mith was despatched with the Anatomical Cavalry to dig a canal in the immediate rear of the Southern Confederacy, in order that the legions of the enemies of human freedom about to be captured by surprise, might be at once set to hard labor on the tow-path. It was not more than four days after all the fighting was over that Samyule came back with his equestrian warriors, and says the General to him: "Well, boy, is the canal finished?" Samyule scratched his head, and says he: "Not quite, sire; but we have torn up a Confederate railroad." It was this circumstance, my boy, that gave rise to the recent reports of the capture of Richmond, as considerable of the Rebel capital is known to be invested in railroad iron. Shortly after Samyule's return, the Grim Old Fighting Cox took off his coat, rolled up his sleeves, ordered a couple of spies to be executed, and 'discharged the fol- lowing "CONGRATULATORY ORDER.

"In withdrawing from the other side of Duck Lake without delivering a general battle to our adversaries, the Mackerels have proved their renewed diffidence in them- selves, and their fidelity to a high standard of retiring modesty. "In fighting at a disadvantage, instead of at the enemy, we would have' been recreant to our trust in our pon- toons. "Profoundly loyal, and conscious of its strength, the Mackerel Brigade will give or decline battle whenever it considers the weather sufficiently pleasant and the news- papers sufficiently snubbed.

WASHmNGTON, D. C., May 24th, 1864. THE beautiful Spring, my boy, is out in the sunshine once more,- bowing her pretty face over her lap, as though to breathe the odor of the fresh violets lying scat- tered upon her coquettish green apron, but really to hide the blush mantling the cheeks on which the hot breath of enamored young Summer is tempting the roses to- prema- ture birth. What a fine old world this is, after all, if we have plenty of money in our pockets, plenty of health in our systems, and no poor relations! As you stand on the Arlington side of the Potomac, on any one of these fair May days, and look around you in any direction, there is a beauty even about the tracks of war which enables you to comprehend why so many of our brass-buttoned gener- als are fond of staying in one spot so long. Behind you rise Arlington Heights, which are disliked by our excel- lent National Democratic Organization, only because they wear a covering of Lincoln green in summer; before you, and across the Potomac is the Capitol of our distracted country, looking like an ambitious marble-yard on its way out of town; and close beside you is one of our national (150)   THRD SERIES.        151 troops extracting certain wonders of the insect kingdom from a Government biscuit. On Tuesday, I was stand- ing with the Conservative Kentucky chap near Long Bridge, surveying this scene, and Says I, - "6 Behold, my Nestor, how the scars left upon Nature's face by the chariot wheels of War are turning into dim- ples, and all the twinkling curves of a placid smile." "Yes," says he, hastily picking up the Jack of Dia- monds which he had accidentally drawn from his pocket with his handkerchief, --" the scene is somewhat pleasant; but not equal to Kentucky, where there is more rye." Here the Kentucky-chap became so deeply affected that he was compelled to smell a cork which he took from his vest pocket, and says he, - "Kentucky raised a great deal of rye before the break- ing out of this here fatal war with the Southern'Confed- eracy, with whom Kentucky is connected by marriage; she raised it by the bottle; in which form it becomes, as it were, the crowning glory of agriculture. Ah!" says the Conservative Kentucky chap, stirring an invisible beverage with an imaginary spoon, "how softly on my senses steals Kentucky's national anthem, - "' If a body meet a body, Comin' through the rye.' And the Old Rye of Kentucky is famous for its body." The Kentucky chap hiccupped at the bare recollection of the thing, and says he': "But we can no longer say that the bloom is on the rye; for this unnatural war has killed the agriculture of Kentucky and broken many of her bot-. - tles O Kentucky I Kentucky I how thirsty I am!" After this speech, I could no longer profane the glory 7*  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7327-00000077"/> ,%t    152     ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. of God's beautiful picture by talking about it to a chap who could see nothing in a landscape but rye-fields. And yet it is but natural for any Conservative chap to talk thus, after all; for I hiave found it to be a peculiarity of nearly all our fellow-beings, that Old Rye is forever run- ning in their heads. On Wednesday, while I was on my usual weekly visit to the Mackerel camp near Duck Lake, I was called to look upon the body of a poor soldier who had been shot -during the night by a prowling Confederacy. He was a very young chap, my boy, with light, wavy hair, and might have been taken for a mere lad, had there not been more years in the deep lines on his brow than on his beardless chin. There he lay upon his gun, with one hand clenched in the sand, and the other upon the damp red spot on his breast. He looked like a child who had fallen asleep after unkind words from his mother. The Chaplain and a private Mackerel in rags were bending over him, and says I,- "Who was he?" "He went by the name of Nemo," says the Chaplain, sadly; "but no one knows what his real name was. He enlisted only two days ago, and kept himself apart from the other men. I think he was a gentleman." Here the private Mackerel in rags broke in, and says he; "Yes, he was a gentleman. I an't no gentleman, but I know he was, and I can lick any man that says he wasn't! I spoke to him last night when he was relieving guard, and asked him what fire-company he belonged to; and he said, none. I see he looked sick, and wasn't fit'to do duty, and I offered to go out on picket in his place.   It wasn't much to offer; but he squeezed my hand very hard, and said that my life was worth more than his; and that he would go. I asked him what he wanted to come to the war and get killed for; and he said he'd tried to do his best in the world, but everybody was against him, and he'd been disgraced for trying to do an honorable thing, and couldn't stay and face people any more, because all turned away from him. I told him I would lick the man who hurt his feelings, and he only said: * They all do that,' and went away." Here the poor Mackerel in rags shed tears, and says he: "I know he WAs a gentleman." "I see how it is," says the Chaplain, shaking his head; "he was one of those unfortunates whose sensitive natures are a legacy of unhappiness, or madness, to be cancelled only by death. And yet his kindness of heart with this rude soldier proved how much goodness there was in him that-the world had not turned to bitterness." Alas! my boy, what a pity it is that these finer natures are forever coming under the heels of everybody, and getting themselves crushed! They are like fine SRvres vases among stout earthen pipkins, equally ready to split with the cold, or be pulverized by a tilt from their next door neighbors. It is a misfortune for suchl fragile na- tures as these to be in this common-place world at all, my boy, and they cannot do the more useful portion of hu- manity a greater service than by getting themselves out of it as soon as possible. I have known human porcelain vases of this kind so fragile, that they were half-cracked before anything touched them.

KERR PAPERS., court-martialled, in Ohio, for simply advising the intelligent masses to set fire to a few Union hospitals and go hunting after American eagles by the light thereof, - this report, I say, excited amongst the loyal but seditious patriots of storied Accomac an indignation that was anything but speechless. Shades of our Revolutionary sires! was it possible that a citizen of the Republic could no longer speak pieces without being arrested for speaking peace! Ashes of the great! could it be, indeed, true that, even ,where, there were no police, a man's personal liberty was no longer safe! The people of Accomac, my boy, were alarmed for their own liberties, and at once held a public meeting, at which I happened to be present. As all the citizens who were worth $300 each .sent notes to say that they had imperative engagements to pre- pare for the approaching Conscription, and could not come, the meeting was composed entirely of the other citizens, many of whom engaged in single combat on their way thither, for the purpose of making the distance seem shorter. Punctually at seven o'clock, p. M., a gentle- man of much muscle touched off a small field-piece with' such admirable precision as to break all the windows for two blocks around, and then dexterously discharged a two-pound sky-rocket into the third-story bedroom of a venerable maiden lady living across the road. The dem- onstration was received with joyous acclamations by the populace, nearly twelve of whom had already arrived; and a victim of Federal oppression, with a very large stomach, mounted the platform erected for the speakers, and said that he would commence proceedings on this poccasion, by reading a short portion of Washington's Fare-   well Address from the volume of Bancroft which he held in his hand.- (Great applause.) The honorable gentle- man then proceeded to read something; but was inter- rupted by a reporter, who remarked that the speaker must be mistaken about that being Washington's Address, as he had certainly r etd it in the Bible. The honorable gentleman then turned his book over so that he could read the title, and said that he had, indeed, made a slight mistake about the volume. He would defer reading the Address for the present, and begged leave to intro- duce Mr. John Smith, the Hon. Ferdinand De Percy having failed to be present. Mr. Smith said that it was the proudest moment of his life, and he felt it an honor to be there. They had met together to denounce and spit upon an astounding Administration, under whose tyrannical sway no man was allowed to say one word against it. A fellow-cit- izen had been arrested in Ohio upon the miserable charge of advocating peace, when he was really disturbing the peace all he could. How long were such outrages' to be endured? He advised his hearers to strictly honor the laws; but he would also have them go tfome, organ- ize into regiments, purchase artillery, procure iron-clads, and destroy every man who dared to speak in favor of an Administration under which the boldest man dared not express his sentiments. He would have them do all this peaceably; but he would have them  do it. (Great enthusiasm, and cries of "Keep off my corns, durn ye!")

At this moment, my boy, the speaker suddenly stopped short; stared at a white object which had just appeared- fluttering down the street; and then,. dashing wildly from the platform, tore furiously in the direction of said object, which appeared to be moving, followed sponta- neously and with frantic speed by his fellow-speakers and the entire meeting. I was astounded; I was overwhelmed; for such a sudden breaking-up and pre- cipitate flight of a great indignation meeting was never witnessed before. Quickly mounting the vacant ros- trum, I drew my field-glass from my pocket, and pro- ceeded to scan  the wonderful white object which had produced such an electrical effect. It was moving on, as*I fixed my glass upon it, and I found it to be a new banner, born by a fat young man in a white apron, and bearing the inscription:   that a serious-minded chap, of Republican officiousness, had just waited upon the Honest Abe to ask if he did not intend to cause the arrest of Smith and Jones for their treason. Our Uncle Abe smiled feebly, and scratched his head, and says he  "What Smithland Jones, neighbor?" "Why," says the serious-minded chap, earnestly, (" the Smith and Jones of Accomac." "Well, really," says the Honest Abe, pleasantly, " it's curious, now ; but I never heard of them before." Drawing an inference from this little circumstance of Executive conversation, my boy, it strikes me that it would add considerably to the importance of some of our large-sized local revolutionists, if they could overturn the present ignorant Administration, and establish in its place a- Directory.

GAMMON AT A DIPLOMATIC SOIREE. WASHINGTON, D. C., July 3d, 1863. SOCIAL life at our National Capital, my boy, as far as the native element is concerned, has not been rfined by the war; and even at the White House it is scarcely pos- sible to collect an assemblage of persons sufficiently gen- teel by education to speak familiarly of European noble- men of their acquaintance. At the last dinner given by the Secretary of State, there were actually three Western persons of much cheek-bones, who dissented from the very proper idea that Earl Russel's Carlton-house sherry is superior to anything we have in this country; and my disgust intensified to hopeless scorn, when an East- ern chap in a nankeen vest was brazen enough to confess that he could not tell how many pieces the Emperor of the French had in the wash on the last week of Lent. At other social gatherings in Washington I have noticed the same evidences of growing vulgarity; and I greatly fear, my boy, - I greatly fear that a knowledge of Europe will yet be more prevalent amongst Europeans than Amer- icans. O my country, my native land! has it -indeed come to this at last? In thy loftiest social circles shall we no more behold that beautiful flesh-colored being in lavender gloves and dress-coat whose etherealized individ- (158)    THRD SERIES.        159 nality broke rapturously forth in the thrilling words, "When I was in Parialast summer "? Are we no more to palpitate with ecstasy at the tones of that voice which was wont to trill forth in liquid music from a curl-crested fountain of white shoulders, saying: 6"Don't you remem- ber, Mr. Thompsion, how the Guke of Leeds larfed that day, at the Reception, when I told him that we American ladies thought it was vulgar to say ' garters' out loud?" Alas! my boy, our aristocracy is fading away like an abused exotic, and it is not oftener than once in a season that the frequenter of our Republican Court witnesses one incident to make him recognize the polished people he once knew. About two months ago, at an evening party given by Mrs. Senator  , I did witness a social inci- dent, showing that there is still hope for the Republic. An interesting young mother, of not more than sixty-two summers, attired in a babywaist and graduated flounces, was standing near one of the doors of the music-room conversing with me upon the moral character of her dear- est female friend, when her gushing daughter, a nymph not more than six pianos old, came pressing to her side, and whispered behind her fan, - "Mamma cheri, may I donse with young Waddle?" The maternal girl smiled grimly at the fragile suppliant, and asked: "- How much is his celery, ma petite?" "Nine hundred, mamma, in the Third Auditor's." "Then tell him, mon ange, that you are engaged for the next set, and wait until the thousand-dollar clerks come in. You know, mae petite, what the Count Pistachio said to you at Avignon about giving encouragement to anything less than four figures."  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7327-00000081"/> IZ  -   a160     ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERSo I could not avoid overhearing this conversation, my boy, for it was not held in whispers, and I thought to my- self, as I eyed the fashionable pair, "The Republic still lives." It is, however, with the foreign embassies at Washing- ton, that the genuine aristocratic spirit still holds its nor- mal own; and when I lately received an invitation from a certain convivial diplomatist of the Set to be one of a select party of distinguished gentlemen at his residence on a cer- tain evening, I felt that there was still an available balm in Gilead. Arriving in the rooms shortly before ten o'clock, I found seven middle-aged gentlemen in cambric ruffles and scratch-wigs assembled around the wine-table, all pledging the health of the Venerable Gammon, who had come up from Mugville expressly to be present. There was the French Marquis Non Puebla, on a visit to this country to search for traces of one of the lost gravies of Apicius ; Milord Gurgle, who had been deputed to con- vey to New York a pair of Southdown sheep, presented by the Zoological Gardens to Central Park; the Honora- ble Peter Pidger, who had once been to Europe to negotiate the sale of some railroad stock; the Ambassador in person; and three other respectable persons with no names, whose sole duty it was to indorse the Ambassador whenever he said anything about " dat signeeficant commencement of dees war at Bool Run." But the greatest of them all, my boy, was the Venerable Gammon, who smiled fatly as they drank his health, and emptied his own crystal with a soft benignity which seemed to consecrate that brand of liquor forever.    .  "My friends," says the Venerable Gammon, waving an   unctuous hand around the board in a manner to confer blessings on the very nutcrackers, - " my friends, I accept the honor for my country, and not for myself. Your countries bask in the sunshine of a powerful peace, while mine grows weak in despqtjc war. But do not spit upon us, my friends; do not crush us. We will do whatever you want us to do. War," says the Venerable Gammon, beaming thoughtfully at the nearest wine-cooler,-" war may be called the temporary weakness of a young country like ours; and if we learn not to value peace more than war as we grow older, it will only be because weq do not learn to value war less than peace as we advance to riper years." Then all the respectable middle-aged gentlemen nudged each other to notice that; and the Honorable Peter Pidger observed, in'an undertone, to Milord Gurgle, that if the Government was only guided by such wisdom as that, the country might yet hope for favor from Europe. "Ah M " says the Ambassador, reflectively, "I cannot help to recollect dat signeeficant commencement of dees war at Bool Run."-- Whereupon the three middle-aged gentlemen with no names nodded meaningly to each other, and murmured, in pitying chorus: "Ah, yes indeed." As I rode home to my hotel that night, my boy, and reflected upon the polished observations I had listened to, it seemed to me that Europe must indeed be superior to a weak young country like ours, and that Secretary Seward was but showing a proper respect for the dignity of men- archies in yielding gracefully to them whatever they  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7327-00000082"/> 162     ORPHEUS C.

The Sword of '76 would have refused the accolade; but that of '63 is- of a milder temper. On Wednesday, as I strolled lazily along the shore of Awlkyet River, listlessly tossing pebbles into the placid stream, and paying no attention to any visible object save the severed branches of trees and broken fragments of artillery-wheels which occasionally barred my progress, a Mackerel picket suddenly touched me on the shoulder, and says he, in a whisper, - 'C You mustn't be chucking stones into that air water, or you'll woke up the Captain which is asleep." I glanced askance at him from under my vizor, and says I, "What Captain, my trooper?" "Why," says he, " the Captain of the Blockade, over yonder." I looked in the direction indicated by his finger, my boy, and beheld the sloop-of-war Morpheus at anchor near a small inlet leading to the river from the up- country. "Why, my Union champion," says I, wonderingly, "I should like to know at what time the Captain makes it a practice to retire?" "Ah!!" says the Mackerel picket, leaning upon his musket, and looking dreamily over the water, " he's all the time retiring-he's been put upon the ' Retired' list." Here was a man, my boy, an American, like you or me, brought up in a country where education is free to all, and yet he had no clearer idea of the functions of our   Naval Retiring Board than such as happened to be sug- gested to his instinct by what he could see of the national blockade service!  - Yours, amazedly, ORPHEUS C.

INTRODUCING THE GREAT MORAL EXHBITION OF THE "EFFIGYNIA,2 GLANCING AT A FOURTH NEW MACKEREL GENERAL, AND SHOWING HOW THE PRESIDENT'S DRAFT ON ACCOMAC WAS PROTESTED AT SIGHT. WASHINGTON, D. C., July 10th, 1863. As I wax numerous in exciting years, my boy, and ob- serve more and more of the long-headed and strategic manner in which our wealthy but distracted country pros- ecutes the Restoration of the Union, the stronger grows my belief that, inasmuch as the way of the transgressor is hard, the way of the well-doer is inexpressibly " soft." Each day of the present national crisis brings fresh evi- dence of the exceedingly soft character of the policy by which our upright government would turn to nought the wrathful devices of its enemies, and further demonstrates the vast difference existing between everything upright and anything downright. We discomfit the well-known Southern Confederacy, at every turn, my boy, - we dis- comfit it at every turn; but, the trouble is, we keep turn- ing all the time, like a Thomas Cat after his tail, con- stantly believing that we are approaching the end, but never quite reaching it. Fearing lest I should become metaphysical if I pursued this train of thought any farther, - thereby encroaching upon the bottomless province of the Awful and Unfathom.

This city, which is destined td become in time another Waterloo in the sense of offering everything drinkable in lieu of water, presents but very little except bar-rooms in the way of entertainment just now. Hence, my boy, we can properly appreciate the "Effigynia," as it- is classi- cally called, which a thoughtful yellow-vested chap of much breastpin, from  Pequog, has just opened on Penn- sylvania Avenue.  According to advertisement, "this chaste and plastic exhibition consists of wax effigies of the five successive Generals of the Mackerel Brigade, with the peculiar personalities of each one, and the superiority of each over the other, unmistakably stamped on the forms and features of each!"   Being a moral man, my boy, and much addicted -to entertainments which differ from the prevailing drama of the day in obviating the necessity for steadily-blushing, I repaired to the Effigynia the other evening and was much edified by the spectacle presented. Five -mirrors standing at different angles with a wax fig- ure of the first General of the Mackerel Brigade, were made each to reflect said figure; and I could not help feeling, my boy, that the likenesses were correct. I saw before me the counterfeit presentments of the five soldiers who had successively arisen to the highest Mackerel Com- mand, and I found myself wondering how many more  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7327-00000084"/> 166      ORPHEUS C.

It was on Tuesday morning that I ascended majestically to the slanting roof of my Gothic steed, the sagacious Pe- * gasus, and moved perceptibly across Long Bridge once more, toward the camp of the Mackerel Brigade.  It is worthy of note, my boy, that the architectural animal in question has greatly improved of late upon a diet of con- t demned straw hats, and now trots an hour in sixty min- utes with the greatest ease of manner. An occasional cough but adds to the melancholy interest of his funereal cast of countenance; and as his head grows more and more vivid in its resemblance to an infant's coffin, his whole effect deepens in its churchness and sepulchral solemnity. As I neared the national head-quarters, the Mackerel Surgeon-General saluted me, and I observed that he kept his glance dreamily fixed upon the Gothic Pegasus. -- "As I gaze upon that bony fabric," says he, biting a piece of calamus in soft professional abstraction, --" as I gaze upon that fleet skeleton you bestride, I cannot help thinking that.

In such times as these, my boy, there can be no middle ground for a man; he must either be heart and soul with his country's murderous foes, or ready to agree entirely with me in anything I may say or think.  God save the Republic! Upon arriving at a locality, which I refrain from naming, lest I should thereby betray my beloved country or make a mistake in spelling, I found the venerable and spectacled veterans of the thrice-valorous Mackerel Brigade just re- turned from a spirited pursuit of certain regiments of disrep- utable Confederacies who were stealing farms on the out- skirts of Paris. These Confederacies had even penetrated into storied Accomac, and removed everything they found upon the farms there except the mortgages. Hence the demand upon the aged and unconquerable Mackerel Bri- gade for an immediate walk in that direction, and there they had gone by the most circuitous and profoundly strate- gical route afforded by the county maps. General John Smith, the latest edition of Mackerel Commander, gave leadership of his advance guard to Captain Villiam Brown, and immediately five-and-twenty inflamed reporters franti- cally telegraphed to as many excellent and reliable morning journals, that all the thieving Confederacies were about to be bagged, and that all the revolting details would be given in our next issue. It was toward evening, my boy, when Captain Villiam Brown, mounted upon his geometrical steed, Euclid, came riding up to the advanced head-quar- ters of the new general to report results. ; * '  9{  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7327-00000085"/> 168      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. "Well, young man," says the General, with Spartani equanimity, " have we bagged the enemies of human freedom?" Villiam looked up from the demijohn under the table, upon which he had been earnestly gazing, and says he, "No, sire; but the very next thing to bagging them has occurred." "' Relate the tale,"' says the' General, with dignity. "Why," says Villiam, " instead of our bagging them, they have been sacking us." It is a remarkable and beautiful peculiarity of our flexi- ble language, my boy, that its semi-syno-nymical effects permit the transmission of trying intelligence in terms of soothing similarity to those which might have been em- ployed had the news been more felicitous. Thus are we let down eIasily from pride to humiliation, and spared much intervening agony of soul. So the Mackerel Brigade turned their gleaming old spectacles once more in the direction of our National Cap- ital, and are again a characteristic of the landscape enclos- ing Washington. Further consummate strategy is post- poned for a time on account of the weather, which has become villanously hot through the fanatical machinations of the insidious Black Republicans. Thus are Greeley, Beecher, Wendell Phillips, and their deluded followers weakening the military arm of the government and en- deavoring to obtain fat contracts for worthless fans I Methinks I hear you ask, "Has the new general of the Mackerel Brigade made a failure, after all the credit the public have given him for superiority over his prede- cessors?"   THRD SERIES.        169 Far be it from me to judge hastily, but I may be permit- ted to say, my boy, -I may be permitted to say, that men in the military line have this point in common with men in a mercantile business; by obtaining too much on credit at the start, they are very apt to make bad failures, leaving nothing but their lie-abilities for the consolation of those who trusted them. Upon reaching the Mackerel camp, and exchanging fes- tive salutations with Captain Bob Shorty, who was trying to purchase the dressed skin of a handsome copperhead snake from Corporal Veller, of the California Reserve, to use as a sword-belt, - after exchanging salutations, I re- paired to the tent of the chaplain, to witness the marriage of one of the younger Mackerels to a pretty Shenandoah belle. As the happy pair stood before the drum to be made wife and man, I noticed that the bride's rosy cheeks paled like a sunset under the twilight, until the languishing stars of her eyes shone only upon snow. And now, my boy, let me say a few   words respecting the recent attempted draft of Abe L. bodied men in thrice- famous Accomac, and the freedom-loving spirit in which it was met by the Sovereign People.  With a prescient view to being amply prepared for an overwhelming as- sault upon combined Europe, which is shortly to be made by Secretary Seward and the muscular United States of America, our Uncle Abe ordered a draft of Accomacki- ans to be made at once. Hereupon the Accomac "Morn- ing Dog," an excellent daily journal, indulged in a high- minded editorial on the fiendish proclivities of the Gov- ernor of Accomac, and the general wildness of all the Accomackians to be drafted if he would let them.

It was at 10 o'clock A. M., my boy, when the drafting commenced in Accomac, and in half an hour thereafter the Sovereign People, consisting of several gentlemen from Ireland, were asserting the dignity of a free commu- nity in a manner worthy of the sacred cause of Emigra- tion. It is a touching fact, my boy, -a touching and esthetical fact, that the American people are ever so able to find foreign champions to protect their freedom from governmental infringement that they seldom have occa- sion to do any fighting for it themselves. The Sovereign People of Accomac, being fully aroused and slightly inebriated, proceeded to vindicate the majesty of our excellent national Democratic Organization by re- lieving a bloated aristocracy of their watches and loose change, ransacking sundry private residences on account of the great draft of their chimneys, and performing other awe-inspiring acts of rude majesty, equally well calculated to evince a freeborn people's distaste for despotism. Furthermore, the Sovereign People fearlessly attacked a large and aristocratic Hospital, beating many of the pa- tients to death; for, by some corrupt chicanery, these patients were barefacedly exempted from the Conscrip- tion which bore so heavily upon the down-trodden and "   THRD SERIES.

The "' Evening Cat," in a special edi- tion, was genial enough to express a hope that " the out- raged people now muttering ominously in the air," would not burst upon the office and editor of the "Morning Dog " with too much just fury; whereupon the incensed Sover- eign People said that, be jabers, they'd come mighty near forgetting that entirely; and forthwith proceeded to stone the office of the "Dog" until the hasty discharge of an ink- stand from  one of the upper windows thereof induced them to make a hasty change of base. Without indulging in farther details, suffice it to say that the Sovereign People finally desisted from their struggle for liberty upon being satisfied that no more watches, purses, nor sick despots were to be got at con- veniently, and the "Evening Cat " came out in a spirited article in favor of an immediate war with France. How grateful should it be to our national pride, my boy, that even the stranger that is within our gates feels inspired by the very atmosphere with a jealous, a fighting love for perfect freedom, - especially if said gates be those of a State prison.

RECOUNTING A CHASTE "CRECONSTRUCTION "ANECDOTE OF THE SIXT1H WARD, AND DIVULGING CAPTAIN VILLIAM BBOWN S INGENIOUS ALPHABETICAL EXPERIMENT WITH COMPANY THREE. WASHINGTON, D. C., Sept. 25th, 1863. IT is a high-moral idea of poets, congressmen, and the writers for our improving weekly journals of exciting ro- mance, my boy, that it is a noble and majestic thing to feel warmly for one's country; but when the thermometer stands at 90 in the shade, and we join with our fellow- beings in shedding tears from the tops of our foreheads, I find my disinterested patriotism fully equal to the self- abnegation of the remark, that I had rather be cool than be President. Our brethren are already in the field; why stand we here idle? Is ice so dear, or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? For-- bid it, Almighty Dollars! I know not what other gentle- men would have; but as for me, give me liberty, or give me a fan. Thus, my boy, after the manner of the de- parted Patrick Henry, did I expose myself to the conserv- ative Kentucky chap, as we stood panting together in the vestibule of the Treasury Buildings the other day; and says he: "The loyal State of Kentucky, of which I am a part, has no objections to warm weather in the summer-time; provided it is not indorsed by the fanatical Black Repub-^ (172)  THRD SERIES.        173 licans. Warm weather," says- the conservative Kentucky chap, thoughtfiully, " is of much service to the old -rye crop of Kentucky; but Kentucky would forego even her old rye, rather than see retarded the movements of that army whose constitutional duty it is to restore the Union -not reconstruct it." The regular list of dead idiots for this year being not -quite full yet, my boy, there are still persons living who can perceive no very immense difference between Restor- ing the Union and Reconstructing the Union; which re- minds me of a chaste little incident that once occurred in the Sixth Ward.        X A highly-respectable liquor-selling chap, of enlarged stomach and overwhelming shirt-collar, having just been elected Alderman, through the influence of his excellent moral character, and about two thousand dollars judiciously invested in Irishmen, gave a fashionable party to celebrate this triumph of the purity of elections, and invited about two-thirds of the Fire Department to bring their wives and sweethearts. Promptly at nine o'clock, two Hose Companies, of unblemished reputations for noise, four En- gine Associations noted for saving one pine table from the devouring' element- to every two Brussels carpets they ruined with water, three Hook-and-Ladder Societies great- ly distinguished for climbing into the third-story windows of the building two doors from the burning domicil, and an equivalent number of the cotton-hearted women of Amer- ica, were on hand in the aldermanic drawing-rooms. The new public dignitary received them all with that ex- quisite blandness of demeanor which is so becoming to  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7327-00000088"/> 174      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. great men who have just made a rush from obscurity: and says he, - "Make yourselves at home now, boys, only don't spit on the carpet. If there's a fire while the swarry is goin' on, I'll let the old woman listen for the district and an- nounce it from the airy. We'll keep the winders up, and when -the hall-bell rings, you fellers as has to leave, can just slip down onto the front stoop without breaking up the entire swarry." Here the large-hearted aldermanic chap was called hastily downstairs to attend the bar, several army officers having just arrived in the ward, and the " swarry " com- menced as merrily as a fire in a carpenter's shop. It set in for a heavy dance at about eleven o'clock, and then were seen as many elaborate verses in the poetry of mo- tion, as any pair of eyes could wish to enjoy. "'Fifty's" foreman, who danced with a very pretty dotted muslin, produced a very striking and picturesque effect by rolling his inexpressibles up over his boots, and giving a life-like imitation of the working of an engine with his heels and toes; whereupon   the assistant foreman of "Thirty's Truck " suddenly threw off his dress-coat and appeared in full red shirt, simultaneously striking-into a fine, artistic shuffle, intended to imitate the hauling in and reeling-up of the wet hose after a conflagration. These and other graceful novelties were greatly admired by the ladies, each  of whom, said so many spicy and spiteful things about the other's bare arms and forward manners, that a stranger might have taken them  all for the very cream m of Fifth Avenue or any other Best Society. It was about midnight when "Fifty's " foreman, grow-   THRD SERIES.         175 ing reckless with the passionate splendors of excitement, scuffled away with his flushed dotted muslin to a luxu- rious chintz sofa near one of the windows, and intem- perately whispered in her ear, "iMiss Perkins, it were ,madness for me longer to conceal my insanity, and to re- main silent would but render'me speechless. Here let me lay my heart and trumpet at your feet, and '-- She had fainted! Ay, sir, swooned! Instantly the whole brilliant saloon was in confusion; the dancing ceased, the dust commenced to settle, and the assistant foreman of"Thirty's Truck " was seen to put on his coat. "Bring your hose here, quick, and play on her face!" shouted "Fifty's " foreman, half-crazed by what he had done. But the dotted muslin's mother now clutched her in her arms, and says she, "Let's get her into the dress- ing-chamber, and somebody bring a little sally wolatile." Here another dowager seized an arm of the fainting girl, and the two bore her tenderly into the retiring-room, followed by some two or three sympathizing young ladies. And now, my boy, it becomes my delicate duty to hastily sketch a scene which the masculine pen cannot too care- fully touch upon. It being one of the principles of wom- an's nature that some relaxations must be admitted in her toilet before she can revive from syncope, the second dowager commenced to relieve the fainting fair one of such articles of fashionable addenda as might retard her recovery. She took off her side-curls and back-hair and laid them upon a table; with great care she removed her upper teeth and placed them upon a chair ; softly wet-  ting a corner of her handkerchief in her mouth she effect- 8s  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7327-00000089"/> 176.

Mrs. Jobbins gave a sagacious look at the pa- tient, and says she: "Very true, mem; she is getting better. It wont take us many minutes to reconstruct her." "I beg your parding, Mrs. Jobbins," says the mater- nal, shaking her cap,--"I beg your parding Mrs. Jobbins; but your language is 'ineddicated, highly; you should say ' restore' her," Mrs. Jobbins straightened herself up, with a glare, and says she: Perhaps, mem, you can teach me eddication, and my own daughter a teacher these two years in the public schools! The ideor! I repeat it--to reconstruct her - put her together again." "Restore," says the maternal, savagely. "Reconstruct!" screamed Mrs. Jobbins. "You're a artful, ignorant old copperhead!" howled the maternal, dropping her daughter's head upon the floor, "And you're a spiteful, stuck-up, toothless old- ab'litionist!!" yelled the dowager, stamping until her snuff-box hopped out of her pocket. Drawn to the room by the noise, a hard old nut, a retired foreman of old "Sixty," stuck his head in at the   THRD SERIES.   '     1" door, and says he: "What are you old fools scrimmag- ing about? You're keeping the swarry back." Both the old ladies made at him at once to know which, in his opinion, was the right word,--'Recon- struct,' or ' Restore? ' The old nut took a thoughtful bite of tobacco, and says he: Let the girl herself tell you when she r'e- vives." Revive was the word, my boy; and while the old wom- en were quarrelling over the two terms aforesaid, poor nature got tired of waiting, and realized the right one in action for herself. The girl revived without being either restored, or reconstructed. And thus, my boy, I sometimes think, that, whilst noisy old political grannies are quarrelling as to whether the Union-shall be Restored, or Reconstructed, the faint- ing young Union will suddenly revive of itself. At -any rate, it bids fair to have plenty of time to do so. In a recent letter I noted the return of the main body of the invincible and time-honored Mackerel Brigade to what may be termed the place of its military birth; but I did not, nor can I, describe justly the many touching incidents of the retrogression. Once more, my boy, does this standard national martial organization find itselfon the right side of Awlkuyet River, and many a sensitive Mackerel, as he gazes through his tear-dimmed spectacles upon the surrounding scenery of his youth, fancies him- self a boy again, and'newly experiences in all his muscles that tingling sensation which, in the full-blooded lad, equally follows a public compliment and a private flogging. As the gory and venerable Brigade wound slowly back  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7327-00000090"/> 178     -ORPHEUS C. KEXR PAPERS. into the well-known fields rendered historically famous for making Washington safe, one very ancient Mackerel grounded his musket by the roadside, took off his specta- cles, looked with deep emotion upon the scenes of his early years, and says he to another Mackerel: - "Thank Heaven! we have at last reached the end of the war."  The other Mackerel paused in his work of cracking an army biscuit between two rocks, and says he: ' Which end do you mean, Sammy?" "Why," says Sammy, " the end we commenced at." Could it be possible, my boy, that there was a serious and profound truth in that unconsidered Mackerel re- mark? If so, we are indeed approaching the beginning of the war, and there is rather less of Mars than of Grand- Ma's in the management of the Virginia campaign. But why should my pen linger upon this monotonous theme, when the grim Fort Piano on Duck Lake, and the ancient city of Paris on the nether shore thereof, are being besieged on all sides by the Mackerel iron-plated patent squadron under the hoary Rear Admiral Head, and the Mackerel contingent and Orange County Howit- zers under Captains Samyule Sa-mith and Villiam Brown. Several times, my boy, has Fort Piano been entirely destroyed and taken by all our excellent and reliable morning journals, the columns of American news- papers being led on to victory - or leaded on to victory - with rather more ease than a dozen times as many col- umns of any troops in the world; but, inasmuch as the unseemly but well-known Southern Confederacy still keeps store there, it has been deemed proper to make   THRD, SERIES.       179 another iron-clad experiment in that salubrious vicinity. This time, however, the army takes part in the effort, as' well as the navy, and Captain Samyule Sa-mith, with the Orange County Howitzers, bombards the at- mosphere from the banks of the Lake, whilst the aged Rear Admiral Head, with his iron-plated squadron, per- forms fiery antics upon the briny element. The sailing of the squadron inside the bar was a beautiful sight, and was witnessed by a couple of English and French consuls who had come down to the banks of Duck Lake to see if they could recognize the Confederacy at that distance. First advanced Rear Admiral Head's flag- ship monitor, the "Shockinghadhat;" followed in-close order by the "Aitch," the "Yew," the." Em," the "Bee," the "You " and the "Gee." And now, my boy, you may probably imagine that I am about to relate, with Homeric fervor and the graphic eloquence of Tacitus, how the Mackerel Squadron poured whole foundries of shot and shell into Fort Piano; and how the Orange County Howitzers rained Greek Fire (Irish whiskey) into all the basement windows of Paris; but I have various reasons for doing nothing of the kind, inasmuch as the War Department does not desire that the enemy should be prematurely informed of the capture of the Fort and City. Suffice it to say, that everything is progressing favorably, though recent heavy rains have greatly incommoded such of the land forces as are not sup- plied with umbrellas. I think, however, my boy, that I may venture to de- scribe Captain Villiam Brown's alphabetical experiment with Company 3, Regiment 5, which constitutes the pres-  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7327-00000091"/> 180      ORPHEUS C.

Davis's experiment with his regiment in Mexico, when he formed it into a V shape to receive a cavalry charge, resolved to give his regiment that shape for the purpose of a roundabout sally upon Fort Piano from the rear, or land side.        * "Comrades," says Villiam, impressively, "V stands for Victory, Vengeance and Vashington, and I desire you to take its shape." The Mackerels formed themselves into a V, my boy; but when Villiam,'gallantly retired behind a tree to be out of the way, and gave the order "Forward-- double-quick, -march!"Sergeant O'Pake modestly stood out of the ranks, and says he:- "Of course you will go ahead of us, Captain? .

C., Dec. 27th, 1803. ANOTHER Christmas finds our great stragetic country in the toils of war, my boy, and the chiming of the bells is lost in the roar of ingenious artillery. Where blazes the yule log that misses not at least one manly form from its genial ring of quivering Christmas light; and where hangs the mistletoe bough beneath which at least one gentle, wo- manly heart beats not the quicker with fond thoughts of the lad whose first-.kiss upon her half-reluctant lips was des- tined to burn in future there as her keepsake from a hero?

But a truce to sentiment, my boy, when the most sentimental object I have seen for a week is the Conservative Kentucky Chap, whose imbibing method of celebrating the approach of Christmas invariably leadH him into disquisitions upon the wrongs of the heroic White Man.

"For 'the White Man," my boy, he" said; " for the White Man!"I  And was he not right? The noble being to whom he alluded is certainly richly justified in a very high pitch\of- pride over the gratifying fact, that his natural 'complexion  is considerably whiter than anything at all darker. In the abstract, my boy, it is not a positive white,' and its general hue, if characteristic of a napkin would hardly en- able that napkin to pass muster at the feast of an Apicius or a Lamia; but, as compared with other complexions, it is properly colorless, and strikes the elye very pleasantly when regarded by a single person in a mirror. So highly, indeed, do many possessors of this complexion admire its prevailing whiteness, that they perform their ablutions with an artistic design to leave here and there certain pic- turesque streaks of delicate shading, thereby causing the whiteness of the intervening spots to appear all the more dazzling. Others, again, religiously refrain from water outwardly as well as inwardly, for the apparent purpose of incrusting the purity of their valuable complexion in a protecting coat; thus preserving it from any possible bad effect of the sun. Still others, my boy, continue to prac- tise the thorough ablution of the ancients, but signally   ,THRD SERIES.        183 succeed in throwing out the whiteness of the level of their faces in excellent relief, by adopting measures to implant a contrasting red on the tips of their noses. And a foqrth class, having an eye to beauties of a White background for the exhibition- of chaste neutral tints, incur the frequent freckle and the graceful pimple with great judgment and taste. Considering the character of the White face with due profundity of thought, my boy, I am led to regard it as a canvas, expressly intended by nature to receive quick and vivid paintings of all the virtues; and so nicely adapted to the least of humanity's desires, that the woman who has no virtues to limn themselves -thereon, may yet paint it to suit herself. 'This cannot be said of the Black skin, my boy. Upon that the beautiful virtue of Modesty cannot paint itself in a blush when its owner is detected in the act of taking a bribe; nor is it susceptible of that beautiful sunset-tint which the geni*I. nerit of being able to punish four bottles at a sitting delights to leave upon a face of Caucasian ex- traction. It is even incapable of receiving those exquisite sub-ocular shades which adorn a White face after an evening's innocent enjoyment at the Club, and it fails sig- nally to aosorb the delicate tint of yellow not unfrequently perceptible near the outer corners of the busy dental de- partment of the tobacconizing White man's physiognomy. Taking all these" facts into calculation, my boy, it is plainly evident that the variously-ornamented White skin is an article much superior to the Black, and certainly designates its wearers as beings intended to move in noth- ing but the highest natural circles.  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7327-00000093"/> 184     ORPHEUS C.

Such being the case, we cannot blame the White Man for entertaining a wholesome contempt and loathing for the Black Man; and the truly hearty manner in which many of our more pallid fellow-countrymen breathe in- genious execrations whenever the latter is mentioned, may be accepted as a beautiful and touching proof that they appreciate God's benignity in giving them a'superiority of skin; even though He may have seen best, in His infinite wisdom, to ;leave them occasionally without brains. Having been informed that the ancient and spectacled Mackerel Brigade had returned from its monthly walk toward the well-known and starving Southern Confederacy, I ascended to the roof of my architectural steed, the Gothic Pegasus, on Thursday morn, my boy, and galloped slowly to the stamping ground of the unconquerable veterans.

"In the heart of a great city, whose corruption and wickedness in continually growing larger and richer, were evident 'to every smaller, and, consequently, more pious, town on the globe, dwelt a shamefully rich banker, named Pursimmons, who, notwithstanding his vile and enormous wealth, had refused to give it all to the virtuous poor. That it was utterly impossible for such a man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven need not be told; since we all know that honest poverty, alone, can hope for such entrance; and as poverty covers at least three-fourths of the human race, and is invariably honest, according to its own touch- ing account, there is likely to be enough of it to fill up all the standing room in Paradise, leaving no space for even the repentant wretch of a millionaire. Hence, it naturl- ly follows, that old Pursimmons was miserable, with all his wealth. In fact, a slim, black-dressed gentleman of  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7327-00000095"/> 188     ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. much spectacles and severe countenance, who had vainly solicited him to subscribe for ten thousand extra-gilt copies of his new work on ' The Relation of Sunday Schools with the Moral Organism of Normal Creation,' to be sent to the starving heathen of the Choctaw Nation, was heard to remark, emphatically, that he would rather be 'a ignorant but religious slake in the desert of Sahara, my brethren, than that godless man with all his filthy lucre.' Therefore, old Pursimmons must have been a continual prey to the most horrible twinges of guilty conscience that any one man, in the abundant excess of his own spiritual serenity, ever attributed to another of different views. All the year did this unhappy but fleshy old man sin against everything that is poor and pious by accepting all-ay, all --the profits his business was iniquitous enough to' produce ; and even rode in a carriage; though hundreds of noble-hearted Irishmen in the honest brick and mortar business had to walk, - ay, walk! - becom- ing so terribly exhausted thereby as to be invariably compelled to pause for rest, on their way home, at some humble liquor establishment. When Christmas Eve came round, it found this enemy of his race meanly retiring to bed, instead of scouring the highways and byways in search of reduced private families who might at that very moment be despairingly praying to have his last cent at their disposal. A man so thoroughly bad could not fail to be a pitiable coward, and it is not at all surprising that he was somewhat startled to suddenly perceive, between himself and his scandalously-comfortable bed, Mr. Pepper's Ghost! - the very same ghost once in full blow at all our moral temples of the drama.

Mr. Pepper's Ghost winked with great arch- ness as it replied: "Ghosts have no terrors for the sons of Thespis, who are even merry with a ghost-of a chance to get their salaries. My mission is to you, to whom I must a wholesome lesson teach. Behold I' "The spirit waved its hand, and lo! one whole. side of the vile banker's chamber fell magically away, disclosing to view a room entirely destitute of velvet carpet and pic- tures by the Old Masters. On a sofa reclined a middle- aged young girl, whose poor dress of braidless mering was so inclemently low in the neck as to suggest for its down- trodden wearer a purse too scanty to procure a sufficiency of material. The daughter of penury had just reached the hundred and fifty-second exciting page of the cheap but excellent work of fiction she was reading, when a door opened and her crushed husband entered, smoking his meerschaum.  "' Old boy,' said the Ghost,' do you remember that man?' "' Yes, responded the banker, sadly ; 'he came to me yesterday for some money to keep him from starvation; and as he would not take 'greenbacks,' I did not help him.'  "'Listen,' said the Ghost. "The crushed husband threw himself into a chair which was not covered with Solfering satin, and ate a peanut. "' Well, what luck?' asked the daughter of penury. ^                     m1  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7327-00000096"/> 190     ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS.

The daughter of penury fainted, the crushed husband sniffed aloud, and the landlady knocked at the door for the week's board. "As this agonizing picture of human misery faded away, old Pursimmons turned with an inaudible groan to Mr. Pepper's Ghost: "' And I,' said he, -' and I am the cause of this woe? ' "The spectre silently and solemnly nodded an awful affirmative, and waved its hand for another scene. "This time, the presentment was the interior of a shop, around which were shelves full of boxes containing all sorts of delicious little gaiters, ties, slippers, bootees and kid pumps, whilst the same kind of articles hung sus- pended from various hooks and pegs on'the wall. On a bench in one corner of this shop, busily working upon a dainty pink satin gaiter-boot, was a narrow young man of pensive countenance, weak eyes, pink nose and an intel- lectual head of hair, in a workmagi's paper cap manufac- tured from an admirable weekly journal of romance.  f "As the deeply-affected banker gazed upon this figure, he sorrowfully murmured: ' Ah! that is the deep-voiced youth who last week desired of me five hundred dollars to insure the publication of his new novel of Fashionable Life, which was destined to instantly sweep Dickens, Victor Hugo, Thackeray, and other demoralizing writers from the field of literature.'   THRD SERIES.        191 "' Yes I' said Mr. Pepper's Ghost, severely; ' and your miserly refusal to aid struggling genius with your misera- ble wealth has driven a giant intellect into the ladies' shoemaking business. In which,' added the spectre, ' I am bound to say, that he is doing tolerably well.' "The guilty old banker buried his face in his trembling hands; and when he looked up again, the vision had changed, and he saw before him the inside of a soldier's tent on the banks of the Rapidan, with :two gentle Zou- aves arraying themselves in their new uniforms, which had just arrived. Owing to some trifling mental aberration, accompanied by hiccups, which often attacks the members of an army confined to damp localities, these two troops had somehow mistaken their jackets for their pants, and were struggling with Herculean strength to thrust their dainty nether limbs into the sleeves of the first-named garments. After an animated struggle of about a quarter of an hour, something was heard to tear ; whereupon, one of the Zouaves tore his fractured jacket from his limbs, and dashed it furiously to the ground, hurling impreca- tions upon all hard-hearted wretches who coined money by making clothing out of rotten rags for the glorious defenders of their homes and firesides. "' Old boy,' thundered Mr. Pepper's Ghost, reproach- fully,' did you not have an interest with your brother, the -- street tailor, in that Government contract for uniforms? ' "'I did,' replied the mournful banker. "' Then behold,' said the spirit, ' how you have earned the eternal hate of your country's gallant volunteers, and will be handed down to future scorn and infamy as a 9  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7327-00000097"/> 192     ORPHEUS C.

' "' Well,' responded old Pursimmons, ' to tell the truth, I feel greatly bored and very sleepy.' "' And you wont bestow all your wealth upon the next poor widow with six small children?' "' Not exactly.' "Nor at least one half of it upon the Mission for the Regeneration of the starving Choctaw Nation? X "c' I'd rather be excused.' ' ' Well, then,' exclaimed Mr. Pepper's Ghost, plaintive- ly, 'wont you -wont you, oblige me with-a loan of five dollars?' "' Yes - if you will take greenbacks.' "At the word, Mr. Pepper's Ghost uttered a scream of despair, smote its breast frantically, and gave the chair upon which old Pursimmons had just seated himself such a vicious kick that the flinty-hearted 'banker suddenly awoke, found it all a dream, and, - went outrageously to sleep again; thereby giving convincing proof of that utter callousness of soul which all worthy poor men know to be the sure accompaniment of riches!"  As Villiam ceased reading, we all retired silently from the tent, greatly improved by what we had heard. And now, my boy, let me conclude with a little story of my own: Some --months ago, a certain western General gave an order to an Eastern contractor for a couple of peculiarly   THRD SERIES.        193 made gunboats for his service; but, happening to pass the White House, shortly after, saw what he took to be the models of two just such gunboats protruding out of one of the windows. Thinking that the President had- con- eluded to attend to the matter himself, he immediately telegraphed to the contractor not to go on with the job. Quite recently, the contractor,came here again, and says he to the General, - "I'd like to see the model of those White-House gun- boats." The General conducted him toward the White House, my boy, and the two stood admiring the models,which protruded from the window as usual. -Pretty soon a Westergr Congressman came along, and says the contractor to him: "Can you tell me, sir, whether those models of gun- boats up there are on exhibition?" "Gunboats!" says the Western chap, looking. "Do you take those things for gunboats?" "Of course," says the contractor. I "Why, you fool!" says the Congressman, " those are the Secretary's boots. The Secretary always sits with his feet out of the window when he is at home, and those are the ends of his boots I " Without another word, my boy, the, General and the contractor turned gloomily from the spot, convinced that they had witnessed the most terrific feet of the campaign.

THS gray-headed pen- of mine, my boy,--which is mightier than the sword, inasmuch as it can, itself, "draw " the sword when it chooses, quite as accurately as any pencil-vanian, - has run the blockade recentlyv im- posed upon it, and once more gambols nervously down the lines of contemporaneous military history. When first I heard that aphorism of the elegant and ghostly Bulwer, by which the sober sceptre of the scribe is magnified above- the  fancy-dress weapon of the hero, I took it to be like any other high-sounding sentiment of the stage, whereby the poor but virtuous editor was nobly and improvingly en- couraged to believe himself rather more powerful in this universe than all its groat captains put together. Being a child of the pen myself, I felt benignantly inflated by the venerable 6"Richelieu's" excellent remark, and looked with much generous pity upon a crushed young army officer in the box next to mine; but, at the same time, I remember that it reminded me of the exceedingly moral popular de  lusion making starving virtue a much pleasanter and more admirable thing to possess than a king's crown ; and I  also remember how it thereupon dawned upon me, that  (194)   'THRD SERIES.        195 the pen was possibly mightier than the sword only in'the far-removed sense of Might being Write. Since I have lived in Washington, however, I have learned, my boy, that the sentiment in question is capable of demonstration as a very plain fact; seeing, as I do, that off-hand strokes of the pen can in a very few minutes promote into Major Generals and Brigadiers certain pleasing brass-buttoned chaps whose actual swords could never have done as much for them in all their lives.- And yet, my boy, if all those poweerful, unsordid creatures, our country editors, had their youths to live over again, I verily believe that two-thirds of them would sooner be put to the sword than put to the pen. Such is man! Nevertheless, mighty as the pen may be, it must fail, equally with the well-known Southern Confederacy to do justice to this Capital of our distracted country in its pres- ent social peculiarities. The cackling of geese once saved the Capitol of the Roman Empire, my boy;, but it will take more geese than those who have come hither with the expectation of being respected for their virtues, to save Washington from permanent investment by all the specu- lative chaps on earth who have no other capital to invest. The present social circle around the family hearth of this Capitalian and Congressional town, my boy, is somewhat more remarkable than it was, even in the palmiest and -most mutually abusive days of our eloquent National Leg- islature, and fully equals the frequent domestic symposium of Albany when the State Legislature meet there. Look into a Washington home, and you shall find the venerable grandfather, who sits nearest the fire, talking and chuck- ling to himself over his success that day in depreciating  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7327-00000099"/> 196     ORPHEUS C.

Next sits the younger husband and father, cataloguing to his devoted wife, with the forefinger of his right hand upon all the fingers of his left, the successive pecuniary advantages sure to accrue from a contract he has just obtained to supply our national troops with patent suspenders, and which will enable him to return to New York in the spring, purchase a palatial residence on Fifth Avenue, and sign urgent and influential calls for Peace Conventions. Thirdly, my boy, we have the interesting wife and mother who listens to her lord and master's revelation with beaming satisfaction, glancing occasionally at her youthful son and heir, who, with two thimbles, is practising upon the rug at her feet the curious and ingenious game of the "Little Joker," whereby he' hopes to reap profit from his small associates on the mor- row. The fourth figure of this prayerful group around the home altar is the highly elaborated daughter, reading over her lover's shoulder, from a newspaper held conveniently by him, a spicy, exciting, moral tale of a daring spirit who had sold a sloop-load of hay, just as it floated, to the Gov- ernment, and then - when he had got his pay - set fire to it and burnt the whole concern so effectually, that very few could presume to-think that at least two-thirds of it had bebn old straw. It is a noble and beautiful thing to remember, or note, my boy, that the true and real Home,--the shrine of parental Love and Honor, and of childhood's Innocence and fearless trust,--is ever held sanctified by an unseen p-   THRD SERIES.        197 angel-circle, into which a few men can bring even so much of the scheming outer world as its cares; that its name, long, perhaps, after it has ceased to be, lives for our voices only in that plaintive medium tone, which, like the master- string of an instrument responding to a passionate touch, sums up, by its very cadence, all the noblest music of a life. It is this state of things in Washington that greatly con- fuses the stranger, and causes him to make strange and horrible mistakes as to personal identities. On Monday afternoon, as I stood musing in front of Willard's, after a dispassionate conversation with the Conservative Kentucky Chap as to the probability of Kentucky's consenting to the setting apart of the first of January as New-Year's day, I overheard a conversation between a middle-aged chap of much vest pattern from the rural districts, and one of the Provost Marshal's disguised detectives. The rural chap chewed a wisp of straw which he had been using as a toothpick, and says he: "That gentleman in a broad-brim hat, going along on the other side of the street, is a prominent New York pol- itician,- is he not?" The detective involuntarily rattled a pair of miniature handcuffs which were hanging from his watch-chain, and says he:...  "Ha! ha! truly!  That's a queer mistake. Why, that's Nandy Brick, the incendiary and negro-killer." Not at all discouraged by this failure at guessing, my boy, the rural chap glanced knowingly at another passer-by, and says he: *' '   &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7327-00000100"/> 198      ORPHEUS C.

"Really!" says the detective, with a slight cough, "' Really, you're wrong again, for that's ' Policy Loo,' the notorious Mexican murderer and thief." The rural chap bit his right thumb-nail irritatedly, and says he: "At any rate, I know who yonder tall, gentlemanly person in the black gloves is. It's a famous leader of fashions from Fifth Avenue." The detective opened his eyes widely at this, and says he . ' Why, there you miss it again. I think I ought to know ' Slippery Jim,' who got that fat contract to supplyr the army with caps, and made half of them of shoddy." The chap from the rural districts seemed very much ashamed of himself, my boy, for doing such a wrong to our admirable and refined Best Society; but he-was bound to try it once more, and so says he, shortly: "Perhaps you'll tell me that fleshy individual in a black silk vest, coming this way, an't the British Minister?" " "Wrong again, by thunder!" says the detective ; " for all the world knows that respectable cove to be. ' Neutral John,' the celebrated rebel-spy and blockade-runner." Indeed, appearances go so entirely by contraries here, that I really fear, my boy, --I really fear, that many of our veritable great politicians, diplomatists, and Missouri Delegates, are frequently taken for unmitigated rogues by blundering amateurs in physiognomy.

EXPLAINING THE WELL-MEANT DUPLICITY OF THE JOURNALS OF THE OPPOSITION; AFFORDING ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF THE IRREPRESSIBLE CONSERVATIVE SENTIMENT; AND SHOWING HOW THANKSGIVING DAY WAS KEPT BY THE MACKERELS. WAsHNaGTN, D. C., Dec. 10th, 1864. THANKSGIVING Day, my boy, is an able-bodied national festival which has dwelt unctuously in all my less spirit- ual annual reminiscences, since that poetical and beautiful time of life when the touching innocence of childhood tempted me to surreptitiously pick a chicken-leg while my good grandfather was asking a blessing; and to receive therefor that wholesome box of the ears, which not unfre- quently imparts a temporary and excessive warmth to the brain of virtuous boyhood. 'Tis sweet to remember that old-fashioned Thanksgiving Eve, my boy, when the vener- able and widowed Mrs. McShane, our cook, would renew her annual custom of inveigling us children into the kitchen on pretence of admiring our new shoes; and then proceed, by divers artful and melancholy phrases, to darken our little souls with a heart-sickening conviction of her utter failure to procure, in her recent trip to market, that long- anticipated Turkey! 'Tis pleasant- to recollect how en- tirely we were cast down thereat, and how rigidly we refrained from so much as a single glance toward the old "Dresser,' whereon stood the well-known market-basket (201)  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7327-00000102"/> 202      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. of Mrs. McShane, with the plump legs of the choicest of gobblers protruding very obviously therefrom! 'Tis joy- ous to recall how we stared mercilessly at every possible thing in the kitchen except that "Dresser; " and how desolately we received certain sadly-philosophical remarks from Mrs. McShane, as to the unspeakable admiration assuredly merited by those " rale good childers," who -could, for one Thanksgiving Day, endure starvation with- out tears. The little deception was most tenderly anti kindly meant, my boy; it was the artless roguery of a dear old heart-- the gentlest of cheats-- the fondest of frauds; and the very remembrance of it, at this remote moment, not only fills my manly bosom with the softest charity, but endows me with a nicer mental perception of actual good in seeming wickedness, than any yet disclosed by my more obtuse fellow-countrymen. Thus, my boy, when I note hdw some of our excellent Democratic daily journals attempt to prove, with great sadness of manner and profound sincerity of reluctant reasoning, that all the celebrated advances, conquests, and flankings of our remarkable national armies are really so many heart-breaking defeats in deep disguise; and that the well-known Southern Confederacy is actually quite in-  toxicated with its continued remorseless successes over us'; when I note this, my boy, I am moved to pleasant tears over that inherent and ineradicable goodness of human nature, which-instinctively inspires the nobler of our spe- cies to first delude their fellow-beings to despondency with the most innocent of falsehoods, only that their consummate bliss may be- the greater when the glorious truth can no o.   THRD SERIES.        203 longer be thus fondly concealed. Join with me, my boy, in a noble tribute of affection to the humble but tender Editors of these excellent Democratic daily journals, who would lovingly make us, children of the nation, believe, that the Turkey of Victory is not to be had at any price, though none of us need look very far to see the plump legs of that very same turkey sticking out of the family- basket. Thanks to thee, thou dear old Mrs. McShane, with thy perpetual atmosphere of roast-beef gravy, and eternal rims of crusted flour about thy finger-nails-- thanks be to thee for that humanizing remembrance of thy loving fraud, which- thus enables me to rescue our excel- lent Democratic daily journals from the unseemly imputa- tions of degenerate Black Republicans. My long absence with our somewhat tedious national troops, my boy, - troops now constituting a flaming neck- tie about the throat of this exciting Rebellion; - my long absence, I say, has given this Capital City of our dis- tracted country an opportunity to thrive apace in the de- velopment of those public and private virtues, which so thoroughly unpopularize Vice in this chaste locality, that even the Vice President is never heard of. True it is, that one misses those pleasant and gorgeous chaps of much watch-chain and an observable extent of diamond breastpin, who were wont, in the days of genial Southern preponderance, to lend lustre to the hall-ways of the more majestic hotels, and occasionally induce the inebriated son of Chivalry to join them at Faro his table.

And oh! we miss those languishing magnolia belles, whose eyes always reminded me of fresh drops of ink on tintefd paper, and whose beautiful belief in the utter vulgarity of all Northern ladies it was really quite delightful to hear. Yes, my boy, all, all are gone; but we have in their places such representatives of genu- ine republican simplicity as you shall not see again in a circuit of the globe. Our hotel-halls are brightened by youthful forms in the self-sacrificing uniform of our na- tional army; and these youthful forms, being mostly from the country, confine their innocent gaming, almost exclu- sively, to the athletic game. df "checkers." The promi- nent walking-gentlemen of Willard's wear black velvet vests all the year round, and, so far from shooting waiters, are always on the most familiar terms with that oppressed race; joking freely with them and recognizing them as intimate equals, as all genuine citizens of a true Republic should do. And as for our present Washington ladies, - wearing Lisle-thread gloves at the dirner-table and- put- ting almonds and raisins into their pockets before leaving it, God bless 'em! - why they know no more of anything vulgar, than a maniac does of insanity. Reflecting upon these things, on Monday last, my boy, I strolled abstractedly into an establishment where they sell army stores, such as lemons by the slice, sugar by the half-ounce, etc. I strolled dreamily in, when who should I see at the crockery-counter but the -Conservative Ken- tucky chap, whose hat was very far down over his eyes, i                  .

He appeared to be taking Richmond at the moment, my boy, with a spoon in it; and as quickly as I entered, he let the hand grasping it fall suddenly down on his obverse side, and gave his entire and most unremitting attention to the picture of a flesh-colored young lady on the farthest wall. I slapped him on the shoulder, and says I: "Well, my ancient Talleyrand, how are we?" The Conservative Kentucky chap gloomily placed his tumbler upon the stomach of a gentleman in checked pants, who was calmly sleeping on three chairs near the stove, and says he: -"Kentucky can no longer blind her- self to the fact that we are on the brink of a monikky. Yes!" exclaimed the Conservative chap, - wildly tearing off his hat, and then putting it on again so that it entirely covered his left eye,--"Yes, sir, a monikky with a Yankee for its Austrian tyrant!" Here the Conservative Kentucky chap deliberately but- toned his coat to the very neck, turned up his collar, and gazed sternly at q bowl of cloves near by. I called his attention to the Ten of Spades, which was edging itself down between his hat and his right ear, and says I, - "Hast proof of this, Horatio?"       .

And this - this - is Kentucky's reward i" At this crisis the Conservative Kentucky chap shut the stove-door with great violence, and seemed for a moment, to meditate personal outrage on the young assistant oys- terer, who had just arrived with the coal-skuttle. Before I could make rejoinder, my boy, there ap- proached us a middle-aged gentleman in a shocking bad hat and an overcoat very shiny about the seams, who had cordially invited himself to take a little something that morning, and had accepted the invitation with pleasure. Straightening himself suddenly, with a violent start, to restrain an unruly hiccup, or make me believe that he made the noise with his feet, he eyed the Conservative chap with a benignant smile, and says he: "You're mistaken there, sir, --muchly, sir, hem! Mr. Smith is my friend, sir; my bosom friend, till time shall end.--Beautiful idea, that.--My friend, I say; and he's only been appointed to the medical department by recommendation of the President,-Let nature do her best, and then your doctors are of use to men.- Byron.- Yes, sir, Mr. Smith is now a military doctor; and that's how you've made the mistake. You thought it was ' Sir John' Smith they said, when it was I Sur-geon' Smith!" As he said this, filhe middle-aged gentleman became aware that one of his toes was sticking very much through his boot, and retired to confidentially ask the assistant- oysterer if any one had yet found that valuable diamond scarf-pin which he (the middle-aged gentleman) hadare- cently lost.   THRD SERIES.        207 I looked at the Conservative Kentucky chap, my boy, -and his chin had sunk down upon his breast. He felt that his mistake was also the mistake of Kentucky, and his heart was too full for further conversation. 'Twas on Thursday morn, --Thanksgiving Day,- that I blithely scaled the heights of my faithful Gothic steed, the architectural Pegasus, and softly urged that ruined temple of a horse to trot me a lively reminiscence of his youth. Forward we went with a unique, chopping motion, with now and then a stumble to keep the blood in circulation, interpersed with occasional plunges at stumps and shyings at fluttering withered leaves. When you have mounted a beloved horse, on a fine, bracing autumnal morning, my boy, did you ever feel like a kind of new and superior being; as though you and your steed were one consummate individual, inspired by one bounding, uncon- trollable impulse, and impatiently regarding the line of the horizon as a tyrannical limit to a ride that should else tear gallantly and recklessly forth into illimitable space? Did you ever feel thus, my boy?  .  .  .  . Because, if you did, your feelings were not at all like mine.

Following him, but on foot, was Captain Bob Shorty in command of the famous Conic Section of the Mackerel Brigade.  "Ha!" says Villiam, leaping down to meet me in dreadful entanglement with his sword, and hastily plung- ing into his bosom a small black bottle of regulation cough-drops, " have you flown hither like an narrer from a bow, to view the sublime spectacle of the troops at their feed? Ah!" says Villiam, quickly clasping his hands to save the bottle from slipping out of his breast-pocket, "the beautiful pageant of a nation feasting these martial beings on turkey, is something for besotted Europe to tremble at.

"Why," says the aged Mackerel, coughing into his hand, " if them's the turkeys the people have sent us for Thanksgiving, we're ready for 'em." "You're right, Sarah," says Villiam, magnanimously, "and we'll open this first case at once. The trade-mark of this case," says Villiam, learnedly, " is ' 50 Turkeys with Care.'" They were prying the lid off, my boy, with bayonets, and the eyes of the surrounding Mackerels had com- menced to glisten fierily through their spectacles, when I saw Villiam  and Captain Bob Shorty exchange looks of deep meaning, and shake their heads like a couple of mel- ancholy mandarins. "Robert S.," says Villiam, with a look of deep perplex- ity, "this is indeed a strange oversight." Captain Bob Shorty shook his head sadly, "And yet," says Villiam, sternly, ", we must tell these beings about it." "There's no avoiding it, by all that's Federal!" mur- mured Captain Bob Shorty. Captain Villiam Brown sighed deeply, and says he: "Soldiers, the people of the United States of America meant well in sending such beautiful birds for our Thanks. giving  bankwick; but they've made a  strange  mistake.

At this juncture the same'old Mackerel again stepped forward, and asked if the turkeys came by mail? "( No," says Villiam, with much sympathy of manner. "I don't mean postage-stamps, but the Internal Revenue. Turkeys," says Villiam, reasoningly, "come under the head of ' Unnecessary Luxuries,' and are not legal unless stamped.  But," says Villiam, with sudden benignity, "( your officers possess the necessary stamps, and will sell them to you at twenty-five cents apiece." It was a beautiful proof of the untiring vigilance and energy of our national regimental officers, my boy, that they happened to have the stamps on hand just as they did; though, if there happened to be stamps required on geese, I am afraid that every Mackerel who paid his twen- ty-five cents would come in for one of those chaste little pictures on himself. And now, the stamps being purchased and the New England eagles distributed, there commenced such a scene of martial revelry and good-nature as the world never saw before. In every direction - at the openings of tents - around open-air fires - everywhere, the jolly festival went on. '{- Strolling to the outer picket-line, I saw a Mackerel chap lay aside his gun, seat himself upon the ground, and com- mence handling a nice little turkey which had just been brought to him by a comrade.

Right across the little field in front of us, seated on the last remaining post of a ruined fence, was a ragged Con- federacy, in a perfect whirlpool of tatters, who had rested his musket upon the ground, and was alternately gnawing an army biscuit and casting longing looks toward his hap- pier enemy. He was a dreadfully thin, hollow-eyed chap, my boy, and shivered in the cold. The Mackerel stared at him without motion for some minutes, and, then com- menced to handle his turkey again. Then he stared again, dropped his turkey, picked it-up, and finally rose to his feet impatiently --looked toward his nearest comrade - and then seated himself with his back toward the Con- federacy. Still the latter gnawed and looked longingly. The Mackerel said, " damme!" quite distinctly and stout- ly, and vigorously grasped at a " drumstick" again. He gave it a twist, paused, wavered, and looked over his shoul- der. In another instant, my boy, that- Mackerel sprang to his feet, faced about, shouted: -  i 'I'll do it, by G-d! if I swing  r it" -dashed across the field like a stark madman, and, before the as- tonished Confederacy could budge an inch, had hurled the turkey into his arms and was tearing back to his own  post.

His venerable hat, my boy, sat far down over his ears, like some shabby bird of night just stooping to carry off two oysters; a curious antiquity in the shape of a black stock loomed gloomily under his chin, as a memorial sep-  ulchre in which some departed collar was supposed to be sacredly entombed; his face was toward Kentucky, and in his hands he was vivaciously shuffling a number of cards. "Hum, hem!" soliloquized the Conservative Kentucky chap, complacently - " ten of spades - king of diamonds --king of hearts -ace of clubs- ace of hearts--ace of" - 'Here the Conservative Kentucky chap uttered an abso- lutely startling cough and, at the same instant, passed three of the aces up his left sleeve!

The Conservative Kentucky chap sprang wildly to his feet, my boy, simultaneously, " making a pass" of the cards into his pocket, and commenced dancing insanely before me with a view of hiding from my notice the four of clubs, which he had dropped to the ground and was anxious to conceal in the mud. "Ha! ha!" observed the Conservative Kentucky chap, somewhat hysterically, in the midst of his dance; "of course you didn't see what I was doing?" Then it was, my boy, that I folded my arms after the manner of Hamlet, threw forward my right knee, shook my head profoundly thrice, and murmured, with the poet: "Were his old mother near him now, how would that mother grieve, To see two aces in his hand, - another up his sleeve." "My mother!" exclaimed the Conservative Kentucky chap, suddenly descending into Cimmerian gloom; "Ken- tucky is my mother, and from her maternal fount I drew the old rye of my existence. But now, Kentucky be- comes a indigent pauper under the Constitutional Amend- ment -and the failure of the Bankrupt Bill, and I find myself compelled to take to bluff and poker in the prime   THRD SERIES*        217 of life." Here the poor chap made a move toward tearing his hair, but thought better of it and only scratched a pimple on his chin. Arm in arm we walked slowly forward together, each    r busied with his own thoughts, until, from a clump of trees by the road-side, there -unexpectedly emerged before us that ornament of our national service known as Captain Bob Shorty, with his cap at a fierce cock, his hands in his pockets, and a supernaturally knowing air clothing him as. with a garment. "By all that's Federal!" said Captain Bob Shorty, starting at sight of me, " if I didn't take you at first for that ere Confederacy of the name of Munchausen, which has privately appointed to meet me here in single combat." "Why then, really, you know," observed the Conserv- ative Kentucky chap, suddenly coming forward and pleas- antly rubbing his hands, " really it would be a good plan for me to go forward and meet him with a view to peace negotiations. Being a Confederacy, he is Kentucky's brother," warbled the Conservative chap, with soft en-   i thusiasm, " and I might tell him that you would pay all   i his debts, black his boots, run errands for him, and send .

We saw him reach a turn in the path, around which the sound of stately approaching footsteps was already becoming audible. We saw him turn it; heard all the footsteps cease; heard a confused murmur, -a sharp scratching as of heels upon gravel;: and Kentucky's favor- ite son was observed to be coming again to his place, with a slight limp in his walk. Right behind him came a remarkable being attired in fragments of gray cloth and a prodigious thicket of whis- kers, through the latter of which his eyes glared yellowly, like the bottles in an apothecary's shop down the street. As he approached nearer, he hastily put on a pair of partially-dissected white cotton gloves, and casually re- arranged the strip of carpet-binding which served him as a -full-dress cravat. "Yours, truly," said Captain Bob Shorty. "Vandal!" hissed Captain Munchausen, removing   * from his brow an unexampled conglomeration of rags in the last stages of cap, and handing it to a faithful contra- band who attended him. "Why, then," said Captain Bob Shorty, doffing his own cap, and tucking up his sleeves, " in the name of the United States of America, I propose to move upon your works immediately." And now, my boy, do I particularly lament my lack of those unspeakable intellectual gifts, which enable the more refined reporters of all our excellent moral daily journals to describe the fistic achievements of the noted Arkansas   THRD SERIES.        219 Mule and celebrated Jersey Bantum in a manner that de- lights every well-conducted breakfast-table in the land, and furnishes exquisite reading for private families.

With fists to match, and eyes shining like the bottoms of glass bottles, the wary Munchausen scuffles cautiously back from him in a half circle. Now they make skips toward each other; and now they skip back. Anon an arm is raised, and is parried; and then they- balance to partners; and then they hop back. I was gazing at all this, my boy, in speechless admira- tion, when suddenly I saw the dexter hand of Captain Bob Shorty pierce the enemy's lines, and explode with tremendous force on Munchausen's nose. For a moment there was a sound as of Confederate blasphemy, blt in a moment the chivalric Munchausen was himself again. "Ah!" said Captain Bob Shorty, agreeably, " did you see the star-spangled banner that time?" ' Sir," said' Munchausen, with tears in his eyes, t"I am thankful that my nose is broken. It is a blessing; for I had nothing to smell with it, and only wasted my strength in its special defence." Here Captain Bob Shorty looked jovially at me, my boy, and says he, "By all that's Federal! an't he jolly?" "Come on to thy ruin," roared Munchausen from be- hind his rapidly increasing nose; and again the battle raged.         *  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7327-00000111"/> 220     ORPHEUS C, KERR PAPERS. Now did Captain Bob Shorty sidle to the left, with a view to flanking; but two columns of the enemy met him there. Next the agile Munchausen attempts, by a quick turn, to take him in the rear of his position, but finds a strong body of five divisions hurled upon his headquar- ters with an impetuosity that knocks out half his teeth. "Art satisfied, Horatio?." said Captain Bob Shorty, with more or less Bowery Theatre in his manner. An awful smile appeared upon what were left of the features of Captain Munchausen. It was so full of scorn, -you know. "Sir," said he, with much chivalry of bearing, and some difficulty of utterance, "my jaw may be broken, but I thank fate for it. It's a long time since I had any- thing to eat with my mouth, and to defend it at all was useless." ' Ha! ha! ha!" roared Captain Bob Shorty; " 1 really-never did see anything so jolly." "Madman!" yelled Munchausen, ,' your destruction is : decided!"  Then were all the skips and hops repeated, my boy; with such ornamental bits of occasional fine art as the re- fined reporters of our excellent moral daily journals love to dwell fondly upon.  Were I but such a reporter, I would describe the scene in al way to make you take it home  to your children. But let me not waste time in lamentation; for, just then, a something heavy fell upon the right eye of Captain Muhchausen, and  effectually closed it for a week.

BEING ANOTHER AND FINAL CHRISTMAS REPORT; INCLUDING A SMAL1 STORY FROM OUR UNCLE ABE; A CIRCULAR FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE; A SUPERNATURAL CAROL FROM SERGEANT O'PAKE; AND A TREMENDOUS GHOST STORY FROM AN UNAPPRECIATED GENIUS. WASHINGTON, D. 0., Dec. 27th, 1864. UPON these holy anniversary-days of "Peace on Earth, good-will toward men," the American human mind is naturally prone to regret that the well-known Southern Confederacy still survives, in a degree, all its inexpressible spankings, and still compels the noblest of us to pour out pur substitutes like water. You, my boy, have poured out your substitute; other great and good men have poured out their substitutes, and your devoted pockets bleed at every pour. O war! thirsty and strategical war! how dost thou pierce the souls of all our excellent Democratic journals, against whom the increased war-tax on whiskey is an outrage not to be mentioned without swearing. On Christmas-day, my boy, there came - to this city a profound Democratic chap of much stomach, who wore a seal-ring about as large as a breakfast-plate, and existed in a chronic condition of having the bosom of his shirt unbuttoned to such a degree as to display picturesquely the red flannel underneath. He ran for Sheriff' of Squan- kum last month, my boy; and having been defeated -with great slaughter, concluded that all was gall and bitterness, (222)    THRD SERIES.        223 and that he couldn't do better than come to Washington and improve the President's mind, At the time of the interview, our Honest Abe was sit- ting before the fire, peeling an apple with a jack-knife; and the fact that part of- his coat-collar was turned inside, did not lessen in him that certain generous dignity which hale good-nlature ever wears, as morning wears the sun. "Mr. President," says the profound Democratic chap, spitting with dazzling accuracy into a coal-hod on the op- posite side of the room ; "I call upon you to-day, sir, not as a politician, but as a friend. And as a friend, ir "- here the Democratic chap wore a high-moral look, and his shirt-bosom yawned as though eager to take all the world into the red-hot depths of his affectionate flannel heart,- "as a friend, sir, I feel bound to tell you, that your whole administrative policy is wrong; and as for your Eman- cipation Proclamation, it has had no effect at all, as I can see." Here the profound Democratic chap stuck a cheap bone eyeglass into his right eye, and seemed to think that he rather had him there. The Honest Abe peeled his apple, and says he: "' Neighbor, the sane men of all parties think differently from you in that matter."- "That proves, I suppose," says the Democratic chap, wrathfully, " that I'm a lunatic." The Honest Abe ate a piece of apple, and says he: ' Not at all, neighbor; not all; nothing so serious as that. But talking about what a difference of opinion 'proves,' " says the Honest Abe, balancing one boot upon the toe of the other, and smiling peacefully at his jack- 10*  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7327-00000113"/> 224      ORPHEUS C.

The defendant made reply, that he had honestly supposed the plaintiff to be insane on one point, at least, and that was the motion of the world around the sun. This mo- tion was denied in toto by the plaintiff, who had frequent- ly, of late, greatly astonished everybody and shocked the schoolmaster, by persisting in-the assertion that the world' did not spin round at all, inasmuch as he had never seen it spin round. "Various witnesses were called for both sides," says the Honest Abe, pleasantly scratching his chin; " various ones were called, to testify as to whether such difference of opinion from all the rest of mankind would seem to prove the insanity of the venerable Sucker; but nothing decisive was arrived at until old Doctor Dobbles was ex- amined. Old Dobbles," says the Honest Abe, winking softly to himself, '" was not quite such a teetotaler as may be told about in the ' Lives of the Saints,' and when he took the stand we expected something. "Says the Court to old Dobbles: "'In your opinion, doctor, does a man's denial that the world turns round, inasmuch as he has never seen it go round, prove his insanity? ' "' No,' says Dobbles. "( Ah!' says the Court, 'what then? '   THRD SERIES.        225 "Why,' says old Dobbles, deliberately, 'ifa man denies that the world goes round, and has never seen it go round, it simply proves that he -never was drunk.' "As it happened," says the Honest Abe, balancing his jackknife, on the tips of all his fingers; " as it happened that the Court himself had frequently seen the world go round, the justice of the idea flashed upon him at once, and the defendant was found guilty of six dollars' dam- ages, and ordered to treat the Court. "Now," says the Honest Abe, -with a winning smile, "I am far from inferring, neighbor, that you have never been intoxicated; but it seems to me, that when you say the Proclamation has had no effect at all, it proves you can't be speaking soberly." The profound Democratic chap came away, my boy, with a singing in his head, and has been so tremendously confused' ever since, that he asked me this morning at Willard's, if I thought, that what we of war see is any- thing like what Thaddeus of Warsaw. On Monday, while I was on my way to the Mackerel camp, before Paris, to be present at the usual Christmas song-singing and story-telling in the tent of Captain Vil- liam Brown, I met an affable young chap, driving a wagon, in which were some thousands of what appeared to be newly-printed circulars. I knew that the young chap came from a large printing-office in the lower part of the city, and says I: "Tell me, my young Phaeton, what have we here?" The affable young chap closed one eye waggishy at a handy young woman who was cleaning the upper windows of a houase ear by, and says he:  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7327-00000114"/> 226      ORPHEUS C.

Thus: during a great battle which I attended in Accomac, a piece of shell tore off my head,- that is to say, thbe head of my cane. At the second battle of Paris, while I was in the act of taking notes of the prevailing strategy, a cannon-ball took my legs off, - that is to say, the legs of my camp- stool.

"Says Mrs. Mike O'Mulligan, when Christmas came, said she: Suppose we give a little ball this evening after tea; The entry-way is broad enough to dance a dozen pairs, And thim that doesn't wish to dance can sit upon the stairs:   THRD SERIES.          229 "' And sure," said M. O'Mulligan, ' I don't object to that; But mind ye ask the girls entire, and ev'ry mother's Pat; d ,wish them all, both girls and boys, to look at me and see, That, though I'm School Commissioner, I'm noways proud," says he. The matter being settled thus, the guests were notified, And none to the O'Mulligans their presences denied; But all throughout the spacious house the colleens went to fix, And left the men to clane themselves and twirl their bits of sticks. "'Twas great to see O'Mulligan, when came the proper hour. Stand smiling in the entry-way, as blooming as a flower, And hear him to each lady say, "Well now, upon me sowl! Ye look more like an angel than like any other fowl." "And first came Teddy Finnigan, in collar tall and wide, With Norah B. O'Flannigan demurely by his side; And Alderman O'Grocery, and Councilman Maginn, And both the Miss Mulrooneys, and the widowed Mrs. Flynn. "The Rileys, and the Shaunesseys, and Murphys all were there, Both male and female creatures of the manly and the fair; And crowded was the entry-way to such a great degree They had to take their collars off to get their breathing free. O'Grady with his fiddle was the orchestra engaged, He tuned it on the banisters, and then the music raged; ' Now face your partners ev'ry man, and keep your eyes on me, And don't be turning in your toes indacently,' says he. "And when the dance began to warm, the house began to shake, The windows, too, like loosen'd teeth, began to snap and break; The stove-pipes took the ague fit, and clattered to the floors, And all the knobs and keys and locks were shaken from the doors.  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7327-00000116"/> 230       ORPHEUS C.

"It chanced as M. O'Mulligan was fixing something hot, The spoon was shaken from his hand, as likewise was the pot; The plaster from the ceiling, too, came raining on his head, And like a railway-carriage danced the table, chairs, and bed. "He tore into the entry-way, and ' Stop the jig!' says he: 'Its shakin' down the house ye are, as any one can see;' But not a soul in all the swarm to dance at all forbore, And thumping down their brogans came, like hammers on the floor. "And then the house commenced to sway and strain and groan and crack, And all the stairs about the place fell crashing, front and back; The very air was full of dust, and in the walls the rats Forgot, in newer perils found, all terror of the cats. "Then swifter flew O'Grady's bow, and ' Mike, me lad,' he roared, 'They'll dance until they haven't left your floor a single board; It's sperits that they are,' says he, ' and I'm a sperit, too; And sperit, Mike O'Mulligan, is what we'll make of you!' ' And sure,' said M. O'Mulligan, though turning rather pale, 'Its quite a handsome ghost ye are, and fit for any jail: But tell me what I've done to you offinsive in the laste; And if I don't atone for it, I'm nothing but a baste.' "' It's faithless to Saint Tammany ye are,' O'Grady cried,- And wilder, madder, grew the jig as he the fiddle plied, - ' It's faithless to Saint Tammany, who bids the Irishman Attain the highest office in this country that he can.'   THRD SERIES.           231 ' Och hone!' says poor O'Mulligan, 'it's pretty well I've done, To be a School-Commissioner before I'm thirty-one; 'Tis barely just a year to-day since I set out from Cork, And now, be jabers I don't I hold an office in New York? ' "' Why, true for you, O'Mulligan,' O'Grady roared again; 'But what's a School-Commissioner to what ye should have been? It's County Clerk, the very laste, an Irishman should be, And, since you're not, receive the curse of Good Saint Tam- many!-' "Then wilder danced the spirit crew, the fiddler gave a scowl; And scarce could fated Michael raise a goods old Irish howl, When all the timbers in the house went tumbling with a crash, Reducing M.

"Take warning now, all Irishmen, of what may be your fate, If you come home on Christmas-night an hour or so too late; For sleeping on the garret stairs, and rolling down, may be To you, as unto Mike, a dream of good Saint Tammany!" The deep, terror-stricken silence following  this ghastly legend was suddenly broken, my boy, by a frenzied shriek from my frescoed dog, Bologna, who had followed me down fro n Washington, and whose stirring tail had been accidentally trodden upon by the absorbed Mackerel Chaplain.   The picturesque animal, with a  faint whine not unlike the squeaking of a distant saw, walked toward Captain Bob Shorty and gazed inquisitively for an instant into his face; then   took earnest nasal cognizance of the boots of Captain Samynle Sa-mith; then sat for an instant on his haunches, with his tongue on special exhibition; and, finally, went out of the tent.

At the culmination of this sublime burst, Villiam again melted into tears, smiled around at us like a summer-sunset through a shower, and gracefully sank below the horizon of the table, like an over-ripe planet.

Having thus prepared commodious stabling for a thoroughbred nightmare, he looked at his hands, looked at his watch, looked at the fire-irons, looked at his slippers in perspective, and at once fell into an English revery,- which differs materially from an American one, as every- body knows, being much superior.

Your sin was pride; your atonement must be humiliation. You must get yourself Kicked!' "' Kicked!' ejaculated R. Fennarf, in a great state of excitement; 'why, really, Mr. G., I would bear any- thing to gain my desire; but that's rather a severe thing; and, beside, I don't know that I have an enemy in the world to do the kicking for me - except it is the pothoy, and his legs are too short.'

Fennarf fell into a revery: where could he gc to make sure of a kick? He might go out into the street and tweak the nose of the first brother-Englishman, he saw; but would that Englishman kick him for it? No! He would only sue him next day for damages. No Frenchman would kick a Britisher; because it is the policy of France just now to appear immensely fond of all that's British. Nor German. Nor Spaniard. 'Ah! ' exclaimed Mr. R. Fennarf, joyously,' I have it! The very place for me is C the formerly-united Republic of North America." They hate the very name of English- man there.

"' Take my 'arriet, sir,' she exclaimed, enthusiastically, 'and be assured that she will make you a good wife. It 'as always been my 'ope to 'ave such a son-in-law.' "Mr. R. Fennarf felt that his case was becoming desper- ate; his chance of regaining his daughter further off than ever. Fairly crazy to be kicked, he familiarly chucked Miss Harriet under the chin, and, assuming a perfectly diabolical expression of countenance, deliberately tickled her! "' Haw! haw! haw!' roared Mr. Putnon Ayres, hold- ing his sides with delight, ' that's the real English frank- ness, my dear son, - for such I must already call you,- and no American girl could be less than 'appy to perceive it.'

"' You mean what there is left of your United States,' he yelled, like a very ruffian. ' You Yankees never did know how to speak the English language.' And he actu- ally spat upon a file of the ' Daily Fife ' hanging near him, and sneered pointedly at a lithograph of the editor over the fireplace. "St. Albans grasped his hand convulsively. "' Spoken like Carlyle, sir; spoken like Carlyle. Your English honesty is worthy your English heart of oak, my dear friend.' "' Sir!' roared R.

He heard the roll of drums, the scattering cracks of mus- kets, and found himself seated in the tent of that same Major General Steward who has so nobly said, on innu- merable appropriate occasions, that he was ready to fulfil his whole duty in defeating the Southern rebels; but could not help wishing, as a man, that the enemy were Englishmen rather than our own brothers.  nhen he would show you!

In a second he was at the corner of his own street, and, with the rod in his hand, started upon a distracted run for his own lonely house.

WASHINGTON, D. C., March 6th, 1865. ME:TriNKS, my boy, that I see you sagely assuming a pair of massive ears; a pair of silver spectacles, and a blue cotton umbrella, for the purpose of accurately personating the celebrated Public Sentiment, and, in that gifted char- acter, peremptorily requiring me to explain the present use of the venerable Mackerel Brigade! Mastering for a moment the noble rage of the unimper- illed patriot at a request so vulgarly practical, I sternly refer you to the latest able articles in all our exciting and learned morning journals; wherein you will be taught that such portion of the aged Mackerel organization as has of late years invested Paris is in reality the gorgeous Piv- ot around which revolve all the other brass buttons of ulti- mate national triumph. And is not each editor of these excellent and sanguine morning journals well qualified by his military genius to represent a General Ism, oh?

It may be that your cornea lacks abil- ity to transmit a specific image in that polarization of pris- matics. It strikes me as not improbable that you - can't see it in that light. Then come with me to the Mackerel camp before Paris, and mark where the antique Brigade is sitting-up with the expiring Confederacy.' Observe how each morning's sun is reflected from the gleaming spectacles of the venerable military organization; while occasional rains make -those same innumerable glasses resemble fairy lakes with dead fish in them. Note with what a respectable air of a relia- ble family physician each patriarchal warrior exhumes, from somewhere down his leg, the massive gold watch which he has been induced to buy for $10 of one of those national benefactors in jewelry who advertise affection- ately in our more parental weekly journals of romance- and remarks, oracularly: "It being exactly three o'clock by this here nineteen- carat repeater, that air Confederacy has got just one hour less to live." The fact, my boy, that this timely observation would apply with about equal accuracy to the whole human fam- ily, need not deter your insidious self from answering in the affirmative, when I ask you, calmly, if it does not seem that a military organization of such intellect, m'ust,be engaged in some unspeakably profound scheme of victory, even though to the uneducated eye it may present some- what the aspect of a muddy old gentleman with his head against a stone-wall? And this business of showing the possible identity of apparent dead-pause with actual velocity, reminds me of e   THRD SERIES.         245 a chap I once knew in the Sixth Ward. He was a cast. iron chap, my boy, whose most powerful conception of enterprise in trade was vividly associated with the duty of being forever in his shirt-sleeves; and he kept a hard- ware shop at which the economical women of America could get such bargains in flat-irons and door-plates, as were a temptation to marry none but the most impover- ished young men. Many customers had this very practical hardware chap, and one of them was an aged file in a broad-brimmed hat, blue spectacles, and a silk umbrella, who had about him that air of Philadelphia which at once suggests an equal admixture of chronic slumber and profundity. Being a widower and a happy man, it was the daily custom of this aged file to spend several hours of intellectual refreshment in the hardware shop, smiling benignantly upon the ancient maidens who came thither to buy curling-tongs, and enlivening the soul of the cast-iron chap with fine, la- borious treatises on the general idiocy of popular percep- tion. "I tell you, my child," this aged file would remark, polishing his spectacles with a red silk handkerchief, -." I tell you, the popular perception wants nicety; wants del- icacy; wants capacity to distinguish between the noisy, bustling style of operation by which it loves to be deceived, - Populus vuit decipi,- and the silent, almost impercep- tible agencies through which all really great results are ac- complished."  Having heard this chaste sentiment repeated daily for about three years, my boy, the very practical hardware chap began to find his nature growing embittered, and re- i  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7327-00000124"/> 246      ORPHEUS C.

So, one morning, after listening quietly to the essay of the aged file, and refusing to tell a small boot-blacking child of six years old the low- est price for one of Jones's Patent steam-ploughs, this cast-iron chap suddenly removed his hands from around an object on the counter, whidh he had, apparently, been attempting to conceal, and revealed to view a boy's lignum- vitae peg-top, which stood seemingly exactly balanced on its steel tip. "Who would think now," said he, reflectively, " that it could be turning all the- time?" The aged file advanced his blue spectacles to the very verge of the top, and says he: "Well, now, it's wonderful, an't it? Any-one would think, to look at that simple toy, that it stood perfectly still ; and yet its velocity of movement must be prodigious. Go into yonder street," exclaimed -the aged file, dropping his umbrella in the excitement of the moment, ;" go into yonder street and bring in any man you please, and that man could swear that this top is not spinning at all. And why? Simply because the velocity of this top, being sev- eral millions of revolutions per minute, is greater than his ignorant eye can comprehend. Upon my soul!" ejacu- lated the aged file, bending once more to the top, with great enthusiasm, " upon my soul! it's wonderful." Over the counter came the hardware chap, with one bound, and says he: "Why, you durned old fool, the top an't moving at all!" And sure enough, the very practical cast-iron chap had just stuck the top up with his hand, in order to bring the popular perception theory of the aged file to grief.   THRD SERIES.        247 Ordinary persons, my boy, 'observing the Mackerel Brigade any time these three years, might think it was not moving at all; but we know its General to be the Top of the heap, and we know that he is making revolu- tions -in the whole art of war.

They could not be ex- pected so soon to forget those elegant family entertain- ments of the olden time, when the hospitable board, with its green covering, groaned under the. weight of gold and silver; when, instead of salads and pates in crockery platters, the plates were of delicately enamelled pasteboard, containing from one to ten diamonds each, or, perhaps, a king or queen served up cold with mint sauce. ;',-  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7327-00000125"/> 248      ORPHEUS C.

And now I emerge-into fountains of satin' and mechn cascades, with numerous citizens of America up to their waists in the surf, and looking about as comfortable as though bathing at Newport in full dress., Yonder stands our Honest Abe, in sombre costume, like a funeral pro- cession standing on end to let something pass under it. Leaning' thoughtfully against the wall, my boy, I was gazing meditatively upon this scene, and thinking how many of these fair beings would be destroyed by railroad accidents on the way to their homes in other cities--I was thinking of this, my boy, when I heard a voice say- ing :            I  "How powerful is human instink! let a fire-bell ring,   THRD SERIES.        249 and at least half of these manly beings would make a bust for the street to join their native fire departmink. Let the hall-bell ring, and nearly all these fair petticoats would involuntarily rush to 'tend the door. Such is human instink." Like one in a dream, I turned me where I stood and be- held the form of Captain Villiam Brown, his left hand upon his hip and his right caressing the neck of a small case-botfle in his bosom. I eyed him pleasantly a mo- ment, and, said I: "Well met, my Union Blucher!" "Ah!" says Villiam, pensively, " how powerful is Hu- man Instink!" "Explain, my Blue and Gold." "Human Instink," says Villiam, softly, " is an invol- untary tendency to our normal condition." AAhem," said I, sagely, " that sounds like Seward." "Come with me," says Villiam, gravely, "and I will show you thepower of Human Instink." He led .me quietly, my boy, to a corner of the great room, where the guests were nearly all males, and sud- denly roared out this extraordinary question: "Say, Johnny-y-y, how's yer do-o-org?" The magical sound caught them unprepared, my boy, and before there was time to remember where they were, they unanimously responded with: "Bully!" "Ah!" says Villiam, ,( that's Instink.

Then it was that Captain Villiam Brown suddenly assumed an air of unspeakable abstrac, tion. and commenced humming the tune of the song: O "Bridget, tend the airy bell, Don't you hear it tinkle? Butcher's brought the bacon home, - Cook it in a twinkle." Without at all thinking or knowing why they were do- ing so, my boy, two-thirds of those fair ones took up the tune at the first note and hummed it through! "The  fair sect," says Villiam, cautiously, " once heard its mother sing that song, as she had learned it in her native palace; and has the Instink to remember it." Thus, taking new and beautiful lessons in the ever-fresh volume of animate nature, we sauntered into the ball- room, where our Honest Abe and his lady were viewing the performances from a pair of handsome elevated chairs. Ay, sir: handsome (!) chairs; and that, too, when many an honest poor man in the land has not a single chair with a gilt back to rest upon. Thus are we drifting toward (start not!)--yes sir and madam, toward--Royalty!! Thus, too, are we incurring the highest scorn of the old aristocracy of the capital who had not received invitations. There was dancing of the ordinary sort in plenty; many solid men of Boston of the oldest age going to the verge of apoplexy in their efforts at double-shuffle ; but how can description do Justice to 'the Honorable Gentleman from   THRD SERIES.        251 the Sixth Ward, who performed the celebrated Conflagra- tion Hornpipe I First, the Honorable Gentleman threw his whole weight upon his left leg, elevated one ear as though intently lis- tening, and tapped distinctly upon the floor with his right heel the number of the district. Then came a confused scuffling, first upon one foot and then upon the other, to represent the hurry and excitement of getting the machine out of the house and whirling her to the scene of the con- flagration. The next figure, performed alternately upon the toe, heel, and side of the shoe, was an imitation of the noble machine in motion; the whole winding up with the Honorable Gentleman's seizing his partner around the waist and plunging into a polka, symbolizing the gallant fireman's rescue of a consuming female from a sixth-story window. This beautiful dance, my boy, was considered an unan- swerable argument in favor of a Volunteer Fire Depart- ment; but its finishing effect was somewhat marred by a piercing note from the famous night-key bugle of the Mackerel Brass Band: who, in an enfeebled state of mind, was found wandering about the palace a trifle intox- icated, and received prompt direction to the apartments of Detective Baker. After witnessing, also, the noted walk-around known as the Revenue Stamp, we joined the march for supper, and I sweetly expressed to Captain Villiam Brown my fear of being crowded from the eatables.

WASHINGTON, D C., March 12th, 1865. Tms sagacious business of writing national military history once a week,y. boy, has at -times presented itself to my mindas a pub]t obligation nearly equal in steady mutual delight to the wholesome occupation of organ-grinding.  Mark the Italian nobleman  who dis- courses mercenary twangs beneath your window, and you shall- find him a person of severe and gloomy vis- age,--a figure with an expression of being weighed down to the very earth by a something heavier than the mere mahogany box of shrieks out of which he grinds popular misery by the  block. Not that he has a distaste for music, my boy; not that he was the less enthusiastic at that past period "when music, heavenly maid, was young " to him; but because the daily recur- rence to his ears of precisely the same sounds for ten years, has a horribly depressing effect of unmitigated sameness; and music has become to him an ancient maiden of exasperating pertinacity. It quite affects me, my boy, when I see one of those melancholy sons of (254) l   THRD SERIES.        255 song carrying a regularly organized monkey around with him; for it is evident he finds in such companions ship a certain relief from the anguish of monotony. Guided by the example, I sometimes get a Brigadier to keep me company also, and you can hardly imagine how often I am saved from gloom  by the amusement I experience in seeing his shrewd imitation of a real soldier. But even this resource may fail; for there are periods when such imitations are very bad indeed; and then the mind of the wearied scribe, like that of my departed friend, the Arkansaw Nightingale, may at any moment expire for want of food. Shall I ever forget the time, my boy, when the Nightingale came to Washington, as President of the Arkansaw Tract Society, for the ex- press purpose of protesting against the war, and procur- ing a fresh glass of the same he had last time? "This war," says he, waiting for it to grow cooler, and thoughtfully contemplating the reflection of himself in the bowl of a spoon,--" this war, if it goes on, wont never shet pan till the hair's rubbed off the hull country, and the 'Merican Eagle wont hev enough feathers in his tail to oil a watch-spring.

Deferring for the present all account of the Mackerel strategy now coming slowly to a head and on foot, let me relate a little incident illustrative of the delicious loyalty of the taper women of America, and the intolerable base- ness of the repulsive'object called man: There is in this city an intensely common-place mas- culine from Pequog, who has, for a wife, a small, plump member of that imperishable sex whose eyes remind me of wild cherries and milk. There never was a nicer little woman, my boy, and she can knit scarlet dogs, play "Norma," make charlotte russe, and do other things equally well calculated to confer immeasurable happiness upon a husband of limited means. Ever since the well- known Southern Confederacy first respectfully requested to be let alone with Sumter, she has been eager to fulfil woman's part in the war, and does not wake up the Pe- quogian more than twice of a night to talk about it. 'Twas at one o'clock on the morning of Tuesday last that she roused up the partner of her joys and sorrows, and says she: "Peter, I do wish you'd tell me what I can do, as a woman, for my country." "Go to sleep," says Peter, fiendishy. "No, but what can I do?  Why wont you tell me what is really woman's part in the war?" "Now, see here," says Peter, sternly. "I'm having so many nights, with the nap all worn off, over this busi-  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7327-00000131"/> 260     ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. ness, that I can't stand it any longer. Just wait till to- morrow evening, and I'll think over the matter and tell you what really is woman's part in the war." So they both went to sleep, my boy, and all next day that little woman wondered, as she hummed pleasantly over her work, whether her lord would advise her, to go out as a Florence Nightingale, or turn teacher of intel- ligent contrabands. Night came, and the Pequogian returned from his grocery store, and silently took a seat before the fire in the dining-room. .The little woman looked up at him from the ottoman on which she was cosily sitting, and says she: "Well, dear?" Slowly and solemnly did that Pequog husband draw off one boot. Deliberately did he take off a stocking and hold it aloft. '"Martha Jane!" says he, gravely, "'tis a sock your eyes behold, and there is a hole in the heel thereof. You are a wife; duty calls you to mend your husband's stockings; and this-- THS- is Woman's Part in the Wore!"

'  WHEREIN [WILL BE FOUND CERTAIN PROFOUND REMARKS UPON THB VARIATIONS OF GOLD, ETC., AND A WHOLESOME LITTLE TALE ILLUSTRATIVE OF THAT FAMOUS POPULAR"ABSTRACTION, THE SOUTHERN TREASURY NOTE. WASHINGTON, D. C., March 22, 1866. THE venerable Aaron, my boy, was the first gold specu- lator mentioned in history, and it exhausted all the states- manship of Moses to break up the unseemly speculation, and bring Hebrew dry goods and provisions down to de- cent prices. Were Aaron alive now, how he would mourn to find his auriferous calf going down at the rate of ten per cent. a!day, while the Moses of the White House re- duced that animal more and more to the standard of very common mutton! Alas, my boy, what madness is this which causes men to forget honor, country, ay, even dinner itself, for un- grateful gold I Like all writers whose object is the moral improvement of their kind, I have a wholesome contempt of gold. What is it? A vulgar-looking yellow metal, with a disagreeable smell. It is filthy lucre. It is dross. It is also 156. Not many months ago I knew    ia high-toned chap of, much neck and chin, who made five hundred thousand dol- lars by supplying our national troops with canned peaches, (261)  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7327-00000132"/> 262      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. and was so inflated with his good luck in the cholera- morbus line, that he actually began to think that his canned peaches had something to' do with the successes in the field of our excellent military organization. Being thus ele- vated, this finely-imaginative chap believed that his services -deserved the mission to France ; and, as that was refused him, it was but natural for him to become at once a South- ern Confederacy in sentiment, and pronounce our Honest Abe a tyrant of defective education. Just before the last election, I met him at the Baltimore railroad depot, and says he: "I have just invested a cool five hundred thousand in gold. It is positively sure," says he, glibly, '" it is positively sure that the reelection of our present despot will send gold straight up to five hundred. I tell you," says he, in a wild ecstasy, " it'll ruin the coun- try, and I shall clear a half million." He was a Jerseyman of fine feelings, and took a little hard cider for his often infirmity. Yesterday I saw that man again, my boy, and I gave him a five-cent note in consideration of his great ability in sweeping a street-crossing. He deserted his canned peach- es, and was cr-r-rushed. JBut what is this manuscript upon my table, as I write? It is a veracious and wholesome little tale of "THE SOUTH.--BY A NORTHER. "'Twas night, deep night, -in the beautiful city of Rich- mond; and the chivalrous Mr. Faro was slowly wending his way through Broad street to the bosom of his Confed- erate family, when, suddenly, he was confronted by a ven- erable figure-in rags, soliciting alms.

"' Moses Faro,' he muttered, in tones of profound agita- tion, 'you have your sheds full ($000000000) of South- ern Bonds, while one poor barrel full ($000) must supply me for a whole day; yet would I not exchange places with a man capable of insulting honest poverty as you have done this night.'

Greatly stricken in conscience, and. heart- ily ashamed of his recent meanness, he turned to the sup- pliant, and said, kindly: "' Give me your address, arid to-morrow morning I will send you a cart full ($000) of means.

' We have succeeded to-day in forcing five more cities through the Yankee lines, and are drag- ing three whole Hessian armies to this city.' "' Then welcome poverty for a while longer,' cried the beggar, pathetically; and so great was his exuberance of spirit at the news, that he resolved to spend five hundred dollars ($500) for a cigar in honor thereof. "Mr. Faro walked thoughtfully on toward his residence, pondering earnestly the words he had listened to, and astonished to find how easily a rich man could give happi- ness to a poor one. After all, thought he, there is more contentment in poverty than in riches.

His wife met him in the hall, and, us they walked together into the parlor, he noticed that her expression was serious. "' Have you heard the latest news, Moses?' she asked. "t' No,' returned the haughty Southerner.

RECORDING THE LATEST DELPHC UTTERANCES OF ONE WHOM WE ALL HONOR WITHOUT KNOWING WHY; AND RECOUNTING THE TRULY MAR- VELLOUS AFFAIR OF THE FORT BUILT ACCORDING TO TACITUS. WASHINGTON, D C., March 29th, 1865. IT is a beautiful trait of our common American nature, my boy, that we should be stood-upon by fleshy Old Age, and find ourselves reduced to the mental condition of mangled infants thereby. It is an airy characteristic of our gentle national temperament, to let shirt-collared Old Age, of much alpaca pants, sit down on us and cough into our ears. It is a part of our social organization as a reverential people to be forever weighed-down in our spirits by the awful respectability of double-chinned Old Age, and the solemn satisfaction it displays at its elephan- tine meals. Hence, my boy, when I tell you that the Venerable Gammon beamed hither from his residential Mugville last Saturday, with a view to benefiting that wayward infant, his country, you   will be prepared to learn that the populace fell upon their unworthy stomachs before him, and respectfully begged him  to walk over their necks. ( My children," said the Venerable Gammon, with a fleshy smile, signifying that he had made them all, and yet didn't wish to seem proud, -"My children, this war (267)  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7327-00000135"/> 268      ORPHEUS C.

Bee hold my old friend, Phoebus," says the Venerable Gam- mon, pointing an adipose forefinger at the sun, with a patriarchal air of having benignantly invented that lumi- nary, though benevolently permitting Providence to have all the credit, " it is not more certain that my warm-hearted friend Phoebus will rise in the yeast to-morrow morning than that the Southern Confederacy will not be capable of fighting a single additional battle after it shall have lost the ability to take part in another engagement." Then the entire populace requested immediate leave to black the boots of their aged benefactor and idol, and seven-and-thirty indefatigable reporters, with pencils be- hind their ears, telegraphed to seven-and-thirty powerful morning journals, that the end of the rebellion might be looked for in about a couple of hours. I don't mind revealing to you, as a curious fact, my boy, that no mortal man is able to understand how the Vener- able Gammon has done anything at all in this war. In fact, I can't exactly perceive what earthly deed he has actually performed to make him preferable to George Washington; but it is generally inferred, from the size of his watch-seals and the lambency of his spectacles, that he has in some way been more than a parent to the coun- try; and the thousands now buying some beneficent Petroleum stock, which he has to sell, are firmly convinced that its sale is positively calculated to forever benefit the human race.   , Oh! that I were Ovid, or Anacreon, to describe fit- tingly the recent little wedding entertainment, at which   THRD SERIES.               / this excellently-aged teacher and preserver of his species was fatly present, diffusing permission for all Mankind to Je happy and not 'mind him. After beaming parentally upon the officiating Mackerel chaplain, with a benignity inseparable from the idea that all clergymen were the work of his hands, he took the dimpled chin of the bride between his thumb and forefinger, and says he: "1 My children, I am an old, old man; but may ye be happy." Here he kissed the bride. . "Yes, my chil- dren," says the venerable Gammon, with a blessing on the world in every tone of his buttery voice, "I am far down in the vale of years; but may ye be very happy." And he kissed the bride. "Still, my children," says the Venerable Gammon, with steaming spectacles, ' I'would be willing to be even older, if my country desired it; but may ye be forever happy." So he kissed the bride. "Oh!" says the Venerable Gammon, abstractedly placing a benefactor's arm around her waist, and looking benevo- -lently about the room as though consenting to its posses- sion of four walls, -"Oh!" says he, " it is a privilege to be old for such a cause as this; but may ye be su- premely happy." At this juncture he kissed the bride. "I am old enough," says the venerable Gammon, " to be your brother." And he kissed every young woman there. Whereupon it was the general impression that an ,.apostle was present; and when the bridegroom subse- quently hinted, in a disagreeable whisper, that two bot- tles of port were enough to confuse the mind of a Methu- selah himself, there was a wonderful unanimity among the ladies as to the probable misery of the bride's future life.

Hire an imaginary horse, my boy, at a fabulous livery-stable, and, in fancy, trot beside me as I urge my architectural steed, the Gothic Pegasus, toward the Mackerel lines in front of Paris. * Believing that you'are 'entirely familiar with the very fat works of C. Tacitus, and minutely remember Book II. of his Annals, let me draw your attention to that fort Aliso which he describes as- being built upon the River Luppia by Drusus, father of Germanicus, and constituting the commencement of a chain of posts to the Rhine. Just such a work has been erected on the shores of Duck Lake by Mackerel genius, as the key to a long line of remarka- ble mud-works. It is modelled after Aliso, chiefly because tat work was notorious for being near the Canal of Dru- sus; and the whole world knows that canal-digging is in- separable from all our national strategy. Fort Bledandide is the name of the Mackerel institution destined to receive immortality in Mr. Tacitus Greeley's exciting History of this distracting war; but to me belongs the earlier privilege of enabling a moral weekly journal to confuse its readers with the first reliable report of the mar- vellous battle of Fort Bledandide. It was at quite an early hour, my boy, on the morning of my arrival before Paris, that a faint sound, as of gen- tlemen firing guns, was heard to proceed from a point some six feet outside Fort Bledandide. Nobody pwas up at the time, save a few venerable Mackerels, who, in daily expectation of some carnage, had selected that hour at which to write their wills; and it was left for these   THRD SERIES.         271 antique beings to be the first of our troops disturbed by a shameless Confederacy who lifted his head slowly above our works, and deliberately aimed a deadly horse-pistol at Jacob Barker, the regimental dog. Hideous was the ex- plosion ensuing, as the night-key with which the dread weapon was loaded went hurtling through the air some ten yards above its mark; and an aged Mackerel looked up from his penmanship. "What!" says he, with some aniimation, " are my spectacles guilty of a falsehood, or have I indeed the pleas- ure of seeing Mr. Davis?" The Confederacy reloaded his horse-pistol with a hand- ful of carpet-tacks, and says he: t"I am that individdle." Raising a bell that stood by his side, the venerable Mack- erel rang a hasty peal, which had the effect to arouse two or three of the other scribes from their writing, and cause them   to apply ear-trumpets to their ears. Simulta- neously the first warrior roared, through a fire-trumpet: "Comrades! We are surprised." At the same instant the Confederacy burst into a tem- pest of unseemly chuckles, and fired his carpet-tacks into the soft hat of the nearest Mackerel, causing that hoary veteran to drop his will and scratch his head with an' air of hopeless bewilderment. "Have you any tea that you could give me?" says the Confederacy, scrambling into the Fort, --" any Hyson senior or junior? Have you any coffee? Oh, do give me some coffee."  Here the Confederacy winked pro- foundly, to indicate that his request was intended merely as a bit of surprising humor. Meantime, six other Con- 12*   &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7327-00000137"/> 272      ORPHEUS C.

But, pause, my feeble pen, ere thou venturest upon the 'hopeless task of putting into language the holy rage of the General of the Mackerel Brigade, when he learned the capture of Fort Bledandide. Pause, miserable quill, ere thou plungest into an insane effort to picture the awful state of vengeance exciting Captain Villiam Brown on the same occasion. As is his invariable custom at such junc- tures, the General at once retired to his tent to practise on the accordion, leaving Villiam to form a few regiments of the Mackerel reserve in line of battle for the recapture of the position, ' Ah!" says Villiam, spiritedly, " here's a chance for a baynit charge after the manner of Napoleon's Old Guard; and I hereby notify Regiment 5, that the eyes of the whole world are upon them."

"If any of you martial beings happen to have any small change about you at this exciting moment,' says Villiam, paternally, "I will take charge of it, for safety." This noble proposition, my boy, might have been ac- cepted unanimously, had not the discharge, at that in- stant, of a horse-pistol from the ramparts of Fort Bledan- dide caused the entire regiment to partially disappear! That is to say, every man went down upon his stomach, according to the latest principles of regimental strategy. "Ah!" says Villiam, " how are the mighty fallen I " Loudly rang a tremendous horse-laugh from the Coii- federacies in the Fort, several of whom were seen making off toward Paris with Orange County howitzers under each arm. .I could see, by the aid of my smoked glass, that the Chivalry on the ramparts was sitting on a chest, with his discharged horse-pistol across his knee, and a series of feeble winks chasing each other around his Con- federate eyelids. "By all that's Federal!" says Captain Bob Shorty, "the scorpion surrenders!" At the word, up sprang Regiment 5, like the men of Roderick Dhu, and straightforward they swept into Fort Bledandide, as a 'wave of the angry sea will sometimes sweep into a doomed barrel on the beach. Such was the shock of this dare-devil charge, that the winking Con- federacy on the ramparts incontinently rolled off his chest and was captured without much carnage. &amp;*            &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7327-00000138"/> 274     ORPHEUS C.

'  "By all that's Federal!" says Captain Bob Shorty, "he's been drinking some of that air Commissary whis- key of ours." Then, my boy, did Captain Villiam Brown evidence that exquisite quality of our humanity, which bids us forget all wrongs and enmities at the eloquent appeal of death. No sooner had Captain- Bob Shorty made the above re- mark, than his whole aspect changed to pity, and he feel- ingly knelt beside the miserable captive. "t "Have you any last request to make, poor inseck?" asked Villiam, much affected. The misguided Confederacy was speechless; but made an attempt to scratch his breast. "Ah!" says Villiam, with deep emotion, " you mean that your conscience is a still small woice." Here the Confederacy scratched his left leg feebly; and says Captain Bob Shorty: "According to your rule, Villiam, his conscience must be quite large, extending to his legs." Nervously arose Captain Villiam Brown to his feet, with such a shudder running through his manly frame as caused every brass button to jingle. "I think," says Villiam, with a ghastly smile, 4 that some of his conscience is a-walking softly down my back- bone, with a hop now and then." .  Alas! my boy, we all have consciences, save green   THRD SERIES.        275 grocers and fashionable bootmakers; and who among us but has felt his conscience to be at times almost totally disregarded, until it has finally brought him to the scratch by turning to flee?

KERR PAPERS. Kno w, then, my boy, that the chant is to celebrate the conquest of the ancient City of Paris, which, for many years past, has actually waxed prosperous against Mackerel strategy, but now rests a prize beneath that glorious bunt- ing which we all like to see our poor relations die for: beneath that ensign of freedom for which every man of us would willingly sacrifice his life, did he not feel that his first great duty was to his helpless family, who like to have him stay at home' and take them to the opera. O my country!-- sublime in thy wounds, chivalrous in thy triumph, more than royal in the k'ingless magnificence of thine undaunted power;-  forget not the patriots who have stayed at home on account of their families; for surely such a disinterested- and general demonstration of domestic virtue seems to indicate that our police force is uselessly large. Let me not, however, waste time in national boasting, while the crowning result of consummate Mackerel strat- egy demands- of me that narrating exercise of the pen without which even brigadiers might fail to receive public credit for deeds after the manner of Napoleon. Retrace, my boy, to the happy days of your youth, and you may   remember that I once described the ancient city of Paris as a  house founded upon a bar-room and surrounded by warlike settlements of Confederacies. Here were collected all the lemons, glassware, sugar, spoons, and cloves of the sunny South; and-though all else were lost--while these remained to them, the Confederacies were still unbroken in spirits and only spoke of Columbia to observe: "  She may attack our chivalrous banner of Stars and Bars, and capture all the stars if she pleases,;   THRD SERIES.        279 but while our Bars remain, we shall still be able to liquor." Therefore it is, that the aged and aristocratic' city of Paris has stubbornly brought to grief so many of our admirable brass-buttoned generals, several of whom are now enjoying that unblemished obscurity which ungrate- fiul republics are apt to bestow upon unappreciated great ness. On the day succeeding the sanguinary affair of Fort Bledandide, my boy, while notes of busy preparation were rising from all parts of the Mackerel camp, one of our pickets was awakened by the sound of many eques- trians riding over his body, and immediately put on his spectacles to discern whether they were friends or foes. The inspection lasted until one skeleton charger had stepped upon his canteen ; whereupon the Mackerel picket discovered that the new-comers were the Anatomical cav- alry, under Captain Samyule Sa-mith, just returned from operations in Confederate railway stock, which they had raised so far above par as to give it a very decided mar. Proudly rode Samyule at the head of his triumphant bone-works, and the jingle of their spurs and sabres was like unto the collision of many tin paps. Gayly rode they to headquarters, and, says Samyule, "Sire, we have in- terrupted the railway travel of the Southern Confederacy for the season; and obliterated the tracks of treason, that it may no longer rail against us. Further depot-nent saith not." The General of the Mackerel Brigade laid aside his accordion, and says he: "My sons, I would that every earthly foe to our dis- tracted banner could at this moment be placed on board a  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7327-00000141"/> 280      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. railway train in any part of this country. Because, says the General, thoughtfully, " a ride on an American railway train of cars is foreordained car-nage." After this speech, my boy, it was generally allowed that the Mackerel commander was even with Samyule; and as the Anatomical Cavalry swept off to the left to flank the unseemly Confederacies defending Paris, the main body of the venerable brigade, under Captain Villiam Brown and Captain Bob Shorty, commenced strategical designs on that city. Thus early in the engagement a bloodthirsty Confed- eracy had succeeded in training a fowling-piece from be- hind a chimney on the roof of Paris, greatly worrying our troops with dried beans, and the Orange County Howit- zers were already concentrated upon him with a view to cutting off his legs; when there suddenly appeared within our' lines a maiden, stricken in years, 'with a white plush bonnet, a green silk umbrella, and the ninety-ninth num- ber of the History of this War under one arm. She waved a hand toward the Mackerels nearest her, and says she: '6 On, to Paris! On, to Paris! ox a decimated and in- dignant country, acting on the predictions in the ninety- ninth number of the most accurate History of the War now sold to subscribers only, will indignantly demand that EVERYBODY be at once removed!"

On, to Paris! or - At this juncture, myscoy, the aged Miriam caught sight of the Conservative Kentucky Chap, haranguing against her down the Accoinac road, and toddled furiously away to chastise him with her. umbrella. Meanwhile, the Orange County Howitzers had sent some pounds of shrapnel in the direction of the hostile Confederacy on the roof; and as the bricks began to fly from the chimney, and the dried beans came at longer in- tervals, Regiment 5 of the Mackerel Brigade moved nearer to the beleaguered capital, and opened an effective fire of musketry upon the azure zenith. Captain Vil- liam Brown was about to order an assault, when certain windows in the uipper stories of Paris were thrown up, and there rained therefrom such a hurtling tempest of stew-pans, hearth-brushes, shaving-cups, and boxes of blacking, that hundreds of Mackerel spectacles were broken. Simultaneously the sanguinary Confederacy on the roof put a double charge of dried beans through the coat-tails of Captain Bob Shorty, and our troops-" the object of the reconnoissance beingfully accomplislied "- withdrew in good order to their former position. Quickly, thereupon, appeared a canvas banner from the  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7327-00000142"/> 282      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. garret windows of Paris, inscribed: "Chalk up the First Round for the Southern Confederacy!" and the first day's fight-was over.  All that night, my boy, did the venerable Mackerel Brigade lay upon their arms, finding all their hands asleep, in consequence, when morning broke ; and as often as a venturesome Confederacy skulked near Fort Bled- andide to steal a cannon, just so often did one Mackerel picket nudge another Mackerel picket and ask him if he didn't think he heard something. I At last there came a gradual hush over everything, as though the whole world were an antechamber to a room in which rested some dear sick child. Then the sharp edges of this terrestrial bowl in which we hang over the sun at night began to define themselves all around, as though an early candle had just been brought underneath to light the fire. And at last a slowly-deepening lurid glow appeared around the sides of the bowl, as though the fire was just getting a start. It was morning. Fearful that if I go on in that strain any longer, some sentimental Philadelphian may carry me off by main force to write for the "Lady's Book," let me call your notice to the extreme left of the Mackerel line, where Captain Samyule Sa-mitlt and the Anatomical Cavalry, supported by Sergeant O'Pake and Regiment 3, were formed in line of battle, facing certain rickety Confederacies under Cap- tain Munchausen. "Comrades," says Samyule, vainly attempting tc keep the hind-legs of his anatomical steed from trying to sur- round the two fore-legs -\" comrades, one blow, and Syra- cuse is free! For-r-ward!"   THRD SERIES.        283 But what is this, starting up, as from the ground, right in the path of what else had been the most exorbitant cavalry charge on record? It is the aged Miss P. Hen, with her white plush bonnet much mashed from a recent severe single combat with the Conservative Kentucky Chap, and the ninety-ninth number of the History of the War still unsold. She ate a Graham biscuit, and says she: "Just once - I only wantto say just once, that every- body is a-howling at me like wolves, and abusing me, be- cause I said ' On to Paris.' So I want to say, just once, that I never, never will say one word about the war again, no matter how much you want me to. Now there's no use of your asking me, because I never, never will!" And she hoisted her green silk umbrella and stalked grimly from the field, like the horrid apparition of a ner- vous widower's dream. "Really," says Samyule, irritably, "I don't think there's any other country where old women would be allowed on the field of battle without epaulets on their shoulders. But let us proceed with the war," says Samyule, earnest- ly, " or we shall not get through in time for our coming conflict with combined Europe."

"Let me get at you, foul Hessian!" roared the hairy Munchausen, with his horse hopping sideways in every direction. "Die in thy sins!" shouted the excited Samyule, tak- ing a slide toward his charger's ears, as that spirited ani- mal ecstatically waved his hinder feet in the air. "Coward, thou would'st fly me!" ejaculated Munchau- sen, just as his Arabian got a-straddle of a caisson. - You are my prisoner!" thundered Samyule, endeav- oring to restrain his blooded courser from climbing a tree near by. "Beg for your life!" howled Munchausen, frantically clasping his arms about the neck of his Hambletonian colt as they went skipping against an ambulance together. 4"Say thy last prayer!" yelled Samyule, backing fren- ziedly into the middle of the Christian Commission. "This to thy heart!" screamed Munchausen, disap- pearing in a ditch. "Victory!" ejaculated Samyule, rolling down a hill. And the second day's fighting was ended. Night again upon the battle-field. The wearied soldier, as he seeks a few hours of repose upon the damp and dreary ground, wonders what the people of' the great patriotic cities will think of the battle of the day; whether they are indeed unspeakably proud and fond of the men perilling and losing their lives that the nation may live?

Far to the left, with -his eyes blazing like the ends of two cigars, and his nose glowing like a transparent strawherry, Captain Samyule Sa-mith got himself and his celebrated horse-marines so ingeniously entangled and mixed up with Captain Munchausen's and everybody "else's command, that the Schleswig-Holstein question was a very ordinary conundrum in comparison, and the fight in that part of the field bade fair to last for a few years without much definite carnage. ( Then, again, on the calm waters of Duck Lake (now too deep for wading in consequence of recent rains), that hoary old salt, Rear Admiral Head, unhooked his famous flagship, the "Shockinghadhat," and set out with his im- proved swivel-gun and agile Mackerel crew to take a hand in the carnival of conquest. "Loosen my plates!" swore the aged son of Neptune in his iron-clad manner, as he adjusted his spectacles and extracted a slow-match from one corner of his snuff-box, - "Loosen my plates! but the navy must kill a few Confed- erate insects, - bark my turret, if it mustn't." It was really beautiful, my boy, to see an iron-clad tar of such great age light the slow-match with his own meerschaum, and aim the improved artillery directly at the reat-elevation of a Confederacy tying his shoe in one of the side windows of Paris.

Not to sicken you, myboy, with too much of such heart- rending slaughter, let me say that a dense cloud of sul- phurous smoke soon entirely veiled the doomed City of Paris, into which the strategical Mackerels continued for hours to pour such torrents of lead as no number of win- dows could stand. Finally, as night approached, a person of black extraction, with wool on the brain, emerged from the cloud quite close to Villiam, and says he: "De place hab surrender, sah." "Ah!" says Villiam, pulling out his ruffles, I' is the conflick too much for the scorpions?" The faithful black arranged a silver cake-basket more firmly under his coat, and says he: "Dey's all gone over Jordan."

Our distracted banner, too, was just being raised triumphantly upon the roof, when there sud- denly emerged, from  the shadow of the rear-guard, Miss P.

LooK, my boy upon the east wall of my luxurious presence-chamber, and mark how I have maliciously pasted thereon a map of besotted Europe; with all its capitals, rivers, mountains, and inland puddles laid down with an accuracy and multitudinosity to forever enlighten and utterly confound every sniffing little schoolboy-geog- rapher in the land.

Nothing was ever equal to the peaceful unity of the male and female O'Korrigan; and did Michael find it neces.- sary, in the course of some friendly discussion with a neighbor on the stairs, to call for a hatchet till he broke the ugly nose of the spalpeen, it was the wife of his bosom that handed him  his own bit of a stick, and joined in the argument herself with a poker for a referee. But nothing's perfect in this world except the wisdom of owls and Congressmen, and Mrs. O'Korrigan's military virtues and wholesome-command 'of her husband had the slight drawhack of a constitutional taste for poteen. Michael expostulated with her by the hair, and remonstrated with her by the shoulders, and plead with her over the head; but all to no purpose; and .he was greatly assisted and comforted by a bit of a preacher named Father O'Tod, who took care of everybody's virtue except his own.

"And when I'm afther takin' a drop for the good of mel health," says she, ' I don't bother any one," says she; " but stay shut up in my own room," says she, " and only ask to be let alone," says she. Now it chanced that Mr. O'Korrigan, being invited by Father O'Tod, and especially aggrieved by having one of his best Sunday shoes coolly appropriated as a sort of fan- ciful leathern case for the aforesaid black bottle, fi- nally resolved to at least recapture his property, and, mayhap, spill the poteen. So he placed the hair of his head in Mrs. O'Korrigan's left hand, and scraped his nose against the nails of her right, and was enjoying himself very much, when Father O'Tod came in, and "Michael agrah," says he, " it's spaichless with horrors I am," says he, " to see ye brawling with yer own wife," says he, " and she a woman,"*says he. i "The marcy of Heaven on me!" says Mike, says he; "but isn't it yer own self," says he, " that's been advisin' me by the year," says he, " to stop her poteen?" says he. "It's not the desthruction of the poteen yer after at all," says Father O'Tod, says he; " but only to wrinch from her," says he, "'an owld brogan," says he, "that ye'd be as well without," says he. Just at this moment Mr. O'Korrigan managed to get possession of the brogan referred to, and was commencing to use it most potently as an instrument of wholesome matrimonial correction, when the scuffle displaced the un - fortunate black bottle from the pocket of Mrs; O'Korri- gan, and it fell to the floor and - broke into fifty pieces. "It's accident that did that," says Father O'Tod, says  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7327-00000147"/> 292      ORPHEUS C.-KERR PAPERS. he, " and not yerself at all, Michael O'Korrigan," says he; " and it's not myself," says he, "that'll give aither of ye pardon," says he. "But I'm l'anin' to Ailey," says he, " and it's masses I'll say for her," says he,-" if she's bate to death," says he. "Ailev, avourneen," says Mike, says he, " the bottle's broke," says he, " and I've got me brogan," says he, and ye may keep the rest," says he, " if ye'll make up," says he. "Michael, darlint," says she, "ye can place yer big mout' in the middle of me faychures," says she; "but as for Father O'Tod," says she, " it's achin' I am to comb his hypocritical hair," says she, " with a poker," says she. "Alley, me angel," says Mike, says he, " it'll be show- in' our gratitude to Saint Payter," says he, "that we an't both kilt intirely," says he, "lavin' aich other or- phans," says he, "if we  just slather the owld humbug together," says he. So they both fell upon lFather O'Tod with a heartiness not to be described, and that excellent, and neutral old gentleman was much mussed in his linen. Farbe it from me, my boy, to say that combined Eu- rope, and especially the step-mother country, is at all like Father O'Tod, or that Slavery in the remotest degree re- sembles a  small black bottle-;, but interference in the quar- rels -of married folks is apt to excite the liveliest enmity of both parties, and two-against-one has been known to result quite spiritedly therefrom. Therefore, let the skiptail of Europe beware! for even I, an humble historian and no warrior, am filled with that ipmt of defiance to everything across the Atlantic which   THRD SERIES.        293 might serve to inspire a brigadier, the 'editor of an able morning journal, a fierce turkey-cock, or any other type of matchless valor. Ohe week ago, this American breast of mine was wild for the immediate redemption of lovely Ireland, by reason of the marvellous and' triumphant cap- ture of Paris by the thrice-valiant Mackerel Brigade; and to-day such an accession of national triumph stares all through the columns of our more stentorian morning jour- nals, that I demand the immediate disenthrallment from foreign tyrants of Hungary, Poland, Venetia, Mexico, Canada, Jersey City, and the Guano Islands. Munchausen, my boy, has surrendered! That mirror of chivalry and hollow-eyed wanderer in a forest of whis- kers has yielded to his noble desire for a piece - of some- thing to eat, and gracefully permitted himself and his command to be wooed from their guiding star, -starva- tion. Immediately after the unprecedented battle for Paris; and while yet the agitated Miss P. Hen and divers enterpris- ing political chaps who had followed our troops were or- ganizing a Republican caucus in the bar-room of the captured capital, the unconquerable  Mackerel Brigade pushed. on after the unseemly Confederacies, with a view to further carnage. Not a stump of a tree was seen but it was at once taken for Mr. Davis himself, and had the direful Orange County Howitzers concentrated upon it; yet such- dangers did not deter our venerable Mackerel boys from their assigned pursuit, and ere long their glit- tering spectacles surrounded a goodly swamp, wherein were perceptible the caitiff Confederacies up to their chins in the sacred soil. With only their heads above the mud,  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7327-00000148"/> 294      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. these sons of chivalry looked: not unlike a vast cabbage. patch romantically viewed by twilight; while far up the vegetable vista glowed the eyes of Captain Munchausen, like those of an irascible Thomas cat who sees a dog down the lane.  Pitching his tent in a spot where no vagrant stone could reach it, the General of the Mackerel Brigade took off his coat and vest, rolled up the legs of his inexpressibles, and commenced the following CORRESPONDENCE. MUNCHAUSEN, Southern Confederacy : "SIR, -The result of the last strategical combat between us must convince you of the hopelessness of further mili- tary confusion in this country. I feel that it is so, and consider it my duty to shift from myself the responsibility of further carnage by asking of you the surrender of that portion of the sunny South- known as the Southern Con- federacy. "THE GENERAL OF THE MACKEREL BRIGADE.  ("Green Seal.") You may observe, my   boy, that the remark: -"I feel that it is so," does not make the strongest kind of connec- tion with the preceding sentence;. but great warriors are apt to be shaky in their rhetoric; and the Confederacy responded thus: . " GEN. MACK. BRIG. : "SIRRAH, -Though repelling with scorn the vandal insinuation that further military confusion on my part is     THRD SERIES.        295 hopeless, I agree with you as to the stoppage of further carnage, and desire to know upon what terms you will haul the celebrated Southern Confederacy out of this swamp. "MUNCHAUSEN X his mark." (This chivalrous manner of signing a name with a Cross is a knightly expression of profound piety, descended from the ancient crusaders to the Southern chivalry of the pres- ent day.) To the above epistle the General thus replied : "MUNCHAUSEN, Southern Confederacy,  SIR, - i propose to receive the surrender of the well- known Southern Confederacy on the following terms: "Fresh rolls for all the officers and men to be made at once, and the boots of the Southern Confederacy to be blacked by officers duly appointed by the United States of America. All the officers to give their individual pay rolls, that they may be cashed by the United States. Such public and private property as has been stolen by the well- known Southern Confederacy to be turned over to the po- lice-officers appointed to take charge of it. t"Each officer will be permitted to retain both of his arms, and, together with the men, is expected to return calmly to his family, and&amp; not commit assault upon the United States of America without due provocation. THE GENERAL orF THE MACKEREL BRIGADE. ("Green Seal.") Itis related in tradition, that when the knightly Mun- 13*   &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7327-00000149"/> 296      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. chausen received this epistle, he laughed horribly for the space of at least half an hour, as though greatly rejoiced at a bit of unparalleled waggishness. After which he deliv- ered himself of four sinister winks at nothing, simultane- ously exclaiming: "By Chivalry! here's magnanimity." After which he wrote thus: "GEN. MACK. BRIG.: ;"SIRRAH, - I have received your scrawl of this date, * containing what may .be denominated terms of first-class board for the celebrated Southern Confederacy. Inasmuch as said terms give me rather more advantage than half a dozen strategical victories over your vandals could possibly have procured for us, I hereby permit you to capture us at once, in order to avoid further carnage in your ranks. "MUCHAUSEN X   his mark." Other letters incidental to this business passed .between the two  paladins, my boy; but as the letters of all great men are proverbial for their great dignity and heaviness, and ate immensely calculated to incline readers to untimely repose, I have spared you the infliction. Suffice it to say, that when Captain Villiam Brown read the 'Mackerel terms of surrender, he spasmodically applied his lips to a canteen, with. the air of one who takes poison because the butcher's daughter has refused to be won by his manly shape. "Ah!" says Villiam, " such magnanimity I " Captain Bob Shorty was playing Old Sledge with three members of the Sanitary Commission when the document arrived.   THRD SERIES.        297 "By all that's Federal!" says Captain Bob Shlorty, '6 it appears to me -it really appears to me, Villiam, that I never see so much magnanimity!" They took it to Captain Samyule Sa-mith as he sat by the roadside, straightening his highly-tempered sabre with a stone. "I cannot always agree entirely with my brother offi- cers on all points," says Samyule, reflectively, " for some of them are ineddicated: but I find in this document great magnanimity!" -Magnanimity, my boy, is the revenge of generous minds; as the venerable male parent feelingly observed when he made over his whole property to the interesting son who had just tried to poison him by putting arsenic into his coffee, and expressed an intention to burn him to death in his bed that night. The glorious news of the surrender had no sooner reached the city of Paris than the aged and gifted Miss P. Hen organized an enthusiastic mass meeting of the de- crepit Union element, and a speaker's stand was quickly erected, over which floated a banner inscribed FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1869, COLORADO  JE WETT. The meeting being called to order, Miss P. Hen came to tho front with her umbrella, and addressed the populace.  -  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7327-00000150"/> 298      ORPHEUS C. KERR"PAPERS. She stated Chat this meeting was designed for no polit-e ical purpose, but only to show Providence that a great nation knows how to be grateful for victory. Now was the time to heed the heart-sobs and gushing soul-pangs of the misguided Confederacies, and receive back all the Rebel leaders with kisses on their penitent noses., As for our present President, he meant well; but"- The speaker was suddenly interrupted by a burst of fifes and drums coming up the Accomac road, and right quickly there appeared a procession of political chaps with immense stomachs, from Chicago, who carried a fine banner inscribed: REPUBLICAN NOMNATION    t FOR PRESIDENT     IN  1869,  i THE GENERAL OF THE MACKEREL BRIGADE. j At this apparition Miss P. Hen ate a Graham biscuit with great accerbity of bearing, and was about to go on with her Te Dewnm, when a fleshy Chicago chap lightly jumped upon the platform and pushed the venerable maid- en aside. He said that no scheme  of politics brought them together- this time: but a humble, heartfelt wish to thank a benignant Heaven for the downfall of a mighty people's enemies. As for the chief of those enemies, the Rebel leaders, they must every one of them be hanged without mercy, or justice might as well be ignored forever. The present President was too "- At this moment the -hum of an approaching multitude drowned all other sounds, and there advanced from the   THRD SERIES.          299 rear of Paris a great band of high-moral citizens, with a banner announcing UNION NOMNATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1869. OUR UNCLE' ABE.** Forward surged this new audience toward the platform, and both Miss P: Hen and the Chicago chap had recom- menced their hymns of gratitude, when an athletic citizen from'Baltimore made a dash. for the front railing and elo- quently addressed the meeting. Hie was proud to see such a glorious concourse assembled, for no wrangling party object, but solely to unite in thankfulness to a greater than all earthly powers for the blessing of returning peace. To make that peace permanent and solid,"- Here Miss P. Hen got to the front and brought down her umbrella with awful violence upon the bare head of the speaker, and says she: "I'm the Republican party myself!" "I beg your pardon, miss,"- says the Baltimore citizen, hotly, " but I'm the Republican party!"  "'You're both impostors!"   roared the Chicago chap, scientifically squaring-off; "for I'M the Republican party!"  Crash goes the platform; down tumble the banners. * Four days after the date of this letter, ABRAHAM LINCOLN - the wise, the just, the merciful - fell beneath the dastard blow of an ignoble assassin! All that is beautiful and good in the world must mourn his irreparable loss; and I need not say how consoling it is to me in this dark hour to feel, that, in all my extravagances of nonsense, I have never penned one word concerning the Martyr-President that was not inspired by a sentiment of actual affection for his genial and guileless character. Thank God! his eternally-infamous murderer came of a line not native to my country!  o. C. BK.  &#xD;<pb n="300-301 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7327-00000151"/> i 300      ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. Fists are plunging wildly in all directions, while such howls and screams arise from the tempest as though pande- monium were let loose to run a gamut of diabolical sounds. Seated upon a barrel a short distance off, I was taking a deep interest, through my bit of smoked glass, in this scene of exciting National Thanksgiving, when a strange ringing noise, or lively bellow, and a sharp crash very  unexpectedly sounded above the din, and, on looking up, I beheld the Conservative Kentucky chap joyously danc- ing upon the roof of Paris, with a huge-dinner-bell in his right hand) and a smoking three-pounder beside him. "4 Hooray!' shouted the Conservative Kentucky chap, blissfully standing on one leg. "Go in! That's the style I Sic 'em! Sic 'em! Hit 'em again, boys. Hem " says the Conservative chap, with delirious enthusiasm; this here sort of thing in the enemy's camp is just the ticket for our National Democratic Organization, of which I am the large Kentucky branch!" Turn away your eyes, my boy, from such scenes as these, and look with me along that hill-side yonder, where the gentle sun casts his tenderest beams upon the new spring grass. You see there are irregular mounds scat- tered all the way up the slope, - hundreds, - hundreds! Beneath them sleep the brave,- the beautiful, the wept of the patriot home. Their loyal blood&amp;, poured in a fervid river to the twilight ocean of Eternity, has washed,a pol- lution from our Flag, a blot from our escutcheon; and, oh!
