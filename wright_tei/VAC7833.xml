THE SMUGGLER'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
A FEW weeks since business caused&#xD;
ny attendance at the admiralty. While&#xD;
waiting in one of the anti-rooms, I heard&#xD;
myself accosted by name by a tall. and&#xD;
elegant looking man standing neir me.-&#xD;
'My eye rested on his figure, but memory&#xD;
refused recognition in the gaze. I in-&#xD;
quired his identity. My surprise was&#xD;
great at finding he was one of my dear-&#xD;
est and earliest friends; and the start of&#xD;
astonishment, almost-of pain, which his&#xD;
revelation elicited from e, must have&#xD;
communicated to him t e knowledge of&#xD;
the withering havoc 1 ich sorrow had&#xD;
made on his person. Only five years&#xD;
had elapsed since o r last meeting, and&#xD;
that period, when  nmarked by mentalI&#xD;
suffering or sicknes , may pass over man&#xD;
while in his prime- nd Capt. Tancred&#xD;
was now only thirty-fiv -without leav&#xD;
ing a record of its flight.&#xD;
I had known him in boyhood: he had&#xD;
been my wildest, but the truest and most&#xD;
generous of my school companions. His&#xD;
presence had ever been the signal for&#xD;
some thoughtless freak or hazardous ad-&#xD;
venture. With a spirit fresh and buoy-&#xD;
ant as the mountain air, exuberant health,&#xD;
and exhaustless vivacity, he was formed to&#xD;
be the idol of his associates. He seemed&#xD;
destined for happiness; he had every el-&#xD;
ement of it in himself: and utterly ex- I&#xD;
empt from that contracting selfishness&#xD;
which binds up the sympathies of too E&#xD;
many natures, he revelled in the joy oft&#xD;
dispensing it to others. Left to the choice&#xD;
of a profession, he selected that of the'&#xD;
sea: it assimilated'best with his taste,&#xD;
for it afforded indulgence to his peculiarly&#xD;
&#xD;
temperament, which, always seeking af-&#xD;
ter strong excitements, would even court&#xD;
danger in all its varieties. The very char-&#xD;
acter of the element had charms for him r&#xD;
he loved -its false unsubstantial surface,&#xD;
its engulphing depths, its perilous quick-&#xD;
sands, the warfare of its waves, whose&#xD;
wild hoarse murmurs seem to warn man&#xD;
from their territories ; they had terror in&#xD;
their sound, and that sound was music to&#xD;
his ears. Often when the tempest from&#xD;
above had-lashed theocean into fury,&#xD;
and it boiled forth its wrath in billows&#xD;
which threatened destruction to aught of&#xD;
human power that dared its ire, I have&#xD;
known him singly to embark in a little&#xD;
boat, in assertion, as he would say, of&#xD;
man's prerogatives, and to trample on the&#xD;
enemy which seemed to oppose his free&#xD;
agency over nature and her works.&#xD;
At the termination of our maritime&#xD;
struggles, finding his very soul enervated&#xD;
at the prospect of indolent peace, he ob-&#xD;
tained command of a revenue cutter, and&#xD;
I parted with him in the full glow of&#xD;
health, on his departure for the coast of&#xD;
Norfolk, to enter on his new service. En-&#xD;
gaged in active pursuits, I had little op-&#xD;

10                    The Smuggler's .Daughter.&#xD;
&#xD;
cents had now a mournful and drear&#xD;
cadence, like the responses of a rifte&#xD;
cavern, and they were the echoes of&#xD;
bare and shivered heart. There wa&#xD;
still about him the exquisite polish of-de&#xD;
meanor so often instinctive with hig]&#xD;
birth-for Tancred was nobly connected&#xD;
--which had always distinguished him&#xD;
but the lofty bearing, the unquailing eye&#xD;
the sunny smile, was gone for ever! A&#xD;
an interview which I afterwards had with&#xD;
him, he disclosed to me the events which&#xD;
had produced such a metamorphosis in&#xD;
his aspect and manner. The substance(&#xD;
wais as follows-&#xD;
The signal station which Captain Tan&#xD;
cred commanded was situated, as I have&#xD;
said, on the coast of Norfolk. It was&#xD;
near a remote hamlet, and partook, in an&#xD;
eminent degree, of that dulness and in-&#xD;
sipidity which so often distinguishes a&#xD;
country village. The scenery was not&#xD;
of that elevated and picturesque charac-&#xD;
ter, which, in many parts of England,&#xD;
rivalling in loveliness and grandeur the&#xD;
landscapes of Italy or Switzerland, might&#xD;
well content a people less migratory than&#xD;
ourselves, with the native samples it dis-&#xD;
plays of nature's power.  W      had&#xD;
none of this; the painter or the poet&#xD;
might have looked' on it without the&#xD;
faintest glow of that kindling enthusiasm&#xD;
which rushes from the heart and thrills&#xD;
through the frame, at the sight (f beauty,'&#xD;
in whatever guise displayed, uninstruct-&#xD;
ed, unaltered, by the sophistications of&#xD;
art--fresh, luxuriant, and perfect, the vis-&#xD;
ible and tangible evidence of that uner-&#xD;
ring system of harmony and arrangement,&#xD;
by which the Divine Ruler conducts the&#xD;
universe. The inhabitants, too, of W---&#xD;
were generally uncultivated and illiterate.&#xD;
Education had there been tardy in its civ-&#xD;
ilizing influence; and there was amongst&#xD;
the lower classes--the mass of the popu-&#xD;
lation.---little of that amenity of feeling&#xD;
and manner which may in some measure&#xD;
atone for the absence of -the higher mental&#xD;
qualities. The service in which Capt.&#xD;
'Tancred was engaged drew an almost&#xD;
entire line of demarkation between him-j&#xD;
self and his neighbors. H-e met them,1&#xD;
and perchance the bow and courtesy of&#xD;
compelled deference were accorded; but1&#xD;

the individual of the danger of her situ- lose its look of boundless radiance; while&#xD;
ation, or curiosity to discover who was a glance of deep, mournful, and passion-&#xD;
the lonely wanderer--or gallantry, as that ate feeling, would beam from its azure&#xD;
wanderer bore the outline of a female, depths, aind the dark silken fringe which&#xD;
which led him hastily forward to offer shrouded its glory become gemmed with&#xD;
protection. It was declined by the young the tears of silent sorrow.&#xD;
and lovely girl to whom it was proffered,  Tancred often interrogated her as to&#xD;
with such bewitching yet shrinking ti- the cause of her unavowed grief. To            (&#xD;
midity, such trembling apprehensiveness, imagine it the result of personal miscon-&#xD;
that his interest was far more, powerfully duct was incompatible with the angelic&#xD;
awakened by her refusal, thaq if she 'had purity which so peculiarly distinguished&#xD;
acceded to his request. Casual and slight, her, and which, even more, perhaps, than'&#xD;
however, as this introduction to each oth- her extreme loveliness, captivated hisim-&#xD;
er may seem, it formed the basis of a agination and enthralled his heart. Of&#xD;
permanent acquaintance. It is unneces- her relations and friends she spoke little.&#xD;
sary for me to trace its progress, or to She talked indeed of her father, but it  ,&#xD;
follow it through all its graduations, was evident that feai' and awe were blend-&#xD;
while.germinating into friendship, till it ed with filial love and duty. That she&#xD;
arrived at the maturity of love. The moved in the lower walks of life, her ap-&#xD;
developement of a passion, which in- pearance indicated, though in her conver-&#xD;
volves the whole sum of earthly happi- sation, and in the soft and gentle repose&#xD;
ness of two individuals-which embraces of her manner, there was not discovered&#xD;
in its issue anguish or bliss to them, the slightest taint of vulgarity. Theymet&#xD;
.here and hereafter, may yet be too defi- but seldom, and each time with the re-&#xD;
cient in striking peculiarity of incident to solve on Helen's lips of parting forever !&#xD;
engage the sympathies of other's. To a' But who shall tell the struggle it requires&#xD;
certain point this was the case in the at- voluntarily to separate from a being most&#xD;
tachment of Capt. Tancred and Helen, dear to us? Policy and prudence-&#xD;
for so was his idol called. There was a worldly wisdom may bid us ha--st the&#xD;
mystery about her, which she seemed fetters which enchain our souls; but&#xD;
most unwilling to account for or unravel, when those fetters are, at the same time,&#xD;
&#xD;
y there was 'neither glance, nor tone, nor&#xD;
d word of sympathy exchanged. He was&#xD;
a looked upon, by even those who stood&#xD;
s unconnected with the illicit' traffic which&#xD;
it devolved on him to oppose, with&#xD;
h distrust and suspicion. He was one of&#xD;
d those men, however, whose activity and&#xD;
healthiness of temperament supply to&#xD;
, themselves the deficiencies of place and&#xD;
t people. Still there were moments when&#xD;
his customary employment failed of&#xD;
amusement, when even his own beloved&#xD;
'element was gazed upon with an eye of&#xD;
listlessness and dissatisfaction, when he&#xD;
would more gladly have enjoyed commu-&#xD;
nion with living than inanimate nature.&#xD;
In one of these moods 'he wandered&#xD;
forth on the beach. It was at that hour&#xD;
when&#xD;
The moon was up, and yet it was not inght.&#xD;
The sun was still in the sky, and the&#xD;
ocean blushed in- the gorgeous beams&#xD;
which crimsoned the west. A thousand&#xD;
clouds floated around the throne of his&#xD;
expiring glory, as though they were anx-&#xD;
ious to bear away to some favorite and&#xD;
distant clime, a trace of his splendor. A&#xD;
few stars were out to mark and guard the&#xD;
orbit of the timid moon, which, pale and&#xD;
more beautiful than all, seemed the type&#xD;
of that blissful world of peace and rest,&#xD;
from which she had just emerged.--&#xD;
Tancred felt in its full force the might&#xD;
and majesty around .him. Who can&#xD;
look on the boundless deep, the uncir-&#xD;
cumscribed firmament, the "stars which&#xD;
are the poetry of heaven," and not feel&#xD;
his own insignificance in the scale of cre-&#xD;
ation ?  Who can think of the world, its&#xD;
empty distinctions, its feverish passions,&#xD;
its trivial pursuits, while gazing on the&#xD;
immensity of nature ? The heart must&#xD;
be dead to every finer impulse, the mind&#xD;
destitute of every noble desire, which&#xD;
can restrict its views and wishes to mor-&#xD;
tality, while contemplating the symbols&#xD;
of immortality!       .-&#xD;
Immersed in his own reflections, the&#xD;
hours glided imperceptibly on, and Tan-&#xD;
cred started, on finding the waves were&#xD;
" winning their way to the golden shore."&#xD;
lHe was about to retreat hastily, when a&#xD;
form at a distance met his oIbservation.&#xD;
Perhaps it might be humanity to warn&#xD;
&#xD;
the only connecting links between us and&#xD;
happiness--when the snapping of them&#xD;
rives asunder, too, the ties of sympathy,&#xD;
and affection--oh ! who shall marvel that&#xD;
we hug the chain closer and closer, till&#xD;
the meshes become so woven and entan-&#xD;
gled with our very heart's strings, that&#xD;
the breaking of the one may shiver the&#xD;
others too !&#xD;
Tancred, convinced that the destiny of&#xD;
his future life depended for light or dark.&#xD;
ness on his beloved .Helen, offered his&#xD;
hand, though literally ignorant of the&#xD;
very name of her to whom he tendered&#xD;
it. His proposal was received in silence&#xD;
and tears ; still it was not rejected ; in-&#xD;
deed a faint smile illuminated her counte-&#xD;
nance, and a slight pressure of the hand&#xD;
she gave, when he talked of the ensuing&#xD;
week for their nuptials. This was su-&#xD;
perstructure enough for Tancred to build&#xD;
a fairy castle of hope upon, and he anti-&#xD;
cipated with unbounded joy, the near&#xD;
&#xD;
7'}I&#xD;
&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;
Beyond the name of Helen, he was even&#xD;
ignorant how the object of his worship&#xD;
was designated. "A rose by any other&#xD;
name would smell as sweet !" and, while&#xD;
gazing on the exquisite being before him,&#xD;
he often thought how little accessary&#xD;
were name, birth, or station, to the pos-&#xD;
session of beauty, grace, and dignity.&#xD;
She was eighteen, yet looked even child-&#xD;
ishly young for that brief date of years.&#xD;
Her form was bounding and light, and&#xD;
there was a freedom and elasticity in her&#xD;
step, which her natural quietness of'spirit&#xD;
and demeanor at times could scarcely con-&#xD;
trol. There were moments when a dark&#xD;
and melancholy shade would steal across-&#xD;
a brow pure and clear as the fair and&#xD;
.stainless snows of heaven; and the small&#xD;
rosy mouth, which seemed blushing for&#xD;
the peril its matchless beauty exposed&#xD;
others to, would compress and almost&#xD;
quiver with internal agony. The eye,&#xD;
too, so blue and bright, would sometimes&#xD;

&#xD;
prospect of calling Helen, the fair, th&#xD;
delicate Helen, his own forever !&#xD;
But now to deviate from the order o&#xD;
my narrative.&#xD;
In a ragged and rarely-trodden pat&#xD;
which led to the beach, stood a mea&#xD;
and. lonely hut. It was of that coars&#xD;
and rude description which the min&#xD;
involuntarily associates with the ide&#xD;
of even squalid poverty, and fror&#xD;
which the eye retreats, while the boson&#xD;
yields a sigh -for those condemned to in&#xD;
habit it. It wore a cheerless aspect, a&#xD;
air of negligence and gloomy desolate&#xD;
ness, which seemed as though it wer&#xD;
wilfully indulged, and even prided in&#xD;
The inmates of this hut consisted of al&#xD;
old man and his daughter--little wa&#xD;
known of them. The ascetip and un&#xD;
compromising sternness of the father op&#xD;
rated so powerfully against the daugh&#xD;
ter, that her meek demeanor and singula&#xD;
loveliness could hardly subdue the gene&#xD;
ral feeling of dislike which was entertain&#xD;
ed for them. Of their former occupation&#xD;
or even the precise nature of their pres&#xD;
ent ' employment, none were aware&#xD;
Some imagined that the father labored&#xD;
under a painful alienation of reason; for&#xD;
there was at times. a savage moodiness&#xD;
about him which approximated to insani-&#xD;
ty. He seldom was met in the hamlet,&#xD;
and neither visited nor received his neigh-&#xD;
bors, by many of whom, as he had been&#xD;
more than once surprised in the exercise&#xD;
of fire-arms and the arrangement of sea-&#xD;
tackle, it was supposed that he followed&#xD;
the dark, desperate, and unlicensed trade'&#xD;
of smuggling.-The unavowed exercise,&#xD;
too, of any other occupation, rendered&#xD;
the belief prevalent and strong. Nor&#xD;
was suspicion false. Old Denham, which&#xD;
was the appellation of Helen's father,&#xD;
was a smuggler by vocation and choice,&#xD;
it, might be also said, by nature. In early&#xD;
life he had filled a subaltern situation in&#xD;
the navy; but the moroseness of his tem-&#xD;
per led to quarrels with his captain, and&#xD;
he quitted an honorable service, to engage&#xD;
in a dishonorable traffic. He had fancied&#xD;
himself wronged, though he himself was&#xD;
his own enemy. The conviction, how-&#xD;
ever, of having been injured, combined&#xD;
with the loss of a wife, who, though he&#xD;
&#xD;
e tyrannized over while living, he bewailed&#xD;
ceaselessly when dead, and the accidental&#xD;
)f death of an only son, soured his disposi,&#xD;
Lion to absolute malignity.- The constant&#xD;
h poverty which he struggled with, his ex-&#xD;
.n clusion from all -society, and even the&#xD;
e beauty of Helen, which might render her&#xD;
d so accessible to design and danger-all&#xD;
a lent their aid in making Denham an ob-&#xD;
n ject of restless anxiety to his child, and&#xD;
n detestation to his neighbors.&#xD;
-   It has been stated, that, in ignorance&#xD;
n of her condition in life, in ignorance that&#xD;
- he had 'proffered his hand to one whose&#xD;
e father would have had little compunction&#xD;
. in stabbing him to the heart, Capt. Tan-&#xD;
n cred had fixed the following week for&#xD;
s uniting himself to the smuggler's daugh-&#xD;
- ter. For several nights a vessel had been&#xD;
- observed floating on the dark waters,&#xD;
- which had aroused the suspicions of&#xD;
r Captain Tancred. - On the Saturday night&#xD;
- preceding the week in which he fondly&#xD;
- hoped to realize his heart's dearest wish,&#xD;
it was again descried. On that evening&#xD;
a seaman, who had recently been added&#xD;
to their detachment, was on watch for the&#xD;
l first time. By the moonlight he recog-.&#xD;
nized in the commander of the little ves-&#xD;
sel a notorious smuggler who had long&#xD;
infested the coast of Kent, where he had&#xD;
previously served, but always eluded pur-&#xD;
suit, and had for some months disappear-&#xD;
ed from the neighborhood. The intelli-&#xD;
gence was communicated to Captain&#xD;
Tancred, who, with a party of men, put&#xD;
off in chase. It was a wild and stormy&#xD;
night; the moon at intervals only broke&#xD;
through the huge masses of cloud which&#xD;
drifted along the sky, the darkness of&#xD;
which received frequent illuminations&#xD;
from  the lightning's blue glare. The&#xD;
wind howled around, and&#xD;
From peak to peak the rattling crags among,&#xD;
Leaped the live thunder.&#xD;
Many a heart might have blenched from&#xD;
daring man's and heaven's wrath 'on&#xD;
such a night as this ; but Tancred and&#xD;
his companions were fearless ; duty ex.-&#xD;
cited them, and they sped 'onwards daunt-&#xD;
lessly. The vessels met, and a short but&#xD;
determined encounter ensued. The ni.&#xD;
merical strength of the smugglers was&#xD;
&#xD;
trifling in comparison with their oppo-&#xD;
nents; but despair lent them gigantic en-&#xD;
ergy, and they fought as though this world:&#xD;
and the next had been staked on the is-&#xD;
sue of the engagement. After a brief&#xD;
space, however, the scuffle terminated in&#xD;
the defeat and capture of the smugglers.&#xD;
Yet there was one amongst them who;&#xD;
stood unharmed, unyielding, undismayed.&#xD;
Throughout the combat a savage desper-&#xD;
ateness and ferocity of conduct had dis-&#xD;
tinguished him from his comrades, His'&#xD;
arm brandished a huge cutlass, which he&#xD;
raised to strike at the head of Captain,&#xD;
Tancred, who at the same moment.dis-&#xD;
charged his blunderbuss. One ball en-&#xD;
tered the heart of the smuggler, and a:&#xD;
gurgling splash of blood welled from his&#xD;
side. One deep short groan, and the!&#xD;
heart stopped its pulsations, and he fell"&#xD;
a heavy corpse at the feet of Tancred!&#xD;
But the smuggler was not alone in his&#xD;
death-nor a single victim to Tancred's,&#xD;
fathl weapon ;-" its scattered shot de-&#xD;
struction dealt around." In the com-&#xD;
mencement of the affray, a slight figure,&#xD;
masked, and enveloped in a large cloak,)&#xD;
had es  aped 'observation by crouching in,&#xD;
one corner of the vessel. As the danger&#xD;
thickegd, however, that form  sprang&#xD;
from concealment,,and was about to in-&#xD;
terpose between the combatants, when,&#xD;
the fatal trigger was pulled, and a random&#xD;
bullet entered a bosom heaving with love&#xD;
for its murderer. The brave and the,&#xD;
weak, the stern and the delicate, alike had;&#xD;
been annihilated by Tancred's arm, and,&#xD;
lay prostrate before him! The vessel'&#xD;
steered hastily back to the shore, and&#xD;
then was the discovery made, which&#xD;
stamped with unalloyed and unmitigable&#xD;
grief the future life of Tancred. Thel&#xD;
bodies of the smuggler and his comrades'&#xD;
were removed from   the boat.. There&#xD;
was no mask to hide the features of 01(d&#xD;
Denhani, and his ascertained identity cre-&#xD;
ated little sympathy. But the tearing off&#xD;
the mask, the removal of the fatal dis-&#xD;
guise from the figure of his youthful ad-&#xD;
herent, awakened a thrill of horror, and&#xD;
interest, and pity, in many a rugged&#xD;
breast, and overwhelmed one with a tide&#xD;
of misery that never ebbed. Perception&#xD;
&#xD;
-" v            L&#xD;
&#xD;
The Smuggler's Daughter.&#xD;
&#xD;
his daughter's state of unprotected loveli-&#xD;
ness might be invaded by insult. There&#xD;
was no ostentatious parade of grief about&#xD;

over the grave, when it opened to receive&#xD;

struck at his heart, withered up every&#xD;
blossom of joy, and blasted, as with vol-&#xD;

The Faded Girl.&#xD;
&#xD;
I KNEW Anna Delaney in her earl&#xD;
childhood. She was a lovely little be&#xD;
ing--playful as a fawn, bounding as at&#xD;
antelope. I parted from her for a few&#xD;
years, and when I returned, she was&#xD;
blossoming beauty of sixteen summers-&#xD;
a flirt in the fullest sense of the phrase&#xD;
and surrounded by admirers. Her sligh&#xD;
frame had rounded to perfect grace--&#xD;
deeper fire lit the brilliance of her eye&#xD;
and a stronger glow played fitfully upon&#xD;
her cheek. Her intellect, also, had won&#xD;
derfully developed. She- was even in&#xD;
her childhood esteemed precocious in&#xD;
mind and smart beyond her years; but I&#xD;
thought it impossible that so few sum-&#xD;
mers culd effect the revolution in the&#xD;
person and manners of Anna, the fruits&#xD;
of which I'now witnessed.&#xD;
It was just at twilight, in August, when&#xD;
I visited her father's house, after a long;&#xD;
absence. I inquired for her brother, who&#xD;
was my friend ; and, being shown into&#xD;
the parlor, was recognized and welcomed&#xD;
home by Anna. At first, unconscious&#xD;
that the being before me. could be her&#xD;
whose girlish lip I had so often pressed&#xD;
in innocent hilarity-I was formal and&#xD;
distantly polite; but the moment she was&#xD;
fully recognized, I again touched, her&#xD;
forehead with my lips, and pressed her&#xD;
light hand with the true warmth of friend-&#xD;
ship. The evening gradually stole on,&#xD;
and with the passage of the flying hours&#xD;
several young-gentlemen dropped in, evi-&#xD;
dently for the purpose of enjoying the&#xD;
society of Anna. Volatile and witty,&#xD;
she was polite and entertaining with all,&#xD;
and gave an interest and zeal to her con-&#xD;
versation beyond what might be expected&#xD;
&#xD;
y from her years.' She freely discussed&#xD;
- the merits of all the new works of note,&#xD;
n and expatiated with much discernment'&#xD;
v on the general features of the times. Of&#xD;
a me she inquired into the particulars of&#xD;
my travels, and endeavored by every&#xD;
method, to add to the stock of informa.&#xD;
t tion she already possessed.&#xD;
a   The night waned apace, and I returned&#xD;
to my residence, reflecting on the change&#xD;
which a few years sometimes effects. I&#xD;
- also mused of the creature who had sud-&#xD;
denly started into womanhood, bright and&#xD;
beautiful. Visions of love and of hap-&#xD;
piness floated through my imagination,&#xD;
and I fell into elysium dreams. The&#xD;
past came back to me-,-again I saw Anna&#xD;
Delaney in her innocent childhood,&#xD;
throwing her little arms around my neck,&#xD;
and holding up her guileless lips that I&#xD;
might kiss them. Then, the scene sud-&#xD;
denly changed-a stately and majestic&#xD;
creature stood before me; a slight tinge&#xD;
of pride was blended with the crimson&#xD;
of her lip, and a flash of fire mingled in&#xD;
the glorious light of her eye. I fell down,&#xD;
before her, and poured into her soul vows&#xD;
of affection-she blushed, trembled, and&#xD;
was silent ; but at last I felt her finger&#xD;
cling with a closer grasp to mine-the&#xD;
blood -shot like lightning through my&#xD;
veins-my heart was flooded with rap-&#xD;
ture, as she clung to my embrace. Again&#xD;
the scene changed-we were before the&#xD;
altar--she arrayed in all the splendor of&#xD;
her bridal garments, and I wrapped in&#xD;
elysian smiles of happiness. Her father&#xD;
and mother, and her brother, my friend,&#xD;
were all-.there. The hoary headed priest&#xD;
came in his sacerdotal array, and stood&#xD;
&#xD;
before the altar. Anna leaned, in her&#xD;
girlish weakness, upon my arm. I could&#xD;
perceive that she trembled, and a thrill&#xD;
of joy, blended with a strange tremor,&#xD;
passed over my own heart. The priest&#xD;
took the holy book in his hands; friends&#xD;
and relatives stood around us. I placed&#xD;
the hand of Anna in mine. A peal $f&#xD;
thunder shook the church to its founda-&#xD;
tion-and I awoke.&#xD;
A summer sun shone warmly into my&#xD;
chamber. In vain I strove to shake off'&#xD;
the delusion of my dream. ,The look&#xD;
of my trembling bride still haunted my,&#xD;
imagination, and the peal of thunder still&#xD;
rung strangely in my ears. For many,&#xD;
months I was the nightly visiter of Anna&#xD;
Delancy. The impression which her&#xD;
wit and beauty made upon my under-&#xD;
standing, strengthened with every visit,&#xD;
but knowing that I must again return to&#xD;
Europe for a- fsw months, I postponed&#xD;
the avowal of my passion until the even-&#xD;
ing previous to my departure. Fleetly&#xD;
the time passed in that interval. Hap-&#xD;
pily I may say, for although tortured by&#xD;
doubts and fears, there were some gleams&#xD;
of unsophisticated kindness in the man-&#xD;
ners of Ana, and I frequently persuaded&#xD;
myself that I was beloved. . But the&#xD;
time of my embarkation speedily arrived;&#xD;
and the night previous found me at the&#xD;
feet of her I loved. I told my tale with&#xD;
all the pathos possible. When I had!&#xD;
finished, she questioned me concerning&#xD;
my anticipated absence ! I told her that&#xD;
the ensuing night would find myself on&#xD;
the ocean. She hesitated long, and'with&#xD;
apparent seriousness-told me as yet her&#xD;
heart was wholly her own-promised, if&#xD;
my absence did not extend beyond six&#xD;
months, she would still retain the right&#xD;
of appropriating of its affections. One&#xD;
hallowed kiss was imprinted uuon her&#xD;
lips, and we parted.&#xD;
&#xD;
The term of ab ence was extended to&#xD;
two years. Duri g all that period the&#xD;
image of Anna Del ncy held the freshest&#xD;
and warmest place 'n my heart. I un-&#xD;
derwent trials and     'ps-toil and&#xD;
strife-but still she held the choicest&#xD;
shrine in my memory--was the dearest&#xD;
and fondest theme of my dreams. Con-&#xD;
stantly I wrote to her; but neither antici-&#xD;
pated nor received an answer-my hopes&#xD;
were still alive, though delayed--and I&#xD;
tho ght oft and long of the period when&#xD;
I s ould again return and find her all that&#xD;
my fondest dreams portrayed.&#xD;
At length I returned. Again I knock-&#xD;
ed at the door of her father's dwelling,&#xD;
an was admitted to the same parlor as&#xD;
be pre. The furniture was- the same,&#xD;
and seemed placed in the precise situa-&#xD;
tio i as when I was last there. A thou-&#xD;
sand delightful and familiar images croyd-&#xD;
ed into my mind. Anna Delancy was&#xD;
also there-but oh God ! how changed.&#xD;
She rose with a faint smile, and my&#xD;
name trembled from her lips. I would&#xD;
have clasped her to my heart, but shud-&#xD;
dered at the change as I gazed upon her&#xD;
features.&#xD;
Her history during my absence is brief.&#xD;
She loved and was beloved in return, by&#xD;
one who possessed every quality, both of&#xD;
mind and person, for winning the affec-&#xD;
tions of a young and artless female. He&#xD;
enjoyed a highly respectable station in&#xD;
society, was accepted by Anna's parents,&#xD;
and soon accepted by herself. The day&#xD;
was fixed for the wedding, when she was&#xD;
suddenly attacked by that most terrible&#xD;
disease, the small pox.# The sequel may&#xD;
readily be anticipated. Her beauty was&#xD;
totally destroyed-her lover forsook her,&#xD;
and she was now pining away of a broken&#xD;
heart. Oh God, forgive the change that&#xD;
will pass over human affections.&#xD;

THE LAST OF THE LINE&#xD;
&#xD;
BY MRS. S. C. HALL.&#xD;
IT was on ea tranquil evening, inthe might have almost thought her destined&#xD;
lady of no ordinary a   ane sthat a "To come like truth, and disappear like dreams."&#xD;
ly of o rdnay appearance sat at an&#xD;
open casement of many-coloured glass, Though she was young, there was much&#xD;
and overlooked a wild, but singularly of the dignity of silent sorrow in her as-&#xD;
beautiful, count.ry. From the window a pect; and it was difficult to converse&#xD;
flight of steep stone steps led to a nar- with her  without feeling her influence&#xD;
row terrace, that, in former times, had not to overpower, but to soften. Her&#xD;
been carefully guarded by high parapets form was slight, but rounded tosthe most&#xD;
of rudely-carved granite ; but they had perfect symmetry, and an extraordinary&#xD;
len tdeeay, and lay m mouldering quantity of hair, black as the raven's&#xD;
heaps on the shrubby bank, which ran wing, was braided, somewhat after the&#xD;
almost perpendicularly to a rapid stream fashion of other lands, over a high and&#xD;
that danced like a sunny spirit through well-formed brow; although such was&#xD;
the green meadows, dotted and animated the style of the times, she wore ono head-&#xD;
with sheep and their sportive lambs. In dress, except what nature-had bestowed;&#xD;
the distance, rude and rugged mountains a golden rosary, and cross of the same&#xD;
towered innatiare dignity, "high in air," metal, gemmed with many precious jew-&#xD;
their grim an sterile appearance form- els, hung over a harp-stand of antique&#xD;
ing an extraordinary, but not unpleasing, workmanship;, a few of the strings of&#xD;
contrast to the pure and happylooking the harp were broken, and a pile of rich-.&#xD;
valley at their base, where, however, a ly-bound music gave no token of being&#xD;
few dingy peasant-cottages lay thinly often disturbed.  Silken Ottomans, gild-&#xD;
scattered, injuring rather than enlivening ed vases, fresh-gathered flowers, and a&#xD;
a scene that nature had done much to long embroidered sofa, filled up, almost&#xD;
adorn, and man nothing . to preserve. to crowding, the small apartment. In a&#xD;
H-alf way up the nearest mountain, a lit- little recess, opposite the- window, a&#xD;
tle chapel, dedicated to "our Lady of child's couch was fitted with much taste&#xD;
Grace," hung, like a whited wren's nest, and care ; the hangings were of blue&#xD;
on what seemed a point of rock ; but, damask, curiously inwrought with silver,&#xD;
not even its rustic cross was visible from such as the nuns in France and Flanders&#xD;
the antique casement. Often and anx- delight to emboss; there was also a loose&#xD;
iously did the lady watch the distant fig- coverlet of the same material, and a tas-&#xD;
ures who trod the hill-side towards the seled oblong cushion at either end. I-&#xD;
holy place, to perform some act of pen- have said that the lady was seated at the&#xD;
ance or devotion,                    casement; sometimes she pressed her&#xD;
It was impossible to look on that in- small white fingers to her browand&#xD;
teresting woman without affection ; one then passed them over its rounded sur-&#xD;
&#xD;
face, as if to dispel, by that simple move-&#xD;
ment, thoughts, "the unbidden guests of&#xD;
anxious hours ;"-but still it was only&#xD;
for a moment her gaze was turned from&#xD;
her best -treasure,- her only child ; her&#xD;
eye followed it as, in its nurse's arms, it&#xD;
enjoyed the -evening breeze that played&#xD;
amid its light and clustering hair; the&#xD;
baby had a blue eye and a fair skin;&#xD;
and, if it sometimes, in the infantine se-&#xD;
riousness that passed as airy shadows&#xD;
over a smiling landscape, resembled its&#xD;
mother, now, as it laughed and shouted,&#xD;
in broken accents, " Mamma!'mamma !"&#xD;
she thought how like its father it spoke&#xD;
and looked.   Clavis Abbey-as the&#xD;
strange mixture of ancient and modern&#xD;
buildings, inhabited by the household of&#xD;
Sir John Clavis, was called-was wisely&#xD;
situated. The monks of old always&#xD;
chose happily for their monasteries ; the&#xD;
sites of their ruined aisles tell of the&#xD;
good taste, as well as good sense, of&#xD;
their reverend projectors. Hill, wood,&#xD;
and cdater, were ever, in their neighbor-&#xD;
hood, and the red deer and salmon were'&#xD;
always near to contribute to their repast.&#xD;
But the fair possessions had, more&#xD;
than a century before our tale com-&#xD;
mences, passed from the hands of holy&#xD;
Mother Church. The marvellous tale&#xD;
of its exchange of masters is still often&#xD;
repeated, and always credited ; it is said&#xD;
and believed, that the stream, which runs&#xD;
through the valley I have described, is&#xD;
every midsummer-night of a deep-red&#xD;
hue, in mysterious- commemoration of&#xD;
the massacre of the priests of that abbey,&#xD;
which took place as late as the Eliza-&#xD;
bethian reign. Certain it is that the pro-&#xD;
jector of such indiscriminate slaughter,&#xD;
never reaped the rich harvest he antici-&#xD;
pated; for, unable from severe illness to&#xD;
visit the court of the maiden queen, lie'&#xD;
despatched his son's tutor on the mis-I&#xD;
sion, wtlhcommunication of satheand -&#xD;
vie  he ha    redee the latde ad a&#xD;
petiion for a grant othladhea'&#xD;
rescued from popery. The tutor, how-&#xD;
ever, made himself so agreeable to the&#xD;
royal lady that she either was, or affect-&#xD;
ed to be, severely angered by the unne-&#xD;
cessary effusion of blood ; and, so far&#xD;
from approving, testified her displeasure,&#xD;
&#xD;
and bestowed the fair lands of the mur-&#xD;
dered monks upon Oliver Clavis, the&#xD;
false, but handsome, accessary of the&#xD;
priest-slayer. But no family could take&#xD;
possession of the consecrated'ground in&#xD;
Ireland witho t falling under the ban of&#xD;
both   Jure  nd people; and, notwith-&#xD;
standing the bland and liberal conduct of&#xD;
the new owner of the estate, then called&#xD;
Clavis Abbey, Oliver lived and. died as&#xD;
unpopular as could well be imagined.&#xD;
Tradition says that none of the heirs&#xD;
male of the family ever departed peace-&#xD;
ably in their beds, and much learned and&#xD;
unlearned lore is still extant upon the&#xD;
subject.&#xD;
Somewhat about the year 1782, Sir&#xD;
John Clavis entered upon his title and&#xD;
property, in consequence of the sudden&#xD;
demise of his father, Sir Henry, who was&#xD;
drowned on a moonshiny night, when the&#xD;
air and the sea were calm, and he was re-&#xD;
turning from an excursion to one of those&#xD;
fairy islands that at once' beautify and&#xD;
render dangerous the Irish coast. The&#xD;
people who accompanied him, on that&#xD;
last day of his existence, say that he had&#xD;
been in unusual health and spirits during&#xD;
the morning, and had fished, and sung,&#xD;
and drank as usual-that as the night ad-&#xD;
vanced he became reserved and gloomy,&#xD;
and, as they neared the coast, insisted on&#xD;
taking the helm-that, suddenly yielding&#xD;
the guidance of his little vessel, he sprang&#xD;
overboard-that immediately thy- crew&#xD;
crowded to save him, but a black cloud&#xD;
descended on the waters, and hid his form&#xD;
from their eyes, and it was not until the&#xD;
boat had driven an entire mile (as well as&#xD;
they could calculate) from the spot, they&#xD;
were enabled to behold the sea and the&#xD;
sky. Some laughed, some surmised, but&#xD;
many credited the tale, for superstition&#xD;
had hardly, at that period, resigned any&#xD;
of her strong holds; and the peasantry,&#xD;
acted unde the influence of a spirit-guide,&#xD;
that had lured-him to sudden death, con-&#xD;
formably with the old prophecy-&#xD;
" The party shall fail by Clavis ledter i&#xD;
And none of te name shl die in thi -e.&#xD;
Sir John had just completed his col-&#xD;
lege course when he was called upon to&#xD;
support the honors of his house and&#xD;

a mystery: itis to be supposed that he&#xD;

dence abroad, Dacey had exceedingly&#xD;
prospered ; and, though one or two&#xD;
shrewd landholders suspected he used&#xD;
means, not consistent' with his employ-&#xD;
er's interest, to obtain both influence and&#xD;
wealth, there was so much plausibility&#xD;
about the man, that the most watchful&#xD;
could bring nothing home to him ; his&#xD;
bearing was blunt and open; he affected&#xD;
honesty, but his look belied the. utter-&#xD;
ance of his tongue, for his eye lacked&#xD;
the expression of truth, and, instead of&#xD;
looking forth straightly from beneath its&#xD;
pent-house lid, was everlastingly twist-&#xD;
ing into corners--with cat-like quick-&#xD;
ness, watching a fitting opportunity,&#xD;
when those with whom he conversed&#xD;
were busied in other matters, to scan&#xD;
and observe their countenance. It has&#xD;
been to me an entertaining, though often&#xD;
an unpleasing study, to attend to the va-&#xD;
ried expressions conveyed by the mere&#xD;
action of the eye, almost without refer-&#xD;
ence to the other features ; and I would&#xD;
avoid, as I would a poisoned adder, the&#xD;
person whose eye quivers or looks down.&#xD;
The two friends (as such is the usual&#xD;
term given to those who eat meat at the&#xD;
same board,) were seated at either end&#xD;
of a somewhat long table, on which were&#xD;
piled papers of various dates and dimen-&#xD;
sions; a huge bowl of punch had been&#xD;
nearly emptied of its contents, and the&#xD;
baronet did not appear particularly fit for&#xD;
business-Irish gentlemen seldom are-&#xD;
jpt all events, after dinner: he leaned&#xD;
listlessly on the table, as if in reverie-;&#xD;
and it was only Dacey's voice that&#xD;
aroused him from his reflections.&#xD;
&#xD;
" But, my dear Sir John," he com-&#xD;
menced with his peculiar drawl, while&#xD;
his eye was fixed on the punch-ladle;&#xD;
"My dear Sir John, 'pon my sowl it&#xD;
weighs upon my conscience, so itdoes,&#xD;
to be managing here, and you to the fore,&#xD;
with such a fine head-and so much clev-&#xD;
erness (a sly glance to-see how the flat- '&#xD;
tery took), 'tis a shame you don't turn&#xD;
to it yourself, for by'n-by you'll, may-&#xD;
be, find things worse nor you think 'em,&#xD;
as I have told you before, God knows--"&#xD;
"And will my looking over ,these&#xD;
cursed papers make things better? It'&#xD;
is, positively, enough to set me mad,&#xD;
just at a time too when our grand coun-&#xD;
ty meeting is coming on, and the general&#xD;
election, and so much exertion expected&#xD;
from me; and the house will be full of&#xD;
English company from the castle, and&#xD;
Lady C. has not an idea how English&#xD;
people should be entertained."&#xD;
"But sure Miss Dorncliff is coming to&#xD;
stop with my lady while they stay."&#xD;
" Very true, she is a capital, good-na-&#xD;
tured girl, 'faith, and much better-look-&#xD;
ing than she was eight years ago, when&#xD;
I left Ireland.  Oh, dear ! I 'wonder&#xD;
young men of fortune marry, Dacey !&#xD;
"Sir John, it is very necessary."&#xD;
"Well, well, I suppose it is, but say&#xD;
no more about it ; there are enough of&#xD;
disagreeable subjects on the table al-&#xD;
ready." 'The baronet.-looked upon the&#xD;
pile of papers, and, the agent glanced&#xD;
keenly up, but his eye was quickly&#xD;
withdrawn.&#xD;
"My Lady was in a convent, I be-&#xD;
lieve, Sir John ?"&#xD;
"Ay; it was a fine exploit to get her&#xD;
out of it. Well, poor thing, she trusted&#xD;
nobly to my honour, and was not de-&#xD;
ceived."&#xD;
"Of course you were married by a&#xD;
priest?"  (This was said cautiously.)&#xD;
S" To be sure we were, and by a jovial&#xD;
fellow too: he went with me to the&#xD;
convent-wall, and performed the ceremo-&#xD;
ny at the foot of a beautiful old cross, by&#xD;
the way-side, as the' moon was sailing -&#xD;
over our heads, and the orange-trees -&#xD;
were showering perfume around us,.&#xD;
Poor Madelina!1 he continued, almost&#xD;
involuntarily, "I found the withered ora&#xD;
&#xD;
ange-blossoms, which that night I bound'&#xD;
upon her maiden brow, encased in a cas-&#xD;
ket, with the hair of our child, only this&#xD;
morning."&#xD;
"You had the ceremony repeated on&#xD;
your arrival in England ?" inquired Da-&#xD;
cey.&#xD;
Sir John Clavis fixed- his eyes upon&#xD;
the reptile, and, in a sterner tone of&#xD;
voice than was his wont, in his turn be-&#xD;
came the querist.&#xD;
"Why do you ask ?"&#xD;
" For no reason, only that if you had&#xD;
a son it would be well to see that the&#xD;
marriage was firm and legal."&#xD;
" Thank you," replied the b-ironet&#xD;
drily, " there is not much chance of that&#xD;
being the case ; and if there was-"&#xD;
A long pause followed the last sen-&#xD;
tence, which neither seemed inclined to&#xD;
disturb. Dacey gathered the papers to-&#xD;
wards him, and pulling his spectacles&#xD;
from his forehead to his nose, occupied&#xD;
himself in sorting and placing them in&#xD;
separate piles ; every five or ten minutes&#xD;
a no gentle sigh escaped from his Ii&#xD;
the last of which was so audible tha Sir&#xD;
John exclaimed, " What the devil, man&#xD;
alive, do you growl for iii that manner ?--&#xD;
one would think that you expected the&#xD;
ghost of your uncle, the priest, to start&#xD;
forth from the papers and upbraid you&#xD;
with your apostacv !"&#xD;
"Sorra a ghostat all then, Sir John,&#xD;
among the. papers ; only the reality of&#xD;
botherin' debts, custodiums, thrown-up&#xD;
leases on account of the rack-rent, and&#xD;
the Lord knows what !"&#xD;
"And whose fault is it ?" replied the&#xD;
gentleman angrily ; "did I not leave it&#xD;
all to your management ? The proper-&#xD;
ty was a good property, and why should&#xD;
it not continue so? I'm sure I can't&#xD;
think how the money goes ; to do Lady&#xD;
C. justice, she spends nothing."&#xD;
" There's the hounds, the hunters, and&#xD;
five grooms, of one sort or other, Sir&#xD;
John ; to say nothing of town-houses,&#xD;
and carriages, and--."&#xD;
" My father always had the same es-&#xD;
tablishment," interrupted Sir John, "and&#xD;
never kept an agent to overlook matters&#xD;
e"hMore's the pity !" ejaculated the&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
manager-(the exclamation might have&#xD;
been taken in two ways).&#xD;
"There's no manner of use in my&#xD;
keeping you, if I am to be pestered with&#xD;
those eternal accounts--accounts-ac-&#xD;
counts--morning, noon, and night. The&#xD;
simple fact is," continued Sir John, ri-&#xD;
sing from his seat,' "the simple fact is,&#xD;
money I want, and money I must have.&#xD;
After flying to the Continent to avoid an&#xD;
election, I find that now, at this particu-&#xD;
lar crisis, I can not help running into&#xD;
the ;very, strait I endeavoured tosteer&#xD;
clear of. My friends say it is,'neces-&#xD;
sary, and would even subscribe (if I per-&#xD;
mitted) to return me free of, expense;&#xD;
that I will never do--so money, Dacey,&#xD;
money I must have, that's certain."&#xD;
"It's easy to say money," retorted the&#xD;
agent; "will you sell,'Sir John ?"&#xD;
" What ?" interrogated the baronet.&#xD;
" There's the Corner estate, that long&#xD;
strip, close by -Ballyraggan; your cousin&#xD;
C     y of the hill has long had an eye&#xD;
it, and would lay down something&#xD;
a£ ome.&#xD;
"Youpoor pitiful scoundrel'!" ex-&#xD;
claimed Sir John, "do you think it's&#xD;
come to that, for me to sell land, like a&#xD;
huckster !-and to Corney too, a fellow&#xD;
that gathers inches off every estate, as a&#xD;
magpie picks fi'pinnies !-a fellow who,&#xD;
basely born and basely bred, has, never-&#xD;
theless, managed to accumulate wealth,&#xD;
like a pawnbroker, on the miseries of&#xD;
others; I know he has had an eye on&#xD;
that property these eight years, but look&#xD;
-sooner than he should have it, I'll beg&#xD;
my bread-I'll sell the estate to a stran-&#xD;
ger to prevent the possibility of him or&#xD;
his ever possessing an acre of the land."&#xD;
" Please y'erself, sir," replied the&#xD;
manager, sweeping some of the. papers&#xD;
into a wide-mouthed canvas sack, which&#xD;
he drew from under his chair. "Here's&#xD;
Mr. Damask's, the upholsterer's, letter-&#xD;
swears, if he's not paid, he'll clap on an&#xD;
execution like iightning ; it's as good as&#xD;
2,5001. now, with costs."&#xD;
" Fire and fury !" exclaimed the bar-&#xD;
onet, who, his apathy once shaken off,&#xD;
became terrible in his violence, "do you&#xD;
'Then I11 sy nothing of Mr. Barry&#xD;

Mahon's-little letter," continued the man&#xD;
of business quietly, "who writes, that&#xD;
as you've decided on standing, in op-&#xD;
position to him, he'll trouble you for the&#xD;
money he lent you as good as four years&#xD;
ago, to. complete some purchase or&#xD;
another ; it ends very civilly, though, by&#xD;
saying that it's only the knowledge that]&#xD;
a gentleman like you will be a formida-&#xD;
ble adversary,. which' obliges him to&#xD;
strain every nerve to make his own step&#xD;
firm."&#xD;
" A blight upon him and his civility !"&#xD;
"Then here is-"    Mr. Dacey was&#xD;
prevented from finishing his sentence by&#xD;
Sir John's striking the table so violently;&#xD;
with his clenched hand, that the very&#xD;
punch-bowl trembled, and the agent eja-&#xD;
culated, "Lord save us!"&#xD;
"Look here !" said the baronet, "you&#xD;
have, Iknow-means, somehow or other,,&#xD;
of raising money when you like; find me1&#xD;
the sum of ten thousand pounds by this&#xD;
day week, and that very estate, so covet-&#xD;
ed by my cousin Corney, shall be furs&#xD;
for ever, at a pepper-corn rent, pr4 d&#xD;
the matter be kept secret; mind, pro-&#xD;
vided it be kept secret, and you bind&#xD;
yourself never to let a twig of it into&#xD;
Corney's possession." -&#xD;
"It's easy to keep a thing a secret that&#xD;
never happens," observed Dacey, rolling&#xD;
the cord of the bag between his finger-&#xD;
and thumb; "is it me get money when&#xD;
I like ?--and I obliged to go at credit for,&#xD;
these brogues on my feet,"-and he put&#xD;
forth a topped boot, well-polished and&#xD;
shining, as he spoke.&#xD;
i'The Corner estate, as it is called,"&#xD;
repeated Sir John.&#xD;
"At. a, pepper-corn rent," pondered&#xD;
Dacey; "if a body could any way make&#xD;
up the money, I'd do a dale to oblige&#xD;
you, sir;. and though I've neither cross&#xD;
nor coin.to bless myself with, to be sure,&#xD;
I know them that has, who, may-be, for&#xD;
a valuable consideration, might--thoug~h&#xD;
I don't know--the little estate-eh !- ...&#xD;
ten thousand !--it's badly worth that,$irj&#xD;
John, unless, indeed, you'd throw ,the'&#xD;
fourteen acres of pasture-by the loch Into&#xD;
it."&#xD;
" Well!" exclaimed the indolent ba-&#xD;
ronet, though perfectly conscious that the&#xD;
&#xD;
land was worth treble the sum; "we'll&#xD;
talk about that, provided you ensure me&#xD;
the money; and now gather your parch-&#xD;
ments, and vanish ; I've had enough of&#xD;
arithmetic to last me for some months-.&#xD;
and Dacey!"&#xD;
" Yes, Sir."&#xD;
" .ifter the election, I will really look&#xD;
into matters myself; but, at present,&#xD;
when the good of my country is- at stake&#xD;
-when we are threatened with invasion&#xD;
from without and rebellion from within&#xD;
--the man must be basely selfish who&#xD;
thinks of self-Oh, Dacey ! did you see&#xD;
the Madeira safely into the'cellar?"&#xD;
"Yes, Sir John."&#xD;
" Good night, Dacey !-there--good&#xD;
night-you won't forget-ten thousand-&#xD;
hard gold-none of your flimsy paper-&#xD;
the Corner estate."  .0~&#xD;
"And the pasture."&#xD;
" There, good night," repeated the&#xD;
baronet. As the wily agent bowed him-&#xD;
self out of the apartment, Sir John Clavis&#xD;
rose from his seat, and threw open the&#xD;
window which was directly under the&#xD;
turret that formed the boudoir of his&#xD;
Spanish wife; indeed it was the sound&#xD;
of her guitar that had drawn him to it;&#xD;
and he recognized a favorite seguidilla,&#xD;
to which he had written words; he re-&#xD;
membered having taught her to repeat&#xD;
them; and the full rich voice that had&#xD;
given them so much beauty-if in that&#xD;
twilight hour it sounded less melodious-&#xD;
had never fallen upon his ear so full of&#xD;
tenderness ; its simple burthen--&#xD;
Sweet olive-groves of Spain,"&#xD;
brought the remembrance of what Made-&#xD;
lina was to ,him, in the days when he&#xD;
playfully chid the mispronunciation of&#xD;
his poetry; and as the prospect of re-&#xD;
ceiving the ten thousand, and not being&#xD;
plagued about money matters, had some-&#xD;
what softened his temper (the idea that&#xD;
he was diminishing his property had no&#xD;
share whatever in his thoughts--posses-&#xD;
sing, as he did, the peculiarly Irish quali-&#xD;
fication of looking only on to-day), he&#xD;
thought, I say, of his wife, with more&#xD;
complacency than he had done since the&#xD;
affair of the green velvet. He was pleased&#xD;
when he heard Miss Dorncliff (of whose&#xD;
&#xD;
arrival he wa unconscious) urge her to&#xD;
repeat the ra nA She commenced, but&#xD;
at a line which he well remembered-&#xD;
,,,&#xD;
"I know no b sing but thy smile,"&#xD;
her voice faltered and the next moment&#xD;
he heard her   ie  chiding away her&#xD;
tears ; his  st impul e was to go to her&#xD;
apartment, and inqui e their cause; but&#xD;
then he ha d seen s, and vanity or cu-&#xD;
riosity, or both,  pted him to remain;&#xD;
and the broken dialogue which followed,&#xD;
happily for the repose of his soul, roused,&#xD;
.   in- his wife's cause, the best feelings of&#xD;
.   his heart.' Many were the affectionate&#xD;
expressions lavished by Miss Dornliff&#xD;
on her friend, and many the entreaties&#xD;
that she would cease to agitate herself&#xD;
upon what she insisted was a surmise&#xD;
without foundation.&#xD;
"You would not say so," replied Ma-&#xD;
delina, "if you had seen his attention, his&#xD;
tenderness, on the Continent-or 'heard&#xD;
his repeated promises that my religion&#xD;
should be held sacred; the little silver&#xD;
shrine, that my sainted mother so often&#xD;
knelt to, I have been obliged to remove,&#xD;
even from this chamber, which it is&#xD;
mockery to call my own;, and though I&#xD;
can not understand all he says--and&#xD;
though his eye is bright, and his lip&#xD;
smiles, sometimes, yet he never looks&#xD;
upon me as he used; to me his counte-&#xD;
nance is sadly changed."&#xD;
" I'll tell you what, my dear," replied&#xD;
her friend, taking advantage of a pause in&#xD;
her complaint, " adopt the course I should&#xD;
have done, if my good father's scheme&#xD;
had, unfortunately for me, been carried&#xD;
into effect. Assert your own dignity; if&#xD;
he looks as cold as snow, do you look as&#xD;
cold as ice-if he stamps, do you storm&#xD;
--if he orders, do you counter-order-if&#xD;
he says, 'I will,' do you say, 'you&#xD;
sha'n't.' My life on it !-such conduct&#xD;
'for one week would bring him sighing to&#xD;
your feet. Here, you sit, with your&#xD;
baby, which, if he had the common feel-&#xD;
ings of a man, he would worship you for&#xD;
presenting to him-"&#xD;
" Stop, my dear Margaret," said Lady&#xD;
Cla is ; " do him not injustice ; he loves&#xD;
his hild as fondly as father ever loved a&#xD;
el' ; he has not changed to it-"&#xD;
&#xD;
" Yet," interrupted in her turn, the in-&#xD;
dignant Margaret, "he has not changed&#xD;
yet, but who can tell how soon he may?&#xD;
The man who would change to you must&#xD;
be base indeed."&#xD;
" He is not base," replied the wife, in&#xD;
a sweet low tone, which penetrated into&#xD;
the inmost recesses of Sir John's heart,&#xD;
"'not base, only weak; he is surrounded&#xD;
by a parcel of flatterers, many of whom&#xD;
hate. me because of my religion, and&#xD;
others for reasons which I can not, de-&#xD;
fine; but look, Margaret, were he to treat&#xD;
me as a dog, were he to spurn me from&#xD;
him, and trample me to dust, even that&#xD;
dust would rise to heaven's own gate to&#xD;
ask for blessings on his head."&#xD;
"She is an angel, after all !" thought&#xD;
Sir John.&#xD;
" You are a fool, my dear!" both&#xD;
thought, and exclaimed Miss Dorneliff;&#xD;
" and I only wish I were big enough to&#xD;
throw him over the terra of this old&#xD;
musty place, and I would soon choose&#xD;
out a husband worthy of your love."&#xD;
4" Upon my word, I am much obliged&#xD;
to you, Miss Minx !" murmured the ba-&#xD;
ronet, as he cautiously, closed the win-&#xD;
dow, resolving to turn over a new leaf,&#xD;
and station himself, for the remainder of&#xD;
the evening in his wife's dressing-room,&#xD;
He could not avoid thinking, as he passed&#xD;
through the winding corridors and up the&#xD;
staircases, " a very pretty wife I should&#xD;
have had, if it had been as my worthy&#xD;
agent seems to think it might be even&#xD;
now. The fellow means well, but he is&#xD;
mistaken; I should not have been able to&#xD;
call my life my own-the termagant!&#xD;
Thank goodness, I escaped her ! I never&#xD;
valued my blessing before!"&#xD;
He met his child in the lobby, and&#xD;
took the laughing cherub from the nurse's&#xD;
to his own arms.. As he prepared to en-&#xD;
ter, " You may go down, Mary," he said,&#xD;
seeing the maid waiting to receive, the&#xD;
child, "INill -take Miss Madeline in&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
How easily can a man make the wo-&#xD;
man who truly loves himi happy ! It was&#xD;
enough for Lady Clavis that her husband&#xD;
was at her side-enough that' he smiled&#xD;
upon her.-tenough that he called her 'ar-&#xD;

&#xD;
ter for them both, had she possessed the&#xD;
strength of mind to entitle her to the&#xD;
name of "friend," the most sacred, yet&#xD;
the most abused, of all endearing terms.&#xD;
Miss Dorncliff exulted in her happiness,&#xD;
though her more cool and deliberate tem-&#xD;
perament led her to believe that Sir John's&#xD;
"love-fit," as she termed it in her own&#xD;
mind, would not be of long duration.&#xD;
She little knew the service she had ren-&#xD;
dered Lady Clavis by her somewhat in-&#xD;
temperate advice; nor the dread the ba-&#xD;
ronet had, lest any portion of that advice&#xD;
should be followed by his gentle wife.&#xD;
As Mar Conway, Madelina's nurse,&#xD;
descended to the vestibule, she heard a&#xD;
voice, whose sound was familiar to her&#xD;
ear, repeat her name two or three times,&#xD;
and in various tones; she lingered for a&#xD;
moment, a8d then,' as if gladly remem-&#xD;
bering that her infant charge was com-&#xD;
mitted to its parent's care, turned into an&#xD;
abrupt passage, leading from the great&#xD;
hall to one of the archways, where dew&#xD;
and damps mouldered from day to day&#xD;
upon the massive walls.&#xD;
" What are you afther wantin' now,&#xD;
Mister Benjy ?" she inquired, as the out-&#xD;
line of her lover's (for there is no use in&#xD;
concealing the fact) figure became visible&#xD;
to her laughing eyes.&#xD;
"Nothing particular, that is to say;&#xD;
very particular," replied the youth, who&#xD;
was no other than Dacey's nephew;&#xD;
" only I'm going a journey to-night, and&#xD;
I thought I'd be all the betther for your&#xD;
God speed, or may-be a bit of prayer to&#xD;
the saints ye think so much of."&#xD;
"A journey!-where to-?" inquired&#xD;
Mary, with a palpitating heart.&#xD;
" Why, thin, just to Dublin, Mary,&#xD;
honey. And it's glad enough I'd be to&#xD;
get out of this murderin' grand ould&#xD;
place, only just for one single thing."'&#xD;
" And might a body know what that&#xD;
is?" again inquired the maiden.&#xD;
" Honor bright, Mary, because I sha'nt&#xD;
see y'er sweet smilin' face for many a&#xD;
long day, may-be; for uncle says he has&#xD;
a dale o' business to transact in Dublin,&#xD;
and that he'll be -wanting me to look&#xD;
afther it; indeed, I'm thinkin' that he&#xD;
has a notion we' re keeping company,&#xD;
and don't over like it; though, Mary,&#xD;
&#xD;
293&#xD;
&#xD;
darlin', its more nor he can do to put be-&#xD;
tween us."&#xD;
Mary covered her face with her hand,&#xD;
and, though no sigh or sound escaped&#xD;
her lips, tears bedewed her cheeks. She&#xD;
was nothing more nor less than a frank-&#xD;
hearted, good-natured girl, with .only&#xD;
three, or perhaps four, definite ideas in&#xD;
her pretty round head-the first of which&#xD;
was decided love for her mistress, and&#xD;
her mistress's child-a great portion of&#xD;
affection for benjamin Dacey-and no&#xD;
small regard for finery in all its branches&#xD;
and bearings; she consequently had not&#xD;
a multiplicity of objects to divide her at-&#xD;
tention, which was therefore steadily de-&#xD;
voted to the ,service of her three or four&#xD;
several propensities. The idea of her&#xD;
lover's being sent away, and to Dublin&#xD;
too, overwhelmed her with grief, to which&#xD;
she would have given more audible vent,&#xD;
but that Benjamin had unwittingly ob-&#xD;
served, his "uncle didn't over like his&#xD;
keeping company   with, her,"  which&#xD;
aroused the maiden's pride; she there-&#xD;
fore said, "that indeed Mr. Dacey ought&#xD;
to remimber when he once held two or&#xD;
three acres of land under her father," and&#xD;
that, " though she was at the Abbey, she&#xD;
was far from being a rale sarvant; she&#xD;
took care of Miss Maddy more from pure&#xD;
love than aiay thing else. May-be, it&#xD;
was Mister Benjy himself that wanted to&#xD;
be off the -promise-if so, she was wil-&#xD;
ling and ready," &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c. But, in fact,&#xD;
these lover's quarrels are the same in all&#xD;
cases; I could give a recipe by which&#xD;
people ight quarrel, agreeably, ten&#xD;
times a Week on an average-only, as&#xD;
love would be the principal ingredient in&#xD;
my prescription, I fear the misunder-&#xD;
standings would be too soon understood&#xD;
for. your genuine downright-in-earnest&#xD;
quarrellers,-a set of choleric individuals,&#xD;
which I sincerely testify, I hold in most&#xD;
fervent abhorrence. I can not tarry with&#xD;
those young people, during this parting&#xD;
scene, but only recount that "Mary," as&#xD;
she afterwards expressed it, "got a dale&#xD;
out of Benjy, which no one should be the&#xD;
wiser'for; only her heart was fairly&#xD;
crushed--thinkin' what a misfortune it&#xD;
was to a boy like him to have such an&#xD;
uncle;" even this she only communicated&#xD;
&#xD;
294&#xD;
&#xD;
--                                                                   v&#xD;
&#xD;
to her particular friend and companion,&#xD;
Patty Grace.&#xD;
When the expected company arrived&#xD;
from Dublin,-from "the Castle," as it&#xD;
has been familiarly termed for ages-it&#xD;
was evident that Sir John had nerved his&#xD;
mind to some great undertaking to which&#xD;
he was secretly urged by Dennis Dacey.&#xD;
Indeed, the particular party who had.&#xD;
once been led by his father were anxious&#xD;
that he should tread in the same steps,&#xD;
and they again regretted that his union&#xD;
with a Catholic was likely to cool his&#xD;
ardor in "the good cause;" they how-&#xD;
ever did their best to urge him forward&#xD;
--and " the glorious and immortal me-&#xD;
mory" was drank so often after dinner,&#xD;
that those who sacrificed to the sentiment,&#xD;
had neither glorious nor inglorious me-&#xD;
mory left. The humble parish priest&#xD;
never joined in these revels; and when&#xD;
Dacey, in Lady Clavis's presence, hinted&#xD;
at this circumstance, andiad, moreover,&#xD;
the audacity to assert that his absence&#xD;
was a tacit acknowledgment of disloy-&#xD;
alty, the lady roused herself in -defence&#xD;
of her ancient friend, and told the agent&#xD;
that, if religion was a proof of loyalty, he&#xD;
must be the worst of traitors,.for he was&#xD;
a renegade from the faith of his fathers,&#xD;
and had changed for the love of filthy&#xD;
lucre. Dacey trembled and turned pale;&#xD;
but as he quitted the apartment lie put-&#xD;
tered a deep and bitter curse against the&#xD;
lady of Clavis Abbey. Not only had,&#xD;
" the little estate" been secretly trans-&#xD;
ferred to Dacey, along with the fourteen&#xD;
acres of pasture, and the ten thousand&#xD;
pounds paid for present relief, but other&#xD;
sums must, at this crisis, be advanced to&#xD;
relieve the necessities of the proprietor,&#xD;
and other lands sacrificed to feed the ra-&#xD;
pacity of thi agent. Mr. Barry Mahon&#xD;
resolved to stand as the people's cham-&#xD;
pion, and already were the addresses of&#xD;
the several'candidates duly prited mi the&#xD;
county papers ; the Abbey. became~ a&#xD;
scene of interminable bustle and confu-&#xD;
sion'; as the day for the commencement&#xD;
of the election approached, it would be&#xD;
difficult to convey an idea of the strange1&#xD;
persons and scenes that crowded on each&#xD;
other. TIo Mary Conway's great de-&#xD;
light, Benjamin unexpectedly returned;&#xD;
&#xD;
and, from the mannerin which his uncle&#xD;
received him, it might be supposed that&#xD;
he was not particularly pleased at the&#xD;
circumstance ; he, however, carved out&#xD;
for him the task of managing (dare I say&#xD;
bribing?) a few refractory freeholders at&#xD;
some distance; but the young man did&#xD;
not depart untilhe had whispered some&#xD;
words of moment into his true love's ear.&#xD;
The sarne evening, when Mary was un-&#xD;
dressing the little Madeline, Lady Clavis&#xD;
entered the room, happy to escape from&#xD;
a tumult she could hardly understand.&#xD;
" I'm so glad y'er honorable ladyship's&#xD;
come in," said the girl; "I wanted so&#xD;
much to know what you'd have packed&#xD;
up to take into towrrto-morrow, my lady&#xD;
--as,of course you mean to go with his&#xD;
honor to see the election and all that ?"&#xD;
"Indeed,Mary," replied Lady Clavis,&#xD;
"I have no such intention; I shall be but&#xD;
too glad to escape the bustle of it here--&#xD;
and I should be only in the .way, Sir&#xD;
John says."&#xD;
" Och, my grief! Does his honor, the&#xD;
master, say that? But, no matter, ma-&#xD;
dam, dear, for the love o' God, as -ye&#xD;
value y'er own honor, and the honor. of&#xD;
this sweet baby, go !-go, for God's sake!&#xD;
-or you'll be sorry for it,-mark my&#xD;
words !"&#xD;
Lady Clavis was astonished at the&#xD;
girl's vehement manner and gestures, but&#xD;
still she remained firm, to her purpose,&#xD;
She was suffering acutely from mental&#xD;
anxiety and bodily exertion; and as Sir&#xD;
John had continued'to treat her with great&#xD;
kindness, she was anxious tp show how&#xD;
willingly she would yield to his wishes&#xD;
-even where they were opposed to her&#xD;
own. But Mary was not to be thus sa-&#xD;
tisfied.  She "hushowed" her little&#xD;
charge to sleep, and descended to the&#xD;
lobby that led to her master's study.&#xD;
She paused for a few moments at the en-&#xD;
trance, and inclned her ear so as to catch&#xD;
any sound that might pass along, having&#xD;
ascertained that persons were speaking&#xD;
within. I can not avoid lamenting that&#xD;
she was led away, by what might be&#xD;
called, " natural curiosity," to draw near&#xD;
-very near; so near that her ear cover-&#xD;
ed the key-hole-and listen.-systematia&#xD;
cally listen-to whatever conversation&#xD;

was going 4n. She might have remained&#xD;
some fifteen minutes, in no very com-&#xD;
fortable attitude, when she suddenly&#xD;
started up; but had hardly receded three&#xD;
steps from the door, when it was opened,&#xD;
and the round vulgar face of Dacey ap-&#xD;
peared, carefully prying into the dark-&#xD;
ness. Mary saw she could not escape&#xD;
unnoticed, so, with ready wit, she in-&#xD;
quired, "Oh, Misther Dacey, have you&#xD;
seen my lady's Finny?  I've been hunt-&#xD;
in' all-the evenin' after the ugly baste,&#xD;
and can get neither tale nor tidings of it?&#xD;
--Finny!-Finny!--Finny!"&#xD;
"4Can ye see in the dark, like the cats,&#xD;
Miss Mary, with y'er fine red top knot ?"&#xD;
said Dacey, earnestly.&#xD;
"Troth, ye may ask that," she re-&#xD;
plied, "for my candle went out."&#xD;
" And where's the candlestick, Miss&#xD;
Mary ?" persisted the keen querist.&#xD;
"No wonder ye'd inquire, but sorra&#xD;
one have we been able, to lay hands on&#xD;
these threp weeks, for the shoals o'com-&#xD;
pany, so I just used the same candle-&#xD;
stick my father and your father, Misther&#xD;
Dacey, was best acquainted with-my&#xD;
fingers, why !---Finny !-Finny !--&#xD;
Finny !"&#xD;
She was receding, calling the dog.at'&#xD;
the same time ; when Dacey, whose ire&#xD;
wasroused, followed her nearly to the&#xD;
end, and said, -'You'd better not turn&#xD;
y'er tongue against my family, Miss Im-&#xD;
pudence, for ye're mighty anxious to&#xD;
get into it, I'm thinkin'."&#xD;
" Not into your family, Mistber Da-&#xD;
cey," retorted Mary,, proudly. " Anx-&#xD;
ious, indeed ! I don't deny that Benjy&#xD;
and I have been keepin' company, though&#xD;
my true belief is he's no nevvy of yours.&#xD;
Ye'd think little of adoptin' any man's&#xD;
child or property either."&#xD;
" Hah !" he exclaimed, seizing her&#xD;
arm and pressirig it firmly, "is that the&#xD;
news ye' re afther ?--ye'd better--"&#xD;
but the girl prevented his finishing his.&#xD;
threat by screaming " Murder !" so loud-&#xD;
ly, thiat'Sir John Clavis rushed out, with&#xD;
a candle in his hand, to inquire into the&#xD;
disturbance.&#xD;
Dacey looked extremely foolish, while&#xD;
Mary lifted her apron to' her eyes, and&#xD;
with well-feigned tears, declared, "It's I&#xD;
&#xD;
a shame-and I'll tell my lady, so I will,&#xD;
that when I was looking for little Finny,&#xD;
that man corned out of your honour's&#xD;
study to kiss me, y'er honour-a dacent&#xD;
girl like me-I'll tell my lady, so I will.&#xD;
Finny !-Finny !-Finny !"    And off&#xD;
she marched triumphantly, leaving Da-&#xD;
cey to explain his equivocal situation as&#xD;
he best could.&#xD;
The night had become dark and&#xD;
stormy; and, when Mary put her head&#xD;
from under -the archway, before men-&#xD;
tioned, large drops of rain were drifted&#xD;
on her, face. She hastily folded her&#xD;
gray mantle round her, and, stepping&#xD;
from paraet to parapet of the ancient&#xD;
enclosure, gained a particular elevation&#xD;
that overlooked the entire country. Here&#xD;
she paused for a moment, and then&#xD;
pushed into the brushwood that covered&#xD;
the slope leading to the meadows. Ha-&#xD;
ving reached the stream, that partook of&#xD;
the agitation of the evening gale, she&#xD;
seemed puzzled how to make her pas-&#xD;
sage good ; but her perplexity was not&#xD;
of long duration, although the stepping-&#xD;
stones were perfectly covered by the&#xD;
swollen waters. She seated herself on&#xD;
the wet grass, took off her shoes and&#xD;
stockings, and, folding her clothes round&#xD;
her, prepared to cross the river. Having&#xD;
achieved her purpose, after much buffet-&#xD;
ing with both wind and water, she re-&#xD;
adjusted her dress, and proceeded on her&#xD;
way so intently, and with so much reso-&#xD;
lution, that I doubt if she would have&#xD;
stayed her course had she even met the&#xD;
bogle that frightened the good Shepherd&#xD;
of Ettrick---        ,&#xD;
"Its face was black as Bryant coal,&#xD;
Its nose was o' the whunstane;&#xD;
Its mou'was like a borel hole-&#xD;
That puffed out fire and brimstane."&#xD;
Regardless of banshees, clurecauns, or&#xD;
any of the fairy tribe, so admirably de-&#xD;
picted by their historian Crofton (Croker,&#xD;
Mary pressed earnestly forward till she&#xD;
arrived opposite a small gate that opened&#xD;
into an extensive park ; the lock, like&#xD;
most Irish locks, was out of repair, so&#xD;
that she had but to apply her finger un.-&#xD;
derneath, and push the .bolt back. She&#xD;
only paused to inhale a long breath, and&#xD;
flew onward across the yielding grass,&#xD;
&#xD;
startling birds and herded deer from&#xD;
their early slumbers : this continued&#xD;
fleetness soon brought-her opposite the&#xD;
gate of a noble modern mansion, but she&#xD;
preferred entering through a little post-&#xD;
ern-door to ascending the stone steps.&#xD;
" Where's her honour ?" she inquired&#xD;
of an old serving-man, astonished at -her,&#xD;
untimely visit.&#xD;
"Lord, Ma - you've frightened the'&#xD;
senses out o'  ."  '&#xD;
"Why, thin ,'s myself is glaA to hear&#xD;
it."     /&#xD;
" Why so, M ry ?"&#xD;
"Because it's the first I've ard of&#xD;
y'er havin' any in,-but wh e's' the&#xD;
lady ?"&#xD;
" Umph," repl I the old erva , ev-&#xD;
idently annoyed,  nd out !"  (, tu n-&#xD;
ing on his heel, L was leaving the of-&#xD;
fended damsel aloe , when she snatched&#xD;
the candle, that ma tained a very equiv-&#xD;
ocal equilibrium in js hand, and ran up&#xD;
the back staircase.&#xD;
"That one has the impudence of the&#xD;
ould boy in her, and makes as free in&#xD;
this house as if it was her own," he ob-&#xD;
served.&#xD;
She tapped gently at the door of a&#xD;
'small apartment, and a clear-toned voice&#xD;
responded, "come in."  In another mo-&#xD;
ment, Mary was in Miss Dorncliff 's&#xD;
presence. She advanced, making a&#xD;
curtsey .at every second step, until she&#xD;
stood opposite the' young lady, who re-&#xD;
garded her with much surprise.&#xD;
" Why, Mary, is your mistress ill-&#xD;
or has any thing happened to little&#xD;
Madeline ?"&#xD;
" No, God be thanked !--nothin'. -to&#xD;
say nothin'--yet," replied the girl, lay-&#xD;
ing her hand on the back of a chair for&#xD;
support, for she had traversed nearly five&#xD;
Irish miles in less than an hour.&#xD;
"Sit down, sit down, my good girl,"&#xD;
said the lady, kindly ; " and, as soon as&#xD;
you can, tell me what has agitated you&#xD;
thus."&#xD;
" Thank you, my lady-sure ye said&#xD;
that just like herself that's the angel en-&#xD;
tirely, if ever there was one, God knows !&#xD;
-and God counsel her, and you, my&#xD;
lady ; for she won't be said or led by&#xD;
me, and more's the pity !"&#xD;

" You speak of your mistress, Mary,&#xD;
I suppose," interrupted Miss Dorneliff,&#xD;
"but do cone to the ioint at once, for I&#xD;
am all anxiety."&#xD;
"I can't make a long story , short,.&#xD;
madam, particularly when my heart's all&#xD;
in it-but, as fast as I can, I'll riddle it&#xD;
all out, for sure my heart's, burstin' to&#xD;
tell t."  The lady assumed the attitude&#xD;
of a patient listener, and Mary, again&#xD;
drawing a long breath, and pulling first&#xD;
one and then another of her red, but&#xD;
taper fingers, commenced the disclosure&#xD;
of her mystery.&#xD;
" Ye remember, when her ladyship&#xD;
first came over, the robbery and the&#xD;
work there was about her ; and the peo-&#xD;
ple-the protestant people, (savin' y'er&#xD;
favour-all but y'erself,) saying this,&#xD;
that, and t'other about .her, as if she&#xD;
wasn't what she out to be. Well, to my&#xD;
knowledge and belief, the one who kept&#xD;
this stirrin' was no other than that ould&#xD;
vagabond-that the beams of God's own&#xD;
sun and moon 'ud scorn to rest upon-&#xD;
(saving' y'er presence, for mentionin'&#xD;
him before ye)--ould Dacey ; because&#xD;
ye're sensible he's a turn-coat in the&#xD;
first place-and my lady is so steady to&#xD;
her duty that it was ever and always&#xD;
puttin' him to shame; and to be sure my&#xD;
lady, seem,' I suppose,- that in foreign&#xD;
parts the poor are all negres, God save&#xD;
us! (may-be black bodies too,) my lady&#xD;
was high to him-she has a high way&#xD;
with her, I grant, and sure so has the&#xD;
lilies, though they're- so sweet and gen-&#xD;
tle when you come to know them-well,&#xD;
for that he hated her ; and I'm sure it's&#xD;
more to get at the way of punishing her,&#xD;
than even securin' the property, that he's&#xD;
been goin' on as he has lately---"&#xD;
"Securing what property ?-going on&#xD;
how ?" eagerly demanded Miss Dorn-&#xD;
cliff.&#xD;
" Let me tell you ry own way, miss,&#xD;
agra! or I can't go on; besides, how&#xD;
would ye get at the rights of it, if ye&#xD;
didn't hear from the beginnin' !"&#xD;
Miss Dorneliff resumed her patient at-&#xD;
titude.&#xD;
" Ye see ould Dacey knows what he's&#xD;
afther, and Sir John has a way of his&#xD;
own of 'never seeing' to any thing--gen.&#xD;

ready money, at half their valee, agreein' expose him in the face of the people,&#xD;

bitterly.                            s&#xD;
"My poor friend !-my dear- Made-&#xD;

hastily passed up and down the apart- 'h&#xD;
ment, "how worthy of a better fate !-  l&#xD;
Mary, there is no use in your denying a&#xD;
it; Benjy has given you this informa- I&#xD;
tion, and he must give it publicly."  f&#xD;
"D'ye want, ruin on him too ?" re- y&#xD;
turned the subdued girl; "sure he's&#xD;
above a trade, and has been brought up s&#xD;
like a born gentleman to do nothin'-;-  h&#xD;
and, even if he had a mind, how can he s&#xD;
turn agin the ould villain, his uncle, when c&#xD;
sorra a penny he'd) have in the world, h&#xD;

" Look," said the lady ; "if Benja-I I&#xD;
min will bring forward such proof of r&#xD;
trickery as can force conviction on Sirr&#xD;
John's mind, I will settle upon him a m&#xD;
sufficiency for life ; and there," she con-C&#xD;
tinted, throwing her purse into Mary's t&#xD;
lap, "is the earnest of my promise."&#xD;
For a moment, the girl forgot her mis-r&#xD;
tress's interest in her own, as she eyed;&#xD;
the glittering treasure ; but soon she re-i&#xD;
verted to what, with true Irish fidelity,1 &#xD;
was nearest to her heart.&#xD;
"My lady, you'll come to her now,&#xD;
and persuade the masther to take her, 1&#xD;
and make out something to oblige. him to:&#xD;
take her. Och ! my heart never warm-&#xD;
ed to ye as much as it does at this min-&#xD;

before the conclusion of the sentence. d&#xD;
"What did they say, Mary ?" inquired&#xD;
Mis Dorliff.&#xD;
"That you, my lady-only I'm loath&#xD;
to repeat a lie-that, may-be, you'd mar-&#xD;

When Miss Dorneliff was again alone,&#xD;
he revolved her plans as she paced along&#xD;
ier chamber. For the last three years&#xD;
he had had the sole management and&#xD;
ontrol of her father's affairs, whose age-&#xD;
had, in a great degree, swallowed ul his&#xD;
mind ; and a large property was also at&#xD;
her sole command, which sl    had al-&#xD;
eady inherited from her  eNe. That&#xD;
eight she neither slumbered .nor slept;&#xD;
repose came not to her body or her&#xD;
spirit ; and from the highest window of&#xD;
the dwelling, she watched until she saw&#xD;
Sir John's equipage, with, his troop ofd&#xD;
noisy retainers, pass the great gate on its&#xD;
way to W----. She then ordered her&#xD;
own carriage, and in a little time was at&#xD;
Clavis Abbey. The first person she in-&#xD;
quired for was Mary, and doubtless she&#xD;
derived some information from .her, for&#xD;
they were long together. She then pro-&#xD;
ceeded to Lady Clavis's dressing-room,&#xD;
and found her in tears."&#xD;
" I can not tell why," said she, but&#xD;
I feel a sad anticipation of evil hanging&#xD;
over me. It was so strange, John kissed&#xD;
me this morning when he thought I was&#xD;
asleep; and, do you know, he attempted&#xD;
to kneel at Madelina's cradle but he&#xD;
rushed, like a madman, from the room,&#xD;
despite my efforts to recall him."' o&#xD;

the spot, might dare to think' for they&#xD;
selves. Besides, I can only go und&#xD;
the protection of a matron, you knoi&#xD;
No interruption ; I must be obeyed ; w&#xD;
will set off this afternoon, so as to he&#xD;
his maiden speech from the hustings."&#xD;
Lady Clavis offered a very weak o&#xD;
position to what her heart longed to e&#xD;
gage in, and they arrived in W-.-&#xD;
about half past ten at night. The litt&#xD;
Madelina was left in Mary's care at th&#xD;
Abbey.&#xD;
There was no difficulty in finding th&#xD;
inn, or, as it was called, hotel, where t h&#xD;
Orange member put up ; for he ha&#xD;
steadily refused going to the house of an&#xD;
of his constituents.&#xD;
The waiters immediately recognize&#xD;
Lady Clavis, and, with many bows, con&#xD;
ducted her into the passage, which wa&#xD;
empty at the time, though the sounds o&#xD;
music, singing, and loud debate, wer&#xD;
clearly distinguished by the ladies,- eve&#xD;
before they alighted from their carriage&#xD;
" You can show us to a sitting-room&#xD;
where we can wait'till Sir John is disen&#xD;
gaged. We wish to surprise him," sail&#xD;
MissDorncliff.&#xD;
"'I can't tell him ye're here just-now&#xD;
my lady," replied the man, "for M-r&#xD;
Dacey said they war not to be disturbed;&#xD;
and there's two gentlemen, I'm thinkin&#xD;
from Dublin, besides two or three others&#xD;
waitin' to get speakin' with him. And&#xD;
it's myself don't know where to put&#xD;
y'er ladyships, barrin' ye'll go into a&#xD;
ptirty tidy room jist off where his hon-&#xD;
our's settlin' ,a little affair of business&#xD;
with Mr. Dacey. Sure, if I'd known&#xD;
you war comm', it's the great grand&#xD;
committee-place I'd have redied for ye."&#xD;
"Be firm and cautious now, my dear&#xD;
friend, for the hour of trial is come," ob-&#xD;
served Miss Dorncliff in French, as she&#xD;
pressed her friend's arm closely to her&#xD;
heart ;---" the men from Dublin, and all:&#xD;
we have just arrived in the right time--&#xD;
you may depend upon it, all will be&#xD;
well."                            ,&#xD;
The waiter stared with stupid aston-&#xD;
ishment, and said, "May-be ye'd have&#xD;
the goodness, my lady, not to speak out&#xD;
much, as Sir John's at business in the&#xD;
&#xD;
on next.room, and he mightn't like to be&#xD;
m- disturbed ; it 'ill do to tell him by'n by,&#xD;
er won't, it my lady ?  But what'll you&#xD;
w. please to take ?"&#xD;
ye "Nothing, nothing, now," replied&#xD;
ar Miss Dorncliff; for Lady Clavis appeared&#xD;
incapable of either mental or bodily&#xD;
p- exertion. Her friend had revealed to&#xD;
n- her a considerable .portion of her plaps&#xD;
at and anxieties during their brief journey;&#xD;
le and her elegant but weak mind, unable&#xD;
ie to arrive at any conclusion, remained in&#xD;
a state of passive obedience.&#xD;
e   Communicating with the next apart-&#xD;
ie ment was a small door, which, in the-&#xD;
td true Irish fashion, hung very loosely on&#xD;
y its hinges; the cracks and chinks were&#xD;
many ; apd through the principal one&#xD;
d Miss Dorncliff saw Sir John sitting at a&#xD;
- table, his face buried in his hands ; while&#xD;
s Dacey, whose head was approached&#xD;
f close to his,- was talking in a low, eager&#xD;
e tone ; so low that only broken syllables&#xD;
n reached her ear.&#xD;
At last Sir John removed his hands,&#xD;
, and lifting his eyes slowly, while his pale&#xD;
- and sunken features expressed the pain-&#xD;
d ful struggles he endured, said, "It must&#xD;
not be, Dacey ; do youthink I want to&#xD;
insure damnation to my soul ?  What&#xD;
possible difference can it make to you,&#xD;
that you thus stipulate for her destruc-&#xD;
 tion? Men are seldom so desperately&#xD;
wicked without a motive."&#xD;
I   " Hasn't she scorned me, and ordered&#xD;
me out of the room a;, if I was a neagre ?&#xD;
--hasn't she treated me with the con-&#xD;
tempt which a man never forgives ?---.&#xD;
hasn't she      but the short and the&#xD;
long of it is, Sir John, that you know my&#xD;
determination: disgrace her, or disgrace&#xD;
yourself !--disclaim your marriage, or&#xD;
go to jail !-to jail instead of to parlia-&#xD;
ment ,!-to the jail, where Mr. Mahon&#xD;
can point, as he passes it, at the last of&#xD;
,the house of Clavis ! There's the pen&#xD;
and the ink ; I don't force ye ; do as ye&#xD;
please; it's no business of mine.' The&#xD;
fellow pushed some parchments and pa-&#xD;
pers towards the unfortunate baronet,&#xD;
and gathered unto himself a pile of rou-&#xD;
leaus .that were filled with gold, while&#xD;
his eyes gloated and glared on the ago-&#xD;
nized face of his patron ! " Sure,&#xD;
&#xD;
there's no harm in life in keeping a for-&#xD;
eigner like her," continued the brute ;&#xD;
"many has done the same, and will&#xD;
again. Send her back to the 'olive-'&#xD;
groves of Spain,' she's so fond of sing-&#xD;
ing about, and      "&#xD;
" Peace, miscreant !" roared Sir John,&#xD;
in a voice of thunder, quite forgetting&#xD;
the time and place.&#xD;
" Whisht !" exclaimed the coward,&#xD;
"never call names so l6ud-you know&#xD;
I'm y'er best friend. If these sheriff's,&#xD;
officers hear ye, it will be high mass within&#xD;
us all!"&#xD;
The baronet sunk back in a state of&#xD;
stupefaction, and the agent advanced to-&#xD;
wards him, pen in hand. Almost me-&#xD;
chanically Sir John took the little instru-&#xD;
ment in his fingers,-its point touched'&#xD;
the paper: even the letter JL was traced,&#xD;
whemMiss Dorncliff pushed strongly&#xD;
against the door ; and, in the same in-&#xD;
stant, both. Sir John and Dacey were&#xD;
trembling in her presence. For some&#xD;
moments, all parties remained silent-1&#xD;
gazing at each other with such varied ex-&#xD;
pressions, as would be difficult to de-&#xD;
scribe. With the politeness with which&#xD;
Nature has endowed every Irishman,&#xD;
from the prince to the peasant, both push-&#xD;
ed seats towards the young heiress, which&#xD;
she declined ; at last Sir John inquired,&#xD;
as the pen dropped from his fingers, "to&#xD;
what circumstance they were indebted&#xD;
for the honour of her visit ?"&#xD;
"I came, Sir John," she replied--and&#xD;
the first sentence was uttered in a trem-&#xD;
bling voice, which gained strength as she&#xD;
proceeded, " I came to save the, HUs-&#xD;
BAND of my friend, Lady Clavis, from&#xD;
destruction !"&#xD;
Sir John's pride mounted, as he re-&#xD;
plied stiffly and formally, " that he was&#xD;
not aware to what Miss Dorncliff could&#xD;
allude."&#xD;
" Thi , Sir John," she continued,&#xD;
heedless o' his interruption, " is a bad'&#xD;
time for c mpliments ; you were about&#xD;
to sign a p per repudiating your wife, in&#xD;
order that th t bad man' might relieve&#xD;
your prese necessities, and save you&#xD;
from arrest. I -can not now bring for-&#xD;
ward the proofs that I possess, of his1&#xD;
villanies, and the various arts he has'&#xD;
&#xD;
used, to dupe your understanding, while&#xD;
he ruined your property. I pledge my&#xD;
word to do so; and to redeem all, even&#xD;
the little Corner estate, from his clutch-&#xD;
es, if, instead of signing his paper, you&#xD;
will sign mine-and, to relieve your&#xD;
present embarrassment, I will tell down,&#xD;
guinea for guinea, of the money. you are&#xD;
to receive from that person ! Need I&#xD;
say more?  Need I urge the love you&#xD;
have tried ? Need I ask if you will con-&#xD;
sign your child to shame ?   Need I&#xD;
She was interrupted by a loud and&#xD;
piercing shriek from Lady Clavis, as&#xD;
with one strong effort she rushed from&#xD;
the outer room, and threw herself into&#xD;
her husband's arms. He was so unpre-&#xD;
pared, so astonished, that he did not ap-&#xD;
pear able to support hetr, and she sank&#xD;
gradually on her knees; her hands&#xD;
clasped ; her hair falling in heavy masses&#xD;
over her neck and shoulders; and her&#xD;
eyes shining with unnatural brightness,&#xD;
from amid'the bursting tears that flowed&#xD;
incessantly down her cheeks. It is im-&#xD;
possible to describe the mingled look of&#xD;
hope and anxiety with which she re-&#xD;
garded Sir John. Miss Dorneliff ad-&#xD;
vanced to her side ; and, as her tall,&#xD;
commanding figure, towered over the&#xD;
bending form of her friend, she laid her&#xD;
hand on the baronet's arm, and, in a low&#xD;
impressive tone,. said, "Can you look&#xD;
upon and crush her ?" The appeal&#xD;
was decisive. He pressed his wife con-&#xD;
vulsively to his bosom; and, it is no dis-&#xD;
grace to his manhood, to.confess that his&#xD;
tears mingled with her's.&#xD;
" This is all mighty fine," at length&#xD;
exclaimed Dacey, whose vulgar perplex-&#xD;
ity was beginning to subside into assu-&#xD;
rance, "but I don't understand it."&#xD;
" And who supposed that the wallow-&#xD;
ing swine comprehended the sweetness&#xD;
of the ring-dove's note ?" replied Miss&#xD;
Dorneliff, casting upon him a withering&#xD;
look of contempt and scorn.&#xD;
" I don't deserve that from you, Miss,"&#xD;
said the-savage, interpreting the expres-&#xD;
sion of her countenance, " for I meant&#xD;
to help you to a husband."&#xD;
" Sir John Clavis, I call upon you to&#xD;
turn that man out of the room !"~ replied&#xD;

the lady; "let him and his gold vanish&#xD;
and trust for this night to the agency o&#xD;
your wife's friend !"         --&#xD;
Bitter and deep were the curses hi&#xD;
muttered, while depositing the coin it&#xD;
his leather wallet; he would hav&#xD;
formed no unapt representation of Satat&#xD;
preparing baits for sin ; but foiled ever&#xD;
in this effort.&#xD;
"I recommend you, Dacey, to be si&#xD;
lent," said the baronet.&#xD;
"But others won't be so," growled&#xD;
forth the menial, as he retired. He had&#xD;
hardly closed the door, when he reinem&#xD;
oered the papers and parchments he had&#xD;
left on the table, and returned with the&#xD;
view of securing them. Miss Dornclifl&#xD;
had anticipated this - movement ; and,&#xD;
placing her hand firmly on the docu-&#xD;
ments, signified so decidedly her inten-&#xD;
tion of not suffering their removal, that,&#xD;
baffled at all points, he finally withdrew.&#xD;
le could hardly have reached the hall,&#xD;
when the officers, who had been waiting&#xD;
outside, made their appearance, in no&#xD;
very gentle manner, to make good.their&#xD;
seizure. This, however, Miss Dorncliff&#xD;
prevented, by paying the amount de-&#xD;
manded, and the room was soon cleared&#xD;
of such graceless company.&#xD;
" Now, then," said the generous girl,&#xD;
l9oking round her with a happy and&#xD;
cheerful countenance, "now, Sir John,&#xD;
my document must be signed. I claim&#xD;
that as my reward. My own lawyer&#xD;
will settle other matters at some future&#xD;
date," but that must be done before I&#xD;
either slumber or sleep; the physician&#xD;
demands her fee."&#xD;
The baronet seized the pen, which, a&#xD;
short time before, he had taken to per-&#xD;
form-a very different office, and affixed&#xD;
his name to the paper she presented.&#xD;
After placing it within her bosom, she&#xD;
remained some time silent, while the&#xD;
vacillating man was endeavouring to ex-&#xD;
plain his conduct to his wife, who, loving&#xD;
much, forgave all.&#xD;
" It s well," she thought, " that such&#xD;
men should be wedded to such gentle&#xD;
women.. My affection would always&#xD;
expire with my esteem;.but now, she&#xD;
loves and believes, as if he had never&#xD;
been about to ruin her reputation, and to&#xD;
&#xD;
stigmatize for ever their°innocent child !&#xD;
if There must be something mysterious in&#xD;
this love, which I cannot comprehend."&#xD;
e She could, however, comprehend the&#xD;
n depths and sweets of the noblest friend-&#xD;
e ship. Her sleep that night. was, light&#xD;
n and refreshing; and, it was not till the&#xD;
n morning was- far advanced, that the&#xD;
shouts and bustle of an Irish election,&#xD;
- woke her to consciousness, and activity.&#xD;
It is not to be supposed that Dacey's&#xD;
I bad but enterprising spirit, would rest&#xD;
I composedly under detection, and conse-&#xD;
- quent exposure. He conjectured, truly,&#xD;
I that Miss Dorneliff, through .some means,&#xD;
which at present he could only suspect,&#xD;
f had obtained information of his inten-&#xD;
tions, and was prepared to render null&#xD;
and void his basely-earned bargains and&#xD;
nefarious schemes. He was aware that,&#xD;
until the election was over, no investi-&#xD;
gation could be systematically gone into;&#xD;
and he hit upon a cold and villanous de-&#xD;
sign to prevent the inquiry he had so&#xD;
much reason to dread. He knew well&#xD;
the character of the opposing candidate-.&#xD;
a fearless, careless, man-vigorous and&#xD;
imprudent--.&#xD;
-'  -      Jealous of honour,&#xD;
Sudden and quick in quarrel;"&#xD;
who had fought more duels than any&#xD;
man in the county;- and was as often&#xD;
called "Bullet Mahon," as "Barry Ma.&#xD;
hon." He existed only in an atmos-&#xD;
phere of democracy ; and his hot impa-&#xD;
tient aspect, firm tread, blustering voice,&#xD;
and arrogant familiarity, formed a very&#xD;
striking contrast to the polished, weak,&#xD;
but gentlemanly, bearing of Sir John&#xD;
Clavis. It was not at all unlikely that a&#xD;
quarrel would ensue, before the termina-&#xD;
tion of the election, and many had even&#xD;
betted upon it. With the generality of&#xD;
Irishmen, it would have been unavoida-&#xD;
ble. But, though Sir John had. never&#xD;
shown the white feathei-, he was a deci-&#xD;
dledly peaceable man--and was known&#xD;
so to be. Dacey, however, resolved not&#xD;
to trust to chance in the matter, and the&#xD;
morning of the 'second day he was clos-&#xD;
eted with Mahon for nearly an hour,&#xD;
When the candidates appeared on th'e&#xD;
ill-constructed hustings, to greet their&#xD;
respective constituents, it appeared evi-&#xD;
&#xD;
,dent that Mahon was overboiling with&#xD;
iage at some known orsupposed injury.&#xD;
:Sir John's address was mild, and more&#xD;
than usually facetious ; a style better un-&#xD;
derstood and appreciated in England than&#xD;
in the sister island ; he alluded to, with-&#xD;
out exulting at, the favourable state of&#xD;
the poll; and, after a short and cheering&#xD;
exhortation to his friends, resumed his&#xD;
seat.&#xD;
When Mahon prepared to address the&#xD;
crowd, he swang hisbody uneasily from&#xD;
side to side, looking, when wrapt up in&#xD;
his huge white coat, as the personifica-&#xD;
tion of those unhappy polar bears who&#xD;
suffer confinement in our menageries.&#xD;
At last, elevating his right arm, as if&#xD;
threatening total annihilation to all who&#xD;
even differed from him in opinion, he&#xD;
began ,one of'those inflammatory ad-&#xD;
dresses that have been followed up by so&#xD;
many second-rate agitators in modern&#xD;
times; he talked of the distresses of the&#xD;
people, until those who had just eaten a&#xD;
hearty dinner, imagined they were liter-&#xD;
ally starving-and assured them so often&#xD;
that they were in a debased state of bon-&#xD;
dage, that at last they fancied they were&#xD;
sinking under their fetters' weight. "I&#xD;
would have you beware," he said, exert-&#xD;
ing to their utmost power his Stentorian&#xD;
lungs, "I would have you all, green as&#xD;
well as orange, beware of those who&#xD;
would purchase your votes by' bribery !&#xD;
If a man gives a bribe, he will take one!&#xD;
-and I wonder my opponent is not&#xD;
ashamed-I say ashamed-to show his&#xD;
face here, after the conduct he has prac-&#xD;
tised in private."&#xD;
Sir John Clavis called upon Mr. Ma-&#xD;
hon to explain.&#xD;
Mr. Barry Mahon said he did not&#xD;
come there to explain-he came to&#xD;
speak, and speak he would-no descend-&#xD;
ant of an 'ipostor should put him&#xD;
lown-if Sir John Clavis wished for ex-&#xD;
planation, he could seek it elsewhere-if&#xD;
he did not do so, he was a COWARD.&#xD;
The language had grown too violent,&#xD;
or, as the interfering parties called it,&#xD;
"too warm," even for an Irish election;&#xD;
and the friends of both candidates en-&#xD;
deavoured to put an end to it, or, at all&#xD;
events, to conclude it in another place.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Mr. Mahon refused to make any&#xD;
apology, or even give any explanation, it&#xD;
became necessary, according to the re-&#xD;
ceived and approved code of honour, for&#xD;
Sir John Clavis tf send a message to the&#xD;
gentleman who had so grossly insulted&#xD;
him.&#xD;
It was sent, but Clavis so worded it&#xD;
as to leave the matter open to apology.&#xD;
This, however, was not taken'advantage&#xD;
of, and a "meeting" for the next morn-&#xD;
ing was.of course agreed (upon.&#xD;
Since their reconciliation, poor Lady&#xD;
Clavis had been suffering severely from&#xD;
agitation ; her mind and body had re-&#xD;
ceived a severe shock ; and, though the&#xD;
happy termination, through her friend's&#xD;
kind sacrifice, had set her trembling&#xD;
heart at ease, her health had not yet&#xD;
mastered the struggle ; she had been&#xD;
confined to her chamber, unceasingly at-&#xD;
tended by Miss Dorneliff.&#xD;
About seven o'clock on the evening of&#xD;
the distressing quarrel between the can-&#xD;
didates, Lady Clavis had just requested&#xD;
her friend to open the window, that she&#xD;
might feel the breath of heaven on her&#xD;
fevered cheek, even for a few moments;&#xD;
her fine dark eyes were fixed on the&#xD;
setting of a rich autumnal sun, which&#xD;
shed its glories over the scattered houses,&#xD;
and converted them into dwellings of&#xD;
molten gold. She was reclining on a&#xD;
couch formed of the high-backed chairs&#xD;
of the rude apartment, and as her hus-&#xD;
band entered she greeted him with in-&#xD;
quiries as to the state of the poll. Miss&#xD;
Dorncliff thought within herself that he&#xD;
looked pale and agitated, but did not al-&#xD;
lude to the circumstance. He was hard-&#xD;
ly seated, when a servant placed a note&#xD;
in Lady Clavis's hand; she just broke&#xD;
tg wafer, and, glancing at the contents,&#xD;
burst into tears. Sir John perused it&#xD;
with almost the same agitation ; and the&#xD;
intelligence it conveyed was well calcu-&#xD;
lated to excite sorrow, for it said that the&#xD;
little Madelina had been taken danger-&#xD;
ousl~ ill, and Mary Conway, the wr,1-&#xD;
ter, ntreated Lady Clavis, "for God's&#xD;
sake, to come home, if she wished to see&#xD;
the child alive." The mother lost to&#xD;
time in her preparations ; she thought&#xD;
not of herself; and to Sir John, under&#xD;

existing circumstances, her departure&#xD;
was a relief: he kissed' and handed h(&#xD;
into the carriage; the door was shut, an&#xD;
the coachman preparing to drive of&#xD;
when Sir John called to him to stole&#xD;
The evening sun had set, and the night&#xD;
wind was blowing sharply in the horses&#xD;
heads ; the baronet pushed the footma'&#xD;
away, and, unfastening the door, let th&#xD;
steps -down, so that he could kneel upot&#xD;
them-.&#xD;
" Madelina," he said, in a low agitate(&#xD;
tone, and in her own dear native tongue&#xD;
'Madelina, do you, from your heart&#xD;
forgive me, for the. unkindness I havi&#xD;
shown.-for the injury I'would have don&#xD;
you, and our suffering child ?"&#xD;
" My soul's life," she replied, "why&#xD;
do you ask ? I cannot think of you and&#xD;
injury at the same time; from my heart&#xD;
I have forgiven you." She bent her&#xD;
head forward to kiss her husband, and&#xD;
the wind blew one of the long locks of&#xD;
her raven hair across his, face. He&#xD;
seized upon it, as on a treasure.&#xD;
" I must keep this .to wear next my&#xD;
heart till--"  "we meet again," he&#xD;
would have added, but the sentence re-&#xD;
mained unfinished, while he severed the&#xD;
riiglet from the rest; he then extended&#xD;
his hand to Miss Dorneliff, and contin-&#xD;
ued, even in a more broken tone, " You&#xD;
have been her friend,-as well as my pre-&#xD;
server; .I -commit her to your care !"&#xD;
" How kind and affectionate he has&#xD;
grown !" observed Lady Clavis, as the&#xD;
carriage drove on ; " when this dreadful&#xD;
election is over, and our darling recov-&#xD;
ered, we shall be so happy !-and to&#xD;
you, my dear, dear friend-my more&#xD;
than sister-I owe all this: his first love&#xD;
was not so sweet to me as his returning&#xD;
affection ;" and, overcome with many&#xD;
contending feelings, the gentle creature.&#xD;
sank into a troubled sleep.&#xD;
'rhe roads were heavy, and the hum-&#xD;
baring carriage and fatted horses little&#xD;
accustomed to hasty journeyings; they&#xD;
had got on at the rate of three miles, or&#xD;
three miles and a half, the hour, and&#xD;
were within five miles of the Abbey,&#xD;
when their progress was arrested- by a&#xD;
Algure on horseback seizing the reins,&#xD;
and commanding them to stop. "God&#xD;
&#xD;
303 104&#xD;
&#xD;
e be thanked for his marcy!" ejaculated 2&#xD;
r well-known voice, "by his blessin' i&#xD;
d 'ill not be too.late, and he may be saved&#xD;
I', yet."&#xD;
S   " Who saved?-what do you, mean,&#xD;
t- Mary ?" eagerly demanded Miss Dorn.&#xD;
s' cliff, for Lady Clavis was not sufficiently&#xD;
n collected  to make any inquiry, and&#xD;
e only looked wildly from the carriage.&#xD;
n window.&#xD;
"The master ! the master !-turnd&#xD;
d the horses' heads, Leary, as ye value&#xD;
, salvation, or the priest's blessin' !"&#xD;
"Explain first, Mary, for this is mad.&#xD;
e ness," replied Miss Dorneliff; wheree&#xD;
e --how is the child ?"'&#xD;
")Here," she replied, unfolding her&#xD;
cloak, and placing the smiling cherub on&#xD;
l its mother's lap. 64I knew misthress 'ud&#xD;
never believe it was aliveland well, when&#xD;
I hard o' the trick just to get ye all out&#xD;
Io' the way, my lady-and you too,&#xD;
f Miss, who unriddled .so much before&#xD;
that he thought you'd be at it again--&#xD;
the villain! The short an' the long of&#xD;
it is, that ould rascal tould some lies to&#xD;
the other mimber that wants to be, and,&#xD;
on the strength of them lies, him, the&#xD;
other man, insulted master forenent the&#xD;
d people; and they'd a row'; and the up-&#xD;
shot of it is that they're io fight a jewil&#xD;
to-morrow morning-Lord save us-like&#xD;
Turks- or Frenchmen;. and 'twas he&#xD;
wrote the note-as one let on to me,&#xD;
who rode a good horse to tell it-and,&#xD;
troth, grass didn't grow \mnder my feet&#xD;
either. But turn, turn !-we'll may-be&#xD;
get a help of horses on the road ; I'll&#xD;
gallop on and have 'em ready, though it's&#xD;
as much as we can to reach town by&#xD;
day-light."&#xD;
The servants urged the jaded animals{&#xD;
to their utmost speed ; and  prayers&#xD;
mingled with the tears Lady Clavis shed&#xD;
as she pressed her child to her bosom.&#xD;
Miss Dorncliff endeavoured to give what&#xD;
shze did not possess--hope. She knew&#xD;
that Barry Mahon's bullet was unerring;&#xD;
and, from time to time, she let down the&#xD;
front glass to cheer forward the anxious&#xD;
coachiman. The horses Mary procured&#xD;
on the road were more a hindrance than&#xD;
a help, so restive and ignorant were they&#xD;
as to carriage-harness. Never did cul-&#xD;

The Last of the Line.&#xD;
&#xD;
prits, who watch for, yet dread, the&#xD;
coming day, feel more bitterly than they&#xD;
did when the first thin stream of light&#xD;
appeared on the horizon ; the stars, one&#xD;
by one, faded from their gaze ; and at&#xD;
last-the spire of the church of W&#xD;
appeared like a dark speck on. the clear-&#xD;
ing sky.&#xD;
"Forward, forward, my good Leary !"&#xD;
said Miss Dorncliff; "'t ere's the church-&#xD;
steeple-hasten now, and reward   all&#xD;
not be wanting. '/&#xD;
"It isn't the reward-it's the ~st ier&#xD;
I'm thinking of," replied the faithf1e -&#xD;
low. "If we had the luck to be on the&#xD;
Dublin road itself, there'd be some chance&#xD;
of help; but here---"    He groaned&#xD;
audibly; and, by words of encourage-&#xD;
ment, and a more liberal application of&#xD;
the whip, forced the horses -into some-&#xD;
thing like a trot.&#xD;
"I can see the masts of the vessels&#xD;
that are lying in the harbour," exclaimed&#xD;
Mary ; " for God's sakehasten, Leary !"&#xD;
"I may as well throw down the-reins,"&#xD;
replied Leary ; " they can only crawl;&#xD;
this one's sides are cut with the whip,i&#xD;
and'that one's fallen lame, too !"&#xD;
" I could walk faster than the horses&#xD;
can go now," said Miss Dorncliff.&#xD;
"And so could I, and we will walk,"&#xD;
replied Lady Clavis, rousing all her en-&#xD;
ergies.&#xD;
"Do, do, my dearest friend," retorted&#xD;
Miss Dorncliff, " for I see figures on the&#xD;
bridge that cannot be mistaken ; and if&#xD;
we could only get there in time, all could&#xD;
be explained."&#xD;
Lady Clavis sprung from the carriage&#xD;
with a promptness that astonished her&#xD;
friend. She folded her chil'losely to&#xD;
her bosom, and' took the path across&#xD;
some meadows, which led, by a nearer&#xD;
way than the carriage-road, to the field&#xD;
that for centuries had been the duellist's&#xD;
meeting-place. The agony of her mind&#xD;
may be .imagined, but cannot be de-&#xD;
scribed. There was her liusband-eve-&#xD;
ry step rendered him more visible-she&#xD;
pressed .onward-and her .child was&#xD;
rocked by -the panting of her bosom.,&#xD;
The ground is measured-she flew with-&#xD;
out disturbing the dew that trembled on&#xD;
the grass; repeatedly she raised and&#xD;
&#xD;
'- - --&#xD;
&#xD;
.,&#xD;
&#xD;
f the Line.                       3-6&#xD;
waved her arm, eager to arrest attention&#xD;
-it was in vain!&#xD;
Man to man stood opposed-not in&#xD;
spirited combat, but with cold murdering&#xD;
designs on each other. She screamed&#xD;
loud and fearfully, and her scream was&#xD;
answered by a fiendish, laugh, which&#xD;
seemed to proceed from the hollow of a&#xD;
blighted tree that stood in her pathway ;&#xD;
as she passed it, the bad face of Dacey&#xD;
glared upon her with bitter exultation.&#xD;
She shrank involuntarily from his ken,&#xD;
and the report of a pistol struck upon&#xD;
her ear with appalling distinctness ; it&#xD;
was followed by another, and the next&#xD;
moment saw her kneeling by the side of&#xD;
him h  m she had loved with all the fer-&#xD;
vour of the glowing south, and all the&#xD;
fidelity of our colder climes ; the inno-&#xD;
cent baby crept from her arms over his&#xD;
bosom, and pressed her little lips to, those&#xD;
of her dead father. Lady Mla'vis mo-&#xD;
tioned off the people, who wished to re-&#xD;
move the body, and with fearful calmness&#xD;
unbuttoned the bosom of his shirt, and&#xD;
looked intently on the wound, and the&#xD;
oozing blood. :She attempted to unfasten&#xD;
it still more, but started back as if some&#xD;
new horror had been displayed,. when&#xD;
the tress of hair he had severed from her&#xD;
head the night before, appeared literally&#xD;
resting on his heart. Tears did not dim&#xD;
her eyes, which became fixed and mo-&#xD;
tionless ; and her whole figure assumed&#xD;
a frightful rigidity. The scene was even&#xD;
too much for Ellen Dorneliff's firmness;&#xD;
she fainted while endeavouring to take&#xD;
the child from the remains of its ill-&#xD;
starred parent.&#xD;
"IT'S THE LAST "OF THE LINE, sure&#xD;
enough," exclaimed an old ke er, who&#xD;
had watched the whole melancho pro-&#xD;
ceeding ; " for a girl, and such a gi1, if&#xD;
report says tr , has no hoult the&#xD;
land-ill got, il gone !"&#xD;
-My tale is told, and many will recog&#xD;
nize it as over true. Lady Clavis's in-&#xD;
tellect never recovered the shock it re-&#xD;
ceived, and some years afterwards she&#xD;
died in a convent in Catalonia. The&#xD;
property .of Clavis passed into other&#xD;
hands and those who obtained it were&#xD;
~generous and honourable enough to set-&#xD;
tie upon Lady Clavis ana ner child a&#xD;

been legal proof of the marriage, which&#xD;
it was generally supposed could not be&#xD;

was the evidence she had collected of&#xD;
Dacey'svillany, that he was never suf-&#xD;

THE TWO'&#xD;
&#xD;
BY T. S.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Goon morning, Mrs. Hinton," said&#xD;
Martha Green, lifting her head, as a visit-&#xD;
er entered the room in which she sat,&#xD;
busily engaged in sewing, "You see&#xD;
that I am full of work."&#xD;
" So you seem to be," was the quiet&#xD;
reply. " But I suppose you can spare&#xD;
to-night, for a work of mercy ?"&#xD;
" How a work of mercy, Mrs. Hin-&#xD;
ton !"&#xD;
" Poor old Mrs. Benderis very ill-so&#xD;
ill that she cannot be left alone any length&#xD;
of time. I have been up with her two&#xD;
nights in succession, and am now looking&#xD;
nor one or two young ladies who will&#xD;
take charge of her to-night. Can I de-&#xD;
pend on you ?"&#xD;
"Not to-night, Mrs. Hinton, it would&#xD;
be impossible ! It will take me till twelve&#xD;
to-night, and the most part of to-morrow,&#xD;
to finish this dress, which I must wear&#xD;
20&#xD;
&#xD;
long-;" and Miss Dornclif-who was a&#xD;
living refutation of all the scandal ever&#xD;
heaped upon that most injured and most-&#xD;
respectable class of persons called old&#xD;
maids-received, in her declining age,&#xD;
more than even a child's attention from&#xD;
Madelina Clavis.  Some years subse,&#xD;
quent to the incidents I have detailed, the&#xD;
papers, with all due ceremony, an-&#xD;
nounced that excellent and interesting&#xD;
young lady's marriage with-the next heir&#xD;
to an earldom.&#xD;
MA IDE NS&#xD;
ARTHUR.&#xD;
at Mrs. Corrie's party to-morrow even-&#xD;
ing.--Any other time I would go with'&#xD;
pleasure."&#xD;
"I am really sorry for that. I have&#xD;
been to two or three this morning, and,&#xD;
all have declined on account of this par-&#xD;
ty."&#xD;
" Hannah Ball can go as readily as not,&#xD;
Mrs. Hinton. She had her new dress,&#xD;
made at the mantua-maker's."&#xD;
" I have seen Hannah."&#xD;
"Does she decline ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
" That's very strange. What reason&#xD;
does she give ?"&#xD;
"She says, that if she were to sit up&#xD;
to-night, it would ruin her appearance&#xD;
to-morrow evening. That it would make&#xD;
her look dreadful."&#xD;
" There is something in that, you&#xD;
know yourself, Mrs. Hinton. Loss of&#xD;
&#xD;
rest has the same effect upon me. I&#xD;
don't look fit to be seen for two or three&#xD;
days after losing a night's sleep."&#xD;
"Yes, I know that sitting up does not&#xD;
improve the looks much," Mrs. Hinton&#xD;
gravely remarked; and then, after paus-&#xD;
ing a few moments, got up, and said, asi&#xD;
she moved towards the door-&#xD;
"Well, I must bid.you good morning,&#xD;
Martha, time is passing, and I must find&#xD;
some one who will relieve me, or I shall&#xD;
get sick myself."&#xD;
" I do hope you will," Martha said, in&#xD;
a tone of concern. " Were I not situ-&#xD;
ated just as I am, I should go with plea-&#xD;
sure 1"&#xD;
And then the visiter went away. Af-&#xD;
ter her departure, Martha Green sat&#xD;
thoughtfully for some minutes. She did&#xD;
not feel altogether satisfied with herself,&#xD;
and yet, on reflection she could not see&#xD;
any cause for self-condemnation. Sin-'&#xD;
cerely did she pity the condition of poor&#xD;
old Mrs. Bender, who was nearly seven-&#xD;
ty years of age, sick, and without any&#xD;
one in the world up to whom she could&#xD;
look and claim, from consanguinity, a&#xD;
single kind office. "But it was impos-&#xD;
sible for her to go," she reasoned ; in&#xD;
the effort to quiet her uneasy feelings,&#xD;
"under the circumstances-utterly im-&#xD;
possible."&#xD;
Still she sat thoughtful, without re-&#xD;
suming her needle. At length she&#xD;
aroused herself with the half audible re-&#xD;
mark-&#xD;
"Somebody will go, of course"-andl&#xD;
that settled the matter.&#xD;
It was, perhaps, an hour after, that a&#xD;
yound friend, and confidant, dropped in&#xD;
to sit an hour with Martha. The conversa-&#xD;
tion run, of course, on the party to be held&#xD;
at Mrs. Corrie's on the next evening.&#xD;
"You will look beautiful in this dress,"&#xD;
the friend remarked, lifting a portion of&#xD;
the garment upon which Martha was at&#xD;
work, in her hand. " It suits your com-&#xD;
plexion admirably; besides being of a&#xD;
rich material, and attractive, yet -appro-&#xD;
priate, and not too gaudy in color."&#xD;
" I am glad you think so," Martha re-&#xD;
plhed, with a smile of satisfaction. "I&#xD;
don't believe there will be anything half&#xD;
so elegant at the party."&#xD;

"There will at'least be one dress&#xD;
there that will fully equal it," the visiter&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"Are you sure ?" in a tone of disap-&#xD;
pointment.&#xD;
" Yes. As I came along this morn-&#xD;
ing, on my way here, I dropped in to see&#xD;
Ellen Willard, and found her at work as&#xD;
you are upon her own dress. She has&#xD;
certainly selected it with.exquisite taste.&#xD;
Much as I admire yours, I should prefer&#xD;
the one she has chosen. 'She 'wil at-&#xD;
tract much attention, of course, for you&#xD;
know that she is a girl of a great deal of&#xD;
taste, and knows how to dress to the&#xD;
very best advantage."&#xD;
This intelligence had the effect to&#xD;
change, naturally the tone of Martha's&#xD;
feelings. As far as was in her power,&#xD;
she concealed this change from her friend,&#xD;
but after she'had left, her countenance ex-&#xD;
pressed much concern. The reason was&#xD;
this. A young man named Alton, had&#xD;
paid her a good many attentions, in the&#xD;
last few months, and of such a marked&#xD;
kind, that she had suffered her affections&#xD;
to become a good deal interested.-The&#xD;
extent of this interest had not become&#xD;
apparent to herself, until within a week&#xD;
or two, during, which time, she thought&#xD;
that she perceived a slight change in his&#xD;
manner towards her, united with, on two&#xD;
or three occasions, a perceptible prefer-&#xD;
ence for the company of Ellen Willard.&#xD;
One reason for her being unusually desi-&#xD;
rous of making, if.possible, the very best,&#xD;
appearance at the party of Mrs. Corrie,&#xD;
was to fix agaip the wavering regard of&#xD;
Mr. Alton. To learn, then, that Ellen&#xD;
was likely to equal, if not to eclipse her,&#xD;
was no very pleasant information, and it&#xD;
troubled her in spite of every effort to&#xD;
rally her feelings.&#xD;
Time passed, and the evening came-&#xD;
for the-anticipated company. Martha&#xD;
was there early, dressed with the most&#xD;
scrupulous regard to effect, yet tastefally&#xD;
in every respect. Alton came in perhaps&#xD;
half an hour after. The maid's heart~&#xD;
bounded as she saw him enter, while the&#xD;
soft tint of her cheek, delicate as the rose&#xD;
blossom, deepened its hrie. The eye of&#xD;
the young man glanced around the bril-&#xD;
liantly lighted room, evidently in search&#xD;

&#xD;
of some one, and then he seated himself&#xD;
alone, as if disappointed, and again slow-&#xD;
ly surveyed the company. 'Of course he&#xD;
did not fail to notice Martha Green. In&#xD;
a little while others made their appear-&#xD;
ance, and soon he found himself by the&#xD;
side of one of his most intimate friends.&#xD;
" Did you ever see Martha Green&#xD;
look so beautiful ?".=he said to this young&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"Where is she? Oh, yes-I see. Real-&#xD;
ly, she is a superb looking woman."&#xD;
"Isn't she ? But there is one whom I&#xD;
expect here to-night, that, if I am not&#xD;
mistaken,.will eclipse her."&#xD;
" Who is she?"&#xD;
"Ellen Willard."&#xD;
"There she is now. Look at her, and&#xD;
then yield the palm at once to Miss Green.&#xD;
Really, I never-saw Ellen look so indif-&#xD;
ferent in all my life,"&#xD;
Alton turned his eyes towards the&#xD;
door, and sure enough there was Ellen,&#xD;
plainly dressed, though neat, and her face&#xD;
wearing an expression of weariness. It&#xD;
was a moment or two before he spoke,&#xD;
and then he said, in a tone of disappoint-&#xD;
ment,&#xD;
" As you say, I never saw her look so&#xD;
indifferent in my life. Still, she is a&#xD;
sweet girl, even though eclipsed to-night,&#xD;
in every way, by Martha Green."&#xD;
"Theycertainly will not bear a com-&#xD;
parison," responded the friend.&#xD;
Martha Green, who was sitting beside&#xD;
the friend and confidant mentioned as&#xD;
having called on her the day before, had&#xD;
been glancing uneasily towards the door,.&#xD;
every time it opened to admit some new&#xD;
comer, and was among the first to per-&#xD;
ceive Ellen.&#xD;
"0 dear! If that is all, no one here,&#xD;
need fear being thrown into the shade&#xD;
to-night," was her exulting remark.&#xD;
"'Why I thought you told me that she&#xD;
was at work on a dress even more beauti-&#xD;
ful than mine ?"&#xD;
"So she was," replied her friend.&#xD;
"And I cannot for my life tell why she&#xD;
'has not worn it."&#xD;
"She could not get it done, Isuppose."&#xD;
" Perhaps not. There was a good&#xD;
deal to do on it when I saw her. Indeed&#xD;
she had just commenced working on it."&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
"Do you not know that I am right&#xD;
down glad of it ?" Martha said.&#xD;
"No-why ?"&#xD;
"Because, if she had come out in her&#xD;
very best style this evening, I am very&#xD;
much afraid Mr. Alton would have been&#xD;
too much pleased with her."&#xD;
"Indeed ! I thought he was paying al-&#xD;
most exclusive attention to you."&#xD;
" So I have flattered myself until&#xD;
within the last, week or two, when he&#xD;
has seemed to grow a little more atten-&#xD;
tive to Ellen than is agreeable to me."&#xD;
"You have nothing to fear to-night,&#xD;
Martha, just see! She has that old dress,&#xD;
worn by her at the last-half dozen par-&#xD;
ties. And instead of her usual brilliant&#xD;
complexion, her skin looks sallow, and&#xD;
her cheeks pale; and her whole face has&#xD;
a dull lifeless expression. What on&#xD;
earth can be the matter? Something&#xD;
has happened, no doubt, to prevent her&#xD;
from getting that dress done, which has&#xD;
worried her so much as to spoil her very&#xD;
face. And see, with what .a look Mr.&#xD;
Alton is now regarding her."&#xD;
" Yes, I see ; and what is more, I see&#xD;
that I am safe."&#xD;
In a few minutes after, Alton took a&#xD;
seat beside Martha, cured, as he thought,&#xD;
of the evident preference which had- re-&#xD;
cently existed in his mind for Ellen Wil-&#xD;
lard, over her anxious rival. This pref-&#xD;
erence had not been so distinct as to have&#xD;
been founded upon any serious compari-&#xD;
son made in his mind between the in-&#xD;
trinsic claims to estimation, which the&#xD;
two young ladies presented; it was rather&#xD;
a leaning towards Ellen, without reflect-&#xD;
ing upon the reason why she seemed&#xD;
more interesting to him than Martha.&#xD;
Of course, it required but a trifle to&#xD;
change that state of mind. He now re-&#xD;
newed his attentions to Martha Greeh,&#xD;
with even more than his former assiduity,&#xD;
t~o th'e entire neglect of Jgllen Willard,&#xD;
who retired at a very early hour. -&#xD;
Towards the close of the evening, he&#xD;
sat near Mrs. Hinton, who was present,&#xD;
and two or three ladies who were con-&#xD;
versing.--The name of Ellen mentioned&#xD;
by. one of them, attracted his attention.&#xD;
" Ellen did not look like herself to-&#xD;
night," was remarked by one.&#xD;
&#xD;
"No," said another, "I never saw her&#xD;
make a more indifferent. appearance.&#xD;
And she was, besides, very dull while&#xD;
she remained, and h'as left the room at an&#xD;
unusually early hour. What can be the&#xD;
matter with her ?"&#xD;
"She is not very well," Mrs.-Hinton&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"«But even that does not account for&#xD;
the want of taste and effect in her dress,&#xD;
two things that are always regarded by&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"I think that I can explain it all," re-&#xD;
plied Mrs. Hinton, smiling.&#xD;
Alton listened very attentively to what&#xD;
followed, although it was not intended for&#xD;
his ears. lie sat near enough to hear all&#xD;
that was said without making any effort&#xD;
so to do--and he was too much interest-&#xD;
ed to get up, and move to another part of&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
"Well, what is the reason ?" asked&#xD;
two or three of the ladies.&#xD;
" It is a very plain case,"  esumed&#xD;
Mi-s. Hinton. "Most of you k ow old&#xD;
Mrs. Bender. On calling to  e her a&#xD;
few days ago, I found her very ill, and in&#xD;
need of nourishment and attention. She&#xD;
is very old, and lives entirely by herself.&#xD;
In the condition that I found her, it would&#xD;
have been cruel to have left her alone for&#xD;
any length of time. For two nights I&#xD;
remained with her myself, not wishing to&#xD;
trouble any one else, and being in the&#xD;
hope every day that she would get much&#xD;
better. Yesterday I found myself so&#xD;
much fatigued from the loss of rest, that&#xD;
I was compelled to seek for some one&#xD;
who would relieve me. Accordingly I&#xD;
called upon several young ladies, and&#xD;
asked their assistance. But some, like&#xD;
Martha Green had their hands so full in&#xD;
making up dresses for this evening, that&#xD;
they could not possibly sit up--while&#xD;
others were afraid that the- loss of a&#xD;
Night's rest would entirely unfit them to&#xD;
Enjoy this pleasant company. Any oth-&#xD;
Ser time, one and all would have come&#xD;
Forward cheerfully for the sake of _old&#xD;
SMrs. Bender. With a feeling of discou-&#xD;
ragement, I called in to see Ellen, and&#xD;
found her busily engaged on one of the&#xD;
sweetest dresses I have ever seen. It&#xD;
was to have been worn this evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
"  - "Busy, too," I remarked, as I sat&#xD;
down by her side, with a feeling that my&#xD;
search for a sitter-up would prove fruit-&#xD;
less.&#xD;
"I am busy, Mrs. Hinton," was her&#xD;
reply, "but not so busy, I hope, but what&#xD;
I can oblige you."&#xD;
" Instinctively, it seems, had she per-&#xD;
ceived, from my tone of vice, that I had&#xD;
a request to make, which her heart&#xD;
prompted her at once to grant, if in her&#xD;
power.&#xD;
"I am rather afraid, Ellen, that you&#xD;
are too much engaged for what 1 wish&#xD;
you to do. This beautiful dress is for&#xD;
to-morrow evening, I suppose ?"&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
"And is just commenced, I see."&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
"And, of course, will keep you busy&#xD;
to-night and to-morrow."&#xD;
" I shall not, certainly, have much time&#xD;
to spare," was her reply. "But what is&#xD;
it that you wish me to do ?"&#xD;
"I did wish you to sit up with old Mrs.&#xD;
Bender, who is very ill."&#xD;
" To-night ?"&#xD;
"Yes. I have been to six or seven&#xD;
young ladies, but not one can go. I have&#xD;
been up for two successive nights myself,&#xD;
and feel quite worn out."&#xD;
"Is Mrs. Bender very ill ?" she in-&#xD;
quired, in.a voice of sympathy and con-&#xD;
cern.&#xD;
"For a few moments Ellen sat thought-&#xD;
ful, and then said, with a cheerful smile,&#xD;
"I will go over to-night and sit up with&#xD;

"But you cannot finish this dress, and&#xD;
do so," I said.&#xD;
"I know that, Mrs. Hinton. But Mrs.&#xD;
Bender needs my kind attentions a great&#xD;
deal more than I need this dress, ,much&#xD;
as I have desired to appear in it to-mor-&#xD;
row evening, and much as I need a gen-&#xD;
teel dress-for such an occasion. But I&#xD;
had rather go with a calm consciousness&#xD;
of having done mny duty, than, without&#xD;
it, to appear in thie attire of a queen."&#xD;
" The dear girl spoke with an earnest-&#xD;
ness that made her cheek glow and her&#xD;
eye brighten. I thought that I had never&#xD;
seen her face wear so lovely an expres-&#xD;
sion. True to her resolution, she went&#xD;

over to Mrs. Bender's, and remained with&#xD;
her all night.. Her dress could not, of&#xD;
course, be finished, and that was not all.&#xD;
An attack of sick head-ache was the con-&#xD;
sequence, the effects of which upon her&#xD;
appearance, you all observed to-night."&#xD;
"Admirable girl !" murmured Alton to&#xD;
himself, as Mrs. Hinton ceased speaking.&#xD;
" How far more beautiful is a truly good,&#xD;
self-sacrificing action, than all the exte-&#xD;
rior graces that art can put on."&#xD;
As he said this he looked up, and his&#xD;
eye fell upon the belle of the evening,&#xD;
Martha Green. But, like magic, faded&#xD;

&#xD;
A TALE FROM&#xD;
&#xD;
r;&#xD;
&#xD;
ARMAND D'APREMONT had entered the&#xD;
navy at a very early age, and had arrived,,&#xD;
although very young, to the dignity of&#xD;
a captain. He had amassed a large for-&#xD;
tune, in addition to his patrimonial es-&#xD;
tates, and he had now come home to rest&#xD;
after his -labors. As yet, however, he&#xD;
was a single man, and moreover had&#xD;
laughed at love.&#xD;
But when he saw Nathalie, his opin-&#xD;
ions underwent a change. He inquired&#xD;
-" Who is that pretty woman who dan-&#xD;
ces so well ?"&#xD;
"That is Madame de Hautville. Is&#xD;
she not handsome, captain ?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes-she is perfect."&#xD;
" Yes, and she has as many graces of&#xD;
mind as of body. Ask her to dance in&#xD;
the next set, and you will find I am&#xD;
right."&#xD;
"Ah ! but I do not dance."&#xD;
And for the first time in his life he re&#xD;
&#xD;
310&#xD;
&#xD;
all her exterior loveliness as he compared&#xD;
it with the moral beauty of the other.&#xD;
He sought not her side again, and left the&#xD;
company as soon as he could do so with&#xD;
propriety.&#xD;
The next evening found him at the&#xD;
dwelling of Ellen, in whose every look and&#xD;
tone, he now perceived a new attraction,&#xD;
and in every movement a new grace.&#xD;
He soon yielded his heart to the power&#xD;
of virtues nuperceived and unfelt before;&#xD;
virtues, whose bloom and fragrance time&#xD;
nor change can steal away.&#xD;
ECRET.&#xD;
THE FRENCH.&#xD;
grettea that he had never learned to&#xD;
dance ; but he kept his eyes constantly&#xD;
fixed on Nathalie.&#xD;
Nathalie perceived this, although she&#xD;
pretended not to take any notice of him.&#xD;
"What fun it would be," said'Ast, "to&#xD;
make that man fall in love with me ;&#xD;
him who never speaks to a lady."&#xD;
His attentions to a young widow soon&#xD;
became the subject of general conversa.&#xD;
tion, and several of'his friends said to&#xD;
d'Apremont-t-" Take care ! Madame de&#xD;
Hautville is a coquette. She will amuse&#xD;
herself with you for a while, and then&#xD;
cast you off."&#xD;
At last, the report of Nathalie's new&#xD;
conquest reached the ears of M. d'Ablain-.&#xD;
court, and one evening, when lNathalie&#xD;
mentioned to her uncle that, she expect-&#xD;
ed the captain to spend the evening&#xD;
with her, the old man grew almost angry.&#xD;
" Nathalie," said he, " you act entirely&#xD;
&#xD;
The Secret.&#xD;
&#xD;
.:__.&#xD;
&#xD;
41&#xD;
&#xD;
without consulting me. I have heard that&#xD;
the captain is very rude and unpolished&#xD;
in his manners. To be sure I have only&#xD;
seenhim standing behind your chair ;&#xD;
but he has never even asked after my&#xD;
health. I only speak for yours interest,&#xD;
as you are giddy."_&#xD;
Nathalie begged her uncle's pardon for&#xD;
her inconsiderateness in acting on her&#xD;
own responsibility, and even offered&#xD;
not to receive the captain's visits, if&#xD;
her uncle desired it, but' this he fore-&#xD;
bore to require-secretly resolving .not&#xD;
to allow his visits to become too fre-&#xD;
quent.&#xD;
But how frail are all human resolu-&#xD;
tions,-overturned by the merest trifle.&#xD;
In this case, the game of backgammon&#xD;
was the unconscious cause of Nathalie's&#xD;
becoming Madame d'Apremont.&#xD;
The captain was an excellent hand&#xD;
at backgammon. When the uncle heard&#xD;
this, he proposed a game ; and as the cap-'&#xD;
tain understood that it was important to&#xD;
gain the uncle's favor, readily acceded.&#xD;
This did not please Nathalie. She&#xD;
preferred that he should be occupied with&#xD;
herself. When all the company were&#xD;
gone she turned -to her uncle, saying-&#xD;
"You were right, uncle, after all.  I&#xD;
do not admire the captain's manners ; 1&#xD;
see now that I should not have invited&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"On the contrary, niece, he is a very&#xD;
well behaved man. I have invited him&#xD;
to, come here very often, and play back-&#xD;
gammon with me-that is-to pay his&#xD;
addresses to you."&#xD;
Nathalie saw that the captain had gain-.&#xD;
ed her uncle's heart, and she forgave him&#xD;
for having been less attentive to her. He&#xD;
soon came again, and, thanks to the&#xD;
backgammon, increased in favor with the&#xD;
uncle.&#xD;
He soon captivated the heart of the&#xD;
pretty widow, also. One morning, Na-&#xD;
thalie came blushing to her uncle.&#xD;
" The captain has asked me to marry&#xD;
him. What do you advise me to do ?"&#xD;
He reflected for a few moments. "If&#xD;
she refuses him, d'Apremont will come&#xD;
here no longer, and then no more -back-&#xD;
Sgammon. But if she marries him, he&#xD;
Swill be here always and I shall have my&#xD;
&#xD;
s                                                     '44 y4f&#xD;

40&#xD;
&#xD;
G&#xD;
,L ,&#xD;
&#xD;
t'&#xD;
&#xD;
games."  And the answer was-" You&#xD;
had better marry him."&#xD;
Nathalie really loved Armand; but she&#xD;
would not yield so easily. She sent for&#xD;
the captain.&#xD;
" If you really did love me"- -&#xD;
" Ah, can you doubt it ?"&#xD;
" Hush ! do not interrupt me. If you&#xD;
really love me, you, will give me one&#xD;
proof of, it."&#xD;
" Any thing you ask, I swear"-&#xD;
"n No, you must not swear any more ;&#xD;
and -one thing more, you must never&#xD;
smoke. I -detest the smell of tobacco,&#xD;
and I will not have a husband who&#xD;
smokes."&#xD;
Armand sighed, but answered-" I&#xD;
will submit to any thing you require. 1&#xD;
will smoke no longer."&#xD;
The wedding was soon celebrated ;&#xD;
and when they appeared, afterwards, in&#xD;
the ay world, the surprise was great&#xD;
thathe coquette should have married a&#xD;
sailor. _ The first month of their mar-&#xD;
riage passed very smoothly ; but some-&#xD;
times Armand became thoughtful, restless&#xD;
and grave; Nathalie, for a while, did not&#xD;
notice-it.&#xD;
After some time these fits of sadness&#xD;
became more frequent.&#xD;
" What is the matter ?" asked Natha-&#xD;
lie, one day, on seeing him stamp with&#xD;
impatience.-" Why are you so irrita-&#xD;
ble ?"&#xD;
"Nothing-nothing at all !" replied the&#xD;
captain, as if ashamed of his ill-humor.&#xD;
"Tell me if I have displeased you in&#xD;
any thing."&#xD;
The captain assured her that he had&#xD;
no cause to be any thing but delighted&#xD;
with her conduct on all occasions, and&#xD;
for a time no angry expression escaped&#xD;
him; but it soon returned. Nathalie&#xD;
was distressed beyond measure. ' She&#xD;
imparted her anxiety to her uncle, who&#xD;
replied,&#xD;
" Yes, my dear, I know what you&#xD;
mean ; I have often remarked it myself&#xD;
at back-gammon."&#xD;
"My dear uncle, what can the matter be:&#xD;
-I wish he would confide hi~ distresses&#xD;
to me."&#xD;
" There are some things a man cannot&#xD;
confide even to his wife."&#xD;

" Not even to his wife ! I should like&#xD;
my husband to conceal nothing from me.&#xD;
I cannot be happy otherwise."&#xD;
M. d'Abraincourt-promised to endeav-&#xD;
or to discover the mystery ; but he satis-&#xD;
fied himself with playing back-gammon&#xD;
with the captain every day.&#xD;
It was now summer, and the family&#xD;
left Paris for a pretty .country seat be.&#xD;
longing to the captain, in the neighbor-&#xD;
hood of Fountainbleau.&#xD;
D'Apremont seemed very happy in&#xD;
the society of his wife and' always&#xD;
anxious to please, but he left her&#xD;
every afternoon for about two hours,&#xD;
and at his return appeared very gay and&#xD;
lively.&#xD;
Nevertheless, his wife was not satisfied.&#xD;
She said to herself-" My husband is&#xD;
certainly happier than lie used to be in&#xD;
Paris ; but where can he go, every day&#xD;
in that mysterious way all alone, and&#xD;
without mentioning where he has been.&#xD;
I shall never be happy till .1 fathom this&#xD;
to the bottom."&#xD;
Sometimes she-thought of following him&#xD;
when he left the house, which he regu-&#xD;
larly did at the same hour, sometimes&#xD;
even when the house was filled with&#xD;
company; but then to secure the ser-&#xD;
vants in her confidence, and to act as a&#xD;
spy upon one who was so habitually&#xD;
kind to her-no, she could not do such a&#xD;
thing !&#xD;
One day, a young inan, a visitor at the&#xD;
house said, laughing, to  d'Apremont,&#xD;
" My fine fellow, what in the world&#xD;
were you doing yesterday, disguised- as&#xD;
a peasant, at the window of a cottage&#xD;
about a quarter of a mile from here ? If&#xD;
I had not been going so very fast, I&#xD;
would have stopped my horse to enquire&#xD;
if you had turned shepherd."&#xD;
" My husband ! disguised as a peas-&#xD;
ant !" exclaimed Nathalie, with astonish-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
" Edgar is mistaken: it could not&#xD;
have been me that he saw," replied Ar-&#xD;
mandl, turning~ away in evident embar-&#xD;
rassment.&#xD;
"Not you-impossible !" replied the&#xD;
young man. " Some one, then,. very&#xD;
much like you."&#xD;
" How was the man you-saw dressed ?&#xD;
&#xD;
where is the cottage ?'' asked Nathalie&#xD;
hurriedly.&#xD;
"Oh, Madame, I do not know exactly;&#xD;
I am  not well' enough acquainted. with,&#xD;
this part of the coflntry to describe the"&#xD;
place, but the man wore a blue ' blouse.'&#xD;
But why should I have. taken him for the&#xD;
captain, I cannot imagine, as we are not&#xD;
yet in the carnival."&#xD;
Madame d'Apremont said no more ;&#xD;
but she was fully persuaded that the per-&#xD;
son nientioned was her husband. But&#xD;
why disguise himself. He must be en.&#xD;
gaged in some very dreadful affair ; and.&#xD;
Nathalie shed tears as she thought, " Oh&#xD;
how unfortunate I am to' have married&#xD;
a man who is so mysterious !"&#xD;
She now became very anxious to re-&#xD;
turn to Paris, and her husband, always&#xD;
attentive to her wishes, made no objec.&#xD;
tion. But, once in town, his old habits&#xD;
of impatience and irritation reappeared,&#xD;
and one day he said to his wife-" My&#xD;
dear, an afternoon walk does me so much&#xD;
good, such as I used to take in the coun-&#xD;
try ; an old sailor like myself cannot&#xD;
bear to sit all the evening, after dinner."&#xD;
"Yes sir ! I see how it is--go !"&#xD;
"Nevertheless, if you have any ob-&#xD;
jection."&#xD;
" Oh no ! what objection can I have?"&#xD;
He, went out, and continued to do so,&#xD;
day after day, at the same hour, just as&#xD;
he had done in the country, and as before,&#xD;
he regained his good humor.&#xD;
" He loves some other woman, per-&#xD;
haps," thought Nathalie, "and he must&#xD;
see her every day. Oh, how wretched&#xD;
I am ! I must let him know that his per-&#xD;
fidy is discovered. No, I will wait till I&#xD;
have some certain proof wherewith to&#xD;
confront him."&#xD;
And she went to seek her uncle, say.&#xD;
ing-.-&#xD;
" Ah ! I am the most unhappy crea-&#xD;
ture in the world !"&#xD;
" What is the matter ?" said the old&#xD;
man, leaning back in his arm chair. -&#xD;
" Armand leaves the house two hours&#xD;
every evening -after dinner, and comes&#xD;
back in high spirits, and as anxious to&#xD;
please me as on the day of our marriage.&#xD;
Oh ! uncle, I cannot bear it any longer,&#xD;
if you do not assist me to discover&#xD;
&#xD;
where he goes, I will separate myself&#xD;
from him."&#xD;
"But my dear niece ?"&#xD;
"My dear uncle, you are so good and&#xD;
obliging, grant me one favor. I am sure&#xD;
there is some woman in the secret."&#xD;
M. d'Ablaincourt wished to prevent a&#xD;
rupture between, his niece and nephew,,&#xD;
which would interfere with the quiet,&#xD;
peaceful life which he had led at their&#xD;
house. He pretended to follow Armand,&#xD;
but came back very soon, saying he had&#xD;
lost sight of him.&#xD;
"But in what direction does he go ?"&#xD;
" Sometimes one way and sometimes&#xD;
another, but always alone ; so your sus-&#xD;
picions are unfounded. Be- assured he&#xD;
only walks for exercise."&#xD;
But Nathalie was not to be duped in&#xD;
this way. She sent for a little errand&#xD;
boy, of whose intelligence she had heard&#xD;
a great deal.&#xD;
"M. d'Apremont goes out every eve-&#xD;
ning."&#xD;
"Yes, madame."&#xD;
"To-morrow, you will follow him;&#xD;
observe where he goes, and come and&#xD;
tell me privately. Do you under-&#xD;
stand?"&#xD;
"Yes,,madame."&#xD;
Nathalie waited impatiently for the&#xD;
next day and for the hour of her hus-&#xD;
band's departure. At last the time came&#xD;
-the pursuit is going 'on - Nathalie&#xD;
counted the moments. After three quar-&#xD;
ters of an hour the messenger arrived&#xD;
covered with dust.&#xD;
"Well," exclaimed Nathalie, "speak;'&#xD;
tell me every thing you have seen!"&#xD;
" Madame, I followed M. d'Apremont,&#xD;
at a distance, as far as Marias in the Rue&#xD;
Ville du Temple, where he entered a&#xD;
small house in an alley. There was no&#xD;
servant to let him in."&#xD;
"An alley! no servant ! dreadful !"&#xD;
"I went directly after him, and heard&#xD;
him go up stairs, and unlock a door with&#xD;
a key he held in his hand."&#xD;
" Opened the door himself without&#xD;
knocking ! Are you sure of that ?"&#xD;
" Yes, madame." .&#xD;
" The wretch! So he has a key ! But&#xD;
go on."                      .,&#xD;
"'When the door was shut after him, I&#xD;
&#xD;
stole -softly up the stairs and peeped&#xD;
through the key-hole."&#xD;
" Well,-you have twenty francs more!"&#xD;
"I peeped through the key-hole and saw&#xD;
him drag a box along the floor "&#xD;
" A box?"&#xD;
" Then he undressed himself, and.-."&#xD;
" Undressed himself ?"&#xD;
"'Then for a few seconds, I could not&#xD;
see him, and directly he appeared again&#xD;
in a sort of-grey blouse, and a cap on&#xD;
his head."&#xD;
" A blouse, still. What in the world&#xD;
does he want with so many blouses?&#xD;
well, what next ?"&#xD;
"I came away then, madame, and&#xD;
made haste to tell it to you; but he is&#xD;
there still."&#xD;
"Well, now run to the corner and get&#xD;
me a hack, and direct the coachman to&#xD;
the house where you have been."&#xD;
While he was gone after the hack, Na-&#xD;
thalie hurried on her hat and cloak, and&#xD;
ran into her uncle's room, saying-&#xD;
"I've found him out--he is at his mis-&#xD;
tress's house now, in a grey blouse. He&#xD;
had a blue one in the country  But I&#xD;
will go and confound him, and then you&#xD;
will never see me more."&#xD;
The old man had no time to reply.&#xD;
She was gone with her messenger, in the&#xD;
hack. They stopped at last.&#xD;
" Here is the house."&#xD;
Nathalie got out, pale and trembling.&#xD;
" Shall I go up stairs with you, mad-&#xD;
ame ?" asked the boy.&#xD;
" No, I will go alone. The third sto-&#xD;
ry, is it not?"&#xD;
"Yes, madame ; the, left door at the&#xD;
head of the stairs."&#xD;
Nathalie mounted the dark, narrow&#xD;
stairs, and arrived at the door, and almost&#xD;
fainting she cried-" Open the door, or&#xD;
I shall die !"&#xD;
The door was opened, and Nathalie&#xD;
was received in her husband's arms, who&#xD;
was alone, sn the room, clad in a grey&#xD;
blouse, and smoking a turkish pipe.&#xD;
,"19My wife ?" exclaimed Armand in&#xD;
surphse.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, your wife ; who, suspect-&#xD;
ing your perfidy, has followed you to&#xD;
discover the cause of your mysterious&#xD;
conduct !"&#xD;

" How, Nathalie, my mysterious con-&#xD;
duct?  Look, here it is !" showing his&#xD;
pipe. "Before . our marriage, you for-&#xD;
bade me to smoke, and I promised to&#xD;
obey- you. For some months I kept the&#xD;
promise'; but you remember how irrita-&#xD;
ted I became. It was my pips, my be-&#xD;
loved pipe, that I regretted. One day,&#xD;
in the country, I discovered a little cot-&#xD;
tage w ere a peasant was smoking. I&#xD;
asked him if he could lend me a blouse&#xD;
and a cap, for I should like to smoke&#xD;
with him, but it was necessary to con-&#xD;
ceal it from you, as the smell of the&#xD;
smoke remaining in my clothes would&#xD;
have betrayed me. It was soon settled,&#xD;
between us ; .I returned thither every af-,&#xD;
ternoon to indulge in my favorite occupa-&#xD;
tion, and with a precaution of a cap to keep&#xD;
the smoke from remaining in my hair,&#xD;
I contrived to deceive you. When we&#xD;
returned to Paris, I hired this little room,&#xD;
at a distance from home, and here I keep&#xD;
this great box, in, which I always lock&#xD;
my coat before I bring out my pipe ; so&#xD;
that when I return, you, may not be of-&#xD;
fended at the odor. This is the mystery.&#xD;
Forgive me for my disobedience, since I&#xD;
&#xD;
have done all' I could to conceal it from&#xD;
you."&#xD;
Nathalie embraced-him, crying.-&#xD;
"Oh, no ! I mIght have known it&#xD;
could not be ! I am happy now, and&#xD;
you shall smoke as much as you please,&#xD;
at home. I will never make any oppo-&#xD;
sition to it, and you need hide your pipe&#xD;
no longer."&#xD;
And Nathalie returned - to: her uncle,&#xD;
saying-&#xD;
" Uncle, he loves smoke! He was on-&#xD;
ly smoking; but hereafter he is to smoke&#xD;
at home."&#xD;
"I can arrange it all," said M. d'Ab-&#xD;
laincourt; "he shall smoke while he&#xD;
plays backgammon. In that way," tho't&#xD;
the old man, "I shall be sure of my&#xD;
game every evening.".&#xD;
" My dear Nathalie," said the captain,&#xD;
"I will profit by your permission ; but&#xD;
at the same time I will take care not to&#xD;
discommode you. I will use the same pre-&#xD;
caution at home as I have formerly done."&#xD;
" You are so-kind! But I am so hap-&#xD;
py to find that you are so faithful to me&#xD;
that I think I shall even like the smell&#xD;
of the smoke."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
WHo is this distinguished-looking&#xD;
young woman with her eyes drooping,&#xD;
and the shadow of a dreadful shock yet&#xD;
fresh upon every feature ? Who is the&#xD;
elderly lady with her eyes flashing fire ?&#xD;
Who i the downcast child of sixteen ?&#xD;
'What     that torn paper lying at their&#xD;
feet ? Who is the writer ? Whom does&#xD;
the paper concern ? Ah ! if she, if the&#xD;
central figure in the group-twenty-two at&#xD;
the moment when she is revealed to us&#xD;
-could on her happy birth-day at sweet&#xD;
seventeen, have seen the image of her-&#xD;
self five years onwards, just as we see it&#xD;
now, would she have prayed for life&#xD;
as for an absolute blessing? or would&#xD;
she not have prayed to be taken from&#xD;
the evil to come-to be taken away&#xD;
one evening at least before this day's sun&#xD;
arose ? It is true, she still wears a look&#xD;
of gentle pride, and a relic of that noble&#xD;
smile which belongs to her, that suffers&#xD;
an' injury which many times over she&#xD;
would have died sooner than    inflict.&#xD;
Womanly pride refuses itself before wit-&#xD;
nesses to the total prostration of the blow;&#xD;
but, for all that, you may see that she&#xD;
longs to be left alone, and that her tears&#xD;
will flow without restraint when she is so.&#xD;
This room is her pretty boudoir, in which,&#xD;
till to-night-poor thing !-she has been&#xD;
glad and happy. There stands her min-&#xD;
iature conservatory, and there expands&#xD;
'her miniature library ; as we circumnav-&#xD;
 igators of literature are apt (you know)&#xD;
[ to regard all female libraries in the light&#xD;
t of miniature. None of these will ever&#xD;
rekindle a smile on her face ; and there,&#xD;
&#xD;
beyond, is her music, which only of all&#xD;
that she possesses, will now become&#xD;
dearer to her than ever; .but not, as once,&#xD;
to feed a self-mocked pensiveness, or to&#xD;
cheat a half visionary sadness. She will&#xD;
be sad indeed. But she is one of those&#xD;
that will suffer in silence. Nobody will&#xD;
ever detect her failing in any point of du-&#xD;
ty, or querulously seeking the support in&#xD;
others which she can find for herself in&#xD;
this solitary room.' Droop she will not&#xD;
in the sight of men; and, for all beyond,&#xD;
nobody has any-concern with that except&#xD;
God. You shall hear what becomes of&#xD;
her, before we take our departure; but&#xD;
now let me tell you what has happened.&#xD;
In the main outline I am sure you&#xD;
guess. already without aid of mine, for&#xD;
we leaden-eyed men, in such cases, see&#xD;
nothing by comparison with you our&#xD;
quick-witted sisters. That haughty-look-&#xD;
ing lady with the Roman cast of features,&#xD;
who must once have been strikingly&#xD;
handsome-an Agrippina, even yet, in a&#xD;
favorable presentation-is the younger&#xD;
lady's aunt. She, it is rumored, once&#xD;
sustained, in her younger days, some in-&#xD;
jury of that same cruel nature which has&#xD;
this- day assailed her niece, and ever&#xD;
since she has worn an air of disdain, not&#xD;
altogether unsupported by real dignity,&#xD;
towards men. This aunt it was that tore&#xD;
the letter which lies upon 'the floor. It&#xD;
deserved to be torn ; and yet she that had&#xD;
the best right to do so would not have&#xD;
torn it. That letter was an elaborate at-&#xD;
tempt on the part of an accomplished&#xD;
young man to release imself from sa-&#xD;

cred engagements: What need was there&#xD;
to argue the case of such engagements ?&#xD;
Could it have been requisite with pure&#xD;
female dignity to plead anything, or do&#xD;
more than look an indisposition to ful-&#xD;
fil them? The aunt is now moving to-&#xD;
wards the door, which I am glad to see ;&#xD;
and she is followed by that pale timid&#xD;
girl of sixteen, a cousin, who feels&#xD;
the case profoundly, but is too young&#xD;
and shy to offer an intellectual sympa-&#xD;
thy.&#xD;
Shall we, then, after an interval of near-&#xD;
ly two years has passed over the young&#xD;
lady in the boudoir, look in again upon&#xD;
her-? You hesitate, fair friend ; and I&#xD;
myself hesitate, For in fact she also has&#xD;
become a wreck: and it would grieve us&#xD;
both to see her altered. At the end of&#xD;
twenty-one months she retains hardly a&#xD;
vestige of resemblance to the. fine young&#xD;
woman we saw on that unhappy evening&#xD;
with her aunt and cousin. On consider-&#xD;
ation, therefore, let us do this. We will&#xD;
direct our glasses to her room, at a point&#xD;
of time about six weeks. further on.&#xD;
Suppose this time gone; suppose her&#xD;
now dressed for her grave, and placed in&#xD;
her coffin. The advantage of that is-&#xD;
that, though no change can restore the&#xD;
ravages of the past, yet (as often is found&#xD;
to happen with young persons) the ex-&#xD;
pression has revived from her girlish&#xD;
years. The child-like aspect has revolv-&#xD;
ed, and settled back upon her features.&#xD;
The wasting away of the flesh is less ap-&#xD;
parent in the face'; and one might ima-&#xD;
gine that, in this sweet marble counte-&#xD;
nance, was seen the very same upon&#xD;
which, eleven years ago, her mother's&#xD;
darkening eyes had lingered to the last,&#xD;
until clouds had sw llowed up the vision&#xD;
of her beloved twin. Yet, if that were&#xD;
in part a fancy-th t not only much of a&#xD;
childlike truth and simplicity has reinsta-&#xD;
ted itself in the temple of~her now repo-&#xD;
sing features, but also that tranquility and&#xD;
perfect peace, such as are appropriate to&#xD;
eternity ; but which from the living coun-&#xD;
tenance had taken their flight forever, on&#xD;
that memorable evening when we looked&#xD;
in upon the impassioned group--upon&#xD;
the towering and denouncing aunt, the&#xD;
sympathising-but silent cousin, the poor&#xD;
&#xD;
blighted niece, and the wicked letter ly-&#xD;
ing in fragments at her feet.&#xD;
One only person in this world there is,&#xD;
who could to-night have been a support.&#xD;
ing friend to our young sufferer, and that'&#xD;
is her dear loving twin-sister, who for&#xD;
eighteen years read and wrote, thought&#xD;
and sang, slept and breathed, with the di-&#xD;
viding-door open forever between their&#xD;
bed-rooms, and never once a separation&#xD;
between their hearts ; but she is in a far&#xD;
distant land. Who else is there at her&#xD;
call ?  Except God, nobody. Her aunt&#xD;
had somewhat sternly admonished her,&#xD;
though still with a relenting in her eye&#xD;
as she glanced aside at the expression in&#xD;
her niece's face, that she must "call&#xD;
pride to her assistance." Ah, true ; but&#xD;
pride, though a strong ally in public, is&#xD;
apt in private to turn as treacherous as&#xD;
the worst of those against whom she is&#xD;
invoked.' How could it be dreamed by,&#xD;
a person of sense, that a brilliant young&#xD;
man of merits, various, and eminent, in&#xD;
spite of his baseness, to whom, for near-&#xD;
ly two years, this young woman had giv-&#xD;
en her whole .confiding love, might be_&#xD;
dismissed from a heart like hers on the&#xD;
earliest summons of pride, simply be-&#xD;
cause she herself had been dismissed&#xD;
from his, or seemed to have been dis-&#xD;
missed, on a summons of mercenary cal-&#xD;
culation ? Look ! now that she is reliev-&#xD;
ed from the weight of an unconfidential'&#xD;
presence, she has sat for twct hours with&#xD;
her head buried in her hands. At last&#xD;
she rises to look for something,  A&#xD;
thought has struck her ; and, taking a&#xD;
little golden key which hangs by a chain&#xD;
within her bosom, she searches for some-&#xD;
thing locked up amongst her few jewels.&#xD;
What is it ? It is a Bible exquisitely illu-&#xD;
minated, with a letter attached, by some&#xD;
pretty silken artifice, to the blank leaves&#xD;
at the end. This letter is a beautitul re-&#xD;
cord wisely and pathetically composed,&#xD;
of maternal anxiety still burning strong&#xD;
in death, and yearning, when all objects&#xD;
beside were fast fading from he-c eyes, af&#xD;
ter one parting act of communion with&#xD;
the twin darlings of her heart. Both&#xD;
were thirteen years old, within a week,&#xD;
or two, as on the night before her death,&#xD;
they sat weeping by the side of their&#xD;
&#xD;
mother, and hanging on her lips, now for&#xD;
farewell whispers, and now, for farewell&#xD;
kisses. They both knew that as her&#xD;
strength had permitted during the latter&#xD;
month of her life, she had thrown the&#xD;
last anguish of love in her beseeching&#xD;
,heart into a letter of council to them-&#xD;
selves. Through this, of which each&#xD;
sister had a copy, she trusted long to&#xD;
converse with her orphans. -And the&#xD;
last promise which she had entreated on&#xD;
this evening from both, was--that in .ei-&#xD;
ther of two contingencies they would re-&#xD;
view her councils, and the passages to&#xD;
which she pointed their attention in the&#xD;
Scriptures ; namely, first, in the, event of&#xD;
any calamity, that, for one sister or for&#xD;
both, should overspread their paths with&#xD;
total darkness ; and secondly, in the&#xD;
event of life flowing in too profound a&#xD;
stream of prosperity, so as to. threaten&#xD;
them with an alienation of interest from&#xD;
all spiritual objects.. She had not con-&#xD;
cealed that, of these two extreme cases,&#xD;
she would prefer for her own children&#xD;
the first. And now had that case arrived&#xD;
indeed, which she in spirit had desired&#xD;
to meet. Nine years ago, just as the sil-&#xD;
very voice of a dial in the dying lady's&#xD;
bedroom was striking nine upon a sum-&#xD;
mer evening, had the last visual ray&#xD;
streamed from her sinking eyes upon her&#xD;
orphan twins, after which, throughout&#xD;
the night, she had slept away into heav-&#xD;
en. Now again had come a summer&#xD;
evening memorable for unhappiness ;&#xD;
&#xD;
now again the daughter thought of those&#xD;
dying lights of love which streamed at&#xD;
sunset from the closing eyes of her moth-&#xD;
er ; again, and just as she went back in&#xD;
thought, to this image, the same silvery&#xD;
voice of the dial sounded nine o'clock.&#xD;
Again she remembered her mother's dy-&#xD;
ing request; again her own tear-hallow-&#xD;
ed promises-and with her heart in h r&#xD;
mother's grave she now rose to fulfil i .&#xD;
Here, then, when this solemn recurrence&#xD;
to a testamentary council has ceased to&#xD;
be a mere office of duty towards the de-&#xD;
parted,, having taken the shape of a con-&#xD;
solation for herself, let us pause.&#xD;
Now, fair companion in this exploring&#xD;
voyage of inquest into hidden scenes, or&#xD;
forgotten scenes of human life--perhaps&#xD;
'it might be instructive to direct our glas-&#xD;
ses upon the false perfidious lover. It&#xD;
might. But do not let us do so. We&#xD;
might like him better, or pity him more,&#xD;
than either of us would desire. His&#xD;
name and memory have long since droop-&#xD;
ed out of everybody's thoughts. Of&#xD;
prosperity, and (what is more important)&#xD;
of internal peace, he is reputed to have&#xD;
had no gleam from the moment when he&#xD;
betrayed his faith, and in one day threw&#xD;
away the jewel of good conscience, and&#xD;
"a pearl richer than all his tribe." But,&#xD;
however that may be, it is certain that,&#xD;
finally; he became a wreck ; and of any&#xD;
hopeless wreck it is painful to talk.-.&#xD;
much more so, when through him others&#xD;
also became wrecks.&#xD;

I ties of the morning occasioned, had long&#xD;
detained the young soldier in that de-&#xD;
lightful spot, and induced him to forego&#xD;
the social enjoyments which the interior&#xD;
of the mansion afforded.&#xD;
. The chateau.itself belonged to a Span-&#xD;
ish grandee of the first rank ; who, with&#xD;
f his family, now resided there. Of his&#xD;
two daughters, the eldest was particularly&#xD;
handsome; and had, during the evening,&#xD;
greatly attracted the admiration of the&#xD;
l French officer, whose notice had evident-&#xD;
ly not been disregarded by the fair Span-&#xD;
iard: but, whenever she addressed him,&#xD;
there was, mixed up with her looks and&#xD;
tones of kindness, so singular an expres-&#xD;
sion of seeming sorrow and compassion,&#xD;
that, haply the impression it had made&#xD;
on him, had led him to withdraw from&#xD;
the society, and induced his deep and&#xD;
lengthened reverie. Notwithstanding she&#xD;
was one of five children, the-great wealth&#xD;
of the Marquis justified the .idea that&#xD;
Clara would be richly endowed: but&#xD;
Victor Marchand could scarcely bring&#xD;
himself to hope that, in any event, the&#xD;
daughter of one of the proudest and most&#xD;
powerful nobles in all Spain, would even&#xD;
be permitted to regard, with more than&#xD;
ordinary civility, the son of a Parisian&#xD;
grocer.&#xD;
The French were hated: and General&#xD;
G'*t *r, the commandant of the province,&#xD;
having had strong reason to suspect that&#xD;
the Marquis de Leganes contemplated an&#xD;
insurrection of the inhabitants of that&#xD;
and the surrounding country, in favor of&#xD;

of military orders, in despite of the more teau walls were hushed at once. A death which truly indicated his well known&#xD;
&#xD;
harsh unyielding character, somewhat&#xD;
abated as he witnessed the emotion of&#xD;
his visiter. As soon as he was able,&#xD;
Victor told his horrible tale': and the&#xD;
downcast looks and deep silence of his&#xD;
auditors were the only, but expressive,&#xD;
comment on his history.&#xD;
"It appears to me, Sir," at length said&#xD;
the General, calmly, "that you, are more&#xD;
unfortunate than criminal; you can hard-&#xD;
ly be deemed responsible for the guilt of&#xD;
the Spaniards; and if the Marshal decide&#xD;
not otherwise, I shall not hesitate to ac-&#xD;
quit you."  These words afforded ut&#xD;
feeble consolation to Victor, who falte -&#xD;
ingly demanded, "But when the Emp -&#xD;
ror learns the report, Sir ?"  "It is not&#xD;
impossible he may order you to be shot,"&#xD;
observed the General, in a tone of indif-&#xD;
ference: " but of that hereafter," he add-&#xD;
ed, rising and assuming his more bitter&#xD;
expression of tone and feature. "Let&#xD;
us now only think of vengeance-ven-&#xD;
geance, deep, deep and terrible. on these&#xD;
Spaniards."&#xD;
In a short hour, an entire regiment,&#xD;
with detachments of cavalry and artillery,&#xD;
were on their march; at the head of which&#xD;
rode the General and Victor. The troops,&#xD;
informed of the massacre of their com-&#xD;
rades, pressed onwards with unrelenting&#xD;
activity, actuated by feelings of hate and&#xD;
fury. The villages through which their&#xD;
road lay were already up in arms: but&#xD;
they were soon reduced to obedience, and&#xD;
in all of them each tenth man was told&#xD;
off and shot.&#xD;
By some -unaccountable fatality, the&#xD;
English fleet remained lying to and inac-&#xD;
tive, without even communicating with&#xD;
the shore : so that the town of Menda&#xD;
was surrounded by the French troops&#xD;
without the slightest show of resistance&#xD;
on the part of its inhabitants: who, dis-&#xD;
appointed in 'the succor on which they&#xD;
had relied, offered to surrender at discre-&#xD;
tion. Such as were more -immediately&#xD;
implicated in the massacre of the garri-&#xD;
son, justly pressuring that, for their act,&#xD;
the town would be delivered up to flames,&#xD;
andl the entire population put to death, by&#xD;
an effort of courage and self-devotion, not&#xD;
unfrequent in the war of the Peninsula,&#xD;
offered to become their proper accusers.&#xD;

52                     The Spanish Headsman.&#xD;
&#xD;
This unexpected and extraordinary pro-&#xD;
position was acceded to by the General;&#xD;
and he engaged to accord a pardon to the&#xD;
rest of the inhabitants, and prevent the&#xD;
town being fired or pillaged by the in-&#xD;
censed soldiery. But, at the same time&#xD;
he levied an enormous contribution on'&#xD;
the people; for the payment of which,&#xD;
within twenty-four hours, he commanded&#xD;
that the principal and wealthiest resi-&#xD;
dences should be given as hostages into&#xD;
his hands; and inflexibly decreed that&#xD;
-all the persons appertaining to the cha-&#xD;
teau, from the Marquis to his lowest val-&#xD;
et, should be placed, unconditionally, in&#xD;
his power.&#xD;
Having seen his soldiers encamped,&#xD;
and taken all due precautions for their&#xD;
safety against a sudden attack, the Gene-&#xD;
ral proceeded to the chateau, of which&#xD;
he immediately assumed military posses-&#xD;
sion. The respective members, with the&#xD;
domesticsof the family of Leganses, were&#xD;
found with cords, and the ball-room as-&#xD;
signed them as a prison, the casements&#xD;
whereof opened upon the terrace: while&#xD;
the General and his staff occupied an&#xD;
adjoining suit of rooms, where a council&#xD;
was holden, to adopt all necessary mea-&#xD;
sures in the event of an attempted disem-&#xD;
barkation by the British. Orders were&#xD;
given for the erection of batteries, on the&#xD;
coasts, and dispatches sent off to the&#xD;
Marshal..&#xD;
The two hundred Spaniards who had&#xD;
acknowledged themselves as the authors&#xD;
of the massacre, and resigned themselves&#xD;
into the General's power, were drawn up&#xD;
on the terrace of the chateau, and shot !&#xD;
without a single exception. As soon as&#xD;
their execution had terruinated, General&#xD;
G**t-r ordered the erection of as many&#xD;
gallows as there were prisoners in the&#xD;
ball-room, on the same spot; directing,&#xD;
moreover, that the hangman of the town&#xD;
should be summoned.&#xD;
Victor Marchand profited by the in-&#xD;
terval in the work of death, which the&#xD;
execution of the General's orders requir-&#xD;
ed, to visit the unhappy prisoners; and&#xD;
a few minutes only elapsed before he&#xD;
again presented himself to his command-&#xD;
ing officer. " I presume, Sir, he said,"&#xD;
with much emotion, "to implore your&#xD;

sate bound to their -rich and gilded chairs; he contemplated the mournful group,&#xD;
while the eight servants of the house Victor knew not how to announce the&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
General's determination.  Compliance&#xD;
with it was surely out of the question;&#xD;
and why should the cup of grief, already&#xD;
full, be unnecessarilyovercharged ? The&#xD;
entreaties of Clara, however, overcame&#xD;
him ;-her face wore the hue of death as&#xD;
she listened, but she struggled violently&#xD;
with her feelings, and assuming a com-&#xD;
paratively calun and tranquil air, she&#xD;
arose and placed herself solemnly on her&#xD;
knees at her father's feet.-" Oh, Sire !-&#xD;
Father !" she'exclaimed; and as all&#xD;
leaned forward in breathless- attention,&#xD;
her accents fell clear and distinct around,&#xD;
as earth upon the coffih-lid. "Command&#xD;
--command Juanito to swear by all his&#xD;
hopes of mercy hereafter, that he will&#xD;
now obey your orders, whatever they&#xD;
may be, to their fullest extent, and we&#xD;
shall yet be happy." The mother trem-&#xD;
bled from joy and hope, eagerly, as unob-&#xD;
served she bent forward to participate in&#xD;
the communication her daughter whis-&#xD;
pered in her- father's ears. She heard,&#xD;
and fell fainting to the earth. Juanito&#xD;
himself seemed evidently aware of its&#xD;
intent; for he writhed from rage and hor-&#xD;
ror.&#xD;
Victor now commanded the guards to&#xD;
quit the room, the Marquis renewing his&#xD;
promise of unconditional' submission.&#xD;
They accordingly retired, leading away&#xD;
the domestics, who, as they issued forth,&#xD;
were- delivered over, one by one, to the&#xD;
public executioner, and successively put&#xD;
to death.&#xD;
Thus relieved from painful intrusion,&#xD;
the old man arose--" Juanito !" said he,&#xD;
sternly. The son, aware of his father's&#xD;
intention, only replied by an inclination&#xD;
of the head, indicative of a decided re-&#xD;
fusal. He then sank into a chair, while&#xD;
his wild, fixed, and haggard look rested&#xD;
upon his parent. "Come, come, Juani-&#xD;
to ; dearest brother !" said Clara, in an&#xD;
encouraging and cheerful tone, as she&#xD;
playfully placed herself upon his knee,&#xD;
the other hand fondly removing the hair&#xD;
from his burning forehead, which she af-&#xD;
fectionately kissed. "If you knew, my&#xD;
Juanito, my own kind brother, how wel-&#xD;
come death would be, if given at your&#xD;
hand. Think, Juanito, my loved, loved,&#xD;

the Marquis, who addressed his son.&#xD;
"It is my will-I command you, Juani-&#xD;
to."  The young Count moved not, stir-&#xD;
red not; and his father fell at his feet.&#xD;
Raffaele, Filippo, and their sisters did the&#xD;
same, stretching forth their supplicating&#xD;
hands towards him, who alone could&#xD;
save their name from forgetfulness and&#xD;
extinction, while the Marquis, on his&#xD;
knees, continued, "My son, my Juanito,&#xD;
prove yourself a Spaniard. Show the&#xD;
stern resolve, the noble feeling of a&#xD;
Spaniard. Let -not your father thus&#xD;
kneel in vain before you. What are-&#xD;
your  sufferings  compared with the&#xD;
honor of those you love-those who&#xD;
so truly love you ? Let not your own&#xD;
sorrows prevail against your father's&#xD;
prayer. Would I not die for you, were&#xD;
it required of me ? Live then for us. Let&#xD;
not the hand of infamy insult my hoary&#xD;
head.-Is he our son, Madam ?" indig-&#xD;
nantly exclaimed the Marquis, addressing&#xD;
his wife as he arose, while Juanito, with&#xD;
a fixed and horrid stare, sate deadlike;&#xD;
the distended muscles of his livid front,&#xD;
seeming less the traits of mortal man&#xD;
than those of chiseled marble. "He&#xD;
yields, he yields," shrieked forth the mo-&#xD;
ther, in accents of triumph and despair.&#xD;
" He consents," she cried, as she marked&#xD;
a slight movement of his brow, which&#xD;
she only could understand as implying&#xD;
the hard and cruel obedience of her&#xD;
child.&#xD;
The almoner of the chateau entering,&#xD;
he was instantly surrounded by the fami-&#xD;
ly, who led him towards Juanito, while&#xD;
Victor, no longer able to endure the scene,&#xD;
madesign to Clara of his intention, and&#xD;
rushed from the room to make one last&#xD;
effort with the General. Him he found&#xD;
in one of his milder moods, cheerfully&#xD;
conversing with his officers, while he&#xD;
&#xD;
partook of the delicious wines the cellars&#xD;
of the chateau afforded.&#xD;
An hour afterwards, and one hundred&#xD;
of the principal inhabitants of Menda&#xD;
were assembled, by the General's orders,&#xD;
on the terrace, to witness the execution&#xD;
of the family of Leganes. They were&#xD;
arranged beneath the line of gallows, on&#xD;
which hung the bodies of the Marquis's&#xD;
domestics; and a strong military guard&#xD;
preserved order. At about thirty paces&#xD;
distant,. a block had been prepared, on&#xD;
which a large and naked scimetar was&#xD;
laid; while the executioner stood near to&#xD;
act, in the event of Juanito's refusal.&#xD;
r The dead silence which prevailed was&#xD;
interrupted by the sound of many foot-&#xD;
steps; the slow and measured tread of&#xD;
the soldiery, and the clattering of arms,&#xD;
drowned, at times, by the loud laugh of&#xD;
the officers over their wine. So had the&#xD;
dance and music, bit shortly since, been&#xD;
mingled with the expiring groans of the&#xD;
French garrison.: All eyes were now di-&#xD;
rected towards the chateau, and the seve-&#xD;
ral members of the Leganes family ap-&#xD;
proached, with firm unshrinking step,&#xD;
and countenances patient, calm, and se-&#xD;
rene-save one.    He, pale, wan and&#xD;
heartstricken, leant upon the priest, who&#xD;
unceasigly urged every argument of re-&#xD;
ligion, to sustain and console the wretch-&#xD;
ed being who was alone condemned to&#xD;
live. The Marquis, his wife, and their&#xD;
four children, took their places at some&#xD;
paces distant from the block, and knelt.&#xD;
Juanito was led forward by the priest,&#xD;
and having reached the fatal spot, the&#xD;
public executioner advanced and whisper-&#xD;
ed him, haply imparting some necessary&#xD;
instructions in his dreadful mystery.&#xD;
The confessor would. have arranged the&#xD;
victims so as to avoid, as far as possible,&#xD;
a view of the work of death; but they&#xD;
were Spaniards, and evinced no symp-&#xD;
torus of fear.&#xD;
Clara now darted forwards to her bro-&#xD;
ther. " Juanito!I" she exclaimed, "you&#xD;
nmst have pity on my weakness. I am&#xD;
a sad, sad coward.-Begin with me."&#xD;
iA hasty step was heard approaching-&#xD;
iwas Victor. Clara was kneeling by&#xD;
the block, and her white ne$? already&#xD;
bared to the scimetar. The otler shud-&#xD;
&#xD;
55&#xD;
&#xD;
and my mother's blood !" A cry of hor-&#xD;
ror burst from all around. The baccha-&#xD;
nalian orgies within the castle were at&#xD;
once ended.&#xD;
The Marchioness, sensible that the&#xD;
strength and courage of her son had fled,&#xD;
cast one glance, and one only, at the&#xD;
scene at her feet;- and then, aged as she&#xD;
was, leaped the terrace balustrade, and&#xD;
disappeared. As she fell upon the rocks&#xD;
beneath, the reeking instrument of death&#xD;
dropped from the hand of Juanito. His&#xD;
eyes flashed an almost maniac fire. A&#xD;
low gurgling sound, like a death-greeting,&#xD;
broke from his- livid lips,.--life seemed&#xD;
to forsake his limbs--and he sunk sense-&#xD;
less upon the ground, beside the beloved&#xD;
beings who had fallen by his hand.&#xD;
S  *    *    *    *     *&#xD;
&#xD;
dered, but rushed forward,-" Your life&#xD;
is. spared, Clara. The General pardon&#xD;
you, if you consent-to-to be mine.'&#xD;
The Spanish lady looked on him fo&#xD;
an instant; g proud, disdainful glance of&#xD;
withering scorn, "Quick, quick, Juanito,"&#xD;
she murmured in a hurried hollow voice,&#xD;
as she turned, and her head rolled at Vic-&#xD;
tor's feet.&#xD;
As the first dull blow of the heavy&#xD;
scimetar was heard, for one moment the&#xD;
mother's whole frame moved convulsive-&#xD;
ly. It was the first and only sign of&#xD;
weakness exhibited.&#xD;
*    * -*       *    *&#xD;
" Am I well so--my good-good Ju-&#xD;
anito ?" said the little Raffaele.&#xD;
"You weep, my Marquirita, my sis-&#xD;
ter," and, verily, the voice of Juanito&#xD;
seemed as a voice from the tomb, as&#xD;
again he lifted the scimetar.&#xD;
"It is for you, dear brother," she an-&#xD;
swered.   "Poor, poor Juanito !--you&#xD;
will be without us all, alone, and so un-&#xD;
happy."&#xD;
*    *     *    *    *     *&#xD;
The tall commanding figure of the&#xD;
Marquis now approached. He looked&#xD;
on his children's blood, and then turning&#xD;
towards the assembled Spaniards, and.&#xD;
stretching forth his arms over Juanito,&#xD;
exclaimed in a loud and resolute tone of&#xD;
voice,-"Spaniards, hear me ! A father's&#xD;
blessing I give unto my son ; may it&#xD;
ever rest on and with him ! His is the&#xD;
post of duty. Now, Marquis of Le'ga-&#xD;
ne's, strike firm and surely, for thou art&#xD;
without reproach !"&#xD;
But when Juanito saw his mother ap-&#xD;
proach, supported by the confessor-the&#xD;
scimetar struck heavily against the earth,&#xD;
as he shrieked in bitterest agony-" Mo-&#xD;
ther !-God !-God! It is too much-&#xD;
She bore-she nourished me. Blood !&#xD;
&#xD;
',_&#xD;
&#xD;
'+4Y'                                            ~        ~&#xD;
&#xD;
*    *    *   * *    *    *&#xD;
Notwithstanding the unlimited respect&#xD;
and high honors accorded by his sove-&#xD;
reign to the Marquis de L6ganes--not-&#xD;
withstanding the title of ElVerdugo, by&#xD;
which his ancient and noble name has&#xD;
been rendered yet more illustrious, the&#xD;
Marquis now lives an almost heart-broken&#xD;
and solitary man. The birth of an heir&#xD;
to his name and fortune (an event which,&#xD;
unhappily, deprived her who bore him&#xD;
of existence,) had been impatiently await-&#xD;
ed by him, and as his son :aw the light,&#xD;
the father felt that it was now his privi-&#xD;
lege, in Heaven's own time, to join that&#xD;
troop of shadows, that are ever with him&#xD;
and around him. With these, in his long&#xD;
hours of solitude, he holds strange dis-&#xD;
course: and if he ever smile, it is when&#xD;
he points out his sleeping boy to those.&#xD;
unseen beings-unseen by all save him-&#xD;
self-and swears by its innocent head,&#xD;
and by the generations yet unborn, an&#xD;
eternal enmity to France and her chi-&#xD;
dren.&#xD;

BRING FLOWERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE LEGEND OF -ROSE ROCHE.&#xD;
&#xD;
BY MRS. HEMANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
BY THE AUTHOR OF&#xD;
&#xD;
"STORIES OF. WATERLOO."&#xD;
&#xD;
BRING flowers, young flowers for the festal board,&#xD;
To wreathe the cup ere the wine is pour'd:&#xD;
Bring flowers! they are springing in woodland vale,&#xD;
Their breath floats out on the southern gale,&#xD;
And the touch of the sunbeam hath waked the rose,&#xD;
To deck the hall where the bright wine flows.&#xD;
Bring flowers to strew in the conqueror's path,&#xD;
He hath shaken thrones with his stormy wrath !&#xD;
He comes with the spoils of nations back ;&#xD;
The vines lie crush'd in his chariot's track;&#xD;
The turf looks red where he won the day-&#xD;
Bring flowers to die in the conqueror's way !&#xD;
Bring flowers to the captive's lonely cell,&#xD;
They have tales of the joyous wood to tell;&#xD;
Of the free blue streams, and the glowing sky ;&#xD;
And the bright world shut from his languid eye.&#xD;
They will bear him a thought of the sunny hours,&#xD;
And a dream of his youth--bring him flowers, wild flowers.&#xD;
Bring flowers, fresh flowers, for the bride t6 wear !&#xD;
They were born to blush in her shining hair.&#xD;
She is leaving the home of her childish mirth ;&#xD;
She hath bid farewell to her father's hearth;&#xD;
Her place is now by another's side-b&#xD;
Bring flowers for the locks of the fair young bride !&#xD;
Bring flowers, pale flowers, o'er the bier to shed&#xD;
A crown for the brow of the early dead !&#xD;
For this through its leaves hath the white rose burst ;&#xD;
For this-in the woods was the violet nurst.&#xD;
Though they smile in vain for-what once was ours,,&#xD;
They are love's last gift-bring yp flowers, pale flowers.&#xD;
Bring flowers to the shrine where we kneel in prayer ;&#xD;
They are nature's offering, their place is there!&#xD;
They speak of hope to the fainting heart;&#xD;
With a voice of promise they come and part.&#xD;
They sleep in dust through the wintry hours ;&#xD;
They break forth in glory.--bring flowers, bring flowers.&#xD;

&#xD;
AT sixteen Rose-Roche was the loveli-&#xD;
est maid in Ulster. In infancy she was&#xD;
found exposed at the Gate of the Ursu-&#xD;
lines, and her beauty and destitution re-&#xD;
commended her to the charity of the sis-&#xD;
terhood. Educated accordingly, for a&#xD;
conventual life, she had never passed&#xD;
the boundary of the garden walls, and&#xD;
accident discovered the existence of beau-&#xD;
ty, which else had faded unseen and tin-&#xD;
admired within those cloisters, to which&#xD;
from childhood it had been devoted.&#xD;
Cormac More, Lord of Iveaugh, was&#xD;
the patron and protector of the communi-&#xD;
ty at Balleek. At primes and vespers a&#xD;
mass was celebrated for his soul's weal.&#xD;
His Easter-offering was ten beeves and&#xD;
five casks of Bordeaux wine ; and on the,&#xD;
last Christmas visit he presented six sil-&#xD;
ver candlesticks to the altar of Our Lady.&#xD;
No wonder this powerful chief was held&#xD;
in high honour by the' sisterhood of St.&#xD;
Ursula.&#xD;
One tempestuous night in October,&#xD;
wearied with hunting, and separated from&#xD;
his followers by darkness and the storm,&#xD;
Cormack More found himself beneath&#xD;
the walls of the convent of Balleek.&#xD;
Approaching the gate, he wound his horn&#xD;
loudly, and begged for shelter and refresh-&#xD;
ment.. Proud of this opportunity of af-&#xD;
fording hospitality to so noble and muni-&#xD;
7 ficent a protector, the wicket was unbar-&#xD;
red, the Lord of Iveaugh admitted, and&#xD;
v received in honourable state by the Lady&#xD;
i Superior, and inducted with due form in-&#xD;
to the parlour of the Ursulines.&#xD;
&#xD;
There a plentiful repast was speedily&#xD;
prepared, and the tired hunter was cere-&#xD;
moniously seated at the table. His morn-&#xD;
ing meal had been dispatched before the&#xD;
sun had topped Slieve Gallion, and a long&#xD;
day's exercise had given him a keen rel-&#xD;
ish for the evening banquet. . The Lady&#xD;
Abbess feasted the patron of her house&#xD;
right nobly-he was attended on assidu-&#xD;
ously by the novices-dish after dish&#xD;
succeeded in luxurious variety, until the&#xD;
chief requested the tables to be drawn,&#xD;
and with knightly courtesy entreated per-&#xD;
mission to pledge the holy mother of the&#xD;
Ursulines in a deep draught of Rhenish&#xD;
wine.&#xD;
Then for the first time, the novice who&#xD;
presented the cup, attracted the good&#xD;
knight's attention. ThQ folds of her&#xD;
thick veil could not conceal the matchless&#xD;
symmetry of her form; and as she filled&#xD;
the chalice from the flagon,' the exquisite&#xD;
proportions of her hand and arm struck&#xD;
Cormac More with wonder. At this mo-&#xD;
ment her drapery became entangled with&#xD;
the jewelled pommel of the Knight's ra-&#xD;
pier; a hasty attempt to disengage it was&#xD;
unsuccessful--the veil fell, and disclosed&#xD;
to the enraptured view of the Lord of Ive-&#xD;
augh the loveliest features he had ever&#xD;
seen.  Covered with   blushes, which&#xD;
heightened her surpassing beauty, the&#xD;
novice caught her veil hastily up and re-&#xD;
tired from the parlour, while the Knight,&#xD;
despite the evident displeasure that the&#xD;
accident had caused the Lady Abbess,&#xD;
gazed after 'the retiring girl until she dis-&#xD;

The Legend of Rose Roche.&#xD;
&#xD;
appeared among the cloisters.   In vai&#xD;
the proud Superior introduced costib&#xD;
&#xD;
in&#xD;
er&#xD;
&#xD;
wines of rare and ancient vintages ; in;&#xD;
vain she enlarged upon the piety- of her'&#xD;
order, and enumerated.the number of the&#xD;
Ursulines who had been canonized; the&#xD;
Knight's whole thoughts were engrossed&#xD;
'with one lovely object--his courtesy and&#xD;
converse were feeble and constrained, un-&#xD;
til, piqued by his neglect, the Abbess&#xD;
wished him a fair repose, and retired in&#xD;
full state from the apartment, preceded&#xD;
by crucifix and taper, and followed by&#xD;
her attendant nuns.&#xD;
Although the Knight lay on the Bish-&#xD;
op's bed, and occupied that honored cham-&#xD;
ber where none of a less degree than a&#xD;
mitred abbot had hitherto been permitted&#xD;
to repose, no slumber sealed his lids, nor&#xD;
was the' beautiful novice for a moment&#xD;
absent from his thoughts. - Cormac More&#xD;
had declined many a splendid alliance ;&#xD;
the Lord of Offaly proffered him an only&#xD;
sister, with a princely dower; and O'Nial&#xD;
himself courted him for a son-in-law, and&#xD;
promised him the barony of Orier, and&#xD;
Blanche, his fairest daughter. But till&#xD;
now, Cormac had never loved: the beau-&#xD;
teous cup-bearer seemed to him a being&#xD;
of another world; the more he dwelt&#xD;
upon her image, the more his passion&#xD;
was excited; alliances with lords and&#xD;
princes were overlooked, disparity of rank&#xD;
and fortune was forgotten, and, ere the&#xD;
morning sun ad lighted the storied win-&#xD;
dowof the Bislop's chamber, the Knight'st&#xD;
determination was formed, and matins 1&#xD;
were scarcely over when he demanded&#xD;
an audience of the Lady Abbess.     i&#xD;
Never was there greater surprise than f&#xD;
that, with which the holy Mother heard&#xD;
Cormac More express his passion for the&#xD;
novice of the Ursulines. - Joy sparkled&#xD;
in her eyes as the noble Lord of Iveaughc&#xD;
confided the secret of his love, entreated t&#xD;
her powerful intercession, and begged force&#xD;
her sanction to "his nuptials. - As- Rose r&#xD;
was still unprofessed, there existed no f&#xD;
spiritual barrier to her marriage. Flat- r&#xD;
tered by the high honor conferred upon o&#xD;
her house by the proudest Baron of the&#xD;
Pale selecting a bridle from the holy sis- i.&#xD;
terhood, the Superior willingly acceded b&#xD;
to his request ; his offers were accepted, a&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
I&#xD;
1&#xD;
c&#xD;
c&#xD;
t&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
and ere the vesper bell had tolled, the&#xD;
preliminaries were completed, and the&#xD;
fair novice had consented to become the&#xD;
bride of Cormac More.&#xD;
But, alas ! the wild ardor of the.good&#xD;
Knight, and the carnal motives of the&#xD;
Abbess, caused both to neglect consulting&#xD;
another personage, namely, the blessed&#xD;
Ursula herself, in thus disposing-of one&#xD;
devoted to her service from the cradle;&#xD;
and the saint felt the oversight. That&#xD;
night the Abbess was tormented with&#xD;
fearful and portentous dreams ; the Lord&#xD;
of Iveaugh tossed restlessly upon the Bish-&#xD;
op's bed ; and if the novice closed an&#xD;
eye, her slumbers were broken with&#xD;
strange and incoherent visions. In vain&#xD;
next day, the Knight hunted from sunrise&#xD;
to curfew-his hounds were eternally at&#xD;
fault, and his followers appeared besotted&#xD;
or bewitched ; the deer, when pressed to&#xD;
the utmost, vanished on a bare moor-and&#xD;
knight, squire, and, yeoman, unanimously&#xD;
agreed that the several parties interested&#xD;
in the chase, were under the immediate&#xD;
influence of the Prince of Darkness.&#xD;
Nor did the holy Superior of the Ur-&#xD;
sulines fare better than the persecuted&#xD;
Knight and his afflicted companions.&#xD;
Every thing about the convent went&#xD;
astray, and the culinary preparations for&#xD;
entertaining the Lord of Iveaugh were&#xD;
awfuIlly interrupted by accident and for-&#xD;
getfulness. The sister who presided&#xD;
over the pastry, and whose conserves,&#xD;
throughout a long and blameless life, had&#xD;
been pronounced-unique and irreproach-&#xD;
able, now actually omitted the necessary&#xD;
ingredients ; the soup, when uncovered&#xD;
for a second, was invaded with such a,&#xD;
discharge of soot, as reduced it, in color&#xD;
at least, to an equality with the broth of&#xD;
Sparta. The nun at the organ, instead&#xD;
of a "jubilate" struck up a "nunc dimit-&#xD;
is ;" the very bells were "jangled out&#xD;
of tune"--and the Lady Abbess was hor-&#xD;
ified by a succession of prodigies that,&#xD;
~rom her noviciate to her promotion, had&#xD;
ever before visited the quiet residence&#xD;
~f the sisterhood of Saint Ursula.&#xD;
What were the nocturnal visitations&#xD;
inflicted upon the lovely novice, have not&#xD;
een exactly handed down. One thing&#xD;
lone is certain. She visited the Lady&#xD;
&#xD;
Abbess with the first dawn, and in her&#xD;
maternal bosom the bride elect deposited&#xD;
the causes of her sorrow.&#xD;
In thisperplexity, the Knight and the&#xD;
a Superior held secret counsel in the-par-&#xD;
lor of the convent, and long and difficult&#xD;
was the conference. The result was,&#xD;
that Cormac More vowed a golden cha-&#xD;
lice to the offended virgin; and the Ab-&#xD;
bess, not to be outdone in liberality,&#xD;
agreed to double ayes and credos for a-&#xD;
fortnight. But with Rose Roche herself&#xD;
the chief difficulty was found to lie. "A11&#xD;
measures proposed by the holy mother&#xD;
were inefficacious ; and, in this desperate&#xD;
dilemma, it was deemed advisable to add&#xD;
to the number of counsellors, and the&#xD;
Prior of the Dominicans was summoned&#xD;
to the assistance of the conclave.&#xD;
To that holy man the exigencies of the&#xD;
respective parties were intrusted. The&#xD;
Prior was sorely disturbed with doubts,&#xD;
but after a night's deliberation, during&#xD;
which he discussed a capon single hand.,&#xD;
ed, and fortified his stomach with a sec-&#xD;
ond stoop of Rhenish wine, he decided&#xD;
that the Lord of Iveaugh should add a&#xD;
flagon to the chalice-the Abbess double&#xD;
her penitentiaries for a month-and Rose&#xD;
Roche undergo a private penance, which&#xD;
he, the Prior, should communicate to the&#xD;
lady alone.&#xD;
Never had such an alarming predica-&#xD;
ment a happier termination ! The Knight&#xD;
had scarcely laid himself upon the Bish-&#xD;
op's bed, until a sweet and refreshing&#xD;
slumber, blessed, with the happiest vis-&#xD;
ions, sealed his eyes ; the Lady Abbess&#xD;
slept like a watchman ; and since she&#xD;
had first gathered wild flowers in the con-&#xD;
vent garden, never did the fair novice en-&#xD;
joy more delightful dreams.&#xD;
At last the bridal day arrived. The&#xD;
Lord of Iveaugh was attended by a splen-&#xD;
did following. The bells rang out a joy-&#xD;
Sous peal, and the 6leve of the Ursulines&#xD;
Left the home of her youth, escorted by&#xD;
Three hundred horsemen, the consort of&#xD;
Sthe proudest Baron of the Pale. No&#xD;
'lover could be more gallant than the noble&#xD;
Husband of Rose Roche. Fete succeeded&#xD;
fete, and feasting continued in the castle&#xD;
of Cormac More, from Michaelnas till&#xD;

A Iv&#xD;
&#xD;
Months passed away, and honey-&#xD;
moons can not be expected to last for&#xD;
ever. Cormac More by-degrees resumed&#xD;
his hunting, and again involved himself&#xD;
in the endless feuds and warfare of those&#xD;
restless times; and-Rose Roche was oft-&#xD;
en deserted for the chase or the field.&#xD;
She still was passionately loved, but in&#xD;
the bosom of a martial Baron other and&#xD;
sterner feelings held a predominance. It&#xD;
is true that the young bride bore these&#xD;
frequent absences with wonderful resig-&#xD;
nation; and page and tire-woman confess-&#xD;
ed in secret, that Dhu Castle was gayer&#xD;
and merrier when Cormac and his stern&#xD;
companions were away.&#xD;
A year wore on. The Lord of Iveaugh&#xD;
was pensive and thoughtful; a cloud would&#xD;
often gather on his brow, and his bearing&#xD;
to his beautiful wife became chilling and,&#xD;
repulsive. It transpired that two circum-&#xD;
stances occasioned his anxiety. His lady&#xD;
wore a curious-fashioned coif, which con-&#xD;
cealed her tressesas effectually as if she&#xD;
never laid aside her night-cap ; and the&#xD;
cherished hope of an heir to his ancient&#xD;
line now faded in the heart 'of Cormac&#xD;
More. Dhu Castle became duller and&#xD;
more gloomy-the fair Baroness was&#xD;
more and more deserted-the chase and&#xD;
banquet were preferred by the moody&#xD;
Knight to soft dalliance in his "lady's&#xD;
bower,'' and any pretext was gladly re-&#xD;
sorted to, which offered an excuse for&#xD;
being absent from his joyless home.&#xD;
Gentlewomen, in these perilous days,&#xD;
required and possessed an astonishing&#xD;
portion of philosophy. No Baron's lady&#xD;
"in the Pale" submitted to a frequent&#xD;
separation from her lord, with more laud-&#xD;
able submission than Rose Roche. The&#xD;
customary resource of " wives bereaved,"&#xD;
appeared any thing but consolatory to the&#xD;
dame. She determined to avoid crying,&#xD;
as being an unchristian waste of beauty&#xD;
..-.-and instead of -useless lamentations,&#xD;
she wisely substituted mirth and mini-&#xD;
strelsy.&#xD;
There was not a more accomplished&#xD;
hard in Ulster than Connor O'Cahan,&#xD;
and for seventy years he had resided&#xD;
with the Lords of Iveaugh. No tale or&#xD;
tradition connected with this puissant&#xD;
race was unknown to this gifted minstrel;&#xD;

&#xD;
The Legend of Rose Roche..&#xD;
&#xD;
yet by some strange infirmity of taste&#xD;
young Rose preferred the light romance&#xD;
of her Lord's English page, to all the 1&#xD;
gendary lore of the gray-haired harper&#xD;
and listened with more delight to a men&#xD;
roundelay from Edwin's lute, than to th&#xD;
deeds of Cormac's grandfather, as s&#xD;
out in song by Connor O'Cahan. TI&#xD;
bard, it is, true, was blind, and the pag&#xD;
had the-blackest eyes imaginable.&#xD;
This unhappy predilection was nc&#xD;
concealed from her Lord. His jealous&#xD;
instantly took fire, and. the handsome&#xD;
page was suddenly removed,,and non&#xD;
knew whither. The absence of an hei&#xD;
had now become matter for serious com&#xD;
plaint; it was whispered among the Ba]&#xD;
on's followers, that there was no caus&#xD;
for hope, and maliciously insinuated&#xD;
moreover, that the close coif adopted b;&#xD;
the dame, was worn to conceal some na&#xD;
tural deformity. Cormac, a slave to sus&#xD;
picion, and instigated by his rude com&#xD;
panions, insisted that the hood should b&#xD;
discarded, or that Rose Roche should re&#xD;
tire in disgrace to the convent front&#xD;
whence she came.&#xD;
On the alternative being proposed, th&#xD;
Lady proved positive, and the coif wa&#xD;
peremptorily retained. Cormac, irritates&#xD;
by opposition to his commands, was ob&#xD;
stinate in his determination, and Ros&#xD;
Roche left the castle of her lord a repu&#xD;
diated wife, and once more returned to&#xD;
the convent of the Ursulines.&#xD;
From the hour of their separation, the&#xD;
Baron seldom smiled. To part from his&#xD;
wife was a trifle; but unluckily he had&#xD;
embroiled himself with the church. The&#xD;
Abbess espoused the lady's quarrel fierce&#xD;
ly, and ave and credo were no longer of&#xD;
fered up for Cormac More ! Notwith&#xD;
standing past largess, beeves and wine-&#xD;
butts were forgotten; the caidle-sticks&#xD;
upon the altar no longer elicited a prayer;&#xD;
and his soul's health was no more attend-&#xD;
ed to by the community, than the lowest&#xD;
horse-boys of his train..&#xD;
Thus matters stood; when one dark&#xD;
evening, returning from the chase, Cor-&#xD;
mac and his. followers were surprised by&#xD;
a bandi of Catterans, and a fierce and&#xD;
desperate skirmish ensued. The outlaws&#xD;
were defeated, but the Lord of Iveaugh&#xD;
&#xD;
I~&#xD;
&#xD;
te, was shot clean, through tlge body with a&#xD;
es three-foot arrow; and how could he have&#xD;
e- better luck ?&#xD;
r ;  Then it was that the sinful Knight was&#xD;
ry tortured with remorse and unavailing sor-&#xD;
e row. He cursed the evil counsellors who&#xD;
et tempted him to insult Saint Ursula and&#xD;
e her adopted daughter, and determining to&#xD;
e be reconciled to his wife and the church&#xD;
together, directed his followers to carry&#xD;
ot him to the Abbey of Balleek. His or-&#xD;
y ders were obeyed, and the Lady Abbess&#xD;
e consented to admit the dying noble. He&#xD;
te was laid before the altar, and his injured&#xD;
ir wife, forgetting past resentment, was the&#xD;
1- first to rush from her cell, andminister&#xD;
r- to his relief. In the fatal emergency,&#xD;
e coif and veil were left behind; her raven&#xD;
1, tresses fell below  her shoulders, and&#xD;
y reached to her very waist, and Cormac&#xD;
1- was convinced, too late, that his ill-used&#xD;
consort had the finest hair in Christen-&#xD;
- dom. Alas ! those ebon locks had been&#xD;
e the admiration of the whole sisterhood--&#xD;
and for penitential purposes, the Domi-&#xD;
n nican had enjoined their concealment for&#xD;
three years, when he gave spiritual coun-&#xD;
e sel, in their hour of tribulation, to the&#xD;
s Abbess, the Baron, and Rose Roche.&#xD;
d   To make atonement for his former un-&#xD;
- kindness, he willed his rich domains to&#xD;
e his beautiful widow. The Prior of the&#xD;
- Dominicans indited the deed, which dis-&#xD;
posed of:his possessions ; and the church,&#xD;
of course, was not forgotten. Surround-&#xD;
ed by all the emblems of religion, and&#xD;
with. a splinter of the true, cross in his&#xD;
I right hand, the penitent Baron breathed&#xD;
his last. He lay for three days and&#xD;
- nights in the chancel, in great state; and&#xD;
was interred on the fourth morning, with&#xD;
- all the ceremonies that both Ursulines&#xD;
- and Dominicans could bestow.&#xD;
The days of mourning passed over:&#xD;
Rose Roche exercised her resignation;&#xD;
and Dhu Castle became a different place&#xD;
to what it had been during the latter days&#xD;
of the defunct Baron, and mirth and mu-&#xD;
sic were exchanged for the rude revelry&#xD;
of Cormac More. Her hail was filled&#xD;
with guests; at the board she (lid the&#xD;
honors nobly ; and when she visited the&#xD;
green wood, with her gold-belled hawks&#xD;
and gallant retinue, she looked as if she&#xD;
&#xD;
iad been ennobled from the Conquest,'&#xD;
,and in her bearing and attire, seemed&#xD;
N'every inch a queen."&#xD;
i  But amidst all this splendor and mag-&#xD;
1niflcenee, poor Rose had her own secret&#xD;
-causes of inquietude. Beauty accompa-&#xD;
1ied by broad lands, could not but induce&#xD;
sailors without lumber to come forward,&#xD;
hand never was woman, not excepting&#xD;
.Penelope herself, more vigorously be-&#xD;
?sieged. From past experience, Rose&#xD;
dwas not ambitious to exchange wealth&#xD;
land liberty for becoming the wife of some&#xD;
:doughty Baron, who would probably un-&#xD;
dervalue her charms, just as much as he&#xD;
I would over-estimate his' own great con-&#xD;
descension in giving her his name. A&#xD;
tender recollection of one, long since lost,&#xD;
would cross her mind occasionally, and&#xD;
in her solitary hours the black-eyed page&#xD;
haunted her imagination. Accordingly&#xD;
she eschewed all offers for her hand, with&#xD;
excellent discretion. Few were offended,&#xD;
she managed her rejections so prudently ;&#xD;
4and through the first year of widowhood,&#xD;
neither land nor liberty were lost.&#xD;
The consort of the wise Ulysses her-&#xD;
,self could not have held out forever.&#xD;
Rose was severely pressed; for finding&#xD;
' themselves foiled by her ready wit and&#xD;
good discretion when they attacked her&#xD;
singly, her lovers, fromnenecessity, agreed&#xD;
to coalesce, and determined that one&#xD;
should be accepted, and, the remainder be&#xD;
pledged to support the acquired rights of&#xD;
the fortunate candidate, as report said&#xD;
King Henry had resolved to gift a favor-&#xD;
ite noble with the person and estates of&#xD;
the beautiful widow.&#xD;
This agreement of her suitors was po-'&#xD;
litely but decisively intimated to Rose&#xD;
Roche, and the Prior declared, " by the&#xD;
' vestment," that to evade matrimony lon-&#xD;
ger was impossible. "She had," the&#xD;
' holy man said, "an ample list to choose&#xD;
Sfromr; there were eleven suitors in the&#xD;
~neighborhood, besides the ' Big Man of&#xD;
the West,' for so the Thane of Con-&#xD;
~naught was entitled."&#xD;
~jIn thisextremity the lady resolved to&#xD;
exercise, at least, the privilege of free&#xD;
1 choice. The Prior was directed to en-&#xD;
gross a bond, by which the respective&#xD;
i candidates for her hand bound themselves&#xD;
&#xD;
to grant an uncontrolled right of selec-&#xD;
tion to the widow, and covenanted, more-&#xD;
over, neither to molest, or permit her to&#xD;
be molested, when her choice was made.&#xD;
The deed was duly executed-the day&#xD;
for her decision was named-and a rea-&#xD;
sonable time allowed for " the Big Man&#xD;
of the West" to attend and try his for-&#xD;
tune.&#xD;
O'Connor was surprised when the de-&#xD;
termination of the widow was communi-&#xD;
cated. He had only time for a hurried&#xD;
preparation, as his rivals, from their vi-&#xD;
cinity to the lady, had never taken the&#xD;
remoter situation of the " Big Man" into&#xD;
their consideration, when they named the&#xD;
day. O'Connor, however, was no slug-&#xD;
gard ; he collected his "following" with&#xD;
all haste, and every department was com-&#xD;
plete, when, alas, the chief harper fell&#xD;
sick without -a cause, and no other was&#xD;
procurable for a distance of sixty miles.&#xD;
In this dilemma a Saxon youth, who, two&#xD;
years since, had been shipwrecked- be-&#xD;
neath the castle walls, was recollected.&#xD;
He could not, it is true, "strike the bold&#xD;
harp," but he had a sweet and mellow&#xD;
voice, and his skill upon the lute was ad-&#xD;
mirable. In wood-craft he was a thorough&#xD;
proficient, and with lance and brand had&#xD;
more than once proved himself a man.&#xD;
O'Connor had no alternative, and the&#xD;
stranger was selected to fill the place that&#xD;
"Cathwold O'Connor of the harp" should;&#xD;
have more worthily occupied.&#xD;
Although the Thane of Connaught and&#xD;
his gallant company pushed forward with&#xD;
all the speed that man and horse could&#xD;
make, from bad roads and flooded rivers,&#xD;
they were unable to reach the heights&#xD;
above Dhu Castle until the sun of the&#xD;
eventful day had set. In vain knight and&#xD;
squire pressed on their jaded steeds-&#xD;
evening fell; all the- candidates'besides&#xD;
had been in the hall for hours, and, as&#xD;
"the Big Man" had not appeared, ac-&#xD;
cording to modern parlance he was voted&#xD;
present by the company, and the banquet&#xD;
was served. Never with such a heavy&#xD;
heart did Rose Roche assume the place&#xD;
of honor. Though her hall was lighted-&#xD;
splendidly, and her table crowded with&#xD;
the proudest nobles within "the Pale"--&#xD;
though rich wvine flowed, and the most&#xD;

62                     The Legend of Rose Roche.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Legend of Rose Roche.&#xD;
&#xD;
skilful harpers in the province poured&#xD;
forth their lays of love and war-yet one&#xD;
heart was heedless of gaiety and grandeur;&#xD;
and that one was her's on whom every&#xD;
eye was bent, in deep expectancy await-&#xD;
ing her decision.&#xD;
The curfew rang-and -in another hour&#xD;
the happy Lord of Dhu Castle would be&#xD;
proclaimed. As the moments flew, the&#xD;
beautiful widow became paler and more&#xD;
dejected; and breasts which had never&#xD;
quailed amid the roar of battle, now&#xD;
throbbed as nervously as a maiden's,&#xD;
when she listens to the first 4ale of love.&#xD;
The harps were mute, the revel became&#xD;
less loud, for all were deeply interested&#xD;
in that event which a brief space must&#xD;
determine. At this embarrassing moment,&#xD;
a loud blast was heard at the grand gate,&#xD;
and the seneschal rushed in, to announce&#xD;
the arrival of the Thane of Connaught,-&#xD;
attended by a noble following of, at least,&#xD;
one hundred horse.&#xD;
The sudden and opportune appearance&#xD;
of him of the West, seemed to affect the&#xD;
company variously. His rivals heard the&#xD;
news with mingled feelings of jealousy&#xD;
and alarm, which was in no ways abated&#xD;
when the number of his attendants was&#xD;
announced, which exceeded that of their&#xD;
united followings. Rose Roche felt a&#xD;
secret pleasure at his coming; not that&#xD;
her sentiments towards O'Connor were&#xD;
more favorable than to her suitors gene-&#xD;
rally, but his late arrival must-.necessarily&#xD;
occasion some delay, and postpone,&#xD;
though but for a brief space, that dreaded&#xD;
moment when she. should surrender a&#xD;
hand, without a heart, to her future lord.&#xD;
While O'Connor, as the greatest stran&#xD;
ger, was placed beside the lady of Dhu&#xD;
Castle, his bard stood behind his master,&#xD;
and his train bestowed themselves where&#xD;
they could best find room. As Rose&#xD;
Roche looked carefully around to see that&#xD;
the band were fitly, accommodated, her&#xD;
eyes met those of the young minstrel:-&#xD;
the blood rushed to her brow ; for ex-&#xD;
cepting those of her own loved page, she&#xD;
never looked upon a pair so black and&#xD;
sparkling as the stranger' .&#xD;
When the Trhane of Connaught had&#xD;
feasted to his heart's content, the Prior&#xD;
of the Dominicans produced the parch-&#xD;
&#xD;
ment, to which his rivals had affixed their&#xD;
signatures already.  The "Big Man"&#xD;
listened attentively as the monk read it.&#xD;
"'Tis all fair," he added, as he placed&#xD;
his sign manual to the deed, "that the;&#xD;
lady should choose her lord ; and thus I"&#xD;
bind myself, faithfully to abide the intents!&#xD;
of this parchment." Then turning to&#xD;
Rose Roche, he thus proceeded: "It&#xD;
grieves me that through accident I have&#xD;
unwittingly occasioned some delay; there-&#xD;
fore, in pity to my gallant competitors, I&#xD;
beg you, lady, to terminate their suspense,&#xD;
and declare to this noble company the&#xD;
happy object of your choice-nay, blanchi&#xD;
not so, fair dame," for t  lady became&#xD;
pallid as the white marb  of a warrior's',"&#xD;
tomb; "exercise your own pleasure lei-&#xD;
surely; and while I pledge thy matchless&#xD;
beauty in a cup of muscadine, Aylhner,&#xD;
my bard, shall sing a Saxon roundelay."&#xD;
As he spoke, O'Connor signed to the,&#xD;
minstrel, who, rising at his lord's bid-.&#xD;
ding, struck with a rapid hand the pre-.&#xD;
lude of a light romance, which, with aj&#xD;
tremulous, but powerful voice, he thus&#xD;
gave words to:&#xD;
"Ladye, farewell !-the fatal hour&#xD;
Has sped, for thus thy tyrant wills,&#xD;
When he, who loves thee, leaves this tower,&#xD;
Deserts gay hall and woodland bower&#xD;
Of her, for whom his heart's pulse thrills;&#xD;
And thou art she-Ladye--sweet Ladye."&#xD;
When the minstrel touched the pre-&#xD;
lude, Rose Roche became visibly affect-&#xD;
ed ;ut when the words fell from  his~&#xD;
lips, a burning blush dyed her cheek and&#xD;
brow, and her heart throbbed almost t6&#xD;
bursting. Alas, it was the very rounde-&#xD;
lay the poor page had sung beneath her&#xD;
casement on that melancholy night when&#xD;
her defunct lord had expelled him from&#xD;
the castle !-&#xD;
She turned hastily round to see who&#xD;
the strange youth might be, who thus re-&#xD;
called her absent love in look and voice&#xD;
so forcibly. Blessed Ursula ! it was he,&#xD;
the long lost page. The minstrel,.as he&#xD;
caught her eyes, suddenly ceased his&#xD;
melody-the lute fell from his nerveless&#xD;
grasp, and, oee      by feelings that&#xD;
could not be controlle eJr sank upon the&#xD;
bench behind him. It was, indeed, young&#xD;
&#xD;
$ylmer. The well remembered features&#xD;
;ould never be forgotten, although the&#xD;
.oy had ripened into manhood--the thick&#xD;
down upon the lip had changed to a dark&#xD;
;noustache-and the belt which once held&#xD;
hunting blade, supported now a goodly&#xD;
brand.&#xD;
The strange effect of the melody upon&#xD;
the lady, and the minstrel's sudden indis-&#xD;
Aposition, could not escape remark ; a&#xD;
startling suspicion flashed across the&#xD;
,minds of the company, and after a pain-&#xD;
ful silence of some minutes, Hubert de&#xD;
Moore rose from his seat, and bowing to&#xD;
the very table, thus addressed the lady of&#xD;
1 the castle:&#xD;
" Wilt thou forgive the humblest but&#xD;
most devoted of -thy suitors, if he pre-&#xD;
sume to remind you that the hour has&#xD;
long since passed when your election&#xD;
should have been made?  Far be it from&#xD;
me, noble dame, to seem importunate; but&#xD;
suspense is irksome to those that love,&#xD;
and I and my brother nobles pray you to&#xD;
signify your pleasure, and end uncertain-&#xD;
ty at once."&#xD;
While De Moore was speaking, Rose&#xD;
Roche appeared to recover her self-pos-&#xD;
session wonderfully ; her eye brightened,&#xD;
her color came again, and the compres-&#xD;
sion of her lips proved that she was nerv-&#xD;
ing herself for some determined effort.&#xD;
She rose slowly and gracefully, while a&#xD;
dead silence pervaded the hall; faint and&#xD;
tremulous as her first words were, they&#xD;
were distinctly heard by those remotest&#xD;
from the dais.*&#xD;
" Noble lords," she said, " I own and&#xD;
thank your courtesy: I ask; this holy&#xD;
churchman if I am to exercise free choice&#xD;
in this affair, unshackled with bar, or con-&#xD;
dition, save my own pleasure ; and if he&#xD;
whom I shall place here," and she point-&#xD;
ed to the vacant seat beside her own,&#xD;
which had been reserved for the success-&#xD;
ful wooer, "shall be supported in all the&#xD;
rights and properties which he shall ob-&#xD;
tain through me?"&#xD;
"All this," said the Prior, "is fairly&#xD;
stipulated in the intents of this scroll."&#xD;
"Then will I not trespass on your pa-&#xD;
tience, noble lords,-there stands the oh-&#xD;
*The place of honor in a Baronial hall.&#xD;
&#xD;
ject of my choice ; and thus I instal him&#xD;
in this seat, as Lord and Master of Dhu&#xD;
Castle?"&#xD;
She turned to the astonished minstrel&#xD;
as she spoke, and ere her words were&#xD;
ended, the youth was seated at her side.&#xD;
A scene of wonder and wild confusion&#xD;
followed--most of the Barons protested&#xD;
loudly against her choice ; angry looks&#xD;
and threatening gestures were directed at&#xD;
the minstrel, and more than one sword&#xD;
was half unsheathed. O'Connor seemed,,&#xD;
thunderstruck-and the lady herself was&#xD;
the most collected of the company.&#xD;
" How is this, Sir Knights ?" she cri-&#xD;
ed. " Is lordly word and written pledge&#xD;
so lightly held among you, that thus ye&#xD;
violate their sanctity? .Thane of Con-&#xD;
naught," she continued, as she addressed"&#xD;
herself to the ' Big Man,' "thy faith was&#xD;
never questioned, and thy word is held&#xD;
to be sacred as a martyr's vow. When&#xD;
the English King, under. pain of confis-&#xD;
cation, ordered thee to deliver the stran-&#xD;

lands may go, but plighted faith must&#xD;
stand.' The ink with which you bound*&#xD;
yourself to the conditions of yonder&#xD;
bond, is not yet dry upon the parchment,&#xD;

"It is a trick," cried De Moore.&#xD;
"'The selection rests with ourselves&#xD;
alone," exclaimed Mandeville.&#xD;
"We will never brook that page or&#xD;
minstrel should hold the lands and castles&#xD;
of Cormac More," said both togeth r; and&#xD;
they laid their hands upon their s ords;&#xD;
the attendants followed the example of&#xD;
their lords, and a scene of violence and&#xD;
discord was about immediately to ensue.&#xD;
O'Connor slowly rose-he waved his&#xD;
hand to command silence, and his wishes&#xD;
were promptly obeyed.&#xD;
"Trhis is, indleed,an unexpected choice,"&#xD;
he said: "'Sir Prior, read the parchment&#xD;
aloud, that all may hear, and read it care-&#xD;
fully, line after line, and syllable by syl-&#xD;
lable; see that a letter be not omitted."&#xD;
The monk obeyed. " The document is&#xD;

LEGENDARY BALLAD.&#xD;
BY MR. MOORE.&#xD;
TILE   MAGIC MIRROR.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Come, if thy magic glass have power&#xD;
To call up forms we sigh to see;&#xD;
Show me my love in that rosy bower,&#xD;
Where last she pledged her troth to me."&#xD;
The wizard showed his lady bright,&#xD;
Where lone and pale in her bower she lay ;&#xD;
" True hearted maid," saidthe happy knight,&#xD;
"She's thinking of one who's far away."&#xD;
But lo! a page, with looks of joy,&#xD;
Brings tidings to the lady's ear,&#xD;
"'Tis," said the knight, " the same bright boy&#xD;
Who used to guide me to my dear."&#xD;
The lady, now, from her favorite tree,&#xD;
Hath, smiling, pluck'd a rosy flower;&#xD;
" Such," he exclaimed, " was the gift that she&#xD;
Each morning sent me.from that bower !"&#xD;
Ehe gives her page that blooming rose,&#xD;
With looks that say, "Like lightning fly !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Thus," thought the knight, "she soothes her&#xD;
woes,&#xD;
By fancying still her true love nigh !"&#xD;
But the page returns, and--oh ! what a sight&#xD;
For a true lover's eye to see ;&#xD;
Leads to that bower another knight,&#xD;
As gay, and, alas ! as loved as he!&#xD;
"Such," quoth the youth, "is woman's love !"&#xD;
Then darting forth with furious bound,&#xD;
Dash'd at the mirror his iron glove,&#xD;
And strewed it all in fragments round.&#xD;
MORAL.&#xD;
Such ill would neverhhave come to pass,&#xD;
Had he ne'er sought that fatal view;&#xD;
The wizard still would have kept his glass,&#xD;
And the knight still thought his lady true.&#xD;

ventured to think, that though in the first&#xD;
instance such players must have possess-&#xD;
ed the feelings which they so powerfully&#xD;
called up in others, yet by frequent repe-&#xD;
tition those feelings must become dead-&#xD;
ened in a great measure, and the perform-&#xD;
er trust to the menmtory of past emotion,&#xD;
rather than express a present one. She&#xD;
indignantly repelled the notion, that with&#xD;
a truly great tragedian the operation, by&#xD;
which such effects-were produced upon&#xD;
an audience, could ever degrade itself into&#xD;
what was purely mechanical. With much&#xD;
delicacy, avoiding to instance in her se/-&#xD;
experience, she told me, that so long ago&#xD;
as when she used to play the part of the&#xD;
Little Son to Mrs. Porter's. Isabella, (I&#xD;
think it was) when that impressive ac-&#xD;
tress has been bending over her in some&#xD;
heart-rending colloquy, she has felt real&#xD;
hot tears come trickling from her, which&#xD;
(to use her powerful expression) have&#xD;
perfectly scalded her back.&#xD;
I am not quite so sure that it was Mrs.&#xD;
Porter ; but'it was some great actress of&#xD;
that day. The name is indifferent ; but&#xD;
the fact of the scalding tears I most dis-&#xD;
tinctly remember.&#xD;
I was always fond of the society of&#xD;
players, and am not sure that an impedi-&#xD;
ment in my speech (which certainly kept&#xD;
me out of the pulpit) even more than&#xD;
certain personal disqualifications, which&#xD;
are often got over in that profession, did&#xD;
not prevent me at one time of life-from&#xD;
adopting it. I have had the honor (I&#xD;
must ever call it) once to have been ad-&#xD;
mitted to the tea-table of Miss Kelly.&#xD;
I have played at serious whist with Mr.&#xD;
Liston. I have chatted with ever good-&#xD;
humored Mrs. Charles Kemble. I have&#xD;
conversed as friend to friend with her ac-&#xD;
complished husband, I have been'in-&#xD;
dulged with a classical conference with&#xD;
Macready ; and with a sight of the player-&#xD;
picture gallery, at Mr. Matthews's, when&#xD;
the kind owner, to remunerate me for my&#xD;
love of the old actors (whom lie loves&#xD;
so much) went over it with me, supply-&#xD;
ing to his capital collection, what alone&#xD;
the artist could not give them-voice ;&#xD;
and their living motion. Old tones, half-&#xD;
faded, of Dodd and Parsons, and Badde-&#xD;
ley, have lived again for me at his bidding.&#xD;
Only Edwin he could not restore to me,.&#xD;
&#xD;
I have supped with.-&#xD;
&#xD;
but I am grow-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing a coxcomb.&#xD;
As I was about to say-at the desk of&#xD;
the then treasurer of the Old Bath Thea-&#xD;
tre-not Diamond's-presented herself&#xD;
the little Barbara S-.&#xD;
The parents of Barb ira had been in&#xD;
reputable circumstances.  The father&#xD;
had practised, I believe, as an apothecary&#xD;
in the town. But his practice, from&#xD;
causes which I feel my own infirmity too&#xD;
sensibly that way to arraign-or perhaps&#xD;
from that pure infelicity which accompa-&#xD;
nies some people in their walk through&#xD;
life, andch it is impossible to lay at&#xD;
the do r of imprudence-was now re-&#xD;
duced to nothing. They were in fact in&#xD;
the very teeth of starvation, when the&#xD;
manager, who knew and respected them&#xD;
in better days, took the little Barbara into&#xD;
his company.&#xD;
At the period I commenced with, her&#xD;
slender 'earnings were the sole support&#xD;
of the family, including two younger sis-&#xD;
ters. I must throw a veil over some mor-&#xD;
tifying circumstances. Enough to -say,&#xD;
that her Saturday's pittance was the only&#xD;
chance of a Sunday's (generally their&#xD;
only) meal of meat.&#xD;
One thing I will only mention, that in&#xD;
some child's part, where in her theatri-&#xD;
cal character she was to sup off a roast&#xD;
fowl (0 joy to Barbara !) some comic&#xD;
actor, who was for the night caterer for&#xD;
this dainty-in the misguided humor of&#xD;
his part, threw over the dish such a quan-&#xD;
tity of salt (0 grief and pain of heart to,&#xD;
Barbara!) that when he crammed a por,&#xD;
tion of it into her mouth, she was obliged&#xD;
sputteringly to reject it; and with shame&#xD;
of her ill-acted part, and pain of real ap-&#xD;
petite at missing such a dainty, her little&#xD;
heart sobbed almost to breaking, till a&#xD;
flood of tears, which the well-fed spec-&#xD;
tators were totally unable to comprehend,.&#xD;
mercifully relieved her.&#xD;
This was the little starved, meritorious&#xD;
maid, who stood before old Ravenscroft,&#xD;
the treasurer, for her Saturday's pay-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
Ravenscroft was a man, I have heard&#xD;
many old theatrical people beside hierself&#xD;
say, of all men least calculated for a&#xD;
treasurer. He had no head for accounts,&#xD;
paid away at random, kept scarce any&#xD;

s1 Story of the Heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT is not our place to account for the&#xD;
perversity of the human heart, or our in-&#xD;
tention to excuse the inconstancy of hu-&#xD;
man nature. As for the fickleness of&#xD;
love, it is the old woman's axiom, time&#xD;
out of mind; as if love, to prove that it&#xD;
is so, ought necessarily to evince itself&#xD;
incapable of the changes to which alltthe&#xD;
material and immaterial world around us&#xD;
is alike liable. We say no such thing.&#xD;
We have seen, we have known, we can&#xD;
imagine; and without further argument&#xD;
on the, passion or no passion--the affec-&#xD;
tion or no affection which produced this&#xD;
or that consequence, we are content to&#xD;
draw our own conclusions. Therefore,&#xD;
without any sweeping denunciation against&#xD;
the race of man-without any libel against&#xD;
the law of love---without raising one man&#xD;
to the elevation of greater or better spirits&#xD;
-without degrading the species to the&#xD;
level of this one-we shall sketch a&#xD;
simple picture, in a simple way, and let&#xD;
the moral, if there be any, rest with the&#xD;
reader.&#xD;
The precepts scattered to the young&#xD;
are as seeds sown on the bosom of the&#xD;
earth; time shall roll on, but the season&#xD;
shall come round to show that the hus-&#xD;
bandman has been there ; and so it was&#xD;
with Delacour. Wealth, emolument, and&#xD;
self-interest, had been the lessons of his&#xD;
youth, and he had profited by them.;&#xD;
On the death of his father, a respectable&#xD;
tradesman, he found himself in fair cir-&#xD;
cumstagces; and--by aid of his profes-&#xD;
sion-for he was a lawyer--on the high&#xD;
road to reputadon, and it might be, to&#xD;
riches. Possessed of'a fine person, a,&#xD;
&#xD;
graceful demeanor, a majestic figure,&#xD;
pleasing voice, lively conversation, and&#xD;
easy vivacity, it is no wonder he got into&#xD;
good society, and, from thence, into some&#xD;
notice as a professional man. He was&#xD;
now turned thirty, and in the full career&#xD;
of fortune ; still. unmarried, still sought&#xD;
by anxious mothers, and wooed by for-&#xD;
ward daughters ; but he was not in love,&#xD;
or scarcely dared believe it himself. The,&#xD;
father of Emily Sidney was a merchant,&#xD;
who had been mainly instrumental in the&#xD;
good fortune to which Delacour had at-&#xD;
tained ; she was the heiress of a supposed&#xD;
large property, and the beauty of her cir-&#xD;
cle. This was enough to depress, a less&#xD;
ardent admirer or a more calculating man;&#xD;
but Delacour had owed much to chance,&#xD;
and perceiving as- he thought, something&#xD;
not altogether unpropitious to him, he&#xD;
commenced his secret suit.&#xD;
Ah ! I remember her as yesterday.&#xD;
She was then eighteen,--youth scarce&#xD;
mellowed into early womanhood. The&#xD;
face, as it peeped from the chastening&#xD;
chestnut ringlets around it, was worthy&#xD;
the hand of a painter, though the smile&#xD;
that played on the lip might have defied&#xD;
his skill; the small and well-rounded&#xD;
figure vied with sculpture, but marble had&#xD;
vainly essayed to express the grace and&#xD;
dignity of thyt demeanor, And this was&#xD;
the least part of all. She knew what was&#xD;
kindness and charity, and practised 'what&#xD;
she knew. She--but let her story de-&#xD;
lineate her character.&#xD;
It must be presumed that Delacour&#xD;
was, in his way, ambitious, and this was&#xD;
the object at which he now aimed. He&#xD;
&#xD;
A STORY OF THE HEART,&#xD;
&#xD;
had imagined beauty; here was beauty&#xD;
unrivalled, unexcelled ;-virtue,--here was&#xD;
virtue the most alluring; modesty, sim-&#xD;
plicity, truth, love, all combined in one ;&#xD;
and for fortune, here was such as he could&#xD;
never have anticipated; connexions the&#xD;
most to be desired, and influence the&#xD;
most to be coveted. But why reason&#xD;
upon it! She should be his in any con-&#xD;
dition of life,-her beauty were alone&#xD;
dowry fit for a prince. In all stations&#xD;
alike lovely, alike to be desired. In such&#xD;
extacies he passed his hours; when a&#xD;
new suitor appeared in the person of a&#xD;
young baronet of considerable fortune.&#xD;
Money was nothing to him, and happi-&#xD;
ness every thing. Equally handsome&#xD;
and agreeable, and more rich than Dela-&#xD;
cour, he was, in every respect, no com-&#xD;
mon rival; besides which, all the arts of&#xD;
a -true lover were devised to secure the&#xD;
treasre to himself. About this time Mr.&#xD;
Sidney incurred a great loss of property&#xD;
by an unlucky speculation. The affair&#xD;
was stated to the baronet-the carriage&#xD;
was put down--but he was not to be&#xD;
changed by time or place; the same, ac-&#xD;
corplished suitor, the same unchanged&#xD;
admirer-nor did he fail to show the pre-&#xD;
ference he felt. But what will love not&#xD;
effect ! Emily Sidney was an only child,&#xD;
and with all the sweet ignorance of afflu-&#xD;
ence, she wondered what riches had to&#xD;
do with content. The old question of&#xD;
"love in a cottage, or palace without,"&#xD;
this eternal young girl's theme, was pon-&#xD;
dered upon, but all thoughts leaned to the&#xD;
same side,--the predilection she felt,&#xD;
happily or unhappily for Delacour. He&#xD;
protested disinterested  affection-total&#xD;
disregard of all future or present expec-&#xD;
tations-and could she do less than be-&#xD;
lieve him ? The father consulted, the&#xD;
mother advised-but Emily wept, and it&#xD;
ended in the refusal of the baronet. A&#xD;
week after, Delacour made his offer, and&#xD;
was accepted ; and who could fail ,to be&#xD;
flattered by the preference ? From that&#xD;
time they were all the world to one an-&#xD;
other-for ever together-he the .most&#xD;
attentive of lovers, she the happiest of&#xD;
women.&#xD;
As no man, by looking in the glass, is&#xD;
likely to form a just estimate of his own&#xD;
&#xD;
defects, or his own peculiar perfections;&#xD;
so no man discovers his true character&#xD;
by gazing, however intently, in that in-&#xD;
ward mirror of the mind-his own imag-&#xD;
ination. For as our shadows, seen in&#xD;
the sun, are most defective r.epresenta-&#xD;
tions of our own forms, so are these men-&#xD;
tal likenesses like the bright shape of&#xD;
fancy, too airy and too heavenly, and too&#xD;
perfect to be aught but ideal types of what&#xD;
we would fain believe. Delacour had&#xD;
his vanity. He had hitherto been a hap-&#xD;
py and prosperous man; he was much&#xD;
sought, and, moreover, was beloved by&#xD;
one whose opinion most men had been&#xD;
pleased to have gained. And if he de-&#xD;
ceived himself or believed too firmly in&#xD;
himself, what are not the deceptions that&#xD;
we practise on ourselves, and on others-.&#xD;
and this when we would be tine to all&#xD;
parties. It was, however, no deceit that&#xD;
he wasin love, though the manner of his&#xD;
loving might be another thing. Here his&#xD;
heart was fixed. The world might go&#xD;
round, and the seasons change, but each&#xD;
and the other could not affect him. All&#xD;
his feelings, his associations, were here&#xD;
combined, and nature must change ere&#xD;
he cold. But why descant upon, or&#xD;
question, his emotions?  Who, in a&#xD;
dream, ever dreamed that he should&#xD;
awake again in five minutes, or five&#xD;
hours, or ages, or centuries ! For us, we&#xD;
have oftentimes stood on the utmost&#xD;
height of a green and glorious hill, and&#xD;
there have seen nature's most awful&#xD;
might spread out around us. The vale,&#xD;
the sloping mead, the verdant lawn, the&#xD;
blooming garden ground, the river, the&#xD;
lake, the slender stream, all blessing and&#xD;
giving glory to, the darkness of our&#xD;
thoughts within; and when the golden&#xD;
sun broke out, we hailed the earth as&#xD;
joyous and happy. We do not know&#xD;
that the cloud was noticed, or the tempest&#xD;
heard to moan, though in the deep forest&#xD;
its voice might have been heard deploring.&#xD;
We must confess, that when the rain&#xD;
came down, we were taken unawares.&#xD;
Our thoughts were leading on hope, not&#xD;
treading after servile despair. And when&#xD;
the landscape was effaced, the brightness&#xD;
of the heavens gone away, then we could&#xD;
have wept, but the tears were demijed&#xD;

&#xD;
So Delacour had before his eyes some&#xD;
such gorgeous scene ; it was still bright,&#xD;
and without shadow, as if it never meant&#xD;
to fade.&#xD;
It was a delightful evening at the latter&#xD;
end of summer, when, mounting his&#xD;
horse, he took his usual way to the man-&#xD;
sion of the Sidneys. His easy and fash-&#xD;
ionable lounge, his fine person, set off by&#xD;
the splendor of his attire, as well as by&#xD;
the beauty of true content there depicted,i&#xD;
might alone have attracted the passengers;&#xD;
but then his steed, as if proud of his duty,&#xD;
contrived by certain coquettish knaveries&#xD;
and ambling graces, to fix the attention.&#xD;
Delacour was born to be admired, "the&#xD;
observed of all observers," and many&#xD;
were the remarks as he passed onward.&#xD;
He had been riding thus for some&#xD;
time, when he was overtaken by an ac-&#xD;
quaintance.&#xD;
" What ! Delacour, on the old road&#xD;
again, in spite of the news. Why Sidney&#xD;
is in the Gazette."&#xD;
"Impossible !" cried Delacour, "I&#xD;
would'have ventured my life against it-&#xD;
you joke."&#xD;
"Incredulous as a lover," replied the&#xD;
other, "look and be satisfied."&#xD;
The paper was handed to him, a glance&#xD;
was sufficient, and murmuring a hasty&#xD;
adieu, he set spurs to his horse, and was&#xD;
quickly lost to the view ; the cloud of&#xD;
dust that followed his flight, alone told of&#xD;
his passage; and those who now saw him,&#xD;
pale, agitated, and flying desperately for-&#xD;
ward, might have well mistaken him for&#xD;
the messenger of more than common woe.&#xD;
A dagger, indeed, could scarcely have&#xD;
caused a greater revulsion of the heart.&#xD;
He no sooner, entered the house, than&#xD;
the voice of the domestic proclaimed that&#xD;
something had happened; he met Mrs.&#xD;
Sidney on the stairs.&#xD;
"You will find Emily," said she, "in&#xD;
the drawing-room. This affair has agi-&#xD;
tated us all--you will excuse Mr. Sidney&#xD;
to-night?"&#xD;
He whispered a polite reply, and has-&#xD;
tened forward, but he was, for the first&#xD;
time, unheard. Emily was seated at the&#xD;
table, lights were in the room; she was&#xD;
gazing at something-it was his picture,&#xD;
the one he had himself given her; he&#xD;
&#xD;
drew near-the lip quivered, and tears&#xD;
were trembling in the eyelids; she sigh-&#xD;
ed and sighed again, he advanced a step&#xD;
farther, a slight cry escaped her.&#xD;
" Oh ! it is you," she exclaimed, but&#xD;
there was something tremulous in the&#xD;
voice, half joy, half anguish: "I knew&#xD;
you would come, that is, I thought you&#xD;
would."  "Ilow could I do less than&#xD;
come, when I have so often come before,"&#xD;
was the answer. "You are very good,"&#xD;
she sighed, "but my father's misfortunes,&#xD;
oh ! Delacour, you can guess my feel-&#xD;
ings."&#xD;
" Your feelings are perhaps peculiar to&#xD;
you," he returned, somewhat coldly,&#xD;
" you are very suspicious to-night."&#xD;
" I hope not," she replied meekly,,&#xD;
"but you are tired, we will have some&#xD;
refreshment, and tune the harp; you&#xD;
were always fond of that."&#xD;
The refreshments were brought, she&#xD;
helped him with her own hands ; but&#xD;
when she turned to the instrument, the&#xD;
full and surcharged eyes-the flushed&#xD;
face-the heaving of the bosom-the&#xD;
trembling speech-the look wandering to&#xD;
and fro on the face of her lover, too plain-&#xD;
ly indicated that she had perceived some-&#xD;
thing more or less than usual in theman-&#xD;
ner of his address. She seemed to De-&#xD;
lacour, as she touched the strings, to have&#xD;
the finest figure in the world, and indeed&#xD;
her soul was on the chords. She felt&#xD;
that she needed some other person to&#xD;
make all he had once been to her ; she&#xD;
was a gentle and excellent girl, and Dela-&#xD;
cour, who was an admirer of all excel-&#xD;
lence, was quickly won to her side. She&#xD;
had never played with such execution,&#xD;
and now attentive, and now wavering, he&#xD;
listened, and was now impassioned and&#xD;
now cold as ever-and now he dreamed&#xD;
himself back to all his former adoration&#xD;
of her. At length he snatched a kiss--&#xD;
said something of forgiveness, and all&#xD;
was forgotten ; but another hour was&#xD;
over-he was silent and more cold than&#xD;
death, at least, to the heart of Emily. It&#xD;
was now getting late, anid he declined, on&#xD;
plea of business, staying the night, which&#xD;
was his usual custom. She sunk .into&#xD;
silence and despondency.&#xD;
" You are sad, Miss Sidney," he said,&#xD;
&#xD;
"or angry, but my Emily used not to be' Yet why arraign the providence of Hea-&#xD;

She smiled faintly,                  our hands, we cast it aside and determine&#xD;
"I am   surely not mistaken," he re- on misery; and-when weighed down by&#xD;
turned, " not a word has been' spoken the burden of -carc, we would1 sill seek&#xD;

"Excuse me," she cried, and as she-I veted we can never hope to obtain. Vile&#xD;
was seated by his side, she placed her weakness of human nature; that we who&#xD;
hand gently upon his shoulder: "you. would, in truth, believe ourselves perfect,&#xD;
do not understand me ; there is no tern- should yet allow ourselves, wilfully and&#xD;
per in me but sorrow. I am not angry,"[ willingly; to be so base ! One would&#xD;

A11 Story of the Heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
rienced wretchedness, or sighed in the&#xD;
full emotion of regret, he was the last to&#xD;
believe that his sorrows, his vexation, his&#xD;
self-r eproaches, were of his own creation.&#xD;
But a few months had gone by, and&#xD;
another lady caught his attention, of his&#xD;
own years-handsome,. accomplished,&#xD;
and of desired wealth. He soon imagin-&#xD;
ed himself to be in love, for in false hearts&#xD;
no flame is so easily kindled as false pas-&#xD;
sion ; and the lady was in love with him,&#xD;
just such love as a calculating woman&#xD;
may bestow, who thinks more of herself&#xD;
than of the world beside. She knew,&#xD;
indeed, of no feelings out of the sphere&#xD;
of a drawing-room, or any emotion but&#xD;
such as might lie in the compass of a&#xD;
carriage. Again family, future, friends,&#xD;
and connections were canvassed, and&#xD;
were fond hitting ; again he pictured un-&#xD;
interrupted peace, unclouded days; again&#xD;
he was in possession of all his dreams;&#xD;
again hoped, was again happy; again&#xD;
constant, again, in fact, a lover.&#xD;
Time rolled on and on, and he saw no&#xD;
reason to regret his choice. He became&#xD;
restless, for others were in pursuit of the&#xD;
same prize as himself, and then he grew&#xD;
impatient and more impassioned, and, at&#xD;
length, made his offer, and was success-&#xD;
ful. He was now more gay than ever--&#xD;
more fashionable-more splendid.  In&#xD;
all public places and private parties he&#xD;
was the acknowledged suitor, and con-&#xD;
gratulated by his friends on the fortune&#xD;
he would acquire--on the conquest he&#xD;
had made; he was not backward in boast-&#xD;
ing the favor in which he found himself,&#xD;
ill exhibiting the influence he had.over&#xD;
her, and in talking of the brilliant pros-&#xD;
pects that he anticipated in the futures&#xD;
It was with this lady hanging on his&#xD;
arm, that he first again beheld Emily&#xD;
Sidney. The bloom of youth was gone,&#xD;
the form wasted, the-ringlets confined&#xD;
.beneath a -gauze cap ; the figure no lon-&#xD;
ger joyous' with content, but shackled by&#xD;
despondency and disappointment. She&#xD;
rose as she beheld him-the young Baro-&#xD;
net was at her side. -&#xD;
."I hope I have the pleasure of seeing&#xD;
you well," said Delacour, with his un-&#xD;
changing eye fixed full upon her face.&#xD;
She blushed, faltered, and murmured an&#xD;
&#xD;
assent. " I beg your pardon," he added,&#xD;
"but I hear you only indistinctly. You&#xD;
say that you are well, surely." She fix-&#xD;
ed her expressive look reproachfully upon&#xD;
him. "I am better than I have been,"&#xD;
she returned, "indeed-quite well," and&#xD;
so they parted. The words that had been&#xD;
spoken were the common compliments&#xD;
of the day: but oh! the manner said&#xD;
every thing. On that night she burnt a&#xD;
little likeness she had drawn of him from&#xD;
memory; she cast aside all embarrass-&#xD;
ment, she quitted her sick room, dressed,&#xD;
sung, laughed, danced and played as she&#xD;
was used to do; she hurried into compa-&#xD;
ny, into amusement, was as much ad-&#xD;
mired as ever, as usual sought as when&#xD;
she had a fortune: but' her parents saw&#xD;
the dark side of the picture,-the young&#xD;
girl's heart was broken.&#xD;
Can it be possible that Delacour went&#xD;
home that night in remorseless compla-&#xD;
cency?   That no compunction dwelt&#xD;
within his breast-that no conscience&#xD;
visited his thoughts.-that the faded form&#xD;
of nature's loveliness-.-the sweet confu-&#xD;
sion that pleaded,'like the tongue of mer-&#xD;
cy and of truth-that, last of all, that-&#xD;
look-had spoken nothing! It is impos-&#xD;
sible. He knew he was to blame--he&#xD;
writhed under the infliction of secret re-&#xD;
gret-he thought he had not acted quite&#xD;
honorably-quite tenderly-but for all&#xD;
that he would have started at the name,&#xD;
of villain. Yet it was for his good he&#xD;
should act as he had (lone ; she would&#xD;
marry the Baronet; his destiny, and not&#xD;
himself, was to be reproached, and, shift-&#xD;
ing from any further argument, he hasten-&#xD;
ed to conclude affairs with the lady in&#xD;
question.&#xD;
Now came the confusion of prepara-&#xD;
tion. Parties were given and received,&#xD;
and the round of reciprocal introduction&#xD;
took place, and, in the sadden rush of&#xD;
coming events, Delacour lost all recollec-&#xD;
tion of the past, and sacrificed its memo-&#xD;
ry for ever on the altar of futurity. The&#xD;
world was determined to make him pleas-&#xD;
ed, and he was resolute to be so. The&#xD;
house was taken, furniture, table-linen,&#xD;
the elegances of a lady's comforts, all&#xD;
were procured, and all in the exact taste&#xD;
that night best suit both parties. Busi-&#xD;
&#xD;
.&#xD;
..&#xD;
&#xD;
ness was no longer attended to, for Dela-&#xD;
cour was at each and every hour of the&#xD;
day prosecuting his love-suit, and the&#xD;
lady was, at all times, his attentive listen-&#xD;
er. The marriage deeds and the settle-&#xD;
ment were next talked about, for marri-&#xD;
ages, at least such marriages as these,&#xD;
generally end as they begin, in a very&#xD;
business-like manner. But now, on the&#xD;
exposure-of the absolute property, on the&#xD;
explanation of the contingent prospects&#xD;
of Mr. Delacour, he was found, by the&#xD;
father, or might it be by the lady?-he&#xD;
was found deficient, that is, not quite the&#xD;
exact bargain that was expected. They&#xD;
tell that the lady, hearing he had boasted&#xD;
of her preference, fearing too easy a con-&#xD;
quest, adopted this pretty piece of co-&#xD;
quetry, in hopes of being over-persuaded.&#xD;
Be- this as it may; at the moment of&#xD;
doubt and denial, at the moment when&#xD;
the lady hinted that her decision had been&#xD;
entirely in obedience to her parents, not&#xD;
that she had in the least changed, then it&#xD;
was that Delacour perceived he had been&#xD;
a dupe-cheated, betrayed, and made the&#xD;
very ridicule of fortune.  He rushed&#xD;
from the house, where he had passed&#xD;
two years in the pursuit of a shadow, as&#xD;
worthless as it was frail, and hastened&#xD;
homeward.&#xD;
He had pride, he was not quite with-&#xD;
out feeling, at least for himself; but when&#xD;
he recollected the heaven he had cast&#xD;
away, how he had smote upon the heart&#xD;
that loved him, to be smitten in return,&#xD;
conscience was his accuser. The affair&#xD;
of Miss Sidney was known to his ac-&#xD;
quaintances ; he himself had given pub-&#xD;
licity to this; here was the deceiver him-&#xD;
self deceived, the betrayer himself be-&#xD;
trayed-and he heard the laugh of deri-&#xD;
sion-go round about him. '&#xD;
It is hard for the brave and the good to&#xD;
part with the lasting hope-the lving&#xD;
impression-the unfading aspirations of&#xD;
their every-day existence; but how much&#xD;
more difficult for the calculating-the&#xD;
base, to separate, upon even terms, with&#xD;
their desires. This one expectation, this&#xD;
aggrandlizement, perhaps, the lady her-&#xD;
self, had been the stamina of Delacour' s&#xD;
late actions and life. To have been&#xD;
climbing, with struggles and anguish, the&#xD;

steep of fortune--.bewildered among the&#xD;
brushwood-torn and defaced. amid the&#xD;
brambles,-to find one's'foot upon the&#xD;
last elevation our wondering gaze might&#xD;
discover, and no sooner to find ourselves&#xD;
there than the foundation gives way, the&#xD;
basement is scattered, and we and all our&#xD;
tiny hopes hurled headlong into the abyss,&#xD;
or into the humble vale from which we&#xD;
first up-sprung,-this may well demand&#xD;
patience; but when inflicted on the strong,&#xD;
when suffered by the proud, then comes&#xD;
the sting of madness-the writhing of&#xD;
passion-the gnawing of the heart-and&#xD;
all that despair may suffer under, and&#xD;
philosophy deride.&#xD;
While torn by conflicting emotions,&#xD;
there seemed no resting-place whereon&#xD;
the thoughts of Delacour might repose.&#xD;
He had held himself above the world, as&#xD;
one whom no storm might reach, no&#xD;
breath might touch: he had walked in&#xD;
pride, he was therefore more open to&#xD;
scorn. He looked around him, and one&#xD;
fair form, and one alone, was seen in the&#xD;
far expanse, and to her he turned. To&#xD;
this being he voyed to resign all false&#xD;
ambitions, all theories of self-emolument,&#xD;
all speculations of self-interest. He had&#xD;
grown in riches within the last two years;&#xD;
she might still love him-he had lost&#xD;
honor in losing her-well, he must repair&#xD;
the loss-but then her reproaches and&#xD;
scorn,-he deserved them, and humbly&#xD;
and faithfully he could avow it. He4&#xD;
thought of her angel ways-her maiden&#xD;
kindness ; he thought, and wondered at&#xD;
the monster he had been. But the mind&#xD;
forms schemes, after the body is tired of&#xD;
action, incapable of impulse. A fatal&#xD;
malady, the -effect of his disturbed spir-&#xD;
its, now made its appearance. - Day after&#xD;
day passed in ineffectual attempts to ob-&#xD;
tain an interview with the being he had&#xD;
injured. The wretched young lady, on&#xD;
whom their last meeting had made a last-&#xD;
ing impression, suspicious of his ad vances,&#xD;
fearing to avow her real sentiments ; her&#xD;
delicacy offended and pride wounded, fled&#xD;
his secret approaches, or with cold insen-&#xD;
sibility met his more open attentions. It&#xD;
wvas enough for her to know that he was&#xD;
on the point of marriage with another,&#xD;
land though he was evidently an object&#xD;

knew where, and the morning had risen he, as his favorite sister drew near, "but&#xD;
before he found himself at home. it is the last, and let us pass through it&#xD;
&#xD;
bravely." It was after he had blessed&#xD;
her, and kissed her, and bade her adieu,&#xD;
that he called her back again. His noble&#xD;
face was changed to the marble of the&#xD;
grave, and those eyes shone with the last&#xD;
burning flame of nature and of life. He&#xD;
dashed away the tears that had gathered&#xD;
till they flowed, and dashed them away&#xD;
again. The impressiveness of death was&#xD;
on his tongue. "-If ever you see her,"&#xD;
he sighed; "if ever you meet, tell her&#xD;
-but no-I can say nothing.-If she&#xD;
knew all she would know too much-&#xD;
my silence is enough." With this he&#xD;
sank backward, and lay calmly ; a long&#xD;
drawn sigh was heard-and Delacour&#xD;
was dead. But the sorrow he had caused l&#xD;
neither was ended nor died with him. His&#xD;
faults had been without extenuation, his&#xD;
errors without excuse, and the world had&#xD;
not been backward- to censure him; yet&#xD;
one heart was found that could pardon,&#xD;
one soft enough to pity his frailties. All&#xD;
the mercy he could hope was there, and1&#xD;
tenderness that surpassed all he might&#xD;
imagine. The shriek that burst from&#xD;
Emily Sidney while reading the news of&#xD;
his decease, was the knell of another un-&#xD;
timely end. The woe of years was end-&#xD;
ed, the link of past emotions broken.&#xD;
He was then gone-for ever and irrevo-&#xD;
cably gone. The pride of her thoughts&#xD;
-the friend of her heart-the lover)&#xD;
of her youth. No scorn or maidenly&#xD;
reserve could now uphold her. Modesty&#xD;
might fear to reveal the last fond truth,&#xD;
but death wipes away all blushes.&#xD;
If sighs might speak of grief, or tears,&#xD;
or inward sorrowing, a broken sleep, a,&#xD;
restless and unenjoyed existence,-if; all&#xD;
these are the emblems of woe, all this had'&#xD;
been past, though in the last few years,&#xD;
and it was over. "Mourn not, my child,"&#xD;
urged the mother, "he is happy, and has&#xD;
long been a stranger to us." "I am sen-&#xD;
sible of no grief," was the answer; "yes,&#xD;
&#xD;
- w r  ., x J&#xD;
&#xD;
he has long been a stranger AtIst o&#xD;
me,-yes, yes-to me he has been a&#xD;
stranger."  This was the last time she&#xD;
ever spoke of him; but the thoughts will&#xD;
utter what the tongue never tells. Shy&#xD;
dreamed upon the scene in the garden,&#xD;
that faint and indistinct recollection of&#xD;
something most blissful and most wretch-&#xD;
ed. He had thought of her, had return-&#xD;
ed to her, it was enough, he was forgiven;&#xD;
yet why had she not spoken to him and&#xD;
soothed him, and parted in friendship, if&#xD;
not in love? The idea was fraught with&#xD;
madness, and here the fatality of all her&#xD;
misery was seen. In the mean time she&#xD;
evinced no more than common grief.&#xD;
The day of his funeral she took her&#xD;
usual walk; she saw the sad procession&#xD;
pass, speechless, tearless, and without a&#xD;
murmur. And yet after this she was&#xD;
seen in company, and, to the same eyes,&#xD;
the same as ever. Is woman's pride so&#xD;
delicate, or is it so unconquerable that it&#xD;
may feign all this ! Yes, sad- necessity,&#xD;
that the last humility of disappointed af-&#xD;
fections can only stoop thus low.&#xD;
At many public places, scenes of fash-&#xD;
ionable resort, or haunts of fashionable&#xD;
invalids, she was afterwards met. The&#xD;
baronet was in constant attendance ; the&#xD;
parents hinted their hopes. She had&#xD;
never, willingly, given sorrow to any one;&#xD;
she consented to accept him, received&#xD;
meekly his attentions, smiled at the de-&#xD;
lighted congratulations -of her friends,&#xD;
and seemed happy.-The sober twilight&#xD;
of morning just shadowed the apartment&#xD;
where she lay; it was her own accustom-&#xD;
ed attitude; her arm gently supporting&#xD;
her head, the long hair hanging luxuri-&#xD;
ouslyon the bosom and veiling the hands.&#xD;
Her mother drew near and stooped to&#xD;
kiss her. Enough; what would you&#xD;
more! That cry might have well toki&#xD;
the rest.&#xD;

BY J. M. WILSON, ESQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
You have all heard of the Cheviot    Peter was placed in very unpleasant&#xD;
mountains. If you have not, they are circumstances, owing to the situation of&#xD;
a rough, rugged, majestic chain of hills, Marchlaw house, which unfortunately&#xD;
which a poet might term the Roman wall was built immediately across the "ideal&#xD;

by Peter Elliot, the proprietor of some before the death of his grandfather, his&#xD;

lay on the Scotch side; his mother was&#xD;
collaterally related to the Stewarts; and&#xD;
few families were moi-e ancient or re-&#xD;

speech, indeed, betrayed him to be a&#xD;
walking partition between the two king-&#xD;
doms, a living representation of the Uni-&#xD;

was for many years the best runner,&#xD;
leaper and wrestler, between Wooler and&#xD;
Jelburgh. Whirled from his hand, the&#xD;
ponderous bullet whizzed through the air&#xD;
like a pigeon on the wing; and the best&#xD;
putter on the borders quailed from com-&#xD;
petition. As a feather in his grasp, he&#xD;
seized the unwieldy hammer, swept it&#xD;
round and round his head, accompanying&#xD;
with agile limb its evolutions, swiftly as&#xD;
swallows play around a circle, and hurled&#xD;
it from his hands like a shot from a rifle,&#xD;
till antagonists shrank back, and the' spec-&#xD;
tators burst into a shout. " Well done,&#xD;
Squire! the Squire forever!" once exclaim-&#xD;
ed a servile observer of titles. "Squire,&#xD;
wha are you squiring at ?" returned Peter.&#xD;
"Confound ye! where was ye when I&#xD;
was christened Squire ! My name's.&#xD;
Peter Elliot-your man, or any body's&#xD;
man, at whatever they like !"&#xD;
Peter's soul was free, bounding and&#xD;
buoyant as the wind that caroled in a&#xD;
zephyr, or shouted in-a hurricane -upon&#xD;
his native hills, and his body was thirteen&#xD;
stone of healthy, substantial flesh, steep=&#xD;
ed in the spirits of life. He had been&#xD;
long married, but marriage hadwrought&#xD;
no change upon him. They who sup-&#xD;
pose that -wedlock transforms the lark&#xD;
into an owl, offer an insult to the lovely&#xD;
beings who, brightening the darkest&#xD;
hours with the smiles of affection, teach&#xD;
us that that only is -unbecoming in the&#xD;
husband which is dlisgraceful in the man.&#xD;
Nearly twenty years had passed over&#xD;
them, butdanet was still as kind, and in&#xD;
his eyes as beautiful, as when, bestowing&#xD;
on him her hand, she blushed her vows&#xD;
&#xD;
at the altar; and he was still as happy,&#xD;
as generous, and as free. Nine fair chil-&#xD;
dren sat around their domestic hearth,&#xD;
and one, the youngling of the flock,&#xD;
smiled upon its mother's knee. Peter&#xD;
had never known sorrow ; he was blest&#xD;
in his wife, in his children, in his flocks.&#xD;
He had become richer than his father.&#xD;
He was beloved by his neighbors, the&#xD;
tillers of his ground, and his herdsmen;&#xD;
yet, no man envied his prosperity, But&#xD;
a blight passed over the harvest of his&#xD;
joys, and gall was rained into the cup&#xD;
of his felicity.&#xD;
It was a Christmas day, and a more&#xD;
melancholy-looking dun never. rose on a&#xD;
25th of December. One vast sable&#xD;
cloud, like a universal pall, overspread&#xD;
the heavens. For weeks the ground&#xD;
had been covered, with clear, dazzling&#xD;
snow ; and as, throughout the day, the&#xD;
rain continued its unwearied and mono-&#xD;
tonous drizzle, the earth assumed a char-&#xD;
acter and appearance melancholy and&#xD;
troubled as thd heavens. Like a mastiff&#xD;
that has lost its owner, the wind howled&#xD;
dolefully down the glens, and was re-&#xD;
echoed from the caves of the mountains,&#xD;
as the lamentations of a legion of invisible&#xD;
spirits. The frowning; snow-clad preci-&#xD;
pices were instinct with motion, as ava-&#xD;
lanche upon avalanche, the larger burying&#xD;
the less, crowded downward in their&#xD;
tremendous journey to the plain. The&#xD;
simple mountain rills. had assumed the&#xD;
majesty of rivers, the broader streams&#xD;
were swollen into wide torrents, and,&#xD;
gushing forth as cataracts in fury and in&#xD;
foam, enveloped the valleys in an angry&#xD;
flood. But at Marchlaw the fire blazed&#xD;
blithely; the kitchen groaned beneath&#xD;
the load of preparations for a joyful&#xD;
feast; and glad faces glided from room&#xD;
to room.&#xD;
Peter Elliotkept Christmas, not so&#xD;
much because it was Christmas, as in&#xD;
honor of its being the birth-day of Thom-&#xD;
as, his first-born, who that day entered&#xD;
his nineteenth year. With a father's&#xD;
love his heart yearned for all his chil-&#xD;
dren, but Tfhomas was the pride of his&#xD;
eyes.' Cards of apology had not then&#xD;
found their wvay- among our Border hills;&#xD;
and, as all knew that, although Peter ad-&#xD;

mitted no spirits within his threshold,&#xD;
nor a drunkard at his table, he was nev-&#xD;
ertheless, no niggard in his hospitality,&#xD;
his invitations were accepted without&#xD;
ceremony. The guests were assembled ;&#xD;
and, the kitchen being the only apart-&#xD;
ment in the building large enough to con-&#xD;
tain them, the cloth was spread upon a&#xD;
long oaken table, stretching from England&#xD;
into Scotland. On the English end of&#xD;
the board were placed a ponderous plum-&#xD;
pudding, studded with temptation, and a&#xD;
smoking sirloin'; on Scotland, a savory&#xD;
and well-seasoned haggis, with a sheep's&#xD;
head and trotters; while the intermediate&#xD;
space was filled with the good things of&#xD;
this life common to both kingdoms and&#xD;
to the seasons. .,&#xD;
The guests from the north and from the&#xD;
south were arranged promiscuously. Ev-&#xD;
ery seat was filled--save one. The chair&#xD;
by Peter's right hand remained unoccu-&#xD;
pied. He had raised his hand before his&#xD;
eyes, and besought a blessing on what&#xD;
was placed before them, rind was prepar-&#xD;
ing to carve for his visiters, when his&#xD;
eyes fell upon the vacant chair. The&#xD;
knife dropped upon the table. Anxiety&#xD;
flashed across his countenance, like an&#xD;
arrow from an unseen hand.&#xD;
" Janet, where is Thomas ?" he in-&#xD;
quired; "have none o'ye seen him ?"&#xD;
and without waiting an answer he con-&#xD;
tinued, "How is it possible he can be&#xD;
absent at a time like this ? And on such&#xD;
a day, too? Excuse me a minute, friends,&#xD;
till I just step out and see if I can find&#xD;
him. Since ever I kept this day, as&#xD;
many o' ye ken, he has always been at&#xD;
my right hand in that very chair, and I&#xD;
canna think o' beginning our dinner while&#xD;
I see it is empty."&#xD;
"If the filling of the chair be" all,"&#xD;
said a pert young sheep-farmer, named&#xD;
Johnson, "I will step.into it till Master{&#xD;
Thomas arrives." -&#xD;
" Ye are not a father, young man,"&#xD;
said Peter, and walked out of the room.&#xD;
Minute succeeded minute, but Peter&#xD;
returned not. The guests became an-&#xD;
gry, peevish and gloomy, while an ex-&#xD;
cellent dinner continued spoiling before&#xD;
them. Mrs. Elliot, whose good-nature&#xD;
was the most prominent feature in her&#xD;
&#xD;
character, strove by every possible effort&#xD;
to beguile the unpleasant impressions she&#xD;
perceived gathering upon their counte-&#xD;
nances.&#xD;
"Peter is just as bad as him," she&#xD;
remarked, "to have gone to seek him&#xD;
when he kenned the dinner wouldna&#xD;
keep. And I am sure Thomas kenned&#xD;
it would be ready at ane o'clock to the&#xD;
minute. It is sae unthinking and un-&#xD;
friendly like to keep folk waiting." And,&#xD;
endeavoring ,to smile upon a beautiful&#xD;
black-haired girl of seventeen, who sat&#xD;
by her elbow, she continued, in an anx-&#xD;
ious whisper, "Did ye see naething of&#xD;
him, Elizabeth, hinny ?"&#xD;
The maid blushed deeply; the ques-&#xD;
tion evidently gave freedom to a tear,&#xD;
which had for some time been an unwil-&#xD;
ling prisoner in the brightest eyes in the&#xD;
room; and the monosyllable "No," that&#xD;
trembled from her lips, was audible to&#xD;
the ear of the inquirer. In vain Mrs.&#xD;
Elliot despatched one of her children&#xD;
after another, in quest of the father and&#xD;
brother; they came and went, but brought&#xD;
no tidings more cheering than the moan-&#xD;
ing of the hollow wind. Minutes rolled&#xD;
into hours, yet neither came. She per-&#xD;
ceived the prouder of her guests prepar-&#xD;
ing to withdraw, and observing that,&#xD;
"Thomas's absence was so singular and&#xD;
unaccountable, and so unlike either him&#xD;
or his father, she didna ken what apology&#xD;
to make to her friends for such treat-&#xD;
ment ; but it was needless waiting, and,&#xD;
begged they would use no ceremony, but'&#xD;
just begin."&#xD;
No second invitation was necessary;&#xD;
good humor appeared to be restored; and&#xD;
sirloins, pies, pastries and moor-fowl, be-&#xD;
gan to disappear like the lost son. For&#xD;
a moment Mrs. Elliot apparently par-&#xD;
took in the restoration of cheerfulness;&#xD;
but a low sigh at her elbow again drove&#xD;
the color from her rosy cheeks. Her&#xD;
eye wandered to the farther end of the&#xD;
table, and rested on, the unoccupied seat&#xD;
of her husband, and the vacant chair of&#xD;
her first-born. Her heart fell heavily&#xD;
within her; all the mother gushed into&#xD;
her bosom; and, rising from the table,&#xD;
" What in the world can be the meaning&#xD;
o' this !" said she, as she hurried with&#xD;
&#xD;
a troubled countenance towards the door.&#xD;
Her husband met her on the threshold.&#xD;
"Where have you been, Peter ?" said&#xD;
she, eagerly; "have ye seen naething o'&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
"Naething !' naething !" replied he:&#xD;
"is he no cast up yet ?" and, with a&#xD;
- melancholy glance, his eyes sought an&#xD;
answer in the deserted chair. . His lips&#xD;
quivered, his tongue faltered.&#xD;
"Gude forgie me !" said he ; " and&#xD;
such a day for even an enemy to be out&#xD;
in ! I've been up and down every way&#xD;
that I could think on, but not a living&#xD;
creature has seen or heard tell of him.&#xD;
Ye'll excuse me, neighbors," he added,&#xD;
leaving the house; "I must away again,&#xD;
for I canna rest."&#xD;
"I ken by myself, friends," said Adam&#xD;
Bell, a decent looking Northumbrian,&#xD;
"that a father's heart is as sensitive as&#xD;
the apple o' his ee; and I think we&#xD;
would show a want o' natural sympathy&#xD;
and respect for our worthy neighbor, if&#xD;
we didna every one get his foot into the&#xD;
stirrup without loss o' time, and assist,&#xD;
him in his search. For, in my rough&#xD;
country way o' thinking, it must be some-&#xD;
thing out of the common that could tempt&#xD;
Thomas to be a missing. Indeed, I nedna&#xD;
say tempt, for there could be noinclina-&#xD;
tion in the way. And, our hills," he&#xD;
concluded in a lower tone, "are not ow'r&#xD;
chancy in other respects besides the&#xD;
breaking up o' the storm."&#xD;
" Ah !" said Mrs. Elliot, wringing&#xD;
her hands, "I have had the coming o'&#xD;
this about me for days and days. My&#xD;
head was growing dizzy with happiness,&#xD;
but thoughts came stealing upon me like&#xD;
ghosts, and I felt a lonely soughing about&#xD;
my heart, without being able to tell the&#xD;
cause-but the cause is come at last !&#xD;
And my dear Thomas-the very pride&#xD;
and staff o' my life-is lost to me for,&#xD;
ever "&#xD;
"I ken, Mrs. Elliot," replied the&#xD;
Northumbrian, " it is atn easy matter to&#xD;
say compose yourself, for them that dinna&#xD;
ken what it is to feel. But, at the same&#xD;
time, in our plain country way o' thinlk-&#xD;
ing, we are always ready to believe the&#xD;
worst. I've often heard my faither say,&#xD;
and I've as often remarked it myself,&#xD;

muckle singing in your heads to-night;&#xD;
we will have a shower before bed-time ;'&#xD;
and I never in my born days saw it to&#xD;
fail."&#xD;
At another period, Mr. Bell's disserta-&#xD;
tion on presentiments would have been&#xD;
found a fitting text on which to hang all&#xD;
the dreams, wraiths, warnings, and mar-&#xD;
vellous circumstances, that have been&#xD;
handed down to the company from the&#xD;
days of their great-grand-fathers; but,&#xD;
in the present instance they were too&#xD;
much occupied in consultation regarding&#xD;
the different routes to be taken in their&#xD;
search.&#xD;
Twelvehorsemen and some half-dozen&#xD;
pedestrians, were seen hurrying in divers&#xD;
directions from Marchlaw, as the first&#xD;
faint lights of a melancholy day were&#xD;
yielding to the heavy darkness which&#xD;
appeared pressing in solid masses down&#xD;
the sides of the mountains. The wives&#xD;
and daughters of the party were alone&#xD;
left with the disconsolate mother, who&#xD;
alternately pressed her weeping children&#xD;
to her heart, and told them to weep not,&#xD;
for their brother would soon return;&#xD;
while the tears stole down her own&#xD;
cheeks, and the infant in her arms wept&#xD;
because its mother wept. Her friends&#xD;
strove with each other to inspire hope,&#xD;
and- poured upon her ear their mingled&#xD;
and loquacious consolation. But one re-&#xD;
mained silent. The daughter of-Adam&#xD;
Bell, who sat by Mrs. Elliot's elbow at&#xD;
table, had shrunk into an obscure corner&#xD;
of the room. Before her face she held&#xD;
a handkerchief wet with tears. Her bo-&#xD;
som throbbed convulsively; and, as oc-&#xD;
casionally her broken sighs burst from&#xD;
their prison-house, a significant whisper-&#xD;
passed among tne younger part of the&#xD;
company.&#xD;

&#xD;
Mrs. Elliot approached her, and, taking.&#xD;
her hand tenderly within both of hers,&#xD;
"Oh, hinny! hinny!" said she, "your&#xD;
sighs go through my heart like a knife !&#xD;
And what can I do to comfort ye? Come,&#xD;
Elizabeth, my bonny love, let us hope for&#xD;
the best. Ye see before you a sorrow-&#xD;
ing mother, that fondly hoped to have-&#xD;
seen you and-I canna say.it !--and I am&#xD;
ill qualified to give comfort, when my&#xD;
own heart is like a furnace ! .But Oh !&#xD;
let us try and remember the blessed por-&#xD;
tion; 'Whom the Lord loveth he chas-&#xD;
teneth,' and inwardly pray for strength to&#xD;
say 'His will be done!'"&#xD;
Time stole on towards midnight, and&#xD;
one by one of the unsuccessful party re-&#xD;
turned. . As foot after foot approached,&#xD;
every breath was held to listen.--"No,&#xD;
no, no !" cried the mother again and&#xD;
again, with increasing anguish, "It is&#xD;
not the foot o' my own bairn;"-while&#xD;
her keen gaze still remained riveted upon;&#xD;
the door, and was not withdrawn, nor the&#xD;
hope of despair relinquished till the indi-&#xD;
vidual entered, with a silent and ominous&#xD;
shake of the head, betokening his fruit-&#xD;
less efforts. The clock had struck twelve ;&#xD;
all were returned save the father. The&#xD;
wind howled more wildly ; the rain pour-&#xD;
ed upon the windows in ceaseless tor-&#xD;
rents ; and the roaring of the mountain&#xD;
rivers gave a character of deeper ghostli-&#xD;
ness to their sepulchral silence. For they&#xD;
sat, each wrapt in. forebodings, listening&#xD;
to the storm; and no sounds were heard,&#xD;
save the groans of the mother, the weep-&#xD;
ing 'of her children, and the' bitter and&#xD;
broken sobs of the bereaved maiden, who&#xD;
leaned her head upon her father's bosom,&#xD;
refusing to be comforted.&#xD;
At length the barking of the farm-dog&#xD;
announced footsteps at a distance. Ev-&#xD;
ery ear was raised to listen, every eye&#xD;
turned to the-door; but before the tread&#xD;
was yet audible to the listeners, "Oh,-it&#xD;
is only Peter's foot !" said the miserable&#xD;
mother, and, weeping, rose to meet him.&#xD;
" Janet ! Janet !" he exclaimed as he&#xD;
entered, and threw his arms around her&#xD;
neck, " what is this come upon us at&#xD;
last ?"l&#xD;
He cast an inquisitive glance around&#xD;
his d welling, and a convulsive shiver pass- g&#xD;
21&#xD;
&#xD;
ed over his manly frame, as his eye again&#xD;
fell on the vacant chair, which no one had&#xD;
ventured to occupy. Hour succeeded&#xD;
hour, but the company separated not;&#xD;
and low, sorrowful whispers mingled&#xD;
with the lamentations'of the parents.&#xD;
"Neighbors," said Adam Bell, "the&#xD;
morn is, a new d'ay, and we will wait- to&#xD;
see what it will bring forth, but in the&#xD;
mean time, let us read a portion o' the&#xD;
Divine Word, and kneel together in pray-&#xD;
er, that whether or not the day-dawn&#xD;
cause light to shine upon this singular&#xD;
bereavement, the Sun of Righteousness&#xD;
may arise with healings on his wings,&#xD;
upon the hearts o' this afflicted family,&#xD;
and upon the hearts of all present."&#xD;
"Amen !" responded Peter, wringing&#xD;
his hands; and his friend taking down&#xD;
the " Ha' Bible," read the chapter where-&#xD;
in it is written "It is better to be in the&#xD;
house of mourning than in the house of&#xD;
feasting ;" and again-"-- It is well for me&#xD;
that I have been afflicted, for before I was&#xD;
afflicted I went astray."&#xD;
The morning came, but brought no&#xD;
tidings of the lost son. After a solemn&#xD;
farewell, all the visitants, save Adam Bell&#xD;
and his daughter, returned every one to&#xD;
their own house-; and the disconsolate&#xD;
father, with his servants, again renewed&#xD;
their search among the hills and surround-&#xD;
ing villages.&#xD;
Days, weeks, months, and years, roll-&#xD;
ed on. Time had subdued the anguish&#xD;
of the parents into a holy calm; but their&#xD;
lost first-born was not forgotten, although&#xD;
no/ trace of his fate had been discovered.&#xD;
The general belief was, that he had per-&#xD;
ished in the breaking up of the snow ;&#xD;
and the few in whose remembrance he&#xD;
still lived merely spoke of his death as a&#xD;
" very extraordinary circumstance," re-&#xD;
marking that "he was a wild, venture-&#xD;
some sort o' lad."&#xD;
Christmas had succeeded Christmas,&#xD;
and Peter Elliot still kept it in commem.-&#xD;
oration of the birth day of him who was&#xD;
not. For the first few years after the loss&#xD;
of their son, silence characterized the&#xD;
party who sat down to dinner at March-.&#xD;
aw, and still at Peter's right hand was&#xD;
placed the vacant chair. But as the youn.-&#xD;

&#xD;
years, the remembrance of their brother&#xD;
became less poignant. Christmas was&#xD;
with all around them a day of rejoicing,&#xD;
and they began to make merry with their&#xD;
friends; while. their parents partook of&#xD;
their enjoyment with a smile, half of ap-&#xD;
proval, and half of sorrow.&#xD;
Twelve years had passed away; Christ-&#xD;
mas had again come; it was the counter-&#xD;
part of its fatal predecessor. The hills&#xD;
had not yet cast off their summer ver-&#xD;
dure; the sun, although shorn of its&#xD;
heat, had lost none of its brightness or&#xD;
glory, and looked down upon the earth as&#xD;
though participating in its gladness; and&#xD;
the clear blue sky was tranquil as the sea&#xD;
sleeping beneath the moon. Many vis-&#xD;
iters had again assembled at Marchlaw.&#xD;
The sons of Mr. Elliot and the young&#xD;
men of the party were assembled upon a&#xD;
level green near the house, amusing them-&#xD;
selves with throwing the hammer and&#xD;
other Border games, while himself and&#xD;
the elder guests stood by as spectators,&#xD;
recounting the deeds of their youth.&#xD;
Johnson, the sheep-farmer, whom we&#xD;
have already mentioned, now a brawny&#xD;
and gigantic fellow of two and thirty,&#xD;
bore away in every ganie the palm from&#xD;
all competitors. More than once, as Pe-&#xD;
ter beheld-his sons defeated, he felt the&#xD;
spirit of youth glowing in his veins ; and&#xD;
"Oh !" muttered he, in bitterness, " had&#xD;
my Thomas been spared to me, he would&#xD;
have thrown his heart's blood after the&#xD;
hammer, before he would have been beat&#xD;
by ever a Johnson in the country !"&#xD;
While he thus soliloquized, and with&#xD;
difficulty restrained an impulse to com-&#xD;
pete with the victor himself, a dark, for-&#xD;
eign-looking, strong-built seaman uncere-&#xD;
moniously approached, and, with his arms&#xD;
folded, cast a look of contempt upon the&#xD;
boasting conqueror. Every eye was&#xD;
turned with a scrutinizing glance upon&#xD;
the stranger. In height he could not&#xD;
exceed five feet nine, but his whole frame&#xD;
was the model of muscular strength; his&#xD;
features were open and manly, but deep-&#xD;
ly sunburnt and weather-beaten; his&#xD;
long, glossy, black hair, curled into ring-&#xD;
lets by the breeze and the billow, fell&#xD;
thickly over his temple and forehead ;&#xD;
and wvhiskers of a similar hue, more con-&#xD;
&#xD;
80&#xD;
&#xD;
8I&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
spicuous for size than elegance, gave a&#xD;
character of fierceness to a countenance&#xD;
otherwise possessing a striking impress&#xD;
of manly beauty. Without asking per-&#xD;
mission, he stepped forward, lifted a&#xD;
hammer, and swinging it around his&#xD;
head, hurled it upwards of - five yards&#xD;
beyond Johnson's most successful throw.&#xD;
" Well done !" shouted the astonished&#xD;
spectators. The heart of Peter Elliot&#xD;
warmed within him, and he was hurry-&#xD;
ing forward to grasp the stranger by the&#xD;
hand, when the words groaned in his&#xD;
throat, "It was just such a throw as my&#xD;
Thomas would have made !--my own&#xD;
lost Thomas !" The tear burst into his&#xD;
eyes, and without speaking, he turned&#xD;
back, and hurried towards the house to&#xD;
conceal his emotion.&#xD;
Successively at every game the stranger&#xD;
had defeated all who ventured to oppose&#xD;
him; when a messenger announced that&#xD;
dinner waited their arrival.-Some of the&#xD;
guests were already seated, others enter-&#xD;
ing ; and, as heretofore, placed beside&#xD;
Mrs. Elliot was Elizabeth Bell, still in&#xD;
the noontide of her beauty ; but sorrow&#xD;
had passed over her features like a veil&#xD;
before the countenance 'of an. angel.&#xD;
Johnson, crest-fallen and out of humor&#xD;
at the defeat, seated himself by her side.&#xD;
In early life, he had regarded Thomas&#xD;
Elliot as a rival for her affections ; and&#xD;
stimulated by the knowledge that Adam&#xD;
Bell would be able to bestow several&#xD;
thousands upon his daughter for a dowry,&#xD;
he yet prosecuted his attentions with un-&#xD;
abated assiduity, in despite of the daugh-&#xD;
ter's aversion and the coldness of her&#xD;
father. Peter had taken his place at the&#xD;
table; and still by his side, unoccupied&#xD;
and sacred, appeared the vacant chair,&#xD;
the chair of his first-born, where none&#xD;
had sat since his mysterious death or&#xD;
disappearance.&#xD;
"Bairns," said h~e, "did none o' ye&#xD;
ask the sailor to come up and take-a bit&#xD;
o' dinner with us ?&#xD;
" We were afraid it might lead to a&#xD;
quarrel with Mr. Johnson," whispered&#xD;
one of the sons.&#xD;
" He is come without asking," replied&#xD;
the stranger, entering; "and the wind&#xD;
shall blow from a new point if I destroy&#xD;

" Not dead !" said Peter, grasping the&#xD;

eagerness that almost choked his utter-"&#xD;
ance ; "Oh, sir! sir! tell me, how ?&#xD;
how ?-Did ye say living ?-Is my ain&#xD;

" Not dead, do ye say ?" cried Mrs.,&#xD;

"Nono !" said Elizabeth, rising from&#xD;
her seat, "He does.not deceive us; there&#xD;
is that in his countenance which bespeaks&#xD;
a falsehood impossible:" and she also en-&#xD;
deavored to move towards him, when&#xD;
Johnson threw his arm around her to&#xD;
withhold her.&#xD;
'' Hands off, you land-lubber !" ex-&#xD;
claimed the seaman, springing towards&#xD;
them, "or, shiver me ! I'll show day-&#xD;

lovely girl in his arms, " Betty! Betty,&#xD;

you know me?   Have you really forgot-&#xD;
ten your own son? If twelve years have&#xD;
made some change in. his face, his heart&#xD;

His father, his mother, and his bro-&#xD;
thers, clung around him, weeping, smil-&#xD;
ing, and mingling a hundred questions&#xD;
together. He threw. his arms around&#xD;
the neck of each, and in answer to their&#xD;
inquiries, replied, "Well! well! there&#xD;
is time enough to answer questions, but&#xD;
not to-day, not to-day."&#xD;
" No, my bairn !-my bairn !" said&#xD;
his mother, " we'll ask no questions-&#xD;

" It is a long story, mother," said he,&#xD;
"and would take a week to tell it. But,&#xD;
however, to make a long story short, you&#xD;
remember when the smugglers were pur-&#xD;
sued and wished to conceal their brandy&#xD;
in our house, my father prevented them;&#xD;
they left muttering revenge, and they have;&#xD;
been revenged. This day twelve years,)&#xD;
I went out with the intention of meeting!&#xD;
Elizabeth and her father, when I camel&#xD;
upon a party of the gang concealed mi&#xD;
the King's Cave. In a moment half a;&#xD;
dozen pistols were held to my breast,{&#xD;
and~ tying mly hands to my sides, they1 1&#xD;
dragged mie into the cavern. Here I had&#xD;
not been long their prisoner, when the,&#xD;
snow rolling down the mountains, almost,&#xD;
totally blocked up its mouth. On the1&#xD;
second night they cut through the snow,&#xD;
and, hurrying me along with them, I was&#xD;
bound to a horse between two, and be-&#xD;
fore daylight found myself stowed, like&#xD;
a piece of old junk, in the hold of a smug-&#xD;
gling lugger. Within a week I was ship-&#xD;
ped on board a Dutch man-of-war; and,&#xD;
for six. years kept dodging about on dif-1&#xD;
ferent stations, till our old yawning hulk;&#xD;
received orders to join the fleet which&#xD;
was to fight the gallant Duncan at Cam-1&#xD;
perdown. -To think of fighting against1&#xD;
my own countrymen, my own flesh and&#xD;
blood, was worse than to be cut to pieces;&#xD;
by a cat-o'-nine-tails; and, under cover.&#xD;
of the smoke of the first broadside, I,&#xD;
sprang upon the gunwale, plunged into&#xD;
the sea, and swam for the English fleet.&#xD;
Never, never shall I forget the moment&#xD;
that my feet first trod.upon the deck of a1&#xD;
British frigate ! My nerves felt firm as1&#xD;
her oak, and my heart free as the pennant.&#xD;
that waved defiance from her mast head.&#xD;
I was as active as any one during the{&#xD;
battle; and, when it was over, and I found]&#xD;

I fancied-nay, hang it! I almost believ-&#xD;
ed Is should meet my father, my mother,&#xD;
or my dear Bess, on board of the British&#xD;
frigate. I expected to see you all again&#xD;
in a few weeks at farthest-but, instead&#xD;
of returning to old England, before I was&#xD;
aware, I found it was helm about with&#xD;
us.&#xD;
MAs to writing, I never had an opportu-&#xD;
nity. but once. We were anchored be-&#xD;
fore a French fort ; a packet was lying&#xD;
along side ready to sail; I had half a side&#xD;
written, and was scratching my head to&#xD;
think how I should come over writing&#xD;
about you, Bess, my love, when, as bad&#xD;
luck would have it, our lieutenant comes&#xD;
to me, and says he, 'Elliot,' says he, 'I&#xD;
know you like a little smart service;&#xD;
come, my lad, take the head oar, while&#xD;
we board some of these French bum-&#xD;
boats under the batteries.' I could'nt&#xD;
say no. We pulled ashore, made a bon-&#xD;
fire of one of their craft, and were setting&#xD;
fire to a second, when a deadly shower&#xD;
of small shot from the garrison scuttled&#xD;
our boat, killed our commanding officer&#xD;
with half the crew, and the few who&#xD;
were left of us were made prisoners. It&#xD;
is no use bothering you by telling how&#xD;
we escaped from the French prison. We&#xD;
did escape; and Tom will once more fill&#xD;
his vacant chair."&#xD;
Should any of our readers wish far-&#xD;
ther acquaintance with our friends, all&#xD;
we can say is, the new year was still&#xD;
young when Adam Bell bestowed his&#xD;
daughter's hand upon the heir of March-&#xD;
law, and Peter beheld the once vacant&#xD;
chair again occupied, and a namesake of&#xD;
the third generation prattling on his knee,&#xD;

their hands, with which they gathered up&#xD;
and flung out the snow by gowpens, and&#xD;
ere this had been long continued, they&#xD;
succeeded in extricating the very girl, ex-&#xD;
actly eight days from the time she had&#xD;
been buried. You may guess it was a&#xD;
moment of agonizing perturbation which&#xD;
succeeded the discovery that- she was&#xD;
alive !&#xD;
On coming to the tree and. not finding&#xD;
her lover there, she drew her plaid tight&#xD;
around her, and sat down to wait. She&#xD;
conjectured that the cold had madesher&#xD;
drowsy, and the snow falling thick upon&#xD;
her, when she awoke she was unable to&#xD;
move, and felt\herself as if alive in her&#xD;
grave, and cut off from the living world.&#xD;
Her lover was full of sorrow and expla-&#xD;
nations. "If he had but thought she&#xD;
could have ventured out on such a night,&#xD;
he never would have failed to keep his&#xD;
word," &amp;amp;c. Every young man's mind&#xD;
will suggest the proper thing to be said&#xD;
on the occasion; but Lizzy, who could&#xD;
scarcely be suspected of bestowing any&#xD;
but cold looks at such a time, took no&#xD;
notice of him whatever. The country&#xD;
people who accompanied him had a sup-&#xD;
ply of cordials, and he was loud and ear-&#xD;
nest in enjoining them to "give her some-&#xD;
thing warm instantly ;" and a glass of&#xD;
spirits was offered, which she gravely&#xD;
pushed aside. "Give me a glass of wa-_&#xD;
ter," said she; "its a cauld heart that&#xD;
canna warm a drink to itsel'."&#xD;
Her Joe was ardent in his addresses,&#xD;
but she repulsed him with endless scorn.&#xD;
Whether she ever took a husband or not,&#xD;
I have - forgotten, but it is certain she&#xD;
never married him.&#xD;

THE QUEEN OF THE MEADOW.&#xD;
BY MISS MITFORD.&#xD;
&#xD;
IN a winding unfrequented road, on&#xD;
the south side of our village, close to a&#xD;
low, two-arched bridge, thrown across a&#xD;
stream of more beauty than consequence,&#xD;
stood the small irregular dwelling, and&#xD;
the picturesque buildings of Hatherford&#xD;
Mill. It was a pretty scene on a sum-&#xD;
mer afternoon, was that old mill, with its&#xD;
strong lights and shadows, its low-brow-&#xD;
ed cottage covered with the clustering&#xD;
Pyracantha, and the clear brook which,&#xD;
after dashing, and foaming, and brawling,&#xD;
and playing off all the airs of a mountain&#xD;
river, while pent up in the mill-stream,&#xD;
was no sooner let loose, than it subsided&#xD;
into its natural peaceful character, and&#xD;
crept quietly along the valley, meander-&#xD;
ing through the green woody meadows,&#xD;
as tranquil a trout stream, as ever Izaak&#xD;
Walton angled in.&#xD;
Many a traveller has stayed his step&#xD;
to admire the old buildings of Hatherford&#xD;
Mill, backed by its dark orchard, especi-&#xD;
ally when its accompanying figures, the&#xD;
jolly miller sitting before the door, pipe&#xD;
in mouth, and jug in hand, like one of&#xD;
Teniers' boors, the mealy miller's man&#xD;
with his white sack over his, shoulders,&#xD;
carefully descending the out-of-door steps,&#xD;
and the miller's daughter, flitting about&#xD;
amongst her poultry, gave life and motion&#xD;
to the picture.1&#xD;
The scenery at the other end of the&#xD;
road was equally attractive, in a different&#xD;
style. Its principal feature was the great&#xD;
farm of the parish, an old manorial house,&#xD;
solid and venerable, with a magnificent&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
clump of witch elms in front of the porch,&#xD;
a suburb of out-buildings behind, and an&#xD;
old-fashioned garden with its rows of es-&#xD;
paliers, its wide flower-borders, and its&#xD;
close filberd-walk, stretching like a cape&#xD;

ping into the .very stream: so that the&#xD;
cows, which in sultry weather, came&#xD;
down' by twos, and by threes, from the&#xD;
opposite meadows, to cool themselves in&#xD;
the water, could almost crop the leaves&#xD;
as they stood.&#xD;
In my mind, that was the pleasanter&#xD;
scene of the two; but such could hardly&#xD;
have been the general opinion, since nine&#xD;
out of ten passers by, never vouchsafed&#xD;
a glance at the great farm, but kept their&#xD;
eyes steadily fixed on the mill; perhaps&#xD;
to look at the old buildings, perhaps at&#xD;
the miller's young daughter.&#xD;
Katy Dawson was accounted by com-&#xD;
mon consent the prettiest girl in the par-&#xD;
ish. Female critics in beauty would be&#xD;
sure to limit the commendation by assert-&#xD;
ing that her features were irregular, that&#xD;
she had not a good feature in her face,&#xD;
and so forth; but these remarks were al-&#xD;
ways made in her absence, and no sooner&#xD;
did she appear than even her critics felt&#xD;
the power of her exceeding loveliness.&#xD;
It was the IHebe look of youth and health,&#xD;
the sweet and joyous expression, and&#xD;
above all, the unrivalled brilliancy of co-&#xD;
loring, that made Katy's face, with all its&#xD;
faults, so pleasant to look upon. A con-&#xD;
plexion of the purest white, a coral lip,&#xD;
and a cheek like the pear, her namesake,&#xD;

THE TRUSTING TREE.&#xD;
FROM&#xD;
REAL LIFE, OR THE PORTFOLIO OF A CHRONICLER."&#xD;
&#xD;
JOURNEYING one day along a muirland&#xD;
road not far from Stirling, we passed a&#xD;
very. fine old tree in a field at a short&#xD;
distance. I remarked its beauty, to which&#xD;
Simon assented, but seemed a while ab-&#xD;
sorbed in recalling recollections associ-&#xD;
ated with it. At last he said, pausing and&#xD;
looking hack on the tree: "That sturdy&#xD;
old plant of other years, reminds me of&#xD;
an incident which displayed a striking&#xD;
trait of character of the true old Scottish&#xD;
breed. That is, or was, called the Tryst-&#xD;
ing Tree, and there a country lass-had&#xD;
consented to meet her sweetheart one&#xD;
winter night, to. arrange matters for the&#xD;
wedding. The night came, cold and fog-&#xD;
gy, and the girl, true to her appointment,&#xD;
set off silently in the hopes of being&#xD;
back again before she was missed. It&#xD;
soon came on a heavy snow, and snowed&#xD;
all night. The girl was not to be found;&#xD;
and all the roads round being not only&#xD;
impassable, but invisible from the depth&#xD;
of the drift, a whole week passed before&#xD;
communication was possible with the&#xD;
neighboring farms, all which time noth-&#xD;
ing could be heard of her. At length&#xD;
the news reached-her lover, who was lost&#xD;
and bewildered with the feelings of won-&#xD;
der, fear, and jealousy.-On inquiry as to&#xD;
the time when his betrothed had been last&#xD;
seen, he found it was the 'night of their&#xD;
assignation, and the first of the snow.&#xD;
The Trysting Tree flashed upon his&#xD;
mind, and hither, with a sturdy band of&#xD;
pioneers, he bent his course. On reach-&#xD;
ing the tree they commenced digging all&#xD;
round it, and soon came to a solid ham-&#xD;
mock,---Their spades and shovels 'were&#xD;
then exchanged for the simple labor of&#xD;

a genuine fear of the quickness and talb&#xD;
ent which broke out not merely in his&#xD;
conversation, but in every line of his,&#xD;
acute and lively countenance. There&#xD;
was occasionally, a sudden laughing light&#xD;
in his hazel eye, and a very arch and&#xD;
momentary smile, now seen, and now&#xD;

thought them, she had a particular aver-&#xD;

THE WINE MERCHANT'S STORY.&#xD;
BY THE AUTHOR OF&#xD;
"THE KING'S OWN."&#xD;
[The following amusing story is one of the series in imitation of the Arabian Nights. A Pacha&#xD;
is supposed to depireaa similar amusement, and to hear original tales, to whichaend he sallies forth&#xD;
in company with hisvizier. When they meet with person likely to tell a good story, lie.i&#xD;
ordered to the palace. OWe of thee, thus relates the particulars of his eventful life]&#xD;
&#xD;
I AM a Greek by birth ; my parents&#xD;
were poor people residing at Smyrna. I&#xD;
was an only son, and brought up to my&#xD;
father's profession, that of a cooper.&#xD;
When I was twenty years old, I had bu-&#xD;
ried both of my parents, and was left to&#xD;
shift for myself. I had been for some time&#xD;
in the employ of a Jewish wine mer-&#xD;
chant ; and I continued there for three&#xD;
years after my father's death, when a&#xD;
circumstance occurred which led to my&#xD;
subsequent prosperity and my present&#xD;
degradation.&#xD;
At the time I am speaking of, I had by-&#xD;
a strict diligence and sobriety, so pleased&#xD;
my employer, that I had risen to be his&#xD;
foreman ; and although I still. superin-&#xD;
tended, and occasionally worked at the&#xD;
cooperage, I was entrusted with the draw-&#xD;
ing off and fining of the wines, to pre-&#xD;
pare them for the market. There was&#xD;
an Ethiopian slave, who worked under&#xD;
my orders, a powerful, broad shouldered,&#xD;
-and most malignant wretch, whom my&#xD;
master found it almost impossible to&#xD;
manage ; the bastinado, or any other pun-&#xD;
ishment, he derided, and after the appli-&#xD;
cation only became more sullen and dis-&#xD;
contented than before.  The fire that&#xD;
flashed from his eyes, upon any faults be-I&#xD;
&#xD;
ing found by me on account of his negli-&#xD;
gence, was so threatening, that I every&#xD;
day expected I should be murdered. I&#xD;
repeatedly requested my master to part&#xD;
with him; but the Ethiopian being a&#xD;
very powerful man, and able when he&#xD;
chose, to move a pipe of wine without&#xD;
assistance, the avarice of the Jew would&#xD;
not permit him to accede to my repeated&#xD;
solicitations.&#xD;
One morning I entered the cooperage,&#xD;
and found the Ethiopian fast asleep by&#xD;
the side of a cask which I had been&#xD;
wanting for some time, and expected to&#xD;
have been ready. Afraid to punish him&#xD;
myself, I brought my master to witness&#xD;
his conduct. The Jew, enraged at his&#xD;
idleness, struck him on the head withone&#xD;
of the- staves. The Ethiopian sprung&#xD;
up in a rage, but on seeing his master&#xD;
with the stave- in his hand, contented&#xD;
himself with muttering, "That he would&#xD;
not remain to be beaten in that manner,"&#xD;
--and re-applied himself to his labor. As&#xD;
soon as my master had left the cooper-&#xD;
age the Ethiopian vented his anger upon&#xD;
me for having informed against him, and&#xD;
seizing the stave, flew at me with the in-&#xD;
tention of beating out my brains. I&#xD;
stepped behind the cask; he followed&#xD;

me, and just as I had seized an adze to&#xD;
defend myself, he fell over the stool which&#xD;
lay) in his way-he was springing up to&#xD;
renew the attack, when 1 struck -him a&#xD;
blow with the adze which entered his&#xD;
skull, and-laid him dead at my feet.&#xD;
I was very much alarmed at what had&#xD;
occurred; for although I felt myself jus-&#xD;
tified in self-defence, I was aware that&#xD;
my master would be very much annoyed&#xD;
at the loss of the slave, and as there was&#xD;
no witnesses, it would go hard with me&#xD;
when brought before the cadi.  After&#xD;
some reflection I determined, as the slave&#xD;
had said "He would not remain to be&#xD;
beaten," that I would leave my master to&#xD;
suppose he had run away, and in the&#xD;
mean time conceal the body. But to ef-&#xD;
fect this was difficult, as I could not take it&#xD;
out of the cooperage without being per-&#xD;
ceived. After some cogitation, I decided&#xD;
upon putting it into the cask, and head-&#xD;
ing it up. It required all my strength to&#xD;
lift the body in, but at last I succeeded.&#xD;
Having put in the head of the pipe, I&#xD;
hammered down the hoops and rolled it&#xD;
into the store, where I had been waiting&#xD;
to fill it with wine for the next year's de-&#xD;
mand. As soon as it was in its place, I&#xD;
pumped off the wine from the vat, and&#xD;
having filled up the cask and put in the&#xD;
bung, I felt as if a heavy load had been&#xD;
removed from my mind, as there was no&#xD;
chance of immediate discovery.&#xD;
I had but just.cdmpleted my task, and&#xD;
was sitting down on one of the settles,&#xD;
when my master came in, and inquired&#xD;
for the slave. I replied that he had left the&#xD;
cooperage, swearing that he would work&#xD;
go more. Afraid of losing him, the Jew&#xD;
hastened to give notice to the authorities,&#xD;
that he might be apprehended ; but after&#xD;
some time, as nothing could be heard of&#xD;
the supposed run-a-way, it was imagined&#xD;
that he had drowned himself in a fit of sul-&#xD;
lenness, and no more was thought about&#xD;
him. In the mean while I continued to&#xD;
work there ,as before, and as I had the&#xD;
charge of everything, I had no doubt but&#xD;
that, some day or another, I should find&#xD;
means of quietly disposing of my incum-&#xD;
brance.            '.&#xD;
The next spring, I was busy pump-&#xD;
ing off from one cask into the other, ac-&#xD;

cording to our custom, when the aga of&#xD;
the janissaries:came in. He was a great-&#xD;
wine-bibber, and one of our best custom-&#xD;
ers. As his dependents were all well&#xD;
known, it was not his custom to send&#xD;
them for wine, but to come himself to&#xD;
the store and select a pipe. This was&#xD;
carried away in a litter by eight strong&#xD;
slaves, with the curtains.drawn close, as&#xD;
if it had been a new purchase which he&#xD;
had added to his harem. My master&#xD;
showed him the pipes of wine prepared'&#xD;
for that year's market,'which were ar-&#xD;
ranged in two rows ; and I hardly need&#xD;
observe that the one containing the Ethi-&#xD;
opian was not in the foremost. After&#xD;
tasting one or two which did not seem&#xD;
to please him, the aga observed, " Friend&#xD;
Issachar, thy tribe will always put off&#xD;
the worst goods first, if possible. Now&#xD;
I have an idea that there is better wine&#xD;
in the second tier, than in the one thou&#xD;
hadt recommended. Let thy Greek put a&#xD;
spile into that cask," continued he, point-&#xD;
ing to the very one in which I had headed&#xD;
up the black slave. As I made sure that as&#xD;
soon as he had tasted the contents he would&#xD;
spit them outs I did not hesitate to bore&#xD;
the cask and draw off the wine which I&#xD;
handed to him. He tasted it and held it-&#xD;
to the light-tasted it -again and smacked&#xD;
his lips-then turning to my master, ex-&#xD;
claimed "Thou dog of a Jew ! wouldst&#xD;
thou have palmed off upon me vile trash,&#xD;
when thou hadst in thy possession wine&#xD;
which might be sipped with the Houris&#xD;
in Paradise ?"&#xD;
The Jew appealed to me if the pipes&#xD;
of wine were not all of the same quality;&#xD;
and I confirmed his assertion.&#xD;
" Taste it then," replied the aga," and&#xD;
then taste the first which you recoi-&#xD;
mended me."&#xD;
My master did so, and was evidently&#xD;
astonished. " It certainly has more&#xD;
body," replied he; "yet how that can&#xD;
he, I know not. Taste it, Charis."-I&#xD;
held the glass to my lips, but -nothing&#xD;
could induce me to taste the contents. I&#xD;
contented myself with agreeing with my&#xD;
in aster, (as I most conscientiously could,)&#xD;
"that it certainly had more body. in it&#xD;
than the rest."&#xD;
The aga was so pleased with the wine,&#xD;
&#xD;
that he tasted two or three more pip(&#xD;
of the back tier, hoping to find others o&#xD;
the same quality, probably intending&#xD;
have laid in a large stock ; but finding r&#xD;
other of the same flavor, he ordered h&#xD;
slaves to roll the one containing the bod&#xD;
of the slave into the litter, and carried&#xD;
to his own house.&#xD;
"Stop a moment,,thou lying Kafir&#xD;
said the Pacha,."dost thou really mean t&#xD;
say that the wine was better than the rest?&#xD;
"Why)should I tell a lie to your sul&#xD;
lie Highness-am I not a worm th&#xD;
you may crush ? As I informed you,&#xD;
.did not taste it, your Highness ;" but a&#xD;
ter the aga had departed, my master ex&#xD;
pressed his surprise at the excellence o&#xD;
the wine, which he affirmed to be supe&#xD;
nrior to anything that he had ever taste&#xD;
--and his sorrow that the aga had' take&#xD;
away' the cask, which prevented hir&#xD;
from ascertaining the cause. But on&#xD;
day I was narrating the circumstance t&#xD;
a Frank in this country, who expresse&#xD;
no surprise at the wine being improved&#xD;
He had been a wine merchant in Eng&#xD;
land, and he informed me that it was th&#xD;
custom there to throw large pieces of&#xD;
raw beef into the wine to feed it; an&#xD;
that some particular wines were ver&#xD;
much improved thereby.&#xD;
",Allah Kebir ! God is great !" crie&#xD;
the Pacha,--then it must be so--I hav&#xD;
heard that the English are very fond of&#xD;
beef. Now go on with thy story."&#xD;
Your Highness cannot imagine th(&#xD;
alarm which I felt when the cask wac&#xD;
taken away by the aga's slaves. I gave&#xD;
myself up for a lost man, and resolve(&#xD;
upon immediate flight from Smyrna. I]&#xD;
calculated the time that it would take for&#xD;
the aga to drink the wine, and made my&#xD;
arrangements accordingly. I told my&#xD;
master that it was my intention to leave&#xD;
him, as I had an offerto go into business&#xD;
with a relation at Zante. My master,&#xD;
who could not well do without me, en-&#xD;
treated me to stay ; but I was positive.&#xD;
lie then offered me a share of the busi-&#xD;
ness if I would remain, but I was not to&#xD;
be persuaded. Every rap at the door, I&#xD;
thought that the aga and his jamissaries&#xD;
were coming for me ; and I hastened my&#xD;
-departure, which was fixed for the fol-&#xD;
&#xD;
es lowing day,-when in the evening my&#xD;
)f master came into the store with a paper&#xD;
to in his hand.&#xD;
o   "Charis," said he," perhaps you have&#xD;
is supposed that I only offered to make you&#xD;
y a partner in my business to induce you&#xD;
it to remain, and then to deceive you. To&#xD;
prove the contrary, here is a deed drawn&#xD;
up by which you dare a partner, and- enti-&#xD;
to tied to one third of the future profits.&#xD;
" Look at it, you will find that it has been&#xD;
b- executed in due form before the cadi."&#xD;
at He had put the paper into my hand,&#xD;
I and I was about to return it with a refu-&#xD;
f- sal, when a loud knoek at the door start-&#xD;
c- led both. It was a party of janissaries&#xD;
f despatched by the aga, to bring us to&#xD;
- him immediately. I-knew well enough&#xD;
d what it must be about, and I cursed my&#xD;
n folly for having delayed so long; but the&#xD;
n fact was, the wine proved so agreeable to&#xD;
e the aga's palate, that he had -drank it&#xD;
o much faster than usual; besides which,&#xD;
d the body of the slave took up at least a&#xD;
1. third of the cask, and diminished the&#xD;
- contents in the same proportion. There&#xD;
e was no appeal, and no escape. My mas-&#xD;
f ter, who was ignorant of the cause, did&#xD;
d not seem at all alarmed, but willingly ac-&#xD;
y companied the soldiers. I, on the con-&#xD;
trary, was nearly dead from- fear.&#xD;
I   When we arrived, the aga burst out in&#xD;
e' the most violent exclamations against my&#xD;
master-" Thou rascal of a Jew !" said&#xD;
he, " dost thou think that thou art to im-&#xD;
e pose upon a true believer, and sell him a&#xD;
s pipe of wine which is not more than&#xD;
two-thirds full, filling it up with trash of&#xD;
1 some sort or another. Tell me, what it is&#xD;
that is so heavy in the cask now that it is&#xD;
r empty ?"&#xD;
r   The Jew protested his ignorance, and&#xD;
appealed to me: I of course, pretended&#xD;
the same. " Well then," replied the&#xD;
aga, "we will soon see. Let thy Greek&#xD;
send tor his tools, and the cask shall be&#xD;
opened in our presence; then perhaps&#xD;
thou wilt recognize thiuie own knavery."&#xD;
Two of the janissaries were des patch-&#xD;
ed for the tools, and'when they arrived I&#xD;
was directed to take the head out of the&#xD;
cask. I now considered my death as&#xD;
certain-nothing buoyed me up but my&#xD;
observing that the resentment of the aga&#xD;

&#xD;
was levelled more against my master&#xD;
than against me; but still I thought that,&#xD;
when the cask was opened, the recogni-&#xD;
tion of the black slave must immediately&#xD;
take place, and the evidence of my mas-&#xD;
ter would fix the murder upon me.&#xD;
It was with a trembling hand that I&#xD;
obeyed the orders of the aga-the head&#xD;
of the pipe was taken out, and to the&#xD;
horror of all present, the body was ex-&#xD;
posed; but instead of being black, it had&#xD;
turned white, from the time it had been&#xD;
immersed. I rallied a little at this cir-&#xD;
cumstance, as, so far, suspicion would&#xD;
be removed.&#xD;
" Holy Abraham !" exclaimed my&#xD;
master, "what is that which I see !-A&#xD;
dead body, so help, me God !-but 1&#xD;
know nothing about it-do you Charis?"&#xD;
I vowed that I did not, and called the Pa-&#xD;
triarch to witness the truth of my asser-&#xD;
tion. But while we were thusexclaim-&#xD;
ing, the aga's eyes were fixed upon my&#xD;
master with an indignant and deadly stare&#xD;
which spoke volumes; while the remain-&#xD;
der of the people who were present, al-&#xD;
though they said nothing, seemed as if&#xD;
they were ready to tear him into pieces.&#xD;
"Cursed unbeliever !" at last uttered&#xD;
the- Turk, " is it thus thou preparost the&#xD;
wine for the disciples of the prophet ?"&#xD;
" Holy father Abraham !-- I know&#xD;
no more than you do, aga, how that&#xD;
body came there ; but I will change the&#xD;
cask with pleasure, and will send you&#xD;
another."&#xD;
" Be it so," replied the aga; "my&#xD;
slaves shall fetch i4 now." He gave- di-&#xD;
rections accordingly, and the litter.soon&#xD;
re-appeared with another pipe of winery&#xD;
"It will be a heavy loss to a poor&#xD;
Jew-one pipe of good wine," observed&#xD;
my master, as it was rolled out of the&#xD;
litter ; and took up his hat with the in-&#xD;
tention to depart.&#xD;
" Stay," cried the aga, "I do not mean&#xD;
to rob you of your wine."&#xD;
"QOh, then you will pay me for it,"&#xD;
replied my master; "aga, you are a con-&#xD;
siderate man."&#xD;
" Thou shalt see," retorted .the aga,&#xD;
who gave directions to his slaves to&#xD;
draw off the wine 'in vessels. -As soon&#xD;
as the pipe was empty, he desired me to&#xD;
&#xD;
94&#xD;
&#xD;
ake the head out; and when I had obey-&#xD;
ed hirh, he ordered his janissaries to put&#xD;
my master in. In a minute he was gag-&#xD;
ged.and bound, and tossed into the pipe;&#xD;
and I was directed to put in the head as&#xD;
before.&#xD;
I was very unwilling to comply, for I.&#xD;
had no reason to complain of my master,&#xD;
and knew that he was punished for the&#xD;
fault of which I had been guilty. But it'&#xD;
was a case of life or death,-and the&#xD;
days ofself-devotion have long passed&#xD;
away in our country. Besides which, I&#xD;
had the deed in my pocket by which I&#xD;
was a partner in the business, and my&#xD;
master had no heirs,-so that I stood a&#xD;
chance to come into the whole .of his&#xD;
property.&#xD;
Moreover- -&#xD;
"Never mind your reasons," observed&#xD;
the Pacha, "you headed him up in the&#xD;
cask-go on."&#xD;
" I did so, your Highness ; bt al-&#xD;
though I dared not disobey, I assure you&#xD;
that it was vith a sorrowful heart-the&#xD;
more so, as I did not know the fate&#xD;
which might be reserved for myself."'&#xD;
As soon as the head was in, and the&#xD;
hoops driven on, the aga desired his&#xD;
slaves to fill the cask up again with the&#xD;
wine ;- and thus did my poor master per-&#xD;
ish.&#xD;
"Put in the bung, Greek," said the&#xD;
aga, in a stern voice. .&#xD;
I did so, and stood trembling before him.&#xD;
" Well! what knowest thou of this&#xD;
ti'ansaction ?"&#xD;
I thought as the aga had taken away,&#xD;
the life of my master, that it would not&#xD;
hurt him if I took away a little from his&#xD;
character. I answered that I-really knew&#xD;
nothing, but that the other day, a black&#xD;
slave had disappeared in a very suspi-&#xD;
cious manner-that my master made&#xD;
very little inquiry after him-and I now&#xD;
strongly suspected that he must have suf-&#xD;
fered the same fate. I added, that my&#xD;
master had expressed himself very sorry&#xD;
that his highness had taken away the&#xD;
pipe of wine, as he would have reserved&#xD;
it.&#xD;
" CursedJew !" replied the aga ; " I&#xD;
don't doubt but that he has murdered a&#xD;
dozen in the same manner."&#xD;

The Wine Merchant's Story.&#xD;
&#xD;
'" I am afraid so, sir," replied I, "and&#xD;
I suspect that I was to have been hip&#xD;
next victim; for when I talked of going&#xD;
away, he persuaded me to stay, and gave&#xD;
me this paper, by which I was to become&#xD;
his partner with one third of the profits&#xD;
I presume that I should not have enjoyed&#xD;
them long."&#xD;
"Well, Greek, " observed the ga&#xD;
"this is fortunate for you; as, upo  cer&#xD;
tam conditions, you may enter upon the&#xD;
whole property. One is, that you keep&#xD;
this pipe of wine with the rascally Jew&#xD;
in it, that I may have the pleasure occa-&#xD;
sionally to look at my revenge. You&#xD;
tvill also keep the pipe with the other&#xD;
body in it, that it may keep my anger&#xD;
alive. The last is, that you will supply&#xD;
me with what wine I may require of the&#xD;
very best quality, without making any&#xD;
charge. I)o you consent to these terms,&#xD;
or am I to consider you as a party to this&#xD;
infamous transaction ?"&#xD;
I hardly need observe that the terms&#xD;
were gladly accepted. Your Highness&#xD;
must be aware that nobody thinks much&#xD;
about a Jew. When I was questioned&#xD;
as to his disappearance, I shrugged up&#xD;
my shoulders and told the inquirers, con-&#xD;
fidentially, that the aga of the janissaries&#xD;
had put him in prison, and that I was&#xD;
carrying on the business until his re-&#xD;
lease.&#xD;
In compliance with the wishes of the&#xD;
aga, the two asks containing the Jew&#xD;
and the Ethiopian slave, were placed to-&#xD;
gether on settles higher than the rest, in&#xD;
the centre of the store. He -would come&#xD;
in the evening, and rail at the cask con-&#xD;
tainings my late master for hours at a&#xD;
time; during which he drank so much&#xD;
wine, that it wan a very common circum-&#xD;
stance for him to remain in the house&#xD;
until the next morning.&#xD;
You must not suppose, your Highness,&#xD;
that I neglected 'to aail myself (un-&#xD;
known to the aga) of the peculiar prop-&#xD;
erties of the wine which those casiks&#xD;
contained. EI had them spoiled und!er-&#xD;
neath, and constantly running off the&#xD;
wine from them, filled them up afresh.&#xD;
In a short time there was not a gallon in&#xD;
my possession which had not a (lash in.&#xD;
it of either the Ethiopian or the Jew;&#xD;
&#xD;
I and my wine ,was so improved, that it&#xD;
s had a most rapid sale, and I became rich.&#xD;
All went on prosperously for three&#xD;
years ; when the aga, who during that&#xD;
time had been my constant guest, and at&#xD;
'least three times a-week had been intoxi-&#xD;
I cated in my house, was ordered with his&#xD;
troops to join the Sultan's army. By&#xD;
, keeping company with him, I had insen-&#xD;
-4sibly imbibed a taste for wine, although I&#xD;
never had been inebriated. The (lay that&#xD;
his troops marched, he stopped at my&#xD;
door, and dismounting from his Arabian,&#xD;
cme in to take a farewell glass, desiring&#xD;
his men to go on, and that he would ride&#xD;
after them. One glass brought on anoth-&#xD;
er, and the time flew rapidly away. , The&#xD;
evening closed in, and the aga was, as&#xD;
usual, in a state of intoxication ;-he in-&#xD;
sisted upon going down to the store, to&#xD;
rail once more at the cask containing the&#xD;
body of the Jew. We had long been on&#xD;
the most friendly terms, and having this&#xD;
night drank more' than usual, I was in-&#xD;
cautious enough to say-" Prithee, aga,&#xD;
do not abuse my master any ipore, for he&#xD;
has been the making of my fortune. I&#xD;
Will tell you a secret, now that you are&#xD;
going away-there is not a drop of wine&#xD;
in my store that has not been flavored&#xD;
either by him, or by the slave in the oth-&#xD;
er cask. That is the reason why it is so&#xD;
much better than other people's."&#xD;
" How!" exclaimed'the aga, who was&#xD;
now almost incapable of speech,--" Very&#xD;
well,- rascal Greek! die you shall, like&#xD;
your master. Holy prophet!-what a&#xD;
state for a Musselman to go to Paradise--.&#xD;
impregnated with the essence of a cur-&#xD;
sed Jew !-Wretch! you shall die--you&#xD;
shall die."&#xD;
He made a grasp at me, and missing&#xD;
his foot, fell on the ground in such a&#xD;
state of drunkenness as not to be able to&#xD;
get up again. I knew that when he be-&#xD;
came sober, he would not forget what&#xD;
had tiiken place. and that I should be&#xD;
sacrificed to his vengeance. The fear of&#xD;
death, and the wirie which I had drunk,&#xD;
decided me how to act. I dragged him&#xD;
into an empty pipe, put the head in,'&#xD;
hooped it up, and rolling it into the tier,&#xD;
filled it with wine. Thums did I revenge&#xD;
my poor master, and relieved myself from&#xD;

&#xD;
-any further molestation on the part of&#xD;
the aga.&#xD;
As soon a I had bunged up the cask,&#xD;
I went down to the yard where the aga&#xD;
had left his horse, and having severely&#xD;
wounded the poor beast with his sword,&#xD;
1 left it loose that it might gallop home.&#xD;
The noise of the horse's hoofs in the&#xD;
middle of the night, aroused his family,&#xD;
and when they discovered that it was&#xD;
wounded and without its rider, they im-&#xD;
agined that the aga had been attacked and&#xD;
murdered by banditti, when he had fol-&#xD;
lowed his troop. They sent to me to&#xD;
ask at what time he had left my house ;&#xD;
I replied an hour after dark-that he&#xD;
was very much intoxicated at the time&#xD;
and had left his sabre, which I returned.&#xD;
They had no suspicion of the real facts,&#xD;
and it was believed that he perished on&#xD;
the road..-&#xD;
I was now rid of my dangerous ac-&#xD;
quaintance, and although he certainly had&#xD;
drank a great quantity of my wine, yet I&#xD;
recovered the value with interest, from the&#xD;
flavor which .I obtained from his body&#xD;
and imparted to what I had left. I raised&#xD;
him up alongside of the two other casks ;&#xD;
and my trade was more profitable and&#xD;
my wines in greater repute than ever.&#xD;
But one day the cadi, who had heard&#xD;
my wine extolled, came privately to my&#xD;
house ; I bowed to the ground at the&#xD;
honor conferred, for I had long wished&#xD;
to have him as a customer. I drew some&#xD;
of my best-" This, honorable Sir,"&#xD;
said I, presenting the glass, "is what I&#xD;
call my aga wine: the late aga was so&#xD;
fond of it, he used to order a whole cask&#xD;
at once to his house, and had it taken&#xD;
there in a litter."&#xD;
"A good plan," replied the cadi,"much&#xD;
better than sending a slave with a pitch-&#xD;
er, which gives occasion for remarks: I&#xD;
will do the same; but first let me taste&#xD;
all you have."&#xD;
-He tasted several casks, but none plea-&#xD;
sed him so much as the first which 'I had&#xD;
recommended. At last he cast his eyes&#xD;
upon the three casks raised above the&#xD;
others.&#xD;
" And what are those ?" inquired he.&#xD;
" Empty casks, Sir," replied I; but he&#xD;
had his stick in his hand and he struck one.i&#xD;
&#xD;
"Greek, thou tellest me these casks&#xD;
are.empty, but they do not sound so; I&#xD;
suspect thou hast better wine than I have&#xD;
tasted: draw me off from these immedi-&#xD;
ately." &#xD;
I was obliged to comply-he tasted&#xD;
them-vowed that the wine was exqui-&#xD;
site, and that he would purchase the&#xD;
whole. I stated that the wine in those&#xD;
casks was used for the flavoring the rest;&#xD;
and that-the price was enormous, hoping&#xD;
that he would not pay it. He inquired&#xD;
how muc h-I asked him four times the&#xD;
price of the other wines.&#xD;
"Agreed," said the cadi; "it is dear&#xD;
-but one cannot have good wine with-&#xD;
out paying for it :-it is a bargain."&#xD;
I was very much alarmed ; and sta-&#xD;
ted that I could not part with those casks,&#xD;
as I should not be able to carry on my&#xD;
business with reputation, if I lost the&#xD;
means of flavoring my wines, but all&#xD;
in vain ; he said I had asked a price and&#xD;
he had agreed to give it. Ordering his&#xD;
slaves to bring him a litter, he would not&#xD;
leave the store until the whole of the&#xD;
casks were carried away, and thus did&#xD;
I lose my Ethiopian, my Jew, and my&#xD;
aga.&#xD;
As I knew that the secret would soon be&#xD;
discovered, the very next day I prepared&#xD;
for my departure. I received my money&#xD;
from the cadi, to,whom I stated my in-&#xD;
tention to leave, as he had obliged me to&#xD;
sell him those wines, and I had no longer&#xD;
hopes of carrying on my business with&#xD;
success. I again begged him to allow&#xD;
me to have them back, offering him three&#xD;
pipes of wine as a present if he would&#xD;
consent, but it was no use. I chartered&#xD;
a vessel, which I loaded with the rest of&#xD;
my stock: and taking all my money&#xD;
with me, made sail for Corfni, before any&#xD;
discovery had taken place. But we en.&#xD;
countered a heavy gale of wind, which&#xD;
after a fortnight, (during which vbe at-&#xD;
tempted in vain to make head against it)&#xD;
forced us back to Smyrna. When the&#xD;
weather moderated, I directed the c'ap-&#xD;
tain to take the vessel into the-outer road-&#xD;
stead, thatI might sail as soon as possi-&#xD;
ble. We had not dropped anchor again&#xD;
more than five minutes when I perceived&#xD;
ia boat pulling off from the shore, in&#xD;

which was the cadi-and the officers o&#xD;
justice.&#xD;
Convinced that I was discovered,&#xD;
was at a loss how to proceed,' when a&#xD;
idea occurred to me that I might concea&#xD;
my own body in a cask, as I had befor&#xD;
so well concealed those of others.&#xD;
I called the captain down into the cab&#xD;
in, and telling him that I had reason t(&#xD;
suspect that the cadi would take my life&#xD;
offered him a large part of my cargo if&#xD;
he would assist me.&#xD;
The captain, who, unfortunately foi&#xD;
me, was a.Greek, consented.  We wen&#xD;
down into the hold, started the wine ou&#xD;
of one of the pipes, and having taker&#xD;
out the head, I crawled in, and was hoop.&#xD;
ed up.&#xD;
The cadi came on board immediately&#xD;
afterwards, and inquired for me. The&#xD;
captain stated that I had fallen over-&#xD;
board in the gale, and that he had in&#xD;
consequence returned, the vessel .not&#xD;
being consigned to any house at Cor-&#xD;
fu.&#xD;
"6Has then the accursed villain esca-&#xD;
ped my vengeance !" exclaimed the cadi;&#xD;
"the murderer, that fines his wines with&#xD;
the bodies of his fellow-creatures; but&#xD;
you may deceive me, Greek, we will ex-&#xD;
amine the vessel."&#xD;
The officers who accompanied the cadi&#xD;
proceeded carefully to search every part&#xD;
of the ship. Not being able to dis-&#xD;
cover me, the Greek captain was believ-&#xD;
ed ; and after a thousand imprecations&#xD;
upon my soul, the cadi and his people&#xD;
departed.&#xD;
I now breathed freer, notwithstanding&#xD;
I was nearly intoxicated with the lees of&#xD;
the wine which impregnated the wood&#xD;
of the cask, and I was anxious to be set&#xD;
at liberty : but the treacherous captain&#xD;
had no such intention, and never came&#xD;
near me. At night he cut his cable and&#xD;
made sail, and I overheard a conversa-&#xD;
tion between two of the men, which&#xD;
made known to me his intentions: these&#xD;
were to throw me overboard on his pas&#xD;
sage, anid take possession of my proper-j&#xD;
ty. I cried out to them from the hung-&#xD;
hole: I screamed for mercy, but ini vain,.&#xD;
One of them answered, that, as I mur-&#xD;
dered others, and put them into casks,&#xD;

&#xD;
f I should now be treated in the same&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
I   I could not but mentally acknowledge&#xD;
n the justice of my punishment, and re-&#xD;
1 signed myself to my fate ; all that I&#xD;
e wished was to be thrown over at once&#xD;
and released from my misery. The mo-&#xD;
- mentary anticipation of death appeared&#xD;
o to be so much worse than the reality.&#xD;
But it was ordered otherwise ; a gale of&#xD;
wind blew up with such force that the&#xD;
captain and crew had enough to do to&#xD;
r look after the vessel, and either I was&#xD;
t forgotten, or my (loom was postponed un-&#xD;
t til a more seasonable opportunity.&#xD;
On the third day I- heard the sailors&#xD;
- observe that, with such a wretch as I&#xD;
was remaining on board, the vessel must&#xD;
inevitably be lost. The hatches were&#xD;
then opened: I was hoisted up and cast&#xD;
into the raging sea. The bung of the&#xD;
cask was out, but by stuffing my handker-&#xD;
chief in, when the hole was under, water,&#xD;
I prevented the cask from filling ; and&#xD;
when it was uppermost, I removed it for&#xD;
a moment to obtain fresh air. I was dread-&#xD;
fully bruised by the constant rolling in a&#xD;
heavy sea, and completely worn out with&#xD;
fatigue and pain ; I had made up my mind&#xD;
to let the water in and be rid of my life,&#xD;
when I was tossed over and over with such&#xD;
dreadful rapidity as prevented my taking&#xD;
the precaution of keeping out the water.&#xD;
After three successive rolls of the same&#xD;
kind, I found that the cask, which had&#xD;
been in the surf, had struck on the beach.&#xD;
In a moment after I heard voices, and&#xD;
people came up to the cask and rolled&#xD;
me along. I would not speak, lest they&#xD;
should be frightened and allow me to re-&#xD;
main on the beach, where I might again&#xD;
be tossed about by the waves; but as&#xD;
soon as they stopped, I called in a faint&#xD;
voice from the bung-hole, begging them&#xD;
for mercy's sake to let me out.&#xD;
At first they appeared alarmed ; but,&#xD;
on my repeating my request, and stating&#xD;
that I wvas the owner of the ship which&#xD;
was off the land, and that the captain&#xD;
andl crew had mutinied and tossed me&#xD;
overboard, they brought some tools and&#xD;
set me at liberty.-&#xD;

I was released, was my vessel lying a&#xD;

wreck ; each wave that hurled her tur-&#xD;
ther on the beach, breaking her more and&#xD;
more to pieces. She was already-divi-&#xD;
ded amid-ships, and the white foaming&#xD;
surf was covered with plpes of wine,&#xD;
which as fast as they were cast ashore,&#xD;
were rolled up by the same people who&#xD;
had released me. I was so worn out,&#xD;
that I fainted where I lay.  When I&#xD;
came to, I found myself in a cave upon&#xD;
a bundle of capotes, and perceived a&#xD;
party of forty or fifty men, who were sit-&#xD;
ting by a large fire, and emptying with&#xD;
great rapidity one of my pipes of wine.&#xD;
As soon as they observed that I was&#xD;
coming to my senses, they poured some&#xD;
wine down my throat, which restored&#xD;
me. I was then desired by one of them,&#xD;
who seemed to be the chief, to ap-&#xD;
proach.&#xD;
"'lhe men who have been saved from&#xD;
the wreck," said he, "have - told me&#xD;
strange stories of your enormous crimes&#xD;
--now it down and tell me the truth-&#xD;
if I beli ve you, you shall have justice&#xD;
-I am , di    e-if you wish to know&#xD;
where you are, it is upon the island of&#xD;
Ischia-if you vish to know in what&#xD;
company, it is in the society of those&#xD;
who by illiberal people are called pirates :&#xD;
now tell me the truth."&#xD;
I- thought that with pirates my story&#xD;
would be received better than with other&#xD;
people, and I therefore narrated my his-&#xD;
tory to them, in the same words that I&#xD;
now have to your Highness. When I&#xD;
had finished, the captain of the gang ob-&#xD;
served :-.-&#xD;
"Well, then, as you acknowledge to&#xD;
&#xD;
98&#xD;
&#xD;
PRICE 25 CENTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
have killed a slave, to have assisted at&#xD;
the death of a Jew, and to have drowned&#xD;
an aga, you certainly deserve death ; but&#xD;
on consideration of the excellence of the&#xD;
wine, and the secret which you have im-&#xD;
parted to us, I shall commute your sen-&#xD;
tence. As for the captain and the re-&#xD;
mainder of the crew, they have been&#xD;
guilty of treachery and piracy o-n the&#xD;
high seas-a most heinous offence, which&#xD;
deserves instant death: but as it is by&#xD;
their means' that we have been put in&#xD;
possession of the wine, I shall be lenient.&#xD;
I therefore sentence you all to hard la-&#xD;
bor for life. You shall be sold as slaves&#xD;
in Cairo,'and we will pocket the money&#xD;
and drink your wine."&#xD;
The pirates loudly applauded the jus-&#xD;
tice of a decision by which they benefit-&#xD;
ed, and all appeal on our parts was use-&#xD;
less. When the weather became more&#xD;
settled, we were put on board one of&#xD;
their small xebeques, and on our art ival at&#xD;
this port were exposed for sale and pur-&#xD;
chased.&#xD;
Such, Pacha, is my history, and I&#xD;
hope you will allow that I have been&#xD;
more unfortunate than guilty, as, on eve-&#xD;
ry occasion in which I took away the&#xD;
life of another, 1 had only to choose be-&#xD;
tween that and my own.&#xD;
" Mashallah ! Bounty ! I've given him&#xD;
his life, and, as he considers it, of more&#xD;
value than an aga's, J think it is a very&#xD;
handsome present. Drown an aga, in-&#xD;
deed I" continued the Pacha, rising, but&#xD;
it certainly was a very curious story.&#xD;
Let it be written down, Mustapha.&#xD;
We'll hear the other man to-morrow.&#xD;
