               <head>Family Failings.—Price 50 Cents.</head>
               <p>This novel will find much favor with the public from its pleasing character. It is strictly moral in its tendency, and gives a fine and truthful picture of English domestic life of the higher class. The hero, "Horace Leigh," is a fine character, not over-drawn, and well worthy of imitation—a fit subject "to point a moral or adorn a tale"—yet not without his "family failings," which the author has shown up in a clever manner, as a beacon to warn the voyager off from the shoals and quicksands of this life. The work is worth perusal, and will repay the reader alike for his outlay and trouble. <title>Scottish American Journal.</title>
               </p>
               <p>It aims to represent the hollowness and superficiality of fashionable society, the evils of mercenary match-making, and the misery and wrong which the customs of an artificial society cause to ingenuous hearts and aspiring souls. It is a work of more than average power and interest. <title>Home Journal.</title>

               <p>Few English female writers of fiction are spoken of more highly by the English press, than MRS. GREY. The plot of this story is good, and worked out with admirable skill. The characters are seen in life-like pictures. The impudence and diabolical villainy of the principal heroes can scarcely be equaled, while the heroine is a noble and beautiful portraiture. Every chapter increases in interest, until the story comes to a happy conclusion. Read it.—<title>Journal.</title>
               </p>
               <p>From a brief review of this book, we would judge that it is a story of much interest, replete with most stirring and exciting incidents, and embodying characters drawn more to the life than is generally presented in novels. The plot is drawn with great tact, and the interest of the reader does not flag until the last page is perused. <title>Mobile Daily Tribune.</title>

               <head>The Hen-Pecked Husband.—Price 50 Cents.</head>
               <p>This is a well-written novel, in style above the ordinary run of fiction; characters well conceived and well presented, and abounding in sage philosophical reflections on social life. The English critics speak of its merits with unstinted praise, and universally agree that its keen and delicate humor, its accurate developments of female character, and its peculiar delicacy of sentiment, entitle it to a very high rank in modern literature. <title>N. Y. Dispatch.</title>
               </p>
               <p>We do not know that MRS. GREY has penned a novel superior to this. The parts that are clever and lively, contrast well with certain touches of pathos and scenes wrought up with great feeling; and the characters exhibit features of originality sufficient to entitle even those in fashionable life to be considered as very able impersonations. Indeed, it is really a very interesting novel. <title>Literary Gazette.</title>

               <p>Matchmaking, or Family Manœuvres, is the title of a new novel by the author of Jilt. It is a capital story, and illustrates in the most amusing manner some of the peculiar phases of English society. <title>N. Y. Herald.</title>
               </p>
               <p>A work of brilliancy and interest, and a splendid photograph of the subtle diplomacy of female ingenuity. A story well calculated to disabuse the reader's mind of the old fallacy that matches are made in heaven. <title>N. Y. Dispatch.</title>
               </p>
               <p>This is a reprint of a capital and very successful English novel, which will, we are sure, be quite as successful here as it was in England. It is written in the highest style of sensational art. <title>Fitzgerald's City Item.</title>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>IN a simple but tasteful apartment, forming one of the few rooms of a beautiful cottage, not far from the famed town of Taunton, Somerset, sat a lady, whose appearance and dress accorded well with everything around her. Still young, though faded and careworn to a degree that betrayed long and deep sorrow,—still beautiful, in spite of the absence of the bloom and brightness that had once given a peculiar attraction to her delicate and lovely features,—this lady was dressed with an elegant simplicity that, when combined with the extreme plainness yet good taste of the furniture, spoke at once of limited means and refined habits. Her attitude was expressive of deep but resigned and patient sorrow, and her eyes were bent on the work she held in her hand, with a look of mingled pride and sadness more touching than tears. It was an infant's frock, which she had just completed, though the tiny robe itself was apparently forgotten in the train of thought it had awakened, and by degrees her fingers unconsciously relaxed, and the delicate white cambric lay unnoticed on the rug at her feet.</p>
               <p>A violent ring at the bell, given with that peculiar sharpness of the rustic postman, made the lady start, and the blood rush to her pale face.</p>
               <p>"At last!" she murmured. "It must be from him. No one else knows of my residence here—scarcely remembers my very existence. Thank Heaven he has written at last. I have done him sad wrong, faithless that I am."</p>
               <p>She started up, but her limbs failed her, and pale, trembling, her poor heart beating visibly under the white dress, she waited for Jane's tardy entrance. There was an apparently interminable delay, while the one servant she possessed went deliberately to the door, and held some parley with the new comer. Perhaps she was mistaken—it was not the postman after all; and she sank back in her chair with a low, half-suppressed moan of mingled disappointment and exhaustion. But Jane's heavy tread was heard at last approaching the door; the handle turned, and the honest but blunt woman appeared, a letter in her hand.</p>
               <p>"Please, ma'am, the postman says there is a shilling and sixpence to pay, and something for his trouble in coming out of time, because it is marked 'immediate,' and I told him it was just robbery and imposition; for 'what's the post for?' says I."</p>
               <p>Jane might have gone on for some minutes longer in her protest against this attack on her mistress's slender exchequer had not her attention been suddenly attracted by that mistress's strange terrified look, as she gazed at the still unopened letter.</p>
               <p>"Dear me, ma'am," said she, "what's the matter? Why, you look as pale and scared like, as if you had seen a ghost. Sure nobody's dead that you are so upset like?"</p>
               <p>For a moment the lady looked vacantly at the wondering face of the honest Jane, and then with a powerful effort she tried to collect her scattered senses, to meet the girl's natural questions.</p>
               <p>"No, no, my good girl," she replied, "only—I was surprised, and the writing on the letter brought back sad memories. There, take my purse, pay the man what he wants, and do not come till I ring."</p>
               <p>Jane reluctantly obeyed; her economy and curiosity were both outraged by the orders of her lady, but there was evidently no appeal, for Mrs. Stephenson held out the purse with an impatient and tremulous gesture that it would have been somewhat hazardous to disregard. So the honest woman silently and slowly left the room, and avenged her enforced obedience on the <choice>

                     <corr>unlucky</corr>
                  </choice> head of the innocent postman, in a gush of eloquence more forcible than polite.</p>
               <p>Scarcely had the door closed behind Jane<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6520-00000003"/> when the restrained agony of the pale woman she had left broke forth. She fell back in her chair, with clasped hands and tearless eyes—two deep red spots on each cheek alone varying the corpse-like hue of her face and lips.</p>
               <p>"Merciful Father!" she exclaimed, in a voice of anguish, "spare me! oh, spare me! It is more than I can bear, this fearful, horrible dread. Oh, if I find it true and real,—I dare not, I cannot open that terrible letter, lest it be made a crushing reality. It cannot be—it is too much—I am torturing myself in vain. It is some mistake, some trick on my credulity; he could not rise from the grave to reproach me. Oh, if he were but here, I should fear nothing; but I am so weak and nervous, with all I have suffered and feared, that even shadows terrify me; I am such a feeble, foolish creature."</p>
               <p>There was a piteous attempt at a laugh, so hollow and constrained, that it would have me le a bystander shudder, and her pale lips quivered as they parted in the vain effort with a cold, ague-like shiver. Poor Agatha Stephenson! your worst enemy might have pitied you at that moment.</p>
               <p>She seized the letter which lay on her lap, with the direction underneath and the seal uppermost, as if to hide the fatal handwriting from her sight, and then with a desperate courage she tore it open, and read line after line and page after page of the closely written epistle, and her cheeks and lips blanched even whiter as she went on, and her blue eyes grew wild and earnest in their straining gaze on characters which seemed written in fiery, scorching red to her excited imagination. Word after word she read and dwelt on till the last drop of agony was drained to the dregs, and then with one low, agonising groan, she sank senseless in her chair.</p>
               <p>Jane Morris was a faithful and trusty personage in her way, but she had all the failings of her sex, and it was not very marvellous if she was tempted by a natural curiosity to hover near the door of the sitting-room after the postman's departure had left her at liberty to reflect on her mistress's singular demeanor at the sight of the mysterious letter. Now it happened to be only the second missive of the kind which had reached The Nest since Mrs. Stephenson had taken up her abode there, and retained in her service the worthy attendant of an invalid gentleman who had formerly been its tenant; and this circumstance, added to the lady's extreme depression of spirits and seclusion from society, was in itself sufficient to waken Jane's desire to know something of "the young creature's story, and what made her so sad like," and "to give her a bit of comfort that she seemed to want so wofully."</p>
               <p>So Jane stood within a reasonable distance of the apartment, not to appear impertinently inquisitive even to her own conscientious sense of right; but for some time she was unrewarded by anything that could satisfy her thirst for knowledge, or need her kindly sympathy. At last, however, just as she was about to move away as quietly as strong boots and a strong frame would allow, the deep, low groan that had escaped the poor lady's lips, as she lost consciousness of her misery, broke on the servant's ears, and in an instant she burst into the room.</p>
               <p>That pale, beautiful face, and rigid form lying back in an attitude which told of utter wretchedness, even in the insensibility which deadened it for the time, was a sad sight for Jane's kindly eyes. The letter was still grasped tightly in Mrs. Stephenson's hand, and to do Jane justice, she did not pause to look at its mysterious contents before attempting to recall her young mistress to life. She raised the slight form in her strong arms, and laid it on the couch, and then she went for water, and brandy and salts, and all the remedies for a swoon, which she was accustomed to consider infallible. But it was long, very long, before her mistress opened her eyes, and even then they looked so wild and unconscious that Jane almost preferred their previous death-like close from light and life.</p>
               <p>"What is it, my dear lady? don't look like that!" she said, bending over the sufferer, and caressing her; "there, drink this, and take heart; I'll take care of you, never fear; there's no one near but me, and I'll not see you wrongly done by; only, keep up your spirits, and don't give way like this. There, there, you're better now."</p>
               <p>"Where is he?" murmured the lady; "I thought I saw him. There—there he is! Oh, save me! save me!"</p>
               <p>"Dear me, my dear mistress; don't ye know, don't ye; there's no one but me here, and I will be true as steel, come what may. I'll never desert a poor young creature like you, whatever betides, especially when there's your trouble coming, though it should be a joy too, to a young mother."</p>
               <p>The old servant's motherly caresses and tones seemed to bring some comfort to the sufferer, though the words were probably unheard and uncomprehended.</p>
               <p>"There, there, my dear mistress," resumed the good woman; "now, do take comfort. Think of that little darling, and what a terrible thing it would be for her to lose her mother as well as her poor, dear papa, though she's got as good a father in—"</p>
               <p>A quick, sharp moan, almost a scream, stopped Jane's garrulity, and she changed her tone.</p>
               <p>"Now, just compose yourself for her sake, the pretty pet; only think how she fretted when she parted with you to go to Mrs. Bovill's, though, of course, it was best she should go away till your trouble was over."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stephenson's eyes were closed, but the tight, rigid grasp of her hand relaxed as the woman spoke, and then her head sank on the strong shoulder that supported her, and, to Jane's great relief, tears burst from under the hot, flushed eyelids, and she let her young mistress weep, only soothing her by mute caresses, till a deep, sharp moan and convulsive starts again broke on the returning quiet of the patient.</p>
               <p>"What is it, my dear lady? What frightened you?" she asked, tenderly.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Jane, I am ill, very ill; but no matter, better for me to die," she murmured faintly; and again a deep low moan escaped her pale lips.</p>
               <p>Jane's quick perception soon guessed the truth; the agitation which that fatal letter had produced was doing its natural work, and brought hastily and unexpectedly on the fragile recluse that hour to which all who await it look with trembling, though often with the tender joy of expectant maternity.</p>
               <p>"My dear mistress, my poor lady, listen," said Jane. "Try and compose yourself and keep quiet, while I go for a few minutes and send for the doctor. I won't be long, for I saw Archie Fleming in the lane, and he'll run for me. There you won't mind for a moment or two. You're better now."</p>
               <p>The words did indeed seem to give new strength to the invalid; she started violently, and grasped Jane's hand with convulsive force.</p>
               <p>"No, no, no!" she cried. "I must not—I will not. It would kill me! No doctor—I dare not—he would know it. Let me die!—let me die!—but don't leave me."</p>
               <p>Jane was a shrewd, strong-minded, Cornish woman, not apt to be agitated or alarmed at trifles, but it must be confessed her present dilemma was somewhat perplexing, and for a few minutes she stood in a state of greater nervous tremor and doubt than she had ever experienced in the whole course of her past life. But another glance at the pale face and closed eyes of the patient seemed to rouse her to the prompt action that was habitual to her. She gently released herself from the now relaxing grasp of the slender fingers, and noiselessly but swiftly left the room, carrying with her the letter which had worked such mischief.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stephenson, whose momentary exertion of strength had relapsed into yet greater exhaustion, scarcely knew that her kindhearted domestic was absent from the room; still less did she heed the abstraction of the letter that had dropped from her fingers, before the door again opened and Jane reentered, accompanied by a hale, elderly woman, of those comfortable proportions, and that kindly bustling air, which are so frequently the characteristics of matrons blessed with large families, and hearts of proportionate size and softness. She approached the invalid with a sort of cheery, yet pitying manner, that is generally most efficacious in such emergencies.</p>
               <p>"There, there, don't fret, my good lady," said she; "we shall soon have all right, and bring you round again, as well and merry as my Lizzy; and that's saying something, for she's as gleesome a lass as any in Somersetshire. We don't want the doctor, not a bit; I'm the mother of thirteen myself; and have just got another fine little grandchild to keep my hand in. Now, Jenny, my woman, just do as I tell ye."</p>
               <p>The worthy matron began to bustle about in true sick-room fashion, aided by the equally kind and shrewd Jenny, till even the drooping, wretched patient, on whom their cares were lavished, began to feel the influence of the cheerful and experienced Mrs. Lynes, and recover in some slight measure from the stunning effect of the shock she had received.</p>
               <p>"Jane," she whispered faintly to her trusty servant, while the nurse was busily engaged at some distance, "I can trust you. If I die, as I feel I shall, and my poor babe lives, do not desert it; and, hark: in my desk is a letter; send it; and there is enough, all I have; only be a mother to it while it needs care and kindness—unless—"</p>
               <p>She could say no more; and Jane, earnestly promising with tears in her honest eyes to fulfill all her wishes, insisted on her remaining in perfect quiet, without any further effort at explanation, till "she was well again, as she soon would be."</p>
               <p>The minutes and hours passed on in suspense and anxiety to the kind nurses, and then came the same announcement that has brought joy to many a young mother's heart, "come, my dear young lady, cheer up; you've got as fine a boy as I ever saw, and healthy, too, as he's handsome."</p>
               <p>The words, however, fell on deaf ears. Agatha Stephenson was insensible to tidings either of joy or sorrow, and the kindly Jenny wept tears of sorrow and terror over the sweet, pale face, that looked indeed like that of a corpse.</p>
               <p>Was the child motherless at the very moment he was born into this weary world?</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>IN an elegantly-furnished dressing-room, a few weeks after the events related in our first chapter, a lady as fair and young, or perhaps younger and more lovely than the pale, faded Agatha Stephenson, was reclining in a luxurious easy-chair. Her attitude, the graceful yet negligent wrapper, and a certain delicacy and languor in her face, betokened recent illness; but there was an inexpressible happiness in her blue eyes and rosy lips that belied any idea of present suffering. Near her sat a still young and very noble-looking man, whose air and bearing seemed to point him out as a soldier, and one who had seen some service in his short career.<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6520-00000004"/> His eyes were fixed on the lovely face of his wife with anxious tenderness, and her hand was fondly clasped in his.</p>
               <p>"Then you will not go; Morrison," she said, coaxingly; "you promise me that?"</p>
               <p>"I will not leave you and our boy, dearest; "that is decided," was the reply. "But if you can go with me, I should certainly prefer accepting the appointment. It is both an honorable and lucrative post, and one that will reflect distinction on a man who fills it well and faithfully. You would not object to a few years in India for my sake, Nellie?"</p>
               <p>The little hand clasped his more firmly, as she replied: "I would go anywhere with you, Morrison; but our boy—I dread the climate for such an infant; but if the doctors say he would not suffer, I can wish nothing but what will be for your honor and happiness, my noble husband."</p>
               <p>The young officer bent over his wife's face and kissed it tenderly. Who could resist such gentle, unselfish devotion, in one so lovely and delicate?</p>
               <p>"But, where is the youngster?" he asked gaily, when the silence that followed had become almost painful to their excited nerves. "I have not seen him since I came in, two hours ago."</p>
               <p>"Nurse has taken him out, Morrison," she replied. "The afternoon was so warm and bright, she thought he might go out with safety. It is only the second time; but the little darling looked so fresh and nice when he was brought in yesterday, that I wanted him to be in the air again, though I quite miss him from the room. Don't you, dearest? But nurse should have returned long since. I am almost uneasy about him."</p>
               <p>"I can miss nothing when you are here, my dear one," said the lover-husband: "but I do like to see the little prince royal, nevertheless, so don't look so reproachful. I admire the little rascal almost as much as you do."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Morrison, what should we do if we were to lose him!" said his wife. "It seems quite strange to think that a few weeks ago we were without him. I can hardly fancy such a life again, can you?"</p>
               <p>Before her husband could reply, the door opened suddenly, and a woman burst into the room, with a face so pale, so stricken with terror and distress, that Captain Morrison started to his feet, and his wife uttered a faint cry of alarm.</p>
               <p>"Woman, what is it? Speak!" said the officer, sternly, in a hoarse tone.</p>
               <p>"My child! my child! What has happened?" shrieked the young mother, as the woman still stood speechless, with lips working, and limbs shaking in uncontrollable agitation.</p>
               <p>"Speak!—where is the infant?" repeated Captain Morrison, in tones that were not to be disobeyed with impunity."</p>
               <p>"Gone!—stolen! Oh, forgive me—forgive me!" cried the woman, sinking on her knees in abject terror.</p>
               <p>"Wretch!—you lie! You have killed it, and would cover your crime by wicked falsehood!" thundered the officer, sternly.</p>
               <p>A deep groan from the distant spot where his wife sat, recalled him to the thought of one yet dearer and more helpless, and he fled to the sufferer's side.</p>
               <p>"My darling, be comforted." he said; "all will be well. The woman raves. I will restore you our child ere many hours are past; only keep up, for my sake,—for his sake!"</p>
               <p>The words were however unheeded, unheard. The heart-stricken mother had fainted.</p>
               <p>The husband rang furiously for help; and then, committing his young wife to the care of her old and faithful maid, he sternly commanded the guilty woman to follow him, and give a more connected account of the disaster.</p>
               <p>It was difficult to learn from the terrified nurse an intelligent report of what had occurred, but by degrees she confessed that, while walking out, she had been accosted by a man whom she had never seen before, and who had by degrees induced her to accompany him to a cottage, where he said he had some pretty ornaments from abroad that he would give her, if she would come and look at them. While there he and a female, who appeared to be his wife, offered her a glass of warm negus, which quite stupefied her for a time; and when she came to herself, the baby and the man and woman were gone, and all her efforts to trace them were in vain. She hesitated what to do, whether to return and confess her fault, or fly from the place, but her better feelings prevailed, and, with fear and trembling, she sought her employer's presence.</p>
               <p>Captain Morrison had composed himself with difficulty to hear the woman's story, and then commanding her to leave his sight, but not on any account to appear before her mistress, nor yet leave the house without his permission, he returned to his young wife, to speak some hope and comfort, before setting off on the search for his lost child.</p>
               <p>The stricken mother was just returning to consciousness as he entered, and the husband judiciously concluded that it would be better to leave her in this half-insensible state while he pursued the search, trusting to the old domestic to deliver his message of love and consolation when she should be able to hear and understand it. In truth, the young officer scarcely doubted that he should soon discover the infant, since it could have been stolen scarcely more than an hour; and when he left his wife's chamber it was with the full assurance that he should return to it with the lost infant in his arms, to gladden the mother's heart.</p>
               <p>Captain Morrison once more visited the room, where the nurse was awaiting him, to receive from her a more exact account of the locality of the cottage, and the man who had lured her into it; but the woman was so bewildered and confused with the combined effects of the wine and the alarm and real remorse she had suffered, that her replies, from their contradictory and unintelligible descriptions, were worse than useless. He therefore determined to lose no more time in the fruitless examination, but hastened from the house, accompanied by one or two servants, whom he dispatched in different directions, in quest of the missing child.</p>
               <p>Hours passed in that anxious and eager search, but without success; not a trace of the infant, or the villain who had stolen it, could be found. Every cottage in the village was visited, every child in arms examined, whether answering to the age of the lost baby or not; but the infant Eustace was nowhere to be found.</p>
               <p>"There's only one place left, sir," observed one of the servants, who had been Captain Morrison's attendant before his marriage. "There's an old woman that lives about two miles off in a lonely place enough; she's a decent body, and I don't believe would have anything to do with such villainy, any how, there's no harm in going there."</p>
               <p>Captain Morrison assented with a heavy and despairing heart; he had little hope left now, but anything that kept up the comfort of action, and gave a gleam of light in the darkness and gloom of his heart, was welcome.</p>
               <p>Davidson's two miles was certainly a "long three," but the limbs know little weariness when the mind is oppressed with sorrow, and the bereaved father heeded nothing but the suspense which the delay prolonged, as they took their silent way to the cottage.</p>
               <p>It was a lonely spot, in the midst of fields, and sheltered by a thick wood, which looked gloomy and dark in the rapidly increasing obscurity. But even in the imperfect light, Captain Morrison could see that the cottage, and the garden round it, were well kept, and neat, and he instinctively felt that there was but little chance of finding his stolen infant in a place which, by it's very aspect, spoke of care, respectability, and honesty. The application for admission was at once replied to, and Captain Morrison entered the clean, neatly furnished room, where the family were sitting at supper.</p>
               <p>The group consisted of an elderly woman, her youngest son, a sturdy farm-laborer, and two or three grand-children, including an infant in a cradle at the old woman's feet.</p>
               <p>Captain Morrison was a gentleman, even in that time of distress and anxiety, and he apologized for disturbing the family, before he explained in hurried and broken words, his melancholy errand.</p>
               <p>"Poor babe, poor babe," exclaimed the old woman with nearly tears in her eyes. "'Tis enough to kill the mother, poor, dear lady; dear, dear sir, I'd as soon keep your lady's jewels, as your child, unless indeed it was to take it back to you, if the villain had the impudence to bring it here."</p>
               <p>"And he'd have had a good horsewhipping for his pains," put in the honest looking peasant; "why, mother, he might as well have taken the poor little fellow I helped carry to 'The Nest.' this afternoon, if he did want a child. I reckon that would have been no loss."</p>
               <p>"Hold your tongue, Will," said his mother: "you don't know a mother's feelings for her bairn, whatever trouble it brings on her, and may be the poor young thing at 'The Nest' loves her child as much as the honorable Captain's lady does hers."</p>
               <p>"What child? what poor young creature do you mean?" asked Captain Morrison, eagerly; for he had a vague hope, whenever a stranger infant was concerned, that it might prove to be his own.</p>
               <p>"Why, sir," said Mrs. Lynes, "'tis only a baby I had to nurse, and a fine little fellow too; but, as my Will says, there was trouble at his birth, though I don't exactly know the rights of it; I expect something of a love child, that's the truth, though the mother is a sweet, young creature, and I can't help thinking must be married honestly, after all."</p>
               <p>"And who is she? where did she come from? where is the child?" asked Captain Morrison, though his better judgment told him the tale could scarcely be connected with his lost infant.</p>
               <p>"'Tis a strange business altogether, sir," replied Mrs. Lynes; "you see, about six months ago, a young lady and a little girl about two years old came to 'The Nest,' as we call that little cottage on the road to Taunton, that stands back in its grounds. In course, we all thought her husband would soon come too, but she never said that she was wife or widow, till at last, when it was plain that there was another little one coming, she could not keep silence any longer, you see, sir; and then Jenny found out somehow, that the little girl's father was dead; though, how long, and whether the poor young lady had got another husband, or worse, no one could say. But two days before she was taken ill, a person came, and took the little girl away till her mother's confinement was over, as it was said; and then the trouble came on her quite sudden like, and I suppose she had no time to say where the little one was in case anything happened to her; as in truth it nearly did, even if it actually didn't come to pass, as I am going to tell you, sir, only 'tis a long story, you see.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, the babe was born, and when I brought it away to my cottage here to nurse with my daughter's, I did not think the mother would live an hour, or ever set eyes<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6520-00000005"/> on her child. But when I went the next day to the house, to see after the poor body, as there was only Jenny Morris to nurse her, and she not being a married woman, you see, sir, couldn't be like the mother of a family like me; but, deary me, when I got to the gate, who should meet me but Archie Fleming, the big loon, and he whispered, all open mouthed like, 'Jane says you ain't to go in, at no price, nor come again till she sends for you.' So, you see, sir, I was quite mazed, and asked the lad what it meant, but he knew nothing, except that a tall, foreign looking man had come to the village late in the night before, and asked the way to 'The Nest,' and Archie thought perhaps he was there then; but he hadn't seen him that day. And so I came home again to the two babies, and you may be sure I'd enough to do with them, without gadding and gossiping; and I never had word nor sign till this morning when Jane sent for me, by Archie Fleming himself. And, when I went, all eager and curious like, as was natural, to see the upshot of it, there sure enough was Jenny, but not a soul besides that I could see.</p>
               <p>"'Mrs. Lynes,' says she; 'you're a good and God-fearing woman, and you won't want me to break my word, to say nothing of an oath, and so you wont ask me no questions, but send or bring me the babe this afternoon.'</p>
               <p>"'And the mother,' says I; 'is she doing all right. Jenny?'</p>
               <p>"'Ask no questions,' she says; 'I can't answer one, no, not if you were my own mother; so just do as I bid you, and here's something for your trouble and care, Mrs. Lynes.'</p>
               <p>"She gave me a purse, with some bank notes and gold in it; look, here it is, sir. And so, in course, I did not tempt the woman to break her oath, but came my ways, more by token that I only left my grandchild Bessie here to watch the lady's wean, while her sister took out the other little one in the fresh air. And, as Will says, he and I took the infant to 'The Nest,' as soon as I had fed it, and we have not been back more than an hour or so."</p>
               <p>"And did you see any one, any stranger I mean?" asked the Captain.</p>
               <p>"No, sir, at least not at the house," replied Mrs. Lynes; "but I did hear my little grandchild Polly say as how a strange man had spoken to her, and asked if the baby she was carrying was a girl or boy. And, in course, she said a girl, and then he went off and she didn't see him again, though she staid out a good time, a deal too long, as I told her, for a babe like that."</p>
               <p>Captain Morrison had suppressed his impatience sufficiently to listen to the woman's garrulous narrative, knowing that it was the only chance of learning any facts that might throw a light on the calamity that had befallen him. But he now cut short any further confidential reflections on the strange story, in which he felt little interest in such a time of distress, and hastily requesting the worthy people to do all they could to assist him in gaining tidings of his child, and promising to see them on the morrow, he left the cottage, to return to his sad and desolate home.</p>
               <p>It was with fear and trembling that Captain Morrison entered the house and demanded tidings of his fair young wife from the pale, terrified servant, who met at the threshold.</p>
               <p>"My mistress is but sadly sir," was the reply. "We've sent for Doctor White, as Mervyn thought it better not to wait till you came back, sir, and he's with my lady now."</p>
               <p>Captain Morrison rushed up stairs to the sick room, unable to bear further suspense, or ask another question of the trembling domestic, but his progress was arrested by the physician himself, as he left the apartment of the sufferer.</p>
               <p>"Better not go in, my good sir, unless you've good news," said the doctor. "Perfect quiet is the only chance for your wife, and I've given her a strong composing draught, to give time for both you and her to recover yourselves a little. Besides, it can't be long before you recover the little one; there could be no object but money in stealing it, and you won't mind an inroad into your purse, even by those rascals, to secure the child."</p>
               <p>Captain Morrison yielded reluctantly to the peremptory order of the physician, and accompanied him to the library, in order to consult the experienced and shrewd old man, as to the measures to be next taken; and together they arranged every means that wealth, energy, and skill could devise and carry out for a diligent and comprehensive scouring of the country round for the missing infant.</p>
               <p>Day after day, week after week passed on, and no tidings of the missing babe could be obtained. Vague rumors of more than one strange visitant to the village, about the time of its disappearance, were all that could be gathered from the cottagers and neighbors round. But the descriptions so varied, as to time, place, dress, and appearance, that it could only be imagined either that some glamour had been cast on the witness's eyes, or that there must at the very least have been two new comers to the neighborhood, during the few days before and after the abstraction of the little Eustace.</p>
               <p>Another singular event, which somewhat divided the wonder and attention of the neighborhood, and was at least a curious coincidence with the abduction of the infant, was the desertion of the pretty cottage, known as "The Nest." Mrs. Stephenson, though very secluded in her habits, and seldom seen, save at church or in some poor person's cottage, had still excited the admiration and curiosity of the inhabitants in no ordinary degree, by her beauty, gentleness, and extreme and perfect isolation from any apparent ties or friendships. And when a notice suddenly appeared on the gate of "The Nest," that it was "to be let furnished," and it was ascertained that the lady and her maid had vanished as if by magic, without even a hint of their departure, or any more tangible means of removal than a dimly seen carriage and pair, the lamps of which flashed past one or two cottages at midnight, and which was presumed to have conveyed the fugitives from their habitation, why, the whole of the village was engrossed by the news, and the abduction of the infant son of the young officer quite sank into the background in comparison with the fresher wonder of the day. But with the usual fate of such causes of wonderment, this too died away, as a fresh and most touching calamity occurred at "The Rosary."</p>
               <p>The sweet "Nellie" of Captain Morrison's early love—the lovely bride of one short year since—the beautiful and happy mother of a first-born and eagerly welcomed infant, was no more. She had striven bravely to sustain an affliction that her delicate frame and loving heart could so ill endure; but in spite of her husband's tender care, and her own unselfish efforts to bear up for his sake, her strength was unequal to the trial that had befallen her. Thus, in addition to the bitter disappointment which Captain Morrison had suffered in the cruel and uncertain fate of his infant heir, he was now enduring the more heart-rending loss of his young and idolised wife, and within two short months he was a widower, and childless.</p>
               <p>It was a crushing calamity for the young officer, but no one knew, or was permitted to share his grief. Proud, self-sustained, and calm, he met the pity, curiosity, and wondering comments and surmises of his friends and neighbors with the same apparently unmoved composure, and risked, without a single regret, the proffered services, the eager sympathy, and even the good opinion of those who would fain have tried to soothe, cheer, and aid him in his sudden desolation; but had those who stigmatised him as cold, hard, and unfeeling, seen the young officer in his long hours of anguish when alone with his Nellie's miniature, he gave himself up to a grief that only life could end, they would have judged him more kindly and more truly, and confessed that it was the very depth of the wound which made even the softest touch unbearable. But these solitary hours were a mystery to the gossiping neighborhood; and when at length it became known that he had accepted an appointment in India for several years to come, little regret was felt at his departure.</p>
               <p>"The Rosary" was shut up, as "The Nest" had been a few weeks before, and in a few months the story of the sad and mysterious events which had befallen their late tenants became a subject of history rarely alluded to among the inhabitants of the small village and thinly populated neighborhood of its environs.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>IN the pretty village of Athy, county Carlow, there resided a lady, English by birth, Protestant by religion, apparently unconnected with the country of her adoption, neither seeking friends nor made independent of them, but leading one of those quiet, still, unobtrusive lives which often excite more curiosity than the greatest eccentricity of manners and habits. But Mrs. Carlton's abode in Athy had been of such old standing, that this inquisitiveness had now almost expired for want of gratification and nutriment.</p>
               <p>The sole companion—the care and the joy of this lady's life, the only gleam of sunshine in an existence embittered by the memory of many and bitter wrongs and grief, and the chief tie that bound her to life—was now her son, an only and promising child. It was soon after his birth, which had taken place in England, that Mrs. Carlton took up her abode in Ireland with her brother; but at the time when we take up the thread of our story he was twenty-one, and had just returned from Dublin, where his education had been completed. Every advantage that could be obtained for him had been lavished on Gerard Carlton by his devoted mother, and he well repaid, as yet, her care and self-denial.</p>
               <p>Tall, handsome, and high-bred looking, the young man could never have been confounded with the common herd, in whatever position or in whatever garb he might have been seen. There was also a peculiar charm in his frank yet high-bred manner, rarely to be found in one whose life had been so completely secluded from genial and polished society, and which could only be attributed to a natural grace and noble and kindly nature. Hitherto, indeed, his return from school and college for his vacations had been the very sunshine and happiness of his mother's life. His joyous temper seemed to chase away sadness and gloom, and the zest with which he resumed his country sports and pastimes, and the warm affection he manifested to his mother, and the few old friends and neighbors among whom he had grown up, proved that a gay city life had not tarnished or chilled the purity and warmth of his young heart.</p>
               <p>But now, when he had taken a final leave of college and returned home, without any present or definite purpose as to his future life, his mother's anxious eyes detected a great and alarming change in his demeanor and habits. His zest for rustic amusements,<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6520-00000006"/> his bright animation of manner, his buoyant spirits had vanished, and given place to a gradually increasing melancholy, and an apathy and indifference to everything that used to interest him, which fined Mrs. Carlton's heart with apprehension and dismay. She waited, however, long and patiently, before questioning him on the subject, restrained by natural delicacy of feeling, and, it might be, by the terror of hearing, what she most dreaded, that Gerard had obtained some clue to the carefully kept secret of her life.</p>
               <p>As time wore on, and as the symptoms that so alarmed her rather increased than diminished, she could hesitate no longer, but determined to take the first opportunity of questioning him as to the cause of the change in his gay spirits and enthusiastic nature. It was some time, however, ere a chance occurred of leading naturally to the subject, and, as often occurs, it was when least expected or studied that the occasion arose.</p>
               <p>It was a clear and beautiful summer's evening, and Mrs. Carlton, after a long pause in a broken and ill-sustained conversation, proposed a walk. Gerard listlessly assented, and the mother and son were quickly on their way to the banks of the canal. The Dublin passage-boat was just arriving, with a few passengers and much merchandise for the good of the people of Athy, as its freight.</p>
               <p>"Some visitors for Bally Adams are expected to-day I believe," said Mrs. Carlton; "and among them a young lady, a school-friend of Fanny and Norah's, and some companions also of her brothers. It will make Athy rather gayer for you, my dear boy."</p>
               <p>Gerard languidly assented, but his eyes seemed fixed on the approaching boat, and it was doubtful whether he heard his mother's words.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton sighed deeply, and unconsciously clung more closely to the arm she held, as if in sympathy with his evident depression. "My boy, my dear Gerard, why will you not trust me?" she said, softly; but still he seemed too engrossed to comprehend her words. He gazed earnestly at the now rapidly nearing boat, and Mrs. Carlton following his eyes, perceived a young man standing on the deck of the little vessel, looking earnestly on every side in curious observation of the novel scene.</p>
               <p>Gerard involuntarily started, and his fine face flushed crimson, as he hastily turned, and proposed to his mother to retrace their steps.</p>
               <p>"What is it, Gerard?" she asked, anxiously, as soon as they were out of chance of being overheard. "Do you know that young man?"</p>
               <p>Gerard was silent for a few moments; but at length he replied, "I do, mother; and would to Heaven I never had seen him!"</p>
               <p>"You terrify me, my son," she said, gently. "Is it possible that young man is connected with the sad change which I have noticed in you of late?"</p>
               <p>"Hush, dear mother! do not ask me," he said, trying to smile. "I was a fool to say what I did. Forget it; I never meant to vex you with my fancied troubles."</p>
               <p>"They are not fancies, or I much mistake, Gerard," replied his mother, gravely. I have long wished to question you on the cause of your growing melancholy, and I am not to be so easily deceived by a light reply. My son, what has happened that you conceal from your best and most loving friend?—from your mother, who would cheerfully give her life for your happiness, or to shield you from sorrow or pain."</p>
               <p>"I know it, mother,—I know it; but—"</p>
               <p>They were now entering the garden that surrounded their pretty cottage, and Gerard abruptly broke off his sentence. Mrs. Carlton led the way into their usual sitting-room, and then, sitting down by her son on the couch on which he had thrown himself, she said, earnestly, "But what, my son—I insist on an answer, by the duty you owe to me, by the love you feel for me—what can I do to relieve your dejection?"</p>
               <p>"Mother," said the young man, starting up suddenly, "one little word from you would dispel my gloom, and restore me to my former cheerfulness. But can you say that word?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton trembled violently, and her lips almost refused to utter the question that she knew must be spoken, or her son would suspect the worst,—the most dreaded truth.</p>
               <p>"Gerard, what do you mean?" she asked; "what has that young man said which you wish me to contradict? What can you dare to believe which gives you such a strange and deep gloom? Speak, I command you!" she exclaimed, with dignity and determination, for despair had given her strength to meet the long-dreaded hour.</p>
               <p>Gerard grasped the hand she laid on his arm, and bending down to her ear, he whispered, in a hoarse, low voice, "Mother, that young man, Patrick Sullivan, taunted me with being an illegitimate son. He said it was commonly reported that I was never born in lawful wedlock. Is it true? Do not evade the question. I must, I will know the truth! I am of an age when it ought to be told if it be so; and, if not, I will choke the slanderer with his own base calumny. Speak—'yes,' or 'no!'" he exclaimed; and the tone was almost fierce in its determined and suppressed agony.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton's eyes lowered under her son's earnest gaze, and a deep flush came on her cheek, succeeded by as deep and painful a blanched hue.</p>
               <p>"Gerard, my son, spare me,—pardon me!" she said. "You are the child of an unfortunate, a deceived, a weak, but—as I hope for mercy—not a guilty mother!"</p>
               <p>The young man groaned, but he seemed bent on hearing the worst, and draining the bitter cup.</p>
               <p>"And my father?" he said. "Does he yet live?"</p>
               <p>"He does," replied his mother. "He lives in heartless and unfeeling disregard of the victims he has made, and the misery he has caused."</p>
               <p>"And his name?" demanded the young man, sternly.</p>
               <p>"His name shall never pass my lips," replied Mrs. Carlton. "Question me no further," my son, if you love me. While life lasts I will never reveal the secret; but when I am no more, when the grave shall hide me from the rude gaze of a pitiless world, the sad story of my life shall be bequeathed to you as a last legacy from your unhappy mother. Forbear, then, to press me on the subject, for I have vowed never, during my life, to disclose the secret to any human being."</p>
               <p>Thus urged, Gerard remained for a time in gloomy meditation; then a deep sigh, almost a groan, escaped him.</p>
               <p>"Thus," said he, "in the very opening of my life a blight has fallen upon it. The stain of illegitimacy rests on my name, and I dare not resent or contradict the assertion. Oh, mother, mother! it is very hard to bear!"</p>
               <p>"Do I not know it, my son?" said Mrs. Carlton. "Have I not borne the torture for long, long years in silence, uncheered, unsolaced, save by your childish caresses, your boyish love? Shall the only consolation left me be denied in your manhood? Am I not sufficiently punished?"</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, my mother," said Gerard, sadly. "I know, I feel all you say, but you—"</p>
               <p>"Brought the suffering on myself, you would say, my son," she interrupted. "Perhaps you are right; but, Gerard, if it is so, it was from imprudence, and over trust in a villain, that I erred. I was not the base thing I must appear in your eyes. Till the very time of your birth, I believed myself your father's lawful wife; and the first agonising tears of shame and outraged love were shed on your infant cheeks. Now, can you not pardon and pity your mother?"</p>
               <p>The young man's generous heart was painfully touched. He clasped his weeping parent in his arms, and mingled his tears with hers.</p>
               <p>"Mother, do be comforted," said he. "Henceforth we must live doubly for each other. Like you, I will abjure a world that would scorn and taunt my misfortune and yours, and devote myself to comfort and to avenge you."</p>
               <p>"'Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.' Who then shall dare usurp His prerogative?" said a fine, manly voice, and, looking suddenly up, the mother and son saw the venerable form of Mr. Seaforth, the clergyman of Athy, standing before them. He had entered, as was often his custom, unannounced and unperceived by the agitated pair; and now the sight of his benign countenance acted as balm to their wounded hearts.</p>
               <p>"What has happened?" he said; "what new calamity has befallen you, my dear lady? Surely Gerard—"</p>
               <p>"No, dear sir, nothing new, and my son is all that I could venture to hope or wish," replied the lady. "It is but the breaking out of the old deep wound, and the sight of my poor boy's suffering."</p>
               <p>"What! in spite of your vow, have you related your sad tale to your son?" said Mr. Seaforth.</p>
               <p>"No," said Mrs. Carlton; "I have but replied to the question he had a right to ask, by telling as much of the truth as it was necessary he should know. I have told him that I was deceived by a false marriage, and knew not of the fraud till after his birth."</p>
               <p>"It is well," said the good clergyman. "Keep your resolution, my dear madam, and you, Gerard, restrain your natural curiosity, and neither inquire into the details of your mother's sad story, nor ask the name of him who so grossly wronged her and you."</p>
               <p>It may be inferred that Mrs. Carlton had confided to the kind clergyman the full particulars of her eventful life, but that was not the case. She had merely related to him the brief facts of which she had just apprised her son, and the good man had never sought to know more than she had freely chosen to narrate to him.</p>
               <p>Oppressed and <choice>
                     <sic>exahusted</sic>
                     <corr>exhausted</corr>
                  </choice> by her sorrow and agitation, Mrs. Carlton now retired to the solitude of her own apartment, and accordingly Mr. Seaforth was left alone with her son. The good clergyman then drew near to the disconsolate and gloomy young man, and took his hand.</p>
               <p>"My young friend," he began, kindly, "are you not indulging a selfish and unchristian grief? Ought you not to-forget your own sorrow in that of your excellent and devoted mother, whose suffering has been so long and nobly borne? Think of her poignant grief at finding herself deserted by the man she had loved and trusted, and left with you to struggle with a cold and uncharitable world."</p>
               <p>"True, sir, true," replied the young man. "Heaven knows I feel for my poor mother all that a son can feel for a parent he loves dearly; but remember that my life is now blighted, disgraced, in the very outset; and that my every motive for exertion is now gone. Surely I may be allowed to feel my lot, as one of no ordinary bitterness."</p>
               <p>"My boy, take care," said the clergyman; "mistake not wounded pride for genuine sorrow. Your duty is plain, and the rest you must leave to Him who can bring the truth to light, and guide the path of those<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6520-00000007"/> who put their trust in Him. It is for you to love, cherish, and support the mother who has devoted her life to you. The taunts of the thoughtless and the unfeeling can be no plea for your neglect of this simple duty; they will, on the contrary, fall unheeded and harmless if you bravely meet the trials and the duties God has assigned to you—to be a comfort to that parent who stands so much in need of comfort."</p>
               <p>Gerard's ingenuous face flushed crimson at the gently spoken but firm rebuke.</p>
               <p>"I believe you are right, sir, though I may perhaps be pardoned for having indulged in what you call a selfish sorrow," he replied. "But my mother's explanation has changed the whole current of my thoughts from mere personal regrets into sorrow for her, and deep resentment against the author of her wrongs and my blighted life. Would that I knew his name. Do you think, sir, that you could persuade my mother to confide that secret to me?"</p>
               <p>"No, Gerard. I do not." replied the clergyman; "and what is more. I would not attempt it. She has wisely resolved to preserve till her death the silence she has maintained so long; and I am convinced that this determination is the kindest and safest that she could adopt. Wait patiently till she is out of the reach of sorrow or shame, and till your own judgment and feelings are matured and softened by time, and then you will be both more free and more fit to act, as may appear right and wise."</p>
               <p>"Long may it be before the knowledge comes to me, if it is to be obtained only at my dear mother's death," said the young man, fervently. "But do not mistake me, dear sir. It is not from an idle curiosity, nor even a just resentment, that I am so anxious to learn this wretched fact. It may be that I shall meet this destroyer of my mother's peace, nay, become intimate with him; perhaps, in the struggling life that is before me, receive some favor from him. The very idea is maddening! I would rather shut myself up from every human being than incur such humiliation, such—"</p>
               <p>"Hush, hush! foolish boy," said the clergyman, with a sad smile; "you little know the crowded arena in which you will have to battle with your fellows, if you think such a slender chance worth one serious thought. It is more than improbable that you will ever meet your father; still more so, that you will ever have favors offered, or forced upon you from any one. No, my boy, it will be on your own exertions that you must depend; but still, never from motives of false pride despise the patronage of the great and powerful. You will need all the energy you can command, to win your way upwards to the steep eminence of fame or fortune. Depend, I again say, on yourself; but do not, in your progress through the world, push away any stepping-stones from beneath your feet."</p>
               <p>"I will not forget your counsels, my dear sir," said the young man, gratefully pressing the hand of his venerable friend; but still, even you must admit that the very smallest risk of my meeting, or being in any way connected with, or indebted to the scoundrel, who—"</p>
               <p>"Is your father," interrupted the clergyman, gravely. "Gerard, your rash impetuosity more than justifies the prudence of your mother's conduct. You cannot even think of the author of your being with the respect or forbearance that even a sinful parent demands from a child; what then would be the consequence of your meeting and recognising him? A quarrel too fearful for me to contemplate without a shudder."</p>
               <p>"Still," said the young man, "you cannot alter my conviction that far more wretched consequences may arise from the ignorance in which I am to go out into the world. Far more singular chances have occurred than that which I dread."</p>
               <p>"My dear boy," said Mr. Seaforth, "it would be next to a miracle. It is unknown to both of us in what country even the misguided man resides, or in what station he is placed. You have the world before you. Is it likely you should come in contact with this particular individual, out of the thousands, nay, millions, among whom you will be indiscriminately thrown in this wide empire?"</p>
               <p>"It is enough for me that it is possible," said Gerard, sighing; "but I must perforce submit to my mother's decision, and your wise and kind advice."</p>
               <p>Gerard smiled, sadly, but gratefully, as his friend bade him adieu; but when the door closed behind him he sank on a chair, and covered his face with his hands.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mabel, Mabel!—lost to me for ever! Mother!—my poor, poor mother! you must never know the full extent of the misery you have brought on your unhappy son."</p>
               <p>It was long before Gerard Carlton slept that night; perhaps for the first time in his life he knew the wretched desolation of the restless, weary, waking hours of the tedious, interminable night, which so many an aching heart has suffered, and will suffer again.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>THE only family in the neighborhood <choice>
                     <sic>with with</sic>
                     <corr>with</corr>
                  </choice> whom Mrs. Carlton was on intimate, or rather on visiting terms, was that of her landlord, Mr. Adams, a gentleman farmer, residing about three miles from Athy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams, of Bally Adams, had been in the habit of frequently inviting Mrs. Carlton and her son to spend a day or two at his house, but of late such invitations had been more rare, from some, as yet, unexplained cause, and that lady was therefore not a little surprised on the morning after the conversation related with her son, to receive a note, requesting her own and her son's company at dinner on the following Monday. It will be readily supposed that neither Mrs. Carlton nor Gerard was very desirous of accepting the invitation in their present state of mind; but the fear of giving offence to their very touchy acquaintance prevailed over inclination, and a reluctant acceptance was dispatched by the bearer of the note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams was a widower, with two sons and two daughters. The former were fine-looking young men; the latter, if not boasting any unusual amount of beauty, were good tempered, pretty, agreeable girls, and consequently very popular in their circle. A great deal of hospitality and a great deal of pride were the leading characteristics of the widower; but unfortunately the hospitality was considerably marred by an air of condescension that deprived it of much of its charm in the eyes of those who received it; while the pride was almost ludicrously mingled with an uneasy consciousness that there was no possible ground for this assumption of superiority over his neighbors.</p>
               <p>In truth, Adams was a man of low origin, having been at one time bailiff to an Irish nobleman, in whose service he had amassed his property, and had first become acquainted with the woman whom he afterwards made his wife, and who filled the situation of dairymaid to his noble patron. Soon after his marriage he became the proprietor of the farm of Bally Adams, where he continued to prosper in all his undertakings.</p>
               <p>Bally Adams was situated beneath a lofty hill, on the summit of which was visible, for miles round, a ruined tower. Behind the hill was a small chapel, capable of containing about one-third of the congregation who resorted to it, leaving the remainder to kneel on the outside, and there gain what instruction they could.</p>
               <p>Spacious fields surrounded the dwelling of Mr. Adams, and everything about the domain bore the aspect of plenty and prosperity. William, the eldest son, assisted his father in the superintendence of the property, and the second son, Edward, was intended for the law; but shooting and hunting were at present the most successful, as well as favorite pursuits of both young men.</p>
               <p>The two daughters, Fanny and Norah were, in their father's partial eyes, absolute perfection in person and mind; beautiful, docile, and most attentive to his every wish. Indeed, his only complaint against these vaunted daughters was one in which his hearers could seldom support him, namely, that they declined sitting up till past midnight to hear his prolix stories and garrulous talk, and then be up at four in the morning to attend to the dairy, and prepare his breakfast by six, his usual hour in Winter as in Summer.</p>
               <p>On the day of the grand dinner party to which Mrs. Carlton and her son had been invited, the worthy host made a prosperous journey to Carlow, where he had disposed of some cattle at a rate far exceeding his utmost expectations. He therefore returned home in a most amiable and joyous state of mind, only just in time to make the very brief toilette that he deemed necessary on these occasions, before the car containing Gerard Carlton and his mother drove up to the door.</p>
               <p>True to the old-fashioned, hospitable customs of his youth, Mr. Adams would have deemed it a sad breach of good manners and a deficiency in his duties as a cordial host, if he had not received each and all of his guests at the very threshold of his house, in order to bid them welcome to Bally Adams. The first sound of wheels, therefore, brought him in great haste to the hall, where he arrived just in time to assist Mrs. Carlton in alighting from the vehicle, with his usual boisterous welcome.</p>
               <p>"Happy to see you, my good lady—always welcome to Bally Adams. Why, you are quite a stranger lately. Come in. Fanny, Norah, William, where are you all? Why, here is Mrs. Carlton, and none of you ready to welcome her. Never mind: we are truly happy to see you, my good friend; and you too Master Gerard. Hope you are quite well. There, walk in, walk in; you will find my two jewels ready to welcome you in the drawing-room."</p>
               <p>This assertion, as it happened, was scarcely justified, since the two jewels (Miss Fanny and Miss Norah Adams) had not yet completed their toilette, and the drawing-room was vacant.</p>
               <p>"Well, Master Gerard," he said, after handing Mrs. Carlton a chair, "left the University, eh? Taken your degree—ready for the church or the law, which? Why, you and my Ned had better be articled together; there's a vacancy in Mr. Bolton's office."</p>
               <p>Before the young man could suggest that he had no intention of going into the law, the door opened and the young ladies entered, apologising for their delay, though the truth was they had not expected their visitors for at least another half-hour.</p>
               <p>"Where's Miss May, eh, girls?" said the fussy and ever active Mr. Adams, "Like all of you, I suppose, she takes such a time to set off her pretty face, though I can't complain much of you, my—"</p>
               <p>Miss Fanny Adams perhaps was the only one of the party who perceived Gerard Carlton's slight start and change of color at the name pronounced by his talkative host; but before she could decide whether the emotion was owing to her own extended hand and blushing smile of welcome, or to a less<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6520-00000008"/> flattering and welcome cause, another peal at the hall bell announced the arrival of more visitors, and produced the usual commotion which Mr. Adams deemed a necessary part of the duties of hospitality.</p>
               <p>Once more did the vociferous welcomes of the host resound to the recesses of the drawing-room long before the door opened, and Captain and Mrs. Balfour were ushered into the apartment. These guests were neither frequent nor very congenial visitors at Bally Adams, for the "gallant officer" now in command of a regiment stationed in Athy, was not only a man of great importance in his own estimation, but a most consummate coxcomb into the bargain, and by no means a man of Adams's stamp or taste. But the worthy farmer deemed it good policy to make friends with the gallant commander, not knowing how soon there might be a necessity for his services, or rather those of the men under his command, for at that time there were many suspicious persons and lawless proceedings secretly going on in the neighborhood, which might need a yet stronger arm than that of the law to repress.</p>
               <p>"A wise and profound respect for the "powers that be" was perhaps the moving cause for his invitation to another very important though scarcely more attractive personage, Andrew Guildford, Esq., justice of the peace, and lord of the manor of Garron's Hill—a magistrate whose activity certainly commanded fear, if not respect, in the neighborhood.</p>
               <p>This magnate of Athy next arrived and received the usual greeting from the apparently obsequious and admiring Adams, as he bowed him into the drawing-room. Mr. Guildford was about five-and-thirty or forty years of age, tall, and spare in make, and with naturally well-marked, though somewhat strong features; but though there was a certain air of command and dignity in his powerful frame and stern, fine face, the effect was strangely marred by one peculiarity, which was even remarked by the most casual observers, and those least intimately acquainted with him—this was an inveterate habit of never looking persons in the face when conversing with them. His keen deep-set eyes were ever hidden under his large eyelids and thick eyebrows, while speaking and listening; and it was only when he believed himself unobserved that his eyes were raised, and a quick, searching, penetrating look cast on those whom he wished to scan. The remainder of the party consisted of a Mr., Mrs., and the Misses O'Donoghue, a Mr. Haggarty, a bachelor, while there still lacked the arrival of a Sir Henry Purcell, an expectant member, now canvassing the county for his return, and whose delay excited the most agonizing and nervous anxiety in his fidgety host. Poor Adams divided his attention between occasional visits to the hall door, to listen in vain for the sound of wheels that should announce the guest of the evening, and equally anxious, through whispered request of each of his visitors in turn, that they would avoid any subjects that might lead to discussing the differences between Romanists and Protestants during dinner, and especially refrain from any religious disputes whatever.</p>
               <p>"I was not aware till now that Sir Henry was in the neighborhood," observed Captain Balfour; as I am rather surprised I should not have been apprised of the circumstance."</p>
               <p>"Oh, he was with me yesterday," observed Adams pompously; "he came to solicit my vote and interest, which I could see he thought very important for his election. He will be returned for the county, of course?"</p>
               <p>"I am not so sure of that," said Balfour, "because—"</p>
               <p>But the "why and wherefore" of the self-sufficient commander was doomed to remain a mystery, for at that moment the bell rang a loud peal, and the host outdid his former self in the haste and noise of his reception of the most honored among his guests.</p>
               <p>The ceremony of introduction to the visitors who had not yet had the honor of being acquainted with the baronet, was an elaborate and somewhat tumultuous affair, and under its cover a new member of the party glided in unnoticed, and even unseen, save by one, and that one was Gerard Carlton.</p>
               <p>It was nevertheless, a vision fair enough to attract notice from a far more distinguished assembly, and assuredly one that might well excite the emotion visible in the young man's speaking face, without any deeper cause than natural surprise and admiration at the appearance of the beautiful stranger.</p>
               <p>The new comer was a girl of about twenty Summers, so far as could be guessed on a casual observation, though there might be wide difference of opinion on that delicate point. But the extreme fairness of her transparent complexion, and the sweet, innocent, girlish purity of her expression, gave an appearance of even greater youth; while yet there was a gentle dignity and thought-fulness in her large grey eyes, and the carriage of her small head, that spoke of unusual maturity of character, and more knowledge of the world than could be consistent with fewer years than we have assigned to her. She was tall, and extremely graceful, and her dress, though simple, was well made and in good taste, and a marked difference existed between its indefinable air of simple elegance, and the more dashing and showy toilettes of the Bally Adam belles. Such was the fair creature who quietly entered the drawing-room, under cover of the confusion caused by the entrance of the baronet, and who evidently formed a part of the family circle, from the perfect familiarity and ease with which she took her way to a corner of the room, and taking a seat by a little table, where some apology for ladies' work was lying ing, began to occupy herself with the dainty silks and wools.</p>
               <p>Gerard Carlton's eyes followed her as she walked across the room, and he apparently hesitated whether he should follow her, or remain by the side of the smiling and radiant Fanny. Twice he seemed about to move his position as the girl's attention was claimed by some other visitor, and as often he relinquished his purpose; but at length the approach of Captain Balfour to the young lady's side gave irresistible opportunity to leave her for her fairer and less demonstrative friend. He walked hastily to the corner where the beautiful stranger sat, as if distrusting his own firmness of purpose.</p>
               <p>"I hardly expected this pleasure, Miss May; when did you arrive in our wild neighborhood?" The words were studiously indifferent, and yet they betrayed agitation in the constrained tone in which they were spoken.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Carlton! is it possible?" she said, starting. "I did not know, I did not expect—"</p>
               <p>"You knew my home was in this neighborhood, Miss May, but not that I knew your host," replied Gerard, gathering courage from her <choice>
                     <sic>embarassment</sic>
                     <corr>embarrassment</corr>
                  </choice>. "Nor did I suppose you could possibly be acquainted with our eccentric host, or I might have spoken of him when I knew you in Dublin."</p>
               <p>"I was not acquainted with him," she replied; "but my old schoolfellow Fanny found out that I was visiting my aunt in Dublin, and wrote to press my coming here for a little time. And as my father will not be at home again for a few weeks, till he has finished some business in America, I preferred spending the interval in the country, to remaining in Dublin."</p>
               <p>Mabel May seemed anxious to prevent any possible suspicion that she could have been influenced, in her determination, by any idea of her companion's residence in Athy, and Gerard felt she did so, and his manner became even colder than before.</p>
               <p>"I hope you will be repaid for giving up the gaieties of Dublin, Miss May—but—I—"</p>
               <p>He stopped, though a glance at Adams, who was at that moment presenting his sons to Sir Henry, and telling forth their excellencies much in the style of an auctioneer, supplied any further explanation of his meaning.</p>
               <p>"Is your mother here, Mr. Carlton?" said the young girl, as if wishing to change the subject. "I think you told me she seldom goes into society."</p>
               <p>"Nor does she," he replied; "this is almost the only house where she visits, and that chiefly because Mr. Adams is our landlord. That lady, speaking to Miss Norah Adams, is my mother."</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams's voice now broke in on the colloquy.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Carlton," said he, "will you take Miss O'Donoghue in to dinner; and William,—no, Edward, give Miss Mabel your arm,—there, now, we are all matched," he added, leading the way with Mrs. Balfour to the old-fashioned dining-room at a speed totally unlike the stately pace of courtly circles.</p>
               <p>The dinner was as little in accordance with modern usages as the host who presided over it. Soup, fish, a round of beef, an immense capon, and a boiled leg of mutton, were all placed on the table at once, while the servants, unaccustomed to so large and distinguished a party, ran about in utter confusion, without any one of them exactly knowing what he intended to do, or which of the guests he was to serve. Meanwhile, Mr. Adams carved and talked, and scattered bits of conversation in admirable confusion, without waiting for, or apparently expecting a reply.</p>
               <p>"Miss May, allow me to take wine with you," said William Adams.</p>
               <p>Mabel leaned forward to return the young man's not ungrateful bow, and in so doing caught Mrs. Carlton's eye for the first time, that lady being seated at the same side of the table with herself. There was a moment's pause in the buzz of voices and the confusion of hurrying domestics, and Sir Henry, whose eyes were also directed towards the beautiful stranger, was about to inquire her name of his young hostess, when a faint, half-suppressed cry from Mrs. Carlton, and an exclamation of alarm from Mabel May, attracted the attention of the whole table. The next moment Mrs. Carlton had sunk back senseless on her chair, and would have fallen to the ground, but for the prompt assistance of Mr. Haggarty, who sat next to her.</p>
               <p>A scene of general consternation ensued. Gerard Carlton rushed to his mother's side; the Misses Adams were equally prompt in offering their services; while the host surpassed himself in the rapidity, noise, and confusion of his orders, of which the most rational was the only one carried out, namely, that the sufferer should be instantly removed to the drawing-room. Gerard carried his mother's still insensible form in his arms to a couch in the cooler and quieter apartment, where, with Norah Adams's assistance, he soon succeeded in restoring her to consciousness.</p>
               <p>"It was the heat, the bustle," said Mrs. Carlton, faintly, the moment she could speak.</p>
               <p>"I was not quite well—that was all. I am sorry to have given you so much trouble, Miss Adams."</p>
               <p>The tone and look were hurried and nervous, and Gerard, at any rate, was not deceived by the eager excuses his mother gave for her sudden attack.</p>
               <p>"You had better keep quiet, my dear madam," said Norah, "and presently you will be able to join us in the dining-room; or may I send you something here?"</p>
               <p>"No, no—I must go home at once," said<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6520-00000009"/> the lady, hurriedly. "Gerard, my dear, order the car; and you, Miss Adams, pray do not stay any longer. I am so sorry. You will make my excuses to your father, only I—I cannot—it was too warm—that was all."</p>
               <p>Norah looked doubtfully at Gerard Carlton. Mrs. Carlton's words were so incoherent and nervous, that even the inexperienced young girl felt that there must be still some serious derangement of body or mind, which made the projected return home a dangerous attempt.</p>
               <p>"You had better not go yet, my dear Mrs. Carlton," she said, kindly. "You can go into my room and lie down for an hour or two, without being disturbed by any one. I would beg you to stay all night, only, Miss May occupies our spare room just now."</p>
               <p>"Who—who did you say?" asked Mrs. Carlton, sharply.</p>
               <p>"Miss May—Mabel May. She is an old schoolfellow of Fanny's, the young lady who sat near you at dinner on the same side of the table," was the somewhat astonished reply.</p>
               <p>"Is that her name? are you sure?" asked Mrs. Carlton, in a somewhat more quiet tone, but with the same wild, eager look that her eyes had worn ever since her return to <unclear>consciousness</unclear>.</p>
               <p>"Sure!" repeated Norah, exchanging a glance of alarm with Gerard. "My dear Mrs. Carlton, what can you mean? Of course I am sure. Why should you doubt it?"</p>
               <p>"I am dreaming, I believe," said the poor lady, with an effort at a smile, "I hardly knew what I was saying, but I am better now—quite well; only I had better not risk giving you so much trouble again. Pray go back to the dining-room, my dear Norah, and as soon as the car is ready we will go."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton really did appear so much more composed that Norah did not hesitate to comply, especially as Gerard seconded his mother's entreaties; and with a hope that the indisposition would pass off with a few hours' rest, the young girl left the room. Meanwhile, the party in the dining-room had been almost equally engrossed by the sudden and untoward occurrence.</p>
               <p>"Did I understand," asked Sir Henry, "that the name of the lady who fainted was Carlton?"</p>
               <p>"Troth, and it is, my dear Sir Henry," said Adams; "and I must have been very remiss not to have introduced her to you. She is an old tenant of mine at Athy, and a very excellent woman, I assure you."</p>
               <p>"I hope she will be well enough for me to see her before I leave you this evening," returned the baronet, "for I had intended to find her out this very day, if particular business had not prevented it."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you don't say so!" said Adams, whose naturally curious disposition was especially keen where such a distinguished guest was concerned. "Why, did you know her in England, Sir Henry?"</p>
               <p>"I wish to see her in Ireland," replied the baronet, with a quiet dignity that would have silenced any one but the impenetrable Adams.</p>
               <p>"Oh, indeed!" he returned. "Well, we know nothing of her here, except that she is a tenant of mine, and her son sometimes comes over to see my boys; but perhaps you can tell us something more about her connections, Sir Henry. She has never had any visitors that I remember, since she came to Ireland twenty years ago."</p>
               <p>"I had the pleasure of knowing some near relatives of hers in India," said Sir Henry, coldly. "Shall I have the pleasure of taking wine with you, Mrs. O'Donoghue?"</p>
               <p>The tone was too decided to admit of further questions even from the case-hardened host, and the subject dropped; but a damp had fallen on the spirits of the company that was not easily shaken off. Mrs. Carlton's swoon, and the general astonishment as to Sir Henry's previous knowledge of or business with the quiet recluse, acted like a dead weight on the tongues, if not appetites of the party, and Adams was in a perfect fever of annoyance at the funereal character the feast had assumed.</p>
               <p>Captain Balfour was unusually silent in the presence of the baronet, before whom he shrank into his natural insignificance. Mr. Haggarty never was loquacious; while the justice of the peace, Andrew Guildford, Esq., appeared as gloomy and morose as if deciding on the fate of a gang of poachers on his own manor. Fanny Adams, who was usually the life of her father's somewhat incongruous gatherings, was absent and silent, her eyes often wandering to the door through which Gerard Carlton and her sister might be reasonably expected to return; and Mabel May did not bestow much more connected replies to the casual remarks of her next neighbor, the heir of Bally Adams. The rest of the party were equally dissatisfied at the complete absence of any attention or notice from those they most wished to attract; and the entrance of a really elegant and tempting second course was a relief to all parties.</p>
               <p>The guests appeared to recover some degree of good humor and animation as the delicacies disappeared under their auspices; and Sir Henry, endeavoring to get some more general conversation, inquired as to the state of the country, and how far it was affected by the disturbances caused by the disputes between the Orangemen and Catholics.</p>
               <p>Adams gave a significant "hem!" and inwardly regretted that Sir Henry's late arrival had prevented his being able to caution him as to the tabooed subjects of conversation.</p>
               <p>"Pray, Sir Henry," interrupted Mr. Hag garty, opportunely coming to the rescue, "had you any good hunting in England last season?"</p>
               <p>Adams brightened up, and without waiting for Sir Henry's reply, plunged at once into long fox-hunting stories of his younger days, which he had retailed at every dinner in the county for the last twenty years; while Sir Henry perceiving he had unwittingly started a dangerous topic, good-humoredly fell into his host's humor, and descanted on the exploits of hounds and huntsmen as familiarly as he would have done on the profound topics of politics or religion.</p>
               <p>Adams, now fairly on his hobby, was too much engrossed to even perceive the entrance of his youngest daughter, who quietly approached her sister, and whispered something in a low voice; but not so inaudibly but that a word or two caught the cars of Mabel May, and apparently also attracted Sir Henry's attention, for that gentleman at once inquired of Norah as to the condition of the invalid.</p>
               <p>"She is much better," replied Norah, "but still very weak and nervous, and she has insisted on leaving at once with her son."</p>
               <p>"Gone!" exclaimed the baronet; "I am extremely sorry. I wish I could have seen her before she went, if only for a moment."</p>
               <p>"Do you indeed, Sir Henry?" exclaimed the obliging host; "then they shall return at once. William, my boy, send after the car immediately."</p>
               <p>"By no means," said Sir Henry. "Tomorrow will do quite as well, and I hope Mrs. Carlton will then be well enough to receive me. It is not of the slightest consequence."</p>
               <p>"Norah, my girl, you were very foolish to let her go away," said Adams; "why, she had not half dined, never tasted my prime mutton, equal to venison, except in the pleasure of hunting it; eh, Sir Henry?"</p>
               <p>"Dear me, what a fuss about this Mrs. Carlton," said one of the Miss O'Donoghues to Mabel May, as they followed their young hostess to the drawing-room, a few minutes afterwards. "I wonder who she is?—a mere nobody, I'm sure. Only think of her dress! why, it must have been made a dozen years at least."</p>
               <p>"She is a very charming, sweet-looking woman, I thought," said Mabel, coldly; "and must have been most beautiful in her youth."</p>
               <p>"Well, the son is not bad looking, only he seems rather dull, not a bit of life in him," said the young lady. "They're no great loss anyhow."</p>
               <p>Mabel May did not reply, but managed to secure a seat between Mrs. O'Donoghue and Mrs. Balfour, tolerably certain that such a position would ensure her quiet, and immunity from remarks which she could neither resent nor yet endure with patience.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the gentlemen had not got on much more prosperously under the influence of the whisky-punch and the unrestraint of the ladies' withdrawal. Adams at length came to the end of his hunting anecdotes, and William, knowing his father's horror of the awful pauses that too commonly occurred at their ill-managed table, turned to Captain Balfour, and inquired how he had succeeded in the late disturbance at Castle Comer.</p>
               <p>Balfour eagerly seized an opportunity for distinguishing himself in a subject where he would necessarily play a prominent part, and was about to reply in a most elaborate and Jesuitical manner, when luckily the door opened, and the servant appeared with a summons to coffee.</p>
               <p>Adams, who had cast an angry glance at William for his unlucky question, inquired eagerly if Sir Henry would take any more wine or toddy, and on receiving a reply in the negative, at once proposed to join the ladies. In spite of his host's remonstrances, Balfour rang the bell for his car; but the other gentlemen followed Mr. Adams to the drawing-room, and a faint attempt at conversation, and a song or two to which no one listened, concluded the tedious evening. Mabel May stole away to her own room to think, and weep, and dream of past hopes, and present disappointments; but the remainder of the family sat up till an unusually late hour, Mrs. Carlton, her mysterious connection with Sir Henry, and the conduct and appearance of their other guests, forming topics of conversation till long after midnight.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>ON the morning after the visit to Bally Adams Mrs. Carlton was surprised by the announcement that Sir Henry Purcell was in her little drawing-room, and desired an interview with her. Her nerves were so weakened by the sorrow and repeated shocks she had undergone, that the idea of seeing a stranger, and on private business, was enough to throw her into a fit of trembling alarm, though soothed by the remembrance that Gerard was fortunately from home and that she would therefore be spared any questions that he might naturally ask as to the nature of the business which brought Sir Henry to Athy. Mrs. Carlton was herself not a little astonished at the baronet's kind condescension in calling on one so afflicted and so secluded; and with this feeling, and the memory of her misfortunes fresh on her mind, she descended to the drawing-room, where her visitor was awaiting her.</p>
               <p>When Gerard Carlton returned home an hour or two after, he found his mother alone earnestly perusing a letter which he learnt from the servant a gentleman delivered with his own hands.</p>
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6520-00000010"/>
               <p>"Strange, thought Carlton, "if it was Sir Henry Purcell. What can he have to do with my mother?—and why was she so affected at seeing Mabel May at dinner yesterday? I am sure it was that which caused her fainting fit; and yet she can never have seen her before. All is a mystery, and so must it remain. The letter, too!—is that from my father? Is it possible he can intend to do her justice at this tardy period? Alas, alas! that all this secresy between mother and son should be necessary! When will it end?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton did not in any degree relieve her son's natural anxiety, but quickly passed over Sir Harry's visit without further notice.</p>
               <p>Nothing of any moment occurred for many days. Gerard Carlton employed himself, or rather tried to employ himself, in pursuing the studies which he still continued under Mr. Seaforth's kind superintendence; but his mind too often wandered from the books before him, and many a time he roused himself from a fit of deep and involuntary thought, far from the supposed subject of his studies. A fair, sweet face would rise between him and the book before him, and a soft, ringing voice sound in his ears, even while Mr. Seaforth was learnedly descanting on Euclid, Virgil, or Bacon.</p>
               <p>Still, the young man's resolution faltered not, and though many an evening hour saw him strolling thoughtfully through the fields and wood in the direction of Bally Adams, and though his eyes would wander to the Bally Adams pew during Mr. Seaforth's most eloquent sermons, yet he had not even paid his usually frequent visits to the house since the memorable dinner party, and when by chance he encountered the family on leaving church the Sunday after, he confined his greeting to a distant bow to Mabel May, and a brief exchange of courtesies with the other members of the party. But a deeper gloom was on his open face as he took his way home after that casual meeting.</p>
               <p>Mabel's deep gray eyes gave a brief flash of proud displeasure as she returned his bow with an inclination of the head yet colder and more stately than his own. Gerard saw and interpreted it aright, though his conscience told him he was more deserving of sympathy and praise than of blame; the knowledge that he was misunderstood, censured, perhaps despised by the woman for whose sake he was enduring the bitterest and hardest self-denial, was another drop of gall in his cup of sorrow.</p>
               <p>Thus passed a fortnight, or perhaps even longer, after the dinner party at Bally Adams.</p>
               <p>It was impossible for Gerard's deep dejection and altered looks to escape the observation of a mother whose very life was bound up in his, and Mrs. Carlton passed many an anxious hour in considering plans for the present and future happiness of her son, and atoning to him, as far as human energy could do, for the imprudence of which his parents had been guilty.</p>
               <p>"Gerard, my dear boy," she said, one day, after watching for some time in silence the unconscious abstraction of his look and attitude, as he bent over a book he was not reading, "you are shutting yourself up too closely with your mother and your books. It is not good at your age, though it matters not for me."</p>
               <p>"My dear mother, I am quite well, and I prefer being quiet," he replied: "there is little to cheer or benefit one in our neighborhood; even—"</p>
               <p>"Even if you were in a mood to seek it," interrupted Mrs. Carlton. "Perhaps you are right, and I am planning a complete change of scene and occupation for you, my dear boy, as soon as I can make the necessary arrangements. But, meanwhile, it will not do for you to yield yourself up to despondency and the dislike of society, which is both natural and harmless for me. You have not been to Bally Adams since we dined there, and it must seem rather uncourteous and ungrateful to our friends not to acknowledge their kindness by even a call. Why not go this afternoon?"</p>
               <p>"I don't suppose they think or care about us," said Gerard, with a deep flush; "besides, you know they still have visitors with them."</p>
               <p>A look of pain came into Mrs. Carlton's face for a moment, and Gerard regretted that he had recalled the memory of a circumstance which had appeared to affect his mother so strangely at the moment.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, my dear mother," he said; "I forgot, I did not mean—"</p>
               <p>"You could not mean what it was impossible for you to comprehend, my dear boy," she said gently. "You saw, doubtless, that the sight of the young lady staying at Bally Adams strangely affected me. It was her singular likeness to one I formerly knew and loved that thus agitated me, and, for the moment I forgot that it was almost an impossibility that the likeness could be anything but an accidental one. But that is past, and has nothing to do with our obligations to our friends. I do wish you to go, Gerard, and take from me a message of inquiry and thanks for their attention. Besides, I premised Fanny Adams a slip of the Burgundy rose tree she admired so much. You can take that, if you want an excuse for your visit."</p>
               <p>Poor Gerard!—it was a painful yet pleasant necessity for a visit he longed yet dreaded to make, and after a few more faint excuses he complied with his mother's request and set off on his expedition, just as the sun was beginning to decline in the horizon, and the heat of day gradually subsiding into the refreshing coolness of evening. He walked slowly through the wood and rich fields that led to Bally Adams, his thoughts full of Mabel May, of wondering surmises as to her reception of him, and yet more painful doubts and resolves as to his own manner towards her. How could he meet her with the distant coldness which must seem almost an insult after the happy past: and yet, honor, self-respect, and love itself forbade his attempting to draw one so lovely and so courted into the faintest shadow of an engagement with an obscure, nameless unfortunate like himself. Better present suffering, better her undeserved scorn and censure, than future self-reproach, and Mabel's certain misery.</p>
               <p>Such were the sad and moody thoughts that occupied Gerard Carlton's mind and delayed his progress to his destination, and it was a relief to him to find on his arrival the master of Bally Adams alone, and, as usual, in a state of fussy activity, scolding his servants, hallooing to his dogs, and giving a dozen orders in a breath.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Master Gerard!" he exclaimed, on seeing his young visitor, "come in, come in; you are welcome; you will find the girls somewhere; but as to the lads, I can give you no tidings of them. How is your mother? Zounds! I was afraid that Sir Henry had frightened her to death; and, by the way did he call on her?"</p>
               <p>"I believe so," replied Gerard:</p>
               <p>"Well, what was it he wanted, eh?" inquired Adams. "No fear, you know, with me; I am the one to trust with a secret."</p>
               <p>"I was not at home, sir, when a gentleman, who I imagine was Sir Henry, called," replied Gerard; "and as my mother never referred to it, I presume the interview was strictly private. I can give you no information whatever as to its nature."</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed," said Adams, "and you really don't mean your mother did not tell you all about it when you returned?"</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Mr. Adams, I seldom say what I do not mean," replied Gerard, <choice>
                     <sic>stifly</sic>
                     <corr>stiffly</corr>
                  </choice>.</p>
               <p>"Oh, indeed; well, no offence," said Adams. "Very mysterious, that's all I can say. Here, James," he shouted to a servant passing at the moment. "where are the young ladies?"</p>
               <p>"In the garden, sir," replied the servant; "I saw them there a few minutes ago."</p>
               <p>"Well, you had better go and find them, Master Gerard," said Adams; "and, hark ye get your gun ready, and join us at Bally Adams on the first of September. I will promise you plenty of sport."</p>
               <p>Gerard thanked Mr. Adams, accepted the invitation, and then went in search of the ladies in the shrubbery. The sight of a well-known, graceful form, somewhat apart from her pretty but less high-bred companions, made his heart beat high, and for a moment he felt tempted to avail himself of the opportunity for a few precious moments alone with that cherished idol of his young heart. He made a few quick steps towards the spot where her white dress gleamed through the trees, but, luckily for his firmness of purpose, at the very moment that he arrived at the turn of the path where she was walking. Mabel turned down a short, cross alley, which led to the broad shrubbery path, in obedience to a call from Norah, and the dangerously tempting opportunity passed away.</p>
               <p>Gerard paused a moment; then, suppressing a pang of disappointment that he half despised himself for feeling, he walked rapidly towards the well-known arbor, where he guessed the girls were to be found. Fanny Adams looked up with a blush and smile, which made her really attractive for the moment, while Norah gaily reproached him for his long absence; but Mabel merely bowed in reply to his greeting, and went on arranging a bouquet of flowers, which she held in her hand, without taking any further notice of his presence.</p>
               <p>"Oh look, Fanny!" exclaimed Norah; "Mr. Carlton has brought you a slip of your favorite rose tree! What a model of thoughtful attention he is! Why, you only happened to say you admired it, and lo! he hastens here with it, like the good genius in a fairy tale. I wish you would teach our brothers some of your charming attentions to our fancies, Mr. Carlton."</p>
               <p>Thus complimented, Gerard could only present the slip to Fanny, with a rather confused allusion to his mother's share in the attention to the young lady's wishes, which only made the trifling gift more suspicious in its nature. Fanny timidly received the beautiful branch, laden with the lovely blossoms, nearly the last of the season, and rather looked than spoke her thanks.</p>
               <p>"Will you have one of these beautiful roses for your bouquet, Mabel?" she said, plucking a delicate, half-blown bud from the slip.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my bouquet is quite large enough, and it would be a pity to spoil Mr. Carlton's gift," was the cold reply.</p>
               <p>"But you used to be so fond of these Burgundy roses," observed Gerard, approaching her with an involuntary fascination he could not resist.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps; but tastes alter with time," she said, haughtily, "as Mr. Carlton no doubt has experienced."</p>
               <p>"Not taste; but circumstances may doubtless change," said Gerard, in a sad, low tone that Mabel felt, though her wounded pride would not permit her to notice.</p>
               <p>"Then you two knew each other before you met here the other evening," said Norah, gaily. "Why, you never told us that, Mabel!"</p>
               <p>"I did not suppose you would be at all interested in such a trifling circumstance," replied Mabel, carelessly. "I met Mr. Carlton in Dublin when I was staying with my aunt, and he was at the University—that is all the mystery."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is all," repeated Gerard. "Miss May's circle of friends and admirers<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6520-00000011"/> was far too large for her to preserve one insignificant person in her mind. There is more hope of being remembered in a quiet country place like this, is there not, Miss Adams?" he added, turning to Fanny, with a half-jesting, half-tender glance, which it would have been evident to a close observer arose rather from pique than any warmer feeling.</p>
               <p>"We have scarcely enough experience to know the effect of much society," replied Fanny, with a really pretty blush; "but I believe we should never forget early friends, wherever we may be: should we, Norah?"</p>
               <p>"It depends whether they deserve remembering," said the gay girl, archly. "My poor brain is too weak to trouble it with useless lumber. But Mabel's queenlike disdain is quite beyond my poor power to imitate, and a vast deal more sublime than my giddy forgetfulness. Mr. Carlton looks quite awed by it:"</p>
               <p>Mabel affected not to hear this speech, but the hand that held the bouquet visibly trembled, and a flower or two dropped from the bouquet. Gerard stooped to pick them up from the ground, and apparently restored them to their owner, but Mabel saw that a sprig of flowering myrtle was missing, and that the young man lingered a moment ere he accepted Fanny's timid invitation to accompany, them to the house. Had Gerard Carlton looked at her as she perceived this, he might have read a softer expression in her lovely face; but his eyes were studiously averted, and his whole attention appeared engrossed by the inquiries Fanny made as to his mother's health.</p>
               <p>"I will come over as soon as I can to see her," said the young girl, kindly; "but this is such a very busy time, and my father does not like us to be away for an hour together. In a week or two it will be different, and then—"</p>
               <p>"She will be delighted to see you," said Gerard: "you were always a great favorite. And now, as I have delivered her message. and received yours, I will return at once, without coming in this evening."</p>
               <p>Fanny and Norah made some fruitless opposition to this proposal, but Gerard persisted, and after a cordial farewell to his young hostesses, turned to say good-bye to Mabel, but she was gone.</p>
               <p>Poor Gerard! his walk did not tend to raise his spirits much that evening, and Mrs. Carlton made some effort to learn the cause of his increased dejection as they sat together at their frugal supper, but in vain. Gerard was determined that his mother's sorrow should not be increased by the knowledge of his hopeless affection for Mabel May, and he tried to divert her from the subject by telling her of the projected shooting party at Bally Adams. But this apparently innocent piece of news had anything but the desired effect on Mrs. Carlton. She looked anxiously at her son, and for a minute or two seemed hesitating whether to say what was evidently on her very lips.</p>
               <p>"Gerard," she began, "don't think me very foolish, but I do wish you would give up this party."</p>
               <p>"Why, my dear mother?" returned Gerard, in some surprise. "It was only a few hours ago you urged me to take a little more recreation, and mix with our good neighbors at Bally Adams. What objection can you have to my going for a few hours' shooting?"</p>
               <p>"None that you will think very rational, I fear," replied his mother, with a faint smile. "I am not often so ridiculous as to believe in presentiments, Gerard, and yet I feel so strange an aversion to this plan, that I cannot quite disregard it; I am sure some evil will come of it."</p>
               <p>"My dearest mother," said the young man, gently, "there is nothing I would not sacrifice for your sake, and a shooting-party is a mere trifle to give up. But still, pardon me if I say it would be unworthy of you to attach such importance to a mere fancy as to act on it yourself, or for me to risk offending our friends by such a capricious change of purpose. You are nervous and shaken, or you would never dream of it."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton was silenced, if not convinced. She could not but confess her son was right, and that she ought not to expect such a causeless impression to influence him, after having accepted the invitation; yet the dislike she felt to the party was unaccountably strong, even to herself, but she had the good sense to affect a courage she could not feel, and quietly assenting to her son's argument, the subject was dropped, and soon after they retired for the night.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <p>WHEN Gerard Carlton had left Mr. Adams to join the more attractive members of his family, that gentleman, having exhausted his various occupations, and given all the orders that could well be crowded into one evening, ordered his horse to be saddled, and set off on an expedition to Garron's Hill, the seat of Andrew Guilford, Esquire, Justice of the Peace, Now this attention on his part was certainly not dictated by any particular regard for the gentleman in question; but Adams, though decidedly opposed to any idea of being put in the Commission of the Peace himself, deemed it good policy to keep well with those who enjoyed that honor; and besides, there were perhaps other motives to actuate this visit than mere ceremony. In truth, Adams more than suspected that the justice was in considerable pecuniary embarrassment ments, arising chiefly from former extravagance; and as he had some little personal concern in the affairs of the owner of Garron's Hill, he took more than a friendly or inquisitive interest in the state of matters there.</p>
               <p>Everything about the estate bore marks of the present position of its owner. The stables, once filled with hunters, now contained but the one hack, which carried his master to Quarter Sessions at Mayborough, or to Justice meetings at Ballick-Moyler, and the shoulders of which were occasionally galled by the collar in drawing his worship to dinner parties in the neighborhood. The estate had also long ago been stripped of its most valuable timber; and the lawn or park, as it was called, was now ploughed up to the very windows of the house, instead of stretching away in velvet-like verdure, as far as the eye could reach. Everything told the same unmistakable tale of penury, decay, and difficulty in a spot where Adams could recall having so often heard the merry hunter's horn resound, and the walls ring again with the jovial huntsmen's laugh and song. And now what was it? A dreary, desolate waste, without ornament or even neatness, without the mansion, whilst within its walls the unhappy master sat, vainly cogitating how to liquidate a debt that weighed heavily upon him, breaking his rest at night and destroying his peace by day.</p>
               <p>It was no uncommon, but yet a most melancholy picture, even to the matter-of-fact Adams; but his ruminations were interrupted by perceiving between the trees of the avenue leading up to the house, a tall, ragged, suspicious-looking fellow, evidently prowling about with some latent and secret purpose, which shunned observation. The moment he found himself observed, he leaped over the quickest hedge, and Adams lost sight of him. The circumstance attracted his attention for the instant, but his mind was too intent on the object of his visit to dwell on a not uncommon apparition; and making the best of his way to the hall door he consigned his horse to the care of a servant, and entered the house in quest of its solitary master.</p>
               <p>"Adams," exclaimed Guildford, "you are indeed an unexpected visitor at this late hour. But walk in—I am glad to see you."</p>
               <p>"And I," said Adam, "I am delighted to see you so well and cheerful, Mr. Guildford. But, to be sure, you have a sweet spot here. What fields!—what an extensive view!"</p>
               <p>"Yes the view is extensive," said the justice; "but I could very well dispense with it, Adams. You understand?"</p>
               <p>"Ah—yes," said Adams, with a grim smile; "I understand—true; but I suppose you found the woods and trees of more use to you as timber than—"</p>
               <p>"Of more use to me, Adams?" interrupted Guildford. "No, no! They may have been of more use to my predecessors; but as to me, I don't believe I got a bundle of fire-wood out of them for my kitchen grate; and, after all, the house is tumbling about my ears; it wants new roofing, new windows, and the floors are in a dreadful state; and as for paint, the wood cries for it, but cries in vain."</p>
               <p>"Come, come, my good sir." said Adams. "you draw a gloomy picture; "but these things cannot always be done at once. Repair the roof this Summer, think of the windows next year, and let the floor remain until—"</p>
               <p>"I let my guests and myself tumble into the cellars below!" interrupted Guildford.</p>
               <p>"Nay, nay, my dear sir," said Adams, with an effort at jocularity; "Heaven forbid! for that might let all the claret run."</p>
               <p>"Run from the bins in my cellar!" said Guildford, bitterly. "Get blood out of a stone, if you can, but not claret out of empty bottles, which are the only occupants of the cellars of Garron's Hill."</p>
               <p>"You jest, Mr. Guildford," said Adams; "why at your last party, the wine was pronounced first-rate tipple."</p>
               <p>"Very likely, Adams; but had you called for another bottle, faith I must have sent to Carlow for it; not another pint could have been squeezed out of my cellars."</p>
               <p>"Humph!" said Adams, more seriously, for he began to see the state of matters at Garron's Hill was worse than he imagined "What is to be done, then, Mr. Guildford?"</p>
               <p>"Read this," said the magistrate, holding out a letter to the astonished Adams. "You will see that the old house will be ransacked next week, and not a chair left for its wretched owner."</p>
               <p>"Tut, tut," said Adams, "that must not be; things cannot have come to that pass. There is surely some remedy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Guildford, "there is a remedy."—"Name it," said Adams.</p>
               <p>"A mortgage," groaned the justice.</p>
               <p>A dead silence ensued, which was broken by Guildford, who, following Adams to the window, where he was still studying the fatal document handed to him by his host, suddenly grasped the farmer's hand, and in hoarse, broken tones, implored his assistance.</p>
               <p>"Will you be my friend,—my preserver from ruin, Adams? You will be amply secured, and I will pay you whatever interest you like; I will make it the most advantageous investment you could make,—only say you will do it, or I believe I shall blow my brains out before morning."</p>
               <p>Adams was fairly taken by surprise, and more perplexed than he had perhaps ever been in his life. He instinctively felt that there were "breakers a-head," and that the tempting proposal possibly covered a sunken rock that might wreck his hard-earned fortune. And yet, when he cast his eyes on the prospect before him—the broad acres that,<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6520-00000012"/> with proper outlay and cultivation, would yield so ample a return; the fine old house, which a few hundreds would restore to its former state as a noble old mansion—and thought that a mortgage on that fair estate would almost certainly ensure its ultimate ownership to its possessor, his resolution wavered. Guilford's eyes were fixed on his face, and the wily justice read the conflict between prudence and inclination with instinctive penetration.</p>
               <p>"Adams, you will, you must assist me," he began, "and I—"</p>
               <p>Before he could finish the sentence, an ashy paleness came over his features, the hand which he had laid on Adams's arm relaxed its hold, and he sank into a chair that stood near him.</p>
               <p>Unable to account for so sudden a change, but attributing it to the excess of his host's distress, Adams turned once more to look at the fields in front of the window, before replying to the earnest entreaty, when, to his astonishment, he beheld within a few yards of the house the same ragged, singular-looking individual he had encountered in the avenue.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible," he thought, with the quick shrewdness of an Irishman, "that this fellow can have anything to do with Guilford's sudden agitation? If so, there's something beneath the surface that must be looked into." But before he had time to consider this new idea, Guilford suddenly rose.</p>
               <p>"You see, my friend," he exclaimed, in a more cheerful tone than he had yet spoken, "what it is to have sleepless nights and bad appetite next day. I have eaten no dinner, and am quite faint and giddy. We'll have some supper to-night, if I am turned out of doors to-morrow."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, Guildford rang the bell, and ordered refreshments and whiskey to be brought, and in a few moments the two strangely assorted friends were partaking of some capital woodcocks, and whisky that Adams pronounced with a sigh of satisfaction to be "a real nosegay." Guildford partook of it freely himself, and pressed his guest to follow his example and in a short time the good cheer seemed to take effect on the spirits of both, for Adams began to laugh and tell long stories, and his host listened and applauded, and passed the whisky bottle, till all trace of gloom or suspicion had apparently vanished.</p>
               <p>"And now, my excellent friend," said the justice, when Adams began to talk of ordering his horse, "tell me, will you not give me the satisfaction of feeling that the man I most esteem in the county is the one who alone has power over this old estate, and that should the various chances of life ever prevent my redeeming the mortgage, I shall be consoled by knowing that he will reign here in my stead."</p>
               <p>The bait took. Adams eagerly caught at the idea of becoming one day lord of Garron's Hill, and one of the acknowledged gentry of the county, for, as he knew perfectly well, Guildford had no more chance of redeeming the mortgage than of buying up the county. "And then," he thought, "my dear son William will take his place among the highest in the neighborhood, and he a credit to his family; and then, if Mabel May—"</p>
               <p>The supplementary contingency was, however, too remote to be considered at so critical a moment, especially as Guildford continued to ply his guest with arguments and whisky punch, till both mind and body became considerably softened under their united influence.</p>
               <p>The result might be easily anticipated. Before Adams bade adieu to his hospitable entertainer, he had fairly promised to advance the money required, adding that he would go next day to his lawyer to make the necessary arrangements for the completion of the affair.</p>
               <p>It argued well for the diplomatic powers of the justice that Adams, who had come over on purpose to remind him of a certain bond for one thousand pounds on which the interest was overdue, not only abstained from pressing, but actually forebore to mention the matter, and took his leave without attempting to introduce the real object of his visit.</p>
               <p>Garron's Hill was distant about five Irish miles from Bally Adams, and two of these Mr. Adams had trotted over, in complacent and quiet reflections on his night's work, when a violent thunderstorm, accompanied by a perfect flood of rain, compelled him to take shelter in a lonely wood by the roadside, which, poverty-stricken as it looked yet offered an additional inducement to the farmer in the shape of a small shed adjoining, capable of giving cover to his favorite Black Jack. Adams's loud knocks with the thick end of his pondrous whip were answered by a rough voice calling out, "Who's there?" without, however, any effort being made to open the door.</p>
               <p>"Let me in," cried Adams; "I want shelter from the storm; I shall be drowned in another minute if you keep me waiting any longer."</p>
               <p>The tenant of the hovel muttered some not very amiable reflection to himself, as he slowly walked towards the door, and admitted the new comer to an apartment that certainly boasted no attractions but its roof for an intrusion on its wretchedness. But Adams had no time to look around him, for, to his great surprise and discomfiture, he recognised in the man before him the same ill-looking fellow he had seen at Garron's Hill. The man looked curiously at his visitor as he was himself regarded by him.</p>
               <p>"It's Misther Adams, if I am in my right senses," he said, after a moment's pause.</p>
               <p>"The same, my excellent friend—Adams of Bally Adams, and well known in the county."</p>
               <p>"In faith, an you are Misther Adams," said the man; "and may be you will not be forgotten in the day of reckoning!"</p>
               <p>"My good fellow," said Adams, in no little terror, "what do you mean? Have I ever oppressed the poor, or joined any party against them? You can't say I have, or—"</p>
               <p>"It's well, Misther Adams," said the man, smiling sarcastically; "and it's to be hoped you'll keep in the same righteous course; and as I said before, you'll not be forgotten in the day of reckoning."</p>
               <p>The mysterious manner of the man caused Adams to give an uneasy glance at the sky, to ascertain the prospects of the weather. All was dark, and lowering darkness had set in, and there seemed little hope of the storm abating for some time. The lightning still flashed vividly at short intervals, followed by loud and continued peals of thunder. To complete the awkward embarrassment of his unpleasant situation, Black Jack, alarmed by the lightning, broke loose from the stake to which his master had fastened him, and galloped away in the direction of Bally Adams.</p>
               <p>He's off, anyhow," said the tenant of the cabin, chuckling as he beheld the consternation depicted on the countenance of his visitor. "Enter now, your honor, and be sated. Morning will come, that's sartain, and then, may be, you'll see your way home."</p>
               <p>"Morning!" ejaculated the unfortunate landowner. "What, am I to be prisoner here till then?"</p>
               <p>"Prisoner!" said the man. "Och now, is it prisoner you'll be under the roof of honest Paddy Darby? Faith, if you think that, Misther Adams, there is the door, and there is the storrum. So do as you plase."</p>
               <p>"Nay, nay, honest Darby, since that is your name, I did not mean prisoner by compulsion, but from necessity, owing to the violence of the storm."</p>
               <p>"Come near to the fire then, Misther Adams, and I bid you welcome here," said the man. "I believe we have met before, and not long ago, both being bound for the same place."—</p>
               <p>"I have been to the hall," said Adams.</p>
               <p>"So have I," said Paddy, and a glimmer from the turf embers flashing across his face, revealed an expression half comical, half bitter, on his truly Irish features.</p>
               <p>Adams again marvelled what business Paddy could have at the Hall, but wisely forebore to question him, judging that he would unfold the mystery unasked, if he chose to confide in him. Paddy, however, neither asked any questions, nor appeared inclined to pursue the subject at the moment, and a pause ensued, which was at length broken by Adams.</p>
               <p>"Garron's Hill is in a sad state," he said, interrogatively, by way of giving an opportunity for his companion to enter on the subject.</p>
               <p>"Good enough for the owner," replied Paddy; "and, in truth, he would be puzzled to tell you, or any one, by what right he is in it, at all, at all."</p>
               <p>"By what right, Paddy?" said Adams, pricking up his ears. "Why, it's his own, is it not?"</p>
               <p>"The storm is a dreadful one, by the powers!" was Paddy's evasive reply.</p>
               <p>"'Tis heavy indeed," said Adams, curtly.</p>
               <p>"Ay, Misther Adams, but a heavier one will fall on Garron's Hill before long, or my name's not Paddy Darby."</p>
               <p>"Why, I know," said Adams, lowering his tone, "that Mr. Guildford is in some little trouble just now, but we shall set all right again in a few days."</p>
               <p>"What! and you'll help him!" exclaimed Paddy. "I'd like to know the security the man that helps Andrew Guildford is likely to get."</p>
               <p>"Why, my friend, I, or any other man that helps the owner of Garron's Hill, will have the very best security," said Adams—" the estate itself."</p>
               <p>"I thought as much; but a word in your ear, Misther Adams," said Paddy; and, reaching across the hearth, he said in a half whisper, "it is not his to mortgage, and that's the storrum I was speaking of."</p>
               <p>Adams looked aghast; he could have embraced the rough mortal who appeared before him thus opportunely to save him from ruin, but he did not speak a word, and only motioned Paddy to continue.</p>
               <p>"Have nothing to do with it, Misther Adams," said he; "have nothing to do with it; the big thafe of the world that he is, would rob and murther his own father for hire, that he would; for I know him well, and he knows me, that's more."</p>
               <p>"I do remember," said Adams, when he in some degree recovered the breathless astonishment in which Paddy's warning had thrown him, "that no small surprise was expressed when we heard to whom that estate had been bequeathed on the death of the worthy predecessor of Mr. Guildford."</p>
               <p>"Ay," said Paddy, "and folks might well lift up their eyes at such a crying shame; but be aisy, your honor, aisy now, and shut your mouth a bit, and may be you'll be lifting up your eyes bigger still before long; but if you spake but half a word of what I tell you, the throuble, will be greater that your honor 'll be getting into than a mortgage on Garron's Hill—mind that. Misther Adams."</p>
               <p>"I know when to speak and when to hold my tongue, Paddy, or I should not be Adams of Bally Adams, I can tell you."</p>
               <p>"And when to part with your money, and when to keep it, eh, your honor?" said Paddy, archly.</p>
               <p>"True, Paddy, and I don't think I could find a better time for parting with it than<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6520-00000013"/> when I've got a man to reward who has done me good service," said Adams, thrusting a well-filled purse into the hand of his mysterious <unclear>host</unclear>.</p>
               <p>"Long life to your honor!" said Paddy: "and now, may be, you would like to know more about this worthy justice at the Hall: but the time is not yet come for me to open my month entirely; but what I may say I will, for your honor's the rale gentleman, any way. But I'd like to know one thing first—have you lint Mr. Guildford some money, and how much was it?"</p>
               <p>"I lent him a thousand pounds at interest on his bond, about three months ago," replied Adams.</p>
               <p>"Three months agone," repeated Paddy; "oh, then, may be it was not intirely a friendly visit your honor paid the justice this day?"</p>
               <p>"I seldom have time to pay such visits, my friend," replied Adams, solemnly; "when I mount Black Jack. I am generally bound on business matters."</p>
               <p>"Humph!" said Paddy: "and you got your interest of course?"</p>
               <p>"Well, to say the truth," replied Adams, "the man was so pressed for money, and so terribly down-hearted, that I could not find it in my heart to remind him of it."</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Paddy; "so a pretty business you have made of it, Misther Adams—went for your money, and near been cheated out of ten times as much on a false security; got wet to the skin, lost your horse, and only poor humble Paddy Darby to comfort you. Ah! troth now, how you grand gentlefolks go to work! So you've lost your first quarter's interest, any how; now mind, and don't be afther losing the lump as well."</p>
               <p>"I'm not afraid of that," said Adams, "if you keep the storm you talk of from bursting over Garron's Hill for another nine months."</p>
               <p>"And in that time you think you'll get your money, do you, your honor?"</p>
               <p>"I do. Paddy," replied Adams.</p>
               <p>"Humph! wish you such luck, my honey; you've your eye on his Michaelmas rents may be; but who witnessed the bond? tell me that, will you, your honor."</p>
               <p>"Matthew Read, the steward, who—"</p>
               <p>"Died the other day," interrupted Paddy, drily.</p>
               <p>"Died!" said Adams, in some alarm: but recovering himself, he exclaimed with a tone of inward satisfaction. "But I have the bond! I have the bond!"</p>
               <p>"That may be so," said Paddy; "but that is not having the money, you know, and he'll snap his fingers at you, when you ask for it."</p>
               <p>"Then I'll arrest him," said Adams.</p>
               <p>"You don't know the scoundrel, your honor," said Paddy; "you don't know him. Can he look any one in the face now, answer me that?"</p>
               <p>"Well, he has a strange, downcast look I do remember," replied Adams.</p>
               <p>"A gallows look, you mean, your honor; but you shall have a bit of my story, and then may be you'll judge better of that spalpeen at the Hall. But the wind blows cold, your honor, so I'll just make up the bit of fire, and shut that thafe of a door, that won't keep fast, bad luck to it."</p>
               <p>Paddy placed some turf on the fire, and making fast the door, and ascertaining that no one was within hearing, he drew his stool close to that of the worthy farmer, and thus began his bit of a history.</p>
               <p>"Your honor may remember that Carron's Hill belonged to old Misther Michael Garron, a landowner, much belike your honor, only with this difference—he was mean and niggard, while your honor is known to be generous and free. Well, this Misther Garron was come from an ancient family in the county of Limerick, but from misunderstandings and disputes when a boy, he turned his back on his relations, and, like Paddy the piper, set up for himself, caring not a rush for friends or family. Well, your honer, it's not for me to be telling you how money makes money, and how money buys land and builds houses, but everything prospered with Michael Garron, so that he, in due course of time, bought all these broad lands and bogs over which the storrum now howls, and built the big house, and called it Garron's Hill, without thanks to either father or grandfather, so that, in coorse, he had power to lave it to whoever he might fancy.</p>
               <p>"Now, your honor, Michael took no great fancy to any one near him, though many took a vast liking to him, or at laste to his money. Who would be the heir, was what every one was wondering, as your honor will remember, and no one could tell, for it is a great question whether old Garron knew himself. In coorse, your honor, such a large property must have wanted a lawyer, and a steward to settle matters and get in the rints. The lawyer came from Dublin and the steward from I don't know where, but he brought his nephew with him, and that nephew, you know, is the present justice, who has got your money, and I only wish your honor may see the color of it again.</p>
               <p>"Well, as it fell out, old Michael Garron having much time that he didn't know what to do with, took to reading larned books, to the wonder of every body that knew him; but like the ould man of Ballisnasloe of eighty years old, who began to larn his A B C, saying, 'Better late than niver,' Mr. Garron parsevered, till he read and read by day and by night, till niver an eye had he to see out of, so that when spectacles and glasses enough to glaze this ould cabin gave him no help, he called the steward's nephew, who was a cunning thafe then, as well as now, and told him to read to him a bit; and so the artful young spalpeen got to be a great favorite of the old miser, though he kept a wise tongue in his head, and made no cry about it. Your honor knows old Garron niver got a wife; he knew better than that; but it was a wonderful sight to see what a power of cousins, male and female, came from all parts to ask after his health, and to hear them begging and praying to be let jist to come and see to him a bit, and amuse and nurse him; but it was all no good. The ould miser only laughed in his sleeve at the greedy varmints, and would have packed them back as soon as they came, but for dacency's sake to his own blood and people. So, as they came many a mile to see him, he let them stop a bit; only he took care they niver went away a brass ladle the better than they came.</p>
               <p>"Well, your honor will believe they all looked at young Guildford with an evil eye, and gave him a blessing many a time; but it was no good at all, at all, and no one was surprised, though many a one was in a towering passion, to find, when the ould man died, that he had left the estate to the thafe of a clerk, as they called him.</p>
               <p>"Guilford's uncle, the steward, had died about two years before his master; so that the spalpeen had been steward as well as reader, and at last he was master, and man, and every thing else at Garron's Hill. But I forgot to tell your honor that some time before ould Mr. Garron took to larning his buke, he used to go to Dublin once in every year; and the very last time he went there he made a will in favor of the only relation he had in the world who had never come to bother him, and who was the son of an old sweetheart into the bargain; and that man, your honor. I'd give a Jew's eye to find; for, as sure as you are master of Bally Adams, he's the real heir of Garron's Hill."</p>
               <p>"And what was the gentleman's name, Paddy?" asked Adams.</p>
               <p>"That's a sacret, your honor," replied Paddy; "I can't tell at present; but I've tried and tried, and asked of those that ought to know where he is, and whether he is living, but all to no good at present; but it's myself that'll find him, if he's above ground, and till then I can't go a step further, lest I go into the bog, your honor, and spoil all."</p>
               <p>"I see, I see," said Adams, with a knowing wink, "it's the bright golden fee you're looking for, Paddy, and you won't stir till you can get it. Nothing for nothing, eh, Paddy? You're a wise man, and I can't blame you."</p>
               <p>"Sure and sartain, your honor, the thafe that's robbed the heir of his inheritance has had a pretty penny for his wickedness," said Paddy; "and it's not doing the dhirty thing I'd be for asking a thrifle for getting it back to him. But, any way, your honor, it's sinse and raison to suppose that I must find the heir before I can get the estate away from the dhirty scoundrel that's no more right to reign there than I have."</p>
               <p>"Then I am to suppose, Paddy, that there was another will, and another name mentioned in that will besides Andrew Guildford?" said Mr. Adams.</p>
               <p>"Your honor's jist afther guessing the raal thruth, like a 'cute gintleman that you are," replied Paddy.</p>
               <p>"And don't Guildford know you are in possession or believe you are in possession of this important secret?" said Adams.</p>
               <p>"There's small <emph>belafe</emph> in the case, your honor—'tis facts; the justice knows that, sure enough."</p>
               <p>"And he pays you for keeping the secret, no doubt?" said Adams.</p>
               <p>"Pays me!" said Paddy indignantly, "the mane, dhirty villain that he is; he did pay me, till I got into a little throuble, and was safe on my travels for seven years. And I'm not long returned, you see, and now he turns the could shoulder on me, but I'll be even with him yet."</p>
               <p>"It's strange," remarked Adams, "that he has never tried to relieve himself from his difficulties by selling or mortgaging the estate long since, especially it he knew his title was likely to be disputed."</p>
               <p>"There's many a good raison for that, your honor," replied Pat, with a knowing smile. "He's never been so hard pushed as he is now; and then, to part with Garron's Hill would he like parting with the apple of his eye. It's the consequence that it gives him, your honor, and it's himself that likes folk to talk of Mr. Guildford, of Garron's Hill; and he'd care little for the riches it that was gone. And then, you see, I'm al ways at his elbow, and a word from me to the purchaser or mortgagee would, he well knows, upset the whole thing; and before I left the counthry, I got him cautioned, that though I was out of the way, ther'd be one not far off who'd watch all he did and if he dared dispose of the estate, would soon put a stopper on the business, and may be, a cord round his own neck, And that he might see I did not bark when I couldn't bite, I whispered in his ear the name of the rightful owner of Garron's Hill, and I bade him be sartain sure he'd be found by me or my friend if he played false in my absence; but not hearing from me, he began to think that I must be dead, and that he was safe in his ill-gotten possessions. To his great surprise, and I daresay disgust, I am returned, and he has as yet refused to see me—the ill favored bogtrotter! To-morrow he shall see me, however, and I left a bit of paper, appointing him to see me this very night in my cabin; but the storrum will keep him safe at home, there's no fear of that."</p>
               <p>"I suppose I must not ask you how you got to be so certain about the forged will?" said Adams; "but you know it takes a good deal to get a man out of possession when once he's got a property, and perhaps I.—"</p>
               <p>"Hush! your honor—not a word of that at present," said Paddy. "I know what I know; but I won't spake till I can prove my<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6520-00000014"/> words lest I spoil the fruit by plucking it too soon. It may be months, or may be years, before I succeed; and so, Misther Adams, you see that's why I thought I had better thrust you, who people say are a just man; and I want you to promise to come to me if I fall sick, or am in any throuble at all, wherever I am, and then I'll tell you all the particulars, for you to see after all the witnesses, and, above all, the raal heir. Will you do this. Misther Adams? It would be worth your while, I can tell ye."</p>
               <p>"I promise that I will," said Adams. "It is only right that justice should be done, and I engage to render you every assistance, whether you are sick or well, dead or alive."</p>
               <p>"Your honor's the raal gintleman," said Paddy, "and I must see you again, but not here: that won't do, or you might be found out. When I've seen Guildford to-morrow, which he daren't refuse, I will tell you more. And, your honor, the best place will be at the old ruin at the top of Bally Adams Hill, at midnight; it's jist handy for your honor, and no one will be about at that time of night."</p>
               <p>Adams promised to keep the appointment, and then prepared to leave the cabin, as he knew his family would be much alarmed at his long absence in such a storm; and besides, he wanted to think over the strange story he had heard by so singular a chance, but which he never thought of doubting, so completely did it tally with his own knowledge and opinion of Guildford; and further, it recommended itself to his belief by the air of truth and reality which Paddy's manner and narrative unmistakably bore.</p>
               <p>Full of these thoughts, Adams quitted the cabin, after giving Paddy a kindly good night; but ere he had gone a few yards he was startled by the sound of a gentle footstep, and the rustle, as of a cloak, against the corner of the rustic shed adjoining the cabin. The darkness was so great that he could not discern a single object, but he could not be mistaken in the sound, which the stillness that had succeeded to the tempest made distinct and clear in that solitary spot.</p>
               <p>Some one must have been listening to the conversation, and Adams shuddered as the idea that it most probably must have been Guildford flashed across his mind. Nothing could be more likely. Paddy had appointed him to come that night, and under such circumstances even the violence of the storm might not have deterred the guilty justice from keeping such an appointment. Should he have overheard all, or even any part of the information given by Paddy Darby, what a deadly hatred he would cherish against himself, and how easily would he account for his change of purpose as to becoming the mortgagee of Garron's Hill!</p>
               <p>These unpleasant reflections occupied Adams till he reached home, when he found his family in a state of the greatest consternation and alarm, from his prolonged absence, and the return of Black Jack without his master, an hour or two before. Adams briefly assured them that all was well, but it was evident to his family that he was not a little agitated from some unexplained cause, besides the storm, to which they knew he would attach but little importance. However, they did not venture to question him: and Adams, though wet through, and exceedingly fatigued, instead of going at once to bed, ordered lights and a fire in his study, with the usual concomitants for making whiskey punch. He then desired his son William to accompany him, and bidding good night to his other children, retired to his own peculiar apartment.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>"WILLIAM, lock the door," began the father, as soon as they were alone in the study. "I wish to talk to you without danger of interruption. You are my son, my eldest son, my heir—heir to Bally Adams, remember that; and prove yourself worthy of my confidence. I know I can depend on you, William; but, zounds! if I doubted you, or if you betrayed my trust, I would disinherit you, cut you off with a shilling, ay, and by heavens, without one; do you mark me, lad?—d'ye hear?"</p>
               <p>"I do," replied William; "but permit me to ask if I have not always held sacred the confidence you have hitherto reposed in me?"</p>
               <p>"You have, you have, William," said his father, "and that is why I love you, boy—I have a pride in you. But is the door fast?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, fast as a church," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"Well then, hear me. I have been to Garron's Hill, to see Andrew Guildford, Esquire," said Adams, laying an emphasis on the title, which rather astonished his son.</p>
               <p>"Well, what of that?" said William. "Could he look you in the face? What happened?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, William, you were right for once," continued his father; "you always did object to that loan of a thousand pounds, and I did not much like it myself. But you see, I lent him the money partly to keep on good terms with him as a magistrate, and partly because I found that he would object to mortgage Garron's Hill, of which I should be proud indeed to see you master."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said William, "and you thought his not being able to pay you the thousand pounds would induce him to apply to you to become mortgagee."</p>
               <p>"William, you are my true son," said Adams; "as clear-headed as your father; you see the thing exactly."</p>
               <p>"Then, he has offered the mortgage to you," said William; "and you will of course accept it?"</p>
               <p>"No, I will not!" exclaimed Adams.</p>
               <p>"I thought," said William, looking somewhat surprised, "that was your great ambition."</p>
               <p>"So it was," replied Adams; "but the best-laid plans in this world do not always succeed, and I am not an exception to the rule."</p>
               <p>"You have been hitherto," said William; "but may I ask your reason for refusing what you so much desire. Why not become mortgagee, since he is going to mortgage the estate?"</p>
               <p>"He will not, William; he dares not," said Adams.</p>
               <p>"Dares not!" repeated William. "Why?"</p>
               <p>Adams looked round, and then, in a half whisper, said, "Because he is not the lawful owner; it is no more his than mine." William started, but Adams continued in a more excited tone, "Yes, William, it is a fact; he is not the owner of Garron's Hall, and yet the scoundrel would have taken my money, and given me as security what was not his; and then, only think, the terrible loss, the disgrace when the rightful owner appears and coolly says to me, 'Your mortgage is not worth a shilling, Mr. Adams; the estate was not your debtor's to mortgage; you must get your money as you can.'"</p>
               <p>"But who is the lawful owner?" asked William.</p>
               <p>"That is a secret at present," replied his father; "but come nearer still, and listen."</p>
               <p>Adams then repeated to his son all he had heard from Paddy Darby, concluding with the rueful reiteration of the thought uppermost in his mind, "I wish I had my thousand pounds back again, William."</p>
               <p>"Well, you have his bond," said William.</p>
               <p>"Ay, boy; but I have heard to-night that the witness who signed it is dead."</p>
               <p>"That is not of much consequence, I imagine," said William; "he cannot deny it."</p>
               <p>"He is rogue enough for anything, I suspect," replied Adams, "and I was a fool to trust him. But, boy, tell me, what do you think of Paddy's story?"</p>
               <p>"It is a strange tale," said William; "but what rather confirms its truth, is the effect you yourself saw that his presence had upon Guildford; and yet it does seem strange that no one but this poor wretch should appear to know anything of these circumstances."</p>
               <p>"Still, I have a strong conviction that the will by which Guildford became possessor of the property, was a forged instrument," replied Adams.</p>
               <p>"And yet," said William, doubtfully, "I have heard that old Garron never saw any one but this man for years before his death, and what more likely than that he should be worked upon to leave him his property! I cannot yet see the reason to doubt till we have more proof, and—"</p>
               <p>"And then the mortgage and the pretty Mabel, eh, my boy?" said Adams, on whom the punch began to exercise its usual genial effect. "She won't refuse the master of Garron's Hill, I reckon; but I say, my boy, did you see young Carlton give her a sheep's glance now and then? You must keep your own ground, hark ye!"</p>
               <p>"He or any other man had better not step on it, sir," said William, flushing a little: "but to return to the subject. Don't you think there is reason in what I say?"</p>
               <p>"There is, boy, there is," said Adams; "only, you see, I do remember some story of old Garron having had some love affair in his youth with a young girl, who afterwards married and had a son, and he was just the eccentric old character to remember such an episode all his life; and, however well he might feel inclined towards Guildford, he might prefer his property passing into the hands of a distant relative, and a well-born man, as he was himself, with all his queer ways."</p>
               <p>"By the powers," said William, "whether this Paddy speaks truth or falsehood, Guildford must wish him at the bottom of the sea, and I can scarcely wonder at his intrigues at the trial. But what do you mean to do in the business?"</p>
               <p>"That is not so easily settled, William," replied Adams. "It appears to me very probable that if Guildford heard any of our conversation to-night—and I am inclined to think it was he who brushed by the cabin door—I am doubtful that we shall have a chance of doing anything at all. I should not be surprised if we neither hear nor see any more of poor Paddy Darby."</p>
               <p>"Surely he would hardly venture on murder, bad as he may be!" said William.</p>
               <p>"Oh, there are other ways of stopping a fellow's mouth without actually cutting his throat," said Adams; "and Guildford looked desperate enough for anything when I went in to-night; a wolf at bay is not to be trifled with."</p>
               <p>"Would it not have been better," asked William, after a short pause, "to have returned to the cabin and warned Paddy of his danger, and that you thought some one been listening?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps it might," replied Adams, with a rueful shrug; "but, to say truth, Will, I had had enough of storms for one night, and I thought Bally Adams the best port to make for with all speed."</p>
               <p>"It surely must have been Guildford who was listening," mused William.</p>
               <p>"And a pretty business if it was," said Adams. "Why, boy, my life is in danger if such a man knows that I am in possession of his secret; and if I decline the mortgage, he will be confirmed in any doubt he might have as to Paddy's companion in the cabin;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6520-00000015"/> while, if I advance the money, why, ten to one I'm a ruined man. I was a fool to meddle in such muddy water. What is to be done, William? Only imagine that man's vindictive hatred to me, ay, and you too; our lives are not worth a year's purchase, I tell you."</p>
               <p>"Wait till you have seen Paddy to-morrow night," said William: "you will then know the result of his interview with Guildford, and can judge better of the extent of the danger, and whether he has any suspicion of you."</p>
               <p>"True," said Adams: "I had almost forgotten that appointment: but," he added, after a pause, "suppose, William, that he heard me promise to help Paddy to the utmost of my power, that would be dreadful, though as to my knowledge at present, he would laugh at it, knowing that any evidence that I could now bring forward would be useless, and that I would never commit myself by spreading such a tale as Paddy has related to me."</p>
               <p>"Suppose," said William, "you were to give up the bond you hold—that would disarm him at once, and quiet any suspicious he may entertain."</p>
               <p>Adams, though a dear lover of life and limb, was a lover of money also, and had no fancy for so quietly giving up a thousand pounds at one blow, and he replied somewhat in the spirit, if not the words of Shylock: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>I'll have my bond: I will not hear thee speak,</l>
                        <l>I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>William therefore remained silent, and after some further discussion, both father and son retired to rest, it being now nearly three in the morning, to ponder over the extraordinary circumstances that had come to their knowledge. But the reflections of the unlucky Adams were by no means enviable, as he lay, courting in vain the rest necessary for his exhausted frame.</p>
               <p>"Is it for this," said he, "that I have saved and planned, and rejoiced in Guildford's extravagance for the sake of my boy, my William; and fancied him as the Lord of Garron's Hill, with his pretty bride, and her pretty fortune helping to pay off all encumbrances, and made it like old times—yes, I knew, as I thought, all that could be learnt about the whole of these affairs before I settled all these things in my mind. I knew well enough that Mabel May would have at least ten thousand on her wedding-day, besides the noble blood that will do credit to the family I mean to establish in the county. And I was not far wrong about Guildford himself, he's as hard up as I thought. But then comes this confounded story; and I am in a nice fix, whichever way I turn. If I don't take the mortgage I shall lose my money, and if I do—why then, up pops the real heir perhaps; and though he might be ready enough to sell it on his own terms. I cannot afford that price. 'Tis to have it for a mere song, and yet to be master of the estate, that I have toiled and planned. This has been my hope, my hobby, my one grand aim in life; and now is it to be dashed down when just within my grasp? Have I been a fool, a mere tool, while I fancied I was bending everything to my own will and purpose? Richard Adams, you have been duped, outwitted, and you must be revenged. But yet," he thought, after another interval of restless tossing on his uneasy couch, I ought perhaps to think myself fortunate in hearing the truth from Paddy Darby, in time to save me from the heavy loss that must otherwise have nearly ruined me. What would have been my feelings, had I lost at one blow the fortune and the hope of seeing my boy master of Garron's Hill? I must not forget that."</p>
               <p>To these reflections succeeded the idea of the very unpleasant dilemma in which he found himself in respect to his future line of conduct, should he refuse to become mortgagee. Should he openly and boldly tell Andrew Guildford what he had heard, more especially if he could be quite certain that it was the justice who had been listening at the cabin-door that night, when it would be only politic-to make a virtue of necessity. Then the thought of Paddy Darby, and the very formidable resentment which such a line of conduct would inspire in the breast of a man who evidently never forgot or forgave an injury, occurred to him, and the momentary idea that, after all, he had better advance the money, and stand by Guildford against any attacks made by the returned convict on the title of the justice to his estate.</p>
               <p>"But, then, my honor, my honor!" groaned the unfortunate farmer; "my word is pledged to Paddy, and I will not let it be said that Adams of Bally Adams has ever broken a promise to friend or foe. Pshaw! I won't take the mortgage, and will give no reason except that I have changed my mind; and that must satisfy Guildford, for he shall get no other."</p>
               <p>After coming to this doughty resolution, the worthy man at last managed, soon after daybreak, to fall into a disturbed sleep, and dream of Garron's Hill, and Guildford, and Paddy Darby alternately frowning on him and threatening him, while the former held up to him his bond, with a laugh of derision, and then threw it into the fire. It was long after his usual hour of breakfast that he awoke from his unrefreshing slumbers.</p>
               <p>William Adams had been equally restless. Fear for his father's safety haunted him even more than alarm as to the fate of the money. He had a very mean opinion of Guildford, and distrusted the honesty of Paddy Darby, so he determined in any case to accompany his father to the appointment in the ruin, thinking it very unsafe for the old gentleman to be exposed to the resentment or treachery of either of these worthies.</p>
               <p>It was some time past his usual hour when William descended to the breakfast-room, and found his sisters anxiously wondering at their father's unusual delay.</p>
               <p>"What can have happened, William?" asked Fanny. "It is so strange for him to be in bed at this hour. What was it that agitated him so much last night?"</p>
               <p>"Only the storm, Fanny, and the fright of Black Jack," replied William, trying to speak lightly; but his sister could not be so deceived.</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, William," she exclaimed; "father has been out in many a worse storm than that; and as to Black Jack, my father knew well enough he would come home at once; you are only deceiving me."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I am not," said William; "but—"</p>
               <p>At this moment Mabel May glided into the room with her usual quiet grace, and the young man hastened to place a chair for her, and inquire for her health with an eagerness that betrayed something more than the usual attention to a guest. The young girl was pale and somewhat graver than was natural in one so favored by Fortune's gifts, but she merely said, in reply to Norah's gay badinage on her looks, that she had not slept well, having been disturbed more than once by noises during the night.</p>
               <p>"And you began to think that the wild Irish, whom, of course, you have been taught to consider absolute wolves and tigers in human form, were suddenly rising, I suppose," said Norah. "Ah, Mabel! you will never be a true Irish girl, even if you were to live long enough to be naturalized among our dear, unmanageable natives."</p>
               <p>"Which it is very unlikely I ever shall be," said Mabel, coldly. "I think it most probable this will be my first and last visit to Ireland. When my father returns we shall settle down at his new place in Devonshire, for some years, I hope."</p>
               <p>"Do not say that," whispered William, under cover of the entrance of a servant; "you cannot guess what your words convey, or—"</p>
               <p>"They generally convey my real meaning," she replied in the same tone; but a moment after she turned to Fanny, with an inquiry for her father.</p>
               <p>"We were speaking of him when you came in, Mabel," she replied: "I was telling my brother how uneasy I felt about him, and was almost sure he had some attack on his life last night. He is not a man to have been affected in this way without some real cause."</p>
               <p>"Then you do admit there may be cause for fears in your dear country?" said Mabel, smiling; "but why should you suppose that you would not be told of any such attempt upon your father, Fanny?"</p>
               <p>"Because I should never feel happy about him if once I thought any one had any ill-feeling towards him," said the girl. "William, dear, promise me you will never again let him go any distance alone. I can see you are not easy about him yourself."</p>
               <p>"You are wrong, Fanny," he replied: "I assure you my father had not the slightest attack or threatening of any kind last night; but to set your mind at rest, I will accompany him whenever he goes out late in the day."</p>
               <p>"Pray do," said Norah, "or we shall never feel happy when he is away; and yet, what enemies can he possibly have made, unless indeed it is the gang of the Rath whom he urged Justice Guildford to rout out of the county. Willie, is it not so? He has been threatened by one of those robbers. Gerard Carlton had a narrow escape from one of the gang last Winter, just because he defended old Biddy Mahon."</p>
               <p>Mabel turned her beautiful eyes on the speaker, as if about to ask some question, but either she changed her purpose or was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Adams himself; for the words which were on her lips could only be guessed at by a jealous lover, and the suspicion was enough to bring a gloomy look on William's brow. It was not the first time be had suspected some secret interest on Mabel's part towards Gerard Carlton, though the young girl's manner had been so uniformly guarded and cold where the young man was concerned. But it is as difficult to blind the keen lynx eyes of Jealousy, as to deceive the loving watchfulness of a tender mother, and William Adams did love Mabel sufficiently to be a prey to the green-eyed monster in no ordinary degree. The trifling circumstance, however, which thus irritated the morbid susceptibilities of the young man, was soon forgotten in the uneasiness which the appearance and manner of the head of the family created.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams looked haggard and anxious to a most unprecedented degree for his bustling, genial self. He scarcely replied to the affectionate solicitude expressed by his daughters, nor to the kind inquiries of their fair guest; and after partaking of a hasty and scanty breakfast he abruptly left the room, quickly followed by his eldest son, who repaired at once to the library.</p>
               <p>Mabel soon retired to write some letters, and the two young daughters of the house remained in ill-concealed anxiety as to the mystery which they clearly perceived existed—though as yet they were unable to fathom its nature or import.</p>

                  </choice>," replied William, "provided Darby is first apprised of<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6520-00000016"/> your intention. You need not see the justice till after your interview with Paddy to-night."</p>
               <p>"You are right, my boy," said Adams. "To-night I will keep my appointment with Darby, and I will consult him on the best course for us to pursue. As you say he has a claim to be considered first in the matter, and I will be entirely guided by him; for if he makes any difficulty about it. I cannot with honor tax Guildford with deeds that would bring down his vengeance on my informant. Indeed, I can't say I quite like meddling with the affair at all; it's bad to he mixed up with other folk's business, William; and I hate mysteries of all kinds. There's something queer about Mrs. Carlton that I don't understand, and—"</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, we need not think about her just now," said William quickly; "only as you have mentioned them, I must say, though I like Gerard well enough, I don't see any necessity for bringing him here oftener than can be helped while Miss May is with us. But, to return to our business; I must insist on accompanying you to the ruin to-night, for who can tell what snare may be laid for you?"</p>
               <p>"That you shall do, my lad," replied Adams, "and have your pistols ready loaded. Though, mind you, my conference with Paddy must be private; it won't do for two to be seen at the meeting, or he might cry off altogether, you understand."</p>
               <p>"I won't interfere," replied William; "I shall station myself within call, but out of sight and hearing."</p>
               <p>"You are a good and prudent lad William, and I can fully trust you, as indeed I have given you proof I do," said Adams. "And now, as I am bound for Athy to-day, I wish you'd see Black Jack is ready for me at once, and don't forget this day week is the first of September; so get your guns ready, and see the dogs are in good order. And, by the way. I asked Gerard Carlton to go out with you on the first; but if you don't like to bring him home to dinner, you needn't, you know, only—"</p>
               <p>"Nay," said William, with a slight flush, "I am not so alarmed at an obscure, nameless youth, as to violate the common usages of hospitality. I don't suppose he can have the impertinence to make any serious pretensions to Miss May's favor, though she may be inclined to flirt with him a bit, as all girls do when a handsome young fellow is in question."</p>
               <p>"Right, my boy, right," said Adams. "You would only lower yourself by putting him on a level with my heir; and as to looks, why he can't compare with you. But I can hardly think the mother is really what people whisper; she has always held herself so very high and correct, even straightlaced in her ways, ever since she came here."</p>
               <p>"That may be," said William; "and yet, if all was straightforward, why do we never hear anything of her antecedents? Not a single relation on either side comes to see them. I once heard Gerard say he did not know that he had any relations in the whole world."</p>
               <p>"It is very mysterious, certainly," replied Adams. "And then her being taken so suddenly ill at our dinner. I am positive it must have been either seeing Sir Henry or Miss May that upset her, for they were the only strangers there. And what could Sir Henry want with her, I wonder? I asked Gerard, but he pretended not to know. But I will question the mother myself to-day. It's a duty to sift out what relates to a tenant, you see, William, and I can't bear mysteries. Thank Heaven, no one can say that we have any. No; we are open and frank as the day, saying nothing behind people's backs that we won't say to their faces. No juggling, no deceit at Bally Adams. I always say, stick to the honest, straightforward path, and neither go to the right nor left; never interfere with your neighbor's affairs, getting into troubles, losing one's peace and character, and raising up disputes. No, no; mind your own business, keep a civil tongue and a good name through life, William, and you'll never repent. No twists, no twirlings, and contrivances for me!" said Adams, as he left the room for his rifle.</p>
               <p>On his way to Athy, Adams passed rapidly and cautiously by Rath Wood, which at that period was little less than a neglected jungle, containing however some magnificent trees, with a wilderness of bramble and brushwood, overgrown weeds, and rank grass, through which there was no regular path. The report that the wood was haunted, caused it to be avoided by the superstitious peasantry, so that a place better calculated for a gang of robbers and smugglers could not be found, and they might indeed be looked on as the lawful masters and tenants of the place, for no one was ever rash enough to intrude on their domain.</p>
               <p>There was in the very centre of the wood the ruins of a rude stone building, intended formerly for a watch house or place of observation, denominated "The Rath." Beneath this building it was pretty generally suspected that there were vast and deep subterranean caverns, known only to the smugglers, and to which they were under considerable obligations, as they not only sheltered their booty, but enabled them to baffle all attempts at pursuit, whenever the chase got too hot to be escaped by their ordinary means of terrifying.</p>
               <p>Adams trotted on, in no very pleasant frame of mind, till he reached Athy, where, having ascertained at the post-office that there were no letters for Bally Adams, he finished his other business in the town, and then turned his horse's head in the direction of Mrs. Carlton's pretty villa. That lady was at home, and received him in the little drawing-room, which, small as it was, had an air of refinement and elegance not to be found in the more handsome and spacious apartments of Bally Adams. After inquiries as to her health, and sundry remarks as to the weather, and the state of the crops, Adams dashed into the real object of his visit.</p>
               <p>"Have you seen Sir Henry since you were at our house, my dear madam?"</p>
               <p>"I have," replied the lady, quietly.</p>
               <p>"Ah, then I am right glad to hear it," returned Adams, "for he appeared extremely anxious for an interview with you."</p>
               <p>"Sir Henry was most kind," was the unsatisfactory rejoinder.</p>
               <p>"Ah, he is indeed a most kind and generous benefactor," again sounded Adams.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Mr. Adams," she said, "I did not speak of Sir Henry as a benefactor, but as a friend, and the friend of a near relative of mine."</p>
               <p>Adams was a little surprised; it was the first time he had ever heard Mrs Carlton allude to any relations of her own or her husband's.</p>
               <p>"Surely my dear madam, you knew him then, though he appeared not to know you, when he met you at my house?"</p>
               <p>"I never saw him before," replied Mrs. Carlton, "and his knowledge of me was by report alone. I hope the young ladies are well, Mr. Adams."</p>
               <p>"Quite well, thank you, madam; indeed, I don't allow any illness and fancies at Bally Adams. Rise with the lark and roost with the fowl and there wont be much the matter with any of us—that's my maxim. But, as I was saying, madam, Sir Henry inquired where you lived, and I told him you were a tenant of mine, and that he could not have applied for information in a better quarter."</p>
               <p>"I am glad it so happened," was the brief reply.</p>
               <p>"Sir Henry is not long from India, I understand?" resumed Adams, after a slight pause.</p>
               <p>"He returned about a year ago, I believe," replied Mrs. Carlton.</p>
               <p>Adams remained a short time longer, trying various methods of gaining the information he so much desired; but finding that there was not the slightest chance of gratifying his curiosity, so far as Mrs. Carlton's communicativeness was concerned, he at length rose to take his leave.</p>
               <p>"We shall see Mr. Gerard at Bally Adams on the first," he said. "My boys are expecting good sport, and your son is a first-rate shot, and will furnish your larder, I'll be bound, for some days; eh, Mrs. Carlton?"</p>
               <p>"Gerard is not very well; he is studying hard, Mr. Adams; but I will mention your kind invitation, and don't doubt he will accept it; it will be a pleasant change for him."</p>
               <p>"To be sure, to be sure," assented Adams, "there's my Ned—why, his head's a perfect library, but he can bring down a pheasant with the best of them. As to William, he's a dead shot; but then, where young men are in his predicament, Mrs. Carlton, one does'nt know what they'll take it in their heads to do,—shoot themselves, perhaps, instead of the game, eh madame?"</p>
               <p>Adams took his leave with a knowing chuckle and look, which Mrs. Carlton at first was at a loss to comprehend; but as the truth flashed upon her, she sank into a fit of deep reflection.</p>
               <p>"Can it be," she thought, "that such a refined, lovely girl as that can tolerate the handsome but boorish son of that coarse man? And my Gerard, if it should be as I fear, what will be the consequence on his warm, imaginative nature? And yet better, far better, that he should see that it was impossible, ere he had staked his happiness too entirely on the hazard. For that face—it is too like, too terribly like; I dare not. I could not let him venture. It would haunt me too painfully, and make me tremble for my boy, my only hope, lest his fate should be like his wretched mother's. Pshaw! I am foolish. How can he dream of love and marriage, when he is but a boy, just emerged from tutors and books! I need not create miseries for myself, Heaven knows, when I have so many real sorrows to bear."</p>
               <p>With a sickly smile, Mrs. Carlton rose, and began to busy herself with some work intended for her idolised son; but the shadow rested on her face, and her bosom heaved with many a deep though silent sigh, as the needle passed rapidly through the linen. The ever-present past came even more vividly than usual into her mind, and a face, equal in its manly beauty, and most strangely like to the rare loveliness of Mabel May's rose before her, and made her slight form shudder with the wretched memories connected with those noble but most deceitful features. No, Gerard must be preserved at any cost from such griefs as she had known; and if Mr. Adams were not correct in his hint as to the prospects or intentions of his own hopeful son, hers must be removed from the risk of such dangerous fascination.</p>
               <p>Poor Agatha Carlton! no wonder that she shrank from the very thought of love, especially where that too well remembered face was concerned. Few had suffered, and few perhaps had loved so well as she had done; but both the love and the grief were nearly passed, so far as regarded her own feelings and fate. Henceforth, all, for her, was connected with her idolised and most deeply pitied son, and her very identity nearly lost in his. Alas! she knew but too certainly that he also must suffer for her imprudence and her wrongs, and her own deep sorrows were doubled by the inevitable law, "that the sins of the parents shall be visited on the children."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <p>MR. ADAMS had turned the head of his willing steed towards home, and was just trotting out of the town, when some one on horseback rapidly approached him, and turning round, he saw, to his extreme embarrassment and annoyance, the unwelcome figure of Guildford, dressed with unusual neatness and mounted on his back.</p>
               <p>"Your servant, Mr. Adams," said the justice, without raising his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Good morning to you, sir," was Adams's brief reply.</p>
               <p>"You are returning to Bally Adams, I imagine," said Guildford. "May I have the pleasure of riding part of the way with you?"</p>
               <p>"My dear sir. I shall be delighted," said Adams, who, however, would have as soon had his Black Majesty by his side as the justice just at that especial moment. "Charming weather after the storm, Mr. Guildford," he continued.</p>
               <p>"Fine, sir," replied Guildford: "and, by-the-by, I thought of you last night."</p>
               <p>"So did I of you," Adams could have said, but he only replied, "You do me too much honor, Mr. Guildford."</p>
               <p>"Why, the fact is," said the justice, "we were fellow-sufferers, for I got wet through, and I am sure you could not have escaped."</p>
               <p>Adam's fears were confirmed, but his courage rose with the occasion. "Now for it," he thought; "well, let him accuse me, I care not; the tale I heard was not of my seeking." Assuming, therefore, an air of indifference, Adams said, coolly, "Oh, indeed, were you out last night, Mr. Guildford? I thought I left you at home."</p>
               <p>"So you did, Mr. Adams, so you did," said the justice; "but business, you know, must be attended to; and the fact is, for I always like to open, and there should be no concealment, you know, between us, I listened—"</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, and if you did," interrupted Adams; "let me tell you—"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Adams, Mr. Adams," said the justice, quietly, and in his accustomed deliberate tone, "why do you interrupt me? I was about to say, that I listened at my library window, hoping that the rain would abate; but finding that the violence of the storm rather increased than diminished, I ordered my horse, and rode off to Carlow."</p>
               <p>"To Carlow!" ejaculated Adams in astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mr. Adams, to Carlow," said Guildford: "is there anything so extraordinary in that?"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, not at all, my dear sir, not at all," said Adams. "I did not mean that; only, you know it was late, and the weather so bad; and when I left you, you did not mention that you thought of going there; so I confess I am rather surprised,—but, of course you had your reasons."</p>
               <p>"Of course, I had, Mr. Adams; and among others, was the wish to ensue an interview with the person I went to see; not much fear of finding persons from home on such a night, eh?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, I see," said the farmer: "an appointment, my dear sir, and with a man like you, business will never be neglected, even at personal risk."</p>
               <p>"You are right, sir," said the justice; "and I will tell you the nature of my business; for, as I said before, there should be no secrets between us; and what I know, you shall know; and what you know, I ought to know."</p>
               <p>As the justice slowly pronounced these words, he raised for once his sunken eye, which had till now been fixed upon his horse's ears, and encountered the keen anxious glance of Adams, which said as plainly as looks could do. "I understand you, better than you think, my good sir, and it was not going to Carlow that drenched you to the skin."</p>
               <p>"Well," continued Guildford; "to be frank with you, my business at Carlow was to consult with my <choice>
                     <sic>solictor</sic>
                     <corr>solicitor</corr>
                  </choice>, and get the mortgage deed drawn out, with all possible expedition; and I am happy to tell you it will be in readiness by to-morrow morning, and I was even now on my way to Bally Adams, to express my hopes that you would also be ready to fulfil your part of the business, although I felt perfectly sure that there was no danger of your disappointing me."</p>
               <p>Adams twitched his rein nervously, and made the steady Black Jack perform some unwonted vagaries, before he replied in a constrained, thick voice, "Why, to tell you the truth, Mr. Guildford, and there should always be the truth between friends, as you say, I have changed my mind respecting my becoming mortgagee. It does not meet with my son William's approbation, and he being my eldest son and heir, you see I do nothing without his knowledge and consent; so you must excuse my declining your offer in this instance.</p>
               <p>Guildford looked savagely from underneath his bushy eyebrows, and said, in his harshest tone, "Then am I to understand, Mr. Adams, that you positively refuse to be the mortgagee of Garron's Hill?"</p>
               <p>"That is my meaning," replied Adams, again pulling poor Black Jack's bit most unmercifully.</p>
               <p>"And because your son objects to the transaction?" continued Guildford.</p>
               <p>"Exactly so," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"Then, sir," said Guildford, angrily, "let me tell you, you have not acted like an upright, honorable man, and I have just cause to complain of the way in which I have been treated. Had you told me that your son must first be consulted, I should certainly not have posted off to Carlow, and incurred both the inconvenience and danger to my health by the severe drenching I got. It was most unworthy treatment, I must say."</p>
               <p>"Really, Mr. Guildford, I do not understand you," said Adams, taking courage. "I only wish every one was as fair and straightforward as myself; and as to your choosing to set off to Carlow in the rain, all I can say is, that such extraordinary haste in the business is to me exceedingly unaccountable; and I have only your word for it that you did take so singular a step."</p>
               <p>"Only my word!" exclaimed Guildford, fiercely. "What do you dare to imply, sir? I would have you know, sir, that my word is as good as my bond."</p>
               <p>"And if his bond is no better than his word," thought Adams, "Heaven help me to my thousand pounds!"</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, it may be so," said Adams; "but I can only say that had you, at the conclusion of our conversation last night, informed me of your intended expedition, and your arrangement to see your lawyer within the hour, I should at once have advised you to defer any such interview till you had seen me again,—knowing, as I did that my son <choice>
                     <sic>Willian</sic>
                     <corr>William</corr>
                  </choice> must be consulted before finally closing the transaction."</p>
               <p>"It is very well, Mr. Adams," said the justice; "very well indeed, sir; and I dare say that I shall find plenty of persons ready and willing to advance money on such an estate as Garron's Hill; that ill-conduct I shall not soon forget, sir; and as my road leads one way, and yours another, I will wish you good morning."</p>
               <p>Adams raised his extraordinary-shaped hat in reply to this rather enigmatical remark, and trotted briskly on towards Bally Adams, glad to have got over so disagreeable a business without more difficulty, and yet half-regretting the loss of such a tempting opportunity to become so important a personage as the lord of Garron's Hill.</p>
               <p>It was about noon when Guildford parted with his embarrassed companion, and struck off in the road to Carlow at as good a pace as his hack could be induced to break into, for he had much to do, and time was precious.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>IN one of the narrow streets of Carlow, and in an apartment on the second floor of a mean and deplorable-looking tenement, a thin, spare and debauched looking individual was seated; his stockings falling loosely over his ancles, and his feet thrust into what had been red morocco slippers, gave a peculiar air of dissipated vulgarity to his whole appearance, which certainly needed no such addition to its natural repulsiveness.</p>
               <p>Although but little past one o'clock, the whisky bottle stood on the table and, notwithstanding the heat of an August day, the kettle hung over a brisk turf fire, whilst lemons and sugar, close at hand, completed what he termed "material" of the whisky brewery.</p>
               <p>The comfortless tenant of the wretched apartment was in the act of preparing a second mixture of the "elements," when a knock at the door somewhat startled him, and as he was by no means accessible to all who might wish to obtain an interview with him he hesitated before granting admittance; but the application being repeated, he said gruffly, "Come in," and to his surprise, Justice Guildford entered.</p>
               <p>"Styles, my worthy friend," said he, blandly, "I am glad to see you again, well and hearty, to judge from your looks. Ay! at your old tricks I perceive, not deserted your ancient comforter, eh,—well, I don't mind joining you,—if you'll brew me a tumbler of your best."</p>
               <p>Styles briefly returned the Justice's compliments, though his look and tone scarcely seconded the words which expressed his pleasure at the visit with which he was honored. However, he at once set to work in true business style, to prepare the required beverage, and as he knew to a nicety the exact proportions of whisky, sugar, water and lemon, it was no wonder that the justice pronounced the brewing first rate.</p>
               <p>"To what am I indebted for the honor of this visit, Mr. Guildford?" inquired the lawyer for such was the profession of Guildford's host. He had waited patiently till the visitor had sipped his toddy two or three times in silence, and now he determined to begin the conversation himself.</p>
               <p>"Lock your door, Styles," replied Guildford; "our business must not be overheard. There is danger ahead—spies—enemies—around us, and it is only by boldness and caution that we can circumvent their wiles. Who do you think has turned up—for oursins?"</p>
               <p>"Cootes," said the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"Cootes? no," replied Guildford, he is at the bottom of the seas long since. But 'tis a man almost as welcome. 'Tis Ryan."</p>
               <p>"You don't mean it," exclaimed the lawyer. "Tis impossible!"</p>
               <p>"I do," relied the justice; "and what's more, he's not a stone's throw from Garron's Hill."</p>
               <p>"And have you seen him?" said the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and heard him too, when he little thought I was near him," replied Guildford.</p>
               <p>"Oh indeed," said Styles; "and he blabbed, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"May perdition seize him, yes!" exclaimed Guildford, fiercely; "and to the very man to whom I was about to mortgage the estate."</p>
               <p>"Worse and worse; blabbed to Adams, did he?" said the lawyer, within a sardonic grin.—"Even so," said Guildford.</p>
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6520-00000018"/>
               <p>"Well, and what next, justice, eh?" inquired the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"Much must be done," he replied; "and in a short time, and well, too, mark me."</p>
               <p>"Go on," said Styles, "I'm not a child to be frightened at shadows, so you need not go so roundabout. What do you intend or want to do?"</p>
               <p>"Ryan must be silenced," said Guildford; "and that before midnight."</p>
               <p>"How? by a bribe?" asked the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"No, Styles, 'tis too late for that," replied the justice. "Ryan has another motive for betraying us now; he has a deep and deadly revenge against me. He knows that I tried to get the hangman his due when he was in trouble."</p>
               <p>"Ay, I advised you to keep out of that," said Styles.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, 'tis too late, now," said Guildford, impatiently; "I am come for assistance, not lectures, Styles. I tell you all is at stake, and we must be prompt and determined."</p>
               <p>"And did he tell the whole story to Adams?" asked Styles.</p>
               <p>"Listen and I will tell you all," said Guildford: "Adams asked yesterday to receive his quarter's interest on the thousand pounds; but I evaded, not only the payment, but the very mention of it, by striking into a bold track, and showing him the letter you wrote me for the purpose, threatening an instant execution in my house. At last I persuaded him to become mortgagee of Garron's Hill, or, at least, I got his promise to become so, which I knew perfectly well was only done to save himself, calculating that he would one day become master of the whole property for a mere song. While we were talking, Ryan, like my <unclear>evil</unclear> genius, stalked past the window, and I almost fear my agitation at seeing him was observed by Adams. However, a few glasses of wine, set us both all right again, and when we parted, it was on the full understanding that Adams was to become mortgagee of the property. Soon after Adams had left me, my servant informed me, that previous to his visit, a strange, ill-looking fellow had demanded an audience, but as I had previously given orders not to be disturbed, except for Adams, he had sent the rascal about his business. But it seemed that while Adams was with me the fellow called again and left a scrap of paper with the servant, which was of course delivered to me after Adams went. Here is the dirty scrawl, the purport of which was to inform me that I was requested to call, and it was especially added, 'alone,' that evening at the bog cabin hear the tuft of trees half a mile beyond Ryan's farm, when I should hear something of importance. I knew well that the bearer of this paper was Ryan, having seen him as I said, pass my library windows; and though it poured in torrents, I determined to go to the cabin, as it was of the greatest importance to keep him quiet till the mortgage was effected. Accordingly I ordered my horse, but afterwards changed my mind, and determined to walk, and wrapping my large cloak about me, I set off and walked on, till a flash of lightning showed me, not only the cabin, but a horse tied near to it, which at the very moment broke loose, and galloped off in a regular panic, but not before I had time to convince myself that it was the identical animal on which Adams was mounted when he came that evening to Garron's Hill. I heard the cabin door close, and cautiously approaching, listened without, and heard two voices, one of which I could swear was Ryan's, who was in the very middle of disclosing every particular respecting Garron's Hill to an individual whom I believed to be Adams himself. But the listener, whoever he was, spoke but seldom, and almost in a whisper, so I could not positively determine if it were Adams or not. Now, what think you of this, Styles?"</p>
               <p>"Did he say he would prove the forgery?" inquired Styles.</p>
               <p>"No," replied Guildford; "he only said that it was in his power to ruin me, and hang you, Master Styles."</p>
               <p>"Blood and turf! say you so?" exclaimed the terrified Styles, starting up. "Did he mention my name?"</p>
               <p>"No; he called you 'the lawyer,'" replied Guildford. "But sit down, man, sit down. Mix another tumbler of the cratur, and let us proceed coolly, and like men of courage and sense."</p>
               <p>"Courage will do no good," said Styles; "and cunning not much more; so we are ruined. I shall be hanged, Mr. Guildford, that's clear, unless I can slip the runners; and as to you, sir, you had better blow your brains out like a gentleman, and save the hangman the trouble of making a noose for you."</p>
               <p>"Not at all, Styles, not at all; do not alarm yourself, my good fellow, but hear me out," said Guildford. "Ryan's visitor left the cabin so abruptly, that, faith, he nearly stumbled over me! Then he paused, as if hesitating whether to go in again, and, as I guessed, warn Ryan that some eavesdropper had been there; but, at length, he walked on, and of course I made the best of my way to Garron's Hill."</p>
               <p>"And have you seen Adams to-day?" asked Styles.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Guildford; "I saw him not two hours ago, and gave him to understand that, for good reasons, on his quitting me last night, I rode off to Carlow."</p>
               <p>"And the mortgage?" said Styles.</p>
               <p>"He declines altogether," replied the justice; "pretending that his son is not agreeable to the measure."</p>
               <p>"Oh then, it's all clear," said the lawyer; "he was the man with Ryan in the cabin.</p>
               <p>"To be sure it is," said Guildford; "and moreover, when I began by stating to Adams how I got drenched as well as he, I purposely framed the commencement of my speech in such a way that I could mark well his manner, and he completely betrayed himself. I said, 'Adams, there should be no secrets between us, and therefore I tell you I listened:' he immediately began to raise himself in his stirrups, with 'Well, sir, and if you did, let me tell you,' on which I quietly bade him hear me out before he interrupted me, and recommenced it with, 'I listened at my library window, hoping every drop of rain would be the last, and then, in despair, ordered my horse and rode to Carlow.'"</p>
               <p>"Oh, and it's an illigant lawyer you'd have made!" exclaimed Styles, in admiration, that nearly made him forget his panic. "It's a boy for, cross-examining you'd have been. But it's clearer and clearer and I think you'd better have let him go on, and known the worst, instead of saying you had gone to Carlow."</p>
               <p>"No, no," said the justice, "because Adams must not know that it was I who overheard Ryan's disclosure of facts which are so fatal to us, and because the man who revealed those secrets must certainly die."</p>
               <p>"Die!" exclaimed Styles. "Who? How?"</p>
               <p>"Who? why Ryan," replied the justice; "as to how, remains to be considered; but it must be this very night."</p>
               <p>"And by what means, Mr. Guildford?" asked the lawyer, in a hoarse voice.</p>
               <p>"That I leave to you, Styles," he replied; "but the time must be before midnight, and the most favorable place will be on the summit of Bally Adams Hill, for the villain appointed to meet the farmer there at twelve to-night, calculating that he should have had an interview with me before then, and that they could arrange measures better for my destruction. But I have purposely kept out of the way, and if we can silence Ryan before the interview to-night, we need fear nothing; for as yet, Adams has no tangible proof to go upon. Bryant is in Carlow, Styles," he added, in a meaning tone.</p>
               <p>"I know it," said the lawyer; "I saw him yesterday, and he said that his gang were in the Rath, not far from the ruins on the Hill. But can you depend on this worthy foster brother of yours, Guildford? I see what you are driving at.</p>
               <p>"I can manage him, my good friend, upon certain conditions," replied the justice. "He is trusty and staunch, but he wants money and he likes drink; just now he is troublesome for both; but once get him to do this deed, and he must keep silent for his own sake, so we shall settle two birds with the same bullet, you see, Styles. But you must get me money, and have plenty of whisky ready, and any weapon Bryant may prefer."</p>
               <p>"Humph," said Styles; "it's easy to talk, Master Guildford; but my whisky bottle is empty, my purse has not seen the color of gold for many a day, and I have no other weapon beside the poker."</p>
               <p>"There is a remedy for all things, Styles, and I am not unreasonable, as you know," said the justice. "There is my purse: there is enough in it to satisfy all the requirements of our little plan; but remember, Styles, if Adams finds Ryan alive this night, and hears what more he can tell, your neck will not be worth a brass farthing; you are a dead man yourself from that moment. And there is no time to lose, for Bryant must go on foot to Bally Adams."</p>
               <p>"Cannot this be avoided?" asked Styles, who could not repress a shudder.</p>
               <p>"Impossible, Styles," replied the justice.</p>
               <p>"But have you well considered all the consequences of Ryan's death?" asked Styles again. "Remember, Adams will probably be the first to discover the body, and his suspicions will point to you, knowing that you have an interest in the fellow's death. Suppose he gives evidence of the tale the deceased related to him? This coupled with your anxiety to get him hanged some years since. cannot fail to draw suspicion on you. The gang that infest that wood are always pitched upon on such occasions, and a spot of blood on their clothes, or the <choice>
                     <sic>slighest</sic>
                     <corr>slightest</corr>
                  </choice> tittle of evidence against any one of them would be warrant enough to cause their apprehension; and in that case, they may peach against you as their direct employer."</p>
               <p>"And you," said Guildford, "would in your turn inform against me."</p>
               <p>"No," said the lawyer, coolly, "that would do me no good, for I should be hanged if I were to criminate you."</p>
               <p>"That does not follow," said Guildford. "I know, and you know, Master Lawyer, that there is such a thing as turning king's evidence to save one's own neck, and I am quite up to the danger of your doing so. I know perfectly well that your story if fully corroborated in every particular, would be too strong to allow me any hope of escape."</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said Styles, "we are in the same boat at present, and had better pull together. But why are you so much alarmed at the idea of this meeting between Ryan and Adams? Has not the fellow done his worst already?"</p>
               <p>"By no means," replied Guildford. There are a great many particulars yet untold, without which Adams could do little mischief. I know he has long cherished a secret enmity towards me, and would ruin me if he could; and what better chance could he have than to back Ryan's efforts to rake up old sores? Ryan could do comparatively little himself; but Adams's money would make a powerful enemy indeed."</p>
               <p>"But why should Adams have any hatred to you?" asked Styles.</p>
               <p>Because I have thwarted him in all his<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6520-00000019"/> plans at the sessions, and refused to expel the gang from the Rath," replied Guildford; "besides which, he won't forgive having been so nearly induced to risk his money on a doubtful security; you understand, Styles? "Humph, I don't like having anything to do in the business," said Styles, abruptly, "and that's the whole truth, Master Justice. There's great danger in it, and I have no fancy for dipping my fingers into other folk's boiling water. You may give Bryant your orders at once; I will have nothing to do with it. Better swing for forgery than murder any day; and I have got some conscience left, whatever you may think, and I won't bring the curse of blood upon it, I tell you."</p>
               <p>Styles drank his remaining toddy, and turned away with a look of sullen defiance that boded ill for the justice's plans.</p>
               <p>"Pshaw, Styles!" said the justice, "I did not think you were such a driveller, or I should not have wasted my time in trying to explain the state of matters to your drunken head. Are you such a fool, as not to see that if Ryan is not safely dealt with, he will never cease searching for the heir; and if he succeeds, what then, I should like to know?"</p>
               <p>"Still," said the lawyer gloomily, "there must be other ways to stop the fellow's mouth than murder."</p>
               <p>He uttered the word in a low tone, and with a furtive glance around, as if afraid that some apparition might be watching the unhallowed conference.</p>
               <p>"I tell you all other means would fail," said Guildford. "Death is the true and lasting security, and nothing else will silence a man who seeks revenge as he does."</p>
               <p>"Then you may manage it yourself," said Styles, stooping down to give a savage pull to the recreant stockings; "I will have nothing to do with his death, that I'm determined on. Now it's no use for you to attempt to bully me," he said, seeing the furious expression of the justice's face; "I know you perfectly well, Mr. Guildford, and you know me, and it's not safe for us to quarrel. But I tell you, you don't see the danger of what you are going to do; you don't understand, as I do, what a trivial circumstance will give a clue, not only to the actual agent, but to the instigator of a murder; and granting that you escape either the suspicion or the conviction of being concerned in it, remember that Adams's evidence would, at the very least, throw a stigma on your character, as the illegal possessor of Garron's Hill, and you will live with the double stain of fraud and murder on your name. And besides, have you no conscience left? Remember, we have already enough on our heads."</p>
               <p>"And I wish it had weighed yours down," said Guildford. "Why, (confound you!) you have turned Methodist parson all of a sudden!"</p>
               <p>"I am older than I was, and have less nerve than formerly, and perhaps a little more wisdom," replied Styles. "I don't want to die a greater scoundrel than I am already."</p>
               <p>Guildford smiled contemptuously, and inquired where he could find Bryant.</p>
               <p>"You will find him next door," replied Styles; "but I would advise you not to employ him in this business; he is very likely to bungle, and I have strong doubts as to his being trustworthy."</p>
               <p>"I know he is trustworthy," said Guildford, taking up his hat and rising as he spoke; "and as to bungling, <choice>
                     <sic>Byrant</sic>
                     <corr>Bryant</corr>
                  </choice> is not such a drivelling coward as you are. But it is rather hard that I should have all the trouble and risk thrown on my shoulders."</p>
               <p>"Not at all," sneered Styles. "I wonder who had the benefit of the villany, except yourself."</p>
               <p>"You lie!" exclaimed Guildford, angrily. "You had the reward for which you stipulated—what do you want more?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I wish for no more rewards," said Styles, doggedly; "at any rate, for such dirty work; and I won't be hung for murder to please you or any one else. So, if you like to risk your neck, and can get any one to put his own in the noose with you, I'd advise you to lose no time, for the day's getting on, and the whisky's made me sleepy."</p>
               <p>"Curse your drunken self!" exclaimed Guildford, furiously, as he rushed from the room, leaving Styles yawning hopelessly in his chair, too completely stupefied by the whisky to even take the trouble of ascertaining whether Guildford really did carry out his intention and go into the adjoining house, in quest of the worthy foster-brother of whom such doubtful mention had been made.</p>
               <p>Bryant, the distinguished individual in question, was a noted smuggler, though his gang were, more properly speaking, bandits, or as we term them in England, highwaymen. Bryant, their leader, was foster-brother to Guildford, but had led a life of considerable change and variety. He had resided for some years in England, had served in the navy, and finally become the head of a desperate gang of robbers. Part of these bandits were stationed in England, but the remainder, under the leadership of Bryant, had fixed themselves in the Rath on the estate of Garron's Hill. This flattering preference was due partly to the very favorable natural features of the spot, but no doubt also to the connection between Bryant and the lord of the estate on which it was situated.</p>
               <p>Bryant not only obtained various sums of money from his foster-brother, but he gained his permission to occupy the vast caverns in the thick woods, so well adapted for such a calling, and also received his promise to protect him and his fellow smugglers as much as a magistrate safely could, whenever they might be placed in critical circumstances, which it may be supposed was a not unfrequent occurrence. To do the owner of Garron's Hill justice, he had redeemed his promise, somewhat to the scandal of the neighborhood, and at no little risk to his own name for justice and impartiality. It was, therefore, not without reason that he considered he might count on Bryant's willingness, as well as ability to return these services, now that it was in his power to oblige his benefactor; nor was there much cause to fear any weak or timid scruples on the smuggler's part. Bryant was seldom troubled with qualms either of conscience or cowardice, and Guildford believed that he could amply secure his self-interest and cupidity on his side by more than one cogent argument; and so it proved, for within two hours from the time when Guildford quitted Styles, the smuggler was on his way to the Rath, and his worthy patron quietly trotting his way back to his own home, with a thoughtful but not dissatisfied expression in his harsh features.</p>

                  </choice> return to Bally Adams, where its master had arrived, after parting with the angry justice in no very amiable or contented mood. His first inquiry was for William.</p>
               <p>"Come into the study, lad," said Adams, after listening to a few details about the farm. "I have something of consequence to consult you about."</p>
               <p>William followed his father, and the old man at once plunged into the conversation that had taken place between himself and the justice.</p>
               <p>"And so he tried to make you believe that he went to Carlow?" said William.</p>
               <p>"Ay, lad, but he did not deceive me, though I let him fancy he did," replied his father. "It is better that he should think I do not know he overheard my conversation with Darby."</p>
               <p>"And you hold to your intention of meeting Paddy there to-night?" said William.</p>
               <p>"Certainly lad," he replied; "and not from curiosity alone, I promise you, for I feel it a matter of absolute duty to learn what Paddy has to say, and help him to unearth the artful fox, or, it may be, he'll poach on our preserves; eh, William?"</p>
               <p>William mused gravely for a moment or two, and then said, "And this is really your determination?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure it is, William," replied his father. "Why, have I not good reason to resent his conduct towards me? Has he not threatened me again and again at sessions—held me up to ridicule to the bench at Mary-borough, while I have been forced to submit, and hold the candle to the Devil, as the saying goes? Besides, did he not treat with indifference and scorn my reasonable remonstrances, as to his harboring that accursed gang of robbers in the Rath? And, to crown all his other offences against me, he has cheated me of my money, and tried to draw me into accepting a security not worth the parchment it would be drawn on. And can you doubt that I should not do my utmost to rid the county of such an impudent unprincipled scoundrel? I am surprised at you, William!"</p>
               <p>"No, no, sir, you mistake me. I was only anxious for your safety, and that of the loan you have already made to the individual you describe so attractively," replied William, with a half-concealed smile at his respected father's vehemence, for Adams had gradually worked himself up into a perfect fury, by the enumeration of his wrongs.</p>
               <p>"Safety, lad!" he repeated. "I'll take care of myself and my money too, I'll promise you. Why! if Guildford attempts any more jugglery with me, by Heavens I will hold <foreign xml:lang="LAT">in terrorem</foreign> over him my knowledge of his villany; and it is on this account, among others, that I want to consult Paddy Darby, that I may be fully prepared with my proofs, and be able to judge of the possibility of punishing this <emph>unjust justice;</emph> eh, William?"</p>
               <p>William was duly prepared to laugh at the paternal pun, and then the worthy landowner went on,</p>
               <p>"Now listen, William," said he; "you must get two long grey coats ready, such as the workmen wear, and in this disguise no one can recognise us; and prepare your pistols, that we may be ready for any emergency.</p>
               <p>At this moment dinner was announced, and the father and son, after a few trifling concluding arrangements, obeyed the summons.</p>
               <p>The young daughters of the house had returned from their archery practice full of life and animation, delighted with their success, and the cheerful anticipation of carrying off the prizes at the forthcoming meeting.</p>
               <p>Mabel May was comparatively silent and grave, though she received with her usual graceful ease the clumsy attentions of Mr. Adams and his sons; she only replied to their remarks and questions without originating or continuing any subject.</p>
               <p>"Has Miss Mabel been very unlucky this morning, Fan?" asked Edward, sneeringly, at last; "she seems terribly downcast about something."</p>
               <p>"Mabel unlucky?" cried Norah, gaily; "why, she is the best shot on the ground. Why, even Gerard Carlton could not beat her score, though he is considered a regular 'bold bowman,' as you know, Edward."</p>
               <p>"Gerard Carlton!" exclaimed William, suddenly. "What! was he there, Fan?"</p>
               <p>The vivid color rushed into Fanny's fair<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6520-00000020"/> check, and she looked timidly at her father, on whose face a heavy frown began to gather.</p>
               <p>"No, no," stammered Fanny, "that is, he happened to be passing by the meadow where we were practising, and Kathleen O'Donoghue asked him to join us, as he is such a capital archer, you know; but he was there only about half an hour before we came away."</p>
               <p>"And did he walk home with you, Miss Fan?" asked Edward, maliciously.</p>
               <p>"Only a little way," she replied; "and that is—".</p>
               <p>"That is, he and Fanny left poor Mabel and me to take care of ourselves," said Norah, who had not observed her father's gradually darkening looks, "I was quite out of breath with frying to overtake them."</p>
               <p>"I tell you what it is, Miss Adams," suddenly thundered the enraged master of Bally Adams, "it appears to me that you are conducting yourself in a very forward and discreditable manner towards that young man; and I desire that I may never again hear your name spoken of in connection with his."</p>
               <p>"Dear papa," said Fanny, tremblingly, the tears rushing into her pretty hazel eyes, "indeed, indeed, I never did—I never meant—only be is an old friend, and—"</p>
               <p>"Well, well, you know my mind on the matter now, Fanny," said her father, somewhat softened by her distress; "I hope it is as you say, and that you have only been thoughtless, and forgotten that you are no longer a child. But I desire particularly that you should not give the slightest encouragement to the young man's attentions, on pain of my severe and lasting displeasure. He is very well as a companion for your brothers, and I have nothing against the lad; but no one knows anything about him or his mother; and where there's mystery, I always say there's mischief; remember that, all of you. I expect Gerard Carlton is the son of some scampish nobleman—on the wrong side of the house, you see; and if you or your sister were to marry any base-born fortune hunter who cannot give you an honest name, and hold up his head like a true man, why not a penny of my money shall you have, dead or alive. And now you know my mind; and once said, always kept to with me, as you know pretty well; so, off with you to the drawing-room, and get us some tea ready. I have got business to transact this evening."</p>
               <p>The girls gladly obeyed the command, for Fanny's tears were flowing fast, and Mabel May's color had varied more than once during the angry speech of her host.</p>
               <p>"Norah, dear, will you see about the tea?" whispered Fanny, through her half-stifled sobs; "I will come to you in a few minutes; don't come with me, Mabel; I would rather be alone."</p>
               <p>Mabel did not, however, obey her friend's behest. She quietly but firmly drew Fanny's band through her arms, and passing the other round the sobbing girl's waist, she led her to her own room,</p>
               <p>"Fanny what is all this grief about?" she said, in strange, harsh tones. "Is your father right? Are you engaged to Gerard Carlton?"</p>
               <p>The tone was almost that of command, and the timid yielding Fanny involuntarily submitted to its influence.</p>
               <p>"No, oh no," she replied; "at least, he never asked—never told me; but—"</p>
               <p>"Never asked you to be his wife?" said Mabel,—"never told you that he loved—is that what you mean, Fanny?"</p>
               <p>Fanny murmured assent, and Mabel continued, in softer accents than she had yet spoken, "But he must have implied it, dear. You would not love him without he had given you some reason to think he cared for you; and you do love him, Fanny, do you not?"</p>
               <p>A convulsive pressure of the hand, and a lower inclination of the bowed head, was the only reply, but it came with the force of a thunderbolt to the heart of Mabel May.</p>
               <p>"And he knows—he suspects—he wishes," she said again, in the same clear, harsh tones.</p>
               <p>"I do not know—I think—I believe so," was the faintly murmured reply. "But oh, Mabel, don't despise me!—don't betray me, even to Norah! Remember, we have known each other from childhood."</p>
               <p>"Despise you, Fanny?" said Mabel: "no, I do not despise you and you may be sure I will not betray you;" I, at least, know what honor means. "But," she added, hurriedly, "this is no time for sentiment, Fanny, and you must command yourself, or your father will be even more displeased than is he now; another time we will speak of this: I must know all before I can judge. There, bathe your eyes—quick. I hear your father's voice in the hall. Let us go down at once."</p>
               <p>Mabel arranged her friend's hair in its usual bright, smooth braids, bathed her temples with eau de Cologne, and then they went together down the broad stairs—Fanny, with the relief and confidence which the sharing of the cherished secret produces in timid, clinging natures, and Mabel, with a bitter smile at the thought that the admonitions and restoratives she had administered to her friend were to the full as much needed by herself. There was a dull pain, a weight at her heart, which she forced herself to crush for the moment, without daring to dwell on the knowledge she had that day acquired, till she could think and weep, and school her heart in the silence and solitude of her chamber.</p>
               <p>They found the gentlemen of the family already in the drawing-room, and Mabel saw the quick stern glance which William gave her as they entered the room, and her woman's pride at once came to her aid. She forced herself to talk and smile with unusual gaiety in reply to the young man's well-meant, but somewhat wearisome remarks and ponderous sallies. She sang some Irish ballads in a style so spirited and true, that old Adams forgot his restless irritability, and declared that "by the powers, but she deserved to be an Irish girl, if she wasn't one already, which he almost believed she must be;" and in short, she completely succeeded in turning the attention of both father and son from poor Fanny's ill-concealed depression and in averting all suspicion from herself. But when they at last retired to rest at the early hour, which was the rule at Bally Adams, Mabel looked so wan and weary, that before quitting her for the night, Norah asked her more than once if she were well.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, only tired with the shooting," she replied, impatiently. "I am half asleep already—good night, dear; I really cannot keep my eyes open any longer."</p>
               <p>When the door was fairly closed and locked, and Mabel was at last alone with her grief, her galling sense of mortified pride, of slighted, betrayed affection, then the restraint was at last removed; the bitter, unfrequent tears burst forth,—tears such as over-tired manhood sometimes sheds, rather than those of woman's grief; and she cast herself on her bed, and choked her rising sobs on the pillow; a pillow that was not to bring rest to her aching heart for many a weary hour.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <p>MR. ADAMS and his son had impatiently awaited in the library the appointed hour for their expedition, and as the time drew near, the father grew restless and nervous, while William quietly examined his pistols, and made every possible preparation against known and unknown dangers without outwardly betraying any alarm or hesitation.</p>
               <p>When the hall clock sounded three-quarters past eleven the father and son rose, put on their long grey coats, and quietly left the house and the premises without observation. They preserved a profound silence as they proceeded to the Hill, William walking a few yards behind his father, and keeping a quick, sharp look-out on all sides, without detecting the slightest suspicious sight or sound. The night was unusually dark; neither moon nor stars lent their aid to guide their footsteps, so that Adams had advanced to within a few yards of the ruin without being aware of his exact position. He turned to give a few parting cautions to his son, when a pistol shot, evidently discharged from the interior of the building, whizzed past his ear.</p>
               <p>So great was the farmer's terror, and the shock of the bullet so stunning for the moment, that he fell to the ground as instantaneously as if he had been really shot, and for a few seconds remained unconscious of all around him.</p>
               <p>"My dear father, are you hurt?" anxiously inquired his son, who was at his side in a moment; has that cursed bullet struck you?"</p>
               <p>"No, no!" gasped Adams; "at least I think not. I am not wounded that I can feel; but what an escape for me! Adams of Bally Adams to be shot at like a hare or a pheasant. It is infamous—diabolical!"</p>
               <p>"Wait here quietly, my dear father," said William, "while I search the ruin. I shall find the rascal there, no doubt. He could not escape without my hearing him, though the darkness is so confoundedly thick."</p>
               <p>"For Heaven's sake, don't, William!" cried the terrified Adams; "there may be more than one, and you will be murdered as well as myself. There's no guarding against the blood-thirsty villains. But I'll set the police on them. I'll—"</p>
               <p>The intentions of the irate head of the house of Adams were lost upon his heir, for William had rushed forward—his pistol cocked, and the heavy-headed preserver he carried tightly grasped in his other hand. But his bravery was thrown away, the ruin was untenanted, and he stood, vexed and disconcerted, at a loss what to do next. The sound of crackling boughs in the distance told him, however, that some one was breaking through the hedge on the opposite side of the hill with desperate violence. Pursuit in the thick darkness and with such an advantage in distance, would be madness; and relinquishing for the time all hope of discovering the assassin, William rejoined his terrified parent, and they both made the best of their way back to Bally Adams.</p>
               <p>"What do you think of this, William?" asked Adams, when once more safely ensconced in his own peculiar chair in the library. "It appears to me a most desperate and diabolical business."</p>
               <p>"I am at a loss to imagine who can have any design on your life," said William; "I can hardly think you have so dastardly an enemy."</p>
               <p>"Who, William?—Why, Guildford, to be sure! The man who is indebted to me,—the man who dreads my knowledge of his villany, and hates me for it. He would gladly see me dead at his feet."</p>
               <p>"That is not unlikely," said William, quickly; "but still, I do not believe the shot was intended for you. I suspect it was meant for poor Paddy Darby,—a far more dangerous person to Guildford than yourself, my dear father."</p>
               <p>"Faith, and you may be right," said Adams; "and if so he has had a lucky escape as well as myself; but why did he not come, do you think?"</p>
               <p>"He may not have seen Guildford, and thought it useless to keep the appointment," replied the young man; "or he may have<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6520-00000021"/> been there before us, and fallen a victim to the rascal's treachery. One could not be certain, in that pitch darkness, if a dozen men had been murdered."</p>
               <p>"But we could hear, lad," said the farmer, who was fast recovering his shrewdness, now that the bewildering effect of the fright was subsiding. "A pistol could not have been discharged without our knowing it, though he might have been finished by other means, poor fellow!"</p>
               <p>"I will search the interior of the ruin tomorrow," said William. "I am almost sorry I went inside to-night, as my own footsteps will deceive me."</p>
               <p>"Well, we had better go off to bed," said Adams. "I am fairly knocked up; and we can do no more to-night, that's certain."</p>
               <p>They inspected the fastenings of the house with unusual care, and then retired for the night.</p>
               <p>A bullet whizzing past one's head is not precisely calculated to ensure calm and quiet slumbers immediately afterwards. Adams was doomed, therefore, to another restless night; and when he did fall into a slumber, dreams of bullets, daggers, and pitfalls haunted him till he woke up with a terrified start, and actually sat up in bed to convince himself that it was but a troubled vision, and that he was safe in his own comfortable bed in his house at Bally Adams. But even then he only slept again to be haunted by the same wretched dreams; and at last he rose, at five in the morning, unrefreshed, and in anything but placable or amiable mood.</p>
               <p>Such fits of irritability were not very unfrequent with the worthy farmer, nor always produced by equally vexations circumstances as might plead his excuse on the present occasion. Indeed, a whole crowd of annoying and ominous visions and memories rose up before the unfortunate gentleman's mind's eye, as he made a hurried toilet and descended down stairs, to roar out in stentorian tones for his daughters and his breakfast, neither of which summonses was obeyed as promptly as his unreasonable irritation required.</p>
               <p>As he stamped up and down the dining-room, waiting their appearance, all the annoying events of the previous day recurred in even exaggerated proportions to his feverish brain. The probability of his losing the thousand pounds due to him by Guildford; the attempt of the preceding night; the fears for his own safety that it naturally created; and, to crown all, an uneasy jealousy of Gerard Carlton, both for his son and his daughter, combined to work up the farmer into a most ungovernable state of vexation and alarm, that made him an object of terror and avoidance to the whole household. Poor Fanny carefully kept out of his way, at the certain peril of a severe lecture at some subsequent part of the day; but Norah, more fearless by nature, and clearer in conscience than her sister, bravely appeared to bear the brunt of the storm.</p>
               <p>"So," began Adams, "you have condescended to appear at last, have you, Miss Norah—and pray, where is your sister?"</p>
               <p>"She is not well," replied Norah, "and I persuaded her to keep in her bed a little longer. She has a bad headache."</p>
               <p>"A headache!" growled the farmer; "what business have girls with headaches, I should like to know? It's nothing but perverseness that brings them. And I tell you what it is, girl; if I find that Fanny dares to carry on any clandestine meetings with that young mushroom that nobody knows anything about, or you back her in any such disobedience to my wishes, out of this house you will go, and get a living as you can. D'ye hear me, girl? Why do you stand shaking the coffee-pot over the cloth in that way, without condescending to answer me?"</p>
               <p>Norah was a girl of spirit—a true Irish girl, with the beautiful grey eyes and rich hair, and ready wit of her country women, and though not so really beautiful as the fair, statue-like Fanny, far more attractive, and more popular in their small circle than her quiet sister. She quietly finished the operation so aspersed by her father, and then looked fearlessly in the thunder-cloud face of the irate Adams.</p>
               <p>"Papa," said she, "you are unjust to poor Fanny, to say nothing of myself. Gerard Carlton has been like a brother to us both since we were children; and unless he has done anything wrong, it is very unlike you to wish us to turn against an old friend."</p>
               <p>"Silence, girl!" thundered the father, though he fidgeted uneasily and fixed his eyes on his plate, instead of on his daughter's face as he spoke—sure signs that he was really giving way at heart. "I don't want anything of the kind. It's you, or rather your sister, that wants to turn a friend into a lover, and I won't hear of any such beggarly sons-in-law, I promise you."</p>
               <p>Norah had her own private ideas on the subject of both her sister's and Gerard Carlton's supposed delinquencies; but for more than one reason she kept them to herself.</p>
               <p>"I do not think either Gerard Carlton or Fanny would ever dream of disobeying you, father," she replied, quietly, "if you will only be kind to them, and not take such fancies into your head. I am sure Gerard is as respectful, and thinks as much of you as if he were your son; and—"</p>
               <p>"Ay, ay, no doubt," said the somewhat mollified parent. "He wishes he were the son of Adams of Bally Adams, instead of the son of nobody at all, as one may say. But he won't be my son-in-law. I promise him. I have worked hard for you all, and I mean you to do well, and take a standing in the county. There's William, I have arranged a match for him that will do credit to the family; and he's quite willing to carry out my plans, like a dutiful son as he is, and I expect you all to follow his example. Ah, there he is. Call him in, Norah, and then go to your sister, and bid her prepare to meet me with a cheerful face on my return, and no more nonsensical headaches, and I'll pass it over this once."</p>
               <p>Norah gladly obeyed, tolerably content with the result of her diplomacy, but scarcely so sanguine as to the success of the plans alluded to by her father, and which she tolerably well understood. Norah inherited much of her father's acuteness without the blind prejudices and violence of temper that sometimes obscured his native shrewdness of perception; and having at present no love affairs of her own on hand, she had leisure to form a pretty correct judgment of those going on around her; and the young Irish girl divined tolerably well that, whatever might be the real state of Mabel May's heart, it decidedly had no idea whatever of giving itself in exchange for that of Mr. William Adams of Bally Adams, with his heirship and handsome person into the bargain. However, she kept her own counsel, and only communicated so much of the morning's conversation as she deemed necessary to secure her sister's immunity from any harsh comments or harsher threats on their father's return.</p>
               <p>While Norah thus speculated and arranged her own course of conduct, her brother William and his father were in equally anxious deliberation in the breakfast-room.</p>
               <p>"William, I am going off to Garron's Hill," was Adam's first announcement on his son's entrance.</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" said the young man doubtfully. "And what do you propose doing there?"</p>
               <p>"Find out, if possible, the truth; look the rascally, murderous impostor in the face, and see how he will dare confront me," said the excited Adams.</p>
               <p>"Humph!" said William; "and do you suppose you will gain anything by your visit? Do you know Guildford's character so little as to expect to read him so easily?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know, William," said Adams; "any way, it will satisfy my mind, and surely I must find out something."</p>
               <p>"Well, if you are determined go," observed William, "you might tell him a man was shot on the hill last night; and if you do it abruptly, and without any preparation, it is possible you may judge something from his face. He can hardly help some betrayal of himself at so sudden an announcement."</p>
               <p>"Right, boy, right; very good, yes, yes; trust me, I'll manage it—I'll probe him," said Adams.</p>
               <p>"But be careful not to let out that you were near the ruin till alarmed by the sound of the pistol, which made you at once hasten there," said William.</p>
               <p>"Never fear me, boy, never fear," said Adams; "I am always straightforward, you know; I always tell my story like an honest man."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me; but in this case I would advise your being a little 'crooked,' or, at any rate, reserved in your communications," said William. "Better not say a word more than is actually necessary."</p>
               <p>"True, true," assented Adams. "I will say a man was shot,—seen dead, and that when I sent my people for the body it had been conveyed away, and all trace of it lost—won't that do, William?"</p>
               <p>"Admirably," he replied: "because it will be better for him to believe Paddy is dead, whether it is so or not. We can then watch his next move in the affair of the mortgage. But I would be careful to lay the information before him, simply in his character as a magistrate, so that he dare not disregard it, or give you to understand you are an impertinent meddler."</p>
               <p>"He had better not, lad, or it may be the worse for him," said Adams; "but, William, have you examined the interior of the ruin?"</p>
               <p>"I have," replied William, "and I am of opinion that only one man was in it when the shot was fired; and I am certain I only heard one step in the distance. But here comes Black Jack,—you will be back to dinner?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, boy; he is not likely to ask me to take a cut of his mutton, you may be sure. Good-bye, and mind, don't be out of the way till I return."</p>
               <p>William assisted his father to mount, and then, seeing the breakfast-room still empty, he went off to the various duties devolving on him, hoping to be rewarded on his return by a ride with Mabel May.</p>
               <p>In a quarter of an hour afterwards that fair girl entered the room with a pale, unrefreshed look, which spoke of a troubled night, and seated herself wearily near the window, her head resting on her hand, and her eyes fixed apparently on the fair, smiling prospect before her. But, whatever objects occupied her eyes, her thoughts were evidently too deeply engrossed to be aware of surrounding objects, and Norah had entered and laid her hand on her shoulder before she was aware that she was not alone.</p>
               <p>"Mabel, what is it?" she asked; "dreaming of absent friends, or mourning over your sins of omission and commission among your Dublin admirers? Come, confess, there's a darling; you know I always was mother-confessor at school, because—"</p>
               <p>"It was no use trying to keep anything from those wicked Irish eyes of yours, Norah," said Mabel; "but we are older and wiser now, you know; and—"</p>
               <p>"Older, perhaps; more's the pity," said Norah; "but wiser I neither am, nor mean to be: first, because I was always wise enough in all conscience; and secondly, because I have no taste for being especially dismal, and generally disagreeable, as all wise people are."</p>
               <p>"It can't be helped, Norah," said Mabel, smilingly; "time will bring care and changes, do what we will."</p>
               <p>"Bless the venerable dame; how edifying<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6520-00000022"/> ingly she talks!" cried the girl, gaily; "but I am too hungry to argue just now; and, as Fanny is going to have her tea and toast in bed, we may as well have some breakfast at once."</p>
               <p>The girls sat down to the tempting Irish breakfast which Norah's summons soon brought to the table, and for a few moments the fair visitor hoped that the question she had evaded was completely forgotten by her gay friend. But no sooner had Norah dispensed the hot coffee, eggs, and home-made cakes, which smoked so temptingly on the table, than she renewed the subject.</p>
               <p>"Now, Mabel," said she, "I have three leading questions, as Edward calls them, to put, and in my moderation I will confine myself to them, if you answer with becoming frankness."</p>
               <p>"I will make no rash promises," replied Mabel, smiling rather constrainedly; "but I am all attention, madcap."</p>
               <p>"Well, then," said Norah, "first, why, and when, and how did you know Gerard Carlton in Dublin?"</p>
               <p>"Three questions already, Norah; but one answer will do," replied Mabel, the bright crimson flashing her cheek; "I met Mr. Carlton at several houses of my aunt's friends, with other of the students."</p>
               <p>"And did he ever talk to you about his family or friends, Mabel, or seem to have any connections in Dublin?" asked the girl, more seriously.</p>
               <p>"What an absurd idea, Norah!" said Mabel, rather pettishly. "He would certainly not tell strangers of matters that his old friends do not seem to be acquainted with."</p>
               <p>"I don't know, Mabel; there is no rule of propinquity or naturalisation where—what shall I say—regard and confidence are concerned," said Norah. "However, I am bound to accept your implied negative, though I am half-doubtful, and quite disappointed about it."</p>
               <p>"Are you so interested or so curious about Mr. Carlton's antecedents, Norah?" said Mabel, stooping over a plate of broken egg-shells as she spoke.</p>
               <p>"Well, I am distinguished for extreme candor, so I will reply 'both,'" said Norah, gaily; "but I may venture to confess to you, Mabel pet, that I do really and truly wish for the cloud over Gerard's history to be cleared up. I love him like a brother."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps it is a prophetic affection," said Mabel, bitterly.</p>
               <p>"I will tell you, Mabel," said Norah, who did not appear to hear the interlude, "what I never ventured to confess, even to Fanny, for fear of her being terribly shocked; but you must remember, I was only about eight years old when I was guilty of the escapade in question. It was one very hot Summer's night, and I took it into my mischievous little <unclear>head</unclear> to get out of the window from our nursery bed-room, and scamper about the grounds in the moonlight; and capital fun it was, I can tell you, with our old dog Patrick for a companion. At last, I thought I would go a little bit down the lane, where the moon was shining most beautifully—toward the top of the hill; you know, Mabel. Well, Patrick soon went off into the wood, and I was afraid either to call him, or go back without him, and there I stood, shivering and trembling with fright more than chilly, when I heard voices inside the wood, I was more terrified than ever, but I had the sense to crouch down under the brushwood, so that no one could see me, and there I waited, all in a cold perspiration, and shaking enough to betray my hiding-place if any one had looked that way. Only fancy me, abel!"</p>
               <p>"And what did you hear to reward your daring?" asked Mabel, in a tone of assumed carelessness.</p>
               <p>"I heard what I have never forgotten, Mabel," replied Norah. "It was a man and woman who were talking, and I will tell you what the woman said just as I first heard them."</p>
               <p>"'I tell you, James,' said she, 'it will be discovered some day. Why, I saw the lad this very day, and he's as like his father as he can be.'</p>
               <p>"'What then, you fool!' said the man, angrily. 'They might be as like as two beans, or two sheep, and yet they might never come within miles of each other. Why, he's over the seas long and long ago; and she—I mean the mother—doesn't even suspect; how should she?"</p>
               <p>"'Murder will out, they say,' said the woman; 'but I think it's the same in all other crimes. I don't believe, James, but what every child does know its own father, and a parent knows his child; and then she, poor soul! I am very sorry for her—she does look so sad, and so resigned like. He's a villain after all, far or near, and I only wish he may be found, that's all, only—'</p>
               <p>"'Hush, hush!' said the man, eagerly; 'don't burn your fingers with other folk's porridge, Molly; it's as much as you'll do to cool your own, I promise you. But as to Mrs. Carlton, as they call her—'</p>
               <p>"Just then, Mabel, Patrick came rushing back to me, and I jumped up, and he and I darted back to the gate like lightning, and I was in my room and in bed before I well stopped to get my breath, I was so terribly frightened. It makes my heart beat now."</p>
               <p>"And you never told any one what you heard?" exclaimed Mabel, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"No, I dared not at the time," replied Norah; "and I thought it better to keep my own counsel until I got older. It could do no good then, I thought, and might do harm."</p>
               <p>Mabel looked earnestly at the young girl, who concealed so much real sense and thoughtfulness under her gay exterior, and then she bent forward and kissed her tenderly.</p>
               <p>"Norah, I honor you," she said, warmly. "You would shame numbers who pretend to give wisdom and teach self-control. But, dear girl, did you never see nor hear more of these strange, wretched people?"</p>
               <p>"I am not sure whether the man is not in this neighborhood still," replied Norah; "but of course it is only by his voice I could know him. Do you not think, Mabel, that their conversation referred to Gerard and his mother?"</p>
               <p>"I should think so," said Mabel, hesitatingly; "and yet Mrs. Carlton looked so pure, amiable, and high-bred, that I cannot believe—"</p>
               <p>"I do not believe anything ill of her, you may be certain," said Norah, warmly; "and Fanny adores her. But Mabel, suppose Gerard should really be the son of some grand person, what a revolution that would make in all the politics of Athy and Bally Adams, and perhaps—"</p>
               <p>Mabel had here the misfortune to drop her pretty china tea-cup, which lay in fragments at her feet, and the apologies, and incidental bustle it occasioned, broke off the sentence.</p>
               <p>When the girls were once more quietly sipping a warm fresh cup of coffee, supplied by Norah's rapid arrangements, Mabel hastily prevented any possible renewal of the subject by saying playfully, "Now for your third question, Norah, and then I will go and inquire after Fanny's headache. Make haste, or I shall consider the agreement null and void."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, Mabel, please to account for your heavy eyes and pale cheeks this morning," said Norah. "They are as mysterious as my father's. There must have been some restless sprite at work in the house last night."</p>
               <p>"I fear there was," said Mabel, "and in a more serious sense than you mean, Norah. Did you not hear a pistol shot somewhere near the house."</p>
               <p>Norah turned somewhat pale; she knew that such sounds boded ill, in such a neighborhood as theirs, but she would not needlessly alarm her more timid guest, and she replied lightly, "Oh, some unlucky poacher, I suppose; it shows your city breeding, Mabel, to attach importance to such a common occurrence. However, I will tell William what you heard, and he will soon ascertain the cause of your alarm."</p>
               <p>Mabel said no more, but she inwardly determined to ascertain for herself, if she had any more such disturbing occurrences, for in truth she had noticed more than one suspicious circumstance in the household during the last few days, and the mingled romance and natural courage of her character prompted the wish to elucidate the mystery, and possibly prevent some threatened danger to her friends. However, she kept her intentions to herself for the present, and after a few careless words of assent to Norah's explanation, left the room to pay her visit to the invalid. But the strange incident related by Norah was still uppermost in her thoughts, and she was not sorry to find that Fanny was already dressing, and that her presence could therefore be dispensed with for that morning.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <p>ADAMS thoughtfully pursued his way to Garron's Hill without interruption for some time; but when not far from the memorable spot where he had parted with Guildford on the previous day, he met his son Edward on his way from Carlow.</p>
               <p>"Why, Edward, lad, how is this?" he said, angrily, "Have you taken French leave of the office? I'm sure it's too early days for you to get a holiday."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Crouch is away, gone to Dublin for a week," replied Edward; "and as there was nothing to do, and the first of September at hand, I thought I might as well come over to Bally Adams, and see about my gun. Nothing like being prepared, you know, father."</p>
               <p>"Ay, lad, keep to that through life, and you'll do," said Adams. "But I'm on my way to Justice Guildford's."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" said Edward; "I saw him myself in Carlow yesterday."</p>
               <p>"About what time, lad?" demanded Adams.</p>
               <p>"About three or four in the afternoon," was the reply. "He was with a strange, dark, ill-looking fellow, whom I should be very sorry to meet alone on a dark night. He's no good, I'm certain."</p>
               <p>"Were they on foot?" asked Adams.</p>
               <p>"The squire was on his hack," replied Edward, "and the man walked by his side; but he fell back as soon as they were observed, as if only having been asking some question of the justice."</p>
               <p>"Hum—it might be one of his tenants," said Adams; "but go on, lad, I shall see you again at dinner-time, before you leave."</p>
               <p>Putting his spur to Black Jack, the farmer rode off, pondering on Edward's information. He had arrived at the group of trees not far from the bog cabin, when he heard a rustle, and a low, "Whist, whist!" and looking round in some terror, he to his great relief recognised the face of Paddy Darby, half hidden by the trees, and saw his bony hand making signs to him to approach, Paddy led the way in silence to a spot in the very middle of the plantation completely concealed from observation; and here Adams, obeying his guide's silent request, alighted from his horse, and sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree, close to the man himself.</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6520-00000023"/>
               <p>"Well, Paddy," he began; "so you did not <unclear>come</unclear> last night; and faith, it was a lucky thing that you did not."</p>
               <p>"Why so, your honor?" asked Paddy.</p>
               <p>"Because you might have chanced to have got what I narrowly escaped, replied Adams,—"a bullet through your heart."</p>
               <p>"<unclear>Truth</unclear>, and is it so?" exclaimed Paddy; "well, that bullet was meant for me, that's certain, for Guildford heard me talking to you the other night."</p>
               <p>"Are you sure of that?" asked Adams, anxiously.</p>
               <p>"Quite sure, your honor," replied Paddy? "for I know he dried himself at Ryan's farm hard by."</p>
               <p>"Then it was he who brushed past me; I knew it," exclaimed Adams, "the dirty villain!"</p>
               <p>"True for you, your honor," said Paddy; "the divil's always at hand they say; and who could have thought of his venturing out on such a night. But where are you bound for now, your honor, if I may be so bold?"</p>
               <p>"To Garron's Hill," was the reply; "I mean to tell the justice that a man was shot near my house last night, and see what effect it will have on him."</p>
               <p>"Arrah now, your honor, be aisy," said Paddy; "say nothing about it; let him hear of it from those he employed in the murtherous business. But what did you do, your honor, when the thafe of a bullet whistled past you?"</p>
               <p>"Fell down flat on my face, Paddy. Faith, I thought I was killed outright; as well be shot as frightened to death, you know."</p>
               <p>"So much the better, sir," said Paddy. "The fellow who fired the pistol will doubtless think his aim was true, and that I am dead. It's raal luck, it is, for the justice to believe I am safe and gone; and my disappearing from this part of the country will confirm him in the idea; while (bad luck to him, the spalpeen!) I'll be hard at work, head and hands, for his destruction. But take my advice, your honor, and don't go to Garron's Hill to-day, on any pretence; the less you appear to know of his villany the better for you and for justice, take my word for it, your honor."</p>
               <p>"And where are you going, then, Paddy?" asked Adams.</p>
               <p>"To Dublin, your honor, and maybe, to London," replied Paddy; "I am going in search of a seafaring comrade of mine, who is a very important witness for me, and I heard surely that he was on board an Indiaman, and expected home some time ago."</p>
               <p>"But why did you not come last night?" said Adams. "I kept my appointment to the minute."</p>
               <p>"Faith, and I ought to be asking your honor's pardon," said Paddy; "but I could not get to see the justice all day; and, as I had nothing to tell you, I thought the less we were seen together the better. But it's meself is glad to chance to see you to-day, just snug and quiet like, for I've got a good deal to say, your honor. You see, I dare not now go before the justice, or write to him, nor try to get money from him as I in tended, for it's better for him to think me dead—safe out of his way. Now, if your honor would just let me have a few pounds to go on with, to finish this business, it's your own and interest, and thanks besides you'd get from the heir when he comes to his own, as he certainly will, or his childer, if he is dead and gone."</p>
               <p>"Then he had children?" said Adams, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"'Deed now, your honor, don't be after asking me any questions. It's meself knows what I am about, and you'll not repent it if you trust Paddy; he's not the boy to desave a raal gintleman like your honor."</p>
               <p>Adams drew from his pocket a well-filled pocket-book, and counted out two five-pound notes.</p>
               <p>"Long life to your honor," said Paddy; "but don't you come here any more, nor must I be seen near your house. You shall hear from me from Dublin, or wherever else I may be."</p>
               <p>"But, in the meanwhile," said Adams, doubtfully, "he will mortgage the estate, or sell it, and be off with the money, for he has already cut down all the timber."</p>
               <p>"Not a stick of which should he have touched," said Paddy, "if I had been in the country; bad luck to the row that drove me from it; but, as to the mortgaging, why, let him do it; it's only so much the worse for the poor fool who advances him money on such security. It's your own luck, your honor, that you were not the victim. But troublous times are coming for the justice, and it's bad luck to the man who wants Paddy Darby's life, that's all."</p>
               <p>"Well, but I should like just to touch his conscience a bit by relating the occurrence," said Adams.</p>
               <p>"Arrah now, honey, be aisy," said Paddy; "It will do no good, but much harrum, depend on it. Get back your money, or the interest of it first, and then you can throuble yourself about his conscience; and if it isn't probed by that time, faith it will never be touched at all, for divil a stiver will you touch, principal nor interest."</p>
               <p>"But I've his bond," said Adams, "and will arrest him."</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Paddy; "your honor must excuse me, but you don't half know him yet. However, I wish you luck, my honey, and the Lord prosper you! You shall hear from me, niver fear."</p>
               <p>For an instant Paddy had disappeared in the brushwood, and Adams, remounting Black Jack, rode slowly back to his house. His first act on entering it was to look out the bond, which, on examination, he could not doubt to be a properly attested legal document in all respects, and replacing it with a lightened heart in his bureau, he once more summoned William to his library, and continued in close conference till dinner was announced, discussing all that he had heard from Paddy Darby, and the propriety of the course which he had urged him to pursue, and last, though not least, the probability of his recovering the amount of his bond from his treacherous debtor.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <p>IT was in the evening of the last day of August that Mr. Guildford impatiently paced to and fro in the shrubbery, evidently expecting some one who as yet delayed in coming. The shrubbery was behind the house, and joined a conservatory leading to his private room, or library, a sanctum into which few had the honor of being admitted, and which had been the scene of many a dark and unhallowed plot, which might some day recoil on their author.</p>
               <p>As the night wore on, the anxiety and impatience of Guildford increased; and when the clock struck eleven, and his expected visitor came not, he could no longer control his irritation, but starting up, once more paced the apartment in deep and gloomy thought, listening ever and anon at the conservatory door, and giving vent to expressions of indignant vexation.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible!" he exclaimed. "Has Bryant, too, proved a traitor? Can it be that he ventures to tamper with me? By Heaven, if I thought he did, I'd—"</p>
               <p>Here he stopped, for his quick and suspicious ear caught the sound of a low and gentle whistle, so soft, that had a stranger heard it, he might have imagined it but the wind, passing through the keyhole of the door. But Guildford well knew that familiar signal, and starting to the door of the conservatory, admitted his worthy foster brother, Bryant. In silence he let his visitor into the sanctum, where whisky and glasses stood on the table, one of which he filled and presented to the smuggler, who received it with a well-pleased nod.</p>
               <p>"Here's to our success," said Bryant, emptying the glass, and bending his dark eyes on the anxious face of his employer.</p>
               <p>Bryant was a man about forty-five years of age, and in stature about five feet ten inches; thick set, broad shouldered, with a countenance capable of <unclear>wearing</unclear> the most ferocious or the most bland and agreeable expression, as the case might be. To-night, he of course assumed the more subservient and winning look, as he stood respectfully before his patron foster brother. Luckily for Guildford, the robber had never become acquainted with the doubts as to his foster brother's lawful possession of his estate, but imagined that he had come into his good fortune by honest means, and the favor of his old master, Michael Garron. So long therefore as the possessor of Garron's Hill continued to supply him with money and to protect him by his magisterial authority, Bryant was, as in duty bound, his very useful and humble servant. Had he happened to have got scent of the danger impending over his employer, and the chicanery described by Paddy Darby, as the real means employed to obtain the property, his demands would have increased in frequency and amount, and his manner become proportionately more bold and familiar. Though a ready and obedient tool in the present affair, without presuming to inquire the reason why his wealthy patron should be so anxious to remove so humble and apparently harmless an individual as Paddy, yet he was not less alive to the singularity of the proceeding, and after forming various conjectures in his own mind as to the affair, he had determined to learn from Guildford, during the present interview, the true state of the case, and the real offence given by the unlucky Irishman.</p>
               <p>"Is it done?" inquired Guildford, the instant Bryant had replaced the empty glass on the table.—"It is," replied Bryant.</p>
               <p>"And the body?" said Guildford.</p>
               <p>"By this time in the vaults beneath the Rath," replied Bryant.</p>
               <p>"'Tis well," said Guildford. "Then it must be safe—and you are certain it is all right?"</p>
               <p>"I never miss, that's certain, though the night was plaguy dark," replied Bryant; "for I heard his death-cry, and left him."</p>
               <p>"You left him?" said Guildford.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Bryant; "but I sent the lads from the wood for the body, taking care to leave the place instantly myself; but I know perfectly well I can depend on my men."</p>
               <p>"Surely, Bryant, surely—oh, all's well, then; but I was fearful the fellow would not be true to his time and place."</p>
               <p>"He <unclear>came</unclear> to a minute your honor," replied Bryant; "but, thanks to my sure aim, he did not enter the ruin to keep his appointment."</p>
               <p>"The villain!" exclaimed Guildford. "It served him right. Well, Bryant, here is your reward," he said, opening, as he spoke, a well-filled purse, the contents of which the smuggler quickly deposited in his pocket. "And how goes on the gang, Bryant?" he next asked.</p>
               <p>"My trade has been dull of late, your worship," replied Bryant; "and smuggling is a dangerous traffic now-a-days."</p>
               <p>"Humph, ay, I suppose so," said Guildford; "I can't do much for you though, Bryant; I'm rather out of elbows myself, and am about to mortgage Garron's Hill."</p>
               <p>"Mortgage Garron's Hill!" exclaimed the smuggler.</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6520-00000024"/>
               <p>"Ay, indeed," said Guildford: "these hounds, trustees, gluttonous guests have fairly ruined me."</p>
               <p>"I told you so if you remember," said Bryant; "but as to mortgaging the estate, you will never succeed, for who, think you, in these turbulent times, will advance money on property which may be seized, or the house burned down, by either one party or another."</p>
               <p>"I had scarcely considered that," said Guildford; "but it only gives me double cause to curse that—ah, well, would that you had given the fellow his leaden bullet three days sooner, it would have been worth some thousand to me."</p>
               <p>Bryant looked curiously at the gloomy face of his patron, scarcely comprehending the connection of the two events.</p>
               <p>"Is the deed, then, without any benefit?" he asked, with a keen glance at his patron. "I am bad enough; but don't care to spill blood unnecessarily."</p>
               <p>"No, oh no; it's all right, and I am perfectly satisfied," said Guildford, hurriedly; "only, you see, I am not quite myself just now; this mortgage business hampers and annoys me; you must not mind it if I am a little unreasonable. But I always know a friend from a foe, Bryant, and reward accordingly, either for good or evil done to me. And, by the way, you know old Adams?"</p>
               <p>"Of course," said Bryant, wonderingly.</p>
               <p>"And his house—are you tolerably acquainted with it?" asked Guildford.</p>
               <p>"There are few in this neighborhood that I am not pretty familiar with," replied Bryant; "but what's in the wind now?"</p>
               <p>"He keeps a good deal of ready money by him. I fancy," said Guildford.</p>
               <p>"So much the greater fool he," said Bryant, his eyes flashing eagerly at the hint thrown out; "just the one for wise men to profit by. But do you know in which of the rooms his strong-box is kept?"</p>
               <p>"I do," replied Guildford; "and if I put you on the right scent, you must do a little business for me at the same time."</p>
               <p>"How?" asked Bryant; "keep a slice of the plunder for you, is that it? Well, all right: I'm always honorable in such affairs."</p>
               <p>Guildford's blood boiled at the familiar insolence of the tone; but he felt that the deed just committed at his instigation had placed him in the man's power, and he was forced to choke down his irritation as he best could.</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken, Bryant," he said; "I have no wish to share your booty; take all that you can get. But it's another little matter that I want you to manage, which will fit in with your own business without any trouble."</p>
               <p>"No trouble to serve a friend, Mr. Guildford," said the man, pouring out another glass of whisky. "What is it?"</p>
               <p>"Adams has an awkward bond of mine for one thousand pounds," said Guildford. "As it happened, I received the money at his house, and I saw him deposit the bond in an old bureau which he kept in a room he calls his study, at the back of the house looking into the orchard, and where I caught sight of a goodly number of notes and sovereigns in a sort of secret drawer which opened with a spring that could be soon found. It's strange how careless those grasping, saving men are in some things; but that's all the better for us just at present. Now, mark me, Bryant, as I have put you in the way of such a haul at the old fellow's cash, you must at the same time get the bond and all the papers you can lay hold on, for if you only chose out the bond it would bring suspicion on me at once."</p>
               <p>"Right again," said Bryant. "Mr. Guildford, you need never want a living. If you were to lose Garron's Hill, you'd get a better fortune in the gentleman freebooter line."</p>
               <p>"Lose Garron's Hill! What do you mean, fellow?" exclaimed Guildford fiercely.</p>
               <p>"Mean; why, nothing, to be sure," replied Bryant; "but there have been stranger things than that, Mr. Guildford; and if I were to tell all I know, some folks in this very neighborhood would be in a very different position to what they are now. But it don't suit me, you see; and I know how to hold my tongue. But, as I say, Mr. Guildford, you've a clever head, that's certain, and I will not baulk your fancy, or spoil your scheme by any scruples. My son Ronald is now with me, a real dashing Londoner you know, who could pick a lock in first-rate style with a crowquill."</p>
               <p>"Ay, Bryant, you brought the boy up well," said Guildford.</p>
               <p>"And an apt scholar he has been, and of mighty use to me; but he's getting almost too aspiring and grand in his ideas," replied Bryant. "He's got a scheme in hand now that will make him a gentleman if it succeeds; but then he is not in all my secrets, and I could spoil his sport any day."</p>
               <p>"Well, you won't spoil mine, I hope," said Guildford.</p>
               <p>"No fear," said Bryant. "But suppose Mr. Adams should get our gang apprehended on suspicion?"</p>
               <p>"Leave that to me," said Guildford; "he must come here for a warrant, which I must grant, and pretend anxiety for the detection of the culprit; but you must manage so as to give me a proper pretext for dismissing the charge when heard. Don't have a stiver of the stolen property in your possession; but send me the bond on the instant. So long as no part of the missing articles are found in your keeping, I can refuse to commit; and I will."</p>
               <p>"Ay, you are a real justice of the peace," laughed Bryant; "a deep one, any way."</p>
               <p>"Too deep for the wool-headed old farmer," replied Guildford; "but beware of his dogs, and remember he has fire-arms in his house."</p>
               <p>"Let Ronald alone," said Bryant; every one to his trade. If you do your part as well as he will do his, there is no fear; but now I must be off. Good-night."</p>
               <p>"Good-night!" said Guildford. "Don't forget the body; let it be deep—deep, Bryant, deep."</p>
               <p>"Deep as a justice of the peace, never fear; his bones will never see daylight more," said the smuggler, and in another moment he was gone.</p>
               <p>All was hushed and silent as the grave, when Bryant threaded the paths of the shrubbery until he gained the public road, along which he walked at a rapid pace, stopping only when he came to the bog cabin, where he knew that his victim had formerly lived. He listened—no sound met his ear; the door stood ajar, an evident sign that the cabin was untenanted. Satisfied that all was right, he proceeded on his way, and arrived at the Rath, as the clock struck one. The men, including Ronald, were waiting the return of their leader with much anxiety, and two women were busily engaged in cooking a supper for his refreshment. Bryant took little notice of their salutations, but at once proceeded to his business.—"Well," said he, "is it all right?"</p>
               <p>"Safe," was the laconic reply.</p>
               <p>"Where did you find it?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Just beyond the coppice," was the reply. "The fellow must have been listening, one would think, by the way he fell in the brushwood.</p>
               <p>"And you buried it at once?" said Bryant.</p>
               <p>"We seldom lose time," was the reply. "You don't often miss your aim nor we fail in our duty. Would you like to go down and see?"</p>
               <p>Bryant involuntarily recoiled at the idea, but when he thought of the search that might soon be made in the Rath, he complied with the proposal, and went down with the men, armed with torches and thick bludgeons, into the gloomy depths of the caverns. In one of the deepest recesses, into which the waters of the canal frequently penetrated, lay a body wrapped in a thick covering which concealed the features, and so placed that few even who would search the gloomy vault would defect its presence.</p>
               <p>Bryant paused a moment, surveying the spot, and then said, in a low tone, "We'll earth it up in the morning; no one will pry into a damp corner like that, if it looks all banked up and natural."</p>
               <p>The men nodded, and they returned to the more wholesome air of the upper regions, where supper was waiting for them. While the meal proceeded, Bryant explained to his son and the others the new employment that their patron had cut out for them. Ronald listened in silence, but his sagacious nod of assent was enough for his admiring parent, and he merely said, "No time like the present; eh, Ronald, what say you?"</p>
               <p>"Leave it to me," replied the young man; all must depend on opportunities which cannot be counted on. I will let you know in the morning what my ideas are on the business."</p>
               <p>Bryant was satisfied, and after a few more toasts and turbulent jests, the party lay down to rest. When Bryant woke up in the morning he perceived that Ronald was gone.</p>
               <p>With a well-pleased smile the smuggler rose, and after making his rough toilette, once more lighted a torch, and went down into those gloomy, but to him familiar, vaults. He trod their recesses and windings with an assured, firm step, though even his bronzed cheek was somewhat pale, and his teeth more firmly closed than usual, as he approached the corner where the body had been placed. He stood for a moment gazing at the concealed, but yet plainly defined form; and then, by a sudden impulse, he seized the cloth and uncovered the features. They were those of a man about forty-five years of age, and deeply lined by other causes than time; and the rapid changing hand of death, aided by the damp of that wretched vault, already began to alter both the skin and the features; yet Bryant stood, in deep and troubled thought, striving to recall where he could have seen those features before. A dim, indistinct memory of times long past, of deeds which he believed long buried for ever, came gradually on his mind. He stooped down and examined the face more narrowly; then, as if with a desperate determination to satisfy his doubts, he set down the torch and began to search the pockets. There were two or three articles of little value, then a purse containing a small amount of money, and finally an old and well-worn pocket book. He satisfied himself that all was obtained from the senseless form, and then hastily replacing the covering, he turned away, and rapidly retracing his steps, ascended once more to the light and air of the upper apartments.</p>
               <p>All was still quiet at that early hour, and Bryant began eagerly to examine the case he had brought from the dead man's person. It contained two or three well-worn letters and a yellow-looking folded paper. He tore open the latter, perused it with a contracted brow and suppressed ejaculations of surprise, and then opened the letters. Not a word escaped him till he had concluded the whole, and then replacing them in the case, put it in his own pocket.</p>
               <p>"It is lucky, upon my word," he muttered, "exceedingly lucky for you, James Bryant, that this little mistake has occurred. Why, the fellow must have been eaves-dropping to prepare for the errand he was upon; though I can't understand how he<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6520-00000025"/> traced them here, or why he should have been in that identical spot when that lucky bullet missed its intended destination. By the powers, but Guildford has played into my band and spoiled his own, like a rascally selfish fool that he is. His plans fail when well laid; mine succeed, when I have not been able to guide them. James Bryant, you have only to keep your own counsel, and let the sapient justice remain in his fool's paradise of safety, and you will see your precious foster brother as much lower than yourself as he fancies himself higher just now. But where is that fellow gone, I wonder!—he must have got scent of the little surprise preparing for him, and flown away, by the same wind that blew that poor meddling wretch below to these parts. I thought the secret was safe with myself. Does any one else know of those papers, I wonder! Scarcely, or he would not have had them on him."</p>

                  </choice> paused a moment before he resumed his low, muttered monologue.</p>
               <p>"Shall I destroy these documents?" he soliloquised—"no; that would be foolishly rash; I should then lose all power, which it might some day be convenient to use. No, I will keep them safe and fast; and if ever the day comes when it suits me to turn the tables, and tell the truth, why then—but time enough, time enough. The first thing now is to make matters safe with the justice, and the justice's trusty agents, the police. I must not be idle.</p>
               <p>Bryant called loudly for his men; and, giving them some low but rapid and distinct orders, the band soon dispersed in different directions.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <p>THE morning of the first of September dawned through misty clouds, portending rain, but the threatening weather was little impediment to the keen sportsmen of Bally Adams, who had risen with the first grey light of dawn, and, after a hearty breakfast, set forth on their expedition. Dogs, guns, ammunition, and shooting-jackets, had all been got ready the night before and there was therefore no delay in their starting at once, accompanied for a short distance by their father, who was taking the opportunity of making a distant expedition, at the unusually early hour which the especial day had rendered possible. Gerard Carlton was to join them a little distance from Athy, and Adams whispered to his son that he must bring him home to dinner.</p>
               <p>"There is no danger in any quarter after what I told them the other day," said he; "and I don't want to be rude to the mother as an old tenant."</p>
               <p>William rather reluctantly assented, and the father and his sons parted.</p>
               <p>Half an hour after the party had set forth from Bally Adams, a tall, rather elegantly-formed young man, about twenty years of age, stole cautiously along the side of the thickly-planted orchard till he reached the low, old-fashioned, but wide-built house, and crouching down for a few moments, listened, and gazed cautiously round him ere he proceeded.</p>
               <p>Ronald (for it was he) had nothing of the air or appearance of the lawless avocation he followed; indeed, he could assume at pleasure the mien and bearing of a polished gentleman; and there was a natural grace in his movements, and a strange sort of refinement in his features and form, totally unlike the coarse, powerfully-built, burglar appearance of his father. He stood, or rather crouched for some minutes beside the house, and then carefully holding in one hand a small brightly polished pocket pistol, and lightly swinging himself with the other hand, by the help of a strong branch of ivy, on to the sill of the window nearest to him, he looked carefully into the interior of the apartment before proceeding further.</p>
               <p>The room was empty, and his quick eagle glance, at once detected that it must be the apartment he sought. It was a sort of half study half dressing-room, used by Adams for both the purposes of private business and toilet refreshments, when he cared not to ascend to his bedroom; and Ronald could even observe the old-fashioned bureau spoken of by Guildford, standing in a deep recess of the room, almost out of sight from both the windows and doors.</p>
               <p>The inspection cost but a moment, the next he had raised the window sash, and sprung with a quick but noiseless bound into the apartment. There was but little time to lose in idle curiosity, as no one knew better than the youthful burglar, and he proceeded at once to the errand on which he was charged.</p>
               <p>Still grasping the pistol in his left hand, he drew from his pocket a small finely-polished instrument, with which in a few seconds he opened the old-fashioned lock of the bureau, and with the rapidity and expertness of a practised hand he discovered the spring, and was about to rifle the drawer it opened of its contents, when he thought there was a momentary darkening of the light from the window. He paused an instant in his movements, and listened attentively, but there was no sound or appearance to <choice>
                     <sic>justfy</sic>
                     <corr>justify</corr>
                  </choice> his alarm, and he concluded his mission with rather more rapidity and less care than he might otherwise have used.</p>
               <p>The papers and money which the drawer contained were quickly transferred to the large pocket of his loose coat, and then quickly closing the bureau without more than a cursory glance at the other contents, he proceeded to effect his retreat in the same way as he had found an entrance. The window was cleared, the orchard stealthily passed through, and he was just congratulating himself on the perfect success of his mission, when his quick ear detected a step quickly approaching, and he instinctively cocked the pistol he held, ready to fire on the instant; but his hand involuntarily dropped as he saw the figure of the intruder standing before him at the end of the path he was quitting. It was that of a young, and, as his quick eye at once recognised, a most lovely girl, who even in that moment of surprise and terror did not lose the calm dignity which seemed the natural characteristics of her style of beauty, but quietly placed herself in his path, with the evident determination to arrest his escape.</p>
               <p>Ronald knew that it was not either of Adams's daughters, for he had often caught glimpses of them in his various visits to the Rath, and he stood for a moment in silent wonder who the fair vision could be, feeling little terror at so fragile an obstacle to his progress.</p>
               <p>"Lady, I will trouble you to stand aside," he said, as the danger of delay recurred to him; "my errand is urgent."</p>
               <p>"You will not pass," she said in quiet, silvery tones, that contrasted strongly with the unshaken firmness of her look and mien. "You will not pass," she repeated, "till you have restored the property you have just taken from Mr. Adams's bureau."</p>
               <p>"I should be sorry to use violence in language or gesture to so fair a lady," said Ronald, with a scornful laugh; "but if you do not let me pass at once, I must necessarily do so."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, Ronald made a step forward, but Mabel May stood her ground resolutely.</p>
               <p>"Give up the stolen property!" she exclaimed, "and I will promise to let you escape the consequences of your crime."</p>
               <p>Ronald saw at once that her resolution could not be lightly shaken, and, however reluctantly, he took another tone.</p>
               <p>"This is folly, young lady," he cried. "I know that there is no man on the premises to aid you. I am armed, and would not scruple to use my weapon, rather than ruin myself or those who depend on me. Once more, stand aside, I beg of you."</p>
               <p>Mabel did not move, and Ronald quietly laid his hand on her arm, but she snatched it away indignantly.</p>
               <p>"Another moment, and I will shout for help!" she cried. "And even if you were to escape me, it could only be for a short time. In a few hours you would be tracked and seized by those whom you dare not resist. Give up the property you have taken, and I promise that you shall be free."</p>
               <p>"You are short-sighted, fair lady, to give me such reason to silence you," said Ronald, sneeringly; "I am sorry, but there is no alternative. You see this pistol; it is loaded, and one little movement of my finger would send the contents through your heart. I am not to be trifled with, remember, and though I would willingly have spared threats, they will be carried out when made, without hesitation or remorse.</p>
               <p>Mabel looked on the dark, handsome face which was turned on hers, and saw the gesture which placed her life at his mercy in a moment. She was brave, but a strong man might have quailed at the danger, and she saw the uselessness of further resistance.</p>
               <p>"Mark me," said Ronald, grasping her wrist tightly and suddenly; "if you do not at once give me your solemn word that you will not in any way or manner betray me, or set the bloodhounds on my track, I will discharge this pistol into your bosom, and long ere you would be discovered, I should be where I could not be easily found. Speak quickly; will you do this?"</p>
               <p>"I will," replied Mabel, faintly, for her strength was failing her; "what am I to promise?"</p>
               <p>"That if you should see me at any time, or meet me in any way, you will never appear to recognise me; that you will not speak of this meeting, nor give any hint of the scene you have witnessed. Do you swear this?"</p>
               <p>"I do," said Mabel; "for I have no alternative; but doubt not that justice will overtake you for your crimes, though I am powerless in body to do what my spirit would not shrink from. I will not break my promise, but be assured it will not save you from the punishment you deserve."</p>
               <p>Ronald looked for one moment on the pale, sweet face, so unflinching in its proud sense of right and innocence, and his conscience felt a sharp pang for perhaps the first time in his life.</p>
               <p>"It is too late, too late," he said; "but some day I may remember your words. Believe me, I shall not forget you, and I pray you, pardon the rude violence to which I have been driven by necessity."</p>
               <p>He raised her hand to his lips ere she was aware of the bold action, and in another moment had bounded out of sight.</p>
               <p>Mabel May's strength failed her with the necessity for its exertion; she felt faint and giddy, and fearful of losing consciousness in that lonely spot, she roused all her energies to totter as she best could to the house, and gaining her own room she threw herself on the bed, thankful that she might consider herself tolerably secure from any intrusion for the next two hours.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <p>ONE hour after Ronald had parted with Mabel May, he was noiselessly approaching<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6520-00000026"/> the door of the conservatory at Garron's Hill, which his fertile brain imagined might have been probably left unsecured after the smuggler's exit on the previous night. He had provided himself against the chances of not obtaining an interview with the justice at that early hour by enclosing the bond in an envelope, and writing "Ronald" within the fold.</p>
               <p>Ronald's calculations proved correct; the conservatory door was unfastened, and though the library door, which communicated with it, was carefully locked, he managed to slip the packet under the door, so as not to leave a vestige of it visible outside, and then, rapidly darting from the spot, he made the best of his way from the premises, and was soon in the shelter of the Rath, recounting to his well-satisfied father the result of his morning's work.</p>
               <p>Some time afterwards Guildford entered the apartment and seated himself at his desk, in deep and troubled thought. Then he started; there was a slight scuffle in the conservatory—his conscience made him a coward—and springing to the door, he looked anxiously through the glass window, and to his great relief perceived only his gardener and his favourite hound, which was vainly trying to escape to his master, whose presence in the library had been detected by his quick scent.</p>
               <p>Guildford opened the door to admit the dog, and in so doing perceived the packet lying at his feet. He hastily raised it, tore it open, and to his inexpressible delight grasped the bond, the possession of which relieved him from an imminent and threatening danger. In his exultation and delight he fairly chuckled over the rage and consternation of the unlucky Adams, on discovering his loss, and his perplexity between the desire of recovering it, and fear of confessing that he was no longer the owner of the instrument.</p>
               <p>"No, no, he will not dare to let me suppose that he has not got it in his possession," said the justice to himself; "but it certainly shall not return to his safe keeping."</p>
               <p>Tearing the bond into several pieces, and lighting a wax taper, he gradually reduced them to ashes, one by one, till all were consumed.</p>
               <p>"Now then for the warrants; I shall soon be applied to," he thought. "Oh, yes, I will grant warrants in plenty, and let them search the Rath at their leisure; they will find nothing there except—"</p>
               <p>Here a shiver came over him as he remembered the body that was deposited there.</p>
               <p>"No, that won't do," he continued; "I must evade granting a search warrant; that did not strike me before. I wish I could see Bryant."</p>
               <p>A knock at the room door startled him; he turned pale, and his voice shook as he bade the person enter.</p>
               <p>"Lawyer Styles, sir, from Carlow," said the servant, without doing more than put his head inside the door.</p>
               <p>"Show him in," said the relieved justice; and the lawyer entered.</p>
               <p>"You are an early visitor," said Guildford; "but there, so much the better; we are more secure from interruption; but what brings you to Garron's Hill? Something important, I expect."</p>
               <p>"No, nothing particular," replied Styles; "only, have you settled that business?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and for ever," replied Guildford; "the dead tell no tales."</p>
               <p>"Are you certain?" said Styles.</p>
               <p>"Quite," said the justice; "Bryant never fails; but why do you ask?"</p>
               <p>"Because some one has been to the jailor at Carlow to inquire concerning a prisoner he had seven years ago, named Ryan; but the jailor forgot having ever had such a person in his custody?"</p>
               <p>"How did you learn this?" demanded Guildford.</p>
               <p>"I was at the jail on business, and heard the inquiry," said Styles.</p>
               <p>"What sort of person was it?"</p>
               <p>"Faith, it is difficult to say," replied Styles. "He was not a peasant, nor yet a gentleman; more like some poor clerk in a lawyer's office."</p>
               <p>"Well, let him inquire; he will never see nor hear of him any more," said the justice, exultingly; "and Styles, I have more good news yet."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" said Styles. "What is that?"</p>
               <p>"You remember the bond I gave to Adams?"</p>
               <p>"Of course," said Styles. "Is it cancelled?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and most effectually," replied Guildford, "for every atom of it is destroyed."</p>
               <p>"Ah! how did you manage that? Not by paying it, I'm certain."</p>
               <p>"Certainly not," replied Guildford. "But hush! the old man does not know it yet."</p>
               <p>"Ah! some extraordinary transaction, I presume—out of the regular line, eh, Mr. Justice?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Styles," said the justice, "you can see through a mill-stone as well as most people, provided you have a hole to look through; hut really you have been getting strangely dull lately. Whisky has deadened your faculties, man, and it's well for you I'm always awake. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Nunquam dormio;</foreign> which is, 'I never sleep,' if you have not forgotten your Latin."</p>
               <p>"Humph!" said Styles; "'I never pay' would be much more appropriate in your case, I think."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! that is rather more in your old style," said Guildford, "and I am glad to hear it. But have you found a mortgagee for Garron's Hill?"</p>
               <p>"No, faith: the times won't allow of such a thing; those who have money keep it, and those who have none are of no use."</p>
               <p>"Then I must sell it out and out," said Guildford; "for there is no one to object to it now."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me," said Styles; "there is one who would object."</p>
               <p>"Who?" exclaimed Guildford, with a fierce glare in his grey eyes.</p>
               <p>"Myself," replied the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"You,—Styles!—you thwart me?" exclaimed Guildford.</p>
               <p>"Ay, in this—nothing else, Mr. Justice. Please to remember I gave up my practice for three hundred pounds a year, to be paid quarterly, which said annuity comes from and out of this estate; if you sell it how am I to be paid, I should like to know?"</p>
               <p>"True, Styles, true; but I could pay you down six thousand out of the proceeds of the sale."</p>
               <p>"Yes, you <emph>could</emph>, I know," retorted the lawyer; "but suppose you did not, and the sale was concluded, what check have I over you? So excuse me, my dear sir, but business is one thing, you know, and friendship another."</p>
               <p>"So then, you bring it to this," said Guildford, gloomily,—"that I can neither mortgage nor sell my estate."</p>
               <p>"I cannot see the necessity of doing either one or the other," replied Styles; "for retrenchment and economy would bring you round, and you would still maintain your position in the county, which would vanish with Garron's Hill. Think of this, Mr. Guildford."</p>
               <p>"Curse the county and all who are in it!" exclaimed the justice, angrily; "money I want, and will have; and you, Styles, are the last man who should obstruct or mistrust me."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Mr. Guildford, I am the first man who ought to do so."</p>
               <p>"And is this all the consolation you have for me?" demanded Guildford.</p>
               <p>"The <emph>advice</emph> I give you is to be patient and economical," replied Styles.</p>
               <p>"Zounds, Styles," exclaimed the justice, "you will drive me mad! Can I be more careful than I am? I keep no company, ride a shabby old hack, and keep but three servants; would you have me wait on myself? Curse you, Styles, how do you contrive to get on as you do?"</p>
               <p>"Oh," repeated Styles, with a significant smile, "I live like a lord on my three hundred a year, as you witnessed the other day."</p>
               <p>Guildford sneered, evidently wishing this other tool of his nefarious schemes under the ruins of the Rath, in company with Ryan.</p>
               <p>Perhaps there was only one reason which prevented Guildford from planning the lawyer's removal, and that was his knowledge of the law, and the shrewd cunning of his brain, when not under the influence of whisky punch. And in addition, there might be a secret satisfaction in feeling that Styles was as deeply implicated as himself, and that when likely to get into a scrape, two heads were better than one. These considerations had hitherto saved the debauched Styles; but now that the man began to thwart him in the sale of Garron's Hill, the justice began to think seriously of the policy and safety of what Bryant called "removing" him. For the present, he waived the question, and said more graciously, "Well, Styles, you are right to take care of yourself, and I cannot blame you for that; but catch a flat for a mortagee if you can."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll try," said Styles, "though I give you no hope of success; but I will tell you who is the most likely to manage it of any one I know."</p>
               <p>"Who?" demanded Guildford, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Young Ronald, the son of your foster brother,—a most extraordinary young man," replied Styles. "He can be a gentleman when he chooses, and turn his hand to anything. By-the-way, do you ever gamble?"</p>
               <p>"I have done so to my cost," replied Guildford.</p>
               <p>"Well then, it is but fair that you should make up for your losses," observed Styles. "Ronald is the very fellow to assist and instruct you; give yourself a holiday, and go to Dublin or London, and if you don't catch flats there, why where can you?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! that's something more to the purpose," said Guildford; "but it's confoundedly unlucky that I expect this very Ronald before me, charged with theft; and were I to be seen with him as my companion, after refusing to commit him, pray what do you think would become of my character?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, very well," said the lawyer; 'then you have made all your arrangements, I suppose, only one more piece of advice to give you—don't get so far into the mire that you cannot get out again. Good day, Mr. Guildford, good day," he repeated; and at once withdrew.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <p>THE sporting party at Bally Adams had returned laden with game much to the delight of Adams, who welcomed them with his usual vociferous heartiness.</p>
               <p>"All right, my lads," said he;" dinner will be on the table directly; but unluckily, Mabel May won't be down with us to eat it—she's not well, they say. Can't understand it; my girls are never ill, or I'd know the reason why; but come along, Master Gerard, wash your hands in my dressing room; and as to your shooting dress, we are too fond of the sport to mind seeing it at dinner time; no ceremony on the first of September."</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6520-00000027"/>
               <p>Gerard Carlton followed, somewhat disconcerted at the news of Mabel's indisposition, and wondering, with a lover's self-tormenting jealousy, whether it was a mere pretext to avoid seeing him; but the injunctions of his host to be quick prevented his dwelling on the circumstance at the moment, and performing his toilet as he best could, he entered the dining-room. But either the reflections on the fair Mabel, or the rather eccentric character of the materials he had to use somewhat delayed his operations, and when he entered the dining-room he found the party already seated.</p>
               <p>"Come, Master Gerard," said Adams: "we waited some time for you; what have you been about?"</p>
               <p>"My clothes were so very dirty, sir, that it took me some time to brush them," replied Gerard.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, never mind," said Adams; "let me send you some mutton."</p>
               <p>The dinner was somewhat dull and constrained; the young men seemed out of sorts; Fanny was afraid of speaking or looking, lest her father should think she was disobeying his commands, and Norah was rather preoccupied, and wondering at Mabel's sudden illness and evident agitation.</p>
               <p>The girls retired as soon as they could with any propriety, and then Mr. Adams observed, "I hope, boys, you gave Mr. Gerard fair play?"</p>
               <p>"We!" replied Edward; "you should hope he gave us a fair chance, for he had all the game to himself."</p>
               <p>"Nay," replied Gerard, "you cannot say that though I did once interfere with your shot, and was very sorry it so happened."</p>
               <p>"I had not much sport, however," observed Edward.</p>
               <p>"I did not spoil your sport, I hope?" said Gerard.</p>
               <p>"No; and it is lucky for you you did not, or I might have chanced to tell you my mind," w s the sullen rejoinder.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry I joined the party," observed Gerard, coldly; "it is the last time I shall do so."</p>
               <p>"Come, lads, no wrangling; for shame, Edward," said his father. "But did you pass the robbers' wood?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," replied Edward; "and saw an ill-looking fellow there."</p>
               <p>"I wish the cursed crew were driven out of the place," said Adams; "they are a pest to the neighborhood in general, vagabonds that they are."</p>
               <p>"And yet," said Gerard, with a young man' romantic fancy for daring bravery, "I hardly remember anything being really proved against them. I doubt whether they are as bad as they are painted."</p>
               <p>"That is your opinion, is it?" said William Adams, sneeringly.</p>
               <p>"Such a lawless crew have few advocates like Mr. Gerard Carlton," observed Edward.</p>
               <p>"I hope," said Gerard, fiercely, "that I may be allowed to express my opinion, and I certainly shall do so without any permission from Mr. William or Edward Adams."</p>
               <p>The young men got up and left the room in a boiling state of ill-humor, not so much at Gerard's defence of the robbers, as in the superior success of his gun that morning, more especially as he had by mere accident interfered with Edward Adam's only chance of bringing down a bird; and thus, having been feeding on their supposed injuries, even more than the good cheer before them, they had naturally worked themselves up into a fit state to take offence with or without occasion. But Gerard, being of no humor to submit to such imperious behavior without resenting it, rose to depart and bowed coldly enough to Mr. Adams.</p>
               <p>"Stay," said Adams, "don't mind those headstrong lads, I'll give them a good rowing, presently."</p>
               <p>"Not on my account, sir, I beg," said Gerard; "it is a matter of perfect indifference what their feelings are towards me, as I have done nothing to forfeit their regard. But I must say, if they were inclined to quarrel, they should have selected a more proper place than their father's dinner-table."</p>
               <p>"True, boy, true; but you can't put old heads on young shoulders, and there's no offence meant," said Adams. "My respects to your mother, and tell her the girls are talking of coming over to see her, and I shall send her some game and grapes over tomorrow. There, don't bear malice, Mr. Gerard. Shake hands. Good night; and we shall all forget and forgive before the morning."</p>
               <p>Gerard accepted the proffered hand, but he could not quite return the cordial pressure, for he had been much irritated and galled all day, and the disappointment of his cherished hopes of spending the evening with Mabel May had not tended to soothe his ruffled temper. It is the experience of almost all of us that happiness and amiability generally go together, and when the heart is heavy, the temper is seldom peculiarly patient or placable. And thus it was with Gerard Carlton on the unlucky evening of the first of September.</p>
               <p>It was pouring with rain as Gerard left Bally Adams; the clouds which had threatened all day now completely covered both the mental and material horizon of the young man, and he walked rapidly along the well-known road, regardless of the darkness and the obstacles over which he stumbled from time to time in the excitement of his feelings. At length he came to the point where the direct road to Athy branched off, and was about to turn in that direction, when he encountered a peasant just returning to his cottage, laden with peat for his family.</p>
               <p>"Ye must go by the road," sir, said the man, who recognized Gerard by his voice on hailing him in the darkness. "There's a flood out, sir, about a quarter of a mile further ther on, and ye'd never be able to pass such a night as this; it's more than your life is worth, that it is."</p>
               <p>"What am I to do then, my good fellow?" said Gerard. "I must get home somehow, or my mother would be terrified to death."</p>
               <p>"Go round by the wood, Mr. Gerard; it's a long way about but it's the safest and shortest in the end."</p>
               <p>"Thanks my good follow," said Gerard. "I'll take your advice. Good night to you."</p>
               <p>He turned his steps in the direction of the wood, half amused at being forced to test the truth of his convictions by going in the robbers' haunts so soon after the defence of their trustworthiness. However, there was no alternative, and he went on, half-blinded by the driving wind and rain, till he reached the wood, when the increasing violence of the storm fairly compelled him to think of finding some shelter. He dashed into the heart of the wood, thinking it would furnish some defence from the tempest, and unconsciously proceeded towards the Rath; but so thick was the darkness that the first intimation he had of the Rath was the light of a flambeau, which, indeed, timely flashed on his path, so as to save him from a serious fall over a recumbent tree. He perceived at once that he was literally in "the lion's mouth," and might as well make a virtue of necessity, and appeal to the good feelings which he had so lately attributed to the robbers, rather than risk being discovered in the suspicious position of a loiterer near their dwelling. He shouted with a loud voice, which was, however, half lost in the noise of the tempest, and at length groped his way to what might be called the door, of the singular abode. He knocked with the butt end of his gun, and at length an answer was returned in a gruff voice, demanding who he was, and what was his errand there.</p>
               <p>The answer proved satisfactory, and in a few moments a light approached, visible through the apertures of the building, and after some little delay in removing the defences from the door, Bryant himself appeared with a torch and bade him enter.</p>
               <p>Gerard obeyed, with a half romantic pleasure at the idea of penetrating into a haunt of which he had heard so much, and only enough apprehension to give zest to the adventure. He looked eagerly round. It was a large vaulted apartment, with a long table in the middle, and a variety of seats of all descriptions in different parts of the room. But the only tenants of the apartment at the present moment were, two women, squatting near a large iron caldron, which doubtless, contained supper for the gang, and which threw out a tempting odor when they lifted the lid.</p>

                     <corr>Bryant</corr>
                  </choice> placed a stool close to the blazing fire, and motioned to Gerard to approach.</p>
               <p>"Dry yourself," he said; "take off your dripping coat and scarf; you will take cold if you keep that wet thing round your throat. I will see to the gun; it is too good a one to be spoiled."</p>
               <p>Gerard gladly divested himself of his drenched garments, and felt revived by the grateful heat of the fire, from which the women withdrew, leaving their leader alone with his guest.</p>
               <p>"Where do you come from, young man, and where are you going at this hour?" asked the brigand, gazing on his visitor with his keen, dark eyes.</p>
               <p>"From Bally Adams, and I was on my road to Athy," replied Gerard, justly concluding that a direct reply was the most judicious."</p>
               <p>"A roundabout road, methinks, young man, on such a night, and at this hour," repeated Bryant, incredulously; for the place mentioned by Carlton awakened at once his suspicious.</p>
               <p>The tone was so different, and the look so dark, that for the first time Gerard began to think that the elements might not have been his most dangerous enemies after all. But he knew his only chance was to conceal any feeling of alarm.</p>
               <p>"True," said he, coolly; "but the flood was out, I was told, in the direct route, and I was warned not to attempt it."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" said Bryant, sneeringly; "the warning may have been well meant, but it perhaps might have been safer for you to have swum the flood, than come hither for shelter. We like not visitors, least of all those that come from Bally Adams, I can tell you; nor do they send people here with any good will to us, we know full well."</p>
               <p>"You are right," said Gerard, calmly; "they have no very kind ideas of you, and I nearly got into a quarrel this very night, by defending you."</p>
               <p>Possibly the speech was injudicious, for Bryant's look grew more doubtful yet, as he muttered, "Ha! you have been speaking of us then."</p>
               <p>At the moment an inner door opened, and Ronald, with four or five other men, entered. Bryant went towards them, and Gerard could see dark and suspicious glances cast towards him as the party carried on an eager but low-toned conversation. He could distinctly hear some fragments of the dialogue, which was principally between Bryant and his son; and the words "spy," "danger," "enemies," and other significant phrases, told him the unpleasant tenor of the discourse. At last Ronald approached him.</p>
               <p>"So you come from Bally Adams?" he said.</p>
               <p>"I do," replied Gerard.</p>
               <p>"As a spy, of course?" said Ronald.</p>
               <p>"You are wrong," said Gerard, haughtily. "I am no spy—least of all for the inhabitants of Bally Adams, whom I have probably offended seriously by defending you."</p>
               <p>"A likely story!" said Ronald, turning away contemptuously.</p>
               <p>Again the whispering commenced, but this<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6520-00000028"/> time more low-toned than before. It was tolerably plain to Gerard, however, that Bryant was more favorably disposed towards him than the young man; but still the chances in his favor were so slight, that he inwardly gave himself up for lost, and bitter and regretful thoughts of his mother and of Mabel came to aggravate the agony of so early and sudden death.</p>
               <p>At length the resolution seemed taken, and Bryant approached Gerard, standing right in front of him, with one hand concealed in his bosom, while the other was suddenly laid on the young man's shoulder, and his dark glaring eye fixed menacingly on his face.</p>
               <p>"Young man," he said sternly, "the safety of many lives depends on yours; you came uninvited; your presence is dangerous, and I have no alternative. You must be silenced—and for ever!"</p>
               <p>He raised his right hand, which grasped a polished dagger, and the next moment appeared would be inevitably the last of his helpless victim. Gerard knew that resistance was useless, and scorned to make unavailing entreaties for life.</p>
               <p>"Strike!" he said, "if you can shed innocent blood in cold butchery like this."</p>
               <p>Again Bryant raised the weapon which had wavered for an instant, and prepared to strike the fatal blow, when a sudden gleam from the blazing fire fell full on the bare throat of his victim.</p>
               <p>"Good Heavens!" exclaimed Bryant, as the uplifted arm dropped powerless by his side; "is it possible?" Then catching Gerard's astonished look, he said, in a gruff tone, "This confounded arm of mine always gives me a twinge, ever since I broke it, in such weather as this! You may thank the Fates for it, young man—it saved your life." But Gerard could see that the brigand's keen eyes were earnestly fixed on the mark that a strange freak of Nature had stamped on his neck; and that his lips quivered as he spoke, with affected carelessness. "Young man, who are you?" he said, abruptly.</p>
               <p>"What do you know of me?" said Gerard, in his turn. "I implore you speak, man I am the son of a much-injured woman; but whom or what I really have a right to call myself I know not. In mercy tell me, if you can, what is my birth and parentage."</p>
               <p>Bryant had now recovered himself, and he said, bitterly, "I?—what should I know, boy? I never knew your mother, nor you either. All that I have to care about is whether you are a spy and dangerous to our community, or not."</p>
               <p>"I have already sworn to you that I am not," said Gerard, in a tone of deep disappointment. "I shall probably never visit Bally Adams again, because I would not join in the abuse of you."</p>
               <p>"How was it we were spoken of?" said the man, doubtfully.</p>
               <p>Gerard briefly informed him, and then Bryant bade him remain quietly where he was, and be under no apprehension as to his safety, as he would be answerable for his life and liberty, if what he asserted proved true. He then held another brief consultation with his son Ronald, who demanded abruptly, of his visitor whether he had heard of any unusual occurrence at Bally Adams.</p>
               <p>"None," replied Gerard; "besides, I have been all day out shooting, and was scarcely likely to know what may have happened. What do you suppose can have occurred?" he asked, as the sudden indisposition of Mabel came flashing on his mind.</p>
               <p>"Nothing," replied Roland, sternly. "Do not concern yourself as to what does not belong to you. Depart, and be thankful for your escape."</p>
               <p>"Nay," said Bryant, authoritatively; "it is still raining in torrents; he shall not go. Let him have some supper, and remain till morning.</p>
               <p>Ronald was about to remonstrate, when a confused noise in the distance was heard, lights flashed in every direction, the door of the building was burst in, and a strong body of constables, beaded by William Adams and some of his father's tenants, rushed into the apartment. Resistance was vain; Bryant, Ronald, Gerard Carlton, and four or five of the gang were made prisoners. The servants from Bally Adams were voluble in their abuse of the much dreaded but now powerless robbers of the Rath.</p>
               <p>"Search the Rath thoroughly," cried William Adams; "for any part of the stolen property, if found, would convict them."</p>
               <p>The order was obeyed, at least as far as the secret terrors of the men would permit, but though the upper apartment and the more accessible part of the vaults were examined, it was to no purpose. The deeper recesses of the gloomy caverns were left unsearched, and Bryant breathed more freely when the party returned with weary and dispirited countenances to the apartment. He had cast a fierce and suspicious look at Gerard on the first entrance of the constables, but a few moments showed him that they were to the full as severe with him as themselves, and as anxious to secure him; he therefore became convinced that his suspicions were unjust, and on the first opportunity he gave him a reassuring look, as much as to convey to him a certainty of the favorable result of the affair.</p>
               <p>Nothing could exceed the surprise of the young men to find Gerard actually among the robbers.</p>
               <p>"Ah," said Edward; "now we know why he defended the rascals. Secure him well, my men. He is their head and instigator, no doubt. Off with them to jail!"</p>
               <p>"Stay," said William; "we must have proper warrants of committal. Garron's Hill is the nearest point where we can get them; and we had better go there at once, Mr. Guildford may still be up."</p>
               <p>"Scarcely," said one of the constables; "however, we can try, your honor; mayhap he will attend to you at any time."</p>
               <p>"Edward," said William Adams to his brother, "go back to our father, and tell him we have found Carlton actually with the gang; that no part of the money or papers is to be found; but that we are going off to Garron's Hill for further examination."</p>
               <p>The unlucky prisoners were now secured, and the party set off, by the light of torches, to Garron's Hill; and while they are proceeding thither will be a fitting opportunity to explain the cause of the sudden invasion of the Rath by the party in question.</p>
               <p>When Gerard Carlton left Bally Adams, Mr. Adams and his sons repaired to the drawing-room, where tea was waiting for them. A question from Norah as to Gerard's disappearance elicited an angry account of the offence of which he had been guilty, and in condemning which the whole family joined, except Norah, who blamed her brothers in a spirited and decided tone for their injustice and ill breeding. A warm dispute ensued; and Edward, who was the most severe and ill-natured in his comments on the absent guest, after venting his ill-humor in every possible way he could conjure up, proceeded to extend his strictures to Mrs. Carlton, coarsely denouncing her character, and ending by declaring she was not a woman fit to be introduced among the innocent and virtuous of her own sex.</p>
               <p>Unwilling either to defend persons whom he secretly wished to be excluded for the present from his family, and yet conscious that these violent censures were unjust and ill-timed, Adams turned the subject of conversation by asking his son William whether he remembered that a bill of considerable amount would be due on the morrow, payable at Carlow.</p>
               <p>"You had better start early, my lad," said he; "'early birds,' you know, eh?"</p>
               <p>"If you will give me the bill to-night, I can start soon after day-break," said the young man.</p>
               <p>Adams at once lighted a candle, and proceeded to his study in search of the document.</p>
               <p>"Where is Miss May, Norah?" asked Edward, who had scarcely noticed Mabel's absence at dinner, so little was his attention ever bestowed on any circumstance unconnected with himself.</p>
               <p>"In bed, and, I hope, sleeping; as you must have been, not to have noticed that she was not at dinner, or heard me tell papa she was very unwell," replied Norah.</p>
               <p>"What can have occasioned so sudden an attack?" said William, anxiously. "She appeared quite well last night."</p>
               <p>Norah could have expressed about as much wonder at Mabel's inexplicable attack; but as she had her own private ideas on the subject, which she did not think fit to share at present even with her sister Fanny, she carelessly replied, "Oh, I suppose it is some cold, or nervous headache, or some such ladylike ailment. You know, Mabel is a town-bred girl, not like our robust, rustic selves."</p>
               <p>Fanny's pretty lips curled slightly at the hint; but before she could put in any disclaimer to the disparaging description given by Norah, their father's voice was heard shouting in stentorian tones for each of them in turn, and with each name interspersed with curses and lamentations, in which the words "thieves," "scoundrels," "ruin," were distinctly heard, and which quickly brought his sons to the spot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams was standing before the bureau, motionless, and livid with horror and indignation. The secret drawer was pulled out to its fullest extent, but not a vestige of its contents was to be seen; and the other receptacles of the bureau had been evidently ransacked and thrown into disorder.</p>
               <p>"What is all this?" exclaimed William, gazing in alarm at his father's horror-struck face and the empty bureau.</p>
               <p>"Look, boy, look!" shouted the unfortunate farmer; "my bond—my money—my bills—all gone! I am ruined—absolutely ruined!" he groaned, as he sank helpless and prostrate on a chair, gazing piteously in his son's face for help and comfort.</p>
               <p>"Has any one been in the room besides yourself, father? asked William, a sudden suspicion starting into his mind.</p>
               <p>"No one but young Carlton, who washed his hands here before dinner," groaned Adams.</p>
               <p>"And a plaguy long time he was," said Edward. "I have no doubt he employed himself very differently from what you imagined. But we will soon have him and the property also."</p>
               <p>"It is false, Edward!" cried Fanny bursting into tears. "Gerard Carlton is as incapable of such a deed as you are."</p>
               <p>"Silence, girl!" roared Adams. "Leave the room, both of you, this instant, and go to your beds! We want no whining love nonsense here; and if you ever dare to speak of that young villain again, you shall be locked up for a month. Go this instant, I tell you!"</p>
               <p>Norah gently forced her weeping sister from the room; she saw it would only injure Gerard's cause to venture on further expostulation, and, in truth, her quick brain rapidly connected the affair with Mabel's sudden illness, though she would have been puzzled to explain precisely how the two events could bear on each other.</p>
               <p>As they passed Mabel's door on their way to their own, Norah fancied she could distinguish a deep drawn sigh, almost amounting to a groan; but as she had a shrewd guess<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6520-00000029"/> that the intelligence she would be obliged to give, should Mabel ask any explanation of the disturbance, would not improve her friend's health or spirits, she wisely passed on, and contented herself with the very sufficient employment of consoling and restraining Fanny's grief.</p>
               <p>"Fanny, this is weak, unworthy of you," she said, at length, when she found all gentler consolations useless. "If you were engaged to Gerard, you could not give way more than this. I should scorn to confess that I loved a man who had not told me he loved me—ay, and courted me pretty patiently and assiduously, into the bargain."</p>
               <p>"But I do consider myself engaged to Gerard," said Fanny, her tears suspended for the moment by feminine pique and indignation. "Ever since we exchanged portraits, I held myself bound to him as much as if all were openly avowed. You are unkind, jealous, I believe, Norah, or you would not say such things."</p>
               <p>A slight noise made both the girls start—it was like the light rustle of footsteps, and female dress. Norah rushed to the door, thinking that one of the maids might be caves-dropping, but nothing was to be seen, and she tried to persuade herself that it was some nervous fancy, produced by agitation and alarm, at that late, silent hour of night; but the interruption had the good effect of diverting Fanny's lamentations for the moment, by exciting her naturally timid fears; and Norah had little difficulty in persuading her to seek as quickly as possible the shelter and safety of their pillows; but it was long ere Norah slept. Long after Fanny's sobs were hushed did she lie, listening to every sound in and around the house, though she dared not risk either disturbing Fanny, or exciting their father's anger, by obeying her anxious desire to examine into the cause of the mysterious noise, which she felt sure was not more imagination, and to ascertain what steps were being taken against the unfortunate Gerard by her angry relatives.</p>
               <p>No sooner had the girls quitted the room than William Adams, who preserved more calmness and common sense than any of the party, proposed to summon the servants, and cross-examine them as to their knowledge of the persons seen near the house during the day. One of the farm-servants stated that he had seen a stranger near the house early in the morning, but that he appeared merely admiring the fields and grounds; and when he came back to his breakfast he saw no signs of him.</p>
               <p>Adams was divided between his enmity and distrust of the robbers of the Rath, and his newly-excited dislikes and suspicions of Gerard Carlton; and though the description of the stranger scarcely tallied with his knowledge of the general appearance or age of the robbers, and it was almost incredible to imagine that a young man he had known from infancy could be guilty of such a crime, yet, in the heat of passion and prejudice, every improbability he overlooked, and arrangements were at once made for apprehending both the suspected parties.</p>
               <p>If confirmation of Gerard's guilt had been wanting, it was of course furnished by his apprehension in the robber's cave; although the more temperate William could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses against his old acquaintance, whom even recent jealousy and distrust could scarcely make him altogether banish from his regard and friendship. But his father, who joined the party at a little distance from the Rath, had no such doubts or misgivings.</p>
               <p>"The ungrateful young villain!" said Adams; "hanging is too good for him; I'll spend every penny I have in bringing him to justice, that I will; drag the rascal to Garron's Hill; don't let him escape."</p>
               <p>No one condescended to explain to Gerard when and in what manner Mr. Adams had been robbed, and he was therefore totally at a loss to imagine the nature of the charge made against him, or the grounds of the suspicion on which it rested. Proudly calm, and erect, and yet helpless, he followed his captors, with the gang among whom he had been so unfortunately classed, to the neighboring residence of Garron's Hill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Guildford, after having hastily dressed himself, on the summons being delivered to him, entered the justice room, and gave orders for the parties to be ushered into his presence. Mr. Adams of course headed the group, bursting with indignation, grief, and impatience, but his opening speech was at once cut short by the justice.</p>
               <p>"One moment, Mr. Adams," said he, "I must proceed regularly. My clerk is summoned, and will be here immediately."</p>
               <p>The individual distinguished by this high-sounding name was a diminutive, automaton-like, copying machine, admirably fitted for a passive subordinate to the tyrannical magistrate in whose service he rejoiced. But on this occasion he had just fallen into so very sound a "first sleep," that some delay occurred before he could be roused to resume his duties, and Adams inwardly chafed and fretted during the interval to an extent which gave infinite satisfaction to the vengeful justice.</p>
               <p>Guildford had been expecting the arrival of his present visitors for some hours, and had in consequence been unusually late in retiring. But he had been totally unprepared for the appearance of Gerard Carlton among the persons implicated in the affair, and it somewhat added to his difficulties in dealing with the accusation. However, it was of course his duty to act the stern, impartial magistrate, to listen to the depositions, and act upon them, with a secret reservation, however, in favor of his own more intimate knowledge of the matter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams's statement was, of course, first taken, and duly noted down by the half-stupefied O'Neil. The peculiar circumstances of the robbery, the fact, that the lock of the bureau had been opened without violence, the presence and unusual delay of Gerard's toilet operations in the study, and the subsequent discovery of the young man quietly seated by the fire in the robber's cave, in apparent intimate and satisfied companionship with them, were all poured forth with a vehemence and earnestness that would admit of no reasonable doubt as to the strong case of suspicion against him.</p>
               <p>Guildford saw that he could scarcely avoid committing Gerard for trial, though even his hardened heart felt a pang of remorse at condemning a high-spirited young man, from whom he had neither received wrong, nor feared injury, for a deed of which he knew him entirely guiltless; but yet, perhaps, it was a happy accident which would effectually turn suspicion from himself or his agent, and he paused for a few moments in deep thought.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Adams," he said, when the evidence of that gentleman was concluded, "you are not, perhaps, aware that you have committed a breach of the peace, in forcibly entering the habitation of these men, and seizing, binding, and removing them without a warrant from me, or any other justice of the peace."</p>
               <p>The justice paused a moment to enjoy the crest-fallen look of his hated neighbor, and then resumed, with an air of well-assumed frankness and magnanimity.</p>
               <p>"Had you applied to me," said he, "it would have been both my duty and pleasure to give you every assistance in my power towards recovering your property and apprehending the offenders; and even now, to show you I am willing to do all I can, as an old friend, I will waive the informality, and proceed at once with the inquiry. I must ask you first, whether you searched the person of Mr. Gerard Carlton on his apprehension."</p>
               <p>"I was not there," replied Adams; "but my son did, I believe."</p>
               <p>"Then he had better be next sworn," said the justice.</p>
               <p>William Adams was sworn by the small automaton at the justice's elbow.</p>
               <p>"Now, Mr. William Adams," said the justice, "did you search the person of the accused, Gerard Carlton?"—"I did," he replied.</p>
               <p>"State what you found on him," continued Guildford.</p>
               <p>"Nothing belonging to me or my father."</p>
               <p>"Was there no money?" asked the justice.</p>
               <p>"No, not a sixpence, which was the more suspicious, as I know he had a note case in his pocket while we were shooting, with some silver in it, if nothing more, and that also was missing."</p>
               <p>"Is this all the evidence against the accused gentleman?"</p>
               <p>Adams did not relish the last-named epithet, and burst in with, "Enough too, I should think; but we shall get more, no doubt, in a short time, if you do your duty, Mr. Guildford, and commit him."</p>
               <p>"Silence, sir, or I shall order you from the room!" said the justice, turning a withering frown on the purple face of the irate farmer. "You have only to answer my questions at present. On what ground have you arrested the remainder of the men you have brought before me, and who, I suppose, may be classed together in the examination?"</p>
               <p>Adams looked rather confused; he began to see his case was but a doubtful one, as to the robbers of the Rath.</p>
               <p>"One of my servants saw a man lurking about my house at dawn this morning, of very suspicious appearance, and from his description, I doubt not that it was one of that gang, who are a curse to the neighborhood, for I should like to know who else could it be, as my servants know every man and boy within five miles of Bally Adams."</p>
               <p>"Where is this servant?" asked the justice.</p>
               <p>"He is not here, sir, but he will attend in the morning," said William, fearful of his father's making some blunder, in the heat of his vexation.</p>
               <p>Guildford considered thoughtfully for a few moments, and then asked, "In what does the stolen property consist?"</p>
               <p>"Ten bank notes for ten pounds each, two for five, two bills of exchange, and other papers, and some gold and silver, but to what amount I cannot precisely say," replied Adams, warned by a look and slight pressure of his foot by the cautious William, not to mention the loss of the bond.</p>
               <p>"And you, Mr. William Adams, you state that you found no trace of this stolen property on the persons of any of these men?" said Guildford.</p>
               <p>"I certainly cannot say I did," replied William, reluctantly.</p>
               <p>"Then the charge at present rests on mere suspicion," observed the justice. "At the same time I am free to confess that in the case of the more distinguished of these prisoners, there is a strong ground for connecting the loss with his presence in the apartment where the stolen property was kept. Unless he can with clearness account for his delay and presence in the cave at the Rath, my duty with regard to him is therefore certain and positive. Gerard Carlton, you are now permitted to make your defence.</p>
               <p>Gerard bowed respectfully, and in a manly, distinct manner, declared his total innocence; denied any connection with, or knowledge of the tenants of the Rath, and accounted both for the unusual delay in the dressing-room of Mr. Adams, and also his presence in the cave, and concluded by calling on Bryant<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6520-00000030"/> ant himself to corroborate his statement, and also to prove that they had never met before that night.</p>
               <p>A peculiar expression on the robber's face caught the attention of the young man, even in that moment of alarm and disgrace, and recalled the strange agitation he had shown when he raised his hand against him in the cave that very night.</p>
               <p>"He is right," said Bryant. "He never saw me before, to his knowledge, and I was inclined to finish him off myself as a spy, about an hour back."</p>
               <p>"Oh, of course they will vouch for each other," said Edward Adams, spitefully; "but we demand the whole gang shall be sent to jail, that young fellow included."</p>
               <p>"Silence, young man!" said Guildford, sternly. "My decision is taken, and I will hear no quibbling about it. O'Neil, take notes of what I am about to say."</p>
               <p>O'Neil dipped his pen in the ink, and the justice proceeded:</p>
               <p>"The accused persons before me may be divided into two parties, and I shall treat them accordingly. On carefully weighing the evidence against the tenants of the Rath, there does not appear to me to be any real ground of suspicion against them, save the casual glimpse of a strange man, presumed to be one of the gang, by Mr. Adams's servant, and the presence in the cave of the person more plausibly accused. But as these reasons are so very slight, in my judgment, I should not feel justified in detaining the whole of these men in custody, as the servant in question can be produced to identify them, still less in committing them to prison. I will therefore accept the leaders as hostages for the whole party, on condition that they promise that their followers shall be forth-coming in the morning, when the examination will be renewed. James Bryant, you and your son Ronald will be locked up in the strong room beneath this apartment, with my own servants as your guard without the doors, and you will desire your people to appear before me at eleven o'clock to-morrow morning without fail."</p>
               <p>A glance, which Bryant alone perceived, conveyed a sufficient assurance that the obedience to this mandate would not be attended with any great danger, and then the justice turned to Gerard Carlton.</p>
               <p>"With respect to you, young gentleman, the case is somewhat different. There rests a strong suspicion on you, from the length of time which you were in the room with the stolen property, and your singular conduct afterwards; and, as I stated before that I should certainly commit the man seen lurking near the premises of Mr. Adams, could he be identified, so I am bound, without distinction or regard to your position in life, to deal with you in the same manner. But as it is at all times an irksome and unpleasant task to commit an individual so young, and of so different a class from those usually brought before me, I will, not withstanding the gravity of the charge, delay sending you to prison for twenty-four hours, trusting that some proof of your innocence may be discovered in the interval. You will thus, if innocent, escape the disgrace of entering the walls of a gaol under suspicion of a charge which may be unfounded, and if guilty, have time to consider the expediency of making confession and restitution to the best of your power. You will, therefore, remain in my house during the time I have stated, and I myself will be responsible for your safe keeping. I trust the prosecutor will, under the circumstances, agree with me as to the propriety of this indulgence."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, Mr. Guildford," said Mr. Adams, doubtfully, "I am free to confess you are acting with moderation and just consideration, and I should be loth to hurry a young gentleman, who was my guest a few hours ago, to a gaol. I shall myself employ the time you have granted in making every inquiry as to the robbery, and as I have fortunately noted down the numbers of the notes in my pocket-book, and shall order handbills to be printed and circulated in the neighborhood, it is possible we may hear something that may exculpate Mr. Carlton before many hours are over."</p>
               <p>"You are right, Mr. Adams, and your sentiments do you honor," said Guildford, who had his own reasons for not wishing to irritate the old man unnecessarily; "and I assure you I shall, on further examination, when the case is matured, and the hour more favorable for a lengthened investigation, give you the benefit of all my experience and judgment in this very painful business; but, as it now stands, it appears to me that we cannot do better than defer its further discussion till to-morrow, and at once retire to our beds, it being now one o'clock. O'Neil, hand me the minute-book, for me to sign your account of the proceedings."</p>
               <p>O'Neil obeyed; then Bryant, in obedience to the justice's orders, issued peremptory commands for his men to appear again on the following day; and then he and Ronald were marched off to the strong room of the mansion under guard of the two men-servants of the house; while Gerard Carlton was conducted to a comfortable bedroom, where the key was turned on him, and where the window was too high to admit of any chance of escape, had he been inclined to attempt it. He was to all intents and purposes, a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the Adams family and their servants returned to their home with anything but enviable feelings. They had made up their minds to see the gang of the Rath and Gerard Carlton sent off at once to Athy gaol, and they scarcely knew whether the loss of the property, or the disappointment of their resentful wishes, were most to be lamented and grumbled over.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the persons most satisfied with the decision of the justice were the two robbers, who were lodged, by no means uncomfortably, in the strong room of Garron's Hill. Two warm pallets and some supper had been sent them by a secret order of the justice; and they now sat, regaling themselves on the cold meat, cheese, and strong ale, with no lack of appetite or cheerfulness. The only ground for alarm on their part was the fact that the numbers of the notes were known, and might lead to the detection of their agent in Athy; but they felt tolerable confidence in his expertness and fidelity, and had escaped too many dangers to be very apprehensive of so doubtful a hazard. Their chief topic of conversation turned rather on the partner of their captivity than on themselves.</p>
               <p>"It was lucky we did not finish young Carlton as we intended," observed Ronald. "It's plain he was no spy from Bally Adams, for they were more bitter against him than against us. But, may I ask, what made you start and hesitate, when you seemed about to strike; it's not much in your fashion, when you take a dagger in hand. Was it that you know him?"</p>
               <p>"Never mind whether I do or not," replied Bryant. "I know when to keep my tongue still, even from blabbing to you, boy, though I trust you in most things. But mark me well; do not harm a hair of that young man's head on any pretext, as you value your own life and my good will; no, not under the pressure of any bribe or temptation whatever that may be held out to you Refuse, resist, defend him, or you shall die."</p>
               <p>"What!" cried Ronald, "would you take my life, father?"</p>
               <p>"Ay, boy, or let the hangman do it for me, if you disregard my warning," replied Bryant. "You know I am not to be trifled with; and whom I save, I save; whom I destroy, I destroy."</p>
               <p>"And if I in turn were to ask the life of a prisoner," said Ronald, "would you grant the prayer?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, lad, if you did but hold up your finger," replied Bryant; "but my wishes must not be disregarded in this particular when occasion offers."</p>
               <p>"But why should you anticipate that this young fellow's life will be sought after?" inquired Ronald.</p>
               <p>"Because I know that there is one who would rejoice in his death, and who would willingly employ you or any one else to remove him from his path," replied Bryant. "But you must refuse, either openly or by stratagem. If young Carlton die by the hand of man in cold blood, at the instigation of the man interested in his death, and I have the slightest reason to suspect you, why, look to yourself, Ronald, for the hangman will then claim his own. If I could not prove the murder of this boy, I could accuse you of deeds done long ago, of which I have abundant proof."</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said Ronald, "there is no reason to rake up past grievances. There is my hand. I will not hurt the young fellow; is that enough?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and for your own sake, remember the bond, Ronald; you know me too well to deceive or dare me."</p>
               <p>"Oh yes," said Ronald, with a bitter laugh; "you have brought me up as a dutiful son; I have been taught to imitate and obey my father, and learnt my lesson admirably. Only remember, in your turn, that I have too much of your own nature in me to be a mere tool, or a dupe. It were wiser to trust me entirely than attempt to terrify me with threats and dark speeches."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps, some day, I may, boy; but you may rue the knowledge. And I say again, forbear for your own sake as well as mine. And now, as the jug is empty, we may as well turn in for the night."</p>
               <p>Ronald assented; they threw themselves on their pallets, and in a few moments Bryant's heavy breathing proved that he was asleep. But Ronald slept not. His busy brain was at work on the events of the day, and rest for him was impossible. His father's strange agitation at the sight of Gerard Carlton, his stern injunctions to hold his life sacred, awakened his curiosity, or rather excited his anxiety to comprehend a mystery, which might possibly be of as great importance to himself as to his father. He recalled every circumstance of their past lives which could throw any light on the affair, but in vain. All had been a dark tissue of crime, and violence, and wrong, but none of the events which his memory could bring back during his own short life could explain the interest, the overwhelming importance, which the unscrupulous freebooter attached to the safety of the unknown companion of their present misfortune.</p>
               <p>At last Ronald turned from the subject in despair, and his thoughts wandered to another and a yet more exciting theme for contemplation. The young man's experience had been far more varied than his years could have warranted in female beauty, as in all other attractions of the great metropolis, in which his last years of stirring adventure and vice had been passed. But the pure loveliness, the noble courage, the unselfish disregard of personal danger of Mabel May had for the first time awakened better and higher ideas in his heart of what woman could be, and it probably brought with that knowledge a momentary pang at the thought of what he himself was, how unworthy, how entirely removed from the sphere of one so lovely and good, how degraded from the position which he felt he had powers and tastes to have filled, had his training and his lot in life been differently cast. It was like a ray of sunshine illumining the dark recess of some gloomy cave, and displaying its hitherto unsuspected defilement and desolation.</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6520-00000031"/>
               <p>"And I might have associated with beings as pure as she is, ay, and distanced the poor drivelling fools who dream away their lives in dull, unquestioning mediocrity," he thought. "The talents that help me to brave it with the noble and gently born of London, and take their tone, and please their fastidious taste, would have placed me high in another and more honorable career. But it is too late, too late, and I am a weak fool to let a woman's face affect me thus. It is not love. Pshaw! such madness never enters my brain; no, it is rather reverence, such as an angel might excite in the breast of one steeped in crime and degradation as I am."</p>
               <p>Then came the doubt whether the promise, the oath he had exacted from Mabel May, would be kept by her when the lapse of time and the renewed examination of the morrow, gave an opportunity for bringing her forward by the incensed Adams.</p>
               <p>"I would trust her," he thought; "courage and truth go together in such beings as she is, and if not, why old Guildford dare not but get me off in some way. Pshaw! I laugh at such a childish captivity as he is likely to put me in; and yet, it might be awkward too; he dares not go too far openly in favoring us. Well, we shall see. It will go hard if I do not outwit these Irish blockheads in some way or other."</p>
               <p>After coming to this satisfactory conclusion, Ronald at last slept, though not till the dawn began to appear in the grey autumn sky.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <p>GERARD CARLTON had passed a strange and troubled night, though rather from excitement and indignation than any serious alarm as to the charge brought against him. He could scarcely bring himself to suppose that even his accusers could seriously believe him guilty, when calmer reflection cooled the first heat of their anger at the loss; and still less could he imagine that the sole and incomplete evidence brought against him would be enough to condemn him in a court of law. Still, the very disgrace of the apprehension, and the possible idea that Guildford might be induced to commit him for trial, and thus ensure a painful and degrading term of imprisonment and suspense, was enough to fire his brain, and prevent any chance of sleep. Then, too, thoughts of his mother,—her agony, her long sorrows, now increased by his misfortune,—heightened the tumult of his mind, and, fevered and restless, he tossed to and fro on the couch, where he had thrown himself without undressing, till morning broke through the high window into his prison chamber.</p>
               <p>As he started up from the vain effort to sleep, one more pang darted through his heart; a flower accidentally fell from his breast,—it was one which had dropped from the bouquet Mabel May had been gathering the first time he saw her at Bally Adams, and which he had managed to pick up unobserved, as a precious relic of a hopeless but most cherished love.</p>
               <p>Would Mabel believe him guilty? He had long known her lost to him; but the idea of sinking so low in her esteem—of living in her memory as a criminal—was to add gall and bitterness to the disgrace which had blighted every hope and joy of his youth.</p>
               <p>Poor Gerard! it was no disparagement to his manhood that tears sprang into his eyes as he replaced the withered blossom in his bosom, and prepared to refresh himself as he best might for the coming ordeal. He bathed his hot, aching forehead, and brushed away the clustering hair of which his poor mother was so proud; and then, drinking a tumbler of water, and taking a few turns up and down the room to relieve the fever of his spirits, he sat down, and bravely endeavored to summon firmness and composure to encounter the trying events which might await him in the day which had now dawned on him. Whatever might be his sufferings, neither his judge nor his accusers should detect the least sign of weakness, or one word that might appear a tacit acknowledgment of guilt. He had not long finished these operations, when a servant unlocked the door, and brought in a tray with some coffee and eatables for his breakfast.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Guildford bade me tell you that he should be in his justice-room precisely at eleven o'clock," said the man, "when, if Mr. Adams has arrived, the examination will be renewed. You had better, he says, be prepared, if you have anything further to say," he added; and without waiting for a reply, the man left the room.</p>
               <p>Time went laggingly on in that dull chamber, without any object to occupy Gerard's eye or mind, and he was much relieved when the step of the old servant once more approached; the door opened, and he was summoned to follow him to the justice-room.</p>
               <p>Guildford was seated at the table with somewhat more form and ceremony than the night before, his redoubtable clerk at one side of him, and two constables behind his chair, while Mr. Adams was accommodated with a seat near him. William Adams and his brother Edward stood at a little distance, and in the background were two or three persons whom Gerard did not recognise.</p>
               <p>The entrance of the young prisoner was unnoticed save by a stately bend of the head from Guildford, in acknowledgment of his respectful bow, and then a sign was made to him to stand immediately opposite the justice at a little distance from the table.</p>
               <p>There was a slight pause, and then the door again opened, and Bryant, Ronald, and others of their followers, came noisily into the room, and formed a confused group just behind Gerard, closely guarded by two or three constables, who had arrived from Carlow that morning. Guildford, whose eyes had been fixed on the papers before him, required the clerk to read over the previous depositions.</p>
               <p>"Is this a correct report of your statements, Mr. Adams, and have you anything more to say?" said Guildford, when the clerk had finished.</p>
               <p>"It's clear and right enough, so far," said Adams, eagerly; "but I've more to say, Mr. Guildford. I've another witness, that, in my opinion, will put the matter beyond all doubt. He's got the young—but I won't get in a passion—any way, there's his purse with one of my notes in it, picked up just outside my own grounds. I should think that was enough to settle the matter."</p>
               <p>Gerard could not control a start and sudden flush when he heard this; for, as it happened, he dropped his note-case on the day when he visited Bally Adams, though where be had done so he never could discover; and as there were only a few shillings in it, he had not troubled himself about the loss. But how the bank note could have got placed in it was unaccountable to himself, although it would naturally be most conclusive in the opinion of others.</p>
               <p>"Call the witness, and swear him," said Guildford to his clerk.</p>
               <p>One of the laborers on the Bally Adams estate was called, and produced a note case with Gerard Carlton's name written in it, and some cards and memoranda belonging to him. In the recess was a five-pound bank note, of which the number and date corresponded to one of those stolen from Mr. Adams.</p>
               <p>The man stated that he had picked up the note-case just outside the gate of the shrubbery, and at once carried it to his master, who opened it in the presence of himself and Mr. William and found in it the note in question. William Adams corroborated the statement, and then the justice asked Gerard if he had anything to say in his defence, as he had now no alternative but to commit him for trial, and discharge the other prisoners.</p>
               <p>Gerard saw that the idea of explaining the suspicious circumstance by the true state of the case was hopeless; but he calmly and clearly replied to the questions put to him, that the note-case was certainly his, but that he had not the slightest knowledge of the note, which he had never seen before, and that he could not account for its presence in the case, which contained but a few shillings when he lost it.</p>
               <p>Of course this explanation was received with sneering disbelief by the Adams party; and Guildford himself, whatever might be his private ideas on the subject had no alternative but to order the mittimus for Gerard's committal to be made out, while he directed the rest of the prisoners to be discharged, there not being a tittle of evidence against them.</p>
               <p>Gerard turned very pale, but he did not falter nor betray any other sign of emotion, and he returned the scornful look of Edward Adams with one of proud calmness, that galled the spiteful young man more keenly than any retort could have done.</p>
               <p>Bryant gave Ronald a look that seemed to demand an explanation of the suspicious circumstance, but the young man only turned away with a sneer, and was preparing to leave the room, from which the other men had quickly hastened on hearing their dismissal, when his progress was arrested by the entrance of two persons, whose appearance riveted him to the spot. It was a venerable clergyman, leading by the hand a young girl, whose face though very pale, was calm and resolute. She fixed her eyes on the ground so earnestly that she did not perceive Ronald, nor did she raise them till she had reached the table opposite to where the justice still sat, and then only for a moment.</p>
               <p>"Why,—zounds,—what's this now? Miss May," exclaimed Adams abruptly, "what brings you here? I never let my girls meddle like this,—nor parsons neither," he added, in a grumbling undertone.</p>
               <p>William Adams flushed crimson, and Gerard's pale cheek grew paler still at the appearance of the fair girl, on whom the hearts of both were fixed; but neither spoke, and Mr. Seaforth was the first to break the silence that followed Adam's half-smothered exclamation.</p>
               <p>"I have to apologise for my intrusion, Mr. Guildford," said Mr. Seaforth, with the quiet, gentle dignity that ever carried weight and influence with it; "but I am sure you will be as rejoiced as myself to prove the innocence of the young gentleman on whom suspicion has unhappily rested; and I believe I have brought a witness who can satisfy your worship on that point."</p>
               <p>Guildford was somewhat propitiated by the clergyman's tone of respect towards him, though he cast an uneasy glance at Bryant, fearing some unforeseen exposure of the truth might possibly be the result of this turn in affairs.</p>
               <p>"Of course, Mr. Seaforth," he said, loftily, "it is my wish to administer justice alike to high and low, and in my official capacity I know no distinction between them. But am I to understand that this young lady is the witness you have brought? I am at a loss to know what she can have to do in the affair."</p>
               <p>"She will inform you of that herself, sir, if you will kindly have her sworn," said the clergyman. "Indeed, I have only an imperfect knowledge of the circumstances she will relate to you. The fact is, I was just on the point of setting out to endeavor to procure some tidings for Mr. Carlton's mother, whom you will imagine was suffering terrible<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6520-00000032"/> rible suspense in his unexplained absence, when Miss May arrived at my house, and requested me to escort her thither. Mrs. Carlton is in such delicate health that I would not allow her to accompany us; and I consider my presence as a sufficient sanction for this young lady's courageous and generous interference on an innocent man's behalf," concluded the good clergyman, with a glance of mild reproof at the bewildered and indignant Adams.</p>
               <p>Gerard Carlton stood with a flushed cheek, and eager eyes fixed on Mabel's downcast face, while the clergyman was speaking; but as the first surprise passed away, he remembered that many and censorious eyes were on them; and recovering his former composure, he waited with apparent quietness the explanation of the strange appearance of Mabel on the scene. The girl was sworn—her sweet, clear tones contrasting strangely with the cracked voice of the clerk—and then Guildford desired her to state what she had to say in the affair.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Carlton is entirely innocent of the robbery that has been committed," she began, calmly. "I myself saw the man who took the property, and tried in vain to stop him; but there were no men on the premises, and I was unable to do so, as he was armed."</p>
               <p>"And why did you not give information at once, Miss May?" asked Guildford.</p>
               <p>"Because I promised not to do so," she replied. "I did it to save my life; but having pledged my word, I could not break it."</p>
               <p>"Then why do you break it now?" said Guildford.</p>
               <p>"I do not," she replied. "I promised to say and do nothing that would lead to the apprehension of the guilty person, and I will not do so now; but I can positively swear that the robbery was committed after Mr. Adams and his sons left the house on the morning of the first of this month, and also that it was done by a man whom I had never seen before."</p>
               <p>Mabel then briefly related that she had been awoke by the departure of the shooting-party, that feeling inclined for a stroll, she put on her hat and cloak and went out, when on passing the study-window she saw some person there through the window, and after satisfying herself that he was an intruder, she rushed off to get assistance, but in vain, there being no man about the premises, and that her own <foreign xml:lang="FRA">rencontre</foreign> with the thief ended in her giving the promise she had stated.</p>
               <p>"And should you know the man again, Miss May?" inquired Guildford.</p>
               <p>"I believe I should," she replied.</p>
               <p>"Is he in this room?" continued the justice.</p>
               <p>"I have not seen him here," she replied, firmly.</p>
               <p>"No wonder, if you don't look at anybody," broke in Adams, angrily. "Why don't you raise your eyes, Miss Mabel, and then see if one of those rascally robbers is not the man?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Adams, I can't allow the witness to be bullied." said Guildford, with great dignity. "Miss May has given her evidence very clearly and properly, and it is certain that Mr. Carlton is as innocent as I am of the robbery, and also that the guilty person is probably some stranger scamp, who is miles off by this time."</p>
               <p>"And how do you account for the purse, I'd like to know, and the bank note in it?" said the irate prosecutor. "It's a regular covering of iniquity and crime, that's what it is, and I'll appeal against it."</p>
               <p>"My good sir, you are angry," said the justice; "but if you reflect a moment, you will see that it all tallies. The thief doubtless picked up Mr. Carlton's purse, and either by accident or design placed the note in it, and dropped it, where it was found. I am ready to do anything in reason to help you. I will grant a search warrant, to examine the Rath more carefully than your people have done, and should any further trace be found of the missing property, you may rely on my active co-operation in bringing the guilty party to justice. But at present the case is dismissed, and Mr. Gerard Carlton leaves the court without a shadow of suspicion resting on his character."</p>
               <p>"I owe you my best thanks, sir, for your kindness in delaying my committal, and the handsome terms in which you have acquitted me. I hope every innocent person may meet with as considerate and just a judge," said Gerard, bowing respectfully.</p>
               <p>"Oh, as to that, it was only my duty." said Guildford, highly pleased at the satisfactory termination of the affair, "and I congratulate you on the highly creditable manner in which the examination has terminated. Your only thanks are due Miss May for her zeal and courage in coming forward, at her own risk, in your defence."</p>
               <p>A dark frown crossed William Adam's face, as he saw Mabel's deepened color at these words.</p>
               <p>"Methinks the same zeal was due my father," he said, in a low voice, in her ear, "But it is convenient on some occasions to keep your word, and on others to break it."</p>
               <p>Mabel made no reply, but Mr. Seaforth, who caught the words, answered for her.</p>
               <p>"That is an unworthy and unjust reproach, Mr. William Adams," said the clergyman. "Miss May has strictly observed the promise she was forced to make, and pardon me if I say that the observation savors more of a desire to criminate Mr. Carlton than to do justice. Mr Adams," he said, turning to the father, "I must, as a clergyman and the old friend of Mrs. Carlton, tell you that you have been guilty of both an illegal and most unmanly outrage against a helpless lady and an innocent young man, by arresting him without sufficient apology to them, I shall certainly consider it my duty to demand it, in their name, in a different manner."</p>
               <p>"I'm not a man to do wrong to any one, Mr. Seaforth," said Adams, "and though I consider I had sufficient provocation for what I did in this matter, I am quite ready to confess that we were a bit hasty, and I will say as much to Mrs. Carlton myself in a day or so. But that the villain has been in custody, after all, and got off, thanks to Miss May, who thought more of the young man's safety than of my loss, I still hold to, and I'll spare no expense nor pains to get at the truth, and bring the guilty to justice."</p>
               <p>An angry look at Guildford pointed the remark more decidedly than was exactly pleasant, especially as it was followed up by a request for a few minutes' private interview before leaving Garron's Hill.</p>
               <p>"Then, Miss May, I had better escort you back at once," said William Adams, sullenly. "I presume your errand here is satisfactorily finished."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, I will take care of Miss May," said Mr. Seaforth. "Gerard, your mother knows all, and will be at my house to receive you; you had better accompany us."</p>
               <p>Mabel might perhaps have declined the drive under such arrangements, but she had no wish to be left to William Adams's tender mercies, in his present jealous mood, and feeling that Mr. Seaforth's presence would be an effectual security against any subjects being introduced by Gerard, she accepted the clergyman's arm, and left the room, followed by Gerard Carlton. As they passed the spot where Bryant and Ronald still stood, they heard the latter say in a low tone to his father, "That girl's a trump. I would not have trusted any woman to behave like that."</p>
               <p>Gerard glanced at Mabel, and her crimson cheek and still downcast eyes gave him a key to the truth; but there was no time for question or hesitation, and he followed the rapid steps of his companions to the car which was waiting at the door of the mansion.</p>
               <p>"And now, Mr. Adams," said Guildford, with most well-feigned dignity and calmness, "you requested an interview with me in private. I suppose the presence of your son will not be any obstacle to what you have to communicate?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, certainly not; not at all," said Adams, rather nervously. "It is very simple; and of course you will not be surprised that, after my recent loss, I should wish you this morning to pay me the interest on the money I lent you, and for which I hold your bond."</p>
               <p>"My dear sir," said Guildford, "I believe, indeed I feel sure that a friend, who has kindly interested himself in my affairs, will enable me to take up the bond in question, and thus bring all my liabilities in one focus. You understand me, my good friend?"</p>
               <p>"Why, no, not exactly," said Adams, looking anything but like a man about to receive principal and interest for a doubtful debt.</p>
               <p>"Does not that proposal suit you, Mr. Adams? or do you doubt my word?" said Guildford, secretly exulting in his companion's perplexity.</p>
               <p>"Doubt you!" said Adams. "Oh no, not at all, Mr. Guildford; only you see a little ready money would be very useful just now, when I have been so terribly robbed; and I don't mind leaving the principal for a time, as the interest is fair, at least if regularly paid; and so, if you could oblige me with the small sum now due—"</p>
               <p>"My dear sir, excuse me, but the other will be by far the most regular and straight-forward course," said Guildford. "If you will bring me my bond this day week, I doubt not I shall be in a position to give you the whole, and close the transaction."</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, to be sure; only—" began Adams; but William coughed so significantly that he altered his tack. "All right, Mr. Guildford," he continued, "I will be with you this day week with the receipt in full, and legal acquittance for all demands."</p>
               <p>"The bond will be sufficient release when delivered up and cancelled," observed Guildford.</p>
               <p>"True,—yes," said Adams; "only I placed the bond, you see, for safety, where I might not be able to get it just by the time, in which case of course my acquittance would be sufficient for the particular bond in question, and my engagement to cancel it on obtaining it from my banker; you understand."</p>
               <p>"Scarcely, Mr. Adams," said Guildford, who could hardly repress a smile; "that is not my way of doing business. There would be greater risk in such a very irregular proceeding than I am inclined to run. No, bring me the bond, either at the date mentioned or later, and you can have your money. And now I will wish you good morning, and a speedy restoration of your stolen property."</p>
               <p>"I don't expect either property or justice, with matters in the state they are in the county," said the indignant Adams; "and I shall think it my duty to bring it before the judge and grand jury at the next assizes. Come, William, we may as well leave this cursed place."</p>
               <p>With a very faint attempt at a how the angry gentleman and his son left the room, and in a few minutes afterwards the justice heard them galloping from the house.</p>
               <p>When once more alone Guildford remained in deep thought.</p>
               <p>"So far, so good," said he; "all is safe so far; but, by heavens, it is a ticklish path I am treading; every step may open a cavern under me which would be my destruction. Styles is, as I believe, the only man living who can really prove—bah! it's an ugly word; and it is an ill bird that fouls its own<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6520-00000033"/> nest. The old man was doting, and it was no crime to prevent such a disposition being carried out. And yet, who could inquire after that Ryan at Carlow jail? Some agent of the heir. But what an idiot to expect to find a felon, who had been transported seven years ago, returned to his old quarters, and such agreeable ones too! No, he is in a deeper cell than any in Carlow jail, and they may come and do their worst; they will scarcely find him now, and most assuredly he will tell no tales. And then that young Carlton; I have a strange fancy that he is like some one I have seen in days gone by. He is a fine young fellow, that's certain; and yet I have an odd dislike to him,—a dread; it's folly, I know, for the lad was as well-mannered and respectful as I could wish; still, the look had something that brought many associations with it. I wish—but, bah! I may get frightened of my own shadow if I fancy every face I see recalls the past. I will take Styles's advice, and neither sell nor mortgage the estate till the danger is over; my consequence is my life; I could not exist without it. What should I be in another county? Plain Mr. Guildford; and who would care for or respect me then? Nowhere else could I rule over a whole bench of blockheads calling themselves magistrates; or make whole parishes tremble at my frown. Juries, farmers, ay, even lords look to me and bow to my opinion; and is not all this worth some risk, some exertion to keep? And yet that obstinate fellow Adams is a thorn in my side; there is something I fear in that small, cunning grey eye of his. That he hates me, I know; and I know also that he has learned something as to this estate which he should not, and the secret must burn in his breast and fever him with impatience to proclaim it to the world. But he cannot, he dares not; he might have done something in concert with Ryan, but now that Ryan is 'removed,' he is powerless. Yes, I like that word 'removed,' it is less harsh and harrowing than 'murder,' and does not bring a shudder as that ugly term does. Bah! what should I mention it for? it was his own fault; he tempted his fate; it was not my doing. But, then, money I must have; but how? Ronald! Yes, the gaming dodge is not bad. Yes, the 'gentleman,' brigand Ronald, and Andrew Guildford, Esquire, Justice of the Peace, worthy companions, conspiring to defraud fools and dupes! And should I be recognized, detected?—London! Yes, that will be best; and yet I might be recognised even there. I must consult Ronald. Those cursed creditors, had they but one neck, how easily could I settle them!"</p>
               <p>A knock at the door startled him. He put away one or two suspicious documents, and then bade the applicant for admission enter. It was only the harmless O'Neil who obeyed the call, looking more scared even than usual.</p>
               <p>"Well, what do you want?" said Guildford.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, sir, only that I have found out who is living in the bog cabin, as you bade me yesterday."</p>
               <p>"Well, who is it?" demanded Guildford.</p>
               <p>"An old woman, sir," replied O'Neil.</p>
               <p>"Pshaw!" exclaimed Guildford; "is that all you have to tell me, with that hangdog look! You're a greater fool than I thought!"</p>
               <p>"Not such a fool, either, sir," said the clerk. "The woman's a witch, and every one knows it round about."</p>
               <p>"She has bewitched you, you fool! What has she said to you?" asked Guildford, impatiently.</p>
               <p>"She told me my fortune, sir, and everything that ever happened to me ever since I was born, as well as I know it myself; and though she did'nt say much of the future, it came true what she did say, for she told me I should be frightened by some dangerous animal; and sure enough, as I came home, your honor's bull chased me to the shrubbery gate, and a narrow escape I had, I can tell you, sir."</p>
               <p>Guildford laughed scornfully, and dismissed his terrified clerk, secretly determining to consult the old sybil himself, and for that purpose set off quietly in the dusk of the evening, when he thought he should be unobserved. He was admitted without difficulty, and at once entered on his business.</p>
               <p>"I have heard of your fame," said he, "and I wish to consult you. Tell me all you can perceive in my future life."</p>
               <p>"Maybe your honor will be offended if it's not to your worship's liking," said the woman cautiously.</p>
               <p>"Worship!" said Guildford, "You know me then?"</p>
               <p>"It's little I could tell if I did not know such a simple thing as that," said the woman. "But will you have the truth?—for I never deceive."</p>
               <p>"Certainly," said Guildford; "begin at once."</p>
               <p>The woman produced a pot of coffee, bade the justice pour some of it into a cup, and then return it to the pot from which he took it. This having been done, she inspected the grounds for some moments, and then examined his hand with equal care. She looked in his face, and a slight shudder seemed to pass over her withered frame.</p>
               <p>"You have prospered as yet," she said; "your undertakings have succeeded, your plans have been carried out, but there is retribution at hand."</p>
               <p>"Retribution for what?" said Guildford, affecting to laugh.</p>
               <p>"Your own conscience can best tell," she replied. See there—look for yourself in that cup. Do you see that mark?—it is the shape of a hand; it is held up. Do you know what that denotes? That you will be some day tried, ay, and for a deadly crime, for in the palm of the hand is a red spot—it will be for murder."</p>
               <p>Guildford could not suppress a start, and the cold sweat burst out on his brow.</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, woman," said he; "this passes a joke; you are paid to annoy and alarm me. Murder! it is too absurd, and I will have you committed as a vagabond and imposter, if you dare to take such liberties with my name."</p>
               <p>"Better not, Andrew Guildford, better not," said the woman. "There are those who would avenge my death; and, besides, I may tell you some things that may be useful to you."</p>
               <p>"Go on then; but, remember, I am not to be trifled with," said Guildford, shading his face with his hand as the woman went on.</p>
               <p>"Will your honor like to try the cards? Here, cut, and I will see what they say."</p>
               <p>Guildford obeyed, and the dirty pieces of paper were spread out on the crazy deal table.</p>
               <p>"Beware of a dark man," she said; "he will help you to money; but there is danger in it, and he will betray you in the end."</p>
               <p>"The devil!" exclaimed Guildford, really startled.</p>
               <p>"No, not the devil, but one nearly as wicked," said the woman; "but listen, for I have nearly done. It seems to me that there are two men who will work your ruin. Money will do you little good. There is a long voyage over the water, and an uncanny one. All the dark cards are round you, and there is deep trouble in store for you—but not yet, not yet. You may go unscathed for months, nay years. And now go; I can tell you no more; and I will not be questioned, or worse dangers may befall you than you fear. Remember my warning, and leave me in peace."</p>
               <p>Guildford rose and left the hovel, cursing his own folly in entering it. He affected to attach no credit to the words of the sybil, but they hung heavy on his heart and it was with a gloomy and downcast brow that he returned to Garron's Hill.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
               <p>GERARD CARLTON had taken his seat beside Mabel May on the clergyman's car with an eager, passionate desire to pour out his whole heart to his beautiful deliverer, and to tell her of all the deep, intense love he had cherished for her almost from the first moment they had met, and the ardent, determined craving he felt to win a name and a fortune that might warrant his asking for her love without disgrace to herself, or the certainty of her father's contemptuous rejection of his suit. True, he could not tell her all; he was bound by honor and regard for his mother's fame not to reveal the secret of his birth; but he might say enough to vindicate himself from the charge of fickleness or coldness—he might at least for once have the happiness of venting long-hidden feelings.</p>
               <p>The good clergyman, who had not perhaps quite forgotten the days of his own youth, had insisted on driving himself, and leaving the two young people quiet after the fatigue and anxiety they had encountered. And thus for the first time they were alone, secure from interruption for the remainder of the drive; and yet Gerard for some moments could not find words to speak, and take advantage of the precious opportunity. Mabel sat with her eyes averted, and with a cheek so pale, and features so fixed and calm, that he read in them no encouragement for the suit he longed to press. And thus passed some minutes; every foot of ground traversed by the steady old steed diminished Gerard's chance of speaking, and took from his courage. At last he made a desperate effort.</p>
               <p>"Mabel! Miss May!" said he in a low voice, "how can I thank you?"</p>
               <p>"You owe me no thanks, Mr. Carlton," she replied. "I only did what was a simple duty to the merest stranger. I was bound not to let an innocent person suffer."</p>
               <p>"And will you not, Mabel, give me the poor consolation of hoping, believing, that you would have had more regret in seeing my unjust condemnation than that of a stranger, even as it was so much more precious to me to owe my safety to you than to any other human being?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Carlton, this is perfectly useless, absurd," said Mabel, proudly. "I know not why you should talk in such a tone to me, nor what I have done to warrant such implied—"</p>
               <p>"Insult, you were going to say," interrupted the young man, passionately.</p>
               <p>"Mabel, I must speak—I will; you must have known, have seen ever since we met on that first happy night, my whole heart has been yours, and I dared to hope—to believe—you were not displeased at the offering. It was, perhaps, presumption, madness, so to interpret your goodness; but so it was, and I cannot help telling you so, if you scorn me for the confession.</p>
               <p>Mabel's eyes had been fixed on her lap, and her cheek had varied from red to pale and pale to red, as Gerard's passionate words fell on her ear, in tones that could scarcely be doubted or disregarded by a young and, in spite of herself loving girl. But when he ventured to touch the hand that lay nervously holding the arm of the back of the seat, as if to steady her trembling frame, she started from her dream, and looked proudly at his flushed face.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Carlton," she said, "I wonder at your presumption, when you must suppose<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6520-00000034"/> that I should learn, since my residence here, what makes your words an insult. I repeat that my conduct this morning, which seems to have so strangely been misconstrued by you, was perfectly unconnected with the slightest memory of the friendship I may have felt for you when I believed you worthy of it. Your present behavior renders it necessary that from this time we should be strangers to each other. Such deception is unpardonable, insulting."</p>
               <p>"Then you know all, and you cannot forgive—you cannot pity; you only blame what is my deep misfortune, my misery," said Gerard, despairingly.</p>
               <p>"It is base to call that which is your own causing a misfortune—your treachery to an innocent girl," said Mabel.</p>
               <p>Gerard started; he could not for a moment comprehend her words, and then, supposing they referred to herself, and his attempt to win on her love and pity while his birth was yet so obscure and perhaps so stained, his pride took fire, and the hot blood rushed to his face.</p>
               <p>"Be it so, Mabel May," he replied; "you have spoken harshly, if truly, and scorned the devotion of an honest heart that would have died for you, had it availed for your happiness. You have added to the heavy burden of sorrow and shame that rests on my heart, and blighted the whole future that is before me, and some day you may feel a pang of remorse that you so harshly and hastily condemned me unheard; but you will hear no word of complaint or expostulation from me. Henceforth as you wish, we are strangers."</p>
               <p>The car was now entering the little carriage sweep before the pretty parsonage; and Gerard hastily jumped down, ere the horse stopped. He did not wait to assist Mabel from the car, or he might have felt the hand he would have touched was wet with tears, and that the thick veil over her face was drawn more tightly to conceal her flushed face. For a moment she began to doubt the evidence of her own senses, and to think that there could scarcely be deception or guilt in those proud words, that heart-struck look and tone. And yet, had he not confessed it? had he not admitted the truth of her accusation, though he resented her punishment of the offence? It was too true, too certain; and she was a weak, lovesick girl, she scornfully thought, to even cherish such doubts. A strong effort calmed her agitation, and when Mr. Seaforth conducted her to his little drawing-room, with his old fashioned courtesy, and then went to seek his sorrow-stricken guest in the study, Mabel had recovered her composure, and replied to his earnest entreaties that she would remain for a short time till he had dismissed Gerard and his mother to their home, when he would be at liberty to escort her to Bally Adams, with a smiling assent and assurance that "she should be proud to adopt him as her knight."</p>
               <p>Oh woman! woman! how powerful and deceptive is your pride and self-control when your feminine nature is outraged by real or fancied slight and deceit from one beloved!</p>
               <p>Mabel sank on a chair when left alone, and sighed as only an oppressed, outraged heart does sigh; and the tears sprang into her eyes, and the hot blood rushed to her forehead, as she recalled the insult that had been offered to her by one she had loved and trusted. One desire only remained; to leave a house and a neighborhood embittered by such painful associations; to fly from Gerard Carlton and all connected with him; to fly, if possible, from herself.</p>
               <p>As these thoughts engrossed her, she scarcely was conscious of the progress of time nor heard the sound of gentle footsteps approaching, till the door opened, and Mr. Seaforth appeared, leading in the same beautiful but sad and gentle looking woman, whose illness had excited her sympathy at the Bally-Adams' dinner-party.</p>
               <p>"My dear young lady," said Mr. Seaforth, "Mrs. Carlton is anxious to thank you herself for your share in delivering her son from so great a danger."</p>
               <p>Mabel rose involuntarily as Mrs. Carlton approached her with outstretched hands and a gentle, grateful smile; but as she advanced a step or two to meet her, Mrs. Carlton uttered an involuntary, half suppressed exclamation of surprise.</p>
               <p>"I am very grateful to you, more than I can express," she said, striving to speak calmly, though her eyes wandered restlessly over Mabel's face and form, and her hand trembled as it grasped the young girl's.</p>
               <p>"It was nothing, only a simple duty," replied Mabel. "Pray do not speak of it."</p>
               <p>"The voice—all, all so like!" murmured Mrs. Carlton, sinking on the sofa, where Mabel had risen. "Merciful Providence! is it possible? Young lady, pardon my apparent rudeness, but you are so like—so very like—a dear friend of my youth. Tell me: your father—what is his name?—where is he?—is it—is it—"</p>
               <p>"His name is Beaumont: not the same as my own," replied Mabel, half-terrified at the lady's vehemence; "I took the name of May from the will of an aunt. My father is now in America, but he will return soon. Tell me; did you know him?"</p>
               <p>A strange, puzzled look came on the beautiful but faded face of Mrs. Carlton.</p>
               <p>"And your mother?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"I never knew her," replied Mabel. "She died when I was born."</p>
               <p>"And do they say you resemble her?" asked Mrs. Carlton, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"No, I am considered like my father." replied Mabel. "But why, I entreat you to tell me, do you ask all this?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton had now somewhat recovered herself. She rose from her seat, and said gently, "Pardon me, I must have seemed very rude. It was a fancy—a delusion. I must be deceived by an accidental likeness, and thus appeared inquisitive and impertinent. Forgive me, and accept a mother's heartfelt gratitude and prayers for your happiness. May Heaven bless you!"</p>
               <p>Stooping down, Mrs. Carlton kissed Mabel's white brow, and hastily left the room. Mabel remained in bewildered, yet not unpleasant surprise. There had been something maternal in that blessing and gentle kiss, which went warm to her heart; and, against her better judgment, she could not but feel it precious from the mother of Gerard.</p>
               <p>A few minutes later Mabel heard the front door shut, and then Mr. Seaforth entered the room, and inquired whether she would not honor his poor house by taking some refreshment before returning to Bally Adams. A cup of tea and a tempting plate of toast were speedily brought by the old house-keeper, and Mabel, exhausted by so many contending emotions, did not refuse the refreshment which she so greatly needed, ere resuming her drive homewards.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>It need scarcely be said that Fanny Adams had suffered an agony of alarm and suspense on her supposed lover's account only second to that of Mabel May's, or perhaps it might be even more intense suffering on her part than in the young English girl's, since, though she would not, did not, believe him guilty, still it was but her own conviction, without any actual proof but her loving trust, while Mabel knew that the charge was a foul calumny.</p>
               <p>Fanny's attachment was no passing fancy; it was a firm, deep-seated, ardent love, and though she dared not even confess to her sister what was the real state of her heart, she nourished a secret hope that her affection might yet prove a happy one, in spite of the obstacles in the way of its gratification. Her father's dislike to such a match might, she thought, be overcome by degrees, so long as Gerard's character remained stainless. But now that the whole of her family combined to declare him guilty of a base crime, and all evinced the most bitter hatred towards him, her hopes died away, and her little remaining fortitude completely vanished.</p>
               <p>It was in vain that Fanny endeavored to conceal her distress and its cause from her sister Norah, who indeed had long been aware of the existence of the unfortunate passion, which she more than suspected was unrequited by its object, as well as completely opposed to their father's wishes. Yet, with loving delicacy of feeling, she said nothing that could wound her sister's sensitiveness; but while she watched her every movement and look, and administered every consolation in her power, she only appeared to think that Fanny's alarm and distress were natural where an old playmate and friend was concerned.</p>
               <p>Restless and unhappy, the girls at last wandered to a little bower where they often sat, and which commanded a view of the road from Garron's Hill. Fanny sank on a low seat of turf at her sister's feet, and covering her face with her hands, remained in silence and stillness for some time. Perhaps she was praying for the unhappy Gerard, or for strength to bear the load which had come upon her, and to conquer her sinful murmurings and impatience under the trial. Norah, too, was still and thoughtful; only from time to time did a gentle pressure of Fanny's hand, or a caressing finger passed over the smooth, glossy hair, speak the sympathy she felt. At last the sound of horse's feet aroused them—it was William Adam's horse; he had ridden on first, leaving the remainder of the party to follow more leisurely. The young man was in no mood for conversation; and besides, he was jealously eager to interrupt any chance Mabel and Gerard might have of an interview. He had therefore made an excuse for leaving his father, and galloped on at a pace that suited his irritated and galled feelings.</p>
               <p>"Norah," said Fanny, in an agitated voice, "will you go and ask what is the result?—I cannot."</p>
               <p>"Yes, dearest, if you will promise me to remain here calmly," replied Norah. "I will wave my handkerchief, where you can see me in the path, if the news is good."</p>
               <p>Fanny pressed her sister's hand, and Norah vanished like a fairy.</p>
               <p>"Ah," thought Fanny, the tears gushing down her cheeks, "how good and kind she is! She sees and knows all, and will not wound me by appearing to do so; she will wave her handkerchief to give me time to recover myself, and to save me some minutes of suspense. But I will confide in her, she merits it; and it will be a relief, and no shame to share my secret with a loving sister."</p>
               <p>In a few moments, which seemed ages to the agitated girl, the appointed signal was seen, and the snow-white handkerchief waved cheerily among the green trees of the shrubbery. Fanny's tears fell like rain; the sudden relief was a complete opening to their long dried-up source; and on Norah's appearance she finished the relieving flood on her sister's sympathising bosom.</p>
               <p>Oh, the sweet, precious tears of joy, when every drop seems to cool the fevered cheek and relieve the burdened heart, like the spring showers in the sunshine, making the leaves and blossoms start forth in sudden luxuriance. But though Norah knew the relief of such tears, and let them flow unchecked for a time, she became at last alarmed at the vehemence of her sister's long-continued weeping, and began to remonstrate.</p>
               <p>"Fanny, my darling sister," she said, tenderly, "you must not give way thus;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6520-00000035"/> bear up bravely, and be patient; all will be well at last, and you will be happy."</p>
               <p>"I am happy now, Norah," she replied; "the happiest of the happy, since he is innocent."</p>
               <p>"True, dearest," said Norah, "and for the time, after the alarm you have suffered, this knowledge will be a relief that will deaden all other feelings; but, darling sister, that too will pass away, and then other anxieties and uncertainties will agitate you. For Heaven's sake, dear, beware! restrain and govern your heart. Pardon me, but I can too well <choice>
                     <sic>ead</sic>
                     <corr>read</corr>
                  </choice> your secret; and, forgive a sister's anxiety, but are you sure that Gerard returns your affection?"</p>
               <p>"Oh Norah, spare me! I cannot bear it!" said Fanny hiding her face in her sister's bosom. "I know all you would say. I am indeed truly wretched; for, whatever he may have felt towards me before, what must he think of all our family now? He must hate and resent such treatment. Oh Norah, surely he did love me. But now what remains but for me to strive to forget him, for he will never forgive the injuries he has suffered."</p>
               <p>Norah had other fears besides the anger and resentment of the generous-hearted Gerard; but she thought it was better that her sister's thoughts should take that turn, than that she should suffer the pangs of jealousy towards Mabel May.</p>
               <p>"My darling Fanny," she said, "you forget that our father is still most opposed to such an idea as your marriage with Gerard. Be patient; we know not yet what may occur, but I think Gerard will never confound us with our hot-headed brothers. What say you to our writing a note of congratulation to Mrs. Carlton, to convince her that we have no share in the enmity to her son?"</p>
               <p>"Thanks, thanks, dearest," said Fanny; "how good and kind you are! You are right, Norah; I will try to bear up for your sake, and I would never disobey our father, only in one thing. If he ever asks me to marry anybody, except Gerard, I will not, cannot comply. In all else I will strive to be a dutiful daughter, and a loving sister to you, dear Norah."</p>
               <p>The girls now returned to the house, and went to their boudoir, where they were sure of not being interrupted by any one till Mabel's return.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Carlton and Gerard had not long returned to the house, when Mr. Seaforth was announced.</p>
               <p>"I thought I would just call in to see how you both were after the agitation you have gone through," he said, "and also bring you word that old Adams intends to send an apology in the course of the day. I brought him to reason—though he was in a towering passion when I first went in—and Miss May appeared to have displeased him as much as you have, Master Gerard."</p>
               <p>"It is of little consequence what Mr. Adams may think or do," replied Mrs. Carlton, with more spirit than the clergyman had ever seen her display. "He will not have it in his power to annoy or injure us again. I have made up my mind to leave, not only Athy, but Ireland altogether."</p>
               <p>Gerard started: he was surprised at his gentle, much-enduring mother's sudden assumption of dignity and resolution; and though he was thankful to leave the scene of so much mortification and wretchedness, his heart sank at the idea of losing sight so completely of Mabel May. With the inconsistency of love, he clung to the hope of seeing, of hearing of her, of proving to her the injustice she had done him, though he told himself that their parting had been really for ever, so far as any hope of winning her was concerned.</p>
               <p>"I am grieved to hear it, though scarcely surprised," said Mr. Seaforth. "You have I confess, suffered enough to disgust you with Athy."</p>
               <p>"It is not entirely this last shameful outrage that has decided me," said Mrs. Carlton, "I have reason to change my abode from the fear of my peaceful seclusion being intruded on; and, besides, Gerard is now of an age to go forth in the world. I always intended him to leave home finally at twenty-one. He wants not many days of that age, and I have determined to claim a promise which Sir Henry Purcell made me, and endeavor to place him in a Government office without delay. He has been shut up too long with a broken-spirited woman, and among people who have shown themselves so unworthy of our friendship. Am I not right, Mr. Seaforth?"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly right, my dear madam," was the reply, "and I admire the calm and dignified spirit in which you regard this unfortunate escapade of my old acquaintance, Adams. He is a hot-tempered Irishman, but I believe thoroughly honest and good-hearted, and in a few hours, when he is cool, will regret all this, as much as I do. But that charming girl, who came forward so nobly, has even more cause to complain than my friend Gerard; and she told me, as I drove her to Bally Adams, that she should return to Dublin in a few days, and wait her father's return there. I fancied, from a casual expression she let drop, that she is too attractive to be altogether safe from annoyance among so many inflammable sons of Erin, and must run away, like Helen of old, to avoid instead of create a deadly feud; eh, Gerard?"</p>
               <p>Gerard had, however, abruptly left the room; for the idea that Mabel could not even tolerate the idea of a casual meeting, and an accidental glimpse of her, after the scene of the morning was too painful, and he feared to betray his secret to his mother or his old friend, Mr. Seaforth.</p>
               <p>"I am not sorry Gerard has left us," said Mrs. Carlton; "I do not like him to think I have any unnecessary concealment from him, and yet I do not wish to create hopes in his young, sanguine nature that may be altogether delusive. Look here: this was left one evening, a few days since, at the cottage, by a man closely muffled, who told the servant to give it me when alone, and to say it was from an old friend who wished me well."</p>
               <p>Mr. Seaforth took the small paper handed to him, and read with interest the few lines it contained.</p>
               <p>"If Mrs. Carlton is the same lady who lived near Taunton about twenty years ago, she is informed that a friend is near, who has some important information to give her. But, as it may affect the happiness of others, and the welfare of many, it is indeed necessary to be cautious, more especially as since the writer has been in this very neighbor-hood he has accidentally seen one deeply implicated in the matter in question. If Mrs. Carlton will place a letter in the hollow of the fallen oak tree, near the ruin on Bally Adams Hill, with her reply, and satisfactory proofs of her identity, she shall hear more ere long from—TAUNTON."</p>
               <p>"And did you do as he desired?" asked Mr. Seaforth.</p>
               <p>"I did," she replied; "but no result has yet accrued, and I begin to think the whole affair a mere hoax; I did take the precaution to go and see whether the letter had been removed, and it was certainly not there, but it is now a week since, and no further notice has been taken of it. I think when I have settled Gerard in London, I shall go to Taunton, painful as it would be, and see if any relatives of my old servant Jenny, or of the woman who nursed me, are living; it might give some clue to this mysterious announcement."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible," said Mr. Seaforth, after musing for a few moments,—"pardon the question—that there could be any mistake; that you are not as unfortunate as you feared?"</p>
               <p>"I know not," replied Mrs. Carlton—"I fear to even admit the idea; and yet,—I do think that bears the impress of truth."</p>
               <p>"So do I," said the clergyman; "but it is strange it should not have been followed up by the writer. However, I will be on the watch when you are gone; and if you will keep me apprised of your address, I will take care to let you know if anything occurs which it is desirable you should hear. And now I must go—I have many sick calls to make."</p>
               <p>When the rector was gone, Mrs. Carlton fell into deep and anxious thought.</p>
               <p>"That face," she murmured; "so like; the voice,—so completely the softened ring of the tones that beguiled me to my misery—can it be? My heart yearned so to the girl, that it almost seemed as if some mysterious link united me to her; and yet, if it is as I think, I ought rather to shrink from her with dread. Thank Heaven, Gerard will be separated from her; she is so lovely, he must be attracted by her; and yet such a misfortune would be too fearful to be even contemplated without horror. Sooner would I break my vow, and tell him all, than run the chance that my supposition may be <choice>

                  </choice>, and the fair girl my— But no, they will never meet again, and he is so young, he will soon forget, if he has ever dreamed of that sweet face, or cherished young visions of future happiness. My poor boy, I must save you at any cost from the consequences of your mother's errors, if it be possible."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton sat long in profound thought, and then rousing herself, she prepared to write the projected notice to Mr. Adams, informing him that she should quit his house in fifteen days from that time.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <p>SCARCELY had Mrs. Carlton dispatched the notice to Mr. Adams, when the kindly note of congratulation from Fanny and Norah was brought to her, and drew pleasant tears into her eyes, as a proof that she was still regarded with affection and interest by the two girls, whom she had watched with maternal kindness during their progress from childhood to womanhood. She wrote a brief but affectionate answer, expressing a hope that she should see them before leaving Athy for ever, as she very soon should do, and dispatched it by the servant who had brought the note from Bally Adams.</p>
               <p>After finishing the carefully-concocted note, Norah left her sister in the boudoir, and went to receive her father's orders for the day, according to the rule at Bally Adams; and Fanny, once more alone and unrestrained, yielded to the sorrow and torturing anxieties which her sister's cheering words and firmer nature had deadened for a time.</p>
               <p>"Shall I ever see him more?" she murmured; "dare I hope that he loves me, and for my sake will pardon the insults he has received? Oh Gerard, Gerard! you cannot feel for me as I do for you. I am not worthy of you. I have too long let my poor weak heart dwell on that noble spirit, that manly courage, the intellect that placed him so far above me. No; how can he think of one so far beneath him when Mabel is near, so beautiful and graceful, so accomplished, so—; but then she has not the love to give that I have lavished on him; she treats him with proud coldness. Ah! how gladly would I lay all my gifts and fortune at his feet were I like her; but now—"</p>
               <p>Norah opened the door gently, and Fanny started up like a guilty thing, pretending to<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6520-00000036"/> be busy arranging some faded flowers on the table. She saw not at first her sister's pitying looks, till a gentle hand was laid on that which was tremblingly arranging, or rather disarranging the flowers.</p>
               <p>"Fanny, pet, I have news for you that will try your courage," said Norah; "but you must bear up for my sake dearest. Gerard is—"</p>
               <p>"Is what?—engaged to Mabel?" asked Fanny with a strange, constrained smile. "I expected it after what she has done; happy girl!"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, dear, nothing of that kind," said Norah; "only, papa has had a note from Mrs. Carlton, and she informs him that she and Gerard will leave Athy and Ireland itself, in a few days, and most probably not to return."</p>
               <p>Fanny sat for a few moments in stunned and motionless silence; her face was very pale, but no tears came, and the rigidity of her features alarmed her sister.</p>
               <p>"Fanny, Fanny dearest, speak to me!" cried Norah; "do not look like that; he will come back; he will write to you; I will go to Mrs. Carlton, do anything, if you will only try to be calm, and speak to your Norah."</p>
               <p>Fanny, tried to speak, nay, even to smile, in reply to her anxious sister's loving words; but the effort was too great, and she burst into a flood of hysterical sobs, and tears, which, in a few moments, brought both their father and Mabel May into the room. Adams stood for a few moments in speechless and alarmed distress at the sight.</p>
               <p>"Norah, what ails your sister?" he cried. "Fanny, my darling, compose yourself; there, there, you will break your old father's heart." But in another instant the probable cause of the distress flashed upon him, and he exclaimed, in his harshest tones, "Fanny—Miss Adams, for you are no longer my Fanny—you are a disobedient daughter. Did I not tell you—did I not warn you that I would have no such idiocy as you are indulging? I tell you I will never own you again if you dare to carry on a correspondence with that young, nameless—"</p>
               <p>Before he could finish the sentence Fanny had sunk back in her sister's arms in a state of insensibility.</p>
               <p>Adams's mouth twitched as he saw his favorite daughter lying thus prostrate and senseless, and knew his own hardness to be in part the cause of her distress, but he would not confess the pang of remorse that shot through him.</p>
               <p>"Norah, my dear," said Adams, as he turned to leave the room, "attend to your sister, and when she returns to consciousness, I trust it will be to a better mind."</p>
               <p>Norah, assisted by the almost equally pale-looking Mabel, devoted herself to the task of restoring the poor girl to life, but it was long before she opened her eyes, and when she once more became sensible of what was passing round her, she begged so piteously to be left alone, and that no one but Norah should be allowed to see her for the remainder of the day, that Mabel quietly left the room, without even learning the immediate cause of the scene she had witnessed; but her face was very proud and white as she descended the stairs to the drawing-room; and the determination which she intended to announce to her host, of returning in a few days to Dublin, was now altered to the yet more summary plan of leaving Bally Adams the day but one after, under the escort of Edward Adams, who on that day was to take his departure for the capital. She found Mr. Adams in a state of mingled grief and rage, which would have blended the comic with the serious in the eyes of a less interested observer.</p>
               <p>"Zounds!" he was exclaiming, as Mabel entered, "the young scoundrel might have taken the money, as I partly believe he has, and welcome,—ay, and thrice as much, and I could have forgiven it; but to steal the heart of my darling, my pride, my pretty Fanny,—to entangle her young affections, while I was trustingly extending my hospitality towards him; it is base—treacherous—infamous! I will never forgive him—never, nor her either, if she persists in her folly; and then, I suppose—"</p>
               <p>Here his voice became husky as the image of his pale, insensible child rose before him.</p>
               <p>"My dear father," said Edward, "the fellow is going away, you know; there is nothing to fear. Fanny will soon forget him, and be as bright and happy as ever when he's out of the country."</p>
               <p>"Silence, you puppy!" exclaimed Adams, glad to vent his rage on some one more tangible than the absent Gerard; "do you think my daughter can fall in and out of love, as you do in and out of a ditch when you are hunting? No, it will be her death; I shall lose my pet—my darling. I tell you, you audacious blockhead, I would rather see you taken by a press gang, and sent off to sea, than follow my pretty Fanny to the grave."</p>
               <p>"Then, why not give your consent?" asked Edward, half maliciously.</p>
               <p>"You are an impudent rascal!" roared Adams, more incensed than ever; "and by Heavens, if you are not off to Dublin on Thursday morning, I will kick you out of Bally Adams, and never let me see you attempt to enter its doors again."</p>
               <p>Edward sat in blank surprise at the unwonted burst, but his father was not to be appeased, even by his submissive silence.</p>
               <p>"Leave the room, sir!" he exclaimed. but almost in the same breath he added. "Come to my study; I want you to write a letter to—"</p>
               <p>The door was shut before the name was uttered, and Mabel found herself alone with William Adams, almost before she could recover her breath at the extraordinary outburst of rage to which her host had given way, still less find a chance of announcing her intended departure. But the agitations of the day were not yet over for poor Mabel.</p>
               <p>Scarcely had the sound of Mr. Adams's voice died away, when William, suddenly leaving the window where he had been standing during the late scene, addressed her.</p>
               <p>"Mabel," said he. "I am miserable, jealous, angry, even with you, whom I admire and love beyond all created beings. Have pity on me; tell me that there is some hope for me—that you do not care for that cursed coxcomb who has brought such misery among us. Forgive me, Mabel, but I am honest and true-hearted, though I know I am not worthy of you, and I would give my very life to make you happy."</p>
               <p>Mabel had not interrupted these rapidly spoken words, simply because she was fairly petrified by the unlooked-for avowal. Accustomed to far more open and polished adulation and homage than she had ever received at Bally Adams, it had never entered her head that there could be the wildest probability of either of the hopeful scions of the house dreaming of any such catastrophe as falling in love. And though she had perhaps considered William the most tolerable and the most attentive of the two brothers, she was as completely unprepared for his unwelcome proposal as for a similar honor from her host himself.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Adams," she said, as soon as she could recover her faculties, "I believe you do not mean to pain, still less to insult me, though your words might easily be interpreted in that sense. You cannot presume to suppose that a man who is engaged to your sister can be anything but a perfect object of indifference to me. And for yourself, pardon my assuring you, that you can never be more to me than the brother of my friend; and that I shall deem it an outrage on my feelings if you even mention the subject again."</p>
               <p>William was naturally fiery, and his Irish blood was irritated by Mabel's ill-concealed vexation and surprise.</p>
               <p>"Is it so, indeed, Miss Mabel May?" he said, passionately. "You despise an honest and honorable man's love, and dare to taunt him with it, as if it were an insult for an Irish gentleman to aspire to your hand. Then I tell you plainly, that I know you do love Gerard Carlton, and that the distinguished object of the proud Miss May's affection is a base-born son of an unknown father, and that neither he nor his mother has any right to the name of Carlton. And, what is more, he has long been carrying on the same game with my foolish sister, and they have been lovers ever since they were as high as that rosebush. Perhaps you will confess I am not alone in disappointed affection now—proud, unfeeling girl—though I have less reason to be ashamed of my love than you have."</p>
               <p>The angry young man rushed from the room. He had had his revenge; poor Mabel had sunk on the chair, and covered her face with her hands in the shame and agony of her spirit. She had but one burning desire—to get away from the hated spot that had witnessed her misery and humiliation, and to try if possible to bury all its degrading associations from her memory, and tear the unworthy object of her affection for ever from her heart.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams had left Edward in the study after giving him some brief and not very intelligible directions for a letter to a lawyer in Dublin, and rushed out into the open air to cool the fever of his still boiling indignation. Unluckily his keen eyes first encountered the stockingless legs of Carey (the messenger sent by Norah to Mrs. Carlton) protruding through the hayrack in the stable, where the poor fellow had taken refuge on hearing his master's well-known voice in the distance.</p>
               <p>"Come out of that, you spalpeen! What is it you are after there? and where have you been all day?" roared Adams.</p>
               <p>"Plase your honor, and sure I'm only looking after the hens' nests, and I've been to Athy to-day to carry a bit of a note from the young mistresses to Mrs. Carlton."</p>
               <p>"What, what!" cried Adams; "a note? Zounds! if you tell me a lie, I'll run the hayfork through your half-starved body."</p>
               <p>"Mercy on me, your honor!" said Carey; "It's the gospel truth I'm telling you; and sure I only did as I was bid."</p>
               <p>"Was the note to Mr. or Mrs. Carlton, you gomeril?"</p>
               <p>"Faith, and is it your honor's axing me the question, when sure and certain your honor knows I don't know an A from a pitchfork?"</p>
               <p>"To whom did they tell you to give it?"</p>
               <p>"To nobody, plase your honor; but just to lave it at the house, and ax if there was any answer.</p>
               <p>"And who gave you your orders?"</p>
               <p>"Miss Norah, your honor."</p>
               <p>"All conspire against me," groaned Adams. "My own children combine to oppose me; but zounds, I'll make them repent it!"</p>
               <p>He hastened back to the house, and rushing up the stairs to the room where Norah was still quietly watching over her sister, he burst in without ceremony with flashing eyes, and loud, overbearing tones.</p>
               <p>"You rebellious children!" he exclaimed, "I have discovered your correspondence with young Carlton, in defiance of my orders; give me his answer this instant, or I'll—I'll—"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, indeed, father, you wrong us," said Norah, while Fanny lay white and trembling on her couch; "we only sent a few lines to congratulate Mrs. Carlton on her son's safety; and pardon me, if I say I think<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6520-00000037"/> it was due to her after our sad mistake and the terrible agitation it must have caused her. I should have told you of it as soon as I had an opportunity; I never would willingly deceive you in anything."</p>
               <p>Norah had perhaps more influence over her father than either of his children, (always excepting William,) and her firm, yet gentle reproof somewhat abashed him—"And what did she say?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Here is the reply," said Norah, handing him the note.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, "a pretty thing, indeed!—a regular go-between! She wants her base-born son to marry my well-dowered daughter; but she is mistaken in her plans, deep as they are. I will be even with her. So long as that young, treacherous viper remains in the county, you will remain strictly confined to the house—no, not even shall you venture into the garden. I will give you the range of the house, unless I have any more cause to suspect you; but, by St. Patrick, if I have, I'll lock you both up, and let no one come near you, except to bring you your meals for the next fortnight—do you hear?"</p>
               <p>"We shall observe your directions till you think more calmly of the subject," said Norah, firmly. "If you will give me a moment's interview to-morrow morning, you shall have no reason to complain that your children do not confide in you; and then you will be able better to form a decision in the matter.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, you do what you like, in spite of me, you little rogue of Erin!" said her father, melted for the moment by Norah's caresses, and Fanny's pale, crushed looks. "But mind, all depends on your obedience; and the slightest attempt to deceive me will ruin all that you've set your perverse hearts on."</p>
               <p>The old man shut the door as he spoke with somewhat less force than he had opened it, and Norah drew from the stormy interview more hope and comfort for her sister than she had dared to anticipate from her father's well-known obstinacy and strong passions. But an unlooked-for auxiliary came to her aid in the very person from whom she would have least expected help in her efforts for her sister.</p>
               <p>Adams had sought refuge in his study after leaving his daughter's apartment, and ere many minutes was joined by his son William, pale and rigid-looking, as his father had never yet seen him.</p>
               <p>"My boy, what is it? what has happened?" he said, anxiously.</p>
               <p>"Mabel May has refused, scorned me, father!" replied William.</p>
               <p>"Refused! scorned you, my son, my heir!" exclaimed Adams. "The proud English minx, she shall suffer for it, never fear, my boy! Adams of Bally Adams never forgets either friend or foe. The coquette! the jilt! And with all her sweet hypocritical ways! But I'll punish her, William, never fear. Don't be downhearted, lad—there are plenty more as good as she is, with all her pretty fortune!"</p>
               <p>"That's what I came to say," returned William; "I am your son, and I have your character so far; I cannot forgive an insult, and I will never forget a favor. Now, will you hear me patiently, and sacrifice something for me, in order to accomplish my plans?"</p>
               <p>"Ay, boy; there are few things I would not do for you," said his father.</p>
               <p>"Listen, then," said William: "The man for whom I am scorned is the very man for whom Fanny is breaking her heart, and who would naturally grasp eagerly at such a match as your daughter will be, if you choose. Nay, hear me out. It is in our power to stab this proud girl to the core, and let her taste the bitter cup she has given me. Give your consent to Fanny's engagement to young Carlton; let Mabel May hear of it, know it, see them together. It will cut her to the quick, and prove a worthy revenge."</p>
               <p>"But, zounds, William, are you mad!" exclaimed Adams. Marry your sister to an obscure, base-born, half-penniless young scapegrace like that! Why, your brain must be turned to think of it."</p>
               <p>"You are right, father," said William, with a cold, bitter smile; "my brain does seem turned; I never would have dreamed that any woman could have such power over me as this girl has used so cruelly. But I am not so wild in my ideas as you think. Look here!" he said, drawing from his pocket a small, crumpled paper, which had evidently been carefully folded and sealed, but damp and discolored by exposure to the weather. "I found this in the trunk of the fallen oak tree the morning after that business near the ruin; and, what's more, I could distinctly trace blood-marks, half-washed out by the rain that fell in the night. After all, I believe that shot was not for nothing, though Darby escaped the bullet."</p>
               <p>Adams hastily put on his glasses, but the writing was half defaced with damp, and he could not decipher it.</p>
               <p>"Read if, boy," said he; "I can't make out the precious bit of ill-looking writing at all. It's no good, that's certain."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me," said William; "I believe it may be of importance if well managed. I will read you what I have made out, and it is addressed, if you notice, to Mrs. Stephenson, but I'm confident it's meant for Mrs. Carlton."</p>
               <p>William Adams read the paper to his father. It ran thus:—</p>

               <p>"Well, what do you make of that gipsy-like scrawl?" he asked, as his son concluded.</p>
               <p>"It is difficult to say," replied William; "but my own opinion is that it comes from some one who knows the real birth of Gerard Carlton and believes he can establish his rights to some large property, or may be even a title. Now, if it be so, it will be a capital stroke of policy to secure him for Fanny; but if not, you could always get out of it in some way, before the marriage finally took place; and in any case, it will prove to that proud, cold girl, that the man she loves does not care for her."</p>
               <p>"Go on, boy, you're no fool, that's certain, even in your passion," said the admiring father.</p>
               <p>"Then my plan is this," said William: "Call on Mrs. Carlton, tell her of the attachment you have discovered between her son and your daughter, and your paternal willingness to waive some great objections and difficulties, for Fanny's sake, and from your high opinion of her, and your regard for Gerard. But, of course, delay the final arrangements till his prospects are more fixed in life, and make every fair and reasonable concession as to correspondence, and so forth. Now, do you see my meaning?"</p>
               <p>"I do, lad, I do," replied Adams; "and then—you see, I always like to be straight-forward, and if the lad should get on, even if this gipsy stuff meant nothing—why, I would not draw back, and poor Fanny would not break her heart. Yes, yes, you are the comfort and pride of my life, my boy, and I will take your advice. You've got your father's brains, that's certain, and you shall have his money too, and a rich and pretty wife into the bargain before I die. And Garron's Hill, William; what of that, do you think?"</p>
               <p>"Patience and watchfulness is all that remains to us at present," observed William, who was in no mood for abstract discussions. "One thing at a time. But you must be careful not to let Mrs. Carlton know anything about this paper."</p>
               <p>"No, no, lad; but is it not felony if it should be found out?" said Adams.</p>
               <p>"Not a bit of it," replied William; "the letter is not addressed to Mrs. Carlton, but to Mrs. Stephenson; and certainly we are not at all bound to imagine that it is meant for Mrs. Carlton. No, there is no reason to hesitate in the matter, and I am confident our plans will succeed."</p>
               <p>"I trust you, my boy," said his father; "and let me see you take heart, and not fret about a woman, let her be ever so handsome. Why, when I was your age, I was refused twice; but I got the best wife of the three in your poor mother—rest her soul!"</p>
               <p>"Oh no; I don't mean to break my heart; but I should not be sorry to see Mabel May repent her haughtiness, that's all," said William, with a bitter smile; and he left the room, unwilling that his father should read the conflict which still shook his whole soul too powerfully to be altogether concealed.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
               <p>THAT same evening chance favored the plans of the father and son. A note arrived from Mrs. Carlton, requesting that some one might he sent to receive the rent that was due, as she might possibly leave Athy even sooner than she expected. Accordingly, Mr. Adams set off on his trusty Black Jack early the following morning, and to his great satisfaction found the lady alone, Gerard having gone to call on Mr. Seaforth.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton received her visitor with a courteous but somewhat distant greeting, which he could of course well understand.</p>
               <p>"Madam," he said, "I could not part with an old friend and valued tenant like yourself, without a less formal interview than a mere business transaction. I wish to repeat to you the regret which I had great pleasure in at once expressing in writing for the pain and disgrace I was the unfortunate cause of inflicting on you. I can perfectly imagine what you felt on the occasion; I am a parent as well as yourself."</p>
               <p>"I willingly accept your apology, Mr. Adams, and I do feel that you are sincere in your regret," said Mrs. Carlton. "Indeed, I assure you I did not resent so much your hasty charge against my son—though I could hardly have believed you would for an instant have imagined him guilty—as I did the causeless and galling slights offered by your sons when he was last at your house. But let all be forgotten; we are about to part most probably forever, and I am anxious that it should be in the same kindly friendship as that in which we have lived."</p>
               <p>"I hope you are mistaken, my good lady," said Adams, nervously; "I should be extremely sorry, if I thought our friendship,<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6520-00000038"/> I may say, our connection ended here; indeed, I may say, it will be your own fault if it does."</p>
               <p>"Really, Mr. Adams, I am much flattered by your good wishes," said Mrs. Carlton; "but my—I may say, our future movements are so uncertain, and depend comparatively so little on my own will, that probably we may never meet again."</p>
               <p>"I am not the only one who will regret the separation," said Adams, again fidgeting nervously. "There are two, who, I fancy, would not get over it so easily as myself."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton looked with surprise at the embarrassed Adams, and waited in silence for an explanation.</p>
               <p>"I'm a straightforward man, Mrs. Carlton," he continued; "no beating about the bush for me; so in plain English I tell you I have reason to think your son and my Fanny have taken a fancy to each other, and I'm not the man to thwart young folks if it can be helped, though I can't say I liked it at first, because you see I've got together a pretty property, and I look for my children to rise in the world; and I consider my girls may look high for husbands—they're pretty girls, and will have good fortunes, and—"</p>
               <p>"I assure you, Mr. Adams," interrupted Mrs. Carlton, "that neither I nor my son—"</p>
               <p>"Pooh, pooh!" exclaimed Adams; "I know all about it, my dear lady; so hear me out. I said I did not like it at first, and I was pretty sharp with poor Fanny about it, and I blamed your son for stealing away her heart when no one suspected it; but when I came to think about it, and talked to Norah <unclear>caludy</unclear>, and questioned her, I found the young man had acted most honorably, and never said a word to Fanny that I should not approve; so I like him, and the girl is fretting her heart out; in a word, I've made up my mind to let them think of each other, though they're too young to get married at present."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton's breath had been fairly taken away by the unexpected revelation, and she had not time to reflect on the probability or advantages of the novel ideas it presented, before the pause made by the visitor called for some reply on her part.</p>
               <p>"My dear sir, I am much flattered by your kind and liberal intentions," she replied; "but I really am so taken by surprise—I had never even thought of marriage or love in connection with my son: he has his way yet to make, and is so young, and—"</p>
               <p>"True, true," said Adams; "of course they must wait; only I will not stand in the way of their seeing or writing to each other; and when Mr. Gerard is once in a fair way to do well, I would do my part. Fanny and Norah will each have six thousand pounds on their marriage, and more at my death, and that is not to be despised, you see—eh, Mrs. Carlton?"</p>
               <p>"My dear sir," said Mrs. Carlton, "I assure you I should most sincerely welcome your daughters as mine, for I have always felt a sincere affection for both of them from their childhood, but I must first speak to Gerard on the subject. I know he would make no mercenary marriage; and though the fortune you speak of is greater than he has any right to look for in a wife, it would not tempt him to insult your daughter by a hand without a heart. I have but little to give him at my death, only a slender competence; and his own exertions alone can make him a fitting match for her in point of money."</p>
               <p>"Spoken like the sensible, honorable, straightforward woman that you are, Mrs. Carlton," said Adams; "you are just of my own sort, and I hope we shall be closer connected. But a year or two will do no harm to the young folks; and if nothing turns up in the mean time, they must have patience."</p>
               <p>Adams's little grey eyes looked sharply at Mrs. Carlton as he spoke; and a slight color did perhaps rise on her pale check, but otherwise no sign of emotion or surprise gratified his anxious gaze.</p>
               <p>"Any way," he resumed, "my Fanny is a very different sort of a girl from that haughty little flirt who has been stopping with us. She's not the one to do them any good, and, for my part, I'm glad she's going."</p>
               <p>This time there was an unmistakable emotion on the sweet face of Mrs. Carlton.</p>
               <p>"Miss May is leaving you, then?" she said. "Has her father returned?"</p>
               <p>The tone was low and hoarse, but Adams scarcely remarked it in the plenitude of his self-occupation.</p>
               <p>"Not that I know of, nor care," replied Adams. "She's welcome to come and go at her pleasure; I shouldn't be surprised if the fortune she's so proud of goes to smash. I've no opinion of these wandering, half-foreign gentlemen that leave their children, and wives too sometimes, and get money no one knows how, nor how much. But, you're not well, Mrs. Carlton; I've talked too much, perhaps?"</p>
               <p>"No—only—I am never very strong." replied Mrs. Carlton, "and the agitation of the other night has left me nervous and weak. When does Miss May leave for Dublin? or—where did you say?"</p>
               <p>"She goes to-morrow with my son Ned to Dublin, and I suppose will stop there for her precious father to come over and take her to England," said Adams. "I heard some talk of Devonshire, I fancy, or thereabouts, as the part of the country where they'd got some property; but I really don't trouble my head about such things. And now I'll wish you good day. You can send Mr. Gerard to speak for himself, and I won't forbid his seeing my Fanny when he comes,—eh, Mrs. Carlton? We were young once, you know, ourselves."</p>
               <p>The proprietor of Bally Adams now set off again on his favorite steed, confident in the success of his errand.</p>
               <p>Left to her calmer thoughts, Mrs. Carlton began to weigh the advantages of the match so unexpectedly proposed for her son. She knew, better than any one besides, how terribly Gerard would suffer from the cloud that must necessarily hang over his birth and history; how difficult it would be for him to form a marriage as advantageous in many respects as the one now offered for him. Fanny Adams was pretty, gentle, well educated, and evidently devoted to Gerard; she was at least respectably connected, and her fortune would be larger than Gerard could have looked for in the most sanguine anticipations. If he loved her, and was not averse to the connection, there were numerous and cogent reasons why it should not be rejected, and she would lose no time in ascertaining the state of his feelings. Just as she had come to this conclusion, the well-known step was heard, though less buoyant and quick than of old, and in another moment Gerard entered the room.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Adams has been here, Gerard," said his mother, after a few passing questions and answers as to his late call on the rector.</p>
               <p>"Indeed," said her son, with a darkening brow; "I hope he did not annoy or insult you, my dear mother?"</p>
               <p>"Far from it, Gerard," she replied; "he expressed the kindest sentiments for you and for me; and, indeed, gave the greatest proof he could of his regard and good feeling."</p>
               <p>"Rather a sudden change, methinks," said the young man bitterly, for the insult he had received rankled deep in his mind.</p>
               <p>"Nay, my dear boy, it is not like you to be so resentful when a frank apology is made," said his mother; "and surely, if I am not mistaken, there are reasons which should make you more gently inclined where Bally Adams and its inmates are concerned."</p>
               <p>"I do not understand you, mother," said Gerard, flushing crimson, and busying himself with a favorite spaniel as he spoke.</p>
               <p>"Is there no one at Bally Adams who is dear enough to make you excuse the mistakes and hasty proceedings of its master," said his mother, "especially when overtures are made to you in her name, and for her sake?"</p>
               <p>"From her," repeated Gerard, in a low, agitated voice. "Impossible!"</p>
               <p>"Not impossible, my dear boy," said Mrs. Carlton;" Mr. Adams has been here, evidently for that especial object. He is quite willing to give his consent, that is, to permit your engagement, though not any speedy marriage."</p>
               <p>"His consent,—engagement!" repeated Gerard; "am I dreaming, mother, or you?"</p>
               <p>"My dear boy, it is you, if either of us," replied his mother. "Fanny Adams is evidently a most true-hearted and disinterested girl, and her father is far less mercenary and selfish than I had given him credit for. I am satisfied, that if you really love her it will be no undesirable connection."</p>
               <p>Gerard looked in his mother's face with eyes opened to their fullest extent, and a face pale with disappointment and chagrin.</p>
               <p>"Mother," said he, "this is some mistake, some terrible misunderstanding. There has never been the least word of love between me and Fanny Adams."</p>
               <p>"I know that you have never spoken to her, Gerard, and her father appreciates the honor and reserve you have shown; but it is no longer necessary, as you have Mr. Adam's free consent to try to win his daughter, and I do not suppose you will have much difficulty with the young lady herself."</p>
               <p>Gerard's face had varied from pale to red, and red to pale during his mother's speech, but when she had finished, he exclaimed hoarsely, "Mother, you are completely, cruelly deceived. I do not—never should love Fanny Adams; nay more, I love another."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton's countenance grew as troubled as her son's.</p>
               <p>"Love another!" she repeated; "and yet never confided in your mother, Gerard? Who is it?—not—surely not—Mabel May? Say it is not, my dear, dear son."</p>
               <p>"And why not, mother?" he demanded. "I know my affection is hopeless—mad, perhaps; but I know not why you should be so horrified at a feeling so natural. You have seen her; can you wonder I should love her?"</p>
               <p>"I have seen her, Gerard," was the reply. "She is dangerously lovely and attractive, and so was one whom I dare not name; but life-long woe and wrong were the result of those fatal fascinations. Gerard, by your love and duty to me, by the devotion of long years, which I have dedicated to you alone, I adjure you, give up this madness, forget Mabel May, and try to return the spontaneous and devoted affection which you have inspired in a gentle and winning girl. You would soon learn to love her, Gerard, and it would cheer my sad life, sweeten my last days, which I feel are not far distant, to know that your future happiness and prosperity were secured by such a marriage. Is it very much for a lonely, broken-spirited mother to ask of the son to whom she has given her whole life, and who is all she has left in the world to comfort or soften the hard and bitter sorrow she has endured?"</p>
               <p>Gerard had covered his face with his hands as his mother spoke, and many confused and sad thoughts of the past, present, and future crowded into his mind. Sweet memories of gentle words and looks, and implied encouragement of his unconcealed admiration and tenderness,—proud looks, bitter-sounding taunts still sounding in his ears,—visions of<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6520-00000039"/> the lonely, despised, struggling future which might await him, and which Mabel's cold, biting scorn had deprived him of buoyant energy and courage to combat, as he might have done for her dear sake,—all floated mistily before him, and his mother's pleading tones, her touching entreaties, mingled dreamily in the confused tumult of his brain.</p>
               <p>"Mother, spare me! let me think," he said; "it is all so new, so strange to me; I never even thought of those girls but as dear friends and playfellows. I must have time before I can decide. Surely we have no need to meet hastily the advances of those who have so grossly insulted and injured us."</p>
               <p>"Gerard, we have not so many friends as to cast any from us," replied his mother. "For myself, it matters little; but you, on the very threshold of life, alone, without name or fortune, or;—but I will not torture you or myself with these wretched, galling reflections; only I entreat you to think well and deeply ere you decide. I will not speak to you of it again till to-morrow, and then we shall both be more calm."</p>
               <p>Gerard gladly seized the reprieve offered to him, and with an affectionate pressure of his mother's hand, he left the room and hastily rushed from the house. He wanted air, <choice>
                     <sic>fredom</sic>
                     <corr>freedom</corr>
                  </choice>, power to breathe, and think, and cool the fever of his mind, as the confinement of four walls was intolerable to him. He walked rapidly on for some minutes, scarcely knowing where he went, and was just entering the wood which was one of the paths to Bally Adams, when he met Carey, the ragged ne'er-do-well, but shrewd and observant hanger-on at that incongruous establishment.</p>
               <p>"Eh, faith, and it's your honor's going to Bally Adams?" said the man, stopping full in Gerard's path.</p>
               <p>"Certainly not, Carey; why should you think so?" he asked, making a step further in advance with a look that would have daunted an ordinary domestic; but Tim was not to be baulked of his purpose so easily.</p>
               <p>"Why should I think so, your honor?" said Carey; "why, to ask after the dear sweet angel that's breaking her heart for you to be sure. Why, didn't she cry her pretty blue eyes nearly out of her head when you were in throuble, though she tried to hide it as well as she could; and then, when her father found out what she was fretting about, and stormed at her like a roaring lion—as the masther is when he's put out, though he's a good heart too—why, then, didn't she fall in a dead fit, and they thought she was dead, and they say she's never held her head up since, no more than a lily that's broken the stalk; and it's your doing, Masther Gerard; and, in course, I thought you were going to see her and comfort her—as you're in duty bound, to my thinking."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Carey, you are mistaken," said Gerard. "It was no doubt a shock to Miss Adams to have an old friend accused of such a crime; but there was never anything of what you fancy between us. The young lady would be sadly offended if she heard such nonsense."</p>
               <p>"Not a bit, your honor," said Carey; "there's no shame in having a lover, and, in course, you're one that no young lady need be ashamed of; and it's meself that wishes you both good luck, for she has as sweet and pretty a colleen as ever pressed shamrock under foot. And—so I'll wish the top of the morning to your honor."</p>
               <p>Tim Carey passed on, having succeeded in putting his auditor in a state of mind more stormy and perplexed than he could have imagined or comprehended, as the result of his diplomacy. The idea of Fanny, gentle, good, lovely as she certainly was, suffering, perhaps in danger, for his sake, and perhaps from some involuntarily but sufficient imprudence of his, led to believe her affection returned, was a powerful contrast to the proud, scornful Mabel May, who had rejected his heart's devotion as an insult to herself. Should he not save and make happy the tender-hearted girl, who had risked the scorn and displeasure of father and friends for his sake, and teach the unfeeling heiress that his heart was not broken by her coldness, and that her power was far less than she had proudly supposed?</p>
               <p>Gerard was young, impetuous, proud, smarting under the disappointment of his deep and honest love; could it be wondered at if he deceived himself, and believed that he was making a noble and praiseworthy self-sacrifice in yielding to his mother's prayer, to Fanny's silent devotion, and her father's earnest and frank proposal, and promising his hand, even if he could not his heart, to the old playmate of his childhood?</p>
               <p>With characteristic impetuosity Gerard determined to clinch his wavering resolution ere it had time to change. He hastened on to Bally Adams, and demanded of the astonished domestic a few minutes' conversation with Miss Norah. The worthy old servitor might perhaps have hesitated had any of the masculine part of the family been in the house, but as only his young ladies and Miss May were at home, and as, with Irish quickness, he had divined somewhat the present turn in the family politics, he contented himself with saying he would go and see if Miss Norah could leave her sister. "Miss May is packing up," he said, "and Miss Norah is in the sick-room."</p>
               <p>This confirmation of Carey's report acted favorably on Gerard's resolution, and he walked into the well-known drawing-room with a firmer step and more resolute air than he would have done half-an-hour before.</p>
               <p>In a few moments Norah appeared; her cheeks were a little flushed and her manner slightly embarrassed as she greeted him, but this might be the natural result of the late unpleasant events, and Gerard was too pre-occupied to notice it.</p>
               <p>"Norah," he said, plunging at once into his subject, "you have always been like a sister to me; I am going to speak frankly to you. Will you keep my secret, and answer my question truly and faithfully?"</p>
               <p>"If I can, Gerard," she replied; "but you must let me hear it first."</p>
               <p>"At least you will keep the confidence sacred," he said.</p>
               <p>"I will; so much I may promise," replied Norah; "but you are most alarmingly mysterious, Gerard," she added, with an effort at playfulness.</p>
               <p>"I am perplexed—bewildered, Norah, and I am come to you for honest counsel," said Gerard. "I have been told that your sister Fanny has done me the great honor of consenting to your father's desire that she should one day be my wife. Norah, I love her, as I love you, as a dear sister. I am touched—gratified by her preference; I would do my best to return it; but I do not feel for her as I ought to do for a wife, or a betrothed. Nay, hear me out: I have loved like that, but it is past, it is over; I can never again have the same affection for another; but I know that I could love Fanny, though it would not be such love as the past. Tell me, do you think it would make her happy? ought I to offer it to her?—to—"</p>
               <p>Norah fully appreciated the honesty yet delicacy of the avowal thus made to her, the tact which strove to save her sister's womanly delicacy, and yet convey the truth to herself, as a fitting judge of that sister's feelings, and she said, with affectionate frankness, when he paused for lack of fitting words to express his meaning—"I know all you would say, Gerard. Do not trouble your head for a delicate and considerate way of expressing your meaning. Were it any one else, I should decidedly hesitate to encourage such a hazardous engagement for both parties; but I can trust you, whom we have known from childhood; and I believe, I hope, I am sure that you will make Fanny happy; and oh, Gerard, she loves you truly; and she is so gentle, you will not let her know she is not the first, the real choice of your heart!"</p>
               <p>"I will not, Norah," he replied; "but it may be a long time before I can claim hér, unless some most unlooked-for fortune happens to me; and remember, I tell you, though I would not venture to pain her by such a suggestion, that if she should repent her choice during the interval, I authorize you to free her from any engagement to me, though I will keep my faith to her as an honorable man. And now, dear Norah, we will not again allude to this subject; you have made my duty clear to me, and you shall never repent your confidence in my honor and tenderness towards your sister."</p>
               <p>He raised her hand to his lips, and in another moment was gone.</p>
               <p>Norah remained thoughtful and grave for some minutes after Gerard's departure. Her clear intellect, and shrewd, quick perception, divined far more truly than he dreamed of his real secret; and the girl half doubted her own wisdom in encouraging so terrible and doubtful a game to be played, when the stake was nothing less than the lifelong happiness of two human beings. But Gerard was true and noble, while Fanny was gentle, loving, and patient; they would surely live in peace and contentment, if not in the fullest happiness of married life. She could not resist the temptation of whispering to the drooping girl the strange new joy that awaited her, and she went hastily to the room she had lately left.</p>
               <p>Fanny was lying on the couch, her checks burning like fire, and her eyes restless and wild, fixed eagerly on the door. She sprang up on her pillow as Norah entered, and exclaimed eagerly; "Is he gone, Norah?—gone without a word of farewell to me—one look of kind regard to his childish playmate? It was not well; and yet, why should I wish otherwise? Better he should never guess that his absence caused me one pang;—he cannot despise, though he does not care for me."</p>
               <p>Norah knelt down by the couch and drew her sister's flushed face gently down to the pillow, and kissed her hot, parched lips.</p>
               <p>"He is not gone, Fanny, darling," she said; "at least, he is not gone away from Athy. He cannot go till he has got my sister's promise that one day she will leave her home with him, never to be separated more."</p>
               <p>A quick, questioning look, which read truly Norah's smile,—a shy grateful kiss, and then the modest girl buried her head in the cushions to hide the too great happiness that shone in her tell-tale face.</p>
               <p>A few hours later, when Mabel May came to ask respecting her health, and bid her farewell ere her early departure on the morrow, the unsuspecting, happy Fanny threw her arms round her neck, and whispered in soft, half-inaudible tones, "Oh, Mabel, I must tell you—I am so blest, so happy! He was true and faithful, though I did so doubt him; and my father will consent; and, dearest, will you not wish me joy?"</p>
               <p>Mabel May did not wince under the sudden stab which the soft, low tones unconsciously gave; but her voice was very hard and distinct, and her smile very cold which accompanied the reply.</p>
               <p>"Joy," she said; "oh, yes, I do wish you all the happiness that can attend such a union, and with so deserving and honorable a man as Mr. Gerard Carlton."</p>
               <p>In the plenitude of her soft, warm joy, Fanny did not see or feel the hard, cold touch, nor read the pain which no effort could quite banish from the large, dark eyes and white lips of Mabel May.</p>
               <p>"Thanks, darling Mabel," she said; "I know you love me, and one day you will,<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6520-00000040"/> I hope, learn to love Gerard too. If we are in England, perhaps we may often meet, and you will have a Gerard of your own before then."</p>
               <p>Mabel kissed her, by way of the easiest reply, and then walked quietly from the room.</p>
               <p>"Learn to love him," murmured Mabel, as she closed her own door. "Better if I can learn to hate him; but will that ever be? I will try; and perhaps in time I shall succeed; yes, perhaps."</p>
               <milestone n="* * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>It was about a week after the preceding events when Mrs. Carlton and Gerard quitted the abode where they had spent so many years for a long, it might be a final absence. It was with mingled feelings that the mother left a place where she had found peace, if not happiness. She was going into a world that had been ever cold and troubled in her past experience of it, and now she felt like a long-caged bird, or a long inprisoned man, in going forth from her shelter to the free, wide arena of the world. Her energies were paralysed by disuse, her knowledge of men and manners was antiquated and useless; her courage weakened, and unequal to the novelty and tumult of the busy strife of man. Still there was hope and excitement, that stimulated even her exhausted energies in the prospects of her son. And she was so wrapt up in him—the whole remains of her once gushing, ardent heart were so entirely given to that one object left to her, that there was comfort and stimulus in the idea of encountering difficulties, exertion, even slights, and coldness, and disgrace for his sake. She fancied it was some atonement for the involuntary wrong she had done to her noble boy. Was there some whisper of hope, some lingering faith in the mysterious announcement she had received from the unknown! It might be so, for the poor, faint, sick heart catches eagerly at the slightest cordial that promises life and warmth, though it may be but the fatal drink that brings disappointment and death in the draught.</p>
               <p>The change was one of unmixed relief for Gerard. Athy had none but associations of annoyance and disgrace, and bitter disappointment of cherished hopes, and galling chains which he tried in vain to fancy silken fetters. He would willingly have believed that he was leaving it for ever, and that long before the time should arrive when he could offer Fanny Adams a home suitable for her, she would forget him, or be induced to give her hand to some one who would have both more money and more love to bestow in return. At any rate, there was a reprieve from constant constraint, and all the chances of time, and the changes and reverses it brings in its progress; and at the age of twenty-one the escape from present to prospective evils is so wonderfully like an exemption from both that the spirits rise like quicksilver on the removal of a heavy cloud.</p>
               <p>In these differing moods did the mother and son set off on their journey, in a post-chaise Dublin was to be their first resting-place, from which city they intended to take the sea route to England; and Gerard, familiar with both the route and the Irish <choice>
                     <sic>metroplis</sic>
                     <corr>metropolis</corr>
                  </choice>, naturally considered the first part of the journey as a comparatively uninteresting and uneventful one. But a strange, and to him mysterious, incident varied the quiet routine of their day's journey.</p>
               <p>As they drove into Naas, where they were to change horses, the chaise was impeded by an unusual concourse of people, and on inquiring the cause of the unwonted commotion, they were informed that an execution was about to take place, and that they must wait a short time before they could get to the inn, which happened to be very near the spot where the gloomy ceremony would take place.</p>
               <p>"Can we not go round?" asked Gerard. "We don't want to see the poor wretch hung, nor be delayed in our journey."</p>
               <p>But the postboy having a more sensational taste than his employers, and moreover, not admiring even an additional half-mile for his tired animals, chose to be conveniently deaf, and before Gerard could repeat his orders, or jump out of the chaise to enforce them—as he probably might, with the aid of the refractory postillion's own peculiar weapon—the loud shouts and groans and exclamations of the mob called his attention irresistibly to the passing scene. The wretched criminal had just mounted the scaffold, and the priest, about to administer the last sacrament of the Church, was raising high the cross before his pallid face, when a loud, piercing scream sounded close to Gerard's ears, and attracted even the absorbed attention of the bystanders.</p>
               <p>It was Mrs. Carlton who had uttered that horror-struck shriek, and as Gerard turned in quick and terrified amazement, she was frantically opening the door next to her, and ere he could stop her she had jumped from the carriage, and was struggling to force a passage through the crowd.</p>
               <p>"Mother! dearest mother! what is it? You are dreaming—you forget where we are—it is some fearful mistake," said Gerard, rapidly seizing her struggling figure in his arms, and bending down to avoid the listening gapers round.</p>
               <p>"Oh no!" she cried, "you cannot tell. For Heaven's sake do not stop me, Gerard. Help, help me! for I must see—I must speak to that wretched man! Oh mercy! they are binding him. Stop—stop—or it will be too late! Stop—stop!" she screamed frantically, as the executioner laid hold of his victim. "Gerard, Gerard! call—run—oh, save him! save him! I must—I must speak one word—only one word."</p>
               <p>Aided by her son—who, beginning to suspect really that there was "method in his mother's apparent madness," anxiously forced a passage for her through the dense throng—the fragile woman actually managed to reach within two or three yards of the scaffold, when the drop fell, and the wretched criminal was launched into eternity, carrying with him all secrets, or all power to help, or to inquire, into the silence and solitude of the grave.</p>
               <p>A deep, low groan, and a murmured "Too late! too late!" escaped her pale, parched lips, and then the exhausted Agatha Carlton fell senseless into the arms of her son.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
               <p>WHEN the great sensation of the awful moment was over—a fellow-creature launched into eternity—a dozen arms were extended towards Mrs. Carlton; a dozen voices offered help and advice, and the sufferer was carried to the nearest inn, where, consigned to the care of the kind-hearted landlady, she was soon recalled to consciousness, though it was long before her mind rallied from the shock it had received. Gerard watched by her couch with quiet, tender patience, till the poor, stricken, trembling frame gradually recovered life and energy under his soothing, judicious care. At last the shivering fit passed away, and the patient sank into a refreshing sleep, one hand still clasped in her son's, and her face turned lovingly towards him, as if the sense of his presence gave security and calmness.</p>
               <p>Then Gerard began to feel a shuddering dread come over his mind; the scene had been so strange, so unaccountable, except on one supposition too dreadful to entertain. While his eyes rested on his mother's sweet white face, he wondered whether it could be possible that so refined, so pure a being, could be connected with a criminal unfit to live; and as he looked on her features, which moved slightly from time to time in her troubled sleep, a resemblance, never before remarked, struck him. It was to some one whom he could not recall, and yet who brought unpleasant associations to his mind. He looked again and again, and then the person came to his mind, it was Ronald, the young brigand of the Rath. The idea was too absurd, too wild, and yet it was there;—the finely-cut features, the delicately-moulded chin, the expression of the mouth, all was softened into feminine beauty, and yet unmistakeably like the handsome son of the robber Bryant.</p>
               <p>The association with the scene just witnessed was strange and haunting, but in spite of his attempts to persuade himself that it must be the effect of that very circumstance on his nerves which made him thus superstitious and fanciful, every moment strengthened the belief, and Gerard moved from the couch to escape the wretched suspicions which crowded on his mind. The movement possibly aroused the sleeper, for she moved, started up, looked anxiously round for her son, and called him in a voice far more composed and natural than he could have hoped.</p>
               <p>"Come here, dear boy," she said, gently. "You must be astonished at what has just passed, and, it may be, suspect your mother of unfounded and degrading crimes."</p>
               <p>"No, no, dearest mother," said Gerard, hurriedly, anxious perhaps to conceal the perplexing thoughts that had but now occupied him, "I could not presume to doubt you: only, if I might dare to ask—"</p>
               <p>"Ask what, my son?—who and what that unhappy man was?" said his mother, gazing full at him.</p>
               <p>His face flushed, and he said tremulously, "Only tell me—is—is he—?"</p>
               <p>"Your father, you would say," interrupted Mrs. Carlton; "no, no, my poor boy; neither I nor you are so degraded as that; no, he still lives, as I believe—in fact, I know. That wretched man was one who could have satisfied me on one point it deeply concerned me to know, but his secret is now buried for ever in the grave. Do not ask more, I entreat you. One day you shall know all; but, till then, my lips are sealed, and it only tortures me to see your too natural anxiety, which yet I cannot, must not satisfy."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, darling mother," said Gerard, stooping down and kissing her pale face; "I will not pain you again; I will trust and wait; only remember that your son has the strong will and the self-control which may be necessary to aid you in time of trial and perplexity. If I have not experience or wisdom, you shall at least find me calm and reasonable, even under the most galling provocations. You shall not repent your confidence if you will try me."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton's tears flowed fast, but gently and sweetly. She threw her arms round her son's neck, and warmly returned his embrace.</p>
               <p>"I must not murmur while I have such a son to comfort me," she said. "Dear boy, I would give far more than the remainder of my life for your happiness, and I pray Heaven to direct me to act wisely for its attainment. But a little time, perhaps a very little time, will decide me as to the possibility of such exertion; and then, Gerard, I will test you as you wish."</p>
               <p>Gerard said no more, but laying his mother's weary head gently down on the pillow, he left her to a few hours' repose before continuing their journey.</p>
               <p>It was a brilliant October day when they arrived in London, and the great city wore as bright and attractive an aspect as a busy, thronged metropolis can do, to those who have been accustomed to the glorious free air and sunshine, and fields, and woods, and hills, and water, and all the varied splendor<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6520-00000041"/> and winning charms of creation. Still, though Gerard had a keen relish for country sports, and an artist's eye for Nature's beauty, he was very sensible of the pleasure and excitement which the novelty of the scene, and the prospects opening before him, naturally produced. It made him forget, or rather deadened, the remembrance of his bitter disappointment, and he ardently longed for some employment, some fresh interest in life, to complete, as he fancied, the cure of the wound.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton <unclear>had</unclear> taken temporary lodgings in Westminster,—not the most attractive locality it will be confessed, but one that suited her purse, and was yet within reach of the persons with whom her business had to be arranged. More than once she had been absent for a morning without giving Gerard any clue to her movements; and the questioning look, which he could not altogether restrain, was unnoticed, or disregarded by her. At last these mysterious expeditions ceased, and with them the glimpses of cheerfulness which had enlivened Mrs. Carlton's gentle melancholy disappeared, and Gerard guessed, with a pang, that the hopes which had brought the gleam of sunshine to his mother's darkened life were gone.</p>
               <p>It was the evening of the last of Mrs. Carlton's unexplained absences from home, and the mother and son were sitting in the dusk of the early November twilight, the flickering flame of the fire throwing an uncertain light on the still faces which were gazing absently and yet earnestly on the fanciful forms assumed by the red coals, and the ticking of the heavy clock alone breaking the silence.</p>
               <p>"Gerard," said Mrs. Carlton, and her voice made her son start—it was so sudden, and yet so low and constrained.</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear mother, I am all attention," he said, with an effort at playfulness.</p>
               <p>"I have delayed, perhaps foolishly, Gerard; but I was anxious to be quite certain, before I took any step in your behalf."</p>
               <p>"And you are satisfied now, mother?"</p>
               <p>"Satisfied!" she repeated mournfully; "well, yes, satisfied that any further delay is worse than useless, and that you ought to trust only to your own exertions to win an honorable name and a position in life. Listen, my dear boy, to the little I dare tell you. The name which I have assumed, almost from the date of your birth, is not mine, nor yet your father's. It will give no clue to your history; no shame rests upon it; and it may be that no living person could trace me or mine from such a clue. The unhappy wretch whom we saw die at Naas, knew all, and could have given me information that might have affected your whole future life; but, besides himself, there was but one person in whom I confided; and she, I believe, has long since been dead. But, as soon as you are once placed in an honorable career, Gerard, I shall go to the spot which saw my greatest happiness and greatest misery; and if the faintest clue can be obtained which can explain the mystery that still hangs over that part of my life, it will not escape the keen vigilance of an outraged wife and anxious mother. And now, having told you so much of my plans, we will speak only of yours. Here is a letter, which you must at once deliver, and which will I hope secure you a friend and patron."</p>
               <p>Gerard took it; it was directed to the Earl of Hargrave, Grosvenor Street. He gave a quick, questioning look at his mother, and said, "Do you know him, mother?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton's color deepened, as she replied, "I understand you, Gerard, but you are wrong in your suspicions. I never saw Lord Hargrave in my life; but the introduction which the letter contains, will, I believe, be sufficient to interest him in your favor. He is rich, noble, has interest with Government, and is without wife or child to claim his attention. His only near relative and supposed heir is a nephew, to whom he will perhaps introduce you. I need scarcely advise you to meet cordially any advances that he may make to you; it is my wish that you should gain his regard and friendship; and I have no doubt of your pleasing, where you wish to do so."</p>
               <p>Gerard's mind was busily at work during the waking hours of that night. It was not only the coming interview and its probable effect on his fortunes, but it was the manner in which his mother had laid down the course he was to pursue that puzzled him. That there was some yet deeper reason than mere expediency for the anxiety she had expressed for his courting the good-will of both uncle and nephew, he was perfectly convinced; and yet the unhesitating assurance that the earl was a stranger to her, destroyed every lingering suspicion as to the one idea which was ever present to his thoughts. Still, what else could account for such uncalled-for earnestness? Time might perhaps explain this as also the other mysteries that surrounded him.</p>
               <p>"My lord is at home, and disengaged," was the reply to Gerard's question, when, with a beating heart, he presented himself in Grosvenor Street on the following morning. Gerard sent in his name, also the letter which was to obtain him an interview, and in a few minutes he was ushered into the handsome library, where the earl was sitting.</p>
               <p>Lord Hargrave was a fine-looking man, of about fifty years of age. He was still handsome, though long residence in a tropical climate had bronzed his once fair skin, and printed marks of suffering and ill-health on his noble-looking face. There was an expression of sadness in his countenance, which might perhaps be accounted for by the same cause, and a calm, dignified, measured style in his manner and bearing, which betokened long and stern control over both himself and others. Indeed, he had been long in command of the district of Goojerat and, as Gerard afterwards learned, was distinguished by stern and impartial justice and a grave and unbroken reserve towards friends and acquaintances, which some attributed to natural pride and austerity of temper, while others whispered that he had experienced severe and crushing sorrow in his youth, which had changed his entire character and influenced his whole future life. His present title and estates had come to him collaterally, through the failure of male issue in the direct line. He gave a quick, searching, but not ungracious glance at the young man as he entered the room—a glance which Gerard caught more than once repeated, when his host thought himself unobserved, during their interview, and which almost appeared more piercing and anxious than such an occasion could seem to warrant. But the manner and tone in which the earl at once entered on the subject betrayed no unusual interest in him.</p>
               <p>"It appears from this letter that your mother wishes you to obtain some situation under Government," said the earl, after the first salutation. "I cannot of course promise anything; but what interest I have shall be exerted for you. Where have you been educated—at one of our universities?"</p>
               <p>"I finished my studies in Dublin," replied Gerard; "but much of my early education was conducted by a worthy clergyman at Athy."</p>
               <p>"In Ireland! Then you are not English born?" said the earl, abruptly.</p>
               <p>"I have lived all my life in Ireland," replied Gerard; "but I believe I was not born at Athy."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, it matters not," said the earl; "I dare say it will not affect your interests in the service. But I am glad to hear you have had some university experience, though not exactly of the first character. It gives a man standing; and the men you will be thrown amongst are quick to find out all those things. However, my nephew, Captain Grenville, will enlighten you better than I can as to all these matters, and I shall put you under his guidance a little during your probation. Dine with me to-morrow at six, and I will introduce you to him."</p>
               <p>Gerard gladly accepted the invitation, and then Lord Hargrave handed him a newspaper.</p>
               <p>"Amuse yourself with that a little," said he, "while I write a line to your good mother."</p>
               <p>Gerard took the paper, and did his best to appear engrossed with it; but, with every possible good faith and good breeding, he could not manage to prevent his eyes wandering to the table where the carl was writing, and more than once he observed the keen eyes bent on his face, and then, when the looks thus accidentally encountered each other, both turned away, like persons detected in a fault. At last the note was finished, and Gerard rose to go.</p>
               <p>"You are very young, I should think," said the earl, still holding the note in his hand.</p>
               <p>"Twenty-one," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"Ha! I should have thought even less than that," said the earl. "You are doubtless like your mother, and that makes you look more youthful."</p>
               <p>"No," replied Gerard, and his look met the carl full and steady as he spoke. "My mother is a brunette. I do not think there is any resemblance between us."</p>
               <p>Again the questioning look, the wistful examination of his features, and then the earl handed him the note.</p>
               <p>"Remember," said he, "to-morrow at six," as he politely dismissed the young man from the room.</p>
               <p>Gerard keenly watched the effect that the report of his interview, and the letter he brought, would have on his mother, but there was a calmness, almost amounting to indifference, in the manner with which she received both.</p>
               <p>"It is well, so far," she said; "by all means keep your engagement; but do not build your hopes too firmly on the earl's promise. However, he means kindly no doubt, and his nephew's friendship will be useful to you; for I am told he has great influence with his uncle."</p>
               <p>Gerard was perhaps more nervous at the prospect of encountering the fashionable young man about town, which he presumed he should find in Captain Grenville, than he had been at the interview with the dignified uncle. And yet he was strangely eager for another meeting with Lord Hargrave, and curious to see whether the same close examination of himself would be carried on when a third person was present. There was something that caught his youthful imagination in the proud, dignified, grave bearing of the distinguished-looking nobleman, and the interest he felt in this second visit was rather the result of some indefinable attraction, than mere hope of patronage and advancement. But if he anticipated any especial gratification of his romantic fancies, it was to be disappointed. All peculiarity of expression had vanished from the earl's countenance and manner as he received his guest with somewhat stately courtesy, and presented him to his nephew, Captain Grenville, who glanced at the new comer with well-disguised but yet visible superciliousness.</p>
               <p>"Happy to make your acquaintance, Mr. Carlton," said Grenville. "Think I've not had the pleasure of meeting you anywhere before. How long have you been in town?"</p>
               <p>Gerard's pride rose, and he replied, with a careless ease that somewhat surprised the fastidious young officer, "I have only been here a month, and that time has been more occupied with business than gaiety, which will<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6520-00000042"/> fully account for my not having been so fortunate as to fall in with you."</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha!" said Grenville, "very good—quite severe—eh, uncle? I see you're not to be trifled with; but really, I'm delighted to hear it—you'll be so charmingly fresh—quite a griffin, as you say in India, my lord."</p>
               <p>"I wish I could say the same of you, Fred," said the earl; it would have saved my pocket not a little."</p>
               <p>Dinner was now announced, and during the discussion of the excellent dishes, which did credit to the earl's cook, young Grenville rattled away displaying a thorough knowledge of the gastronomical art in general, and the viands before them in particular, while Gerard did his best to keep up with his brilliant new acquaintance, and the earl, though speaking little, evidently took note of the degree of talent and habits of thought which his young guest displayed.</p>
               <p>When the wine had gone round two or three times after the cloth was removed, the earl excused himself to the young men on the plea of writing letters, and left them alone.</p>
               <p>"Come, draw your chair near the fire, Carlton," said Grenville, pushing back the large table, and placing the decanters and walnuts on a small sofa-table, which he wheeled towards them. "We must be friends; and, as I am heir to my excellent grand duke of an uncle, I am bound to second him in all his fancies, and like whom he likes, and patronise whom he patronises. There, don't flush up so terribly, I meant nothing derogatory to your honorable self, but as I see my uncle has taken an extraordinary liking to you, and will exert all his interest for your more substantial benefit, it behoves his dutiful nephew to follow suit, and give you the benefit of his more valuable experience in the more important matters of society, manners, amusements,—eh, Carlton?"</p>
               <p>"I am very grateful for such invaluable assistance," said Gerard; "but I am afraid you are unpardonably rash. You don't know what a tyro you are taking under your wing. I shall only disgrace you with my rustic ignorance."</p>
               <p>"Disgrace me!" repeated the young man, haughtily. "I flatter myself that is impossible with Fred Grenville; and indeed," he added, recollecting himself, "the only thing I should have to fear in your case would be a rival. But I'll be generous, and introduce you to some of the prettiest women in London. By the way, have you been to any of the theatres yet?"</p>
               <p>"To none," replied Gerard.</p>
               <p>"All the better," said Grenville; "I shall have the gratifying novelty of seeing your first impressions and astonishment; I have not met with any one so delightfully fresh, and yet so perfectly <foreign xml:lang="FRA">comme il faut</foreign>, since I came out myself."</p>
               <p>"But I really have some glimmering of what the stage is," said Carlton, laughing. "Dublin is not quite out of the pale of civilised life, remember; though, of course, not up to London notions of refinement."</p>
               <p>A shade crossed Grenville's handsome face.</p>
               <p>"Dublin, ah, of course; yes, I know," said he; "that is, a very handsome girl, a flame of mine, was staying there a short time since, and I used to hear of its delicious absurdities from her; but we won't do battle for our respective capitals. Will you go to the Opera to-morrow night? and I'll persuade my lovely cousin Adeline Rivers to be there. She is worth seeing, I promise you; but you won't have a chance of meeting her here, for my uncle is a regular abbot about admitting women to his house—hates them as he does the Evil One. Some early disappointment, I suspect, soured his temper; all the better for me—but you will come?"</p>
               <p>"Of course, with pleasure," replied Gerard.</p>
               <p>"But if I introduce you, Carlton, you must be on honor, you know,—no poaching,—you understand."</p>
               <p>"If you have pre-engaged the lady, I should have poor chance," said Gerard, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Hum! don't know," said Grenville; "women are capricious as thorough-bred ponies; but Adeline and I understand each other, and she will be gracious to any friend of mine, so I leave you to take care of yourself, and fall in love at your peril."</p>
               <p>"There is no danger," said Gerard, with a scornful smile; "Miss Rivers is no doubt very beautiful, as so good a judge as yourself pronounces her so; but she is not the first lovely girl I have seen; and I am not quite so inflammable as you make out."</p>
               <p>"Hardened by fire, eh, Carlton?—heart reduced to ashes; well, we shall see if Adeline does not rekindle them. There are half the young fellows in London mad after her, I can tell you."</p>
               <p>The entrance of a servant with a summons to coffee interrupted the half scornful reply on Gerard's lips, and the remainder of the evening the subject was tabooed by the presence of Lord Hargrave.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
               <p>WHEN Fred Grenville and Gerard arrived at the theatre, on the following evening, the performance had commenced.</p>
               <p>"Now, my dear fellow," said Grenville. "as I have undertaken the superintendence of your <foreign xml:lang="FRA">début</foreign> in fashionable life, I must give you a hint, that it is quite a rustic <foreign xml:lang="FRA">gaucherie</foreign> to appear occupied by the stage unless there is a new singer, or some extraordinary new attraction. However, as I am a most judicious tutor, I shall leave you for a short time to take in all the novelties of the place unobserved, so as to enable you to take the proper style hereafter. I have so many friends that it is quite a nuisance even to recognise them all, but I shan't forget you when my aunt and Adeline arrive."</p>
               <p>Grenville nodded an adieu, and in a moment had disappeared.</p>
               <p>Gerard was by no means so complete a novice as his friend affected to fancy, and yet the brilliancy of the audience, the size of the house, the excellence of the singing, and the general splendor of the effect did certainly somewhat dazzle and engross his attention for a while. But the first bewildering novelty over, he had leisure to examine more particularly the brilliant crowd, and to scan the peculiarities and attractions of the fair occupants <choice>
                     <sic>of of</sic>
                     <corr>of</corr>
                  </choice> stalls and boxes. There were many very handsome women present, but Gerard's eyes were especially attracted by one box, where sat a young girl, lovely enough to have riveted the gaze of far more <choice>
                     <sic>blazé</sic>
                     <corr>blasé</corr>
                  </choice> admirers of female charms. She was evidently tall, though the real beauty of her figure could not of course be displayed as she sat half-enveloped in a rich white cloak, that left one shoulder exposed, either from carelessness or coquetry. Her features were classically regular, and the expression of the face rather proud than gentle; but it suited well the splendid contour of face and head, and the stately grace of the queenly throat. The skin was fair, the hair a pale brown, and the large eyes were deep hazel, singularly soft and thoughtful, even pensive in their natural expression. But as Gerard's fascinated gaze lingered on her face, he could see them sparkle with sudden and arch merriment, when any remarks of her companions in the box excited her amusement.</p>
               <p>Gerard was thinking that he had never seen so beautiful a woman, and trying to persuade himself that Mabel May's softer and more girlish loveliness would not bear a comparison with such queenly perfection, when the box door where she sat opened, and Grenville entered. Gerard guessed at once from the careless ease and cordiality of his greeting, and the half-indifferent familiarity with which he was received, both by the young girl and a stylish-looking, but rather over-dressed woman, whom he presumed to be her mother, that the two ladies were the aunt and cousin of whom Grenville had spoken. Gerard felt a strange annoyance, which he would have been ashamed to confess even to himself. He saw Grenville drop carelessly into a seat close behind Adeline, brushing her very sleeve as he leaned forward to speak to her, and carelessly playing with the tassels of her cloak; while the deepened color on her cheek, and the soft expression of her eyes, as she conversed with him, seemed to indicate that the subject of which they spoke was not quite indifferent to her.</p>
               <p>Adeline looked more beautiful than ever, as her upturned face displayed to yet more advantage her graceful throat, her perfectly-formed head, and her faultless profile. But Gerard did <emph>not</emph> see, what was nevertheless the case, that those lovely eyes were more than once bent for a moment on himself, nor did he guess that Grenville was commenting to its fair object, on his evident admiration. At length, when the first act closed, he perceived Grenville saying a few words to the elder lady, and then quit the box. The next moment he was at his side.</p>
               <p>"Well, Carlton, my boy," said he, "so you've picked her out already; you've a true eye for beauty, I see, and you'll find her as charming as she is handsome. There, come along, I've my aunt's permission to introduce you."</p>
               <p>Gerard needed no second invitation, and in a few moments he was in the box, listening to the courteous platitudes of the mother, and actually seated behind the fair object of his admiration. Adeline Rivers was even more lovely on a nearer examination than she had appeared from a distance; and Gerard thought, as he looked, that he had never before known what beauty really was.</p>
               <p>"I will leave you now that my place is so well supplied," said Grenville, carelessly. "I see one or two friends whom I want to speak to, but I will return before the opera is over. Gerard, mind you are as amusing as possible in my absence, that my fair cousin may not pine in the interval."</p>
               <p>"Intolerable conceit!" said Adeline, in a soft silver voice, that added to her fascination. "I never yet regretted being left in peace, especially when that charming actress is on the stage. Fred is such a wild rattle that he cannot understand the blessing of quiet."</p>
               <p>"Am I to understand that as a command for silence, Miss Rivers?" said Gerard, smiling. "I have heard that it is sometimes more eloquent than words, and in this case I can quite comprehend it. It is quite sufficient to be permitted to approach perfection, and enjoy the sunshine it sheds around."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I neither exact nor admire such very dull homage, Mr. Carlton," said Adeline, with a light musical laugh; "but I hate to be obliged to do anything, even to be amused. Fred always expects his wit to be admired and laughed at, but I cannot be troubled when I'm not in the humor. I'm a sad spoiled child, I am afraid."</p>
               <p>"That is an impossibility, Miss Rivers," said Gerard, in a low voice; "but I quite agree with you, that it is a terrible nuisance to be either amused or amusing by compulsion, or profession."</p>
               <p>Adeline rewarded Gerard with a smile, and, inspired by her evident graciousness, he displayed powers of which he was unconscious<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6520-00000043"/> scious, and talked with a brilliancy, and yet natural and unforced case and quietness that amused without fatiguing or exacting a return. The spoiled and capricious beauty was fairly captivated for the hour, and Gerard could, if he chose, believe himself the cause of the utter ignorance she betrayed of what was going on upon the stage when appealed to by her mother, and the look of involuntary disappointment on the return of Grenville towards the close of the performances.</p>
               <p>"Well, Gerard, my boy, you've made a capital substitute," said Grenville. "I didn't lose sight of you, though I was so fairly entrapped by Lady Rose Temple and her mother that I couldn't get away before. Aunt, your carriage is called—I saw to that; so we had better not delay. Carlton, take care of my cousin."</p>
               <p>With a praiseworthy self-denial, at which Gerard inwardly marvelled, the young officer gave his arm to Mrs. Rivers, leaving his new friend to follow with the beautiful Adeline.</p>
               <p>Gerard saw many glances of curiosity, and, as he doubted not, envy cast on him as they passed through the crowded waiting-room, and along the corridor to the door where the carriage was waiting. And as they passed a little group of young men, who were standing a little aside, critically surveying the rapidly succeeding throng, he caught the words, "Do you see, Vane? there's another added to the list; I wonder how many more will walk into the net."</p>
               <p>The answer was unheard, for at that very moment Adeline happened to turn her eyes in that direction, and, to Gerard's surprise, received and returned a half-familiar, half-deferential bow and smile from the individual who had thus spoken.</p>
               <p>"Who is that gentleman?" he asked quickly.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no one—that is, no one of the slightest note: a Mr. Travers," she replied; "I detest him, and he knows it, yet he always chooses to assume that odiously impertinent manner when we meet, just what irritates, and yet which cannot be openly resented."</p>
               <p>The explanation was too natural to be doubted, and the momentary shade of suspicion that had crossed the young man's mind immediately vanished.</p>
               <p>"You and your friend will come home to supper with us, Fred," said Mrs. Rivers. "We have room, and I dare say your cab is not waiting."</p>
               <p>Grenville affected to make some difficulty in accepting the invitation, but a look from Adeline decided the matter. It was impossible to resist the invitation of those soft eyes; so the young men jumped in, and the carriage drove rapidly off to Hanover Square.</p>
               <p>A <foreign xml:lang="FRA">petit souper</foreign> after the play is always a sparkling entertainment, unless under most peculiarly adverse circumstances. The gaiety of the scenes that have just been quitted; the pleasant stimulus which the slight exhaustion of mind and body gives to the appetite; the very elegance of toilet consequent on the occasion, joined with the unconscious case of the impromptu entertainment are a happy combination of attractions rarely to be found in more formal reunions. And when to these are added the charms of novelty and the eager excitement of a sudden if transient passion, it may be imagined that Gerard Carlton became fairly carried away with the enchantment of the hour and the scene.</p>
               <p>The supper was small, but exquisite in quality and cookery. Mrs. Rivers was gracious and urbane; Adeline, sparkling and lovely; Grenville, rattingly amusing; and Gerard himself, infected by the animation of the scene, and possessing for his companions the rare charm of freshness and novelty, was by no means the least gay or least valuable member of the party.</p>
               <p>The little clock on the chimney-piece struck two before the guests could persuade themselves to say farewell to their fair hostesses, and then it was with lingering last words, and yet more lingering looks, that Gerard prepared to depart.</p>
               <p>"I may have the pleasure of asking after your health to-morrow, may I not, Mrs. Rivers?" said Gerard; "I fear we have sadly worn out your patience and your strength to-night."</p>
               <p>"By no means," said the lady, in her sweetest tones; "you must dine with us next week and hear Adeline sing, as you like music so much."</p>
               <p>Gerard warmly expressed his thanks, and left the room in a sort of confused yet delicious dream, which he cared not to analyse nor to awake from.</p>
               <p>"You're a pretty fellow, Master Carlton," said Grenville, laughing, as soon as they gained the street; "you go a-head with a vengeance. Why, half the men in London would give their little fingers for one of the smiles my capricious cousin has lavished on you. You have made more progress in three or four hours than any one else has done in weeks or months."</p>
               <p>"Thanks to your introduction, I presume," returned Gerard; "I am not coxcomb enough to misinterpret Miss Rivers's kind indulgence to a rustic like myself."</p>
               <p>"A pretty knowing one, any way," said Grenville. "It's to be hoped there is no fair daughter of Erin weeping out her dark grey eyes for your absence, or she may chance to waste her tears on an inconstant knight. But here our way parts, and I must caution you to say nothing to my uncle of my introducing you to the Riverses. There is an old coolness, some pique, I fancy, between him and my aunt, and it would probably damage you and me too, if he thought you had become acquainted with them."</p>
               <p>Gerard promised compliance, and bidding Grenville farewell, hastened home, when, to his great relief, he found his mother had gone to bed, and only a servant sitting up for him. Once quietly in his room, he began to think more coolly than he had yet had leisure or inclination to do, and his better judgment warned him to avoid the too fascinating Adeline. His recent engagement to Fanny Adams, the real, deep love he had so long cherished for Mabel May, seemed to reproach him for indulging in his late brief fever of admiration for another. And now that he was exposed no longer to those fascinating eyes, nor heard the sweet tones of that musical voice, he began to reflect on the rather too facile readiness with which Adeline Rivers had received and encouraged his attention. Mabel May would have repulsed them with quiet dignity, Fanny Adams with shrinking modesty, had they met such open admiration from a stranger; and Adeline,—surely her greater self-confidence and knowledge of the world should have taught her yet greater caution and reserve. But then came the palliating reflection that London manners might be different from the more untutored and inexperienced ideas of country life, and that a girl accustomed to adulation like Adeline Rivers might probably attach no serious importance to the attentions of an insignificant tyro like himself. Still, he would be cautious, very cautious; and when he called again on the Riverses, as he must of course keep his promise, he would observe more narrowly, and avoid committing himself in the slightest degree. And with this wise resolve Gerard slept.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
               <p>IT was the week after the departure of the Carltons, a gloomy November evening, when Bryant and his son Ronald were seated over a blazing fire, in the same room which had been the scene of Gerard's narrowly escaped murder, and subsequent arrest. They were smoking, the father a short, Irish pipe, and the son a cigar, and on a rude table before them was whisky and its appurtenances. But they had apparently drunk but little as yet, to judge from the state of the bottle, and the faces of both were grave and cool, like men more occupied with their own thoughts and the business before them, than any present indulgence in potations which might confuse and ruin both. They had been silent for a few minutes, and then Ronald was the first to speak.</p>
               <p>"I am no boy to be guided blindfold," he said, as if replying to some remark previously made by his worthy parent. "Prove to me that it is your and my interest to keep this young fellow from coming to grief, as he is in the high road to do, and I will act on your advice. But as there happens to be a powerful reason to the contrary line of conduct, I shall certainly adopt it, unless you see fit to trust me."</p>
               <p>"Is it really come to this," said Bryant, "that my own son, who is scarcely arrived at years of maturity, dares to brave me? Well, it is time we understood each other, Ronald; and if we are not to be friends, let us avow it openly, and act on the knowledge. But, mark me, boy! I will never be defied nor deceived with impunity; and the slightest attempt on your part, at either, will be most surely detected and punished."</p>
               <p>"I am too old for empty threats and meaningless insinuations," returned Ronald. "I tell you, I have no wish to quarrel with you; but I demand to share your confidence, if I am to carry out your plans. To-morrow I shall be miles distant from here; in less than a week I shall be in London; and I don't think you would find it quite so easy to put a bit of lead in me there, as in our good friends about here. That was a capital aim of yours that night, eh, my worthy father?"</p>
               <p>Bryant turned rather pale, and Ronald went on.</p>
               <p>"Now, I'm very liberal in my ideas," said he, "and don't stick at trifles; but I hardly believe you bad enough to murder, or bring to trouble, which is the same thing, your own flesh and blood. The very brutes wont commit such an unnatural monstrosity."</p>
               <p>"And suppose you are not my own flesh and blood, Ronald, what then?" said Bryant, fiercely. "Don't be too sure of that; there's many a son does not know his own father, and you may not be wiser than other people, clever as you think yourself."</p>
               <p>"You either take me for a fool, or you are a villain," exclaimed Ronald, starting up, and grasping the small dagger he always carried under his cloak. "Speak out, or you shall find I've taken you at your word, and shan't scruple to act on your hint. What do you mean by these confounded old woman's sayings? The truth, man, the truth, or I'll have the black, false blood out of your very heart; speak, I tell you!"</p>
               <p>Ronald's movement had been so sudden, that it took Bryant by surprise; but when the youth paused for a moment to see the effect of his threat, and to gain, if possible, the information he wanted, ere silencing the tongue that could give it forever, the brigand freed the hand, which Ronald held like a vice, with one quick movement of his powerful arm, and snatching the weapon that in an instant would have been in his heart, threw it to the other end of the room.</p>
               <p>"Foolish lad!" he said, with a scornful laugh, "you only make me more reluctant to trust an ungoverned boy, who has neither patience nor temper even with his best friend. But come, I was once young myself, and<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6520-00000044"/> perhaps I have tried your hot blood rather too severely, considering your bringing up. Sit down again, and I'll tell you what I think fit now; and if you are wise, and act on my directions, you shall know all at the right time. Are you content to act like a rational being, and to trust the only man who really wishes you well, or cares a straw whether you are hung to-morrow or not?"</p>
               <p>There was a strange look of rough kindliness in the brigand's strong features that Ronald's quick eye had never seen there before, and which influenced him more than the deadliest threats or the fiercest rage could have done.</p>
               <p>"I'm ready to hear reason," he replied, half sullenly; "and you ought to know by this time that I'm neither a fool nor a coward. I'd bide my time for years, or endure any restraint that is necessary, however galling, if you only show me the reason why I should throw away a good offer, and sacrifice a friend. Does that please you?"</p>
               <p>"Well, it's more common sense than I've heard you talk yet," said <choice>
                     <sic>Byrant</sic>
                     <corr>Bryant</corr>
                  </choice>. "If you give me your word not to blab till I give the signal, why then I'll let you into a little of my secrets."</p>
               <p>Ronald held out his hand—Bryant grasped it firmly, while the young man repeated the promise he had exacted, adding, "on pain of the usual penalties of our fraternity" at its close; and then Bryant, pouring out some more whisky into his glass, and pushing the bottle towards Ronald, began.</p>
               <p>"I told you, boy," said he, "that you needn't reckon on being safe on the supposition that you are my own flesh and blood; and that James Bryant doesn't fire without knowing his mark, you needn't be told by this time. It's the truth; you are no more my son than you are my father, though I've got to like you as well as if you were, and I will stand by you just the same, and push your fortune, if you'll be guided by me."</p>
               <p>Ronald's blood rushed eagerly into his dark face.</p>
               <p>"Whose son am I, then?" he said, in a voice of forced calmness.</p>
               <p>"That's a part of the story that I can't now explain, for your own sake, because matters are not ripe yet," replied Bryant. "But I'll tell you thus much, that I've found out that your father's got a pretty sight of money, and, if well managed, we shall bring him on his knees before many months are over and, make you a match for the girl I've picked out for you. What do you say to that, my boy?"</p>
               <p>"Then I'm a natural son, am I?" asked Ronald in the same constrained tone.</p>
               <p>"That remains to be seen," said Bryant. "I got hold of a bit of strange news the other day that makes it doubtful, so I am waiting to find out the real truth, before I bring matters to a crisis. Any way, I have a hold on your father that he can't shake off, and will tighten it still harder before we've done with him. Now, hark ye, boy! you're not called Gentleman Ronald for nothing,—that has come to you by nature; but your training has made a man of you, instead of a craven fool like most of the gentlefolk. You'll know how to enjoy life, eh, lad? and as I'm almost tired of this calling, especially as times are getting worse in our line, why, I've thought we can quit it together, d'ye see?"</p>
               <p>Ronald's lip curled slightly, but he only nodded assent.</p>
               <p>"There's old Adams," continued Bryant; "he's got a snug fortune to give his girls, Ronald, and the youngest is as handsome and spirited a lass as any man need wish for. The old man will give her some round thousands when she's married, and you must knab both the girl and the money, and give me enough to keep me for the rest of my days, without doing more than just enough to keep my hand in."</p>
               <p>"I'd rather catch that other girl," said Ronald; "the one that showed such pluck at the trial, and she will have more money than the old fellow's daughters will have. I got that out of that fool Carey, the other day."</p>
               <p>"No, no, boy, no!" exclaimed Bryant, starting. "If you ever dare to move one step, to harbor one thought where that girl is concerned, you will rue it to the last hour of your life; ay, and wish you had never been born. Listen—"</p>
               <p>He stooped forward, and whispered a word in Ronald's ear. The young man started as if a bullet had struck him, and gazed eagerly at Bryant.</p>
               <p>"Is it true?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"True as the steel of that plaything of yours yonder," replied Bryant; "but, mind you, that's no clue to your birth, for many strange things have happened since, and you'd ruin all if you ran off on that false scent. But I told you thus much to show you that you'd better be content to carry out my schemes. Now listen to me. You go off to London; stay there a bit, till this little affair has blown over; watch over young Carlton, as you value your future ease and prosperity, for much of it depends on his safety. He is the chief tool with which I shall work for both you and myself; but if he comes to grief, my power is gone. His fate and yours are as closely woven together as the web of that cloth, and his death would be the ruin of your prospects."</p>
               <p>"Do you mean that the same blood runs in our veins?" asked Ronald.</p>
               <p>"I have told you enough to guide your conduct, if you believe me," replied Bryant, sternly; "if you do not, it would avail little whether I said yes or no. But I hear steps in the distance, and I must be brief, or we shall be interrupted before I have done. When my plans are complete, I shall send for you. Come back, not as Ronald the Smuggler, but as a man of fortune and family ly. I'll manage all for you—you will never be recognised, and, before many weeks, it will be your own fault if you are not the husband of Norah Adams, with her snug fortune, and as much more added to it of your own; and then when young Carlton has got the other sister, and old Adams's money-bag is fairly at our mercy, why, then the cards will be all trumps, and the rest of the game in my own hands."</p>
               <p>Ronald had barely time to express, rather by gesture than words, his assent to the plan, ere the rest of the band entered, and after a brief colloquy the whole party retired to rest. But Ronald slept not; his thoughts were busy on what he had heard that night, and his brain worked too eagerly and feverishly for repose. He strove to comprehend more clearly the hints Bryant had given, to trace out the possible connection between himself and Carlton, and the yet stranger and more startling word which still burned in his ears.</p>
               <p>Ronald's daring spirit and natural sympathy for what was brave, and resolute, and beautiful, had found in Mabel May's noble courage and firm adherence to her promise, and singular loveliness, all that was most calculated to kindle admiration, and charm his wild roving fancy. It could scarcely be said that he had ever thought of loving, or even of again meeting one so immeasurably above him; but he had often seen her image in his dreams, and heard the clear, ringing tones of her voice, as he listened to them in that trying hour at Garron's Hill. And now, Bryant had told him that this glorious creature was, what it sent the blood in unequal currents through his heart to remember, now leaving it cold and heavy, then throbbing with wild and irregular tumult of agitation and pleasure.</p>
               <p>The young smuggler of the Rath was no untutored, impulsive being, to be entirely occupied with mere vague passion or sentiment, to the exclusion of more real and important interests. He conquered at last the wild speculations and feverish fancies which had for a time mastered his usually calm spirit, and began to weigh more calmly the plans laid down for him by Bryant, and those he had formed for his own guidance. He had given his promise to carry out the directions of his supposed father; given it in a form which was never broken by the brigands of the Rath; but he was by no means inclined to give up his own schemes and expectations so far as they could be made compatible with the conduct laid down for him by <choice>
                     <sic>Byrant</sic>
                     <corr>Bryant</corr>
                  </choice>.</p>
               <p>Weary of tossing to and fro for so many feverish hours, Ronald started up upon his low pallet and looked around him on the large, silent apartment. Bryant's couch was in a distant corner, the sole other occupant of the rude sleeping chamber. He was breathing heavily and loudly, the whisky he had drunk so freely was evidently telling on him, and his sleep was deep and unrefreshing as the slumber of opium.</p>
               <p>Ronald left his pallet and approached the sleeper, from whom some half muttered words could occasionally be distinguished, and stood silently watching the strong features and powerful form. As he bent over him, trying to make out the thick utterance, Ronald thought he could perceive the corner of a white packet just appearing in the inner pocket of the large jacket in which Bryant had carelessly thrown himself on the couch. It was by no means as common a circumstance at that period as now for persons of any class to have such a multiplicity of letters as to carry them about with them in receptacles usually devoted to far more useful articles in that day. And certainly His Majesty's revenue was little benefited by the correspondence of the robber of the Rath; as no one knew better than Ronald himself. It was therefore a matter of far greater interest and surprise for the young man to perceive that carefully hidden packet peeping forth from the large breast pocket, from which he had been accustomed to see pouches of tobacco, or of powder, or small pocket pistols, or game, or poultry, and such characteristic articles, drawn forth by the owner.</p>
               <p>For a moment the young man paused, hesitated, considered; and then with a light and cautious hand drew from its hiding place the packet which thus excited his curiosity. Again he paused, for it was yet possible that the sleeping man before him might awake, and perceive the abstraction of his property. Ronald was not generally curious to pry into what did not concern him; but in this case, he was stimulated by the idea that the thick envelope he held might contain the information he so longed to possess. He bent down; Bryant's breathing became yet more heavy; the slumber more deep and unbroken. Ronald having obtained what he wished, stole quietly from the room, into an inner and smaller chamber, and seating himself near the window, hastily tore open the envelope, and began to inspect the contents. It held three or four smaller packets, the inscriptions of which he read with a perplexed and unenlightened expression of face. Then he opened them and read carefully the contents of each, and his interest seemed to deepen.</p>
               <p>At last the task was done; and Ronald having placed each paper in its proper receptacle, gathered all into the large envelope that had contained them, and sat thoughtful and moody for some moments.</p>
               <p>"I see it all," he said; "nearly all, at any rate, and I can guess still more. My course is tolerably plain now; and yet, I must play my cards well and cautiously, or I may lose all in staking too much. Oh yes, my worthy foster father, the promise shall be kept, for I can see now that this precious young puppy may be of as much use to me<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6520-00000045"/> as to you, and would take a great deal of useful power out of my hands, if the hangman or the Thames happened to snatch him from my tender care. But, like many other promises, it will be kept more in the letter than in the spirit, and the result will probably be rather an astonishment to my honored parent. He had better have trusted me: then I might have been on honor; now, I am free to do as suits me. It's a glorious prospect. Captain Grenville must look to himself now, or he may chance to find that the man he has hitherto condescended to patronise and use, will become his master, and a sterner one than he had the power or wits to be. But now I must consider how to replace this lucky discovery of mine before that snoring elephant sleeps off the grog. Stay, I had better take one precaution first."</p>
               <p>He hastily took from his pocket a small ink-horn and pocket-book; once more opened the packet, and rapidly copied some parts of its contents. Then, folding up the copies and the originals, he deposited the first in his own pocket-book, and the others in the envelope from which they had been taken. This done, he stole cautiously back to the apartment, placed the packet in its original resting-place, with a light hand that would not have brushed the cobwebs from the pallet over which he leaned, and without disturbing the slumbers of the unconscious Bryant. He then returned to his pallet, threw himself once more on its pillows, and before Bryant woke from his deep sleep, was himself unconscious of all around him.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
               <p>WHEN Gerard Carlton met his mother at the breakfast-table he contented himself with giving her a very brief account of his previous evening's entertainment; and Mrs. Carlton, who was at present completely absorbed by weightier matters than the gay scenes in which she was willing that her son should mingle for a time, contented herself with a few questions as to Captain Grenville's position and power of befriending Gerard with his uncle, and then allowed the subject to drop.</p>
               <p>"I am going to the lawyer's, Gerard, today, and may not be at home till dinner-time," said Mrs. Carlton. "But I suppose I shall find you there. You have not made any other engagement?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—no," he stammered; "that is, I must call on Grenville, and if he has made any arrangements, he is just the fellow to be offended if I refuse him. But I will get off if I can, my dear mother. I should not like you to be alone for another evening."</p>
               <p>"Never mind, my dear boy," said Mrs. Carlton, smiling sadly. "It would be hard if you cannot have some amusement at your age. But still, Gerard, take care. Remember that there are as many dangers in London gaieties as on a battle-field; and you are my sole happiness in life. It would kill me were you to do wrong yourself, or fall a victim to the teachings of others. Promise me not to forget that your mother only lives in you, dear boy."</p>
               <p>Gerard's heart smote him for his unconscious selfishness, but he could not repress a feeling of relief when his mother drove off, leaving him free to seek the abode of the fascinating Adeline Rivers. He longed to see her by the morning light, to judge of her beauty unadorned by the aid of the brilliant toilette of the previous night, and to hear her converse more quietly and soberly than was possible in the piquant dialogue and gay repartees which Grenville had carried on. He was therefore somewhat annoyed to meet that very handsome and well-bred looking individual, as he turned into the next street from that where Mrs. Rivers resided.</p>
               <p>"Ha, my boy!" said he—"on your way to pay your devoirs to the fair goddess of the house? All right! I have just left her; and I can tell you there is no cause for you to be afraid of a cold reception. She is wonderfully taken with your gallant self, though of course I don't exactly pretend she says so in so many words. But I know her too well to be deceived; and, let me tell you, she is a wonderful catch—not less than a thousand a year at her mother's death, if she marries with her consent."</p>
               <p>Gerard's thoughts involuntarily recurred to Mabel May, and he replied with an involuntary sigh, "Money would never induce me to marry, though I do not pretend to despise it. Miss Rivers is very charming, but I do not know that she is exactly a girl I should choose for a wife."</p>
               <p>"Pooh, pooh, man," said Grenville; "why, you're as precise as my old bachelor uncle. The blunt's the thing, my boy; but, putting the coin out of the question, you must be made of stone if you resist such an opportunity of being the happiest fellow in the world. I only wish I had your chance; but we look on each other as cousins; and she would laugh in my face if I talked to her of love."</p>
               <p>"I was just going to call," said Gerard, evading the subject.</p>
               <p>"All right," said Grenville; "but it's rather too soon, according to London fashion. You had better lounge away an hour or so with me first. And, by the way, do you play billiards?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, a little," replied Gerard; "I used to play a good deal in Dublin, but I am by no means a crack hand."</p>
               <p>"Well, as for me, though I play every day, curse me if I can make a single hazard," said Grenville.</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't mind having a game with you," said Gerard; "but I shall stand no chance with you, I'll answer for it."</p>
               <p>Grenville laughed, and they entered one of the most fashionable gambling houses in London. The hour being early, the table was disengaged, and the young men began their game at once.</p>
               <p>Gerard was unsuccessful at first, but as he went on, the tide of fortune changed; he played carefully and well, and Grenville soon declared himself completely worsted in the game. The trilling stakes, with which they had begun, were seen doubled; still the luck or skill of the new-comer kept in the ascendant, and eventually Gerard left off winner of the whole.</p>
               <p>"I'm not in force to-day," said Grenville, good-humoredly; "but you shall give me my revenge to-morrow. It is three o'clock, so you may now venture to pay your visit, and I will go with you by way of breaking the proverbial awkwardness of a tyro. Am I not a regular Pythias of a friend, eh, Carlton? But I shall expect the same good turn from you when my hour comes."</p>
               <p>"You will hardly convince me you are fire-proof as yet," replied Gerard, laughing. "There is some fair one in the background, I'll swear."</p>
               <p>Grenville looked unusually serious for a moment, then answering carelessly, "Perhaps," quickened his pace, and they were soon at Mrs. Rivers's door.</p>
               <p>The sound of a most delicious voice singing a favorite air was a sufficient assurance that the ladies were at home; and Frederick Grenville, without even inquiring of the servant, led the way up stairs, and softly opened the drawing-room door.</p>
               <p>Adeline was alone, seated at a piano, in one of the recesses of the room, and so engrossed with the rich melody she was pouring forth, that she did not seem aware of their entrance. Grenville signed to Gerard to remain silent, and they stood quiet and motionless till the last note died away, and the fair girl turned with a half sigh of pleasure at her own sweet swelling cadence, which still floated on the air. Her eye fell first on Gerard, and a rich flush mantled on her cheek as she rose to greet him.</p>
               <p>"Have you been here long?" she asked. "Fred, how could you be so treacherous?"</p>
               <p>"Nay, my fair coz," returned Grenville, "say rather how could we have been barbarous enough to interrupt such exquisite melody? We need not ask whether you have suffered from last night—your looks and voice are sufficient proof that you did not."</p>
               <p>"Then they are very deceptive," said the girl, smiling. "I am so tired that I would not go out with mamma; and as to my voice—"</p>
               <p>Captain Grenville yawned, and declared he had an appointment, and could not wait to see his aunt that day. "But," said he, "I need not take you away, Carlton. Adeline will be glad of a companion in her solitude, I have no doubt."</p>
               <p>Miss Rivers did not second the proposal, and the young man was very glad she did not invite him to stay. He would have enjoyed the dangerous pleasure of a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tête-a-tête</foreign> with the lovely girl, whose evident languor gave a new charm to her beauty and manner; but he preferred that she should show a feminine modesty and reluctance to be placed in so doubtful a situation with an almost stranger.</p>
               <p>"Mamma intended to ask you both to dine with us to-morrow evening," she said, with a graceful embarrassment, "and as she is not here, I—I—"</p>
               <p>"All right, Adeline; yes, of course we will dine with you," said Grenville. "You're not engaged, Carlton; and I am not, at least not till late, and you ladies are generally early roosters, unless you have anything going on to keep you awake."</p>
               <p>Gerard desired nothing more agreeable than such a prospect of a quiet, uninterrupted evening with Adeline, and the young men left the house together, Grenville to keep his appointment, and Gerard to cool his excited nerves by a long walk in returning home.</p>
               <p>It was late before Mrs. Carlton returned, and her pale and weary face forbade any attempt on her son's part to question her as to the morning's expedition, or to inform her of his own, had he been so inclined, but he had no such desire. He felt a strange reluctance to mention Adeline Rivers to his mother; he knew not why he should conceal his acquaintance or his admiration of a near relative of Lord Hargrave's; but, by some instinct, he guessed that the brilliant beauty might not be altogether to the taste of his refined, subdued mother; and as, of course, Adeline would never be more to him than a friend, it was useless to trouble Mrs. Carlton about his engagements and acquaintances. His mother did not, however, fail to remark his silence and want of appetite during dinner; but with the gentleness and forbearance that characterised her, forbore to notice it to him. She fancied he might feel some anxiety about his prospects, and quietly endeavored rather to divert his mind from brooding on the uncertainty of the future, without appearing to be aware of its existence. Poor Mrs. Carlton; woman-like, she forgot her own griefs and anxieties, in striving to share and soothe the depression of her darling son.</p>
               <p>On the following day Gerard kept his appointment with Grenville at the billiard rooms. At first, he was again successful, and his companion appeared scarcely able to conceal his annoyance at his continued failures. The stakes had been trilling, as on the previous occasion, but by the constant doubling they increased, till at last Carlton had won twenty-five pounds.</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6520-00000046"/>
               <p>"Now, then, I will only tempt fate, or my own awkwardness, once more," said Grenville; "let us play for fifty,—eh, my boy?"</p>
               <p>Carlton assented, and again they played, Gerard betting with the marker as to the issue of the game, in which he had now become feverishly excited. Both the young men played with extreme care and <choice>
                     <sic>precison</sic>
                     <corr>precision</corr>
                  </choice>, and for some time the fortune appeared nearly equal; but at last, a few bold, successful strokes of Grenville's cue made him victor, and Gerard was now as much the debtor of his antagonist as he had previously been the creditor.</p>
               <p>"Come, my boy, don't look so downcast,—fortune of war, you know," said Grenville. "There, it's a mere bagatelle; you'll get twice as much from me next time."</p>
               <p>"I have done extremely wrong in staking when I have not the money about me to pay you," said Gerard; "but I will discharge the debt to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Gerard; don't bother yourself or your seniors about such bosh!" exclaimed Grenville. "I dare say you are something like myself; living on your expectations at present; and it's no good explaining all the little pleasures and necessities of life to the reverend signiors and dames, our masters and teachers. You'll be in funds when you get your appointment, and then you shall pay me and help me too, in case of need, so don't worry your brains. Have you enough for the rascal yonder?"</p>
               <p>"The marker, do you mean?" asked Gerard.</p>
               <p>"Of course," replied Grenville; "and by the way, you were a fool to bet with him, they are all scoundrelly cheats. But are you prepared for him?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, I'm not quite so bare as that," said Gerard, laughing; and taking out his purse, he paid his bet, and for the table, and they left the house together.</p>
               <p>The hour for the dinner engagement at last arrived, though the interval seemed long and wearisome to Gerard's excited spirits. He dreaded his own thoughts just then, and longed to drown care and repentance in the intoxication of Adeline's smiles. But though he was early at the house, Grenville had already preceded him, and Gerard felt a momentary pang of jealousy at seeing him carelessly lounging on a couch by Adeline's side. But the sweet smile and beautiful delicate blush with which the girl greeted him, and the cordial welcome of Mrs. Rivers, soon extinguished the rising suspicion, and he despised himself for the weakness which could not endure to see another enjoy the privileges which were his due.</p>
               <p>"I shall have to ask your indulgence, my dear aunt, for running away as soon as I have had a cup of coffee," said Grenville, after the small, but elegantly served dinner was over. "A friend has just arrived from the country, and I promised to meet him at my club to-night. But I always fancy myself so completely at home here, that I am apt to take liberties."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Rivers gave a maternal glance at the handsome young officer, which spoke far more than the half-playful reproach she made him for his soft, flattering speeches.</p>
               <p>"I think the apology is due rather to Mr. Carlton for leaving him to two poor women for amusement," said Adeline, playfully. "It is only intolerable conceit to fancy that your desertion needs any palliative as far as we are concerned,"</p>
               <p>"Oh, sing and talk poetry to Gerard, and he will be quite content," said Grenville, gaily. "I should only be in the way, and keep my aunt from her nap in trying to entertain me. Adieu, good people all."</p>
               <p>Kissing his hand to the ladies, and nodding his adieu to Gerard, the young officer left the room.</p>
               <p>Gerard was not slow in profiting by his friend's hint. He begged permission to accompany the ladies to the drawing-room, and entreating Adeline to sing, he accepted Mrs. Rivers's invitation to take a seat on her sofa, while her daughter went to find some music that had been accidentally left in another <choice>
                     <sic>aparment</sic>
                     <corr>apartment</corr>
                  </choice>.</p>
               <p>"You must be surprised that we do not see more of Lord Hargrave, considering our relationship," said the lady when Adeline had left the room. "But the truth is, my wilful child disappointed him in a favorite scheme, and he cannot forgive us."</p>
               <p>Gerard looked the curiosity he was too polite to express, and the lady went on.</p>
               <p>"The earl had set his heart on Adeline's marrying his and my nephew and his heir, so as to unite all the property of the family, and secure Fred from the risks that beset young men. Fred was very much bent on it, but Adeline could not like him, and she would not give her hand without her heart. Fred is a fine, warm-hearted fellow, and did not bear any ill-will to Adeline for not being able to return his affection; but her uncle will never forgive her, I believe, till they are both of them married."</p>
               <p>Gerard had barely time to express his surprise at such injustice when Adeline returned, and in the delight of listening to her sweet voice, he soon forgot all but herself. But when, after an evening of exquisite enjoyment, he departed with a gentle encouragement from one lady, and a warm invitation from another to repeat the visit as often as he chose, the young man began to reflect on what he had heard, and to entertain for the first time a half-confessed, vague idea that the random assertions of the young officer were not quite so wild as he had imagined, and that were Fanny Adams not in existence, and if he could forget Mabel May, he might both win and be happy with Adeline Rivers.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
               <p>FREDERICK GRENVILLE'S engagement had not been a purely imaginary one; nay, more, he had the rare merit of having in the letter, if not the spirit, given a really true and accurate representation of its nature. Within half-an-hour of the time when he quitted the house of Mrs. Rivers, he was sitting in a private room of one of the then famous gambling-houses in the Haymarket, in close conversation with a man, not only younger, but, to the first glance, handsomer and more elegant in appearance and dress than himself.</p>
               <p>Ronald of the Rath was wonderfully changed from the carelessly-attired though handsome brigand who had played so conspicuous a part in the misfortunes of Gerard Carlton. The somewhat heavy moustache had been carefully trimmed, the beard entirely cut off, the whiskers shaved from the smooth, even cheeks,—changes which alone would have completely served for a disguise, had such been his object. But the whole toilette, so tastefully chosen, so carefully arranged; the elegance of its every adjunct, the proud carelessness of the whole attitude and bearing, were rather the characteristics of a high-born gentleman, than the robber of the Rath. Indeed, Frederick Grenville himself by no means showed to advantage by the side of the doubtfully born, and strangely reared, Ronald, the brigand's foster son.</p>
               <p>"So you have determined on trying your fortune once more, eh, Ronald?" said Grenville, as he lighted a cigar, and pushed the claret jug to his companion.</p>
               <p>I have determined with your help, Captain Grenville, on conquering it," replied Ronald, drily. "But you will kindly remember in future that my name is Reginald Saville; it will suit my plans better, and be more telling."</p>
               <p>"Oh, just as you please,—anything under a Royal Highness is quite immaterial to me," said Grenville, carelessly; "but what commands has your sublime lordship for me, that you marked your summons, 'Private and immediate?'"</p>
               <p>"Oh, that will soon be explained, sooner than you may quite like," said Ronald, with unmoved composure. "But, first, I want to know what is going on just now—any fat pigeons fit for plucking?—any goose with golden eggs fit for killing?"</p>
               <p>"Well, matters are rather dull in that respect just now," replied Grenville; "but there is always business to be done, and you have got yourself up in such splendid style that I suppose you are going to try a higher line than formerly."</p>
               <p>Ronald's blood rushed to his face for a moment; then he said, in his old quiet tone, "It all depends on what introductions you can give your friend Mr. Saville, the son of an Irish gentleman of fortune, come to amuse himself for a season or two in town, before he settles on his property."</p>
               <p>"Are you mad?" exclaimed Grenville, absolutely starting in astonishment; "or are you playing a bad jest on me, Master Ronald the sharper, the smuggler, the—"</p>
               <p>"Stop a moment, Captain, or rather, Lieutenant Frederick Grenville, nephew, and possible heir of Lord Hargrave, of Tilney Hall, and many a broad acre besides, but also, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">roué</foreign>, gambler, insolvent, and—shall I add more?"</p>
               <p>Grenville had now recovered himself, and his face resumed its usual careless expression.</p>
               <p>"Come, Ronald, this is more like scolding fishwives than men of the world," said he. "Let us drop abuse, which may not be safe for either party, and come to common sense. You could not be serious in your insinuation that I was to present you to my friends on equal terms, and under a shallow pretence that could so easily be detected."</p>
               <p>"Perfectly serious," replied Ronald; "nay, more, you must and will do it, though I leave you to make what story you like, that you think most plausible; but the thing itself is indispensable to my welfare and yours."</p>
               <p>"I am at a loss to know what I have to do with your friends or social position," said Grenville haughtily. "Once for all, I have condescended to associate with you when we met by chance, and my friends have more than once followed my example, and lost a few hundreds to you when they wanted better amusement. But to bring you into my circle as an equal, to impose a low-born sharper on them as a gentleman, would stamp me for life; and though I grant you have been useful to me at times, I must break off the connection, if your brain becomes so completely turned by my good-nature as to dream of such insolent pretensions."</p>
               <p>Ronald listened with most unmoved calmness to Grenville's haughty speech, and knocked the ash off of his cigar with provoking nonchalance, ere he replied, "I always thought you a man of sense, who was ready to take the consequences of his little follies, and not stick at trifles. I am sorry for you, Grenville; 'pon my soul I am."</p>
               <p>Frederick Grenville's hot blood rushed into his face—he snatched up the silver case, that happened to be the nearest object to him, and dashed it violently at his companion's face. Ronald quietly avoided the blow by a quick movement of the head, and put the elegant toy in his pocket.</p>
               <p>"Rather a rough way of making a present, Grenville," said he; "but I am not over fastidious where a friend is concerned. But it may be as well to leave these boyish pranks for less serious occasions, and to go at once to business. It concerns you more than myself, and you will rue the day you made me an enemy, if you are mad enough to give way to such fool's passion again."</p>
               <p>There was a cool dignity in the look and tone with which these words were spoken,<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6520-00000047"/> that warned Grenville he could not trifle with impunity with that slight, youthful-looking, obscure man, whom he would fain have despised and crushed, like the remains of the cigar he was smoking.</p>
               <p>"It is you that are to blame, Ronald, for beating about the bush instead of speaking out like a man of spirit," said Grenville. "What am I to gain by complying with your wild demands?"</p>
               <p>"Safety, fortune, the woman you love," replied Ronald.</p>
               <p>Grenville started slightly, but his self-control was not to be so easily shaken again.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you will explain these dark riddles," said he. "I am dull, or lazy, and must decline guessing them."</p>
               <p>"It is easily done," replied Ronald. "I think your memory is not so short as to require refreshing as to some little transactions which would rather compromise your safety, if I chose to bring them to light; a word of mine could destroy your boasted heirship to Lord Hargrave's title and estates, and I fancy you know pretty well that without them you would lose the slightest chance of winning Mabel May. Now, are you enlightened?"</p>
               <p>Grenville's mouth had been sternly compressed, till the full voluptuous lips had nearly disappeared, as Ronald spoke, and then they scarcely parted enough to speak the single word which was his reply.—"Proofs!" he demanded.</p>
               <p>"There is only one of my assertions that wants proof, and that is the second," replied Ronald. "The rest you know perfectly well to be true. If you want proof, you shall have it; but walls have ears, and others might be less cautions than I am."</p>
               <p>He bent forward, and whispered for a few moments in Grenville's ear, and as he did so, the color receded from the flushed face, and the features seemed to sharpen and grow fixed, as if galvanized into rigidity.</p>
               <p>"Is that enough?—would you like to know the full extent of your danger and my power, Captain Grenville?" said Ronald, as he resumed his former careless position. "If so, I have accurate copies of existing documents at your service, which I could use at any moment to destroy your boasted prospects. And now, what do you say to my proposal?"</p>
               <p>Grenville was no coward—he would have called any man out who dared to insult him, and he had perhaps never known what fear of death meant. But he had all the moral weakness of a selfish voluptuary; and the idea of losing the fortune and rank, with all their concomitant advantages, to which he had looked forward from childhood as his own, was beyond his fortitude.</p>
               <p>"You are a very devil, Ronald," he said; "but if one must have dealings with that artful gentleman, they may as well be carried on pleasantly and fairly. Tell me what you mean to do to free me from this awkward little predicament, and then I can judge what your services are worth."</p>
               <p>"Well, in the first place silence alone is worth a good deal," replied Ronald; "but for old friendship's sake I am willing to go further, and make a handsome offer—only I stand to it, remember; no haggling like a fishwoman cheapening her wares."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Grenville, "will you put him out of my way?"</p>
               <p>"Not in the sense you mean," replied Ronald; "but I will do it quite as effectually. You see, noble Captain, I am frank and open, and I tell you candidly, your little escapade just now proved to me, that though you may do a good deal for money, you will do very little for love of your faithful Achates; and if the troublesome individual in question was for ever silenced, my modest requests might be made hereafter in vain. Now I engage not only to prevent any unpleasant revelations, but so to arrange my plans and yours that they would be useless, and very unwelcome, to the parties most concerned. I will so manage that the man who threatens to destroy your every prospect, and disappoint your most cherished hopes, shall actually work to their accomplishment, and that you shall have the satisfaction of seeing his disgrace and ruin. Is not that enough to merit any reward I choose to ask?"</p>
               <p>"But the other plan is swiftest and surest," said Grenville.</p>
               <p>"Pooh! it is clumsy, butcher-like, not worthy such brains as mine," said Ronald. "And, in plain English, I will not do it, nor give you the slightest clue to enable you to discover the person of whom I speak, unless you give me your written engagement to do what I demand. In one word, yes or no."</p>
               <p>"You are too peremptory and sudden in your demands," said Grenville, vainly striving to resume his old haughty superiority of manner. "Give me your stipulations in writing, and I will give you my reply in a day or two."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me," said Ronald, "but that will not suit me. I must have your reply at once. As to the written conditions you require, that is soon managed. I am always prepared for emergencies."</p>
               <p>He drew out an inkhorn and a folded blank sheet, wrote rapidly for a few minutes, and then pushed it across the table to his companion. Grenville read it attentively; but his face lowered at every fresh condition.</p>
               <p>"Extortionate!—impossible!" trembled on his lips, but there was a look in the brilliant eyes bent on him, which stopped the utterance of those words.</p>
               <p>"This is unreasonable, Ronald—out of my power to accomplish!" he said at last; "especially the sum you require at once. I have not as many pounds as you ask hundreds."</p>
               <p>"The heir of Hargrave Castle scarcely need be at a loss for such a small sum," said Ronald. "To my knowledge you have got ten times as much from your uncle before now."</p>
               <p>"But that is an additional reason why I cannot—dare not ask more," said Grenville.</p>
               <p>"You must make up some plausible tale, or worse dangers may have to be encountered," said Ronald.</p>
               <p>"And suppose I comply," said Grenville, "and you are recognised by any one who has seen you in your real character?"</p>
               <p>"It is not certain that any one has done so," replied Ronald, quietly. "I am perhaps no more what I seem than you are, Captain Grenville; and it may be that I am by birth your equal, if not your superior. It is not wise to tamper with what we do not understand, and I advise you to leave the business to me, and do my bidding as soon as possible. Here is the pen; I will call up that fellow who is waiting on us to witness your signature, so that there may be no awkward mistakes. Perhaps you will ring; you are near the bell."</p>
               <p>Grenville rang the bell with a violence that soon brought the astonished waiter to the room, with a look that evidently anticipated some terrible catastrophe from such a summons. He was probably somewhat disappointed to find that the two gentlemen were perfectly sound in limb and wind, that not even a broken glass was to be seen, as proof of any unpleasant difference of opinion between them, and that the only service required of him was to affix his name to the paper, which Captain Grenville signed in his presence. However, the douceur of two half-crowns, bestowed on him by the handsome companion of his old guest, was some compensation, and he readily took the hint that he was to hold his tongue as well as his pen, in their service.</p>
               <p>A few minutes later, and the two friends left the house together.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
               <p>THE excitements of the memorable day which had passed so swiftly for Gerard Carlton were not yet at an end. On his return home, after a prolonged walk, by way of cooling his fevered spirits, he found a note lying on the table, requesting him to call on Lord Hargrave on the following morning, as he believed he should then have some welcome news for him. Of course, this could only refer to an appointment, and Gerard eagerly longed for the confirmation of the hopes thus held out. His recent loss to Grenville, his newly awakened fancy for Adeline, and the desire for independence that his recent introduction to the busy world naturally excited, combined to make such a prospect as Lord Hargrave's note seemed to indicate, doubly welcome to him. On the following morning he was at the breakfast-table long before his mother made her appearance, and eagerly met her with the exciting news he had to communicate.</p>
               <p>"It is well, very well, my dear boy," she said, sadly; "more especially as I am obliged to leave you sooner than I had anticipated. My business in London has not ended as I had hoped, and I must elsewhere prosecute the inquiries which I have to make. Indeed, I waited later than usual for your return last night, that I might tell you my plans, but I was not quite well, and went to bed before you returned."</p>
               <p>All Gerard's old, tender feelings returned at the idea of his mother's suffering; all was forgotten, but that she was perhaps the only being in the world to whom he owed love and duty, or who would give one loving thought to him living—one regretful tear if dead.</p>
               <p>"Dearest mother, you are ill! Why did you not tell me sooner? How could you let me be in ignorance?" he said, anxiously. "You must not leave—indeed you must not. You are not fit to travel, still less to be alone."</p>
               <p>"I am going where there are those who knew me in former days," she replied; "and as to my health, it would suffer more by suspense and inaction than aught else. But we will not sadden the time we spend together by such melancholy subjects. I am thankful that Lord Hargrave has not disappointed the expectations I had formed as to his power and will to serve you."</p>
               <p>Gerard was silent for a moment; he hesitated to ask the question that trembled on his lips.</p>
               <p>"Mother, pardon the question," he said at last; "but have I any claim on Lord Hargrave's kindness?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton's pale cheek slightly flushed, as she replied, "I told you once that I had never even seen him, Gerard. There is no such tie as you might naturally imagine, but still there are reasons—circumstances—which to a generous heart would, perhaps, be powerful inducements to befriend you; but do not presume on this knowledge, Gerard. Let every exertion be made on your part to repay what is in truth spontaneous kindness on your patron's part, and remember that, in all probability, your future career will depend entirely on the use you make of his favor, and the position it has secured for you."</p>
               <p>"Then I am no relative of his—I have only his pity as a guarantee for the continuance of his friendship?" demanded Gerard, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"You have no claim on him but what unmerited misfortune exercises on every noble heart," replied Mrs. Carlton, firmly. "Ask me no more, Gerard, for I cannot answer your questions. Do your duty, and leave<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6520-00000048"/> the rest to Him who can bring all things to light, and vindicate the cause of the helpless and the oppressed."</p>
               <p>Gerard was silenced, but not satisfied, and the meal was finished with little further remark on either side, though the hearts of both were full of the same absorbing subject of interest.</p>
               <p>Gerard, with a little pardonable vanity, had taken unusual pains with his toilet before setting off for his appointment, and a mother's pride could scarcely have wished to see a nobler or more high bred looking fellow than he looked when he came to bid her good-by.</p>
               <p>"Remember my caution, dear boy, she said, "and receive Lord Hargrave's kindness, as it deserves, with modest gratitude."</p>
               <p>Gerard's heart was full of eager, beating anxiety and expectation, as he was ushered into the library of his patron. Lord Hargrave was not there, and the young man was fain to amuse himself as he best could till he entered. A large portrait, evidently of the peer himself in youth, hung opposite to the chimney-piece, and Gerard gazed at it with interest, trying to trace in the fine, thoughtful features the same characteristics as in the noble but care-worn face of the maturer man. A step sounding in the distance roused him from its contemplation, and the young man hastily turned from it to the fire which was burning in the grate. As he did so, he caught the reflection of his own face in the glass, and started involuntarily as the familiar features met his eyes. It might be fancy; it might be the pre-occupation of his thoughts and attention on the idea which his mother's words had conjured up; but he could not resist the impression—the strong, if erroneous conviction, that his own face bore a strong resemblance to the portrait he had been examining, that the features were singularly alike in form, and the expression in that moment of grave and anxious thought, scarcely less kindred in character. He had scarcely time to recover the surprise this discovery excited, when the door opened, and the original of the portrait entered the room.</p>
               <p>Lord Hargrave greeted his young visitor with his usual dignified courtesy, and proceeded at once to explain the business on which he had sent for him.</p>
               <p>"I have been fortunate enough to obtain for you a situation in the Customs, with three hundred per annum," he said. "It is not perhaps all that a young man of expensive tastes would wish, or consider sufficient for his expenses; but as you have been brought up in simpler habits than the young men of this large metropolis are accustomed to, I imagine you will find no difficulty in keeping your expenditure within bounds. Do you intend to remain with your mother?"</p>
               <p>Gerard explained that Mrs. Carlton was about to leave London for Somersetshire. Lord Hargrave looked surprised.</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" said he; "to Taunton?"</p>
               <p>Gerard had not mentioned that town, and the knowledge of his mother's destination struck him as somewhat remarkable.</p>
               <p>"I believe so," he replied; "but the arrangement is rather sudden, and I have not inquired particularly into my mother's plans."</p>
               <p>"Right," said the peer. "If I judge her correctly, she is a woman to be trusted, and you cannot prove yourself more worthy of confidence than when you do not intrude on it. But to business; you will wait on the nobleman from whom I obtained your appointment, to receive its confirmation, and express your gratitude, and then enter on its duties at once. And, excuse me, but I have taken an interest in you, young man; you resemble a dear friend long since dead, and I will not fail to stand your friend, if you deserve it. I know there are always unavoidable expenses on beginning a new course of life, and it is not right that your mother should have her income entrenched on for these extra claims. Do me the favor to accept this note, and use it, for any little wants that may arise."</p>
               <p>Gerard hesitated; but Lord Hargrave's smile was so genuinely kind, so almost paternal in its expression, that his pride could not take offence at a benefit so delicately offered.</p>
               <p>He thanked his patron with a frank, warm gratitude, which Lord Hargrave evidently appreciated, and then rose to take leave.</p>
               <p>"I will not detain you longer from your mother," said the earl, kindly, "she will naturally be anxious to hear of your prospects; but remember, I shall expect to see you occasionally, and my nephew will I am sure, give you all the advice or information you may require in making your future arrangements. Only remember, his income and expectations are rather on a different scale from yours—you will excuse the caution from a man more that twice your age."</p>
               <p>Gerard once more thanked the earl, and took his leave. When he gained the street, he examined the bank note placed in his hands. It was for fifty pounds; and as he had really no immediate wants, save the debt to Grenville, the power it gave him to discharge that obligation without having recourse to his mother was especially gratifying, and once more the thought rose to los mind—"Why all this kindness from a stranger, and one whom my mother tells me she has never even seen?" However, it was no time to dwell on the fanciful speculation. His first duty was to hasten back to his mother, and to relieve her mind as to his prospects. He then determined to call on Grenville, discharge his debt, and not contract such obligations again.</p>
               <p>The young officer was lounging over a late breakfast, when Gerard was announced, and appeared heartily glad to see him.</p>
               <p>"Well, my boy, you're in luck, as I told you before," said Grenville; "it's not every day such plums are to be caught dropping into one's mouth. "I'm waiting for my own little piece of fortune, as my uncle has promised to purchase a captain's commission for me. I'm tired of being a sub, and rather want to change into another regiment. But, meanwhile, you and I will enjoy ourselves, and trust me for carrying out my good uncle's directions to initiate you into life."</p>
               <p>"Only your sphere and mine will be rather different," said Gerard, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Pooh, pooh!" said the young officer; "I'm only plain Fred Grenville, whatever I may be some day; and my uncle's not too old to marry even yet, so I don't count my chickens, lest other broods may take their place. But joking apart, you'll dine with me to-morrow evening? I have two or three friends coming—all jovial fellows, I promise you."</p>
               <p>Gerard hesitated; but he remembered his mother and Lord Hargrave had both laid a stress on his cultivating Grenville's friendship, and he decided on accepting the invitation.</p>
               <p>"I can't promise you such a fascinating evening as you had with my fair cousin," said Grenville; "she is a girl not often to be met with; and, by the way, you could not, I believe, please my uncle better than in making up to her. Though he never sees her now, he admires her exceedingly, and will, I doubt not, leave her some thousands at his death, and give her a handsome wedding present, if she marries to his liking."</p>
               <p>This agreed so completely with Mrs. River's hints, that Gerard was at no loss to understand it, and though he knew it was completely out of the question for such a marriage to take place, he could not help speculating on what might have been, under different circumstances.</p>
               <p>Gerard was somewhat taken by surprise on his return home to find trunks and carpet bags in the hall, and to hear from the servant that her mistress had determined to leave town that evening. Gerard rushed to his mother's room, forgetting for the moment his own good fortune in the sudden separation; but Mrs. Carlton's calm reception somewhat reassured his fears for her.</p>
               <p>"I am better, much better," she said, "and I find I must not lose any time, Gerard, if I wish to accomplish the object of my journey. And now that you are settled, my mind will be at rest. Lucy will go with me, and you know I am in good keeping with her."</p>
               <p>"But shall you remain long at Taunton?" he asked, anxiously.</p>
               <p>"It is uncertain," she replied—"perhaps only for a week or two, perhaps for months. But Gerard, as life is always uncertain, and we cannot take too many precautions against its untimely end, I have made arrangements for you to learn all that it imports you to know, in case of my death. The packet which contains the story of my unhappiness and your wrongs, my poor boy, I have intrusted to Lord Hargrave's care, and requested him to give it you when I am no more, or whenever I may desire it; and here is an order for fifty pounds on the solicitor who manages my small income. It is all I can do for you, and you must manage to live on it till your first quarter's salary comes in, for my expenses have been of course much larger lately, and I may require to spend more in the search I am making."</p>
               <p>Gerard was so naturally open and honorable, that the words which would have told of Lord Hargrave's gift instinctively rose to his lips, but then it would have involved the necessity of confessing his debt to Captain Grenville; and why alarm and distress his mother by such an unnecessary confidence? So he checked the impulse, and received the order his mother gave him with a firm resolution that it should be the last claim he would make on her slender income.</p>
               <p>"I know I am making a great demand on your faith and confidence in me, Gerard, by asking you to act on motives which I cannot explain to you," resumed Mrs. Carlton; "but it is for your own peace and welfare, as I firmly believe, that I should observe this line of conduct. And there is one more caution I have to give to you, one promise to exact—do not form or confirm any engagement; nay, if possible, check any fresh attachment on your part till you have consulted me or Lord Hargrave. It is no arbitrary maternal jealousy, but a precaution that your peculiar position renders necessary; and my son will not doubt his mother's willingness to consent to any of his wishes, to the utmost of her power."</p>
               <p>"Mother," said Gerard, "is it to Mabel May you are alluding when you speak of such a contingency?"</p>
               <p>"Mabel May can never be more to you than she is now," replied Mrs. Carlton, earnestly. "Oh, Gerard, if you would not make me more wretched than I am already, tell me that you do not love that girl—that you will never even think of, or wish anything but the chance acquaintanceship which so unfortunately introduced you to her."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton's still beautiful eyes were fixed on her son's face with imploring earnestness, and her voice trembled with emotion, as she repeated, "Promise me, Gerard; speak! tell me the truth; do you, will you obey me, or rather will you grant my humble prayer, and forget Mabel May, if indeed you have been unfortunate enough ever to think of her but as a friend?"</p>
               <p>"Mother, I will never willingly deceive you," said Gerard, "nor add one grief to your sorrows. I have loved Mabel, as you may well believe. You saw how beautiful, you know how brave and noble she was. But the dream is over; she scorned and rejected me; and though I may never love<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6520-00000049"/> again, as I loved her, yet I would not sue a second time, even were it possible. Be satisfied; you need never fear that your son will so humble himself, even to her."</p>
               <p>"But if she should change," said Mrs. Carlton; "if she encourages you, if you should meet again, you will not break your promise, Gerard?"</p>
               <p>"Is it necessary to assure you I will not, mother?" said Gerard. "If it is, nothing I can say could avail to satisfy you."</p>
               <p>"True, true," said Mrs. Carlton; "I was wrong; but one day you will understand all—all my fears, my doubts, my uncertainties, and pity rather than blame any of the weaknesses and apparent caprices of your unfortunate mother, will you not, Gerard?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carlton's smile was so bewitchingly soft and tender, and the flush of excitement had lighted up her face with such a bright youthful animation, that Gerard could not resist a glance of almost wondering admiration, and a renewed feeling of surprise and resentment towards the man who could wrong and desert one so lovely and so good.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the day passed in the lingering, last fond words, and hurried arrangements, and forced cheerfulness of such leave-takings; and then at last all was over, and Gerard turned from the coach-door, after his final adieu and long last look, with a deep sadness that a temporary separation could hardly have warranted. Had he, indeed any presentiment that it might be a final one? or did the shadows of the dangers and evils that were gathering round him cast a gloom over his young, and, in spite of all his trials, still buoyant and elastic spirit?</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII</head>
               <p>THE dinner at Fred Grenville's was the first event that roused Gerard from the fit of dejection that had seized him, and which he tried in vain to shake off. Perhaps it was a natural reaction after a strong excitement; perhaps the unusual quiet and solitude of the hours that passed after his mother's departure had depressed him; still more probable was it, that the very prohibition to any further thought of Mabel May, had brought back in full force his old and deep love for her, and given fresh vividness to the image which had been somewhat obscured by Adeline's more recent attractions.</p>
               <p>It was certain that Gerard felt a strange reluctance to visit Adeline as, under different circumstances, he might have done, and that the pure, calm beauty of Mabel's face, the dignified modesty of her manner, and the soft, feminine tone of her whole character, had never appeared so bewitching, so superior as now, and that Adeline's brilliant, piquant manner, dazzling beauty, and many accomplishments, suffered in the comparison.</p>
               <p>"I am a fool," he thought, "a perverse idiot, to cling to shadows when I can grasp reality. If Grenville is to be believed, a match with his cousin would be both a possible and an advantageous marriage for me, while Mabel is now doubly lost to me; and yet, I would give years of my life could I venture to entertain hopes of winning the girl who despised me, while I shrink from seizing the prize within my grasp. Well, I will go to-morrow and see once more what effect she has on me; I will be calm and dispassionate, and judge more impartially of her than I have yet done."</p>
               <p>As Gerard came to this conclusion he arrived at Grenville's door, and in a moment more was in the midst of a small group of fashionable-looking and brilliant men, who acknowledged with flattering <foreign xml:lang="FRA">empressment</foreign> the introduction of the new comer to the circle.</p>
               <p>"We only wait for Saville," said Captain Grenville, ringing the bell; "and no doubt he will be here before dinner is served; ha! there is his knock, he is too well bred to be unpunctual, I know."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, the door again opened, and "Mr. Saville" was announced. Gerard scarcely turned, for his attention was chiefly occupied in scanning the faces of the young men who constituted the party already assembled, and who scarcely improved on the closer inspection. But yet, Gerard could not have defined what he yet perfectly and instinctively felt was unpleasant in the handsome faces and stylish air of his new acquaintances, unless it was the covert sneer, the ill-concealed cynicism of the expression of the hard mouth of the one, and the cold, grey eyes of the other. At last, his turn came for the introduction to Saville, and the first glance of the strangely familiar features, made him look back on the brief past, to decide where he could have seen them before.</p>
               <p>Ronald's whole appearance was so changed, and the time when they had met had been so confused and hurried, that it was almost impossible Gerard could connect him with the young brigand of the Rath; and yet that there was some unpleasant association with him was certain, or rather, as he decided, with some one who had accidentally resembled his new acquaintance. But Ronald's careless bow, and complete unconsciousness of expression and manner, soon banished any slight suspicions that could cross Gerard's mind; and before dinner was half over he had forgotten all but admiration at Saville's graceful and brilliant wit, and extreme and polished courtesy, which seemed peculiarly directed to himself. The dishes were exquisite, the wines first-rate, and the conversation brilliant and unflagging, till the dessert had been put on the table and partially discussed. And then Grenville seemed anxious to prevent vent any chance of excess, at least so his words implied.</p>
               <p>"Come," said he, "I know you are none of you great wine-bibbers, and I hate a regular drinking bout. What shall we do, go to the theatre, eh, Talbot?"</p>
               <p>"There's nothing going on but what we have all seen <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ad nauseam</foreign>," said Talbot. "Why not have a game at whist?"</p>
               <p>"We are five," observed Saville; "but I should be delighted to look on."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, but I should really prefer sitting out," said Gerard. "I suspect I should seem a sad novice to you professed players, and I shall be much amused, and instructed too, in looking on, a combination of advantages not often found."</p>
               <p>"Oh, well, let it be so for the first rubber," said Grenville; "and then you can cut in when you see our style of play. To judge from your billiard playing you are no such novice as you pretend."</p>
               <p>Gerard laughingly disclaimed, and the table was quickly formed. The game soon became interesting; the players were tolerably matched, and for a short time the run was pretty equal, till at last Grenville and Saville, who were partners, appeared to have a regular run of ill-luck, and Gerard eagerly accepted a bet of five pounds, which Grenville offered, that they would still win the rubber. The first game went dead against them, and Gerard offered to cancel his bet even then; but Grenville refused.</p>
               <p>"I have faith in our luck, or rather your skill, Saville," said he; "for I am no great proficient in whist."</p>
               <p>Again the cards were dealt, this time rather more favorably, an advantage which Saville was not slow to improve; and even to Gerard's less practised eye, Grenville appeared to understand his partner's play better than before. Point after point was made, and at last the whilome losers were declared the winners of five points, and Gerard's five pounds were of course gone.</p>
               <p>"Suppose you take Saville's place, and I will help you to win it back again," said Grenville, laughing. "There, we will have another bottle up, to cheer Talbot and Hartly, and give us fresh life."</p>
               <p>"Better have punch—we have had wine enough," said Talbot.</p>
               <p>The motion was carried, the punch was soon brought and made, and once more the game began, though with the change that Gerard should be Talbot's partner, and Hartly, Grenville's, to change <choice>
                     <sic>somwhat</sic>
                     <corr>somewhat</corr>
                  </choice> the run of luck. Again the cards proved adverse to Gerard, as the result of the bet had before done. The glasses were filled once more, as the cards were dealt for the last time; and scarcely had the game been declared to be in Grenville and Talbot's favor when Gerard, who had just drained his tumbler, in the excitement of the moment, turned pale, started up from his chair, and fell insensible on the floor.</p>
               <p>"Ha! a young one," laughed Talbot. He'll soon get seasoned under your teaching, Grenville; but as I have no taste for these little exigencies, I'm off. Are you coming, Hartley? I shall look in at Brooke's for an hour."</p>
               <p>The young man readily complied, and they left the room almost without even saying "good-night" to their host, while he and Saville were busy in raising the insensible Gerard, and carrying him to the inner apartment, which was Grenville's dressing-room, and contained a large sofa among its furniture.</p>
               <p>"Better unfasten his cravat," said Grenville, "or he might chance to choke himself, and that might look awkward, considering we were at hand, or supposed to be."</p>
               <p>He suited the action to the word, and hastily tore open the shirt collar, which still somewhat impeded the free respiration of the now heavily breathing Gerard. He gazed for a moment on the open throat, and turned almost as colorless as the face before him.</p>
               <p>"Good heavens, is it possible! Then this is really true?" he murmured, hoarsely.</p>
               <p>Saville listened, with a quiet sneer on his handsome mouth.</p>
               <p>"Did you doubt it?" he said coldly. "I have my own notions of honor, Captain Grenville; and though they may not be very precise, according to a parson's notions, yet I suspect they are somewhat stricter than those of Lord Hargrave's nephew and heir. I never violate them; and when I make the deliberate arrangements we have entered into, I consider any suspicion an insult. You are satisfied now, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>Grenville's eyes were still fixed on Gerard's unconscious face.</p>
               <p>"Fool that I was," he murmured; "I might have seen the likeness when we first met. Ronald, it is a terribly hazardous game we are playing; better make sure at once. I would pay well—very well for the service; make you at ease for life, gratify your utmost ambition, and—"</p>
               <p>"Bring yourself and me to a halter," said Ronald. "Thank you, most honorably, but my ambition does not soar so high, nor am I quite so barbarously inclined where the gentler measures will do. Really, one would think that I was the high-born heir, and you the obscure, professional smuggler and murderer."</p>
               <p>Grenville glared at him like a savage bloodhound; but the cool, keen gaze of. Ronald's dark eyes turned his rage into a more prudent calculation of consequences.</p>
               <p>"Come away," he said; "the very sight of that hated interloper—upstart—villain, makes my blood boil, and I don't know what I am talking about."</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6520-00000050"/>
               <p>They went into the outer room, and Grenville, turning the contents of one of the nearly empty decanters into a tumbler, drained it at a draught.</p>
               <p>"Now," said he, "I am cooler, and can listen to you. Again I ask you, what security have I that the truth may not be buzzed abroad before the plans you have laid can be carried out."</p>
               <p>"I will tell you," replied Ronald. "First, I am the only person, save yourself, who is in full possession of the secret. The person who might perhaps have been most dangerous, is quietly sleeping, or, rather, disappearing, in the damp waters of the Athy canal, and the worthy friend and colleague from whom I got my information, has scarcely sufficient knowledge of the world to put the various facts together to much purpose. It is therefore next to impossible that such a thing can happen. And secondly, to judge from appearances, the time will not be a very long one that will be necessary to finish the matter in a natural way, and in these cases, like small-pox, that is always most effectual."</p>
               <p>"But Mabel—Miss May—what then?" said Grenville. "I don't see that your plan secures anything in that quarter."</p>
               <p>"Humph!" said Ronald; "I wish it would be as certain to get me the little heiress I have set my mind on. Why, man, it's half the battle to secure your estates and title in reversion, and the other half consists in proving the unworthiness of the man she prefers; that is ten times better than exciting her pity by killing him."</p>
               <p>"You're a devil incarnate I do think, Ronald!" exclaimed Grenville, on whom the liquor was beginning to take some effect. "But think not that your neck will escape if you let the prey slip. I'm not going to be balked, I can tell you."</p>
               <p>"We'll swing together then," said the brigand, coolly; "for I can tell you, that one won't get into the noose without the other. But, no fear, I never miss my aim. And now, I'm off. Let him sleep it off, and don't take any notice in the morning, but take him to your fair cousin's as soon as you can, by way of forgetting his troubles for the time."</p>
               <p>Ronald nodded, with an air of familiar carelessness that galled the proud Grenville to the quick, and left the room.</p>
               <p>Grenville sat for a few moments in deep thought; then he returned to the other room, where Gerard still lay in a heavy sleep. Grenville bent over him; once more gazed at the fine features, the bare throat, with its singular mark half hidden under the thick, clustering hair, and then he took up the neck-tie that lay on each side, as it had been loosened from the neck, and drew it round the white throat. It was a terrible temptation; one strong, momentary pull, one pressure on the heaving, beating veins and arteries, and that hated rival would be thrust from his path, the breath of life stopped, the heart silenced for ever. Frederick Grenville's pulses throbbed violently, yet seemed to stop beating in that awful struggle, not between crime and conscience, but between expediency and safety. The thought that no one could prove, no one witness a death so natural, acted like a tempting demon; and then the remembrance of Ronald's last words, "One noose shall hold us both," arrested the hand that already held the murderous means of death, and he dropped the scarf from his hand, and turned hastily away.</p>
               <p>"Let him live," he murmured; "it will perhaps be a greater punishment and slower death, and there will probably be other and safer means. Bah! a Grenville a murderer! As that rascal said, it does not sound well. No, that is the work of meaner hands."</p>
               <p>Extinguishing the lights, the young officer entered his own bedroom; and, thanks to the potation he had imbibed, was soon heavily asleep.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
               <p>AFTER the departure of the Carltons from Ireland a degree of gloom fell over the neighborhood of Bally Adams. Fanny drooped silently but visibly, even though her sister strove to sustain her with the hope that Gerard would find out, when absent from her, that his rejection of their father's advances had been a mistake dictated by momentary pride and resentment, and that long before the period fixed by their respective parents he would return to ask her forgiveness, and claim the fulfilment of the promise that Mr. Adams had made. But as the gloomy months of Winter wore on, and the unusual inclemency of the weather prevented even their usual intercourse with their neighbors, Fanny's depression of mind and body increased, and even the bright and high-spirited Norah could scarcely resist the gloom that hung over the whole household. William had not got over the disappointment of his hopes with respect to Mabel May, and avoided as much as possible his former confidential intercourse with the sisters, who were associated in his mind with the beautiful girl who had so fascinated him, while their father, who had never obtained the slightest clue to the stolen property, and became daily more uneasy as to the fate of the thousand pounds dependent on the missing bond, was even more irascible and unreasonable than usual. The time now approached when his doubts would be to a great extent confirmed or removed by the result of his application for the second quarter's interest for the loan.</p>
               <p>It was the first day that the roads were passable through the heavy snow that had fallen for some days previously, when Mr. Adams once more mounted Black Jack, and set off on his cheerless expedition to Garron's Hill. The whole house and domain appeared still more desolate and neglected than it had done on his last visit. Not only was the snow lying thick and unswept on the half thicket-covered paths, and the leafless trees beating unheeded their untrained boughs against the roof and dirty glass windows of the house, but the shutters in most of the rooms were closed, and the front door bolted and barred, as Adams perceived on receiving a reply to the loud peal which summoned a servant to admit him on his arrival.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Guildford at home?" demanded Adams.</p>
               <p>"No, sir, he is gone to Dublin," said the servant; "he went last week."</p>
               <p>"When do you expect him back?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Can't say, your honor; we send all letters to Mr. Styles, the lawyer, to send on to the justice, and maybe he knows more than we do, if your honor likes to go and ax him."</p>
               <p>It was a cheerless day, and not a very inviting prospect; for Adams had but small faith either in the power or the willingness of the lawyer to assist him in the matter; there appeared, however, no alternative but to adopt the suggestion, or lose all hope of the money. And thus, in the teeth of a keen east wind, and with constant expectation that even sure-footed Black Jack might come down at every step he made in the slippery road, the unlucky owner of Bally Adams took his way to Carlow. Styles was at home; and, what was more surprising, he was quite sober, and his sitting-room was in a state of tolerable neatness. He received his visitor with a degree of courtesy that somewhat raised the drooping spirits of the applicant for advice.</p>
               <p>"What can I have the pleasure of doing for Mr. Adams?" said he. "Any little advice or assistance in legal matters I should be most happy to give; and as Mr. Crouch is away, perhaps—"</p>
               <p>"Stop a bit, Mr. Styles," interrupted Adams. "It is a very simple matter I'm come about; I only want a plain answer to a plain question—nothing to do with Mr. Crouch or the law either. I want to know whether you have got any money for me."</p>
               <p>"For you, Mr. Adams!" said Styles, with well acted surprise. "I should as soon expect the Lord Lieutenant to come to me for a loan, as Adams of Bally Adams; and a poor lawyer like myself would have poor chance of—"</p>
               <p>"Stuff and nonsense, man!" said Adams. "You know well enough what I mean. Has Mr. Guildford left you the quarter's interest of my money that I lent him?"</p>
               <p>"Oh—ah—I see," said Styles. "But come, it's a cold day,—take a glass of grog, Mr. Adams, and we'll talk over the matter."</p>
               <p>"Not a drop," said Adams, impatiently.</p>
               <p>"I never drink before dinner. Just answer my question, if you please—have you got my money?"</p>
               <p>"Well really I cannot say that I have any money from Mr. Guildford for you or any one else, Mr. Adams," replied Styles; "but of course, as his agent and lawyer, and as I drew up the bond of which, I presume, you speak, I shall not hesitate to pay you on production of the bond in question."</p>
               <p>"Hem! Well, I don't happen to have it about me," said Adams. "But surely as you drew it up and—"</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Mr. Adams," interrupted the lawyer; "I don't of course doubt your word for an instant, but business can only be conducted in one way. I cannot of course tell that the money has not been repaid, and the bond cancelled. Bring me the bond to-morrow, or any other time, and I will at once pay the interest due."</p>
               <p>"This is certainly acting with great caution, Mr. Styles," said Adams. "However, as I cannot force you to give what I must say is my due, I will take an opportunity of producing the bond, or, I suppose Mr. Guildford will not be so precise, as he knows well the money is still unpaid. How long will he remain in Dublin?"</p>
               <p>"He leaves that city to-morrow, I believe," replied Styles; "but his road lies quite another way than Athy. He's going to England."</p>
               <p>"To England?" said the bewildered Adams; "and pray why should he go to England at this particular time?"</p>
               <p>"And pray, why not!" asked Styles; "what should prevent him?"</p>
               <p>"Then—why—there is my bond just due, and other difficulties hanging over him, if I understand rightly," replied Adams.</p>
               <p>"My good sir, said Styles," laughing, "do you really think a man of Mr. Guildford's position would alter his plan to pay you a few pounds on a particular day? I do not doubt he has important business in London; but of course, I am not at liberty to speak of my clients's affairs."</p>
               <p>"Nor to pay his just debts!" exclaimed Adams, now worked into a towering passion; "but I'll have my money; I'm not to be trifled with and laughed at by a fraudulent sharper and a pettifogging lawyer, and if it cost half my fortune, I'd punish him—ay, and you'll see I will too."</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha! a very good joke, Mr. Adams," said the lawyer. "I think I see my client put in jail for a debt which you appear unable to prove! It will be more likely that you may find yourself there for libel and false speaking. And if you take my advice, you'll keep your tongue in better bounds, and wait a gentleman's convenience for your beggarly bond."</p>
               <p>Styles rose, with a very significant gesture that Adams thought it better to obey; so he rushed from the room, and re-mounted his<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6520-00000051"/> horse with a rapidity and energy that only most powerful excitement could have given to his sixty-five years. He gradually cooled down, however, as he trotted along; indeed, the freezing atmosphere was well adapted to chill both body and mind to a very safe degree of quietness. By way of sheltering himself a little from the bitter blasts of the east wind, he took his way through the wood, which, at that hour, was tolerably safe, even in his timid ideas. However, he quickened Black Jack's pace as he approached the point nearest to the Rath, and was vigorously applying both whip and spur to the half-numbed animal, when a figure suddenly appeared from behind a tree, and to his horror he recognised in the new-comer the leader of the brigands of the Rath—the redoubtable Bryant himself.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Mr. Adams," said the robber, placing himself in a position which effectually prevented Black Jack's progress.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Mr.—I really don't know your name," said Adams, his voice tremulous with its concealed terror.</p>
               <p>Oh, I have a good many names," said the brigand, "and am not particular; I answer to any of them; but Bryant will serve our turn just now. Have you been to Garron's Hill, Mr. Adams?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Adams, "and to Carlow, too. What makes you ask, Mr. Bryant?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, nothing," said he; "only of course you got your money."</p>
               <p>"My money," said Adams, angrily; "not a sixpence. He's a rogue and scoundrel, that's my opinion, and I'll be even with him yet, or my name's not Adams."</p>
               <p>"So you shall, if you're wise, and disposed to take good advice," said Bryant; "only, you see, you've never been very good friends with us poor gentlemen, Mr. Adams; and though I bear no malice, there's no reason why I should help you, while you're doing me all the harm you can."</p>
               <p>"Is it my bond you're going to give me back?" said Adams, looking rather puzzled. "I'll make it worth your while."</p>
               <p>"It's a better thing than that I'd do for you," said Bryant. "I'd get you full compensation for all your losses, and revenge besides, if you'll be ruled by me, and answer my questions truly. Now didn't a man of the name of Ryan have something to say about the justice to you?"</p>
               <p>Adams looked uneasily round. The memory of the bullet which had so nearly missed him was still present in his mind, and he felt a horror of meddling in other persons' business.</p>
               <p>"I don't know the name," he said, at last.</p>
               <p>"Pooh, pooh!" said Bryant, scornfully; "you can't play fool's tricks with me. The fellow might call himself anything else, but you know whom I mean—the man who bade you not advance money on a bad security."</p>
               <p>"You—you—why—did he tell you?" stammered Adams.</p>
               <p>"There are few things I do not know," said Bryant; "and, what is more, if that man were here, I could put him in the way of finding the true heir; and, still further, it might do you a power of good, Mr. Adams; for it would be your own fault if your daughter was not mistress of Garron's Hill before many months were over."</p>
               <p>"My daughter!" said Adams, starting; "why, you don't mean to say that young—"</p>
               <p>"Hush, hush, said Bryant, "no names," besides I'm not such a fool as to tell my secret before I've made my conditions. What you have to do, is to get hold of that same man, if you can, and find what money is necessary, and then the matter will be easy and simple enough."</p>
               <p>"But I don't know where he is," said Adams; "and, moreover, I've lost too much already to venture money on a doubtful business like that. How do I know that it is true, or that you have proof enough to bring home the charge and establish the right heir?"</p>
               <p>"You can please yourself, Mr. Adams," said Bryant, carelessly. "I have no interest in deceiving you, for I don't want to touch a sixpence myself till the thing is proved, and then I shall of course claim my share. But, I tell you plainly, you are a fool, Mr. Adams, if you disregard my offer, and do not at once communicate with Ryan at the place he told you; ay, and bring him back at once, that I may put him on the right track."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, Mr. Bryant I must say you speak fair enough," said poor Adams, shaking with both cold and fright, till his teeth chattered again; "but you see, I am a cautious man, and like to think over matters before I act; and my son William is my heir, and I think it right to consult him, and—"</p>
               <p>"Like other cowards, lose more by delay than you would risk for half a county," said Bryant scornfully, "But I will humor you so far only, that you shall have twenty-four hours to make up your mind; and then, if you are wise, you will do as I desire you."</p>
               <p>"But if you know so much," said Adams, somewhat re-assured by the prospect of delay, "why don't you act without this man? I don't see how he can help you at all, as he doesn't seem half as wise as yourself in the affair."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I have my reasons," said the brigand, carelessly. "Have you never heard of the cat's-paw, Mr. Adams? and can't you understand that it might be safe for one man to do what would be another man's ruin. I can give the very information that Ryan is hunting for, and put him in possession of facts, without which he cannot do the slightest good; but then he is less in danger by striking the last blow, which must be done before the thing is accomplished, your money restored, and your daughter made one of the ladies of the county. Now do as you like; I can find him myself, I dare say, without your help."</p>
               <p>"Oh no, I will find him—yes, I will —only you won't bring my name in the question said Adams, hurriedly. "You see, I am so well known; and having a position to maintain—"</p>
               <p>"Don't disturb yourself; no one shall know that some of your remaining gold went to bring back the rest," said Bryant, laughing scornfully; "and hark ye! don't let the other go to sleep, lest something might be suspected; besides, the longer we keep Guildford out of the way, the better for our plans; and he wont be very anxious to come back in this hornet's nest of creditors. I'll be here in a week from this time to know if you have had any answer."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, I'll see to it," said Adams hurriedly, glad to escape from his dangerous companion. "But I must be going now; they'll look for me at home; and—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, I've no further business with you at present, and I wish you a pleasant ride, Mr. Adams," said the brigand, disappearing as suddenly as he had started up in the path of the bewildered Adams.</p>
               <p>It was not only the natural horror of the Robber of the Rath which confused the farmer's faculties; the hints he had given, which could only be interpreted as belonging to Gerard Carlton; the promise he had held which bid fair to carry out his most cherished schemes, were all too tempting to be disregarded. But then, on the other hand, there was the danger of such active interference with a revengeful man like Guildford, and a scheming, deep villain like the lawyer Styles; and then Bryant's vexation and disappointment were not to be lightly dared. Yet on the whole, he determined to risk the danger, which could be, after all, but a trifling one, if Bryant could be trusted, and lend his best efforts towards bringing the swindling justice to punishment, always supposing that William agreed in the views he took of the matter.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
               <p>WEEKS had lengthened into months, and Gerard Carlton was now in the full whirl of duty and pleasure, with scarcely time, and certainly not inclination, to pause to consider, ere he plunged irrevocably into the whirlpool which was gradually sweeping him into its giddy vortex. Day after day found him either by the side of Adeline Rivers, or in some of the gay scenes to which Grenville introduced him; and day after day he plunged yet deeper into the depths of passion and of debt. Still, he drowned every uneasy twinge of conscience, or apprehension for the consequences of this thoughtless career, by all the usual arts that minister to self-deception in such cases. His salary would soon be due, and then his debts, once discharged, he would break off the habits which he had contracted, and live within his income; a change which would be more easy to accomplish from the circumstance that Grenville expected to exchange shortly into another regiment, which was quartered away from London. So much for the pecuniary part of his involvements; and, for the rest, did he really love beautiful Adeline Rivers? Had he really forgotten her to whom he had sworn unchanging love and fidelity, even though separated from her for ever? He scarcely could have answered the question himself; he only knew that his only hours of real pleasure were passed at Adeline's side; that her smile was his sunshine, and that the sight of a rival for her attention was intolerably galling to him; and therefore he presumed that he must be in love; and Grenville took every opportunity of adding to this intoxication by showing off Adeline's beauty and accomplishments, and letting Gerard see the admiration they excited whenever she appeared in public.</p>
               <p>Gerard could not, however, but remark the very secluded life the mother and daughter usually led. Except himself, Grenville, Reginald Saville, and one or two others, he had rarely met any one at their house, although he gathered from casual allusions they let fall, that they had formerly mixed much in society, and that it was from deference to Lord Hargrave's wishes that Adeline was not taken more into the gay world.</p>
               <p>"His lordship still hopes that matters may come round between her and Frederick," Mrs. Rivers whispered to Gerard one day, with a significant glance at the cousins, who were looking at a new song Grenville had brought with him; "but I may say there is less chance than ever of such an event, though of course it would be very agreeable to me."</p>
               <p>"What a different tone from Mabel's!" soliloquised Gerard, as he walked slowly from the house. "Mrs. Rivers is a noble-hearted, disinterested mother, anxious of course for her daughter's establishment, but more so for her real happiness. I am a perverse idiot to let one thought of the girl who scorned the obscure, penniless lover, who would have given his life for her, come between me and so lovely and winning a creature. It is simple insanity, and yet I cannot resolve to put the last hopeless bar between myself and the only woman I shall ever really love. But I must do something soon; I cannot trifle longer with her; either I must cease going to the house, or speak. And yet what have I to offer her?—debts, an income that does not suffice for myself: a pretty prospect for Lord Hargrave's niece, and one who is—what? Oh, mother, mother, you are wrong to keep me in ignorance of my real birth! Did I know my origin, I would take my place accordingly. Now I float on life, like a stray weed, without place or promise, only tolerated<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6520-00000052"/> ated by accident by those who may be my superiors, or—"</p>
               <p>A proud curl of his haughty lip showed the bitter mortification which the bare idea of his possible inferiority to those among whom he was mingling produced to his high spirit.</p>
               <p>While Gerard was indulging these many speculations a discussion of a somewhat similar character, yet in a widely different spirit was going on in the pretty drawing-room he had just left.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Rivers pleaded fatigue and went to bed the moment Gerard had taken his leave, and Grenville and Adeline were alone. The girl had thrown herself into a large easy-chair with an expression of weariness and dejection, very different from the bright vivacity she had exhibited but a few moments before. She did not even look towards her companion, but carelessly leaning her head on her hand seemed almost unconscious of his presence. Grenville stood carelessly leaning against the chimneypiece gazing at the fair creature who seemed to gain a fresh charm from every fresh mood, and who looked almost more beautiful in the careless dejection and unconscious grace of her present attitude than in her more brilliant moments.</p>
               <p>"Adeline," said he.</p>
               <p>She started, and looked languidly up. "Well," said she, half impatiently.</p>
               <p>"It is some time since we have had an opportunity like this," continued Grenville. "I almost began to think you avoided being alone with me."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I did," she replied, carelessly.</p>
               <p>"May I ask why, Adeline?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly; but I am not bound to answer," she said, in the same tone.</p>
               <p>Grenville hesitated, but only from a momentary indecision in his own mind, whether to humor or to humble at once the wayward spirit that he knew must bend to his. He sat down by her, and tried to take her hand, but she snatched it away.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, Adeline, this is very absurd." he said, half pettishly, half with the soothing tone with which he would have checked the caprices of a child. "You are pretty enough to be excused for all your little perversities; but I want to talk reasonably with you just now. So I will beg you to reserve these charming little coquetries for more convenient times. They are very bewitching in their way, but not always appropriate to the occasion."</p>
               <p>Adeline's eyes flashed angrily, as she replied, "I remember the time when you dared not have questioned any of my proceedings or moods, Captain Grenville, and I am not inclined to give you the right now."</p>
               <p>"Oh, time alters everything, my pretty Adeline," said he; "and though it has not changed my admiration for your lovely self, it has considerably modified my views as to our respective relations and duties; you will therefore naturally understand that it may affect, in a trifling degree, my idea of what is desirable between us."</p>
               <p>"I understand that you are a heartless, cold—"</p>
               <p>"Hush, hush! pretty one," interrupted Grenville; "such hard words are not becoming such soft lips, and they are both soft and warm, as I well know. Come, one kiss for old times' sake, Adeline. You know we can still be good friends, though I may not be able to carry out the intentions I once had. You have another lover, and a very handsome and devoted one: you ought to thank me for the introduction."</p>
               <p>"Do I!—ought I!" she exclaimed, passionately; "ought I to thank you for forcing me to degradation, to be a heartless actress, striving to entrap one who is too good and noble, and true-hearted, for such as me, even had I a heart to give him in exchange for his? Oh, Fred! what a miserable life you have doomed me to! I am so hard. so desolate! I do not love you now; that is over forever. I despise—I almost hate you. But my very nature seems scorched, hard, and dry; I have no power to throw off your hateful chains, or to cast myself on the generosity and love of one more worthy of trust. If I had but met him sooner, I might have been so different, so—"</p>
               <p>"Heyday! what is all this fit of high-flown romance for?" said Grenville, scornfully. "It seems to me that you are somewhat in love with that handsome young simpleton, since he can bring a sensible girl like you, who ought to be complete mistress of him and herself, so entirely to his feet. Why, it is enough condescension for you to smile on such a greenhorn."</p>
               <p>"Green! ah, in comparison with such a withered, hard nature as yours," said Adeline, bitterly; "but for you, I might have been all you say. I know I am gifted by nature; but you, like a fiend, have turned all into curses."</p>
               <p>"Thank you," said Grenville; "when you have done your heroics, you will perhaps listen to a little common sense. I want to tell you that matters must soon be brought to a crisis. It is impossible for me to go on as I have done. In plain English I am going to be married, and you must follow my example."</p>
               <p>"You!" exclaimed Adeline.</p>
               <p>There was scorn and pain in the tone which Grenville too well understood, and a sharp, quick, twitching of the features showed that he was not quite insensible to the bitter contempt it expressed.</p>
               <p>"And why not, may I ask?" he said, trying to laugh off his annoyance.</p>
               <p>"Because you are not capable of making a wife happy, nor of supporting one," she replied; "and what is more, because I could stop such a marriage at any moment, and you know it."</p>
               <p>"Pooh, pooh, Adeline! don't be always harping on that old story," said Grenville. "You cannot complain of my conduct towards you. I have enabled you to live in comfort and luxury, to my own serious damage, and now I have provided for your happiness by a most suitable marriage. If you will be wise, no one will know that the wife of Gerard Carlton, Lord Hargrave's <foreign xml:lang="FRA">protegé</foreign>, has ever been—"</p>
               <p>He stopped, for the flash of the girl's eye warned him not to go too far.</p>
               <p>"Has ever been what?" she said, sternly. "Been deceived—made hard and wretched—by the heartless treachery of Lord Hargrave's nephew? Is that what you do not wish known, Frederick Grenville?"</p>
               <p>"Nay, nay, for that matter," said he, scornfully, "it is far more for your interest than mine to keep the little episode quiet. I could soon manage to avert any bad consequences from such a disclosure; but you would be degraded, penniless, friendless, if the truth were known, and you would hardly be such a fool as to risk certain ruin."</p>
               <p>"I should not be quite helpless, neither would you escape quite so easily," said Adeline, calmly eyeing her companion's flushed face. "The hour of your desertion would be the hour of your certain punishment, though I will not condescend to threaten till the right moment comes for me to punish. But enough of this idle recrimination. Who is the person you are going to marry?—or whom you fancy you are going to marry?"</p>
               <p>"You do not know her," replied Grenville. "She is only just come to London with her father. I knew her in Dublin."</p>
               <p>"And has she accepted you?" asked Adeline.</p>
               <p>"Well, I have not asked her in so many words," replied Grenville; "but it is perfectly certain. You need not disturb yourself by any foolish doubts; I am not often baulked in my plans, as you know. But that is not the question. What you have to do is to bring Carlton to the point, and I will give you every chance in my power of doing so. I only want your promise to accept him at once, before bringing matters to a crisis, and I pledge myself that he shall propose to you before this month is out, if you engage on your part to accept his offer, and marry him, before he can change his mind."</p>
               <p>"Or discover the truth," said Adeline, bitterly.</p>
               <p>A silence ensued, during which Grenville sat watching the half-concealed face of the girl with a calm, triumphant expression, that said plainly he anticipated the complete success of his plans. But he could not see the gradual change from the wan, sharp agony that her features had expressed during their bitter debate, to a firm, resolved, stern look, that betokened her determination was taken, and not to be afterwards repented. When she at last turned her beautiful face towards him it was calm, and her large eyes had lost their brightness.</p>
               <p>"Be it so," she said. "Take your way, and I will take mine, since it is your pleasure that they should henceforth be different. I only stipulate to know the name of the fortunate bride of Lord Hargrave's heir."</p>
               <p>"It is a foolish fancy of yours, Adeline; but as you are now reasonable, I must even gratify it," said Grenville—"it is Mabel May, the daughter of one of the rich and successful speculators in American land. He has just returned, after some years' absence, and of course intends to get a peerage for his daughter, who, by the way, has about six hundred a year of her own from an old great aunt, which is no despicable thing."</p>
               <p>"And what reason have you to suppose she will choose the presumptive heir of Lord Hargrave to any other of the peers eligible for such a prize?" asked Adeline, sarcastically.</p>
               <p>"Oh, do not be alarmed for me, fair lady," replied Grenville. "I have no reason to doubt my success. I am not accustomed to women's ways for nothing; and I am as secure of Mabel May—ay, and more so, than you can be of Gerard Carlton. A charming quartette, eh, my pretty Adeline?" he added, mockingly; "only it might not be safe to become too intimate, for fear of the proverbial 'gossip and tea' between the happy wives."</p>
               <p>Adeline was evidently determined on preserving her self-control, but her lips paled a little as she smiled her reply to the jest.</p>
               <p>"And is it to come off soon, Fred?" she asked, averting her face.</p>
               <p>"Oh, a brief wooing is to my taste," he replied; "and it will perhaps affect my professional arrangements a little, as well as my private ones. In a few days you may expect to hear of my 'happiness,'—is not that the word?—and then a few weeks will settle the rest. Suppose we make yours the same day, Adeline?"</p>
               <p>Her dark eyes flashed like sudden flame, and her fair cheeks crimsoned with the rich hot blood as if a quick strong heat had thawed the current, and sent it gushing through the veins.</p>
               <p>"Take care, Captain Grenville, lest I remember too well another day that you might wish forgotten," said Adeline.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, lovely Amazon, let there he peace between us," said Grenville. "If we cannot control fate, we must bend to it; but I confess I never shall see a woman as much to my taste as yourself, and I would willingly give up a few hundreds a year if you could be substituted for Mabel May. And now that we understand each other I must be off."</p>
               <p>He endeavored to pass his arm round her, but she shrank indignantly from his touch, and a hot flush rose to his forehead at the action.</p>
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6520-00000053"/>
               <p>"Nay, Adeline," said he, "I am a wild fellow, I grant, and a selfish one, too; but the best part in me is my love for you; and I can't quite crush that out of my heart, though I would do so if I could. But I have no choice but to act as I am doing; and we must even make the best of it."</p>
               <p>Adeline looked up in his face; there was a quivering of the lip and a moisture in his eyes that spoke of honest if transient agitation. But her pride had been too deeply wounded for such sudden healing.</p>
               <p>"I have no wishes, no regrets," she said, haughtily. "I have given you the assurance you ask—leave me in peace."</p>
               <p>Grenville looked at her for a moment, in half-questioning sadness, and then walked silently from the room.</p>
               <p>"She is a fine creature," he murmured; "but it is useless to think of anything now but my own interests—nay, my own safety."</p>
               <p>He walked rapidly home to his rooms, where his servant was waiting for him, and his first question was, "Any one called?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, only Mr. Beaumont's servant with a note. He wanted an answer, sir; but I told him you would not be in till late."</p>
               <p>"Very well," said his master. "I shall not want you again."</p>
               <p>The man bowed and retired, and Grenville opened the note. It ran thus:—</p>

               <p>Grenville smiled as he closed the brief billet; but still the thoughtful look which he had on leaving Adeline did not pass away, and he sat long in moody thought before retiring to rest.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
               <p>IT was scarcely more than nine o'clock on the following morning when Gerard Carlton entered Grenville's bedroom.</p>
               <p>"Halloo, Carlton!" he exclaimed; "why, what's up, to make you call a fellow up in the midst of the night; death or marriage, at least?"</p>
               <p>"Not exactly," replied Gerard: "but something that concerns me almost as nearly just now. I'm in a deuce of a scrape."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" said Grenville; "what's the matter? Adeline refused you, or—"</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Grenville; don't be a fool!" exclaimed Gerard. "Look here!" he said, holding out a note to the half-sleeping Grenville, who saw at a glance it was from Saville. It ran thus:—</p>

                           <p>"DEAR CARLTON,—I am really vexed to touch on anything unpleasant with a friend like yourself, but I am rather hard up, and must trouble you for the trifle you owe me, for which I have your I O. U., by Thursday next. Excuse my adding that I cannot do any longer without it, and trust you will neither be inconvenienced by the little demand, nor oblige me to enforce it.</p>

               </q>
               <p>"Well, my good fellow," said Grenville, "I suppose you must cash up, that's all.</p>
               <p>"It's easy to say so," said Gerard; "but suppose I can't?"</p>
               <p>"Well, then, I'm afraid Saville's very much the man to keep his word," replied Grenville, quietly.</p>
               <p>"Then I'm in a confounded fix," said Gerard, turning pale. "I tell you what it is, Grenville, I have not a sovereign left in the world till my salary comes in, and then it's pretty well forestalled. I've been a confounded idiot to put myself in such a deuced scrape, and I don't see what's before me but a prison and ruin for life."</p>
               <p>"Won't Mrs. Carlton stump up if you ask her?" said Grenville.</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't be such a sneaking thief as to rob my mother of her little pittance!" said the young man, fiercely. "Why, it's more than her whole year's income, and I have already had more than was my due out of her small savings. No, I'd rather blow my brains out."</p>
               <p>"I don't see the necessity of such summary proceedings," said Grenville coolly. "Still, it's an awkward business, and I'm hard up myself, or I'd willingly help you. I was going to ask you for the trifle due to me in a day or two, till I could go to my uncle again, with any decent chance of success. 'Pon my soul, I don't know what to advise."</p>
               <p>Carlton sat down and buried his head in his hands. It was a new distress to him, and doubly alarming, from his complete inexperience in such matters, and his natural horror of the unknown depths of ruin into which he was sinking. His mother's extreme strictness in all such matters, his knowledge of the narrowness of her own means, his complete isolation from any friends or relatives who might be willing or able to assist him, and the inevitable ruin to his present position and future prospects, overwhelmed him with despair; and the threatened attempt on the brains which had served him so ill in this instance, was not altogether an idle one in his present mood, when Grenville's voice startled him from his gloomy abstraction.</p>
               <p>"I can only think of one, plan to save you, my dear fellow," said he. "What do you say the amount of your debt to Saville is?"</p>
               <p>"Two hundred," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"And you owe me a trifling fifty or so," said Grenville. "Now if you like to accept a bill for that amount, and get some responsible name to it, or even without that, I think I could put you in the way of getting it discounted—say at two months or so."</p>
               <p>"And pray how am I to meet it at the end of that time, Grenville?" he asked, gloomily. "What good would it be to put off the evil, only to burst more helplessly on me at last? Besides, I cannot be such a rogue as to undertake liabilities that I cannot possibly meet."</p>
               <p>"And yet you have done so," said Grenville, significantly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have," said Gerard, wincing under the taunt. "I have been a fool and shall appear to others a villain, but I will not plunge deeper into rascality. I dare say you meant well, Grenville, but I begin to curse the day I saw you, and began this fatal career."</p>
               <p>"Thank you," said Grenville; "it is generally the case when people get into scrapes they throw the blame on other people; but I can excuse it, having had some taste of such pleasant predicaments myself at times. But to show you I am really a friend, I will stretch every point to serve you. I think, if you will do as I suggest, my influence might procure you the money for three months, and long before, you may, if you are not a simpleton, have Adeline and her fortune, too, at your disposal, which I take it would be rather pleasanter than a prison, or the little alternative you hinted at so glibly."</p>
               <p>"And drag her into ruin!" exclaimed Gerard, indignantly. "No, no, Grenville; if I can't live on my pay, certainly I cannot expect to do so with a wife, even with the addition of her fortune. No Grenville," he added, more seriously, "I will rather suffer the worst penalty of my folly than drag a beautiful and trusting girl down with me."</p>
               <p>"Then you reject my proposal?" said Grenville. "Very well; I am sorry for you; but, really, if you had made up your mind to this heroic self-denial, you need not have waked me from my comfortable snooze. I'm not a fellow to turn a cold shoulder to a friend in trouble; but if you won't be helped, it is not my fault."</p>
               <p>"If I thought—if there were any prospect—" said Gerard, doubtingly.</p>
               <p>"My dear fellow, what may not happen in three months?" said Grenville. "My uncle has decidedly taken you by the hand; Adeline is over head and ears in love; and, besides, you are a lucky fellow, and I prophesy you will come in for some strange strokes of fortune even yet."</p>
               <p>The words sounded with singular meaning in the excited young man's ears. That there was a mystery about his birth and destiny was certain, and Grenville's unconscious allusion to his secret speculations and wild misgivings, seemed almost prophetic at that moment of despair, when the slightest spark of light was eagerly exaggerated into glaring sunshine.</p>
               <p>"If I could only take the same view of it that you do, Grenville," he said, doubtfully, "you may suppose I should catch at your offer. 'Tis a horrid thing for a fellow, scarcely of age, to feel completely done up for life, and what's a hundred times worse, to know he deserves it."</p>
               <p>"My dear fellow, it proves that you are scarcely come to years of discretion, or you could not be so scrupulous," replied Grenville, laughing. "Why, there's scarcely a man worth anything as to spirit or talent who does not begin life with a serape. The only difference between them and fools is, that they get out of the mire which the others stick in."</p>
               <p>It was with more difficulty than Grenville would have anticipated that he at last persuaded the sorely-tempted Gerard to yield to his proposal; but, as might be supposed, the prospect of relief from immediate ruin, from public disgrace, and his mother's yet more dreaded distress and shame, was too attractive to be resisted; and before he started for the office, Grenville had penned a few lines to the useful personage in question, which Gerard was to deliver in person after leaving his duty. The address was, "Mr. Blamire, Adam Street, Adelphi," and the open note warmly and earnestly recommended the bearer to the said gentleman's trust and good offices as an especial friend of Captain Grenville's.</p>
               <p>"And I say," Carlton, continued Grenville, "no doubt Warren, the head of your department at the Custom House would back the bill, for he knows your money must be soon due, and he has got you safe enough."</p>
               <p>Gerard half-hesitatingly assented, and left his friend with a lightened heart, though his better judgment rebelled against the course he was pursuing.</p>
               <p>The hours passed slowly enough for Carlton till four o'clock arrived to free him from his duty, and hastily calling a boat, he offered the man double fare to row him up to Adam Street with all possible speed. Wind and tide were for once favorable (a lucky omen, as he tried to suppose,) and in less than half an hour he was standing before the door, which bore a large brass-plate, with the name of "Richard Blamire, Accountant and General Agent, and Bill-Broker."</p>
               <p>A large swing-door admitted Gerard to the interior of the mystic regions, where so many met their fate for good or ill, and Gerard found himself in an outer apartment without carpet or matting, the sole occupant of which was a tall, spare man, in a threadbare suit of black, seated at desk, on a high stool, and bending over his writing rather with an habitual stoop than the necessary inclination of the body for his employment.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Blamire at home?" asked Gerard.</p>
               <p>The tall man glanced at the fashionably-dressed, handsome young man who asked the question, and descended from his elevation.</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6520-00000054"/>
               <p>"I'll see, sir," said he.</p>
               <p>Carlton rightly supposed that this proceeding indicated that the arbiter of his present fate was in his own sanctum, and that the inquiry related rather to his willingness than his power to give him an interview.</p>
               <p>"Say that a gentleman from Captain Grenville wishes to see him," continued Gerard.</p>
               <p>A few moments brought the desired answer, "Please to walk this way, sir."</p>
               <p>Carlton would have been amused at a less anxious moment with the difference, not only between the apartments of the master and servant, but the very opposite personal appearance of the two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blamire's room was furnished with a rich Turkey carpet, a substantial library table, handsome leather chairs, and a sideboard which looked more like a receptacle for creature comforts than of business documents. Mr. Blamire himself was a sleek, well-dressed, bland-looking man, with an oily voice, and mildly impressive manner.</p>
               <p>"I have the pleasure of seeing a friend of Captain Grenville's—one of my most respected clients," he said. "What can I have the pleasure of doing for you, sir?"</p>
               <p>Carlton presented the note by way of introduction.</p>
               <p>"I see,—I see," continued Mr. Blamire; "some little temporary difficulty, often occurring with young men of fashion. Soon got over, no doubt. But what is the amount, and what have you to propose?"</p>
               <p>"The amount I want to raise is two hundred and fifty," replied Gerard. "I was told by Captain Grenville that it might be managed by a bill at three months, with a good name at the back, and at proper interest."</p>
               <p>"Three months!" said the bland man, with an astonished smile. "Captain Grenville has a most flattering idea of my powers and my wealth to think of such a thing. And money is so scarce—so very tight just now, and my clients so numerous already, that I fear—"</p>
               <p>"You cannot do it then?" said Gerard, impatiently. "I would not have asked it, had I—"</p>
               <p>"Stop, my dear sir, stop," said Mr. Blamire, "You are not used to business, I can see; we must be cautious before entering on an affair of this kind—but still, I have so great a respect for Captain Grenville, that—What security do you propose, did you say?"</p>
               <p>"The name of the chief of my department in the Customs, Mr. Warren, at the back of the bill," said Gerard; "and—"</p>
               <p>"Any post obits—have you expectations, my dear sir?" interrupted the money-lender. "A young man of your appearance will surely have some property in prospect."</p>
               <p>"I shall inherit my mother's income of about two hundred per annum," replied Gerard, coloring; "but I should be very sorry to count on what I hope is a very distant reversion."</p>
               <p>"Ha! very proper, quite so," said the usurer. "But you see, Mr. Carlton, under such circumstances we must make the interest rather heavy. I could not say less than fifty pounds for the three months; that is, I must make the bill three hundred, and then, if you get the name of the gentleman in question, and I find all right with regard to him, why then, as you seem a gentleman of such undoubted station and honor, why, I must try to see what can be done for you."</p>
               <p>Carlton sat aghast. "Fifty pounds!" he exclaimed; "it is extortionate, Mr. Blamire; it is one-fifth of the sum I want."</p>
               <p>"Can't help it, my dear sir," said Mr. Blamire; "you can of course please yourself, but it's the only terms on which I can do it, and that's only as a favor to your friend, I can assure you; it's a great risk and difficulty to me, and I'd rather be without it, I assure you," he added, waving his hands gracefully, in token of dismissal of the subject.</p>
               <p>Carlton half rose to go; the enormous amount of the bonus was beyond all he could have calculated on, and he felt that any alternative would be preferable to such terms.</p>
               <p>"Take time, my dear sir, take time to consider," said the money lender, who, with professional quickness, detected the struggle in his mind. "I've only one rule in these transactions," he added, "and I never vary; but still, I never go from my word, and if you like to come again to-morrow, or the next day, with the little bill in question, I shall be happy to take it and do what I have stated; always supposing that I find everything correct and straightforward, and that you give me your own separate bond to pay any possible deficiency out of the money which I doubt not I shall find you are entitled to on your respected mother's death."</p>
               <p>Gerard again hesitated; but the rapid consideration of every possible means to which he could resort to free himself from his difficulties, soon showed him, as it had done before, that no hope existed of escaping instant exposure and ruin, but in the offer just made to him. And, as Grenville had said, "What might not occur in three months?"</p>
               <p>"You are very good, Mr. Blamire," he said, after a few moments' pause; "but, though I do not affect to conceal that I think your terms most enormously extortionate, I am so situated that I have scarcely a choice in the matter. When can I have the money?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am a man of action, my dear sir, action and promptness," he replied. "Give me the name of the gentleman, and of your excellent mother's solicitor, and to-morrow, if all is satisfactory, I will be ready for you."</p>
               <p>"But I should not like any hint of the matter to go abroad," said Carlton, "especially to my mother's man of business."</p>
               <p>"My dear sir," said Mr. Blamire, with a smile of gentle superiority, "we don't do business in that way, or we should have few clients. My inquiries will be conducted more cautiously than that, and no one will have the slightest idea of their object."</p>
               <p>Carlton hastily wrote down the names, and left the office with a feeling of relief at the escape from a region that almost appeared a sort of Inferno to his inexperienced freshness of ideas.</p>
               <p>Twenty-four hours appeared a long period to look forward to, with interests of such magnitude at stake, and Carlton, feverish and uneasy, wandered out from his apartments unable to remain alone with his own uneasy thoughts, and yet with no settled purpose for his ramble. He was scarcely collected enough to meet Adeline—her quick eyes would at once have detected the disturbance and pre-occupation of his mind, and Grenville and Saville were about the last persons he wished to encounter till his present suspense was over. But still he strolled listlessly on, unconsciously turning in the direction of the fatally well-known and attractive "billiard rooms," and glancing in for a moment, saw that neither of his dreaded friends was in the room, though it was tolerably well-filled with persons, most of whom were familiar faces to him, as constant habitues of the place. He entered the bright, cheerful-looking saloon, partly it might be from habit, partly from the contrast to the darkness without, and the gloom of his own feelings.</p>
               <p>As Gerard lounged carelessly up the room, glancing at the different tables with a sort of languid interest in the games so eagerly contested, his eyes were suddenly caught by two persons seated at a small table in one of the most distant corners of the room. One of them was Major Talbot whom he had met at a dinner at Grenville's but rarely encountered since. His adversary's face was even more familiar to him, but for the moment he could not recall his name, nor where he had known him. The features were of course unchanged, but the dress, the general getting up, the very bearing, were so different from those of the Irish justice, that it was long before he could determine that the gentlemanly stylishly-dressed man, playing with Talbot, could really be Mr. Guildford of Garron's Hill. A few minutes' examination however, confirmed the idea; and when a pause in the game ensued, and the players looked up from their cards, his doubts were fully removed, for the stranger recognized him at once.</p>
               <p>"Ha! Mr. Carlton, glad to see you," said the justice. "I never happened to meet you before since I came to town, though we must have often only just missed each other I have heard of you more than once."</p>
               <p>Indeed!" returned Carlton, rather coldly.</p>
               <p>"I should not have thought such an obscure individual as myself could have occupied the attention of Mr. Guildford or his friends."</p>
               <p>"You are wrong," said Mr. Guildford; "quite too modest, my young friend. You cannot pretend to say that your and my friends, the Riverses, would not mention their constant visitor, and even Mr. Saville values your acquaintance too much not to speak of you as a most agreeable companion."</p>
               <p>Gerard was perfectly mystified; the morose, haughty justice, descending to such flattering compliments! Mr. Guildford, of Garron's Hill, a friend of the English relatives of Lord Hargrave, and never even casually alluded to by them! It was not to be intelligible by any ordinary explanation, and Gerard could not repress a not very complimentary look of surprise.</p>
               <p>"Miss Rivers!" said he; "do you know her, Mr. Guildford?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, why not, my young friend? Is she so secluded or so exalted that ordinary folks like myself must not approach her?"</p>
               <p>"No, not that," said Carlton, in some confusion; "only I never heard the Riverses mention you, and—"</p>
               <p>"Miss Rivers did not know me till very lately; but her mother and I are old friends," said Guildford, carelessly. "Now, Talbot, are you ready?"</p>
               <p>The cards were again dealt, and fortune and skill seemed both on Guildford's side. He played well and coolly, and as Talbot gradually grew impatient with his run of ill-luck, and consequently lost both skill and temper, the game was soon completely in the hands of the Irish justice, and with one decisive hit he swept the table of the heap of gold that lay on it.</p>
               <p>"I will give you your revenge another night, Major Talbot," he said, rising. "I have an engagement to-night, and cannot play any longer. Perhaps Mr. Carlton will take my place."</p>
               <p>"No, I shall not touch a card to-night," said the young man. "I only looked in for a moment, to see if Captain Grenville were here. I shall not stay any longer."</p>
               <p>"Grenville is more agreeably engaged," said Major Talbot; "did he not tell you he is dining at Mr. Beaumont's?"</p>
               <p>Gerard still looked unenlightened.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible you do not know," said Talbot, "that Grenville is laying siege to one of the prettiest heiresses of the season and a distant connection of his own? Why, you are so intimate, I thought you were in all his secrets."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps he did not want his game spoiled," laughed Guildford. "A handsome young fellow like our friend here is not always a convenient confidant in such cases, especially when he happens to know the young lady previously."</p>
               <p>"I!" exclaimed Gerard; "I do not even know the name."</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6520-00000055"/>
               <p>"Not of Beaumont," said Guildford, buttoning up his pockets, and taking up his hat; "but you know that of the daughter, nevertheless, or my memory or yours is strangely treacherous."</p>
               <p>He left the room as he spoke, and Gerard turned to Talbot for explanation.</p>
               <p>"Is not this young lady's name the same as her father's?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"No, it is May," replied Talbot. She took it from an old aunt, I fancy, who left her her little fortune on that condition. It seems, from what I hear, that old Beaumont, rich as he now is, was a poor barrister when Lady Mabel May fell in love with him; but being uncommonly handsome, and the damsel arrived at an age when eligible matches are not too plentiful, she, with some difficulty, got her own way, or rather took it without its being actually given. But one great inducement for the old lord to permit, if not consent to the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mèsalliance</foreign>, was, that his other daughter was getting both too old and ugly to have a chance of marrying, and the title and estates descended through the females to male heirs, failing direct male issue. He thought therefore that even the son of the briefless, half-penniless barrister, would be better than no grandson at all, and accordingly winked at the lady's disobedience. But as ill luck would have it, there was only a daughter of the marriage, and so after all the property and the title went to his distant cousin, your patron, Lord Hargrave. But Beaumont, after his wife's death, went off to America, leaving his daughter in her aunt's care, and now he has come back with a whole lot of Yankee dollars. It would be droll enough if the daughter were Lady Hargrave after all."</p>
               <p>Gerard had listened with a beating heart to the major's gossiping story, and when it was concluded, quietly thanked him for the "interesting genealogical explanation" of the young lady's ancestors.</p>
               <p>"Then you do know her?" said the major, keenly eyeing him.</p>
               <p>"A little; I met her in Dublin; but you will suppose not very intimately, or I should have known all this," said Gerard, bitterly.</p>
               <p>"I don't know that," replied Talbot. "I am told that Miss May was not brought up to 'honor her father' very religiously. The proud blood of the Mays rebelled against the admixture of the Beaumont's less pure stream, and I don't suppose she ever heard or cared much about her respected progenitor. But are you really off?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am not very well, and fairly hard-up into the bargain; so I have no choice," replied the young man, nodding his adieu with a smile he tried to make gay, but which was only very sarcastic.</p>
               <p>Need we describe the wretchedness, the bitter, hard feeling that possessed Gerard Carlton, as he rushed rapidly through the streets to his home. He had fancied that his love for Mabel May had been crushed by her scorn—that Adeline's more brilliant beauty and attractions had effaced the proud heiress from his heart's memory. But the first mention of her name, the bare idea of her being wooed and won by another, and that other the wild and dissipated Grenville, opened his eyes to the truth; Mabel was dear to him, nay, dearer than ever. The time which had elapsed since their separation only proved how deep, how hopeless was an attachment that could not be cured, either by her contemptuous rejection, or the society of one who possessed every attraction that could win the heart of man, and who had given every encouragement to his attentions that a proud and delicate woman could do.</p>
               <p>Poor Gerard! he dwelt, in the very waywardness of an overburdened spirit, on the perverse hardness of his lot. Two women, both fair—one singularly good and gentle, the other gifted beyond her sex—would have gladly accepted and returned the love which he bestowed on an ungrateful, heartless coquette; and yet, he could neither throw off her fetters, nor resolve to bind himself to his, which would make the indulgence of his love for Mabel a sin to himself, a cruelty to another.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the episode of the evening had one good effect on our unlucky here. It deadened his uneasiness on the score of his, pecuniary troubles, and made him most enviably indifferent as to the consequences of his little transactions with the cautious and crafty Mr. Blamire.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
               <p>ON the evening of Gerard Carlton's rencontre with Mr. Guildford at the gambling house, two gentlemen were sitting over a luxurious dessert, in the handsome dining-room of one of the largest houses in Park Lane. One of them was Frederick Grenville, the other a very handsome man, of somewhat more than middle-age, but wearing his years remarkably well, both in face and figure. There was a singular resemblance between him and his daughter, in features and complexion, even in the style of figure and bearing, so far as was possible in different sexes. But there the likeness ended.</p>
               <p>Mabel May's intellectual, calm, high-bred expression, was very different from the keen, restless, uneasy look which her father's countenance wore, and there was also this point of difference between them, that while the aristocratic appearance and bearing of the father appeared to a practised observer, rather an accident of nature, the high-bred grace and unconscious dignity of the girl were evidently innate, and pervaded not only her physical, but mental nature. Every look, and tone, and gesture of Mabel May was in keeping with her birth and her outward beauty; and but Mr. Beaumont's bearing and manner, even casual expressions, betrayed at times that the position he held was rather an adventitious one than a birthright. None could better appreciate all this than Grenville, who, with all his failings, was essentially a gentleman: but it did not suit him to confess that the father of his intended bride had any of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parvenu</foreign> in his composition.</p>
               <p>"Well; then you have hinted the matter to your uncle?" said Mr. Beaumont, as he pushed the rare claret to his guest.</p>
               <p>"I did inform Lord Hargrave of my hopes and wishes," said the young man, with an audible stress on the title which Mr. Beaumont had so familiarly ignored.</p>
               <p>"And he had no objection, I presume?" said Mr. Beaumont.</p>
               <p>"Scarcely an objection," replied the young man; "but I am not quite sure that the slight coolness between the two branches of the family has quite worn off; and perhaps, had it been in his power, he might have chosen otherwise for his heir,"</p>
               <p>"Humph! I think he might remember that he <choice>
                     <sic>might might</sic>
                     <corr>might</corr>
                  </choice> never have been the heir himself but for the cursed ill-luck that gave me a daughter instead of a son," said Mr. Beaumont, and a dark look came over his handsome face, as he spoke.</p>
               <p>"Then you never had a boy, Mr. Beaumont, or did he die young?" said Grenville. "I am not very well up in these genealogical mysteries."</p>
               <p>"What makes you think I ever had a boy?" he asked sharply; a quick red flush coming over his fair skin.</p>
               <p>"Surely it is not very unlikely that where there is a daughter, there might have been also a son," said Grenville; "more especially as I have understood Lady Mabel did not die till Miss Mabel was two or three years old."</p>
               <p>"I should have been a far happier man, if it had been so," said Beaumont, recovering his composure. "But it was not my good fortune, even for a short time. Lady Mabel never had any children but my daughter of the same name."</p>
               <p>"And fair enough she is to supply the absence of a dozen," said Grenville warmly. "But to return to our subject, Mr. Beaumont; I should be sorry for you to misunderstand what I said about Lord Hargrave. He is anxious I should marry; but though fortune is no object to him, or rather to his plans for me, he still looks much for connection, and would prefer that I should bring fresh blood, and fresh alliances to the family in my marriage. But still. Miss May is so unexceptionable in point of birth and fortune, and in herself such a prize, that I am certain, not only of his consent, but his warm eagerness to receive her, when he has been once introduced to her."</p>
               <p>"Mabel is very like me, not in the least like her mother's family," remarked Mr. Beaumont.</p>
               <p>"No bad test of her beauty, my dear sir," said the young man smiling.</p>
               <p>"Well," said Beaumont, returning the smile. "I was counted tolerably good-looking in my day, and had my share of success; but that is over, and, after all, there is as much danger and annoyance as advantage for either sex to have personal attractions. However, a woman is not worse received by her husband's family from doing it credit by her beauty; and Mabel would grace the highest in the land, I must say. But, to come to business: What will your uncle do for you on your marriage? I propose giving Mabel twenty thousand pounds, and her own fortune will be enough for pin money for her; but I expect, in return, that Lord Hargrave shall settle as much again on her; and also give you an equivalent income on your marriage. On these terms I will at once arrange for your wedding."</p>
               <p>"And Miss May?" said Grenville.</p>
               <p>"Mabel will of course do what I desire," said Mr. Beaumont. "I know what is best for her happiness; my consent implies hers."</p>
               <p>From what he had seen of the heiress, Grenville had his own doubts whether she would prove as pliable as her father imagined; but he had no wish to raise difficulties in the way.</p>
               <p>"I shall do my best to make Miss May's consent voluntary," replied Grenville, lightly. "May we not join her in the drawing-room? I should like to be able to report favorably to my uncle about her disposition towards me, when I ask his consent to your proposals."</p>
               <p>Beaumont consented, and finishing his wine, he rose, and they went together to the drawing-room.</p>
               <p>It was a luxurious and tasteful room, worthy of the fair mistress who presided over it, and who, when they entered, was carelessly reclining on a couch, with some apology for work in her hands.</p>
               <p>Mabel was elegantly dressed; it was her father's pleasure that she should always make an elaborate toilette; and her beauty had never showed to more advantage than in that rich but simple attire.</p>
               <p>A pale blue silk, with rich black lace toning down its somewhat dazzling hue, white opal ornaments, and a simple white camelia in her hair, was Mabel's evening toilette on that night; and most lovely she looked as she sat in the careless attitude which could not but be graceful, from the exquisite turn of her whole figure.</p>
               <p>As the door opened, Mabel half rose, and assumed a more formal and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">posé</foreign> attitude, which is perhaps the worst compliment a woman can pay a man who is striving to win her; at once marking the line of demarcation she chooses to draw round herself.</p>
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6520-00000056"/>
               <p>Mr. Beaumont walked to a sofa at a little distance, and took up an evening newspaper. Grenville stood for a few moments watching the now busy motion of Mabel's fingers.</p>
               <p>"Miss May, you remind me that you were educated in Ireland—you are so bent on that everlasting lace-work of which they are so fond."</p>
               <p>"It is very amusing," she said, carelessly; "and often supplies the absence of better entertainment."</p>
               <p>"Thank you," said Grenville; "then that is the reason you became so much more diligent when I approached you. Well, I am naturally of so modest a disposition, that I can quite submit to the compliment, however doubtful. But I will do my best to make the fingers fall idly on the lap; it would be such a delightful tribute to my powers."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean to attempt, Captain Grenville?" said the girl, half smilingly; "there are so few subjects in common between us."</p>
               <p>"Are there not?" said he. "I do not agree with you. I flatter myself we have some tastes which are sympathetic, that we like the same things and the same people. For instance, there is an old friend of yours to whom I have taken a fancy, Gerard Carlton; you remember him in Dublin?"</p>
               <p>Mabel did not look up, but the tone of assent was careless and natural.</p>
               <p>"He is in London," continued Grenville; "and a remarkably nice fellow he is, only rather too facile I am afraid, and the world is so very new to him. He is going it a <emph>leetle</emph> too fast, unless there is more money at his banker's than I fancy."</p>
               <p>"I really know very little about Mr. Carlton's circumstances," said Mabel bending over her work.</p>
               <p>"Nor I," said Grenville; "but you know the purse is soon emptied when cards are in the case; and then there are so many outlets for money, and so many temptations to extravagance, even dissipation, in London. But if his marriage comes off, he will get right again, no doubt."</p>
               <p>"I did not know of any marriage. Is it Miss Adams of Athy that he is going to marry?" said Mabel, speaking with laudable firmness, though the needles "had not yet dropped on her lap."</p>
               <p>"Oh no; no such rustic fair one as that," replied Grenville. "The happy <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fiancée</foreign> is a very lovely and accomplished London lady, at least she is accustomed to London society, though I cannot exactly vouch for the place of her birth and baptism."</p>
               <p>"Of course, from what you say, she has fortune," said Mabel, with an attempt at a smile.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, the pretty Adeline is an heiress, though it is almost an unfair monopoly of Nature's gifts, in her case, as well as that of another I could instance," said Grenville. "But in Carlton's case one would be useless without the other, though to do him justice I believe he is very much in love."</p>
               <p>"No doubt," said Mabel; "but as Mr. Carlton's affairs by no means concern me, Captain Grenville, suppose we change the subject."</p>
               <p>Mabel's perfect self-control rather baffled the young officer, and he could scarcely decide whether the haughty carelessness of her manner arose from indifference or some deeper feeling of annoyance. He was however too wary to pursue the subject.</p>
               <p>"Miss May's wishes are my laws," said he; "but if I dare only speak on the subject nearest to my heart, and hope that it might meet more favor in her eyes, then I should find any other as wearisome as she could do."</p>
               <p>"Did I not tell you there was little sympathy between us, Captain Grenville?" said Mabel. "You will confess I am right before long. I had better take pity on you, and put an end to your fruitless attempts by something that we may perhaps both admire."</p>
               <p>Laying down her work, Mabel went to the piano and began one of Mozart's airs, which at that moment was as discordant to her listener's ears as the most grating bagpipes to Hogarth's "Enraged Musician," Mabel, that evening, carefully avoided giving Grenville an opportunity of speaking to her with the slightest appearance of confidential privacy; but when she retired to bed, after his departure, he was fully avenged by the keen suffering she was at liberty to indulge. Gerard Carlton a gambler! in debt! affianced to another, in spite of his protestations to herself, and that other not even his childhood's playmate—the gentle Fanny Adams! Better, far better have heard that he was dead, that he was poor, miserable, suffering—anything than unworthy, untrue to her, regardless of his fair and gentle mother, and to honor and principle. She almost hated Grenville for having told her such wounding tidings, and then she blamed her own folly and injustice in laying on him the sins of another, which he mentioned so kindly and so regretfully. And then her bright eyes burnt like hot flames, and her fair checks crimsoned with anger at her own weakness.</p>
               <p>"I will crush out this folly," she said. "It is only worthy of a soft, weak nature like poor Fanny's. I am one of a race that prefers honor and truth and gentle blood to wealth or idle passion. I will not be unworthy of them. There are higher things to live for than mere girlish love-sick fancies, and I must learn to take the place assigned me in the world, without sinking to the level of that unworthy idol which, in my weak folly, I thought so lofty."</p>
               <p>There was a scorn of herself in the girl's look and mien, as these thoughts passed through her mind; but the pain at her heart, if ignored, could not be so easily soothed, and the next morning found her so feverish and languid, that her maid persuaded her not to leave the dressing-room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beaumont was informed that his daughter would breakfast in her own apartments that morning, and perhaps remain there for the remainder of the day, whereupon that gentleman despatched a note to one of his American friends, who had accompanied him to the old country, appointing that afternoon as the one on which to transact some important business which was strictly "confidential" between the two worthy "millionaires."</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>"Then you will do me this favor, Mr. Warren?"</p>
               <p>The speaker was Gerard Carlton; the person addressed was the cashier of his department, of whom he had requested a few minutes' interview in his private room the morning after his visit to the moneylender.</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Carlton, it's a serious thing, a very serious thing," said the cashier; "but I'm always willing to assist a young man like yourself, who has invariably proved himself efficient and regular in his duty, and respectful to his seniors in the office."</p>
               <p>"Believe me," began Gerard.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me," said Mr. Warren; "I had not finished what I intended to say. I am willing to do this little matter for you; but you see, Mr. Carlton, I have a family, and I cannot forget their interests; so it will be necessary to protect myself while serving you. Give me a receipt for your twelve-month's salary, which would cover the amount in question, and when you have honored this bill I will return the receipt to you. This will make me secure without injuring you."</p>
               <p>"I confess it is only fair," said Gerard, after considering the proposal for a few moments; "you shall have the security you ask, Mr. Warren; I will most readily give it to you. But, pardon me if I request that the agreement shall be given in writing. It is not that I doubt your strict honor, but you will confess that the chances of life must be guarded against; and it can do no harm to have the agreement made regular."</p>
               <p>There was a strange, amused look in the cashier's face as he listened to Gerard's half-hesitating speech, but the usual official gravity returned before he replied. "Quite regular, Mr Carlton, quite regular. When you bring me the bill we will exchange the guarantees, which will be mutually satisfactory."</p>
               <p>Gerard expressed his warm gratitude, and returned to his duties with a heart somewhat lightened of one part of its burden.</p>
               <p>It is unnecessary to detail more particularly the completion of the transaction thus successfully begun. Mr. Blamire expressed himself satisfied with the report of Mr. Warren's responsibility; the bill was signed and accepted, the receipt and its condition exchanged, and in twenty-four hours from that date Gerard Carlton found himself free from his pressing liabilities, but burdened with a heavy, impending debt to the moneylender, and a salary mortgaged for twelve months from that time. Perhaps he would have felt more acutely both the present relief and the future danger, had this been his only cause for sorrow. But the one great grief of his life was too deep for mere financial trouble, however serious, to banish it from his mind, and Gerard was too young and buoyant to dwell on a contingency which some unforseen chance might avert.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
               <p>A MONTH had elapsed since the events related in our last chapter, without materially altering the position of the personages of our tale. Gerard's visits to Mrs. Rivers's house were even more frequent than formerly, though his freshly awakened love for Mabel May, which had lain dormant for a time, was yet strong and vivid, even in the hours he spent with Adeline. But there were many causes for the apparent inconsistency. Grenville was now rarely to be seen in his accustomed haunts, and Gerard's lately acquired experience made him shun any temptation to frequent them, even had his friend been as pressing in his inducements as formerly.</p>
               <p>Adeline was more winning than ever since that memorable conversation with Frederick Grenville. There was a gentle gravity and thoughtfulness, a half-implied, half-expressed sympathy with Gerard's evident depression of spirits, which did more to touch the young man's heart than her most brilliant vivacity and beauty could have done. There were times when some casual chance left them together for a moment, and no restraint existed on either of this singularly connected pair; and then Adeline's spirits appeared totally to fail, and she would sit silent and thoughtful, while now and then an inquiring, doubtful look would be fixed on Gerard's face, as if she felt uncertain what course to take in some doubtful question.</p>
               <p>Gerard saw the change, and perhaps felt some faint curiosity as to the cause; but his own anxieties and sorrows were too engrossing for him to spend much thought on what might be only a young girl's caprice. More than once he met Mr. Guildford and Saville at the house, but their manner was so perfectly courteous to himself, and so unexceptionable to both Mrs. Rivers and Adeline, that their presence was scarcely a drawback to his comfort. Mr. Guildford was so attentive to the elder lady, that Gerard half-suspected him of some intention to make her<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6520-00000057"/> mistress of Garron's Hill; and Saville's polished wit and thorough knowledge of the world often diverted both Adeline and himself from their gloomy thoughts. Grenville was seldom to be seen; his whole time appeared to be engrossed with his new friends and with Lord Hargrave, who was just then confined to the house by a trilling indisposition, and to whom his nephew was paying most dutiful attention. Gerard knew all this, and tortured himself by imagining the hours that Grenville passed at Mabel's side, enjoying all the privileges of an acknowledged, if not accepted suitor, exerting all the fascinations he possessed to win her love, and sunning himself in the smiles which had once been lavished on Gerard in other and happier days.</p>
               <p>It was a period of harrowing suspense, which appeared to Gerard to be even worse than the certainty of the almost inevitable result, and yet his pulse throbbed painfully when he by any chance encountered Grenville, and he felt that another moment might confirm his most dreaded anticipations.</p>
               <p>Time still wore on, and June, with its soft, bright air, and light and warmth, had arrived, and Gerard knew that in a few short weeks the Beaumonts and Lord Hargrave would probably take wing with the rest of the gay world, and—what was a yet more tangible, if not more keenly felt cause of alarm—that his acceptance would be shortly afterwards due, and not one chance could he see of meeting its formidable amount. No wonder that he grew haggard and pale—that his chief at the office had frequent occasion to reprimand him for blunders that were almost inexcusable, and that the beautiful, soft, thoughtful eyes of the fair Adeline were fixed more often than before on his careworn face.</p>
               <p>It was one glorious afternoon in June, when Gerard returned from his daily duties, chaffing and gloomy after a severe reprimand from his chief which he could not conceal from himself was but too well merited by a blunder of unusual grossness. But poor Gerard, like most other persons found small consolation or composure in this consciousness of error, and with the usual perversity of human nature, was more angry with the irreproachably just rebuke than with himself for having deserved it. And yet Gerard was as frank as he was high-spirited, and most ready to confess his own error, but the galling burden on his spirits fretted him to feverish anger and desperation. A bitter sense of wrong and injustice from all the world was the sole feeling of which he was conscious, and any philosophical or moral reflections on his own share in his misfortunes was quite beyond his powers at that moment. He hated, distrusted every one—every one but his mother and Adeline. They had never changed—they were the only human beings who cared for or sympathised with him, and he would in future avoid any intimate acquaintance with a cold, unprincipled world.</p>
               <p>Gerard's steps were involuntarily turned to Queen Anne Street; and as he walked along, he asked himself why he should not take the only chance or comfort or safety left to him, and ask Adeline to trust herself to him, with the firm resolve on his part to devote himself henceforth to her happiness. She loved him—so Grenville said, and so her subdued, wistful manner and glances seemed to tell. She was lovely, accomplished, wellborn, and, with fortune enough to relieve him from his present difficulties, and make their marriage possible, even without any increase in his own income for the present. Then Lord Hargrave, who had shown him uniform, if somewhat reserved kindness, in his few visits to Grosvenor Street, would feel it doubly incumbent on him to take charge of his future advancement, and he would soon place Adeline in the position she ought to occupy.</p>
               <p>Such were the rapid ideas that passed through Gerard's feverish brain as he walked hurriedly on. They were the sole hopes that appeared to be left to him, rather than any calculating considerations for self-interest. Disappointed love, mortified pride, pressing and alarming debt, were fast driving him to the last and most desperate resource of all—a marriage without love, and with a very imperfect knowledge of the woman he was about to ask to be his wife.</p>
               <p>"Miss Rivers is at home, sir; but my mistress is just gone out with Mr. Guildford," was the reply to Gerard's question, and one more welcome he could scarcely have received at that moment.</p>
               <p>Gerard was so completely an <choice>
                     <sic>habituè</sic>
                     <corr>habitué</corr>
                  </choice> of the house that the servant by no means thought it always incumbent to announce him, and Gerard, after a soft and apparently unnoticed tap at the drawing-room door, entered unbidden. Adeline was there, but she had evidently not heard his approach. She stood leaning her arm on the mantle-piece, her head bowed on her hands, and her graceful form bent forward in an attitude of utter dejection. She heard the handle of the door turn, and looked hastily round as Gerard advanced; and even in his own agitation and alarm he saw the wan, suffering look on her face, which the sudden flush and effort to smile her usual welcome could not disguise.</p>
               <p>"I did not hear you," she said. "I had a bad headache, and was enjoying a few moments' quiet after our visitors had gone. Mamma is out too,"</p>
               <p>"So I heard, and I was very glad of it," said Gerard, abruptly. "I wanted to speak to you, to tell you—"</p>
               <p>"I am almost tired of news," she said, with a wan smile; "I hope you have nothing very startling to say. I have been hearing so much that is new this morning."</p>
               <p>"I hope it may not be so to you," said Gerard, half-chilled by her strange manner. "But is it from Mr. Guildford that you have heard these wonderful tidings? They said he had gone out with Mrs. Rivers."</p>
               <p>"Not altogether," replied Adeline, with a hard, ringing tone in her rich, soft voice. "Frederick—Captain Grenville has been here."</p>
               <p>Gerard walked hastily to the window; he felt like a man about to endure a terrible operation, a crushing blow, and he strove to nerve himself, to bear it without flinching.</p>
               <p>"Then, of course, it was from him that the shock came, Miss Rivers?" he said, returning to the seat she had pushed towards him near her own.</p>
               <p>"It was," she replied. "Can you guess it?"</p>
               <p>"He is going to be married, I suppose, to the young lady—"</p>
               <p>"To Miss May," said Adeline, quietly; "I think he said you knew her. Is she very beautiful?"—"Very," replied Gerard.</p>
               <p>"You pay me a compliment, Mr. Carlton, in supposing that I can hear another woman's praises without annoyance," said Adeline, with a scornful smile; "and yet I might well feel a little jealous of this fair Mabel, who has engrossed my cousin so completely of late. He was once so entirely at my command on all occasions; a most convenient relative, as you may suppose."</p>
               <p>Gerard could not trust his voice to speak just then; his mouth felt parched and fevered, but he bowed assent to Adeline's half-questioning assertion. He dared not meet her searching look, nor risk betraying himself to her quick ear by the unnatural tones which he felt would be the result of any attempt to speak. But her dark eyes were fixed intently on his half-bowed face, and for the first time Adeline's quick brain suspected something of the truth. And yet Frederick Grenville had assured her of Gerard's love for herself, and urged her to accept it; but it was only one more step in the deep game he was evidently playing, and she was no simple, timid girl, to be deceived or thrown over with impunity. She could bear, and would hear the truth.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Carlton," she said, suddenly, "you are unhappy. What is the matter?—what is it that can trouble one of 'Fortune's favorites,' as Fred calls you?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing that I ought to trouble Miss Rivers with," replied the young man bitterly. "She would only take from me what little friendship she may now honor me with, were I to confess all that weighs on my spirits, all my folly, my madness."</p>
               <p>"No, no, Mr. Carlton," said Adeline, in her softest tones, do not think so ill of me. I am not so thoroughly worldly and hard as you seem to fancy. If you like to, if you can trust me. I can promise you at least sympathy; and I have too many failings of my own to think harshly of another's errors. Will you not trust me?"</p>
               <p>Adeline looked very lovely as she spoke, her splendid eyes very soft and liquid; her sweet lips slightly parted, in eager anxiety to gain her point. All trace of coquetry, of the slight tone of satire that sometimes spoiled the beauty of that mouth was gone; nothing but gentle womanly softness and sympathy remained; and at such a moment she was irresistible.</p>
               <p>"I will,—I do trust you with my whole heart!" exclaimed Gerard, warmly. "Oh Adeline, why did I not know you sooner, or else not know you at all? Either would have been happier than this conflict in my feelings."</p>
               <p>And what have I to do with the trouble that disturbs you?" she said gently. I am unconscious of having done anything to occasion it. Tell me all, Gerard; let me judge of the real extent of this terrible mountain that you have conjured up. Perhaps it is sadly magnified in your Irish imagination."</p>
               <p>"I will take you at your word," said the young man, passionately. "I have no friend, no one that I can trust; and strange as it may seem, I will refer it to you. You shall judge between yourself and me."</p>
               <p>In a rapid torrent of passionate words he told her all the truth: his love for Mabel May, his doubtful birth, the scorn with which his suit had been received, and his determination to forget the woman who could treat true and honest love like his so unworthily.</p>
               <p>"And then I saw you, Adeline, he continued, "and your beauty and fascination and gentleness won me to admire—to love you; and I hoped, I wished to gain your affection and make you my wife; and Fred Grenville encouraged me to hope, and held out an inducement which was rather an obstacle than an encouragement—your fortune, your birth, and connection with Lord Hargrave, which might retrieve my ruined position—ruined partly by my own mad folly and partly from adverse fortune. And then came the news that he was courting Mabel, that he was a favored admirer; and my half-conquered love for her revived in its full force, though it did not alter my feelings to you, Adeline, but rather made me cling more closely to the one being who now had any charm for me, the only one in whose society I had any happiness, any consolation. And now it is all over. Mabel is the bride of another, and I, broken in heart, ruined in fortune, am still too true, too proud to attempt to gain the sole happiness or comfort possible for me by even a tacit deception. Adeline, you are very dear to me—not as Mabel was; but perhaps more tenderly, clingingly loved; but I dare not even ask you to take pity on such a forlorn, miserable wretch as I am."</p>
               <p>Adeline had listened patiently, eagerly to this burst of overcharged feelings, and never by gesture or word had she interrupted<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6520-00000058"/> Gerard in his tale of sadness and passion; but the small hand grasped the gold scent-bottle she held till the glass shivered in pieces in the strong pressure, and her face varied from attentive sorrowing sympathy to the most bitter scorn as Gerard went on, and the unhappy young man believed that his weakness and apparent treachery to herself had offended her past forgiveness.</p>
               <p>A pause followed his rapidly-spoken confession, so dead and still that the contrast seemed like the silence of a death-chamber, after the agitated lamentations and prayers of the sorrowing were hushed in despair. Adeline's first words took Gerard by surprise; they were so different from what he expected, so foreign to the engrossing and passionate feelings that had burst from him like a torrent.</p>
               <p>"Then you are in debt—danger!" she said, abruptly, her eyes turned on Gerard's face with a keen glance that would discern the truth.</p>
               <p>The young man colored crimson; his embarrassment had never appeared so degrading as at that moment.</p>
               <p>"I have said so, Miss Rivers," he replied, haughtily.</p>
               <p>"Poor fellow!" she said with a sad smile, "you think me very hard and calculating to speak of mere money, when your whole soul is smarting with the wound you have received; but I am a year or two older than you in age, and at least ten in experience, and I understand more of these matters than you can do. Besides, the question bears more on your deeper griefs than you can imagine."</p>
               <p>"I do not comprehend you, Miss Rivers," he said, in a somewhat relenting, but still constrained tone.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps not—nor will you do so at present," she said calmly: "but time will prove which is right, Gerard. You have trusted me with your story, can you not trust me when I ask you to wait before you take any desperate measure, such as you are contemplating?"</p>
               <p>"What measure?" asked Gerard, hastily; for he began to fancy Adeline had some strange source of information unknown to him, and that the matter of the acceptance had been mentioned to her.</p>
               <p>"That of attempting, in a fit of pique and vexation, to engage yourself to a woman that you do not love," replied Adeline.</p>
               <p>"Do not take away my only hope, my only consolation, Adeline," said Gerard. "I dare not—would not deceive you. I have confessed to you the whole disgraceful truth. I tell you as truly that you are my only bond to life—the only gleam of sunshine in my dark life. I do not ask you to join your fate to that of so unfortunate a man; but, if I should surmount my present troubles—if I am able to offer you something more worthy of you—"</p>
               <p>Gerard was startled by a moan—almost a sob—which escaped the lips of his fair companion.</p>
               <p>"Worthy of me!" she said bitterly, "Oh, never!"</p>
               <p>Then the proud, calm look came back, ere Gerard could be well certain that he had heard aright.</p>
               <p>"Stay," she said; "do not talk like that, Gerard; you know not the pain you give me. It is not that—it is for yourself, for others, that I beg you to wait, to have patience, and trust. Better things may be in store for you than you imagine—better, far better, than for me."</p>
               <p>"It is some comfort to have told you the truth, Adeline," said Gerard. "I feel less guilty, less like an imposter, now that you know all."</p>
               <p>"And suppose," said Adeline, "I am as little what I seem as you were; what then, Gerard?"</p>
               <p>"I could never doubt you, Adeline," he replied, gazing in her beautiful face; "especially now, when you have pardoned, and spoken hope and comfort to me in my humiliation and sorrow."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps!" she said; "who can tell? But I will trust you. You have a true and kindly heart, and would serve me in the time of need, even when others might scorn and desert me. Time will show; but at present there is no consolation for either of us but patience and prudence."</p>
               <p>"It is too late," said Gerard, sadly; "that might have availed me once."</p>
               <p>"It is never too late," said Adeline. "Be advised; keep master of yourself, do nothing rashly, and in any strait send to me. If I cannot help you, I can sympathise with you. Will you promise me this?"</p>
               <p>"I will," said Gerard, much moved. "But, Adeline, you do not mean to banish me from you?"</p>
               <p>"No," she replied, smiling, "though it might be well if I did; and, besides other <choice>
                     <sic>contingences</sic>
                     <corr>contingencies</corr>
                  </choice>, I may be away. We may leave town in a few weeks, possibly for some distance; but wherever I may be, remember my words."</p>
               <p>"I will," said Gerard, much struck by her earnest, significant manner; "and I thank you from my heart for your interest in my unworthy self. I feel already lighter—relieved of the terrible burden that weighed on me."</p>
               <p>"You shall not repent your confidence," said Adeline. "It is sacred with me, except it may serve you materially to share it. And now leave me; I am tired, and I would have time to think before my mother returns. Come in to-night, to-morrow, any time, and do not appear to have seen me to day. Good-bye."</p>
               <p>Adeline extended her hand, hot and dry with feverish agitation, in token of dismissal. Gerard pressed it to his lips, and hastily left the room, with very different feelings from those with which he had entered it. All thoughts of Adeline save as a dear sister, friend, seemed to vanish from his mind; but there was an inexpressible relief in having shared his anxieties and sorrows with one who could understand, and, it almost appeared, influence his future fate.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
               <p>MABEL MAY had recovered from the slight attack of feverish indisposition which had succeeded Captain Grenville's first visit to her father's house, and regained much of her outward cheerfulness and apparent interest in her usual occupations and amusements; but her face was more delicate than ever in its cream-like whiteness, and her beautiful features were a shade more sharp and defined than before that ill-omened evening. Grenville had been a constant, and, it seemed a formal guest with both father and daughter. Mr. Beaumont was never happy except when his new friend was at his house; and even Mabel seemed more interested in his brilliant conversation, and graceful, delicate attentions to him, than she deigned to appear to any other of the numerous admirers who flocked round her. He was able to enter into all her tastes and fancies, and was so quick to discern every changing mood, and guard her from the annoyances to which the coarser mind and more selfish temper of her father exposed her, that Mabel insensibly looked on his coming as a relief, and felt a safety and repose in his presence. In truth, Mr. Beaumont was a stranger to his daughter, as regarded all practical purposes. He had left her when a mere child to the care of the sister of Lady Mabel, while he devoted his time and energies to amassing a fortune, which was to give brilliancy to her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">débût;</foreign> and now that they were at last united, they found, though scarcely knowing why, that their ideas, habits of thought, tastes, and feelings, were as widely opposed as if no tie of blood existed between them. It was not wonderful, therefore, that the refined manners, tact, and delicate devotion to herself, which were Frederick Grenville's characteristics, should be a refuge, an attraction to the lonely girl—lonely in the midst of wealth, flatterers, and surface friends.</p>
               <p>It was a day or two after Gerard Carlton's explanation with Adeline Rivers, when Mabel entered the drawing-room rather later than usual, having remained till early that morning at a ball, of peculiar brilliancy, and consequently suffered somewhat from the fatigue and exhaustion which were its penalty. Still, she looked very beautiful in her white <choice>
                     <sic>negligè</sic>
                     <corr>negligé</corr>
                  </choice>, and its pale blue trimming, for her intellectual style of features was little dependent on bloom and brilliancy; indeed, it might be doubted whether an observer of taste would not have appreciated their perfect outline, and sweet, thoughtful expression more completely, when the absence of full toilette and vivacity tested the reality of these attractions. She threw herself languidly into a large chair, and began to think in the dreamy, lazy style which is frequently the result of any exhaustion of body. The ball of the evening before had reminded her of those less brilliant but more keenly enjoyed ones of a year back, when, in the fullness of young spirits, and a light, unburthened heart, she had abandoned herself to the delicious and novel happiness, the source of which she had scarcely then suspected, even in her most secret heart. And now, what a change, not only in her outward position, but in herself! There were more means of happiness, of luxury, of enjoyment around her, but the capability of appreciating them was marred by the hidden pain that cankered every feeling, and embittered the very source and fountain of happiness.</p>
               <p>There was the sound of carriage wheels stopping at the door, a ring at the heavy bell, then feet were heard on the stairs, and Mabel turned to the door, expecting to see Frederick Grenville, who had promised to bring her his report of a new horse, which Mr. Beaumont was about to purchase for her especial use.</p>
               <p>It was not the young officer who was <choice>
                     <sic>an-announced</sic>
                     <corr>announced</corr>
                  </choice>, but one nearly connected with him, the Earl of Hargrave.</p>
               <p>Mabel rose in some astonishment, for her knowledge of Frederick Grenville's uncle was limited to a dinner or two exchanged between him and her father, and an occasional encounter at parties, when mere ordinary and casual courtesies were the result of the meeting. Thinking that the servant had made some mistake in her father's absence from home, she received the peer, with a slight but becoming timidity.</p>
               <p>"My father is from home, my lord," said Mabel; "he will be very sorry to have missed your visit."</p>
               <p>"It was to you, Miss May, not to Mr. Beaumont, that my visit was intended," replied Lord Hargrave, gently; "and pardon me, if I say, I am very glad to find that you are alone."</p>
               <p>Mabel could never be ungraceful, but she was most unquestionably somewhat embarrassed, as she resumed her seat, while her visitor placed himself on a chair opposite to her, where he could command a full view of her face.</p>
               <p>Whatever Lord Hargrave's business might be, it seemed somewhat difficult for him to commence its explanation. He sat, for what appeared to Mabel a long time, though in reality it might have been not more than five minutes, in thoughtful, abstracted silence, his<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6520-00000059"/> eyes bent on the ground, though his mind was evidently far away from the pattern of the rich Axminister carpet, which he seemed to be so attentively considering. At last he roused himself from this fit of abstraction, and a grave smile crossed his face at the unconscious eccentricity of which he had been guilty.</p>
               <p>"I hope you will forgive an old and solitary man for his absence of mind, Miss May," said he; "it was a very unintentional rudeness, I assure you."</p>
               <p>"I will consider it as a compliment, my lord," said Mabel, with one of her sweet smiles. "Besides, it is a luxury to lose oneself in thought sometimes."</p>
               <p>"You are young to think so," said the carl, looking intently at the fair face. "You can have little but what is delightful to remember, nothing to regret."</p>
               <p>"Experience is not always counted by years," replied Mabel, smiling. "I am, at any rate, old enough to have learnt that truth. And I think a life must be unhappy indeed that has had nothing to look back on with regret for the loss of past pleasures and distant friends."</p>
               <p>"You are right, quite right," said the earl, with a deep sigh. "I was young, young perhaps as yourself, considering the difference of sex, when I lost all that was dearest to me on earth, and all real happiness passed away with them. But your life has yet to begin; childhood and girlhood are but dreams; it is with marriage that a woman's real experience commences. And it was that very thought that caused my absence of mind just now. You, and the errand which brought me to you, brought back old memories so strongly—happy, yet distressing memories."</p>
               <p>Mabel turned a shade paler than before. What could all this mean, from one comparatively a stranger to her?</p>
               <p>"I am sorry—" she began, timidly.</p>
               <p>"No, do not say that," interrupted the earl. "You have but revived what is ever in the depths of my heart; and if you hear what I have to say favorably, you can be my best consolation for the past."</p>
               <p>Again Mabel looked wonderingly, but there was a gentle dignity in Lord Hargrave's look and manner that prevented either fear or eager questioning; and she waited his own time for revealing his errand.</p>
               <p>"Mabel May," he said, after a moment's pause, "it is not often that the young men of the present day display much of the modesty of true love, nor do they fear to trust their own powers in urging their suit. But either you have been unusually reserved, or my nephew has been singularly timid in reading your sentiments, for, from your manner he can scarcely hope to stake his fate on the result of the simple question I am going to ask. Can you be happy with him as your future husband?"</p>
               <p>Mabel's cheeks had become like warm rubies as the earl spoke, and her eyes were hidden under the long eyelashes that skirted the lids; and when he had finished, she still remained silent, though the quick beating of her heart told that it was much moved by the agitating question put to her.</p>
               <p>"Mabel," said the earl, "I am alone, without wife and child. I have not lived so long without being able to read pretty accurately the characters of those with whom I have to do. I have watched you when you little suspected it, and my choice would have fallen on you, for the bride of my son, had he lived to bless my old age. Frederick Grenville stands to me in the place of my son; he has many good qualities—some errors, that would disappear were he happily married. He is my heir, and can offer you a station worthy of you. Will you gladden a bereaved old man's heart by yielding to his suit?"</p>
               <p>There was a tremor in the earl's voice, a moisture in his eyes, that touched Mabel far more than Fred Grenville's most ardent protestations could have done. The young man could not have chosen a better advocate in Mabel's present state of mind.</p>
               <p>"You are very good, very kind," she said gently. "I will not pretend that this is entirely unexpected by me, but it is no affectation to say I cannot answer you immediately, at least not as you could wish."</p>
               <p>"Will you not trust me with the truth?" said the earl.</p>
               <p>"I will, indeed I will," replied Mabel, looking in his face with the ingenuousness of a child. "I have no one that I could confide in so safely only—"</p>
               <p>"I am not like a mother, my poor child, though I could well act in a father's place to you," said the earl. "But, Mabel, though I would not attempt to pry into your girlish heart's secrets you may safely tell me whether I may give Frederick hope that he may win your love, if he has it not now."</p>
               <p>Mabel hesitated; even that question was a perplexing one to answer. She knew well that she could never love again, as she had once loved Gerard Carlton; and yet there was a sweetness in the idea of being loved really, truly, for herself alone—in having such a father as Lord Hargrave would be to his nephew's bride. She knew that Mr. Beaumont was bent on her marrying, and if she must give her hand to escape from an uncongenial home, there was no one of her many admirers whom she could like so well, or who could offer so many inducements as Frederick Grenville.</p>
               <p>All this passed rapidly through Mabel's mind as she sat, conscious of the earl's earnest though gentle gaze, as he waited patiently for her reply. At last it came, truthful and clear as her own candid nature.</p>
               <p>"Lord Hargrave," she said, "you are so kind, so candid with me, that I would not deceive you. I believe I might in time be happy with Captain Grenville; I am quite sure I should dearly value the fatherly love you offer me, and prize it more than any other gift that he could secure to me."</p>
               <p>The earl inclined his head, and gravely kissed her forehead, which was cautiously bent down so low that he could not read the troubled look in her deep, grey eyes.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my child; you shall not repent your confidence in me," said the old nobleman. "But, tell me, am I to consider this an acceptance of the proposal Frederick so earnestly entreated me to make?"</p>
               <p>"No, no," said Mabel, shivering, in spite of her assumed bravery, at the idea of speaking the decisive words, "only what you said, that he may hope—that I may try—I mean I will try to return his affection in time."</p>
               <p>"Mabel," said Lord Hargrave, looking gravely at her, "I hope I have not done wrong in speaking to you as I did. I would not tempt you to falsify your real feelings, or crush down some secret longing that would make such a promise a burden too heavy for you to endure. Mark me, my child, you might be able in time to learn to love a-man whom you already esteem and like; but if there is something to forget, your task would be hopeless."</p>
               <p>Mabel understood him, and the hot crimson flamed in her cheeks; but even Lord Hargrave's penetration could not decide whether the heat which seemed to burn the delicate skin, was from offended pride or wounded consciousness.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, Mabel," he said gently; "but my conscience would not have been clear from blame if I had not warned you against a tempting error which has ruined the happiness of so many."</p>
               <p>The heat had died away like spent embers as the earl spoke, and the next moment Mabel was calm and pale, and proud as ever.</p>
               <p>"It is I who ought to ask forgiveness," she said; "I resented kindness as if it were insult. You will think there is some reason for such foolish touchiness, Lord Hargrave; but there will be none if I comply with your wish. There are follies that are best stamped out by crushing them with others; for confession only gives a vent to the half-smothered weaknesses of past days. If I am worthy that you choose me to be your nephew's wife, I am worthy of trust; and I feel assured that you would trust me."</p>
               <p>Lord Hargrave looked admiringly at the calm, white face, so genially and dearly confronting his earnest gaze. Mabel's proud self-control was akin to his own strong nature, and moved him far more than the most indignant protestations or feminine resentment.</p>
               <p>"Child, I do trust you," he said; "and, what is far more, I believe you capable of judging calmly as well as striving to do right. I read your secret to some degree; but, were it my son instead of my nephew, ay, more, had it been myself in former day's I would have accepted fearlessly your simple assurance that you knew you could be happier with me than without the love and care that I would lavish on you. In a month from the present time I will ask you once more whether Frederick may put to you the question that he longs to have answered; till then, you need not fear that he will harrass you by a single word of entreaty. In any case, Mabel, remember that you have a never-failing friend in Frederick Grenville's uncle in any time of need or sorrow, should it come. Farewell, my dear child!"</p>
               <p>With a solemn, half-paternal kiss on her brow, the earl took his leave of the young girl, between whom and himself one short hour had established such relations of sympathy and mutual regard. But it was not so sudden or so impulsive as it appeared on Lord Hargrave's part. There were associations with Mabel's very name that gave a pledge for his truth, and purity, and the experience of a long life and varied intercourse with the world had taught his lordship to read with tolerably unerring quickness the characteristics of those with whom he came in contact.</p>
               <p>Mabel remained long in deep thought after the earl had left her. It was no passionate regrets for the past, nor eager hopes for the future, that his words had left in her mind, but a deep, dull aching, a calm apathy, that seemed too deep for the relief of more acute feeling. At last her lip quivered convulsively, and her small hand grasped tightly the arms of the chair in which she reclined, like a person striving to keep back some terrible pain. Then came a low, half-smothered wail, which scarcely amounted to words, but in which one name faintly mingled with the catching, labored sigh; and that name was "Gerard."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head>
               <p>"MR. CARLTON, be so good as to go to Mr. Milner's room. He wishes to speak with you."</p>
               <p>The summons to the apartment of a "chief" is ever an omen of ill or good in the government offices of the Crown. Either a reprimand is to be given, a blunder to be explained, or, in rarer and happier instances, the announcement of some unexpected promotion or change to be announced to the junior admitted to such an audience.</p>
               <p>Gerard Carlton had grown nervous of late; every step startled him—every letter brought the flush to his cheek, and sent his pulse bounding through his whole frame. The vision of the bland, oily Mr. Blamire haunted his dreams at night, and his thoughts in<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6520-00000060"/> the day. Every instinct of his nature recoiled from the disgrace, the dishonor which would be the consequence of an exposure of his position; the disgrace of a prison; the dishonor of having contracted debts he could not repay. His moral sense told him that the stigma on his birth, which had been the first rude shock he had known, was no real blot on his character; no real cause for personal degradation and shame. But the imprudence, the madness of the last few months had been the result of his own grievous errors, and as such deserved and would receive grievous punishment. Gerard discovered, as thousands have done before him, and thousands will do to the end of time, that every trouble is bearable but remorse and dishonor. There are certainly temperaments of such indomitable strength and adamantine hardness, that even in such a position as his, the very emergency and danger only prompt them to more unscrupulous and daring measures; and like a tiger at bay they lose all sense of fear or remaining self-respect and honor, and <choice>
                     <sic>perchace</sic>
                     <corr>perchance</corr>
                  </choice> safety and a sort of gloomy grandeur, by a bold and desperate pursuance of the course on which they have entered. But Gerard Carlton's spirit was at once too noble and too tender for such a mode of action, and by the consciousness of his own past folly, and the disgrace and ruin which would probably be its penalty, his very manliness was weakened, and his high spirit crushed and degraded, till the most trifling incident startled and agitated him, while yet despising himself for his weakness.</p>
               <p>Gerard stood for a moment before the door of Mr. Milner's apartment, to collect his energies to meet whatever new blow might wait him; and then with a desperate resolution to know the worst, he hastily turned the handle of the lock, and stood in the chief clerk's presence. Mr. Milner pointed to a chair with grave and ominous courtesy; and, preoccupied as he was, Gerard could not but remark the unusual gloomy and harassed expression of the chief clerk's face.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Carlton," he said, "I have always made it a rule to show every leniency and indulgence to the younger employes under my control, and to remember the various temptations which may excuse a temporary and sudden lapse from strict duty and right. Many a young man has been hopelessly crushed and ruined by a contrary course being pursued towards him, and even where it fails to do good, it throws all responsibility on the man himself, and deepens both his guilt and his punishment."</p>
               <p>Mr. Milner paused a moment, and Gerard sat eagerly watching for the next words, that would probably confirm his worst fears.</p>
               <p>"Such has been ever my rule of conduct," resumed Mr. Milner; "and in your case, Mr. Carlton, I have been more especially willing to carry it out, since I have formed a favorable opinion both of your talents and your general character. And even now, when my confidence in your rectitude has been most unhappily shaken, I am inclined to give you a chance of retrieving yourself, if possible, before it is too late."</p>
               <p>Another ominous pause; Gerard was now very pale.</p>
               <p>"A sudden and most disgraceful discovery has been made, continued Mr. Milner, "which, as yet is not public, though it cannot long remain quiet. Mr. Warren, the cashier of this department, absconded the day before yesterday, taking with him public money to a considerable amount. His absence was not considered suspicious till this morning, when from certain circumstances it became evident that he was a criminal defaulter in his accounts, and I have been making a rapid examination of the papers in his desk, and also of his books. And though the occurrence is a most disgraceful one, I must say, that the discovery of this document among the papers has given me more regret than anything which has yet come to light. Look here, Mr. Carlton!"</p>
               <p>The chief clerk extended an open paper to his unfortunate junior, who sat motionless and calm, as if paralysed by the sudden intelligence. It needed but one glance to see that it was the receipt for the amount of his whole year's salary, which he had given to the cashier as security, in lieu of his acceptance of the bill, and in a moment the whole extent of his danger flashed on his mind. Not only was his whole means of subsistence gone, by this undeniable acknowledgment for what he had never received, but every hope that Mr. Blamire's bill might be met by Warren, till he could devise any means of refunding the money, was swept away; nay, worse than swept away by this disaster, which added new horror to his previously alarming position.</p>
               <p>"I fear I need hardly inquire whether the paper is genuine, Mr. Carlton," said Mr. Milner. "Your face is a sufficient reply, and it is some satisfaction to perceive that the ingenuousness of your age is not yet destroyed by the errors you must have fallen into, to have given occasion for this paper. The signature is yours." Carlton bowed assent. "And have you been privy to the whole of Mr. Warren's dishonest tamperings with the money intrusted to him?" said Mr. Milner.</p>
               <p>"To none," replied Gerard, looking up suddenly with a look of flashing indignation, which, however misplaced at such a moment, was no weak vindication of his innocence, in the eyes of his acute examiner.</p>
               <p>"I shall be greatly rejoiced if you can prove your assertion," returned Mr. Milner; "but it is useless to conceal from you that appearances are gravely against you. You must surely have had some intimate and confidential transactions with Mr. Warren, to have induced him to consent to such an extraordinary proceeding as a year's advance of your salary, and be also in most unfortunate difficulties yourself, to have anticipated your salary in such a manner."</p>
               <p>Gerard was silent. He knew enough of the Government service to be aware that such a proceeding as that of which he had been guilty would be almost as unpardonable an offence as the anticipation of his salary, and however suspicious the appearances against him, it must be impossible to prove the slightest connivance on his part with the guilty cashier.</p>
               <p>"I am aware that my conduct has been highly reprehensible," he said, with a calmness which surprised himself as much as it did the worthy chief. "But I am as innocent as yourself, sir, of the slightest knowledge of Mr. Warren's dishonest transactions; and so far as I am concerned, I challenge any injury possible into the affair."</p>
               <p>"Then why did you receive so large a sum in advance?" asked the chief clerk. "It will be necessary to account for that, Mr. Carlton."</p>
               <p>"I must decline any further explanation, sir," said the young man, coloring deeply; "though I again declare most solemnly that I am as ignorant and innocent as you are yourself in this matter."</p>
               <p>Mr. Milner looked searchingly in Gerard's face; there was no guilt in the clear, sad eyes, that met his with a proud, unflinching gaze. And yet the mouth was unmistakably troubled and remorseful in its expression, and the facts were startlingly corroborative of the young man's own acknowledgment of error.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Carlton," he said, "there is something that both interests and perplexes me in your conduct and manner. You are, I will honestly say, too young in the service to have become entangled with the disgraceful proceedings which have just come to light; but still, the fact is plain and unquestionable, that there has been a remarkable and singular transaction between you, which you refuse to explain. Irregular as it is to depart from my official capacity, when dealing with my juniors, I would willingly befriend you if I can, if you will confide in me. At any rate I will not betray you."</p>
               <p>Tears sprang into the young man's eyes at this unexpected kindness, coming as it did at such a moment of desolation and hopelessness. The offer of advice and assistance from a man so experienced and so prudent was in itself an inexpressible relief.</p>
               <p>"I cannot sufficiently thank you, Mr. Milner," he said in a broken voice; "but I am even more grateful for the opportunity of vindicating myself in your eyes, than for the forlorn hope of any escape from my present perilous position. The truth is soon told; but it is not the less hopeless. I got into debt, accepted a bill to which Mr. Warren put his name, demanding as security the receipt for my year's salary, which you have found, and for which I have not received one farthing. That is the whole and true explanation of the matter."</p>
               <p>"The double-dyed rascal," growled the chief clerk, in a suppressed voice of passion and indignation, quite unofficial. "Poor boy, poor foolish boy! I see it all; the old tale. But what is to be done is a great deal less plain. The knowledge of such a transaction on your part, would be as certain dismissal for you as any collusion with that old scoundrel; it is a bad business, a very bad business."</p>
               <p>"I know it, sir," said Gerard, calmly. "I must take the consequences of my own folly, and I can truly say I am better prepared for what awaits me, since I have told the truth. I should be very sorry for every one to condemn me, however much I may deserve blame."</p>
               <p>"Well, well; but don't be rash, young man, don't be rash," said the chief clerk; "let's see what can be done. It's a terrible thing at your age, and we must see if there's no way of getting out of it."</p>
               <p>He remained silent for a few moments, and then his face brightened.</p>
               <p>"I tell you what I will do, Mr. Carlton," he resumed; "it's stretching a point, certainly, but I trust you, and I don't think I can be mistaken. I need not give up all the details of these accounts for a few days, and if you can manage to find the money to refund the three hundred pounds, which this receipt represents, I will manage the matter for you at head-quarters, and you will lose a year's salary instead of your situation and your reputation into the bargain."</p>
               <p>"I fear it is impossible, Mr. Milner," said Gerard, despondingly. "You are very kind; but I do not see a single chance of finding even the money for the bill I have so foolishly given, and it would be of little use to attempt saving my position here, when a few weeks or rather days, would put me in a prison, in all probability at Mr. Blamire's suit."</p>
               <p>"And have you no friends who would come forward?" asked Mr. Milner.</p>
               <p>"I have none who would be both able and willing; none that I would stoop to ask," replied Gerard, sadly.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, Mr. Carlton," said the chief clerk, "it is not for me to press you on a matter of which you can be the sole judge; but I advise you, for your own sake, to strain every nerve to meet these difficulties; you are very young to have such utter ruin fall upon you. I will give you three days to think of it, and to do what you can before I give in my report. More than that I cannot promise."</p>
               <p>"I appreciate your kindness, sir, and I will accept the respite," replied Gerard, with the calmness of utter despair. "But I<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6520-00000061"/> feel it is but a respite, unless some most unlooked for circumstance happens during the interval. In any case I shall never forget the considerate kindness you have shown to a stranger.</p>
               <p>Accepting Mr. Milner's slight gesture of acknowledgement as a dismissal, Gerard bowed and left the room, feeling like a man in a horrid dream, among shadows of meaningless gaiety and bustle. The jovial laughter, the repartees, the keen jests that went briskly round among his fellow clerks, appeared to Gerard like the insane ravings and merriment of a lunatic asylum. It is as difficult to understand the possibility of light-hearted thoughtlessness, when the heart is burdened with a crushing and hopeless grief, as to realize the brightness and heat of July in a November fog.</p>
               <p>"Carlton has been in for it, that's very clear," said one of his companions, after a vain attempt to get anything but monosyllables from the young man. "Old Milner must have administered a precious dose, to quiet him so completely."</p>
               <p>"You should take these things as coolly as I do, my dear fellow," drawled another. "He's given me up long ago. Try my dodge; look unconsciously astonished, and assure him you have not the slightest notion on earth of what he means; he is fairly beaten by that sort of thing, and there's no insolence in it that he can take hold of."</p>
               <p>"My good fellow, it's not every one that's made of a mixture of India-rubber and millstone as you are," retorted another. "It's a gift to look so utterly without comprehension, as you manage to do."</p>
               <p>While this gay banter passed round him Gerard was conscious but of one horrid certainty, that his character and prospects were blasted for ever, and that his mother's life might possibly fall a sacrifice to his criminal folly. Of Mabel he did not even dare to think. One rapid pang shot through his heart at the thought of her scornful self-gratulation when the news of his disgrace should be reported to her by Frederick Grenville, but he hastily smothered the maddening fancy, lest his self-command should totally fail him.</p>
               <p>The hours wore wearily on, till the moment of liberation from the intolerable restraint arrived, and Gerard rapidly walked along the banks of the noble river, struggling with the sudden temptation it held out, which was well-nigh too strong for his better judgment and sense of right. The whole world seemed against him. Treachery, crime, caprice, injustice, had marked him for their especial victim. His mother, even his tender, beautiful mother, had doomed him by her <choice>
                     <sic>weaknees</sic>
                     <corr>weakness</corr>
                  </choice> to shame and disgrace, and the curse had followed him. Even apparent good had turned to evil, friends had proved his worst foes, and the woman he loved better than himself had proved too weak and interested to bear the first test of her affection. Why should he live to be plunged into deeper disgrace, to endure more crushing mortification?" Were he dead, Mabel might regret her hardness, Adeline would weep for him, his mother would pardon his errors in grief for his loss.</p>
               <p>It was a terrible moment of temptation, to seek oblivion in the deep, still river. One plunge, one momentary pang, and all would be over. He looked round. There were several stragglers on the low banks and quays, and the deed would be both observed and frustrated, were he to attempt it in such a spot. He fancied that curious, wondering looks were bent on him. Every one seemed to read his secret. His morbid brain was impatient and fevered under the imagination, and hastily calling a boat, he jumped in with a force that nearly overturned it, and ordered the man to row as rapidly as possible to Chelsea—there, at least, he should find quiet and privacy; and the cool air and the still motion of the light boat might help to calm the intolerable heat of his burning forehead, and enable him to think somewhat more coherently.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head>
               <p>"MR. SAVILLE, sir," was the announcement of Grenville's servant as his young master sat idly lounging over his late breakfast, three days after the late occurrence.</p>
               <p>"Saville be—!" was the muttered comment of the officer, but the impolite ejaculation was dropped in the utterance to a safe growl, and the audible response was, "Very well. Show him in."</p>
               <p>Reginald Saville, or rather Ronald of the Rath, entered the room with a careless greeting to its occupant, which secretly galled the proud heir of the Hargrave's more than the most open insult, which he could have more safely and reasonably resented.</p>
               <p>"At breakfast still, Grenville?" said he. "Well, I thought I should scarcely interfere with your digestion at this hour. Why, it's long past noon."</p>
               <p>"I rarely look at a clock," was the cool reply; "I leave that to my servant. It's his business, not mine."</p>
               <p>"Exactly. Some persons depute even their love-making to abler hands," replied Ronald; "but I prefer doing my business myself, whether with friend or foe."</p>
               <p>Grenville's lips quivered with suppressed passion as Ronald spoke, but he knew of old that it was dangerous to quarrel with the unscrupulous smuggler.</p>
               <p>"All depends on habit," said he; "I have never been accustomed to take any trouble that I could throw on others. I am too lazy even to open that paper. Be so good as to reach it, and unfold the damp-looking sheets, while I finish my cocoa."</p>
               <p>Ronald's check flushed crimson, and a look of dark defiance passed over his face like a thunder-cloud. He waited a moment, and then rang the bell with a peal that soon brought the servant into the room.</p>
               <p>"Your master wants that newspaper," he said, pointing to the sheet lying on the table.</p>
               <p>Grenville had been taken by surprise by the whole movement, but it was seldom that his tact and self-possession had failed him.</p>
               <p>"You mistake," he said, carelessly. "Fenton, give the paper to Mr. Saville, and take away these breakfast things."</p>
               <p>Fenton was too well trained a servant to linger in his duties, but the few moments he occupied in obeying his orders, was sufficient to recall one at least of the young men to a sense of the folly and danger of a rupture with his companion.</p>
               <p>"This is very absurd, Ronald," said Grenville, as soon as the door was closed.</p>
               <p>"Saville, if you please," interrupted Ronald. "It is safer to observe these little niceties when alone, or awkward mistakes are apt to arise before others."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, don't be a fool!" exclaimed Grenville, striking his hand on the table with a force that made the mahogony shake again. "You'll go too far, Master Ronald, or Saville, or whatever you call yourself, and then your game will be spoiled by playing all your best cards the first round."</p>
               <p>"Never fear, I have always a good trump in reserve," replied Ronald, coolly. "The earldom and estates of Hargrave are prizes not to be thrown away for a little indulgence of pride; and it will be as well for you to remember. Captain Grenville, that the next time you treat me as your lacquey, you will force me to show you I am your master."</p>
               <p>"Scarcely," sneered Grenville, "when I have your very neck in my power, and, by all that is sacred, or what is more akin to you—by all that is fearful—I will give you to the hangman the same day you play me false."</p>
               <p>"And a great consolation to a ruined gamester, the dishonored imposter, the infamous betrayer, the beggared scion of a noble family, if an obscure individual like myself should be sent from this world a little before his time," said Ronald. "Now, listen, Captain Grenville. I have my secrets as well as you, and the only difference between us is, that while I know all your secrets, mine are not quite so patent to your honorable self. You know as well as I do that a word from me can destroy every remaining hope you have in life: your heirship would be gone; you would be discarded by your uncle as a dishonor to the name you bear; scorned and hated by Mabel May, and triumphed over by Adeline Rivers, who would glory in the just and most bitter revenge she will at last obtain."</p>
               <p>"Man," exclaimed Grenville, fairly starting from his chair, and grasping Ronald's arm, "you are a demon, I do believe! Now, what do you know of my past life? Has she dared—"</p>
               <p>"She has dared nothing, if you allude to Miss Rivers," replied Ronald quietly shaking off the grasp of the young officer with an case of which his slight form did not appear capable. She has never exchanged one syllable with me on this subject, or any other but the most indifferent topics. But still I have means of knowing that, and other secret transactions of yours, which you little suspect; and I would advise you, as a friend, to abstain from these little ebullitions, which are more eccentric than safe,—for yourself at any rate," he added.</p>
               <p>Grenville was no match for his adversary, and he knew it. His character lacked the strength, and coolness, and calculation, and indomitable courage which distinguished the smuggler, and which would have shone in a more honorable career. Grenville was selfish, grasping, daring in his own ambitious schemes, ready to venture all to gain his own personal aggrandisement, but he shrank and cowered before the sterner, more resolute will, which would disregard all obstacles, conquer all dangers, that stood in the way of its accomplishment.</p>
               <p>"When is this tyranny, this insufferable insolence of yours to end?" he said, moodily dropping on the chair he had hastily left. "I tell you once for all, Ronald, that terrible as is the alternative you threaten, you may drive me to feeling that it would be better to dare all, and close in deadly fight with my tormentor, than go with a chain round my neck that you can pull at your pleasure. Your power is great, I frankly confess, but the veriest slave will rise against a bond when pulled too tight."</p>
               <p>The words sounded brave; but the half-vindictive, half terrified look in the restless eyes, the irrepressible quiver of the pale lips, and the nervous twitching of the hands, betrayed the craven terror that sickened and chilled the heart within. Still, Ronald knew that it was possible to drive even the unscrupulous Sybarite to desperation; and though he could inflict far heavier punishment than he could suffer, there were awkward revelations in Grenville's power, and a possible result, which would be decidedly less pleasant than the estate of Garron's Hill, and the pretty Norah Adams for its mistress, which his reputed father had held out as his probable future.</p>
               <p>"There's some show of reason in that," he returned; "and I told you once before that I am a man of honor in my transactions; and when they are completed and the price paid, I consider them as much cancelled as a tradesman when he has given a receipt. But then, you see, I exact in return the very last farthing in every item of the account, whether in money consideration, or other services, to be bartered for my own. That's the only safe<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6520-00000062"/> and pleasant way of doing business; and it is mine, even when there is blood necessary, to wipe the transaction off the books."</p>
               <p>Ronald watched with triumphant, gloating pleasure the paling of the cheek and lips to a livid whiteness as he spoke, though he affected to be occupied with a Skye terrier, lying on the rug at his feet, while waiting for Grenville's reply.</p>
               <p>"In plain English, you want something of me?" said Grenville, sharply.</p>
               <p>"I do," replied Ronald.</p>
               <p>"Name it," said Grenville.</p>
               <p>"Nothing very desperate," said Ronald; "only a couple of thousands, and a letter from you, conveying in unmistakable terms your warm friendship for your valued friend, Reginald Saville, and your hope that you will be able to spend some time with me at Saville Manor before your impending marriage."</p>
               <p>"Man, are you mad or drunk?" thundered Grenville.</p>
               <p>"It is to be hoped your servant will imagine you are one or the other, or be may chance to speculate unpleasantly on the cause of your gentle tones," said Ronald, coolly; "you have soon forgotten my friendly warning."</p>
               <p>"Fiend! swindler! villain!" hissed Grenville, in lower and more angry tones, "you talked of blood; you must hold your own life very cheap to enrage me so glaringly. Your demand is preposterous, infamous; I will not listen to terms so exorbitant, so dishonorable. Do you suppose I will commit myself so completely as to write infamous forgeries and falsehoods where an obscure robber is concerned? The sum you ask is as preposterous for you to demand, as it is impossible for me to raise; but I tell you, that sooner than give the letter you speak of, I would blow out your brains and my own."</p>
               <p>"Very amusing; but I really thought you were cured of these superfluous rhapsodies before this," said Ronald, calmly; "I am almost tired of this cowardly blustering, and therefore, if you please, we will consider that all the insane ravings you think necessary are now over, and go to business. Very few words are necessary to finish the matter. I must have the letter before I leave this room, and your promise in writing that you will pay me the money in a week, or I shall go at once to Lord Hargrave, and tell him all, with the proofs, the originals of which he can obtain at his pleasure. In five minutes I am gone."</p>
               <p>Ronald coolly took up the paper he had been desired to scan for the benefit of his companion a short time before, and began to read, though his quick glance turned on Grenville from time to time with a searching, satisfied look, which plainly showed he knew that his triumph was certain. At last he saw a paragraph that more deeply interested him, for his restless eyes remained fastened on the page, and a look of intense satisfaction came over him as he read. Then he crumpled up the paper, and put it in his pocket, unnoticed by the young officer, whose gaze was fixed moodily on the ground.</p>
               <p>"What do you want the money for?" said Grenville, abruptly.</p>
               <p>"I don't see that what I want it for has anything to do with it," replied Ronald; "but as I am always willing to do anything in reason, I don't mind answering your irrelevant question. I intend this little <choice>
                     <sic>transsaction</sic>
                     <corr>transaction</corr>
                  </choice> of ours to be the last of the kind I shall meddle with, and mean to settle down as a country gentleman, with a pretty wife to enliven the dullness of the character; and as I am helping you to one heiress, you must do your part to gain me another."</p>
               <p>"What's the necessity at this moment?" said Grenville. "When all is finished I might manage it, but now it is impossible."</p>
               <p>"Unlucky that, because it must he managed, or you know the consequences," was the cool reply. "I am going to Ireland again very shortly. Mrs. Rivers and her daughter have accepted Mr. Guildford's invitation to Garron's Hill, and I mean to go with them—that's the whole secret of the matter."</p>
               <p>"You!—Garron's Hill!—the Riverses! Are you raving?" gasped Grenville, absolutely choking with the sudden tidings.</p>
               <p>"Oh no; not at all," replied Ronald; "I am too cool a hand for that. Mr. Guildford and Mrs. Rivers were friends, it seems, in old times—though the lady had married, and I suppose changed in more respects than mere name, for it was some little time before they discovered it. However, so it is, and their summer trip and mine is, as I told you, to the dear old Emerald Isle."</p>
               <p>"I insist on knowing the secret of this foolery!" exclaimed Grenville, passionately. "You do not dare—you cannot mean—it is not Miss Rivers that you—"</p>
               <p>"That I intend to marry?" said Ronald; "by no means, Captain Grenville. I am curious in my ideas, perhaps, but I have a prejudice against other men's <foreign xml:lang="FRA">cher amis;</foreign> and, beautiful as she is, I was not aware that the fair Adeline was an heiress."</p>
               <p>"Would that she were!" gasped Grenville, unconsciously. "Would to Heaven that it had been so! Much of my present misery and degradation would then have been spared me."</p>
               <p>"Oh, sits the wind there?" said Ronald. "And you prefer the dark eyes to the grey—all according to taste; I have a fancy for the true Irish orbs, and your pretty <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fiancée</foreign> might have been born in that famed land of Erin, to judge from her dark grey peepers. But this is all beside the mark; and your agreeable conversation, captain, has made me forget how the minutes go. What have you decided—yes, or no, to my proposal?"</p>
               <p>"How soon do you mean to bring things to a crisis, and remove that confounded upstart out of my way?" said Grenville.</p>
               <p>"Can't bind myself to a week or two," replied Ronald; "but I think matters are drawing to a crisis, and I expect to conclude it before I start for Ireland. Come, come, Grenville, no more shuffling; the time's up ten minutes since."</p>
               <p>He rose as he spoke, and stood with one foot slightly advanced in the direction of the door. Grenville saw and understood the gesture.</p>
               <p>"Ronald," said he, "as there is a heaven above us, I believe I had better put a bullet into you, and have no more of this torture from you. I wonder you dare trust yourself to exasperate me thus, when you are so completely at my mercy."</p>
               <p>"Not so fast, gallant captain, not so fast," said Ronald. "I am not quite so green as you fancy. Do you suppose I trust to your honor, or even your fears? Not a whit. There are those who would soon revenge any harm that might happen to me; and what is more, the whole secrets that concern you would be in Lord Hargrave's hands within twenty-four hours after it was known that I had come to grief. Don't flatter yourself that there is a single loophole left unclosed for you to wriggle through. For the last time, will you comply, or not?"</p>
               <p>"But, really," said Grenville, "I have no means of raising the money."</p>
               <p>"Then I will give you the means, poor craven that you are, if you have only the wit to use them," said Ronald, sneeringly. "Look here! Show this bit of writing to the precious father of your fair Mabel. Tell him you got it from a person who knew him twenty years ago or more, and then ask him for the loan of a couple of thousands or so—just as an advance, you understand. If he won't come out handsomely, let me know, and I'll give you another dose for him. But, mark me, no shuffling, or you'll rue it, for the few days you'll have to live."</p>
               <p>Grenville took the bit of paper. It was a soiled, crumpled slip, and merely bore the words—"From Lionel Beaumont to his darling Agatha."</p>
               <p>"What witch-like nonsense is this?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Try it, and you'll see," said Ronald; "and now, sit down and write the letter and the promise; and just call Fenton in to witness it. There's nothing like precaution, even among gentlemen."</p>
               <p>Grenville snatched a pen from the table, spurting a goodly quantity of ink over Ronald, either by accident or design, and scrawled a few lines in a half illegible hand, which he pushed impatiently to Ronald.</p>
               <p>"All right," said he. "It will stand good in law, no doubt; all the more genuine from being almost illegible; but I'll trouble you to make the friendly note you give me rather more readable, lest the eyes of my future father-in-law should be too much tried by the perusal."</p>
               <p>Grenville chafed, writhed under the grasp of his tormentor; but it was a useless struggle, and the fresh task was performed with somewhat more care, though with a hand that trembled too genuinely with the boiling passion within to give a very favorable result to his efforts. Then Ronald once more rang the bell for the servant, but had the grace to leave it to his master to give the order for which he had been summoned.</p>
               <p>"Fenton," said he, "witness my signature, and sign your own name."</p>
               <p>The man obeyed, but not without casting a quick, sharp glance at the line above the signature, which was the only one left visible, and then left the room.</p>
               <p>"Now I will wish you good-morning, Grenville," said Ronald, coolly. "I would advise you to try the witch spell, as you call it, on the worthy millionaire, as soon as possible. One never knows what may happen, and there is no time like the present."</p>
               <p>"Stay!" exclaimed Grenville, as Ronald turned to leave him. "I must have satisfaction on one more point before I use this wretched, discreditable scrawl. Why do you not try it yourself, if you have really power over this millionaire, as you call him? I will not, at any rate, walk into a trap with my eyes open."</p>
               <p>"I may have strong reasons, which have nothing to do with you," replied Ronald, quietly. "I pledge you my word that the worst which can befall you is the unpleasant spectacle of an elderly gentleman's agitation, and perhaps a few questions as to your knowledge of the lady to whom the interesting paper belonged; if so, you have only to say that you have considerable influence with the person who does possess the information, and that a few hundreds will materially assist that power. And now I must really tear myself away. You are scarcely so dull or daring, Captain Grenville, as to neglect my instructions. Good morning."</p>
               <p>"Ha, thought Ronald, as he walked carelessly from the house, "you dare no more disobey me, my gallant peer in embryo, than you dare, insult His Majesty in full court. Nor are you the only one in my nets; Beaumont, my honored father, Guildford, the two fair belles of the drama, and last, not least, the hero of the plot, my respectable father's <choice>

Capital <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ruse</foreign> of mine to disgust him with the paper; it would have spoilt matters if he had discovered the affair too soon—at least half a dozen illustrious personages, under the guidance and direction of Ronald of the Rath.

Courage and caution, and a few more months, will settle all."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVII.</head>
               <p>FREDERICK GRENVILLE was not altogether without the self-command and courage usually attributed to the descendants of an ancient race. In spite of the rage and terror which had shaken him during the morning, he appeared in the afternoon in St. James's Square with as gay and disengaged an air as if his whole thoughts and wishes had been centred in the fair girl and her father, who welcomed him as an integral part of their family circle.</p>
               <p>The only difference from Grenville's usual manner was a slight pensiveness of look and gentle gravity in his general tone of thought, which won him more favor than customary in Mabel's eyes. Never had he been more agreeable to her than on this evening; every sentiment he expressed, every look, every slight action which yet conveyed some well-understood deference to her known tastes and wishes, were all that could be desired by the most exacting woman. And once, just before she left the table, when some slight casual allusion was made to her former life in Dublin by her father, and a slight flush of painful memories colored her check, Grenville turned the subject so skilfully, and then drew her so adroitly into a topic which he knew would interest her, that Mabel could not refuse giving him an eloquent look of gratitude in return, as she passed him in her retreat from the room. And strangely enough, as she did so, she fancied, or she actually saw, a singular resemblance between him and Gerard Carlton. For the first time she could perceive, as the analysed the features of both, that they were indeed moulded in a strangely similar manner. The finely cut nose, the complexion, the hair, the mouth, were as like as if they had been brothers, save that the expression of the lips was so widely different, and the hair more swept from Gerard's noble brow than from Grenville's less open forehead. But in spite of these points of difference, Mabel had never seen the resemblance till now, when the half-sad, half-tender look recalled to her Gerard in the last moments of their intercourse, when their parting was near, and their fate so imminent. Never had she felt so softened to Frederick Grenville as at that moment; never did the possibility of passing her life with him appear so attractive, or at least so tolerable to her mind.</p>
               <p>It was a favorable opportunity for the young officer, and as it <choice>
                     <sic>happend</sic>
                     <corr>happened</corr>
                  </choice>, he was pressing his suit, though in a somewhat circuitous manner, with her father, as she sat musing over this strange coincidence in her lonely but luxurious drawing-room.</p>
               <p>"Fill your glass, Grenville," said Mr. Beaumont, cheerily, after Mabel had left them. "What ails you, man? you look as if either a lawyer or a lady had been treating you scurvily."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps your penetration has not deceived you, my dear sir," said Grenville, looking up with one of the ingenuous smiles that he could assume at will. "I am, I confess, extremely anxious, alarmed, desponding, with respect to both the formidable powers of society that you mention. Your fair, your much-loved daughter, has too complete an empire over me for my peace, unless I were more sanguine of gaining a return for my devotion."</p>
               <p>"Pooh, stuff, man!" said Mr. Beaumont. "Women are well enough, but a man is a deuced fool who lets them get master of him. Mabel shall be yours; I have promised it, and she dare not—will not—resist my will. Besides, your uncle seems to have completely won her heart, and I managed to get from her that she had made him a half promise in your favor. Come, pluck up heart, my good fellow, and empty your glass to Mabel's health."</p>
               <p>Frederick Grenville's pride was doomed to mortification on this memorable day. His fastidious high breeding revolted from the Yankee style of his future father-in-law, as much as his pride of birth blazed up in resentment at the insolence of the obscure brigand of the Rath; and it might probably have showed itself more unpleasantly to the purse-proud millionaire, had not the necessity of propitiating the man from whom he was about to ask so important a favor, restrained his haughty spirit. He drained the glass before him, and again sat for a few moments in gloomy silence.</p>
               <p>"What ails you, man?" at last exclaimed the impatient host. "If anything is wrong, for Heaven's sake out with it. It's about as pleasant sitting with you to-day, as supping with the statue in 'Don Giovanni.' You and Mabel have not quarrelled, I know, for I never saw you more like turtle doves than you were at dinner just now."</p>
               <p>"It's no use trying to deceive you, Mr. Beaumont, that's evident," said Grenville, with an affectation of reluctance. "And yet, though I have every confidence in your friendship and indulgence, it is so delicate a subject, so degrading a position to explain."</p>
               <p>"Hang delicacy and all that stuff, my good fellow!" exclaimed Mr. Beaumont; "out with it, and if I can help you, I will, for the sake of the future connection between us."</p>
               <p>"Then, to obey you, my dear sir, like a dutiful son," said Grenville, with a very bitter though intentionally affectionate smile, "I am in a fix for that article of which you cannot imagine the want. I have to pay two or three thousand pounds within the week, and have not a fifty-pound note at my command."</p>
               <p>A change that would have been ludicrous in other circumstances, came over the handsome face of the millionaire.</p>
               <p>"Why not ask your uncle?" said he; "he cannot hesitate, when his heir is in the question."</p>
               <p>"My good sir, I need not tell you that there are secrets and skeletons in every family," said Grenville. Lord Hargrave would not advance a farthing beyond my allowance till I am married, and I neither can nor will ask him."</p>
               <p>"Very sorry," said Mr. Beaumont, stiffly;" but the truth is, I make it a rule to keep all business transactions distinct from friendship; and till we come to the regular settlements and all that kind of thing, I am sorry to say, I think it would be dangerous to enter on the sort of transaction you propose."</p>
               <p>"Is this your final answer, Mr. Beaumont? You decline doing me this favor?" said Grenville.</p>
               <p>"My dear fellow," said Mr. Beaumont, "believe me, I am doing you the greatest favor in declining to risk our friendship by these little pecuniary transactions. A very short time will arrange all your affairs in a more satisfactory way. And now shall we go to Mabel? A lover's impatience will excuse our abruptness."</p>
               <p>"One moment, Mr. Beaumont," said Grenville. "I wanted to show you a curious little document that came into my possession a short time since, and which perhaps you have seen before."</p>
               <p>He took out the dirty slip of paper which Ronald had given to him, and held it before his host's eyes.</p>
               <p>Grenville was prepared for some decided effect to be produced by the "witch spell" of the young brigand, in spite of his affected contempt of its vaunted power; but he certainly did not expect the sudden and startling change in his host's face as he read the paper—the blood deserted cheek and lips, with as sudden a rush to the heart as it returned afterwards with alarming violence to the head. The wine-glass which he was just lifting to his lips fell with a crash on the table beneath, while its contents poured unheeded over his knees. So sudden and electrical a shock deprived him of even the power to seize the trifling object which had produced so extraordinary an effect; and when the returning sense of present objects brought with it the natural impulse to possess himself of the paper, Grenville had withdrawn it from his grasp.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Mr. Beaumont," said he, "but I am not at liberty to part with this little slip, worthless as it may appear. It does not belong to me, and I must return it to its rightful owner."</p>
               <p>"Who gave it to you?" gasped Beaumont. "But it cannot be—no. Death has long since claimed the owner of that paper, and no one but myself has a right to it. Give it me, I entreat, I insist."</p>
               <p>"You have proved to me that entreaties are not always to be granted, Mr. Beaumont," said Grenville, replacing the paper in his pocket-book. "I am quite satisfied now that my information was correct, and that you are the person in question. And now, if you please, we can join Miss May."</p>
               <p>"Stop, stop!" exclaimed Beaumont, eagerly; "I am not unreasonable; I only meant—that is, it is very like an old keepsake, but it's of no consequence, only I should like to have it, for old times' sake when I was young—young as yourself, Captain Grenville. Come, a joke's all very well, but you cannot be serious in refusing me such a trifle."</p>
               <p>"As serious as you were a few minutes since, Mr. Beaumont, in declining to grant me what was a trifle to you, but of vital consequence to me," replied Grenville. "I repeat, that paper is not mine to give, but it belongs to a person who is perfectly acquainted with the circumstances connected with it, and who requested me to ascertain whether you remembered the trifle, or not."</p>
               <p>"I do," replied Mr. Beaumont; "that is, of course it is so many years ago, and—But, Grenville, for Mabel's sake, don't be so revengeful. I only meant that you had better have all the wealth I have to give her as soon as all is settled, and not to have it piecemeal. You know I have so long had to do with money transactions that it makes them complete matters of business; so let's make this into a bargain. Give me that paper, and I will find you the money you want, and you must tell me from whom you got it, and what you know about it."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Mr. Beaumont," said Grenville, "that is impossible. All I can do in your behalf is to use all the influence I have with the person from whom I received it, and if you will empower me to make terms with him, I might perhaps prevail on him to comply with your wishes. But really my mind is too much occupied with my own affairs just now to be able to bestow much attention on yours."</p>
               <p>"My dear fellow," said Mr. Beaumont, "you shall soon be set at rest about that. I will manage your little matter for you in a day or two, if you will procure me the assurance—I mean the information I want—and if it is necessary to—if anything more is required—you understand."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I think I do," said Grenville, coolly; "at least, I do understand that this paper is connected with something of vital importance to you, Mr. Beaumont, and I should like to be satisfied that it has nothing in it that can affect the future connection between our families."</p>
               <p>"No, no, no," groaned Beaumont, with a shudder. "Mabel has no more to do with that affair than you have. For Heaven's sake, say no more, but lose no time in managing this for me, and the two thousand shall be ready in two days from this time."</p>
               <p>"I will do my best, Mr. Beaumont," repeated Grenville; "but it does not depend on myself. When I call on you for the cheque I will tell you the result of my negotiation.<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6520-00000064"/> Now I am quite ready to accompany you to the drawing-room."</p>
               <p>"I cannot go just yet," said Mr. Beaumont, with forced calmness. "Old memories have agitated me strangely. I shall be myself again presently. Do you go to Mabel, and I will follow in a short time. Say I have letters, anything to account for it, only not a word to her, I implore—I—"</p>
               <p>"Do not fear, Mr. Beaumont," said Grenville; Miss May is <choice>
                     <sic>the the</sic>
                     <corr>the</corr>
                  </choice> last person whose feelings I would wound. I will leave you to your own agreeable thoughts for the present."</p>
               <p>With a careless nod the young man left the room.</p>
               <p>"No bad shot that," he thought;" and now, if I could bring Mabel to the point, it will be a regular red-letter day in my calendar, black as it seemed this morning."</p>
               <p>Never, as we before said, could Grenville have found Mabel in a softer or more propitious mood than when he joined her so unexpectedly after her entrance into the drawing-room. It was rarely that Mr. Beaumont either left the dining-room, or permitted his guests to do so, till after a more than sufficient quantum of wine had been discussed, according to his daughter's ideas, and Grenville's speedy and solitary presence brought a conscious flush to the girl's cheek. She thought, she feared, that it could have but one object, and there was a soft flutter in her look and manner which was the best augury her lover could have desired. Nor was he slow in taking advantage of the propitious moment.</p>
               <p>"Mabel, pardon my abruptness," said he, "but I have waited so long, and I am too much in earnest to find soft words, or study etiquette; I must trust to my honest sincerity, the depth of my feelings, to find favor in your eyes, not to fine phrases or empty protestations; Mabel, I love you deeply and truly. Will you be my wife?"</p>
               <p>Oh, the perversity of human nature, that makes the heart rebel and shrink from an offered possession with loathing and disgust, in spite of previous resolutions. Mabel had determined to forget Gerard Carlton, and to prove that she had done so by accepting Frederick Grenville; Lord Hargrave's entreaties, her father's more peremptory hints and injunctions, and her own pride, had all tended to this result. "She would do so when"—yes, "at some future time, but not yet; it was too soon—too unnecessary abruptness."</p>
               <p>Such had been Mabel's reasonings whenever she had asked herself her real intentions on this subject; and but a few moments before a more gentle and happy feeling as to the possibility of carrying them out had come over her changing moods. And now, when they were put to the test, and a reply, real, immediate, final, was demanded, a reply which she felt Grenville had a right to ask, an ungovernable repugnance came over her with sickening power. She "could not," at least "not yet."</p>
               <p>Grenville ventured to touch Mabel's hand as it lay cold and trembling on the arm of the chair in which she sat, and the sudden withdrawal was too abrupt for mere maiden shyness.</p>
               <p>"Have I offended by my suddenness?" he said. "Perhaps it was abrupt; but then I know that my uncle had pleaded for me long since; and surely it was not strange that I should impatiently wait my answer. Will you not speak it, Mabel?"</p>
               <p>The girl was perfectly self-possessed now; any sort of implied reproach roused her spirit in a moment.</p>
               <p>"If you wish it, certainly, Captain Grenville," she replied; "and perhaps it might be better for both that the reply I should now give should be the final one. It is soon spoken if you desire it now; only I wish Lord Hargrave to know that I had not broken my promise to wait till the time for which he pleaded."</p>
               <p>"Then you would not refuse me now, Mabel?" said Grenville.</p>
               <p>"I should," she replied.—</p>
               <p>"For what reason?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"The best a woman can give," replied Mabel—"that I do not feel we should be certain, or even likely to be happy."</p>
               <p>"And why not?" he asked. "Our ages, rank, tastes, and habits are the same. I love you as deeply as ever woman was loved; and you would soon return that affection, from mere force of sympathy. It is a mere girlish, graceful caprice, dearest Mabel, unworthy of your fine character; though anything that you feel or say is charming in my eyes. But, indeed, I have done penance long enough, waited, and watched, and hoped, till I can bear suspense no longer. Do not be too tyrannical, my beautiful, queenly love!"</p>
               <p>"It is no caprice—no despicable coquetry," said Mabel. "I cannot control my feelings at pleasure, and though I fully confess the truth of all you say as to your own claims, I cannot love you, nor—"</p>
               <p>"But if I am content with your regard and esteem, and trust to a warmer feeling coming with time, and my earnest endeavors to deserve it?" said Grenville.</p>
               <p>"Then leave it to time," said Mabel. "Believe me it will be wisest for both of us to forget the last few minutes."</p>
               <p>Frederick Grenville had schooled himself in anticipation to meet almost every possible reception from Mabel, without losing temper or self-control. He had a far deeper scheme for his future tactics than lover-like reproaches, or the passionate, bitter taunts with which he could have repaid her cutting indifference. But had she studied to wound and exasperate him to the highest pitch, she could scarcely have chosen a more adroit mode of working up his passions till all previous wise resolutions should vanish under their heat.</p>
               <p>The complete indifference, the cool determination of Mabel's manner was galling to Grenville's proud temper beyond his utmost calculation. He sprang up suddenly, walked rapidly up and down the large apartment for some moments, firmly compressing his lips, lest the bitter anger that rankled in his heart might find vent in words which could never be recalled or remedied. The violent movement of his limbs appeared a relief to his indignation, or some cooling reflection quieted the tumult of rage and disappointment, for the expression of his features gradually changed, and when he sat down again near Mabel, there was nothing but calm and even dignified regret in either tone or manner.</p>
               <p>"I am going to risk your displeasure—your suspicious, Mabel," said he; "but it is due to you to return your candor with equal frankness, even at the risk of having unworthy motives attributed to me. I have sometimes thought that there is another obstacle besides mere indifference to myself, which makes you so reluctant to listen to me, and that some one, or rather that a person whom I know too well, had been more fortunate than myself. I will not call him happier, because I would not change with him. Whatever you may feel now, you cannot continue to love one so unworthy of you; and for your sake I would risk grieving, even displeasing you, rather than that you should be deceived. You have strength of mind, lofty principle beyond the usual run of women; you can bear the truth. Pardon the pain I give you, but Gerard Carlton is a dishonored and dishonorable man, deeply involved in debt, which he cannot pay, and mixed up with discreditable transactions which will soon be made public. It is truth, Mabel, I tell you. Do not blame me for the errors of another, however much they may pain you."</p>
               <p>Mabel had cowered down in her chair while Grenville spoke, as if struck by some violent and sudden pain, that she would yet bear uncomplainingly; her eyes were bent on the floor, hidden by the deep lashes too heavily for the troubled look of pain to be visible, and her small ear which was turned towards Grenville, as her averted head strove more and more to hide itself from his gaze, was burning scarlet.</p>
               <p>Grenville had tact enough to rise and walk to the other end of the room, till the first humiliation and sharp pain had past, and then returned with a frank, open seriousness of his face and tone, very different from either pity or resentment.</p>
               <p>"I have said enough," he began "and too much, if it has displeased you. Time will prove my words to be correct; and, whenever you wish, I will answer any questions you like to put. And then, Mabel, if I may venture once more to plead my own cause, I—"</p>
               <p>"Stop, Captain Grenville," said Mabel, in a low, but calm tone. "Do not touch on that subject again to-night. I have perhaps been unjust to you, but I will not be false. Leave it to time. Heaven knows what a few weeks, even a few days, may bring to light. I will not be rash again in my judgments, to repent as bitterly as I do now."</p>
               <p>Without giving time for Grenville to reply, Mabel rang the bell, and ordering coffee to be brought, went to the piano, and began playing she knew not what, but that which effectually prevented any further attempt on her companion's part to continue the conversation. But he could see her pale face quivering as her fingers went unconsciously over the keys, and the large tears that were with difficulty forced back from the eyelids under which they trembled; and with a gentle "Good-night, Miss May," that scarcely needed a reply, he quietly left the room, well satisfied with his evening's work.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</head>
               <p>"MR. CARLTON in?" said a shabby, suspicious-looking man, advancing into the room where Gerard Carlton sat, striving to collect his thoughts for the duties of his office, though the near approach of the day which Mr. Milner had appointed as the last of his reprieve was not very favorable to the precision and clearness of his ideas.</p>
               <p>"Yes, there he is, though he does not look very wide awake if you have any particular business with him," laughed a lighthearted junior, who sat near the door.</p>
               <p>The man walked steadily to the desk where Gerard sat, and took a formidable-looking paper from his pocket, which he unfolded before him with one hand, while the other was laid familiarly on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>"I have a writ against you, Mr. Gerard Carlton, for the sum of three hundred pounds, on an acceptance given by you, and dishonored on presentation, and two pound ten for expenses incurred in consequence."</p>
               <p>Carlton was young, very young, and so completely inexperienced in all business matters, that the routine of the simplest legal process like this was a mystery to him.</p>
               <p>"I do not exactly understand you," he said, with a parched, dry utterance that almost made the words unintelligible; "what you have to say to me had better be done elsewhere."</p>
               <p>He rose to leave the room, where the wondering and half-scornful looks of his companions were fast bringing the burning blood to his brain, already fevered with long anxiety and distress.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, that is quite certain," replied the man, laughing scornfully. "We shall<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6520-00000065"/> finish it elsewhere, no doubt, my young master, unless you have got the money handy. You don't suppose it is finished all in a moment, do you, without the dibs forthcoming?"</p>
               <p>"I suppose that this insolence is unnecessary," said Carlton; "whatever is your duty I shall not resist, and that is enough."</p>
               <p>"Hem! well, I don't mind a little blaze from a young gentleman like you," said the man, more civilly. "It's hard on a swell at your age to be caught up so soon for a bit of folly. But come along, it's well first as last, and if you've any message to leave, these young chaps that are grinning away for nothing, will take it, I dare say. They'll perhaps get their turn in time, and they don't look half such thorough-breds as you after all."</p>
               <p>The insulted clerks sullenly received Gerard's half-muttered explanation of his enforced absence to be transmitted to Mr. Milner, and without a word of sympathy or inquiry as to his destination, or probable chances of emancipation from his present durance, let him depart alone with his rough companion.</p>
               <p>"I always thought him a confounded upstart," said one. "Some base born sprig of the aristocracy," said another. "Another chance of promotion," laughed a third; "I've no objection if half-a-dozen others were conveyed away as neatly."</p>
               <p>"Then the work of the day was resumed, and Gerard Carlton and his troubles soon passed from their thoughts or conversation. Meanwhile the young man had gladly accepted the good humored proposal of his companion to take a coach, instead of walking through the streets.</p>
               <p>"Where am I going?" asked Carlton, whose ideas of the places of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">duresse</foreign> in London were somewhat confused, and who had vague notions of Newgate as the most common and formidable abode of the kind of which he had heard.</p>
               <p>"Oh, we'll give you a chance, and let you spend a night or so at a sponging-house, before you go to prison," said the man. "I can't believe that a young gentleman like you won't have friends to come forward; and its awkward to say you've seen the inside of anything worse than a lodging, as you may perhaps see."</p>
               <p>"It's no use, my friend," said Carlton, dejectedly. "There is no chance of my being able to meet the claim against me. I won't give you the trouble of changing my place of imprisonment. Better the worst at once."</p>
               <p>"Now that's just like young gentlemen like you," returned the man, "always in extremes—running off like a racehorse one month, without knowing where to stop, and then sinking like a horse in a bog. Just be guided by me, and let me take you to my friends in Queen Street—a decent place for one of that sort, and not over extortionists, considering; and then I'll get a note sent anywhere, and make things easy and pleasant, for you see I've a kind heart of my own; I don't like to see such a frank-looking, handsome young man in trouble. There's plenty of them as are used to these things; but I can see with half an eye it's the first time you got into that old harpy's clutches."</p>
               <p>"What harpy, my good fellow?" said Gerard, roused from his apathy by the man's words.</p>
               <p>"Why, Mr. Blamire, to be sure," replied the man. "He's well known in our line as the greatest rascal in London, in his own particular style of business. I only wish he was in quod, as a thief and swindler, which he is, sure enough."</p>
               <p>Gerard asked no more, but he had heard enough to explain the whole tissue of villany of which he had been the victim. Grenville was of course well acquainted with the character of the man to whom he had introduced him, and arranged the whole scheme by which he had been ruined. The only inexplicable part of the affair was, the motive which had induced Lord Hargrave's nephew to aim, from the first hour of their acquaintance, to accomplish the destruction of his prospects and character. Was it jealousy of his lordship's patronage, or of Mabel May's former regard for him? The latter idea was discarded as too wild for a moment's thought. Grenville could scarcely have even known of his acquaintance with Mabel May when he first commenced his operations; and as Gerard bitterly reflected, there was little cause now for any feeling but triumph over a discarded rival. And yet a hundred trifling words, and actions, and hints, recurred to Gerard's mind, which strengthened his conviction that Grenville had from the first planned and systematically worked out his utter ruin; and again returned the yet unanswered question to his mind, "Could there be any circumstances connected with himself of which he was still ignorant, which made his removal from any contact with either Grenville or his uncle an object of anxiety to the former?"</p>
               <p>The sudden stoppage of the coach put an abrupt end to a train of thought which, for the moment, almost diverted the unfortunate <foreign xml:lang="FRA">détenu's</foreign> mind from his immediate position.</p>
               <p>"There, sir; here we are," said the man; "and not such a bad place either, considerin, 'specially when I say a good word for the lodgers as I bring my friends. There, walk in, and I'll tell them to put you in the best room and bring you pen and ink to write to your friends, and I'll warrant you'll soon be all right again."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, my friend; but—"</p>
               <p>Gerard was about to say "I shall write to no one," when the thought of his promise to Adeline Rivers flashed across his mind. Yes, he would relieve himself by telling her all; he should neither feel degradation, nor appear to ask for help, by confessing to her all his folly and the utter ruin to which it had led. He had felt, ever since their explanation, a strange attraction, a clinging to the beautiful girl who was indeed the only friend left to him in whom he could trust. He did not love her; he felt more strongly than ever that not all her beauty and attractions and sympathy for himself could excite the slightest wish in his heart to make her his wife. And yet he turned to her in his hour of sorrow as the sole friend in whom he could confide—the only person who would give a tear to his misfortune, or believe in his innocence.</p>
               <p>"I will accept your kindness, my friend," said Gerard, after being ushered in a dirty, shabby furnished parlor, which was the "show-room," of the abode. "I have one letter I should wish to write and have sent as soon as possible, if you will manage it for me; and here is a trifle for the trouble and the kindness you have shown me."</p>
               <p>He put a crown in the man's hand as he spoke, and then hastily closing the door, he threw himself in a chair, and laying his head on the table before him, sobbed aloud.</p>
               <p>That burst of grief was no disgrace to Gerard's manhood. He was so young; his whole life had so little prepared him for such a climax to his troubles; his youthful aspirations and resolutions had been so joyous, and noble, and lofty in their aims. Mr. Seaforth had exhorted him to win a name, to conquer fate and fortune and disappoint the adverse influences of his birth. And this was the result. The ruined tenant of a prison; the accused partaker in a fraud; the disgraced recipient of Lord Hargrave's kindness had nothing now to hope or anticipate but an early grave. No wonder that his long harassed and tortured nerves gave way at last, and that a violent burst of suppressed, hopeless misery came to relieve his brain from the burning, maddening despair that threatened to overpower him.</p>
               <p>It was but for a few moments that Gerard yielded to this weakness; he was no unmanly, despicable coward, and now that the crisis of his fate had come, and his worst fears were realised, a sort of desperate courage came to his aid. If there was nothing to hope, there was nothing to fear more, and he could but brace his energies to endure the remainder of the punishment he had brought on himself.</p>
               <p>"Here you are, sir," sounded again in his ears, in the bailiff's rough but not unkindly tones, "and I'll trouble you to look sharp; for you see I've not much time, and I'd like to see it off myself, or mayhap I might deliver it if it is in town."</p>
               <p>Gerard took the pen laid before him, and wrote a few hurried lines to Adeline—what, he hardly knew; but they would at least redeem his promise, and explain his absence and his present and future danger.</p>

                           <p>"Forget your unfortunate friend, dear Adeline," he concluded. "You cannot aid me, and I would not add to my other errors that of clouding your spirits by a thought of misfortunes which you can do nothing to remedy. Believe in my brotherly affection, my gratitude for the only disinterested kindness I have known in this vast solitude, and accept my earnest prayers for your happiness.</p>

               <p>"All right, sir; the young lady shall have it before an hour's over," said the man; "and I'll stake my next fees that you'll be out in forty-eight hours; take an old hand's word for it, sir."</p>
               <p>Gerard gave a melancholy smile to the prediction, but still it was a smile, and against his better judgment; he could not help attaching some unacknowledged credence to the man's confident assurance. But the momentary gleam of light soon faded away, and left all dark and gloomy as before.</p>
               <p>Hours passed away, and no note, no visit; scarcely the sound of a voice broke the monotony of his enforced solitude. The light faded into twilight, the twilight into darkness, and then the woman of the house brought in lights and asked Gerard if he would have a bed-room, as he seemed likely to stay all night. He accepted the proposal, and followed the hostess up a narrow, wooden staircase, to a small back room, furnished with an uncurtained bed, a set of deal drawers, a wash-hand stand to match, two broken chairs, and a piece of worn carpet on each side the bed.</p>
               <p>"It's five shillings the night to most gentlemen, sir," said the woman; "but as Mr. Matthews recommended you particularly, we'll say four, and nothing for the bed-candle, which I call handsome."</p>
               <p>Gerard assented with the apathy which a great sorrow naturally produces in all minor things, and the woman retired, turning the key as she did so. A sharp pang shot through the young man's brain at the sound; it was a trifle, but it so completely realized the idea that he was a prisoner, that it grated painfully on his nerves, and with an impatient movement he turned back the bed-clothes, the arrangement of which did not seem to be included with the bed-candle in the four shillings. The aspect of the sheets and pillows was decidedly indicative of other favored tenants of the room having used them before himself, and with a shudder of disgust he tore off the counterpane and blanket, and wrapping himself in them, threw himself on the bed in his clothes, and prepared to pass, as he best might, the long hours of that weary night.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIX.</head>
               <p>IT was noon, on the following day when Mabel May's maid opened the door of her little boudoir, with a face of unwonted importance and mystery.</p>
               <p>"If you please, miss," said she, "a lady wishes to see you, and will not give her name; she says you will not know it, but yet she must see you."</p>
               <p>Mabel had become somewhat nervous and apprehensive of late, and the idea of an unknown visitor agitated her, though she could scarcely have explained why. Her father had appeared strangely gloomy and excited for the last few days, and that very morning had expressed a wish that she would deny herself to visitors during the morning, as he might possibly require her presence himself and did not choose that she should be engaged when he did so.</p>
               <p>"Desire the lady to send in her name," said Mabel. "I am not well, and if her business is not urgent, I should much prefer seeing her to-morrow, or if she would write."</p>
               <p>"It is urgent," said a voice of extreme sweetness and refinement, that bespoke the speaker to be a lady, though the large cloak and double veil effectually concealed her figure and face; "so much so that I know it will plead my excuse for intruding on you so rudely, lest you might send a denial."</p>
               <p>Mabel hesitated, but the accents of the voice, and the whole manner, were so earnest and yet so soft and gentle, that she could not resist the petition, though the very singularity of such an intrusion from a woman of evident grace and refinement added to her tremor.</p>
               <p>"Leave the room, Davis," said Mabel to her maid; then, pointing to a seat near her own for the unknown visitor, she added, "forgive my asking you to explain your business as briefly as possible."</p>
               <p>"I will," replied the stranger, throwing back her veil, and displaying a face of great beauty, and which though unknown to Mabel, was none other than the lovely countenance of Adeline Rivers. "I am come to tell you what I believe it imports you much to hear; and, if I judge you rightly, will make you thank me for taking so unusual a step."</p>
               <p>She paused a moment, for Mabel turned very pale, and Adeline saw that a too abrupt disclosure might be more than she could hear with composure. And there they sat, those two beautiful girls, so strangely connected yet unknown to each other, gazing with a sort of wonder at each other's beauty, and half unconscious of the admiration that each excited in the other. But there was a calm determination in Adeline's features, a resolute will, which spoke of a character that had been trained to self-reliance and independent action, while Mabel's pale, troubled face, though indicative to an observer of womanly self-control and dignity, yet had a softness and feminine dependence in its expression that betokened a gentler, more careful training than that of her beautiful visitor.</p>
               <p>"It is the first time I have seen you, Miss May," said Adeline at last; "but I know you well from those who love and those who seem to love you; and they have not spoken falsely of the outward beauty of their idol. I am going to put to the proof the courage and generosity which they attributed to you."</p>
               <p>"If you know me," said Mabel, "I must surely have heard of you, though I do not know your face. Let me know to whom I am speaking before you tell me your errand. Who are you, and from whom have you heard of me?"</p>
               <p>"My name is Adeline Rivers," she replied; "but the only person from whom you would be likely to have heard my name, would be the last who would talk to you of me, or let you know even of my very existence. And, what is more, you must promise me never to mention my name to any human being, till I give you leave, nor say how you became possessed of the information I am about to give you. Will you promise me this?"</p>
               <p>"It is a strange request," said Mabel, "and from one so entirely unknown to me."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps so," said Adeline; "but there can be no more risk in your keeping secret what I request you not mention, than in not hearing it yourself. And all depends on your consent; the safety of one, innocent and most injured, whom you once loved, or affected to love; your own happiness, and it may be that of others besides yourself, may be secured by a prompt and decisive action on your part. Will you hesitate from a foolish punctilio to secure all these?"</p>
               <p>"You ask me to believe much on your bare word, Miss Rivers," said Mabel with a simple dignity that contrasted forcibly with Adeline's vehement energy. "You forget that we are total strangers, and that I do not even know to whom you allude."</p>
               <p>"Is that true? Can you say that from your heart?" interrupted Adeline. "I thought a woman's love was ever quick enough to detect any allusion to its object."</p>
               <p>Mabel's cheeks flamed scarlet; but her soft thoughtful eyes looked reproachfully at her questioner.</p>
               <p>"You are young like myself—a woman, and a lovely one," she said; "can you trifle so wantonly with the most sacred delicacy of our common sex, as to speak so cruelly of such feelings, when they have been long very long crushed as unworthy? If you allude to Mr. Carlton, it is either from ignorance of the past, or a cruel outrage on my delicacy, to talk of love."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me," said Adeline, softly—"I did not do it from either motive; I wished to see whether you were deceived as he has been, and to test your feelings before telling you more. I am satisfied. If you would confess the truth, you have not forgotten the past any more than Gerard himself; and you will do much for his sake."</p>
               <p>Mabel's cheeks were cold as ice now, and her whole frame shivered with anxious suspense, and proud fear of being again deceived.</p>
               <p>"Go on," she said, "since if you know so much, spare me pain, if you can, and tell me all you have to say."</p>
               <p>"Tell me first whether your rejection of Gerard Carlton was from an unworthy contempt of his doubtful birth, or from some more sufficient reason?" said Adeline, gravely.</p>
               <p>"I did not even know that Mr. Carlton's family or birth had the slightest stain resting on them when I first changed my feelings and manner towards him," replied Mabel, sadly: "but that change has been but too well justified by his conduct since. He deserted a gentle and loving girl for me; and now he has forgotten me for another, rich and beautiful, as they tell me. I have forgiven him long since; but I should be weak and despicable to cherish one regret for such a worthless love as his."</p>
               <p>"Is it not weakness to be at the mercy of idle calumnies or interested representations, Miss May?" said Adeline, warmly. "Poor Gerard! it were well for him if he were as light and changeable as you paint him; he would not have suffered so deeply, nor been driven to drown thought in follies which have brought him to disgrace and a prison."</p>
               <p>Mabel turned very pale, and her lips moved, without having power to utter a sound save a faint moan, that pleaded more for her than words with the eager champion of Gerard Carlton.</p>
               <p>"Listen, Miss May," continued Adeline—"you need not look so terror-stricken if you are indeed the true-hearted girl I am inclined to believe you. Words may deceive, but scarcely such an expression as yours; and I believe you will save Gerard if you can, ay, and give him the assurance which would make him thank you for such assistance. Gerard Carlton has always loved you as truly and constantly as a woman can wish to be loved; and if you have been led to believe anything else of him, it is a slander. The rich and beautiful object of his supposed affection is one for whom I can speak with some certainty—it is my poor self, Mabel May, between whom and Gerard not one feeling inconsistent with his love for you has ever existed. It is to me that he has confided all his bitter suffering at your cold, scornful rejection of his honest love, instead of any such imaginary treachery to you, as you have been told. Is this enough, Mabel May? Are you satisfied?"</p>
               <p>"And he does not love you?" said Mabel, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Be satisfied," said Adeline; "he is, always has been, true to you; even in the hour of his deepest sorrow your name is ever present to his thoughts. And now, read this."</p>
               <p>She held out to Mabel a part of a newspaper, with one paragraph marked, "<hi rend="i"/>Frauds in the Civil Service:"—</p>
               <p>"We regret to say that extensive embezzlements have been just discovered in the Custom House. One of the old servants of the establishment, who has long held the post of cashier, has just absconded with a considerable sum of the Government money. And, what makes the affair more to be regretted, there is reason to fear that a young and promising clerk, who was not long since placed in a situation, both lucrative and full of trust, through the influence of a noble lord, has succumbed to the temptation and shared alike in the profits and the guilt. But, till the investigation is complete, it would be premature to enter into any further particulars."</p>
               <p>"I need not tell you to whom that refers," said Adeline, taking the paper from Mabel's shaking hand, "nor that he is innocent of aught but imprudence, which will probably be fatal to his future career; at any rate, in the one chosen for him. And now, read this."</p>
               <p>Mabel mechanically took the note poor Gerard had written from the sponging house in his despair and agony, and now her big tears dropped fast on the paper, and almost blinded her power of reading the half illegible characters.</p>
               <p>"Is it too late?" she asked. "Oh, Miss Rivers, help me to save him! You are clever, firm, quick-witted. What is to be done? I have money; I can give you what you want, only save him from that horrible place, and never let him know from whom the money came."</p>
               <p>Adeline was silent and thoughtful for a time. At length she said, "That would be difficult. I cannot let him imagine that the money is mine, even if he would accept it if he did; and yet he says expressly he has not let any one but me know of his trouble. But I agree with you, Miss May, that unless you are prepared to give him what is far more precious to him than your whole fortune, he must not have the mortification of thinking that you have known and saved him from his disgraceful position."</p>
               <p>"I cannot yet do that," said Mabel, with touching humility. "It is not from pride nor doubt of your word, Miss Rivers; but I know it would only be torturing us both to dream of such an impossibility. You have removed one bitter sorrow from my heart. I can think of Gerard now without shame and bitterness, and not feel that I forgot womanly pride and delicacy when I returned his love. But now our paths are different in life, and his wisest course would be to forget me, and try to love some one more able<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6520-00000067"/> to make him and herself happy than I can, unless—"</p>
               <p>"Unless what?" said Adeline.</p>
               <p>"I were my own mistress," replied Mabel, "or Gerard in the position of—"</p>
               <p>"Captain Grenville, perhaps," burst in Adeline, indignantly. "And is it for such poor, weak, interested love as this that a man like Gerard Carlton has sacrificed his every chance of happiness and prosperity? Mabel May, you are not worthy of him."</p>
               <p>"Am I not?" said Mabel, with quiet dignity. "It is far truer love to crush my own heart's dearest wishes and hopes for his sake, than to indulge the transient and selfish delight of mutual though secret love, only with the certainty of a stinging and fatal awakening from such a vain dream. No, Adeline Rivers, tell him, if you will, that I have suffered as much as himself; tell him that my heart's deepest prayers are for his happiness, but that there is no human probability of our meeting but as mere friends, or rather apparent strangers. But enough of this. We must think of his present emergency, what is to be done for him, and quickly, or he will lose his reason in that wretched place."</p>
               <p>"When can you command the money?" said Adeline, in her firm, quiet tones.</p>
               <p>"To-day," replied Mabel, "or to-morrow at furthest."</p>
               <p>"I will not trust any one," said Adeline. "I will go myself to him, learn what is necessary to free him from all difficulties, and tell him that I have the means of procuring it from a mutual friend; and then, when all is over, and he is once more free, and safe from open disgrace and difficulty, I will give him the warning that you send him. And now, how shall I communicate with you? I dare not come to you again, and it is dangerous to trust to others in such matters. Can I meet you?"</p>
               <p>"I am afraid not," replied Mabel; "I am so watched, especially of late; but something must be risked. I will be in Kensington Gardens to-morrow morning by eleven, if you can meet me there; I will bring you a cheque, which you can fill up at pleasure. It is the first time I ever realised the value of the money which I have hitherto thought a curse."</p>
               <p>"So be it then," said Adeline, rising. "Mabel May, you have saved yourself as well as Gerard from misery. Had you proved false and selfish, I would have left you to your fate; but now, whatever happens, I will be your friend, and, when you least expect it, avert from you the danger that threatens you from an unscrupulous, bad man. Farewell."</p>
               <p>She stooped down, touched Mabel's cheek with her lips, and before the astonished girl could recover the surprise which her visitor's words occasioned, she was gone, and Mabel, almost mechanically, rang the bell for a servant to conduct her to the door; but when Davis appeared, she stated, with a somewhat scandalised air, "that the strange lady had let herself out—she seemed quite accustomed to run about other folk's houses, it seemed."</p>
               <p>Mabel took little heed of the outraged proprieties of her maid. Her mind was too full of sweet and sad thoughts even to comprehend the flippant comment on her strange visitor; she only felt one engrossing, bewildering consciousness that she was beloved, and that her too easy credulity had brought ruin on her lover.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XL.</head>
               <p>"ADELINE, you here in this wretched place!" groaned Gerard Carlton, starting back as he entered his humble little sitting-room on the following morning, and saw the beautiful girl sitting, quietly watching his coming, and looking like a being from another world in the midst of that cheerless scene. "It is kind, most kind; but, for Heaven's sake, do not remain a moment! It is madness, absolute madness, to risk so much for one so unworthy."</p>
               <p>"It is no risk to me," she said, sadly. "I can do this, and more than this, with impunity. Come, sit down, and listen to me. I am come for far more important matters than mere useless discussions on propriety."</p>
               <p>"But your mother?" began Gerard.</p>
               <p>"My mother!" repeated the girl, bitterly; "she cares little for what I choose to do, so long as it does not affect herself, and I have taken all necessary precautions, though for a very different object from what you imagine. Now, lose no more time in useless remonstrances, but tell me how much will cover your debts—I mean, to make you free and out of all future danger."</p>
               <p>"Too much to make your kind interest for me of any avail, dear Adeline," replied Gerard, with a melancholy smile; "you can do no good, but only compromise yourself for the sake of one who cannot—"</p>
               <p>"Gerard, I would leave you to your fate if I had not strong reasons for accomplishing your deliverance from the power of your greatest enemy!" exclaimed Adeline, stamping her little foot with sudden passion. "Do you suppose I am a fool, or a child, to meddle in matters that I cannot manage, or that I come here and put these questions for idle curiosity?" she added, pettishly; "we are wasting precious time in these absurdities. Will you treat me as a rational being and answer my question, or must I have the trouble of finding it out from others?"</p>
               <p>"It is idle to trouble you, dear Adeline," said Gerard; "but you have a right to be obeyed. I am in this horrid den for a debt of three hundred pounds; but there is a claim for as much again, which though unjust, it is necessary for my honor that I should meet."</p>
               <p>"Six hundred pounds!" repeated Adeline, coolly. "Well, you will need another hundred to free you from getting into another such foolish scrape, especially as you will, I believe, have to change your profession as a penalty for your folly. And now, give me the names and addresses of your creditors, and then I will obey your polite behest, and leave you."</p>
               <p>"Adeline, you cannot, you must not," began Gerard. "I am humiliated enough, but I cannot submit to such degrading pauperism as—"</p>
               <p>"Be content," said Adeline, impatiently interrupting him. "You are but receiving back a debt in accepting the assistance I shall obtain for you and for myself; if it will be any salve to you to know it, rest satisfied that you have done me a far greater service than I can return, by saving me from utter harshness and distrust of every human being that approached me. You have made me feel that there is truth and disinterested affection even in your treacherous sex, and softened the hardness that was coming over me, petrifying all the womanly feelings of my nature. Gerard, you may think me bold, unfeminine, reckless of everything but my own headstrong will, but you will perhaps alter your judgment of me when I can explain all that has acted on my conduct and altered my very nature."</p>
               <p>Gerard was deeply moved by Adeline's quiet earnestness and unwonted humility of manner. He understood the delicacy that prompted this confession, in his own hour of humiliation.</p>
               <p>"I think you generous, unselfish, and immeasurably superior to the usual petty fears and narrowness of your sex, dearest Adeline," said Gerard, taking the hand that had been unconsciously laid on his arm in her earnestness, and Mabel May herself could not have quarrelled with the impulse which made him press his lips on Adeline's small white palm. "I believe my honor is safe in your hands as my own—nay, safer, I have too much reason to say," he added sadly. "Do as you will, only remember that life has few charms for me now, and that the truest kindness may still be to leave me to suffer alone for the short time that may remain, in a world where I have no rightful place."</p>
               <p>"You can consider that afterwards," said Adeline, with a bright smile of satisfaction at her success. "Now, quick—the addresses. I have much to do before noon, and I have set my heart on your returning to your rooms before twenty-four hours are passed. They are rather more comfortable than these, I may presume, without any rash estimate of your taste in a residence."</p>
               <p>Gerard returned her gay smile with one that was decidedly more cheerful than any he had seen on her face for many a day past. In truth, with every possible respect for the higher feelings and nobler affections of human nature, it may very well be doubted whether a present personal and pressing trouble, like a writ for a dishonored bill, and the chance of starvation, or a prison afterwards, is not a more intolerable weight on the spirits than the disappointment of the truest affection that man ever felt. We grant that the latter may exert a lasting and most depressing influence over a whole life; but for wearing, present distress and terror, commend us to the debtor's prison, and the absence of any hope of release, or the prospect of brighter days.</p>
               <p>Gerard explained in a few words the danger he had incurred by Mr. Warren's fraudulent conduct, the alternative proposed by Mr. Milner, and then giving the girl the written directions she required, once more urged her to leave him.</p>
               <p>"It seems profanation for you to be here," he said; "I shall breathe more freely when you are gone."</p>
               <p>"I have ordered some breakfast to be sent up, as soon as you have got rid of me," she replied, laughing. "Money can do much, even here, it seems, and your <choice>
                     <sic>prepossesing</sic>
                     <corr>prepossessing</corr>
                  </choice> landlady assured me she could ensure good tea and fresh eggs for a consideration. Remember, I positively insist on its discussion with proper respect to my housekeeping abilities. Adieu, until to-morrow, when I expect to see you."</p>
               <p>Kissing her hand gaily to Gerard, Adeline disappeared. A dark-green, one-horse chaise was waiting at the door of the gloomy abode, and in an instant she was hidden in its recess, but not before she had been observed by a young and handsome man, who was lingering near the house. He laid his hand on the rein of the horse as the animal was just starting with a peremptory "Stop." Then approaching the door of the little carriage, he raised his hat with a graceful courtesy very unlike his abrupt order to the astonished driver.</p>
               <p>"Miss Rivers," he said," may I have the honor of escorting you from this uncomfortable region?"</p>
               <p>"I thank you, Mr. Saville; but I am perfectly well protected," she replied. "I should not have been here alone, had I wished for any escort."</p>
               <p>"Naturally," he said, with unmoved good humor; "but as I think I may be of material assistance in saving you any further trouble I must still press my request."</p>
               <p>Adeline was again about to refuse, with the proud impatient air she could assume at pleasure, when her mood seemed suddenly to change.</p>
               <p>"You shall have your fancy gratified, Mr. Saville, on one condition; that you obey<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6520-00000068"/> me when I suggest politely that I have had enough of your society, and that you do not quarrel with me if I do not choose to answer any questions as to my movements. True brigand style, you understand. A sort of blindfold, unquestioning dismissal at pleasure."</p>
               <p>Ronald's face flushed a rich crimson as the girl spoke, and his glittering eyes flashed like dark steel; but the complete unconsciousness of her careless manner took from the casual words any deeper meaning than they really conveyed, and he opened the carriage door and jumped in, with a bow and smile of gratified assent.</p>
               <p>In a few moments more the two were engaged in a deep and earnest conversation which seemed mutually interesting to both; though the proud spirit of the girl seemed to flash out from time to time as they spoke, and Ronald's deferential look and attitude seemed to deprecate her impatience.</p>
               <p>"It cannot be—such injustice cannot be suffered!" exclaimed Adeline, as the carriage stopped at last at the gate of the beautiful gardens, the celebrity of which as a rendezvous has survived to the present day.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me," said Ronald; "but it is vain to avoid or struggle against it. If you will leave it in my hands, all shall be done that is possible; and the object which I know, better than you imagine, to be your dearest wish, shall be accomplished, if you will have patience. I do not profess to be a disinterested, self-sacrificing fool, Miss Rivers; but, trust me, I shall be a far safer assistant in your well-merited scheme of <hi rend="i"/>punishment, we will call it, than Gerard Carlton, with his romantic folly. You shall hear from me in a very few hours."</p>
               <p>Ronald handed Adeline from the carriage, and walked rapidly in another direction, while Adeline slowly and thoughtfully entered the gates, and took her way to the spot where she was to meet Mabel May. It was rather earlier than the hour Mabel had appointed, and Adeline sat down on one of the most secluded seats, under the shade of a large tree, and drawing her thick, double veil closely over her face, abandoned herself to the train of busy thought to which the events of the past day or two gave such ample occupation.</p>
               <p>There were few persons in the gardens at that early hour, and Adeline was as solitary and undisturbed as if in the private grounds of a country mansion. But the very stillness made every sound come sharp and clear on the quiet. Summer air, and ere long the approach of footsteps on the gravel, and the tones of men's voices attracted the girl's attentions from her fit of musing. One of the voices sounded familiar to her, though she scarcely could have told when she could have heard it, so vague, and indistinct were the associations it called up; the other was entirely strange, and to her quick ear it sounded coarser and more plebeian than the one which had been so singularly suggestive of long forgotten days. They were speaking low and eagerly, and they had come almost into full view before Adeline could distinguish the words, with any intelligible connection. But the very association the voice recalled made her look with more eagerness at the speaker, and, secure in the shadow of the large tree under which she sat, and the imperviousness of her veil, she leaned cautiously forward to examine the persons as they approached.</p>
               <p>They were two men; and, as Adeline had before supposed, one appeared of far more aristocratic birth and station than the other, and as she got a perfect view of his features she was confirmed in her impression that they were not altogether unfamiliar to her. The handsome, classically cut outline, the fair, though somewhat bronzed skin, the very carriage of the head brought back some almost forgotten memory—dim, long past, till now utterly blotted out from her life's retrospect, but still strong and distinct enough to prevent any doubt in her mind of its reality.</p>
               <p>"I tell you, man, he had my very handwriting; some nonsense I was fool enough to put in a copy of poems. Deuce take the man who wrote it, and the one who found it! But, the thing to be settled is how much he knows, and who the fellow is; it's not—"</p>
               <p>Here the voice stopped, but to Adeline's strained fancy it sounded like the one most familiar, and once most dear to her—the name of her treacherous lover.</p>
               <p>"Well, I must say you were a fool to commit yourself, unless you made up your mind to stick to the woman. But is she living?"</p>
               <p>"Can't say for certain; but I believe not. All trace of her was lost years since, after he came back for her."</p>
               <p>Again the words became indistinct, and Adeline lost them in the distance. But a few more yards brought the men to the end of the walk, and apparently they turned when they had reached it, for a few minutes after the voices came nearer, though in another direction, and Adeline once more distinguished the coarser tones of the shorter man, saying, "But was there not a girl as well?"</p>
               <p>"What does it matter to you or me, if there was?" replied his companion, fiercely.</p>
               <p>"I've enough to do without troubling myself about other folk's secrets. I daresay the little imp was strangled or drowned like a blind kitten, for the old fellow was in a towering rage, and would not have believed her on her oath."</p>
               <p>"Who do you mean," asked the lesser man, with a sneer—"the child?"</p>
               <p>"No, the mother," was the reply; "he swore the child was not his, but—"</p>
               <p>Again the voices died away, and Adeline was again alone. But the former current of her thoughts was changed, and a vision of strange and early remembrances, or it might be fancies, rose up before her. The face of that handsome but unpleasing looking man—his very voice, brought back a picture of love and caresses, and a lovely though melancholy face—not that of her dashing, masculine mother—and a sweet peaceful home, which she either had known or dreamed of, but which had faded away in her more stirring and vivid after-life. But all was confused, kaleidoscope like, mingled with more present images, and before she had in any degree collected or defined her ideas the gentle step of Mabel May approached; yet, either she was haunted by some fanciful, fever-like image which turned all to its own likeness, or once more the same features which she had just seen, and which had so strangely stirred up these dim visions, came before her in a softened guise; for in Mabel's beautiful face she saw, or thought she saw, reproduced the feminine likeness of the stranger who had just passed her, and whose voice still sounded in her ears.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XLI.</head>
               <p>A FORTNIGHT had passed, and Gerard Carlton was once more free—free from prison, free from the load of debt and terror of impending danger, and, alas! free from official duties, and likewise from official income.</p>
               <p>Adeline Rivers had amply redeemed her promise. Within twenty-four hours the writ had been fully discharged and withdrawn, much to the delight of the worthy bailiff, who with great triumph reminded his <choice>
                     <sic>protègè</sic>
                     <corr>protégé</corr>
                  </choice> of his prediction that his friends would come forward; "but you were young in these things you see, sir," said he, and down in the mouth."</p>
               <p>Gerard acknowledged with a handsome gratuity, as well as sincere and frankly spoken thanks, the service the friendly adviser had given him; but when, at Adeline's earnest request, the young man presented himself at the Custom House, a different reception and ordeal awaited him.</p>
               <p>"I have a painful duty, Mr. Carlton, to discharge, but it must be done," said Mr. Milner gravely. Your repayment of the year's salary, and the absence of any positive proof of your collusion with Warren in his frauds, together with your youth, has induced the head of the office to abstain from any proceedings against you, or any public exposure of your imprudence. But the most lenient sentence they can inflict is, a dismissal from the service; and therefore from this time you are struck off from the roll of clerks employed in this or any other of the Government offices."</p>
               <p>Gerard indignantly asserted his entire innocence, and challenged the strictest inquiry that could be made into his conduct.</p>
               <p>"My dear sir, the matter is finally settled, and cannot again be opened," observed the chief clerk, sententiously. "I advise you to retire at once, and make as little scandal as possible. You may thank the influence that has been exerted for you, that so much leniency has been displayed in a somewhat aggravated case. I wish you good morning, and a more successful issue of the next career you may choose for yourself."</p>
               <p>Gerard left the office with a burning sense of injustice and insult that would have led to the wildest measures that could be devised for the vindication of his character; but Adeline, whose knowledge of the world was greater than that of the inexperienced young man, gradually schooled him into more rational views; and a new ally, no other than Ronald of the Rath, or, as he was known in England, Reginald Saville, came to his aid.</p>
               <p>"I owe you some reparation for the mischief I unconsciously did you, Carlton," was his frank acknowledgment on his again meeting with the young man; "and the best I can make at present is, to give you this piece of common sense—don't rake up muddy waters, but let them sink to the bottom, and in a few months' time no one will take the trouble to remember that you ever got into a scrape, or think the worse of you because a set of old numskulls knew they must sacrifice some white sheep since they could not get hold of the black one. Keep quiet, my good fellow, and let the wheel turn round; and it may be that somebody at the top may change places with you before many new moons, to use gipsy lingo."</p>
               <p>Gerard's own natural shrewdness recognised the truth of these remarks, though he attached little importance to Saville's vague hints. Adeline was equally mysterious in her cheering prophecies, and impervious to any attempt on Gerard's part to discover the source from which she had obtained the sum necessary to free him from his late difficulties. He could only imagine that it had come from Lord Hargrave; and the conviction brought with it an unconquerable repugnance to taking any step towards bringing himself under that nobleman's notice in his present position.</p>
               <p>Lord Hargrave had already done too much; he had procured him a lucrative situation, rescued him from a most imprudently incurred danger, and it would be only a degrading imposition on his goodness to ask another favor at his hands. He contented himself with informing his noble patron, in a few brief lines, that circumstances had obliged him to give up his situation; and again expressed his respectful gratitude for his lordship's past kindness.</p>
               <p>No answer was received, and Gerard naturally concluded that he had offended Lord Hargrave past forgiveness by his apparent unworthiness of patronage. Time wore on; his slender stock of money diminished fast, and every day brought to him more strongly<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6520-00000069"/> the conviction that he must perforce confess his errors to his mother, and thus add to her already deep causes of sorrow and anxiety for her only child. But Adeline, for some unexplained reason, urged him to defer the disclosure till her departure from London, which was to take place in a few weeks. Guildford had already left town for Garron's Hill, and Reginald Saville was to escort Mrs. and Miss Rivers thither, as soon as the arrangements for their reception were complete.</p>
               <p>"And when we are really gone, Gerard, you must just console yourself with a trip into Devonshire," said Adeline, with a smile.</p>
               <p>"And do you know, Mr. Beaumont and his daughter are about to take up their residence there, and Frederick Grenville's regiment is ordered to Taunton; so that you will possibly come in contact with your old friends."</p>
               <p>"That bitter jest is not like you, Adeline," said Gerard, reproachfully.</p>
               <p>"It is serious earnest," said Adeline. "Have I not told you again and again that there may be strange events in store for you, if you will but be patient. And one that is not in the future, or I am sorely mistaken, is the marriage of Frederick Grenville and Mabel May. If it is any consolation for you to believe it, be assured, if there is power in a strong will and firm purpose, that sacrifice shall never take place.</p>
               <p>Gerard left the Riverses' house that afternoon with a more dissatisfied feeling than Adeline intended her words should produce. He was restless, annoyed, impatient at his enforced inaction, and the determined veil of mystery thrown by Adeline over circumstances of which her knowledge appeared so singularly superior to his own. He was exasperated at being kept in ignorance of a woman's plans and purposes, and his natural energy and activity of mind chafed under the dull, monotonous suspense and patience to which he was condemned.</p>
               <p>"I will endure it no longer," he thought, as he walked rapidly along; "I am fast sinking into the weak puppet of others' wills, the very sport of circumstances. Better the most threatening danger, the most acute suffering, than this degrading waste of the energies and powers of my nature. I will wait no longer in the obscure, bewildering twilight in which there appears a combination to keep me. My mother cannot refuse to give me the information which is now more than ever essential to me, and when I know the truth, I will brace up my powers to bear the worst, and meet the fate which is in store for me. It is the uncertainty and suspense which have been my destruction."</p>
               <p>Gerard went on towards Regent's Park, the fever of his excited thoughts and feelings quickening his pace, and engrossing him too completely for him to take much note either of the distance he traversed or the direction in which he was going, till he found himself on the borders of Hampstead Heath, just as the sun was fast setting, and the first shades of evening falling on the lonely common. He walked on more slowly, as the still silence of the place, and the determination to which he had at last come, somewhat calmed the feverish tumult of his mind.</p>
               <p>Hampstead Heath was as different then from what it is now, as the whirling railway carriage which conveys the traveller to his destination, is different from the sober old stage-coach of that era. Not a house was in sight; the rich green grass, the thick bushes and shrubs, the uneven mounds, which in places aspired to the dignity of hillocks, and the deep ditches which intersected it in places, were all untouched by ruthless hands. The place was still and secluded, even wild in its aspect, as if the miles distant from London could be counted by tens instead of units, and Gerard threw himself on the grass at the foot of one of the most thickly planted mounds of earth, and yielded himself to the dreamy influences of the spot. He had remained perhaps half an hour in the place thus chosen, too deeply occupied in his own retrospects and anticipations of the future to take much heed either of the rapidly increasing darkness, or of any sounds which came casually on the quiet atmosphere around him. He had just begun, however, to become sensible of the fact that the sky was clouding over more rapidly than the hour could well account for, and starting to his feet, looked round for some guide as to his nearest path to the borders of the heath, where he might get shelter from the impending storm.</p>
               <p>Just as Gerard was stooping to pick up the sword-stick which he always carried with him, and which had been a present from Mr. Seaforth on leaving Athy, he was startled by the whizzing of a bullet over his head, and the next moment the stifled cries of some person for "help," were distinctly heard in the distance. He grasped his stick firmly, and rushed off in the direction from whence the cries appeared to come, guided by the gradually increasing noise of groans and muttered imprecations, as if some desperate struggle were being carried on.</p>
               <p>With frantic anxiety lest he should be too late, Gerard hurried on, and his old country habits stood him in good stead, as he leaped over the impediments in his way, and cleared one or two ditches which were in the direct road to the spot whence the sounds came. Another moment, and he seemed within bow-shot of the combatants, to judge from the distinctness with which he could perceive the struggle for life and death, which was too surely hastening to a crisis. But a high paling fronted him as he reached the confines of the heath, and before he could gather breath to clear it, a deep groan, and then a fall, bespoke the termination of the strife.</p>
               <p>Gerard leaped over the paling, and barely escaped falling on the prostrate form of a man, who had been just thrown into the narrow ditch which skirted the hedge, and at whose head knelt a man, endeavoring to grasp his throat, in spite of the almost exhausted struggles of the sufferer to defend his life.</p>
               <p>A moment more, and Gerard's sword was buried in the neck of the villain, who fell stunned and bleeding beside his victim, while a second man, who appeared rather guarding the position from the approach of any casual pedestrian, than actually engaged in the fray, took to flight without attempting to succor his wounded comrade.</p>
               <p>Gerard's first impulse was to follow the scoundrel who was thus easily cheating justice of its prey, but the deep groans of the wounded victim of the ruffianly attack arrested his purpose, and he at once turned his attention to his assistance, lest his interference in his favor might, after all, prove useless for the preservation of his life.</p>
               <p>To his great joy, Gerard could perceive, by the low moans and labored breathing of the unfortunate sufferer, that some spark of vitality still remained. He cautiously and tenderly drew the body from the shallow ditch into which it had fallen, and placed it in a half-reclining position against the dry bank at the side of a gate in the hedge, only a few yards from the spot. But on raising the head to ascertain the extent of the injuries inflicted, what was his astonishment and consternation at beholding, in the imperfect light which still remained, the bloodstained, but still distinguishable features of his patron, Lord Hargrave.</p>
               <p>For a moment Gerard stood paralysed at the discovery. The pale, rigid features, the closed eyes, the gradually fainter respiration, the cold, clammy perspiration on the face, all looked like death; and the young man's strong, unaccountable interest in the sufferer gave additional horror to the fear that the murderers had done their work but too well, and that he had only come in time to receive the noble-hearted victim's last sigh. But the stupor quickly passed, and Gerard hastened to atone for his momentary weakness by prompt and efficient measures for his patient's relief. He loosened the cravat from his throat, bound up the wound in the temple with his handkerchief, and then hastened off to a pond at a little distance, from which he brought a hat full of water, which he sprinkled over the face and hands of the sufferer.</p>
               <p>Lord Hargrave now faintly opened his eyes, and whispered—"Where am I?—what was it?—how came I here?" evidently too much bewildered by the late scene to remember its circumstances, or recognise his preserver.</p>
               <p>"You are safe, my dear lord," replied Gerard. "Be composed. All is well now, and I will soon get more help for you, if you do not mind being left for a moment. The villains are gone, and dare not return."</p>
               <p>"That voice!" again murmured the peer, relapsing into the faint half-consciousness from which he had been roused for a moment, "Good heavens! can it be? Who are you?"</p>
               <p>"Gerard Carlton, my lord—your obliged and grateful servant," was the reply. "But you must not speak. Keep perfectly still, while I fetch help. I think I hear steps in the distance."</p>
               <p>He placed the fainting peer in as comfortable a position as possible against the bank, and hastened away towards the sound of footsteps and voices which he discerned more clearly as he rapidly advanced. His loud calls for help brought the persons in question to a stand, and in a few moments he, to his inexpressible relief, joined a little party of three young men who were returning to London after a day's excursion in the neighborhood.</p>
               <p>Gerard explained what had taken place, and went back with them to the spot where the sufferer lay, now once more completely insensible from loss of blood and exhaustion.</p>
               <p>"By Jove!" exclaimed one of the young men, "it's lucky I've got my pocket-pistol with me."</p>
               <p>Taking out a flask of brandy, he poured some down Lord Hargrave's throat, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing the effect of his favorite remedy, in the returning color and opened eyes of his patient.</p>
               <p>Lord Hargrave's first words were a murmured entreaty to be taken home, and as Gerard suddenly remembered that the peer had a villa in the neighborhood, where he had probably been staying, it was determined on consultation with the kind-hearted new comers that a litter should be obtained, and the patient carefully removed to that residence.</p>
               <p>One of the young men, more accustomed to the place than his companions, volunteered to go to a public house near for the purpose, and started off full speed on his errand, while the owner of the brandy flask renewed his attempts to administer to the sufferer a larger dose of his favorite panacea for life's evils. Gerard, relieved from his immediate alarm for his patron, now went in search of the body of the scoundrel whom he had, as he supposed, put out of all chance of any further crimes on the community at large; but, to his great disappointment, he found the body gone from the place where he left it, and it remained doubtful whether he had only stunned the fellow by his blow, and that when the first shock had gone off, he had managed to drag himself from the spot, or whether he had been removed by his companion during the time Gerard's attention had been engrossed by their victim. This escape was the more annoying to Gerard, since, by means of this man, whether alive or dead, he had fully hoped to obtain some clue to the persons concerned in the attack, and also to ascertain whether anything but mere desire of booty had impelled them to the deed.</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6520-00000070"/>
               <p>Dark and strange suspicions, which he scarcely dared confess to himself, had rushed into Gerard's mind as he tended the wounded peer, and these fancies still influenced him so strongly as to impel him to take a torch from one of the men accompanying the litter, which speedily arrived, and to search the spot where the affray had taken place, while the others were carefully placing the wounded man on the cushions prepared for him. He flashed the uncertain light in every direction over the dark spot for some moments without success, and was just about to turn away in despair, when the glitter of some bright object caught his eye. He stooped to pick it up, and found that it was the brilliant clasp of a velvet purse, lying half concealed in a wild shrub under the hedge; and thinking it belonged to Lord Hargrave, he hastily placed it in his pocket, and was again turning to follow the litter, when his foot trod on a hard, small substance, which he discovered was a gold locket attached to a fragment of chain, firmly bedded in the mud of the ditch. Having picked it up, he hastened after the litter.</p>
               <p>"Luckily, the villa was not far distant, and by the time they reached it the news had spread so rapidly that already messengers had been dispatched for a surgeon, and for the assistance of constables, who, together with some of the inhabitants who had volunteered their services, were soon on the spot.</p>
               <p>By the surgeon's directions, Lord Hargrave was placed in bed, and on examination it was found, to the great relief of the anxious household, that a contusion on the back of the head and a wound on the temple were the only injuries, which were more distressing than dangerous, and that a few days' repose and treatment would be sufficient to remedy.</p>
               <p>Carlton insisted on remaining at the bedside of the sufferer during the night, and was thankful to see that he at last sank into a quiet and refreshing sleep. At times indeed, he would start, and evidently fancy that the ruffians were again attempting his life; but Gerard managed to calm the feverish agitation, and again the patient would relapse into the lethargy which was his best restorative.</p>
               <p>Towards morning the surgeon returned, and pronounced the sufferer decidedly better, and kindly ordered Gerard to go to bed and obtain rest, of which he stood almost as much in need as the patient he had been watching.</p>
               <p>Gerard obeyed from actual feeling of exhaustion, rather than any willingness to give his charge to another. He had always felt a strange fascination to the patron whose life he had just saved, and now the bond of service rendered drew him so strongly towards him that it was with extreme reluctance that he left him to the charge of his own servant.</p>
               <p>As Gerard prepared for retiring to the bed which had been prepared for him, the purse and locket, which had almost escaped his memory, fell on the floor. He picked them up, and examined them with eager curiosity. The purse, as he brought it to the light, made his breath come fast and thick, and his eyes flash with indignant contempt. That thick, dark-blue velvet, the curiously-cut brilliant, that clasp, were all <choice>
                     <sic>familar</sic>
                     <corr>familiar</corr>
                  </choice> to him. Many a time had he seen it in the hands of one whose companion he had been, close and intimate as casual acquaintances seldom are; it had been admired by him as a singularly elegant foreign trifle, and he had joked its owner on its donor; and now he had discovered the curious bauble in the spot where a murderous attack had been made on the life of that owner's nearest relative, for the purse belonged to Frederick Grenville, and actually bore his initials stamped on the clasp. Could it be he who had been engaged in the deadly contest? or had the villains been employed by him, and received the purse and its contents as their guerdon? or, as one loophole of escape from these unnatural suspicions, could it be that they had robbed Grenville of that purse, in the exercise of their lawless calling, and then lost it accidentally in the struggle with a yet more important victim?</p>
               <p>Gerard welcomed the last suggestion with a sigh of relief, though his previous observation and knowledge of Grenville's character and habits made it a very transient, if welcome explanation of the mystery, and he gladly turned from the purse to the trinket, which he had discovered so near to it. It was a massive and evidently valuable locket, with double gold facings, and a ring of such weight and size, that it was not difficult to imagine that it would resist the attempts of the robbers to tear it from the chain which held it. He touched the little knob at the top of the trinket; it flew open, and displayed to his interested gaze a tress of fair hair, with the initials "E. G." in small gold letters, and on the reverse the miniature of a lovely female face.</p>
               <p>The young man gazed at the miniature in entranced admiration. The small, childlike, innocent features, the beautiful blue eyes, with the fringe of thick, light-brown lashes, the white, yet life-like skin, the rosy, laughing lips, were a picture of loveliness and innocence that no one could look on without admiration. But there was a yet deeper feeling than mere admiration of its beauty in Gerard's mind; it conjured up visions and speculations as to the fair original, and her relationship to Lord Hargrave. He had never heard that he had a wife, or early love; indeed, Grenville had repeatedly jested on his uncle's insensibility, and almost dislike to the female sex, and spoken in more serious moments of the early years he had spent in India as having blunted and hardened ed his affections and feelings for the remainder of his life.</p>
               <p>Gerard indeed remembered one little incident which had well-nigh passed from his mind. He had on one occasion, early in their acquaintanceship, expressed his surprise that a man in Lord Hargrave's position should have remained single, and laughingly declared that there must have been some Begum beauty in India, who would suddenly appear to claim her rights some day, and Grenville had actually turned livid with rage, as he replied sternly, "Some jests amount to insults, Mr. Carlton, and the family affairs of men of birth and position should be respected when speaking to their near relatives."</p>
               <p>This unwonted touchiness on Grenville's part now recurred to Gerard's mind, as forgotten trifles will often return when some sudden event or word gives, as it were, the touch to the whole train of memory. He could not doubt that the locket had been carefully preserved, and secretly worn by Lord Hargrave. Men did not often thus cherish the portraits of even a fondly loved sister; and the presumption undoubtedly was, that the lovely face on which Gerard gazed was that of a betrothed, or an early-lost wife, over whose fate some mystery hung, on which neither the peer nor his relatives liked to dwell.</p>
               <p>There was sufficiently exciting food for Gerard's thoughts that night, and in spite of his exhaustion and loss of sleep, his brain was far too busy with the events and discoveries of the day for him to lose the consciousness of past and present perplexities and speculations till the morning had far advanced.</p>
               <p>When Gerard awoke from the heavy slumber in which he had at last sunk, the shades of evening were again rapidly closing in, and for several minutes he could not collect his ideas to comprehend what had happened since the previous night at that same hour, nor why he was in that strange room; still less, why he should be in bed at that hour. But by degrees all the events of the previous day rushed on his mind, and hastily ringing the bell, he asked the servant who answered it, how Lord Hargrave was going on.</p>
               <p>"Extremely well, sir, the doctor says," was the reply; "my lord was quite sensible when he woke this morning, and he has asked about you several times, and is very anxious to see you as soon as you can go to him."</p>
               <p>"But does the doctor think it would be safe for him to see me?" asked Gerard.</p>
               <p>"He thought it less dangerous than the excitement of being denied what my lord is so anxious about," replied the man. "But I expect him every moment, sir, and then he will tell you himself."</p>
               <p>Gerard hastily began his toilette, though his progress was, perhaps, somewhat retarded by the sight of the purse and locket which lay on the table before him. He could not resist the desire to look again at that lovely face, which was even more sweet and winning on a repeated acquaintance with its beautiful features. There was, of course, no doubt as to the restoration of the locket to its rightful owner, but there was a far greater perplexity in Gerard's mind as to the purse, to which such wretched suspicions were attached. It was a dilemma which would have perplexed a far less interested and more experienced casuist than the young preserver of Lord Hargrave's life. Should he risk the consequences of an unjust crimination of the nephew and heir of the man whose life he had saved, on what would appear a <choice>
                     <sic>trival</sic>
                     <corr>trivial</corr>
                  </choice> and accidental circumstance to those who had not watched as he had his former conduct and career; or, on the other hand, would it be right to leave Lord Hargrave in an unsuspicious ignorance, which might expose him to future and more fatal attempts?</p>
               <p>The deliberations on these knotty points so decidedly impeded Gerard's toilette, that, when the servant came to announce the arrival of Dr. Spenser, and also the late dinner which had been prepared for both gentlemen, he was fain to thrust the pretty but perplexing baubles in his pocket, and to forget the troubled arguments which the sight of them had occasioned.</p>
               <p>Dr. Spenser was a cheery, genial man, about five and forty years of age, whose aspect was a charm against gloom and cynicism, and Gerard's impressionable temperament rose considerably under the sunny atmosphere which the good physician threw around him.</p>
               <p>"Say as little as possible of the attack, and of the rascals themselves," was the doctor's direction, when, after the dinner had been hastily discussed, Gerard prepared to visit his host. "When the head is at all affected, the nerves are apt to dwell on the circumstances of such a disagreeable affair to a degree that considerably impedes recovery. Follow his lead, but don't advance on it, nor dwell on the subject more than you can help."</p>
               <p>This advice luckily decided Gerard's course of action, for the present, and with a sense of relief, he dismissed the matter for the chapter of future accidents to decide.</p>
               <p>Lord Hargrave welcomed Gerard with a bright smile and outstretched hand, as he approached his bedside. His face was pale, and the bandage on his temple gave an air of suffering greater in appearance, perhaps, than it was in reality; but his eyes were bright, and his voice was firm and distinct, as he replied to Carlton's inquiries as to his state.</p>
               <p>"Wonderfully well," said he, "thanks to you and my good doctor. But, Carlton, how can I thank you for the inestimable service you have rendered me? Words can never express my lasting gratitude, my—"</p>
               <p>"My dear lord," said Gerard, "I entreat<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6520-00000071"/> you not to distress me by such uncalled-for expressions. Remember my deep obligations to you; if I had the slightest merit, in any case, for doing so simple a duty, it could but be a very common return for your goodness to me."</p>
               <p>"Not so, Carlton, that is a mere trifle," said the peer. "I only did for you what, in some sense, I was bound to do; but you have saved me from a violent and cruel death, and you shall find I am not unmindful of your brave conduct. Now sit down, and tell me how you are getting on. I was told by my nephew that you were in some scrape at the Custom House, and that the superiors had complained of repeated irregularities on your part. Is it so? I am certain you will be candid with me."</p>
               <p>Gerard was astonished at the remark, which he was almost inclined to attribute to some wandering of mind on the patient's part.</p>
               <p>"My dear lord," said he, "it is a pity to trouble you with my insignificant affairs while you are ill. But I imagine you cannot have received a letter I addressed to you some little time ago, which explained everything."</p>
               <p>"I received no letter," replied the peer, raising himself on his pillow; "but I have been living here for some weeks past. Perhaps it may have got lost; and yet they have strict orders to forward every letter to me. But what was it that you have to explain?"</p>
               <p>"Another time, my lord; not yet," Gerard began.</p>
               <p>"Nonsense!" said the earl. "I am as well as ever, except this bandage, which makes me feel like a Turk in a turban, and a little dizziness in the head. There, sit down quietly, and tell your story—some young man's escapade, I suppose. Fred ought to have taken better care of you, as you were so totally inexperienced."</p>
               <p>Thus urged, Gerard told his tale as briefly as possible, carefully avoiding any mention of Grenville or of Adeline Rivers in the matter, and confining himself to a general statement of the debts he had incurred by an imprudent mingling in expensive and dangerous society, and the desperate measures to which he had had recourse to escape from his difficulties.</p>
               <p>"It's a bad business," said Lord Hargrave, who had listened with grave and quiet attention, "but it is by no means as disgraceful as I feared, from what I had heard. You were a young idiot not to come straight to me, and tell me the whole story, instead of choosing Mr. Milner for a confidant and assistant."</p>
               <p>"You forget, my lord," said Gerard, flushing, "that such a proceeding on my part would have been something like begging, and you had already done more than I could have expected from one on whom my mother more than once assured me I had no claim, save your kindness."</p>
               <p>"She was wrong," said Lord Hargrave; "you had no legal or positive claim, I grant; but there are ties and obligations which are binding on men of any right feeling and honor, and your mother's sorrows constituted such a claim. However, the thing is done, and all that remains is to see what is to be your next step in life. It would hardly be pleasant for you to go back to the Custom House, and I doubt whether I could accomplish it. In any case, some one must be sacrificed to official sense of justice; but still, there are other careers open. What say you to the army?"</p>
               <p>Gerard crimsoned with grateful pleasure, and replied quickly, "The very profession I should choose, my lord, were it in my power. It is one where a name can be made, even if I have no right to the one I now bear, as I more than suspect is the case.</p>
               <p>"Forget it, my young friend," said Lord Hargrave, laying his hand kindly on the young man's arm. "Remember the saying of the old philosopher. What is not your sin, should not be turned into your punishment. I understand from your mother that you are ignorant of her story; but you need not blush for her, and still less for a stigma which does not belong to you. Well, then, if I can get you a commission, you won't refuse it?"</p>
               <p>"My lord, I am overwhelmed with your goodness," stammered Gerard; I have no words to thank you."</p>
               <p>"You owe me none for a simple repayment of my debt," said Lord Hargrave, kindly. "But if you fancy you are under the slightest obligation to me, repay it by carefully abstaining from debt, and all that leads to it, in any shape, and do your utmost to make me proud of my <choice>
                     <sic>protègè</sic>
                     <corr>protégé</corr>
                  </choice> in your new career."</p>
               <p>Gerard's reply may be imagined. The entrance of the physician, with peremptory orders for quiet and silence, now put an end to the conversation.</p>
               <p>On the following morning Gerard was again summoned to Lord Hargrave's apartment, and found him stronger and more composed than on the previous evening.</p>
               <p>"Now, Carlton," he began, "let me hear all the particulars of the rescue you so gallantly effected the other evening. Did you get a good view of either of the ruffians?"</p>
               <p>"I did not, my lord, for you were in such imminent danger that I had no time to consider the personal appearance of your assailant, and the other fellow was off like a shot, before I had even settled his comrade. And then I fully believed I had secured the villain who was struggling with you, so that there would be an opportunity to look into the matter when you were safe. However, his head must have been a hard one, for he recovered and got away before I had procured any help. Has your lordship lost any property?"</p>
               <p>"Not of the kind that would have tempted the scoundrels," he replied. "My watch, purse, and pocket-book are safe, but what I valued far more is gone."</p>
               <p>An involuntary sigh interrupted his sentence; but he went on.</p>
               <p>"I was just strolling on the heath, in the quiet twilight, when two fellows suddenly appeared and fell on me, before I was aware of their intention. I had a small pocket-pistol with me, which I managed to fire, but it missed aim in the struggle, and the bullet went over their heads."</p>
               <p>"And nearly hit mine," said Carlton, laughing; "in which case, I fear neither your lordship nor my worthless self would have been in the enjoyment of any great degree of comfort just now, even if we had escaped with life. But it would seem that it was not robbery but murder that was the object of the attack."</p>
               <p>"It does, indeed, seem so," said the peer, thoughtfully; "and yet who can desire my life? There is but one who will benefit by my death, and he—no, it is impossible that he would wish to hasten it. I have ever been kind and liberal to him, and he could well wait for time to bring its inevitable results. And an enemy I do not know that I have in the world."</p>
               <p>There was a pause. Lord Hargrave's face was clouded by the transient idea which had crossed his mind, however quickly dismissed, and Gerard had not the heart to increase that gloom by detailing his own discovery, and the proof which he knew that it afforded of the truth of the unnatural suspicion which had for a moment crossed the uncle's mind. He hastened to turn the invalid's attention to other and equally engrossing subjects.</p>
               <p>"Did I not understand you to say, my lord, that you had lost something more precious to you than all the valuable property which these scoundrels have spared?"</p>
               <p>"Too true," said the peer, sadly; "they have taken from me what cannot be restored and which I valued more than all that I possess on earth. But it is not for long, not for long; I trust I shall once more possess in another world what I have so long mourned in this."</p>
               <p>"My dear lord, I trust that you will long be spared to bless others, and that your own happiness may be secured by the benefits you are so ready to dispense," said Gerard. "But I hope I have had the good fortune to rescue from the destruction which threatened it, that which is so precious to you. Is this locket the property you have thus mourned?"</p>
               <p>He took from his pocket the beautiful trinket, and gave it to the invalid, who seized it with the eagerness of an impatient lover, rather than the calmer satisfaction of a mature man.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, it is! Heaven bless you, Carlton! you seem born to be my good genius. That locket was to me a priceless treasure, the sole relic of happy and by-gone days. I would have given thousands as its ransom."</p>
               <p>He pressed the trinket to his lips, and then hastily concealed it in his bosom; and Gerard's hope that he might open the spring, and give some clue to the lovely miniature it contained, proved fruitless.</p>
               <p>Lord Hargrave remained silent for a few moments; then he asked suddenly, "Your mother—how is she, Carlton?"</p>
               <p>The question was so abrupt and foreign to the late subject of their conversation, that Gerard could have fancied it was rather to turn his attention from the agitation he had just witnessed, than from a natural and spontaneous interest in the inquiry.</p>
               <p>"I thank you, my lord: she was still extremely delicate when I heard from her a short time since, and she gave some hints of disappointment in the search she had gone down to Taunton to make, which had evidently depressed her. I think of going down for a few days to see her, before starting on any fresh career."</p>
               <p>"Then she does not know of your late trouble?" said Lord Hargrave.</p>
               <p>"No," replied Gerard; "I could not add to her sorrows till it was absolutely necessary."</p>
               <p>"Better send for her here, my boy," said Lord Hargrave, after a short pause. "There are certain reasons why it is better you should not go down to that neighborhood just now, and yet Mrs. Carlton will naturally wish to see you before joining a regiment which may be ordered on foreign service at any moment. Write to her at once; invite her to my house, and add, from me, that the service you have rendered me, secures from this moment my lasting interest in your welfare, and that your advancement will be henceforth my care."</p>
               <p>Gerard gratefully thanked the noble-hearted man who had thus generously assumed an obligation, which the young man could only consider to be the payment of his own debt, and then took his leave.</p>
               <p>"With your permission, my lord," said Gerard, "I shall return to-morrow and learn the progress you have made towards recovery."</p>
               <p>Lord Hargrave smiled assent, and Gerard left the room, and an hour after was at the humble apartments which he had occupied since his dismissal from the Custom House. His landlady opened the door with an exclamation of wonder and importance.</p>
               <p>"La! sir," she cried, "why I thought something had happened; only, to be sure, young men are so random, and get in such scrapes, and never think about any one waiting and wondering about them. And there's a letter for you marked 'Immediate,' which came late last night, and I think it's really something pressing, though I've known silly girls put that just to a love letter, and this is in a lady's hand sure enough."</p>

               <p>Gerard went direct to his own room, without waiting to hear more of the voluble landlady's speculations, and seized the mysterious missive which had called forth her curiosity. It was dated from his mother's residence at Taunton, but not in her handwriting, and his heart beat fast as he looked at the signature, for at the foot of the few lines it contained was the name dearest to him on earth, though how or why it was attached to a letter addressed to him, and from his mother's house, was a mystery. The note was brief and agitating enough to excuse the emotion:—</p>

               <p>Gerard sat stunned and bewildered at the sudden blow; the crushing nature of which, none but one who has lost an only parent, an only friend, could realise. His first impulse was of course to obey the hurried summons, and ringing the bell with a violence that electrified the landlady's nerves, he ordered a postchaise to be sent for at once, while he got together a few necessaries for the journey.</p>
               <p>"Poor young gentleman! he does look all of a shake and tremble," said the good woman to her factotum of all work; "quite flabergasted and aguish like. I shouldn't wonder if he'll go without so much as a nightshirt, unless I see to him a bit."</p>
               <p>Her friendly offices were however declined by the agitated young man, and she was obliged to content herself with preparing for him a mutton cutlet and a glass of ale, which Gerard tasted out of pure gratitude for her attention, but which was in truth nearly untouched when the postchaise drove up to the door, and he was driven off with all possible speed.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLII.</head>
               <p>IN the simply furnished but clean and tasteful chamber in "The Nest," where we first introduced Agatha Stephenson, lay the dying form of that same lovely and suffering woman. But it would have been difficult to recognise in the worn, pale features of the invalid, Mrs. Carlton; the beautiful young creature who had, twenty-two years before, become a mother in the very apartment where she was now patiently waiting for the merciful dismissal, which death alone could bring. Beside her sat a young and lovely girl, whose eyes were bent on the sufferer with tender anxiety, and who from time to time bathed her wan face with a restoring essence, and moistened the lips with a cordial, which the physician had left as the palliative of sufferings he could not relieve or cure.</p>
               <p>"Gerard," murmured the sufferer; "my son, where is he? why will he not come to receive my blessing, worthless though it be?"</p>
               <p>"Dear Mrs. Carlton, something has detained him; he has not received my letter; be assured nothing would keep him from you at such a moment," said the girl, soothingly. "He will arrive soon."</p>
               <p>"It will be too late, too late," faintly gasped the sufferer. "My minutes are numbered. Mabel, listen to me. Promise me you will console him, advise, help, love him as long as you both live. As you would find mercy and sympathy in your own time of need, or pardon for the errors to which we are all liable, promise me this."</p>
               <p>The dying woman spoke with an energy of which Mabel had hardly thought her strength capable, and took her hand with a startling and vice-like grasp.</p>
               <p>Mabel hesitated, and the warm blood rushed to her checks, and her heart beat with a painful strength and rapidity.</p>
               <p>"I will do all in my power," she began; "but—"</p>
               <p>"No, no, no; not that, not that; promise what I said," cried the sufferer, starting up from her pillow.</p>
               <p>Before Mabel could reply, a chaise was heard driving at a rapid pace to the door of the cottage, and the bell rang furiously; a quick, hurried step bounded up the stairs to the dying chamber, and Gerard Carlton, haggard and breathless, threw himself by the bedside of his dying parent, and pressed his lips on her wan hand.</p>
               <p>A smile illumined the dim features of the sufferer, while Mabel half concealed herself in the curtains of the bed, lest her irrepressible emotion should betray her true feelings to him from whom she had so striven to hide them.</p>
               <p>"Heavenly Father, I thank thee," said the dying woman. "Gerard, pardon and bless your erring mother, as she implores the richest blessings of Heaven on your head. Mabel, give me your hand; may, hesitate not, for he to whom I would give it with my dying prayer for you both, is—your brother."</p>
               <p>Mabel gave one long, low gasp of agony and surprise, and sank powerless and faint on the couch near which she leaned. Gerard sprang to his feet like one struck by a gunshot.</p>
               <p>"Mother, mother, in mercy, speak! Say it is not true—that you were dreaming, say anything but those horrid words!"</p>
               <p>Speech and strength were rapidly deserting the dying woman, though she still tenaciously held Mabel's hands in hers, and restlessly stretched out the other to grasp Gerard's shrinking arm.</p>
               <p>"Mother, one word!" he groaned—"is it true?—can it be that Mabel's father is—"</p>
               <p>He stopped, for the pale lips of his mother er were working convulsively to form the words which the fast-failing power of utterance made slow and difficult to her parched tongue.</p>
               <p>The young man bent his head low, lower still, till his ears almost touched the lips of the sufferer, and then he suddenly started up. Clear and distinct those two words were to his sharpened sense, albeit the whisper in which they were spoken was the feeble, last, gasping utterance of the departing spirit—"Your father!"</p>
               <milestone n="* * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>"Gerard, dear Gerard," said Mabel, "for my sake be calm and patient. Wait till you have seen Lord Hargrave, till you have read the narrative which your mother has left for you. It is too fearful to be true. Your mother was wandering—her senses were confused. She mistook my father for the real author of her sorrows. Believe me, it is impossible; everything proves it. At the very date of your birth he was just married to my own dear mother; and not one whisper of any previous attachment on his part was ever breathed by my aunt, who was yet no partial friend. No, no, we are torturing ourselves needlessly. It is a delusion—a mist."</p>
               <p>Yet while Mabel spoke, and strove to smile at the fruitless misery they were giving themselves, her whole frame trembled with suppressed terror of the wretched truth.</p>
               <p>"Mabel, my loved, my precious one," said Gerard, fondly drawing her towards him, "Heaven has cleared away the cloud of mist and suspicion that divided us by a terrible and unexpected shock; but, whatever betide whatever may be my sorrow, I am thankful that our hearts are at least open to each other; that distrust, and the bitter anguish of believing ourselves deceived, betrayed, is over for ever. I will obey you, dear one, and leave no means untried to test the truth of this fearful disclosure of my poor mother; and then you will still be to me the most beloved being on earth. I will either prove worthy of your love, and place the hope of winning you as the one bright beacon of my course, or you shall not blush when you hear of the deeds in life and in death of your brother."</p>
               <p>"Death!" she murmured, with a shudder. "Oh, Gerard! what mean you?"</p>
               <p>"I only mean what this will explain, dear girl," he replied, placing in her hand a packet, which, so soon as her trembling hands and scattered senses would permit her to open and examine, she found to be the announcement both from Lord Hargrave and the War Office, that Gerard was gazetted to an ensigncy in the Fusiliers.</p>
               <p>"His regiment," said Mabel, looking fearfully in Gerard's face. "Oh Gerard, for my sake be careful and patient."</p>
               <p>"Trust me, dearest; I will do all that an honorable, if base-born, man can do," replied Gerard. "And now, this is but prolonged torture, and danger too, for you to remain; your father may return at any hour and discover your absence. You shall hear from me when I know the worst. Nay, love, for my sake be strong, or you will quite unman me."</p>
               <p>Mabel buried her face in the cushions of the sofa where she was sitting, and Gerard could distinguish the half-choked sighs that she strove bravely to check. And then she raised her calm face, and without another word, rose from her seat and held out her hand.</p>
               <p>"Farewell, Gerard," she said; "Heaven bless, prosper and support you in your duty. In any case, we have a claim on the love and assistance of each other, which can never fail. But remember that you are not alone now, and that my happiness depends on yours."</p>
               <p>Before Gerard could reply Mabel darted from the room, and in a few minutes he heard her step on the gravel, and then the little pony carriage which was waiting for her drove rapidly away, and he was alone,—alone with the dead; alone with the far more appalling sense of the utter desolation, the shame, the life long misery which had been bequeathed to him by the unhappy mother who at last slept calmly after the "fitful fever," "the cankering, aching wound," which made her existence one long suffering.</p>
               <p>At length all was over; the last rites were performed to the dead—the comforting, hopeful words of Scripture spoken over the grave—and the sole mourner of the once lovely and courted Agatha turned away from the solemn scene with feelings of envy rather than regret. "Weep not for the dead, but for him that goeth away," sounded in his ears like a ringing prophecy; and Gerard at the very threshold of life, envied her for whom its joys and sorrows and strife were past, as the traveller on his weary pilgrimage envies those whom he sees quietly resting in their peaceful homes. But yet the completion of these last offices to the dead roused him to a more active and eager desire to know the reality of the dream-like words which his mother had spoken; and within a few hours of the funeral Gerard left "The Nest" to the care of his mother's faithful servants, and started for the metropolis, which he had quitted a few short days before with such different, though equally troubled, feelings. He was calmer, softer in his grief, since he had learnt Mabel's real truth and constancy to him. Whatever the result, he could still think of her as loving and bright and good as he had formerly believed her; and the rankling, festering thorn of distrust and jealousy had now been drawn from his deep wounds.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLIII.</head>
               <p>IT was noon on the following day when Gerard presented himself at Lord Hargrave's house in Grosvenor Square, where the peer's letter had informed him he was now residing. Gerard was at once admitted to his presence. His lordship was pale, and the scar on his temple still plainly visible, but no other trace of his late injuries appeared to remain, and he welcomed his young <foreign xml:lang="FRA">protégé</foreign> with kindly and cheering words of condolence.</p>
               <p>"You can scarcely regret your mother's removal from a world which had been a troubled scene for her, my young friend," he said; "and I would rather congratulate than condole with you on the happiness of one whom you are too unselfish to mourn."</p>
               <p>"You are right, my lord," said Gerard; "I feel rather selfishly disposed to envy her, if indeed my worst fears are realised. Lord Hargrave," he added, suddenly, "you are too kind and honorable not to relieve my suspense at once, if it is in your power. Who is my father, and what is the mystery of my birth?"</p>
               <p>The peer did not at once reply, but gazed on the young man with a dreamlike, abstracted gaze, and murmured, rather to himself than to his companion, "Life's trials—life's trials!—a bereaved father, a son to whom his father's very name is worse than death."</p>
               <p>"My dear boy," he said, rousing himself from his momentary abstraction, "forgive me if I cannot at once relieve your natural anxiety. But your mother's last entreaty to me on entrusting to me the packet which I have for you, was a request that it should be from her alone that you should learn the story of her wrongs, and your own birth. And remember, when perusing the sad narrative that there is no disgrace but in crime, and that the victim is far less to be pitied than the author of his ruin."</p>
               <p>As the earl spoke he unlocked a cabinet near him, and took from it a packet tied with green silk, which Gerard at once recognised as one he had seen more than once in his mother's hands during his childhood. He took it with the strange thrill of awe which the writing of the departed, and objects immediately associated with them, sends through the frame.</p>
               <p>"I will leave you," said the kindly peer, "to read that long-written narrative undisturbed. No one shall interrupt you, and till you summon me I shall not intrude on your privacy; but do not forget that you have a friend near you to sympathise with, and explain what may still be a mystery to you, when you may feel disposed to send for me."</p>
               <p>Gerard felt the considerate delicacy which thus enabled him to end without delay his torturing suspense, but he was too powerfully moved by the impending crisis of his fate to thank his kind patron save by a look; and then the door closed, and he was alone with the secret of his life.</p>
               <p>For a brief moment of cowardice, pardonable at such a time, Gerard paused, and then, tearing open the seal, he began to read the closely written, beautiful characters which he knew so well.</p>
               <p>"Gerard, my son, my beloved child, sole joy, and yet deep sorrow of my heart, before you begin this narrative let me entreat you to pardon the weakness of a mother, whose life would have been joyfully yielded up to secure your happiness, and yet whose errors have clouded the sunshine and blighted the bloom and fair promise of your noble youth. Often have I marvelled that the son of one so base and treacherous, so cruelly regardless of the misery and shame he inflicted, should display such noble, and generous, and unselfish qualities, as I have watched from childhood to maturity in you, my beloved boy. I have feared for every fresh test of your nature as years went on, and the various changes of time insensibly acted on your impulsive temperament. But not one trace of the blood which flows in your veins, not one taint of the base character of him to whom you owe your birth, have I ever discovered; no, not when the severest trial of all came, and you learned that the misery and the stigma which rested on your mother's name had descended to your innocent self.</p>
               <p>"My son, in all the agony and shame I have suffered, this has been my sole consolation; and may the consciousness that you have thus softened the bitterness of your mother's griefs, and brought on your head her warmest blessings, her most fervent prayers, attend you through life, and enable you to bear patiently and courageously the struggles and the mortifications which her errors have entailed on you. On my knees I beseech Heaven for my child—on my knees I implore your pardon, Gerard, for the injuries I have inflicted on you! And now to the sad story of my weakness and my wrongs:—</p>
               <p>"I am the daughter of General Fleming, an officer of some note in the Indian army. Having early lost my mother in that unhealthy climate, my father sent me, as well as my two brothers, to England, almost immediately after her death. It might be that some of my sorrows and tears are owing to that circumstance, since I never had the benefit of a mother's training, nor knew a father's love, to console my childish griefs, nor win the confidence and affection of my girlish heart.</p>
               <p>"My brothers were sent to school, and I was placed under the care of a distant relative of my father, who contented herself with engaging a governess for me; and being satisfied that my education was attended to, so far as accomplishments and manners were concerned, he left the rest to chance, or my own nature. And thus, when my father returned turned to England, just after my seventeenth birthday, he found me to all appearance admirably trained to take the place intended for me in society. I was attractive enough in outward respects, unhappily for my peace and my self-respect; but I had no firmness of purpose, no fixed sense of right to guide me, and was too impulsive and romantic not to incur every danger that could befall a beautiful and uncontrolled girl, thrown without a careful guardian or judicious guide into the <choice>
                     <sic>votex</sic>
                     <corr>vortex</corr>
                  </choice> of general society.</p>
               <p>"By this time my brothers were settled in life; the eldest, James, having obtained a commission at an early age, and the younger, Edward, having gone out as a cadet in the service of the East India Company. My father had therefore leisure to bestow his attention on my establishment in life; but unfortunately, it never occurred to him that I might have made my own choice of a lover and future husband, before he had announced to me his decision on the same all-important subject.</p>
               <p>"Gerard, you are young and enthusiastic, and will judge me more leniently than an older and more severe critic on female conduct. Long before my father had formed his plans for my future, I had fixed my affection, and exchanged vows of mutual love and fidelity with one who possessed every outward attraction that man could possess. I can scarcely give you any better description of his appearance than to say he was a masculine likeness of Mabel May.</p>
               <p>"I need not enlarge on the attractions of such a countenance, united with fascinating manners, apparent devotion to myself, and a deference to my every wish and caprice. It was scarcely possible that such a lover should plead in vain with a young and ardent girl, and though he urged me to keep my engagement secret from my father for the present, I considered myself solemnly pledged to become his wife, as if already his before the altar.</p>
               <p>"That lover, dear Gerard, was no other than the father of your beloved Mabel, though it was long before I recognized in the beautiful girl bearing that name, the daughter of Lionel Beaumont, the false and perjured lover of my youth, the source of the whole misery of my after years."</p>
               <p>Gerard let fall the manuscript as he came to this dreadful name. Too surely he foreboded what was to follow, and saw the confirmation of his worst fears in this ominous sentence. But the very suspense was more intolerable than the worst agony that could be in store for him; and with a numbed, stony calmness of body and mind, he resumed his perusal of the torturing pages, and continued steadily to the very last line.</p>
               <p>"A few short months of delicious and thoughtless happiness ensued; but it is unnecessary for me to describe to you, my young, enthusiastic boy, the charm which the very romance and concealment of such an engagement possessed. Lionel was as devoted as any lover that the most exacting maiden could desire; my father appeared to disregard, if he did not encourage, our evident enjoyment of each other's society, and I fancied that so soon as my lover had somewhat risen in his profession, he would find no great difficulty in securing his consent.</p>
               <p>"Alas! the illusion was soon dispelled. My father, with a calm sternness of manner which characterised him, and which few, least of all his child, and that child a young and timid girl, could resist, announced to me that he had received proposals for me from a gentleman named Stephenson, a rich merchant and distant relative and possible heir of an Irish landholder. He had considered the matter thoroughly before speaking to me on the subject, had accepted the offer, and I was to prepare for my marriage in six weeks from that time.</p>
               <p>"Gerard, you will say that such a command should have been met with firm but respectful and unconquerable resistance on my part. But I was no match for a man accustomed to command, who was naturally of an iron will, and who had exaggerated notions of the duty of submission on the part of children to their parents. But I might have offered a more stubborn and successful resistance, had Lionel supported me in my first impulse of determined refusal to such an odious sacrifice. On the contrary, he rather counselled me to submission, while yet deploring his own hard fate, and under the veil of unselfish devotion to my interests, he hid his heartless and interested aversion to any sacrifices for my sake. Fool that I was, not to see through the flimsy subterfuge, and discard for ever from my heart the lover who proved so treacherous in my time of need!</p>
               <p>"As you will anticipate, my dear boy, the feeble opposition I ventured to make, gave way before my father's stern commands, and Mr. Stephenson's urgent entreaties. Lionel left the neighborhood where we lived, before my wedding took place, and in less than two months from the time of the first broaching of the subject, I left my father's house as the bride of a man for whom I could never feel the affection of a wife, while taking on me the vows of one. Not that I really disliked my husband. He was kind, affectionate, attentive to my every wish, and I believe in every respect deserving of a far more valuable gift than my poor heart could have been. And I verily believe I should have learned to love him, if not with the ardent, romantic affection I had felt for Lionel, still with a calm and happy regard, had I not continually received letters from my lover, lamenting his hard fate, execrating parental tyranny, and declaring that life had no more charm for him, thus keeping alive my attachment to him, and irritating the wounds which might otherwise have gradually healed.</p>
               <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6520-00000074"/>
               <p>"My father only lived long enough to see the birth of my little girl, for about a month from that time he died suddenly, having thus secured the misery of his only daughter, without any real happiness or profit to himself. His anxiety for my establishment was indeed somewhat explained by the unlooked for state of his affairs. It appeared, on examination, that instead of being the man of property that he was supposed to be, he had only left five thousand pounds, which he bequeathed to my eldest brother, not leaving a sixpence to me, whom he considered to be amply provided for. Nor did he give any thing to my brother Edward, who was then fast rising to fortune in the East.</p>
               <p>"About three months after my father's death, and while I was still delicate from the effects of my confinement, and the various shocks I had sustained, my husband informed me that he was obliged to go to Calcutta, where he had had for some years a large mercantile concern, the affairs of which were much deranged and required his immediate presence. He made every arrangement for my comfort, placed me in a small but beautiful cottage he had purchased near Taunton, in Somersetshire, and settling on me a sufficient, indeed liberal allowance, he left me and one child, with a faithful servant, in that romantic solitude.</p>
               <p>"Lionel Beaumont of course heard of all this from my imprudent self, and when he visited Taunton, which he did twice a year at the assizes, he always came to see me. And though I had sufficient sense of propriety and duty to refuse his visits at any other time, I fancied that it would be straining the point unnecessarily, and in truth confessing my own weakness, to refuse seeing him on those occasions. Would to Heaven he had never come!—never crossed my path more.</p>
               <p>"I had heard once or twice from my husband since he left me, and always in the most affectionate and trusting terms; and on the perusal of his letters my conscience would smite me with an uneasy pang that I could not altogether suppress. Then came a long interval of silence, and I was half surprised, half relieved at the cessation of these unwelcome missives. Then came a small packet from Lionel Beaumont, enclosing a newspaper, which contained a circumstantial account of the wreck of the vessel in which my husband had sailed, and the reported loss of every person on board.</p>
               <p>"Gerard, I must not paint myself worse than I really was. The news gave me a severe shock; and I, perhaps, never loved and valued my husband during life, as I now did on learning the news of his sudden and melancholy death. For many weeks I refused to see Lionel, though he earnestly entreated to be allowed to visit me; and when at last I yielded to his entreaties for an interview, and heard his vows and protestations of unchanging love, I yet firmly resisted any proposal for a speedy union. I felt that it was only proper respect to the memory of my late husband to wait a year before contracting a second marriage, and accordingly the utmost concession Lionel Beaumont could extract from me, was a promise to be his at the end of that time.</p>
               <p>"Months went on, the report of my husband's fate remained uncontradicted and I had not the slightest reason to doubt that I was really a widow. Had I been ten years older I should have wondered at the absence of all intelligence from my husband's firm in Calcutta, and taken means to authenticate the report, ere I ventured on so irrevocable a step. But at nineteen, and still deeply in love, I was led by Lionel in everything, and relied on him for advice and guidance in every step of my life.</p>
               <p>"I was inexpressibly relieved at his proposal that our marriage should be a private one, for many circumstances conspired to make me shrink from any publicity in my second wedding. I imagined then that it was in consideration to my feelings that Lionel proposed this; I little imagined his real reason. However, he arranged all, as he said, in accordance with my wishes. He introduced to me a person whom he represented as a clergyman, who agreed to marry us privately, provided a licence was obtained, which of course was done without any difficulty, and in thirteen months from the news of my husband's death reaching me, I became the wife, as I supposed, of Lionel Beaumont, the ceremony being solemnised privately in my own cottage near Taunton—'The Nest,' as my husband had named it on its purchase. Everything was, however, so conducted as not to occasion the slightest suspicion on my part. A certificate of my marriage, signed by the said clergyman and two of my servants, was given to me, and for a time I felt perfectly secure and happy.</p>
               <p>"But, alas, this state of blissful illusion soon came to an end. Lionel, who had at first been all devotion and gratitude for my compliance with his wishes, became an altered being after the lapse of a few months. He frequently left me, under the plausible pretext of business in London, and would remain away from 'The Nest' for days; and, as time went on, these absences were extended to weeks.</p>
               <p>"The presence of my little girl appeared especially hateful to Lionel; and though at first he only showed this repugnance by impatient harshness to the little creature on the slightest pretext, he at last plainly told me that he could not endure the sight of a child who reminded him constantly that I had belonged to another; and that if I really loved him as I pretended, I should share his feelings and not refuse to place her under other guardianship. I resisted this unnatural proposal for some time; but when he hinted that on my compliance would depend the frequency cy of his visits to 'The Nest,' my weak, loving heart yielded at once, and I consented to place my child under the charge of a young widow lady, in reduced circumstances, whom Lionel introduced to me, and who appeared in every respect fitted for the office. She was sweet and gentle in manner, singularly attractive in appearance; and Lionel assured me that her greatest delight would be in adopting my little daughter as her own, as her chief sorrow in her widowhood was that she was childless. Perhaps I might not have yielded so readily, even under the circumstances but that I was again expecting to be a mother; and pardon me, my son, when I confess that the child of my beloved Lionel was, even in anticipation, far dearer to me than my first husband's could ever have been.</p>
               <p>"Time went on. The hour of your birth was not far distant, and my health and spirits were fast sinking under the continued and unexplained absence of Lionel Beaumont, which had been prolonged far beyond the usual time of his pretended business visits to London. No letter, no tidings of him had reached me for nearly a month, and I was getting fearfully nervous, and apprehensive of I scarcely knew what, when the blow at last came which was not only to realise my worst fears, but to bring with it accumulated and unlooked-for miseries. On the morning of the day when you, my beloved Gerard, first saw the light, a letter was brought to me, which at once and for ever destroyed the last remnant of peace that was left to me. It was—I can scarcely even now write the words without a shudder—from my first, my only lawful husband, announcing his return, and expressing in the most affectionate, ardent terms, his intense longing to behold me once more.</p>
               <p>"Gerard, I cannot describe the terrible, crushing sense of misery and crime which rushed on my bewildered brain as I perused this letter. In one fearful moment the whole folly and wickedness of my past conduct flashed on me, as if illumined by some supernatural light, that revealed me to myself as I really was. Criminal in the worst sense I could not be considered; but that I had been culpably weak in believing so readily the report of Mr. Stephenson's death, and rash in consenting to form so soon a second marriage, ere the full term that gratitude and decorum should have dictated was a charge I could not deny, even to myself. And, in justice to myself I must add, that the disgrace and misery I had caused to the man who had so truly loved me, and the danger which might accrue to him who was still the idol of my heart, was even more terrible to me than my own wretched and degraded position.</p>
               <p>"Fortunately for my feverish senses, bodily illness deadened for the time the agony of my mind. You were born, and thanks to the pitying goodness of my faithful servant and a kindly woman who tended me in my hour of suffering, I contrived that you should be removed at once out of reach of the probable vengeance of my injured husband, and for a short time I even entertained the wild idea that I might shield Lionel from the danger that would probably accrue from his just wrath. Alas, all my despairing efforts to accomplish this last poor atonement for the misery I had caused, proved vain.</p>
               <p>"My husband arrived, full of love and happiness, only to curse the hour when his life was spared, and the unhappy woman who had brought shame and sorrow on his head and that of his innocent child. Gerard, I cannot dwell on this terrible part of my story. Enough that Mr. Stephenson discovered all, and at once left me to the anguish I deserved, and to the vague horrors of the vengeance at which he had darkly hinted.</p>
               <p>"As soon as I could gather strength of mind and body for the effort, I left 'The Nest' for London, taking every precaution to conceal my destination from my justly enraged husband, should he return to demand of me the particulars that I had hitherto resolutely refused to give. My object was of course to find Lionel, and inform him of the terrible position in which we were both placed, trusting that he might in some degree explain his own conduct, and afford me the support and counsel of which I stood so much in need. Imagine my horror, my anguish, on being coolly informed by his servant that his master had gone into Somersetshire, having rented a house there for the sake of his wife, then on the eve of her confinement. For a moment I clung to the hope that there was some mistake; that I was the wife in question, and that Lionel's arrival at 'The Nest' had been prevented by the news of my husband's return, which might have reached him from some other source.</p>
               <p>"'Where?' I asked of the servant.</p>
               <p>"'Near Taunton, I believe, ma'am," was the reply; 'at least, his letters are forwarded there.'</p>
               <p>"My hopes revived. I inquired, "How long has he been gone?"</p>
               <p>"'Nearly a month, ma'am. Lady Mabel has been confined for a fortnight and more, and my master went off before it happened, though I can't say precisely how long ago it was.'</p>
               <p>"'Lady Mabel!' I repeated.</p>
               <p>"'Yes, ma'am, the daughter of the Earl of Hargrave,' said the man, with some loftiness. 'My master was united to her about a twelvemonth since. Did you not read about the wedding, ma'am, in the papers? And now my lady has got a girl, which is a great disappointment, I'm told, for the old earl was bent on having an heir, as Lady Mabel's other sisters have girls only, or none at all, as I've heard.'</p>
               <p>"I listened, with morbid anxiety to know<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6520-00000075"/> the worst, and then I turned away, and reentering the coach, returned to my dreary lodging, where you and my faithful nurse awaited me.</p>
               <p>"A dangerous and tedious attack of fever was the consequence of the shock I had sustained, and it was weeks before I was again able to leave my bed, or prosecute the search which I felt bound to make into Lionel's infamous conduct. When I once more left my room, it was with changed and subdued feelings, which might have been the work of years. All vestige of my wild and engrossing love for Lionel was gone—turned to abhorrence and contempt; and had I been questioned as to the real object of my regret, my affection, my deep repentance, it would have been my injured husband, and not my treacherous lover.</p>
               <p>"Gerard, I ought not, perhaps, to speak thus to you of the author of your being; but I dread lest you may ever be exposed to his evil influence, and I would fain guard you from his vices, even at the cost of your filial respect.</p>
               <p>"To pass as rapidly as possible over this wretched period of my life, I went back to Taunton, though not to 'The Nest,' in order to ascertain the actual position of affairs, and destroy the last lingering doubt of the horrid story I had heard.</p>
               <p>"Alas, everything was confirmed, though much remains to be added to the tale, or rather tragedy, which had been acted. I must not harass you by the details that I gradually learned of all that had happened during the weeks that had elapsed since your birth, but will hasten over the painful facts which must be told.</p>
               <p>"Lady Mabel May, or, as she was too surely proved to be, Lady Mabel Beaumont, had, as I was told, given birth to a daughter, so much to the mortification of the old earl, and the deep vexation of her selfish husband, that they could not conceal their annoyance from the poor invalid, and the consequence was what might naturally have been expected in her delicate state. Fever set in and carried her off, while I was lying prostrate in the metropolis from an almost similar attack. Lionel Beaumont, overwhelmed with rage, disappointment, and possibly terror of my injured husband's vengeance, left this country for America, after placing his infant child under the care of a sister of Lady Mabel's. The old earl refused ever to see his grandchild, or the son-in-law whom he had been so reluctantly forced to receive; and Lionel had, I found, barely enough to take him to the New World and enable him to start on a new career. My husband had, I ascertained, visited 'The Nest' once since my flight, and I also learnt that he had been to the lady who had taken charge of his child. But whether he had taken her to his own protection, or made any other arrangement for the little creature's education, I could not discover; for the child and her guardian had disappeared almost immediately after Mr. Stephenson's visit to them, and left no trace whatever of their whereabout.</p>
               <p>"I thought now that my cup of misery was full, but such was not the case. All lingering hope that Lionel might not have deliberately deceived me, and that he might have been actuated rather by strong temptation and sudden impulse than cool villany, was destroyed.</p>
               <p>"A letter reached me from Lionel, written just before his departure from England, which put the last stroke to the gloomy picture of my fate. He coolly informed me that the ceremony which had united us would not have been a legal one had Mr. Stephenson been really dead. The person who married us was not a clergyman, but a tool of his own, named Neville, and at the very time it took place, preparations were fast making for his marriage with Lady Mabel May. He added, that I could not complain of this, as I had only set him the example by discarding him for a richer suitor; and he advised me, if possible, to get reconciled to the man I had preferred to him, who would put up with the little escapade during his absence.</p>
               <p>"I scarcely knew whether scorn, shame, or hatred were the predominant feelings of my heart on reading this infamous letter. It had at any rate the effect of banishing every shade of tenderness or regret for the past affection I had indulged for one so contemptible in his baseness, and of bracing me, by the very bitterness of its tone, to some more healthful exertion, for the sake of the only being left me to love on earth.</p>
               <p>"After long and anxious deliberation my resolution was taken. I would conceal myself in some obscure spot, where no one would know my story, and devote myself entirely to your education and future welfare, without one selfish aim or thought for my own ease or inclination. It was but a simple duty, but I clung to the idea that it would be some slight atonement for the past, and my repentance might expiate in long years of self-denial and solitude the errors of my youth.</p>
               <p>"My resolution once formed, my next perplexity was how it could best be carried into execution. I was alone, friendless, destitute, without any means of support either for myself or you, and I naturally shrunk from intruding on the notice of former friends or acquaintances, or running the risk of a cold and mortifying rebuff from strangers. In this emergency I wrote to my brother James, who was a widower, living on his half pay, and the interest of his own and his wife's fortunes, in a remote spot near Carlow, in Ireland. I told him my whole story, neither concealing nor palliating the truth, and threw myself on his brotherly pity for an erring but not guilty sister, in her destitute and helpless state. The answer to my letter was long in coming, and the suspense of that weary period was perhaps one of the most sickening of my trials; but it arrived at last, and its kind and gentle tone rewarded me for the pang it had cost me to make the humiliating confession.</p>
               <p>"James invited me to come to live with him, and to bring my helpless infant with me. He said that his health was failing fast, that I was his sole remaining relative in England, and that it would ill become a man on the brink of the grave to show harshness and unfeeling indifference to a suffering and injured sister. He did not justify the thoughtless folly and weakness of my conduct, but neither did he condemn me; and my sick heart clung with eager trust and gratitude to one so kind and yet so faithful in his dealings towards me.</p>
               <p>"I lost no time, my dear boy, in conveying you, my sole remaining treasure, to my brother's house, and there for a few months I had the melancholy consolation of feeling that I was essential to the comfort of one human being besides you, my unconscious infant. James was rapidly sinking in a decline, and I had the satisfaction of smoothing his last days by my constant watching, and by nursing him day and night, until he was taken from us by death. He left me all he had, about five thousand pounds, and I was therefore to a certain extent independent of the world, and free to live where I chose.</p>
               <p>"All places were indifferent to me, so that they afforded me the obscurity I sought, and as I had adopted and continued to use the name of Carlton, which was my mother's maiden name, all trace of my story or extraction was lost in the distant spot I had chosen for my abode. No one could have traced in the broken and melancholy Widow Carlton the brilliant Agatha Fleming, the petted wife of George Stephenson, the idol of the treacherous Lionel Beaumont.</p>
               <p>"An eccentric old friend of my brother to whom he had rendered an essential service, and who had taken a capricious fancy to my melancholy self, had often spoken of Athy, where he had a handsome estate. And though he died very shortly before poor James, and had therefore no especial attraction to the spot on his account, it yet formed a sort of familiar place for me to fix on, more especially as I had more than once accompanied my brother for a short visit to the house of our old friend, and seen there one of the small proprietors of the <choice>
                     <sic>neigborhood</sic>
                     <corr>neighborhood</corr>
                  </choice>, with whose family you became afterwards so unfortunately intimate—I mean Mr. Adams, of Bally Adams. To him I applied on the death of my brother; and finding he had a house to let, suitable to my means and secluded habits, I at once decided on taking it; and from that time till your attainment of your majority I remained there, quiet and unmolested.</p>
               <p>"My brother Edward was now a rich and influential man in India, and I thought it right for your sake, my dearest Gerard, to endeavor to conciliate him. I therefore wrote, relating to him all that I had formerly confessed to my brother James. But he was of a very different temperament. He coldly replied to my letter by expressing a cutting disbelief of every part of my sad story as to my complete innocence of all guilty intentions; but he condescended to add that, if I could procure him the written and well-attested confession of the villain Neville, who had officiated, as a false clergyman, on the occasion of my marriage with Lionel Beaumont, and also the account of Mr. Stephenson's loss in the <hi rend="i"/>Oriana, he might perhaps give it his more serious consideration, and see what credence it deserved; till then, he disavowed all connection with me, and desired me not to attempt any further communication with him, as I had nothing to hope or expect from his assistance.</p>
               <p>"I will not deny that this bitter letter excited angry and resentful feelings in my mind at the time, but better and more humble thoughts succeeded, and I accepted the well-merited chastisement of my past errors, with a sad <choice>
                     <sic>submisson</sic>
                     <corr>submission</corr>
                  </choice> to its justice. But what chance could there ever be that I could ever discover a heartless villain, who had dared to assume the character of a minister of God, and who had probably accompanied his employer to the distant hemisphere where he had escaped from retribution or reproach?</p>
               <p>"The very idea was hopeless, and I abandoned it in quiet and calm despair, determined to employ my time and means rather in training you up for the career I trusted you might occupy, than in a wild and fruitless attempt to satisfy a distrust on my brother's part, which might, after all, give place, on further consideration, to juster thoughts of his only sister.</p>
               <p>"Years passed on without any especial event to vary the monotony of my life, the sole interest of which was the gradual developement of you, my beloved boy, into virtues and talents which realised my utmost expectations. But, about two years ago, this calm was interrupted by a sudden renewal of the long-interrupted intercourse with my brother. Edward wrote to tell me that a friend of his, Sir Henry Purcell, was about to return to England; that he had confided to him my whole story, and that at his, Edward's, request, he had engaged to see me, and do his utmost in assisting me to discover the impostor Neville, if living, and also in finding out the present whereabout of Lionel Beaumont.</p>
               <p>"'It may be,' ran the letter, 'that the villain may yet do you justice—if, indeed, your account of the affair is true. You are now a widow; he is a widower, and the least he can do is to give you a right to his name, and provide for the future career of<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6520-00000076"/> your son. I have also requested Sir Henry to introduce your son to the notice of his friend, Lord Hargrave, whom I knew slightly myself when he was in India, and with whom Sir Henry is intimate. He is a powerful and wealthy peer, and may be of the utmost service to the lad. You will do your best to forward and prove your gratitude for these proffered services of my excellent friend.'</p>
               <p>"This letter revived with fresh vividness the somewhat deadened wounds of my sad heart. There was much to pain and distress me in every line. The bare idea of again meeting, still more of joining my fate with the man who was now the object of my contempt and repugnance, was sufficient to wound me to the very quick, though for your sake, my boy, I almost doubted whether it would not be my duty to refuse to submit to the ordeal, should Lionel be indeed still living, and willing to accede to the demand. Then, too, the very name of Lord Hargrave was sufficient to bring back with added force the most agonising period of my life. Lionel Beaumont's unfortunate wife had been the daughter of the last peer of that name, and though I knew that the title and estates had long since passed from Lady Mabel's family to a distant relative, yet it was a strange and distressing coincidence that the relative of the woman who had been my unconscious rival, should be proposed as the future patron of my son.</p>
               <p>"But I had become too inured to sorrow, and I hope too chastened in my submission to any duties and just penances imposed on me, to shrink from what I could not but confess appeared a kind and promising attempt on Edward's part to assist me; and when Sir Henry arrived, which you will remember was a few weeks before we left Athy, I freely and cheerfully laid before him all the particulars that might guide him in the proposed search, and left it entirely at his discretion to do what he thought right in the matter. The kindhearted baronet could not give me much hope of success in a search for a man so long lost sight of, and whose career had probably been long since cut short by crime, if not by natural causes. However, he promised to do what he could in the affair, and urged me to accept and use without delay the introduction which he proposed to give you to Lord Hargrave.</p>
               <p>"My own better judgment coincided with the baronet's as to the propriety of this step, though I shrank with natural horror from once more encountering the cold world from which I had so long retired, and still more from any intercourse with the relative of Lady Mabel Beaumont. But some strange and mysterious hints which I received as to information which might be obtained from the writer, with regard to the most important events in my early life, and which had been obtained accidentally at the spot where they had occurred, disturbed this selfish apathy on my part. I anxiously waited for a promised interview, or for some more detailed communication from the writer, but none came; and I was fain to believe, either that some evil had befallen the person who sent the note, or that he had changed his purpose of confiding in me what he had to communicate.</p>
               <p>"This circumstance, joined to the unpleasant events at Athy and Bally Adams, induced me to resolve on quitting Ireland without delay, and as Lord Hargrave was in town and I wished to consult my solicitor there, before proceeding to Taunton, the metropolis was of course our first destination.</p>
               <p>This is the real explanation of the circumstances which puzzled you, Gerard just before our leaving Athy, and they will also serve to throw light on my extreme horror and agitation on witnessing the execution at Naas. Gerard, can you not enter into my feelings of agony, and only wonder that I did not sink lifeless on the spot, instead of the temporary unconsciousness which the spectacle produced? The criminal, with whom I in vain strove to obtain one word that might at once vindicate and explain the great error of my life; the infamous tool of a yet more infamous man, whose features recalled to me the happiest and the most fatal hour of my life was launched into eternity before my very eyes, and with him vanished the long cherished hope that my innocence, if not my honor, could be proved beyond doubt. No wonder that reason and consciousness failed before such a spectacle.</p>
               <p>"I need not dwell on the few weeks that have elapsed since then; you know, almost as well as myself, the circumstances of your introduction to your kind patron, Lord Hargrave. I need only say that, in addition to Sir Henry Purcell's friendly intercession, I added a few brief lines, stating that I deeply regretted to inform him that both you and myself had sustained irreparable wrong from a relative of the last Lord Hargrave, and that, although I did not wish to intrude myself on his notice, or bring forward names and events which would bring scandal on his family, I threw myself on his honor and kindness to do what in him lay for your advancement and welfare, in a life blighted at its very commencement by another's crime. I also confided to his care the record of my sad story, as a pledge that I had neither wish nor intention to make public so painful a disclosure, involving names so near to him.</p>
               <p>"I waited, my son, to see your comfortable settlement in an honorable and safe career, and finding that I could gain no information of the person I had hoped to trace from my solicitor, I determined to leave at once for Taunton, with the faint hope of discovering some of the family of the person to whom I had confided your infant self, and from whom I imagined came the mysterious hints I had received before quitting Athy.</p>
               <p>"Heaven only knows whether I shall ever see you more, my darling son, my sole hope and comfort, and tie to life. Often too of late have my thoughts turned with longing tenderness to the poor, deserted little one, who never knew a mother's care—who has doubtless learned to hate a mother's name. Oh, if she is indeed living, how my heart would yearn over her, and implore her pardon for the wrong I had done to her—a pardon for which her outraged father reconveyed to me in his last moments. But that can never, never be in this world, and I can only commit her and you to Him who has been my sole trust and support in life, and hope in death. May He watch over and guide you both through the dark mazes of this troubled world, and save you from the misfortunes and crimes of your unhappy parents!</p>
               <p>"And now, Gerard, my son, in these, my last dying words and prayers, I would lay on you my solemn injunctions never to forget, while pitying your mother's wrongs, that the man who inflicted them is your father. Let not the additional horror and crime arise of a son's unnatural resentment to his parent, rest on my head. I charge you, my son, should you be in any way brought in contact with Lionel Beaumont, under any circumstances whatever of provocation and irritation, that you remember my last prayers and entreaties were, to abstain from the breach of a son's duty, which your mother's story might naturally tempt you to commit.</p>
               <p>"'Vengeance is mine,' saith the Lord; and to Him should we poor, weak mortals humbly confide it. I thank God that I can now say from my heart that I forgive, even as I hope to be forgiven, all who have injured and embittered my life's sad pilgrimage. May Heaven bless you, is the prayer of your loving mother."</p>
               <p>Gerard read eagerly, rapidly, yet with an intensity of attention that took in every word of the closely-written manuscript, and exhausted every drop of misery which could be drawn from its pages.</p>
               <p>After the first terrible shock, which the confirmation of his worst fears had brought to his excited nerves, Gerard gave no outward sign of the agony that every moment sank deeper and deeper, till it seemed to crush and paralyse the springs and sources of feeling. That one revelation that Mabel May was his sister, was sufficient to engross and deaden his powers of suffering from any other cause. It was reserved for calmer moments to reflect on the aggravation, the refinement of torture, which his mother's history and all that it involved, bequeathed to him as a life-long legacy of suffering. The hopeless illegitimacy of his birth, the utter worthlessness of the man he must still call father, the self-indulgent weakness which unconsciously diminished the respect and reverence he would fain have cherished for the memory of his mother, and, to crown all, the idea that Mabel's sole parent was so utterly unworthy of such a child, were a combination of evils that neither courage nor energy, nor even time could ever completely conquer. And yet there was a difference in the young man's reception of this terrible blow to his dearest prospects and hopes from that with which he had before struggled, and from which Adeline Rivers had rescued him.</p>
               <p>There was a calm, hopeless resignation to inevitable suffering, very different from the gloomy despair which had wellnigh plunged him into the dark and gloomy abyss of the deep river. He had not now the horrors of remorse, the consciousness of personal degradation, to add to his sorrows. There is a dignity in unmerited misfortune that saves the sufferer from the contempt of himself or of others, and throws a sort of grandeur over the ruin of happiness. It is then that it is possible "to suffer and be strong," to bend under sorrow, without yielding to it, and retain the dignity of the victor while "bearing the misery of the conquered."</p>
               <p>Gerard's first real consciousness of present things was the pressing question, "Should he confide his mother's narrative to Lord Hargrave?" Even in that moment of bewildering misery he retained sufficient mastery of himself to consider the interests and feelings of those most dear to him, though his own future appeared so utterly hopeless and indifferent to him. His mother had considered it due to Lord Hargrave to conceal from him the full turpitude of his predecessor's son-in-law. Gerard's chief thought was for Mabel. It was her father who had been thus guilty. Her name would be clouded and tarnished by the exposure of his infamy; her innocent head bowed under a parent's shame.</p>
               <p>His mother's solemn entreaties had bound Gerard to forbearance where his father was concerned; and his own better feelings told him that the injunction was in accordance with the laws of God and man. To what avail, then, would it be to punish the innocent—to pain and wound the honor of the noble and the good—while the criminal would suffer little from the exposure of his sin? Gerard's brain rapidly took in, as it were, these considerations; his senses became preternaturally excited and acute, as the reaction from his recent stupor set in, and his resolution was quickly and steadily formed. He would briefly inform his kind patron of the misfortunes that had attended his birth, and its consequent effect on his mother's life, and his own prospects, without mentioning names, or relating the wretched details that had just come to his knowledge. For the present the secret must be buried in his own breast, or only shared with Mabel—partially shared, even with her; for Gerard felt that one of the aggravations of his misery was the<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6520-00000077"/> necessity of keeping from the friends dearest to him the facts that most effectually vindicated his mother's fame, and lessened the disgrace that rested on his own birth.</p>
               <p>It would be cruel to expose the full infamy of a parent to his innocent child, and Gerard determined only to tell Mabel sufficient of the truth to explain his mother's dying words, and the relationship that existed between them. His sister! The word was sweet, yet bitter, to one for whom such ties had hitherto been known only in name and idea, and it brought more vividly to his thoughts the part of his mother's story which related to her infant daughter, so early lost, so deeply injured by her mother's imprudent and blind weakness. Should he ever discover this deserted one, speak to her of their parent's suffering and penitence, and taste the sweetness of the love and <choice>
                     <sic>symapthy</sic>
                     <corr>sympathy</corr>
                  </choice> that should exist between the children of one mother, sharers in the same misfortunes, and probably receiving the same cold scorn from an unjust world!</p>
               <p>Gerard's eyes moistened at the imaginary picture of his young sister's desolation; and, brief as was the indulgence of the weakness, it enabled him to command himself for the necessary and instant trial of meeting with and explaining his position to Lord Hargrave. He dashed the drops from his cheeks, and folding up the still open sheets that contained such a world of suffering in their unconscious pages, he rang the bell, and desired the servant to inform Lord Hargrave that he waited his pleasure, when it might be convenient to him to grant him an interview. In a few moments the earl entered the room.</p>
               <p>"I fear, my young friend, I need not ask you the nature of your information," he said, kindly, after a quick glance at Gerard's face; "and you will believe, I wish for no confidence as to its details, unless it will relieve you to give it."</p>
               <p>"My lord, my dear lord," said the young man, to whose excited feelings the slightest word or look of kindness was a dangerous trial, "pardon me if I do not gratify my own earnest desire to tell you all, and profit by your counsel and pity; but all I ought to tell you, is, that my mother was innocent in heart and intention—that she was the victim of circumstances; and I, the unhappy offspring of an illegal marriage, am left to suffer for the guilt and imprudence of the authors of my life."</p>
               <p>"Not so, Gerard," said the earl, with a gentle dignity that calmed the young man's warring feelings by its impressive simplicity and kindness; "no man is a victim unless he weakly yields to circumstances, instead of mastering them. An honorable profession, a glorious career is open to you; your story need never be known to the world with whom you will mingle, and you will not be the first, or even the thousandth, who 'has forced men to honor even the <hi rend="i"/>bar sinister on their open shield.' Here is your commission as ensign, which I have only now received from the Horse Guards. It is a regiment that will probably be ere long ordered off to India, and in that distant land you will only have to depend on your good sword, and your manly firmness in right, to acquire fame, respect, and fortune. Do not disgrace your epaulettes, or discredit my recommendation of you, by giving way to useless dejection, or sitting down under an imaginary and adverse fate."</p>
               <p>Gerard took the outstretched hand of the earl, with an unconscious convulsiveness of grasp, which spoke more forcibly than words could have done of strong feeling and resolute self-control.</p>
               <p>"I will accept the motive you have given me for exertion, my dear lord," said Gerard; "but do not judge me harshly for feeling the bitterness of a trial I cannot explain in its varied torture even to you. The whole happiness, the dreams, the hopes of my life are ruined for ever by the facts I have just learned, and a man must be made of stone to bear such anguish without shrinking from the dreary years that are opened before him. But there is a glorious death, as well as an honorable life, in a soldier's future, and that is some consolation."</p>
               <p>"Gerard," said the earl, in the quiet tones of long-conquered feeling, "I was not much older than yourself when I too was anticipating a brilliant and happy career in the Eastern empire, which seemed then, as now, our most promising field for glory and fortune. I had an ancient name, a sufficient fortune, a young and lovely wife, a new-born heir of all the wealth and honors, and I had vowed to win. Many envied me, and I thought no one so worthy of envy as myself; but a storm came suddenly, and swept away every hope and happiness of my life. In less than one short week I was a widower and childless, and life became one long blank to my blighted, darkened mind. Yet I lived on, and fought, and struggled, for duty, if not for happiness. Titles and estates came to me as if in mockery, and many wondered I did not marry, for the sake of an heir. But no one guessed the reason that influenced me, and which was even more powerful than my undying love for my lost wife; and that reason, if it gradually loses in strength, as my hopes fade of their vividness, still exists, though buried in my own breast. Frederick Grenville is still heir to my possessions, and I am by degrees learning to plan and hope for him as I once did for myself; but, alas! how different to one of my own blood, my—"</p>
               <p>The earl's voice gave way for an instant; but he mastered the emotion almost before it could be noticed by his companion, and went on in his former calm tone.</p>
               <p>"I did not mean to trouble you with my sorrows, Gerard, except to prove to you that others, as young and ardent as yourself, have suffered as intensely, and have lived to acknowledge that there may be contentment, satisfaction, and even happiness, after all the dearest objects and hopes of the heart are gone for ever. It is difficult to believe in the experience of others; but if I am correct in my judgment of you, mine may not be altogether thrown away on a temperament not unlike my own."</p>
               <p>Lord Hargrave rose as he spoke, and Gerard involuntarily imitated the movement, and stood beside his patron before the large pier glass that occupied half that side of the apartment. Again he started unconsciously as the faces and figures met his view, reflected in the clear mirror; so strangely like in feature, in height; so identical in the grave and subdued expression of the moment. Gerard's complexion was fairer, his eyes more full and soft, shaded as they were by lashes of <choice>
                     <sic>femenine</sic>
                     <corr>feminine</corr>
                  </choice> length and beauty, and the mouth fuller and more beautifully shaped than the earl's; but with this difference, and the natural lines of age, the likeness was strikingly visible to an observer. Lord Hargrave saw Gerard's momentary look of surprise, and a sad smile crossed his own features.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said he, "I have noticed the same thing, Gerard; and one might be weak enough to assign for the phenomenon some more romantic cause than the kindred that exists distantly between us; but to me it only proves the similarity between our inward natures, and binds me more closely to you than mere sympathy or gratitude can do. My boy, you shall never need a friend while I live; and if you feel any obligation to me for present or future exertions for you, let it be shown in your fortitude, and strenuous exertions in the career I have opened for you."</p>
               <p>Gerard could not speak, lest his voice should betray the choking emotion that he struggled to conceal; but the look and grasp of the hand which replied to his patron's words satisfied Lord Hargrave that his confidence was not misplaced.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes Gerard was hastily walking to his lonely apartments, and the earl was once more alone with the memories of the past, which the recent scene had conjured up in fresh and unusual vividness before him.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLIV.</head>
               <p>ANDREW GUILDFORD was once more at Garron's Hill, but under very different circumstances, and, to all outward seeming, with far happier and brighter prospects than he had yet known since his accession to the estate. Some singular good fortune must have befallen him, or his skillful agent, Mr. Styles, had proved an extraordinary clever manager of the affairs intrusted to him. The debts that had pressed upon him had been paid, the dreary mansion renovated and refurnished, and many of the half ruined apartments converted into comfortable and even tasteful rooms.</p>
               <p>Mr. Styles had sent for workmen and upholsterers from Dublin about three weeks before his patron's return, and under his active supervision they had effected wonders during the short time which elapsed between the arrival of the orders and that of the owner of the spot where they were to be carried into effect. The grounds were of course less rapidly amenable to the hands employed on them. Flowers, and shrubs, and grass, will not spring up at pleasure, though the creations of man can be remodelled at his will, and the long-neglected gardens and shrubberies of Garron's Hill were not to be forced into the aspect of well-tended and tastefully laid-out grounds in a few short weeks; still, much could be, and much was done, to remedy the desolation that pervaded the whole place. The turf was mown, the walks were swept, the shrubs and hedges trimmed, and the beds dug up, till an appearance of freshness and neatness was spread over the whole spot which could scarcely have been looked for in so short a time.</p>
               <p>Of course, rumor was busy as to the cause of all this sudden activity, and, in spite of all the reserve and caution observed by Mr. Styles and his subordinates, it gradually oozed out, that the "Justice" was going to bring down some grand company from London, who were to remain for some weeks at Garron's Hill.</p>
               <p>"Dear me," observed old Mr. Adams; "why, Norah, my pet, what a pity your sister and Ned are not at home while this is going on! It would have done poor Fan good, and Ned might have had a chance of making his way with the young Englishwoman, as I hear she is the relative of some lord or other."</p>
               <p>"And who is it that is really coming, papa?" asked Norah, with a composure that the brilliant prospects, or rather their disappointment, painted by her father, did not at all ruffle.</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear," replied her father, "there's a grand English lady and her daughter, and one of the first gentlemen about London, as I'm told; but it's a secret at present, and I only learnt the names by an accident, from meeting Mr. Style's clerk,—a poor, half-starved gossoon. It's a Mrs. Rivers and her daughter, and Mr. Saville, and I don't know if there are any more; but any way, it's to be very gay while they're here, I'm told; and as I said, it would put Saint Patrick in a range to hear that Ned and Fanny are in foreign parts, like a couple of gypsies, wandering no one knows where.<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6520-00000078"/> Bad luck to that young rascal that is the real cause of it, I say; the worthless young—"</p>
               <p>"Hush, papa," said Norah, putting her hand before his lips; "remember your promise to Fanny before she went away, that you would never blame Gerard for what was no fault of his. It was a mistake, a very sad mistake, but I trust not a fatal one, on my dear sister's part. And Gerard was honorable and good to confess the truth, especially when he was in such trouble."</p>
               <p>Norah had always had more influence with her father than any other of his children, except William; and since she had been left alone with him her power had increased. William was still his trusted and vaunted heir; but Norah was his real comfort and <choice>
                     <sic>sumbeam</sic>
                     <corr>sunbeam</corr>
                  </choice> in the unwonted clouds that had come over the cheerful Bally Adams. In truth, there was need of some such brave, bright spirit as Norah's. Fanny's extreme delicacy and depression of mind and body had made a complete change imperative; and it had been decided after much deliberation that Edward should accompany her and a widowed aunt to Italy for some months, and William, though now fully recovered from his severe disappointment at Mabel's rejection, as far as any lingering affection for her was concerned, was yet singularly changed by that episode in his life. There was greater strength and decision in his whole tone of character, that gave dignity to his formerly shy and rustic manner, and added the charm of expression to his fine features. Then, too, his intellect came more into play, from his increased devotion to books, and the few accomplishments he possessed, but which scarcely added to his attractions in his matter-of-fact father's opinion. In truth, Mabel's brief visit, and his evident distastefulness to her, seemed to have acted as a spur to his nearly dormant faculties, and the Cymon of Bally Adams bade fair to become a very different person under the influence, not of the love, but the dislike displayed towards him by the beautiful object of his adoration.</p>
               <p>From this brief sketch of the changes in the number and the characteristics of the family at Bally Adams, it will readily be imagined that its sociable and bustling head would gladly welcome any prospect of variety and gaiety that might break the quiet and monotony of his small domestic circle, as well as from a comforting theory in his own mind as to the chances of repayment of his missing bond, out of the improved and ample funds of the prosperous owner of Garron's Hill.</p>
               <p>"I shall of course go over to call on your old friend, as soon as he returns, Norah," continued the garrulous proprietor, after a few minutes' silence. "Will you go with me, as there are ladies visiting there, or shall I tell them you and William will drive over afterwards, eh, my little jewel? They wont cut out my little girl, any how, I'll go bail."</p>
               <p>"Better you go first, papa, and then you can judge whether the ladies are likely to appreciate a call from me," replied Norah. "You know, Mr. Guildford was never a great favorite of mine, and I have no especial wish to be demonstrative to his friends."</p>
               <p>"Ah, you have your wits about you, Norah, mavourneen; you're my true daughter; very like your brother William before he took to those muddling books. Favorite, no! He's no cause to be a favorite with any of us at present; but we shall see, we shall see. I'll ride over the moment I hear he's come, and then, if he behaves like a gentleman, why—"</p>
               <p>What the qualifications of a gentleman in Adam's opinions were, he did not then explain to his daughter, and as Norah was not in his financial secrets, she had no means of comprehending the half-finished sentence, and with a quiet "Very well, papa," she dropped the subject.</p>
               <p>Norah little divined how important might be the result of a visit, which appeared to her so perfectly indifferent, if not disagreeable, in her present mood, or she would scarcely have dismissed the subject so abruptly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams carried out the purpose he had announced to his daughter, and what was more remarkable, performed his promise to the letter and spirit of its intention.</p>
               <p>On the second day after the arrival of Mr. Guildford and his visitors at Garron's Hill, the well-known figures of Mr. Adams and Black Jack were to be seen trotting up the avenue at their usual sober, jogging pace; and as the well-known objects presented themselves, the remembrance of the unlucky Paddy Darby came forcibly to the farmer's mind. It was there he had first seen him, and formed his earliest suspicion of Guildford's honesty; and there, within a short distance from the spot, had occurred the memorable episode of the pistol shot, and the tacit acknowledgement of the truth and danger of Paddy's statement. And with these memories returned the uncomfortable idea of the disappearance of his bond, his last application for his money, and also Guildford's doubtful title to the property, on which the only hope of his getting the cherished thousand rested. The improvement everywhere manifested appeared, however, to promise better things than these uncomfortable visions of the past portended; and with an application of the one blunted spur, and a crack of the whip in Black Jack's ears, both horse and rider plucked up heart, and trotted briskly to the door of the mansion.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Guildford is at home," said the man, "and I will inquire whether he is disengaged."</p>
               <p>There was an air of official smartness and consequence in the man's manner that to an experienced observer would have betokened an advance in the master's position; and with an insolence to which Adams was quite unaccustomed, he was left standing in the hall, while the servant went to announce his presence to his master. A change however seemed to come over the man's manner after his interview with his master; for when he returned he respectfully requested the visitor to follow him to the library.</p>
               <p>Adams obeyed the summons with as much assumption of importance as he could manage under the novel influence of a London servant and the handsome aspect of the familiar old hall, and in another moment was ushered into the presence of the Justice of Garron's Hill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Guildford was as much changed in appearance as his whole <foreign xml:lang="FRA">entourage</foreign> could be. His downcast, gloomy expression had given place to a half-supercilious, half-jovial air, that ill-suited his strong, dark features; his dress was handsome and fashionable, his thick black hair arranged jauntily and with unwonted neatness over his forehead, and the once suspiciously concealed linen shone out in snowy whiteness, with <choice>
                     <sic>fearles</sic>
                     <corr>fearless</corr>
                  </choice> display.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Adams," said the Justice; "glad te see you, my old friend. Very kind of you to come so soon after my return; but why did you not bring your pretty daughter with you? I hear that the eldest is abroad, but that's the more reason why Miss Norah should console herself with other society."</p>
               <p>"I heard you have got some ladies here," broke in Adams, bluntly. "I heard it before you came; but you see, my good sir, there are so many reports got up, and so much deceit and cunning in the world, that there's no knowing what to believe. And pon my honor I shall doubt soon that I'm myself, or that Bally Adams is my own, and not somebody else's."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! very good; you've grown quite witty, my good sir, in my absence," said Guildford; "but in this instance you must not have the slightest hesitation in believing what I can give you most fair proof is true. Shall I take you to the ladies at once, my good friend? They are visible, I know, though it is rather early for London habits."</p>
               <p>"Why no," said Adams; "that is, I wanted just to say a word to you, and I'm rather pressed for time, you see, and Norah and her brother can come over and pay their respects, and I'm not much used to fine ladies, and—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, all right," said Guildford; "just as you please. I'm at your service in any way, my good friend. What is it? Can I be of any use to you, or to your family?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Guildford, seemed determined to be complaisant and complying, whatever his visitor's response might be to his courtesy; and Adams was more perplexed by this excess of politeness than he would have been by the roughest reception he could have met with from his debtor.</p>
               <p>"Hum, ah, yes, I'm much obliged," replied Adams; "but I want only what's my own lawfully and honestly, without being beholden to any man. You see, my dear sir, when,—that is, of course you have not forgotten that little transaction about the bond you gave me for a thousand pounds; and you see, the interest for three quarters is now due; and if it is quite convenient to repay the principal, I could employ the money; still, of course, I've no wish to be in the least pressing or troublesome, only—"</p>
               <p>"My dear sir, apologies about such a little matter of business as ours are quite unnecessary," said Guildford. "You have only to bring me the bond, and I will soon arrange the matter; but I really cannot do anything except in a proper and regular manner. Mr. Styles—"</p>
               <p>Adams fidgeted on his chair at the name, and then broke in with, "Well, really, Mr. Guildford, I did not scruple to accommodate you with the money, and it seems to me a very poor return for the kindness, that you should stickle at the veriest trifle. Why, surely my receipt in full would be enough, at any rate for the interest due."</p>
               <p>"And suppose," said Guildford, "I only say suppose, the bond had fallen into other hands, and the person holding it were to claim either interest or principal, or both, what would be my position then?"</p>
               <p>"Then you refuse to pay me, Mr. Guildford," said Adams, after a moment's hesitation.</p>
               <p>"Certainly not, my dear sir," replied Guildford; "only I require to see the bond before paying the interest, and to have it delivered up on paying the principal. You have only to perform this simple condition, to obtain your money."</p>
               <p>There was a sore struggle in the mind of the unlucky owner of Bally Adams as the Justice spoke. Should he confess his loss and throw himself on the generosity of his debtor? should be threaten him with the disclosure of his secret, or wait till some further information should come from Ryan before he took any steps in the matter? He decided on a middle course.</p>
               <p>"There is reason in what you say, my dear sir," said Adams, "but between friends, you know, matters are different, and, as I need not tell you, we have all some hold over one another, it is never safe to make enemies who may have some things in their keeping that we should not like revealed."</p>
               <p>"Surely you are not in that category, my good friend," said Guildford, smiling sarcastically. "Mr. Adams of Bally Adams can have nothing he fears being known."</p>
               <p>"Nothing that he has ever done himself, Mr. Guildford," retorted the proprietor; "but there may be many dark deeds that involve honest people with scoundrels, and they will come to light, depend on it, especially if matters are carried too far."</p>
               <p>"And has the bond, about which you seem to make so much mystery, anything to<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6520-00000079"/> do with these remarks of yours, Mr. Adams?"</p>
               <p>"It has this to do with it, Mr. Guildford; that if there is foul play, or has been foul play, either with deeds or men, there are witnesses who will not spare money or trouble to discover the authors of both. And once more, I would advise you, as a friend, to act as honorably and fairly by me as I wish to do by you, if you let me. It would not be safe to 'remove' Adams of Bally Adams, whatever may be done with less well-known folks."</p>
               <p>Guildford started, in spite of all his self-control and previous preparation. This favorite phrase of Bryant's, used by the man who alone of all the neighborhood possessed any clue to his real position, gave him an unpleasant suspicion that there might be some dangerous collusion between the brigand and the owner of Bally Adams, which augured ill for his safety; but he instinctively felt that, at this hint, it would be the worst policy imaginable to change his tactics suddenly; and quickly recovering his composure, he replied, in his former bland tones, "I quite agree with you, my excellent friend; and, as I before said, there is nothing like straightforward dealings to ensure the continuance of friendship, I shall be delighted to close our little transaction as quickly as possible on the very simple and just condition I proposed. And now, shall we go to the ladies?"</p>
               <p>"No, I thank you," replied the ruffled proprietor; "I must be going; I have some important business to settle, and I certainly shall not be induced again to sacrifice my true interests for the sake of any man, or woman either. I only repent having been so good-natured as I was fool enough to be, and I shall act differently for the future. Good-day, Mr. Guildford."</p>
               <p>With enigmatical remarks Mr. Adams took leave, with the coldest possible return to Mr. Guildford's friendly grasp of the hand that fingers could express.</p>
               <p>After the departure of his visitor, Guildford remained in moody thought. In spite of his apparent hardihood, heavy and menacing terrors haunted his guilty mind.</p>
               <p>"Is it ever to be thus?" he murmured; "am I never to be free from these degrading threats, these weak alarms of every fool that chooses to meddle in what does not concern him? No sooner is one insolent scoundrel silenced than another springs up, as it were, from his ashes, like ghosts from the grave. Cootes and Ryan are gone for ever, and their secret buried with them. Styles will be discreet for his own sake. My affairs are retrieved, thanks to my own skill and Ronald's good management; but now, when all promise well, and I begin to breathe freely, and to enjoy the fruits of my own daring and cleverness, this earth-worm, this Irish clod-breaker, starts up to strike me! But he had better beware. Before I will be bullied, or ruined by him, I will see him and his boorish son as deep in the caverns of the Rath as ever the rascally Ryan can lie. And the more determined I am not to yield, the less certain he will feel of the truth of his half-learnt story. He only knows part; he does not know who is the rightful heir. No, nor shall he ever suspect the real secret of that insane will. Least of all does the person most concerned guess the truth; nor can the most malicious ferret that ever drew breath scent it out, thanks to—"</p>
               <p>A slight knock at the door startled the Justice; it was low and gentle, but decided in its light, quick touch; and Guildford soon guessed who was the applicant for admission, though it did not suit his purpose to act on the suspicion.</p>
               <p>"Come in," he said, hastily pushing some papers into a drawer near him.</p>
               <p>The door opened, and the commanding and still handsome figure of his guest, Mrs. Rivers, entered. She was dressed in a rich black moire-antique, that swept in graceful folds on the ground with every movement of the stately wearer, and added to the dignity of her naturally queen-like figure.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Rivers's features were finely formed and her complexion, hair, and eyes still in excellent preservation: but the effect of time was most discernible in the hard lines about her mouth, and the keen, penetrating expression of her brilliant black eyes. There was no mistaking that determined, strong will which shone out in every glance, and that brooked no opposition when once expressed. Yet the voice was singularly soft and gentle, and the way of speaking slow, deliberate, almost deferential, when it suited her purpose. In truth, it ill accorded with that somewhat masculine form and face—that feminine manner, but it was apparently second nature to her.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Rivers," exclaimed Guildford, in apparent surprise, "what has occasioned this visit? I thought you were with your daughter in the drawing-room."</p>
               <p>"And apparently you wish that I was there still," she replied, in her soft tones, and seating herself unbidden in a large chair opposite her host; but it is time, Andrew, that we understood each other."</p>
               <p>"I thought we did so long since," said the Justice, uneasily. "What more do you want, Bertha?"</p>
               <p>"I want justice," she replied, calmly. "Have you yet made up your mind as to the question I proposed to you in London?"</p>
               <p>"I—I really cannot tell why you should be so urgent," stammered Guildford. "Surely there is plenty of time when my arrangements are complete."</p>
               <p>"Scarcely, Andrew," she replied, calmly. "It is necessary that I should understand what I am to depend upon, in order to guide my future course. Are you prepared to acknowledge me as your lawful wife?"</p>
               <p>Guildford started up, and went hastily to the door, opened it, and looked cautiously round.</p>
               <p>"You are incautious, Bertha," said the Justice. "It is quite unnecessary to speak so broadly, where hints will do as well. One never knows who may be listening, though my people know pretty well—"</p>
               <p>"My voice is not very powerful," said Mrs. Rivers, in the same soft tones, "but my will is perhaps as strong as yours. Once more, will you answer my question?"</p>
               <p>"Do you mean—ahem—of course you allude to some future time?" said Guildford, moving his chair still nearer to the lady's, and attempting to take her hand, which was calmly and gently withdrawn, without one movement that could disturb either face or toilette.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me," she said, "I am speaking of the present."</p>
               <p>"My dear Bertha," said Mr. Guildford, "you know how I am situated—only just recovering from my difficulties, and my position here scarcely secure. Were I to marry—at least, I should rather say, to confess I am married—it would at once quicken every feeling of animosity against me, and bring a host of harpies on me; besides, that scoundrel Styles must be first thoroughly silenced: in short, I—"</p>
               <p>"You refuse, sir?" said Mrs. Rivers, still more gently than before.</p>
               <p>"Not refuse," said Guildford, "oh no. It is my intention, my earnest desire; only, you see, if I do but become thoroughly master of my property here, and my debts paid, there will be no difficulty, and I can then offer you a position worthy of you. You see, it is worth waiting for, Bertha."</p>
               <p>"I choose to assume my proper place at once, Andrew, and I intend to do so," returned the lady, without raising her voice one single note higher than before, though her dark eyes were fixed with the unflinching gaze of a rattlesnake on the unsteady glance of her companion.</p>
               <p>"I fancy you will need my consent to that bargain," said Guildford, trying to smile. "But you were always a sad tyrant, Bertha, and fond of tormenting your victims."</p>
               <p>"I have no wish to take, or give unnecessary trouble," she replied. "I have very little to say, except to warn you, Andrew Guildford, that I am not to be trifled with. Our marriage, however irregular, was a real one in the sight of God and the Church to which I belong. It suits me now to have it acknowledged, after twenty long years of patience, and—"</p>
               <p>"Patience!" repeated Guildford. "Why, you refused to marry publicly the poor dependant of old Michael Garron, and for years and years I did not know whether you were living or dead; and now you venture to talk of—"</p>
               <p>"Hush, hush, Andrew, no need to become excited," she interrupted, with irritating coolness. "It is useless to rake up the past, but my mind is made up as to the present. You must acknowledge me, or you will repent your refusal for ever."</p>
               <p>"Woman, you are mad!" exclaimed Guildford, angrily. "You dare not, for your own sake. You would starve but for my allowance to you; and besides—"</p>
               <p>"I could command far more than the paltry sum you offer me as the price of the secrets I could reveal," she said, interrupting him. "Do not deceive yourself, Andrew; I have you in my power. I know all."</p>
               <p>"All!" repeated Guildford; "I do not understand you, Bertha. Of course you know—and I never concealed from you—that there is a defect in my title here, and it would be very ungenerous of you to take advantage of my confidence. At the same time I have not been altogether so unguarded as to put you entirely in possession of the peculiarities of the case, and I rather doubt that you have full value to offer for any such remuneration as you allude to."</p>
               <p>Not a muscle of the lady's face had moved during the hesitating speech of the Justice. She waited patiently till he had finished; then said, calmly, "Indeed! Perhaps I should do more wisely to leave you in possession of your comfortable conviction; but I have a lingering regard for you, for old times' sake, and I do not wish you to hang yourself by giving you as much rope as you are inclined to take. You doubt the extent of my informant? Listen! You perhaps have some acquaintance with one Ronald of the Rath, though it suited him and you to ignore the style and title, but I scarcely think it is quite lost in the aristocratic Reginald Saville."</p>
               <p>Guildford was about to speak: the words "Captain Grenville" were on his lips, but she waved her hand with a commanding gesture.</p>
               <p>"Stop till I have finished," she said; "and if I am wrong, correct me. There is no harm in listening either to truth or falsehood. We will put it supposititiously, if you please. Suppose Mr. Saville is Ronald of the Rath, and by some felicitous arrangement you and he managed to gain enough in the gambling saloons of London to extricate you from the difficulties that threatened to ruin all that you had risked so much to gain; suppose the mode in which the large sums were gained is sufficiently questionable to come within the grasp of the law? But that you will say, is but a trifle, and one that may be easily got over by so skilful a tactician. We will go on: Suppose an estate was obtained by illegal means—means that would bring the neck in close proximity to the rope, and in order to prevent the crime from being detected it was found expedient, necessary, to commit another, and a still more atrocious one? We will not call it by the name usually given to such transactions, even when it is necessary to remove a troublesome witness; it is an ugly word, mur—"</p>
               <p>"S'death! silence, woman, witch—what<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6520-00000080"/> ever you are!" shouted Guildford, losing all presence of mind at the unexpected disclosure. "Take care, or you will drive me to desperation, and I cannot answer for my own deeds, even where you may be concerned."</p>
               <p>"What! you would have me removed also I suppose," said she, calmly reclining in her chair, without a change of color or movement of muscle. "Stay a moment; I have not quite done. We can talk over the future when we have fully explained the present. Listen for a few moments more and my tale is finished. The troublesome witness of whom I spoke had but a half knowledge of the matter. He knew well that the estate you possess had been willed to the heirs of an old friend, long since dead. Those heirs had disappeared; be knew not even their names, by which he might find them in the wide world into which they had gone forth, unconscious of their rights. He knew not that there were doubts as to the lawful right of the apparent heir, the nearest in male descent to the original legatee; nor did he, nor any one living, but myself, know that there is one whose claims are undoubted, to whom the inheritance would revert in the failure of either the life or legal proofs as to the supposed heir. Andrew Guildford, you are but a clumsy plotter after all; your crime has brought the curse of blood on your hands without securing your ill-gotten gains."</p>
               <p>With a fascinated gaze, and pale cheek and lips, the master of Garron's Hill had listened to the low, soft accents which contrasted so strangely with the terrible truth they spoke. Then came a low, muttered curse, and the half-smothered words, "The traitor! He shall pay for this!"</p>
               <p>"Which traitor?" asked the smiling syren, "yourself, or—you know not whom?"</p>
               <p>"Curse you, and the villain who betrayed me!" said Guildford, in deep tones of concentrated rage and fear. "I know that it cannot be—" He stopped, considering that he was committing himself by mentioning the name which was on his lips.</p>
               <p>"You are determined I shall give all the information in my power to-day, my good friend," returned Mrs. Rivers, whose humor seemed improving with her companion's loss of self-command. "Is it Bryant, or our accomplished friend, Mr. Reginald Saville, or, as between ourselves, we may familiarly call him, Ronald of the Rath, that you think could not reveal your little secrets? It really matters very little who gave me the valuable information, since I know the whole facts."</p>
               <p>"But it does matter, madam," said Guildford, half choking with suppressed and helpless rage. "I will be revenged on some one for this, and it may as well be on the villain who deserves it. Bryant would hardly dare to betray a deed be did himself; and Ronald, for his father's sake, would—"</p>
               <p>"Mistaken again, my friend," said Mrs. Rivers. "Bryant did not do the deed, but a man now under sentence in Carlow jail, and to whom a charge more or less is of little consequence; and as to Ronald, he cares little about a man whose reputed relationship is only a disgrace to him. I tell you there is no chance for you but in my assistance and influence. If you will comply with my terms, I will guarantee you from harm from the true heirs of Garron's Hill; and as to the rest, a little tact and liberality will settle all satisfactorily."</p>
               <p>"And your terms, what are they?" said Guildford, gloomily.</p>
               <p>"Immediate and public marriage, without any reference to the past," replied Mrs. Rivers; "a thousand pounds down for immediate expenses, and your pledge that I shall dictate the bequest of your estate to whomsoever I please."</p>
               <p>"Are you mad?" exclaimed Guildford, literally paralysed by the audacity of the demand.</p>
               <p>"Not at all," she replied quietly. "It may suit me to leave the property, of which I secure to you a life interest, to a child of our own, should we have any, which is not probable, or I might take a fit of repentance, and restore it to the rightful heir, or I might choose to make Adeline the heiress of Garron's Hill. What think you of the last plan, Mr. Guildford?"</p>
               <p>"Adeline!—your daughter, nobody's daughter, the heiress of my estate!" said Guildford. "Never, while I live!"</p>
               <p>"That's a pity, Andrew, because it is so much better to do a thing from choice than compulsion," returned Mrs. Rivers. "If it continues to suit my ideas, Adeline will be the heiress; and if she makes a proper marriage, I doubt not I shall carry out my intentions."</p>
               <p>"Fool that I was, ever to be led away by such a fiend in woman's form!" groaned Guildford. "What should hinder me from exposing you and your machinations to the world, and giving up to justice the villains, the smugglers, through whose means you support yourself? Better ruin—death itself, than such degrading bondage!"</p>
               <p>"As you please, sir; only make your election," said Mrs. Rivers, rising. "My patience is waning, though I wished to give you every reasonable chance; but I can really spend no more time in such weak trifling. Which do you choose?"</p>
               <p>A moment's deep silence ensued. Guildford sat half crouching in his chair, his face hidden in his hands, musing on all possible means of escape, on all the reasons that could influence his momentous decision. The splendid figure of his companion stood calmly opposite to him, her arm resting lightly on the chimney-piece, her brilliant eyes fixed on the subdued and cowering man before her with an expression of quiet scorn and triumph which spoke of certain victory. Then she moved slightly; the rustle of her dress was just perceptible enough to rouse Guildford from his abstraction. He looked up, gazed steadily in the quiet face that spoke far more plainly than words the immobility of its resolve, and then came the words, slowly, but firmly, "I consent."</p>
               <p>"To the whole of my terms?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"I have no alternative," he replied. "You would only laugh at me if I pretended to yield to aught but compulsion."</p>
               <p>"You are candid for once," said Mrs. Rivers; "and so much the better for you. Now be so good as to write the arrangement on paper, and we will both sign it."</p>
               <p>Guildford still complied with the arbitrary behest; he quickly wrote her conditions, signed them, and gave her the pen. She hesitated a moment.</p>
               <p>"There is one thing omitted," she said. "When is the marriage to take place?"—"Soon—when it can be managed," he replied; "but—"</p>
               <p>"What say you to this day month?" she asked. "That must be time enough for every preparation."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, certainly, every preparation," said the Justice. "So be it, madam, this day month."</p>
               <p>He hastily added it to the paper, and then Mrs. Rivers signed it, coolly folded it up, placed it in her pocket, and left the room.</p>
               <p>"Fool that I have been!" muttered the unfortunate victim of superior skill and courage; "I have placed myself in the power of all whom I deemed my agents, my slaves. I employed Bryant safely enough till this rascal Ronald came on the scene, with his tempting offers and cleverly-laid plans. Clever, indeed!—why, he has made a tool of me, while carefully keeping out of the share he laid. It was I who threw the dice, I who pocketed the gains. And then, that affair on the hill, who could have imagined that he would have trusted such a secret to any one, least of all a woman! And yet, I have a hold over him too. He stole the bond, forced old Adams's bureau. I can checkmate him there! And yet, no, I have no proof, especially without criminating myself, for the only evidence of the crime was his name in the envelope of the deed, and that I burnt, together with the bond itself. And have I no hold? no chance? Must I publicly re-marry this woman, and yield to her cursed tyranny? Not if there is power in money, or unscrupulous will. I will baulk her yet."</p>
               <p>Again he fell into a fit of musing, but was soon interrupted by another and more decided application for admittance than Mrs. Rivers's gentle knock.</p>
               <p>"Who's there?" he growled angrily.</p>
               <p>"I, sir—O'Neil," was the reply; and the clerk just appeared inside the door of the apartment.</p>
               <p>"What is it, you idiot?" asked the Justice, angrily.</p>
               <p>"Please, sir, here's Cassidy, from Athy, come for a warrant. He has been robbed, sir, and he believes it's the people in the Rath who have done it."</p>
               <p>"Thinks—believes—you fool!" said Guildford. "Am I to be at the mercy of all the gaping, dreaming idiots in the county round! Will he swear to the facts?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, sir, he's quite ready to swear it."</p>
               <p>"That's of course," said the Justice; "but I'm not going to grant warrants because people will perjure themselves to get them. Let Cassidy, and his witnesses, and the two constables, attend in my justice room, and I'll look into it."</p>
               <p>O'Neil retired, and in a few moments was followed by his master, with a black and frowning face that boded little good to the complainant. But, in spite of all his brow-beating and severe examination, the evidence was so clear that he could not evade the demand for a warrant without a grosser breach of justice than even he dared to venture upon.</p>
               <p>A shop in Athy had been broken open, and one witness, a shepherd lad, actually swore to having seen the goods conveyed into the wood on the previous night. The emergency was a sudden and unfortunate one, and Guildford inwardly execrated the cupidity and folly of Bryant and his gang in running such risks while Ryan's body might yet be discovered in the deep caverns of the Rath. His only resource was in gaining time.</p>
               <p>"When do you propose to make the search, my good friend?" he said, turning to Cassidy with a sudden change of manner. "This is a case of considerable importance, as it threatens, at last, to implicate positively these men who have so often evaded justice. I have therefore determined to go myself with the constables, and superintend the search in person."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, your worship," replied the man; "we shall go at once, for we have brought torches with us, and are well armed, and there is not an hour to be lost."</p>
               <p>"Torches!" repeated Guildford, uneasily.</p>
               <p>"Yes, your worship," replied Cassidy, scarcely suppressing a grin. "It would be a queer search in the dark; and I'm very glad your honor's going, for not only am I sure that my property is there, but I expect a lot more will be discovered. Who knows?"</p>
               <p>"Who knows, indeed!" repeated Guildford. "But I must prepare myself a little. In an hour I will be with you; and meantime you had better go below, and get something to eat and drink. O'Neil, tell Mrs. Reilly to see to these people, and take care they have all they want to make them comfortable."</p>
               <p>The complainant and his witnesses, and the yet more astonished constables, accepted<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6520-00000081"/> with humble gratitude the condescending kindness of the hitherto severe and haughty Justice, and at once retired to the kitchen, where a plentiful repast with an unlimited supply of whisky was set before them.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XLV.</head>
               <p>THE hour named by Mr. Guildford quickly passed, and no one noticed the lapse of time; another hour was more than half gone ere the persons below were summoned to the room where the Justice awaited them.</p>
               <p>"Well, my good friends, I would not interrupt you before," he said, in his most bland tones, "but duty must be attended to, and I think we ought to set out at once."</p>
               <p>The unlucky loser of the goods, now recalled to a sense of his misfortune, eagerly assented, and the party set forth on their errand. As they left Garron's Hill one of the constables observed a thick smoke rising in the distance, and as he pointed it out to his companions a pistol shot was heard.</p>
               <p>"The rascals!" he exclaimed; "that is a signal of danger. They have got wind of our approach, and we must be prepared."</p>
               <p>"Who can have warned them?" said Cassidy, with a keen glance at the Justice.</p>
               <p>Guildford was about to reply, when an unexpected reinforcement arrived in the persons of Mr. Adams and his son, who walked deliberately up to the party without the slightest appearance of surprise.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Mr. Guildford; said Adams. "We have come to give our poor help as good subjects in routing out the vagabonds you are going to visit. I take it you cannot be too strong for them."</p>
               <p>"Ah—yes—very good," said Guilford; "always ready, Mr. Adams, as usual. But numbers are not always desirable; and as you are not concerned in this little affair, it appears to me that it may be as well to leave it to the authorities, and persons immediately interested in it."</p>
               <p>"Interested!" repeated Adams. "I should think I am interested, Mr. Guildford, when I lost in money ten times as much as my good neighbor here, to say nothing of—"</p>
               <p>A look from his son stopped him, and William hastily took up the sentence he had interrupted.</p>
               <p>"My father is right, Mr. Guildford," said he. "There is really no doubt how and where our stolen property went; and it is only justice to give us every facility for recovering it. We shall not interfere, but I must certainly demand your permission to accompany your party to the Rath."</p>
               <p>William's quiet air of decision was not to be trifled with, and Guildford sullenly bowed in acquiescence to the request.</p>
               <p>The party, thus increased, now moved quickly on, and soon arrived at the entrance to the wood which led to the Rath. Guildford's utmost self-command could not prevent some trace of his extreme agitation betraying itself to William Adam's keen eyes. His face was ghastly pale, his eyes restless and troubled, and his lips absolutely quivered, when he attempted to reply to Mr. Adams's garrulous remarks, or William's acute suggestions as to the <choice>
                     <sic>precautious</sic>
                     <corr>precautions</corr>
                  </choice> to be observed as they proceeded.</p>
               <p>"We had better form a more compact body, Mr. Guildford," he remarked, as they approached the Rath. "If they have any idea of our approach, they will probably pick out any stragglers."</p>
               <p>Guildford devoutly wished they would pick out the speaker and his meddling father, but he could not refuse so reasonable a piece of advice; and, in the compact phalanx recommended by the young man the little party advanced.</p>
               <p>The precaution appeared needless. All was silent. Not a sound was to be heard, not a human being was seen, as they came near to the closed door. The constables pushed vigorously against it. It was apparently bolted from within, and for a few minutes resisted all their efforts; but a few vigorous blows settled the rotten fastenings of the old door. It yielded to the pressure, and the party, headed by William Adams, rushed in, eager to discover and seize the tenants of the robber's hold.</p>
               <p>All was dark and silent. The torches were hastily kindled to discover the hidden and silent inhabitants of the ruin, and eagerly flashed round every corner of the dreary apartment. But not a living creature was to be seen, not a trace even of the recent presence of any one. The fire on the hearth was dead and white; the sole pallet bed in the corner of the room stripped of its covering; the few fragments of provisions, dry, and mouldy with age; and Guildford could not repress a triumphant smile.</p>
               <p>"I feared you were too sanguine, my friend, and that we were coming on a fool's errand," he said to the bewildered and disappointed Cassidy. "It is evident this place has been long untenanted."</p>
               <p>"Any way, I'd swear I saw the things brought into the wood," said the shepherd lad, who had before sworn to that fact.</p>
               <p>"You forget the deep caverns that are here, Mr. Guildford," said William Adams, coolly. "It is more than likely that both men and goods are concealed beneath. They are quite equal to such strategy, if they had any notice of our approach."</p>
               <p>"Oh, very well, Mr. William Adams—as you please," said Guildford. "Of course you know better than I do what my duty is. "However, I am perfectly ready to pass over any insolence, in the strict performance of my official functions, and therefore we will at once proceed to do what would of course have been my next step to order. I shall go myself into the caverns, and it is quite unnecessary for any one to accompany me, unless he chooses to do so. When it is a matter of duty to venture into danger, I fear nothing."</p>
               <p>"Fear is sometimes a useful check on crime and hardihood," said William, significantly; "but in this case your courage will not be so severely tried, Mr. Guildford. I shall certainly accompany you, and I doubt not my father and Mr. Cassidy will risk it, although your officials of course are at your own command."</p>
               <p>"Oh, of course—of course!" broke in the whole party, in chorus.</p>
               <p>The torches being fairly lighted, and the pistols, and sword-sticks, and shillelahs duly examined, they moved down the steps that led to the caverns. They went slowly and steadily on, when as they arrived at the lowest step, an overpowering and sickening odor, which confirmed Guildford's worst fears, suddenly burst with ominous force on the quailing Justice, who had insisted on leading the van. He reeled, and half fell into the arms of William Adams, who was immediately behind him.</p>
               <p>"The smell," he exclaimed, faintly—"it is dreadful!—poisonous! Our lives will be the sacrifice, if we proceed."</p>
               <p>"It is only the foul air," said William, firmly. "If we only wait a few minutes, now that the door is open, it will pass off. If you feel ill, Mr. Guildford, you had better return to the upper part."</p>
               <p>"No, no, I will do my duty," said the Justice, now driven to courage by the emergency.</p>
               <p>Again he advanced, his trembling limbs scarcely able to support him, his eyes glaring wildly round, in terror every instant of beholding the corpse of the unfortunate Ryan, to the presence of which in the gloomy cave he attributed the sickening odor of the place.</p>
               <p>The steps of the little party sounded strange and unearthly in the deep recess, the torches flashed red light on their white faces as they shrinkingly advanced, and the rattling of the loose earth they disturbed fell with a startling and deep noise on the ground beneath. Was it fancy, or did a low moan fall on their ears? They started, listened attentively, but all was still, and again the torches were carefully flashed in advance, and every eye anxiously peered into the darkness of the gloom beyond. One of the men started, gazed on the ground attentively for a moment, and then recoiled in terror.</p>
               <p>"Stop," he exclaimed, hastily; "for your lives, do not go on, there is powder; a train laid by the robbers, no doubt, to blow us up, the villains! Out with the torches as you value your lives!"</p>
               <p>The effect was electrical; Adams groaned aloud, stumbled over the shaking and terrified O'Neil in his hurry to escape, dropped his torch by way of adding to the danger, though, thanks to William Adams's quick presence of mind, the flambeau did not reach the ground alight. This was the signal for a general retreat. Guildford hurried on, still carrying his torch as a light for his followers; but the others tremblingly blew out the dangerous flambeaux, and stumbling, cursing, pushing, and groaning, at last reached the steps that were to conduct them once more to light and safety.</p>
               <p>"Thank God!" groaned Adams, as he sank exhausted on the rough pallet that was the only resting-place the desolate room afforded. "If you ever catch me in such a devil's hole again, I'm not Adams of Bally Adams."</p>
               <p>"I told you how it would be," returned Guildford, whose consequential bravado had returned with the passing away of the danger. "Depend on it, we had a narrow escape."</p>
               <p>"I agree with you, Mr. Guildford," whispered William in a low tone; "you have had a very narrow escape."</p>
               <p>The Justice affected not to hear him; but the young man saw his lip quiver with the shaft, and he moved away perfectly satisfied that his suspicions were correct. His quick eyes had caught a suspicious, though indistinct object in the dark recess of that gloomy cavern, at the very moment when the general panic took place, and he secretly determined to return to the vaults alone, or with some one on whom he could depend, and search out the mystery of these fearful secrets.</p>
               <p>"It's a hard case, a very hard case, that a man is to be robbed like this, and not get justice," grumbled the shopkeeper, whose regrets for his loss began to eclipse the late terror for his life. "I believe it was a hoax after all about the powder."</p>
               <p>"Go down again then by yourself," said one of the constables, sharply; "only, if you take a light, you'd best wait till we're out of the place, for I've no fancy for being blown up, I can tell you, nor more has the rest of the gentlemen, I suppose."</p>
               <p>The general movement towards the door, and the rapid pace at which most of the party set off from the dangerous proximity to the Rath, confirmed the assertion, and the disappointed shopkeeper was fain to follow in their wake, for few in that neighborhood would have ventured to explore alone the dreaded recesses of the Rath.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLVI.</head>
               <p>GUILDFORD was again safe, or rather, reprieved from any dangerous discovery, and<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6520-00000082"/> as he sat in his sanctum that night, after the expedition to the Rath, he began to flatter himself that his star was indeed in the ascendant, and that the only quarter from which he had to fear the dark cloud that might overshadow it, was one which could yet be guarded against. Mrs. Rivers was certainly a formidable foe—to the weak, yet grasping Guildford an almost equally dreaded friend—and his present thoughts were bent on schemes which might deceive, thwart, or remove her from his path.</p>
               <p>It was an ordinary custom with the busy, plotting master of Garron's Hill, to spend a quiet hour in his own peculiar apartment after the rest of the household had retired, and on this night he felt more than commonly disinclined to go to rest. His brain was too feverishly excited by the events of the day, and his plans were too unsettled and dangerous for him to hope for sleep; so he sat in the luxurious chair recently placed in his study for his especial use, with little consciousness of the tempting softness and ease of its ample cushions; his eyes fixed intently on objects of which he had not the slightest cognizance, and his thoughts troubled, confused, and active, as those of such unprincipled schemers must ever be.</p>
               <p>The midnight hour had long sounded, the fire was nearly out, the lamp flickering in the socket, ere Guildford was roused from his reverie by these long unnoticed warnings, and rose to retire for the night. Perhaps the thoughts in which he had been engaged, or the extreme silence of all around, or that inexplicable feeling of nervous terror which most persons have experienced at some period or other of their lives, made him look furtively and cautiously round as he lighted his chamber lamp from the half-extinguished candelabrum on the table. He opened a drawer, took from it a pair of pocket pistols, examined their loading, then locked and double locked the doors leading to the study, finished the half empty glass of grog, and was turning to leave the room, when his step was arrested by a low, well-known whistle, outside the window. His face flashed for an instant, for even that familiar sound startled his excited nerves at that moment; then, hastily returning the signal by the counter one of a tap on the closed shutter, he proceeded to unlock the door, and admit his nocturnal visitor. It was, as he expected, Bryant, who stood at the door of the conservatory in the thick darkness, cautiously and silently awaiting admission to the sanctum.</p>
               <p>Guildford did not speak till the conservatory door leading to his study, as well as the outer one, was securely locked, and he had ascertained that no midnight watcher was within earshot of the room; then he sat down opposite his imperturbable-looking visitor, with a dark, ominous cloud on his harsh features.</p>
               <p>"Bryant, what is all this?" he asked. "What madness seized you, to rob a shop in Athy?"</p>
               <p>"The same that has made your worship do many queer things," replied the man, with careless insolence—"want of money; besides, my men are getting troublesome, for want of employment."</p>
               <p>As he spoke his dark eyes flashed fiercely on the Justice, who involuntarily blanched before the brigand's look; in truth Bryant was by no means a pleasant companion in a lonely midnight hour. His chin had not been touched by a razor for many a long day; his shirt collar was loosened, displaying the brawny muscular throat and chest; and his powerful hand grasped a cudgel of unusual dimensions, which he wielded as easily as a walking-stick. Moreover, it was tolerably clear to Guildford's experienced eyes, that Bryant was half drunk, or sufficiently excited by liquor to make him insolent, and dangerously regardless of consequences. It was evident that the brigand was in no mood to be trifled with, and the Justice altered his intention of upbraiding his useful agent with treachery in deputing the murder of the unhappy Ryan to other hands; besides, it was clear, from the recent evidence of his own senses, that the deed had been effectually accomplished; and now, when he was contemplating further employment for this unscrupulous assistant in his dark schemes, it was no time to quarrel with him about former transactions.</p>
               <p>"Sit down, Bryant," he said, mildly, "and let us talk over these matters coolly. No doubt you had reason for what you did; but you must remember the terrible risks to which you were exposing me by such a proceeding. Why do these little affairs in this neighborhood, of all others?"</p>
               <p>"Why where else should we do them?" said the man, laughing coarsely. "It is not everywhere that we can reckon on a proper justice of the peace for our little transactions."</p>
               <p>"True," said Guildford; "and you know I stretch every possible point to save you; but there are cases when even a well-disposed magistrate cannot save you without ruin to himself."</p>
               <p>"That is his look-out, not ours," said Bryant.</p>
               <p>"You are in an ill-humor to-night, Bryant," said the Justice, mildly.</p>
               <p>"Take a glass of grog to raise your spirits. Do you not know that the stolen goods were seen actually being taken into the wood?"</p>
               <p>"True," said Bryant, indifferently; "but I fancy no one knew where they were taken out on the opposite side. Ha! ha! ha!" he laughed.</p>
               <p>Guildford shuddered at the coarse laugh, that in the dead stillness might be heard even in the distant sleeping-rooms of the house.</p>
               <p>"Very good," he said, affecting to smile in response; but you must have known that I should be forced to grant a warrant in such a case; and imagine my terror when they insisted on searching the vaults of the Rath! Only suppose, had they found Ryan's body!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, never fear that," said Bryant. "We are not such bunglers as to leave our work above ground to be trodden on like fallen trees."</p>
               <p>"But the stench," said Guildford—"it nearly killed me, to say nothing of the terror of discovery."</p>
               <p>"Then your honor is more squeamish than I should have thought, considering our little transactions together," said the brigand, with a sneer. "But how did you get out of the difficulty?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I frightened them out of their senses by pointing out some loose powder, and suggesting that you had laid a train for our destruction," replied Guildford. "It was a capital <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ruse</foreign>."</p>
               <p>"Capital, indeed!" laughed the brigand; "you would do well in our line of business. But, for the matter of that, the body or ghost of Ryan might perhaps have risen to help you, if they had been inconveniently brave. But tell me how you and Roland got on in London."</p>
               <p>"Oh, excellently well, so far as gain went," replied the Justice; "and, as you know, your son has come out here in a new character. But I have my doubts of him, Bryant—he is not to be trusted. He is either a traitor or a blab."</p>
               <p>"How?" asked Bryant, coolly. "It's not very like him, Mr. Guildford."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I cannot say how or why," replied Guildford; "but I have heard some unpleasant facts, that could only have come from him or you; and I know you are true, my old friend; I can trust you, whoever may turn traitor."</p>
               <p>Bryant gave a sneering smile in acknowledgment of the compliment, and then sat musing for a few moments.</p>
               <p>"I can't tell," he said, "I can't tell; "for it's a long time since Ronald and I had any intercourse. He's in a different line to me, and we quarrel sometimes as to our way of doing business. Besides, I don't tell him all my secrets, and therefore he doesn't understand my reasons; and he's got above being governed where he dont see good cause. Still, I think he would not go so far as to blab, without telling me first what he was after. Who's the person that told you?"</p>
               <p>Guildford hesitated ere he replied, "Oh, some one that must have learnt unpleasant secrets from Old Nick himself, if not from either of you. However, we shall find means of getting out of the scrape, as we have done out of many other, eh?"</p>
               <p>"As you have done, you mean," said Bryant. "But what dirty work have you in hand now?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Bryant, are you getting nice in these affairs?" said Guildford. "Too rich, eh, from the spoils of the old shopkeeper?"</p>
               <p>"I might be rich, perhaps, if I chose to tell what I know in the best market," replied the man; "but I'm an odd fellow, and bide the right time, and know the right man to serve. What's in the wind now, my worthy foster brother?"</p>
               <p>At that moment Guildford would willingly have cast the insolent brigand into the cavern where Ryan lay; but the words of the handsome widow still sounded in his ears, as a timely warning to patience and wisdom for the present.</p>
               <p>"You must help me to remedy the mischief your hopeful son has made, Bryant," he replied. "I am threatened with a worse calamity, if possible, than the loss of Garron's Hill."</p>
               <p>"Whew!" said Bryant, "that must be a pistol shot, or a wife, at the least."</p>
               <p>"Then it is so, and you are privy to it!" exclaimed Guildford, fairly starting from his chair. "Villain! how dare you, with your cut-throat neck in my power, trifle with me in my own house, when a touch of my finger could send you to the place I believe you came from?"</p>
               <p>He touched the small polished pistol at his elbow with a significant gesture, at which Bryant only laughed.</p>
               <p>"You might, or you might not, hit me with that child's toy, there," said he, "but either way, you'd get the worst of it. I should have small scruple, and less difficulty, in twisting your neck, and leaving you hear safe and snug, while I should be miles away before your slaveys opened their sleepy eyes to find their master asleep for ever. Come, come, brother, you know me of old; fair words do more than this empty bullying with James Bryant. What do you want, and what do you offer?—that's the plain matter between us."</p>
               <p>Guildford succumbed as usual under the superior strength, mental and physical, of his confederate.</p>
               <p>"There's sense in that, Bryant," said he; "but you forget yourself at times, and I can't stand insolence, even from a useful friend like you. Well, the truth is as you hinted; it's a wife, and a downright Tartar that I am threatened with."</p>
               <p>"Humph!" said Bryant; "some old hag or other, hard up, I suppose, for a home and a husband."</p>
               <p>"Wrong again," said Guilford; "as fine a woman as I'd wish to see at the head of my table, but a very Xantippe for having her will, and a tongue that would cut a flint, and one that will ruin me if I don't say 'I will' when the parson asks me."</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed the brigand; "you've a pleasant choice, my worthy brother—the noose of matrimony, or that of the hangman's cord. Well, of the two evils<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6520-00000083"/> choose the least; hanging's worse than marrying anyhow."</p>
               <p>"I don't know that," returned Guildford, gloomily; "one ends all troubles, the other begins them."</p>
               <p>"And a never-ending one in your case, since your wife will be master," observed Bryant, with a laugh. "When's the wedding to be, Mr. Justice Guildford? I should like to be there, and drink your health. And by the way, that's one thing that brought me here to-night. I want some of the flimseys—for urgent purposes, you understand."</p>
               <p>"Presently, Bryant, presently," said the Justice; "one thing at a time. "You don't suppose I shall ever run my head into that noose while there are ways and means to stop even women's tongues?"</p>
               <p>"Ha! that's the ticket, is it?" said Bryant; "and, as usual, I'm to do the dirty work, I suppose. Well; I must be paid well if I undertake it. I'd rather remove ten men than one woman."</p>
               <p>"What! are you so soft-hearted, Bryant?" sneered Guildford.</p>
               <p>"Not I," said Bryant; "but they're so cunning, there's no getting at them; they beat the men hollow if once they get wind of anything, and I should say your dame can be no chicken, nor dove either."</p>
               <p>Guildford shook his head in gloomy assent.</p>
               <p>"Well," said Bryant; "there's few things I can't do, and fewer that I won't do for money. But you must pay me well; that's the first thing to consider."</p>
               <p>"Oh! we'll see all about that," said Guildford; "but how's it to be done? that's the question. I've not considered the matter yet, but you must devise some scheme."</p>
               <p>"Humph! well, I dare say it might be managed," said Bryant; "but there's not too much time. Of course, it must be done before she becomes your wife."</p>
               <p>"Of course; suspicion will rest on me, if it were done afterwards," replied. Guildford, thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"Clearly," said Bryant; "well, then, if we can contrive to meet her about a week before the wedding, all would be managed nicely. Suppose now that you were to propose to her a trip to Kilkenny, or some such handy place, and on your return you were to have the ill-luck to fall into bad hands, and to be taken to the cave of Dunmore instead of Garron's Hill, bound hand and foot, and no distinction made between the sweethearts, you see, to prevent jealousies and suspicious? Or, if you don't fancy such a new way of courting, you might make your escape, and raise the country to rescue your bride, who had been violently taken from you, and as you fear, come to grief. What do you think of that, Mr. Justice?"</p>
               <p>"Excellent," replied Guildford; "only I'm afraid people will wonder why you let me escape and murdered the lady."</p>
               <p>"Oh! very well; if you can hit upon a better plan, well and good," said Bryant, "but something must be risked by you as well as ourselves."</p>
               <p>He half rose to go, and Guildford's <choice>
                     <sic>vascillating</sic>
                     <corr>vacillating</corr>
                  </choice> temper was again brought to a decision.</p>
               <p>"Now don't be so hasty, Bryant," said he; "I confess I can think of no better scheme at present. I'll make every preparation; drive out the bride elect every day for the next week or two to avoid suspicion when the trip really comes off, and you must see me again in a week or ten days to make final arrangements. Here's a trifle for the present, and we shan't quarrel about terms when we strike the bargain."</p>
               <p>Guildford took four five-pound notes from his pocket-book, and handed them to his companion, who coolly transferred them to his own pocket without more than a nod of satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"All right then," said he; "I'll be here about ten days hence at the usual time and place, and in the meantime don't forget to be very polite to your future wife, Mr. Guildford, and to Mr. Reginald Saville."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, the brigand disappeared through the window of the conservatory, leaving Guildford disagreeably impressed with the extent of his information, and the unscrupulous exercise of the power it gave him.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Bryant returned to his hiding-place with a thoughtful and slow step, very different from his usual swaggering gait and air. He had a game to play which needed deep and cautious consideration to prevent a false move, that might destroy the work of months and years. He had to guard not only against the comparatively weak and plastic master who was in reality his slave, but against the rival plans and movements of those as well informed of the circumstance, or nearly so, as himself, and whose interests might be opposed to his own. Ronald and Mrs. Rivers were each counter-checking his moves, and it needed a bold and yet cautious generalship to win the victory.</p>
               <p>"I have one trump in the background that they little suspect—one secret that is known only to myself and one other," said he, "and that other has been in the other world years since, so I'm told. Yes, let them strive and triumph; I'll be even with them yet."</p>
               <p>On the following morning Bryant's first step was to assemble his band, who respectfully awaited the directions which such a summons invariably preceded.</p>
               <p>"Hark ye, my men," said he, "we must adjourn for a while; this place is getting too well known, and attracts too many visitors. You can have a holiday for a few days, but this day week we will all assemble in the cave of Dunmore, in Rath Wood. And mind, in the meantime I expect you will all keep out of mischief. I've no objection to your amusing yourselves, or doing a little private business; but if any of you get into trouble, by your folly or avarice, while you're on leave, you need expect no help from me, nor re-admission to the band afterwards. You know me, and I always keep my word."</p>
               <p>"We'll take care," said the men. "When's the tryste, captain?"</p>
               <p>"This day week, in the evening," he replied. "I've got work in store for you, and the cave of Dunmore's the safest and handiest place for it."</p>
               <p>"Good," said Sullivan, the next in command; "that cave covers a multitude of sins, and bodies also."</p>
               <p>"Ay," said Bryant, "but we must not trust to the cave entirely, for there are so many prying fools, who come to see its wonders, its self-formed pillars, its famed market cross, its crystal sides, and its rugged paths, that in whatever nook you may put the body—"</p>
               <p>"Body!—oh, you are there, are you?" said one of the inferior members of the gang.</p>
               <p>"To be sure," said Bryant.</p>
               <p>"And what fellow would you remove now?" said the man.</p>
               <p>"No fellow at all," replied Bryant.</p>
               <p>"What then?—not a woman!" exclaimed Sullivan.</p>
               <p>"A woman!" ejaculated the men one and all.</p>
               <p>"Ay, why should not a woman be removed, if she be a dangerous one—a traitress that might betray us any day, and bring a whole body of honest men in trouble?" said Bryant.</p>
               <p>"Say you so, captain?" observed Sullivan. "Why, that alters the case entirely. But who is she?"</p>
               <p>"Never mind that," replied the chief; "for the present, names, time, and reasons belong to me alone; but I may as well tell you the plan of operations. The dangerous lady in question will probably be with a gentleman in a car. You will stop and seize them both, observing an apparently impartial dealing with both; you will treat them outwardly with the same severity—rob both; be careful not to leave a shilling of money, neither watches, jewels, nor bank notes, nor anything that might be sworn to or identified; but bring all such articles to me for safety, and for decision as to their disposal. The gold and silver shall be yours, and a suitable reward besides. You will take care that the female sees you bind the man fast to one of the pillars in the cavern; but not in sight of the cataract to the right, before you get to the cross. That is for the lady herself. You will throw her headlong into the roaring waters below, regardless of any reluctance she may show to such a deep bed."</p>
               <p>Even the hardened brigands shuddered, and regarded each other with horror-sticken looks.</p>
               <p>"A deep grave, indeed!" said one.</p>
               <p>"A regular mouth-closer," said another.</p>
               <p>"Never mind," observed a third, the most ruffianly villain of the group. "It shall be done, captain; you may rely on us. But won't you tell us who she is?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Bryant, "when the deed is done, I may inform you of the facts of the case, and you will see it is a politic and necessary severity. But, listen; you will be careful to have the car in some convenient place for the gentleman, whose escape you will wink at, though of course, you will not further it. The cords that bind him need not be very strong, nor the knots very tight; and, of course, when you hear the plunge into the water, those that are guarding him will naturally rush forward to see what is going on. When the car is fairly off you will all of you rush from the cavern, separate at once, and one by one make your way to Cork, and join the rest of our troop without delay. There will be a hot pursuit; but you know how to elude it. Leave me to take care of myself, and wait for me at the usual rendezvous in Cork. There will be work enough soon for us to be again in the field, when folks will have enough to do besides avenging private wrongs. Yes, there will be a rising this year or the next, my lads; and it will go hard if honest men like us don't pick up something among the rascally thieves in office."</p>
               <p>A general laugh rewarded his happy idea, which, as Bryant intended, diverted the minds of his men from the horrors of the deed he was concocting, and after making arrangements as to the intervening days till the proposed rendezvous, the gang separated. Bryant repaired to his old quarters in Carlow, and the rest of the party wandered off in different directions, each man to follow his own devices, and do what was good in his own eyes, if not in those of the rulers who are supposed to be a "terror to evil doers."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XLVII.</head>
               <p>TIME is not always to be measured by minutes and hours. There are periods in life when the experience and influence alike on the mind and feelings of a few short days or weeks, is equal to the effect which years of ordinary events and pursuits would produce. And thus it was with Gerard Carlton, in the brief interval that elapsed between the perusal of his mother's letter and the day when he was to join his new regiment at Taunton. It would have been difficult to imagine a more total change in his position and prospects than he had experienced during that short fortnight.</p>
               <p>Lord Hargrave's kindness and gratitude had placed Gerard in the most honorable and inviting career that was open to courage,<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6520-00000084"/> talent, and high feeling, in those days of constant and stirring warfare. Mrs. Carlton's death had made him complete master of his own actions, and of the four thousand pounds which was all she had to bequeath, with the sad legacy of her wrongs and shame, the unfading stain of a dishonored name, the burning disgrace of a father's crime. No wonder that Gerard's whole current of thought and feeling, hopes and fears, motives of actions, and anticipations for the future were changed, as if by the magic transformations of a fairy tale. The impetuous, impressionable, ardent youth, susceptible alike of joy and sorrow, sanguine and eager in every new scheme, sensitive to every passing influence of those around, was changed into a calm, grave, unflinching man, firm in purpose, prepared to encounter the trials and duties which were to make up the remainder of a life to which happiness, love, even friendship must be for ever strangers.</p>
               <p>After the short, sharp conflict of that terrible hour in Lord Hargrave's library, Gerard's first thought was for Mabel. To spare her all that he could of bitterness in the inevitable trial that awaited her; shield her from the blow which had fallen so heavily on himself, was the generous anxiety which for the time swallowed up all other and more selfish considerations. Not even for the exquisite relief of her sympathy, of sharing his terrible secret with one equally affected by it, with himself, would he give that noble girl the lasting anguish of knowing her father's baseness, his perfidy to her own as well as Gerard's mother. After long and anxious consideration he determined to give her the brief outlines of the secrets which his mother's dying words had partially revealed to her in writing, instead of trusting to the trying and uncertain ordeal of an interview. He might not be able to resist her questions, her grief, her prayers, if he exposed himself to their influence. A letter could be guarded, considered, read over before it met her eyes, and no unnecessary detail, no incautious word would risk a revelation, which he was resolved should never willingly pass his lips.</p>
               <p>A letter, tender, loving, and delicate, speaking of a wretched misunderstanding, of a supposed death, of weak and fatal precipitancy, which had entailed a life-long misery on many, was therefore all that reached Mabel of that fearful story of wrong and crime; Gerard bade her forget him, save as a brother, bound to fulfill her slightest wish, to devote his very life to guard her from sorrow or danger, and whose sole object and interest in life would be to fulfill to her the duties and enjoy the privilege of the relationship which had cost so dearly.</p>
               <p>This letter, once written and despatched, Gerard tried to turn his thoughts and energies to the duties and arrangements incident on his entrance into his new profession. Fortunately, perhaps, for him, Adeline Rivers had already left town, and he was thus debarred the softening indulgence of her sympathy, and of reposing in her the confidence which he might have been tempted to bestow. And there was so much to be done in the short interval that elapsed between his being gazetted and joining his regiment at Taunton, that his thoughts were somewhat diverted from his own sorrows. He could scarcely have decided, even in his own secret thoughts, whether he was pained or gratified at the destination to which he was at first ordered. He believed that he could trust both himself and Mabel to act in all respects with self-control and fortitude under this trying circumstance; and it would be a sad gratification to be near to, to see, to watch over his sister, his beautiful, beloved sister. Of his father he dared not trust himself even to think, but he firmly resolved to avoid every opportunity of meeting him, lest he might be tempted to forget that he was Mabel's sole surviving parent, and that his own mother's dying commands had enjoined forbearance and filial respect for the relationship, if not for the man whom it was his misfortune to call father.</p>
               <p>There was one other source of mortification and danger which might await him, and on which Gerard was too much absorbed by other considerations to check. Frederick Grenville was then with his regiment at Taunton, the cause of many of his past misfortunes, the suspected instigator of the attack on Lord Hargrave's life. They would of course meet as acquaintances, and so long as Grenville preserved the outward form of courtesy towards him, they might continue a conventional, indifferent intercourse for the sake of the noble uncle of whom Frederick was so unworthy. But all intimacy, all friendship, was at an end forever; and he could scarcely suppose that there would be any attempt to renew it. But it was no time for dwelling on such minor evils, and Gerard soon dismissed Grenville and his possible line of conduct from his mind, little dreaming its future influence on his whole life.</p>
               <p>All was at last ready for Gerard's departure from the metropolis, which had been the scene of his greatest troubles, his most crushing degradations, and of a few feverish, brief hours of excitement and pleasure. In his farewell interview Lord Hargrave presented him with a splendid watch and massive chain of peculiar design, as a token of his lasting gratitude for the service rendered him on <choice>
                     <sic>Hampsted</sic>
                     <corr>Hampstead</corr>
                  </choice> Heath.</p>
               <p>"It is an heirloom, Carlton," he said; "bequeathed to me by my father, and destined for my son, had I been blest with one. I bestow it on you as the most expressive and valuable proof I can give of my feelings towards you, not as a return for your bravery, for which I am and ever shall be your debtor. A life can only be repaid by a life; but the welfare of your future career shall be my care so far as is in my power. God bless you, my boy, and remember, that a man's true character is best proved by adversity."</p>
               <p>Gerard clasped the extended hand as if in paternal kindness and blessing, and inwardly vowed not to forfeit that noble-hearted man's estimation of his character. He knew not yet the trials that would test to the very utmost his manly self-control.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>It was the second evening after Gerard's arrival at Taunton. He had gone through the usual formalities with the adjutant, made the first troublesome arrangements incidental on first joining a regiment, and had been introduced to more than one of his brother officers, though he had not appeared at the first day's mess. But, as yet, Frederick Grenville had not, by accident or otherwise, crossed his path, nor had his name been mentioned by the adjutant, or any of the officers by whom he had been courteously and even cordially received. Gerard half hoped that he might have been ordered to some other station, or even exchanged into an other regiment, but carefully avoided asking questions that might lead to embarrassing explanations.</p>
               <p>The dinner on this second day of his camp life was animated and excitingly novel to the young officer. Light and brilliant repartee, polished jests, stirring tales of military life went round without one flagging pause of dullness or constraint, and Gerard scarcely felt himself a stranger among the cordial and genial companions by whom he was surrounded. And still no Grenville was there to damp and fetter his case and freedom of intercourse with his new acquaintances by embarrassing though familiar recollections, or cold haughtiness and constraint. Gerard's impression was strengthened as to the absence of the young man from this detachment of the regiment, and he was conscious of a relief to his mind that, for the moment, almost raised his spirits to something like genuine cheerfulness. The delusion was, however, soon dispelled.</p>
               <p>"Farquhar," exclaimed one of the younger officers to a captain near him, "where is Grenville hiding himself? I have not seen him these two days."</p>
               <p>"Oh! he is at Highfield Grange, as usual," was the reply. "He escorted the fair lady of his affections to the review yesterday, and I suppose he is dining there this evening."</p>
               <p>"That cannot be," said Major Williamson, "for I saw them all go into the 'Lamb' not an hour before mess."</p>
               <p>"Very likely they are going to the concert at the Assembly Rooms," said Captain Farquhar. "I vote we adjourn there. It's quite a charity to patronise that pretty little Mademoiselle Sansi; they say she supports a whole host of relations by her singing."</p>
               <p>"Farquhar is wonderfully sympathetic when Miss May is likely to share his disinterested generosity," observed Major Williamson, laughing. "However, I second his motion, having myself no particular objection either to fine voices or pretty faces. Will you join us, Carlton?"</p>
               <p>Gerard hesitated for a moment; but the temptation of seeing, perhaps speaking to Mabel, and the difficulty of finding an excuse for a refusal, overcame his objection to meeting Grenville, or seeing his dreaded father. Perhaps there was a fascination in the very idea of beholding the parent whom he had never yet seen, the beloved of his mother's youth, the curse of her after days.</p>
               <p>"With all my heart," he replied. "Will it be tolerably good?"</p>
               <p>"Capital, for a country town," was the reply. "Good rooms, a fair orchestra, a pretty little syren of a prima donna, and the handsomest girl in England in the stalls. Won't that satisfy you?"</p>
               <p>Gerard laughed constrainedly, and in a few minutes the party were on their way to the Assembly Rooms.</p>
               <p>The encomiums were fully justified by the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tout ensemble</foreign>. A remarkably spacious and well-lighted concert-room, fitted up as a miniature theatre, brilliantly filled with a gaily dressed audience, and with the notes of an inspiriting overture sounding through the apartment, given with precision and startling effect, was a scene both animated and dazzling, after the gloom and silence of the quiet streets.</p>
               <p>The seats were already nearly filled—the officers were obliged to separate, in order to find places; and Gerard and Captain Williamson made their way to two empty stalls, nearly at the back of the three front rows before the orchestra. Gerard's eyes glanced sharply, rapidly round. Once—twice, they ran over the brilliant circle of pretty, well-dressed girls, and comely, dignified matrons before he could find the object of his search.</p>
               <p>"She is there," whispered Williamson, "just under that box, half concealed by the thick curtain, as if to tantalise her hundred admirers in the room. Look, there's a profile for you!"</p>
               <p>Gerard did look, not to criticise the features he knew by heart, but to gratify his loving, eager eyes by a glance at the dear face. One glance was enough—it was Mabel, looking just as a lover's jealous heart would have wished, pale, calm, and self possessed, with no trace of bodily illness in her beautiful face, yet with the quiet, subdued look of pensive melancholy that spoke of mental suffering that had been conquered and crushed down, till the acute anguish wa deadened into resignation and peace.</p>
               <p>How Gerard's heart yearned in deep tenderness, in inexpressible admiration as he<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6520-00000085"/> looked on Mabel, and read in her well-known face the history of her noble, unselfish struggles, the triumph of high principle and duty, the undying, unconquerable tenderness and love of her woman's heart through all! He told himself that to call that splendid, heroic creature sister, was a proud privilege; but yet the past, the present, the future, seemed a confused chaos of misery and sin and danger, to all connected with that wretched drama in which their parents had played so terrible a part.</p>
               <p>Mabel turned to speak to the gentleman immediately behind her, who had bent forward to address her, as Gerard gazed with involuntary fixedness on her, and his eyes turned quickly from her face to that of his father. He felt it; there could be no doubt as to the identity of that handsome, middle-aged man, bending fondly over Mabel's chair. Those finely-cut features, the cynical expression, the peculiar glitter of the bright, restless eye, answered too well to the description of the man whose attractions had won his mother's heart, and whose selfish baseness had ruined her fame and happiness. It was a strange thrill that ran through his veins, as he saw for the first time, this unknown parent, who had exercised such a fearful influence over his own destiny and peace, and who looked so smilingly unconscious, so smoothly bland and cheerful in that brilliant scene. Then came the wretched, unnatural loathing of the man whose blood ran in his veins, and who had forced him, by a refinement of cruelty, to violate the command of the Great Parent of the universe, "Honor thy father."</p>
               <p>Gerard felt that had he seen Lionel Beaumont as an entirely unknown stranger he would have distrusted and shrunk from him as from a serpent. And yet it was his father!</p>
               <p>As Gerard still bent his fascinated gaze on Mr. Beaumont, he saw him speaking a few hurried words to a gentleman who sat in a dark corner of the box, rise, and leave his seat, which the person thus addressed at once took.</p>
               <p>It was Frederick Grenville to whom Mabel was thus consigned; and Gerard's blood boiled at the lover-like air with which the trust was received, and the evident assumption of rightful guardianship which the young man showed in look and gesture.</p>
               <p>"That's a case, evidently," said a young officer who sat near Gerard to the lady under his own care. "Pretty near the crisis, I should think, to judge from the old fellow's retirement from the scene. Soon <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vice</foreign> parent, resigned—eh, Constance?"</p>
               <p>Mabel perhaps noticed the glances her present position attracted—perhaps felt the awkwardness of the chaperonage to which she was thus unceremoniously left, or was weary of the whole affair. At all events, she rose before the first act was over and prepared to leave, whilst Grenville, with lover-like ease, placed her cloak on her shoulders, and led her from the box.</p>
               <p>Gerard could resist no longer. He rushed from the room—he scarcely knew for what purpose, save a vague idea that he would ascertain something of the relations between them, where he was about to take her, catch one more look, hear the sound of her voice, decide on her feelings towards his rival—"rival," say we?—no, not so, only a worthless pretender to the hand of his precious, peerless sister.</p>
               <p>Rapid as his own steps, these thoughts rushed through Gerard's mind as he hastily traversed the long room and the corridor that led to the entrance of the building. Mabel was standing in the inner lobby, alone. Grenville had left her for a moment to call the carriage, and for a brief instant Gerard could approach her unobserved, unwatched.</p>
               <p>"Mabel!" he whispered.</p>
               <p>The young girl started, turned, with a face in which the blood glowed like a carnation.</p>
               <p>"Gerard—my brother!" she said.</p>
               <p>"Dearest, forgive me!" said Gerard; "but I longed to hear from your lips one word of kindness, of forgiveness for the pain I have given you; the—"</p>
               <p>"Say, rather of gratitude for what you have spared me, Gerard," she replied. "Let us thank Heaven, my brother, that we have to mourn the errors of others, not our own. We have a right to love each other now."</p>
               <p>"Miss May, the carriage waits," said a voice, hoarse with passion. "This person I see has presumed to take advantage of your being left alone for a moment. I am sorry you have been exposed to such an insult."</p>
               <p>"Insult" repeated Gerard, fiercely, his face flaming like scarlet. "Captain Grenville, retract that expression in this lady's presence, or take the consequences."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to have too old-fashioned a regard for truth, Ensign Carlton," said Grenville, laughing scornfully. "I tell you that you are no fit person to address a lady of rank and pretension like Miss May; and in her father's name, I desire you to retire this instant."</p>
               <p>"You are a disgrace to the name you bear and the uniform you wear, Frederick Grenville," exclaimed Carlton, haughtily; "I know you now—know far more than you imagine of all your infamous design, not only on myself, but—"</p>
               <p>"Miss May, this is no scene for you; let me conduct you to your carriage," said Grenville, coolly turning to Mabel. "This person knows perfectly well his own degraded position, and is beneath my resentment or your notice."</p>
               <p>Mabel did not move, nor accept the hand he held out to lead her to the door. Her pallid, terrified face was turned appealingly to Gerard's but he was too deeply indignant to yield even to her mute, imploring look. He stood glaring unflinchingly on Grenville's paling face.</p>
               <p>"Mabel, Mabel!" sounded impatiently from the door. It was Lionel Beaumont's voice.</p>
               <p>"I must go," said Mabel, breathlessly; "Gerard, for my sake—"</p>
               <p>The sound of footsteps from the inner building interrupted her breathless appeal, and hurried her flight. She saw as she darted, alone and unaided, down the few broad steps to the carriage, that some of the other officers of the regiment were leaving the concert-room, and trusting to their presence to prevent further mischief, she joined her impatient father, who was fretting and chafing at the brief delay. She would have given half her fortune for another five minutes' grace, to prevent the horrors of a quarrel between the two fiery spirits she had left, but she knew her father too well to attempt one word of entreaty, or share with him her terrors.</p>
               <p>It was a wretched, chilling drive home. Mabel shivered with apprehension as she crouched back into a corner of the carriage; she bit her lips to restrain the moans that rose to them, and her small hand was clenched till the nails chafed the thin, soft skin.</p>
               <p>When they arrived at the hotel where they were to pass the night, Mabel hastily murmured a brief "Good night!" and ran up to her room before Mr. Beaumont could either expostulate or reprove her disregard of his selfish regulations as to her attendance on himself.</p>
               <p>Grenville and Gerard had stood glaring on each other after her swift flight, with the deep anger and hate that only deadly injuries and bitter jealousies can produce; but neither spoke. The deep and lasting resentment and contempt of one, the bitter and determined enmity of the other, were too rooted and intense for words.</p>
               <p>"Hallo! what's all this?—a rehearsal!" shouted young Farquhar. "Why, you'd make fortunes on the stage by such looks and attitudes. But, what's up? I did not know you were acquainted. There must be some mistake, to get up such a scene at five minutes' notice."</p>
               <p>"No mistake, Farquhar," said Grenville, "unless it is on my foolishly good-natured uncle's part to put a Custom House thief into His Majesty's service."</p>
               <p>Gerard could bear no more. All prudence, all self-control forsook him at the insult. He sprang forward, and gave Grenville a severe blow in the face.</p>
               <p>"Coward, take that!" he exclaimed. "I would forfeit life itself, rather than sink to the depths of crime in which you are steeped. I am ready to give you every satisfaction you demand, though you are beneath an honorable man's sword."</p>
               <p>Grenville stood for a moment stunned and flushed by the sudden blow, then an exulting smile played round his cynical mouth, as he turned to Farquhar and Williamson, who stood in petrified astonishment at the scene.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," said he, "you are witnesses that Ensign Carlton has presumed to strike his superior officer. I must trouble one of you to call Colonel Vaughan, while the other kindly remains with me to prevent his escape."</p>
               <p>The young men hesitated. Grenville was no great favorite in the regiment, and there was something in the face and tone of the indignant young ensign that gave them an impression of his candor and truth.</p>
               <p>Grenville made an impatient movement, and his lips parted with no very placable expression, which, luckily for the further peace of the group, was arrested by the approach of Colonel Vaughan himself, who, while in the concert room, had received some intimation of what was going on.</p>
               <p>A few words explained the gross violation of military discipline, and of course there was no alternative as to the measures to be taken. Gerard was ordered under immediate arrest, deprived of his sword, and, confined to the strong room of the barracks till a court-martial could be held on his aggravated offence.</p>
               <p>"I need scarcely point out to you the extreme impropriety of your conduct, Mr. Carlton," was the colonel's remark, as he issued the order. "As an officer and a gentleman it is equally disgraceful to you; and for your own interest's sake I should hardly have imagined you would have selected the nephew of your kind patron as the object of such an outrage."</p>
               <p>Gerard bowed in silence to the reprimand, without even condescending to vindicate himself by the provocation he had received. He knew perfectly well, that whatever Grenville's conduct might have been, the strict unswerving rules of the service would punish mercilessly such an attack on a superior officer, without recognising the slightest palliation of the offence. He was heart stricken, crushed by long and continued misfortunes, till all but the passive courage and fortitude, which never wholly deserts a brave man, was dormant within him. Why struggle longer with an adverse fate, a relentless and powerful persecutor, whose hatred pursued him to the very death, though its real motive was yet unknown to him?</p>
               <p>There are keener pangs than those of death itself to a noble and generous spirit, and Gerard's was stung to the quick by the degrading imputations he had now incurred. The story of his past life would be dragged to light; his sole friend and patron would turn from him in disgust at the ingratitude his conduct would apparently display; and Mabel, she might pity—even weep for his sad fate; but even then she might feel almost<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6520-00000086"/> a relief at the final termination of a connection that had brought to her little besides misery, at the death of a brother, whose very existence was a tacit disgrace to herself and her only parent.</p>
               <p>"Yes," he murmured to himself, as he sat in the gloomy solitude of that dreary room, reminded every moment of his position by the heavy tramp of the guards outside his door; "better to leave a world in which I have no rightful place, where I bring shame and misery on the few who feel kindly towards me, and where I shall be missed by none, save the noble-hearted girl whose path I have crossed like an evil genius. And perhaps Adeline and Fanny—poor Fanny—may give a passing tear to one who was at least too true and honorable to affect, even for his own interests and safety, a regard he could not feel."</p>
               <p>Happily for the young man's fevered brain, the softening thoughts of the gentle and loving girls who had proved themselves so disinterested alike in their love and their friendship for him, brought tears to his eyes. The world was indeed dark and cheerless; life had been one long scene of trial and struggle; but there were true, unselfish, and warm-hearted beings who would still sympathise with him.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The court-martial on the newly-made ensign was hurried on with suspicious rapidity. Even the least disinterested of the fellow-officers of Frederick Grenville whispered that he must have interfered with unbecoming animus in the matter, and that if Carlton's and his own position in society had been reversed, there would probably have been less haste and more deliberation in the whole proceedings. But Gerard heeded little these minor ingredients in his deep and bitter cup of sorrow. He had refused all offers of communication with his friends, or of assistance in arranging his defence, and, to all outward seeming, appeared perfectly prepared for the worst that could befall him. Why, indeed, should he degrade himself, or pain others uselessly? Lord Hargrave was the only friend to whom he could have applied with the slightest shadow of hope, and he scorned to repay the kindness of his patron by exposing the baseness of his nearest relative and heir. Mabel would have been compromised by any attempt of his to write from his gloomy confinement; and Adeline Rivers was far away, and would learn the truth all too soon for her kindly, sympathising heart; and thus the young man determined to bear his burden alone and unaided by friendly help or kindly sympathy, alone, save with the faith and hope in his Maker which his very loneliness and desolation had brought.</p>
               <p>Gerard Carlton the prisoner, the all but condemned, the victim of a haughty and selfish enemy, was a far nobler being than the light-hearted, thoughtless Dublin student, the idolised son of a loving mother, or the gay and brilliant <foreign xml:lang="FRA">habitué</foreign> of the London <foreign xml:lang="FRA">salons</foreign>. Adversity was doing its work, though with a rough and unsparing hand, on the unfortunate young man.</p>
               <p>The day arrived when Carlton's fate was to be decided. The officers who composed the board had assembled, the preliminaries had been gone through, the prisoner introduced to the room, and the witnesses called who were to prove the offence.</p>
               <p>Gerard's countenance and demeanor could scarcely fail to prepossess the judges, and yet more the bystanders, in his favor, though the gravity of the offence of which he stood charged was sufficient to place him under the severest ban in the eyes of the worthy martinets who composed the tribunal. Yet there was no mistaking that open, intellectual brow, the clear, thoughtful eyes, the pale check, the sad but calm mouth. There was courage, resignation, but neither bravado nor indifference in those noble features. But whatever the aspect of the criminal charged with so grave an offence, the facts were, alas! undeniable, and proved by impartial witnesses, as well as the statement of the accused himself. The prisoner had inflicted on his superior officer the greatest insult that a man could offer, and the penalty was clear and fixed by all military rules and discipline.</p>
               <p>The evidence was concluded; the accuser had given his statement with well-feigned reluctance and most cleverly-veiled spite against the prisoner, and it was evident that his temperate and calm account of the affair told with tenfold force against the accused.</p>
               <p>"It is doubly painful to me," he said in conclusion, "to be compelled to bear this testimony against a gentleman under my uncle, Lord Hargrave's patronage; and I shall rejoice if you, gentlemen, see fit to take a lenient view of his conduct towards me, or, I should rather say, his disrespect to His Majesty's uniform."</p>
               <p>Then came the evidence of Captain Farquhar and Major Williamson, which was brief, but terribly decisive.</p>
               <p>A slight pause ensued; after which Gerard was asked for his defence, or rather what he had to say in exculpation of his conduct to Captain Grenville.</p>
               <p>Gerard was very pale as he rose to address the tribunal on which his fate depended, but his eyes were clear and unclouded, and his voice firm and steady.</p>
               <p>"I have but little to say," he began. "It would ill become me to trouble you, gentlemen, with useless and unnecessary recriminations, or charges which relate to private and personal matters between Captain Grenville and myself. I would only say, in justice to myself, that the provocation I received was of a nature which I believe no man of honor could have borne unmoved, and that it was but the continuation of a series of injuries and insults that have worked the final ruin of my prospects; and it rests with your justice and clemency to decide whether my life will not be the sacrifice of his unsparing hatred. I freely and frankly confess the entire truth of the facts alleged against me, and which have been related with forbearance and strict accuracy; and I most respectfully throw myself on the indulgence and the strict justice of this honorable tribunal."</p>
               <p>The judges regarded each other with grave and ominous faces as the young man concluded, and then the president ordered the prisoner to be conducted to another room, and the apartment to be cleared.</p>
               <p>A quarter of an hour elapsed;—fifteen minutes that seemed lengthened into hours, save that the slow regular tick of the large heavy clock on the wall, proved that time still pursued its regular, even pace. Gerard's own heart beat slowly and heavily. He was prepared for the worst—at least he thought so; still life is sweet, even to the old and heavily tried; but Gerard was only twenty-two, and youth is so susceptible of hope and light, and trust, even when all looks darkest and most hopeless, that it seems hard to die—die a violent and sudden death—condemned to the heaviest and final punishment for an act which was almost inevitable under such insults and provocation. It was a prospect to move the stoutest heart, and agitate the most sluggish and cold pulse that ever beat in human form.</p>
               <p>The door opened; the Court had decided on their judgment. The prisoner and those more immediately concerned, and then the rest of the spectators, were re-conducted to the chamber. There was little need for words. The faces of the officers who composed that small but powerful court, were grave, and even sad as they looked on the young and interesting prisoner on whose fate they had decided. The verdict was however soon spoken in calm and impressive tones, that added solemnity and force to its terrible purport.</p>
               <p>"DEATH."</p>
               <p>In one word that was the sentence, and its only alleviation was that it was to be inflicted on a soldier by soldiers, and that the bullet, and not the degrading cord and hangman's touch, was to be the instrument by which it was to be carried out.</p>
               <p>There was a thrill through the court as it was pronounced, visible, audible, though quickly suppressed; and the involuntary but momentary shudder that ran through the prisoner's frame was perhaps the slightest proof of emotion given by any one in the court.</p>
               <p>Gerard's eyes turned full on Grenville as that first irresistible shock passed away, and the eyes of the triumphant accuser lowered before those of the helpless and doomed victim of his persecution. Was it that some accusing voice whispered "Retribution!" to that hardened conscience—that a strange feeling of terror or remorse mingled in that hour of apparent triumph and safety?</p>
               <p>Gerard Carlton was conducted from the Court, to be removed once more to the gloomy apartment that was to be his abode for the few brief days that remained to him, and then followed slowly and thoughtfully the spectators of the sad scene just concluded.</p>
               <p>Grenville on some pretext had lingered behind his brother officers, and indeed, after the last of the little crowd had passed from the room, he still remained, gloomy and abstracted near the spot where Gerard had so lately stood to hear his doom. Then he glanced quickly round, as he fancied he heard a step approach and a voice in hollow whispers sounded in his ear, "Hast thou killed, and taken possession?"</p>
               <p>The words were distinct, though hoarse and low; but as he turned, not a person was visible but a man who appeared to belong to the place, and who was busying himself in restoring the room to its usual order.</p>
               <p>Grenville hesitated for a moment whether to question the man as to the mysterious voice; he feared to betray too much personal interest in the words which the man must surely have overheard. Then he asked carelessly, "who went out just now?"</p>
               <p>"No one, captain," replied the man, with a low bow, that would scarcely have disgraced a levée and resuming his employment with most stolid indifference.</p>
               <p>"I am a fool," muttered Grenville, as he turned angrily from the room. "It's high time this state of things was over, when I—Frederick Grenville—begin to hear voices and see likenesses. I could have sworn I had seen that man's face before, though I cannot tell where."</p>
               <p>He walked thoughtfully on, his mind still running on the strange delusion, and striving to remember where the person whom that man resembled could have come across him. He ransacked his memory in vain for some minutes; then the truth flashed suddenly on him, and he decided, with some vague uneasiness at the idea that he was wonderfully like the man who had acted as servant to Reginald Saville, otherwise Ronald of the Rath, during his residence in London. Of course, the likeness was a capricious accident; but the more Grenville dwelt on it, the stronger grew the conviction of its existence; and the circumstance, trifling as it was, produced a vague alarm and distrust in his guilty mind, that was some slight beginning of the retribution that inevitably awaits the wicked, even in this fitful and uncertain world.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLVIII.</head>
               <p>THE drawing-room at Garron's Hill was even more completely transformed than any other apartment in the house since the return of its master. Not only had the furniture and decorations been renovated, but female taste had evidently reigned in its arrangement; female materials for occupation and amusement were scattered about the room, and gave an air of elegance and comfort, in which bachelor apartments are invariably wanting. Books, embroidery, drawing materials, were to be seen on the tables; a harp stood in one corner of the room, with a pile of music near it; and (which was the crowning and completing attraction of the room) two beautiful girls were sitting near the wood fire, that even then was welcome in that moist climate. They held in their hands some apology for work, but their fingers were far more idle than strict disciplinarians would have approved, and the eyes and tongues of both were far otherwise occupied than the graceful trifles they were supposed to be forming.</p>
               <p>"Norah," said the sweet ringing voice, which so peculiarly distinguished Adeline Rivers, "I am wondering at the strange confidence and affection you have won from me so rapidly. It seems years, rather than weeks, that we have known each other. Why is this? I am no sentimental girl to make friendships so quickly."</p>
               <p>"I cannot explain it," said Norah, smilingly, "except in the very simple way that we are thrown together in this complete seclusion, and that we happen to have one interest in common. Poor Gerard! I must always love him as a brother, though he did not choose to become one."</p>
               <p>"Where was the fault?" asked Adeline, quickly. "Did he deceive your sister?"</p>
               <p>"Alas, no," replied Norah; "poor darling Fanny was only too easily won by his noble qualities and brotherly kindness to us both. Gerard was, as I believe, as unconscious as he was undesirous of the feelings he excited; yet it is very bitter to think that my dear sister's life may fall a sacrifice to his mistaken tenderness."</p>
               <p>"If it were otherwise, there would be more hope for her," said Adeline, abruptly; "she would soon learn to hate him, if he had betrayed her."</p>
               <p>"Never," said Norah. "I might; but Fanny is gentler and softer than either you or I, Adeline. But these affairs seemed doomed to disappointment in our family. William's first and only love affair ended in a blank: he proposed to Mabel May, and was of course refused."</p>
               <p>"Which may perhaps be attributed to the same cause as your sister's unhappy disappointment," said Adeline, drily. "However, he will be avenged, I imagine; as Miss May is, they say, engaged to be married to an earl's nephew and heir—a brilliant match of course, worthy of the object of so many aspirations."</p>
               <p>Adeline spoke bitterly—so bitterly that Norah looked quietly at her before the pained, scornful look had time to vanish from her features."</p>
               <p>"I do not understand you, Adeline," said Norah. "William can scarcely be entitled to 'revenge,' because Mabel could not like him; and a brilliant match would hardly bring it if he were capable of such baseness."</p>
               <p>Adeline started as if a sudden pain darted through her.</p>
               <p>"Norah," she said, "you can hardly understand me; you have been brought up so differently. Your feelings and passions have been softened and controlled; you have a father and sister and brothers to love, to live for. I have nothing now but justice to desire, and then I care not for life."</p>
               <p>"Dearest Adeline, your mother," said Norah; "surely—"</p>
               <p>"I have no mother," burst as if irrepressibly from Adeline's pale lips. "Norah, if I dared but tell you all—if I could but trust you fully, entirely—it might soften the pain at my heart, which I try to crush and smother, but which is wearing away my very life."</p>
               <p>"Adeline, dear Adeline," exclaimed Norah, drawing the bowed head of the proud, brilliant girl to her bosom. "If sympathy and secresy can be of any avail, I pledge myself to keep sacred, even from my nearest and dearest friends, any confidence you may repose in me. Do you believe me?"</p>
               <p>Adeline looked up in the clear bright eyes of the Irish girl; there was truth, sympathy, intelligence in the pretty sweet face, which lent weight and certainty to the assurance she gave.</p>
               <p>"Norah," she said, after a pause, "I must trust you; it seems a necessity to me this day to unburden my heart to some human being who will not blame me harshly where I have erred, and who may perhaps soften my bitter feelings by her own gentler counsels and pity. And yet it is a fearful risk; for persons and deeds must be mentioned that you may feel sorely tempted to reveal—may feel it right to do so."</p>
               <p>Norah hesitated. It was a solemn pledge to take in such circumstances; but she considered that she might possibly avert evil, and most assuredly she could not aggravate it, by her knowledge of the truth.</p>
               <p>"Adeline," she said, quietly, "you may trust me. I will not betray your confidence under any temptation."</p>
               <p>There was simple truth in the promise, more impressive than any asseverations, and Adeline knew it.</p>
               <p>"So be it," she said. "There is time for my tale, as Mr. Guildford and my mother are driving out to call on your father; and your brother and Mr. Saville will not return till dinner-time. I will not, for my own sake as well as yours, be long in the story I have to tell.</p>
               <p>She drew her chair yet more under the shade of the large, carved chimney-piece, as if the shiver that ran through her frame could be cured by the warmth of the blazing log, and Norah crouched down beside her that the low-toned words might not be lost.</p>
               <p>"I told you just now," began Adeline, "that I had no mother. That truth has been the curse of my life, Norah. I remember my mother, baby that I must have been, when I was taken from her. She was beautiful and gentle-voiced, and I can tell now, sad and suffering. I can recall many, many times when her tears fell on my face, as I nestled up to her, and then she would hastily put me down, as if I had hurt her, and a look that I knew even then was not of love would pass over her face, and for an instant she would turn away from me with a shiver. But, before I had time to indulge the tears that would spring to my childish eyes at the sudden repulse, she would catch me up again, and smother me with caresses, and murmur, 'Forgive me, my child; forgive your unhappy mother. Oh, that I should shrink from my own precious darling with such sinful repugnance!'</p>
               <p>"I must have been far older than my years, Norah, for these words seemed to fix on my infant brain with a confused sense of something that was wrong, and hateful in my innocent little self, and I would steal away to a corner and cry silently, as I thought of my mother's apparent dislike to me.</p>
               <p>"All this was soon ended, though I can hardly tell you how old I was, nor in what manner it was done; it is like a confused dream; but it ended in a sad reality. I was away from my pretty, sad, but dearly-loved mother, in a strange house, with high walls round the little garden, and dull, painted windows in the front, so that I could see nothing, hear nothing, but my own childish voice, and that of the woman who took charge of me. I should know that place again, Norah; ay, and the woman too, though it cannot have been for many weeks that I remained in the gloomy prison. I was continually told that I should go back to my home and my mother if I was good and quiet. And I mastered my grief even then, and tried to seem quiet and patient, till I got weary of promises so often broken.</p>
               <p>"At last I was told that I was going to my home, and my long disused hat and walking dress were put on, and a carriage drove up to the door of the lonely house, and I was lifted into the arms of a stern-looking man, who sat alone in the carriage. For a moment he placed me on his knee, and bent down to kiss me; but the next instant he groaned aloud, and hastily placed me in the furthest corner of the carriage.</p>
               <p>"'No, no, no," he said, in a deep, stern voice, 'not again. I will not be fooled even by that innocent baby face. There is deceit, vice, in woman's very blood, even in those infant veins. Child, do you love your mother?"</p>
               <p>"'Yes, yes, dearly,' I lisped. 'Please take me to her.'</p>
               <p>"'Never!' he said, in hoarse, troubled tones—'never! From this moment you have neither father nor mother. Unfortunate that you are, to have seen the light! It will be well for you, even now, if your days are as brief as mine will be. Child, God help thee!—I cannot say, God bless thee!'</p>
               <p>"I crouched up in my corner, too completely awed and terrified to cry; and the stern, gloomy face was bowed on the clasped hands, and the man shook as I had seen my mother shiver in her paroxysms of grief. I hid my own face, peeping now and then at the strange man, of whom I felt half frightened, and half wished to kiss him, and make him happy again in my baby notions."</p>
               <p>"The drive was a long one; but after the first outburst, my companion was quiet and stern, and hardly spoke, except when he gave me some cakes to eat, and got me a little milk at a place where we stopped. At last I fell asleep till the carriage stopped, and I was lifted out, only half awake even now, and carried into a gay-looking, cheerful drawing-room, where, Norah, I first saw Mrs. Rivers."</p>
               <p>"Then she is—" said Norah, starting.</p>
               <p>"A stranger to me by blood, so far as I know," said Adeline. "But have patience, Norah; this part of my story is soon at an end. She is handsome even now—twenty years ago she was yet more so, and she had a softer, more feminine look, though I never, even at that infant age, trusted her caressing way and plausible manner. I crept quietly to a corner of the sofa where she sat, and crouched under the thick hangings of a curtain, while the man who brought me stood stern and gloomy on the rug, speaking in a low, hoarse tone to Mrs. Rivers.</p>
               <p>"'I have brought her, madam,' he said, 'on the terms we arranged, and which must be strictly enforced; or I shall at once forfeit all the conditions on my side of the agreement. You understand me?'</p>
               <p>"'Certainly,' said the lady, in a calm, soft voice, which contrasted strangely with the harsh tones that had before met my terrified ears. 'You stipulate for her entire adoption by me, so long as the sum agreed on is paid?'</p>
               <p>"'I do,' he replied; 'but that is not all. Remember, she is never to know her real name, never learn the circumstances under which she is placed with you. Bring her up as your own daughter, and never under any circumstances let me hear of her more.'</p>
               <p>"'In case of her illness—death, what then?" said Mrs. Rivers.</p>
               <p>"'She is dead to me, to all her relatives, now; I make no exceptions, though such a<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6520-00000088"/> blessing as her early death can hardly be hoped for,' he replied bitterly. 'But I have no more to say, save one last stipulation. The income I give you for her is to cease at her death, or at her marriage. Not one six-pence shall she have to tempt an unlucky man to risk happiness and honor, by taking her for a wife. Do you agree to this, madam?' he added fiercely, as she hesitated in her reply.</p>
               <p>"'Of course,' said Mrs. Rivers; 'only—but—of course you have a perfect right to control her destiny; I shall obey all your directions, and only hope that you may see fit to alter your views as time goes on.'</p>
               <p>"'Never,' he said sternly. 'Time is too short for me to change. And now, madam, I wish you good-by.'</p>
               <p>"'Will you not say farewell to the little one?' she said.</p>
               <p>He hesitated. I stole from beneath the curtain, just into view; something made me anxious to have one look from those stern eyes, one word from his lips before he left for ever. He stood for a moment gazing on me then suddenly snatched me up in his arms, kissed me with almost convulsive passion, then placed me on the sofa by Mrs. Rivers, and left the room.</p>
               <p>"Norah, I have dwelt on this scene, because it has influenced my whole character, my whole life. It made me reckless, hard, and indifferent. I knew that Mrs. Rivers was bought to be kind to and pretend to love me. I despised every affectation of kindness on her part, I loathed the necessity for bearing her name, for calling her mother, and I despised myself for appearing what I was not, instead of openly bearing whatever disgrace belonged to me. I was not like other children, and luckily for my own credit and peace, I did not mix with them, but I had masters; and learnt from Mrs. Rivers what she could herself teach, and I believe made unusual progress in all they caught me.</p>
               <p>"Years went on, till I was seventeen, and then I demanded of Mrs. Rivers the whole story of my birth. She refused to confess there was any mystery in it; declared I must have confused a visit I had made while she had been ill, with some nonsense I had read, and that the whole thing was a perfect fable. I heard her quietly, and told her I knew it was not so; and that if she did not choose to tell me all, it might have been better to speak the truth, since I could not be deceived, but that from that time I should renounce all obedience, all subjection to her, save what it might suit me to give. There was a stormy scene, but in vain; I was firm as herself, or perhaps she did not care enough for it to contend to the death—as she is well able to do when she likes. So we tacitly agreed to go on our respective ways, keeping only an outward semblance of the relationship supposed to exist between us.</p>
               <p>"Now, Norah, comes the bitterest part of my life. Soon after this scene with Mrs. Rivers we became acquainted with an officer, Lieutenant Grenville by name. He paid me devoted attention from the first day we met, and very soon made me what is called an offer. 'Offer of what?' there was my folly. I believed him true and honorable, for with all my faults I was so, and I told him all before I accepted him, and, to my delighted astonishment, his love and tenderness only seemed to increase with the knowledge of my doubtful position, and I adored him for his apparently disinterested true affection. He confessed, however, that our marriage might make some difference in the opinion of his uncle, Lord Hargrave, and that it would he prudent and even necessary for me to consent to a private union.</p>
               <p>"After a long and determined resistance to this arrangement, I consented, and we laid every plan for an elopement. I know not, care not whether Mrs. Rivers had any idea of the affair, but certainly she was conveniently blind to what was going on; and, Norah, do not despise me, I left my home, as I in my heart believed, for the completion of our engagement by a Scotch marriage. It was several hours before I discovered the truth that he was taking me in a totally opposite direction, and, as I soon found, with totally opposite intentions. I need not tell you what I did and said in my indignation and agony. He became desperate and hardened when he saw that he was unmasked, and openly declared that whatever I might choose to do, I should not return till the following day, when my reputation would be so completely in his power, that I might as well consent to enjoy the position and advantages of a reputed wife.</p>
               <p>"The cold-hearted, scheming villain was, however, foiled in the extent of his plan. I returned to my home on the following day, pure and innocent as I had left it, but from that moment in the power of a relentless and hard master. He has ever since held threats over me that he will proclaim the truth, or, rather, the falsehood, that would blast my name, unless I forward his schemes in all that he devises and plans.</p>
               <p>"For a time I cared little for this bondage, in comparison with the misery of the knowledge I had acquired, the crushed affection, which had been the first real happiness of my life; but, by degrees, I learned to scorn and hate the man I had once so loved, and then I laid myself out to thwart the plans he intended, and threatened me to forward. And now comes the chief interest of my tale to you, Norah. Some months ago he introduced to me your friend Gerard Carlton, and I soon saw he was plotting his ruin—ruin that was to be completed by a marriage with myself. I cannot even now fully comprehend his motives, but one certainly was the removal of a dangerous rival from his path, so far as Mabel May was concerned; and I have had strange hints given me that he interferes with yet more vital interests than mere love and marriage can be with that selfish, heartless man, who knows not what true affection is. I have as yet contrived to thwart his views and schemes; I told Gerard that he must never deceive himself by the vain idea that I could make him happy. I undeceived Mabel May as to his real feelings towards her, and through her saved Gerard from deep trouble and ruin, in which Grenville had contrived to plunge him. But much, much remains to fear and to guard against. Gerard's honorable, high-spirited nature is no match for the wiles and plottings of his enemy."</p>
               <p>Norah had listened silently, pityingly, to this rapidly-spoken tale, which threw such novel interest over the beautiful girl who had already won strangely on her regard. But the last part of the relation had brought new suspicions to her mind.</p>
               <p>"You know Gerard intimately, then?" she asked, with a tinge of sisterly jealousy in the tone.</p>
               <p>"I do," replied Adeline. "Sympathy in interests, and similarity of fate, soon bring about a confidence and intimacy, which years cannot accomplish; but, if you mean that there is the slightest spark of any warmer feeling between us, you are wrong; nay, it shows you cannot understand me," she added, impatiently.</p>
               <p>"Similarity of fate, Adeline," repeated Norah, heeding not her passing pettishness. "Tell me," she added, do you know anything of Gerard's birth, his real name, of which even we and his early friends are still ignorant?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, Norah, but that, like myself, he has been disowned, discarded by a father," replied Adeline; "and that, like myself, he knows not his real name, his real parentage; like myself, he is the victim of one, selfish, perfidious, and unscrupulous, but who shall yet find that a woman is a dangerous enemy."</p>
               <p>"Adeline, I wish—oh, if you would, if you could!" said Norah.</p>
               <p>"What?" asked the girl, quietly.</p>
               <p>"If you could trust, if you could learn to care for my brother William," replied Norah. "He is so noble, so good; and he, like yourself, has been disappointed in his first, his only love—oh, Adeline, there might be happiness for you yet!"</p>
               <p>"And you would acknowledge a disowned, nameless girl for your sister?" said Adeline, with a bitter smile.</p>
               <p>"Gladly, affectionately, eagerly!" said the impulsive, warm-hearted Irish girl; "and if I read William's manner aright, it will not need much encouragement on your part to bring him to your feet."</p>
               <p>"Bless you, dearest, for the generous words which softened the bitter hardness into which Grenville's heartless treachery has petrified my best feelings," said Adeline, tears springing to her eyes. "I began to think that all would scorn and reject the worse than orphan; but for the idea itself, banish it, Norah, at once, and never let your brother even guess that you had let it enter your mind. My resolution is taken. I will never marry, unless the real secret of my birth is discovered, and unless this knowledge brings no disgrace with it. And now, dear girl let us say no more on these painful subjects. Mr. Guildford and my mother will be back soon, and they must not suspect that anything has agitated us in their absence."</p>
               <p>As Adeline spoke, they heard steps quietly approaching the drawing-room; and Norah, who was less accustomed to the sudden efforts of self-control which much intercourse with the world soon teaches, left the room, encountering as she did so, the hurriedly advancing figure of Ronald of the Rath. He seemed to be scarcely aware of her presence, and she quickly passed him with a slight bow, hurrying up to the room she was occupying during a brief visit to Garron's Hill, to compose her agitated spirits before meeting the keen observation of her host and Mrs. Rivers.</p>
               <p>Ronald hastily opened the door of the apartment where Adeline still remained, and abruptly approached her, holding out to her an unfolded letter.</p>
               <p>"Read!" he said, abruptly.</p>
               <p>Adeline took the note. It contained but the following few lines in a beautiful but hurriedly penned female hand-writing:—</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText>
                     <body>
                        <div type="letter">
                           <p>"If Reginald Saville remembers the promise made by him under another name, and intends to keep that promise as faithfully as the one was observed for which it was exchanged, he will come instantly, without an hour's delay, to the writer. One very dear to her is in the most imminent danger, and she implores—claims the fulfilment of the engagement made to her, of help in the hour of need.</p>
                           <closer>
                              <signed>M. M."</signed>
                           </closer>
                        </div>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
               </q>
               <p>The letter was dated "Taunton;" but in a corner of the envelope Adeline's quick eye detected a few words written apparently after it had been sealed—"Trust the bearer, and come with him to me."</p>
               <p>Adeline's check grew yet paler as she read and returned the letter to Ronald.</p>
               <p>"It is some fresh villany," she said. "Are you ready to go? Not an hour is to be lost."</p>
               <p>"Like all your impatient sex," said Ronald, smilingly. "But I am not quite so impulsive, fair Adeline. I have strong reasons for remaining here, remember; and that summons is rather too vague and peremptory to be agreeable."</p>
               <p>"It is earnest and real," said Adeline, indignantly;" you know more than I do of the dangers and plots which surround Gerard Carlton. I believe, I am certain you are acquainted<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6520-00000089"/> quainted with his enemy's motives; you have the key of Frederick Grenville's relentless hate and persecution. I warn you, if you trust to his promises, even to your present power over him, he will deceive you, ruin you, ay, worse, without a scruple. The moment his dreaded enemy is removed, you would be the next victim. You must save Gerard; you can, and you will."</p>
               <p>Ronald's eyes were fixed on the speaking face of the girl, with a look of half-inquiring half-admiring earnestness.</p>
               <p>"'Must!' 'will!' are words I seldom brook or obey," he said; but you are right in your estimate of that contemptible scoundrel's character. I know him well; I am his master, and he tries in vain to escape by these secret and sudden moves in his game. Poor fool! why, I have secrets of his that would bring him into the same noose that he has contrived for another. He cannot free himself, even by my death; for there are those who would avenge me, and carry out my directions, were I in the deepest grave in the land."</p>
               <p>"But you will not delay," said Adeline; "you dare not, cannot let an innocent man die, though it may not suit your tangled plans and purposes to clear him at once from the cloud that hangs over him? You will bring sure retribution on yourself if you do not strain every nerve to save Gerard Carlton. Truth will not always remain hidden. Justice may sleep, but it will not die. I do not entreat; I command you to do what you know is your duty, your best safety!"</p>
               <p>The girl had risen in the excitement of her feelings, and stood, in all her proud beauty and queenly bearing, her lovely features flushed and earnest.</p>
               <p>Ronald looked thoughtfully and almost sadly on the beautiful girl. He was one of those strong, iron characters that are more impressed by determined and undaunted courage and will, than by entreaties and tears, and womanly softness.</p>
               <p>"It is strange how this young fellow wins on the hearts of your capricious sex, Miss Rivers," he said, musingly. "Had I been equally fortunate, I might have been very different. Such interest and regard as that evinced by you and the true-hearted girl who wrote these lines, would have been something to live for, something to strive to deserve."</p>
               <p>"You will, you will," said Adeline, eagerly. "You will win our gratitude, our best wishes, our true regard if you will do what we pray, we entreat, we adjure you to accomplish. Go, go at once, I implore you; life may depend on minutes, much more hours."</p>
               <p>"Do not fear," said Ronald, more gently—"I will go; but first I shall ascertain from the messenger what time there may be before it is necessary to act; and then, I give you my word, not a moment shall be lost that will risk his safety."</p>
               <p>"And you can save him—you have sufficient power over Grenville," said Adeline, anxiously.</p>
               <p>"I have many ways of gaining my ends," he replied, "and will leave none untried; but you must not ask more, nor must I lose time by answering useless questions; and remember, you know nothing of my sudden departure. Farewell! You shall hear in some manner of my success."</p>
               <p>He took Adeline's proffered hand, pressed it to his lips for a moment with a sort of reverential regard rather than gallantry, and hastened from the room.</p>
               <p>Some two hours afterwards, when the party met at dinner, Adeline was informed by Mr. Guildford that Mr. Saville had been suddenly summoned to England, but would probably return before his fair guest quitted Garron's Hill.</p>
               <p>"Probably," repeated Mrs. Rivers, in a tone that made Guildford move restlessly on his chair; "indeed, I should imagine there could be no doubt of it, unless our visit is most unexpectedly shortened, or he gives up all idea of visiting Garron's Hill again."</p>
               <p>"Neither of which is very probable, I hope," observed William Adams, courteously. "We must do our best to make Ireland agreeable to you, Mrs. Rivers. By the way, have you taken your fair visitors to any of the noted places in our neighborhood, Mr. Guildford?"</p>
               <p>"None—scarcely any, at least," responded the Justice, eagerly catching at so excellent an opportunity for his purpose. "I have been waiting for my new horse to be broken, that we may accomplish these things in a party. But I think he is quite easy, now, and if you and Miss Norah will join us, nothing would be pleasanter. What do you say to an expedition to Kilkenny, eh, Miss Norah?"</p>
               <p>"We should convince our English friends that it is celebrated for something besides the ferocious cats," laughed Norah.</p>
               <p>"No bad moral from that tale, whether true or not," observed William. "It is not unfrequently the fate of persons grasping at each other's destruction."</p>
               <p>Guildford again cleared his throat uneasily and resumed his subject.</p>
               <p>"Miss Rivers will like to see the antiquities of the place," he continued; "and you young people can roam about at pleasure, while Mrs. Rivers and I take matters more leisurely. I will drive her in my car, and you young folks can have the wagonette."</p>
               <p>The arrangements were assented to, the day was fixed, subject of course to weather and circumstances; and then William Adams took his leave, promising to return on the day appointed, which was the next but two, and they were all left to their own varied and troubled meditations.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XLIX.</head>
               <p>THE day arrived; bright, clear, fresh as an Irish Autumn day so frequently is, and the expedition that was to end so memorably, began with apparent gaiety and enjoyment. William, Norah, and Adeline occupied the little carriage, which, for want of a better name, might be termed a wagonette. Mr. Guildford gallantly handed his future bride into a small covered chaise that was only adapted for two, and when required, a servant in a small scat behind. The drive to the famed city was unusually cheerful and animated to the young trio. William Adams had never appeared to more advantage than while driving Mr. Guildford's spirited horses, and pointing out the most remarkable objects in the route they took, with a degree of taste and information for which even Norah had scarcely given him credit. Adeline's habitual self-control enabled her to appear as gay and interested as if no deeper cares occupied her thoughts; and Norah, bright, joyous, and arch, threw herself into the pleasure of the expedition with all the zest and abandonment of her nature and extreme youth.</p>
               <p>The city once reached, they put up their horses at the principal, if not the sole inn of the place, ordered dinner, and then set off on the tour of sight-seeing. They visited the Stone Tower, the Abbey, the Castle, and, as a matter of course, underwent all the fatigue consequent on such expeditions, though the young clastic limbs of the two girls were less conscious of the stress upon them than their older matronly companion.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Rivers, all unused to the long and continued exertions incident on the drive and subsequent sight-seeing, yet insisted on visiting the principal shops of the place in order to select what the disquieted Justice fully understood was part of her wedding <foreign xml:lang="FRA">trousseau</foreign>. The delay and additional fatigue which this unlooked-for fit of "shopping" on the lady's part entailed, brought consequences equally perplexing and unexpected in their train.</p>
               <p>The tolerably well-served and tempting dinner had its merits most unjustly tested by being served at least an hour after time, and the evening shadows bid fair to be closing in long ere the party would be prepared to set forth on their homeward course.</p>
               <p>"Luckily there is a moon," observed William, "or it might not be so pleasant to drive through part of the road, especially past the Cave of Dunmore. However, it will be as bright as day by nine o'clock."</p>
               <p>"I do not much like it," said Norah, with a slight shudder. "I have been foolishly timid ever since that robbery, Mr. Guildford. But, dear Mrs. Rivers, are you ill?" she exclaimed, suddenly, seeing that lady turn very pale and lean languidly back in her chair.</p>
               <p>"No—only—at least—" murmured the lady faintly, and then fairly fainted away.</p>
               <p>Of course the whole table rose in consternation; Mrs. Rivers was conveyed to a bedroom, and soon restored to consciousness, but still remained so weak and languid that it was evidently impossible for her to endure the fatigue of a long drive, or even to sit up without risking a return of the fit.</p>
               <p>The embarrassment which Mrs. Rivers's sudden illness produced may be easily imagined. The little inn could only furnish two beds for the whole party, and those in small and inconvenient apartments; it was therefore impossible for the whole party to remain for the night. Norah honestly declared herself alarmed at the idea of returning to Garron's Hill at that hour of the night; while Mrs. Rivers, on being consulted as to her wishes on the subject, especially requested that Mr. Guildford might remain, as she should not choose to be left with only one or both the girls in a place so entirely strange and unknown to them.</p>
               <p>"There is evidently but one thing to be done then," said Adeline, with a slight haughtiness in her tone. "I must sleep in a chair in mamma's room, while Norah shares her bed."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Adeline, I am not going to be driven into a fever by such a plan," said Mrs. Rivers. "You can go home with Mr. William Adams, and we will return tomorrow. I only want a night's rest to be well again."</p>
               <p>"Surely," said Adeline, coloring scarlet, "I—that is—Mr.—"</p>
               <p>"You shall not be compelled to do anything that is unpleasant to you, dear Adeline," said Norah. "It is quite absurd of me to be so nervous. I will go home with William, and leave you with your mother."</p>
               <p>"You shall do nothing of the kind, Miss Adams," said Mrs. Rivers, fretfully. "I shall want some things sent to me if I cannot go home to-morrow; and there are letters to be answered, and, in short, Adeline must go, whether you do or not."</p>
               <p>There was, as Adeline knew, no appeal from this decision; and as every moment was now precious, no time was lost in announcing it to the gentlemen, and ordering the small car which Mr. Guildford and Mrs. Rivers had used in the morning.</p>
               <p>"It will be lighter than the wagonette, and you will he home in half the time," observed the Justice. "And you won't of course, return to Bally Adams to-night. Old Mrs. O'Reilly will be quite enough for propriety even with such a lovely girl—eh, Mr. William? You might do worse."</p>
               <p>William laughed, and colored slightly at the knowing wink, to which the Kilkenny whisky, perhaps, gave unusual broadness; but the invitation was accepted, and in a few minutes more the young pair set off on their moonlight drive.</p>
               <p>Scarcely had the last sound of the light wheels died away when the nearly forgotten<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6520-00000090"/> arrangement made with Bryant flashed on Guildford's half-muddled brain. The car, the occupants, all would answer but too fatally to the description given to the men, and in the hurry of the moment and the imperfect light, even Bryant himself would hardly perceive the discrepancy between the fair young girl and her companion, and the middle-aged pair who were destined for the attack. The danger to Adeline especially was so fearful, that even the hardened Justice was struck with horror.</p>
               <p>"Good Heavens!" he exclaimed, "she is a dead woman."</p>
               <p>He rang the bell violently, as if life and death were indeed dependent on each instant.</p>
               <p>"Send—hasten!" he shouted, almost breathlessly. "See if you can overtake my car; beg Mr. Adams to return instantly. Ride for your life, if a horse can be got ready at once."</p>
               <p>The man stood gazing at him in surprise.</p>
               <p>"I have left some important papers," he continued, fearful that he might bring suspicion on himself. "Quick! quick! Don't stand gaping there."</p>
               <p>The man obeyed. But either the pace of Guildford's new thoroughbred was too disproportioned to that of the inn hack, or the rider disliked the neighborhood of the famed cave by moonlight, for he returned after about half-an-hour's absence, declaring he could see nothing of the travellers.</p>
               <p>"Then the Lord have mercy on them!" muttered Guildford, as he entered his bedroom for the night. "She is a dead woman, unless some miracle happens to save her; and, what is worse, it may blow the whole matter, and be a crime without benefit. I would not have a hair of her head hurt, bad as I may be."</p>
               <p>It was a terrible night for the guilty Justice. Each minute, each hour increased his anxiety. He fancied the whole scene—Adeline's alarm; William Adam's resistance; the certain fate of the beautiful girl; the possible murder of the brave young fellow, who would certainly defend her to the very last drop of his blood. And these two young and innocent lives would be sacrificed, without benefit to himself—nay, the murders might even be traced home to him, and the deed which he had intended as the crowning safety of his crooked policy, become the complete ruin and exposure of his whole tissue of crime and deceit.</p>
               <p>Little sleep visited Guildford's fevered eyelids that night, and the few moments of troubled slumber which came at intervals were haunted by visions of blood, and murder, and smothered cries, and accusing faces, which were indeed an earnest of the sure retribution that awaited a life like his. Meanwhile the objects of his uneasiness had proceeded at a brisk pace towards the doomed spot. Little had passed between them, for Adeline was annoyed and embarrassed at her awkward position, and William felt—perhaps for the first time—that it would be no unpleasant duty for him to protect and cherish for life the beautiful girl now under his charge.</p>
               <p>William Adams's passing fancy for Mabel May had been real and ardent in its way, but it was only the natural admiration of a secluded young man for the first attractive girl thrown in his way. But Adeline had produced a very different effect on his more matured and developed character. Her vivacity, her piquant beauty, her singular fascination of manner, and evident strength of will, had made a far deeper and more permanent impression on him, though he had scarcely acknowledged to himself how much his happiness depended on the result of their temporary intimacy, till this solitary drive seemed to realise the possible bliss of such companionship for life. They had therefore driven on in comparative silence for about three or four miles, absorbed in these different reflections, when they were roused from their respective reveries by the horse suddenly casting a shoe, and displaying unmistakable determination not to put up with the consequent inconvenience.</p>
               <p>"What is to be done?" said Adeline, as the animal fairly came to a dead stop.</p>
               <p>"There is a smithy a little further on," replied William, "and I'll soon knock the smith up; but it's a terrible nuisance, Miss Rivers. I am afraid you will connect me with the ill-omened accident."</p>
               <p>"Certainly," said Adeline, smiling archly; "you are bound to guard a wandering damsel from accidents and perils by water and land; and, of course, are responsible for the misdeeds of the horse."</p>
               <p>"He shall be answerable, at any rate," replied William, giving the spirited animal a cut with the whip that sent him forward at a bound.</p>
               <p>A few minutes at this improved pace brought them to Pat Flannegan's smithy, and William, by dint of shouts and blows at the cabin door, managed to rouse the workman from his first heavy sleep.</p>
               <p>"Sure, Misther William, and is it you?" said Pat; "and in Justice Guildford's car! Why, what's up now?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, Pat, but that I want a shoe put on my horse in less than a twinkling," replied William.</p>
               <p>"Sure, and I'm the boy to do it," was the reply; and Pat descended quickly, and at once proceeded to his work, while Adeline was persuaded to alight, and enter the warm cabin during the operation.</p>
               <p>"It's late you are, Misther William," said the man; "and an ugly place you've got to pass. That cave of Dunmore aint better than a den of thieves when the gentry aint coming to visit it, and my Biddy saw some ill-looking thaves o'the world lurking about this morning."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, Pat, I shall give them little time to prepare for us, and I've got my pop guns all ready," said William. "Don't give the lady a hint that there is any danger, remember."</p>
               <p>"Bless her pretty face. No; I'm not the boy to send the roses from such young checks," said Pat; "but, be careful, Misther William, if you must go."</p>
               <p>William thanked the worthy fellow for his hints, and took the opportunity to examine his pocket pistols before re-conducting Adeline to the car. They were well primed, and in good order, and the young man quietly placed one of them immediately under his hand, as he again took his seat in the car, and drove off at a brisk speed.</p>
               <p>On they went, William yet more silent and engrossed than before—though from very different causes of pre-occupation—until they approached the dreaded cave.</p>
               <p>The horse received a smart lash from his driver's whip, not withstanding he was going at a rapid pace, and Adeline was just beginning a remonstrance at the apparent injustice to the noble animal, when a shout, a rush was heard suddenly behind them, and in another instant four men jumped on to the car, one seizing the reins from William's hand, another throwing himself before the startled horse, while the others grasped the terrified Adeline rudely in their arms.</p>
               <p>The task of the robbers was not, however, so easy as they had been led to expect. In another instant the flash of a pistol, and the sharp ring of its report came on the air, and one of the men who was at William's side fell, wounded, if not dead on the road. The men were taken by surprise at a resistance from the very quarter where they presumed they should rather find help; and William taking advantage of the momentary panic, was just drawing his other pistol from the pocket of the car, when his wrist was roughly seized by the companion of the wounded man, and the aim of the pistol turned towards the harmless direction of the stone wall opposite.</p>
               <p>"Fair and aisy, now," said the man, with a laugh. "I don't mind a little bit o'spurt, you see; but enough's enough, and Bill Darrel will serve your turn for this once. There Pat, take the lady, and Dan and I will manage this young fire-cater. And you, Miles, see to the horse; he's a fine un, that's certain."</p>
               <p>The man's directions were quickly obeyed. The man called Pat lifted Adeline from the car, like an infant, and hurried off to the mouth of the cave; while William perceiving the uselessness of resistance, and only anxious to be near the pale, but still silent and self-possessed girl, offered no obstacle to their rapid execution of the remaining orders.</p>
               <p>They hurried on, till they entered that dark and yawning chasm, and even William could not suppress a shudder as it closed behind them, and he saw Adeline rapidly borne forward in the deep recesses of the cavern.</p>
               <p>"Villains, you cannot mean to harm a defenceless woman," he said bitterly. "Take my life, if you will, but restore her to her friends in safety, and they will reward you amply and thankfully."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, we understand." said the man, with a mocking laugh; "we know your game, and I must say you play it well. Yes, yes, we'll make her safe enough, and then you can give us the word as soon as you like."</p>
               <p>William was fairly perplexed with the man's sarcastic but evidently meaning words and look, and for the first time a suspicion that the whole thing must have been not only premeditated, but that some other motive than mere desire of plunder occasioned the attack, flashed across him.</p>
               <p>"Where is your leader?" he asked. "I demand to be taken to him, and the lady also; there is some foul play here that you will dearly rue."</p>
               <p>He quickened his steps as he spoke, for the white dress of the captive girl had now disappeared from his view, and he fancied that his own guard were purposely lagging behind.</p>
               <p>"Do you understand me, villains," he shouted. "We are not to be murdered with impunity, though I will freely pardon and reward you if you set us at liberty. I am—"</p>
               <p>A quick, sharp, agonised cry burst on their ears before William could finish the sentence, a woman's—Adeline's voice! William's despair gave him strength. He burst from the detaining hands of his captors with a sudden effort of convulsive, frenzied strength, and rushed in the direction of the sound. On, on he went, madly, frantically eager to gain the spot ere it was too late. He took one or two turns which were evidently rather taking him away from the spot whence came the repeated sharp, agonised cries; but though every moment increased his despairing terror, and took from his half-exhausted frame the energy which terror had lent, he still kept on at the utmost speed his weary limbs would allow. Then came a sudden gleam of light, the sound of rushing water, a fearful shriek of death-like terror. He bounded forward; the silence was even more terrible than the cries for help; and he made one last effort to clear the remaining distance between himself and the figures he saw dimly in the pale moonlight. It was accomplished. He gained the spot just as the light form of Adeline Rivers disappeared under the rushing water of that dark abyss.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER L.</head>
               <p>GERARD CARLTON'S weary term of imprisonment was fast drawing to a close. In forty-eight hours more he would be free from bondage. The gloomy guard-room, the sentinel, whose heavy tramp had irritated his fevered nerves almost to frenzy,—all these miseries and sufferings were drawing to an end, but the harsh, stern deliverance would be—death! Frederick Grenville's unseen but powerful influence had shortened the usual term between the sentence and its execution, and the time fixed for the dreadful ceremony was less than the ordinary interval by three or four days; but the prisoner awaited it with firmness and resignation. Why should he murmur, or shrink from leaving a world that had so few—it might be said no—attractions for him? Love, friendship, name, honor, were all to him but empty, mocking names for pleasures and sweet enjoyments and lofty efforts, from which he was for ever debarred. The future was dark and hopeless; the present one long, torturing suspense and suffering. He could meet death calmly, humbly, trustingly, as a brave man and believing Christian should, but his fortitude and patience were sorely tried by the bitter trials that were now heaped upon him. He had borne them alone, save when the kind and gentle chaplain of the regiment had come to speak of pardon and hope, which no enemy, no human tribunal, could take away. Lord Hargrave, Mabel, Adeline, those in whom he had trusted for aid and friendship, and confidence in his truth and innocence, were silent, absent. Not one word, not a message, not a sign had reached him to prove that he was remembered, pitied, trusted through disgrace, condemnation, death itself.</p>
               <p>Poor Gerard! it was a hard discipline, and yet it already had done its work. Patience, firmness, lofty self-reliance, yet humble trust in the Almighty Ruler of events were rapidly strengthening and chastening his impulsive, eager nature. The expression of his fine but wasted features was more elevated, more thoughtfully noble and sweet than before. The large, clear eyes were touchingly soft and sad; the once joyous-looking mouth was resigned, yet firm in its deepened lines; and the pale check was yet fair, and almost feminine in its transparent clearness.</p>
               <p>The last night but one had come. In little more than six-and-thirty hours Gerard Carlton would be led forth to endure the last, short, sharp trial; the gaze of men,—some pitying, some curious, some condemning his rash act, which had led to his present end. And then the momentary, sharp pang, the flash, the noise, the last sigh, and then all would be over. And thus he sat, thinking, speculating, praying to Him who alone could support him in present and future heavy trials, and take him to that world where sorrow and death are unknown.</p>
               <p>There had been a lull in the measured tramp of the sentinel, a perfect silence, which did not even allow of the whispers or louder exchanges of passing words that often broke on his half-unconscious car. But he had heeded it not; he scarcely knew that there was any change; he was too deeply engrossed in his own painful yet resigned thoughts to note these passing and, to him indifferent matters. At last his attention was attracted by the sound of the key in the locked door, very different from the hard, loud, sudden, grating click of the guard. Then the door softly, gradually opened, and a muffled figure entered, equally unlike the fall, stalwart form of the sentinel on duty. It was smaller in stature, but perhaps even disproportionately bulky in size, and yet the feet that peeped out from beneath the long cloak were small and delicate.</p>
               <p>The visitor advanced timidly, slowly into the room, without removing the thick muffling from the face, till face to face with the tenant of the apartment, and then stood for a moment, as if irresolute or timid, and Gerard could see the slight tremulousness that shook the thick cloak which concealed the form. Then the resolution seemed suddenly taken, the muffler was withdrawn, the heavy wrapper thrown off, and the beautiful features of Mabel May were revealed to the astonished Carlton's gaze.</p>
               <p>"Mabel, dearest sister, what brings you here?" he said, nervously. "You should not risk your precious self for one so unworthy."</p>
               <p>"No, no, no," she said, hurriedly; "not unworthy, but most injured; and it is I who am the innocent cause of the persecution you have suffered. Gerard, dear brother, I am come to save you; but not a moment is to be lost."</p>
               <p>Gerard shook his head sadly as he ventured to draw the beloved form nearer to him, and to press a light kiss on the white forehead.</p>
               <p>"To save me, dearest!" he repeated. "Do not dream of such wild, dangerous schemes; you cannot succeed; and, if you did, the peril to yourself would be far too great for me to accept life at such a hazard, even were it more precious to me. But it is sweet to see your dear face once more, to know that you still love and pity me, that you will shed a tear for your unfortunate brother when he is gone. Mabel, darling! noble, precious sister; I can die happy now, and you shall hear that I do not disgrace you in the last trying moment."</p>
               <p>Gerard's voice failed him, and Mabel's eyes were full of tears; but she resolutely crushed them back, and spoke firmly.</p>
               <p>"Hush, hush!" she said; "there is no time for indulgence of feeling or hesitation. All is arranged. I shall be safe, quite safe; only, for my sake, be quick and cautious."</p>
               <p>"Mabel, I cannot," he replied; "I will not."</p>
               <p>"You will—you must!" she repeated; "unless you would make my life wretched and hasten my death, Gerard. I have never yet told you how much I am bound up in you; how entirely all the soft, pure affections that are lavished by most on parents, sisters, brothers, are poured out on you. You must not, cannot refuse my prayer; you dare not sentence me to such wretchedness, Gerard—my brother."</p>
               <p>"Mabel, Mabel, in pity spare me!" said Gerard. "Do not make me so selfish, so despicable, as to purchase life at your expense. You know your power over me; use it nobly; think of my honor as well as life."</p>
               <p>"Do you believe I would sacrifice it?" said Mabel. "He who will aid me, who has planned all for me, gives me strange dark hints as to your future, which makes it worth living for, should they be true. And, believe me, your honor shall be vindicated in the eyes of all whose opinion it avails you to deserve. Your own conscience acquits you of all but natural, inevitable resentment towards a base, relentless enemy. He shall be foiled—punished,—if I may trust to one whom I believe able and willing to carry out his promises. But we are wasting precious time. Here, quick! Take these wrappings; give me your soldier's cloak to throw round me, and hasten as quickly as is prudent to the gate of the court-yard. There you will see a man wearing a red handkerchief round his throat, and dressed in a dark grey suit; give him this card as a token, and he will safely conduct you and guide your future course. For mercy's sake, Gerard, do not hesitate," she added, seeing Gerard's unyielding look and gesture.</p>
               <p>"Do you suppose I would expose you to such danger, Mabel?" he said, calmly.</p>
               <p>"The danger is nothing," she replied, confidently; "I have friends who will protect me. Grenville dares not offend my father or me, by allowing me to have my name brought into this affair; and he will be one of the first who will be appealed to when your escape is discovered in the morning. The sole penance I shall endure is a night's lodging in the room which has been your abode for so long, and surely I can well bear that, Gerard, and much more for your sake."</p>
               <p>The young man still stood gazing on the sweet, tender face upturned to his, but he did not speak or move.</p>
               <p>"Gerard, Gerard, you will kill me if you refuse," said Mabel, passionately. "If you love me—if you have any desire for me to know happiness, to rest on the thought that there is one who really cares for poor Mabel, you will fly,—fly at once, before it is too late. You cannot, will not deny me my first, my last request."</p>
               <p>It was impossible to resist that look, that tone, that agonised clasp of the small hand.</p>
               <p>"You have conquered, dear Mabel," said Gerard, stooping down, and pressing his lips to her cold cheek; "but my conscience, my heart smites me sadly. Tell me at least that there are those who will watch over you and protect you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, there are," she replied; "I am safe, quite safe; only be quick." Gerard no longer hesitated, but rapidly donned the large mufflers Mabel had worn, while her trembling fingers strove to aid him in the task; he then took down his soldier's cloak, and enveloped her in its ample folds.</p>
               <p>"My darling, I dare not, cannot leave you," he said, clasping her in his arms with inexpressible tenderness. "It is unmanly, cruel, to take advantage of your unselfish devotion."</p>
               <p>"Have I not told you I am safe?" she exclaimed, eagerly extricating herself from his embrace, and almost pushing him towards the door. "For mercy's sake, Gerard, lose no more time!—too much has been spent in words already."</p>
               <p>Gerard saw that it was indeed worse than useless to stay, especially as his own judgment told him the danger to Mabel might be only increased by frustrating her plans. He kissed her pale check once more, drew the muffler over his face, and in another instant was gone.</p>
               <p>Mabel May listened anxiously for Gerard's retreating footsteps, dreading every instant to catch the sound of some dangerous challenge or ominous scuffle, that should speak of detection and capture. But all was quiet and still in the long night; nothing could be heard but the distant, measured tramp of sentinels, which even her inexperience decided could betoken no unusual catastrophe; and after the lapse of half an hour the girl ventured to cast herself on the couch, which had been Gerard's resting-place for long and anxious days, and strove to compose herself to meet the trials that still awaited her. Morning must inevitably bring discovery; and although she really felt the confidence she had expressed to Gerard of the ultimate result, she could not anticipate the ordeal she might perhaps have to endure, without some womanly trepidation and reluctance. Hours wore on, the morning light began to dawn, and Mabel knew well that every minute brought nearer and nearer the moment of trial.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Gerard had passed, unquestioned, the various apartments occupied by the soldiers and the night-guard, till he reached the last sentry-box. Then he paused for a moment, for the sentinel was immediately in his path, and evidently prepared to demand some satisfactory explanation of his business and presence there at that hour. But any hesitation must necessarily increase suspicion, and Gerard determined to put a bold face on the matter, and go quickly forward, as if unsuspicious<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6520-00000092"/> picious of danger. The sentry, however, stood in his direct path, and in the <choice>
                     <sic>regulation tion"</sic>
                     <corr>regulation</corr>
                  </choice> measured tone of his duty demanded, "Who goes there?" Gerard, in a low voice, modulated as far as possible, to be in keeping with his assumed sex and character, gave the word for the night.</p>
               <p>"But what brings you out at this time, my good girl, and what's your name?" asked the man, doubtfully.</p>
               <p>"I've been to see a friend," replied Gerard, keeping his muffler over his mouth, to smother any masculine gruffness of tone. "Don't be hard on a poor girl; you've got a sweetheart yourself maybe."</p>
               <p>As he moved briskly on, Gerard slipped a sovereign into the man's hand, revealing, as he did so, the hilt of a sword in the folds of his unusual attire.</p>
               <p>"Halloo, what's this!" exclaimed the sentry, as Gerard gathered the cloak impatiently around him.</p>
               <p>The fugitive did not stop to answer the question, but rushed on with the speed of one escaping for life or death, leaving the sentry in a state of bewildering uncertainty whether to pass over the occurrence in convenient ignorance, or to give at once the alarm. Luckily the former alternative prevailed, partly owing to the doubt whether there might not already be blame attached to him for the partial escape of the stranger, and, partly from a laudable feeling of gratitude for the gratuity still in his closed palm; so he resumed his measured tread in silence, whilst the object of his doubts rushed on, without further interruption, till he came to the place indicated by Mabel. He looked eagerly round for the expected guide, but for a moment or two no one appeared. Then a very low whistle was heard, and looking eagerly in its direction, he saw at a short distance the figure of a man, standing half-concealed by a tree, but evidently expecting his approach. He, however, took no notice of Gerard as he walked hastily towards him, save by an almost imperceptible motion of the hand, and a quick, instantaneous glance, as he turned round, and walked rapidly along a path leading through a thick and tangled brushwood into what would, in less richly planted countries, have been dignified by the name of forest.</p>
               <p>Gerard followed the man closely, with perhaps not more than twenty yards between them, though without receiving the slightest mark of recognition of his presence till they reached a lonely cottage with a dim light burning in one of the windows. Here the man stopped, and Gerard, quickening his pace, soon came up to him, and silently held out the card given him by Mabel. The man took it in silence, and held it up to his eyes in the now rapidly fading moonlight; then he nodded his head, and gave three low taps at the door. There was a slight bustle and confusion within, and then a man's voice demanded, "Who's there?"</p>
               <p>The one outside gave as the countersign, "Rath."</p>
               <p>Then the door was opened by a man holding a lantern, and the guide and Gerard entered.</p>
               <p>"All right?" asked the tenant of the cottage, glancing suspiciously at Gerard.</p>
               <p>The man nodded. "Go and call Mother Nell," he said. "Mum's the word."</p>
               <p>The other interlocutor disappeared, and in a few moments an old but still active woman came into the room.</p>
               <p>"Hark ye, mother," said the new comer. "I've brought ye a guest for the night, and perhaps two nights, so mind you make him comfortable: get ready the room in the loft, put some wood on the fire, and set a candle, and something to eat. The sooner this young chap's in his den the better, for him and for us too."</p>
               <p>The woman seemed half inclined to grumble, but a stern look from the man stopped her, and she stumped up the stairs with only low muttered expressions of displeasure.</p>
               <p>The man still kept the profound <choice>
                     <sic>sielnce</sic>
                     <corr>silence</corr>
                  </choice> he had preserved during the whole business, and pointed to Gerard to take a seat by the wood fire, without another word. Gerard knew that his only safety would consist in strictly obeying the directions given to him, and calmly seated himself till the old woman should return from her mission. He had not, however, long to wait. In less time than many a younger woman would have taken, the dame returned, and apparently in better humor, for she condescended to light the candle herself that was to guide her guest to his room, and suggested to their companion that "the gemmen might like a pipe with his supper." The intimation was, however, received only with a polite advice to "mind her own business," and then the man, taking the candle, waved Gerard to follow him.</p>
               <p>They mounted several stairs in silence; then the guide walked a few steps along a narrow passage, and began to ascend a rough ladder, which Gerard also attempted, as soon as the guide had left its rather fragile support. The ladder led to a small but comfortable room, with a clean enough pallet bed, a bright wood fire on the stone hearth, and a chair, table, and a set of deal drawers by way of furniture. A massive chimney-piece served almost as a supplementary table, and the whole apartment was so incongruous that Gerard could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise. But the man took no notice, only motioning him to sit down; and placing the light on the chimney-piece, he prepared to descend, saying he would fetch up something to eat. Gerard would gladly have dispensed with the ceremony, but wisely yielded to his guide's whim, imagining it possible that the supper might somewhat open his heart and lips to give him a little information as to their intended plans.</p>
               <p>A few minutes brought the heavy step of the man once more on the frail ladder, and then he closed the door behind him, and placed on the table a tray with meat, bread, and cheese, and a jug of cider.</p>
               <p>"This is all we have to-night," he said. "We had short notice of your coming, sir; but to-morrow you shall have better fare."</p>
               <p>"I do not wish for it," said Gerard, cheerfully. "I have good reason to he satisfied whether I have any or not. But will you not tell me who you are, and what arrangements you have made for my movements?"</p>
               <p>"You would be little the wiser if I told you who I am," said the man, smilingly. "It is enough for you to know that I am under the orders of one who seldom does things by halves, whether for good or evil. And as for your next question, I don't quite know myself; but I believe you'll leave here to-morrow, or the next day, and I should say oughten't to sleep much till you're over the sea; or on it, any way. But you don't eat; my old woman will grumble if she's had the trouble for nothing."</p>
               <p>Under the excitement of the moment Gerard had little appetite, but to satisfy the man he took a morsel of bread and cheese, and poured out a glass of cider, which refreshed him after his hurried walk.</p>
               <p>"Will your honor like a pipe?" said the man. Gerard declined with a smile. "Then maybe you won't mind my having one," continued the man: "it's safer just now not to leave any trace of men being in the cottage, and this room's all sung and out of the way."</p>
               <p>Gerard assented, and the man, lighting his pipe, began puffing away as leisurely as if it had been two o'clock in the day, instead of the small hours of the night. Gerard pushed the cider jug towards him, but he took out a brandy-flask from his pocket, and filled the spare glass that was standing on the tray.</p>
               <p>"I am not a native of these parts like you, master," he said, "and eider don't agree with my stomach."</p>
               <p>"What makes you think I am a native?" asked Gerard, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Oh, mayhap I knew you in old times," replied the man, with a laugh. "But, any way, I'll stick to my warm drink, for my blood is a bit older and cooler than yours."</p>
               <p>Gerard laughed in return, willing to humor the man's fancy, in hopes of learning something from him.</p>
               <p>"Then it seems you know my age as well as my birth-place," he said. "Can you tell me where I am going to, and what I am to be in times to come?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps yes, perhaps no," replied the man; "but it depends on other folks whether I choose to tell you or not; any way, I can say that I suppose you would not object to take a turn in India, for a change?"</p>
               <p>"Is that the plan?" asked Gerard, starting.</p>
               <p>"Would you object?" said the man.</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't know that I should," replied Gerard, carelessly; "but that is no answer to my question."</p>
               <p>"It's all you're like to get," said the man; and again there was a silence.</p>
               <p>"Did you know my mother?" asked Gerard, suddenly.</p>
               <p>"Did you?" said the man.</p>
               <p>"I am in your power," said Gerard, flushing angrily; "but I do not brook insult, helpless and fallen as I am."</p>
               <p>"Nay, I meant no insult," said the man; "but I've heard you don't rightly know your father; and it's no great wonder, if you didn't know your mother. It's a wise child that knows either, they say. But my pipe's out, and I'll wish you good night."</p>
               <p>Gerard would willingly have detained the man and pressed him with questions as to the hints he had dropped, either accidentally or willingly; but there was no time for the attempt. Ere the last words were well spoken the door had closed behind him, and Gerard heard the key turn in the look before he descended the crazy ladder.</p>
               <p>A momentary feeling of distrust seized Gerard, but the remembrance of Mabel's participation in the plans banished the momentary alarm, and he proceeded to examine his chamber, and prepare for bed, which his bodily fatigue made a welcome prospect. He looked round the room, but the second glance gave little more information than the first. There were the few simple articles of furniture—the blazing fire, the strangely carved mantle-piece. As he replaced his candle on the massive marble he noticed a small portrait in a plain black frame, hanging on the whitened wall.</p>
               <p>Any trifle is interesting where all is monotonous and dull, and Gerard took the portrait from the nail, and examined the features—they were those of a child, a lovely, darkhaired little girl, with wonderfully bright, deep eyes, and features of singular, though hardly childish beauty. The face seemed strangely familiar to him, and yet he had never known any child, save Fanny and Norah Adams, in any sort of familiar intimacy, and most assuredly it had no resemblance to them. He gazed again, and then the truth flashed on him—it was so like, so extremely like Adeline Rivers, even in her maturity, that he could scarcely doubt it had been taken for her as a child. He looked at it again and again, to convince himself of the truth of the impression. There could be no reasonable doubt as to the resemblance, and of its being meant for that lovely girl.</p>
               <p>How, in the name of probability, could a miniature of Adeline have found its way to that humble, lonely cottage? Certainly the woman might have been her nurse; Adeline's father might have lived in that part of the country; but the suppositions appeared so extremely wild, and the circumstance of his discovering them such a romantic, unlikely chance, that he could hardly entertain them without folly and weak credulity.</p>
               <p>"I am getting moon-struck, I believe," he said, half petulantly. "I must get rid<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6520-00000093"/> of such follies, or I shall become my own laughing-stock."</p>
               <p>But with all wisdom, Gerard determined to inquire of the old woman who was the original of the pretty child portrait, and with this satisfactory resolve he fell asleep from pure exhaustion, and slept till far on in the day.</p>
               <p>When Gerard did at last awake from his deep slumber, he saw the same man who had brought him there, on the previous evening, standing by his bedside.</p>
               <p>"You're a plucky one, anyhow," said the man. "Fear and trouble don't keep you awake, that's certain. I opened the door and came right to the bed, and the old woman's made noise enough to waken a dormouse. But jump up. I'll bring you some breakfast in a jiffy, and then we'll talk a bit about what you're to do."</p>
               <p>A few minutes saw Gerard's brief preparations completed, and when the man returned with the capital tea and bacon that formed his morning meal, he was quite ready.</p>
               <p>"How long am I to stay with you?" he asked. "Your fare is capital, and the bed, you see first-rate for sleep; but I feel I am in fetters so long as I am in reach of—"</p>
               <p>"Your enemies," interrupted the man. "Perfectly true; but it's no good leaving shelter to get into the lion's, or rather the fox's mouth. However, you won't be here long. To-night, if all's clear, you're to make a push for it."</p>
               <p>"To the coast?" said Gerard.</p>
               <p>The man nodded his reply.</p>
               <p>"Which part?" continued Gerard.</p>
               <p>"Southampton maybe, maybe Plymouth," replied the man; "but when you get there, you'll see a friend who'll tell you more about it."</p>
               <p>Gerard asked no more; he saw that the man he had to deal with was merely an agent, and forebore useless questions.</p>
               <p>"Can you tell who that little picture was taken for?" he asked, pointing to the miniature.</p>
               <p>"No, I can't say," was the reply. "It's the old woman's fancy to have it there. I've no fancy for children, and I can't see the good of it."</p>
               <p>"Would she give—I mean sell—it to me?" said Gerard.</p>
               <p>"Better ask her yourself," replied the man, grinning.</p>
               <p>"I would willingly, if I got the chance," said Gerard, smiling good-humoredly; "it's so like a friend of mine, that I should very much value it."</p>
               <p>Again the man laughed, and left the room without any further reply. Whether intentionally or not, the old dame came herself to fetch Gerard's tray, and the young man eagerly put the same question that had been evaded by the man whom we must call "Guard," for want of a better appellation.</p>
               <p>"It's a child," was the grumbling reply; "your own eyes could have told you that, I think."</p>
               <p>"And her name?" said Gerard.</p>
               <p>"What's that to you?" said the woman. "You're not likely ever to see her, nor me either, for the matter of that; after you are gone. I expect she's dead long ago."</p>
               <p>"Then it can be no harm to tell her name?" said Gerard.</p>
               <p>"That's no business of yours," said the woman.</p>
               <p>"But, my good woman, it may be my business, and yours also," said Gerard, with persevering good humor. "I tell, you I know a young lady so like that picture, that I feel almost sure it is meant for her, and if you value it as you appear to do, it would please you to hear of her."</p>
               <p>"It's no good," said the dame, shaking her head. "I've sworn to say nothing, and nothing I'll say, though it's many a long year since."</p>
               <p>"Would you part with the little picture? I'd pay you liberally for it," he tried next.</p>
               <p>"What do you want it for?" she asked, after some little hesitation.</p>
               <p>"For the sake of the lady it resembles," replied Gerard.</p>
               <p>"What is she to you?" said the woman;—"a sweetheart?"</p>
               <p>"No, a dear and valued friend."</p>
               <p>"And her name?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"That I certainly shall not tell if you will not give me the least information about a matter in which I am deeply interested," replied Gerard.</p>
               <p>The old woman hesitated again for a few minutes; then said, positively, "I won't sell it, nor will I tell you one word that I have sworn to keep secret; but if you will promise me never to part with it, and to show it to the young lady you spoke of, and never give it to any one but me, or the person you will see to-morrow, I don't mind giving it to you. I'm an old woman now; but don't forget that pretty little creature and her winsome face; and if I could get news of her without breaking my oath, I wouldn't be long."</p>
               <p>"I will willingly, gladly give you the promise," said Gerard; "but I ought to tell you that it is very likely I may leave this country for years, and perhaps never come back, never see the lady I speak of again. I will not abuse your confidence by deceiving you."</p>
               <p>"That's right, that's right," said the old woman. "Well, I'll think—I'll see. It's a ticklish business; but twenty long years and more are gone without anything coming of it, and I don't see that I can be wrong to give it."</p>
               <p>The hours of the day wore wearily away for Gerard, only varied by his meals being brought in by the old woman, the man having apparently disappeared for the time. The slight fit of confidence that the dame had displayed played passed away; she was taciturn and gloomy, turning a deaf ear to any questions Gerard put to her. Towards evening, however, her mood seemed to improve. She gave one or two earnest looks at the young man when she fancied herself not observed, and appeared inclined to speak, though she had hitherto so completely repelled all attempts at communication. At last the light completely faded; the moon had not yet risen, and Gerard's chamber was left in total darkness, while the stillness of the whole cottage was almost oppressive in the gloomy night.</p>
               <p>Gerard fancied for a moment that treachery might be even now at work; but again the thought of Mabel, and all that she had done for him, reassured him; and with a smile at his own weakness, he quietly awaited what might happen, secure in the consciousness that nothing could be really worse than the situation from which he had been snatched.</p>
               <p>Time wore on, and so far as Gerard could calculate, it might be midnight, before any sounds were heard in the cottage; then Gerard could distinguish the murmur of voices, and the steps of more than one person on the gravel beneath the cottage. A few minutes more, and the heavy, slow tread of the old woman was again heard on the stairs. She unlocked the door with some difficulty, and entered with a tray, well laden with a substantial meal, and a light.</p>
               <p>"There!" said she, "make haste over your supper, and get ready to be off. Eat heartily, for you may not have such good fare again for a while."</p>
               <p>By this time Gerard had abandoned himself to his fate without asking questions, or resisting any arrangement made for him, and he silently obeyed the old woman's command to the best of his ability. But the excitement and the complete inaction of the last few days had completely destroyed all appetite, and it was with difficulty that he managed to eat some of the tempting supper and drink a tumbler of cider.</p>
               <p>The dame sat quietly watching his proceedings, and then she took down the little miniature of the child, and gave it to him, with a letter carefully tied up and sealed.</p>
               <p>"There," she said; "I am fool enough to trust you, young man. Take that picture that you asked for this morning, and mind you keep it safe in whatever danger you may be, and when you see the lady you spoke of, ask her whether she remembers Jenny when she was a little one. If she says she does, and you are quite sure about the likeness, you may give her the letter, but by herself, mind, and not unless you are honestly sure she must be the person who has a right to it."</p>
               <p>"You shall be strictly obeyed, my good woman," said Gerard, earnestly; "I will carry out your wishes to the best of my ability; but can you give me no better signs for testing the identity of the lady I imagine to be the original of the likeness and the person you mean? I would not willingly cause mischief or confusion by mistaking the right person, though I would do much to serve the friend I speak of, and I am grateful to you for the shelter you have given me."</p>
               <p>"You are right, quite right," said the old woman, musing thoughtfully, and regaining for the time some of the look of shrewdness that might have distinguished her in former years. "Wait a moment—they are not quite ready—and I will see what I can do."</p>
               <p>She went down the ladder with unusual speed and agility, and remained absent a few minutes. When she returned she held a small box in her hand, tied up, and sealed, to judge from the small, feminine device on the impression, with a woman's initials.</p>
               <p>"There," she said, "that box will tell no tales, even if wrongly opened; and yet, if it is the rightful owner that you give it to, she will remember at least one of the things it contains, and have its fellow in her possession. Mind, it is never to be opened but by her, or in her presence, and you will not give her that letter unless you are sure, as an honest man, she has a right to it, and to the box."</p>
               <p>"I will do your bidding," said Gerard; "and yet, in the lapse of years, is it not probable, at least possible, that this lady might have lost the duplicate of which you speak?"</p>
               <p>"No, no," replied the woman, impatiently, "she was not one to part with such a precious possession. I tell you, it is only the production of that article that should prove her right to the rest. Now, put the box in the most secure place you have, for I hear them calling."</p>
               <p>Gerard obeyed, unwilling to lose the distant chance of serving Adeline Rivers, though still incredulous as to the possibility of any connection between the lovely, elegant daughter of Lord Hargrave's relative, and the old, withered dame who had confided to him so whimsical a trust. But he had little time to consider or hesitate, for the voice of the guide of the previous night now sounded imperatively at the foot of the ladder, and he hastened to join him, thankful to escape from his irksome confinement. The man beckoned to him to follow down the rough stairs, and through the apartment he had seen the night before, in the still, gloomy night; but when they had gained the outside of the cottage garden, he cautiously stopped for a minute and listened.</p>
               <p>All was quiet and still, and again the man moved rapidly and unhesitatingly through the obscure light along narrow paths and numerous turnings, till they reached a spot where Gerard could just distinguish a vehicle of some kind waiting. A low, faint whistle soon brought a man from the shelter of a neighboring tree, and then Gerard and his companion entered the closed carriage, the other man jumped on the box, and they drove off at a steady, but quick pace.</p>
               <p>On they went for miles and miles, and then<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6520-00000094"/> the vehicle stopped at some lonely spot which Gerard could scarcely distinguish in the darkness, and he could perceive that other horses were put to their carriage, and again they went on at a somewhat increased speed.</p>
               <p>It was morning before they halted at a secluded roadside public-house, where Gerard's companion appeared well known and expected; for without any directions on his part they were conducted to an inner room, and breakfast was brought before they were fairly disencumbered of the wraps and mufflers they had worn during the journey.</p>
               <p>"All right, Jenks?" asked the guide of the landlord, who nodded assent. "Go on to-day, eh?" continued the man.</p>
               <p>"To night will be better," replied the landlord. "There's a hue and cry, as I have heard, but not any clue found. I'll keep all safe; but there's no time like night for owls and bats to go abroad."</p>
               <p>The guide laughed and the host left the room.</p>
               <p>"Sensible fellow that, and trusty," said the man turning to Gerard. "You see, master," he observed, "we're going to the coast, and I want to get afloat all snug in the dusk; and then you're safe, and my task's done. I'd better leave you here, and go myself to make sure all's ready, and then there'll be no mishap. Keep snug, and I'll be back by twilight."</p>
               <p>Before Gerard had time to reply, the guide had quitted the room.</p>
               <p>Had not the landlord took some compassion on his weary solitude that day, it might have been a question whether Gerard would have endured the tedious imprisonment with the gratitude and patience becoming one escaped from an early and violent death. But, at the young man's own request, writing materials were brought to him, and for the first time he relieved his burdened heart by pouring out all his gratitude and anxious affection and earnest prayers for Mabel's future happiness and safety, though it was denied him to watch over her himself.</p>
               <p>"You shall still be proud of me, dear Mabel," he concluded. "I will repay all your devotion and courage by cutting my way to honor, if not fortune, in a more kindly land."</p>
               <p>The weary day wore away and the approaching darkness was eagerly hailed by the young man as a signal of his approaching release from bondage. But it had well-night faded into the deep obscurity of night before his guide returned, and when he did, his face looked anxious and clouded.</p>
               <p>"What is it?" asked Gerard, eagerly; "anything adverse occurred to—to—"</p>
               <p>He had feared to compromise Mabel by mentioning her to his guide, but his alarm now well-nigh got the mastery, and he would have finished the sentence rashly in another moment had not the man interrupted him.</p>
               <p>"To my knowledge there's nothing that's adverse, but a squall brewing," replied the man; "but, as I told you before, ask no questions, and I tell you no lies."</p>
               <p>Gerard's self-control was severely taxed to observe the rudely-enforced directions; but again his fears for Mabel's reputation overcame his alarm; and he silently and anxiously followed the lead of his guide, and once more entered the carriage which was waiting for them.</p>
               <p>They drove at a far more rapid rate than on the previous night, and in the course of two hours Gerard could plainly distinguish the roar of the ocean, and the howling of a brisk wind which was fast rising to a gale. At last the carriage appeared to be driving heavily, as if on rough shingles and beach, and then the horses were suddenly stopped, and the carriage-door was opened by a man in sailor costume.</p>
               <p>"Ready?" asked the guide, curtly.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the man; "but it's an ugly night."</p>
               <p>"Can't be helped," was the response; "the place is getting hot; we must be off."</p>
               <p>"Well, the <hi rend="i"/>Saucy Sally will live if any thing can, and the men say the <hi rend="i"/>Perseverance is not so very far off."</p>
               <p>Gerard was now desired to follow his conductor to a rough impromptu landing-place, where a large, heavy boat was fastened to a piece of rock.</p>
               <p>The two men followed him into the little bark, and then the rope was cut. The muffled oars dipped vigorously in the water, and the men pulled with a force and determination that bid fair to conquer even the resistance of the fast-increasing waves that were continually impeding their progress and sending them back towards the shore.</p>
               <p>"The vessel they were trying to reach was little more than two miles from the shore, but it was at least as many hours before they at last hailed the welcome object that looked dark and indistinct in the red light that now and then flashed from the black clouds. But at length, after many vain attempts, the side of the small ship was gained, a thick rope cast out, and in a few minutes more Gerard and his companions stood safe, though cold, wet, and exhausted, on the deck of the little schooner <hi rend="i"/>Perseverance.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LI.</head>
               <p>AFTER a long and tedious voyage, a noble homeward-bound East Indiaman, the <hi rend="i"/>Windsor Castle, was rapidly approaching the English shores. Contrary winds, and passing though sharp and baffling storms, had tried the patience and courage of most of the passengers on board; and even the experienced and skilful Captain Hawser had felt no small uneasiness as to the ultimate safety of his fine ship, and those on board. His long experience of the signs and prognostications of the various latitudes through which his course lay, made him fully expect "dirty weather" on nearing their destination; and his anxiety to reach England before the storms he apprehended might be reasonably expected to occur, had induced him to strain every nerve to accomplish the voyage as quickly as wind and weather would permit.</p>
               <p>The captain's skill and unwearied attention had won not only the confidence, but excited the interest and sympathy of most of his passengers, who quietly and patiently gave themselves up to his control, and endeavored to subdue all expression of alarm or impatience; all, with one exception, and that exception was an old Indian officer, returning to England after an absence of many long years, during which he had gained a large fortune, and lost health, temper, peace, and the best and happiest years of his fast failing life. It might be that. Colonel Fleming deserved pity rather than censure for the bursts of irritation and unreasonableness which made him so insufferable to his companions; but, as the effects were more apparent than their causes, it was not wonderful that the passengers at last tabooed him by common consent, and that he was driven to keep the solitude of his cabin, in order to avoid the slights and mortifications he had brought upon himself.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="i"/>Windsor Castle was now fast nearing the British shores. The spirits of the passengers rose high and bright at the near prospect of meeting, in safety and happiness, those near and dear to them. Even Colonel Fleming had emerged once or twice from his solitude, and managed to preserve a tolerably civil aspect towards his companions; while Captain Hawser, though less confident than his inexperienced charge, gradually grew more cheerful and assured as each hour brought him nearer to an end of his anxious voyage. But man proposes and expects in vain.</p>
               <p>The good ship had made so much progress, that the captain observed, on retiring to his cabin, "Forty-eight hours more, my good friends, and we shall be casting anchor at Southampton."</p>
               <p>The chief mate heard the words without comment, but when the passengers had all retired, he observed to his captain—"I don't like the night, Captain Hawser. There is wild work in the westward, or I am mistaken."</p>
               <p>Captain Hawser went on deck, instead of going at once to his cabin, and his observations soon confirmed the opinion of his officer. Everything portended a storm, and his precautions were taken accordingly—sails were reefed, decks cleared, and all made "taut" for the coming contest with the elements.</p>
               <p>The precautions were not made too soon. In the dead of the night a terrible gale of wind, accompanied by incessant and heavy rain, burst on the doomed vessel, and tested her abilities and the skill of her officers to the utmost.</p>
               <p>Perhaps there can be no more dismal situation than that of passengers in a vessel during a severe gale, shut up in a small and imperfectly lighted cabin, listening to the deep moaning of the furious winds in the shrouds, the bursting of the raging surge, which shakes the vessel from stem to stern, and to the imperfectly heard voices of officers and men amidst the relentless blast, with desperate efforts to catch some gleam of hope from the countenance or words of some hastily passing official. The horrors, indeed, of a storm at sea, are enough to shake the nerves of the bravest, even if fear of death does not mingle with the tremendous horror of the scene.</p>
               <p>Colonel Fleming had remained alone and self-reliant in his cabin, though the pallor of his sunk check and the rigidity of the closed lips showed that life and death were not so indifferent to him as his cynical gloom and irritation might have implied. Low and occasional mutterings escaped him of "ill luck," "cursed accidents," and "his own folly in trusting himself to the chances of a voyage for the sake of relatives who did not care a farthing for him." Suddenly the captain's cheerful voice was heard at his door.</p>
               <p>"Courage, colonel, courage," said he; "the old ship behaves well; we shall weather it yet;" and then he hurried off to his duty.</p>
               <p>"Confound you and the ship too!" growled the old man; "what does it matter if you go to the bottom? But when I've been thirty years in India to gain wealth and honor, and come back, like a fool, to see if my jackanapes of a nephew has any claim to it, why it would make a saint swear. Ha, there goes a mast! now it comes! Well, I'm glad I made my will before I left India. If that young rascal can prove he's all right, he'll come in for my money; if not, he'll get his deserts, and lose every farthing."</p>
               <p>Then came a tremendous lurch, a shout, a crash; it was evident, even to the military landsman, that something terrible had occurred. The vessel must have sprung a leak.</p>
               <p>In spite of his valetudinarianism, Colonel Fleming rushed on deck, as the cry, "All hands to the pumps" was raised. What a scene met his eyes as he mounted the last stair, and clung to the rails for support! The deck was strewed with ropes, spars, buckets, torn sails, fragments of masts, over which passengers and seamen stumbled in the pitchy darkness, faintly lighted by two lanterns hung at the pumps, at which all hands were eager to work. Alas! in vain. The cargo, consisting chiefly of pepper, had got adrift, and choked the pumps so effectually that they were presently abandoned in despair. Captain Hawser preserved his self possession,<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6520-00000095"/> but it was easy to see his hopes were fast failing, though every expedient that man could devise was carried into effect to meet the crisis, and supply the loss of the damaged pumps.</p>
               <p>Daylight at length appeared; the <hi rend="i"/>Windsor Castle was four feet deep in water, and no effort to repair the pumps or stem the influx of water had the slightest effect. Captain Hawser saw that all hope was gone, and gave orders for the launching of two boats which remained; the others had been carried away by the violence of the gale. But when, after great difficulty, this order had been carried out, a new crisis occurred. Some of the sailors, who had broken open the door of the spirit-room, and indulged in desperation their craving for its contents, now lost all discipline or sense of shame, and seizing the boats, leaped in, and cut the ropes before either officers or passengers could interfere. They launched out into the still raging deep, but their crime met its own punishment—they were engulphed in the heavy waves, and within sight of the doomed vessel, before a quarter of an hour had elapsed. At this precursor of their own impending fate a shudder of horror ran through the passengers.</p>
               <p>"There is no hope," said Colonel Fleming, more calmly than he had yet spoken; "the water is fast rising; see, Captain Hawser!"</p>
               <p>"We must meet our fate like men," replied the captain. "The poor women—they are the most pitiable."</p>
               <p>Colonel Fleming was about to give a somewhat grumbling dissentient, when the first mate, who had been eagerly looking through a glass into the foggy horizon, joyfully exclaimed, "A sail—a sail on the larboard!"</p>
               <p>The effect was electrical; the men redoubled their efforts to retard the progress of the water; glasses were eagerly levelled in the direction pointed out by the mate, and at last a small vessel was plainly seen going to the larboard, and evidently riding out the gale with sails furled, and all "snug and taut."</p>
               <p>Signals of distress were instantly fired from the almost sinking ship, unmindful of the too obvious fact that no vessel could approach them in such a gale. But in this emergency, when human help was vain, the mercy of Him who ruleth sea and wind came to their aid. The gale suddenly abated as the sun arose, gleams of light shone through the dark clouds, and the sullen waves began gradually to lull their loud roar and tumult.</p>
               <p>Five feet of water had now risen in the hold of the ship. The stranger vessel was plainly seen bearing up to their aid, but would she reach the <hi rend="i"/>Windsor Castle in time? A few more minutes, another foot of water in the hold, and she must go down. Again they signalled; again the guns were heard in quick and agonised succession. Then boats were seen putting off from the small vessel, now clearly made out to be a schooner, and the brave fellows that manned them boldly, desperately battled with the swell that baffled their attempts to reach the ship. It was an awful moment, and even the trembling fainting women mustered in timid groups to watch the struggle against time and the elements; a few yards more, and they would be in reach; a few more gallant pulls of the oars, and the noble fellows are under the stern, clinging to the ropes, and helping the women and children to descend to their boats.</p>
               <p>Luckily, one of the swamped boats of the <hi rend="i"/>Windsor Castle drifted towards the spot, and with the help of the sailors and the newcomers she was righted, and thus enabled to bring off the whole of the remaining crew and passengers of the doomed vessel.</p>
               <p>One after another the passengers descended in safety, till it came to Colonel Fleming's turn. His age and extreme debility, or perhaps the agitation that he had undergone, made his footing insecure; he missed his hold, and fell into the dark waters that still foamed beneath the vessel. A cry of horror arose; then came a sudden start, a plunge, and one of the brave fellows belonging to the stranger boats was seen with the drowning colonel in his grasp, gallantly stemming the torrent as he swam towards the friendly oars held out towards him. A few moments, and both were safely in the boat, and receiving the congratulations and compliments which the gallant rescue deserved and excited, even in that hour of excitement and danger.</p>
               <p>"You are a good swimmer, sir," said Captain Hawser to the young fellow, who sat shaking off the wet that dripped from his garments and rich dark hair.</p>
               <p>"Indifferent," was the careless reply, <choice>
                     <sic>and and</sic>
                     <corr>and</corr>
                  </choice> then the young man turned to receive an oar which had been demanded by him as the best remedy against cold.</p>
               <p>Captain Hawser gazed attentively at the young man—there was something so uncommon and startling in the fine features that it might well occasion the interest his look expressed, especially after the gallant deed he had just done.</p>
               <p>"It seems to me I must have seen your features before, or some one like them," said the captain, musingly.</p>
               <p>"May be," replied the young man; "I have seen a good many in my time on land and sea; but who is this amiable-looking individual I have fished up?"</p>
               <p>"Hush!" said the captain, "he is coming round. He's an Indian military nabob, a Colonel Fleming."</p>
               <p>"Fleming!" exclaimed another of the rescuing party who was pulling one of the oars "with a will," and who had been listening with some interest to the little dialogue. Good Heavens! is it possible!"</p>
               <p>"How, do you know him, Carlton?" inquired the first speaker, who as the reader will instantly guess, was no other than Ronald of the Rath.</p>
               <p>"Yes, a little—at least by name," replied the young man, flushing deeply; but just then the violence of the still sullen waves demanded the whole energies and strength of the rowers, and for some minutes the heavily laden boat seemed to wage an unequal contest with the tremendous force that met its progress.</p>
               <p>The strenuous exertions of the powerful and youthful crew at last overcame the strong surging waves which breasted them; and in half-an-hour after they had left the sinking ship, the cold, wet, exhausted freight the boat contained was safely placed on board the <hi rend="i"/>Perseverance, and Colonel Fleming and the women placed in warm, comfortable berths, given up to them at some inconvenience by the officers and passengers of the rather eccentric craft that had come so opportunely to the rescue of the <hi rend="i"/>Windsor Castle.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER LII.</head>
               <p>DAYS had lengthened into weeks, but no tidings of William Adams and Adeline Rivers had reached their relatives, nor had the slightest clue been obtained of their fate. The return of the horse to Garron's Hill had given the first warning that some catastrophe had occurred; but as the servants were unaware of the sudden illness of Mrs. Rivers, and the consequent change in their master's plans, they knew not in what direction to search, nor who had been the sufferers by the accident which had sent home the sagacious animal, alone and unguided. It was therefore many hours before any active measures had been taken to discover the fate of the missing ones, or an alarm given at Bally Adams to the conscience-stricken justice, on his return to Garron's Hill. But no sooner had the tidings spread in the neighborhood than the villagers took the matter in their own hands, and unbidden, unauthorized, zealously assisted the half-frantic Mr. Adams, and the apparently deeply shocked Guildford, in the search. The Rath was the first place examined, after a general search in the direct road from Kilkenny, and the adjacent spots; but not a vestige appeared of its having been visited since the last examination by the authorities. Small articles, and the few pieces of broken furniture that had been then displaced, were in precisely the same position now, and the most suspicious could hardly entertain an idea that the lost ones could have been conveyed thither.</p>
               <p>The cave of Dunmore was next suggested by one of the more knowing of the officials, and Guildford dared not appear to check any proposal which might lead to a discovery of his lovely guest, and the heir of Bally Adams. All he could do was to head the search himself, and trust to his good fortune and Bryant's prudence for baffling discovery. Nor was this confidence misplaced. The cave was empty, not a trace of human habitation was visible; the water roared, the walls echoed the noise, as they had done since the creation of its wonders; but no voice, no fragment of dress, of food, of human belongings, could be found. Reassured, though bitterly remorseful for the useless and foul wrong to the young and innocent victims of his guilty scheme, Guildford was now foremost in requiring a second search in the vaults of the Rath, and Adams, rendered desperate by his anxiety, agreed to accompany him and the bravest of the constables and tenants in the perilous expedition. Torches were lighted, the little party cautiously descended, and trod carefully and hurriedly along the gloomy recess. Again they approached the spot where poor William Adams had detected the strange, indistinct object that lay in the dark corner of the furthest cave. The torches flashed round; the quick eye of the father detected the suspicious heap, and in a few moments the skeleton of a man, perfect, and but little altered by the time that had elapsed, was exposed to view.</p>
               <p>Guildford's pulses beat audibly as he bent over the body; but not a vestige of anything that could identify it with Ryan was to be seen. The hair was black; Ryan's had been nearly red; the hands were smaller than the tall Irishman's, and one finger was missing from the left hand, evidently from some long-seated injury. Guildford breathed more freely, Adams gave a groan of mingled relief and disappointment, and then the body was removed to the upper regions, where an official description, and regularly witnessed statement was drawn up, and orders given for the prosecution of an active inquiry as to the murdered man's <choice>
                     <sic>indentity</sic>
                     <corr>identity</corr>
                  </choice>.</p>
               <p>But all this, though it diverted to some extent the attention of the persons engaged, gave little consolation to the wretched father, whose last hope seemed to desert him, now that the search had been thus apparently concluded. His despair knew no bounds, and any consolation that was attempted, instead of softening, seemed only to aggravate his grief. His heir, his pride, his first-born, was taken from him; not a gleam of happiness could henceforth visit his desolate home. Every motive for exertion, every effort to improve his fortune or position, had been connected with William, and he would listen to no arguments, entertain no hopes that were held out to him by his family and friends. In vain did Mr. Seaforth preach patience; in vain did Norah, smothering her own grief,<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6520-00000096"/> strive to supply the place of her brother—Adams's countenance was never illumined by a smile, and no look of approval or kindness rewarded her efforts.</p>
               <p>At Garron's Hill matters were not much more promising than at Bally Adams. Guildford's conscience was scarcely seared enough not to feel smitten and crushed by the needless and terrible crime of which he had been the cause, while Mrs. Rivers did not fail to give significant hints of her satisfaction that she had escaped the mysterious fate of her daughter, and suggest that the best thing Guildford could do was to hasten their marriage without further delay.</p>
               <p>Styles, the lawyer, had at last been summoned to give his aid in making arrangements for the wedding, which Guildford dared no longer attempt to evade, and the three worthy associates were seated in the library, talking over the settlements and provisions which could safely and reasonably be made for the exacting bride-elect. On this point, as will be imagined, there was a considerable difference of opinion, and the argument was waxing rather warmer than was consistent with the relation about to exist between the parties, when a knock at the door was heard, and, without waiting for a reply, the door opened hastily, and a servant, in a state of great excitement, entered, bearing a small iron box.</p>
               <p>"Plase, your honor," said he "the workmen who are repairing the kitchens have just found this box, and I thought it might have some treasure in it, your honor."</p>
               <p>"Open it," exclaimed Styles, as the man retired.</p>
               <p>This was easily accomplished, when, instead of money, only a yellow and crumpled parchment met their disappointed eyes.</p>
               <p>"Deeds, perhaps," observed the lawyer: "some treasure, after all. Let me see, Justice."</p>
               <p>Guildford's trembling hands relinquished the hold of the parchment, and Styles eagerly ran his eye over it, and then a cynical smile crossed his features.</p>
               <p>"Very pretty, certainly," said he. "I did not know the old man was either a poet or soothsayer; but it is a strange effusion any how, and not over flattering."</p>
               <p>"Read it," said Mrs. Rivers, in her soft, calm voice. "There should be no secrets between man and wife, you know."</p>
               <p>"Certainly not, madame," said the lawyer; and then he began— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"This house was built by Michael Garron,</l>

                        <l>Deserting friends, while strong in health,</l>

               </p>
               <p>"A cheerful prediction!" observed Mrs. Rivers. "It might frighten some bride-elect; but I am too true to my promise to mind such a prospect. Andrew, my dear, if you are as true to me, I shall have nothing to complain of; and you may chance to escape the terrible fate which that bewitching prophet paints so prettily."</p>
               <p>"Confounded liar!" muttered Guildford; but whether the remark was meant for the lady or the poet remained uncertain.</p>
               <p>"Any way, it need not interrupt our little plans," continued Mrs. Rivers. "I pledge myself that the threats will not be carried out without considerable difficulty when I become mistress of Garron's Hill; more especially if it is settled on me, or our children, should we be blest with any, eh, Mr. Styles?"</p>
               <p>Styles laughed, a hollow, sardonic laugh; but the Justice rose impatiently from his chair, and kicked both box and parchment to the other end of the room.</p>
               <p>"I tell you what, madam," said he; "I'd risk all that doggerel rubbish threatens for a day's peace; and if you'll take my advice, you'll put up with what I offer; for I swear by all that is sacred I will not budge one inch from my proposition. You and Styles can settle it between you—I'm sick of the whole thing, estate and all."</p>
               <p>Slamming the door violently behind him, Guildford left the room to conclude the business as they best could. Styles had both more coolness and more tact than his patron in the negotiation, and before they separated, he had contrived to bring matters so far to a conclusion that he was empowered to draw up the deed of settlement, and the wedding-day was fixed for the ensuing week.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LIII.</head>
               <p>THE <hi rend="i"/>Perseverance had apparently no very pressing business to hasten her departure on her outward voyage, for she made no especial demur at turning her course in order to land her rescued freight on English shores.</p>
               <p>"I almost think I shall come on shore with you, colonel," said Ronald, who had become an extraordinary favorite with Colonel Fleming during the short cruise. "You see I only meant to accompany your nephew as far as Malta, and see him comfortably settled there, in obedience to the will of a mutual friend. But, as you have promised to exert your interest at head-quarters for him, and—"</p>
               <p>"Interest, indeed!" exclaimed the old officer. "The hot-headed, irreverent young scamp does not deserve it;—strike his superior officer! Why, sir, if I had done so at his age, I should have had short shrift. The guard would have been marched out, and I in the grave before twenty-four hours."</p>
               <p>"But you will keep your promise, colonel?" said Ronald. "I assure you, you will not repent."</p>
               <p>"Humph, don't know," said the colonel; "he's my silly sister's son; but as to that, well, less said the better; and then, you tell me he's a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">protégé</foreign> of Lord Hargrave, and his lordship and I were old cronies; but then it's his nephew that the young rascal struck. It's a deucedly ugly business altogether."</p>
               <p>"No fear, colonel," said Ronald. "Lord Hargrave would back up your intercession, I promise you; and, in short, I make it a personal request that you'll do what you can. My own interests require it, and between you and me, Grenville's no great disciplinarian himself, snubs those above him, if they have no handle to their names; and yet, he may chance to break down himself some day."</p>
               <p>The colonel was softened, and at last yielded so far as to give a sort of engagement to obtain his nephew's pardon, as the reward of his own long services.</p>
               <p>It will be inferred from this dialogue that the peppery old colonel had retained sufficient vitality in his worn frame to rally from the effects of his involuntary sea bath, and the agitation that had preceded it, and also that Gerard had made himself known to his mother's brother, as soon as the latter was in a state to bear the communication. It must be confessed, however, that the old man had not received the child of his only sister with the warm and grateful cordiality which might have been expected in his lonely and desolate old age.</p>
               <p>"Humph! not a bit like your mother," he would grumble, as he looked keenly at his nephew; "I suppose you take after your scamp of a father. Pity I can't have Agatha's lawful child to cheer my old age, instead of—Well, well, she's dead and gone, and I won't bear ill to the dead; but mind ye, youngster, I promise nothing, so don't expect I'm going to make a nabob of you without any trouble and labor of yours. I've worked hard, and so must you, I warn you."</p>
               <p>Strangely enough too, the eccentric old man distinguished Ronald by most marked and wayward regard. Either from gratitude for the service rendered him, or some unaccountable caprice, Colonel Fleming took every opportunity of displaying his liking for the young adventurer. He would call him continually to his side, take his arm in walking the deck, single him out on all occasions for every mark of favor that he had to bestow; but Ronald only laughed in discussing this fancy with Gerard.</p>
               <p>"It will come out some day, Carlton," said he; "there are strange cards yet in the pack, and when I see the game coming to a close, out they will pop. But I am no tyro to show my play even to my friends; they might ruin all by an indirect word or even look. But the course is clear to <unclear>me</unclear> now. I've been no saint in my time, and don't pretend to the least disinterestedness now; but I'm tired of the life I have led, disgusted: I might almost say remorseful, only I hate cant. And if I can help those that deserve it, punish a rascal, and get some of the spoil myself, it's no bad beginning of a new course."</p>
               <p>"You're better than you confess, Ronald," said Gerard: "and though I can guess but little of your meaning, I am certain you are really a very different man from what I believed Reginald Saville to be in my most credulous days of faith in his nobility."</p>
               <p>Ronald turned carelessly away; he was too proud to like to confess what he still looked on as a half-weakness, his real relenting towards truth, and honor, and goodness.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="i"/>Perseverance had steered toward Plymouth, deeming it about the safest port at which she could touch for the more doubtful and suspicious portion of the passengers. Every precaution was taken to preserve Gerard's incognito, and that of the man who had taken an active part in his escape, and who has to accompany him to Malta.</p>
               <p>Captain Hawser, his mates, the colonel, and Ronald were the last to land; the females and the few cabin passengers who had been on board having been first safely deposited on shore, and placed in charge of a dock official who happened to be on duty. For greater security the boat which had conveyed them returned in company with one of the dock boats, in order to enable the <hi rend="i"/>Perseverance to weigh anchor the moment the last of her guests left her, without delaying for the return of her own crew.</p>
               <p>Farewells were interchanged; the party took their places in the boat, and were steered rapidly to the shore.</p>
               <p>"They are on the look-out for us," observed Captain Hawser. "I suppose the news of the shipwreck has got about, and I shall have to post to town to prevent its being forestalled at the owners."</p>
               <p>Ronald made some casual reply, but the colonel was absorbed in the natural emotions on revisiting his native land after so many years' absence, and scarcely heeded the sailor's words.</p>
               <p>There was evidently some especial stir in the dock. Three or four officials stood on each side of the landing-place, and watched with eager attention the approach of the boat. Their interest was undoubtedly eager enough to be flattering; but as the boat neared the shore, it amounted to intensity. As each man landed they gazed intently at him, and exchanged glances with each other. Colonel Fleming, Captain Hawser, and his officers, went up the stairs first, unquestioned<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6520-00000097"/> tioned; then Ronald brought up the rear; but the instant he put his foot on the last step he was seized by the men who had been so attentively watching the landing.</p>
               <p>"Reginald Saville, you are my prisoner," said the elder of the men.</p>
               <p>"On what ground?" asked Ronald, haughtily, and trying to shake off the hand laid on his arm.</p>
               <p>"On that of having aided and arranged the escape of one Gerard Carlton, while under sentence of death," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"You scoundrels! Is this how you treat a gentleman?" exclaimed Colonel Fleming, who had stood indignantly watching the scene. "Who set you on—"</p>
               <p>"A warrant in His Majesty's name," replied the man, with unusual civility. "It's no pleasant business, I can fell you, sir; but you see, Mr. Beaumont—"</p>
               <p>"Silence!" interrupted Ronald. "This charge will soon be disproved. Colonel Fleming, I will say one word before I accompany these men."</p>
               <p>"Can't allow it, sir," said the man, firmly.</p>
               <p>"Sirrah," burst in the colonel, "I am a colonel in His Majesty's service, and thirty years in the service; and dare you to insult me, sir, by not trusting me with a gentleman under an unproved charge? I will report you, sir, for insolence."</p>
               <p>Somewhat impressed with the colonel's manner and rank, the man so far yielded as to fall back a short distance, stationing his comrade on the other side, so as to effectually prevent any escape.</p>
               <p>"Colonel," said Ronald, in a low tone, "you can do me an essential service by forwarding this token to Taunton with all speed, and having it placed in the hands of a person whose name and address are on this paper. Say that it must be forwarded without an hour's delay, and that I require the person to whom he will send it to be with me in forty-eight hours from this time. Will you do this for me?"</p>
               <p>"I'll take a post-chaise directly, my young friend," said the colonel. "Don't be afraid. I'll take good care that this absurd charge shall be dropped. I never forgive an enemy, nor forget a friend. I'll stand by you."</p>
               <p>The old officer moved off, without paying the least attention to the various offers of assistance he received on all sides, as he walked along the pier. A post-chaise was soon obtained, and in less than half-an-hour from his landing, the worthy man was driving away as fast as four horses would convey him towards Taunton. He had now leisure to inspect the articles intrusted to him. The "token" alluded to by Ronald was a silver arrow, fastened by a small chain to a clasped hand, and bearing the motto, "Speed and Safety." The direction was to "Janet Morris, Myrtle Heath, Taunton."</p>
               <p>The colonel pished and pshawed at the rather vague direction, but finally concluding that money would accomplish everything in England, as well as in India, and that he should find plenty of persons to guide him to the spot named, he offered double pay to the positilions to get him to Taunton that night, in time to deliver his charge before retiring to rest. The effect was magical, and in less than two-thirds of the usual time occupied in the journey he was safely landed at the "White Hart," then the principal hotel in Taunton.</p>
               <p>Colonel Fleming was a man of his word, in spite of all his harsh, ungracious selfishness. His first inquiry, after the preliminary forms of "Private rooms?" "Supper sir?" had been gone through, was to inquire of the obsequious landlord for the said "Janet Morris," and "Myrtle Heath;" but his replies were not particularly satisfactory, though Colonel Fleming strongly suspected he knew more than he affected to understand as to the place and person in question.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, certainly," said he. "There is such a place, and, I fancy, a lone cottage, almost in the wood, as you may say. But it's a long way, and I really can't take on myself to say who lives there; but I can send, if your honor pleases, and ascertain."</p>
               <p>"Could a carriage go to the place?" inquired the colonel.</p>
               <p>"Not within a quarter of a mile, your honor," was the reply.</p>
               <p>The colonel inwardly cursed the English faculty of getting up scrapes, and investigating matters at inconvenient times and places, instead of letting folks dream away their lives in peace and comfort; but the remembrance of his own unpleasant immersion, and the life which had been risked for his, luckily came in time to check the "No" that hovered on his lips.</p>
               <p>"I shall go myself," said he to the landlord. "Order as light a carriage as you've got, and let some one go with me to show me the way."</p>
               <p>The landlord hesitated a moment, then said—"But, sir, if the morning would—"</p>
               <p>"Silence, sir, and begone!" was the stern interruption to the half-uttered remonstrance against these midnight proceedings; and the worthy Boniface was fain to make his exit, and gave the required orders as quickly as possible.</p>
               <p>In less than half an hour the colonel had taken some hasty refreshment, and was <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> for "Myrtle Heath." The vehicle was a light one, and before he had time to indulge his peevish grumblings and alarms as to "night damps," "robbers," "overturnings," and other valetudinarian grievances, it suddenly pulled up, and the agreeable intelligence was given that he could go no further on any legs but his own.</p>
               <p>Wrapping his thick cloak closely round him, and drawing his warm muffler yet more firmly over his mouth, the unlucky Indian set off on his "night walk" with the aid of a stout bamboo cane in one band, and the arm of his stalwart Somersetshire guide on the other. The moon was but young, but the stars were exceedingly bright, and the sky was clear, so that there was little difficulty in finding the way, nor danger of cold on such a night; still, the colonel growled, and scolded, and stumbled, during the quarter of an hour or so which the walk continued; but the stolid guide listened in perfect indifference to the storm levelled at him, and only wondered why the "old gemman should put himself out of the way for nothing at all."</p>
               <p>At last the glimmering of a light announced their approach to some habitation, and the guide confirmed the idea by observing, "Yonder's the only cottage in this part, zur, though I can't say who keeps it; and, to speak truth, I don't think any of the folks hereabouts can make them out, nor their doings; not as I knows anything against them, zur."</p>
               <p>"Pleasant this!" growled the colonel. But cowardice was not one of his cardinal faults, and, moreover, he had some true English doggedness of purpose in him; so he walked firmly on with a more assured step than he had yet ventured upon, and tapped violently at the door with his thick bamboo.</p>
               <p>No answer was at first given; but there was a confused rustle and whispering within; and the passing of shadows between the window and the light betrayed that the tenants were both up, and perfectly aware of the summons thus impatiently given.</p>
               <p>Another tremendous attack on the door, and a "Open it, will you?" from the exasperated colonel produced some effect.</p>
               <p>Steps were heard slowly approaching; the murmur of voices became gradually more distinct and loud, and the colonel even fancied he could distinguish the words, "I will not, why should I?" in a young, clear voice; and "You must; I will not open till you do," spoke in a hoarser and croaking tone.</p>
               <p>A third and yet more impatient summons; and the words, "Open, or we'll smash the door," in the stentorian tones of the guide, hastened the crisis of the debate within. Heavy, slow steps came lumbering to the portal, the bolt was withdrawn, and the angry old Indian burst into the room, just in time to catch sight of a beautiful young girl escaping with apparent reluctance through the door on the other side of the room. Her face was turned to the colonel and he caught a distinct and full view of her lovely and well-marked features. The effect was electrical. He stopped, leaned heavily on his cane, and turning to the old woman who had opened the door, and whose presence he had hitherto absolutely ignored, said fiercely, "Woman, who is that? Quick, speak! are you deaf or dumb?"</p>
               <p>"Both when it suits me," said the woman, coolly. "If I don't choose to answer questions from strangers I am deaf as a post, and dumb as my Tiger there," she added, pointing to an image on the mantel-shelf.</p>
               <p>"You <emph>shall</emph> speak, old hag," burst in the colonel, "Who is that girl, I say? I must, I will know."</p>
               <p>"Who are you that ask?" was the counter question.</p>
               <p>"What's that to you, you insolent woman?" rejoined the irritated nahob.</p>
               <p>"So much that you won't get an answer till I know why I should give one," said the woman, coolly. "What's your business here, disturbing honest folks at this time of night?"</p>
               <p>The question recalled the old man to himself. He turned round to the gaping guide, and bade him shut the door, and wait for him outside for a few minutes; a command which did not at all meet the approbation of the Taunton ostler. However his orders from his master had been strict and precise; and he grumbingly obeyed, while taking care to place his ear as near, the key-hole as possible, while his exclusion continued.</p>
               <p>No sooner had the door closed than the colonel, sitting down on a large chair which was near him, rather from pure exhaustion than any intention of taking up a resting-place in the cottage, inquired, "What's your name, my good woman?"</p>
               <p>"Why do you want to know?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"Because I've something to deliver which must only be given to one person," said the colonel, warned by experience of the uselessness of contention with the obdurate old dame.</p>
               <p>"Well, then," said she, "if it's Jane Morris, what then?"</p>
               <p>"Then I suppose you're the right person for this," replied the colonel, drawing out the token.</p>
               <p>The woman started, and said anxiously, "He's in danger, then?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied the colonel; "and he desires you to have that sent to the person it is meant for in Plymouth, before forty-eight hours from this. Can you do it?"</p>
               <p>"Are you going back to him?"</p>
               <p>"Probably," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"You must," she said, peremptorily. "Tell him the person he wants is nearer than he thinks; but that his business is urgent in these parts, and if forty-eight hours will do, that time will be well spent. Can you remember this!"</p>
               <p>"Humph," said the colonel; "rather cool, to make a colonel in His Majesty's service a messenger from an old woman, to a young jack-a-napes in trouble. It's a lesson to me, never to help a living soul again; one always gets into scrapes and insults."</p>
               <p>"Old man, the youth that sent that knew what he was about," she replied, calmly. "And if he had no claim on you, he'd never have given you that bauble. You can't deceive me; I've seen too much; alas, alas! too much for myself, too much for many another."</p>
               <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6520-00000098"/>
               <p>Colonel Fleming was struck by the calm earnestness, almost dignity of the woman's manner.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you are right," he said; "life for life, that's but fair. I'll do your errand, old mother; and then I'll wash my hands of the whole matter. But, harkye, won't you answer my question now? Who's that girl I saw when I came in?"</p>
               <p>"No, I cannot tell you," she said; "at least not now. I must know more about you, and about many another thing that is now confused and doubtful; but which will be open and clear before long. What should you know about her? why do you care to hear her name? You look as if you had been under hotter suns than ours. You can know nothing of a young creature who must have been born long after you had left this country."</p>
               <p>"I knew one very like her, any how," said the old man, fretfully; "but she brought nothing but disgrace and trouble on her family, and I don't see why I should trouble myself about her, after all. I'm not going to lose my natural rest any longer for all the young rascals and wandering lasses in Christendom."</p>
               <p>In a few minutes more the shivering and indignant Indian, who had no leisure to dwell on the discomforts of his midnight expedition, was once more on his way to the little carriage that waited for him, and which rapidly whirled him back to the warmth and light and repose of the comfortable apartments of the White Hart.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LIV.</head>
               <p>THE private justice room of Sir Gilbert Heathcote, the county magistrate, was unusually full, though the inquiry about to be prosecuted was understood to be private in its character. But great excitement had prevailed from the nature of the case, and several persons, more or less interested in the result, had obtained admission to the sanctum of Sir Gilbert. Most of them are already known to our readers, some few were strangers to the persons more immediately concerned, but drawn hither by powerful interest in the circumstances of the case, and friendship for some who had greater personal interest in the proceedings.</p>
               <p>Sir Gilbert occupied the large chair, that looked most judicial in its imposing size and consequence. Near him sat or stood Captain Grenville, Colonel Vaughan, Mr. Beaumont, Colonel Fleming, our naval friend, Captain Hawser, and the Earl of Hargrave. The clerk occupied his usual place near the magistrate, and a clear space was left on the other side of the table for the accused and his escort to be stationed.</p>
               <p>A brief pause preceded the exciting moment of their entrance, and a disinterested observer would have formed a tolerably correct idea of the feelings and interests of each of the persons we have mentioned, while waiting the commencement of the proceedings.</p>
               <p>Colonel Vaughan looked calm but grave, Lord Hargrave and Colonel Fleming anxious and agitated, Grenville pale but triumphant, and Mr. Beaumont cynically bitter in the fierce glare of his bright, keen eyes, and unpleasantly contemptuous mouth. Captain Hawser was quietly regarding the door, apparently feeling sincere but not overpowering interest in what was about to happen.</p>
               <p>At last steps were heard, the door opened, and Ronald of the Rath stood before the numerous eyes bent eagerly upon him. Calm, dignified, self-possessed in this imminent danger, his splendid dark eyes flashed rapidly round the circle with an inquiring glance that took in the whole group. Then it rested on Grenville with a quiet menace in its stern gaze, which the sneering, triumphant heir of Lord Hargrave could not support without flinching, though he tried to return it with haughty indifference and contempt. Mr. Beaumont fidgeted restlessly on his chair, as he looked on the young man placed in that critical and disgraceful position; and more than once he cast an anxious, perplexed look from Ronald to Captain Grenville, as if doubtful of the result, or of the conduct of the two whilome friends placed in such a curious juxtaposition to each other.</p>
               <p>The depositions were read. Reginald Saville was charged with having on the night of the fifth of September aided and arranged the escape of Gerard Carlton, formerly an ensign in His Majesty's—st regiment, when under sentence of death, and of knowingly and deliberately concealing the same, and despatching him beyond seas. "Also," as Sir Gilbert observed, "of aggravating if possible the impropriety of his conduct, by inducing and advising a generous and warm-hearted young lady to take imprudent and blameable steps in the said escape, actuated as she had been by feminine compassion for a fate which she fancied was partly owing to some rash quarrel in which her name had been mixed up."</p>
               <p>"I do not think it necessary," said Sir Gilbert, "to bring the young lady into the matter, as she evidently acted only under the advice and direction of a more experienced and culpable person. But of course the case will have to be clearly proved for me to commit a gentleman holding so highly respectable a position in society as Mr. Saville. Colonel Vaughan, may I trouble you to bring forward the evidence you have collected in this matter?"</p>
               <p>Colonel Vaughan rose, and after being sworn, proceeded to state the circumstances of Gerard Carlton's flight, with which we need not trouble our readers, who are already better acquainted than the worthy officer with the details of the affair under consideration. He gave his evidence with great forbearance and candor, touching with great delicacy on Mabel May's share in the matter, and evidently willing to give Ronald the full credit for kindly motives in the rash act he had committed.</p>
               <p>Other witnesses followed, who proved the facts of the escape, the connection with Mr. Saville, which had been traced by various links to the persons arranging and acting in Ensign Carlton's escape, and his landing from a ship, in which it was strongly suspected the fugitive had taken shelter. In short, so complete was the chain of evidence against the prisoner, that the faces of the magistrate and the three anxious friends of Ronald grew more and more grave as the case went on, and Grenville and Beaumont exchanged glances of triumphant meaning.</p>
               <p>Sir Gilbert had just commenced his final opinion on the evidence in an ominous and unctuous manner, when the door of the room opened, and the beautiful form of Mabel May appeared. She walked calmly and unhesitatingly forward, though her delicate face was suffused with a deep blush on meeting the eyes turned on her from all sides of the justice room. So completely was the whole party taken by <choice>
                     <sic>suprise</sic>
                     <corr>surprise</corr>
                  </choice>, that no one, or <emph>but</emph> one, perhaps, perceived that another person stole quietly in behind her, and took up his post in a remote corner of the room, where he was tolerably safe from observation.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Mabel advanced to the chair which Lord Hargrave occupied, as if seeking support and shelter from Gerard's uncle. The earl at once hastened to offer her his own seat, and stood behind the chair with an air of protecting kindness and approval that somewhat checked the rage which sparkled in every feature of Mabel's father and Frederick Grenville.</p>
               <p>"I have to apologise for my intrusion, Sir Gilbert," she said, in her soft, clear voice, "but it was a simple act of justice to this gentleman. I wish to state distinctly and openly that Mr. Saville had nothing to do with Ensign Carlton's escape, save that, at my earnest request he provided an asylum for him on leaving the prison. This was done at my earnest entreaty, an entreaty to which he was indeed almost bound to yield, in faithfulness to a pledge given by him in return for a service I was the accidental means of rendering him some time ago. If any punishment is awarded for the deed, it should fall on me, though I can scarcely feel culpable in having been accessory to the escape of an honorable and high-minded gentleman from a fate brought on him by deep-laid and unjust plots, far more deserving of punishment. But Mr. Saville is innocent of all, with the exception of keeping his solemn promise to myself."</p>
               <p>There was a dead silence when Mabel's words ceased to fall on the ears of her astonished auditors. The modesty and firmness, the noble self-devotion and perfect simplicity of her whole manner, so removed from either embarrassed consciousness or unfeminine boldness, went straight to the hearts of some of the listeners, and Ronald's fine face became really noble with grateful admiration and deep feeling, which elevated its expression far above the cynical hardness of former days.</p>
               <p>Lionel Beaumont had been only restrained by a look from Sir Gilbert Heathcote, and a warning pressure of the foot, which Grenville contrived to give unobserved, from starting to his daughter's side and imperiously commanding her to leave the room. His face was scarlet with suppressed rage, and his fierce eyes blazed furiously, as he turned from one to the other of the auditors, and perceived the impression his daughter's unexpected statement had made. Frederick Grenville saw it too; but his pale face was unmoved and quiet, unless, indeed, the sarcastic curve of the compressed lips, and a slight quiver of the nostril, could be termed an evidence of the strife within. He was in no hurry to disturb the silence which had followed Mabel's revelation. The hesitation and perplexity of the magistrate, the satisfied, hopeful looks of the other witnesses to the scene, and Ronald's bright, triumphant satisfaction, appeared rather to gratify him. The bloodhound is never so dangerous as when he is most gentle and bland in his meek look and caresses. At length he rose, and addressed the magistrate.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry," said he calmly, "to disturb so pleasant a delusion as the present party appear to be inclined to indulge; but it is a painful duty, when the safety of society and the name of a charming but too disinterested and warm-hearted a young lady is in question. The sacrifice she has so nobly made of her feminine reserve and her own safety is unluckily in vain. The individual who has been the fortunate object of so much undeserved interest and exertion is totally unworthy of it, and will not profit by the sacrifice it has cost. The self-styled Reginald Saville, the chivalrous agent of the noble-born heiress, the sympathising abettor of an insolent, unprincipled, base-born upstart, is no other than one of a celebrated gang of smugglers in the county of Carlow, and is known by the more appropriate name of Ronald of the Rath. Sir Gilbert, I claim from you, in the name of the law, the instant committal of this hardened brigand and swindler."</p>
               <p>Ronald did not change a muscle as Grenville spoke, but Mabel gave a faint suppressed cry, and Lord Hargrave's noble face wore an expression of deep chagrin. Colonel Vaughan and Captain Hawser looked astonished and deeply interested in the turn the scene was<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6520-00000099"/> taking; but Lionel <choice>
                     <sic>Beaumout</sic>
                     <corr>Beaumont</corr>
                  </choice> gave an irrepressible exclamation of resentful and malicious joy at the effectual defeat of an escape for the doomed and discovered brigand. Sir Gilbert was the first to speak.</p>
               <p>"I am really grieved and astonished at the whole scene we have just witnessed," said the magistrate. "It is most painful, of course, to Miss May and her father, that she should have been thus publicly and uselessly brought forward, and as some of the gentlemen here have manifested a truly unselfish sympathy for an apparently chivalrous and kindly spirit, I am sorry that the person who has excited it should be so degraded and hardened in crime. Of course, Captain Grenville, if you can bring forward proof of what you have just asserted, I can have but one course to pursue."</p>
               <p>"If you will remand him on the charge which is already proved against him, Sir Gilbert, I pledge myself, on my honor as a soldier and a gentleman, to bring ample evidence that this fellow is the person I state; and also that this is but one of many of the numerous deeds of crime that he has committed. And, if I mistake not, Mr. Beaumont could assist me in the identification, as he himself suffered from his foul play in London in this very Spring."</p>
               <p>"I can, I can!" exclaimed Beaumont, eagerly. "Sir Gilbert, I demand the instant committal of this scoundrel, and I trust an active pursuit will be made for his confederate, though he has escaped us for the present."</p>
               <p>"Sir Gilbert, I will give bail to any amount," interposed Colonel Fleming, eagerly. "I am an officer of thirty years' standing; my interest, my—"</p>
               <p>"If you were the commander-in-chief, sir, I should protest against such a perversion of justice," exclaimed Beaumont. "I should make it my duty to lay a complaint before the Government, if you, Sir Gilbert, are tempted to be so wanting in your duty. I insist on the committal of that dangerous, hardened pest to society."</p>
               <p>"In the person of your own son, Lionel Beaumont," said a deep, loud voice.</p>
               <p>They started, as if a galvanic battery had played on the whole party, and as the powerful form of James Bryant walked firmly up to the table, it drew all eyes fixedly on it from all parts of the room. Lord Hargrave was the first to recover his breath, which had been fairly suspended by the shock.</p>
               <p>"My friend," he said, "this is a strange assertion. Are you fully aware of the risk you run in bringing a false accusation or misrepresenting relationship in so gross a manner? It appears incredible, monstrous, that such a charge can be substantiated."</p>
               <p>Bryant laughed, but not disrespectfully.</p>
               <p>"There is risk," said he; "and it is monstrous, my lord; but the risk is to others, not to me; and the unnatural father who has labored so hard to bring his own son to 'justice,' as he calls it, is the man to be called 'monstrous.' Bad as I am, that's more than I would dare to do."</p>
               <p>There was a general thrill of horror and curiosity through the whole party. Mabel clung for support to her father's chair, to whom she had, with true woman's instinct, sprung on the first hint of danger and shame. Grenville stood paralysed and bewildered at the turn affairs had taken. And Lionel Beaumont, the guilty, the terror not conscience-stricken, sat pale, livid, motionless, gazing at Bryant, in mute and gasping anticipation of what was to follow, and yet dreading the revelation which he could neither avert by threats, nor silence by bribes.</p>
               <p>"My lord," resumed Bryant, addressing Lord Hargrave, "my story concerns you as well as that worthy gentleman yonder, not forgetting that pleasant-looking young gentleman who seems so friendly to his old comrades. But it will be rather a long one. Would your honorable company here like to hear it, or shall I wait for another opportunity?"</p>
               <p>"No, no," said Sir Gilbert, hastily; "whatever may bear on this case must be brought out in this court, before myself and those gentlemen immediately concerned in the affair. Take a chair, my man, and tell your tale as briefly as you can. We don't want to pry into private matters, but merely to bring out the truth."</p>
               <p>"I must just tell it my own way," said Bryant, coolly, throwing himself into a chair near him; "and it will be as well to take care that no one goes out nor comes in while I am relating it. I don't care for more audience than I've got, but those that hear the beginning must also hear the end of the story."</p>
               <p>Sir Gilbert gave a nod to the officer in attendance, who at once placed himself near the door, and turned the key. Bryant coughed once or twice, and then began.</p>
               <p>"To begin at the beginning, gentlemen, I must tell you that I have always been a wanderer, and associated with characters that are not called over and above respectable. About twenty years ago I was living in Devonshire, close by Taunton, doing a little business in the smuggling line, but all in a respectful, regular way. One fine evening, as I was lounging about on the sands, looking about for stray bits of news that come in useful in that line of business, I was accosted by a decent looking middle-aged woman, very well dressed for her station, which I took to be a housekeeper, or nurse, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>"'I am told,' said she, 'that you are an active, enterprising man, always ready to do a stroke of business that will bring in an adequate return, and not over-fastidious as to its nature, provided there's no real harm to life or limb for yourself, or any one else."</p>
               <p>"'That's just the point,' I said, carelessly; 'I'm not quite so black as I'm painted, maybe. I've a conscience, and some sort of character still left, and I advise you, my good woman, to hold your tongue, if there's anything in the wind that an honest man oughtn't to touch.'</p>
               <p>"She laughed, and said, 'That's according to fancy. I can only tell you, what I want done will bring a deal of good to more than one besides yourself; and what's more, will hurt no one to their knowledge; and if you won't undertake it. I must go to some one that is less nice and more wise.'</p>
               <p>"'Don't be in a hurry,' said I; 'this is hardly the place to talk secrets in, but if you'll come home with me, we'll see what can be done.'</p>
               <p>"'No,' said she, 'come to the place I'm staying at; it's nearer, and will be less likely to be observed.'</p>
               <p>"I followed her to the cottage about two hundred yards from the beach; it's still standing, my lord, as Mr. Carlton can testify, and then the business came out. She wanted me to procure for her a male infant, newly born, for which I should receive a hundred guineas as a reward. She stated that the child would be brought up in luxury and wealth, and be a fortunate little fellow to have had such a lucky theft made ere he was conscious of it, and that it would be instantly conveyed away out of all chance of discovery.</p>
               <p>"I hesitated a bit, for, to say truth, I did not quite like the business; but a hundred guineas was not to be picked up every day, and there did not appear any real harm in the affair. But after I had consented, and time and place and all particulars had been arranged, I found my task more difficult than had been supposed. I kept a sharp look-out for all the nurses and babies I could see in my constant wanderings, but all were either too wary, too old, or too wretched-looking for my purpose. At last, when I was almost inclined to give up the matter in despair, fortune befriended me. I encountered one afternoon a nurse with a lovely new-born infant, which I found, on inquiry, belonged to a Captain Morrison."</p>
               <p>Lord Hargrave started and grasped his chair for support at the words, but Bryant signed him impatiently to remain silent and went calmly on.</p>
               <p>"I found it no difficult task to get a woman with whom I then lived to decoy the nurse into a house, and tempt her to take some strong drink, till she was quite stupefied.</p>
               <p>"The woman hastened to inform me of the success of our plan, and exhibited the infant with pride to me in the place where we had arranged to meet after the abduction. Nothing could be more promising in appearance than our prize. The babe was a fine, beautiful little fellow, looking every inch a gentleman's child, and fit for any future that might await it. I even thought of demanding an increased reward for so complete an execution of my commission, when a terrible discovery was made. My wife (so to speak) was just looking at the little fellow's pretty golden hair, when she suddenly discovered a most extraordinary mark, in the shape of an acorn, which would of course identify the child, and criminate us, at any future time. She earnestly implored me not on any account to keep the child, as of course a strict search would be made for it, and I might even be overtaken by Captain Morrison's servants while conveying it to its destination. I agreed with her; but how could I either return this child to its home, or find another to replace it in the short space of time that yet remained to me for the search?</p>
               <p>"In this dilemma a cousin of my wife's, who was living with us, and in all our secrets, came to our aid. He informed us that another child had just been born and put out to nurse in the neighborhood, and that probably the nurse would be easily bribed to change her own little charge for Captain Morrison's infant. I found that the babe had been sent away from its mother within an hour of its birth, and therefore there would be little fear either of its recognition, or of any danger in its abduction. The mark on my little nurseling's neck would scarcely excite suspicion under such circumstances, and a plan at once struck me for extricating myself from my difficulties.</p>
               <p>"I repaired at once to the nurse's cottage, intending to offer a handsome bribe, if she would consent to an exchange of infants; but I was spared the trouble of the attempt, for the woman was absent, and only a little girl was watching the cradle of the sleeping infant. I told the child that her grandmother wanted her at the bottom of the lane; and while she was gone, I easily effected the exchange of infants.</p>
               <p>"Securely triumphant, I quitted the cottage with Mrs. Stephenson's child, leaving Captain Morrison's in its stead, and at once hastened to my lonely habitation to await the result, fearless of any chance of detection.</p>
               <p>"I had scarcely consigned the babe to my wife's care, when the persons engaged in search of the child burst in upon us. Of course I gave them every chance of examining the infant that we had in our possession, and sent them off, disappointed and baffled. So far all was well; but my turn was to come. I kept my appointment at midnight with the person who had employed me in the crooked business, hoping to get my hundred guineas, and praises to boot. Yes, Lionel Beaumont, you were very nearly receiving your own natural son to bring up and endow as your lawful heir. And now, for the first time, I learnt the whole plot and its disappointment.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Beaumont—he will excuse my relating to you what he already knows so well, as<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6520-00000100"/> it is necessary to trouble him with listening to the story—Mr. Beaumont. I say, had married the daughter of the Earl of Hargrave, much to that nobleman's vexation. But be had promised to forgive and receive the couple, if Mrs. Beaumont should bring a male heir to the title and estates, which were settled on the son of a daughter in direct descent; but failing the birth of such a son, would pass to a distant relative. Of course, it was a terrible anxiety to the ambitious son-in-law to secure this prize, and he had determined to make sure by having a boy ready, in case a girl should make her appearance when the lady was confined. The device was a good one enough, and might have succeeded but for the over zeal of two maiden aunts of the lady, who insisted on being present when the baby was born. Of course, any deception was impossible; and when a daughter—who, I take it, is that young lady there—was born, her father's schemes and hopes were at an end, since her mother died almost directly. There was I, left with my child, as well as the hundred guineas, which I took good care to insist on having; and as I had no better means of getting rid of him I concluded on bringing him up myself—and a fine, spirited young fellow he has turned out as any father can wish to see. There, Ronald, go to your father, and ask his blessing—it's worth having, ain't it?"</p>
               <p>Ronald's face had flushed and paled during his reputed father's recital, with contending feelings, at a revelation altogether new and unexpected to him. Much of Gerard's history had been discovered by the youthful brigand of the Rath; but of his own he had remained in comparative ignorance; and though such a career as his might have seemed one to extinguish all sense of shame or degradation, yet the circumstances of his birth were deeply mortifying, the parent he had discovered most hatefully contemptible in his eyes. Lord Hargrave's hands were clasped in deep and silent thankfulness as Bryant concluded.</p>
               <p>"Heaven be thanked!" he murmured. "My son, my noble son! it was Nature's instinct that moved me towards him—my Ellen's child, my precious wife's sole bequest."</p>
               <p>"I thank you, my lord," interrupted Grenville, coolly; "but I am not going to give up my position on such an unlikely story, told by a scoundrel like this. Unless there are unquestionable proofs of its truth, I warn you I will resist it, to the very death."</p>
               <p>"I doubt it not, I doubt it not, young springald," said Bryant, bitterly; "but you'd better keep a civiller tongue in your head, or your noble uncle and cousin may not let you go soot free, as I'm afraid they'll be fools enough to do. Proofs—oh yes, you shall have enough proofs. There's the testimony of the nurse who attended Mrs. Stephenson as to the infant being born without a mark from head to foot, and having dark eyes; whereas, Mr.—I should say. Lord Gerard's are blue as the sky; and Lord Hargrave can testify to the acorn's mark on his son's neck, which will be found on the young nobleman's throat, when he returns to claim his own."</p>
               <p>"But," interrupted Colonel Vaughan, "how do you turn Mrs. Stephenson into Mrs. Carlton?"</p>
               <p>"Well, sir," replied Bryant, "I did not know it myself till a short time since, when the young gentleman came across me by accident. But I've made it all out since, and it seems that she came to a brother's, Mr. James Fleming, in Ireland, and took another name; and then, when he died, she went to live at Athy, near where I happened to be, at intervals, for some years past."</p>
               <p>"Athy—Fleming!" murmured Captain Hawser—"why, surely those were the names poor Cootes used to speak of, but—"</p>
               <p>A deep groan from Lionel Beaumont suddenly broke on the silence which had succeeded Bryant's last words. Mabel tremblingly gazed at the pale face that lay rigid and motionless on the back of the chair by which she had supported herself during the thrilling story which had brought her such sorrow and such joy. A faint shriek escaped her. There was no mistaking that rigid, set, grey face. Lionel Beaumont had gone to his account before his Maker at the instant of exposure of his crimes before his fellow-men. Ronald, by an impulse of nature that even those crimes could not repress, sprang to his father's side just in time to receive the fainting form of his sister Mabel in his arms.</p>
               <p>The horror and confusion that for some moments paralysed the party, at last yielded to the necessity for prompt and immediate action. The first object of all present was of course the unhappy and insensible daughter of an unworthy, but still only parent, whom Ronald, who would not yield his precious burden to any one else, had hastily borne into another room, and laid on a large couch, which had fortunately been placed there, on the unexpected arrival of the prisoner and his guards.</p>
               <p>"Leave her here, boy, leave her here," said Bryant, in a rough, but kindly tone. "There are those who will see to her lovingly, and of her own sex, too; and it will, be better, when she wakes up, not to see any one that will remind her of what has happened. He's a precious scoundrel, certainly, and well out of the world; but I don't suppose she can think so, just yet a bit."</p>
               <p>"And you're wanted in the next room, young sir," observed the officer who had followed the prisoner, while the rest of the group had remained transfixed with horror, or been occupied with vain attempts to reanimate the lifeless form of the wretched Lionel.</p>
               <p>"I can't lose sight of you without orders, and I don't see that what's happened clears you at present."</p>
               <p>Ronald gave a quick, scornful look at the man, but he was too proud to contend with one so far below him, and he walked rapidly back to the justice-room. His re-entrance was almost unnoticed by the group, and he quietly took his station by the table, sternly watching the futile efforts to recall his father to life, without attempting to move limb or muscle during the operation. His features were strangely fixed and pallid, and yet there was a lofty, composed expression in the dark eyes and quietly compressed mouth that spoke of long-warring passions, and doubts, and struggles, set at rest, and a resolution formed to bear and to vanquish all that might be in store of pain and humiliation. At last the arrival of a medical man, hastily summoned on the first alarm of Mr. Beaumont's illness, set the question of life or death for ever at rest.</p>
               <p>"Not a shadow of hope, not a single spark of life in the whole frame," was his verdict. "A college of physicians could not restore him."</p>
               <p>Sir Gilbert Heathcote gave orders to the officers in attendance, while the rest of the party were busy with the unfortunate deceased, and one of the men whom he had despatched some minutes before, now entered to announce that the carriage that had brought Miss May an hour before, was in readiness to convey the body of its master to his own dwelling. Lord Hargrave, who had been at once the most active and most judicious in trying all the possible remedies for the unfortunate man, now turned to Ronald, with a look of kind and even approving sympathy.</p>
               <p>"This is a sad catastrophe for you, my young friend, to lose a parent at the very moment of finding him. But—"</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, my lord," said Ronald, sternly. "I lost my only parent without the happiness of knowing the care and love she would have bestowed on me; I recognise no relationship to the man who ruined my mother's fame and peace—left her to pine and wither in shame, and bequeathed to his son only a disgraced name. His crimes do not even die with him; they stained my boyish nature, steeped my youth in infamy, and now the only good deed that has redeemed the past will consign me to the hangman."</p>
               <p>"Not so, not so, young man," said the earl, much affected; "the preserver of my son's life, the brother of Mabel, shall not suffer for his courage and devotion. The whole truth shall be laid before the proper quarters, and my utmost influence used as well for you as for Gerard, and I doubt not the result. Meanwhile, Sir Gilbert, you will not refuse my bail for this young man's appearance on a future examination."</p>
               <p>"And mine," broke in Colonel Fleming. "Why, the lad's my nephew, poor Agatha's child, and though he is the son of that double-dyed villain, I'll do more for him than I would have done for t'other young chap. No offence, my lord, but blood's blood, and my heart warmed to this young fellow the moment I saw him; at least, not exactly the first either, for that was in the water, and too cold for any warmth to be in the matter, But you'll let him go with me, Sir Gilbert?"</p>
               <p>"Well, it's a little out of rule," replied the magistrate; "but under all the extraordinary circumstances of the affair, I suppose I should hardly exceed my duty in accepting such undoubted bail for the prisoner. Make out the necessary forms, Mr. Bolton," he said turning to the clerk.</p>
               <p>The formalities were quickly gone through, and then the colonel, with Captain Hawser and Ronald prepared to leave the room.</p>
               <p>"Dine with us this evening, my lord," said the colonel, as he shook hands with the earl, "and this hopeful nephew of mine will be able to tell you more about your son, who, somehow, I never fancied belonged to me, though he said he was Agatha's child, and it wasn't such a proud thing for a young fellow to claim it, if he wasn't what he professed."</p>
               <p>The earl half-smiled at the evidently bewildered state of the worthy old Indian's comprehension of the rapid and perplexing changes the last hour had wrought, and promised to be with him at the hour he named. Then he turned to the still scowling and livid face of his nephew.</p>
               <p>"Frederick," he said, half mournfully, "you are I confess, hurled suddenly from supposed rank and fortune, and all that I fear is most valued by you, to comparative adversity. I only trust the change may bring you to better feelings and nobler aims than you have yet known, and then you need not regret the loss you have sustained. What I can do to save you, in spite of the past, I will gladly attempt."</p>
               <p>"You must first prove that I am not entitled to it," was the scornful reply. "Time enough then for your advice, when you are able to show that it is not my right. I congratulate you on your supposed discovery of a disgraced Custom House clerk—a condemned and cashiered felon—for your son."</p>
               <p>"Liar! perjured plotter!" exclaimed Ronald, whose steps had been arrested by the words. "Do you forget that I—ay, and another almost equally injured with your noble cousin—know all; know that you recognised Gerard Carlton almost from the first as your uncle's son—how you dragged him into ruin—drove him to desperation by your cowardly insults before the woman he loved better than life. My lord, you know not half the vile plottings—the black, selfish nature of this counterfeit heir of your fortune and name."</p>
               <p>"But there are those that can enlighten him, and your credulous old fool of an uncle, as to your past doings, you base born—"</p>
               <p>"Peace, silence, Frederick Grenville!"<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6520-00000101"/> thundered the earl, now exasperated beyond patience. "Leave the room, sir, if you would not have me discard you for ever from my very memory as one of my own blood. Go, sir, this instant, and at your peril seek this young man again."</p>
               <p>Grenville haughtily obeyed, conscious of the utter ruin that awaited him, should his uncle's threat be carried out. Ronald still lingered.</p>
               <p>"I would fain hear of Mabel," he said, hesitatingly, "before I go."</p>
               <p>"Leave her to me, young man," said the earl-kindly. "Remember she is now to me as a daughter, and shall have the care and tending of one."</p>
               <p>"She is in good hands, Ronald," said Bryant. "My lord," he added, turning to Lord Hargrave, "if I am not too bold, I would like a word with you on a matter that even this foster-son of mine knows nothing of at present; ay, and bring one to your knowledge who will not, I think, appeal to your kindness and help in vain."</p>
               <p>Ronald took the hint, and accompanied his new-found uncle from the room. As they walked through the passage a door opened and suddenly closed again. Colonel Fleming started.</p>
               <p>"What is it, colonel?" asked Captain Hawser.</p>
               <p>"Oh, nothing, nothing," he replied. My brain's turned, I believe, by all this whirl, and deaths, and coming to life again. I keep fancying I see faces, dead long since. It was only some girl waiting on Miss May, I expect; but—and it's not the first time I've seen her either."</p>
               <p>Colonel Fleming was right The girl, gently, lovingly tending Mabel May, was the same young creature he had seen for an instant in the cottage of Janet Morris, in his midnight visit to that lonely spot.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER LV.</head>
               <p>IT was the morning of the wedding-day of Mr. Guildford and Mrs. Rivers. A goodly party was assembled in expectation of the event, and of a calibre worthy of the concerned persons in it. Mr. Styles, one or two of the boon companions of the Justice, and a distant relation of the bride, were at Garron's Hill, and the curate of Carlow was especially invited to perform the ceremony. Mrs. Rivers was bland, sweet, and dignified, exquisitely draped in a sort of becoming half-mourning, in honor of her beloved daughter, of whose fate no tidings had as yet been received, and who, Guildford but too surely suspected, had found a grave at the bottom of the deep waters of the cave of Dunmore.</p>
               <p>The Justice himself was sorely changed since we last presented him to our readers. There were traces of inward agony and remorse in his haggard features and dark, down-cast eyes; his overbearing, insolent manner was now changed for a nervous, anxious, uncertain demeanor, which, though not more gentle, nor more agreeable to his companions and dependants, yet told of the powerful passions and terrors which were working within. He had submitted quietly, sullenly, to all the arrangements made by his bride elect, and her now great friend and ally, Mr. Styles. Garron's Hill had been settled on her, and their children and heirs at his death, and the price of the concession was—her solemn and written engagement never to permit him to be disturbed in its possession by the pretensions of any more lawful pretender to the estate, for which he had sinned and suffered so much.</p>
               <p>And now the dreaded hour was come, and Guildford's day of power and liberty was drawing to a close. The party were assembled in the handsome drawing-room of Garron's Hill, where the ceremony was to be performed by special licence, at the especial request of the bride. All had assembled save the bride, and she was now summoned to take her part in the memorable and important event, for which she had worked and striven so hard, so unscrupulously.</p>
               <p>At length she entered, that mature but splendid-looking bride, dressed in the rich grey poplin, the foreign lace, the gorgeous India shawl, that suited so well her fine but somewhat too developed figure. Her face was radiant with smiles and gracious looks for all around; her grace, her queenly bearing, her well-preserved beauty, would have won admiration in a far more extensive and brilliant circle than those assembled in that remote spot. But the all-condescending, well-pleased lady did not deem the humble friends or the occasion unworthy of her exertions, nor of the display of her utmost charms, and even Styles could not but confess that the unattractive Justice had no such bad bargain after all, in winning so attractive a bride. They were indeed a strange contrast as they stood at the temporary altar, where the clergyman was waiting to perform the marriage service.</p>
               <p>Guildford, never prepossessing, was now absolutely repelling, with the sallow, haggard cheeks, the sunken eye, the deeply-lined brow and mouth, which made him look at least ten years older than his bride. His lips were closely set, but a convulsive quiver would agitate them at times; and his deep-set, restless eyes looked furtively round, as if seeking for escape, or dreading some sudden foe. But all seemed gaiety and undisturbed expectation, in the faces of all besides, and the unlucky man, after one irrepressible scowl, as he caught the lawyer's half-concealed sneer, seemed to resign himself to his fate.</p>
               <p>The service began, the sonorous voice of the clergyman silenced all whispering murmurs among his audience, and even the most giddy were awed into some decorum by the solemn words he uttered. The exhortation was over, the question put to the haggard looking bridegroom that would decide his fate; the irrevocable words were trembling on his lips, but they were doomed never to be spoken.</p>
               <p>The apartment was in a part of the house remote from the carriage-drive which led up to it, and the party assembled in it were too much engrossed to hear the noise of carriage wheels, and the loud peal of the door-bell which had heralded their approach. Nor had the confused, though quiet patter of feet, that told of a considerable addition to their number, excited their notice, or, if observed, it was probably attributed to the curious presence of the servants of the house.</p>
               <p>The door opened, and several persons entered, the foremost of whom were Lord Hargrave, <choice>
                     <sic>Byrant</sic>
                     <corr>Bryant</corr>
                  </choice>, and Captain Hawser. The others kept carefully in the back-ground, concealed from view by the half-opened door and by the forms of the more prominent persons among the newly arrived guests.</p>
               <p>"I must apologise for my intrusion at such a moment," said Lord Hargrave, with half ironical courtesy, "but my errand will probably plead its excuse. It appears to me desirable that parties contracting so solemn a ceremony as the one which is about to be performed in this apartment, should thoroughly understand each other's position and rights; and as I fancy there are considerable mistakes on these points in the present instance, I have made a point of hastening hither, to clear up all that is doubtful and mysterious in these respects. Mr. Guildford, you are probably not altogether in the dark as to my meaning," he added, turning to the panic-struck Justice.</p>
               <p>"I—I—you—that is—this extraordinary conduct," stammered Guildford. "Who are you that dares to interfere in my affairs, sir? I am a justice of the peace for this county, and not to be trifled with."</p>
               <p>"As regards the first question, I am the Earl of Hargrave, Mr. Guildford, though that has little to do with our present business; with respect to the second question, I recommend you to sink in oblivion a fact which only aggravates your guilt and disgrace. Mrs. Rivers, as I presume this lady styles herself, will perhaps be inclined to relinquish her claim on you when she understands that your tenure of Garron's Hill is at an end, and that, should she marry you, she will only join her own ruined fortunes to those of a guilty and dishonored man; and you, sir, will do well to purchase exemption from the punishment you deserve by at once yielding your usurped, forged claims to this property without further delay to the rightful heir."</p>
               <p>"Liar! scoundrel!" roared Guildford, exasperated beyond self-control by the desperation of the sudden change; "I tell you there is no lawful heir. I am the legatee by Mr. Garron's last will, and the only one that—"</p>
               <p>"Stop, sir, stop," said Lord Hargrave, impressively. "Do not sin past indulgence by such barefaced and impudent lies. There are witnesses to the last will and testament of Mr. Michael Garron, made some years before his death; but which can be clearly proved to be his only legal one, and which declares all others to be null and void so long as that shall remain in existence. It would appear that the deceased gentleman had some impression of the fraud that might be attempted, and took this precaution accordingly. By this will Garron's Hill, and the whole property, real and personal, is bequeathed to James Fleming, his heirs and assigns, and consequently belongs to the issue of that gentleman's sister, Mrs. Stephenson, who was his sole heiress and legatee."</p>
               <p>"Lawful heirs! lawful heirs!" exclaimed Guildford, fiercely; "there are none—none lawfully begotten."</p>
               <p>"Peace, scoundrel!" said Bryant, suddenly coming forward. "I tell you you are completely done for, Master Justice; and the best thing you can do is to take yourself off, and your intended wife with you, if she likes to hang on."</p>
               <p>"Thief! robber! murderer!" thundered Guildford; "you shall swing for this; and that rascal Ronald, who—"</p>
               <p>"Is the son of Mrs. Stephenson, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">alias</foreign> Mrs. Carlton, and nephew to the <choice>
                     <sic>orignal</sic>
                     <corr>original</corr>
                  </choice> heir of Garron's Hill," observed Bryant, coolly. "Keep a civil tongue in your head, Justice, or it may be the worse for you."</p>
               <p>Guildford started, and said eagerly, "But not lawful, not lawful. She had no child by her lawful husband. I knew it, I knew it; and you, villain, proved it to me years ago."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me," interposed Lord Hargrave. "There is still living the only and lawful child of the late Mr. Stephenson and Agatha Fleming, who is therefore the sole and rightful heiress of Garron's Hill. And, if I mistake not, that lady" (pointing to Mrs. Rivers) "can satisfy you as to that fact better than any one else. Miss Adeline Stephenson, will you kindly confirm the fact of your having survived the scandalous attempt on your life, thanks to the courage and noble disregard of personal danger displayed by one who has also been mourned as dead?"</p>
               <p>The little group opened, and Adeline Rivers, pale and agitated, but with a light of happiness and pride in her beautiful eyes, and an unconscious, confiding clinging to the arm that supported her, was led forward by Ronald and William Adams.</p>
               <p>The effect was galvanic. Mrs. Rivers rushed from the room, without waiting for one word of explanation as to the sudden apparition. Styles stared, open-mouthed<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6520-00000102"/> and bewildered, at the beautiful girl, and her handsome supporter; while Guildford literally staggered to a chair, and groaned out an involuntary—"Thank God they are alive! I have not their blood on my head."</p>
               <p>The earl's face softened, and he said—"Mr. Guildford, you have deeply sinned, and the punishment for your crimes will be long and bitter; but it is no wish of mine or of this young lady to crush a fallen, though guilty man, more completely than is inevitable in order to do justice. The terrible fate which she escaped was, I believe, intended for another, and you have cause to thank God that both have, by a most remarkable and providential chance, been saved, and that you are innocent, save in intention, of the death of a helpless woman; and, as to the rest, I can soon satisfy you of the irresistible evidence that can be brought as to her identity and claim on the property you have usurped so long. Miss Adeline Stephenson, hitherto known as Adeline Rivers, was the only child of the late Mr. Stephenson and his wife. Owing to painful circumstances, which do not hear on the case, that gentleman removed the child from his wife's care and custody, and placed her with the person you were about to make your wife, with ample provision for her support. His early and sudden death appears to have tempted Mrs. Rivers to appropriate the money intended for the orphan, and to bring her up as her own daughter; and but for your wicked scheme on the life of a dangerous witness to your own frailty, this deception might never have been discovered. And now, sir, are you disposed to give up at once, quietly, your usurped possession here, on condition of oblivion of the past, or will you risk the exposure of your crimes, and the punishment they will inevitably receive?"</p>
               <p>Guildford was like a caged tiger, fierce, impotent, despairing. He looked from Lord Hargrave to the crestfallen Styles; from him to Bryant; and again to Ronald; all were helpless, or unwilling to aid. Lord Hargrave stood, calm and determined, with the air of a man who will not be shaken by threats or entreaties, and who knows and feels his cause to be just and safe. Not a gleam of hope could the wretched, guilty man discern in any quarter; only one consolation awaited him.</p>
               <p>"I've no alternative, I suppose," he said, sullenly; "there is a conspiracy against me, but I'll not fall alone. That murdering ruffian there shall not go scot-free. He's within the grasp of the hangman ten times over, and the gallows shall not be cheated, if there is justice in the land.</p>
               <p>"Justice!" exclaimed Bryant; "villain, do you dare to speak of justice, and do you really think I have coolly put my neck in your rascally power? I'm safe, ay, and prosperous, thanks to my good lord here. The king (God bless him!) has pardoned a freebooter, and got a soldier instead. I shall wear his majesty's uniform instead of yours, Master Guildford, and he shan't be the loser for his clemency."</p>
               <p>Guildford glanced around, but nothing but triumphant or crestfallen faces met his view. All was lost; his guilty career was at an end. Friends, fortune, character, were irretrievably gone; and the lowest of menials was far more to be envied than the guilty, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ci-devant</foreign> master of Garron's Hill.</p>
               <p>A moment's pause, a groan, a sudden fall, and Andrew Guildford lay on the floor, blood issuing from his nose and mouth in a thick, dark stream. His plotting, busy brain had given way; a blood-vessel had burst, and in an hour's time the sole remains of the unscrupulous usurper of Garron's Hill lay in a remote room, an unlamented corpse.</p>
               <p>"And now, my lord," said William Adams to Lord Hargrave, when the party had somewhat recovered from the excitement of the painful scene, and assembled in the very library which had witnessed so many of the wretched Guildford's guilty plottings, "I feel I must no longer delay relieving my poor father's mind as to my fate. I presume that the interdict to my making my existence known to him is now no longer enforced?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly not, my young friend," replied the earl, kindly; "and it was only my conviction of the necessity of the most perfect secrecy as to the blow hanging over that unhappy man, that induced me to conceal so long from Mr. Adams the fact of his son's safety. But you must not leave us in this happy moment, when the fair heiress is at last reinstated in her rights—thanks to your gallant conduct. I have already dispatched a messenger to Bally Adams, and expect his return in less than an hour. I should not be much astonished if he brought some guests with him."</p>
               <p>Lord Hargrave was becoming perfectly radiant and youthful in his looks and manner, since the discovery which had brought him so much happiness. The time which had elapsed since the day of Ronald's trial had been fully and successfully occupied by him, and thus the tedious delay in the only thing wanting to his perfect felicity—the return of his beloved son from his exile—was rendered more bearable.</p>
               <p>The earl's first care had of course been to use every influence to obtain the free pardon of the persons so deeply implicated in the tangled and curious plots and schemes already detailed in the progress of our tale. For Gerard, he had little difficulty in obtaining the grace he sought. The circumstances of the case, when laid before the commander-in-chief, and through him before the sovereign, alone pleaded for the remission of the sentence, and when backed by the interest of so powerful a nobleman, there was little hesitation in removing the sentence, with the nominal punishment of a dismissal from the Service. But there were far greater obstacles in the way of the royal clemency being extended to Bryant and Ronald, and it was perhaps owing more to the pressing need of soldiers, rather than to Lord Hargrave's earnest intercession, that Bryant obtained permission to enter into the king's service.</p>
               <p>Against Ronald no positive proof could be brought of any open and personal acts of violence, and of course the pardon extended to Gerard naturally implied complete amnesty to all concerned in his escape from the fate which had so nearly befallen him. Colonel Fleming's services in India, combined with Lord Hargrave's urgent entreaties in his favor were therefore permitted to cover the doubts and suspicions that hung over the past history of the youthful brigand of the Rath, though a very intelligible hint was given that it might be as well for the young man to try the effect of other air than the British isles could afford till the whole affair had blown over, and been forgotten in more recent and engrossing topics. And in addition to these anxious and important matters, Lord Hargrave had also had ample employment in making all necessary arrangements for the comfort and welfare of his young relative, Mabel May.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beaumont like many men of his selfish and worldly temperament, had always shrunk from making a will, and his sudden and unprepared death had consequently left all his large, and perhaps ill-gotten wealth, without restriction to Mabel.</p>
               <p>Lord Hargrave had found little difficulty in carrying out the orphan's wishes with respect to her present residence and personal comfort; but the arrangement of so large a property thus suddenly left to one perfectly unacquainted with its nature or disposal, was no easy task, and the earl had been compelled to delegate to others much of the more technical part of the business. There was besides another orphan, fair and unprotected, and far more friendless than Mabel May, whose interests had demanded his attention, and the successful result of his investigation into the past history of Adeline will be inferred from the scene just described.</p>
               <p>And now these varied and anxious negotiations had been brought to a close, and the earl, with the little group who had accompanied him to Garron's Hill were waiting only the more pleasant and exciting <foreign xml:lang="FRA">dénoument</foreign> of the painful scene just enacted, in the restoration of a long-mourned son and brother to his sorrowing relatives. With delicate consideration for the feelings of those more immediately concerned, Lord Hargrave had suggested that William Adams and Adeline should remain in the library to await the arrival of the expected guests, while he and the rest of the party should adjourn to the drawing-room till the meeting was over between the relatives. Perhaps the earl had a sufficiently vivid remembrance of the days of his youth to guess that such an arrangement might not be disagreeable to the two young people; and yet, for some minutes after it had been carried into effect, William Adams remained in complete, and as it appeared, moody silence. He stood near the window, gazing on the very spot where Bryant had so often appeared to the expectant, or reluctant Justice—his eyes bent, as it seemed, on vacancy, and his brow contracted as in some sudden pain.</p>
               <p>A changed and really handsome, high-bred looking fellow was William Adams, as he stood there with Adeline's inquiring eyes fixed on him, very different from the rustic, unpolished suitor of Mabel May, a few short months before. William's figure and face had always been physically handsome, and were therefore quickly susceptible of the polish and charm which cultivated intellect and intercourse with the world alone could give it; and the work, which his love for Mabel May had first begun, had been fostered and carried forward by circumstances with a rapidity all but magical; it was indeed a milder repetition of <hi rend="i"/>The Deformed Transformed.</p>
               <p>Adeline was not aware of this rapid change; she only saw William Adams as he was, knew him as he had always appeared to her; and she was surprised and disturbed at the deep gloom which appeared to have come over him so unlike the feelings which such a moment should have inspired. She watched him for a few moments in silence, then she said, softly, "Mr. Adams, are you ill? Can I do anything for you?"</p>
               <p>"No—ill?—no!" he said, starting at the sound of her voice. "Why should you think so?"</p>
               <p>"Because you looked so pale and grave," she replied; "and yet all appears so bright and happy for you now, that I feared you were suffering, and in silence."</p>
               <p>There was an inexpressible softness in the tone; a subdued, sweet look on the lovely face of Adeline Stephenson, which had been wanting to its beauty, when Gerard had first seen her on that memorable night, in her box, glittering and beautiful, but not soft and feminine as she appeared now.</p>
               <p>William turned round, and his eyes rested on her with a mournful expression that made her eyes droop under their long lashes.</p>
               <p>"Suffer!" he said; "yes, Adeline, I do suffer; but you cannot relieve it, you only add to the pain which lies so heavy, so hopelessly at my heart, and which I never felt so keenly as now."</p>
               <p>He sat down in the chair by the table, which had been always Guildford's resting-place, and buried his head in his hands. Adeline stood for a moment irresolute; then she laid her fingers on his hand, and said, in a whisper, "William, my preserver, will you not trust me with this terrible secret?"</p>
               <p>He started at the tone, it was so gentle;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6520-00000103"/> he could almost have thought so tender. He gazed in her sweet face. Her large dark eyes were downcast, her check flushed under his earnest look, her sweet lips trembled, yet a half triumphant smile hovered on them. Could it be?—was it possible he was so blest? He seized the soft hand in his, but dropped it in a moment.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Adeline," he said, "do not torture me with vain hopes. I cannot bear it; you must know that I love you, adore you, as I never shall love again. And yet I cannot, dare not, must not hope. The beautiful heiress of Garron's Hill is far above the sphere of the Irish farmer's son, and you will only crush me with your scorn, as <emph>she</emph> did."</p>
               <p>"<emph>She!</emph>" repeated Adeline. "Then you have loved before?"</p>
               <p>The jealous quickness would have been encouraging to a less timid lover; but he was too deeply moved to take the good omen.</p>
               <p>"I thought I did," he replied; "nay, I did love and admire Mabel May as any man would have done who was thrown with her, unguarded by another attachment. And I told her so, and she rebuked the presumption as it deserved. But it was not like my love for you, Adeline. I soon forgot, soon almost rejoiced that she had checked a love that could not have led to happiness; but you, oh, Adeline, Adeline, I worship you; my whole heart and soul, my every hope of happiness is linked with you; and yet I feel I am so immeasurably inferior to you. How dare I even tell you this madness, and perhaps forfeit your good opinion for ever!"</p>
               <p>Adeline had listened in silence. Perhaps such words are always sweet to a woman's ears, and she did not attempt to interrupt them. But when she saw tears glittering under the heavy eyelids of her lover, and saw his lips quivering with irrepressible emotion, she could resist no longer.</p>
               <p>"William, William," she said; "do not speak thus. Was I the heiress of Garron's Hill when you first loved me, when you risked your life, ay, met almost certain death to save the poor orphan from a fearful end? Are you not my equal in all things but wealth? and," she added in a soft whisper, "have you not won my wayward heart, that never thought to love again?"</p>
               <p>William clasped her in his arms with a passionate cry of delight that spoke better than words of his half delirious joy. It was perhaps fortunate that Adeline's last words sufficiently sobered him to some kind of consciousness, and that the quick jealousy of love slightly balanced its passionate joy.</p>
               <p>"You have loved then?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Yes, most unworthily; and it is now as a wretched dream, that only makes me value more my present safety and happiness," was the reply, as she hastily extricated herself from his arms, on the sound of quickly approaching footsteps.</p>
               <p>In another moment the door had opened, and William, still half-bewildered with the new and unhoped-for bliss that had opened before him, was smothered in the rough but touching embrace of his father, while Norah seized the only disengaged hand, and covered it with tears and kisses.</p>
               <p>"My boy, my dear boy, my heir, my pride! Oh that I should live to see you again," burst from the old man in broken tones; while Norah with instinctive perception of Adeline's feelings at such a moment, turned to her with a loving welcome and congratulating kiss, that said the return of the orphan was not without interest, even in the engrossing joy of reunion.</p>
               <p>At last Adams became more composed, and allowed his son to seat himself by his side, where he could look at and almost touch him, while he demanded eagerly some account of his mysterious absence.</p>
               <p>"My dear father," said the young man, glancing in some embarrassment at the group now flocking into the room, "it is a painful story; and happily, it is past. Let us forget it in the joy of this happy day."</p>
               <p>"No, not so, Mr. William," exclaimed Bryant, who had rubbed his eyes more than once, as he watched the agitation of the long-sorrowing father. "It's only fair that your father should know what his son is made of, and that he needn't be ashamed of him, if it was in His Majesty's Court, God bless him. But as there are others implicated in the tale, that are gone to a worse judgment than ours, I'll just make as short work of my story as I can.</p>
               <p>"You see, Mr. Adams, there's been a deal of foul play going on that no one could quite get at the bottom of, though you guessed something, and I knew a deal more. Well, it's all righted now, as you will hear from those that you knew in very different days, and all I have to explain is the cause of your son's sudden disappearance, and concealment of his existence, while knowing your natural anxiety about him. To make a long story short, it was part of the devilish schemes (saving the ladies' presence) of the poor wretch that's gone, to get rid of the woman who was in fact, if not in name, his wife. Your son and this young lady were, as it happened, mistaken for them, and before the stupid fools could distinguish 'twenty' from 'fifty' in a woman's face, she was pitched headlong into the bubbling waters of Dunmore Cave. Your son, Mr. Adams, to his honor, never paused a moment, but plunged in at the risk of his life, or rather almost certainty of death, and after a terrible struggle as I understand, brought her to the surface and swam with difficulty within reach of the shore. Luckily for him and this young lady, I had felt some misgivings as to the consequences and success of the arrangements made, and reached the spot just as one of my men was going to give a final touch that would have deprived you, sir, of a son, and Garron's Hill of a mistress.</p>
               <p>"I won't enter into particulars as to what followed, but only say, that I determined to run the risk of sparing their lives on condition that they should not reveal the secret of their existence to any human being unless I gave them leave. You will readily see the necessity of this, as my own life, and the lives of my men, would have been in certain danger from the law, had it been known that such an attempt had been made, and greater danger still from Guildford, because it failed. My next step was to get them completely away from the neighborhood, and indeed out of the country altogether; and as I had a little business in England, myself, I took them over with me. There's the secret of the matter for you."</p>
               <p>"Not quite," interrupted Adeline, gratefully taking the brigand's rough hand in hers. "You have not told how good came out of evil, and that you, by consigning me to the care of the very person who had known my dear mother, and remembered me in my infancy, were the means of bringing my real birth to light."</p>
               <p>"Yes," put in Ronald. "My foster father here has been our good genius after all, and not only saved my sister's life, but proved her right to the inheritance of our dear mother. The proudest possession I have, is the right, however humble, of calling Adeline 'sister,' and that I owe to Bryant."</p>
               <p>"And the proudest day of my life is that which gives me also the right, however unworthy, of calling the same fair lady 'mine,' said William Adams, with a bright smile, leading Adeline to his father, who sat in ludicrous perplexity at the sudden and startling facts, crowding on his mind.</p>
               <p>"You my son, my heir, this lovely young lady,—Garron's Hill," were phrases stammered out in broken and breathless astonishment; but a few minutes served to explain the state of matters to the enraptured farmer, and to obtain his consent and blessing on the newly-betrothed couple, and his amusingly profuse assurances to Bryant, that for his sake he would never again speak with disrespect of the "worthy tenants of the Rath."</p>
               <p>"Nay, nay, Mr. Adams," laughed the freebooter: "all that is at an end now, and your fair daughter-in-law means to erect a sort of Summer-house, or bower, or whatever you may please to call it, where the Robber's Cave used to stand, in memory of the poor soldier when he's far away."</p>
               <p>Bryant turned away, and brushed his hand over his face, and all present respected the regrets that thus naturally mingled with the new life of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ci-devant</foreign> Bryant of the Rath.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Little remains to be added to our tale:—Gerard, or rather, as he was now called Eustace Morrison Grenville, in memory of his father's original name, returned to England in about a fortnight after the events just recorded, to receive an ample reward for all his sufferings in the welcome of his enraptured father, and the consummation of his long and hopeless attachment to Mabel May.</p>
               <p>The double wedding of Mabel May and Lord Grenville, and Adeline Stephenson and William Adams, took place about six months after, with as much privacy as was consistent with the station of one of the bridegrooms, and the intense satisfaction and ostentatious pride of the father of the other.</p>
               <p>Old Adams thought he had lived long enough when his eyes had actually seen "his pride," "his heir," established as lord and master of Garron's Hill. But there was yet another gratification in store for his paternal pride, after a year of mourning for his darling Fanny, who slept peacefully in a foreign grave.</p>
               <p>Ronald Fleming, as he was called, partly as his mother's maiden name, partly as the declared heir of the whimsical old colonel, returned after two years of travel and probation, to pursue an old design on the heart and hand of Norah Adams, and as that young lady had by no means been insensible to the attractions of "Reginald Saville," in former days, she did not long resist the combined entreaties of Ronald himself, and of his sister Adeline, whose darling scheme had long been to see Norah the "sunbeam" of her brother's life as she had so long been of her paternal home at Bally Adams.</p>
               <p>Bryant fell at the storming at Quebec, after earning an honorable name among his comrades. Frederick Grenville perished in a duel arising out of a gambling quarrel, about two years after the marriage of Mabel and Gerard.</p>
               <p>Janet Morris, Adeline's first nurse, the old hostess of Gerard Carlton at Myrtle Heath, and the chief witness as to Adeline's identity, found a friend and happy home with her foster child at Garron's Hill.</p>
               <p>One word as to the unfortunate victim of the bullet intended for Paddy Ryan. The unfortunate man was the son of the woman formerly attending on Mrs. Carlton when Ronald was born, and from discoveries made by himself and Janet Morris as to the real circumstances of that period, he had made his way to Athy in order to make them known to Mrs. Stephenson, and take what measures she might deem fitting for the elucidation of the suspicions they revealed. His death had accidentally, or rather providentially, thrown these facts into the keeping of the only man who could really give a clue to the mystery, and gradually trace it out, till the deep designs of the wicked and interested evil doers were frustrated, and the wronged and helpless ones placed in their rightful position, after the sufferings and obscurity of their early career had done their salutary work.</p>
