The leading purpose in the hours which have been given to these pages, has been to portray a faithful picture from human life. The writer feels that her task has been imperfectly ful- filled, like most of our undertakings here, and but for the desire of her publisher would gladly close her work without the addition of these few lines. To paint the history of any human being, with its world of solemn experiences and moral, is no light task. How shall we bring back fully upon the canvas the lights and shadows which make another's little day, - the griefs, the sorrows, the strivings, the temptations, which ae so close- ly linked to our own. One thing as we went on in this busy painting, pressed upon us( above all, -the calm, overruling, ever-present providences of God. From His hand is the good and the evil, the path of thorns and the valley of flow- ers his plans are above all plans, stretching into eternity, c,  &#xD;<pb n="viii-9" xml:id="VAC7555-00000004"/> viii         PREFACE. while they pervade the present, and with which ours in con- tact bend as the supple reed. As we pass with Agnes Stanhope through the clouded chapter of her story, we trace a character, naturally fine and noble, and which, like many another, by the fiery ordeal opened through its one great error, enters upon a deeper and higher plane than under smoother circumstances it would have won. Lawrence, and poor Helen De Lacy, types of a different class, and who have no small part in the drama of our story we see them every day in the throng of life, the one a mystery and a marvel, why such bright talents should be perverted, and a poul which might shed abroad so much good, become through all its journey here, a curse to prey upon its kind; the other no less a mystery, and a mournful example of the too credulous faith and rash pride of youth. That this little book may take its place by the side of those of its kind which have preceded it, to share its humble part in their mission to amuse, elevate and strengthen, where its work may fall, is the prayer of THUE AUTHORL Kiitery, Me., July, 1862.   AGNES STANHOPE. CHAFr1AER I. Every human life has abundant materials for iI- terest and sympathy, could it be faithfully portray- ed. In many a lot which seems to flow on smoothly beside us, we should see, could its secrets be' laid bare to the eye of the spirit, incidents to rival the pictures of the roimancer. Like a dreamn on thia still autumn day seems the stormy and checkered career I am attempting to reive from the ashes of the past. The Agnes Stanhope of my tale, who filled so earnest and sodrVwful a part on the wide theatre in which she was called to act, has long ago mouldered back to dust, leaving to us, who follow her in other paths on to the same broad sea of eter- nity, the lessons of her experience. Would that I may paint them faithfully. Would that I may suc- ceed in filling up truthfully the outlines of that life, where little -more than the actions stand out to the 2  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7555-00000005"/> 10      AGNES STANHOPE. world, entering in to the hidden experience of thought and feeling, reserved for the nearest and dearest, or open only to the eye of the all-seeing Creator, It was a clear September evening in the autumn of the year-- . A large party were gathered at the house of a wealthy London banker. The draw- ing-rooms were well filled, and on the floor a quad- rille was forming to the inspiring strains of the mu- sic. Without, through the gardens, lighted up by the silver moonbeams, which kindled the spray of the fountain, and glistened amidst the blooming par- terres, gay groups wandered. Merry voices and silver-toned laughter were wafted on the still air over the grounds, mingling in with the sweet breath of music which floated out, now and then, from the distant drawing-rooms. One group, a gentleman -and lady, seemed too -much absorbed in each other, or in some mutually engrossing theme, to partake of the lightness of the hour. Many others there might have been who wore masks in this festive scene, but these two, on entering the open air, had thrown off their disguise. They had paused near the fountain, and now stood under the shadow of a spreading lau- rel half concealing them from a merry group near whose- voices reached them at that moment, in earn- est discussion of some topic of the day.   AGNES STANHOPE.       " "How could he have acted otherwise? How could he in honor have married Alice, preferring Miss Bertrand? What an opening. for distaste and aversion! What a life! No true woman would exact such a sacrifice. She would bid the recreant lover go." What was there in these words which came home to both the listeners? The lady started, colored, and made a movement to go on, to which the gen- tleman yielded. A sudden light kindled in his dark eye, indecision deepened into firmness, and as they gained the next path, which, gloomily bordered with graceful larches, shut them out from the voices they had left, he took quiet possession of the little hand which trembled upon his arm. "Agnes, dear Agnes, we must face this question. We have shrunk from it long enough. To-mor- row-" "O no, no!" she interrupted, tremblingly. "I cannot be so unjust, so false." "Unjust, false," he repeated, a slight bitterness mingling in his tone. ' If Bertha knew all, would she exact such a sacrifice? What an opening for distaste and aversion f' What a life!" Ah, what evil wind had blown those words within his reach. Was it ordered in councils our prayers and tears cannot move, that this dark path should be spread for Agnes Stanhope's-feet?  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7555-00000006"/> 12      AG[NES STANHOPEo. Even as he spoke, the image of Bertha, noble, true, awaiting them in her happy home, rose up be- fore her. With this picture came the hundred-fold kindnesses of an elder sister to her lonely orphan- hood. Her voice steadied, she struggled to unloose her hand. "This is but a dream which will soon pass away. Bertha is pure, beautiful, noble - God forgive us both!" The closing words came uncon- sciously. With that unmoved face turned upon her in its sorrowful earnestness, the memory of the days when she had trembled in sight of this hour, came upon her, and her girlish dream returned in all its passion and despair. He saw his advantage, as each change was reflect- ed in the down cast face. "Agnes, I shall never marry Bertha. I acknowledge her excellences, her virtues; they are too cold to move me; I feel, to- night, that I never really loved her. Put her from your thoughts, dear child, and answer me. It is whether you love me, not with the phantom of her claims, that we have to;do." Alight shone in her suddenly uplifted eyes, a faint glow broke over cheek and brow. How golden the future at his side! Could heaven, that distant, lonely realm, far away with all its fabled glories, hold anything so beautiful! Ah, Bertha, why did you trust this young creature, so rich in imagination, so unlearned in the world's hard ways, to the com-   AGNES STANHOPE.       13 panionship of Mr. Maitland in her first London visit? How inopportunate was this sickness of your good old foster nurse, which kept you back in the little cottage' of Hawthorndean, and why, for the first time, did the gentle, unselfish Agnes forget her duty to share your lonely watches for the new and long talked of pleasures of the metropolis? If you had given voice to the vague pain which stirred your heart at parting, if you had spoken one word of all your voiceless regrets, where had been the tempta- tion of to-night, and the long years of sorrow and separation stretching away in the future? Steadily Maitland's eye took in the momentary blush and the quickly withdrawn glance. It was his last opportunity to press his suit, and he knew it well. At that very hour, a hundred miles hence, Bertha was looking forth, and watching from the window opening on the wide piazza, for the carriage slowly winding up the gravelled path, which was to bring to her eager welcome the two beings dearest to her on earth. He saw her now in the pale glim-T mer of the moonlight, in her white dress, the dark hair parted smoothly from the full brow, the shining huzel eyes full of light and gladness; but he turned to the fairer face, fairer to him, at his side. "Agnes, dearest, will you send me from you? Alone, what is the future worth to either of us?

"If I could." "Is it so hard? All -the future. A life devoted to you." He felt his answer in the hand which now lay un- resisting in his, in the silent lips. It was a strange and sad betrothal. "How shall I tell her. What shall I say." "Leave it to me." A pause followed. They went on together in si- lence. The long branches' of the larches rustled with a tremulous motion; voices and footsteps grew fainter in the distance. Agnes first became con- scious of the stillness, and the distance to which they had withdrawn from the rest of the company. "Let us return," she said. "It is growing late." "Yes, and the dew is falling," with a glance of dismay at her thin dress. He put aside the thick boughs and drew her out gently into a more cheer- ful path. Here were beds of mignonette, and early autumn roses, filling the air with sweetness, inter- spersed with the pale cluster of the fragrant helio- trope, and a host of kindred blossoms, "Agnes," he began abruptly, " the time is short which remains to us to talk over our plans. We cannot return to Hawthorndean to-morrow; our route lies a different way." She shuddered. Every   AGNES STANHOPE.       15 step which led to this radiant future was painful. Alas, if the golden to be should prove a mirage after all; but this thought did not come to her, she saw only the perplexities of the present. Maitland looked down on the young girl with an expression' of pity and tenderness, something as he might have regarded the pain and uneasiness-of a child mingled with a deeper feeling. "My love, under the circumstances in which we- are placed, delay is not to be admitted. Our mar- riage must take place at once. Nay, Agnes,"-for her lips moved with a startled appeal, " it is the only course left open to us; once separated, all fu- ture meeting between us is cut off. We will go down to my sister's cottage at Southsea. Alice will gladly receive us. What, doubting, child? No one in the world, but yourself, loves me so truly. No one can so earnestly desire to further my happi- ness. I have no nearer kith or kin. Alice and I have been all to each other." Agnes sighed, but her lips were mute. Her hand was in his, his will was to be her guide. Slowly they retraced their steps to the brilliantly lighted rooms, and the gay company which was now beginning to break up. They had no wish to lin- ger; and after a short search for Agnes' chaperone, whom he soon discovered, Maitland, at her request, called for the carriage, and followed the ladies to the  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7555-00000008"/> 16      AGNES STANHOPE. dressing-room. A silent pressure of the hand as he assisted Agnes in, conveyed his adieu, and the seal of their arrangements of the morrow. The door closed, the coachman mounted to his seat, and the vehicle rattled heavily over the pavements, through the half-deserted streets Agnes laid her head back wearily on the cushions. A depressing weight was at her heart with all its new found happiness. How should she face Bertha? "You are pale, my love," said Mrs. Delancy, at the late breakfast table. London hours are begin. ning to tell upon your roses." Scarcely had they risen from the somewhat pro- tracted meal, when the bell rang, and a servant an- nounced Mr. Maitland. Agnes went down to re- ceive him. The half repentance and feeble purposes of the long night melted like summer mist before the charm of his presence, and his affectionate greeting. She suffered him to draw her to a seat by his side, and listened while he told her of the letter he had dispatched to his sister, by the early morning post, in advance of their arrival. "In little more than an hour's time, dear Agnes, the carriage will be here. I need not say, my love, that you will spare yourself the embarrassment of acquainting Mrs. Delancy with any change in your arrangements. In a few, a very few days, all these painful concealments will be at an end. They are only a step which leads to so much happiness."   CHAPTER   II. We leave for a while the busy world of London, and the quiet cottage at Southsea, from whose win- dows Agnes dreamily watched the cold, surging sea, for the hardly less secluded country house of Haw- thorndean. It was a humble, but time-associated dwelling, not beginning, in its narrow dimensions and neglected grounds, to vie with the lordly seats in the neighborhood. The park was small, with a broad carriage walk leading through it up to the entrance; the garden was well kept, showing in its blooming beds, many foreign blossoms, and the long piazza was overrun with a rich profusion of climbing honeysuckles and roses. It was a pleasant picture to look upon, in that soft September evening. The majestic elms of the park casting their broad shad- ows over the short velvet sward; the many-hued flowers of the little garden filling the air with fra- grance ; the green, glossy vines lying silently around the white pillars of the porch, and all under the warm spell of moonlight, and the stillness of an au- tumn night. So the watcher thought, as she sat gazing forth in listless vacancy, starting at every breath which rustled the leaves around the pillars, 2*  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7555-00000009"/> 18      AGNES STANHOPE. as if it bore the welcome echo of carriage wheels. At last she sank back wearily in her seat, and lean- ed her head heavily against the curiously carved frame-work of the antique chair, "It is late," she murmured with a stifled sigh. "'They will not come to-night. How strange! What can have happen- ed?" Her hands clasped listlessly together. A ray shot up in the moonlight, from the diamond on her finger. His engagement ring. A faint smile broke through the lowering shadow on her face, but it was gone in a moment. "What can have hap- pened? is Agnes sick? It is four days since they would be here. I wish I had written this morning. Well, it is of no use to sit here. The day has quite gone."   She roused herself with an effort, and rang the bell. She had refused lights an hour ago, cheating herself into the belief that they might yet come ; the twilight was not quite past, but now she surrender- ed herself to the reality. "Has the Evening Post come in, Margaret?" "Yes, marm.  Here are some papers for you, which James has just brought." "No letter!" She drew a seat to her little work table, and be- gan slowly unfolding them. They bore the London post-mark, but were superscribed in an unfamiliar hand. "I must write this evening, in readiness for   AGNES STANHOPE.        19 the morning mail. Can Agnes be tempted, like a giddy child, to stay to another ball?

The open paper fell from her hand. "O, my God!"  Her face grew ashy white. She stooped mechanically to pick it up. Twice, thrice, she read over the fatal words. Then she sat down silently, her brain in a chaos of bewilderment, her senses reeling. She reached out her hand, groping for the bell, but her arm sank helplessly on the table. All was darkness before her. Soon the terrible truth stung her back to life. Words, looks, flashed out from the past. Her per- jured lover, her false sister. At last she knew them both. But, O, the anguish of this -late revelation! "Agnes, my sister; with what comparative pleas- ure, at any time, since thy birth, could I have fol- lowed thee to thy grave I Lost to me; utterly lost! thy truth gone, thine innocence sullied." She rose and passed to the opposite window, look- ing out with wild, mournful eyes, on the church- yard, whose grey head-stones interspersed with fresher tablets of white marble, glimmered faintly in  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7555-00000010"/> 20      'AGNES STANHOPEo the distance. There her father and mother slept. There now, in the pain of this first great sorrow, she longed to lie down beside them. Alone; so cruel- ly betrayed! Was there ever a bitterer cup press- ed to human lip? She remembered the reverses which had broken her father's spirit, and cut- him off in the prime of his years, when she was too young to realize her loss. She remembered how her gen- tle mother had lived on in her waning -health: the sweet lessons she had taught her, the faith and hope enshrined in that fragile form; and vividly, in this still hours came back the last scene; Agnes' clasp- ing arms around her neck, and the feeble words which fell half inarticulate, from the white lips whose last mortal prayer was said, "Be to her mother and sister, till we meet again." Alone! alone in her great, stunning grief! Her trust staggered in human truth -the future lying in all its wreck and desolation before her! The early sunrise as it struggled into the little parlor, through the thick lattice-work of vines, found Bertha still pacing the floor. Wan and haggard were still the outlines of her pale face, but the calm eye and unbent mouth showed the first stupor of de- spair past. Hers was too strong and healthful a na- ture to be overwhelmed without a struggle. Brok- en as her life was, it still held cares and duties. The aged foster mother, the dependent servants, the   AGNES STANHOPE.        21 sick and poor in the little hamlet, whose lowly homes had been brightened by her presence and gentle charities, these needed her for the present. Her work on earth was not yet finished. For these she must strive to live. What was beyond in the future she knew not, -cared not. God's purposes were closely veiled from her. She went up to her chamber to bathe her pale face and heavy eyes. Here the breakfast bell found her, and she descended as usual to the dining-room. The windows were open, and the sweet perfume of the late roses stole in. To her it came laden with a hundred thrilling memories, things to be forgot. How he loved these early autumn roses; he had twined their pale clusters in her dark locks, and gathered handfuls for her vases--a year ago. A faint sickness crept over her as she took her place at the solitary table. The housekeeper poured out the amber colored chocolate, which Bertha took silently from her hand. She was glad, for once, that thoughts and anxieties of her own kept the good lady silent. Her son was lying at the point of death in one of the cottages hard by - her wayward, sinning son, but the poor mother's all. She had just come from last night's sorrowful vigils. The recollection struck Bertha as she pushed aside- her plate of hardly tasted toast. How selfish she was in her sorrow I She looked up  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7555-00000011"/> AGNES STANHOPE, at the care-wrinkled face before her. "Forgive me, Mrs. Robart. I have been sadly inattentive this morning. How is your son " ' Failing fast, Miss Bertha. I cannot hope he will be spared to me another day." Bertha started at this 'sudden announcement. A feeling of self-reproach struck her. Absorbed in her anxieties at Agnes' singular silence, she had ne- glected for the last few days, her accustomed visits to the cottage. Death so near; passing almost into the sanctuary of her own home, for she had known the poor young man from her very childhood. Mrs. Robart had been her mother's maid, in her parents' more prosperous days, from which situation she had passed, in their darkening fortunes, to the more re- sponsible post of housekeeper. "Iwill go back with you," said Bertha, rising from the table. She hurried into the .sitting-room for her bonnet, and came back to the hall, where Mrs. Robart was waiting her. They passed in silence down the little path which, bordered by a low hedge of sweet briar, led over the hill to the hamlet at its base. It consisted of a cluster of poor cottages, occupied by the tenantry of Lord Wilkes, a nobleman who owned a large estate in the neighborhood, which he left principally in the care of his agent, coming down once a year from London, in the early autumn, for the amusement of grouse shooting.   28   AGNES STANHOPE.   With a noiseless step Bertha entered the little room, whose humble furniture in its ordering and neatness showed the tender care of loving hands, as well as the presence of meagre poverty. A vase of fresh gathered flowers stood on the white deal table, at the bed-side; and the breath of the morning air stole in at the open window. It seemed to revive the languid pulses of the sufferer, for the lines of pain his white brow had worn through the long night were gone, and the faintest shadow of a smile parted his thin lips. He looked up to welcome his visitor, and a faint murmur of pleasure escaped him, as Bertha drew near. She took a chair silently near the bed. She could not trust her lips with the common words of inquiry which rise so naturally from the heart in the atmosphere of a sick room. The change which a few days had wrought; was too plainly marked. The fearfully hollowed temples, where the blue veins lay like knotted cords; the deep, pomegranate red in the thin cheek, the fever crimson of the mouth, the unnatural brilliancy of the large, dark eyes. "You are better, Charles," said the poor mother, as she stood by the -bed, noting with watchful eyes, the absence of pain and the momentary animation of his look. "You breathe easier, and your fever is quite gone. Try to take some nourishment. Who knows," she murmured, in a lower tone, to herself,  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7555-00000012"/> AGNES STANHOPE. as she moved toward a stand at the opposite side of the room, on which stood a half emptied cup of curds and wine, " if God may yet be pleased to spare him to me"          '  An expression of deep despondency chased the    i momentary glow from the invalid's face, as, raised  i from his pillows by her support, he tasted of the strengthening draught she held to his lips. The lightest mixtures, as well as the most tempting fruits had begun to pall upon his fevered taste. He de- clined it with an 'impatient gesture, and sank back with a deep drawn sigh. Life was still very dear to him, with all its suffering days and restless nights. Not the mere human dread of the dark, untrodden path which yawned before him, but his deeper spir. itual nature had awoke, at last, upon this bed of death, and he'longed, with all his eager will, to 're- trieve misused opportunities, and wasted years. Might he but live to cherish his long-neglected mother's old age, his poor mother, to whom he had been but a burden and a trial in his wayward course, instead of the strong helper she had looked for-  ward to lean upon-ah, saddest of all prayers, these, when the strength of muscle and nerve is gone, and the darkening eye looks its last on familiar faces,  S and over the green earth. Through these long weeks and months. of sick- ness, for the dawning spring had found him a pris-   AGNES STANHOPE.       25 oner in this little room, few visitors had broken the monotony of his loneliness. The good farmer's dame, with whom his mother had provided the poor prodigal a shelter from her scanty earnings, was too much absorbed in her housewifery to sparie many hours to the sick room, and his mother herself, though favored with so indulgent a mistress, had also her portion of cares and duties. Bertha's occa- sional visits, then, could not but be eagerly welcom- ed and looked for. She read to him, talked with him, when his intervals of rest permitted; brought him choice flowers from her garden, and sent him rare fruits to tempt his fevered appetite. These kind cervices could not be rendered without enkin- dling sympathy and interest in her own bosom, and her own crushing sorrow was now deadened for the moment, as she looked upon his changed face. Little indeed, could she say when voice and self- control returned; little to the poor soul about to look upon the mysteries of eternity. The rector of the parish should have been there, in this trying hour, but he was many miles away, and it was Ber- tha's trembling hand which unclosed the Book that al6ne can shed a ray of peace upon such scenes, and her faltering voice which repeated that sublime chap- ter of John, from which so many of the weary and sick-hearted of earth have gathered strength and consolation, and which "shall be read in dying  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7555-00000013"/> 26      AGNES STANHOPE. chambers and houses of mourning till death and sor- row'shall reign no more." "Let not your hearts be troubled, ye believe in God believe also in me." With what a thrilling power those soothing words came back upon her own sick heart and dizzy brain. She closed the chapter, and looked towards the bed. The sick man lay in a peaceful calm; the weary, troubled look gone from his face, his pale hands folded on the counterpane. His mother still sat at the bedside, which supported her elbow, her face half hidden in her hand. There was no more to be said; and Bertha, committing him in a voiceless prayer, to that God who watches over all his chil- dren, went silently out into the air. She retraced her steps homeward. The sparrows were twittering from the hedges, the dew lay in a shower of bril- liants on the grass and leaves. Her heart only was discordant. The mysteries of life oppressed her. Her foster-mother met her at the door, -the old nurse whose heart was bound up in the children she had tended from their infancy. It was her first ap- pearance from her sick room. Bertha strove to meet her greeting with a smile, but the attempt was a failure. The scene she had just quitted was a suf- ficient excuse for her emotion. Nurse Llewyn's face softened into sympathy, as she followed her into the cheerful little sitting-room. The shutters had been thrown wide, and a shower of sunbeams   AGNES STANHOPE.       27 danced and played over the rich colors of the Brus- sels carpet. Drawing an ample arm-chair toward the old dame, Bertha sank into her low rocker, by the open window. Before her, on her petite work- stand stood her little basket of unfinished fragments. Each had its history - how could she take them up again with these listless, tired fingers? She sat looking at vacancy. The nurse's voice roused her. "Is the poor young man gone?" "No ; he is alive and conscious, that is all." "-Ah, alack-a-day; a sad, heavy stroke for poor Mrs. Robart. The pride she used to feel in him! It's only the other day he was a bright-eyed, curly- headed little boy. I remember well when his poor mother came here leading him by the hand; her husband was dead, and died in debt, and she had to beg her way-- and your blessed mother took her in. She had been her maid before she came here, when your mother was a grand lady, before the Captain lost - pardon, Miss Bertha, I didn't mean to touch on old times - but you were such playmates then, little children together. Ah, well, I'll never believe if Charles hadn't gone from here he wouldn't have come up right. A kinder-hearted boy never lived. But his mother's letting him have his way always was the ruin of him." ' The grave buries all dissensions. Only the good we do lives after us." Bertha repeated it  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7555-00000014"/> id-     AGNES. STANHOPE. wearily. I think her heart did not quite endorse the trite saying. "Well, his troubles will soon be all over. We've ours to go through. Strange we don't hear from Miss Agnes. I asked Margaret last night if James had got a letter when he came in. I'm afraid the child's sick." Bertha's cheek blanched to a deadlier white. The truth must come out at some time,--the humil- iating, stinging truth. What should she say? Then the wild pang for sympathy, human sympa- thy, beat at her heart. Who would give it like the old nurse, the tender foster-mother, who had cra- dled her times and again to her faithful bosom, in the sicknesses and fretful griefs of infancy. She put by the longing with a struggle, her face dropped in her hands. Presently she raised it; brow and lip were calm, but O, so white!"My   foster-mother, my   dear, kind friend, Agnes ha deceived us all. Her name must never again be breathed in this house. Long  before this she is Mr. Maitland's wife.  The whole was said. Her voice fell only on the last word. Her steady will crushed down the im- pulse to spring from her seat, and escape to the soli- tude of her chamber, or to yield to a paroxysm of weak tears. The old woman sat with parted lips and vacant   AGNES STANHOPE.        29 eyes. A gust of east wind rustled the leaves sullen- ly against the glass of the window. Words came at last. "Miss Bertha, Miss Bertha, there is some mis- take!" "' There is none. I was blind not to see it months ago." She rose and went quietly out of the room. The sunshine flooded a broad space in the gaily-flowered carpet, the robins sang merrily from the russet-leav- ed boughs of the swaying cherry-tree ; a faint per- fume stole in from the late roses - the old nurse sat bent forward in her easy-chair, her hands folded be- fore her; a great grief on her thin, wrinkled face,- grief which age expresses so mournfully, which seems to belong only to the young. An hour later a carriage bowled slowly up the gravelled walk through the park. From her win- dow Bertha's quick eye was caught by the Mait- land arms upon the pannel, and she descended at once to the hall, in trembling surprise, to receive her visitor. What could have brought a call from Col- onel Maitland? an event altogether so unusual. Could he be still unaware of his nephew's perfidy? an event which all the world knew before herself. The footman let down the steps, and Colonel Mait- land slowly alighted. He greeted Bertha without any appearance  of constraint, and with his usual quiet courtesy.  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7555-00000015"/> 30      AGNES STANHOPE. "Having an errand in your neighborhood, Miss Bertha, I could not deny myself the pleasure of a call." She led the way to the little parlor. The inter- view before her, common-place as it seemed, was deeply embarrassing. To sustain her part in the careless topics of the day under that cool gaze, was no easy matter. They had met twice, before; once in her short visit to London, in Agnes' school days, when she was presented to him as Howard's fiancee, her en- gagement just then taken place; and once, later, a happy week passed in his own pleasant home. at Harrowdale, His pleasant home, I say, though Colonel Maitland had never married, but his vener- able house-keeper knew well how to follow the tastes and wishes of her master. From this fact, of his confirmed bachelor-hood, Bertha well knew his nephew had drawn large expectations, more than encouraged, thus far, by the old man's liberal gener- osity to his wants. In the matter of his choice, therefore, his uncle's approbation had been of no little importance, possibly involving his future heir- ship; and Bertha well remembered the pleasure his hearty admiration of herself had given her lover. His presence now, aside from all the, more promi- nent causes, brought up with keen bitterness the memory of those happy days. Was it possible he   AGNES STANHOPE.        31 could be in ignorance of his nephew's late mar- riage? A softened gleam in the dark eye which met hers, a gentler and more subdued tone to the full voice, bore suddenly to her troubled perception a sense of sympathy, too delicately expressed to excite shame, or wound pride. This, then, had moved his visit, commiseration for the poor girl whose desolate cir- cumstances he so well knew. It had taken him some twenty mies out of his way, for Thirteslane, the well known seat of Lord Craige, with whom she gathered in the course of the conversation, his busi- ness lay, was in a distant direction. He rose, at length, gravely declining her courteous invitation to remain to lunch. "I must resume my way. Many miles yet lie before me, and I have already lingered too long." He took her hand, his grave dark eyes resting kindly on her face. "My dear Miss Bertha, I was your father's friend. A truer, and deeper intimacy than ours in the spring'of our youth could not well be. I lost sight of my friend when in his ill health he resigned and retired upon his half pay to this-lonely spot. His over sensitive pride led him to hide him- self in his misfortunes from his old associates; but I have never forgotten him; to-day he is as fresh in my memory as twenty years ago. When I saw you, dear lady, though your face, I knew not why,  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7555-00000016"/> 32      AGNES STANHOPE. brought up old recollections, I did not dream that I was so happy as to welcome under my roof the daughter of my lost friend--had I known, nothing could have prevented my announcing it; the discov- ery was reserved for a later day. My dear child, as I was your father's friend, let me be yours, more, if you will, let me help to supply his place. Should the day come when you need a strong arm to lean upon, when the world looks lone and cold, will you tust me? believe me?" Bertha's eyes filled with tears. For a moment her emotion kept her silent, but the feeling which suffused her cheek and quivered in her lip was more grateful to the noble heart of the man who stood before her, than any words of thanks. "I will, Colonel Maitland," she said, at last, "and I thank you a thousand times for your kindness." He touched the hand he held in respectful silence to his lips, and turned away. Bertha followed him to the door, and stood there to receive his parting bow. With a slow step she came back to the little sit- ting room. The glow of grateful feeling had super- seded the paleness on her cheek. There was one heart in the world which honored her, and which held dear her welfare. She was no longer utterly alone. We must each bear our burdens, none can bear them for us, but there is a thrilling power, a help in human sympathy.   CHAPTER III. We go back to London, wither Maitland and his young wife have at last returned from their bridal tour. It was late in October, and they had taken possession of their new home. The scandal at their sudden marriage had already blown over, succeeded by some new object of gossip. True, Agnes' bril- liant ball, to which more than half the elite were in- vited, revived the story; but she heeded little the curious eyes, or the side whispers which stole through her crowded drawing-rooms, in her full tide of happiness. For she was very, very happy. Maitland was all devotion, and the establishment over which she was enthroned as mistress, was daz- zling to her girlish pride. She dearly loved, too, the homage which her beauty and grace elicited, less perhaps, however, for her own than her hus- band's sake. Still, there was a drawhack even now to the fulness of her content,-Bertha's alienation. She longed for her embrace, and kiss of peace. She pined for her forgiveness. So Maitland found her the first home evening after their return, reclining languidly on the sofa, which had been wheeled up before the glowing grate, for a wild storm was rag- 3  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7555-00000017"/> 34      AGNES STANHOPE. ing without, which made the ruddy coal fire pleas- ant. She looked up at his entrance, but the smile which sprang to her lip did not quite banish the shadow from her brow. He threw himself into a seat beside her. "What is it, my love? wearied with all these dissipations?" Her troubled look met his. His eyes fell. He did not need words to express what was in her thought. She laid her hand gently upon his knee. "Howard, it is the one bitter drop in my cup of happiness. If I could hear Bertha say, "I love you.'  His brow contracted in a little impatient frown, but it. softened before the wistful eyes uplifted in his face. He took her hand in his with a sudden change of manner. "You are right, Agnes. She should have heard from us before. It is an awkward task. But I will attempt it this evening. Her face was very lovely, now, in its gladness. "O, Howard! But if she should not answer.' "Never fear," he said, rising. "There is the world's laugh." She shrank as if the last words pained her. It was not the first time in their short honey-moon, that his voice had fallen discordantly on her ear. She missed Bertha's high toned standard. The   AGNES STANHOPE.         35 cloud had come up in her sky, even in her short stay at Southsea cottage.  She did not learn to love there her new connection, the Alice of whom he had spoken so glowingly, the sister-in-law whom a young girl's fancy, from the nearness to the man she loved, had invested with a halo of excellence.  She had  shrunk from her cold, worldly views of every sub- ject which had fallen between them; she had shud- dered at her half amused smile at her own loyal faith in human goodness and honor. Perhaps the smile came in part at such sentiments on the lips of the fair speaker, in her own hour of dereliction, but it was not the more endurable on that suspicion. Poor Agnes had never known a deeper thrill of re- lief than that with which, on her bridal morning, she received Mrs. Moreton's cold good-bye kiss, and adieu. But the letter must be written.  Maitland drew the rosewood writing-desk to the sofa, and began his difficult task. Many a sheet was blotted and thrown aside, but at length the lines stood: "MY DEAR MISS STANHOPE: What excuse can I offer for my late conduct towards you. I have nothing to plead but the force of an all-powerful tempta- tion, with the deep-seated conviction that the fulfilment of our engagement would fail to promote the happiness of either. Circumstances have hurried on events, and led to a step, which at our last parting, was hardly further from my thoughts than  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7555-00000018"/> 86        AGNES STANHOPE. yours. Suffer me to entreaton my knees, your forgiveness, and to pray that for the sake of the sharer of my fault, you will, in time, receive me back to some portion of your confidence. Your alien- ation, Bertha, and the sense of our unworthiness towards you, deeply shadows our happiness. Be generous; promise us that you will forgive what cannot be recalled, and suffer us to show in the future, our gratitude. Agnes waits impatiently to hear from you." He folded the note, sealed it, and dashed off the superscription with a sigh of relief. "Now, my Agnes, no more     gloomy reveries. This will reach Bertha to-morrow, and the day be- yond we may look for her answer. All will come right. All will be well." She hoped so.  She hoped and feared.  He rang the bell, and ordered the servant to take it in time for the evening mail. Her eyes followed the little missive wistfully as it disappeared in the man's pocket, and he quitted the room   on his errand. How much hung on those few carelessly traced lines. Would she write? Again, in her dressing-room, some three evenings later, but now attiring for an evening party, Agnes sat. She reclined listlessly back in her chair before her toilet table, and behind her stood her maid care- fully arranging her thick nut brown tresses in heavy braids. A bandeau of diamonds, Maitland's latest gift, lay in its casket before her, and over a chair, near by, had been thrown the fresh ball robe of In-   AGNES STANHOPE.        37 dia muslin, with its delicate trimmings of costly lace. A faint shadow contracted the white brow, and the blue eyes were heavy with unshed tears. She was beginning to feel, in the keenness of her own disap- pointment in the non-arrival of the eagerly desired missive of peace, how cruel was the pain she had herself inflicted. In the tumult of happiness, and the excitements of her new life, she had, hitherto, found little time for thought. The last braid was disposed in its place, the cir- clet of diamonds adjusted; and Agnes turned at the girl's exclamation, with a half languid smile, to note their effect in the mirror. It was a fair face the smooth glass gave back, though now a little sorrow- ful; the dazzlingly clear complexion, the large blue eyes, the finely cut features, the crimson mouth-and all this loveliness not a little heightened by the new fashion of the rich braids, and the brilliancy of the flashing diamonds. Her husband's light knock, and she sprang up eagerly, quite forgetting the presence of her servant. "O, Howard I A letter?" "You may leave us a few moments," he said, smilingly, as he motioned to the attendant. "'I shall interfere with your toilet, my Agnes. But I could not delay. I know your impatience." She was hardly attending to him. She had torn open the precious missive. A few lines traced in those familiar characters met her eye. There was no wavering in the firm, beautiful hand.  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7555-00000019"/> 88       AGNES STANHOPE. 'AGNES: I have just received your husband's letter. I send you my forgiveness, and peace, my poor deluded child. I repeat, I send you my forgiveness, but for the present there can be no renewal of old ties between us. That is for a distant day, if ever; as God in his providence wills. May you be happy in the separate lot you have chosen." The little sheet fell from her hand, and rustled to the floor. There was no need to question; the look of troubled dismay in those clear eyes was plain enough. Maitland stooped to pick it up. His cheek reddened as he ran it silently over. He laid it down. His eyes furtively avoided his wife's face. "Come," he said, at length, with a dash of impa- tience in his tone, " we could expect nothing better. For her own sake"-he stopped, "but the- girl never was like the rest of her sex." I should have made allowance for this, he muttered to himself, in an undertone. What will my good uncle say? Bertha was such a favorite. Agnes still stood like one who had received a sudden blow, her cheeks white, her eyes full. of a troubled light. The sight roused him. He took her hand. "Never mind, Agnes. Let it all go. She'will come round in time. What! you have lost all your roses, my love. You must look your best to-night, at Mrs. deCoucy's. I expect to meet -an old friend   AGNES STANHOPE.        39 I have not seen for years. We were classmates, and sworn friends when he went abroad. I would not for worlds have him disappointed in my wife." His words awoke her from her grief. It was not the sympathy she wanted, she felt that vaguely; but sle Smiled a feeble smile, and tried to recollect herself. He rang the bell impatiently for the return of the maid, and Agnes at her entrance went back mechan- ically to her seat before the toilet glass. Soon the last touch was given, the rich mechn lace lay in soft folds over the white shoulders, the pearl brace- let was clasped upon the rounded arm; and draw- ing her mantle loosely around 'her, Agnes yielded her hand to her husband to lead her down to the car- riage. The ride was short, and both kept silent. "You are pale, Agnes," whispered Maitland, as he handed her out.  "Try to recover your spirits for my sake." They entered immediately, and after lingering a moment in' the dressing-room to divest herself of her wrappings, Agnes took her husband's arm to join the guests. Mrs. deCoucy came forward with unusual impressment to receive them. It was her first meeting with Maitland's bride ;and nothing could be more flattering than the warmth of her re- ception. In the little group she had quitted at their entrance, stood a stranger whose earnest look invol-  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7555-00000020"/> 40      AGNES STANHOPE. untarily drew Agnes' downcast eyes. He came to- ward them. Maitland broke off from their hostess' graceful compliments at his approach, and grasped with animation the hand he extended. "My dear Lawrence, I am rejoiced to see you. Mrs. Maitland, permit me to present to you an old friend." Agnes raised her eyes at the brief introduction. She bowed, said something politely of her pleasure in meeting one with whose name she had grown so familiar upon- her husband's lips; and then her look fell again. -How much is sometimes revealed in a glance. Agnes felt a strange shudder of repulsion creep over her; she knew not why. The stranger was a man of fine exterior, of courtly grace of man- ner, and still in the flush of youth. The music struck up a lively peal. He bent toward her. "' Mrs. Maitland, may I beg the honor of your hand for this quadrille?" To refuse, and under her husband's eye, was im- possible; she yielded it with an ill grace, and suffer- ed him to lead her to her place on the floor. "It is pleasant to be so heartily welcomed to one's native land after a long absence," he said, taking advantage of one of the pauses in the music. "Your husband and myself were classmates together; and the closest friends in old times. Maitland's friend- ships were always fervent. He- is one of the truest hearted men I ever knew."   AGNES STANHOPE.        41 Could he have chosen a more congenial theme for the ear of the young wife-? Agnes smiled. A faint glow stole over her pale cheek, to which both the company and the dance had as yet failed to restore its roses. "You have been absent long-?" she said. "Yes, years. I could not hope to be remembered, still less so warmly greeted. I thought in these scenes my name must have died out from every one's recollection." A faint sneer crossed his full lip. Agnes felt again the inexplicable repulsion. "You are unjust to your kind," she said, softly. "Yes," he replied, with a stolen glance of her half averted face. "I judge by the world I have known. ,But to-night! Dear Mrs. Maitland, what would I not give for your happy faith. Shall I not borrow from it?" The dance had come to a close, and she took his arm to rejoin her husband. Maitland stood in the little circle grouped around his hostess; a proud light in, his eye, and the shadow of a happy smile around his lip. - He had been watching his wife's graceful evolutions in the dance, at the side of his newly restored friend, while his ear took in mechan- ically the pleasant trifling around him. Never be- fore had he looked upon his new possession with a critical eye, and he was pleased to feel that his fas- tidious taste had been given ample allowance in his 3*.  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7555-00000021"/> 42      AGNES STANHOPE. love match. Agnes caught his look at their ap- proach, and it deepened the rose in her cheek. Lawrence's quick eye took in the emotion which stirred the pulses of each. Yes, it was really a love match. "I tried to tempt Mrs. Maitland to play the truant for once, and admire with me the beauties of our hostess' conservatory," he said, as Agnes gladly relinquished her escort's arm for her husband's, s' but my suit was quite unsuccessful. She insisted on our rejoining you." "My gentle wife is new to these scenes," Mait- land said, quietly. "God grant," he thought, as he looked down on her bright face with a half subdued glance, "that she may ever keep her freshness." Why the sudden prayer sprang to his lips at that instant he could not tell. Was it the foreshadow- ng of the future which wraps its misty veil around us oftener than we dream? They went out into the refreshment room, presently, Lawrence accompany- ing them; and, indeed, he attached himself to the side of the young couple for the most of the evening, to the exclusion of the dance, and the claims of many a fair face. The most of the evening, we say, for Agnes, as much as the etiquette of the place per- mitted, kept her station by her husband, leaving him only to pass through the figures of another dance with a  stranger, who had sought an introduc-   AGNES STANHOPE,       43 tion for that purpose through her hostess, and for a short tete-a-tete with an elderly dowager with whom she had made some little progress to acquaintance. The two long separated friends had much to say. With all the shadow of indefinable distrust hanging about her, Agnes could not but admire her new ac- quaintance's versatility and extensive information as she listened to the flow of his richly stored mind. "How were you pleased with Mr. Lawrence, Agnes?" said Maitland, as he sunk back in the car- riage, which was rapidly whirling them through the silent streets toward their home. "He is extremely fascinating; very interesting." The words came out with an effort. Maitland looked up at her with a thoughtful glance. ' Yes, he has travelled much, and added largely to the possessions of an already brilliant mind. -We shall see much of him. I hope, my love, you will aid me to make his visits at our home pleasant. And now I am upon the subject, my sweet wife, gratifying as it is to me, it is not a-propos of taste in these assem- blies to be always leaning upon the arm of one's husband. When we are in the world, some sacri- fice of our inclinations is due to others. I could see Lawrence under his playful words was a little shock- ed to-night when you insisted on coming back to me at once from the dance." A troubled look stole into Agnes' blue eyes. Had this friend come between them already?  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7555-00000022"/> "      AGNES STANHOPE. "My dear," Maitland went on, in a little graver tone, as she remained silent, "-you are new to these things. A little reflection will show you the propri- ety of my suggestions." "At least I will try to satisfy you." Her voice was not quite firm. The carriage stopped at that instant; they had reached home, and the opening of the door by the coachman prevented further reply. Agnes hardly touched her husband's hand in alight- ing, and ran up to her dressing-room. Her maid sat in the large toilet chair, sleepily awaiting her re- turn. She rose at her entrance. Agnes sank down into - the vacant seat, and submitted wearily to the touch of her languid fingers. Her brow burned and throbbed under its glittering tiara of gems; she felt a vague sense of relief when they were at length unloosed and cast aside. In the open casket before 'her, where her husband had thrown it, lay the note with its firm coldly traced lines which had cast such a leaden weight upon her heart. In the brilliant light of the lamp the closing lines gleamed up now before her. "May you be happy in the separate lot you have chosen." Days and weeks went by. They found the Mait- lands in a constant round of balls and entertain- ments. Agnes had little time for brooding over se- cret regrets. Lawrence grew to be a frequent visitant in their home; and for her husband's sake   AGNES STANHOPE.          45 Agnes strove to overcome her unreasonable preju- dices. Report soon proclaimed him on the eve of marriage with a rich heiress; but without any ap- parent cause the match was suddenly broken off, no little to the scandal of the curious gossips. Vague rumors there were in relation to his stay abroad, and of the causes of his prolonged absence; but they were neither very definite or positive. Agnes' curi- osity in vain strove to penetrate them. That her husband possessed some more distinct information on the point, was very clear to her; but his lips were closely sealed to her ingeniously guarded inquiries. "' Lawrence has been like most other young men of easy fortunes, a little careless, but he has quite sown his wild oats by this time," was all the reply she could elicit. Other events of more personal impor- tance soon drew her attention from the matter. A visit from Mrs. Moreton, quite unlooked for, and not altogether desired; for we have spoken before of the impression which in her- short stay at the cot- tage at Southsea, her new sister-in-law made upon Agnes' mind.                 .  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7555-00000023"/> CHPATER. IV. It was a dull, rainy day; lunch was just over, and Agnes stood at the dining-room window, watch- ing the large drops of rain which plashed upon the muddy pavement. "A quiet home evening," she said, pleasantly. I am glad, Maitland. Now I shall have you all to myself; not even Lawrence will venture out in this storm-and we will begin that new book. See, how the rain pours I " A hack which had been slowly rattling down the street, drew up suddenly at the steps. The driver got down to ring the bell. It is Alice," said Mait- land,- who- had drawn to the window at his wife's previous exclamation, and now caught a glimpse of the occupant of the carriage. He hurried down in- to the hall to welcome her. Agnes met her more slowly at the entrance of the dining-room. A cold kiss, and a few formal compliments passed between the ladies. Agnes soon withdrew to order a fresh lunch, and after some delay come back -to her guest. Mrs. Moreton's voice, in a slightly raised key, reached her as she laid her hand upon the door. "It must take a fortune to support such an estab- lishment, Howard. Where does it all come from?"   AGNES STANHOPE.        47 The flush on Maitland's cheek was the only reply; for the conversation turned abruptly at her entrance. Mrs. Moreton sat down to her lunch, and Agnes was soon absorbed in her duties of hostess. The meal over, Maitland recalled an engagement up town, and promising an early return, left their visit- or on his wife's hands. Agnes took her up to her own pleasant dressing-room, where a cheerful fire was glowing in the coal grate, made welcome by the dreary storm driving without. Mrs. Moreton sank into a capacious arm chair, while Agnes took a seat on the sofa opposite. How should she entertain her guest? What had taken Howard out of the way so inopportunately? Mrs. Moreton solved the difficulty. "You look pale, Agnes. Late hours, and fine London ways, I suppose. I wonder how Howard contrives to make such an appearance." Agnes looked up. Her attention was quickly aroused by the last clause. She colored a little. "I really am not very well acquainted with my hus- band's circumstances. I I supposed our way of living corresponded with his fortune." "He has none, my dear -that is, to say - he is living on expectations." "I know," said Agnes, shortlyj "at least, I re- member to have heard he was his uncle's heir." "Yes, so report goes. But poor Howard's heir-  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7555-00000024"/> 48      AGNES STANHOPE. ship is no settled matter; some cousin-german hardly heard of before may step into his place any day. Old men's favor, rich relatives especially, is apt to be so variable." "I was not aware Colonel Maitland was an old man," said Agnes. I saw him once a few years ago. He looked in the prime of life." "And so he is; only eight-and-forty - but then he is a confirmed old bachelor; and uncle Phillip never seemed young beside. I can't remember him hardly a year younger than he looks now. "He may marry, yet," said Agnes, quietly. "Strange things happen." "That's not likely, unless Howard disappoints him. He has some strange ideas. By the way, has Howard heard from him lately?" "No, I think not." Agnes moved a little unea- sily. A dim perception of her questioner's meaning began to break upon her. "He has some strange ideas." This marriage was not likely to be to his taste. The young wife felt, too, that she should not have been kept so utterly in the dark as to her hus- band's narrowed means. Mrs. Moreton seemed to see in her sister-in-law's disturbed face that she had said enough for the present. Both were silent, The ring at the door came at that moment very welcomely to Agnes' ear; and the servant's step the next moment on the stair.   AGNES STANHOPE.       49 Mr. Lawrence was below in the drawing-room. "Shall we go down?" "No, I am wearied. But I will not keep you. I can entertain myself very well in your absence." She took up the last new novel, which lay open on the dressing-table. Agnes lingered to give her hair a few touches, and then went down. I think a solitary tete-a-tete with Mr. Lawrence at any other moment would have been keenly felt to be a bore; but now, any change of company was welcome. The visitor could not but note the unu- sual cordiality of his reception, as he left the sofa and came eagerly towards her at her entrance. He led her back to the seat beside him, and they fell into an easy flow of conversation. Again, for the hundredth time, Agnes was fascinated by the riches of his cultivated mind, and again, for the hun- dredth time she ceased to wonder at the powerful influence which he plainly possessed over her hus- band. Fortunately, perhaps, for herself, the thought did not rise up in her mind, is not this man's friend- ship also of importance to me? Is he not my rival where I so utterly love and trust, and may not my thinly veiled coldness and distaste, by and by awak- en his enmity? But our poor Agnes was too little versed in the ways of the world as yet for such de- ductions. The long call came to an end at last, and Lawrence took his leave. Agnes went back to her guest.  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7555-00000025"/> 50      EAGNES STANHOPE. Mrs. Moreton gladly laid aside her book. "A wearisome - spun story; full of plot and counter- plot. I haven't patience to go on to the end." Agnes laughed. "Well, it is like life," she said. ' It is just as I see it here day after day, though on a smaller scale, striving to edclipse in show and beauty; striving after brilliant matches; striving for position; and who shall say," she went on more softly, " that now and then there are not real tragedies carried on under this light farce?" "Very likely," said Mrs. Moreton. "'It must be to you.  But you seem to take to it as if you were born and bred in it. How were you pleased with your visitor?" she asked, abruptly. "Mr. Lawrence?   O,I hardly know. Have you met him?" "Yes, years ago." "Before he went abroad," said Agnes, musingly. "He is Howard's dearest friend, I believe. Pray, what fancy led him to exile himself so long from his native land?"  She did not mean to reveal the eager curiosity which stimulated the question, but it broke in her eye, and through her voice. "Howard can tell you best, I suppose. I don't know much about him, and that little nothing to his credit." There is some mystery, thought Agnes. She turned over in her mind how to get at it, but just   AGNES STANHOPE.        51 then there seemed no approach. She began in an- other direction. "He is very fascinating. His mind is richly cultivated, and stored with travel." "No doubt. All I wonder is at Howard's infatu ation. But men in the world think lightly of vices." "( Has Mr. Lawrence any vices!" "He had, unless report was greatly at fault. An elopement with a beautiful lady, whose greatest fault seems to have laid in trusting a villain, made the country too hot to hold him, a few years ago. But it was years ago, and the story has blown over." Agnes shuddered. How could Maitland associate with such a man, and in the unreserved intimacy of friendship? "O, Mrs. Moreton!  And what became of the poor lady?" "I never heard. I have no sympathy, either, in such folly. She knew the end." Agnes sat in silent reflection. Here was the so- lution of her instinctive repugnance. This base, bad man.  And he her husband's chosen friend. Could she break the chain? She became suddenly aware that her sister-in-law was reading her, instead of the book she had put by, with her cold, inquisitive eyes. She tried to rally herself, and take up some in- different subject, but with only partial success. The shadow was still on her brow when Maitland came  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7555-00000026"/> 52      AGNES STANHOPE. in, but he was too preoccupied, for the first time, to observe it. He {seemed absorbed in the pleasure of his sister's arrival, but there was a little uncom- fortable gaiety about him, an over pressure of spirits, which could ill escape the eye of a wife. "This is like old times, Alice, to see you again in London, and under my own roof. But why did you not write to apprize us of your coming? Did you get my letter?" "Yes, it came in good time. But I did not make up my mind as to the visit until the last hour, So many household cares; and my maid, my servant of all work, as you remember,"-with a little nod and smile to Agnes, 1" so little to be trusted. I gave a hundred charges to my nursery girl, but still I have near as many fears that something will happen to Willie or Fanny in my absence. But for the im- perative duty of shopping, fifty things wanted for winter wear in such a family, I think I should have given up the undertaking, much as I wished to see you settled in your new home."  (The wife of a poor lieutenant in the Navy, who had almost given up the hope of promotion in the length of years he had looked forward to it, and who now struggled along with his large family on his scanty pay.) "I should think uncle Phillip might have some influence." Maitland expressed the thought upper- most -at that moment in his wife's mind.   AGNES STANHOPE.        53 "I don't know. So many are pressing forward who have powerful friends with the admiralty to urge their claims. Besides, you know uncle gave me a handsome dowry when we married; perhaps he thought he fulfilled all his duty then. Maitland was silent. Somehow the last words brought up a host of uneasy reflections. He roused himself shortly, however, and proposed to adjourn to the drawing-room, where Agnes would favor them with some music. The short autumn afternoon had come to a close, lights had already been brought in, and both ladies gladly assented to the change. Agnes strove to make the stay of her uninvited guest wear away as happily as circumstances would permit. She absented herself during the short week of her visit from two or three tempting balls to which invitations were issued; and accompanied her the few evenings which the state of the weather left open, to the opera and the theatre. A wearing round of shopping, a little diversified by drives in the park, took up the days, with morning tete-a-tetes in the cozy little dressing-room, which had become a favorite resort to the visitor as well as the host- ess. The days wore away at last. Mrs. Moreton said her formal good-bye, and the young couple were again left alone. Now was the opportunity for which Agnes had been eagerly longing to seek an explanation with her  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7555-00000027"/> 54:      AGNES STANHOPE. husband as to the real state of his finances, and the necessity of retrenchment; and to attempt the des- perate task of drawing him away from the intimacy which, to her anxious eyes, seemed to grow stronger every day. Both of these matters required a more ingenious diplomacy than the poor young wife was mistress of; and she turned over plan after plan in her mind, to cast it away in doubt and discourage- ment. Maitland's uneven spirits, his feverish gaie- ty, and fits of depression, were growing plainer eve- ry day; but her timid endeavors to elicit his confi- dence were put aside with playfulness, and  such light words of endearment as he might have used to a child. It stung her to the quick, this underrating of her claims to wifely confidence, but she lacked the courage to urge them, and to show him how his denial to let her share his burdens pained her. A feeling of delicacy, too, restrained her approaches. His uncle's silence, the real source of his uneasiness, was, she well knew, in consequence of their sudden marriage. Bertha's refusal to be reconciled to them had exposed to the whole world the secret of their shameful conduct. Well, she could but hope .that time would soften the old man's too just displeasure. If it failed -- she dared not think of it. And then again, what retrenchment could in reality be made, with all their mutual advising? They must give up their establishment, and come down to a lower kta-   AGNES STANHOPE.        55 tion, and Agnes shrank from this step as keenly as Maitland could have done. So the short December wore away, and Christmas came round with its week of festivities and reunions. No letter from Colonel Maitland. The ominous si- lence threw a deep gloom over the holidays, to the young couple. Howard had looked forward to the prospect of an invitation to Harrowdale, which had never before failed him at this season, and its non- arrival showed him, whqt he had already began to realize, the serious nature of this rupture with his uncle. How absurd thus to resent his rejection of a wife. And a feeling of anger towards Bertha, whose resolute refusal of their overtures, had set the matter in so decided'a light, crept in. Nearly four months had gone by since his hasty marriage, and many long weeks since his still unan- swered epistle had reached Colonel Maitland's hands. It might have been wiser to have written this delayed letter at once, but he had been strange- ly blinded to the importance of the matter; and, be- sides, he had hoped to draw some excuses from the manner in which his betrothed would receive his treachery. Most women in so delicate a matter, would have been eager to conceal the depth of their disappointmentofrom the world, by an outward for- giveness and reconciliation; he knew, too, the strength of the sisters' love for each other, and built  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7555-00000028"/> 56      AGNES STANHOPt. something upon that weakness, but Bertha had dis- appointed all his calculations. So, as we have said, the Christmas dawned drea- rily in their lonely home. To Agnes was added the pain of past days, and the picture of Bertha, alone and sorrowful, in the deserted rooms, where they had once been so happy together. She saw the hol- ly and evergreen wreathing the ancient portraits on the wall; she saw the vases of delicate green-house blossoms, filling the little parlor with their sweet perfume; she saw the glowing coal fire shedding warmth and brightness over all around---alas! over her vacant chair, and the pale, bowed face beside it. She saw the deepened furrows on the brow of the kind nurse, the old house-keeper's shadowed face, the old decrepid gardener's looks of sorrow, and even the mute sympathy   of the newer serving-maid. All these, but the last, had known her from her in- fancy, their young mistress, petted, worshipped al- most; and now her name had grown to be a forbid- den sound in that dear old home. She saw Bertha sitting there in her loneliness, the glossy black braids drawn back from her temples with their wonted care, the pretty, rich-hued winter dress, such as she was- wont to wear, with its graceful trimmings of Brus- sels lace ; her basket before her on the little work- table, giving listless employment to the unsteady -fingers; the pale cheek, the dark eyes dimmed with   AGNES STANHOPE&amp;       57 frequent tears. Alas, for the past! When would the day of reconciliation come? She threw a glance around the luxurious drawing-room in which she sat. Splendor such as her child-dreams alone might have fabled. - How long would it last? How soon would the day come when it must be relinquished? Her face bowed in her clasped hands. Her hus- band's step in the hall. She raised herself sudden- ly and strove to banish the cloud from her brow. He must not see her thus. She had begun to learn the hard lesson of concealment, to keep her griefs apart. She sprang up at his entrance and went to the piano. "Will you have some music, Howard?" "Yes, thank you ;" and he sat down to turn the leaves. If she could but gather courage to speak now; but her heart failed her, and, after all, of what avail could it be? She must wait stilL March had come,; the long, bright days of the dawning spring. A fragrant bunch of crocuses and violets brought this truth to Agnes, together with the warmth of a few sunny days, and the breath of soft winds. How cheerily the larks were singing now in the hedges at Hawthorndean! Agnes had opened at last the all-engrossing subject to her hus- band,-retrenchment: and he, divining somehow, her full knowledge of his perplexities, had replied, 4  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7555-00000029"/> 58       AGNES STANHOPE. he was about to write again to his uncle, and if the answer should be unfavorable, they would go down to the sea-side for a couple of months. He has pun- ished us long enough, he went on to say. His re- sentment, by this time, must have nearly blown over, and a new epistle will find him in a more prom- iseful frame of mind. Little enough to build upon, but Agnes did build upon it, and her increased cheerfulness communicated itself unconsciously to its author. So this bright March morning, she came down to the breakfast-room in unusual spirits. A light snow had fallen in the night, and the white wreaths still lingered en the pavements, slowly disappearing before the warm approaches of the sun. A vase of' yesterday's hot-house flowers stood on a little stand in the alcove of the window. She bent over them to inhale their sweet perfume, roses and heliotropes, the sweetest and fairest of all blossoms. The recol- lection of one of her girlish habits stole over her; it brought back, but just now with no pang, the early springs of Hawthordean, and she separated a few of the crimson buds from the bouquet for her hair and bosom. Maitland came in, and she took her seat at the table. His cheerful good morning, greeted her; the eye and smile wore the light of weeks ago, and her cheek reddened with a glow-of happy feeling as his pleased glance followed the roses in her dress   AGNES STANHEOPE.       59 and hair. The meal lingered in their pleasant talk; but at length Maitland pushed back his empty choc- olate cup, and took up the morning paper. He opened it, ran listlessly over a few paragraphs, read- ing, two or three, the latest court scandal aloud, then slowly turned to the long list of marriages and deaths. Suddenly his eye became rivited; in the next instant the paper slipped from his hand. Agnes' startled eye met his. "Howard, what is the mat- ter? How pale you are. What has happened?" "Happened!" he repeated, struggling to rally himself, and taking up the paper, "It must be a mistake--but no!"  He went back to the column of marriages. "At Hawthorndean, March third, by the Rev. Wallace Dean, Colonel Phillip Mait- land, of Harrowdale, Suffolk, to Bertha, eldest daughter of the late Captain Stanhope." It was Agnes turn to grow white and waver in her chair. A silence as of death fell in the room. Maitland was the first to speak. "She has played the game and won; checkmated us completely. The old man was in his dotage. What a fool I was not to have thought of it, and he admired her so much." Agnes still sat white and silent. He looked at her almost sternly. "What will become of us. I am overhead in debt, and not worth a hundred pounds in the world."  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7555-00000030"/> 60      AGNES STANHOPE. ,She wrung her hands despairingly. "What can be done. If I had the means I would buy a commission in the army. But it's of no use." A faint gleam of recollection broke through Agnes' despair. "You have a profession," she said. "Yes, but where shall I get practice. It's a wretched life, too, to be bound to, after idle years, and such expectations. What shall we do? We can't retrench a shilling, and there's nothing to go forward on besides. If Lawrence was here - but everything must go." He rose abruptly. Agnes made no movement to detain him. What could she say? To borrow of Lawrence  that would only procrastinate for a few weeks, and place them under obligations never to be repaid to the man she dis- liked. The worst had come. She heard her husband's step through the open door, pacing to and fro in the library. She rose to go to him, but suddenly sat down again. Alas, she had no consolation to offer.   CHAPTER V. How did this singular marriage come about? We go back to Bertha, whom we left at Hawthorndean, reading the chapter of consolation at the bedside of the dying, and striving in the duties of her humble lot to bear up under the wreck of the future. Little there seems to us in the monotony of so secluded a life to enkindle dead hopes, but she took up faithfully the labors nearest her hand, and waited for the morning which was to dawn, the morning which is often closer upon our night of sorrow than we dream. An invitation to spend the Christmas holidays at Colonel Maitland's country seat, reached her early in the week preceding, and with no little surprise she read over the kindly note, and the list of visitors attached, who had already accepted the hospitable invitation to become guests at Harrowdale, on that occasion. To refuse this well meant invitation was impossi- ble. The only objection which would have present- ed itself was removed in the list so delicately fur- nished; she saw that her false lover was for the first time excluded. The discovery gave her neither pleasure or regret. If a rupture had taken place  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7555-00000031"/> 62      AGNES STANHOPE. she had no idea it was irremediable. She well knew Colonel Maitland's strong attachment to his nephew. The excitement and novelty of the visit brightened up not a little her languid spirits. An expedition to the neighboring town was rendered necessary to replenish some wants in her neglected wardrobe; a dressmaker was brought in; and the rest of the week passed quickly, bringing the day on which the Colonel's carriage arrived to take her to Harrowdale. A most cordial reception awaited her from her host. She could but feel some constraint at first, from the consciousness that her painful story must be known to the assembled guests; but it soon wore off before the kindness and attention which univer- sally greeted her. The company which Colonel Maitland drew around him were of a character to warmly appreciate her talents and goodness, and setting aside the pain of old recollections, which a hundred things aroused in this familiar spot, Bertha had seldom known a week to pass more cheerfully. Of her host's rapidly growing partiality towards her she was at first wholly unconscious. The whis- pers which circulated round among the guests at the close of her stay, failed to reach her. Every one agreed that Miss Stanhope would make Colonel Maitland a  charming wife; that she was just suited for him. And after all there was not such an aston-   AGNES STANHOPE.       63 ishing disparity in their age. The Colonel was still in the prime of life, a handsome, fine looking man. This event would richly retaliate upon the nephew who had jilted her, too. It would cut off all his ex- pectations. On the whole, a more suitable match could not be planned. It was not until the day of her departure that a suspicion of the truth broke upon Bertha, speedily confirmed by the avowal which she was both sur- prised and pained to hear. They were alone in the little conservatory, whither the Colonel had taken her obviously to look at some rare plants, in flower, just received from London ; but in reality to improve a last opportunity forithe present of opening his suit. She bent over the little bunch of roses and gera- nium which she held in her hand, as his first low words reached her ear. " Bertha, I am at a loss how to make known a discovery I have just made. Your return to Hawthordean to-day has shown me, what, trembling at its hopelessness, I have tried to conceal from myself." He saw the shock of his announcement; but be- yond, her downcast face was hard to read. "Bertha, forgive me; I may have spoken too hastily - but I could not bring myself to let you go without a word. How much I reverence and love you words cannot tell. All my future is at your feet"--he stopped abruptly. "I see this subject  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7555-00000032"/> "      AGNES STANHOPE. is new, and painful to you now. Think it over, dear lady, I will not press you for a decision -weeks, months hence. Above all do not let these rash words destroy your confidence in me. If your heart still says no, with all the opportunity of time and my devotion, and dependence on you, let me still be your friend. I will then ask no more." Other steps echoed on the gravel path without; they came in, and the short interview was broken. Bertha was spared reply. Would his suit prove so hopeless after all? She asked herself the question as the carriage rolled away from the gates a few hours later, where she had met the farewell pressure of his hand, and read in the compressed lip and changing color how much hung upon her decision. Would it prove so hope- less? On the one side the loneliness of the future with its broken trust and bitter memories; on the other a position of wide usefulness as the mistress of Harrowdale, the honored and beloved wife of its no- ble master. Love for her. deceiver had utterly died out of her heart; it could not long survive the over- whelming proof of his falseness; but was she pre- pared to welcome another love? I think not. Re- spect and gratitude alone stood in the question. It was a thoughtful ride that long winter after- noon, through the snow-clad country back to Haw- thorndean. She saw nothing' of the picturesque beauty of the fields and woods by which they pass-   AGNES STANHOPE.        65 ed; the farmers' houses, the gray barns, the low- ing herds grouping around them in rural comfort. The glittering icicles, the white wreaths bending the thick boughs of fir and pine, the hillsides glittering in the red sun, the stray robins twittering from the underwood, all passed unheeded to her busy mind. The twilight of the short winter day had set in when she alighted at her home. The servants came to the door to welcome her, and she received with pleasure their hearty greeting. Then she went into the parlor, where kind Mrs. Robart had kindled a cheery fire. She looked up. Her eye caught the scarlet berries of the holly, and the fresh branches of the evergreen. Thoughtful hands had wreathed the old portraits as in the old time Christ- mas, and the vases on the table were crowded with the pale blossoms of the little green house. Tears came suddenly into her eyes. She felt the love which showed itself in these tokens of remembrance. But the vacant chair, the sense of loneliness, could not be put aside. She passed to the window, to look out on the distant churchyard lying in its white wreaths of snow. The marble tablets glistened dis- tinctly to her eyes in the soft rays of the stars which had come thickly out in the winter sky. "Would I were lying there beside you!" came not now to her lips. In that hour her decision was made. She would marry Colonel Maitland. 4* -          .        '  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7555-00000033"/> "      AGNES STANHOPE. A week later brought the now expected visitor to the cottage of Hawthorndean. Bertha came in to the little parlor to receive him with a little less than her accustomed ease; and the Colonel on his side was perceptibly embarrassed.  But soon the con- straint wore off, and they talked together with some- thing like the animation of old times. The subject uppermost in the minds of each was not broached between them till the Colonel rose to go. Then Bertha spoke,  "I have thought over the subject of our last conversation, Colonel Maitland. It is but right I should remove your suspense by an early answer."  She paused;  words would not come readily, but the anxious look riveted upon her, forced her to proceed. "If respect and gratitude can con- tent you" - he took eagerly the half proffered hand. "It is all I could ask. Time will give me more." Very fair to Colonel Maitland was that winter day, as he rode out of the park. He felt the keen exhilaration of the frosty air, and the solitude of the deep snows. The heavy boughs swayed down with their white wreaths, the untrodden fields shone in the sunset, and the groups of happy cottages lay in their still repose. The reins slipped loosely on his horse's neck, whose lively canter had subsided into a walk as he rode on. The future, how very beau- tiful it'was! A mistress for Harrowdale, and such a mistress, a true, beautiful woman, such as he had   AGNES STANHOPE.        67 dreamed of in his youth, but never thought to win. He thanked God reverently in his heart for this great blessing. And how strangely had it come to him through the unworthiness of another. The difference which this marriage must make in her sister's future did not at first enter into Bertha's reflections ; her decision, as we have seen, turning upon very different points. It was not until several weeks later that the question was brought up, when the wedding day had been fixed, and Colonel Mait- land made known the liberal settlement which, with the revision of his will he had made upon her She expressed her sense of this watchful care of her fu- ture, timidly, but gratefully. "I trust this marriage will make little difference in Howard's prospects?" she spoke with some embarassment; it was long since her lips had framed that name, and all the sub- jects connected with him had been mutually banish- ed from the conversation of both. "Not the slightest, my love. "All my connection with him closed months ago." Bertha looked up with very evident surprise. "I lo not understand you, Colonel Maitland. You have not discarded your nephew?" "Entirely. The man who could act so dishonor- able a part is no relative of mine." "But he is entirely dependent upon you." "There you are mistaken, my dear. Howard has  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7555-00000034"/> 68      AGNES STANHOPE. a profession, which should yield him a -liberal in- come." "But his profession is so crowded. Months may go by before he can rise into practice." "He has some inherited property." Bertha was silent, but not convinced. Colonel Maitland kindly took her hand. "Do not hesitate, my love, to trust me with your thoughts. The matter is simply this: The event of my mar- riage, in any case, must make an important change in Howard's expectations. The liberal allowance I have hitherto granted him would prove altogether insufficient for the support of a family--fashionable London life, an establishment, balls, dinners, dress; to say nothing of servants. The sooner he realizes that he is thrown upon his own resources the better. He has talent, unquestionably; and a thorough cul- ture in his profession, though its practice has been so entirely neglected. The struggles and anxieties of this new life are what he needs. Who shall say" he added, with a faint smile, "that the day may not yet come when he shall prove worthy our forgive- ness." "-God grant it!" returned Bertha, fervently; but a troubled feeling still lingered at her heart. This rough path -must be trodden also by Agnes, her sis- ter who had been so tenderly guarded and cherish- ed, and who was still so dear to her with all her cruel ingratitude.   AGNES STANHOPE         69 Colonel- Maitland spoke again. "My dear Ber- tha, banish this shadow from your brow. Let us leave them in His hand who will bring us all safely together in the end." She strove to obey him; and with a brightening smile turned to the future, the future which was so close at hand. A bright March morning ushered in their solemn bridals in the gray old church of Hawthorndean. The aged rector had pronounced the funeral rites over both her parents, had sprinkled the waters of baptism on her own infant forehead; and with a deep sense of the solemnity of this hour, Bertha knelt with her husband before him for his closing benediction. In the church was a curious group of villagers, in their holiday dress, drawn thither to witness the ceremony; and many a prayer and' blessing arose from lowly hearts, as she passed down the aisle, on her way to the carriage, leaning on the arm of her noble looking bridegroom. Here, in the churchyard, were young girls with baskets of spring flowers, which they strewed with downcast eyes in her path, close beside which rose the white- lettered monuments of those long lost parents whose joy would have so hallowed this day. Did not their benediction hallow it even now from their homes of larger light. Maitland took in with an eager glance, the homage and reverence which  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7555-00000035"/> 70      AGNES STANHOPE. breathed around him. This offering of the simple villagers was dearer to his bride than the most glit- tering pageant, or the favor of royalty. God help- me to make myself worthy of so true a wife, was breathed silently from his heart. They knew not, the newly wedded pair, that the bell which in the old belfry now sent forth its joyous peals far and wide, over the green fields and peace- ful hamlets, rang out the knell of that marriage by the lonely shore of Southsea, the plighted vows of that dull September day, so lately come and gone; which had brought these two together, youth and middle age, in a union now on the one side of grati- tude and respect, but which was to deepen into a true tie of heart and soul as the years crept on, an election for eternity. Agnes, in her London drawing-room, lounging through the tediousness of morning visitors, felt the sudden chill, she- knew not why, and saw as in a glance the gray old church of Hawthorndean, and her sister's face. Maitland felt it, as he sauntered in the park, by the side of his friend, and Lawrence turning round for a reply to some unanswered word, caught with surprise the pale face and rivited eye. It was gone in an instant from them both, this vision at the turning point of their destiny. Agnes came back to her listless tete-a-tete; and Maitland lifted his hat to a gay lady who looked out to meet his   AGNES STANHOPE.       71 companion's smile from a carriage which passed them. But the bell pealed on, and to its happy chimes the prancing horses drove past the quietly embowered home Bertha was leaving behind her for a wider sphere, and another lot. On the wide piaz- za grouped the servants, who had come back from the church by a shorter path, and who watched through tears, blended with pride and thanks with- all, the carriage bowling away in the distance. It was a dim view outlined through the rugged boughs of the opening in the park. "Blessings on our sweet lady, and may her future be better than her past!"

Here we find Maitland and Agnes; the splendor of the past months gone like the mists of a dream, and homely realities begun. Yes, all had gone; the rich furni- ture, the waiting servants, and the eclat of society. Narrow, meagrely furnished rooms, simple viands, and one domestic, who fulfilled the duties of maid, cook, and laundress, under Agnes' unskilled eyes,; replaced all the luxuries which had grown to be ne- cessities. It was a hard change ; and they both felt it keenly; Maitland most. He felt, too, the humili- ation of the circumstances which had cast him back upon his neglected profession for his daily bread. Bertha had repaid him ten fold the mortificationof her disappointment. He shrank from his late asso- ciates, feeling that his story was upon every lip; and in the great wilderness of London, in the new life he had now entered upon, they seldom crossed his path. His mornings were spent in the court room, and the remainder of the day, with the early evenings, at his office, which he had taken in a   AGNES STANHOPE.       73 business part of the city. Little of the old leisure was left for home enjoyments, but there was nothing very tempting now in the picture of the low dining- room, with its brown walls and chintz covered chairs, and the pale face which to his eyes was already be- ginning to lose its beauty under the pressure of care and grief. So they parted and met at the early breakfast and the late dinner, with little said on either side, but with a dreary despondency deepen- t ing in the hearts of both. Maitland was not gener- ous enough to forego secret regrets at the rash step which had plunged them both into ruin. Harassed by creditors, straitened in the means to meet even their lessened expenses, and knowing well all the silent waiting and labor required in the overflowing profession in which he was struggling for a place, his temper grew sullen and variable. "You are changed, Howard," said Agnes, one evening, as they sat together in their usual silence. "In what have I been so unfortunate as to displease you?." -"You have not displeased me, Agnes. It is the hard uncertainties of the to-morrow which make me gloomy and thoughtful." Agnes laid her hand gently upon his arm. "Let us share them together, Howard. It will lighten them; it will strengthen us both." "My poor child I you too, have known the bur-  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7555-00000037"/> 74      AGNES STANHOPE. dens of the day." A kindlier expression stole over his grave face. "I would have made your path one of roses, Agnes, but destiny has decreed other- wise."  She smiled. "At least our lot is bound together. I am happy in that." He was silent. In the presence of her simplicity and truth, words would not come at the instant to his lips. She turned towards him, struck by the pause. A vivid glow flushed up her cheek at his hesitation. "You do not, Howard--surely you cannot regret." He took her hand. "My love, I confess I was selfish. I should have waited; I should have taken up my profession, and made some progress in it, be- fore I prayed you to share this future." Her eyes fell. The deep glow faded away into an ashy pale- ness. He saw the pain he had given; but his pride would not suffer him to retract. The maid came in at that moment to ask direc- tions for the morrow, which Agnes in her pre-occu- pation had forgotten. Both felt the interruption to be a relief. Agnes rose, and followed her in silence to the kitchen. Maitland took up the evening pa- per. The truth would come out sometime, he mut- tered, moodily. Agnes and riches--but Agnes and poverty - they never were meant to be mated. Still, she tries to bear up bravely, poor girl, I ought to remember that.   AGNES STANHOPE.  Months wore on; and the midsummer came round. Confinement and care began to tell upon Agnes' spirits and health. She missed her daily drives and walks in the park; and the pleasant ex- citement of familiar faces. Shut out from all com- panionship ; her husband moody and silent; the gloom around her deepened day by day.   She longed in the murky atmosphere of the sultry city for a breath of fresh country air. Why could they not go down to the sea shore for a week? she would ask Maitland. They need not select any of the frequented resorts. No doubt cheap lodgings could be procured at some out of the way place. She put her design in execution that very evening, after the late meal was over, and they sat together in the lonely dining-room, which in their narrowed circumstances comprised in itself also parlor and drawing-room. Maitland dropped the paper which he held listlessly in his hand. "It is quite impossi- ble, Agnes. I am wholly destitute of means. I don't know where the money to meet even-this week's bills is coaling from. My credit is ex- hausted." She looked up anxiously. "Is it so bad as that. What is to be done?" "' I must write to Lawrence. It is a mortifying resource, but I know of no other." She shuddered.  All her old repugnance seemed  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7555-00000038"/> 76    e  AGNES STANHOPE. to rush upon her with ten-fold force. She looked at her husband's contracted brow, and noted his ab- sorbed air. She saw he was in no mood to meet opposition, but at the risk of angering him she must speak. "Is that the last resource? Why not wait a few days? Some important case may come in;: something occur to save this humiliation.' "That is hopeless. I have waited, and waited. - Lawrence is in London ; he has returned from Suf- folk; that I gathered by inquiry to-day." "He may not wish to remember us in our pov- erty. O Maitland, if I dared to speak. Something whispers to me that this is the turning point in our lot; heed it, believe it, for my sake, for your own." "Foolish child. Why this unreasonable preju- dice? Are you jealous even of your husband's friend?" "I am jealous of his, influence over you, Howard. I believe him to be a base, bad man." He sat looking at her in mingled astonishment and anger. Such bold words from those lips here- tofore so timid and yielding, and in a connection which she well knew must touch him keenly. "From what do you draw your opinion, Agnes?" he asked, at length, with a covert sneer. ( From his wicked past." Maitland started. "What have you heard? Who has told you those idle stories?"   AGNES STANHOPE.       " "Your own sister, Howard. You will not deny her truth." Curses upon, Alice's intermeddling.  Why couldn't she let those past years rest. "Well, Agnes," he said aloud, and coming back to the first subject, "there is no choice. I am hard pressed, and have no other way to look. An application for a few hundred pounds will try at least the sincerity of Lawrence's friendship.. He may refuse; and then your mind will be at peace." "Why not wait a few days?" she took up the old answer. "I have already told you," he said doggedly. " It is just like woman's ways of understanding business, Wait a few days and you will be without shelter and without bread." He took up the paper he had thrown down, to check the rejoinder he saw upon her lips. "I can't think it is so bad as that," she said. The creditors must wait; and a few weeks, a few days even, may bring about a change. It is always darkest just before day. If a valuable case would only come in." It's  of no use," he retorted, impatiently. " I have waited weeks and months; and I have come to a decision. A few hundred pounds, if they can be procured, will set us right for the present; and if fortune should turn, so much the speedier their repayment."  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7555-00000039"/> 78     [ 'AGNES STANHOPE. i-e unfolded the paper, and turned to a new col- umn with an air which said decidedly that the sub- ject was at an end. Agnes sighed. She looked sorrowfully at the bare walls and scanty furniture. When the crash of their expectations came she had said the worst has come; but what was that dark day beside the undefinable forms which were silently gathering shape in the future? If Lawrence would only re- fuse. "You were wrong, Agnes. See, could anything be more kind!" and with a lighter step and smooth- er brow than he had worn for weeks, Maitland en- tered- the dining-room where Agnes stood looking for his approach from the window, and placed the open note in her hand. A few gracefully written lines, thanking him for the confidence in his friend- ship which had brought about this late application; a promise to call at his office on the morrow, the whereabouts of which he had just succeeded in dis- covering; and an allusion to an enclosed check for a hundred pounds.   Maitland had forgotten his wife's opposition of the previous evening in the re- lief which this prompt reply afforded him. A disa- greeable recollection came back now at her silence and downcast looks as she put the letter back into his hand."  "I was a fool, Agnes, to think that anything of pleasure to myself must of course be   AGNES STANHOPE.        79 gratifying to you. In the height of your silly pre- judices you forget your interests. But for this timely help you might be homeless to-morrow." He spoke suddenly, and with warmth. (- Better homeless than under obligations to him. Maitland, I tremble at your infatuation!" "Foolish, unreasonable girl." He turned from her angrily, without deigning further reply. The maid came in with the steamning viands, and they took their places at the board. The meal passed in silence; and when it was ended Maitland turned to his usual resource, the evening paper. Still the sense of relief was too great for the indulgence of such a mood, and when Agnes a little later, feeling that she had spoken hastily, ventured some timid question, he met her advance kindly, and soon the irritation of their little 'quarrel seemed to have passed from the remembrance of both. Maitland laid by his paper, and watched his wife's busy fin- gers, as she toiled over some useful article of dress, for embroidery and music were now banished from her homely life; and the evening passed more like the happy past in London than they had known for many months. I could be happy even here, thought Agnes, as she sought her pillow that night, if Howard would be only like himself. Strengthened by his love I could bear the cares and labors of the present in the  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7555-00000040"/> 80      AGNES STANHOPE. certainty of better days. After all, why should I so distrust Lawrence's friendship for my husband. There may be some good lingering in his heart. This loan, as Howard says, looks disinterested, for he well knows how far off must be its repayment. The meeting between the two friends, which took place early on the noon of the morrow, was fraught with deep embarrassment at its commencement to Maitland. He could not but feel the changed cir- cumstances between their parting; and. the heavy obligations he had been compelled to crave at the hand of his friend. Lawrence's hearty greeting, and his gentle reproaches at his long silence, did much to restore his self-possession. Lawrence took the seat pressed upon him, and when the first excitement of their interview had subsided, gently led the way to the subject upper- most in Maitland's thoughts, the painful entangle- ment of his affairs. ' I am well nigh discouraged, Lawrence. My practice, in which I am altogether new, brings me in next to nothing; and my uncle's favor is hopelessly gone." "You look on the dark side of things," said his friend, quietly contemplating the wan and care lined face before him. Wi "Who wouldn't look on the dark side with a. wife to support beside one's own expenses, and not worth a penny?"   AGNES STANHOPE.        81 ( A hard case," said Lawrence, musingly. "You have paid dear for your love match." "Yes, I was a fool. But who would have dream- ed the old man would have stepped into my place? Yes, all is gone." "Not so bad as that, I hope. The Colonel's new wife may die, only a life between you and your old expectations; or the Colonel himself may follow the course of nature, and the chances are that he has not altered his will such matters are so generally neg- lected, or has drawn up something that with proper care can be set aside." "No hope of that. You don't know the man. He is only too prompt." "Well, all that granted, something may turn up. The lady is vindictive, no doubt; but you have stood in his favor too long to be put aside at once; for a mere trifle, too." "Yes, there's the sting of it. To be hurled back on my profession, which is crowded full al- ready-checkmated completely by a woman!" "You havn't written him yet?" said Lawrence, going back to the first part of his observation. "No; not since his marriage.  What purpose would it answer?" "A proper representation of your affairs might draw a liberal remittance." 5  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7555-00000041"/> 82      AGNES STANHOPE. "Never. I would starve first. Beg his bounty- never!" "Every one toq his taste," said Lawrence, with the- slightest perceptible smile. He'll come round to it by-and-by, he muttered, in an undertone to himself "'The Colonel loved you as a son once, Howard; and trust me he hasn't forgotten the old feeling still. By the way, Howard, you used to have skill at ecarte. Do you never play now?" Maitland startled. The question brought up a train of new thought. "Not for years.' Not twice since you went abroad, Lawrence.' "It's a good time to rub up your old practice." He took out his costly gold wateh, with its massive seal. "It is growing late, and I have an important engagement.  Howard, if you want a couple of hundred more I can accommodate you. No thanks. I have had a run of luck lately. There, adieu, adieu." Generous, kind, thought Maitland; as he opened Blackstone, and settled himself again to his morn- fng reading. How shall I repay his advances,? He knows too how hopeless my circumstances are. Plodding day after day over these musty books, which will not give me back hardly a meagre liv- ing; harassed with clamoring creditors - he looked at a little pile of roughly scrawled notes before him which had come in that morning. Lawrence   AGNES STANHOPE.       83 has plenty, and yet he has run through a fine for- tune. Why not try the faro table, too? He sat thoughtful, his eyes wandering from the page be- fore him. There will be Agnes, the little saint, {with her pale face and troubled looks. Well, what of it? I'm a ruined man. I was a fool to marry such a doll, with her pretty face, and simple ways. She has had a hard lot, too, poor thing. A few hundred pounds would lift us both out of this pov- erty. Maitland was late that evening. Agnes waited and watched with many misgivings, and the echo of his step on the path lifted a load from her heart. She hurried to the door to meet him. The unusual kindliness of the morning lingered in his smile and voice. He drew her to the seat by the window as they entered the lighted dining-room. "You look weary, Agnes - stay, do not call Mary; I am in no haste for dinner. I have such pleasant news. My poor child, how pale you have grown. This con- finement is killing you. But it shall last no longer. See." He unfolded a heavy roll of bills he held in his hand. "O' Howard! A case come in at last. What did I tell you; what did I tell you only yesterday. Now Lawrence can be repaid at once. Now no more gloomy days." He could not damp her joy. He could not draw  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7555-00000042"/> AGNES STANHOPE. upon himself her prayers and tears. He let her go on, though her simple words brought the hot blush of shame to his brow. "You will be distinguished, Howard; you are so talented, so gifted. Now your fortune is opening you will rise fast. They will be proud to own us yet." And her thoughts crept on to the far off day, which he who stood by her side was never to know on earth; when a full reconciliation with Bertha, and the renewed love of old days, should complete her happiness. She sat with clasped hands, and radiant face, too busy in her fill thoughts to feel the meaning of her husband's silence. He spoke at last. "We will go into new lodg- ings to-morrow, Agnes. The sooner we quit this dreary place the better. Not in London again "- as her questioning look met his, "but out on the East Road. We can get a handsome cottage there, with furniture to suit; which will save a world of trouble and time. I must look up the new servants, I suppose; Mary can go with us." "She will still do for the present," Agnes sug- gested, timidly. "You haven't an overflowing cof- fer yet, Howard. Part of this must go to the cred- itors, you know; and a little for the chances of further waiting." "Spoken like you, my dear. You are a prudent counsellor, and may be right. But the rainy days are over, and we shall now have enough."   AGNES STANHOPE.   The maid came in at that moment with the first course of the delayed meal; and the conversation dropped. A few days saw Agnes established in her new home; and at first her happiness in this sudden restoration of their prospects, and her husband's brightening mood, was unclouded and full. But this, in the dangerous career on which Maitland had now fully entered, could be of but short continu- ance. The truth must come out sometime as to the source from whence this new supply was drawn, and this fact Maitland well knew. It did come out on his first change of luck. An unguarded expression, which he regretted the moment it had left his lips. Agnes looked at him in hopeless dismay. For an instant she tried to disbelieve her own sense of hear- ing, but his averted face, and visible agitation con- firmed it too well. "Howard! where does this money come from? You have not deceived me I Surely it is not drawn from the gaming table? Speak to me. Answer me"I He rallied, and faced her. "I have not deceived you, Agnes. I have suffered you to draw your own conclusions." "O,.Maitland, has it come to this?" "And what if it has?"His quick temper chafed into bitterness at the inexpressible anguish which  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7555-00000043"/> 86      AGNES STANHOPE. breathed in her voice. "Am I worse than a thou- sand others? I tell you, Agnes, we might starve for all the practice I should get in a twelvemonth." "But the end, the end! If you win now, you will lose by-and-by. O I Maitland, give it up, and come back to the old life. For my sake, if you have any love left for me ; I would toil with you day and night. Come back to your profession-with so much talent you must, you will, succeed. O, for my sake!"She sunk down before him in the eagerness of her appeal. "Curses upon a woman's tongue! Agnes, I will have no more of this. I have chosen my way, and you must share it, or we must part. Rise; I will hear no more. I have irritations enough to chafe me without; in my home, so long as I have a home, I will have peace." She rose, and sunk down on the sofa. His harsh words seemed to send the blood back from her white face to curdle at her heart. Here was the explana- tion of the long evenings when she had waited for his coming, deepening twice or thrice even into the still midnight; the unsteady nerves, the growing pre-occupation. Here was an explanation beyond what her most restless fears could have suggested. He made no attempt to soften the anguish of the shock, or the pain of his cruel words. She still sat silent; and he rose presently and went out, closing the door heavily after him. She was, left alone with her great grief.   CIIAPTER VII The entrance of her maid roused Agnes from her stupor. She looked up, and shrank from the curi- osity which she fancied she read in the girl's eyes. "Master said he forgot to tell you he had company to dine. He sent me up to help you dress." Agnes started. Company to dine I t was a new event. "Did he mention their names?" "No, marm. He seemed hurried like." "' Well, it's of no importance." She rose and seat- ed herself languidly before her mirror. Lawrence, no doubt. But I must do honor to Maitland's guests while he has a home. Oh, has it come to this? -"What will you wear, my lady?" Agnes threw a glance into the mirror. The last touch had been given to the glossy braids. O, I am not particular. I leave it to your choice, Lucy." The girl took from the closet a pale, rose colored silk, with rich trimmings of soft lace, and Agnes suf- fered herself to be arrayed in it. "A few rosebuds for your hair, my lady." But Agnes put out her hand impatiently, to prevent her movement to touch the bell. "It isn't worth while, Lucy. It is grow-  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7555-00000044"/> AGNES STANHOPE. ing late, too. I shall keep the guests waiting. Yes, there is the street bell," and she rose to go down. They were ushered at once into the dining-room, where Maitland awaited them. She heard Law- rence's voice as she paused on the last stair. His low, even tones reached her through the open door. She shuddered as if a serpent had crossed her path, but she went quietly on. Lawrence quitted his host and hurried forward to meet her at her entrance, with the same courtly self- possession, and the same glow of eager pleasure breaking over his dark face, and breathing in his low toned compliments, as in the splendor of their Lon- don life. She bowed to his courtesies, with scarcely a reply; and turned to the other guests, Major Oak- ley and Mr. Stanwood. Culled from Maitland's new associates; so she thought as she took in the swar- thy, unprepossessing features of the first, and the more youthful, and perhaps on that account, less strongly marked physiognomy of the latter. She said a few courteous words, such as it was her prov- ince as. hostess to say, to each; and very shortly the dinner bell rang, and they took their places at the board. Maitland's eye carefully avoided hers; he laughed and talked with a strained vivacity, which grated painfully onher ear. Major Oakley talked of horse-racing; a famous match was to come off the next week-discussed the merits of favorite mares,   AGNES STANHOPE.   on one of which he had a heavy bet; and told of an invitation he had to go down to Wiltshire, to spend the dusky October in the recreations of grouse shoot- ing and fox hunting . Wiltshire, a name which by its nearness to her old home, stirred not a little Ag- nes' trembling pulses, and made Maitland start un- easily; while Lawrence labored to bring the conver- sation round to subjects more interesting to his fair hostess, and Stanwood only spoke when his opinions were appealed to. The meal dragged through at length, and Agnes gladly left the gentlemen to their wine, and went into the drawing-room. She sat dOwn to the piano, and touched a few mournful keys. The music rose and died away. Its notes seemed wrung out of the anguish of her own troubled heart. The door softly opened, and Lawrence entered. She looked up in surprise. "You have left your compa- ny early, Mr. Lawrence." Yes, Major Oakley's refined conversation has no particular attraction for me." "He is a new friend of Howard's, I presume. Have you known him long?" "No, not until very recently." He bent over her, carelessly turning the leaves of the music book." It is very long since we have met, Mrs. Maitland. I regret that Howard's temporary change of circum- stances should have made him distrustful of his ol.1 friends." 5*   &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7555-00000045"/> 90       AGNES STANHOPE. "The friendships of the circle in which we moved a few months ago seldom outlive prosperity," said Agnes, quietly. "But, my dear Mrs. Maitland, surely my case did not enter into this hard rule?" She was silent. "' Friends in youth," he went on, "in school days when the strongest ties are formed, warmly welcom- ed in his memory after years of absence, I cannot but feel wounded at the lack of confidence which should delay so long to seek me under such painful involv- ments." "If Howard had listened to me," said Agnes, calmly, "he would have righted his circumstanbs without application to his friends. At least, I be- lieve so. He has a profession, talent, health-what could he require more? Their eyes met. They understood each other. Agnes' look fell first. That steady, unwavering glance sent a cold chill through her frame. For the first time she felt the power of the man who stood arrayed against her, his unfathomable spirit, his im- penetrable resources. The room swam before her; a dizzy ringing was in her ears. "' Mrs. Maitland, will you favor me with some mu- sic? It is long since I have heard you play." The lines which spread indistinct before her on the sheet she had sung at happy Hawthorndean, to her sister's lover, her voice keeping time with Bertha's; never since.   AGNES STANHOPE.       91 She rose. "Excuse me. I am not quite well to-day. The air is hot. It oppresses me." She went to the window and threw it open. The cool September breeze swept over her temples. It came laden with the scent of the roses, the late au- tumn roses in the garden. They were blossoming now in all their glory around the porch of the de- serted cottage of Hawthorndean. Lawrence follow- ed, and took a seat opposite. "My dear Mrs. Maitland, I am deeply pained by your suspicions." "I am at a loss to understand you, Mr. Law- rence." She spoke in a low voice, her cheeks sud- denly flushing. The language of evasion or false- hood was new to her lips. She trembled at his daring speech. He had fathomed her thought, and she shrank from the consequences of the explanation about to open. He went on guardedly: "My dear lady, I crave your forgiveness. But I know into what an unfortunate step Howard's entangled affairs have plunged him, and I could not but feel, in view of your last words, that in your heart some blame might attach to me.' She made no reply. "It is a step much to be regretted," he went on; a vice which freely indulged in, deepens and strengthens upon its votaries. But in his case there are some excuses. Howard is utterly discouraged; I never saw a more deeply dispirited man."  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7555-00000046"/> 92      AGNES STANHOPE. "You never play, Mr. Lawrence?" "Now and then, not habitually." Her open face showed the disbelief she felt. An- expression too dimly outlined to be read, crept over his smooth brow. "You may have influence to save him." The poor wife colored. I hope so." ("You have my earnest wishes, Mrs. Maitland; my help, if in anything you may command me." He stopped. ("Do you think this secluded way of living has no influence over Howard? He is fitted for society." "It may deepen his discouragement."  The thought struck her in a new light. "But we have no choice. A return to former associations is im- possible." A subdued light kindled in his eye. "There are others who would be happyto know Mrs. Maitland. Not quite among the elite to whom you hesitate to return, yet hardly second in intelligence and refine- ment." Her questioning look met his. Its doubt and thinly veiled suspicion, his careless eye caught at a glance. "Judge for yourself, my dear Mrs. Mait- land," he said, with his most winning smile. "And pardon me if I presume to remind you that this total seclusion acts also upon your own spirits, and deepens your anxieties while watching over your husband's course."   AGNES STANHOPE.       93 There was certainly an air of truth in these words. She pondered them thoughtfully. The motive which dictated this new move was hard to fathom. That he had secretly tempted Maitland into the very course he now openly condemned, she had an intui- tive perception. The faint echo of a movement reached them from the dining-room. The guests had at last quitted their wine, and risen to join them. Maitland came in, his step un- steady, and his face flushed. He had been trying to forget his losses in drink. Lawrence looked at Agnes; her white cheek and fixed eye showed that the discovery was simultaneous to both.. Major Oakley threw himself into a seat beside his hostess with easy familiarity. The glasses of champagne he had drained had only exhilarated his more accustom- ed brain. She shrank from his rough attempts at compliment, and drew away the folds of her dress as if there were a sense of contamination in his con- tact. Lawrence's cool eye followed her movement. Stanwood, who had somehow passed the cup which had overtaken his companions, made an attempt to start some indifferent subject. Lawrence spoke. "Your garden looks tempting, Mrs. Maitland. Shall we not leave these gentlemen to their discus- sion for a nearer view of those roses on the terrace?" She yielded, gladly; anything, even Lawrence's arm, and a twilight tete-a-tete, for an escape from a position which thrilled every nerve with disgust.  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7555-00000047"/> "      AGNES STANHOPE. They sauntered out in the September sunshine, in the fresh air of the garden. Lawrence was silent at first, in evident respect to his companion's mood, and when he did speak it was with no relation to the scene they had quitted. The glory of the sunset, with the quiet loveliness of the little scene, brought up his wanderings in foreign lands, and impercepti- bly Agnes found herself listening and replying. They went back at length, when the shadows had begun to deepen, and the dew had dampened the short grass. They found the drawing-room quite deserted; the gentlemen had returned to the (dining- room. Agnes sighed. Through the closed door she caught the loud murmur of voices, and fancied she could distinguish also the rattling of dice. The room was now quite dark, and she rang impatiently for- the servant to bring lights. Lawrence saw that his fair hostess longed to be alone, and pleading an engagement for not rejoining the company, gravely took his leave. Maitland came up late to his chamber. Agnes had paced the floor to and fro through the long hours into midnight, and- had just thrown herself up- on her pillow when his step sounded upon the stairs. He came up. slowly, heavily. She closed her eyes as he entered, feigning the sleep which was banished from them. "Curses on my luck!" he muttered, as he paused   AGNES STANHOPE.        95 at the window, and stood with knit brow and clench- ed hand in the moonlight, which made a broad sheet on the floor. "Curses on my luck I I was a fool to play with Oakley, and with such an unsteady hand. It maddens me. The more he drinks the surer he wins." He threw a glance toward the sleeper. The pale brow and silent breathing attracted him for an instant. His brow knit into a heavier frown, and the words went on silently in his thoughts. Here is the hinge on which my 'fate turned. A pretty face. Lawrence was right. I have paid dear for my love match,  He broke off from his reflec- tions, and turned to seek the pillow which to him, too, had ceased to be one of repose. They met at the breakfast table the next morn- ing, the unhappy couple, in gloomy silence. In Agnes'"heart the cruel words of the previous day deeply rankled. The anguish, too, of her terrible discovery was still fresh. She waited in silence for the apology which she felt that Maitland's still lin- gering love would endeavor to frame. Here would be an opening for more successful remonstrances. If after all, Lawrence would be true to his words, and help her to retrieve" his friend's false step, some- thing might be hoped. 'She forgot that the rush of this new vice, with its low associations and bitter reverses, might soon dethrone her from the heart where she had superseded another.  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7555-00000048"/> 96      AGNEs STANHOPE. But the breakfast passed in silence; the early morning waned into the late noon, and no symptoms of relenting appeared. She saw him go out in the gray dusk, as the evening crept on, and, she knew that for her waited another long night of sorrow- ful vigils and tears. "Up still, Agnes?"  His voice had a stern breath of reproach in it, as he paused in the hall. She had come down from her chamber to watch from the dining-room window the lonely street. "Yes, Howard. It is so late, I could not sleep. I have been wrung with anxieties for you." "A curse on your officiousness," he muttered, as he reeled up the stairs. Yes, his step was unsteady, and his brow hot. He had sought the leathe of the wine cup for his losses. She saw that. What shall I say to him? How shall I plead with him? She sunk down upon her knees, and the first prayer of many a long day broke from her lips. " O my God, strengthen me ; help me!" Without, the moonlight flooded the deserted streets, gilding the roof of many a peaceful home; within, in the chamber above, the gambler slept his heavy slumber, while in this room below, still on her knees, the unhappy wife lingered' with her face bowed in her hands.         X   CHAPTER RV1I, AN invitation to a dinner patty, Agnes tossed the note carelessly to her husband. A week had gone by, and that mornimg had seen something like a dim revival of their old harmony; inot sufficient, however, to justify the opening of the hopeless sub- ject which lay nearest the wife's heart. He glanced over it with an expression of sutprise, 'The Lang- ley's." "You know them?" said Agnes wonderingly. 4 Yes, I have' met TLangley abroad several times; Mrs. Langley once.   We will go, Agnes." She would have liked some further questions, but he now rose abruptly, and went out of the room. She well knew to whom   she was indebted for this courtesy, and of Mr. Langley's character and standing she entertained no doubt. The friend of Lawrence, the associate of Maitland in his downward path, what further information was needed. But the note lay before her, Maitland tiad signified his acceptance, and she had no choice,  The urgent necessity of change, too, pressed upon her. She would go, The carriage came late.

Three or four streets were passed when they drew up be- fore a large brick mansion. Maitland alighted, and giving his hand to assist her out they passed up the broad stone walk. They were late. The guests were all assembled when they entered the drawing- room; some eighteen or twenty gentlemen, with a sprinkling of ladies. Their hostess came forward to receive them. Their reception was gracious, even cordial, but it was such as would have been accorded to a host of indiscriminate visitors. Ag- nes could but feel the contrast between this and her first London reception. She was no longer the beau- 1iful Mrs. Maitland, heir expectant to some thou- sands per annum, she was only the wife of an ob- scure barrister, struggling along under his hard for- tunes with the help of the gaming-table. Maitland soon left her to join an acquaintanoe whom he had recognized in a distant part of the room, and for a few moments she found herself quite alone among strange faces. Lawrence whom she had noticed at their entrance as forming one of the party, now drew near, and took the vacant seat at her side. He expressed his delight at seeing her in a low tone, and entered with his usual ease into the common places of the day. Agnes answered absently, her eyes followed her husband, she could but feel the chill of his sudden neglect. His eyes   AGNES STANHOPE.       99 and thoughts seemed absorbed in his companion; and she turned upon her a glance of startled interest, A still young, and strikingly beautiful woman, ar- rayed with unusual elegance, so her first look said, but the second thrilled her with that strange blend- ing of dread and repugnance which had marked her first meeting with the man who now sat at her side. Even at the distance she fancied she saw a wierd light in the flash of the large dark eye, and caught a shadow of something indefinably stern and cruel in the sweetness of the smile which hovered around the red lips. She is very, very beautiful. How charmed Maitland is. Strange that he has not men- tioned this new acquaintance to me. And the first pang of incipient doubt thrilled her as she took Lawrence's arm to the dining-room. They sat at some distance from them, lower down the table, her husband and this new friend who seemed for the time to have wholly superseded herself. Law- rence noticed her uneasy preoccupation, and his eye followed heas. "Maitland is more like himself to- night than I have seen him for months. Mrs. Per- cival is very fascinating." "Who is Mrs. Perci- val?"  He smiled.?"There I cannot tell you. Report speaks her to be a wealthy widow. She has made her appearance here very lately; is much followed after, and much admired.'- Agnes poi- dered over the information. She looked up again,  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7555-00000050"/> 100      AGNES STANiTOPE. to meet the stranger's eye rivited in turn. There was something more than curiosity, some deepening interest, she fancied, in the look, which however was quickly withdrawn. Lawrence spoke again, "You are thoughtful, Mrs. Maitland," and shrinking from his penetration, she tried to rally herself, and put on a gaiety she was far from feeling. Mrs. Percival's light laugh reached her with the murmur of the guests, and Maitland's familiar tones came back. It was some idle compliment he was saying, she caught the closing words, but the heart was in his voice. The ladies rose soon, leaving the gentlemen to their wine, and she went back with them to the drawing-room. Lawrence and Maitlind soon joined them; the former attached himself again to her side, the latter, without approaching her, joined the little group who were looking over a portfolio of draw- ings on the centre table, in which stood the beauti- ful stranger. "A ramble in the garden, in this golden sunset," said some one near, and Agnes yielded to this new movement. Clumps of short grass, with beds of showy dahas, interspersed with faded shrubbery and lingering mignionette, composed the grounds in which the little party now scattered. Lawrence still lingered at Agnes' side, and in the midst of the new faces which surrounded her, witth her husband's   AGNES STANHOPE.       101 neglect, it would have been difficult to repulse his attention. She had no disposition to do so, how- ever. She suffered him to talk on; she tried to an- swer, she tried to withdraw her eyes from their rest- less watch of the couple which a winding walk in the garden brought every few moments before them; and she tried to disbelieve the conclusions which her troubled heart too plainly drew. She was glad when the short twilight began to gather, bringing their steps back to the drawing- room, where the remainder of the guests were now assembled.  Maitland came toward her at last. Lawrence quitted her at his approach. "You have been well entertained, I see," he said, carelessly, lingering a moment by her chair. "And you, Mait- land?"  Her voice had a deeper tone than she meant. He laughed, a low idle laugh. "O, Mrs. Percival is an old friend." He turned from her to greet a gentleman who came up at that moment, and the two stood for some few seconds in conversation. "Mr. Maitland's carriage," the servant called from the door, and Agnes rose gladly. The guests were breaking up. Lawrence stood by the side of Mrs. Percival. Agnes took leave of her hostess, and hastened on to the dressing-room. Lawrence came in, in time to adjust her shawl, for Maitland had become invisible. She thanked him, and looked up at the instant to catch Mrs. Percival's large eyes  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7555-00000051"/> 102i      AGNES. STANHOPE. rivited upon her. Something in their expression chilled her, she shrank from the look, and turned away'. Maitland was waiting for her in. the hall. A mur- -mur of impatience broke from him at her delay. "It takes you a long while to get bonneted and shawled, Agnes. Our carriage stops the entrance." Her eyes filled with tears. How unlike the tone of other days. She made him no answer, but, reject- ing his hand, mounted the steps of the coach, and sunk back with a sigh on the cushions. He threw himself opposite with a moody brow. Agnes ral- lied first. She strove to speak gently, but a little unconscious bitterness stole into her voice. ' You are silent, Howard. You have left all your gaf'y-. behind." "I might retort the compliment," he an- swered coldly. -She looked up. Her expression of surprise was lost on his averted face. The cold- ness of his air- struck her. i He neither seemed to desire or expect a reply. At the door he handed her out, observing that he should return in the coach, as he had an engage- ment for the evening in London, and she went up to her dressing-room. How different this sorrowful return from the old London days. What a change had a few months wrought. In all her anxieties over Howard's course this new evil had never once entered. Was it not, after all, a phantasy of her   AGNES STANHOOPE.  -    108 troubled imagination. The neglect of the evening had pierced her. She had felt too deeply the force of the beauty and fascinations of the woman whom her distorted fears arrayed as her rival. Howard had spoken of her as an old friend. Strange they had not met her- before. - Strange he had not spoken of her in the familiarity of their daily life. She would ask Lawrence-but no, that would betray her incipient jealousy. She must wait the slow certain- ties of time.                * Midnight had long passed, and the small hours were beginning to peal from a distant bell upon the ear of the lonely watcher, when the street door grat- ed upon its hinges, and Maitland's step sound- ed in the hall. Again a loser. She knew that in the heavy step which lingered wearily on the stair. He must not find her up, her pale cheek and heavy eyes would bring down a burst of fierce impreca- tions, a torrent of angry curses, and she hurried to seek her pillow, and feign slumber. Yes, he was a loser again. The little revival of success which had brightened his mood the past week had died out, and he knew not which way to turn. He had staked his last winning. What could he do? Borrow of Lawrence-he was already sunk in his debt. What could he do? The casket enclosing his wife's dia- monds caught his eye on the dressing-table, as he staggered in, heated with wine, for the red cup had  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7555-00000052"/> 104      AGNES STANHOPE. circulated freely as usual in the gambling saloon. Sunk as he was, a momentary thrill of shame crush- ed him at the suggestion. This gift of his short honeymoon had been spared in their darkest days, spared when he hardly knew where to meet the ne- cessities of the morrow, and when clamorous credit- ors seemed to -throng every step. Agnes' love had urged them upon him then. lie turned towards the bed. One of the last emotions of pity in his hard- ening career stirred him as he looked on the sleeper. The pale brow, the weary lines around the mouth, deepening in repose, rivited his eye. What a change had a few months wrought in that young face. It seemed scarce a day since he had gazed upon it enchanted with its bloom and gladness. It is my fate, he murmured. Well, they must go. It is a heavy stake, but I shall win; I shall be sure to win, and I will pay her back with jewels of ten-fold rich- ness. "I Mrs. Langley." The servant threw open the door of the drawing-room to usher in the. morning visitor. Agnes rose from the piano, where her fingers had been listlessly waking harmonies to songs full of old memories, and came forward to receive her. "I was disappointed at not meeting you at Mrs. Mortimer's yesterday," said the lady, when the courtesies of the day were over, and the conversa- tion began to drag.   AGNES STANHOPE.,      105 "No.  I had one of my fits of nervous head- ache, and Maitland had to go without me at the last moment." Agnes did not add that even then a word might have changed her decision, but for the first time her husband had seemed strangely indif- ferent to the pleasure of her company. "Pray,' quite unable to resist the feeling of interest which prompted the question -" was Mrs. Percival pres- ent? I have seen so little of Maitland this morning I have had no opportunity to ask him who made up the party." "Yes; and Mr. Lawrence. What a fine gentle- man Mr. Lawrence is. I never met his equal in conversational abilities. He is so interesting. Web think him a great acquisition to our little gather- ings. An old friend of yours I presume, Mrs. Mait- land?"                   G "An intimate- of my husband's from boyhood. I have met him only since his return from abroad." "Indeed. Do you know anything of his family or expectations?" "Nothing; I have never heard Maitland speak of his connections. -I think he has no near rela-- tives." "He is one of Mrs. Percival's admirers." "Ah, indeed." Agnes looked up with suddenly aroused interest. "Yes; at least report says he visits hUr frequent- 6  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7555-00000053"/> 106      AGNES STANHOPE.          \ ly. She is very charming, and has the reputation of possessing a fine fortune." "Yes, she is very beautiful."  Agnes said the words absently. "You have known her long?" "On the contrary she has come among us within a few months." "From abroad?" I don't know. Mr. Lawrenee introduced her. She is an old friend of his. I believe he knew her before her marriage." Agnes pondered a little over the -last sentence; a glimmering of the real truth did not dawn upon her however. Her loquacious visitor might assist her curiosity, to use so light a term for a deeper feeling, as to the disposal of Maitland's mornings, a matter which had of late excited her serious dis- quiet, but how to bring about so delicate an inquiry was a difficult matter. With all the ingenuity she could direct, it would reveal too plainly her own suspicions. At that moment, by one of those singular fascinations which we sometimes experi- ence without the power to explain, her eyes were drawn at the window by which she sat to the street, and an open barouche bowling slowly by caught her attention. The fair face bent forward, radiant with smiles, and flushed with the fresh morning breeze, she knew at a glance; and the gentleman who reclined beside her, his eye and thought, too !   AGNES STANHOPE,       107 absorbed to seem conscious that he was passing his own home, was no other than her husband. The discovery came upon her with the suddenness of a lightening flash; she could neither control her change of color, or the faint exclamation which broke from her lips. Happily this sight was shut out from Mrs. Langley in her opposite seat; she attributed her hostess' emotion to quite a different cause. Was it possible Mrs. Maitland could be so charmed with the fascinating Lawrence as to hear with uneasiness of his interest in the beautiful widow? At all events she had gone far enough upon this subject, and she tried to take up some other topic, but with indifferent success. Agnes could not at once re- cover herself from the painful shock she had re- ceived, and Mrs. Langley, after wearying through another half hour, finally took her leave. Scarcely had the door closed upon her retreating form when the street bell again rang, and Lawrence's well known voice a moment after reached the draw- ing-room. Agnes would have escaped to her own room, and sent a message of excuse, that she was closely engaged, or the plea of a headache, but neither was now possible and she came forward with tolerable grace to receive him. Her paleness and discomposed air struck him, but he made no com- ment at first beyond the usual courteous inquiries for her health. "I have just encountered Mrs.  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7555-00000054"/> 108      AGNES STANHOPE. Langley," he said. "She joined me yesterday in my regrets at your absence from Mrs. Mortimer's party. To me it eclipsed all the pleasure of the evening." Agnes looked up. This language sounded new and strange upon his lips. The tone was the utter- ance of mere compliment; the eye, through even its respectfully subdued light, spoke a different language. She answered coldly.  "I do not know, Mr. Lawrence, what reason you have to attach parti- cular pleasure to my society. My distressing head- ache compelled me to relinquish my engagement; nothing but stillness and quiet would soothe it." -He bowed, as if in acceptance of the reproof he felt in her tone, and read in her suddenly constrain- ed air. "Forgive me, Mrs. Maitland, if I seem to trespass beyond the limits of a friend, but in my heart I am associated with you in a common subject of anxiety. I tremble at the slow trial of all our hopes in turning Howard's unhappy course." Doubt and anguish struggled in Agnes' expressive face. He may be a friend, after all, she thought. I may have wronged him--at least to Howard. What should he gain in his destruction? She looked up. The anxieties, the griefs, of the last weeks filled her eyes. "I am discouraged, Mr. Lawrence, I feel as if my influence were entirely gone."  An expression of well counterfeited compassion   AGNES STANHOPE.       109 lit up his dark face as he turned toward her. "My dear Mrs. Maitland, do not say that! It is only a momentary infatuation, into the sphere of which I have been well nigh drawn myself. You will, you must, reclaim him- your truth and goodness who could resist?" All that her late visitor had said of Mrs. Percival came back to Agnes in his words. She understood them. Her rising color showed that she did. It was not to the infatuation of the gaming-table that he was so guardedly alluding; his words had a deeper point. The young wife's first impulse of wounded pride soon yielded to still more painful feelings. Was he more fully versed in this new fancy than herself? The restless longing to know the whole truth, bitter as it was, possessed her. "You flatter me, Mr. Lawrence. I can hardly hope so. It is true that Howard now seeks society with as much avidity as he lately shunned it, but I am far from feeling sure that the influences brought upon him are of a character I could wish." "I cannot reassure you, Mrs. Maitland, "his voice had the tone of a reluctant concession. "Mrs. Percival--I will not affect ignorance of what I see chance has revealed to your own obser- vation-Mrs. Percival is lively and charming, the very woman to attract on the surface the attention of a man harassed with excitement and anxieties."  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7555-00000055"/> "O     AGNES STANHOPE. A contrast to the pale face and silent lips at home. Agnes thought so, as a vision of the face she had looked upon in the carriage, radiant with health and animation, came back. But she-0 how could she nerve herself to laugh and. smile upon the edge of a volcano? And what would be all her wiles to this new face? Was Howard so utterly lost to principle? Were all her hopes so utterly shattered I Lawrence's keen eye marked her thoughts. "My dear Mrs. Maitland, bear with me. Let me presume upon my privilege as Howard's friend, his only friend, dear lady, but yourself, to say one word. It is not a grave brow and a silent lip which will win your husband back. This close seclusion must be broken -you must no longer shrink from society, you must be by his side where this temptation meets him." "I should fail," the words came suddenly out. "We will trust otherwise." He rose. It was past the hour of lunch. " will detain you no longer, Mrs. Maitland. It is growing late. I pray you think over what I have said." She did think it over in the lonely hour which fol- lowed. The call to lunch passed unheeded, and she still sat lost in her anxious reflections. Well for poor Agnes the advice so artfully proffered found little response in her pure heart. There was something too keenly degrading in the thought ofthus entering   AGNES STANHOPE,       " the lists in competition with her gay, and for aught she knew, unprincipled rival. To do this, also, she must accede tacitly to her husband's reckless course, a step from which all her right feelings revolted. "I cannot clothe my' lips with smiles and my heart in gaiety while Howard is trembling on the verge of ruin. I believe he loves me yet. I cannot think all the past is so soon forgotten. I will make one more struggle to regain my lost influence. It may win him back. There is no time to lose. Every hour spent in her society may deepen the power of this beauti- ful syren. I must make my trial at once." They met at the late dinner-table, the husband and wife. Maitland in his usual sullen gloom, which his late turn of luck had for the first time failed to sof- ten. The staking of his wife's diamonds had deep- ened with a sense of shame his bitter feelings toward her. He shrank from her society ; her pale face and listless step, had grown to be reproaches, and sought, as we have seen, forgetfulness in the society of a woman whose daily presence he would once have sfunned as a disgrace. All the mystery which lay around Mrs. Percival (the unhappy Helen de Lacy, whose sad story had so excited Agnes' pity, from the lips of her cold sister-in-law) none knew better; and more than once a scornful smile had crossed his lip as the rumored story of her wealth and distinction reached him. But she was gay, won-  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7555-00000056"/> "2      AGNES STANHOPE. derously beautiful, with every art and charm which could dazzle a lost spirit, and he passed only too willingly into the sphere of her attractions. ," Spare me a few moments, Howard," said Agnes, as the silent meal ended, and he made a movement to push back his chair from the table ; I have somewhat to say." He drew out his watch. "I have little time, Ag- nes-an engagement at seven. Is it so important a matter it cannot be postponed?" "O, Howard, there was a time when you had hours to spare me, when I had not to plead for a few moments. How have I been so unfortunate as to for- feit all your love?" "What would the woman have?" he spoke an- grily to himself. "Agnes, you cannot expect the honeymoon to last forever. That romance must be put at an end." "But what should fill its place? Surely, not con-, stant absence, and neglect." He frowned heavily, and bit his lip. "Agnes, you know what my life is. My unfortu- nate passion for you has helped me to make it such. Spare yourself reproaches." She looked up, now fully aroused. The color of old days came back. in her cheek, a kindling light in her blue eye. "In one thing spare me--let no one come between   AGNES STANHOPE.        113 us-my husband, spare us both the shameful rival- ship of an unworthy woman." He turned upon her suddenly. "Jealous, Agnes, and of whom?"  For the first time his look fell be- fore hers-a thrill of angry shame crossed him as he felt the hot blood suffuse his brow. He rallied, how- ever, in an instant. "Agnes, I will hear no further of this childish folly. First, it was Lawrence-you were jealous of his influence over me, and now it is Mrs. Percival. I cannot be civil to an old friend I have not met for years, without drawing down tears and cold looks. Pshaw! a curse upon such folly!" He pushed back his chair determinedly, and rose. Agnes rose at the same instant. She struggled with her tears, but when she spoke her voice was firm. "I see I have failed," she said in the first re- proachful words she had yet addressed to him, " but, Maitland, I warn you. You are casting off your on- ly true friend." He brought his hand down heavily on the table. A"Silence, Agnes! I will hear no more. Better part than live in taunts." The door opened, and both started at the entrance of the servant. -The closing words in Maitland's raised voice must have reached her, but Agnes was too deeply steeped in the pain of her failure to feel this mortification. Maitland hurried out, and Agnes retired to her dressing-room to brood over her ill success.       6*  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7555-00000057"/> CHAPTER IX. A letter from Mrs. Moreton. :Maitland took it from the London post-office. The hand-writing deep- ened the shadow which now rested permanently on his brow. From Alice! He tore it listlessly open. A visit from her just now would be most unwelcome. Her lynx eyes would penetrate everything. He ran over the little scrawl. HOWARD:-I haven't had a line from you since I read Un- cle Philip's marriage. What a strange step for the old man, and what a finely planned revenge for your jilted bride. Are you clean discouraged? I have had a few anxieties about you lately. Rumor has reached me, I hardly know how, that you have fallen back on your profession, but with poor success. I am coming to London for a few days. Send me your address, and expect me early in next week." "' There's no help for it," he muttered, folding this characteristic note, and thrusting it into his pocket. "Now for remonstrances and a scene.    Alice isn't the woman to be put off with a few hard words. I shall have to face the storm." It was no very cordial reception which greeted the   AGNES STANHOPE.       115 blunt sister-in-law from the pale, dispirited young wife, whom she had parted from the year before in the opening of far brighter prospects. Her pale cheek and weary look touched even Mrs. Moreton's heart for an instant, but the kindly impulse was soon gone, for she somehow associated the unhappy young crea- ture with the cause of her brother's rapid misfor- tunes. So when the evening was passed, the first for many long weeks which had been spent by Mait- land under his own roof, and the early morning found the two ladies at solitary tete-a-tete in the quiet dressing-room, Agnes felt little disposition to open her sorrowful confidences. Mrs. Moreton played with the pearl paper-cutter, and threw restless glances into the street from the window at which she sat, while Agnes in her low rocker opposite,. assiduously plied her needle in silence. Mrs. Moreton was the first to speak. She opened the subject uppermost in her mind with her usual abruptness. "I have heard - sad news of Howard, lately. I should have disbelieved it, but his haggard face and bloodshot eyes when he met me at the depot yester- day, were plain proof. Is it all true, Agnes? Is he living on the gaming table?" "Yes.' The word came out as if wrung from her heart's core. "And you say nothing?"  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7555-00000058"/> "6      AGNES STANHOPE. "I have no influence, Mrs. Morton." The voice was firm, the eye cold. How strangely the discipline of our life moulds us. "He will be a lost man," Mrs. Moreton spoke up with animation. "It's easy to see what has led him into this way. Howard never was intended for a profession; he never had the patience for such long waiting--after such expectations, too. Uncle Phillip should have thought of this. But there's his new wife at his ear, no doubt." Agnes colored. The last allusion to her sister wounded her to the quick. Tears rushed into her eyes. "Bertha is too noble," she faltered. "You don't know her, Mrs. Moreton." Mrs. Moreton laughed, her cold, dry laugh. "My dear, your simplicity is charming. What did she marry Uncle Phillip for?" "You don't know her," repeated Agnes, her eyes kindling through her tears, and her cheeks flushing a deeper red. "She is the soul of goodness and honor." "I will leave that to you," said Mrs. Moreton, with an air of courteously waiving the point. "There is a more important matter to decide. Agnes, do you know where Howard's present course will lead?" Agnes bent over her work. "I do not need to be told," she said, in a voice scarcely audible.   AGNES STANHOPE.       117 "Well, there is only one way to bring him back." She looked up eagerly. ' Can you point me out any way, Mrs. Moreton?" "An application to Uncle Philip.  It's very doubtful at that." Agnes' eager look fell. " O, no," she said, faintly, "not that; he will never consent." "It's the only way. If your sister is the angel you paint her," she added, with a slight sneer, "per- haps she will help us." Write to Bertha I O, no; she shuddered at the suggestion. What, entreat her pity after the shame- ful course they had practiced toward her! "I would do anything else, Mrs. Moreton, for Howard's sake, but not that, neither would it avail. I blush to say it of my husband; but the most lib- eral remittance from Colonel Maitland would at once be lavished on the gaming table. He must have taken rapid strides in this new vice," said Mrs. Moreton, coldly. ( If he could be brought to see the depths of this frightful vortex," said Agnes, mournfully. "Mrs. Moreton," she went on, timidly, " you once had much influence overl5Howard. I have heard him speak of you before our marriage hundreds of times. You may succeed where I have failed.

A wife should be nearer than a sister." Her eyes spoke the involuntaly reproach which her lips withheld. Agnes colored painfully. A feeling of wounded pride rose to sus- tain her. She took up her work which had fallen from her lap in the eagerness of their conversation. Why was I so fatally linked to a man without prin- ciple? she thought. And why did Bertha, by her cruel marriage, clothe my path with thorns? In her innocence she has repaid me ten fold for the anguish; I cast upon her. O, that in the providences of God it might have come from some other hand. Is it possible that no whispers of Maitland's course reach her even  in her country home?   Has. Colonel Maitland so soon forgotten the nephew he loved as a son? Maitland came home to lunch that day. His sis- ter's visit seemed to have effected a sudden change in his habits. But Mrs. Moreton did not open the subject of her visit either on that day, or the day following.  She waited until the eve of her depart- ure, when her brother's evenings and mornings had fallen back on their old way of disposal- evenings I say, but those long evenings-deepened often into the still hours of the day before, from her wakeful pillow she caught the slow echoes of his returning step upon the stair. "Howard, I must detain you a  few moments to I   AGNES STANHOPE.       119 beg a little conversation. It is my last opportunity you know, as I take the coach at twelve." They were alone in the breakfast room, which Agnes had just quitted. Maitland drew his chair back to the table and reseated himself with an un- easy air. He knew very well the subject which was coming. "Howard," his sister began, earnestly, "I am deeply troubled at the course you are pursuing. I can't pretend to be ignorant of what I have seen under your own roof, I can't shut my eyes to the certainty that you are hurrying down to swift ruin.?' "You are wrong, Alice," he answered, doggedly. "At the gaming table I earn a subsistence; if I held back on my profession I might starve." "At best a precarious subsistence," she repeated, firmly, " and that kind of luck never lasts. You will see it for yourself, soon." He had already experienced this truth. His cheek reddened with an angry glow, and an impa- tient oath sprang to his lips. Without heeding his change of countenance, Mrs. Moreton went on: "It brings you to the wine cup, too, Howard, and IFneedn't say what other vices are close in its train. If you keep on you will soon be a lost man, body and soul." "I'm a lost man, now," he repeated, bringing down his hand with fierce emphasis on the table,  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7555-00000060"/> 120      AGNES STANHOPE. "credit, reputation, fortune, gone! And all by my foolish love match." "You paid dear enough for the love to have lasted longer," said Mrs. Moreton, coldly. "By the avert- ed looks and sullen ways I have seen between you this week past, one would think you were heartily tired of each other." "And so I am," said Maitland, speaking in the heat of the moment, with perhaps more warmth than truth. "For Agnes' sake I have lost my uncle's favor, with all my brilliant prospects, and now when we are without a penny, and I am driven to play from hard necessity, she visits what she is pleased to call my sin with a gloomy brow and reproaches." "I pity her there," said Mrs. Moreton. "I don't pretend to like her, I never did, I always thought you made a poor choice, Howard; but she sees how rapidly you are going to ruin, as well as I, or any other looker on. Howard, try a last chance; take up your profession again." "Alice, I should starve. I am not worth a penny in the world, and overhead in debt." "Write to uncle Philip." "Never! Write to the man who held out to me such brilliant prospects, blasted them' in a moment, and helped to make me what I am! Write to be scorned, too, by. the woman I rejected? Alice, it isn't like yourself to give such advice."   AGNES STANHOPE.       121 "It is the only way," she answered, gloomily. "I can't think of any other. It's lowering your pride, but it might lift you out of all these troubles." No," said Maitland, resolutely, "I would blow my brains out first.  Alice, if we are to part friends, you will say no more of this." He pushed back his chair and rose' now. "I shall see you again, Alice, before you go. I have an engagement at ten, but I shall be back in time." He took out his watch, glanced at the hour, and gladly quitted the room. Mrs. Moreton followed him sorrowfully with her eyes. It's all over, she said. It would only have exasperated him to have said more. This marriage has been his ruin. Agnes could but feel the change in her sister-in- law's manner, when she joined her in the dressing- room a little later. In the increased coldness of her demeanor, she read the failure of her effort, and saw that she associated her innocent self with the cause of her brother's fall. Little was said between them, both silently forbearing allusion to the all-engrossing subject of their thoughts. Soon the coach came round. Maitland, asphis sister had foreseen, failing to make his appearance, and with a chill clasp of the hand, and a cold good-bye, the two parted. Agnes stood in the doorway as the coach rolled off, and disappeared round a corner 6f the street. It  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7555-00000061"/> 122     AGNES STANHOPE. was the close of October, and the dead leaves were silently rustling down from the thick boughs of a brown sycamore on the sidewalk. The last rose had withered from the little terrace, and the vines were dark and sere as if a breath of flame had swept over them. A gay equipage, with footmen in gaudy liveries, bowled past. In the qarriage were happy young faces, and Agnes turned away from a sight which contrasted so painfully with her own lot. The sense of her- utter friendlessness pressed mourn- fully upon her. Her instincts were too pure to place a moment's trust in Lawrence's professions. She re- called, too, the proof she had received of his falseness in the deception he had shown toward her, regarding Mrs. Percival. With this woman's past, whatever it might have been, he was closely acquainted. He had brought about her very introduction into the so- ciety in which she now moved. Could he be leagued to bring about the ruin of his old friend? Were the gaming table and the wine cup insufficient, that the lure of a strange woman must be added? Yet what could he gain in his destruction? Howard was deeply in his debt. His only probable chance of repayal lay in his reformation, not in his uncertain winnings. Policy, then, would dictate the very course of conduct:he professed. Might he not be true in this at least, where his interests were con- cerned? Agnes lost herself for the hundredth time in these troubled reflections.   CHAPTER X. We will go on for a brief interval to the new ac- tor, who has suddenly appeared to take her part in this eventful portion of Agnes Stanhope's life. It is a small apartment, a boudoir, opening out of her dressing-room, and fitted up with exquisite taste and elegance, in which we find Mrs. Percival. The pale sea-green hangings of the walls shed no un- welcome tints on a complexion whose rouge and car- mine rival the rose and the lily. But with all the symmetry of feature and delicacy of coloring, the dark lines around the large brown eyes, and the weary curve of the full mouth, cannot fail to catch the eye of the observer. They show that the hap- py past of innocence and truth is not forgotten. She reclines listlessly in her velvet fauteuil, her jewelled fingers toying idly with the uncut pages of the last new novel, which lies in her lap. The story spreading before her, with its interminable chapters, is not yet begun; she is listening for a ring at the street door, and a well known step upon the stair. Will he fail again? she muttered at last, throwing  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7555-00000062"/> 124      AGNES STANHOPE. down her book, and passing with an impatient step to the window. She flung back the crimson cur- tains with an eager touch, and looked out on the street. The same mournful picture of falling leaves and withered gardens which had greeted Agnes Maitland a moment ago from the threshold of her home. Here a carriage bowling by, there a lonely pedestrian, and yonder a group of school-girls wend- ing merrily homeward - the suburbs of London are rarely thronged save at morn and early eve. Will he fail again? Is he with her? A dark frown con- tracted the smooth brow, and a chill light shot from the clear eye. The heavy folds of the curtain sud- denly swept down at the fall of her restless hand, and as if roused by a new thought she turned toward a vase of rich exotics which stood upon the little marble table. Snowy camillias, with here and there a blush rose of unrivalled sweetness, Mait- land's gift. A smile half scornful wreathed her lip as she bent over them. Poor fellow, I believe he is really half enchanted. How men's fancies vary. Who would have believed this when I went abroad eight years ago. This wife and his friend have been the undoing of him--List! there is Lawrence's step at last. He must not find me waiting. The light kindled in her eye, she went back to her old seat, and took up her book. The visitor entered without the ceremony of an-   AGNES STANHOPE.       125 nouncing himself. He bowed carelessly to the con- strained welcome which greeted him, and quietly drew up a chair opposite the fauteuil. " You are late," said Mrs. Percival, drawing her minature watch from the folds of her dress. "Where has your morning gone, Lawrence? I quite expected a drive with'you to-day out to Brighton." "I am sorry to have disappointed you," he answered, care- lessly. "I had an engagement elsewhere, and the hours flew on." He threw a glance at the flowers "  on the table. a "Maitland has been here, I see. You have really charmed him, Helen." Something in the tone and look touched a sensi- tive chord. She looked up. Her eye met his. "O I am not in the least jealous. Your flirtation gives me no disquiet." Her look fell a little, and changed now to a- shad- ow of uneasiness. ("Mrs. Langley was here this morning." "Ah, indeed. And what was the latest gossip?" "Your admiration of Mrs. Maitland." He laugh- ed, but there was something in that short dry laugh which grated harshy on his companion's ear. She caught a sudden glimpse of a fact which with all her watchfulness had escaped her.  She knew well that her empire over the heart of her be- trayer had long ago crumbled, and that her strong will, and persevering hold to his fortunes, had alone  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7555-00000063"/> 126      AGNES STANHOPE. preserved her from the common fate of the fallen. She had clung to him in their wanderings abroad, oftentimes in poverty and want, when his luck at the gaming-table failed to supply their extravagan- ces, and she had been faithful through harshness, and even desertion. From the day of their return to England, and the disappointment of his London match with the wealthy heiress, she had felt that the last step in her disgrace was fully resolved upon, and that a fitting opportunity only was waited for to put the purpose into execution. With the first  glimpse of Agnes Maitland's face at the late dinner party and Lawrence's absorbed attention, a terrible fear had haunted her, which Mrs. Langley's idle words, and her lover's hollow laugh, now settled in- to conviction. This hollow laugh revealed to her, too, what deepened her fiery passion, that he had made her his blinded dupe, an accomplice in bring- ing about his object. He had encouraged Maitland's visits, and their intimacy, to arouse the jealousy of the ill-used wife, and thus in her friendlessness and resentment dispose her to accept his protection. "You are silent, Helen," said Lawrence, who had been watching not without interest her chang- ing face. "I trust your visitor's idle gossip has not chilled your spirits." "If it were true?" she turned upon him a look which with all his hardihood he was not brave   AGNES STANHOPE.       127 enough to meet.  "Pshaw, Helen," he answeied coldly, you take it too seriously. Agnes Maitland is a beautiful woman. Her simplicitytoo is charm- ing. One would never believe she had passed through the trying ordeal of a whole London sea- son. Who could resist a little attention to so lovely a creature? so slighted and neglected by her hus- band, too." "You have grown very philanthropic, Lawrence," retorted Mrs. Percival, with a sneer. "And pray who has fostered this gentleman's fondness for the gaming-table, and drawn him quietly into the sphere of attractions which in his own eyes are likely to eclipse for the present those of his home?" "I admire your penetration, Helen. But we will not make a scene." He rose. "You are going, then?"Her face had grown very pale. "Yes. To what purpose should I linger? You seem in an unhappy mood this morning." He had reached the door. He paused an instant, as if awaiting a reply, but she was silent, and he bowed himself out. "It is over," he said, as he passed down the broad flight of stairs to the hall. "She knows all. Will she submit with a good grace? Ah, that remains to be seen. I could predict better of any other woman, long as I have known Hellen. Well, my mind is  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7555-00000064"/> 128      AGNES STANHOPE. made up. I will be encumbered with her no longer. I have paid well-nigh as dearly as Maitland for my folly. The fortunes this little story has stood be- tween I But thank her foolish old. father, I did not tie myself hopelessly. Well, she knows the worst now, and must submit. There is Maitland with his devotion, and his empty purse, too. Will it come to that, I wonder? He dosen't care a fig for his pret- ty Agnes, that's plain." He halted on the sidewalk. "It is a whole week since I have been to Howard's. Agnes must wonder at my desertion, with my zeal for my poor friend, too. But there's his sister. Her visit must have come to an end by this time. For- tunately there is so little sympathy between Agnes and her blunt sister-in-law, she will not be likely to make her a confidant. If she does, she will be well put on her guard. Alice never liked me. My old delinquencies would come out with a vengeance  Better see first if the coast is clear. I shall find Howard at Mizart's." And he turned his steps to- ward an hotel in the next street. We will go back to the room he has just quitted, where Mrs. Percival lies upon the floor, her white face buried in the cushions ofthe fauteuil from which she has just risen. There is a fierce resolution in the tight interlacing of the stony fingers, a frenzied dis- pair in the wild disorder of the thick, dark tresses, which have broken from their confinement in her   AGNES STANHOPE.       129 hurried movements, and lay over her shoulders. Who shall paint the thoughts which are struggling in the wretched woman's brain? Was it for this hour that she silvered her father's gray head, and broke her mother's heart? Was it for this hour that eight long years ago she stole forth from her home in the dead and stillness of night, leaving woe and shame to all who had loved her? Alas! the gay, thought- less girl, leaned upon a reed which was soon to break and pierce her. Even in this crowning hour of his falseness she could not forget the first wild thrill which ran through her when she found that the vil- lain who had deceived her had no purpose to fulfil his vows. "I have sworn never to marry, Helen. It's a foolish contract to bind one-self too; but I will be true to you until death." She was at his mercy, and she knew it. Suicide, or9submission to her fate. What wonder that she chose the latter-yes, with all the horrors of to-day-to be cast forth when her fa- tal beauty had withered, to starve, or sink lower in the depths of sin. She thought of it now, with clenched hand and wild eyes. "And this is the end! the miserable end! Why was I such a fool as to be intoxicated with his flatteries? Why did I listen to him to the curse of my stern old father, and my too indulgent mother? They told me he was a libertine and a gambler, but he said that it was only that he had no title to offer, no fortune to lay at my feet, and 7 ,          &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7555-00000065"/> 130   -   AGNES STANHOPE. I, fool that I was, believed!"She rose and put back the dishevelled tresses. The mirror opposite gave back her face, and she smiled a ghastly smile to see how wan and white it was. She went up to the rosewood writing-desk, and from a little drawer drew out silently two or three folded papers. She opened one;-a white, glistening powder shone to the surface. "Enough for us both," she murmured.    Her hand trembled; the thought sent a shudder through her frame. She laid them down irresolutely. "After all there may be a spark of kindness in his heart. I will try first to kindle it. I will make sure there is no hope before I take up the last resort." She threw back the papers in the drawer, locked it hurriedly, and took up her pen.  It trembled in her unsteady fingers; and sheet after sheet of the delicate rose- tinted paper was blotted and cast aside before the words would come. It was a hard trial to her pride --fallen as she was-to entreat the return of the man- against whom, mingling with all the remains of the old fondness which had wrought her ruin, so many bitter memories were hoarded. I think only the ter- rible alternative she held in reserve could have steel- ed her to this last humiliation. LAWRENCE:--I was unjust this morning, and am unhappy now that you have left me in displeasure. Can you not forgive, something to my causeless jealously in remembering the unhap- py circumstances in which I stand.

As for your sake I have sacrificed the world, all my friends and kindred, so I repeat what I have told you in the past, that death alone shall separate us. Surely, you know me better than to have thought that the attention I al- lowed to wile-away idle hours when separated from your side, had any other motive than that which springs from the dullness of ennui. Lawrence, I long to hear to-day afresh from your lips the assurances and promises of the past. Will you not gratify my woman's wish, and, at least, return me a line by the bearer?" She folded and sealed the note, traced the super- scription, and rang the bell. A servant appeared. "Take this note to Mr. Lawrence, at his hotel, and wait a reply." She slipped a small gold piece, which she drew from her purse, into the man's hand. He looked sur- prised at the magnitude of the gift, but bowed re- spectfully, and withdrew. A long, long hour passed, spent by her in alter- nately pacing the floor, and watching from the win- dow down the dusky street the return of her messenger.  He came at last.    She caught her breath, her heart seemed to sink with a leaden weight, as his even step lingered in the hall, and came up the stairs.   Life and death were in- his word. Would it be life? The door moved slowly on its hinges and he stood before her. She glided  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7555-00000066"/> 132      AGNES STANHOPE. forward an eager step, and threw a glance of dis- may at his empty hand.  4 Mr. Lawrence - Mr. Lawrence was not in?" "Yes, marm, but he was engaged, and just going out." "Very well, Edgar;" and she turned away. The man could not see as he went out, softly closing the door after him, the strong paroxysm which shook her from head to foot, the set teeth and interlocked hands. It was over in an instant, and eye and lip were calm, but steeled as marble. His hard selfishness had -sealed his fate. The last throb of irresolution, the last ray of linger- ing tenderness, had quitted her heart. "Can you loan me a hundred pounds, Lawrence? I am hard up. I lost every penny last night to Gilbert- that man has the devil's own luck I " The two were together in the luxuriously furnish- ed apartment which Lawrence -occupied at his hotel, the one reclining back in his comfortable arm-chair, an air of unusual complacency on his smooth brow, the other seated on the sofa which was drawn op- posite, his elbow supported by the table at his side, his face warn and haggard, the frown which had tow grown to be habitual, contracting his broad forehead, and the weary lines of care curving round his pale lips. Lawrence twirled carelessly the perfumed note which the moment- before had been put into his hand, and whose -contents his restless eye had de-   AGNES STANHOPE.       133 voured at a glance. His friend's modest request embarrassed him for the instant. Refuse it he could not with any grace, for his pocket book was stuffed with bank bills, and he had that very morn- i ing boasted of his unremitting run of luck; but as we have already intimated, Maitland was now-deep- ly in his debt, and he was well aware how extreme- ly vague were his chances of repayment. If Howard could only patch up a hollow peace with his uncle, but that is not likely, and after all it might interfere in my chances with Agnes. An application for money might open the old man's eyes to his nephew's course, and bring round a reforma- tion; for I have often noticed -there is more chance of a man's turning at the worst than when he is half way down.  "I'll be happy to accommodate you, Howard," he said, aloud, and drawing out his well filled purse;-"Here's the money," counting it out, and thrusting the roll of bills across the table. "'Don't trouble yourself, Maitland, about repay- ment. Your luck will come round by and by. By the way, how is Mrs. Maitland this morning? She looked pale and wearied with a headache yester- day." ("Well enough, for aught I know," growled the unsympathizing husband.  "I haven't seen her this morning." "' Ah, indeed," said Lawrence, quietly surveying  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7555-00000067"/> 134      AGNES STANHOPE. his friend. So your honeymoon is all over. Well, you have been married over a year." "A short time to slip out of such fine prospects into ruin," said Maitland, bitterly. "Ah, well, don't be too hard on pretty Mrs. Mait- land." "Pretty," repeated his friend, fiercely. "Her beauty has all faded under these sullen moods and perpetual worryings. I never get a pleasant word, much less a smile, now-a-days. One would think this ruin lay all on my shoulders." "They are broad enough to carry it," said Lawrence, with a laugh. "Come, you must n't be hard on Mrs. Maitland, she may be beautiful still in other's eyes if a new face has eclipsed her in yours -now I think of it," and he unfolded and smooth- ed out with assumed carelessness the paper with which he had been toying--" here is an invitation to- dine with Helen. Won't you go, Howard, a tete- 2tete dinner is such a bore?" "I should be happy-but what will the lady say?" "O, I never stand on ceremony with Helen. She will only be too glad to see you." Maitland rose, and taking up the bills which he had suffered to remain on the table slowly thrust them into his pocket. "I'm ever so much obliged to you, Lawrence. You've been a true friend to me. I am sure my luck will turn by and by."   AGNES STANHOPE.       135 -"Yes, yes," said Lawrence, hopefully. "It's ebb and flow with us all. I've seen the day when I hadn't a shilling in my purse. Don't forget the hour," he called out, as his friend paused in the door, "punctual at six. Helen keeps early hours." "I shall be in time, never fear;" and the door swung heavily too. Lawrence listened to the echo of his retreating steps. All works well, he muttered. Helen is coming to her senses, she sees my decision. I could n't well refuse such a courteous invitation, and Maitland's going with me will save any possibility of a scene. What a weak fool I am. I can't bear a woman's tears. Helen knows that; how she out- witted me at Berlin, and how suddenly she joined me at Paris. She knew well I never meant to take her back with me. She has been my bane and curse- well, it's all over. I'll grant her last whim to save trouble. Agnes was n't very gracious to me last night, but I can afford to wait. A few days, or I mistake that poor fool, will show her where she stands. Events are hurrying up fast. Yes, events were hurrying up fast, but guided by an unseen hand in a far different direction from his eager plans.  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7555-00000068"/> CHAPTER XI. Punctual to the hour. I knew he would come. And Mrs. Percival rose as the well-known ring at the street door reached her ear. It was in the din- ing-room that she waited her guest, one of the suite of apartments which Lawrence's lavish winnings had furnished for her use. She rose, and took a step forward to the door. The echoes of his step rang along the hall. Not alone? her quick ear caught that. She drew back and put her hand to her tem- ples with a bewildered air. There was no help for it, and at least it would prevent the awkwardness of a solitary tete-a-tete, and nerve her, if her tightly strung nerves needed such stimulus, to act warily her part in the next long hour. She met her guests then, graciously enough, with her old smile and un- changed voice. The rouge hid the bright crimson spot in her cheek, and only the icy glitter of the eye, and the quivering muscles of the mouth, revealed the emotion within. Lawrence glanced at her as he entered, something unusual in her appearance struck him, but his thoughts furnished a ready commenta- ry, and he inly congratulated himself on his fore-   AGNES STANHOPE.       137 sight in frustrating her plan of another appeal. He took the seat, then, to which a careless wave of her hand motioned him, with radiant good humor, and led the broken conversation which followed with even more than his usual ease and brilliance. The long half hour, long to the trembling hostess, drag- ged away at length, the servant came in bringing the first course of the dinner, and the little party took their places at the table. Mrs. Percival's plate was removed hardly tasted, but her abstinence found excuse on the easy plea of a headache, and was soon unnoticed by her companions in some common-place topic of interest which suddenly sprung up. The courses were withdrawn at length, the servant brought in the wine, with baskets of golden oranges and purple grapes, and withdrew, closing the door behind him. Mrs. Percival slowly poured out a glass of spark- ling champagne, and pushed it towards Lawrence with a languid smile. "It is your favorite wine, if I remember," she said. "Favor me by pledging this glass to a toast." He smiled. "What, reviving a long laid custom, Helen. To your health and happiness." But he merely bowed over the wine, and passed it quietly to Maitland. "Your pardon, fair lady, but I must keep my head clear for an important engagement which comes on in an hour, and one glass is sure to 7*  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7555-00000069"/> 138      AGNES STANHO(PE. follow another. Howard will be proud- to honor such a toast." Maitland drained it at a draught. He did not see the half-outstretched hand extended on the table, or catch the wild cry stifled into a faint moan which broke from the parted lips. When he raised his eyes to his hostess as he set down his glass, he saw for the first time her blanching face, paling through its rouge. "You are ill!" he exclaimed, "Mrs. Percival!" She made no answer, the room and the faces were reeling before her. , Maitland's movement to support her brought back recollection. "It is only a little faintness," she said. "I shall be better in a mo- ment." She looked up to meet Lawrence's steady eyes. Guilt read in his careless gaze scrutiny and suspicion. The gibbet rose before her, to her start- led sight it seemed to swing out of the mists in the darkening room. She sprang to her feet. "41My head is bewildered," she said-" this sudden at- tack. I will go to my room. I pray you excuse me, gentlemen, and do not let my abruptness, or this sudden seizure stop your enjoyment." She went out without pausing for a reply, leaving the two absorbed in surprise at her singular manner and strange departure. Lawrence recovered first. "Helen is in an odd way to night. I don't know what to make of her."   AGNES STANHOPE.      139 He took out his watch. "It is later than I thought," he muttered. "I promised to be at Mizart's at eight," he added, aloud, " and it wants only three quarters. Gilbert will be impatient." .Both rose. Maitland went out with his friend. The evening was clear and starlit. They went on through the busy streets, Lawrence drawing his arm familiarly through his companion's. At the last corner they stopped. "You will go on with me, Maitland? Gilbert won't keep me long. I am going down to Boulard's at nine, and you won't be any interrup- tion to our business." "No, Lawrence, I don't think I shall get to Boulard's to-night, I am going home for a wonder; the fact is, I don't feel quite well." Lawrence turned for a look at him. "A sudden headache, or the blues? You had better come along, Maitland; nothing like cheerful company for, low spirits." But his friend shook his head, and turned away. Already a dull pain was beginning to shoot through his frame, and to throb in his heated tem- ples. In the short time in which he had reached his own door, his step had grown unsteady, and his brain began to waver. The terrible pain began to grow in paroxysms, lulling for an instant, and rev turning. I He went into the dining-room, where Agnes still sat. She looked up in surprise at hip O                . '*  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7555-00000070"/> "O      AGNES STANHOPE, unexpected appearance, but no words passed be- tween them, and presently he rose from his seat and staggered up to his chamber. " I don't know what is the matter with me," he muttered, "I believe I am going to be ill." He threw himself on the bed, but the restless paroxysms of distress could be borne no longer, and he gave an impatient pull at the bell for his servant. It seemed an interminable length of time to the wretched man, those few moments in which he delayed to make his appearance. He had seized the cord again with an impatient oath, when the door at last opened. "Go for a doctor, James; don't lose any time. I am very sick." The man hurried out. "It's this ma- leria," -he muttered, "fever. How suddenly it has come on. I am burning with it." And his parched tongue and throbbing temples witnessed the truth of his fears. The physician soon made his appearance, and Agnes, roused by the whispers of the servants to a knowledge of this alarming illness, waited timidly in the hall for his reappearance, as he passed to the chamber of his patient. She had long to wait, and when he came down his face wore a troubled and doubtful look. A slight nod of recognition- passed between them as he stepped into the hall, for they had met before at the sick bed of one of her domes- tics. "You find my husban. d very ill, Dr. Lawson," she said,    AGNES STANHOPE.       141 "Very ill Madam,  I have ordered some cooling powders, and blisters. He seems quite out of his head." Agnes' cheek paled a little. This was worse than her fears. I will go to him at once, she thought. Whatever the past, a wife's place in such hours is by her husband's bedside. But she hesitated an in- stant." "This seizure is very sudden, doctor. He seemed in his usual health this morning. Is it a fever?" He bowed.  "It would seem so, Madam. Some of the symptoms are unusual, but I can judge bet- ter to-morrow." He bowed again, and went out, and Agnes passed up to the chamber. The -sick man lay already in a partial stupor, his brow and cheeks hot, his eyes dull and heavy; from which state he was constantly brought back to recollection by his recurring paroxysms. He seemed quite in- sensible of his wife's presence, as she sat beside him, now and then arranging his disordered pillows, and as the still hours went round, presenting the cooling portion to his parched lips. Once or twice he start- ed up in the bed with a murmured oath, and a few broken words escaped him, which fell chillingly on the ear of his watcher, but he quickly sunk back in] a paroxysm to toss wearily to and fro. As the first gray light dawned through the chamber, eclipsing the dim glare of the night-lamp, the doc-  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7555-00000071"/> "2      AGNES STANHOPE. tor's welcome step echoed on the stair, and Agnes left her seat, and came eagerly forward to admit him. He approached the bedside, felt his patient's pulse, and noted anxiously his symptoms. The young wife watched him with uneasy interest. The contracted brow and ominous shake of the head boded ill for the question trembling on her lip. "He has had a bad night," she said. "I see. Mrs. Maitland, it may be necessary to call in additional advice." She bowed, "I leave everything to your discre- tion, Doctor Lawson." Her voice trembled a little. He drew her aside as he was about to quit the room. "Mrs. Maitland," he said, with that pro- fessional air which he could not quite lay aside, even at such a moment, " it may be best that I should tell you your husband seems rapidly growing worse. Unless a favorable change take place. shortly, I fear-" he stopped, Agnes' clasped hands and trembling lips showed him that he had said enough. He touched her arm with an impulse of kindness. "My dear madam, while there is life, there is hope. Be assured that all shall be done which the case will admit of. I will send for Dr. Hubbard, an eminent practicioner. Everything shall be done which -human skill can possibly provide." He quitted the room, leaving the trembling wife to return to her place at the bedside. There she   fI      -   AGNES STANHOPE.       143 sat, her hands wreathed together in her lap, her eyes fixed on vacancy, lost in the reality of the ter- rible blow about to descend upon her. All the past, with its overloaded bitterness, was forgotten in the sight of this hour. The man who lay prostrated. before her, the strength of nerve and muscle gone, lingering on the brink of the ocean of eternity, was no longer the harsh, reproachful husband, the de- stroyer who had lured her from her peaceful home, and tempted her to betray her truest friend, but the lover who had vowed to her perpetual fondness, whom broken fortunes and evil companionship had drawn from her side. What that he had failed in all her dreams, that day by day had seen her girlish ideal divested of all its coloring, that the old fancy of congeniality of heart and soul had long smolder- ed into hopeless embers, never, never, to be rekind- led- -he was her husband still, the only being to whom she could cling for companionship, succor, hope, her last, last friend! "O, my God, let this cup pass. I cannot, cannot drink it! It is more than flesh can bear " But he who saw the end, and the days hid from the heavy eyes, drew not back the still array of theJ future at a weak mortal's cry. Still the hot cheek and- brow burned with the inward fire, still the deadly pain shot through the' sinking vitals, and the broken, inchorent words murmured form the paling lips.  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7555-00000072"/> "4      AGNES STANHOPE. The hours rstole on, the gray twilight deepened into the full October morn, the roll of vehicles and the echoes of footsteps filled the street. The little household, too, was astir, with hushed footfalls and low voices, for their master's sudden illnesss shed a gloom and a startled anxiety through every heart. Maitland's servant came to the threshold to ask his mistress' orders, but Agnes was too lost in her sorrow to heed his presence, and he withdrew in re- spectful silence. The breakfast waited untasted in the dining-room, the muffled peal of the bell came unheeded to the sick chamber, all was confusion and uncertainty. Noon drew on, and the street bell announced the return of the physician. He came accompanied by the brother practitioner he had mentioned, and A g- nes roused from her stupor as she caught the wel- come echo of their steps in the hall. She rose with a momentary return of hope to receive them, hope which in such hours dies so slowly out of the hu- man heart. Maitland had lain more quiet since the day had opened, the paroxysms of pain had quite ceased, a dull lethargetic sleep, accompanied by a cold perspiration, had succeeded them. The new physician stood for some moments by the bedside, now and then making his inquiries in an undertone of the faithful watcher, and then the two withdrew a little apart in the alcove of the window. They   AGNES STANHOPE.       145 spoke together for an instant, and then Agnes saw them about to quit the room. She followed them tremblingly, and touched Doctor Lawson's arm as he paused on the threshold. "Is he not better? He breathes easier, the pain seems gone." "My dear Madam, I am sorry to distress you, but I fear the disease has taken its worst form." Agnes gasped, and leaned against the side of the door for support. She comprehended the whole \of this terrible announcement. Rallying in a moment she seized his hand. '"How long, Doctor?" Her quivering lips revealed the, nature of the inquiry she could not put into words. He hesitated, but her entreating look conquered. "Possibly until night-to-morrow at farthest. He may brighten up and come to himself before he goes." a Agnes loosened her hand from its grasp. She had heard enough, and she suffered them to depart in silence. She went to the- window, the air of the room seemed close and stifling. Without the dead leaves were dropping silently down on the side- walk, there was the roll of carriages, the hurry of feet, bright, eager faces hurrying to business or pleasure. The glare of the sun oppressed her, she shrank from the array of flowers in a window over the way ; in her heart all was desolation and anguish. A faint sigh drew her back to the bed, her foot  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7555-00000073"/> "      AGNEs STAWBOPE. fell noiselessly on the soft Turkey carpet. Maitland's eyes were open, and the first ray of returning con- sciousness shone in their troubled depths. He look- ed up- to meet the agitated gaze of his wife. "Where am I, Agnes?"  The hand he essayed to raise fell feebly on the counterpane.  The tide of recollection surged with a sudden rush. " O I re- member I " he faltered. "I cannot rise, and every- thing is so dim before me. Has the Doctor come? Agnes, Agnes, what is this?" It is Death, thought his terrified companion, but she answered in a voice which all her effort could not steady. "You are very ill, Maitland. You have had a sick night." "What does the Doctor say?" She could not trust her voice to a reply. The silence smote back the dreadful truth upon his heart. "O my God! I cannot, cannot die I Something must be done for me, Agnes." He tried to rise, but only to sink down  exhausted by the struggle. He lay still, his pale hands feebly interclasped, the cold drops of perspiration standing in beads upon his brow. Stopped with such frightful suddenness in the midst of his reckless career, called from the rattle of the dice, and the excitement of a vicious love- whither? "Open the window.   Agnes, give me   AGNES STANHOPE.       147 breath I "She flew to obey him. The soft autumn air came in with a rush over his temples, the din of the street, the low rustle of falling leaves close by, and the hum of distant voices, came sweetly to his ear. To leave all these for the cold dark grave. Old tendernesses began to knock at his heart, his kind uncle's face rose before him, the pleasant days of his far off childhood, softening vaguely into a sense of the desolate young creature who wept at his pillow. His sight was already failing, his- ear growing dull, the shining panes of glass in the dis- tant window began to darken, and the room to fill with shadows. He reached out his hand over the counterpane as if to grasp for support. He saw not the glories of the radiant sphere which was close upon him. He saw- not the long lost faces which clothed in the radiance of angels stood forth to welcome him. - In his heart filled with broken duties, and remorseful days he could not discern the pity and tenderness of the infinite Father. All was darkness in the past, and a wild troubled dread be- fore him. Agnes rose from her place where she had knelt by his pillow, and took up the little volume, with its glittering gold clasps, which lay unused on her toi- let table. She turned over tremblingly to passages she had read with Bertha, which now came back il- lumining as by a lightning flash the darkness of the  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7555-00000074"/> "8      AGNES STANHOPE. I    hour, but her voice faltered as the low verse stole forth, and as she looked to the bed she saw with a deadly faintness at'her heart that it fell upon a dull ear. Who shall say at these solemn moments when the eye is dull and the ear sealed how God prepares us, the good and the evil, for the vast change. "Take me, take me with you, Maitland!"It was a cry of anguish which might have penetrated the ear of the dying. It did win back an answer, the dull eye opened, and threw a last dim look through  the glooming twilight, the lips moved, "Bertha-Uncle Philip -" but voice was gone. A moment more, and Agnes lay extended on the floor as insensible to all her sorrow as the white, rigid form on the bed beside her. She awoke in her guest chamber, to which she had been removed in her swoon. She started as on turning with an effort to recollect herself she felt the bed beneath her, and the agonizing truth came back. Her maid stood beside her with a cup con- tainng a  cordial in her hand. "You are worn out, my lady. You need food and rest.   You have taken nothing since yesterday. Please try some wine, and let me tell Jane to bring up a slice of toast." "No, no," said Agnes. "I cannot eat, I  need nothing." She tried to rise, but sunk, back again fainting, and found herself compelled to take the   AGNES STANHOPE.       149 cordial which the girl pressed upon her. It revived her, and she rose to return to her husband's room. The last sad orders must be given, the last mourn- ful arrangements made. As she sat down in the dimly lighted chamberby the white-robed form ar- rayed for its last sleep her thoughts flew back into the past. She recalled, as we all do when the last word is spoken, and the last duty done, a thousand occasions where she had failed, where she might have borne more patiently, or rendered a kindlier service. Provocation and injustice were forgotten, she saw with a clearer light into the past, and noth- ing but pity and tenderness remained. God be mer- ciful to the poor sinning soul who has gone into his presence! God forgive him as freely as I whose happiness he has blighted I Her tears flowed si- lently, they relieved her, and when the morning dawned upon her lonely watch she had settled into outward calmness. She went down at the summons of the breakfast bell. There were orders to give, duties to fulfil, which needed all the strength she could gather. How her heart longed with a'sick longing at this hour for Bertha's presence. Long- ed and pined in vain. She dared not write. The sin of her shameful ingratitude stood between her and that only friend; she dared not beseech her pity. Rumors of Maitland's course must have reached her, the whispers which, came to the ear of Mrs.  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7555-00000075"/> 150      AGNES STANHOPE. Moreton at lonely Southsea, must also have flown to Suffolk. No, and a little lingering pride rose up in poor Agnes' bosom, she would not come back to Bertha in her destitution and repentance; far rather would she seek a precarious subsistence by her own labor, a subsistence for the little time which remained to her to -bear her burden of loneliness and sorrow, which she felt in her heart would be short. Ah, how little she knew that our strength is increased torour day, and that we die all of us at God's ap- pointed time.   Grief, never kills, it may sap the springs of life, but there is a voice beyond which bids us come, or which in its here mysterious provi- dences raises us up to do our remaining work when the sun has set and the pale rays of the moon alone linger to light our way. With outward calmness then, Agnes roused her- self to go through all the necessary arrangements. The quiet of a darkened chamber where her tears could flow unrestrained was not for her, and per- haps it is ever as well when this necessity for exer- tion summons us from the indulgence of grief. Later in the day an unexpected shock awaited her. She had retired to her chamber, and thrown herself upon her couch in the vain hope of finding a few moments forgetfulness in slumber, when her maid entered to- announce a  visitor below. She arose in some surprise, and proceeded to the draw-   AGNES STANHOPE.       151 ing-room, where she found Doctor Lawson awaiting her. "I beg your pardon for my intrusion, Madam," he said, rising, respectfully, "'I have come on a painful errand." She regarded him earnestly, at a loss for this sin- gular speech. What could there be that was pain- ful for her now in life? .Bertha-surely not. "What evil news can you have for me, Doctor Lawson?" she faltered, as the kind physician hesitated. "Madam, the circumstances of your husband's illness were unusual. I beg you prepare yourself-- I am unwilling to distress you. But his symptoms would justify an examination." "O no! no!" she sunk horror-struck into the chair by which-she stood. "Howard would never do that. So unwilling to die, so anguished, too- You are mistaken, sir." "' It is possible," he answered gravely. ' I make no charges against your husband, Mrs. Maitland. The potion taken, if potion there were, may have been administered by some other hand. But this I say--the symptoms of the case. warrant an exami- nation, both in the opinion of Dr. Hubbard and my- self." "O, no, no I it is too horrible," she repeated, "and I cannot consent to. such a profanation." Dr. ^Lawson contemplated her with an unchanged expression.  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7555-00000076"/> 152      AGNES STANHOPE. "It is absolutely necessary, Madam, I grieve to say, since it so distresses you." "But why?  I assure you it is impossible my husband could have taken it himself, and Maitland had no enemies." She was trembling from head to foot. The horri- ble suspicion had sent a chill through her frame. "Accept my assurances, Madam, that under the circumstances it cannot be dispensed with, painful as it is to your feelings. I beg you to be composed. Shall I ring for your salts, or a glass of water?"He reached out to touch the bell. "O, no I I shall be better in a moment. I have suffered so much in the last few hours-and this is so terrible. I will go to my room. I submit to your opinion, Dr. Lawson. Since you insist upon the mat- ter, I have no choice." She went out. The last solemn ceremony awaited her on the morrow, which was to task all her strength--the committal of the hallowed form to its now kindred dust. It was in one of the crowded London grave- yards that this last resting-place was made ; no green myrtles grew over the narrow mounds which rose thickly around, breathing of the love which lives on with the eternal life of the spirit; but the cold white slabs glistened silently in the sunset, bearing in their black lettered inscriptions names forgotten in the busy haunts of the living. No graceful larches, no   AGNES STANHOPE.       153 drooping willows,- or even the modest wild flowers which grace the country cemeteries, blew around, but the short grass was faded and brown with the autumn rains, and the roll of noisy vehicles, with the hum of eager life, profaned the repose which to lov- ing hearts hallows the sepulchre. Agnes bent forward to catch a last glimpse of the lonely spot from the window of the carriage. Her tears fell fast and silently. "O, Maitland! is this the end, the awful end? - How can I leave thee here to darkness and the worm, my husband--thou, who a day ago wert so full of life and strength? Is this the end of our love, our sinful love? The lips that tempted me are dumb; the hand that clasped mine is palsied. Does the soul live on? Alas I! alas! who shall answer my cry?" , The little! volume her trembling fingers had un- closed in the parting hour would have answered this passionate prayer, and to it Agnes did turn at last, as in the gray dusk of twilight she paced her lonely chamber to and fro in the bitterness of desolation. Friendless, comfortless, the poor young wife, now the most -desolate of widows, groped in the darkness for the ray of light which might come to gild the per- petual evening she saw before her. She came slowly to the beautiful chapter which Bertha in her night of sorrow had chosen at the bedside of the dying cot- tager, and her heart took in tremblingly its tender comforts.    8  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7555-00000077"/> 154      AGNES STANHOPE. We grow strong by sorrow; it is the fiery trial which helps to mould the soul for its high destiny. Agnes knew not this yet; she had only taken up over the grave of her husband the tangled thread, which was to be slowly parted and unravelled in her hands, the solemn mystery of the purposes of this strange life. The love that is kindled here lives forever. This truth which is woven deeply into the being of us all, rpse afresh from the solemn words before her, but there were other thoughts which pressed heavily up- on-her heart. "God, the Merciful, the Father, why should he have suffered me to undergo this ordeal of temptation, where I was sure to fall, while others with far less elements of purity and truth pass on in flow- ery pathways? Had that fatal London visit been shared by Bertha, Maitland, with all his waverings, had kept his honor unsullied, and I to-night should not be weeping over his blighted career, an outcast from all I love, homeless and shelterless." To most of us at some period in our earth journey does this pain- ful question come, when those in whom our hopes are garnered pass from the circle of the living, when the fruits of our faults ripen in our way, or when uncon- genial surroundings press their thorns secretly upon us. To many comes the answer in this life, as a few rolling years open the benificent purposes behind the cloud, but many, very many, pass beyond the vail ere that day is reached, to read them, we reverently believe, in the fuller light of heaven.   CHAPTER XII. As the gray dawn came on, Agnes rose calm and serene from her mournful vigils. The rosy daylight extinguishing the glare of the lamp brought back her thoughts to the duties before her. She must rouse herself from the luxury of grief. She must turn her attention to some means of procuring her daily bread. Her present expensive establishment must be broken up, and the servants dismissed. She knew very well the scantiness of her resources, that after defraying the expenses of the funeral, the charges of the physicians, and the arrears of the ser- vants, but a few pounds would probably remain in her purse. What should she do? What employ- ment should she seek? She turned it over absently. Her mind was in no condition for close reflection. A governess. O, no, she had no recommendations to offer, if her education fitted her for such a task. She had some knowledge of music, and embroidery; both of these might be useful. But she would wait till another day had stilled a little the hurry of her thoughts, before settling upon any definite plan. She went down to the breakfast room at the usu-  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7555-00000078"/> Ji     156      AGNES STANHOPE. al hour, and forced herself to partake of a cup of chocolate, and a slice of toast. This over, the house- keeper presented herself to learn her orders for the day, and to gather from her mistress, if possible, with- out direct inquiry, something of her purposes for the future. These Agnes promptly- imparted, so far as they related to the breaking up of her household, and her desire that her servants would at once seek to provide themselves with other situations. In a week at farthest they must be prepared to accept dismissal, sooner if circumstances permitted them to enter into service elsewhere, Agnes then returned to her chamber, to seek the repose which for three long nights had not visited her eyelids. She had just sunk into a light slumber when she was suddenly roused by the abrupt entrance of her maid.  She half started from her pillow, and looked a displeased inquiry. "Lucy, did I not tell you I wished not to be, disturbed?" "Your pardon, my lady; but there are two gen- tlemen waiting to see you below. I told them you were worn out with so much trouble, and had lain down, but they said their business admitted of no delay." "Strange," thought Agnes, as she rose. Mes- sengers from Bertha? No; they would not be so discourteous. She stopped at the mirror mechanically to smooth her disordered hair and went down.   *  AGNES STANHOPE.       157 "I have an order for your arrest, Madam." - One of the men came forward toward her. "For my arrest!"  Agnes sunk down in the chair she had reached. "On what charge?" "You will know soon enough. Do not keep us waiting. The hack is at the door." She put her hand wearily to her forehead as if to clear her senses. Was it not all a confused dream? The officer's rough voice roused her. She could not distinguish the words, but she tried to rally. "Tell me first of what I am accused., I have a right to demand this." "Of poisoning your husband, Madam." Agnes grew deadly white and wavered in her chair. The suddenness of the horrible charge over- whelmed her. Alas, to the suspicious eyes before her, accus- tomed to crime in all its loathsome forms, her terror presented the lively symptoms of conscious guilt. They were not without a rude feeling of humanity, however, and one of them hurried to open the win- dow, while the other rang violently for her maid, who made her appearance hardly less agitated than her mistress. The fresh air, with the liberal appli- cation of salts, soon revived her; and at a whisper- ed order her maid withdrew, to return with her bonnet and shawl, herself attired to accompany them, for, in common with the other servants, she  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7555-00000079"/> I     s158    AGNES STANHOPE.   * had been summoned as a witness, at the examina- tion. Passively Agnes suffered herself to be array- ed in them, and declining assistance, by a mechani- cal gesture, preceded the officers to the door. Here she was handed into the coach, followed by her maid, and the vehicle drove rapidly off. The ride passed like the bewilderment of a dream, and only when she found herself in the court room, where the examination was to take place, did she awake to a full sense of the horrors of her situation. Care had been taken to render this preliminary step to acquit- tal or trial, as private as the circumstances of the case would admit of, yet there were several specta- tors, whose eyes turned with the rude stare of curi- osity upon the pale young creature about to be ar- raigned on the awful charge of murder. "Where is your counsel, madam?" said the gray- headed Judge, bending a stern look on the wild young face uplifted to the bench. "I have none, sir." The Judge stooped to speak for a moment with the officer who had conducted the arrest, and who now forced his way up to his side. "The Court will grant you a sufficient interval to procure counsel," he said, raising his head and at- tentively regarding the prisoner. "I thank your Honor," said Agnes, faintly. I have no means and no friends."   AGNES STANHOPE.       159 A little stir took place in a distant part of the court-room, and a gentlemanly-looking attorney stepped forward. He halted at the bench, and said a few words in a repressed tone to the Judge. "This gentleman offers to be your counsel, mad- am," said Judge Rathburn, in a tone which betray- ed some little surprise. Agnes bowed an eager acceptance, and sank down into the chair, which one of the officers, noticing her pallid looks, humanely placed inside the bar. The first witness was called, and Agnes raised her heavy eyes in momentary surprise, at Doctor Law- son's presence upon the stand. He testified readily to the results of the post mortem examination of the deceased, to the finding of arsenic in the stomach, in sufficient quantities to have produced death. He allowed that the symptoms of the case had perplex- ed him from the commencement, and with evident reluctance, suffered the fact of Agnes' absence from the sick-bed, at his first appearance, to be drawn out, as well as her extreme distress in view of the post mortem examination. He had attended in the family previously, on a short illness of one of the do- mestics, and testified to his conviction of the unhap- py terms on which the master and mistress lived. He was followed by Dr. Hubbard, who testified also, to the presence of arsenic in the stomach. Agnes' maid was next called forward as a wit-  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7555-00000080"/> lll160        AGNEp STANHOPE. ness. Although she knew nothing bad of her un- happy mistress, yet fancying she did, she stood trembling like a culprit, before the majesty of the offended law, and the hesitation and incoherency with which her answers were given, bore hard against the cause she would fain have supported. She allowed to the unhappy state of feeling existing between her master and mistress, to Maitland's dis- sipated life, and to the accused's passionate remon- strances, which she had once or twice overheard, on his harshness and neglect. Her mistress went but rarely abroad, she said, and received but little com- pany. Then followed the particulars of the short illness and death, in which Agnes' overwrought sen- sibilities wore the aspect of guilt to the eyes of men already blinded by suspicion. The other servants succeeded, one by one, with their testimony, each, little in itself, but all added to the mass of doubt. They proved recrimination, jealousy, threats of sep- aration; what more powerful incentives would be needed by a passionate, revengeful woman, dragged down to the level of a gambler's wife. The Judge summed up the evidence briefly, and announced a committal for trial. Agnes heard like one in a dream; she had no sense of the hundred curious eyes turned upon her. The officer approached her to assume his charge; the rude grasp of his hand upon her arm, roused  AGNES STANHOPE.        161 her to recollection. She shuddered with a vague sense of contamination, and making a helpless effort to shake off his hold, suffered him to lead her to the hack, which waited at the door to convey her to Newgate. Yes, to one of the loathsome cells of the criminals. We pass briefly over this part of our gloomy chapter. The dismal sights which thrilled every nerve, and the boding terrors which pressed upon her brain, till she found herself alone in her narrow stone cell, dimly lighted by a grated loop-hole in the wall, and furnished only with a coarse straw pallet, table, and chair. She threw herself upon her bed, and burying her face convulsively in her hands, tried to shut out the horrors of her situation. The last rays of day-light soon faded out from the little cell, and she was aroused by the rough grating of the key in the door. It swung heavily on its hinges, giving entrance to the noiseless steps of the turnkey. The man bore in his hand a loaf of bread and a pitcher of water, which, with an intimation that better fare could be procured for pay, he set down on the table and went out. Agnes rose and held the pitcher eagerly to her parched lips. - A feverish thirst was beginning to prey upon her. She went back to hei pallet, and as the night drew on, tried to compose herself to sleep, but in its place a hundred frightful images started up. What would be the end of this 8*  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7555-00000081"/> 162      AGNES STANHOPE. accusation? What if she should be condemned? Heads as innocent had bowed to the rope. Yes, they had gone forth from this very prison. She hid her face in her hands with a shudder of convulsive terror. Was there none to save her? Bertha, Colonel Maitland! She must send to them - beg for help. In such an awful strait, pride and shame were gone. But, ah, what could they do? The stern, unpitying faces of the court-room rose up before her. The law held her in its iron clutches. The stern, gray-headed Judge upon the bench, tears and prayers could not- sway him; the gold of the Indies showered at his feet, could not buy her doom. Death I death! a merciless, shameful death! She must not think of it,-she should grow wild. Who had been the tenant of this narrow cell be- fore her? Her eyes flew open, as if they could pierce the darkness. Was it some young creature like herself, crushed by the pressure of evil circum- stances from her cradle, and who, unlike herself, shrank from the darkness, filled with its dread array of crime? Or was it some old, white-headed crim- inal, whom a long course of wrong had ripened for the gallows, who waited here the morn which was to usher in his sentence, the blood red sentence of his brother man, who never reached forth a hand to help him, in his path to destruction? Did the long days go by here, sullen, prayerless?   AGNES STANHOPE.       163 Bertha -where was she, to-night? In pleasant Harrowdale, happy in her husband, honoring do- mestics, troops of friends, while her sister was lying in her stone cell, on her miserable pallet of straw, trembling for the morrow. O, who could have dreamed of this day,- in their peaceful past, in the - happy days of Hawthorndean! Whence had this dark cloud risen, shutting out earth and heaven? Whence came the fatal draught which had taken Maitland's life? Was it, could it be his own act? O, no, no. Never human being- shrank with fuller terror from the dark abyss of eternity. And yet he had no enemies. She had said it with her own lips, as Doctor Lawson had unwillingly testified that day -on the stand. This dark mystery, how could it be solved? As she recalled what she had heard an hour ago, she could but own that appearances pressed hard against her. The day broke at last, and the dull, gray dawn penetrated slowly through the iron grate. It broke not now in a shower of golden light, over the snowy coverings of the bed, the bright tints of the carpet, and the white covered toilet table, but it struggled in dimly, revealing the gray walls, and the solitary table and chair. The turnkey came again, with the frugal jail meal, which he silently set down on the table. Agnes longed to address the man, to ask who had been the  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7555-00000082"/> 164      AGNES STANHOPE. last occupant of this cell; to hear his voice, a human voice, in her dismal solitude, but his dark looks and! scowling brow chilled her, and she suffered him to go in silence. So the long morning wore on, and it was near noon when she distinguished the faint echo of steps in the passage without. They halted at her door; again the key rattled in the lock, but this time it opened not to re-admit the turnkey, but the attor- ney who had come forward in her behalf at the ex- amination.- A faint flush suffused the waxen pale- ness ofAgnes' cheek, as she rose from the chair and assumed a seat on the pallet. The lawyer took the vacated seat without any appearance of embarrass- ment. He bowed courteously to his client, and waited till the door had closed, and the jailor's step died away in the passage, before he spoke. Then he took up the subject of his visit without delay, re- garding meanwhile with a cool, searching look, the trembling figure before him.- "My dear madam, we will not stand on ceremony with each other. It is necessary in order to the successful issue of your case that I should be put in full possession of, the particulars, as far as they lie in your own knowl- edge. And first in order, that I may be prepared for all that may spring up, it is vitally important that you should regard me as your confessor, as to your innocence or participation in the charge.   AGNES STANHOPE.       165 Agnes looked up. Her bewildered ear failed to catch the substance of his guarded inquiry. "You need not fear to trust me, madam," he went on.  "Your counsel is bound to secresy, whatever you may reveal to him, and, indeed, his interests are one with his clients." "I understand you, sir," said Agnes, with a shudder. '"God forgive you and others, for such cruel doubts. I am as guiltless of this awful crime as the babe unborn." "Secondly, then, madam, on whom do your sus- picions fall?" "Alas, I have no suspicions." The lawyer shook his head. "This will not do," he said, gravely. "Is it your opinion that your un- fortunate husband, in a fit of desperation brought on by his losses and reckless life, took the poison him- self?" Alas, again, I have proof to the contrary. No man could die in such anguish without a confession. No man in the last moments clung more passionate- ly to life." The lawyer moved uneasily. "That looks bad for you, madam. We must look to some other quarter, then, to solve this mystery. Were you fa- miliar with your husband's acquaintances? - Do you know any of his associates?" "Only one, familiarly; Mr. Lawrence. A great friendship existed between them."  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7555-00000083"/> 166      AGNES STANHOPE, "Was he at all likely to be in your husband's debt?" "On the contrary, Maitland owed him large sums." "What of this jealousy Miss Jane testified to? Was it your husband's general habits, or a special connection?" Agnes colored; she could not hear allusion to this subject, even in such an hour, without pain. "If you please, sir, we will drop this matter, it would answer no purpose." The attorney shook his head, coldly. "Possibly not. We must fall back, then, on the ground of suicide, and there are some objections to that. Still it will make a pretty safe argument; your husband's wretched habits and involvments, would be enough to lead the sanest man to think of self-destruction- drawn out and held up by a skilful hand, too. Mrs. Maitland, I have undertaken your case solely from motives of philanthropy;" with a graceful wave of the hand. "I demand nothing for my services, but means will be required to some extent, to conduct the case skilfully -junior counsel, witnesses, etc." "I am destitute, sir." Her face sunk in her hands; nothing could exceed-the hopelessness of her attitude and voice. "You are well born, madam, and of gentle breed- ing. Is it possible you have no friends?"   AGNES STANHOPE.       167 "I had," she answered, " but my husbands--my- self," she added firmly, raising her head.- "I hare alienated my only relative and friend." "But at such a strait, under such a charge, sure- ly you would not ask for assistance in vain, whatev- er your offence; the disgrace of a public sentence, too." Agnes was silent. "Empower me to apply for you; give me the name of your connection." "Is it absolutely necessary sir, to my acquittal?" "It is absolutely necessary, madam." "If I could have spared her the anguish, the shame-" she spoke up aloud. "I must then direct you to Colonel Maitland, of Harrowdale. His wife is a near connection. For her sake he will grant whatever you may ask." "Maitland; that was your husband's name?" "Yes ;" she turned with a distressed look from the inquiry. He rose. "Our business is at an end. I will trouble you no further, madam. In a few days I hope to see you, and report favorable progress." The turnkey, whose step he had already caught in the passage, now threw open the door, and with a courteous bow, hardly returned by the pale pris- oner, he passed out.       4   &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7555-00000084"/> CHAPTER  XIII. We go back to Bertha, from whom we have been so long separated, to follow the more eventful for- tunes of the heroine of our history. Still in London, but many squares removed from dismal Newgate, with its dark cells and wretched criminals. It is at the fashionable West end, in the boudoir of a man- sion rising in stately grandeur among its compeers, that we find the wife of Col. Maitland. The pale, rose-tinted hangings of the walls shed a soft glow over her bright, young face, and her clear hazel eyes wear the serene light of content. Very rich are her surroundings; all that the most fastidious fancy can crave, or gold bestow; but it is not these which flush the full cheek, or kindle the smile upon the rosy lip; we see that in the radiant glance which welcomes the footstep of her husband in the hall. A noble life, a true companionship, giving and re- ceiving good, cherished, honored, what can the heart ask for more, on earth or in heaven? Colonel Maitland entered with a step unlike its usual light- ness, and a brow from which even his wife's sunny greeting, could not banish the troubled shadow.   AGNES STANHOPE.       169 "What ails you, Philip-?" said Bertha, anxious- ly, as he threw himself into the vacant seat beside her. "You look troubled, and unlike yourself." He took her hand in his, but the smile he strove to force died away upon his lips. "My love, I have heard bad news." "Of Agnes?" she turned quickly upon him* "Forgive me, Philip; why should my thoughts always wander to my unhappy sister, with all your love and kindness - she chose her lot. But speak, Philip, what is it that so moves you?" "You are right, Bertha, it is of Agnes--or, rather of him who was oncewell-nigh as dear to me as your lost sister this day is to you. Bertha, I blame myself for so utterly losing sight of him; I should have known his feebleness of purpose, his weakness; what better proof than his unworthy mar- riage." "It is not too late," said Bertha, timidly. "What- ever evil courses he has taken, love and patience will yet win him back." "It is too late," said Colonel Maitland, mourn- fully. He drew out the morning paper from his pocket and opened at a paragraph without further words, placing it in his wife's hands. She read at the close of the short column of deaths: "In London, October 29th, Howard Maitland, Attorney at Law, aged 31."  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7555-00000085"/> 170     AGNES STANHOPE. Her color changed, tears rushed into her eyes, she put back the paper silently into her husband's hand. She thought of Agnes, her timid, clinging sister, alone in this sorrowful hour of bereavement. What had been the history of those last hidden months? Was it a long, lingering sickness? a mournful vigil of day after day, and week after week, hope and fear struggling in the balance. Why had she not written? O, that one of those hidden influences which move us unawares had but stirred her to seek them out. Colonel Maitland spoke first: I know nothing of this painful mat- ter, Bertha, beyond this little paragraph. Deeply as I now lament my carelessness it were useless to linger over it. There is something left to be done. Shame will prevent poor Agnes from turning to us for succor. We must at once take means to seek her out." Bertha strove to reply, but at that instant the bell rang, and she started as the servant hurried up the stairs. He paused at the door of the boudoir. "I am closely engaged, and cannot see company," said Colonel Maitland, quietly, as the servant an- nounced a visitor. Still the man lingered, but he finally went down, to make a speedy reappearance. "He says his errand is of the last importance and cannot be delayed," and he presented the card he held. Maitland took it and read, "Mr. Burton, Attorney at Law."   AGNES STANHOPE.       171 "I cannot imagine his business. I will be back in a few moments, Bertha," and he went down. The attorney rose and stepped forward at his en- trance. "I have come on a painful errand, Colonel Maitland. A mission connected with the case which came up in the court yesterday." "I am at a loss to understand you, sir." "Is it possible? Ah, I remember, the ease has not crept into to-day's papers, but to-morrow's will be fill. I am retained as counsel, sir, in the case of Mrs. Maitland, the widow of the late Howard Mait- land, who was yesterday committed to stand her trial for the murder of her husband. You are a connection or relative, I think?" The host's color wavered, he took a chair, for hitherto both had been standing, and silently mo- tioned his visitor to resume his seat. "Be so good, sir, as to favor me with the particulars." "My client is charged with administering arsenic to the deceased, a large quantity having been dis- covered in his stomach at the p6st mortem examina- tion, and the unhappy circumstances in which they lived concurring to throw suspicion upon her." "What motive!" said Colonel Maitland, absently. "That is for the prosecution to prove. In the meanwhile my client directed me to you as a rela- tive or friend who would advance the means to suc- cessfully carry on the defence."  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7555-00000086"/> 172      AGNES STANHOPE. Both were silent, the one overwhelmed by the suddenness of the shock, the other waiting respect- fully for his agitation to subside. Presently Colonel Maitland rose and quitted the room. He returned in a few moments with a check which he thrust into the attorney's hand. "I will see you again in a few days, sir."  The lawyer glanced-at the amount of the check, bowed with increased respect as he did so, and took his leave. Colonel Maitland went slowly back to the room where he had left his wife. In the short moment which passed before he reached the door, his mind was made up. He would not reveal to her this new and terrible event. As long as possible this fresh anxiety must be unshared by her whom it would im- press most. Of poor Agnes' innocence he could not entertain a doubt, but the array of circumstances might be dark against her. In the distress of the moment he had forborne to press inquiries upon the attorney, the more that his own secret impressions were strong that his nephew's misfortune and reck- less life had forced him upon suicide. It was a hard task to meet the tearful, anxious- \ face which waited him, and to enter with apparent interest into Bertha's eager plans for the discovery of the lost one. In the wilderness of London it might prove a long and troubled search. Bertha   AGNES STANHOPE.       173 first suggested an advertisement to be inserted in half of the Journals of the metropolis, but this Colo- nel Maitland gently overruled. Beside the uncer- tainty that it would meet her eye, it must of itself be so disguised to escape the comments of others that it would in all probability fail to be understood. Bertha acquiesced with a sigh. The assistance of the police, liberally rewarded, would promise a bet- ter result, and Colonel Maitland colored to himself for the little deception. But how could he tell her of the awful doom which hung over the being who next to himself stood dearest to her on earth? how could he bring to her already troubled heart the doubts and self-reproaches which were lacerating his own? Would that Howard had written to me, he thought. Would that he had remembered old days, and trusted in my affection. I was wrong, I was very wrong. I should not have so utterly lost sight of him. But these regrets were vain, the err- ing nephew had gone where human mercy was no longer needed, and to all that could now be done for the friendless young wife Colonel Maitland now steadily directed his thoughts. On the day but one following, he called on the attorney at his office, and made himself acquainted with the plan of the defence as far as it had pro- gressed. It bore, as the Colonel had anticipated, on the ground of suicide, but he was startled at the dif-  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7555-00000087"/> 174     AGNES STANHOPE. ficulties which he found arrayed against this plea, and began himself to doubt the evidence of his first convictions. The death-bed scene, Howard's evident bewilderment and anguish as acknowledged to the physician by the agitated wife, bore hard against the probability that he had rushed out of life by his own hand. That the poison could have been taken by accident was, of course, impossible. Inquiries must be pushed forward, then, as to the character of his associates. But here Agnes had declared that he had no enemies. Unfortunate admission. Col- onel Maitland turned his steps from the lawyer's office with an increased weight at his heart. He could not conceal from himself that his sister-in- law's chances of acquittal were uncertain, that a fearful mass of evidence was accumulating against her. He had instructed the lawyer to acquaint her on his early visit to her cell with the fact of his in- tervention, and to assure her that on her release every service which friendship and sympathy could bestow awaited her. More it was unnecessary to say, and the assurance he felt would shed no little hope on the gloom of her despair. A letter from Bertha, a few lines full of a revival of the old love, might have been better, but this could not be. He said it over sorrowfully to himself as he turned homeward. - After all he was not sure that conceal- ment was best, even for the kindest purposes. How   AGNES STANHOPE.       175 would Bertha bear up under the possible shock of her sister's condemnation? All, then, must be known. And yet he could not bring himself in this doubtful certainty to make her a sharer of the anxi- ety which pressed with its iron weight upon his own heart and brain. He was secretly dissatisfied, too, with the abilities of the lawyer who had undertaken the case. So complicated a matter required more than ordinary skill; but at this late hour a change was impossible; he had taken his brief, and must be re- tained. What if Bertha should accidentally discov- er all that he strove to conceal? The thought stag- gered him for a moment. But he must take double care. He had already taken measures to exclude the morning papers from the breakfast room for a day or two, a course which must be renewed when the trial should come on; and fortunately for the success of his plan, Bertha absorbed in the anxiety of her sister's concealment, and their efforts for her discovery, as well as the natural shock of Howard's sudden death, had no desire to mingle in company, or to receive visitors. This mutual sorrow, too, fur- nished the only possible excuse for his own changed appearance and pre-occupation. So the weeks wore round till the day of trial ar- rived. The learned counsel for the prosecution opened the attack in a strong plea, briefly summing up the  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7555-00000088"/> 176     AGNES STANHOPE. charges, and the points which the mass of evidence was to establish. The prisoner at the bar stood accused of one of the most horrible crimes on human record, the cold deliberate murder of her husband, to whom but a few short months before she had solemnly taken her vows to love and honor. It was true no eye saw her mix the fatal draught, and no witness stood ready to testify to the day of its purchase; but what secret opportunities would be lacking to a wife to-drug the glass of water, or the noonday meal? And well might the brain which could plan so terri- ble a crime plot for the unsuspected possession of the deadly means..-The whole circumstances at- tending the commission of the crime evinced an atrocity seldom paralleled, and a depth of corrup- tion rare in one so young, and apparently of such gentle breeding. Yet what incitements could be dragged forth from the annals of crime more press- ing upon a proud, revengeful woman, than those which the prosecution was about to show? It woull prove that the deceased, during the last months of his life, lived upon the gambling table, and was no stranger to the cup which goes hand in hand with this most demoralizing of vices. It would show harshness, not to say positive unkindness on the part of the husband toward the wife, cold- ness, neglect, a threat of separation, and more than   AGNES STANHOPE.        1" these, the existence of an intrigue, which however true or unfounded, was jealously believed by the latter, and made the fruitful subject of altercation and reproach. It would reveal the singular conduct of the prisoner, when the question of the post mortem examination was first brought up, and during the short period of the sickness, as well as the two days intervening to the funeral. The sister of the de- ceased would testify to the unhappy state in which the parties lived, and to the deceased's avowal to her of his wife's state of feeling toward him. Her visit to them closed but a few days previous to this sudden death, how singular that it should have been so cautiously withheld, that this sister, his nearest and only of kin, should be left to gather the start- ling event from the column of a daily journal, where it had accidentally found entrance.  Still more singular from the total isolation and friendless- ness in which the young widow seems to have been placed. We shall see that it was not through her orders that the physician was first called in, but by the di- rection of the sick man privately given to his ser- vant, and that it took her by surprise is plain from the want of her presence in the sick chamber at his first appearance. How were the nursing and the night watch carried on? By the accused, entirely; she rejected the offers of her own maid, of the 9  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7555-00000089"/> 178      AGNES STANHOPE. housemaid, Miss Jane, and of the deceased's ser- vant, all of whom seem to have been anxious to lighten her labors. Wherefore but to administer afresh of the deadly draught in the quieting po- tions she was pressing hour after hour to his parch- ed lips! She feared her work was not well done. It was a first trial; the very terror of so awful a crime made her hurry it on to its completion. It would not do to draw back. Who shall say sus- picion was not already waking in the clouded mind of the dying man? He must see no one, no ear but hers must be near to catch his dying whisper. What more natural than the long deadly fainting fit when all was over, when her deed lay before her, for I repeat she was fresh in crime. Fierce as was the passion which had hurried her on, deep as was the sense of crying wrongs and humiliations close at hand, old memories might not have been quite blot- ted out, and the picture of the gallows, and this court-room of to-day, might have stood out in pro- spective. With all the careful preparedness of the physician, with all the wrong and coldness which had-been heaped upon her, that the mere sight of this man's death struggle should have so over- whelmed her is, to say the least, very surprising. We hear of no bursts of sorrow on her awaking, no tokens of grief. She is calm, wonderfully com- posed. The seryants look to her for orders, she   AGNES STANHOPE.       179 makes arrangements for her mourning trousseau, gives- directions for the early preparations for the funeral, and retires to her chamber to seek repose with as much serenity as if the past night had been wearied out in the fatigues of a ball-room. We go on to the visit of the physician, the first hint of a necessity of the post mortem examination. What does she say? Most women, we grant, would shrink from such a subject. He tells her he has come on a painful errand. She falters and turns pale.  There is the quickened perception of con- scious guilt, guilt which has no peace. She inter- dicts the matter at one. "O, no I You are mistak- en, sir. Howard would never do that!" as-if the question of suicide alone could enter into the mat- ter. He persists, and she yields at last to the strong law  of necessity saying, "I have no choice in the matter." We pass on to the arrest. She wavers and turns white when the officers announce the charge, "You are accused of poisoning  your hus- band, Madam." Here is another evidence of con- scious guilt. What innocent woman would, swoon at such a charge. Innocence is strong! It may tremble and grow pale under a false charge, but it is never wont to take refuge in deadly swoons and helpless terror. We turn from the bearing of the prisoner to another point in the matter. My learn- ed brother may assert that the deceased took the fa-  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7555-00000090"/> 180      AGNES STANHOPE. tal potion with his own hands y Against this, we have, first, the 'direct avowal of the prisoner, made in the excitement of an unguarded moment to the friendly physician, and secondly, the important fact that not a sentence can be adduced to sh6w that his mind at any time turned on the project of self-de- struction. He was a young man, in the prime and flower of his years,of honorable connections, with no small share of talent, once a pleader at this very bar, and, not yet so deteriorated by the deadly vice he had taken to his embrace as to recklessly throw away his life. We find that he was in the posses- sion of a handsome establishment, paid for, it is true, from the gaming table, but this fact seems to show that he was favored with an almost constant run of luck. One other point remains to be touched upon, and this is the character of his associates, and the possibility that the poison might have been adminis- tered from some other source. And here, again, the question is unguardedly made answer to by the prisoner, "He had no enemies." Other testimony, too, comes up to confirm this point. Your Honor, and you, Gentlemen of the Jury, have a pain- ful duty before you. But it is a duty you owe to the safeguards of society, to the sanctity and pro- tection of homes. It is a duty you owe to your fellow beings. It is a duty you owe to that God who in his solemn providences has unravelled the   AGNES STANHOPE.       181 web of this dark transaction, and brought up this hideous crime from its chamber of concealment and secrecy. Weigh well the evidence which shall ap- pear before you, and, need I urge, suffer not the sex and youth of the prisoner to balance with your verdict. Colonel Maitland was present in Court.  He threw an anxious glance at the prisoner during the delivery of this long address, The slight wasted form, the large sorrowful eyes, the drooping face, as completely divested of coloring as a marble likeness, appealed powerfully to his compassion. The physicians were first called upon the stand. They testified as at the examination, without any material difference, and the short cross-examination of the defence was unable to shake any points in their evidence. The next witness who appeared was the prisoner's maid. She testified, as previously, to the unhappy relations existing between her master and mistress, to his late hours, and not unfrequent acquaintance with the wine-cup. She testified, also, to the sub- stance of one or two overheard conversations, evi- dently of remonstrance and entreaty on the part of the wife, met with sullenness and contempt on the part of the husband. She testified, too, to her mis- tress' general isolation from society, to her depression of spirits, and evident discouragement. The fact of  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7555-00000091"/> 182      AGNES STANHOPE. Mrs. Moreton's visit was brought forward in her tes-- timony, the reformatory effect it seemed to produce for a time on the habits of the deceased, and the pe- riod intervening between this visit and the date of her master's short sickness accurately fixed. The particulars of the prisoner's deportment during this sudden illness and death were also drawn out, gwith the circumstance of her swoon at the arrest. Here the witness closed, and the counsel for the defence declining the privilege of a cross-examination, she descended from the stand. The housemaid followed. Her evidence had a more direct bearing on the case, as she not only con- firmed all that had been testified by her predeces- sors, but brought out some new facts, the fragments of Agnes' last remonstrance with her husband, which the reader may well remember.  Could the suspic- ious servant, now fully convinced in her startled mind of her mistress' guilt, have presented this important conversation in its full particulars, it might have produced a far more favorable impression on the minds of the hearers. than it did in disjointed senten- ees, clothed in the garb of her own convictions. Agnes had started at the counsel's allusion to Al- ice Maitland, and a shudder had twice or thrice crossed her at his denunciatory expressions toward herself, but now. for the first time she raised her heavy eyes with a thrill of astonishment and indig-   AGNES STANHOPE.       183 nation to the face of the witness. She failed for-the instant to recognize her own passionate remonstrance to her husband in the harsh and bitter language which another placed upon her lips. The threat'of separation-ah, that was true enough, and the mo- mentary fire faded out of her troubled eyes, and they fell again. "Better part than live in taunts." Yes, he had said that, but Maitland, like most men of his habits and passions, had not spoken the truth, Whatever their short married life had been, what- ever her own faults, this truth came preciously gar- nered from its sorrows, that the language of recrim- ination or reproach had been rare upon her lips. But who would believe her? Not the Judge upon the bench, nor the sturdy, heavy-looking. Jurors, placed in their seats to sentence away an innocent life, not the crowded court-room of spectators, not one of whom out of a hundred looked upon her but with cold, curious eyes, as one of the vilest of crimi- nals, raised up by the very horror of her crime a mark for wonder. Next through tho crowd a way was forced for a lady attired with fashion and elegance, and whose thick veil could not conceal the air of ease and breed- ing which mark the woman of station.  Another shock which awaited the prisoner--you could see that in the pale face dropping in the hands,-in the shudder convulsing the slender frame.  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7555-00000092"/> AGNES STANHOPE. Mrs. Moreton threw back her -veil, anti took the customary oath with an unfaltering voice. She was pale, and her eyes shone with a stern light; but these were the only traces of emotion about her. Sum- moned from the quiet of her home by the stern com- mand of the law, she had obeyed unwillingly the call, but once here, the vindictive passions of her heart clamored for control, and she threw a glance, which expressed little sympathy on her wretched sister-in-law, as she took her place upon the stand. The shock of her brother's death was not yet past, with the host of fierce fieelings it had engendered. She believed Agnes innocent of the horrible charge urged upon her, but she believed her also to be the sole and all-sufflcient cause of the ruin which had urged Howard to take his own life. She gave her evidence calmly and clearly. The few inportant in- cidents of her short visit in her brother's home, the unhappy discord of his domestic affairs, her conver- sation with Agnes, in which the latter avowed she had lost all influence over him, and the closing in- terview with himself on the eve of her departure, in which he reflected harshy on his wife's state of feel- ing toward him. Some of this might have been re- pressed, the whole rendered in a kindlier tone, but Mrs. Moreton's embittered feelings triumphed. She sternly denied any intimation of suicide on the part of the deceased, and after a short cross-examination,   AGNES STANHOPE.         185 which failed to elicit any new facts, the defence suf- fered her to quit the stand. The short December day had by this time come to a close; the shadows of the gray twilight were al- ready filling the court-room.   Lights had  been brought in, and the court was adjourned to the mor- row. Agnes was remanded to her cell.    As she passed Colonel Maitland, in charge of the officer, on her way to the hall, he contrived to slip an open note in- to her Wand.   She unfolded it eagerly on entering the hack, and was enabled to decipher the few irreg- ularly penciled lines it contained, in the glare of the street lamps which flooded their way. "MY POOR AGNES :--Be not discouraged amidst the dangers which surround you. Hope everything from your own inno- cence, and the watchful care which is unslumberingly exerted for you. Your sister knows nothing of your peril. It is bet- ter she should remain in ignorance till it is past. A few days more, a few hours, even, I trust, will see you safely re-united." Agnes crushed the paper in her hand, She was beginning to feel the terrible pressure of despair. The host of dark, unpitying faces which had surged around her in the court-room, the stern countenance of the Judge, the harsh, denunciatory tones of the prosecution, the condemning testimony of the wit- nesses, all struck an icy chill upon her hopes. She alighted slowly at the iron gate of the prison, 9*  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7555-00000093"/> 186      AGNES STANHOPE. marshalled by the ready turnkey through the long, gloomy passage, to her little cell. It wore a differ- ent look to night, thanks to the forethought of Col- onel Maitland, carried out by the careful attorney, from what it had presented on her first introduction to it, but it was a narrow, grated cell still. She took up a book from the table, but her dizzy mind would not fix upon the page, and she turned wearily to the refreshments which stood temptingly arrayed on their snowy napkin. She had not broken her fast since the early morning, but the food she now tried to swallow seemed about to strangle her. As she threw herself upon her bed, and pressed her hands to her throbbing temples, the wild longing seized her to penetrate the future, to penetrate this black cloud of uncertainties, even if to behold the worst. She slept at last, as the midnight drew on, but it was a feverish, disturbed slumber, replete with fearful vis- ions. The gray morn broke, and it brought her back unrefreshed to a second day. She rose. The turn- key came with her breakfast, of which she forced herself to partake, and then she made her simple toilet, arraying herself in the plain white robe in which she had made her appearance the previous day. At the usual hour the officer made his appear- ance, and she entered the hack which was to convey her through the busy streets,   CHAPTER XIV. The court-room was even more crowded thaa on the preceding day, and her wandering glance, as she was led in, fell on two or three familiar faces. She shrank from their cold stare of curiosity, and a mo- ment's faintness seized her as she reached the pris- oner's dock. It was gone, however, in an instant, and she was able to listen with composure to the opening of the court. The closing testimony for the prosecution, consisting of the remaining servants, was called on, and though little that was new ap- peared in their evidence, it helped powerfully to sus- tain the statements which had gone before. Some rigorous cross examination on the part of the defence followed, without, however, eliciting any important facts. Here the evidence for the prosecution came to a close, and the attorney for the defence began the opening of his plea. It was a long and labored argument, seeking less to discover flaws in the statements already too pow- erfully sustained, than to draw from them conclu- sions favorable to the ground of self-murder. The deceased's character and habits were drawn with an  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7555-00000094"/> 188      AGNES STANHOPE. unsparing hand. His connection with the gaming- table, his fondness for the wine-cup, together with the last dark vice which followed hand in hand with these; his broken'fortunes and ruined hopes. The poor wife inside the bar trembled and shrunk from this frightful picture, and forgot almost for the instant in her anguish, that it was dragged up from its grave for her own salvation in the deadly hour of peril. Was this her husband? this reckless, de- spairing man, a bane and curse preying upon society; was this the man of whom in these early days of her widowhood lingered only sorrowful and pitying re- collections? O! let the past sleep! Harsh and stern as he was, unloving, and pitiless to her grief, How- ard was not the dark, incarnate monster this man painted him. O, nono!o! He went on to the theo- ry of suicide, and every- pulse in her shuddering frame thrilled to the falseness of his words. She felt that she had placed her cause in evil hands, that never could her innocence and truth be made mani- fest on such false grounds. A libel upon the dead! A false charge upon his name who could not rise from his narrow bed to come forth to defend it in the councils of the living. Here were those who had known him,-his brother barristers, his old friends, the later sharers of his dissipations, his nights of rev- el, and more than all, his kind uncle, who, over his hardly yet closed grave, had stretched forth a hand   AGNES STANHOPE.       18 to comfort his desolate widow. Must they all be- lieve this dark charge, all? And in her heart of hearts she knew this ,ast black crime never spread its dismal pall over his dying bed-should not shad- ow his resting-place. She longed to rise up in the dense court-room, to silence the attorney, to make her voice heard and proclaim his innocence. The lawyer turned in his subject. He pointed to the prisoner at the bar, the poor young widow, charged with the most horrible and appalling of crimes in the darkest hour of her bereavement. Yes, in the darkest hour, for she loved this man, strange as it seems to us, with all his reckless dissi- pations, his alienating vices, his harshness and cruel neglect to herself. He was her husband still. There were happy days in the past which she gar- nered up and remembered, and by whose light she hoped for the clouded future. He had not always been, gentlemen, what we see him in these last months and weeks, what the evidence of to-day presents him on the stand. He was of good breed- ng, of gentle birth, of honorable connexion, of a fair exterior; just the man to win the heart of a young confiding girl. He was not then .the gamb- ler, the drunkard, or the libertine, the germs of these fatal vices slumbered, unknown even to him- self, in his bosom. No man now within the sound of my voice whose prospects stood forth fairer than  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7555-00000095"/> 190      AGNES STANHOPE. his who to-day fills the unhallowed grave of the suicide. My learned brother spurns at the asser- tion that the frightful ruin in which he was involved should hurry him on to the frenzy of self-destruc- tion, but why?  What man among us all would remain sane if he calmly paused for a moment to contemplate in his own lot such a past and such a present? Recreant to all the fair promises budding in his path, entered far on that way from which we sometimes feel there is no returning, so hard and thorny is the advance in the face of men's doubts; credit, reputation gone, friends estranged, false to the faithful wife who still clung to his fortunes, spir- itless and heart-broken. I cannot for myself con- ceive stronger reasons to turn a man's brain, and shake his reason. He was not a man of strong principle, as I have before asserted, the gaming ta- ble and the wine cup once his daily companions, his will was powerless to shake them off; not the pas- sionate entreaties of his truest friend, not the ear- nest remonstrances of his far-seeing sister, not his own bitter knowledge of the taste of the fruit, could tear him from them. Did he know them  less than we? we who weeks removed from a more distant stand point pronounce upon his motives. Did he know less than we how utterly hopeless was the task of rending away from the vices which had snared him? Again, he was penniless. A fine for-   AGNES STANHOPE.        191 tune had been wasted in extravagance, a kind-heart- ed and generous relative hopelessly estranged by his ingratitude. From the cards and the throw of the dice, came his daily bread, he had not the pa- tience or the energy to force a way with steady waiting in his profession. In his heart no doubt he believed that he had no choice. The avenue of es- cape then was closed against him. He was bouud to his wretched life. I repeat then under such cir- cumstances where is the brain that would not turn? where is the heart that in the still night hour, from the restless pillow would not cry out, "My God thou hast forsaken me! Give me at least the quiet of the grave!" I turn again to the evidence which the prosecution has arrayed before the Court. With one exception it is entirely the testimony of servants, liable from their habits and circumstances to take a deeply one-sided view of the matter, a strong preju- dice, which reflects plainly in their evidence. How much fragments of conversations heard through closed doors may borrow from the active imagina- tion of the listener? What a rich opportunity, too, where petty resentments and dislikes are hoarded up for a ready revenge. Of the maid's testimony we shall say nothing, she may have been in error on some minor points, but she seems to have given it with a purpose of correctness and truth, and to have felt a real comiseration and respect for her un-  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7555-00000096"/> 192      AGNES STANHOPE. fortunate mistress. As to Miss Jane we have a word further to say, an evidence to bring on which will show that she failed to give satisfaction in her duties, and was already on her month's warning when this sad event took place. How much this fact may have to do with some part of her testimQ- ny we leave the Court to consider. As to the re- maining servants, after deducting the due amount for ignorance and pre-bias, we see nothing really mate- rial to the question in their evidence. They prove, what we allow and assert, the deceased's wretched habits, and the usual domestic misery appertaining to a gambler's home. They show the passionate remonstrances of the illused wife, passionate, but not revengeful, no stretch of imagination, surely, can bring her frenzied prayers to that. No fiery storms of passion, no taint of vindictiveness of char- acter, which must precede and go with such a crime, can be dragged up from her innocent past. Pure amidst the contamination into which her short mar- ried life drew her, shrinking from the vile associates of her husband's revels, we cannot but look with pity and tenderness on the poor young creature called in the solemn mysteries of God to tread such a thorny path, crowned with the anguish of to-day. My learned brother has been pleased to dwell on what he calls the evidences of guilt in the appear- ance of the prisoner at the question of the post-   AGNES STANHOPE.       199 mortem examination, and her after arrest. Let me briefly ask what allowance should be made for the wear of watching nights, the suddenness of the awful shock of death, the death of her husband (her husband I repeat again with all his vices) cut down in a day in the flower of his strength, and the not less real though less perceptible wear of previ- ous weeks and months while she stood a helpless looker on of his rapid course? What allowance should be made for these? How far did they go to quicken the trembling sensibilities, to relax the quivering nerves? Do we not find in them suffi- cient answer for the deadly swoon and helpless ter- ror? We need no witnesses to testify to the chief ground of our argument, the prosecution has sup- plied that evidence, we shall bring forward only those who shall speak of the character of the ac- cused, who have known her from her childhood, and who will bear word to her gentleness and good- ness. Here we shall briefly rest our cause,and look cheerfully to your Honor, and you, Gentlemen of the Jury, for an according verdict." The Counsel for the defence closed and sat down. The Court adjourned for a short recess. Agnes was led into the little room adjoining the lobby, where as on the previous day, a loaf of bread and a cup of coffee awaited her. It was past the hour of noon, and she was faint and exhausted, but it was  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7555-00000097"/> 194  -    AGNES STANHOPE. with difficulty she could force herself to partake of the needed refreshments. The recess was short, and she was soon hurried back to resume her place. After a little delay the Court resumed business. It was a familiar voice which called her attention suddenly to the witness stand. A voice which seemed to bear suddenly to her clouded senses all the bloom and brightness of Hawthorndean. She looked up to meet the familiar face of the old housekeeper. A keener pang of the disgrace of the hour than she had yet felt crept through her. Mrs. Robert looked pale and troubled. She shrank from encountering the eyes of her young mistress, and once or twice in the short testimony which followed it was plain that only a strong effort prevented her voice from breaking down in sobs. "I know the prisoner at the bar. I have known her from her childhood. I was her mother's house- keeper. I kept my place after her mother's death, up to Miss Bertha's, the elder sister's marriage, which took place sometime after the prisoner's. I' was Mrs. Stanhope's maid before my own marriage and widowhood-the prisoner's mother. They were people of good standing, Captain and Mrs. Stanhope. They moved in the first circles. The Captain lived for the last years of his life in retirement, on his half pay. He was unfortunate in some money af- fairs. Miss Agnes was of a very amiable disposi-   AGNES STANHOPE.       195 tion; never saw her in a passion more than once or twice that I remember, and then it did not last long. She was uncommonly gentle and affectionate. She was very much beloved by the domestics in the fam- ily. Cannot say I ever saw her in a violent passion. Her mother has been dead sixteen years, sixteen next March, when Miss Agnes was little more than a baby. Miss Bertha, her elder sister, took the care of her education. From my intimate knowledge of her I should judge her the last person to be hurried away into a criminal act. As a child, and through her girlhood, she was one of the most conscientious persons I ever knew, truthful, affectionate, and sym- pathising with all about her. I had no particular knowledge of Mr. Maitland.   Saw him several times at the house. Heard he had great expecta- tions from his uncle. Should judge him to have been an easy tempered, high spirited sort of a man; one who would be sensitively alive to disgrace." The counsel for the defence here made an end of his interrogatories, and the witness made a move- ment to quit the stand, which was however, pre- vented by a gesture from the'opposite attorney. "You state that the prisoner has a sister. What is the nature of the relations at present existing be- tween them?" A painfur flush superseded Mrs. Robart's pale- ness. Her eyes fell, she seemed quite unable to re- ply.  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7555-00000098"/> AGNES STANHOPE. "I will assist your memory," said the lawyer. "Is there any want of confidence, any coldness, or harshness of feeling between Mrs. Maitland and her sister?" "I hope not, sir. I believe not. "Recollect yourself, my good woman," said the lawyer, sternly. "How long since Mrs. Maitland and her sister have met?" "Not since the former's marriage." "And at what distance apart?" Mrs. Robart hesitated in real distress. "The Court requires an answer to the question." "Only a few miles." "And they have not communicated by letter?" "I think not, sir." "What did the difficulty grow out of?" Again Mrs. Robart hesitated. Her eyes turned, now, for the first time, with an agonized look on the trembling figure of the prisoner, who sat with her face bowed down. "Remember, madam, you are here on your oath, and expeeted to reply to all the questions put to you." "It grew out of Miss Agnes' marriage, sir." "What was there in it that was unsuitable? Mr. Maitland was a   gentleman of good connections, a fair match, was he not?" "I believe so, sir."   AGNES STANHOPE.       197 "What were the circumstances, then?" "He had slown some attentions to Miss Bertha." "Attentions, merely?" "I- I don't know, sir, - I believe there had been some talk of marriage." "Of course all this came to an end before the en- gagement with the younger sister came on?" The witness trembled violently. She laid her hand upon the bench to support herself. "You have not answered my question, madam," said the lawyer, blandly. "How soon after the breaking of the first engagement did this second contract take place?" "A servant, sir, cannot presume to guess all her mistress' affairs, and of so delicate a nature." "Remember, again, my good woman, that you are upon your oath. Was this first engagement for- mally broken of at all? Did not the marriage with the younger sister take place in its very teeth?" The witness gasped for breath. She saw all the dangers of the admission. She made a last struggle to regaip ground. "I cannot say, sir." "You will not. Very well; the court suffers you to quit the stand." The next witness brought forward was the house- maid who had served some three years with the sis- ters before Agnes' marriage. She testified to the amiable character of her  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7555-00000099"/> 198      AGNES STANHOPE. young mistress, to her gentleness and goodness, and to the strong affection which had existed toward her on the part of all the domestics. This witness' tes- timony was short, the prosecution suffering her. to quit the stand without further questions. The prisoner's maid, and the cook were here re- called, to bear their favorable testimony to their mistress' character, as well as to bring up some ad- ditional particulars, and here, on this meagre evi- dence the defence rested. It was now night, and again the court adjourned, to hear on the morrow the closing pleas of the pros- ecution and defence, and to deliberate, if the matter could be got through in the short day, on the ver- dict j   CHAPTER XV. Colonel Maitland, who had been in court a close listener during all the long day, turned sadly home- ward. He could tot quite repress a feeling of dis- appointment at the manner in which the defence had been carried on, though the why and wherefore might have been difficult to solve to himself. The ground of suicide was indeed the only safe plea which presented itself, for not a shadow of proof could be adduced to show that Maitland pos- sessed any enemies. As far, at least, as all research went, not one who could become a gainer, either by revenge or cupidity, at his death. The character, too, of his late associates was such that no reliable evidence could be drawn from them, and little, be- side, was known of the haunts he frequented, or the company in which he mingled. His friend, Law- rence, might have thrown some light on these mat- ters, but he had suddenly disappeared, having quit- ted London a few weeks previous to the opening of the trial. This step on his part had excited no sur- prise, as the fact that the last meal of the dead man had been partaken with him at the table of his mis- tress was wholly unknown, as well as the circum-  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7555-00000100"/> 200      AGNES STANHOPE. stance of their having been together and parted company that last evening. Maitland was a not unfrequent visitor at his friend's hotel, and on that fatal day entered his rooms unannounced and unob- served by the servants of the establishment, and thus, in the gray of the short autumn twilight they had passed out together. What then could the defence call rup beyond tes- timonials of character for the prisoner, with a search- ing review of the testimony already presented? There was nothing to be brought forward from the lips of the suicide, if such he were. Servants, sister, and even the suspected wife, were united upon that. Colonel Maitland's heart was very heavy. He shrank from contemplating the possibilities of the morrow. He shrank from the terrible doom which hung over the friendless young creature to whom he longed to offer a brother's tender protection. And Bertha? How could he tell her? The hour had come when she must know all, when this terrible secret must no longer be kept closed in his own bosom. He reached his home. The cheerful flood of light in the hall as he passed in, contrasted mournfully with the gloom and darkness without, the gloom and darkness which shrouded his own spirit. He - went up slowly to his wife's boudoir. The door, as it yielded to its touch, disclosed a cheerful picture.   AGNES STANHOPE.       201 The open hearth, the ruddy coal fire, shedding a soft glow through the' shadows, flickering over the heavy- crimson curtains, and the fair face which nestled softly against the pillows of the sofa, for lights had not yet been brought in. "You are. late, Philip," said the young wife, starting from her reverie, and raising herself from her reclining position as her husband approached, and silently took her hand. - "The dinner bell rang some moments ago. I have been waiting for your step."  "I have been detained," said Colonel Maitland, gravely, and he drew a chair to the sofa, gently pre- venting his wife's movement to ring for lights. "I have heard of our poor Agnes, Bertha." She looked up at him with eager attention, his face was half averted, but something in the reflec- tion of the dim light struck her. Her fingers tight- ened suddenly on the hand which3jretained hers. "No ill news?" she said, faintly. "It were cruel to keep you in suspense, my love," he turned round toward her. "Agnes is living; she is worthier to-day of your love than at any time since your sorrowful separation; but the- circum- stances which surround her, which hold her from us for a little time, a very little time, T trust, are far, very far, from what we could wish." "You terrify me, Philip!   What has Agnes done?"   lo  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7555-00000101"/> 202     AGNES STANHOPE. "Nothing, my love. Nothing irreparable." He paused in distress. How could he go on? Bertha's large eyes were riveted upon his face. "What has happened?" she repeated.  "Into what new misfortune is the poor child plunged? Speak to me, Philip. Anything. is better than this terrible suspense." "Compose yourself, my love. Try to be calm. All will yet end well. You remember the sudden- ness of Howard's death? the shock it gave us? The event was hardly less startling to others. It took place suddenly, and the symptoms of the short sickness were very unusual." He paused, and look- ed at her attentively. The blanched cheek and in- terlocked hands showed that the sense of the guard- ed words had reached her, and her quickened thoughts, quickened by the instincts of affection, caught up the connection with her sister. He hesi- tated a moment, and then went on. "Agnes is un- der arrest, charged with this horrible crime. "What if she should be condemned!"Her voice sunk to a whisper, a dizzy faintness crept over her. Colonel Maitland rose hurriedly to open the window, and came back to her side with the vinaigrette, which he had snatched up from the side-table in his hand. "There is everything to be hoped, Bertha. The chain of evidence against her is purely circum- stantial, and feebly linked at that. No testimony can   AGNES STANHOPE.       203 be produced to show the fatal drug in her possession, or the means by which it was given. Howard's wretched involvments and excesses are a sufficient presumption in the opinion of able counsel that it was his own act." "My poor sister " Her tears fell now, and Col- onel Maitland was glad to see them flow: he felt they would relieve her, and stood by till the par- oxysm had exhausted itself. Then he placed the cushions of the sofa for her head, urged her to lie down, and try to be calm, and drew up his chair again toward her. "My love, I own to you that this painful news has been for sometime in my possession, but I have felt it best to spare you the wear of such anxiety, to withhold it as long as I might do so with safety. She half raised herself, regarding him with a be- wildered and startled look, but he gently put her back in her place. "Surely, the trial is not over?" She put her hand with a bewildered air to her temples. "No, Bertha; it is progressing." "And I have been kept in ignorance. Philip, was it just? was it kind?" There was a thrill of lingering reproach in her voice which touched him painfully. "My love, it was both just and kind: Everything which human skill could provide for our unhappy  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7555-00000102"/> 204      AGNES STANHOPE. sister has been done, all but the comfort of your presence, which for my sake, for your own, till all is past, till all is happily ended, must be withheld. Our poor lost one knows every step I have undertaken for her safety, and that our home and hearts wait im- patiently to receive her." Bertha shuddered. The question she strove to ut- ter died upon her lips. She hid her face convulsive- ly in the cushions. This path for Agnes, her timid, clinging child-sis- ter, this path of thorns! How had it been trodden! More than weak mortal strength, surely, must have been granted her-the dark, low cell, the. crowded court, the horrible charge, the overhanging doom! And what had been the life from which this mourn- ful event had freed her? She had no need to ask. As by a prophetic vision, retracing the darkness of the past, she knew it all. "And was this the man I loved, or thought I loved?"His handsome face, his fine exterior, those winning manners, which had caught her girlish fancy, came back upon her. Who shall show us our end! A long silence followed. Colonel Maitland was too wrapped in his own reflections to disturb his wife's revery. He had spoken hopefully, confident- ly, of the morrow; it was necessary to break the terror of the 6hock, yet the words had found no echo tin his own heart. There was more he now wished   AGNES STANHOPE.        205 to say, but how could he measure her strength? He looked on the prostrate figure before him, the face bowed in the cushions, the interlocked hands. Some- thing in the silent picture of her distress thrilled him with a still keener pang; he bent over her, and gent- ly taking the clasped hands in his, drew her head to his shoulder. Try to be calm, my love. This will never do. Agnes' case is not yet hopeless, it is far from that." But even as he spoke his eyes turned involuntarily from the eager look uplifted to his face. "When will, the sentence be given?" "To-morrow; or the day following, at far- thest." "And you are assured of her release?" "We can be assured of no certainty in a court of law." "If the worst comes?" her voice faltered. "We will believe, we will trust otherwise." The servant's step sounded in the hall. She came to bring lights. Bertha rose. Colonel Maitland gave his arm to his wife. "We will go down to dinner, Bertha. Do not give way to despair. We must not attract the at- tention of the servants. Should the worst come to- morrow, something may yet be done." We go back to the  narrow cell, where Agnes waited for the slow [davn of light, which was to  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7555-00000103"/> 206       AGNES STANHOPE. usher in another day. It came at last, hurrying on, as time ever does whether we wait in tears or hope, and soon the sunlight poured a little flood upon the iron gratings, and the turnkey drew the massive bolts, and flung wide the heavy door to lead her forth. The court was already crowded, early as was the hour, and with difficulty the officer forced a passage for his prisoner through the dense mass of human beings to the dock. Soon the buzz of voices died away, the clerk called to order, and the business of the day began. The attorney for the prosecution commenced his closing plea. He briefly went over the evidence, re- viewing the testimony brought forward, and the un- tenable ground of the defence. The mass of evi- dence clearly showed the unhappy relations in which the prisoner lived with the deceased. They revealed, also, a threat of separation, which, taken with the strongly suspected existence of a powerful intrigue, afforded sufficient ground for the belief that such a purpose was clearly maturing in the mind of the hus- band. What, then, were the circumstances in which the prisoner was placed? What were the motives which would rise up to influence a passionate, cruel- ly wronged woman to the commission of such a hor- rible crime? This event of separation, this casting- off-and what proof have we that the plan was. not already completed, and the day at hand? would cast her friendless and homeless upon the world. We   AGNES STANHOPE.        o07 see that she had already estranged, by an act of the basest ingratitude, her only relative and friend-the sister, who, though but a little removed in point of years, had been the second mother of her girlhood. She was, then, utterly without resources, and with- out hope. There was nothing in the future, if such a purpose- had entered her heart, to stay her hand. This man, too, who so cruelly abused his promises, was the cause of all her humiliation and disgrace. It was his lips that had tempted her, his fugitive love, so easily quenched by reverses, which had lured her to betray her best friend. Do you think that in the summing up of his offences this was forgotten? Could she calmly submit to be cast off, give him up to his new passion, and to the checkered splendor and poverty of a gambler's life, wretched as it was, while hers henceforth was to be a continued strug- . gle for bread, to sink into an early grave, or darker still, a little way on, to fall into a lower depth, and know her name a by-word and a reproach upon ev- ery lip! The counsel for the defence has brought forward evidence to show the character of the pris- oner, her amiable virtues, her gentle and passive dis- position, but the reluctant admission wrung from good Mrs. Robart disperses it all. What shadow of principle exists in the soul of a woman who can be- tray in the hour of temptation her truest and nearest friend, who can repay the devotion of a life, which  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7555-00000104"/> 208      AGNES STANHOPE. from the cradle has held her well-being and happi- ness first, by an act of the foulest treachery? It was not the work of a moment, either, one of those sud- den impulses which in an unguarded hour may seize upon the best of us, to be repented afterwards in tears and sackcloth, but the work went on- for days and weeks, its crowning consummation to be blazon- ed forth at last to the whole world before it reached her whose slow incredulity could not dream of such baseness  We see now, after so damning a proof, that principle, at least, never could have withheld the prisoner at the bar from the commission of the crime with which she stands charged. Again ; we know not ourselves. It is the great circumstances of life which reveal to us what lies in our own hearts, and which bring forward qualities undreamed of in those who have grown up side by side with us in the circle- of our homes. The man who thirty years hence is to face the dread array of this court-room -dread to the guilty--to listen to the solemn sen- tence from the bench, and to offer a last expiation to his offended fellow man upon the gallows, is to-day an innocent babe in his mother's arms. I repeat, we know not ourselves. What was there in the calm life of this woman at the bar, petted, cherished, as she was in her girlhood's home, every whim and want foreseen, to unfold the dark spirit, which in its unruled passions has dragged her to crime? I re-   AGNES STANHOPE.        209 peat that the fact that the drug was not found in her possession, or traced to her hand, is of little moment. Murderers do not purpose to be discovered. How many such kindred crimes, think you, are wrapped in the veil of eternal secrecy? I only wonder here, that separated from friends and kindred as this man was, in the carefully guarded absence of his sister, that the physician should insist upon his right to an examination. How many victims, under such cir- cumstances, have been laid in their silent graves? the kind physician checked in his half struggling doubts by the bitter grief of the bereaved. The poison was found in the stomach of the de- ceased, the only and-all-sufficient cause of his death. The defence, beyond a vague intimation of its scanty knowledge of the dead man's associates and boon companions, and the impossibility of clearer re- search in this direction, throws the whole weight of the heavy crime upon himself. It does this in the face of the most deliberate presumptions of his inno- cence, It does not affect to bring forward one soli- tary sentence to prove that such a thought had an instant's hold in his mind. The whole scene of the death-bed, the whole circumstances of the short sickness, so far as they are permitted to reach us, press powerfully against it. Here we have even the unguarded admissions of the terrified wife, admis- sions of no little importance in such a connection, 10*  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7555-00000105"/> 210      AGNES STANHOPE. guilty as we believe her to be.  Her counsel, who is bound to do the best he can for his client, asserts that none but an innocent person would have made such an admission. We allow that one steeped in crime, familiar with its face, would not, but this was herfirst crime. The deed done, its consequences no less than the deed itself, bewildered her, shook all her calmness. She must guard off an examination, that was her first thought. She saw herself accus- ed, suspected. The counsel for the defence would place the deadly swoon, the frigid terror, to weak nerves and nights of watching. We beg leave to differ. Innocence is strong. It upholds where guilt sinks. The defence has labored to throw a doubt on the testimony of the chief witness 'for the government, by bringing forward the fact that she was on her month's warning. Did this affect her evidence toward her unfortunate mistress? We be- lieve not. We think it was given with a careful re- gard to truth and impartiality, and in this we are confirmed by the fact that not a charge could be hunted up against the correctness and veracity of her character. A dark and horrible crime has been committed which calls loudly for retribution. It has been com- mitted in the sanctity of home, under the very shel- ter of the most sacred ties. The increasing fre- quency of such crimes, many instances of which we   AGNES STANHOPE.       2" doubt not, pass unknown and unsuspected, sternly demand an example. Voices cry to us from many a grave. Shall we on our soul's peril dare to be deaf to the cry? Shall the youth and beauty of the prisoner so glamour our eyes that we suffer her to go forth unpunished--in the still flight of years, hurried on by the same evil passions, to snatch an- other victim? - Do you look with pity on the droop- ing face and bowed form on which the prison cell and the terrors of a guilty conscience have laid their heavy hand? Where w is her pity when she mixed the fatal draught? Where was her pity when she hung over her victim that night and day, listening unmoved to his torture-wrung cries, and watching the shadows of death stealing over the face which turned to her still for human sympathy and help? Where was her pity when she ushered him unsum- moned, in the heat of his mad career, into the pres- ence of his offended God? Where was her pity, when in the midst of his vices she cut him off from every promise of reformation, every chance of right- ing his evil days, and becoming - what for her who shall say that he might not have been - a blessing to -his kind? Yes, for until the day of this fatal marriage, fatal to both, these dark vices were un- knoiwn, silently slumbering in their rest, and who shall say - how shall you or I say -what part she took to urge him forth upon his broad path tq * i,,*  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7555-00000106"/> 212     AGNES STANHOPE. The attorney closed his argument, and sat d9wn in the midst of a profound stillness. You could have heard a pin drop in that crowded assembly. The prisoner still sat with her head bowed forward, and her eyes cast down. She was very pale, a like- ness of monumental marble could scarcely have been purer or whiter than her colorless face, but that was the only evidence of emotion, save in the drooping head, and still, folded hands. Colonel Maitland threw an anxious glance at the row of jurors, who sat impassive during the delivery of this long ad- dress. In their dull faces his quickened eye traced plainly the deepening of their silent convictions, and his heart sunk with a leaden weight in his bosom as he carried his glance round the court room, and back to the face of the venerable Judge. He looked upon the high white brow where the majesty of jus- tice sat enthroned, shadowed by its venerable silver gray hairs, on the thin lips, curved with an iron purpose, on the calm  gray eye, whose tempered light threw a colder chill upon her struggling hopes than any words might have done. He knew Judge Rathburn well. He had met him at his own board in the circle of his stately home, in public gather- ings, and now for the first time where the life of a trembling criminal hung upon his word.  Station, sex, beauty, these were circumstances which'were powerless to sway with a moment's throb this man's   AGNES STANHOPE.       213 heart. Rather in its secret recesses he was one to pride himself upon putting these aside, and showing himself also, in the rigid demands of justice dull to the anguish of his nearest friends. He knew well the close connection in which the apparently friend- less prisoner stood to his friend, but this very fact, if it weighed at all in his impartial scale, would be sure to make against her. A slight stir near him in the oppressive stillness, the rustle of silk, drew Colonel Maitland's attention suddenly from the bench, and his turning eye rested on a woman's figure who was striving to gain a step nearer to the bar in the press of the throng. Her thick veil closely muffled her face, but there was something in the outlines of her figure, in her air, no less than her dress, which bespoke elegance and station. A strong feeling of repulsion, yet of awe, why, he could not say, thrilled him at her contact, and when he looked back to the bench he was start- led to find that she had drawn for an instant -the eye of the Judge, and that an indefinable expression was softening the immovability of his face. It was gone in a second, however, and both turned as the voice of the counsel for the defence broke the stillness. The young barrister felt that the case was gone from his hand; you could have read that in the hasty glance which, in rising, he cast upon the court, but he was too well practiced in such failures not to take  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7555-00000107"/> 214      AGNES STANHOPE. up the fragments of his argument with his usual fluency and ease. The slip of the good old housekeeper had told heavily upon the testimony, and this was a mistake, which at this late hour, it was impossible to retrieve. Neither could he draw out of the past a shadow of proof that the crime of self-destruction, which he charged upon the dead man, had ever crossed his thoughts. But he went on bravely, with what re- mained, and the earnest tones. of his voice, the strength of his individual convictions of the prison- er's innocence, brought back a ray of doubt to more than one heart in the densely packed throng. He spoke of the unfortunate position in which the pris- oner stood at the bar, not only compelled to main- tain her innocence, but to prove it in the face of men's preformed judgments and opinions, and to bring forth to justice the real author of the crime. He showed the dark cloud of suspicion under which the innocent- save in the- rarest of cases ever came up to that bar, not to show themselves inno- cent who were already accounted guilty, but to clear themselves of the mass of guilt. How many had swung from Tyburn, had endured the horrible mar- tyrdom of shame, reproach, and a struggling death, as innocent for the crime for which they suffered, as the Judge who sentenced them from the bench, or the jury who condemned them? He brought out   AGNES STANHOPE.       215 and spread before them from the annals of the past, instance after instance of these fatal errors. "Shall they be repeated here to-day? Here in the case of this woman, young, beautiful, friendless, worn by imprisonment and suffering, lifting her sorrowful eyes to you for justice-meagre justice. Shall they be repeated here to-day? Is there no voice which speaks in your bosoms, which warns you to look upon that pure face, to read in those earnest eyes, from whose windows the soul looks forth, the purity and virtue of the heart. God in his pity keep you from the terrible mistake my brother coun- sel would force upon you! He is clamorous as a bloodhound for this human life. Is it that her con- demnation would be another stone to build up the temple of his fame? I believe so. I can have no better thought, hard as it is, of the principle which can stretch every argument, and strive with all its might to wrest the very points which tell for her simplicity and innocence. I admit the one spot which darkens a little space in her past, but there are no human lives out of which, if we learn their secret history, we cannot gather a flaw. A young girl, inexperienced, tender, imaginative, trusted to the seductions of a fascinating and false-hearted man -is there, after all, anything so wonderful in the result? Does one, bad act, committed in the hurry of youthful imprudence, make the whole life  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7555-00000108"/> 216      AGNES STANHOPE. bad? I appeal to the personal experience of all who hear me. Again, my learned brother places great stress upon the fact that not a solitary intima- tion of his purpose can be presented from the lips of the suicide. Do men speak of such things when the purpose is real? If my friend should say to me to- day, "I am tired of life. I mean to blow my brains out to-morrow!" should I believe it? No; so fear- ful a purpose, one so abhorrent to our human nature, takes its root in silence and secrecy. My learned brother would strengthen the testimony of the ser- vants, by asserting that nothing can be urged against their characters and veracity, but I repeat that per- sons of this class are peculiarly liable to mistakes and prejudices, and that petty resentments in all cases go far to color their testimony. The counsel for the prosecution lays great stress on the threat of separation, but what does it amount to? It is but the hasty expression of a passionate, impulsive man, who, in the fiery explosion of his temper, chafed at a little opposition, says a hundred fold more than he means. What was this powerful intrigue on which the counsel builds? Not a shadow of evidence has been brought forward to prove it anything more than a common episode in such a wretched and abandoned life. The counsel lays much stress, also, on the absence of the deceased's sister from the' death-bed, and the funeral. Do we forget the sud-   AGNES STANHOPE.       217 denness and bewilderment of the alarming seizure, how rapidly it lapsed into its close of death? or the entire absorptionof the devoted wife in her readily accepted duties? Are we so ignorant of the unhap- py intricacies which sometimes have place in family affairs, alienation, prejudice, as to find no other cause for her continued silence when that sister's presence could avail only to herself than the terror of a horrible crime? We have seen this sister upon the stand, we have all observed the manner in which her testimony has been rendered. Is it candidly any matter of surprise that this friendless young creature should shrink in such an hour from the compansionship of one who so plainly misjudged and repelled her? For the honor of human nature I could have wished, whatever Mrs. Moreton's private opinion, that her evidence had been rendered from a kindlier heart. I will detain the attention of the court but a mo- ment longer. The subject is not exhausted, but the chief points have been brought forward, and I will not weary your patience with detail. I leave the prisoner in your hands. Remember that in your decision rests a human life. Remember that your verdict is rendered before God. Forget- not the in- stances of erring human judgment which have stain- ed the annals of this very court. But I trust that my appeal is needless, that the cause of right and  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7555-00000109"/> 218      AGNES STANHOPE. truth will triumph. I ask nothing for the youth, the sex, and friendlessness of my client. I demand only justice. May God guide you in your jndg- ment!" He sat down. The Judge rose for his solemn charge. He went over the evidence briefly, leaning with a strong bias to the prosecution. The row of jurors listened with intense earnestness, as well as the crowded assembly of the court, to every word which fell from his lips. Then there was silence; and the twelve jurors rose. An officer forced a way with difficulty for their exit through the crowd, and they retired to deliberate upon their verdict. The dusk was falling and lights were brought in. Agnes sat with her head bowed forward, and her hands interlocked in her lap. There was a deadly faintness at her heart. She had followed every word of the Judge with an attention which absorb- ed everything in the one sense of hearing, and she shivered when the wind suddenly rustled the old panes in the window opposite, as if she caught the echo of returning steps. The stillness of the packed room was oppressive, there was something terrible in it, as there is ever something awing in the hush of such a mass of life. All held their breath, none dared to whisper to his neighbor.   AGNES STANHOPE.       219 An hour went by.. The hush had changed a lit- tle. Here and there one had forced his way out in- to the air, oppressed by the stifling odor. Low murmurs of impatience were interchanging, and del- icate women, called by a strange curiosity to so mournful a scene, still determined to sit out to the coming in of the jurors, leaned pale and exhausted in their seats. The woman who had drawn Colonel Maitland's attention in the middle of the day, still kept her place at his elbow, statute like and unmoved, and seemingly insensible to fatigue. He could not tell why in the long pause his eye reverted again and again to her figure, and he wondered if the face were of middle age or youth which the thick veil shrouded, and what had drawn one of such rank and elegance alone and unattended, to such a scene. It was a strange thought to cross him then, when every faculty and feeling should have been wrapped up in the pale prisoner at the bar. Another hour dragged on, and then the door was flung open, and the file of jurors entered, preceded by the officer, forcing a way as before. "The prisoner will rise to receive the verdict." But Agnes made no movement as they took their seats, and the clerk of the court addressed her: The officer bent forward to touch her arm, and then she rose, shaking him off with a shudder, and putting  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7555-00000110"/> 220      AGNES STANHOPE. her hands upon the bar before her to sustain her trembling figure. She threw now a wild, eager look at the faces she confronted, and a deadlier paleness spread over her face as she did so, mantling her very lips. "Gentlemen of the Jury, are you agreed upon your verdict?" "We are," they answered through their foreman. "Is the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty?" Guilty." A stillness as of death in all the vast assembly fol- lowed the words. Only one smothered cry, whose origin none could distinguish, but which to Colonel Maitland, had his senses been less clouded, would have plainly come from the veiled woman at his side. The prisoner's hands let go of their supporting hold of the bar, and she sunk back into her seat. The officer at her side sprung to hold a glass of water to her lips. She put it by, the short spasm passed, and repulsing the officer's support, she stood up again, firmly clutching at the bar. She was very pale, her eyes set and her lips white. It was a face which few who looked upon it ever forgot. "Prisoner at the bar, what have you to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon you?" The white lips moved without sound, but when the voice came forth it was strong and firm, filling, in its low, clear tones, the distant corner of the court.   AGNES STANHOPE.       221 "I am innocent, as innocent as you who judge and condemn me." Not one heart in that large room, but those al- ready deadened in secret soul guilt, which did not respond to that clear voice. The Jurors looked at each other; the Judge alone frowned immovable from the bench; but scarcely had the echo died away when the impression of a moment was gone. The Judge rose, slowly putting on his black cap. In a firm, full voice he began the sentence, but the last words, short as it was, were mercifully withheld from the prisoner, who slipped in a dull swoon to the floor. The multitude poured slowly out, while the offi- cers who had her in charge bent over her, sprinkling the wan face with water, and chafing the cold hands, while the chill wintry air, now laden with a mass of silvery flakes, rushed in from the open window, over the bench to which she had been raised. Better it seems to us now if she should never rise from that swoon, if this dead locking of the senses should set- tle into the sleep of death. So they thought, per- haps, who stood around her, seeking with all the means at hand to bring her back to memory and wretchedness, for they had sisters and mothers, and they remembered this, rough, stern men as they were. But the still hand moved, the blue eyes opened, and a faint, struggling, sigh broke from the  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7555-00000111"/> 222      AGNES STANHOPE. parted lips. She suffered herself to be assisted to rise, and holding to the arm of the jailor, in whose custody she now found herself, went slowly through the half-cleared court to the outer hall., She saw nothing on the way, not even Colonel Maitland, who pressed up to her side, anxious to exchange at least a glance or word, to say that hope was not all over with the sentence. But second thought, or the sight of that rigid face, bore him back, and she only paused for an instant when about to enter the hack. Then her dress brushed against a figure which stood on the stone pavement close at her side. Something drew her stony gaze from its steady look on vacancy, and a nervous shudder thrilled her from head to foot as she caught the flash of those dark eyes through the thick veil. They had met before. Her instincts of dread and aversion told her even at that hour who the woman was. The jailor lifted her into the hack, taking his place beside her; she shrunk back upon the seat, her head sinking helplessly against the side of the carriage, as it rolled noisily on through the thronged streets. By a strange impulse, as she lay back on the rough cushions, her hands clasped over her eyes, her breath coming short and quick, her thoughts retraced the past in that London life amidst the hurrying throng-a proud and happy bride, with one bitter dreg in her full cup, a gambler's wife, grieving and hoping, a desolate widow, following the   AGNES STANHOPE.         2232 bier of her husband, a suspected criminal, trembling and shrinking under a fearful charge-and last, in this dark winter night of snow and sleet, a murder- ess, on her way to her dismal cell, once more to come forth, to the jeers and shouts of the multitude, to death, a struggling, torturing death!  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7555-00000112"/> CHAPTER XVi. Far away from these busy scenes, the crowded court, the host of unpitying faces, Bertha waited, in the window of her pleasant boudoir, waited and watched through the falling dusk and the deepening twilight. The snow-flakes were settling fast and si- lently upon the pavement, carriage after carriage rolled by, the street lamps, one by one, began to glimmer through the darkness. Still the lonely watcher, veiled in the shadow of the heavy crimson curtain from the careless passer-by, strained her ea- ger gaze through the storm. How slowly the sands die out when we wait in the expectancy of hope and fear. How the moments linger, as if held in iron bands. Did no thought of the lonely vigils of Hawthorn- dean creep into this still hour ? Did no picture rise up through this bleak storm of a summer park, flood- ed with autumn moonlight, a porch wreathed with fragrant roses, a lonely watcher, waiting for the roll of a carriage, waiting-waiting-for the two who never came?   Yes, the thought did steal upon her in the stillness, and it blanched for a moment the lin-   AGNES STANHOPE.          225   gering color in her cheek and lip.  Was this night a tpye of the long, ago ? She shook off the fear; she rang for lights, and drew back again to the window, to strain her gaze down the long-array of stately buildings, as if her eye could pierce the darkness, and the mist of the rushing storm. A loud, clear ring at the bell. She started, and almost held her breath, for she knew the familiar touch, as well as the firm step which passed in the hall.  Alone. She sunk down into the fauteuil beside her, her hands clasping with a bitter pain.  The in- stinctive truth struck her. She knew that the sen- tence had passed-that all was over. She knew it, and saw it, in a chill, dumb despair. The long vigils of the sleepless night, the feverish watches of the day, the restless waiting of the twilight-how well had they prepared her for such a shock! "Bertha, my love."   Her husband's icy hand clasped hers, and his low voice fell huskily on her ear. "It has gone against her. My love-'my wife -try to be brave ! " "To think of that bright head on the gallows. My child-sister! my darling!  Philip, I shall go mad." " Hush, hush, my love. She must be saved yet." She looked up. His voice seemed to unlock the dull closing of her senses-life and consciousness flowed back.     1l   &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7555-00000113"/> AGNES STANHOPE. " Much can yet be done," he said, drawing a seat quietly beside her-and his firm lip and eye showed that his purpose was made up. "Agnes is innocent. She has been falsely condemned. She must be saved at any hazard, and by any means." He looked up to meet her riveted gaze for an instant, the flushing cheek, and kindling eye, stirred by the pulse of hope, and then went on. "'An application for pardon presents itself first, but this I fear would be a hopeless attempt.  The tide of opinion, as I saw in the court-room to-day, runs strong and hard against her. Judge Rath- burn, too, whose name should head such a petition, would in all probability, bring his influence against it. He has an iron principle of justice, and would rather condemn the innocent than suffer the guilty to escape. I speak plainly, my love, to prepare you for what is to follow." His voice fell to a whisper. " Private means must be employed to effect her escape. The jailors must be-bribed." Bertha shuddered.  "Have you weighed the dangers of such an attempt ?  Is the petition hope- less ? "I believe it to be.  I have thought .it over earnestly in the last half hour, weighed it in all its bearing. More than this, Bertha, how can a pardon be sought where there are no extenuating circum- stances to bring forward, where it is the one fact of   I   her innocence, denied after patient research by bench and jurors, which is urged ?" "bYou are right," said Bertha, mournfully. "It would indeed be hopeless." "There is no time to lose," he went on.  " For- tunately I have kept myself back in this trial, and the fact of my interference is rather presumed than known. To-morrow I shall commence my inquiries respecting the officers of the prison in as guarded a manner as possible. The jailor who has charge of her cell, if he can be reached, will I trust, obe the most accessible to my purpose.  He is poor, of course, and a sum to make him easy for life will be no small temptation. Once outside those walls, once embarked for a foreign land- beyond the reach of danger -and all this will be past." Tears rushed into Bertha's eyes. She pressed the hand she held.fervently to her lips. " You will succeed," she said with emotion.  "I feel the presentiment in my heart dark as the way looks. But 0, my husband, how can I find words to thank you! You, so noble, so generous, where any other would have stayed with kind words and pity. Ought I to take advantage of such devotion to involve you in peril ?" My love, it is only the strait path of duty- a sacred and a binding duty. Could I look on day after day, upon that sad,.pale prisoner at the bar,  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7555-00000114"/> 228      AGNES STANHOPE. your sister, and not feel my heart stirred to its depths, almost as wildly as your own? A dark' cloud of mystery has come before her innocence, but innocent in our hearts you and I well know her to be. I have faith in the providences of God to feel that the time will yet come when her name will stand -forth as fair and unstained to others, to those who have to-day condemned her, as it does to me to-night. Knowing this can I leave her to such a flate? Do I need even the urgency of your dear love, the sight of your anguish and distress, to im- pel me to snatch her from the grasp of the [blind law?" "If it were possible to see her, to write to her," said Bertha, sorrowfully. "I tremble to think of her despair in that dark cell. If she knew only of our love and pity, if she knew only that friends were striving and hoping for her." "Alas, that cannot be, my love. We must seek no interview or communication with her until our plans are matured, it may be not until the hour of her escape. One careless step might ruin all." She was silent, she felt the truth of his words. But one thrilling picture still rose before her, deepening as she cast'her eyes around the pleasarit room, its luxury, its cheery warmth and light, con- trasting with the pitiless storm which raged with- out, beating upon homeless heads. She saw, the a.   AGNES STANHOPE.        229 low stone cell,'the grated window, and the pale form extended in. its wild despair upon the cold floor. The clear blue eyes, the long dishevelled golden tresses, through which her fingers had threaded in such tender pride - it seemed years ago, the pale, wan face, haggard with grief and dread. She tore her eyes from it in vain. It rose yet more vividly before her shrinking sight as she stood in the blaze of the brilliantly lighted dining-room, and took her place at the head of the glittering board. The ob- sequious servants, the wealth and state around her, even the blooming flowers which shone before her through the glass doors of the conservatory, seemed to mock the anguish of her heart. "My sister, my poor Agnes, how many weary days and nights ere I shall reach the blessed hour when I shall say, "All this is indeed past!" We go on to a neighboring street, to a mansion but a short square removed from that which we have left, the residence of Judge Rathburn. We pass in through the long hall, and pause at a door to the left, which admits us to the library, where the Judge sits iq his large velvet-covered arm-chair, before his desk, strewn with sundry lawyer-looking parchments and letters. There is a summer warmth flowing out from the open grate over the large, cheerfully lighted room, whose walls are crowded with ponderous volumes of legal lore, in their black  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7555-00000115"/> 230      AGNES STANHOPE. cases, interspersed here and there with some lighter works, which seem to have strayed in by careless chance rather than the taste of their possessor. The Judge leans wearily on his desk, the pen has dropped from his hand, and the unfinished lines which stretch away on the white sheet are dark and confused before him. Are his thoughts back in the deserted court-room  amidst the swaying crowd? 'Does he look again on the white, ghastly face at the bar, and does a throb of human pity quicken in his bosom at last for the woman his voice has condemn- ed? Does a doubt of her guilt in this quiet and stillness force its way by a mysterious voice into his -heart? No; the events of to-day have had too many a precedent in the past. Woman as fair and young have trembled and fainted before his eyes beneath the culprit's sentence. A score of times from that very bench he has pronounced the solemn words upon the young and the gray-headed, the last awful expiation of crime. No; his thoughts are not in the stifling court, but far away among the green vales of Devonshire, in scenes he has not looked upon for thirty long years. How strange the picture should come back to-night. The rustic little cottage where he was a boy, his venerable gray-haired mother, long ago laid to her sweet sleep by her husband's side in the green old   AGNES STANHOPE. 2,1 church-yard, his little sister, now in her prim old age, the stately mistress of this princely home, the only sharer by his wealth and honors. How strange it all seems. Was he ever that little lowly bare-footed boy? Is it possible he ever worked his way up from  that humble lot to rank and riches? O, it seems like a dream to the stern gray-headed man. But there is a stranger picture still. He in his first youth a lover, just entered upon his toilsome profession, introduced to it by straitnesses and sacri- fices on the part of his fond mother which he sighs even now to remember- yes, a lover, and of one far above him, the star of many eyes, young, high born, beautiful, wanting nothing but a rich dower ,to compete with the noblest.  What a blessed dream it was, but how soon to fade. A bright tress of long golden hair, in a locked drawer of the wall- nut secretary yonder, side by side with a bunch of withered violets, are all that are left of that long, long ago. All, save a host of bitter recollections, and unutterable regrets. The dust of years lies upon the treasures of that little drawer, for years have passed since his fingers touched the golden ringlet, ,or  his eye  rested  on the withered flowers. But they are hoarded there for all that, the one bright spot in the checkered past, when all was fresh and true, such a day as will never come again till the battle of life is past, and its pain and  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7555-00000116"/> 232      AGNES STANHOPE. sorrow are revealed in the light of eternity. He knows that those sister tresses are moldering away in the coffin, blanched, mayhap, ere they came to rest there by time and grief, far in a distant church- yard, where the proud name of De Lacy stands out on the white monument. He moves with an uneasy gesture, and takes up the pen again which lies by his listless hand. What has brought back these old memories to-night? Was it that silent figure in the court-room to-day, that woman who stood at' Colonel Maitland's side unwearied through all the press of the crowd, whose air and presence, he knew not why, brought up that long forgotten face, and those distant scenes? What a trifle to move him thus. He smiled, a cold smile which hardly parted his thin lips, and began to move his pen again steadily with his returning thought. A  low knock at the door, and a servant paused in the entrance. "A lady wishes to see your Honor." "What, this stormy night!" He  threw a dis- mayed glance at the sleet and snow driving against the window. "Show her in." The man retired; and an instant after, the door again unclosed, giving entrance to a slight graceful figure, whose face was closely enveloped in a thick veil, His heart gave a quick throb as he rose to receive   AGNES STANHOPE.       233 her, for he recognized in a moment the stranger of the court-room, but he only bowed, and waved his hand to a seat. "You have business with me, madam?" "I have ; of a most pressing nature." She sunk down into the chair at her side, more from inability to stand in her emotion, than from a consciousness of his courtesy. "6 I was present at the trial at which you presided to-day. I know the prisoner. I know her to be innocent. I have come to entreat your help in her behalf." The Judge had resumed his seat, his elbow leaning quietly on his desk. He bent a searching and surprised look on his visitor. "You have some new evidence to offer. Why was it withheld to-day from the Court?" "I have none, your Honor," her voice was very low, "none, at least, that circumstances will suffer me to reveal. But I know that a fearful wrong has been done to-day, and a sentence given which will be repented in sorrow and remorse when the time for reparation is past." 6"You speak with assurance, madam. Is your individual judgment clearer than that of the twelve honest jurors, or the practised Judge?" "I claim nothing - only this, I would stake my life, my all, here and hereafter, on Mrs. Maitland's innocence." i* 1      C         e  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7555-00000117"/> 234      AGNES STANHOPE. Judge Rathburn looked at her, curiously, earnest- ly. Her thick veil shrouded her face, but he could see the tremulous emotion which shook her from head to foot. "So young, so friendless," she went on --" such a hard, sorrowful life. Even the -stern law must have some pity. You must allow yourself, Judge Rathburn, that there is, at'least, a faint presumption of her innocence." "A   very faint presumption," he answered, coldly. "Will that weigh nothing?" she went on, ea- gerly. ", Think what a horrible doom - and for an innocent woman, the victim of a terrible myste- ry -it has never been traced to her' hand, the posion, or the act, it is wholly circumstantial - not a shadow of certainty- what more natural than that the wretched man found his death in one of the low haunts he frequented--O, sir, will you not open this again? Will you not give it a little thought?" "Madam "- his voice was softened to an un- usual gentleness, "I have thought over all this, I gave it its due reflection to-day on the bench - but were my convictions otherwise, as they are not, and cannot be without the light of other evidence, I have no power to do what you ask; the sentence is past, it cannot be recalled."   AGNES STANHOPE.       235 "A pardon would recall it; a petition headed by your name would revoke part of this fatal mistake, and leave time for the sure righting of the rest." "You forget, madam, you have shown me no new facts to turn my convictions. Believing as I do, I cannot lend my influence to prevent the course of justice. If you are the friend of this young woman, as you seem to be, you have my sympathy, my com- miseration ; I can offer nothing more." She was silent.  He could hear her short breathing, and see the rigid locking of the small gloved hands under her vail. ( So young; so innocent. O my God, guide me! help me!" Judge Rathburn was moved, strangely moved. The sight of such distress was not new to him, he had seen it before in the court-room, in this very library, whose walls, had they a tongue, could have told of more than one such scene, enforced with tears and heart-breaking sobs. But a cord long silent thrilledlto this new voice and presence, they came out of the past, and they seemed to bring with them the air of the Devonshire hills, and the breath of violets. He rose, and stood almost as deeply moved as his visitor beside his desk; you could have seen it in the unusual paleness which -over-spread his face, and in the blue veins which stood out upon his temples.  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7555-00000118"/> 230      AGNES STANHOPE. She saw nothing of his emotion, the agitated woman who stood before him, for she had risen as if for a last appeal, and for an instant seemed faintlyI stayed from going down on her knees at his feet. "I know she is innocent;" she said, at last, "and I, unhappy I, am the cause of all this misery, innocently, but none the less. What I know I can- not reveal without betraying what I must keep. If I had stood up on the stand to-day jurors and bench had sworn her innocent.   Will you believe me, Judge Rathburn? Will you grant my prayer now?" His lips moved. He spoke calmly. It was strange how in the midst of his strongly repressed emotion the old wariness kept its place. "You are a stran- ger to me, madam. Under this veil I cannot even distinguish your face. Show me your standing and character, confide to me your name, before you de- mand my confidence in so strange an assertion." "My name!"  He drew back a step, startled at the wild laugh which burst from her lips. It was checked in an instant, stilled in a sorrowful moan. "I cannot give it, sir. You ask too much. Not for my own sake, I have nothing left; but there are those who loved me once, and to whom I owe some- thing still." "Then I can do nothing for you. Our interview is at an end."   AGNES STANHOPE.       237 He drew his chair to the desk, seated himself, and taking up his pen, slowly smoothed out the unfin- ished page. He felt the steady gaze of the dark eyes which were watching him through the still closely drawn veil, and he knew that his strange visitor was tremblingly swaying between a purpose of resolve and fear. "I cannot," she said, at length, in a broken voice. "Judge Rathburn, listen to me once again. You have a wife, children, daughters, perhaps,--think what it would be to have one of them condemned, the victim of circumstances-for this woman is as fair, as gently born, and once as dear to others, as they. Think what it would be to give your darling to the hangman! to see her struggling on the scaf- fold in the jeers and shoutings of the crowd, in the tortures of a horrible death!" "I have no wife or child," Judge Rathburn's pen paused in his hand. "Had I such, a daughter, and she were left to so black a crime, I should do all that just means could do to save her, but once con- demned, I should thank God in my shame and sor- row that she was taken from the evil yet to come." "And this is my last answer?" her voice fell. He looked up, still resolute and unmoved. "Show me the guilty, madam, give me even a shadow of proof that the man took the poison himself, and I will exert all my influence cheerfully to save her. A a thP no. a .4an.

"The day will come, Judge - Rathburn, it is not far off, when you will sorrow too late that you have cast my prayer from you. Innocent as you, or the jurors who condemned her, so she said, and so she stands before God, and the day will come when not I alone shall know it, but you all." She went out into the hall, the door opened and closed heavily after her, she had passed into the stormy night. The Judge listened in vain, with a strange interest, for the roll of a carriage on the silent street. Could it be she had come alone and on foot through the driving storm! No, no, the car- riage waited round the corner. No woman could walk in such a night! How the storm pours. I won- der who and what she was. She seemed half-crazed. Some poor, lost creature to whom this woman showed some kindness. Nothing more likely. Yet I am loth to think it, for once. An accomplice, perhaps. O no, that would never have led her here. I know not well what to think. I would she had spoken more plainly after all. Nothing need be clearer than the evidence--and yet, and yet, there was as she said a faint presumption. Well, I have given my voice to my best convictions, God help me! "  We pass over the slow details of Colonel Mait- land's researches, which consumed the whole of the!l two weeks following the sentence. The delicate and   AGNES STANHOPE.        239 guarded nature of these inquiries necessarily con- sumed much ground. But all at last was happily arrived at, and we find him on a clear December morning, in the opening of the Christmas holiweek, waiting in the parlor of a little hotel at the east end of London the appearance of the jailor to whom he had written the day previous to request an interview. It was still an early hour, but Colonel Maitland could with difficulty restrain his impatience at his visitor's delay. He could but feel how much hung upon this meeting, and how hopeless were the chances of his poor sister-in-law should this only project of her deliverance fail. Still he had gathered careful knowledge of the character and circumstances of the man whose assistance he sought, and the result of his inquiries had satisfied him that there was little to fear for his success. In his short note he had asked an interview merely to make some inquiries respect- ing a prisoner under his charge, in whom he was interested, with the promise of a liberal remuneration in return for his compliance. So the morning drew on in this anxious waiting, and it wanted but a short interval to noon, when a heavy step paused at the door, and it opened to give entrance to a tall, swarthy-looking man. "Mr. Crawford, I presume?" and Colonel Mait- land threw a hasty glance at the intruder, whose description he had taken the perhaps unnecessary  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7555-00000120"/> 240      AGNES STANHOPE. The turnkey threw himself into a chair, regarding his companion with a dull look of curiosity and interest. Colonel Maitland was silent for a moment. His heart beat at this crisis of his undertaking; he trem- bled at the next word which might dash all his hopes. "I got your note yesterday, sir. I was kept back this morning, and have little time to spare." "Very well. We will proceed to business at once. I have a strong interest in a prisoner, who is under your charge, a young woman who has been very unfortunate. She has no more right to be in a prison cell than you or I, but circumstances have gone against her."  He stopped. "So they all say," said the man, with a grin. "I think I can guess who you mean, sir. Her sentence will soon be round too. But if you think I can help you to get her out you are greatly mistaken. It would be as much as my place is worth, and more too." "Hear me first," said Colonel Maitland, motioning him to be reseated, as he rose and stood up, as if to go. "I learn that you have been unfortunate, Craw- ford, that you have a sick wife and a large family, and have struggled with poverty all your life. What would you say to coming into a handsome compe- tence, say six or eight thousand pounds, a sum to make you comfortable for the rest of your days?"   AGNES STANHOPE.       241 ' It would be a temptation," said the man, stag- gered by the magnitude of the offer. "But I daresent risk it. It would be too much danger, sir." "Not with proper care. What would be easier than to loosen the bars of her window, and give them the appearance of having been tampered with out- side? Or what would be easier than to pass her by the jailors in the disguise of one of her visitors, tak- ing care for the egress of her visitor afterwards? Come, Crawford, you are not the man to throw aside such a fine fortune, which will not offer itself again in your lifetime, for a little risk. And to save an in- nocent woman, who has suffered more than enough if she had been guilty, already." !"I don't know, sir," said the man, sulkily. "It's a great risk." Colonel Maitland raised the paper, which, during this short conversation, had been carelessly flung over a part of the table at which he sat, exposing several piles of gold, arranged to the best advantage for display. "Here is half the sum, four thousand told, the rest into your hand at the moment of her release." The turnkey took a restless turn through the room, eyeing the money with eagerness, but evident doubt. "If there were less risk," he said, at last. " But as your Honor says, such a chance won't come  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7555-00000121"/> 242      AGNES STANHOPE. again. Anyhow I'll try. Of course your Honor will lend me some help in the matter?" "Anything you can reasonably ask." Ie came back slowly to his seat, and throwing himself back into an easy position, began, lowering his voice to a whisper, "Well, then, to begin, your Honor, the first plan wouldn't be safe. The bars couldn't well be filed off without attracting the no- tice of the sentry, and that would ruin the whole. The second offers less objections, though there is some danger to that. I might pass Mrs. Maitland out in the dress of a visitor-your Honor furnishing the visitor, and I finding a way out for her after- wards, as if she were -one of my daughters, who comes sometimes to see me in the prison, but the poor thing is so trembling and faint-hearted since her sentence, I'm afraid she wouldn't be pluck, and if she was a little faint, or held back, it would be ruin." "Trust her for that at such a moment," said Col- onel Maitland. "The hope of escape will nerve her." "Well, then, our bargain is made.  When shall it be?" The man rose, and began the agreeable task of thrusting the handfuls of gold into his pockets, without the formality of telling it over. "  To-night," said Colonel Maitland. " My ar- rangements can be completed in a few hours.   AGNES STANHOPE.        243 "So soon! It will be starlit, too. Why not turn it off till to-morrow, or the day after?" "Because, I feel there -is no time to lose."  He did not think it necessary to add that a vessel sailed that night, with fair wind, for the Mediteranean, bound to Rome, and that he seized upon this fortunate chance to secure a passage, knowing that no safety now lay for the escaped felon in her native land. "Well, as your Honor pleases. I will have my part in readiness." And after a few closing prelim- inaries the two separated.

How had these long two weeks dragged by to Ag- nes in her solitary cell, unbrightened by a human face, save that of the rough jailor, and uncheered by a single whisper of the busy world outside, the world which had condemned and stood darkly arrayed against her? Where was Bertha?    Where was Colonel Maitland, who had watched with so much apparent interest the progress of her trial, whose note of encouragement and hope, alas, how falla- cious! still lay upon her little dressing-table before her. Had they, too, yielded to the general voice? Had they, too, accepted at last the terrible mistake of her guilt? Did they think of the shame she was bringing upon them? Did they count the infamy of being thus hopelessly associated with a felon? She thought of Bertha's nobleness and goodness. She recalled the look Colonel Maitland had cast upon her when they met in the midst of her trial, on her way from the court-room. She threw her eyes around the cell which his forethought had supplied with ev- ery permitted comfort, and remembered how every delicacy which could tempt a failing appetite had si-   AGNES STANHOPE.       245 lently replaced the rough prison fare. Yet if this tenderness remained why this inexplicable silence? Not a line-not a word. IShe knew not how long a period yet intervened to her sentence; the merciful swoon which had closed her ears to the concluding words of the- Judge kept this from her, but she knew instinctively that the time appointed had been short. She shrank from asking the grim turnkey, as if her inquiries would have some mysterious power to bring nearer the dreaded day. At first the dream of a pardon had found its way into her thoughts, how she hardly knew, only hope which is so slow to leave us, even in our darkest hours, held up her youth and innocence, and whispered that even the stern Judge and the jury who condemned her must feel some pity for her terrible doom. Colonel Maitland, too, was rich and powerful-he had hosts of friends-what might not his influence effect, when he entered heart and soul upon such a purpose? Even if his own heart did not prompt him, Bertha would entreat him with prayers and tears. She would not let her die. But this hope grew fainter as the long days wore on, and now, at last, she had surrendered it in despair. Her health was failing, her strength rapidly giving way, and she prayed now but for a short respite in her sentence, feeling that with only a little delay a more merciful hand would interpose to the hangman. So the close of this short December day, a type of  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7555-00000123"/> 246      AGNES STANHOPE. many that had preceded it, found her extended on her couch in her little cell, her hands clasped weari- ly over her eyes,-as if to shut out the cheerful flick- ering of the lamp, which the jailor had brought in and placed on the round table with the tray bearing her evening meal. She suffered him to come and go in silence. She felt too weary and exhausted to rise, and shrank with a sick feeling of aversion from the sight of the snowy rolls, the golden cake, and amber hued chocolate. The dusk deepened into even, hours went by, and she lay still motionless, when the key again grated in the lock, and the turnkey reappeared. She looked up with a little startled surprise, for -this late visit was unusual, and her agitation was not lessened when he announced visitors, and drew back to give entrance to two closely muffled figures, the foremost of whom neither the closely drawn veil, or the hum- ble garb, could conceal from her quickened eyes. "Bertha!" "Agnes!" The door had hardly closed upon the retreating jailor ere she was at her sister's feet, to be raised and folded in a convulsive embrace. "Bertha, can you forgive me? Can, you ever forgive me! If you knew all I have suffered-" "Agnes, do not talk of forgiveness. It is all over. I forgave you long ago."   247 AGNES STANBOPEo I knew you would forgive me in sight of this hour-my worst enemy might.  Bertha, you don't know how my ingratitude to you has laid upon my heart-how I have thought it over and over again in this wretched cell-how I wept over it when he neglected and scorned me-how I used to grieve over it even in my short happy days." She had slid from her sister's embrace, and sunk down at her feet, hiding her face in her hands, as if she could not endure to look upon that tender and forgiving presence, which brought up so vividly all the pure and innocent past. "Rise, Agnes; I have forgiven you, freely, fully. I was wrong--you were a child-so young--I should have known him abetter. I trusted him too much. Don't sob so, my poor child." She bent over her and gently compelled her to rise. "See, we are not alone, Agnes. Have you no word for Mrs. Robart?" She raised her face slowly, a faint glow of shame now tinging its waxen paleness. The good housekeeper had sunk down into a low seat, and sat with her hands over her face, rocking softly too and fro in a quiet burst of grief. "You are very kind to come here, Mrs. Robart. You knew me when I was a little girl. Who would have believed I could have become such a shame and sorrow to you all! It seems like a dream."  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7555-00000124"/> 248     AGNES STANHOPE. "Don't talk so, Miss Agnes: pray don't. You've borne up bravely, and redeemed the past, if you did go a step wrong." "Bertha, when I am gone you will beg my body, and lay me away in the old churchyard by the side of my father and mother-dear Hawthorndean which I never shall see again. Tell Colonel Maitland I thank him for all he tried to do for me, and for his great kindness and pity." "Agnes, my poor love," said her sister, embracing her, " how shall I break it to you? Try to be calm --I have come to save you." "To save me, Bertha! O, no, you can't do that, with all your love." "Hear me, Agnes-try to listen, to understand me. I have come to save you. You will go out with me. Philip has bribed the turnkey, and waits us outside with a carriage. You will put on Mrs. Ro- bart's dress. Do you hear me, my love?" She took her sister's hand, and looked anxiously into her startled face. "O, Bertha! But if we should be discovered. What would become of you!" "Never think of that; there is no danger if you will only be firm, my love. Think-it is only a few moments-a little nerve-and liberty and life lie outside." The sudden words seemed to stagger her, until   AGNES STANHOPE.        249 that moment neither had felt the extent of her phy- sical weakness, as she sunk down trembling and agi- tated upon a seat. "This will never do." Bertha turned to the table near by, and taking up a flask of ruby colored wine, filled a glass which stood at its side, and pressed it to her lips. "Try to swallow this, Agnes. Strive to compose yourself. Everything depends upon you. We have no time to lose. The turnkey will be back in a mo- ment, and he must find us ready." "But dear Mrs. Robart?" "Don't think of me, child. I am provided for." "The jailor will let her: out, Agnes, disguised in one of his daughter's clothes, who has come this evening to the prison to see her father. All is ar- ranged; the vessel is getting under way at the wharf in which you have a passage for Italy, and the wind to-night is fair-God favors us, you see. Come, my love. There is not an instant to lose." The thought of escape, the free air, the lifting of her icy doom, sent the strong blood with a sudden impetus through her veins. She drained the glass, which Bertha still held, eagerly, and submitted her- self passively to her directions. A few moments saw her arrayed in Mrs. Robart's coarse serge dress, close straw bonnet, and veil, and scarcely was the meta- morphoses completed when the turnkey's tread re- verberated in the passage. Her heart gave a quick 12  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7555-00000125"/> 250      AGNES STANHOPE. bound as the key again grated in the lock-was it for the last time? and she leaned heavily on Bertha's arm, which she had tremblingly taken. The jailor threw an approving glance at his pris- oner, and directing her, in an undertone, to draw her veil more closely, led the way out in silence. They passed on without interruption, Agnes still holding by her sister's arm, her handkerchief pressed to her face, under her veil, with her remaining hand, until they came to the outer door. Here the turn- key, who stood on guard, hesitated, and bestowed a curious look of doubt or curiosity upon the two, be- fore he rose to slip the heavy bolts to let them forth. It was a moment of intense anxiety and dread. Ber- I tha felt through her sleeve the icy chill of the hand which tightened upon her arm, and a quick tremor crept over her lest a sudden faintness, or some sign of agitation should reveal the worst to the eyes bent upon them. "The poor lady is quite overcome," said Crawford, addressing his brother jailor. "She has been to see her sister," he added, in a whisper, which did not reach his- companions, "the woman who's to be hung.  I could hardly get her out of the cell. I thought she would faint on my hands." "No wonder," said the man, slowly raising him- self up, and pushing back the massive bolts. "Hang- ing is a dreadful thing; and murder, too."   AGNES STANHOPE.       251 They were out now in the fresh, bracing air, under the clear winter skies, lighted with innumerable twinkling stars. They moved at a quiet pace up the street, but round the next corner Bertha hurried her charge rapidly down the sidewalk, towards the hack, which stood clearly outlined at some yards distant. Not a word was spoken. The coachman alighted to throw open the door, while the muffled figure on the box still kept his place. Agnes found herself handed in, and then at the low word of command the hack started off at an even pace. Agnes lay back mon the cushions, silently clasping her sister's hand, which she covered with kisses, wholly unable to speak the emotions of thankfulness, gratitude and joy which welled up from her overflowing heart. It was not until several streets had been turned, and the carriage had been started into a more rapid course, that Bertha broke the pause. "I have ar- ranged everything for your comfort, -Agnes, every- thing which the limited time and the confusion of my anxieties would permit. You will find your trunks in your state-room, furnished with all the clothing and means which you will require at pres- ent; also a letter, directed to Colonel Maitland's agent at Rome, whom he can trust, and on whom you will draw freely for the supply of your wants. Dearly as I should desire to hear from you, my' love, upon your arrival, I submit to my kind husband  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7555-00000126"/> 252      AGNES STANHOPE. that it will be neither wise nor best, since it may lead to dangerous discoveries. The news of your health through the agent, with now and then a file of English newspapers transmitted to you through the mail, is the only communication we dare to hope for at present."- Agnes' tears fell silently. "O! Bertha, if I had resisted that temptation, if I had possessed a tithe of your truth and nobleness, all this had not been." "You blame yourself too hardly, my poor child. Remember the words of our kind Mrs. Robart, that you have nobly redeemed your fault by bearing up bravely under such sorrows. It is the deepest lan- guage of my own heart to you to-night." "But I can never forgive myself. The recollec- tion of the anguish I caused you pierces me to the soul." "Forget it, Agnes. It is all past. I am happier, nfinitely happier, in the lot God has given me. The only shadow on my home is the blight which has fallen over you. I have faith to trust it will yet be removed, how or when I know not, and that when we shall meet again it will be without pain or fear." "God grant it!"  But Agnes' tears had ceased to flow, and her eyes were fixed on vacancy. The first rapture of escape, even in these few moments was past, and she saw the lonely exile which awaited her.   AGNES STANHOPE.       253 The hack stopped. They had reached the pier. The coachman sprang down to open the door and hand out his passengers; Colonel Maitland also alighted from his place on the box. The coachman received his fare, the hack drove off, and the three turned toward the long, dark-looking object which lay upon the water. Already her sails were loosen- ing in readiness to catch the breeze, and cheerful sounds and voices rose up from her decks. Colonel Maitland hurried his companions on board, and with a brief greeting to the captain on passing, to whom he also presented his passenger as Mrs. Jenness, the name she was henceforth to assume, they passed down to the state-room. There was little time to spare. The vessel was rapidly getting under way; the boatswain's shrill cry piped all hands on board. Colonel Maitland stooped to press a silent kiss upon his sister-in-law's pale forehead as she stood before him, and disengaging his wife gently from her last clinging embrace drew his arm around her waist, half-supporting and half-carrying her up the stairs, They reached the wharf, and lingered for a few mo- ments to watch the black hulk, with its its snowy sheets of canvas, slowly putting out into the waste of waters. "A fair voyage," said Colonel Maitland at last, "and God's blessing go with her! We can delay no longer, Bertha. Crawford will be impatient. It is past the hour I promised to meet him."  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7555-00000127"/> 254       AGNES STANHOPE. She yielded toe his hand and turned sorrowfully away. On the first street they entered, a hack rolled past, and Colonel Maitland hailing the driver and finding it empty, placed his wife in it with orders to drive to Grosnover Square, their home, and pro- ceeded rapidly on foot to the carriage stand where he had appointed to meet the turnkey. He found him at his post, accompanied by Mrs. Robart, as had been agreed upon, the good lady closely muffled in a large hood and heavy though somewhat thread- worn shawl, which with a gaudy orange striped dress, had replaced her own neat attire. The man chafed at the few moments of unavoidable delay which had taken place, but his murmurs ceased as Col. Maitland thrust an additional bank note into his hand. "Everything has gone well, your honor. In a few hours I, too, shall be out of the pursuit at Calais. Your honor 's generous, but it is nothing more than fair, seeing I 'm quitting my native land, and giving up a fair place." O'I   CH APTER XVIII. Rome upon her seven hills. Rome with her fallen pillars, and her great names blazoning a long vista of the past. Was this the land that had filled so many reveries of her imaginative girlhood? Was this the land she had prayed to see? the birth-place and home of so many names familiar to her as house- hold words, to whose eloquence her quick pulses had thrilled, and to whose deeds her warm heart had glowed in that long: long ago. Were these the radi- ant sunsets, the golden skies of her dreams? Was this the land of song and art,pf balmy breezes and never-withering flowers? Better, far, far better, to have died ere she had seen it thus. A fugitive flee- ing from the sword of justice, a homeless outcast, a disgrace and a sorrow evermore to the only heart that loved her! Very dark was the future which pressed around Agnes as she leaned back in the carriage which bore her up to the hotel. Wearied and exhausted, hardly less in body tha in mind, by the multiform discom- forts of her short sea voyage, the new panorama of the foreign streets could not draw forth a glance from her abstraction, and when she alighted at the fmhr asrcin  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7555-00000128"/> 256      AGNES STANHOPE. busy inn, the strange buz of voices, the musical Italian patois, for a moment confused and bewildered her. She ordered a room at once, to which she was immediately shown by the obsequious landlady, and declining the proffer of a ate dinner, gladly threw herself upon the snowy-robed couch to seek repose. Sleep, for the first time in many, many weary days, closedher eyes in a refreshing slumber, and when she awoke she found her temples cool and her thoughts clearer and freer than they had been at any time in the bewildering hurry of her escape. Her, trunks had now arrived, and on her appearance were removed to her chamber. The day had drawn to a close; the bell rang for the evening repast, and mak- ing a hasty toilet, she descended tremblingly to the general dining-room. Here she found a few persons assembled at the table-an English gentleman, with his wife, and a young lady, apparently their daughter, two French counts, and an elderly lady who spoke with a strong Swiss accent, which with her escort, a young man who might have been her nephew, made up the party. The latter, she gathered in the course of the conversation which took place during the meal, and to which she attentively listened, had been to visit a relative in Paris, and were now on their way back to their native country, one of the Swiss cantons, while the first, the English gentleman and his family, were spending some time abroad, and had only arrived the preceding day at Rome. The   AGNES STANHOPE.       257 meal over, shunning conversation; Agnes withdrew at once to her chamber. She sat long at her window in the deepening night, for she had refused lights, watching in a dreamy abstraction the stars come out thickly in the blue sky above. Beneath was a little strip of neglected garden belong to the inn, and as she threw up the sash and leaned out to feel the fresh night air upon her heated forehead, the scent of a few pale roses, heavy with dew, stole up. She wondered what lay before her in this new life to which she had come. She thought of the wonderful hand which had brought her through such peril and dan- ger. She wondered for what she was reserved, and what was to be. A vain, sick longing thrilled her to lift the veil of the future, to see the day of returning to her native land, the day when the story of her in- nocence should be upon every lip. Alas, alas, was it ever to be? For the hundredth time she thought over the strange mystery which lay around Mait- land's death; groped in the ever-thickening dark- ness. Wearied out at last with fruitless thought, she retired to her couch to seek the forgetfulness of the land of dreams. She went down in the morning to greet a part of the company of the previous night at the breakfast table. Mr. Trevannion, the English gentleman, had arranged for a permanent sojourn at the inn, and accordingly engaged a suite of rooms, including a private dining-room. 12'  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7555-00000129"/> 258      AGNES STANHOPE. The comparative quiet of the little hotel, together with her entire ignorance of the localities of the place, suggested to Agnes, also, the necessity of ac- cepting it as a permanent home, at least for the present. The dread of pursuit or of accidental dis- covery, which constantly haunted her, led her to consider everything which could tend to promote secrecy and seclusion. She added therefore to her chamber the little ante-room adjoining, for the pur- pose of securing the dining-room beyond, that her meals might be served to her without the exposure of descending to the public room of the inn, where casual strangers, as well as the habitues of the estab- lishment, were indiscriminately waited upon. This important matter settled, she turned her attention to the unpacking of her trunks, crowded with the liberal wardrobe which Bertha's provident care had provided. It cost her many tears and many sorrow- ful reflections, as she unfolded piece after piece, and came here and there, when least expectant, upon something which reminded her of the tender past, something she had worn or valued in the good old days of Hawthorndean. But mingling with them all came a ray of light. She could but feel the un- changed love which clung to her in her disgrace, and these silent little tokens of care were hardly less con- vincing than the personal danger which had been so nobly incurred and braved in her behalf. It deep-   AGNES STANHOPE.       259 ened the solemn duty which she had distinguished and felt in the lonely reveries of the past night, to build up hopefully as she might the wrecked and ruined life which spread before her, and to struggle steadily against this weight of discouragement and despair; to wait patiently, too, God's own time, which, though we can seldom see it in the heat of our eagerness and desire, is ever the best of times. But all was at last completed; one thing after another, over which she lingered with tender eyes, disposed in its place; the day was gone, and she soon withdrew from her lonely dining-room to watch again from the window of her chamber the stars steal out into the blue ether, and to send many a tearful thought back on the dear scenes that had become part of the shifting past. How should she fill up 1 to-morrow? and to-morrow? It was a new ques- tion, and she thought it over with a dreary pain. How many historic, hallowed scenes lay around her -the vast Collosium, a world of ruins and wonders, places which her heart would once have throbbed with an aching pain of joy at the very dream of looking upon; but her feet were bound. A stranger without protection or friends, and compelled by her cruel fate to remain so. Was it so dire a necessity, this utter isolation? She thought of her companions at the hotel, whose rooms she had discovered that day were separated from her only by a narrow gal-  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7555-00000130"/> 260      AGNES STANHOPE. lery. Mr. Trevannion was the representative of a- country squire, such as she had known so well in Suffolk--rough, kindly, given to a free hospitality, not particularly disinclined to the bottle, and, at home, extravagantly addicted to fox hunting. This much she had read in the short hour passed beside  him at the table on her first arrival. The sickness of his wife, a pale, delicate woman, whose racking, painful cough no sea voyage or salubrious air could remove, was the evident cause which had drawn him into such strange associations. Towards the pale invalid she felt strongly drawn by the common sym- pathy of sorrow, though from causes so widely apart, and her mental glance reverted from her to the young, ingenious Adele, a fair, blue-eyed, girl of some eighteen summers, whose rosy cheek and beam- ing smile showed her wholly unconscious of the shadow so soon to fall upon her young life. Must she, living under the same roof, repulse their ad- vances toward an acquaintance? for she had seen the glances of interest which the elder lady had cast upon her, heightened no doubt by her pale face and widow's weeds. Any approach to intimacy was im- possible, since the close silence she must preserve respecting herself would excite curiosity, but a for- mal acquaintance seemed at'least admissible. This little relaxation of society, with early morning walks under the concealment of a thick veil, to such dis-   AGNES STANHOPE,. * tances as she could venture without the fear of losing herself, would break much of this terrible monotony. Another thought presented itself, which though it did not shape at present into action, we may as well pre- sent in its place. The recollection of her indebtedness to Colonel Maitland pressed somewhat heavily upon her, the heavy sum which she well knew he must have so generously advanced to procure her escape was of little moment, and accepted in the spirit in which it was bestowed, but her delicacy shrank from the idea of constantly remaining a burden upon his generosity. Occupation, too, would cheerfully fill up these sorrowful hours; but she was a stranger, and where should she seek it? This train of reflec- tions brought up the old question of music and em- broidery, but she felt that the imperfect knowledge she possessed of the new language around her would prove an obstacle, as well as her lack of recommend- ations. She must wait the slow assistance of time. But an event occurred even as early as in the course of the morrow which wrought an important change in a part of her plans, by bringing her into intimate contact with her new acquaintances, one of those circumstances which, wielded by an unseen hand, not unfrequently present themselves to change our clearest purposes. This was a sudden and alarm- ing seizure of Mrs. Trevannion's, a distressing hem- morage- of the lungs, which created the greatest  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7555-00000131"/> 262     AGNES STANHOPE. alarm and dismay in her little household. .Aroused by the confusion, and acquainted by her landlady with the cause, Agnes at once presented herself to proffer her assistance, which was thankfully accepted by the agitated husband; and while the daughter was borne away to her own chamber in a swoon, she assisted the maid to raise the sufferer to her bed, and waited by her side the long delayed arrival of the physician. He came at last, to administer that fatal remedy which relieves while it saps the life it is given to save, and with a few words of encourage- ment, hopeless to the sorrowing group who listened, took his departure. Agnes remained with the -af- flicted family part of the night, more from the relief her presence afforded in their loneliness than any aid which could be rendered to the poor invalid, who lay white and exhausted upon her pillows. The morning witnessed a faint rallying from her stupor, and as the days wore on, Uher disease, whose decep- tive forms we have all watched and known so well, seemed to abate, and the flushed cheek and lustrous eyes bore to the fondly deceived husband and child the promise of an eventual recovery. Agnes was now often in the sick chamber, warmly welcomed for her gentleness and kindness at the couch of the in- valid, and she soon forgot her first resolutions so far as to accept an invitation to two or three pleasant drives with Adele, and to visit in the company ot   AGNES STANHOPE.  her new friends a few of the most interesting places in th  e neighborhood of the city. She was soon strongly attracted by the patience and gentleness of Mrs. Trevannion. Adele's frank, warm nature, im- pressed her with interest, and even Mr. Trevannion, rough but kindly meaning, won cordially upon her regard. Once the sick woman questioned her of the past, some careless inquiries unmeaningly put, but she saw in the painful shadow which came upon her young friend's brow that the subject was for some reason an unwelcome one, and she at once dismissed it. Mr. Trevannion, too, in their early acquaintance, inquired if her family were a branch of the Jennesses of Suffolk, but upon her briefly replying in the neg- ative the question dropped. Weeks went by, nearly two months had elapsed, and she had fallen quietly into this tranquil life, with a deep sense of its rest and peacefulness, when a circumstance occurred which destroyed all her fan- cied security. She was sitting early one evening in Mrs. Trevan- lon's dressing-room, keeping company with the invalid, who lay languidly wrapped in shawls on the lounge, when the sound of a familiar voice suddenly caught her ear from the open parlor beyond., She could not distinguish the words, but the voice was distinct. She held her breath. "Has Mr. Trevannion returnedT?" murmured her  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7555-00000132"/> -AGNES STANHOPE. companion softly. "I forgot to tell you, Mrs. Jen- ness, we have been expecting for a few days past the arrival here of a gentleman we met at Nice. Mr. Trevannion had a letter from him a week ago. An admirer of Adele's, I suspect." She smiled, and half-raised herself on the cushions, gathering her shawls listlessly around her. "I want you to see hinm, Irs. Jenness. Iam quite curious to have your opinion of him. Mr. Trevannion thinks Adele quite too young to consider such matters, and I, had I a stronger hold on life," a pensive shadow stealing over her face as she sunk back into her former posi- tion, " should be glad to keep the dear child with us a year or two longer; but as it is I should wish to see her earthly prospects settled before I go." "Dear Mrs. Trevannion, I pray you may yet be spared to your husband and child many, many years." "It cannot be, my dear. It was hard at first to think of parting, to feel that they needed me, too; but God knows best. All I  think of now is Adele's future; mypoor, little, motherless girlto see her happy with some honorable man. Have I told you, I wonder, that Adele has a handsome portion when she marries, or failing that, on her coming of age. It is a bequest from her aunt, over and above what her father will be able to give her. Poor Adele. You see it makes her future much more dangerous man if she were dowerless. So, many would seek her hand for her wealth."   AGNES STANHOPE.       265 "And are you safe that this gentleman is quite disinterested?"Agnes forced herself to say. "I think he is, my dear. I believe him to be. It is true I have not had as full an opportunity of ac- quaintance with him as I could desire; he was much with us while we were at Nice, but I was confined to my room part of the time. Mr. Trevannion knew something of his family, however. -He is of good birth, polished, agreeable, a thorough gentleman." The low strains of a guitar, accompanied with Adele's sweet voice, rose up from the room beyond. Both the listeners sat silent. The mother put her hand over her eyes and leaned back softly on her pillow. Agnes looked at her. Her breath came faintly and her heart beat quick. The well-known voice which reached her ear had broken the trance of security. She knew her danger; but her eyes rested lingeringly on the pale mother, and she thought with a thrill of anguish over the fate, which none could read more clearly than herself, unfolding its meshes to inclose the object of her last earthly cares. The song ceased, there was a murmur of voices as -of leave-taking, the sound of retreating steps, and soon a lighter tread glided across the gallery and came toward the room in which they sat. Adele entered, flushed and radiant. Only a glance told the trembling looker-on what the fond mother already  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7555-00000133"/> arlsvi Me WLAN HOPE. knew, that the fair girl had entered the golden pal- ace from whose portals the dull earth is bathed in glory. "Mr. Lawrence has come, mamma. He will see' papa "-she stopped; a confused recollection of Agnes' presence deepened the warm blood in her cheeks: she checked herself in her eager approach to the couch on which her mother lay, and took a seat by the window in confusion and blushes. Mr. Trevannion's immediate entrance prevented what further might have been said; he came in, his hands filled with papers and letters, which he had' taken hurriedly from his pockets on his way up stairs. "A fil  mail," he said cheerfully. "It has been long enough on its way."  And throwing a daintily su- perscribed note into his daughter's lap, he commenced the perusal of the file of English papers, not how- ever to the neglect of his letters, whose lawyer-like chirography showed them to be matters of business, for by their broken seals they had evidently received an examination on the way. The invalid roused herself with languid interest to listen to the news, and Mr. Trevannion went Jlowly over the chapter of parliamentary doings, Uid then of deaths and marriages, in the London Journal. "Ah, here is a  shocking murder case," Le said, smoothing the paper slowly as he turned to nother side of the large sheet. "Maitland vs.   AG}NESJ S'1'AN HUrN Ad Maitland; a poisoning case. Why, they belonged to the first circles. You know Colonel Maitland, Maria? Colonel Maitland, of Harrowdale. Hisplace is only a circuit of twenty miles from ours, Mrs. Jenness. Well, this man was his nephew. A clear case. It is very shocking!" "Which was the poisoner?" said Mrs. Trevan- nion, her eyes expanding with an expression of hor- ror, s" the husband?" "No, Maria; the wife. Ah, yes, here is part of the trial." And both were soon absorbed in it, as he went on to the entire forgetfulness of their guest, whose white face and riveted eyes must otherwise have caught their attention. Adele looked up from the little satin note to whose close she had reached, and pre-occupied as she was with her own pleasant reflections, gave an involun- tary start. "You are ill, Mrs. Jenness I Papa, please open the window. Mrs. Jenness is faint." He started to obey, but Agnes motioned him to keep his seat. "It is only a little indisposition," she said. "The room is so warm I will go out in the air." She rose up and went out, not however to seek the little garden of weeds and tangled roses, but to throw herself on her bed in the stillness of her own room and press her hands over her eyes. What should she do? Flight was the first thing which  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7555-00000134"/> presented itself, but whither? Not another day of safety for her in Rome. Recognition might take place at any moment. Even if she could confine herself to her own apartment and escape a meeting, her kind friends would not be silent, and sooner or later he must discover the truth. In he, dreary prison days, going over the past, she had discovered what the reader is aware had at the time escaped her,- his fugitive passion for herself, his friend's wife; and this recollection increased her dread and terror at being placed by the iron pressure of circumstances so miserably in his power. Adele, too; must she suffer this marriage to go on, knowing what she did? Ah, would they believe her? a friendless, unknown stranger, introduced to them by the merest accident ofcircumstance. Lawrence would tell them all that this woman with whom they had associated so freely, to whose daily companionship they had trusted lheir innocent daughter, was a poisoner and a felon, l fugitive from justice, with a price set upon her lead.           CHAPTER XIX. The night wore away in these troubled thoughts, out the first glimmering of the gray dawn found her lecided upon her course. She rose as soon as the ight of day flooded the darkness of her chamber, mnd hurriedly began the preparations for her sudden ourney. Her wardrobe must be replaced and re- Irranged in its trunks, and this was a work which consumed the early morning till the breakfast hour ,ame round. This over, she hurried out to procure ler passport and discover the hour at which the conveyance she was to take, set out. She had de- tided upon Vienna, the neighboring Austrian capital, as the place to which her flight was to be directed, safely concluding that in that bustling German city, so unlike the more frequented Swiss cantons and the beautiful Italian countries, she could more readily find concealment. In that direction suspicion would be slow to point and she hoped that all traces of her route might be obliterated before discovery actually took place. The tedious delay, however, which oc- curred in procuring her passport, proved the source of no little inconvenience, for she found on leaving  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7555-00000135"/> 270      AGNES STANHOPE. the office near the hour of noon that the dilligence had set out!'an hour before, and she must conse- quently remain another night in Rome.' She threaded her way back through the busy streets with a heavy heart. The disarrangement of her plans was indeed temporary, but she was in a state of feverish anxiety which lengthened the slow hours into days; She shrank from another interview with Mrs. Trevannion in her present disquieted state, but she remembered that this unusual absence would excite surprise, and not unlikely a visit from Adele to her ; rooms, where the appearance of preparation would at once excite curiosity and inquiry. She steeled her- self then-to the unwelcome necessity, and throwing off her bonnet and shawl on reaching her chamber, pro- ceeded at once to Mrs. Trevannion's dressing room. Her low knock receiving no reply, she opened the door softly, as was her custom, and entered. But the sight which met her riveted her feet for an in- stant to the threshold. Lawrence in quiet conver- sation with Mrs. Trevannion. Adele sat at some little distance, her fingers trifling with her usual morning work of embroidery; but it was not on her young, happy face that Agnes' look glanced. She saw only one face, she was sensible only of one presence. The trance lasted only for a moment. The con- versation had stopped at her entrance. Lawrence   271 AGNES STANHOPEo.  was the first to recover himself. A little start of surprise was his only outward show of emotion, and when Mrs. Trevannion, with a little bewildered air, for she could not but perceive her friend's extreme agitation, pronounced her name, he rose and came toward her with his usual self-possession. "Allow me to congratulate myself on this unex-, pected pleasure. You have brought me to an old friend, Mrs. Trevannion. I knew Mrs. Jenness in England, in the lifetime of her husband, who was one of my nearest friends." He threw a glance of commiseration at Agnes mourning dress as he handed her to a seat. A little pause followed. Agnes was too much agitated for voice, neither would words come. Lawrence turned to address his hostess, evidently to give her time to recover herself, and to considerately withdraw the attention of their companions from the sight of her distress, which his presence by revivinm the memo- ries of past times might naturally awaken. She did try to recover herself, to accept before them the view which he placed upon the matter, but she found herself utterly unable to do so, and soon rising, with a stammered apology, retreated from the room. Did he think he could throw her off her guard, and blind her in a fancied security? or would the continuance of this silence accord best with the suc- cess of his present plans? She wavered between  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7555-00000136"/> 272       AGNES STANHOPLE. these two explanations as she sat in her chamber, her hands tightly clasped in her lap, her heart pul- sating with a quick, tremulous terror. Could she hazard another night under this roof? Ah, the offi- cers of justice might be at-her door even in another hour. Were she to attempt an immediate escape hence her egress might be at once denied. The landlord, the servants, if her tale was told- who would not stay the flight of a criminal branded with so horrible a crime. This most unfortunate meeting did indeed place her completely at his mercy. If she attempted to procure a fresh passport to some nearer point, she would be at once tracked and fol- lowed. She had nothing to do but to. wait. A quick knock sounded at the door. She started, and tremblingly rose to answer it. It proved to be only a boy bearing a note. No reply was needed. She took it eagerly, and went back to the window. It was some seconds before she could gather courage to break the seal. " DEAR LADY:-I write to re-assure you, what but for your uncontrollable agitation this morning I should have thought an unnecessary presumption, that you have nothing to dread from me. I can only express the pleasure I feel at again meeting you, and my regret that- this pleasure does not seem to be mutual. Fear nothing from my revelations to our new friends; let rather the intimacy of this charming family be a new tie between us. L"5o   AGNES STANHOPE.       273 Lawrence judged wisely with, his thorough know- ledge of the world, when he traced this plausible note in an adjacent cafe, but he quite lost sight of the higher principles which were likely to enter into the conduct of a woman like Agnes; and, be- side, he had never been quite sure of the amount of knowledge she actually possessed of his geperal career. Where was the woman who would not, under such circumstances secure her safety at so small a price, silence, where her revelations would be of no possible advantage to herself. Adele was young and pretty, how could she know that her money was the only attraction she held for him, that it might not turn out a tolerable match after all? His plans in regard to herself had been singularly frustrated, and in the confusion of those events he had almost forgotten them, but at some time not far off they might yet be found capable of resusitation. Time enough, however, for these reflections in the future. His hands were full at present. If,he could keep out of the sight of old friends till his bride was won. How fortunate that the Suffolk squire and his lady were so enchanted with his fine exterior, and so well contented with their knowledge of his family that they had thought it unnecessary to push researches into his character. He had experienced an emotion very nearly equivalent to dismay at the sight of Agnes that morning, just as his purposes were so 3  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7555-00000137"/> 274       AGNES STANHOPE. finely maturing. It had seemed like Helen's pres- ence rising up again before him to blight the present as she had done all the past. It was an absurd fear. Helen was safe. She would cross his path no more, though he shuddered even yet to think of the terri- ble manner in which their fate had been rent apart, the duigged glass which he strongly suspected had been prepared for himself and swallowed by his unlucky friend.  Meanwhile Agnes pondered with a tremulous sense of relief over the note which lay in her lap. It did not waver for an instant either her sense of duty or her purpose of escape, but it assured her of present safety, and that her departure would not be interrupted. She gathered up her writing materials at length, and began her letter to Mrs. Trevannion, the letter which she proposed to leave privately on her dressing-table, should chance offer, at the last mo- ment, or failing that to commit it to one of the ser- vants of the inn, with orders to take it at once to Mrs. Trevannion's rooms. The pen trembled in her fingers as she began, and she was compelled to lay the blotted sheet aside, but with the next trial the lines grew clear and steady. "MRS. TREVANNION--My Dear and Kind Friend:-I cannot leave you in the hurry and secrecy to which my unhappy fate condemns me, without making known the painful discovery I have made. The gentleman you are about to accept as the hus-   AGNES STANHOPE.          725 band of your daughter is wholly unworthy of your confidence and kindness. I will not dwell upon what I intuitively believe, that he did much more than any other to hurry my unforunate husband in his headlong course to ruin, but will confine myself to stating one passage in his past, his connection with an ami- able and beautiful woman, of birth and standing fully equal to his own, whose irretrievable ruin he effected. Dear Mrs. Tre- vannion, you may not choose to accept this charge on the word of a stranger, a woman, too, who though innocent in heart and deed, stands before the world condemned of a fearful crime, as he will not spare me to tell you. Let his suit then wait till you have taken opportunities to inquire fully in London society of his character. Adele's future! I could never know a moment's peace if I had suffered her to fall unwarned into this snare, and if my words, my late caution, prevail to save her, I shall feel that even my weary and sorrowful life is not without its blessing to others. Dear Mrs. Trevannion, I thank you for all your goodness. I shall carry away with me tender recollections through you and yours of the place to which I came, heart-sick and discouraged, as a homeless exile. If we meet not again on earth, may we meet again ere long in that better country, where you will see that many as have been my faults, I was not un- worthy of the friendship you gave me." She signed no signature to the letter, but folded and directed it, carefully concealing it in her dress for the present. The afternoon wore on, and just in the dusk of the falling twilight, she yielded to her desire for a last interview with her friends, from whom she was so soon to part, without the sorrowful comfort of a fare- well. She found Mrs. Trevannion in her usual place,  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7555-00000138"/> 276      AGNES STANHOPE. on the lounge in her dressing-room, pale and ex- hausted by the unusual exertion of the day; but she took her hand kindly in hers, as she paused be- side the sofa, and Agnes saw, from the sympathy which welled up in her clear eyes that her thoughts had gone back to her friend's emotion of the morn- ing. She said nothing, however, beyond that silent pressure, and Agnes, drawing a chair toward the couch, leaned her arm -against it. "You are un- usually wearied this evening?" "Yes; I have had much to excite me to-day. But it is all happily settled, and the last care has gone from my heart. I am really happy." She threw a fond glance at Adele, the only other occupant of the room, who sat at a distant window, watching the gorgeous piles of the gold and crimson sunset, and too rapt in her happy thoughts to look up at Agnes' light footstep or the low murmur of voices. Agnes's eye followed- that of the mother, and an involuntary shudder crept over her. "Yes, she went on, softly; 66it is all happily ar- ranged. The betrothal has taken place, and the wedding will follow in a few weeks. It only remains for us to fix the day. Her father would have de- layed till the autumn came round, six long- months, and then to have- the wedding celebrated in Suffolk, if I were able to return; but Mr. Lawrence pressed his suit so earnestly, and Adele was silent. I could   AGNES STANHOPE.       2" not tell them another- autumn would not find me here. It would have broken her heart, poor child." The sunset poured its mellow flood through the broad windows into the room. Agnes still sat silent. Mrs. Trevannion looked up towards her, struck by her unusual manner. "Are you ill, my dear?" - I have been writing a letter, and my head is weary." *' Ah, indeed. Letters are pleasant things when we have words to say and messages to send to those we love. But there are other kinds of letters, busi- ness, duty; from the last defend me, when one has nothing to say, or something painful stands out to be said." Mine belonged to the last mentioned class," said Agnes gravely. Mr. Trevannion came in, and the conversation turned on general subjects. You left us 'so abruptly last night, Mrs. Jenness, you did not hear the conclusion of the Maitland trial. Would you like the papers? ' I will send them to your rooms." "Thank you, sir; I left England after the trial took place. I did not have an opportunity to men- tion it last evening, 1 was so suddenly taken ill." "Ah? I had entirely forgotten the papers were so long on their way. The trial must have created a strong sensation. What was the opinion of the  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7555-00000139"/> 278      AGNES STANHOPE. London people? Mrs. Trevannion here will persist that the woman might have been innocent, after all; but to me nothing seems clearer than the evidence." "I incline to Mrs. Trevannion's opinion," said Agnes, in a voice of singular clearness. ' Yet I believe there are very few who hold the same con- viction." "Her escape was well managed," Mr. Trevannion went on. "It seems the turnkey was bribed, and after releasing his prisoner, made his own escape. It must have taken a mint of money. I should sus- pect Colonel Maitland of a share in it if it were not his nephew who was poisoned. He has an enormous rental; the richest man in the county." "Singular, too," said Mrs. Trevannion, "when she seemed to be without friends at her trial. He might have helped to save the disgrace of having her hung. He knew her, too, and might have more reason for doubting her guilt than others." Agnes was relieved when the subject changed. She took leave of Mrs. Trevannion with more than usual tenderness, pressing a kiss upon her forehead, and lingering for a last look on the face which she would see next in the unfolding mysteries of another world. Mrs. Trevannion silently returned her ca- ress, but without a suspicion of its depth and fer- vency. The emotion of the day, the betrothal of Adele, were a sufficient cause of sympathy; she   AGNES STANHOPE.        279 believed they revived, too, that sorrowful but once happy past, over which her friend still mournfully brooded. Adele, also, felt the unusual fervor of their friend's clasp, as her hand folded hers, and a blush and smile rose to answer the broken words which she mistook for the murmur of congratulation. The- early morning found Agnes ready for her journey, her letter entrusted to the servant, and her- self in the carriage which was to take her to the diligence.  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7555-00000140"/> CHAPTER XX. We pass over the monotonous details of Agnes' quiet journey, which crossed the chain of the Appe- nines, and led through the beautiful countries of the Tyrol. At any other period of her life she would have contemplated with eager interest the rich land- scapes unfolding before her; but now her heart was heavy with the absorbing anxieties of her flight. The Alps, with their untrodden snow fields, soared up high in the distance as she neared them; here were the simple mountainers, with their picturesque cottages, and their quaint attire, and strange lan- guage, altogether indistinguishable to her foreign ear; a new world, of which she had dreamed in her far-off school days, but never thought to know. She entered Vienna wearied and exhausted, for she had not allowed herself a day's repose upon her route, and took lodgings at a hotel. Her imperfect knowledge of German she found to be a source of some inconvenience, but she trusted that a familiarity with it where it was universally spoken would soon overcome this difficulty. Private rooms would have suited her better than this public establishment, as   AGNES STANHOPE.       281 well for the sake of her now lessened means, as for closer concealment, but here, as in Rome, she was a stranger, and also without references. She had called upon Colonel Maitland's agent soon after her arrival, and drawn a hundred pounds from the sum invested to her credit, solely, however, for the purpose of transmitting the news of her safe arrival to Bertha, as the liberal purse she found among her baggage had been sufficient for any probable contingencies for many months to come; but this sudden and unfore- seen necessity of flight in the midst of her security, threw her in a measure upon her own resources. Husband as carefully as she might, the moderate sum "she still possessed, with her increased expenditures, it must ere long be exhausted. This fact brought many anxious reflections, so entirely a stranger, des- titute of recommendations or friends, where could she look for employment? She cast many a wistful eye in her walks at the stores whose windows pre- sented tempting articles of embroidery, and once she gathered courage to enter and make some timid in- quiries of the shopman, which were discouragingly answered, that they had already a sufficient number of employees. The price, too, named for such fine work was so meagre that she saw in her unused fingers it would be quite insufficient to furnish a livelihood. So week after week wore by, each bringing with 13*  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7555-00000141"/> 282      AGNES STANHOPE. it a gradually deepening sence of discouragement as her inquiries continued, when a circumstance, such as often occurs when we approach the darkest hour, came round to bring her relief. This was her ac- quaintance with a German lady, in whom she had unconsciously awakened a friendly interest, since from the first of her arrival in the strange city, she had taken a cordial though unknown sympathy in her fortunes. Her youth, her close weeds, her sad- ness, and evident friendlessness, might well have attracted the attention of a kindly heart, brought into daily contact under the same roof, and though to many eyes the latter circumstance would have presented food for suspicion, Mrs. Reinehart was too much accustomed to trust to the correctness of her natural intuitions to reject them in this particular case. Won by her kindness, Agnes at length ven- tured to confide to her the painful difficulties which beset her, and the lady at once offered her assistance to procure her pupils in music, which offer, we need not add, was eagerly accepted. She set about at once to- fiulfil her word, and Agnes soon had the pleasure of finding herself en- gaged in giving lessons to eight or nine young ladies, with a very fair remuneration. She had now the means of procuring books, and she set herself at work in her intervals of leisure to perfect her know- ledge of German, which, with the necessary relaxa   AQNES STANHOPE.       283 tion of exercise in walks and a few occasional drives, the latter shared with Mrs. Reinehart, 'closely filled her time. She had, now little opportunity for regrets or diseased retrospections., A few anxieties did in- deed yet press heavily upon her in the still night watches, when sleep was banished from her pillow, and in the early morning waking. If Bertha, toward whom this sorrowful necessity of silence :existed, could but know of her brightened circumstances, and if she could but receive welcome news of the little family she left in such unsuspecting peril and sorrow at Rome. But neither of these longings could be safely gratified, and she strove to be content and thankful for so much that had taken place beyond her hopes in the present. So the weeks again went by, lengthing now tran- quilly into months; spring lapsed into summer; summer gave place to autumn; the white winter came round, and the anniversary arrived of the day on which she had looked for the last time in such bewilderment and dismay on the shores of her na- tive land. The soft March winds blew again; but now they brought with them a deadly maleria, a fever, which traversed the length and breadth of Vienna. High and low were its victims; it crossed the threshold of the palace, and found its way into the dwelling of the artizan. Consternation and fear seized upon the  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7555-00000142"/> 284      AGNES STANHOPE, citizens when its contagious nature was discovered. Those who could do so deserted their homes, and in not a few cases, so great was the panic, the sick were abandoned without proper care or attendance. Mrs. Reinehart was one of the first to fall by the pesti- lence, and Agnes dismissed her pupils to watch un- weariedly by the couch of her kind benefactress. The eighth day ended her vigils, and she closed with her own hand the eyes which had beamed upon her ever in kindness; and arrayed the weary limbs for their burial. Her pupils had left the city, or at least, they dared not return to the house of infection;' and left almost the last of the boarders of the lately filled hotel, she turned her thoughts to the hospital, which she had learned that very day overflowed with its crowded and ill-tended patients. Here was a place for usefulness, and there were no reasons why she should shrink from the dangers which guarded the entrance, and barred it as a wall of fire- to hearts tender and trembling in the bands of friends and home. Her --fate lay there, though she knew it not, pressing blindly on. Yes; in those dismal rooms, past those long rows of couches, where the sufferers lay moaning, and some mercifully insensible to the hot heat and restless pain which preyed upon them. She did her duty herei, as she had begun to do it in all these later trials of her life, bravely and well. Her ready hand, her low voice, her hushed footfall,   AGNES STANHOPE.   -    285 brought soothing and aid wherever she passed; many a paling lip blessed her in the rough dialect now as familiar as her mother tongue to her ear, and many a poor invalid, softening in convalesence, thanked her for the kind care which, under God, more than the skill of the good physician, had brought him back to life. Once, on one of her first visits to the ward more especially placed in her charge, her attention was attracted by the utterance of her na- tive language, and on turning she found it to proceed from a gentleman whose wan face, though changed and flushed with fever, particularly attracted her attention. Something about -him struck her. as familiar; yet on further observation she was soon satisfied that they had never met before. Still his air and mien unconsciously touched an old chord, with feelings, too, of hardly unmixed pain, and she tried in vain to explore the cause. It was the acci- dental discovery of a countryman, she thought at last, and the dread of recognition, which at times haunted her, nothing more. She learned on inquiry that he was a stranger arrived but a few days before in Vienna, and being almost immediately seized with the maleria, his servant had quitted him in terror, and he had been at once conveyed to the hospital. The name, De Lacy, brought up some recollections of the painful story with which she was so familiar, but the coincidence was probably an accidental one, and she dismissed it from further thought.  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7555-00000143"/> 286      AGNES STANHOPE. So weeks wore by in the stifling atmosphere of the narow ward. The pestilence which - both within and without the walls of the hospital claimed its hundreds of victims passed her by, and while she Saw her faithful companions fall by her side, she trod her terrible path unscathed. There came at last a day when the destroying angel sheathed his sword, and joy-and thanksgiving returned to the streets of the panic-stricken city. Friendly hands met again in greeting, men held no longer aloof to look with apprehension on their neighbors, the mul- titudes returned slowly from their retreats to their abandoned homes, the busy stores, many of which had been closed in the general consternation, were again thrown open, with their tempting displays of wares and merchandise, and the eager tide of life rushed on as before. Yes, as before, all unmindful of the numbers who in those few short weeks, had been stricken out from the host of the living, remem- bered only in darkened homes, and sepulchred in lonely hearts. Agnes saw the last convalescent go forth from the doors of the hospital, and then return- ed to her old lodgings and her pupils. They came back slowly, the pestilence -had broken even their little number, and there was a weary void in her heart as she caught herself listening in vain for the step and voice of her kind friend. Why had an in-- visible hand guided the pestilence past her, when it   AGNES STANHOPE. -287 had broken so many happy homes, and bereaved so many tender hearts? How mysterious were the ways of God, sparing here the wretched and the friendless, and claiming there the stay and hope of many an eager heart. She saw not the new leaf which was silently weaving in her sombre destiny.  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7555-00000144"/> CHAPTER XXT. A call from M. De Lacy. Agnes took the card from the hand of the servant with a momentary emotion of surprise, but her pupils had just left her, the twilight of the lingering summer day was before her, haunted in her loneliness with a brood of sor- rowful memories, and pausing at the mirror to give a smoothing touch to her soft bands of glossy hair, she went down cheerfully, almost eagerly, to receive her visitor. She had not met him before since that day some six weeks previous, when he had quitted the hos- pital, pale, but thoroughly convalescent, with tremb- ling words of thankfulness and gratitude upon his lips. He came towards her now with the warmth of an old friend, receiving in return a hardly less cordial greeting. "You have been long abroad, Mrs. Jenness?" Little opportunity of conversation had occurred between them in Agnes' former absorbing duties. "Rather more than a year. Indeed, I have pass- ed some sixteen months in Vienna, and a short resi- dence previously in Rome. You have travelled much, I think, Mr. De Lacy?"   AGNES STANHOPE.       289 "Yes, the last three years I have made my home on the continent; in Italy, France, and Spain. I was on my way to St. Petersburg when this late ill- ness attacked me." "Then your stay in Vienna will be short?" "That will depend upon circumstances.  The place wears a friendly look to the 'cold, dreary air it wore when I entered it a stranger, and I may find a home here for many months so come out of my wan- dering life." "Then you have no relatives?" She spoke with a touch of sympathy, something in the quiet, re- pressed sadness of the last words moved her. "None. I have seen the grave close over the last of my kin." He did not add that a deeper grave than that hol- lowed by death inclosed one whose youth had been the joy and light of his heart, the last of his family, the sister between whom and himself lay a gulf too deep for hardly human pity or forgiveness to bridge. Agnes saw the shadow on his face, the gloom which she had marked many a time before, and with her quick woman's tact she turned the conversation to more cheerful themes. They spoke of the past, pf the brilliant city in which their lot of to-day was cast, they went on to the more thrilling legandry of Rome, the history of that beautiful land lying now in its fetters and dark-  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7555-00000145"/> 290      AGNES STANHOPE. ness and Agnes' pale cheek glowed, and she forgot for the first time the dark reality which kept senti- nel at every hour of her life, the glittering sword suspended by a hair over her head. So had she lis- tened to Lawrence, entranced despite of her secret repulsion, as the rich treasures of his cultivated mind flowed forth, but here there was no repulsion, none of that secret shrinking of the pure soul which, while it looks with dazzled eyes upon the whited sepulchre, turns from the corruption and deadness within. Purity and truth beamed from every glance of De Lacy's clear eyes, and pervaded every word. There was that exquisite charm, too, the patience and thought born only in a soul which has passed through the refining ordeal of suffering, and which from its bravely won height can look down through a clearer sweep of light on the follies and errors of its brother kind. For almost the first time since her alienation from Bertha, Agnes felt the peace and repose which the sphere of a noble and deep-toned mind so fully gives. He rose at last to go, and Agnes cheerfully grant- ed the permission he solicited for a repetition of his visit, while he courteously apologized for his present intrusion.  Bound by the common tie of country in a strange land, the one with alieart filled with grat- itude to his benefactress for the tender watch by his sick couch, and the restoration of life, the other   AGNES STANHOPE.       291 softened by the recollection of these very vigils, with their hopes and fears, there seemed nothing unusual in the friendship which had sprung up with such rapid growth. To its natural result Agnes' eyes were strangely blinded, but it is hardly to be doubted that De Lacy saw clearly from the beginning. Years before -he would have shrank from offering his hand and name to a woman who was surrounded with so impenetra- ble a veil of mystery, and into whose guarded con- versation never a word or syllable escaped of the past. But years if they had taught him the wick- . edness and crimes of the world, had deepened to him also the existence of truth and virtue, and many cir- cumstances which might have failed to satisfy a less practiced eye, had shown him the worthiness of the woman he loved. The generous self-devotion which risked life in the infected wards of the hospital where their strange meeting had been brought about, was much less convincing to his clear judgment than the- sunny cheerfulness with which at a later time he had found her taking up the burden of her own support. Little risk was there where there was so little to lose, a friendless and uncared for life, but it was the little daily demands in the beaten -path of duty which made the real test. He could not but discern, too, setting aside for the moment his own partiality, the purity and innocence which beamed from every fea-  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7555-00000146"/> 292      AGNES STANHOPE. ture, and pervaded every movement; and the con- sciousness of this could not but press upon him more and more as he came to know her in the quietly in- creasing intimacy of their daily life. It was true he would gladly have gathered from her own lips the tale of that past which had shadowed so fair a brow, and filled so glad a heart with a sorrow which was plainly not to be worn away, sending her forth an exile from her home and friends, but he had seen that the most distant approach to the subject gave pain, and he wisely relinquished it. Could he' be happy with the knowledge of the existence of such a concealment in so close a relation? to know that a portion of his wife's heart was withheld from him- a portion, too, from which now and then might be drawn forth secret tears and regrets.  With regard to any other woman than Agnes he would have said it was impossible, and even with regard to her there can be little doubt that his own preconceived ideas of the mystery helped to reconcile him to its contin- uance. He knew well her quick, sensitive spirit, and her delicate pride; he knew, too, the eager trustful- ness which, though smothered now by the hard hand of experience, must once have existed in all its force. Her short married life had plainly been a most un- happy one, and there were some circumstances in- terwoven with it which led her to shrink in anguish from  unfolding its pages. That it was shadowed   AGNES STANHOPE.       293 with crime and disgrace, which she must innocently bear as the sharer of her husband's name and for- tunes, was no unlikely supposition; and felony, for- gery, rose up among the innumerable conjectures which presented themselves. How could he beseech her to retrace such a past? Would it not be an act of selfishness when it had ceased to be of necessity to his own convictions? Of the return of his love he could entertain little doubt, and he saw also that these discoveries were yet to be made by herself. So the waning summer wore away, the mild au- tumn came round, and again the white winter spread her snows over the earth. To Agnes the revolving seasons brought little change, they deepened and warmed day by day the beautiful dream which was growing up in her heart, but she knew it not. She knew only that much of the heaviness and pain of the past was gone, and that the image of her new friend rose oftener in her silent reveries than the mournful retrospections and regrets which had crowded them.  It was true her means had materi- ally diminished in the past few months; she had be- gun to feel sensibly the loss of her kind patroness, as one by one her pupils had fallen away, till only two or three remained, and she had begun to eke out her slender purse by embroidery work, which, poorly paid, sometimes trenched far into the still night. But even this was powerless to darken the  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7555-00000147"/> 294      AGNES STANHOPE. sunshine which had begun to eradiate her life. She had her new friend's visits to look forward to, the pleasant books he brought her, which now and' then she could snatch an hour to read, and at rare inter- vals the bright bouquets of English violets, fill of the perfume of pleasant girlhood memories, which came by his thoughtful hand to brighten her little room. De Lacy did not hurry-in his suit. He hesitated to disturb the unconscious calm in which he saw Agnes was wrapt, and he was happy himself in her almost daily presence, and his quiet sense of securi- ty.       :  o -' *   CHAPTER XXT. The opening of the, Christmas week, that second, solemn anniversary of her trembling flight, found Agnes in her chamber, bending over her embroidery, her thoughts for the first time in many weeks linger- ing over those troubled days. Would the hour ever ,come when she would look again upon the shores of her native land? when she should be folded again in Bertha's fond embrace, and her faltering lips could speak to her sister's noble husband her thanks for - the life he had snatched from its awful doom, the life she had then felt so worthless, but which brighter days had revived as a blessed boon? A tear fell si- lently upon the richly colored pattern growing up beneath her fingers-ah, how little had she dreamed in the long ago when the weaving of these glowing roses and pale forget-me-nots had been the pleasure of an idle hour, that the day would come when she should thus earn her bread in a strange land. She brushed it away, and threw a glance at the mirror. Was this the wan, despairing creature of the New- gate cell? this calm, serene woman, whose full brow bore the patient baptism of peace, from whose clear  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7555-00000148"/> 29 6     AGNES STANHOPE. blue eyes something of the old gladness looked out, and to whose pale cheek even, a faint glow of the spring roses was returning. How wonderfully her path had led  And she bent again over the rich silks, slowly parting the gay threads. A knock at the door. A servant had come to an- nounce a visitor; and she went down to receive Mr. De Lacy.  He came forward to meet her with more than his usual eager pleasure, and something in his agitated manner filled her with confusion and surprise. We pass over the first hurried avowal which fell upon her ear, startling her with bewilderment and pain. But the second thought brought the hot blood into her wan cheek, retreating to leave it paler than before. "Mr. De Lacy, I feel deeply your kindness. Had we met before, years ago, I will not deny my answer might have been far different, as it is, I can only thank you, and say that had I forseen your feelings, I would have spared us both this painful interview." "And why, Agnes?   Is it that you have no pre- ference for me? That you cannot learn to returnmy love?" "Graver reasons than those, Mr. De Lacy. Do not press me for them. Permit me to go." She rose to quit the room, but he gently detained her.   AGNES STANHOPE.        297 -"Agnes, I have a right to ask this of you, from your silent encouragement of my hopes, that you will listen to what I am about to say." "Surely, your own heart will acquit me of all in- tentional encouragement. Do not, I entreat you, prolong this distressing conversation. Permit me to leave you." She struggled faintly to withdraw her hand, which he gently but firmly retained. "Hear- me, Agnes. I ask nothing of the past. Let its griefs and sorrows rest. I know Xou wedded an unhappy choice, from which death released you. Others have fallen into as grievous an error, though few may have been led into so thorny a lot. Let: it all go. Let it be between us as if it had never been. I ask only of your hand the present and the future." Agnes' tears fell. She could not control her emo- tion as she sunk down into the seat from which she had risen. She covered her face, and for a few mo- ments wept silently. De Lacy stood beside her wait- ing for her sudden agitation to subside. He was very pale - this passionate distress woke a pitying echo in his heart. Who shall measure the strength of that wild temp- tation. All the Itenderness for which her weary heart pined, strength, succor, shelter, and, dearest of all, the power to confer happiness and blessing on a heart which this hour showed her was nearer than- " *  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7555-00000149"/> 298      AGNES STANHOPE. all the world beside, nearer even than the generous sister -who would have staked her life for-hers. It was not the imaginative passion which had stirred her girlhood, cherished in self-reproach and sorrow, -but the deep, strong love of a maturer time to which she had come through a path of thorns. She withdrew her hands and looked up. Her face was very calm through its tears. ,' If you knew all, Mr. De Lacy, you would cease to urge me. Believe me, and let the subject cease." "First understand me, Agnes; no sin or blame of others in my eyes can attach to you. I know you to be pure, and good, of gentle birth and breeding. What can I ask more?" "Yoti forget, Mr. De Lacy, an unsullied name." 6"It will be lost in mine," he answered, calmly. "Agnes, this is no sudden passion, no light fancy. You of all the world are the only woman who can fill my home and gladden my heart. I loved you from the first hour, when, like an angel of mercy, I saw you by-my couch in my darkness and: suffering. 'That was not the time to speak, when you were merged in the pain and bitterness of a past.' Iwant-, ed, too, to know you better, firmly as I believed my own intuitions. I have seen you take up cheerfully the burden of your support, I have watched day by day the growth of those modest virtues, patience, self-denial, and submission, which would radiate the *   AGNES . STANHOPE.      r 299 atmosphere of the humbldst home. I know that sucA a life could 'not be lived were there a taint of shame or guilt in the past. I have seen its sorrow- ful recollections gradually fading away in the dawn of another and happier day." He paused, but she made no reply. "Agnes, I am not ignorant of what you have for yourself just discovered, that my preference is not unreturned." "Grod help me!" She covered her face again with a trembling shudder. Could she, dare she ac- cept the dazzling happiness so suddenly held out to her? So lonely, so friendless. Alas! the- cruel truth came back. What had she to do with happiness or love ; a condemned felon, for whom in her native land the gallows still waited! "Spare me, Mr. De Lacy. Spare us both." "Agnes, is it wise, is it best, thus to throw from you a true heart, and for an idle chimera only? Is the question of my disappointment nothing? Is the blight and sorrow of the future to be yours alone?" "O, Mr. De Lacy, if you -knew all-if I could but tell you!"                 - I -do not ask to know, Agnes. Never fuller con- fidence filled man's heart than that which I offer you."  She was silent. He saw the contending emotions struggling in her pale face. He so noble, so gener-  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7555-00000150"/> 800      AGNES STANHOPE. ous. And yonder the creary, bleak life stretching away before her. What should she do with the days when she should no longer listen for his footstep, or look on to the pleasant hours brightened by his voice and smile? The light had suddenly gone out of her life. She saw it and felt it in a dumb despair. De Lacy took her hand. "I will detain you no longer, Agnes, if you will promise me one thing. I see that you are wearied and exhausted. Take a little time for reflection. I know I may trust your word.  Promise to see me to-morrow." "It is useless, Mr. De Lacy. Spare us both a continuance of such bitter pain. I pray you to take my answer now." "I cannot. Now you are distraught and unlike yourself. I must see you to-morrow." l She yielded, weary with opposition, though against her better judgment, and so they parted. That De Lacy was neither surprised or pained by the manner in which his suit had been received we run little risk in asserting. A readier acceptance would have disappointed him in the fine- estimate he had formed of Agnes' character. But he knew well the circumstances which surrounded her; he knew also the strength of her regard for himself, and he saw clearly that his perseverance would not fail of its result. Alone in her quiet chamber Agnes saw the Christ-   AGNES STANHOPE.       801 mas sun go down over the roofs of the happy. Ger- man homes, and sighed to remember that for her the glad greetings of that happy time, with its blessed home reunions, its garlands, and tender gifts, had died out in the past. The laborer in yonder cottage, eating his black bread day after day, in the sweat and dust of toil, was happier to-night with his chil- dren round his knee, than she, doomed to go through life alone, an outcast from all the sweet ties of love and home, with not even the mournful compensation of knowing that her burdened life might confer on others good and blessing. No, she must see others happy, where her hand or voice were -unneeded, while her ill-repaid labor would bring to her but the meagre necessities of food and shelter. J Why was she so cursed and set apart from her kind? Was not the sin of her youth expiated long ago? Could this great -sacrifice after all be carried out? She thought again over the dreary life stretching away in the future. The noon of this troubled morning had not yet swept into sight: how could she pass on weary and foot-sore through its slowly unfolding years into the shadows of night. After all she felt in her heart, by the depth of its own truth, that De Lacy loved her with a love which not even this aw- ful charge hanging over her could shake. He had said no sin or blame of others in his eyes could at- tach to her. If he knew all, would he sue for her  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7555-00000151"/> 802;      AGNES ST'ANOPE. love still? Would he give the protection: of his proud name to the- hunted and trembling, criminal, a criminal before the eyes of all the world, her inno, cence cleared only to the hearts of the few who loved her? It might be, but she dared not test his gener- osity.  She dared not: say to him, "I am that infa- mous woman, whose trial you have yourself read, whom an English bench and jurors found guilty of the most horrible of crimes, and sentenced to the gallows. 1 No, she dared not say it. She couldnot meet the horror-stricken glance of those averted eyes, she could not by a word ehi into aversion the homage which had suddenly grown so sweet. The night waned away at last, and with the clear light of morn flooding her chamber, Agnes rose from her sleepless pillow to begin the duties of another day. How heavily the golden sands of the yester- days dragged, how tardy the wheels of the long hours had suddenly grown.  She shrank from the painful interview before her, to which she felt she had unwisely suffered herself to submit. But there was now   no retreat, and she resolved at least to shorten as briefly as might be the pain of that long farewell.  How vast the change which a  few moments will sometimes bring about in our prospects, coloring the hopes and dreams of a life. How truly we find more and more as we go on in our lengthen;ng journey   AGNES STANHOPE.       303 that the path we tread is marked out by another hand than our own. Had any one told Agnes when she descended pale and agitated to the parlor, where her lover awaited her, the results of that dreaded interview, she would have turned from them in dismay and disbelief. Yet so it was. The firm resolve of the night melted away before the charm of that beloved presence, and the magic of those woving words, and when she left him at last, it was with a betrothal ring upon her fin- ger, and a trembling joy in her heart, flushing with its rosy hues all the future. She paused to think how it had come about when she reached her chamber, and sunk down by the window, to look out with vacant eyes on the red winter sunshine flooding the long street. Yes, how it had come about. She hardly knew, everything was so unreal. But she turned to the glistening dia- mond which sent up its ray in the sunshine, and she remembered how his voice had saddened as he said, "' It was my mother's, Agnes," and these few words' seemed to make clearer to her all that was so soon to come. Her lot to be again merged in another's, the name which had brought her only a feverish love, closing in wretchedness and misery, to be forever cast aside; rank, wealth, all she could have asked-for in happier days, with more, a thousand fold. more than these, the love and devotion of a true heart.  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7555-00000152"/> O04      AGNES STANHOP]E. Yes, it was no dream. God help her to make her- self worthy of such a future, which had dawned up- on her darkest hour. And then the recollection of her secret rushed suddenly over her to chill the prayer and banish the warm glow from her cheek. "I wish I could have told him all! I wish I were not so weak, so miserably weak I  I did tell him of my fault to Bertha, the one stain of my life, and how tenderly he pitied me.  Would he have been less generous had I told him all? I can never, never be happy, after all." But little space for sombre broodings was left to Agnes in the short week which intervened to her second bridals. De Lacy had urged that their mar- riage should take place at the close of the holidays, and she had yielded a hesitating yet not altogether reluctant consent. So the short days came and went in the bustle of preparation, the selection of satins and laces, the orderings of the bridal paraphernalia, varied by her lover's frequent visits, and the strug- gling doubt which beset her, sleeping and waking, if the great change at hand were real, if it were not after all a troubled and misty dream. But the morning dawned at last, with its skies of sapphire blue, and white, glistening streets, O, how unlike that gray September morning at lonely South- sea I! and putting off for the last time the sombre weeds of her widowhood, Agnes arrayed herself in   AGNES STANHOPE.       305 the snowy satins, and glistening pearls, befitting a bride. The carriage had come. She threw a last glance in the mirror, murmured a last prayer for this day of all days, and went down to place her hand in the clasp which waited it, the clasp which was to fold it evermore. What sudden thought blanched the warm glow on the bride's cheek as she knelt before the altar in the dim old church. The light poured down in its many-colored tints from the high, stained windows. A few idle specta- tors had stolen into the nave to gaze upon the stran- ger's marriage. Only the bridesmaid and the groomsman, new friends of De Lacy's, with the old English resident who gave away the bride, and the surpliced priest, made up the little group. De Lacy  saw the sudden tremor which stole through the bowed form beside him, and he felt the instant's pause in the low murmur of the plighting vows.  But the scene was a solemn one; he felt it himself, the sacredness and earnestness of the hour, and he knew beside, that many an old recollection to which he was a stranger, might well press into the troth of the lonely young creature who looked to him henceforth to replace the past. God give him strength to do so in better and happier days I and he said it over fervently as he passed with his newly- wedded wife up the aisle. Few were the congratu- "*  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7555-00000153"/> 306      AGNES STANHOPE. lations; and now they re-entered the carriage which was to convey them their own home. Their own home-a large and handsome dwelling in a pleasant part of the city, which De Lacy had purchased and fitted up with every luxury which his ample means and refined taste could furnish. He led Agnes into the hall, where the domestics were drawn up to receive her, and they passed on to her own suite of rooms, the boudoir and dressing- room, in whose English furniture and arrangement a pleasant surprise awaited her. Her eyes wandered from the pretty rosewood furniture, the pale, rose- tinted hangings, the few rare pictures gracing the walls, and the vases on the little marble table, crowd- ed with roses and sweet mignonette, to the giver at her side.  Her voice trembled as she said, "God help me to make myself worthy of all your love." "God preserve you to me, dear Agnes," and he knew not why his young wife started and trembled, as if some evil omen lay in his words. Why had they come  so fervently from his heart? He knew not, but Agnes knew, and she saw again the shadow which darkened over even her wedding day.   CHAPTER   XXD I. We pass over an interval of six long years, which brings round again the anniversary of Agnes' flight. Still in Vienna, still leading the tranquil life on whose threshold we left her, happy in the love of her hus- band, the almost reverential obedience of domestics, the warm appreciation of friends, and the blessings of the poor. Time has brought to her the change which it brings to us all; the fair, slight girl has matured into the beautiful woman, more than fulfil- ing the promise of her youth. At her husband's board, where the elite and talent of Vienna are wel- comed, the charm of her grace and brilliance are universally felt, and though mingling little in public assemblies, or general gatherings, few English resi- dents are more widely known, or hold a more envia- ble position. But how is it with the shadow which still hangs over the future? Is it banished in the long security of this new life? I think not.  I think even the very depth of her happiness made Agnes tremble at times for its con- tinuance. I think, too, that that weary exile, with all the love which blessed her, pressed heavily upon her   &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7555-00000154"/> 308      AGNES STANHOPE. -heart. She could not but remember what must be Bertha's anxieties ; how startling to her must be this long, silence. She could not but feel from her own love that many a tear must now and then dim those soft hazel eyes, over the picture of a lonely stranger's grave in a far-off land. But she dared not write. Little of danger as there might be, blotted out as her name was from others' memories in new events and changes, still she must not incur even that little for De Lacy's sake. And even could she write it would be to bring another anguish to her sister's heart. How could she tell her that with this awful doom hanging over her she had dared to wed in se- cresy and silence an honorable man.  That lookinh upon her lonely life, and feeling that this was the love which in the happy past should have crowned it, she had weakly yielded to his prayers. Bertha, with her clear sense of duty, would have told -him all, would have laid before him even the infamy and shame which might blot his own proud name if it sheltered her, would have told him the awful doom which at any hour might tear her from his side, the awfUl doom which the most careless recognition at any moment might bring about. Time and again she bhad wished she had done so, time and again, but too tlate. The hour had long passed when those tremb- ling words should have been spoken. This eighth anniversary, however, was destined to   AGNES STANHOPE.       809 prove of more importance than any of its immediate predecessors, and to break up the calm of that secu- rity in which her fears had begun to lull. A recog- nition was about to take place which of all others she had most reason to dread. She had driven out early that morning to a shop, to add some forgotten purchase to her collection of holiday gifts, and was paJsing over the dainty laces which the attentive shopman displayed for her selec- tion, when the sound of a familiar voice caused her to turn with an involuntary start, and she found her- self face to face with Lawrence. She was too star- tled for words, but stood pale and motionless, her eyes riveted upon his face. He had already recog- nized her, had indeed caught a glimpse of her face when she alighted from the carriage, and followed her in. He stood evidently enjoying her -onsterna- tion for a moment before he spoke. ("This is an unexpected pleasure, Mrs. Maitland. I did not think on my entrance into this strange city this morning I should so soon meet with an old friend." "I pray you drop this irony, Mr. Lawrence," said Agnes, speaking scarcely above her breath. She turned to move towards the door. He quiet- ly interposed before her. "My dear Mrs. Maitland, do not think that I cher- ish any unfriendly recollections of the past. You  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7555-00000155"/> Wv      AGNES STANHOPE. judged me a little harshy, and interfered with my fiancee, but it wae? from an overdrawn sense of duty. I have had time to appreciate your motives, and for- get my disappointment. I assure you I am delight- ed to have met you; and looking so well. I should hardly have known you." "You perceive the pleasure is not mutual," said Agnes, encountering the. evil look which, under all this courteous semblance, would not be smothered, and reading well the passion and revenge which rankled below. "I am sorry to perceive it. I think, however, I have. some claim upon your regard." "Indeed, I am at a loss." Her voice was firm, but her color settled into a deadlier whiteness. "I will not revive your recollections here. It might be dangerous." Agnes laid her hand upon the counter by which she stood. She could with difficulty support herself under the tremor of agitation and terror which shook every nerve.. Fortunately the man who had waited upon her had been called to an opposite part of the room by. an entrance of fresh customers-there were few in the store at this early hour-and the short conversation had been carried on in English. Lawrence drew a little nearer without seeming to note her shrinking movement of repulsion. "I beg a  thousand pardons, Mrs. Maitland. I am very un-   AGNES STANHOPE.        3" fortunate. I confess to a little pique at the manner of my reception. It has hurried me into imprudent words. I meant only that I had always shown you the regard of a friend, at our last meeting in Rome, as well as in England, and that such friendship mer- ited a better return." "What do you demand, sir?"She turned round and faced him, rallying all her self-control. He drew back a step, a little abashed before her steady look. "Do not not place it in that light, Mrs. Maitland, a demand. But I offer it to your own sense of right if my conduct has not merited a different welcome." Agnes trembled. She had never felt her heart sink and grow so utterly faint but once before. He saw his advantage. "I see I am distressing you. I think a little reflection will show you your injustice, and disarm you of suspicion. I will not detain you longer this morning. May I beg permis- sion to see you again?" She answered, without appearing to heed his last words, "How long do you remain here?" "That will depend upon circumstances. Possibly some months." She was silent. -6 Pardon me, Mrs. Maitland, for reminding you that you have not replied to my question. Will you permit me the pleasure of renewing our acquain-  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7555-00000156"/>    AWAUiUB SLTANHOPE. tance? Believe me, it is a most happy surprise to meet a familiar face, and .one associated with so many recollections, in a city of strangers." "It is impossible, Mr. Lawrence. It is quite im- possible." He threw a sudden glance at the rich colors which composed her dress; he had noted the change in her sombre weeds before, but it had almost escaped his thoughts in the still more surprising change in her radiant face. -Suddenly his eye became riveted, and a quick change passed over his features. He had caught sight of the betrothal ring upon her finger, for she had removed her glove in examining the laces, which still lay scattered upon the counter, and in her confusion had forgotten to replace it. He had seen that glittering ring before, and his con- sciene-quickened memory told him where. Where but upon the hand of that wife and mother whose fair head he had brought to a sorrowful grave. Yes, he had seen it last in that far-off English home, to- day lonely and deserted, whose lavish hospitalities he had shafred, but which he had entered only to desecrate and dishonor. But it was not conscience, or the voice of keen regrets, which blanched his ruddy cheek.  It was fear, craven fear. He knew that the hour in which his path should cross De Lacey's would be his last; that the deadly wrong he had done merited neither challenge or warning. He   AGNES STANHOPE.       313 knew, I say, or rather, he believed, for guilt makes cowards of us all; and that his enemy, when the first heat of hot blood -was over, should leave him to the sure retribution of his crime he never dreamed. For this he had left England, and lingered abroad in exile, weary years; winged with this dread he had retraced his steps on his first discovery of De Lacy's presence on the continent; and when the fear of be- ing entangled in the suspicions which followed his friend's sudden death again hurried him abroad, he had gone in secret doubt and misgiving, trembling at every step lest he should meet at last the avenger, the face which haunted his pillow and his wretched dreams. Now, when he had least expected it, in the presence of Agnes Maitland, the woman he had be- lieved so lonely and friendless There was not a moment for thought. He turned away without a word, and passed into the street. A hurried walk took him to the office where his pass- port must be obtained, which chanced to be but a square's distance, and barely an hour later saw him on his rapid route to Berlin, leaving Vienna far behind him. A whirl of miserable thoughts were struggling in his breast as the coach flew on, its speed quickened tenfold by the glittering pieces of gold he had thrust into the hand of the driver. Thwarted in his eager revenge, thwarted where he had thought himself  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7555-00000157"/> 814,     AGEMS STANHOPE. most secure, how suddenly had that pale, trembling woman stood transformed before him, with his fate / in her word. He knew her to be De Lacy's wife- no other woman could wear that jewel-but how or what strange means had brought them together, he could not attempt to fathom. He went back to the bitter disappointment which had crushed his hopes at Rome, just as they were in their fairest train of filfiinlenti; how he had seen the golden fortune within his grasp wrenched away. He recalled the morning when, flushed with confidence, he had pre- sented himself for an interview with his mistress, to be received to his consternation by her grave father, whose clouded brow and constrained greeting roused at once his apprehensions. Again he unfolded the letter which Mr. Trevannion slowly placed in his reluctant hand, and read the trembling lines, to which no denial or confutation could .be uttered. How hopelessly he tried to cast the bitter story by, as a mis-step of the long ago, a sin committed in hot youth, which ought not to condemn all his life. How he- pleaded to his hearer's own knowledge of the world to find excuse for his one rash fault, and how delicately he referred to the woman who had wrought all this mischief, as most unhappily prejudiced against him, and, for he believed her to be innocent (could he have made a finer stroke of policy?), half-crazed by her misery to the doubting of her best friends.   AGNES STANHOPE.       315 Again he met the cold, steady gaze which answered his vain appeal, and saw that the blunt Suffolk squire, made clear-seeing by his simple honesty, knew bet- ter than to trust his child for another hour to his dangerous attractions. He would not discredit his word, he said courteously, but he would himself perceive the propriety of putting forward such in- quiries as should indeed have been made before .the matter had progressed so far. He had written to Mrs. Trevannion's friends in London already, by that morning's mail, and a very few days he trusted would bring a reply. There was no more to hope/; his brilliant prospects were indeed crushed out. He knew Adele's love for him; he knew it well, and that an hour's pleading in a girl's eyes might throw these specious tales to the air, and win her to an elopement, which would secure all. But that was not now to be; the cautious guardians knew the value of time as well as himself, and he went forth from the doors which were to close upon him hence- forth with bitter curses in his heart. Gloomy recollections were these for the long ride to Berlin, over the broad, white snows, on this chill, winter day. The Christmas chimes, as they passed the villages, woke no cheerful echoes in his thoughts. On, on, they went, and he saw his life stretching away before him, the past, and the to be, bleak and dreary, like the gray sky above and the crisp earth beneath.  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7555-00000158"/> CHAPTER XXIV. We return to Agnes, whom we left bewildered and roused from her terror by Lawrence's abrupt departure. Of the cause of his singular conduct she was of course Wholly ignorant; but she recov- ered herself sufficiently to take advantage of it by entering her carriage and giving orders to the driver at once to take her home. She could not dismiss the unwelcome fear of being followed, but there was no other course to pursue, and she tried to compose herself that her agitation might not attract her hus- band's notice. She was not very successful, how- ever, as she saw on De Lacy's face when she entered the drawing-room. He had been evidently awaiting her return, that she saw from the pleasure in his first glance, and her eye fell now on the files of open papers and foreign looking letters spread out on the table beside him. He started and came towards her. "You are very pale, Agnes. What has hap- pened?" "Nothing," she said, quietly. "I met an old ac- quaintance, whom I have not seen for many years, and I was sorry for the recognition."   AGNES STANHOPE.       317 He bowed with an air of relief, and tightening a little his hold upon the hand he had taken,- without any other answer, led her back to the seat from which he had risen. "It is somewhat singular, Agnes, that such an event this morning should open the news I have been waiting to tell you." "You have had letters," she said faintly, glancing at the English postmarks before her. "Yes; my cousin Ralph is dead. You have never heard me speak of him. He was a strange, ecentric man. But he has left me all his property. Owing to his careless habits it is sadly involved." He paused; there was plainly something more which he hesitated to say. Agnes looked up. He took her hand in his, and went on slowly. "Agnes, this event necessitates our return to England." To England I  She grew white, her respiration seemed to stop, and she felt that an icy chill struck the fingers which folded hers. "I knew that the first thought would be painful," he continued, "and for your sake I could have wished this return still put off, as it has been year after year. But happy as we have been here, dear Agnes, we could not wish to make our home in this foreign land, much less our graves." She was silent; in her dumb terror she could find no voice to reply. If she could at last have told him  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7555-00000159"/> 818      AGNES STANHOPE. all, the sure dangers which confronted this rashest of rash steps. All I and read in his horror-stricken face the cold chill of aversion and doubt! Never, never. "We have, indeed been happy here," she said faintly; 'so -happy I tremble at the thought of change. (Cannot: you trust these entangling affairs in the hands of your lawyer? Is your presence really so indispensable to their settlement?" "I fear it is. The estate is so entangled and in- volved that nothing short of my presence on the spot can :.promise -a speedy adjustment." She was silent. What could she urge to a course so plainly important to her husband's interests, and where her real reason, the . strongest of all possible motives, must be forced back. De Lacy's voice roused her from her-reflections with a sudden start. "I am sorry, Agnes," he said kindly," that the prospect of this return presents so dark a side. For myself, I confess that the thought of looking again upon my native land, after so many years of absence, of realizing my boy-dreams of a happy English home, thrills me with the :warmest emotions. Will you not try to overcome the sensi- bilities which linger too sorrowfully around the past? Will you not, when we re-enter upon the old scenes- which must so vividly revive that past, dwell more upon your new lot, the happiness you daily diffuse   AGNES STANHOPE.       319 through your husband's heart, and the peace and blessing which your virtues and goodness radiate upon all around you?" It was the first hour in the six long years they- had passed side by side in which an allusion had escaped his lips to the absent mood and troubled brow which must have struck him time after time. What -was this great sorrow which not even his love could charm away? What were these dark recollections which could blanch his wife'st cheek and chill her hand to an icy coldness at the thought of a return, which to him, with all his own hoarded bitterness of memories, brought little but gladness? Agnes looked up to meet the gaze which she felt was bent upon her, and for the first time hers sunk a little beneath the searching and grave inquiry of those earnest eyes. Yet there was kindness in the look, nothing of doubt, suspicion or even pain, nothing before which her timid heart could quail. She saw the wish struggling in his thought, which he was too noble to utter, and the next moment her lips might have revealed all, and the sorrowfuq pages we have yet to recall remained unwritten. But so it was not to be. The dark path was not yet trod; it threaded far away in the distance. The bell rang, quickly answered by the servant's step in the hall, and fol- lowed by the familiar voices of visitors. Agnes rose hurriedly to retire to her dressing-room, and De  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7555-00000160"/> 820      AGNES STANHOPE. Lacy, rising also, with a stifled sigh went forward to receive them. The shock of her husband's announcement had quite dismissed her unfortunate recognition from Ag- nes' mind, but she had leisure to recall it as she sat before the mirror in her dressing-room, her long, brown tresses surrendered to the busy hands .of her tire-woman. She wondered at the dismay which' had suddenly spread over Lawrence's dark face as he quitted her, unheeded then in her own terror, but vividly recalled now. She lost herself in trying to fathom the cause of his singular departure. Had he indeed taken means to trace her, and would he ac- complish the revenge which lay so completely in his power,? Why should she dream that he would spare her.' Why should she rest in so strange a hope? She had crossed him in a most tender object, the pos- session of a rich fortune, to which the hand that be- stowed it was but as the title deed. bhe had incur- red his bitterest enmity, and what compassion in so cruel a heart could withhold him from using the means her mifrtunes placed in his hand. Why, indeed, had he hesitated at all? Why not at once denounced her, and brought about her arrest? Yes, in that very store. There was a motive, hardly less cruel and abhorrent, which she well knew had with- held for the moment his purpose. This might also lead him to seek another interview, to attempt first   AGNES STANHOPE.       221 what terror might accomplish in what he believed to be her lonely and friendless condition. Even should he discover her marriage, and the new circumstances in which it had placed her, it might effect no change in this plan. What she had to dread, then, was an- other interview. - She must guard against it, and for the next few days, at least, she was safe. Yes, till they should set out on that mournful journey of re- turn, that return to England, which those fatal let- ters of to-day had fixed, and which no power of hers could recall. She felt thankful now for the timely interposition which had restrained her rash avowal. As she had jelt a hundred times before, so she said now in her heart of hearts, those words should have been spoken in the hour of her betrothal, or never after. "What will you wear, my lady?"  And Agnes roused herself to throw a glance in the mirror at her dark chestnut braids, with their glistening circlet of pearls, and then to select from her overflowing ward- robe a dress befitting the day, and suited to his taste, whose lightest wish she had learned to value. It was a heavy, dark brocade, trimmed with rich lace falling in ample waves around the neck and shoul- ders, and hurriedly clasping on her bracelets, as a wandering glance told her the lateness of the hour, she went down to her guests. No one who met the ease of her welcome, or the smile upon her lip, would 15  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7555-00000161"/> 322      AGNES STANHOPE. have dreamed of the struggle going on beneath. She was very pale, it was true, and her eyes, save in their first quiet glance at her entrance, were veiled beneath their long lashes, but these slight signs of emotion were unobserved and unnoted by the careless stran- gers. De Lacy was relieved and grateful, for he had expected a stronger opposition to his wishes, and he saw now in the first glance at their meeting, in those trifles which those who knoweach other thoroughly, with that knowledge which is born alone of love and the intimacy of daily intercourse, can read, that she had reconciled herself to this return. A momentary recollection of the icy chill of her handand the un- controllable anguish she had shown, did indeed strike him, and- for the instant painfully, but in the absence of any paramount cause how could he linger over them? He had anticipated, too, the shock which his news must give her; the anguish which the first thought of treading again those sorrowfully familiar scenes would arouse in all its strength. But he knew also that when the first shrinking surprise was over, and she had grown calm, her heart would revert to it more hopefully, and mingling with her clear sense of the necessities of the step, would come the exile's natural yearning for the dear home-land. He knew, or thought he knew, for the future which his outstretched hand might almost have touched, was closely hid from his sealed eyes, and he saw not   AGNES STANHOPE.       323 the dismal looming scaffold which haunted the pil- low beside him, and cast its shadow through the long day. Agnes could not but feel the unusual kindness of his manner when their guests had withdrawn, and they were again alone. She tried to arouse herself to respond, to put on a cheerfulness she was far from feeling, and to listen with composure to his plans for their immediate setting out. A few days at the far- thest would complete these sudden preparations, they would linger a day or two in, Rome, the only stopping-place on their hasty route, and three weeks at most, with God's blessing, would see them landed safely on English shores. And now De Lacy spoke for the first time of his own quiet past, of the happy home of his youth, the fond mother, and the noble father, who slumbered beneath the chancel of the old church, under the stately monuments of their house. He spoke, too, of his young brother, the gifted and gentle boy, who had died in the flush of his, first youth, borne away by that insidious disease which claims its victims from the loveliest and the best. "You would have loved him, Agnes. He had all your sensibility, all the glowing earnestness which I delight to watch when a word or a thought moves you, inmyour kind- ling eye, and upon your warm cheek. Exquisitely gifted by nature, and with all that indominitable  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7555-00000162"/> 824      AGNES STANHOIPE. perseverance which is the birth-right of Genius, I cannot but think at times how much his pure and noble spirit, by its lofty creations, would have en- riched its kind,--could he have been spared-but God saw otherwise." And De Lacy bowed his head in that silent emotion which thrilled to its depths his strong heart, though twelve long years had gone since those mournful days of bitter sorrows and chastening regrets. Agnes looked upon him, but for once her lips were mute r' She thought of the great love which could say, as every tender day of his life did, that she had replaced this past. She thought of the Ihour which might be so close at hand, the footstep which at any moment might echo at the door, and it seemed to her chill heart that never had the terrible consequences of her silence, time and again as she had- reviewed them, risen in such dread array before her. DeLacy's eyes were turned from her face; he saw nothing of her silence or her changing look. There was another page of the past, and this of un- mingled bitterness and grief, which he was unwill- ingly turning. That page had a secret link for both, but its existence to the other neither knew, close as was their intimacy in the closest tie of human rela- tions. The brother looked again upon the face which had been the light of his youth, the joy of his fair- mother, the secret pride of his stern father; he   AGNES STANHOPE.       325 thought of the smiling mouth, the clear dark eyes, the laugh, the song-all changed, a change more fearful than that which the chill cold grave, or the worm, can work. He thought, too, of the fearful debt to pay, the debt which with such bitter struggles he had given up to Him who in his own sure time and way avenges the heaviest wrongs. He started suddenly from his revery, and turned to the pure, fair countenance at his side. ,' I must not chill you, Agnes, with my sorrowful recollections. It is an evil omen for the eve of our return." She yielded slowly to his smile and the magic of ,his brightening mood. But a stray syllable brought back unconsciously their first strange meeting, with its throng of pleasant memories, and lovers as they still were, how could either linger unbrightened over those happy days. Agnes forgot again the chasm yawning at her feet; she remembered only that she was the wife of De Lacy, in heart and soul at least, but for the dark chain of circumstances, and that one concealment, worthy of his confidence; and when at a late hour she rose to leave him, and felt the un- usual tenderness of his parting kiss, it was with a heart half hopeful, with all the grim array of the future.  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7555-00000163"/> CHAPlTEf   X X IV. Again in Rome. But under what far different circumstances from those in which she had quitted it, a terror-stricken fugitive in her rapid flight. Hardly a week from the receipt of those important letters had witnessed their final departure from Vienna, their departure, unimpeded and undelayed. Lawrence's strange leave-taking and silence still re- mained a mystery, but she had little time to brood. over it in the train of the hurrying future. Not without a few tears and many regrets, did she bid farewell to the city which had given her so tranquil an asylum, where the sweetest dream of her life had dawned, and where six long years of happiness, as perfect, but for its one restriction, as ever falls to the lot of mortals, had been granted her. Three days had been fixed upon as the limit of their stay in Rome, but the vessel in which De Lacy succeeded in securing their passage was not to sail for another week, and they had. no alternative but to submit to the short delay. Only one incident of sufficient importance for detail occurred in this in- terval, taken up as it was with visits to places of interest, those time-hallowed spots, not for the first   AGNES STANHOPE.       327 time looked upon by De Lacy at least, but on this occasion doubly hallowed to both by the charm of congenial companionship. This event was Agnes' secret visit to the Protestant burying ground, a neatly walled enclosure, centered in a quiet spot, whither a feeling at first almost difficult of solution to herself drew her. But the silent impulse required no further explanation as she paused in her slow walk before a plain white monument, bearing the simple inscription: MARIA, Wife of William Trevannion, Esq., Of Suffolk, England. They had gone back to their native land, the hus- band and daughter, leaving her here in this lonely spot, watered with many sorrowful tears, among strangers. Agnes bent down to pluck one of the deep blue blossoms which, though the little vine was now half-choked by weeds, blew thickly over the mound under the clement winter sky, and drawing her veil over her face, turned away. The days flew swiftly round and brought at last the hour which saw her embarking again upon that dreary waste of waters which she had crossed eight years before, under the clear mid-winter skies, not unlike those which now hung over the trackless path-of her return. Then in bewilderment and terror, leav-  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7555-00000164"/> 328      AGNES STANHOPE. ing all she loved behind her, and looking on to a future scorched as by the burning wind of the desert, which held nothing that could re-people the desola- tion of the past. - She knew not then the wonderful power which had so silently revived her dead hopes, which had given her back tenfold, faith, and trust, and love. .Was the lesson all in vain? did it teach her nothing of the present, the clear over-watching eye which saw what she could not see, a little way on, the happy end-? Yes; but she could not forget that the like doom had overtaken many another, as innocent, as happy and blessed as her in the love of husband and home. But with all its struggles and hopes, her heart grew faint within her as their long passage neared at length the destined haven, and when through the haze of the fading sunset the well known spires of London loomed in sight as she stood upon the deck by her husband's side, it was with a wild prayer upon her lips, "O, my God, give me strength for all that awaits me there I " that she retired to the still- ness of her state-room. But short were the closing moments to be spent in preparation. Soon the ves-, sel's keel serged at the wharf; soon came the eager din of'voices and the loud shouts of command, and De Lacy's eager step paused at the door. She gave him her hand to lead her up the narrow stairs, while she drew her veil closely over her face to hide the   AGNES STANHOPE.       329 gloom which contrasted so strangely with the radi- ance beaming in, his. Her foot touched the pier, and the next moment she was lifted into the carriage, which stood waiting, in liveries, to convey them home. "You are very pale, Agnes," said De Lacy, as he lifted her out at the marble steps. "You are wearied with this long, rough- voyage." He said nothing of the mental anguish which made a deeper shadow upon her white brow than the wanness of fatigue; but he led her gently into the brilliantly lighted hall, where the servants were drawn up to receive their master and mistress, and thence to her dressing- room, where he left her in the hands of her maid. She felt, as the echoes of his step died- away in the passage, what she had felt many a time before, the stern necessity of forgetfulness and self-control. Soon her travelling attire was thrown aside, her dark braids re-arranged, and when an hour later De. Lacy returned to give her his arm to the dining-room, she met him with her old smile, and answered cheerfully his now unrepressed congratulations on their safe return. 15*  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7555-00000165"/> CHAPTER XXV, The sunset of that winter day fell upon Bertha in her quiet boudoir, dreaming over old recollections, sorrowing with a sorrow which years could not soften over the one bitter trial in her happy lot. She knew not why these recollections pressed most heavily this long day, why the night before had found her sleep- less pillow wet with tears, why the unutterable yearning for the sight of that dear face, the sound of that familiar voice, in this still hour seemed deep- ened tenfold. She saw not the white sails furling at the wharf; she dreamed not of the return which was so soon to fulfil her long-uttered prayer; to fulfil it, but O, where and how I If I only knew, Phillip, if this mystery could only be removed; if I could stand by her grave, and know that in her friendlessness and suffering, strangers tried to fill the place of kindred; to have some last word.. O, it is the suspense that is terrible." "My poor wife. We have done for the best,' all that we could do. Try to take comfort in that, try to think of all we hazarded for her, that she knew your love. After all, Bertha, I cannot think her dead;   AGNES STANHOPE.       331 circumstances, some unfortunate meeting, a dread of recognition, might have led her to flee from Rome, and friends have been raised up to her in her need."' "tI dare not hope so, Phillip. She would have written in these long years, at least one line." "I think not, so terrible a danger hanging over her. And she knew on the first discovery of her escape where suspicion would light. Yes, she must be silent, with all her knowledge of our anxieties and fears." "It may be so, but I dare not hope. O, if God in his own good time would bring round the revelation of that awful mystery, and clear her name, I think I would have nothing more to ask." A ball given by Mrs. De Lacy. It was not a pub- lic, promiscuous assembly, like those which had pre- ceded it in the now waning season, but rather a select party, chosen by De Lacy from his old friends, who had crowded round him: to welcome him back to England, and his new accession of property. The first intimation of her husband's wishes-had Struck Agnes with dismay, and again she could not control the deadly fear, and the trembling apprehension which shook every nerve. But a moment's reflection again showed her the reasonableness of his wish, and the difficulty of opposition. There were circumstancs, too, which she had aldy.:; eagerly contemplated,-  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7555-00000166"/> 332      AGNES STANHOPE. and which rose up anew to aid and strengthen her. She could not be unconscious of the changes which these eight long years had brought about, how they had thinned by death, absence, and through multi- form ways, the circle in which -as a timid bride she had for a few. months mingled, neither could she be ignorant of the great change they had wrought-in herself, the transformation of the timid, shy girl, into the mature and stately woman. She could not but be sensible, too, of the wide difference between the associates ofthe unfortunate Maitland, and the friends of De Lacy, who though inheriting a little of the natural foible of family pride, regarded fashion and splendor as of little value when unattached to worth and talent. Again, she had cultivated no intimacies in that old London life, and where so many new stars appeared successively to glow and disappear, and where new matters of excitement were constant- ly rising, who would take the interest-to recall her unfortunate face and history?  Who, also, beside all this, would dream that the rich and beautiful Mrs. De Lacy, however singular might be the resemblance, could be one with poor Agnes Maitland, So the evening came, and arrayed in satins and diamonds, Agnes stood forward in her brilliantly lighted drawing rooms to receive her guests. The summer warmth of the rooms, with the excite- ment of the hour, flushed her cheeks to a fever heat,   AGNES STANHOPEo        333 and never had she looked more radiantly fair in her German home, or worn, over all her trembling doubt and dread, a more graceful ease and composure.* But this powerful self-control was to be severely tasked, when at the commencement of the evening, in the very midst of the throng of guests, her husband an- nounced Judge Rathburn. She looked up. The same face which had frowned upon the bench at her trial, the broad brow, surrounded by its silvery gray hairs, confronted her. For the instant her heart sunk, but the recollection of the hundred eyes riveted upon her, and De Lacy's presence at her side, kept her voice firm, and the wavering color in her cheek. She felt rather than saw the gleam of puzzled recol- lection which kindled in his cold grey eye, but he bowed to her, murmured a few words of courtesy, and [passed on, and she breathed again. The music struck up a waltz, the dancers took their places in couples on the floor, and Agnes, re- leased from the groups which surrounded her in the momentary confusion, stole out into the conservatory for a breath of the fresh air. The cool current into which she passed from the hot atmosphere revived her, and steadied her flutter- ing pulses, but the bloom and sweetness of the flowers could bring no peace to her troubled heart. She stood leaning against one of the slender white pillars, listlessly watching the velvet leaves of the  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7555-00000167"/> 334      AGNES STANHOPE. rose she-had gathered fall one by one from her hand, when the sound of voices in the neighboring alcove attracted her attention. She started, but the thick clusters of the laurestinum, in whose shadow she stood, effectually screened her from observation. "Yes, she is very beautiful," said the speaker, evidently in reply to some observation of his com- panion. "Her face is strangely familliar to me, but I cannot recall when or where we have met," "Indeed, I believe De Lacy married her abroad." They passed on, Judge Rathburn and his com- panion, wholly unheeding the white face parted from them only by the branches of the thick laurestinum, and the large eyes which followed them with such a searching depth of despair. "You are ill, Mrs. De Lacy!"Other steps had followed, had paused before her, but it was not until the sound of her own name fell upon her ear that she looked up. "It is only a little faintness-the heated rooms." She tried to recollect herself, and to recall the name ofthe stranger who had been presented to her a few moments before by her husband. "Are you wearied of the dance so soon, Mr. Leslie." "I have been unsuccessful in obtaining a partner." She smiled and glanced at him with a little more attention   AGNES STANHOPE.       335 There was nothing very repellant in the face before her, the exterior was that of a gentleman of birth and breeding, with tolerable grace of manner, yet there was something in its expression which made her eyes drop suddenly, and quickened the still trem- ulous flutter of her heart. Was it possible they had met before? The strains of the music, and, the tread of the dancers came from the rooms beyond. "Your conservatory is very rich, Mrs. DeLacy. I have rarely seen such success in our dull English climate. You have gathered all the beauty of Paris gardens. But DeLacy is perfect in his tastes here as everywhere else. Were you ever in Devon- shire?" "Never." She took his arm mechanically for a stroll through the walk. As she did so she felt the searching eyes wnich seemed to burn into her face, but the look was instantly withdrawn. "It is one of the loveliest counties in England," he went on. "I speak with a little leaning to par- tiality, perhaps, I have known so many happy hours there in the life time of the former Mrs. De Lacy." "Indeed, I can believe you without placing any- thing to the shadow of association. Mr. De Lacy has described his old home to me so glowingly, time after time, I am warmly in love with it, I think I should recognise it as a stranger."  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7555-00000168"/> 336      AGNES STANHOPE. "' With his inherent love of his ancient patrimony and his strong home tastes, I have wondered what could retain him so long abroad." ggnes felt the color waver in her cheek. She felt, too, that her emotion was not unnoted by her com- panion, but she answered quietly, and with a forced smile, "Are you unacquainted, Mr. Leslie, with the fascinations of foreign travel, the charm of new scenes and strange faces?"             . No," he answered, gravely, "not for a lonely life. I have myself passed some two years on the conti- nent, but a home in Rome or Paris is quite another matter, for one so thoroughly English in character." "Ah, then you have visited Paris? I have never had that pleasure. My home abroad was in Ger- many." It was a fruitful theme which was now started, a. multitude of common topics, interesting to those of similar tastes who have trod the same far-off scenes, but Agnes was already conscious that her absence was lapsing beyond the privilege of a hostess; her husband's shadowed- brow, too, rose up before her,. and, at the last recollection she turned slowly to re- trace her steps. Mr. Leslie yielded to the movement with a half- reluctant air. "I beg your pardon, Mrs. De Lacy," he said, " for detaining you so long from your guests. Will you grant it, and honor me with your hand for the next quadrille?"   AGNES STANHOPE.       337 "I do not dance." De Lacy met them on their entrance into the drawing-rooms. "I have been looking for you, Agnes," he said, with a courteous bow and smile lb her escort, which if they were intended to be of dis- missal, Mr. Leslie did not see fit to immediatly ac- cept. "I have promised my interest to my old friend, Mr. Mortimer, to procure him your hand for this dance." The music at that instant struck up a lively peal. "I see he is coming this way. May I not hope to plead with success?" "I cannot dance," she answered hurriedly; " the heat oppresses me," and she took his arm. "Shall we go into the refreshment room?" He yielded, with an uneasy glance at her flushed face. Her cheeks were suffused with a fever red, and her eyes shone with unusual lustre. They passed on in silence through the brilliant rooms and among the gaily dressed groups, gathered in clusters or forming for the floor, to the room beyond, where the board stood spread with the richest viands and rarest wines that could tempt an epicure, intermixed and surrounded with the choicest clusters of hot-house blossoms. Agnes drained .eagerly. the glass of sparkling champaigne which De Lacy poured out. It steaded her fluttering nerves, gave her back strength, and relieved by the departure of her sudden indisposition, -"            &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7555-00000169"/> 388      AGNES STANHOPE. which he at once imputed to the cause she had her* self given, her -husband led her back to her guests. Mr. Leslie rejoined them at their entrance, but he Ifnd little opportunity of again monopolizing his fair hostess in the group which surrounded her. Radiant with grace and ease, the grave shadowed woman of the moment before had disappeared, re- placed by the fascinating Mrs. De Lacy, of happy Vienna memories, and richly was -she repaid by the light in DeLacy's eyes' as they met hers. That chance look seemed to nerve her heart tenfold, and not once again through the long hours, which seemed to wear away on leaden wings, did her color waver or her voice sink. But the long night began to close, the guests to break up. Once more she stood up to face the man in whose hands lay the un- conscious possession of her secret; to bend her head to his courteous adieus, and to feel, or fancy she could feel, his eyes dwell lingeringly upon her face, while a sudden struggle for recollection knit his wrinkled brow and parted his thin lips. She lingered alone at last in. the deserted rooms, whose gay throng had disappeared to give place to a stillness like the hush of the grave, and throwing a weary glance around the desolation, which the drooping garlands and still brilliant lights seemed to deepen, went slowly up to her dressing-room. Shea sent out her maid, who came in sleepily to proffer   AGNES STANHOPE.       339 her usual service, and sinking back in her heavy damask-covered chair, with her hands folded list- lessly before her, fell into a profound and troubled revery. The trance of fancied security was broke*. She knew not until the unfortunate recognition of the hour before how strong had been her hopes, and to what a silent growth .they had attained. She wondered now at her blindness, her pitiable cre- dulity. To think that eight short years, with all the aids of wealth and station, could have so changed her face as to insure forgetfulness. Why had she not opposed this fatal return? Why had she not knelt and entreated against it with prayers and tears? Why, rather, had she not foreseen this hour? Why did she listen to De Lacy to drag- him down into her abyss of shame and misery? The very depth of her love should have withheld her from in- volving him in her wretchedness. The gray dawn of the winter morning found her still in her rich ball robes, the diamonds glittering in her hair, contrasting, O how sadly, with her wan face. She started as the flood of day paled the glim- mer of the lamp, and hurriedly proceeded to ex- change her gay robes for her wrapper, and to seek her couch. Her- maid must not find her lingering thus in the disarray of the ball-room. Enough of dangers, enough of difficulties already environed her. "You are unused to excitement, Agnes," was De  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7555-00000170"/> 340      AGNES STANHOPE. Lacy's cheerful greeting as they met in the pleasant breakfast-room. "Last night's weary hours have stolen the roses from your cheek. But it is a tax Aet all have to pay for rank and position." "It is a tax," murmured the poor wife. She took her place at the head of the table, and poured out the chocolate from the silver urn with an unsteady hand. "How soon, Mr. De Lacy, will your business be completed, that we can go into the country. I am longing to breathe the clear air of the Devonshire vales, and to meet the eager greeting which waits for us in your old home." "Not before the London season is over, Agnes. These tedious lawyers with their musty parchments; Markland is now investigating a claim upon a rich farm, which he says is held on false tenure. It be- -longs to the Headlestone estate. Poor Ralph was very remiss in exacting his dues, and his agent seems to have been wholly unprincipled. It is a length- ened complication, and will not come to a speedy disentanglement in the hands- of the law." ; The close of the London season, six long weeks. Agnes toyed absently with her spoon. Her eyes were bent down on her plate, and DeLacy saw nothing of the uneasiness his reply had awakened. "By the way, Agnes, I quite forgot an old friend in our invitations yesterday-I am - extremely sorry -Colonel Maitland and his lady."   AGNES STANHOPE.       841 It was fortunate that at that moment the loud twitter of the canaries, Agnes' birds, who hung in their gilded cages over the long opposite window, drew his eyes from his wife's changing color. "He was an old friend of my father's," he went on, " though some years his junior. A gentleman of fine character and high reputation. I believe he married soon after I went abroad." "I had an impression that I met a familiar face last evening," said Agnes, with desperate calmness. "It has haunted me this morning, and I'have been endeavoring to think myself in error." "You allude to Leslie," said De Lacy quietly. "He mentioned to me in the course of the evening that your countenance struck him as strangely familiar, and manifested some interest to learn in what part of Germany we had met.   He has himself spent some time abroad." "Did he always bear his present name?" "No; he has taken it only on his accession to property, a condition coupled with his uncle's will. His mother was a Leslie. She was a fine woman. I fear he does not much resemble her, but we must have charity for the tardiest reforms." Agnes looked down. If so exceptionable in morals, -what could have procured him the honor of her hus- band's friendship. De Lacy seemed to penetrate her thought, for he:  &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7555-00000171"/> 812      AGNES STANHOPE. went on, "Mrs. Leshe was a dear friend of my mother's. Her lot was a very sorrowful one; and when I think of the temptations which were thrust into the path of her son, and the one only re 7train- ing influence, I wonder less at his careless habits. His father's death wrought some change in his cir- cumstances, but this was unhappily soon followed by that of his mother. Oa coming into this property he has made an effort to throw off his old associates, and I hope the reformation may be successful. I can hope much-for the son of so noble a mother." Agnes did not ask the name which Leshe had so lately cast aside. She had heard enough, and felt at that moment she could not have borne more with- out losing her strained self-control. This new danger was no chimera of her imagina- tion, no phantom raised up by her daily terrors. If not fully recognized, this new acquaintance's suspi- cions were at least aroused, and wanted only a favor- able opportunity for confirmation. She sat silent till the meal was ended, and De Lacy rose to go out. He paused to inquire, with his usual attention, her programme for the day. An hour with his lawyer that morning, and then from lunch to dinner he was at her disposal. They would drive in the park, it was a fine, clear day, and leave their card for Colonel and Mrs. Maitland. No objection could be offered to this plan, and she withdrew again   AGNES STANHOPE.       343 to her chamber, where a short interval of quiet awaited her. She saw plainly that the meeting with Bertha was nAt to be escaped. Under any other circumstances than these which closed so hopelessly around her, how eagerly her heart would havesprung up at the fulfilment of its long-cherished prayer; but now it only added to the perils which seened to deepen at every step. She hoped that some fortunate chance would secure De Lacy's absence at the shock of their first interview. Bertha's emotion, even if she could guard her own voice, might well betray her. But at all events there was no escape, either of the meeting or the recognition. Should she de- cline to open neighborhood with them, which she could offer no reason for doing, she had the daily chance of meeting them in some private circle, in public assemblies, or even in her drives or walks. It was true she' had endeavored to keep herself as secluded as her circumstances would permit, but in De Lacy's ignorance of the terrible necessity of this secrecy, she could of course command little real pri- va3y or seclusion. De Lacy noticed her paleness and absent air as he handed her into the carriage on their drive, but he imputed them, naturally enough, to the effort of the past evening. Unconsciously the fresh air bright- ened her a they drove on, and when they reached the park she had succeeded in calling back her ban-  &#xD;<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7555-00000172"/> 844      AGNES STANHOPE. ished smiles, and something of her wonted cheerful- ness. There was the usual throng of gaily dressed people, and the glitter of carriages and showy liver- ies, which that hour of the day presented. Mr. Leslie, whom a turn in the park suddenly revealed on horseback, came up to her window, as the carriage paused for De Lacy to speak to some friends who had attracted his attention on the oppo- site side. He was charmed to see her looking so well after the fatigues of the evening. She bowed coldly to his compliments, and tried to recall pre- cisely under what circumstances they had met before, an effort rendered not at all easier by the conscious- ness that the same struggle was going on in his face, but here doubt was slowly merging into conviction. She leaned back from the window in time to catch a parting view of the gentlemen with whom her husband had been -conversing, in one of whom, t  her agitated surprise, she recognized Colonel Mait- land. The discovery was not mutual; her position had hid -her face from his view, and she sunk back against the cushions, while De Lacy, returning Leslies courteous bow, the carriage passed on. It was near the early twilight when they reached home. Agnes went up to her dressing-room to make her toilet for dinner, and on her return sat down to the" piano at De Lacy's request. It was -the first   AGNES STANHOPE.        345 time since the evening of their return that they had found themselves alone together at this hour, and the change was for the time pleasant to both. Agnes sang him all the simple English songs he loved, sim- ple in their beauty and naturalness, and then sat idly running her fingers over the keys. The long, soft twilight had not quite gone; the glow of the cold, red sunset lay yet dimly upon the large panes of the western window, and lit up the icy shrubs bordering the deserted walk. "I met Colonel Maitland this morning," said De Lacy, breaking the long pause; " one of the gentle- men with whom I was speaking while you were engaged with Mr. Leslie. I have not seen him before since our return. He apologized for not presenting himself earlier, with Mrs. Maitland, to pay his re- spects." The dim light hid Agnes' changing face. She gathered courage to reply, "Do they reside the year round in London?" "No; the Colonel has a handsome seat in Suffolk. By the way, I am a little interested to meet the new Mrs. Maitland. We always thought the Colonel such an incorrigible bachelor. He had a nephew to whom he was. very much attached, but who I be- lieve turned out very ill. I remember to have met him a few times, but that was years ago, at his uncle's house. He had a fair exterior enough, but seemed to me even then to want heart."  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7555-00000173"/> 346      AGNES STANHOPE. What burning plough-shares we sometimes unwit- tingly tread upon in the ordeal of life. De Lacy never dreamed of the close and sorrowful relation this man had borne to the beloved wife at his side, or that the terrible circumstances of his death, which though he had known them at the time, had now almost escaped his memory, had been the blight apd grief which had followed her up to this hour. i Neither spoke again in the few moments which followed; the dinner-bell rang, and they proceeded to the cheerfully lighted dining-room. De Lacy was in his happiest mood. The meeting with old friends, the happy circumstances of his return, so unlike those of his sorrowful departure, shed an unusual glow over ibis spirits. Agnes saw all that was passing in his heart, and it deepened her own already crush- ing anxieties. But she forced back resolutely her truant thoughts, and lingered with him cheerfully over the future home in Devonshire, the happy Eng- lish home, which short as were the lingering weeks that intervened, it might be God's solemn will that she should never know. The two following days came in a chill, wintery storm, which kept Agnes to the pleasant shelter of her drawing-rooms, but the third morning dawned clear and fair, bringing at fashionable hours a little bevy of formal visitors. Among these was Mr. Leslie, who lingered when nearly all the others had taken   AGNES STANHOPE.        347 leave, and through a second arrival of visitors, whom she would gladly have received alone. - Colonel Maitland and lady." She did not raise her eyes at the servant's announcement. She felt, with an indescribable dread, that the faces around her were growing indistinct, and that an icy coldness was chilling her from head to foot. Suddenly she became conscious of a strange hush in the room, an oppressive stillness. She looked up; she rose. Bertha was standing a few steps from her, so pale, so fearfully pale, the delicate roses which nestled in her dark hair, against the soft folds of her Parisian bonnet, hardly whiter than her brow and cheek. Agnes touched her sister's hand. She murmured' a few words which sounded strange to her own ears, and bowed to Colonel Maitland, of whose presence she was conscious, without daring to raise her eyes to his face. Then the other guests followed with their greetings, and the pause in the conversation was broken by Mr. Leslie's voice. Moved by one of those impulses which we have all recognized at times, she turned toward him to discover to her bewilder- ing terror that to one at least her secret was revealed. She saw it in the smothered gleam of intelligence in his dark eye, and in the lines which still retained the traces of sudden surprise around his pliant mouth. She stole a glance around the room. On the well- bred faces she encountered, there was not a trace of  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7555-00000174"/> 348      AGNES STAN HOPEo interest or surprise. The emotion, whatever it was, if it had been observed at all, was entirely on Mrs.: Maitland's side. Mrs. De Lacy's color had not sunk,  and her downcast eyes had veiled the expression of her face. Agnes hardly knew how the next half-hour passed. She had a vague recollection of smiles and graceful words, all those careless nothings which go current in the coin and glitter of society; of trying to keep her thoughts on De Lacy, and thinking how terrible it would be to be dragged from him as a felon. She had a vague recollection, too, of the strange, cold chill of Colonel Maitland's hand as it met hers at parting- Colonel Maitland, whose face in that long half-hour she had not once seen-and a puzzled wonder why Mr. Leslie should see fit to linger till the last comer -had risen to make her adieus, and then part from her with such an unusual earnestness in eye and voice; compassion, pity, she could almost have dreamed, if she had not spurned the -thought. In one thing at least circumstances had favored her, her husband's absence, whose time was now in- creasingly given up to his lawyer's demands. Had he been present, neither her own agitation nor Bertha's could have escaped him,. and though he might have been too generous to require an explana- tion, the scene would have lingered in his memory none the less. But she had little time to think over   AGNES STANHOPE.       349 this in the recollection of Leslie's discovery. Would he keep her secret? What motive existed to impel him to its disclosure. He was her husband's friend,  not on the strength of intimacy or congeniality, it was true, but from the tie of old associations, a bond hardly less powerful, and slow to break. It might be a poor foundation to build upon, yet it was better than many another, and besides, it was her all. She did remember, with a feeling of reluctance, Leslie's marked courtesy to herself, and that henceforth, whatever phase it might assume, must be endured with the complaisance of fear; but she said again, "In a few weeks we shall be in the shelter of Devon- shire, peaceful Devonshire, and all this will be at an end."  &#xD;<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC7555-00000175"/> CHAPTER XXVI. The long weeks wore away, winter lapsed into spring, March slowly waned into the dawn of April, and still De Lacy lingered in London. The inter- val came round with little outward change to Ag- nes, but she felt in her heart that the silent march of events was not less surely hurrying to the end. During this period no second interview had taken place with her sister. She had seen her twice or thrice at a distance, once from her box in the opera, in an opposite part of the house, and again in her drives in the park, where De Lacy, with all his in- creasing pre-occupation, still found leisure to attend her. Twice, indeed, Mrs. Maitland had called in her absence, when she was fortunately out, on one occasion accompanied by her husband, and once an invitation had reached them to a formal dinner party at the Colonel's, by which a home'engagement also fortunately enabled her to decline. She knew well Bertha's now trebled anxieties, and she shrank from an interview in which she had no comfort or relief to offer, for she well knew that her sister's worst ap- prehensions could not exceed the dangers of her po- sition. Mr. Leslie came often, indeed his mornings  e   AGNES STANHOPE.        351 were now almost invariably spent in her drawing rooms, whither he sometimes brought his aunt, tie- widowed Lady Margaret Leslie, but oftener came un- accompanied, to linger till the last visitor had taken leave, when no further excuse could offer for his lengthened stay. Of Judge Rathburn she saw lit- tle. She- heard of him immersed with his usual ab- sorption in the dry duties of his profession, and once she encountered him in one of her shopping excur- sions, in the thronged street, when she was in the act of alighting from her carriage to enter a fashion- able store, and met again his courtly bow, and the puzzled gleam of his cold gray eye, struggling to re- member when and where he had first met that strangely familiar face. The same drive on that clear March day introduc- ed another event, of a different character, and more pleasing to the recipient of her kindness at least. On her return she paused for a formal call on a lady to whose acquaintance De Lacy had introduced her, and on alighting at the marble steps her attention was attracted by the face of a young girl, upon whom the porter had just closed the door. There was nothing very striking in the pale, sad face, or the humble garb; such sights in a great city were too much of its everyday life, but the countenance was familiar, and Agnes pondered thoughtfully over it as she passed in. Mrs. Bernard was alone, and re-  &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7555-00000176"/> 352      AGNES STANHOPE. ceived her with eager impressment and pleasure. The visitor, as she rose to go, drew the conversation round adroitly to the face she had met on her en- trance. "You refer to my seamstress' daughter, Fanny Moreton. Yes, she is quite distingue looking for one of her class. But they once knew better days. Her father was a lieutenant. But they are wretch- edly poor now." She did not think it necessary to add that she had known her seamstress in these bet- ter days, when Alice Maitland was deemed no unfit associate even for Mrs. Bernard. "Will you give me her street and number, or place where she lives? I may like to engage her. I dare say she under- stands all kinds of embroidery as well as plain sew- ing. People who have fallen from her circumstan- ces generally do." "It is an out of the way place." And Mrs. Bernard gave the address with evident reluctance. She did not like being rivalled and ousted in her comfortable economies by the rich Mrs. De Lacy, for her new seamstress, in her poverty and hard necessity, was content to labor with her needle at almost any price. There was no feeling of gratulation or triumph in Agnes' heart as her carriage drove home. Rather an emotion of pitiful compassion for the hard lot which her own brief expetience had revealed so well, and here deepened tenfold by a mother's pressing anxie- ties. She had read long before, in the files of English   AGNES STANHOPE.       353 papers which constantly reached De Lacy in heir stay abroad, the sudden death of Lieutenant Moreton, and had thought at the time over the impoverished circumstances in which his widow would be likely to find herself, and the very doubtful assistance she would receive from Colonel Maitland, with whom she had never been a favorite. Not that such as- sistance would have been one hour withheld if solic- ited, but Mrs. Moreton had her pride, though differ- ing in kind from her brother's, and she had never forgotten the slight which had lost sight of her since the event of her well portioned marriage, or forgiv- en, in turn, the event of her uncle's own marriage, an event so absurd, and so wholly unlooked for. Agnes' first step on her return was to retire to her dressing-room, and inclose to the address she had ob- tained the liberal sum of some fifty pounds, which she could well spare from De Lacy's ample .allow- ance to her private wants. This she dispatched by a trusty servant to the post, and with that satisfac- tion which the consciousness of a fulfilled duty ever bestows, rang her bell for her maid to assist her to dress for dinner. We pass on for a moment to the humble abode where Mrs. Moreton, with her little flock gathered around her, toils early and late over the never ended seams, far into the hours of the still night. This clear March day has dawned under a pressure of 16*  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7555-00000177"/> 854      AGNES STANHOPE. unusual weariness and discouragement.  It has found her repining for the hundredth time over the hard fate which has so constantly hedged in her lot, from the day of her unprosperous marriage to these poverty, stricken years of her widowhood. She thinks with a stern bitterness of her unpitying uncle, wrapt in luxury, and bestowing the wealth which should have been hers upon a stranger, a plotting, revengeful girl, with only the idle fascinations of a pretty face, while she and hers are left to starve. Yes, for the last shilling has been paid for rent, and the little sum due from Mrs. Bernard, though hoard- ed with the most miserly economy, cannot be made. to stretch far into the opening week. It was true Colonel Maitland knew little of her circumstances, or her deplorable poverty, but she believed the over- sight on his part to be intentional, and that knowing as he did the sorrowful fact of her husband's death, and the scanty pay attached to his commission, he required no other information. She remembered Colonel Maitland's presence at the trial of Agnes, she knew that but one motive could have led him thither, and that the manner in which her own evi- dence on that occasion had been rendered, had widened irreparably the breach already existing be- tween them. Could she, under this circumstance, plead for his charity, and in the face of his new wife, whose idea she cordially detested? No, not unless thp worst pame, and possibly not even then.   AGNES STANHOPE.        355 The postman was at the door. She surrendered reluctantly the penny which lessened by a moiety even her little store; but her eye became rivited as she glanced at the address, and as she tore it hur- riedly open the fifty pound note fluttered to the floor. It was a most welcome gift, and it softened her heart probably more than anything which had crossed it in the course of her busy life. Her quick eye re- cognised the hand at once, with all its endeavor at disguise, and she started with a feeling of real regret at the discovery of Agnes' presence in London. Foolish girl, what can have brought her back. Does she not know the unsleeping vigilance of jus- tice, and that it never forgets. Once passed into that dismal hole of Newgate again, and not ah Col- onel Maitland's wealth can save her. An invitation to a ball at Mrs. Mortimer's. It was at the close of the season, and this sumptuous fete given by the rich London banker at his hand- some country villa in the outskirts of the city, on the banks of the silvery winding Thames, partook more of the air of a select party than the usual promiscuous assemblage of guests. Agnes, as usual, shrank from the dangerous publicity, the possibility of some chance meeting and recognition, but De Lacy, for the first time, showed a' disposition for her accept- ance, and she had no sufficient objection to offer. The secret yearning, too, for a meeting with Bertha,  &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7555-00000178"/> 356       AGNES STANHOPE. which painful as must be all the circumstances at- tending it, had begun to grow upon her of late, had no little part in lessening the reluctance of her sub- mission. They found the drawing rooms well filled, but not to overflowing, on their arrival. De Lacy led. her up to their hostess, and after the first moments of their reception were over, lingered at her side till a little circle of his friends joined them, whom he sev- erally presented to her, and with whom he entered into animated conversation. Agnes sat a little apart from the group, listening to the pleasant murmur of voices, answering and replying now and then to some sentence addressed to herself, but hardly dar- ing to raise her eyes lest she should encounter some familiar countenance, and secretly longing to escape from the somewhat conspicuous position in which she found herself placed. Suadenly a voice at her side caught her attention, and she looked up to meet t the quiet glance of Judge Rathburn. He was stand- ing by her chair, and her position, a little apart from the circle before her, gave him a favorable opportu- nity for addressing her. She could not control, in the surprise of the moment, her sudden change of color, or the perceptible shudder which passed over her, but she found voice to answer his salutations, and recollection to bend courteously to his formal compliments.   AGNES STANHOPE.       357 "I believe I have had the pleasure of meeting you but once since the evening I was presented to you at } our ball, Mrs. De Lacy. I do not recall why, but your countenance has lingered with me as strangely familiar. Is it possible my memory has grown so treacherous as to forget in your new name some former friend?" She felt her color paling again into the whiteness of marble, and a chill as cold creeping around her sinking heart. But De Lacy's cheerful voice came at that instant to her ear, and hers steadied to the calm reply: "It is possible we may have met before. But it must have been years ago, for I have been long abroad." "Then you are English by birth? I was sure of that." "Yes." She felt again the steady look bent upon her, not with the rudeness of a prolonged stare, but with a  puzzled struggle of memory, a recollection which under her agitation was plainly beginning to dawn. At that instant, to her ineffable relief, the music struck up a waltz, a movement took place in the cir- cle before her, her companion drew a step back, and Leslie forced his way through the press of the throng. "Will you honor me with your hand in this dance,- Mrs. De Lacy?')  &#xD;<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7555-00000179"/> 358      AGNES STANHOPE. "I do not waltz." "I am extremely sorry. Perhaps your objections would not extend to a ramble in our hostess'.beauti- ful conservatory. I see you have quite lost your color in these hot rooms." She glanced at her husband, he was at that mo- ment closely absorbed with his companions, and she suffered Leslie to draw her hand through his arm. Judge Rathburn returned, with his usual good breeding, her slight parting bow.  Leshe had throughout seemed oblivious of his presence, and they moved on. Neither spoke until the sweet perfume of the mul- titude of rare plants which filled the niches and al- coves of the room into which they were passing stole upon them, and the murmur of voices and tread of feet grew faint behind. "I must congratulate myself, Mrs. De Lacy, on an opportunity to which I have looked forward with much anxiety of late." She started, and stole a glance at his face. There was something in the glimpse she caught of its ex- pression, averted as it was, which went far from re- assuring her. She disengaged her hand mechanically from his arm, and paused in the alcove where they stood, si- lently gathering one of the little clusters of orange6 blossoms which blew thickly along the walk.   AGNES STANHOPE.       359 "You will not understand me, Mrs. De Lacy," he went on, turning a penetrating look upon her face. "You will pardon me then for reminding you of what you have so steadily ignored that my introduction to you on your late return from abroad was not our first meeting." He did not need to watch that fluctuating and pal- ing face to see that the fact was as well known to her- self, though the time and place might still remain a mystery. "A lady's memory -is sometimes treacherous. I do not need to tell Mr. Leslie that a gentleman in such cases is bound to bow to her caprices." "In ordinary cases. But Mrs. De Lacy will al- low that exceptions may exist." She was silent. Her trembling lips could hazard no answer. "I do not mean to alarm you," he went on, low- ering his voice to an undertone. "I have *waited for this opportunity day after day. There have been moments when I could hardly re- frain from speaking, hemmed in as we were, when I saw you so blindly tempting your fate, lingering, lingering, in this fatal spot. Do you think there are other eyes less clear than mine? Do you know from what I saved you only a moment ago." Must she listen to him. Must she stand here and suffer him to talk on. The indignant blood burned  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7555-00000180"/> 360      AGNES STANHOPE. in her cheek; she forgot for a moment the pitiable truth, and the terrors of disclosure. But they rush- ed back upon her recollection, even as her lips mov- ed to reply. The kindling eye fell, and the passion- ate glow died out. "Pardon me, Mrs. De Lacy, pardon my abrupt- ness, and let the dangers which press around you plead its excuse. There is no safety for you here. There is no rest for you but in instant flight. You must quit London at once, and return to the conti- nent. Your flight, too, must take place in such a manner as to leave no trace behind you." He paus- ed, and awaited a reply. "Icannot even thank you, Mr. Leslie, for your well meant caution," said Agnes, at length. "Where we have met before I cannot recall, neither do I seek to ask. It is possible that I know the ground on which I stand better than you. But with your leave we will waive this painful subject." "Agnes! what madness, what folly I Why will you rush into so terrible a doom, from which no gold, if it were poured out like water, could snatch you a second time. Is it because you dare not trust De Lacy with your peril, because his cold heart will fail you? Do you think you have no other friend? Listen-hear me-do not turn away with-such a look; it is no time for scorn. I would pour out my life for you. I would save you at any hazard, and at any cost."   AGNES STANHOPE.        361 "You forget, Mr. Leslie," said Agnes, with stern dignity, "to whom you are speaking, to a wife, hon- ored and beloved; trusted and blessed beyond her deserts."; "I forget nothing," he answered, impatiently. "I forget nothing of your danger, and that you dare not trust him with it. Is this confidence? Is this love?" There was a light step behind them.  Agnes turned suddenly to find herself confronted by Ber- tha. The sisters greeted each other with tolerable self- possession. Bertha's color indeed came and went, bit Agnes was too thankful for - the timely interrup- tion, and too much excited by the words which had just been addressed to her, to betray the emotion which at any other moment she would have felt. Leshe was evidently disconcerted. This mieeting of all others he had not calculated upon, though he had previously recognised Mrs. Maitland in the throng of guests. He made an effort at first to recover his ground, and linger through the prolonged tete-a-tete, but this he soon saw was hopeless, and pleading an engagement for the second dance, which his happy fancy enabled him to supply, quitted them abruptly, and returned to the ball room. Left alone the sisters soon quitted the inclosing walls of the conservatory, with its sheltering alcoves  &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7555-00000181"/> 362      AGNES STANHOPE. and walks of planits, and passed out into the open air. It was in the mild dawn of April, and the walks were thickly bordered with bursting blossoms and buds, interspersed here and there with clumps of laurel, and beyond, sparkling in the moonbeams, the glisten- ing sheet of a little fountain. Both were silent and agitated. They averted their faces from each other. Bertha was overpow- ered by a sense of the danger in which she knew her unfortunate sister to be placed. Agnes was stupified by the recollection of the daring words which had just been poured into her ear, and which she was powerless to resent. Bertha spoke first. "Tell me, Agnes, what hag brought you back? What rashest of rash dreams? And how under the circumstances in which I see you?" She started, as if disturbed by the whisper of her own name, and glanced uneasily at the tall shrubs which bordered the path they were entering. Bertha's eye followed hers. "There is nothing to fear, Agnes, in this lonesome walk of evergreen and holly. The gay company we have left will choose to wander rather by the fountain, and among the blooming parterres. We are quite alone. I dare not keep you long. Speak to me. How it is that I met you here and thus?" "It is little to-tell," said Agnes, calmly. "I am   q63 AGNES STANHOPE. what I seem, the honored wife of De Lacy. He knew me as a widow; an unhappy exile. Alas, he knew nothing more."  Bertha wrung her hands. "O, Agnes, was there no voice to warn you. How could you keep silent. Did you forget that this inevitable return to England would bring you into the very face of ruin?" "I did not dream of our return to England. We were happy abroad. His cousin's death brought him back." ' Unhappy Agnes." They passed on in silence for several rods. Bertha broke the silence again. "Agnes, are you sensible of the peril which surrounds you? Do you know that this mine may be sprung at any moment? Do you know that your only safety lies in immediate. departure from London?" "It is impossible," she answered, mournfully. ,' Business detains my husband here--business which he cannot dismiss." "Not to save his wife? himself?" "Bertha, spare me." "Agnes, I tremble for you, A few days, a few hours even, may prove too late. Will the pain of hearing from your own lips the concealment you have practised, begin to equal the agony and shame of a public disclosure?" "Bertha, I would brave a thousand such dangers rather than meet his look. I cannot, I dare not."*  &#xD;<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7555-00000182"/> 364      AGNES STANHOPE. A shadow fell suddenly across their path. Both the sisters started. De Lacy put back the rugged branch of a graceful fir, and stood before them. His surprised glance caught the emotion so plainly legible upon the pale faces of both, but he was too thorough a gentleman to betray his surprise. "I beg your pardon, ladies," he said, with his usual easy courtesy. "I entered the conservatory just as you were quitting it, and took the liberty of following you to join your ramble. A friend detained me a few moments, and I lost sight of you in the grounds, but this cross path has accidentally led me right. May I venture to hope I have not intruded?" "Impossible," said Bertha gracefully. "We were speaking of old times. I had the pleasure of know- ing Mrs. De Lacy before she went abroad." "Indeed." His wife's past was so little known to him that De Lacy manifested some constraint at this announcement. Agnes convulsively pressed her sister's arm. "This evening air is chilly," she said suddenly. "Had we not better retrace our steps?" They went slowly back to the conservatory and the gay ball-room. Bertha strove to throw off the constraint which seemed suddenly to have enwrapped them each, and De Lacy readily seconded her en- deavor. Agnes began to listen to their conversation and to answer. There were many scattered groups   AGNES STANHOPE.       365 in the open walks which they had now reached, more particularly by the glistening fountain near which their path led, and her eye wandered un- consciously among them in its quest of new faces. She encountered Leslie again, though at a distance, but the fair countenance of the lady leaning upon his arm, with her clear blonde complexion and golden ringlets -surely they were familiar. She looked again - it was Adele Trevannion. Both her com- panions followed her glance. "You are attracted by the belle of the evening, Mrs. De Lacy," said Bertha- how strangely the name sounded to herself upon her lips,- "Miss Trevannion. She is very, very lovely, and as pure and good as she is fair. They are neighbors of ours in Suffolk," turning to DeLacy. "She has lost her mother, poor girl, though that was some years ago. But I always feel sad when I see a beauty and an heiress come out under other chaperonage than that one tenderest and best. This is her second season, but she seems in no hurry to take up with any of the fortune hunters who flock around her. Leslie, for one, has been quite assiduous in his devotions until he came into his late property, since which they have fallen off." "He seems to be coming back to his allegiance," said De Lacy. "The young lady might do worse. Leslie has some fine qualities, though rather obscured  &#xD;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7555-00000183"/> 366      AGNES STANHOPE. by his unfortunate training. He needs a good wife to bring them out." Bertha smiled. "It would be a dangerous hazard. I know so many cases which have turned out ill," and she fell into silence. The orchestra struck up a lively waltz as they entered the ball-room. Colonel Maitland came for- ward to meet them. He bowed to Agnes--he had met De Lacy before in the commencement of the evening, where the latter's first presentation to Bertha had taken place - and after a few moment's conver- sation, sustained on her part with an ill grace, offered his arm to the refreshment room. The press of the throng rendered the refusal of this courtesy difficult, the more that De Lacy had lingered a little behind, drawn back, as she suspected, purposely by Bertha's management, to give an opportunity to her husband to repeat the warning which she had so fruitlessly urged. Of its entire failure, and that Agnes' posi- tion equalled all their worst fears, he could perceive plainly enough in the shadowed brow he was so ac- customed to read. Colonel Maitland felt his sister-in-law's hand trem- ble upon his arm, and impatient as he had felt the moment before at the reckless disregard of discovery which had seemed to hurry her into the very pres- ence of familiar faces, now that the moment had come, he shrank from the words, which after all   AGNES STANHOPE.       867 might only give pain without the power of persuad- ing, or which, if now tardily accepted, might after all be too late. He knew De Lacy well. He had on need, unlike Bertha, to be told of his entire igno- rance of this fatal secret, and he thought with some anxiety over the consequences of its late revelation. They found the refreshment-room nearly deserted of the groups which had been pouring into it for the last half-hour, but who were now returning to the renewed dance or promenading through the pleasant grounds. Colonel Maitland led his companion to the lower part of the glittering board, which chanced to be quite vacant, and where the conversation he was about to open could take place, to all appear- ances, unnoticed. Agnes declined by a gesture the proffered wine and fruit, but drained eagerly the glass of ice water which he silently poured out. It seemed to cool the fever in her veins, and to calm a little the excitement which his presence, with all the grateful and tender recollections it bore, had aroused, Here was the moment she had longed for, year after year, in a distant land, the hour when she should meet him face to face, and her trembling lips should thank him, and speak her consciousness of her great debt. Did he read her thoughts in her flushing and downcast face, that he hesitated to break the silence, and suffered thq golden seconds to slip idly away.  &#xD;<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7555-00000184"/> 368      AGNES STANHOPE.' "Colonel Maitland, suffer me at last to express the gratitude which has been on my heart these many years, which has found utterance only in my prayers. When we parted last I was too heart-sick and bewildered to realize your great hazard or your noble generosity." "I need no thanks, dear Agnes, yet gladly would I claim them, if they could add a feather's weight to what I am about to say." Her ddwncast eyes showed that she understood his meaning. She moved with a deprecatory ges- ture as if to entreat his forbearance. "I cannot," he said, lowering his voice, " see you rushing thus blindly into ruin. Time and circum- stances have changed you, I admit, but they have neither entirely obliterated your face, or the recol- lection of your story. London is, for you, of all places the most dangerous. If you persist in re- maining here your detection is sure." "I have no choice," murmured Agnes, repeating unconsciously, her answer to Bertha..+ "You must trust De Lacy with your secret. You must do so for his own sake." "I cannot." "Listen to me, my poor child. You need not fear to trust him. He is noble, generous. Surely, you who know him better even than I, know thiis." "It should have been told before," said Agnes,   AGNES STANHOPE.       369 faintly. "Now it is too late. He will forgive, but how can lie forget?" Col. Maitland was silent. What reply could he make? "I have been looking forward week after week," resumed Agnes, "to our journey. to Devonshire. Once in its shelter, nothing will tempt me again into these dangers." "You must use your influence more earnestly to hurry forward this step," said Colonel Maitland, re- luctantly waiving the point. I fear you do not real- ize all your danger. I grieve to alarm you, but, for your sake, to-night, I have shrank from every new face in these crowded rooms. There is one here who knows you well, though you may have escaped his eye for the time." "You refer to Judge Rathburn."   Her voice sunk to a whisper. "I do. I fear his suspicions are already awaken- ing. I fear also that you are deceiving yourself in this respect. It would be vain to hope for this man's pity. He would not spare the wife of his dearest friend." A movement took place near them; the entrance of a new couple; and, Colonel Maitland, feeling that their prolonged conversation might attract attention, as well as their protracted absence, led her back to the ball-room. They soon discovered De Lacy, in 17  &#xD;<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7555-00000185"/> 370      AGNES STANHOPE. the now lessening throng, for the dance had broken up, but Agnes, in her second glance, recognized Judge Rathburn as his companion. The discovery gave her no little uneasiness, and she gladly joined Bertha, whom she saw at some little distance, in the obscurity cast by the shadow of one of the heavy crimson curtains which draped the low windows. They were quite alone for the moment. Bertha threw a hurried glance at her sister's face. There was nothing in the look which encouraged her. She had no time for words, however, for almost immedi- ately Judge Rathburn separated from De Lacy, and the latter joined them. He noticed at once his wife's paleness and depression, and imputing them to fatigue, kindly proposed their return home. Ag- nes eagerly accepted the offer, and he went to order the carriage. What a tumult of troubled thoughts agitated her on her way home. Was this the interview with Bertha to which she had looked forward with so much impatience? It had only deepened her dis- tress and anxiety, without throwing a ray of comfort on the darkness which surrounded her. The coun- sel of both these true friends - kind and best as it was- if she could but follow it. Alas! that dis- closure should have been made years before, on her betrothal day--never, never now. As she had said, De Lacy might forgive but he could never for- Of   AGNES STANHOPE.       371 get. She thought of his proud name, and how she had stolen into that noble line, sullied with the taint of a felon; exposed at any hour to the denounce- ment which must give her over to an ignominious death. No, tender and true as was the heart which throbbed at her side, this was an error never to be cancelled, save in that higher world where the guarded thought, the impulse, the struggle and the temptation, are laid bare. There he would see all, and pity her; -there he would see the haunted nights, the accusing days, the path of terror she was treading for his sake, and this one dark concealment would be blotted out. Yes; she would tell him there, but not here. We pass on for a moment to Bertha's dress- ing-room, an hour later, where we find her in her evening wrapper, her ball robes thrown aside, and her maid sent out, too troubled and disquieted to seek her pillow. "If she could only see her danger, if she could only realize it, Philip." "Believe me, she does. She needs nothing more that we can say. Agnes is no longer a child, Ber- tha; she is a woman, who must work out her prob- lem of life for herself, cruel as are the circumstances which surround her." "Ah, I   cannot think so. I cannot feel so. If  &#xD;<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7555-00000186"/> 372      AGNES STANHOPE. De Lacy only knew all. She is too timid, too fear- ful. Better for him to hear it now, even from a friend, since she persists in refusing." Colonel Maitland shook his head. "I know something of De Lacy, Bertha, which you do not. With all his noble character, like the best of us, he has his faults. He is a proud man, and I cannot say how this would strike him. It is true we neither of us know how this marriage has come about. If we knew we might see much to extenuate her fault, but nothing I think to entirely excuse it. He would for- give outwardly at least, and, for his sake as well as her own, remove her to a place of security, even by an immediate return to the continent, but it might break up for the future their domestic tranquility." Bertha was silent. "O, Agnes," she said at last, "is this to be ever the one fault of your life-weak, always weak!" "We will have charity, Bertha," said Colonel Maitland, gently. "Think of the magnitude of the temptation, lonely, friendless, and how generously this love and home may have been urged upon her. You would have spoken, my love, but not ten in a hundred would do so." "Alas, and such a concealment practised towards an honorable man. With what pride I should have received him as her husband years ago. Why, in the providence of God, could they not have met be- fore.'   AGNES STANHOPE.       373 I   "That is not for us yet to know, my love, or why i    such a sorrowful path is appointed to our poor IAgnes." "If that terrible mystery could be lifted," said Bertha, "if the strange circumstances of Howard's death could be made clear, but I have long ceased to hope for that day. I believe he perished by the jealousy or revenge of one of his boon companions- unfortunate man! and there it rests in eternal night." Colonel Maitland was silento He had never for- gotten that his own tardy assistance might have opened to his nephew a far different path. He sighed heavily. "I wish it were in my power to move to some purpose in this matter," he said, -" but I see no opening. It is from his wife's lips that De Lacy must listen to this story. My interference might bring down evils hardly inferior, in her eyes at least, to those we dread.' O  &#xD;<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7555-00000187"/> CHAPTER XXVII. "To-morrow, Agnes, we shall set out for Devon-  shire."    -  It was the second morning following thefete we have recorded, and they were lingering over the breakfast table, in the pleasant room to which we have before introduced the reader, the glancing cana- ries, from their cages in the window, sending forth a gush of music in the warm April sunshine. "To-morrow." Agnes looked up with the inex- pressible relief which this announcement afforded, beaming in her eyes and voice.  De Lacy's smile answered back hers. "Yes, but I am sorry to chill your delight by the addition that our stay at present cannot be protracted beyond a  few days. These tedious law matters still drag on  I fear they will not be brought to a conclusion before the sultry midsummer." Agnes' eyes fell. "And we must remain in Lon- don through all this long interval?" "Possibly. But we will not borrow anxieties I have noticed your paling cheek and languid eyes, Agnes, for the last few weeks. They have told me   AGNES STANHOPE.       375 very plainly, the necessity of a change. A few days among the hills of Devonshire, its sweet country air, and quietdrives, will wonderfully revive you. Your nerves are too delicately strung for these late hours and hot rooms." She was silent and thoughtful. A few days, a week even, afforded a respite not to be rejected. Once in Devonshire what fortunate chance might not offer to prolong their stay. De Lacy quitted her for his usual morning business with his lawyer, and she went about her preparations at once, few as they were, with a lightened heart. The day passed with its usual incidents of morning calls, company to dine, and the quiet, closing evening with De Lacy. She retired to her chamber with a feverish rest- lessness upon her spirits. A heavy oppression weighed upon her, an unutterable foreboding. She tried to gather courage by remembering how won- derfully her path had led through all the gloom of its strange vicissitudes, and that the same over- watching care encircled the future. Her maid came in at last, wearied of waiting her mistress' tardy summons, and she retired to her pillow. The gray dusk of the twilight was falling when the carriage drew up at the old ancestral home of De Lacy.  Agnes leaned forward with almost the  &#xD;<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC7555-00000188"/> 376      AGNES STANHOPE. eagerness of a child to catch the first glimpse of its brown walls through the thick foliage of the park, the magnificent park sloping down towards them, up whose broad avenue the carriage was now slowly bowling. A stately old-fashioned country house, its grey turrets dating back centuries, while its more modern wings bore witness in their fine architecture to no later date than the Elizabethian era. The car- riage bowled slowly up, it had passed the entrance, and Agnes saw in the gray twilight the group which was gathered to receive them. The white haired steward, his hat raised and held tremulously'in his hand, as the carriage stopped, the old housekeeper, smiles and tears struggling upon her wrinkled visage, and a throng of rough faces, beaming with gladness. De Lacy sprang lightly out, and took her hand to as- sist her to descend. The servants crowded around him, and with their eager greetings to their master came murmurs of ' long life and happiness toour Lady." But Agnes saw, even in the agitation of the moment, as she courtesied to their welcome, that the first brightness had faded from De Lacy's smile, while he still answered and greeted the little throng around him by their names, and that the same shadow had come over them, stilling into an almost reverential hush the tumult of their eager voices. She had little time for thought, for De Lacy hurried her in from the chill falling dews, and led her through the old   AGNES STANHOPE.       3" hall into the spacious dining-room. Here an ample repast had been already spread by the care of the at- tentive housekeeper, who followed and stood by to receive the pelisse and bonnet of which Agnes now suffered her maid to divest her. "It's a happy day for my old eyes to see," said the good woman, addressing De Lacy, who stood leaning against the mantel, gazing thoughtfully down on the glowing yule coals which sparkled in the open hearth, a cheery fire made comfortable by the chilly April evening. "I much feared, Master Ralph, you would- never make your choice--and a fair English countrywoman, too, long as you've stayed abroad. Would my dear lady could have lived to see this day."  She is happier for it in Heaven, Mrs. Hawley," said De Lacy, turning round toward her. "It is indeed a happy day which sees me welcomed back to Devonshire and Old England for all the years to come." They took their places at the board. Agnes, wearied with her journey and the thoughts pressing upon her, which somehow the few words to which she had just listened had painfully revived, found it impossible to do justice to the daintily prepared viands. De Lacy, too, though he struggled to throw it off, was plainly depressed and, sad. She was glad when th3 meal was over, and De Lacy, noticing her 17*  &#xD;<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7555-00000189"/> 378      AGNES STANHOPE. fatigue, rang the bell, to recall the housekeeper to show her to her chamber and summon her maid. She was glad to be left alone and to seek her pil- low, where sleep at last closed her heavy eyes. The morning dawned bright and clear. A stray sunbeam falling over her pillow woke Agnes from her repose. For a moment she thought herself still in London, and tried to follow the phantasies of the troubled dream it had broken, but recollection re- turned, and she sprang up with a lightened heart; freed, for to-day at least, from the tremulous anxieties of the past weeks. She hardly knew how heavy had been the load till it was lifted. No shrinking now from the glad, warm sunshine, no nervous tremor at the tread of a servant, no faint dying away of her heart at the echo of the bell, and no furtive watch- ing of too familiar faces, or shrinking from new coun- tenances. She made her toilet without calling in the assist- ance of her maid, and groped her way down to the hall. A flood of light was pouring in through the open door, and she lingered a moment to watch the beautifully enamelled grass on the lawn, and the glistening hedges, already fragrant with opening buds of pearly hawthorns, beyond. De Lacy joined her. He noticed with pleasure the animation of her greeting and the glow which had taken the place of the past night's fatigue. "I see, Agnes, the air of   AGNES STANHOPE.       379 Devonshire has already begun to work wonders." They lingered for a few moments in the hall, and then went on to the dining-room. DeLacy's eye followed that of Agnes to the tastefully arranged vases of early violets on the side-table, and the heavy parted curtains, which let in a cheerful flood of light and sunshine through the broad windows. Both felt the love and thoughtfulness which pervaded every heart, from the trusted steward to the humblest housemaid, in thi3 new home; new to the one for the first time welcomed as its mistress, and to the other from the strangeness of years of absence. They lingered long over the pleasant meal, dispos- ing at its close of their plans for the day. The dif- ferent apartments of the large old manor house were first to be visited; the lumbering old rooms filled with the associations of the by-gone centuries; the more modern wing, hallowed to De Lacy with the tide of tender recollections, and the long picture gal- lery, in the western end, hung with the portraits of his ancestry. Here a little business with his steward, and a letter to go out to London by the evening post, would intervene to lunch, after which a drive, tete-a-tete, and if a sufficient interval should remain to the late dinner they would visit a few of the adja- cent cottages of his tenantry. "A full programme to be crowded into a few hours." So De Lacy said as they rose at last from  &#xD;<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC7555-00000190"/> 380      AGNES STANHOPE. the table, and after a brief loitering in the hall began their researches. A long hour was consumed in these lonely and close-shut rooms, whose cumberous furniture bore the undisturbed dust of years, and glistened here and there in the opening shutters with a-dark line of misty webs, and quitting them at last, they turned their steps to the opposite wing. De Lacy unclosed a door at the side of the hall they now entered, pausing reverently on the threshold, and Agnes pressed forward to gaze with strange in- terest on the vacant chair and the white spread toilet table, whose little articles of use lay scattered around with a careless grace, as if they had just fallen from the hand of their fair owner. She needed not to be told whose gentle presence had hallowed these apart- ments, and her eyes suffused with tears as they came back to the ring which glistened upon her finger. They lingered here for several moments, and then De Lacy drew her away to an apartment a few steps beyond, whose opening door disclosed an artist's studio, with a half-finished painting on the easel. It was an Italian iscene, and Agnes stood enraptured by the dim outlines of beauty which had grown up in the weary confinement of a sick room under those wasting fingers. Years had passed, long, long years; they had seen that little household broken; they had seen it entered by a sorrow heavier thin can be wrought by the cold chill of death -but this Agnes   AGNES STANHOPE.       381 knew not then; they had seen the storms and bloom of many a season sweep over his narrow resting- place; they had seen his boy brother taking upon himself the cares and sorrows of manhood, and the pride and station of his house; but here this last work stood, as on the day when he laid aside his palate and pencil for the fevered couch and the ten- der ministries of aching hearts. O, if we needed anything more than the hundred tokens that shine up in our daily path to speak to us of Immortality, it is such a life cut off in its bloom and freshness, glowing with its grand purposes, and reaching out in love to all its kind. Agnes lingered long over the painting, the rare engraving, and richly bound volumes, long laid aside, and then went sorrowfully on to the portrait gallery, the last room to be visited, to which a broad staircase led in the western end. It was a long, high apartment, lighted by broad windows, through which a full light poured on the rich array of faces, rich as in life with tint and coloring, many of them the productions of a long passed age. Here were the steel-clad warriors of the house of De Lacy, grim and stern in their gray armour, placed side by side with the gentler robed females of their line. All had passed on, one by one, in mournful array, to the bourne from which there is no'returning, to the frui tion of the life as new to the last traveller from earth  &#xD;<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7555-00000191"/> 382      AGNES STANZHOPE. as to him who in the far dawn of creation passed ti    into its shadows. Agnes gazed sorrowfully on the faces which had long disappeared from the list of the living. She wondered what griefs and joys had crowded into their busy day. Each face had a his- tory, each countenance upon. the canvas beamed with the hopes, the longings, the aspirations, and cares of its restless sphere. One or two, indeed, there were who wore that serene peace which puts the shadows of the world behind, and sees the dawn of Heaven flooding the distance before ; but through what dark paths might not these serene faces have pressed on to the house not made with hands. She moved on, and stood before the more modern paint- Ings, associated with fresher interest. The dark, pleasant eyes of De Lacy looked down upon her from the wall, in- the glow and freshness of his youth, and she-turned to the fair, sunny face beyond. The clear blue eyes, the shiny, golden tresses, the full -!    brow, the smiling coral mouth, but even as she gaz- ed with that reverential awe which the image of one long sacred to us in the chamber of the heart in- spires, she could but feel the shadow which seemed suddenly to settle over this sunny beauty, to lurk in the clear eye, and around the closed lips. The por- trait had:been drawn when Mrs. De Lacy was a blooming bride, hardly past the blush of her rosy girlhood. What sorrow could she have known then? By   AGNES STANHOPE.       3[3 Was it the foreboding of the future, the fair boy dy- ing in his bloom, such a sorrow as comes to many another mother's stricken heart. She looked on the fair Arthur, the boy whose strange beauty bore the warning of an early doom; and then her eyes turn- ed on the father, lingering there with a strange, sor- rowful wonder, as she read in those grave lineaments the stern, proud spirit which seemed to mate ill with so gentle a bride. There was another portrait not far from these, but over it a veil was drawn, and as she turned to meet her husband's face, something in its gloomy look checked the question on her lips. She remembered how to him all these desolate rooms -must be haunted with the echo of dear voices and familliar steps, and her hand stole into his with the eager sympathy which filled her eyes, and changed the color in her cheek. He- held it tightly for a moment, but whatever the emotion which had stirred him, he made an effort to recover. Both uncon- sciously raised their eyes to the window. The sun had reached its broad meridian, and was slowly slanting to the west. K "It is past the hour I promised to see Richards, Agnes. He is waiting me in the hall. I am sorry to quit you. I hardly know how the hours have stolen away." He looked at his watch, and turned to go out. "You will find me here when your letter is finish-  &#xD;<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC7555-00000192"/> 384    i  AGNES STANHOPE. ed," said Agnes. "I am sorry to have kept you so long. But lunch for once can be delayed." *She turned again to the portraits as the door clos- ed behind him. The mild, fair countenance of Mrs. De Lacy seemed to rivet her thoughts. She felt a, strange impulse stirring her busy heart to lift the veil of that past so long ago lended, to see the girl- hood which had thrown so mournful a shadow to her eyes, quickened in their sight by the wisdom of her own bitter lore, and to retrace the secrets of that long wedded life of which she knew nothing other than it had been honored and happy, as a tenderly- respected wife, and an almost idolised mother. Another yearning, strong and bitter, came sweep- ing over her. O that the dark charge which hung so cruelly over herself could be cleared from her name. What would this proud line of ancestry say to her? What even the beautiful and noble woman whose tender face stirred her heart to its in- most depths. She had dared to creep into their house tarnishing their fair escutcheon with the story of her guilt and shame. "Time has neither obliterated your face, or the recollection of your story." O! Colonel Maitland, was that warning needed. Did she not feel it every day? And O! most of all here in this noble com- pany, whose faces seemed to frown upon her from the cold canvas; she who, under a false name, and Ile   AGNES STANHOPE.       385 the darkest of dark concealments, had stolen in their ranks. She tried to forget, to turn away from the re- collections which haunted her, and her eyes again sought the veiled portrait, with a dawning curiosity Why was it so carefully shrouded? and what rela- tion had it borne to those with whom it hung? Was it for wrong or shame? She would ask De Lacy. No'; the last thought stayed her. She drew nearer and laid her hand upon the deep mourning guaze which covered it. An instant of irresolution, and she drew it gently aside. The face which flashed upon her caused her to start back a step, and the veil swept partially over it again from her trembling grasp. Her color left her; her eyes were riveted in a steady, startled gaze. Grief, repugnance, sorrow -she had no need of second thought to recall those familiar outlines. Could it be possible that Helen De Lacy and Mrs. Percival were one. She looked back to De Lacy's portrait. There were the same dark eyes, the same glossy bands of raven hair, the same features, softened in hers to womanly beauty; in his the expression was higher, and more marked, but she saw that at this period of their life brother and sister must have borne a striking resemblance. Changed, changed, as Helen De Lacy was by sin, and shame, and sorrow, in the long interval from the day in which she sat for this likeness to the hour in  &#xD;<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7555-00000193"/> 386      AGNES STANHOPE. which her path had crossed hers, there was the ol beauty, the old loveliness and grace, with whic] she had been so sadly dowered, she was Helen DI Lacy still. A crowd of recollections seemed to flash out ofth past, and Agnes wondered she had been blind s long. She understood now the emotion which th first sight of De Lacy had awakened, the inde finable distrast and aversion, quickly melted awa. before the charm of their daily intercourse. She re called the broken words which had escaped him i restless dreams, when she lay waking with her ow troubled thoughts, and she wondered that strange a they had seemed to her ear the truth had neve dawned upon her. They showed, too, as she pondere over them more, that though the freshness of thi great sorrow was gone, it was still unforgotten. How strange that Lawrence should have acted so eventfi a part in the short history of both their lives, an that through these stormy seas of trial the wonderfi purposes of God should have brought them togethe: O that He in His mercy would suffer her to cloth with bloom and gladness the path which had been E rugged, to be still in the far reaching future whi her husband's grateful lips had already told her, th joy and sunshine of his heart. Would her prayer t heard and granted? Ah, who should say. The light sound of the opening door caught h I iA   AGNES STANHOPE.       387 ear in the stillness. She looked dpto see the old housekeeper pausing on the threshold. "I beg your pardon, my Lady," she said, in some confusion, as Agnes' glance met hers. "I thought you were gone out.", "4 Come in, Mrs. Hawley," said Agnes, kindly. "I should be glad to speak with you for a few mo- ments. Mr. De Lacy is engaged with his steward, and I am quite alone." The old woman obeyed hesitatingly. Her eyes fell on the portrait. She started. ;' You have been looking on Miss Helen, my Lady. It's years since that name was breathed here, alas!" "I have heard something of her sad story," said Agnes, slowly replacing the veil over the picture, "but it seems like an unreal dream now that I stand in her home, and here among these faces. How could it all have come about?" "It's a long story," said Mrs. Hawley, "but I'll tell you in a few words, my Lady, if you'd like to hear." Agnes signified her eager willingness, and motion- ing her to one of the heavy oaken chairs arranged opposite the broad windows, took -a seat near her while she began. "I had been in my Lady's service twenty years, twenty long years. I was her housekeeper when I Miss Helen was born, their first child; what a re-  &#xD;<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7555-00000194"/> 388 ;;    AGNES STANHOPE.  joicing there was, and how little any of us dreamed i    what she would live to come to I Ah, me, those were happy days, the like of which can never come again. Why couldn't she have been taken ther when she was a little sinless babe instead of living tc grow up to break both her kind parents' hearts Well, other children came, a son and heir, Arthur, and then Ralph, but I think the mother's and father' heart both clung around their little girl, proud at they were of their fine boys. She was a sweet, win- some creature; I see her now in her pretty, whiti frocks, with her dark, shining eyes, and gentle, mod. est ways. Everybody loved her, from the servants hall to the visitors, who noticed and petted her, for Mr. De Lacy kept open house, in the true old Eng- lish ways, and most always had a throng of guests tHe was a stern, proud man, my master, but verJ kind in his family, and very indulgent to my lady He hated to have her slightest whim crossed, and though I've heard it whispered that it was'nt quit( a love match on her side, she couldn't but feel sBucl kindness. So Miss Helen grew up, and came to be a woman, not old enough to come out, as they cal it, but a fair, charming girl, such a face as you say up here in this portrait-it was- taken 'about thi time; such a one as you don't often see. Ah, it wa  i    her undoing, poor thing--how true it is we don' know what is best for us. She was a little 'gay, per   AGNES STANHOPE.       r889 haps a little imperious, but nothing mgre than might be expected of a young creature so petted and ad- mired, and nothing about her that wouldn't have come out well and right if that fiend hadn't crossed her path. About this time she went to London on a visit --that was the beginning of the trouble. As I've said before, she wasn't yet old enough to come out, but she saw much company at her cousin's, I : many gentlemen and ladies, and among them Mr. Lawrence. He had just got through with a fne property, and lived on the gaming-table, and I don't know how, but he was of an old family, and had a fine addrdss, and nobody seemed to inow it. I've wondered since how my lady could trust her daugh- ter to Mrs. Halstead, and Miss Helen so young and thoughtless, but she begged so hard for her, and Miss Helen was so eager to go. My' lady never liked to cross her, and as I said before, my master was always loth to interfere with my lady's whims. -She was called back very suddenly before her visit quite got to an end, after she had been there barely three weeks. It was Master Arthur's last sickness. He lingered along some time after she got home, but now he had to keep his bed entirely. O0 my lady, that was a great grief, but nothing like what was to come after it. Mr. Lawrence came down kere very soon after the funeral was over. It was in the fall, and he was stopping at a place close by, with the  &#xD;<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC7555-00000195"/> 390      AGNES STANHOPE. Stanwoods, a -gentleman my master would hardly have kept neighborhood with if my lady hadn't been so fond of his wife, an old friend of her girlhood. He came down here on purpose to see Miss Helen, no doubt. My lady was so wrapped up in her grief she didn't for a long time see how things were going on, but my master saw first. He questioned his daughter, and found she had given her promise to Mr. Lawrance, and they only waited a proper time to ask his consent. I don't think anything could have astonished him more, or made him more angry to see how far affairs had gone on. Mr. Lawrence had come there with the Stanwoods, had been in- vited with them to formal dinners, and once or twice had stopped over night at the manor, when a storm came up, which made a good excuse for taking a bed. But he never dreamed of him as a son-in-law; in fact, he never liked him, with all his graces, and so he came easily to believe, what he soon found out, that he was a gambler, and a very heartless man. Miss Helen wouldn't hear a word of it; poor thing, she was fairly blinded; the matter had gone on too long. She said it was want of property, and because he was a private gentleman, and hadn't a title --so I've no doubt he told her, and so she believed. She seemed to let the matter drop finally, but they kept up an interchange of letters, and stolen meetings when they could. My master   AGNES STANHOPE.       391 found it out at last. I think Mr. Lawrence's coming down so often from London, when he had no osten- sible business-sometimes never going near the Stanwoods -reached his ear and made him sus- picious. He intercepted-Mr. Lawrence at last, or met him rather by accident, in a lonely spot in the park, at a time when he must have been less guarded than usual in his approaches. There were high words between them. My master told him plainly that he would never bestow on him his daughter; that he would turn a Catholic first, and send her to a convent. He told him he was a gambler anrid a coward, a man devoid of a spark of principle or honor, which last he showed by seeking these clan- destine meetings. I think Mr. Lawrence said little in reply, but he kept his temper and brooded over it the more. When my master got over his anger a little he was sorely grieved on Miss Helen's account. He had lost all confidence in her, and nothing my poor lady could say would soften her fault. She was very young, after all, and had never been much in general society, and Mr. Lawrence was handsome and very agreeable, and had a knowledge of the world which she was far from possessing-and think what opportunities he had had for a long time, besides, to gain her ear. My master would hear nothing she had to say for herself, if indeed she could have said anything, but ordered her to her  &#xD;<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC7555-00000196"/> 392      AGNES STANHOPE. chamber, and forbade my lady to go to her. Those were sad, sad days, but not like those that were yet to-come. My master was sterner than ever. He could not brook the sight of my lady's pale face and her tears. She blamed herself, thinking she had been too much swallowed up in her grief over Mas- ter Arthur, and had left Miss Helen too much alone; and, that the old place, dull to such a gay, spirited young girl, had grown drearier still. She knew, too, how such a sorrow disposes the heart to listen to a new love, and Miss Helen had not yet got over grieving for her brother's death. But my master would hear nothing; he had his own way for once, and very ill it proved. Mr. Lawrence's silence that day when my master's high talk took place, wasn't for nothing. No doubt he brooded over it, and planned what should follow. .I don't know how he contrived to write to Miss Helen. I know all the servants loved their master, and would have given their right hand first, any one of them, than have helped him; but he did contrive to get a letter to her, telling her how he had been treated, but making light of it in his sympathy for her, and begging an elopement. The letter was found in her room after she was gone. I've said before, she was a proud, high-spirited creature. She knew she had done wrong, and she thought it had turned all our hearts against her. Her mother kept away from her, but ,    AGNES STANHOPE.       393 she didn't know that it was by her father's will, and tha tshe would gladly have come to her. She grew to think nobody cared for her but this man, and she wouldn't believe he .was bad, or there was any fault in him. It was a bleak, stormy night-I never shall forget it to my dying day, and it's long years since, too. How the storm swept round; it bore down one of the finest trees in the park, and it whistled round the old turrets as if they would tot- ter to their fall. It kept everybody waking through the long, long hours. Ah, me, that was the black- est night the old line of De Lacy ever knew. In the morning Miss Helen was gone." There was a little pause; the faces of both the listener and the speaker were pale and averted, as if that awful night had just passed; and then the old housekeeper went on: "My lady never held up her head again. I think she never smiled afterwards. It was her death- stroke. They went abroad at once. It wouldn't have been safe for Mr. Lawrence in England, and he knew it very well. Master Ralph, boy as he was, swore he would have his black heart's blood; and though my master stood by and said nothing, his set eye and tightly pressed mouth showed what he felt. There were enough to carry the message, if it had been needed, for the Stanwoods,.father and son,'had come to mymaster in his trouble; it wasn't much 18  &#xD;<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7555-00000197"/> 394       AGNES STANHOPE. they could say, to be sure, but they were grieved that they had sheltered such a villain under their roof, and blamed themselves for the innocent part they had taken in the matter. Poor Miss Helen, she never; never dreamed of what she was going to, that wild, stormy night; never thought how her rAsh trust could be betrayed; but my master knew the man, and had no better hope from the beginning than what. it had turned out. My Lady drooped and drooped away. It was in the dreary November when the close of all this came round, and it wanted a week to the opening of April when she was laid in her coffin. The doctor called it consumption. It was a swift, painless decline, much like Master Ar- thur's, but I know she died of a broken heart. She never asked my master to forgive their daughter- she knew it wouldn't be of any use. I don't think her name ever escaped her lips after that fatal night, but when she came to the close, I think she forgave her in her heart, and longed to send her blessing, hoping it might reclaim her. But it couldn't be. My master took my lady's death very calmly. It was as if the worst thing that could happen to him had ta- ken place, and there was nothing that could come afterwards. He was very kind to her in her sick- ness, but she seemed to shrink from him at first; he saw it, and left off coming to her room for some days, and then she sent for him, and seemed to try    AGNES STANHOPE.       395 to forget. She was a gentle, patient woman, my la- dy; I used to sometimes think she must have had her trials before she married my master, or she never could have been so sweet and gentle to everybody about her. She was a De Lacy, too-my master's cousin; and she had no fortune to bring him. It was a love-match, on his side at least, though I be- lieve there was some talk of their being betrothed by their parents when they were little children. Per- haps, after all, he felt her death more than his pride would let him show, for he too fell into a decline, with all his trouble, and followed her in little more than a year. Master Ralph lingered here for awhile, and at last went abroad, so the old family was bro- ken up." Both were silent. Mrs. Hawley was the first to recover from the emotion which this sad history had mutually excited. "It is a sorry welcome for you, my Lady, on your first morning. But it's long, very long, since I've talked over these old times. I've sorrowed for Mas- ter Ralph, many and many's the hour, and the glad- est day I've known since poor Master Arthur died was when Master Ralph wrote from that foreign named place that he'd found his choice at last, and a fair English bride, too. You don't know, my Lady, what joy it gave us all, and how glad the tenants were, most of them born and grown on the estate,  &#xD;<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC7555-00000198"/> 396 -----   AGNES STANHOPE. and their fathers before them, that the day would come when their master would come home, after all his wanderings, come home a gladdened and cheered man, and build up a new family again at the old ma- nor. I felt troubled and anxious like when I waited for him last night, but the first glance at you light- ened my heart. I never thought I could have loved any face so well in my dear lady's place. I much feared Master Ralph might have brought us some high spirited lady, who couldn't endure this quiet old place, and must go back to London, but I saw as he lifted-you out of the carriage that it wasn't the glamor of first sighted love which had blinded his eyes, but he had taken wisdom in his choice, as in everything else. I saw, too, how you looked at him when he was sad, and how quick you felt the shad- ow that came over his face, and I knew the love wasn't all on his side." Agnes was still pale. She was thinking with a wild, troubled feeling, of the one terror suspended over her life o O, to be sure of all this future, the time, the life, to make herself worthy of it. Her thoughts had turned from poor Helen De Lacy, her unfortunate sister-in-law, to cling around the man whose life had been blighted by such sorrows, her husband; to ask herself if from her own hand, her who loved him more than all the world, was to come another, a last, crowning grief. No, no; God was too merciful!   AGNES STANHOPE.       897 There were footsteps in the hall; the door opened. De Lacy had closed his letter, and had returned to take her down to the long delayed lunch. His quick glance at Mrs. Hawley, with the agitation visible on the faces of both, showed- him the subject of their conversation, but he said nothing beyond a few pleasant words to the old housekeeper, and offered his arm to his wife. He was more cheerful than he- had been since their arrival, and Agnes roused her spirits to respond to his tone. They had their quiet drive in the close of the April afternoon, and on their way back stopped at one of the cluster of cot- tages to the left of the park. The mistress, a buxom, rosy-cheeked dame, came to the door to receive them with many courtesies, and led the way to the little room which constituted, in one, kitchen and parlor. The old grandmother oc- cupied her place in the corner, busily plying her reel, and two or three white-headed children were play- ing about the floor. The old dame suspended her reel, and the children grouped with a shy air around her, holding by her dress while they examined the visitors. Agnes soon succeeded in quieting their fears, and persuading them to come to her, while De Lacy entered into conversation with both the cot- tagers, the elder of whom he had left a thriving matron, and returned to find a lonely widow, bereft of all but this one daughter, and the daughter a  &#xD;<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC7555-00000199"/> *     398     AGNES STANHOPE. blooming lass, now a wife and mother, supporting the decrepit old age of her only remaining parent. The sturdy farmer soon came home from the fields and greeted his landlord with hearty respect and cordiality. The twilight was now falling, and De Lacy soon rose to leave. They rode thoughtfully up the park, and Agnes, on alighting at the hall, hur- ried up to her dressing-room to make her toilet for dinner. The long, quiet evening found them together in the drawing-room; Agnes seated at the piano, but too busy with her restless thoughts to bring out more than a low, musical prelude from the ivory keys. She turned suddenly to meet De Lacy's dark eyes bent thoughtfully upon her. "I have been thinking," she began, " of our visit to the cottage to-day, and how I would like to ben- efit those poor children in some way. They are growing up so ignorant. Is there a school on the estate?" "There was," said De Lacy. "It was founded by my mother, and liberally provided for by her. I am sorry to find it has gone down in my absence. The teacher married, and the lady Mr. Markham recommended, seems to have been unsuited to her employment." "We must build it up anew," said Agnes. "It will be a pleasant labor to overlook it, I shall have so much time here."   AGNES STANHOPE.       899 "I will write to a gentleman in Shropshire, Mr. Radcliffe, in the morning," said De Lacy. "He will direct us to some one for the vacant place." "The girls must learn housekeeping, as well as the boys writing and arithmetic," said Agnes ; "but for that they must come to the manor. We must have prizes in the school to encourage improvement in the beginning, too." De Lacy laughed. "You will be a Lady Boun- tiful, Agnes." But his smile beamed with the pleas- ure which warmed his heart. So years ago he had sat on a footstool at his mother's knee, listening while she talked to his father over these self-same plans, subject as they were now to the more durable im- provements of a later day. They seemed to bring up that long vanished past, but for once without the alloy of pain. "To-morrow we shall have an influx of visitors, Agnes, the gentry of the neighborhood, to pay their respects on our return. Did I tell you Leslie's coun- try-seat is close by us? We passed it on bur-way here, only a few miles to the right. I wonder I for- got to point it out to you, but I was so absorbed in my own reflections on coming home." "What was his former name?"  I don't know how the question came out so quietly from Agnes' lips, but De Lacy seemed to find some difficulty in replying, "Stanwood."  &#xD;<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7555-00000200"/> 400      AGNES STANHOPE. Her thoughts flew back. She remembered in a moment the dinner party in London, those dark, dark days; Maitland, flushed and heated with the wine-cup; Major Oakley's intoxicated familiarity; Lawrence's cold, glittering sympathy, which masked the worst heart of the three. She knew now where they had met. "Do you think he will really reform? Do you think there is any good in him?" De Lacy looked at her, surprised at her sudden manner. "I hope so, Agnes; I hope so for his true mother's sake. I sometimes think there are those in Heaven who, once with us here, watch over us, and are permitted to help us out of temptations. His coming into this property gives him a start to reform. If he will use it to make a good match--" "What a risk," said Agnes; "what a hazard." "Yes; I should not wish a sister of mine"-he stopped, and changed color--"but there are plenty who will take both the risk and the hazard." i  It   CHAPTER XXVIII. We leave Agnes gaining strength and peace in the quiet rest of Devonshire to go back to that Lon- don which looms up a dismal shadow on these tran- quil days. It is a period some two months prior to the date at which our narrative has arrived. The white snows of winter still lay over the narrow streets, and the fields of the open country beyond are one untrodden mass of dazzling wreaths. It is the second day of the storm, the second- day which followed Agnes De Lacy's well remembered ball. There is the clamor of merry bells upon the street, and a throng of weary pedestrians hurrying to their homes. Before a stately mansion in the outskirts of the city, furnished with marble steps and bearing an imposing front, Judge Rathburn's cutter was wait- ing, where it had been standing the last two hours, the old servant throwing restless glances at the still closed door, and breathing an impatient sigh as he drew his heavy cloak mdre closely around hih, at his master's lengthened delay. Within, Judge Rath- burn, his business closed, stood upon the hearth, draining the second gla s of wine which his host 18*  &#xD;<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC7555-00000201"/> ,.    402      AGNES STANHOPE. pressed upon him, before buttoning up his overcoat to face again the pitiless storm. "I am sorry to have kept your honor at all back in this business, but I was down to Devonshire last week, and by some unlucky chance your note failed to reach me." cTo Devonshire? Ah, indeed. It is more than twenty years since I was there, Mr. Mathewson; time for great changes." "Great indeed I You remember the old De Lacy family? The country's alive there with the news of the heir's coming back. It has been sadly broken up, that old house; but no doubt you have heard the story."  I have heard nothing," said Judge Rathburn, quietly. "It is twenty years, as I told you, since I was in Devonshire, and we lawyers, who lead such a life as mine has been, hear very little out of the courts." "That is strange. It was in everybody's mouth a dozen years ago--Miss Helen's elopement, and Mrs. De Lacy's dying of a broken heart." The Judge moved a little uneasily. The subject was to him evidently fraught with some interest. "It was a sad affair," his loquacious entertainer went on; " a very sad affair. I don't remember the equal of it in all my line of observation; such an old family, too, which made it worse. To be sure,   AGNES STANHOPE.       403 the other party was of fair birth, too, and if he had married her, though he was dissipated and worthless, it would not have been such a burning disgrace." "What became of the girl?" said the Judge, breaking the pause. "I don't know. I suppose the common end of such misfortunes. Of course she could not come back to her friends, and of course the heartless man who deceived her would soon be glad of any excuse to throw her off. She did cling to him, I believe, though, as long as, she could. As late as eight years ago, I remember of hearing of them living together in London -that was just before the Maitland trial which attracted so much attention, if you remember --yes, you was on the bench, Judge. Just after, he went abroad again, and I don't like to think of what might have become of her afterwards' Some- how I always pitied her, contrary to the general rule in such cases; she was so young, and such a gay, happy creature. I saw her once or twice, long be- fore this came round; and Mr. De Lacy always struck me as a stern man." Judge Rathburn winced a little, and began slowly to draw on his heavy gloves. He passed out of the warm library into the hall, and bidding his host a grave good-night, went out into- the still falling storm. His thoughts were drawn out for once from the intricacies of plodding suits, or the hundred  &#xD;<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC7555-00000202"/> 404      AGNES STANHOPE. matters of his dull, everyday round, to which he had just listened; those few idle words had unlocked that lonely chamber in his heart, whose doors were rarely unclosed, but which was there none the less. They had disclosed an unknown chapter in the clos. ing life of the woman who had been the love of his youth, as not less of his ambitious manhood, and hardening old age. He thought of her to-night, as he had always remembered her, as a fair, blue-eyed girl, with sunny, golden ringlets, like that which slumbered under many a sand of glittering dust in his locked drawer. The cutter dashed on over the white snows till it turned into a street not far from the Judge's resi- dence, when the horse, checking suddenly in his quick pace, shyed and drew back, surveying side- ways some object which lay close to the path. The servant made an ineffectual attempt to force him past, but the Judge, casting back his enfolding buf- falo robe, bent forward and saw that it was a female figure extended apparently insensible on the pave- ment. The snow had ceased falling, a clear north wind had swept aside the clouds, and the stars shone down through the rifts on the colorless face and the poor, faded garb. "Some   unfortunate creature, perishing in the snows." The Judge ordered his servant to stop, and alighting, assisted to raise the insensible form to the o                  :    AGNES STANHOPE.       405 cutter. "We must take her to the nearest watch- house, John. Drive on." And as the startled horse plunged forward beneath the spur of the whip, he relapsed back into silence, casting now and then a careless glance on the inanimate burthen he was half-supporting in its place in the seat beside- him. The motion seemed to arouse her; her white lips moved with the murmur of some inarticulate name, and then the chill lids fell again over the half-closed eyes. The voice struck his ear; it aroused him. He looked at her more closely. It was familiar; it brought up some strong recollections, not altogether painful nor yet pleasant. The moon had come out, and her sickly light poured now full on the wasted cheek, the faintly traced brow, and the faded mouth. There was a resemblance - he gave a quick start as he saw it--to one whom he had known years ago, whom he would look upon never again on earth. Yes; in all this misery, this poverty-stricken garb, a desolate outcast perishing in the snows. His thoughts swept over the story to which he had just listened, passing out from the warm rooms and the blaze of light, "Turn the next corner, John. We will not go on to the watch-house. The poor creature is chilled through already. She would never come to with the little help she would get. I will take her home."

A few mo- ments brought them to the door, and Judge Rath- burn alighting, lifted his light burthen as if she had been a child, and carried her into the lighted dining- room. His sister, Lucy Rathburn, came toward him in surprise. "A poor woman whom I found perishing in this storm," he said, laying her down gently on the sofa. The horse in shying called my attention to her. A few moments, perhaps the next passer-by, would have been too late. You will have her taken to a warm chamber, and see that everything is done for her. She would never have come to if I had taken her to the station-house, as was my first thought." Lucy Rathburn was still surprised, but she was too accustomed to obey her brother to question any of his commands, and she rang the bell hurriedly for assistance, while she busied herself with her own hands about the stranger. It was long before any signs of consciousness re- turned to Helen De Lacy in the pleasant little cham- ber to which she was at once removed, and when it did return it was with an obscurity of mind, a glimmering struggle for recollection, which towards '*w    AGNES STANHOPE.       407 morning deepened into a host of strange images and frightful vagaries. A fever had set in, so the phy- sician said, who in the gray dawn of the winter morning was summoned to stand by her restless couch; and the hired nurse came to take her place by the pillow, while the servants went through the adjoining rooms with noiseless footfalls. Those were strange words which fell now in the low moan of entreaty, and the frantic cry, from those parched lips, and Lucy Rathburn shuddered as she stole in day after day to look upon the- pallid face which, in its little intervals of rest from those moments of de- lirium, seemed to put on hour after hour more of the hue of the grave. "She must have led a strange life," she said to her brother, as they sat at the breakfast table, in the second week of this singular sickness. "I cannot endure to listen to her ravings. She talks of mur- der, and it all seems so real. Now she is mixing the poison with her own hand, and again she is dashing it aside, and entreating some one, whose name I am quite unable to catch, not to leave her." "It is the phantasy of a disordered brain," said the Judge coolly. "I know not what I might say, if 1 were lying in that hot bed, with my head on fire But I think the woman has known very differenl days. There was something about her that struck me in that light, little as I saw of her.'"  &#xD;<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC7555-00000204"/> 408'     AGNES STANHOPE, ' Yes," said Miss Rathburn. "She brings up some one I have known before, but I can't remember now." The Judge rose; the movement was not singular, for he had finished his chocolate, and the business of the day, in the form of an early visitor, already waited him in his library. But his thoughts lingered on his sister's words as he went out. He had not forgotten, as we well know, Helen De Lacy's strange visit years ago. Light as he had made of the rav- ings of her fever, in his busy reflections they were taking an uneasy shape. Week after week went by, and the sufferer still lay upon her couch, but the violence of the disease hada abated; the turning hour had come and passed, and she was slowly approaching convalesence. Her eyes opened with the first dawn of reason in bewil- dered surprise on the objects which surrounded her, on the softly shaded room, with its pure white cur- tains and tasteful furniture, the table at her bedside glittering with vials, and the pale, patient nurse who sat opposite, kindly watching her with her quiet, gray eyes. She tried to raise her hand to her head, but her feebleness checked the movement. "Where am I?" she said faintly. "You are better, madam," said the nurse, uncon- sciously using the address which Helen's tone and manner forced from her. "You have been very sick.   AGNES STANHOPE.       409 The doctor forbids your asking any questions at present." She rose to pour out a soothing draught, and Helen drank it, too weary for opposition, and sunk again into a refreshing sleep. So the days wore on, conversation or inquiries in- terdicted in her sick-room, till she came to remember at last that some kind hand had taken her up when she was perishing in the snow, and brought her to this shelter of compassion and plenty. Then her anxiety to see at least one of her preservers could be no longer restrained--the lady whom she now dimly remembered as a frequent visitor to her fevered couch - and this restless desire it was thought best to grant. Lucy Rathburn had absented herself from the chamber of the still dangerously ill woman, more from the direction of the physician than her own in- clinations, and she now obeyed at once the warmly expressed wish. Miss De Lacy gazed earnestly on the stately face which paused at her bedside, whose clear, blue eyes and fresh colored cheeks, bore through all the wrin- kles and furrows of age something of the freshness of youth. Here was one of her rank, the rank she had forfeited; but how would she turn from her in disgust if she knew her terrible story. She extended her hand towards her, the tears which had long been strangers welling up suddenly in her dark eyes.  &#xD;<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC7555-00000205"/> T 410       AGNES STANHOPE. "Madam, I would try to thank you for the life you have preserved to me, worthless as it is." Miss Rathburn looked at her, perplexed by this strange acknowledgment, but she touched the wasted fingers kindly as she said, "Prove your thanks then by getting well, and dismissing for that end all un- quiet thoughts." "First, madam, will you gratify my curiosity by telling me to whom I am indebted for such singular kindness?" Miss Rathburn hesitated. The Judge had desired that this should still be kept from her for the pres- ent - why, he did not see fit to say. "It is enough," she said gently, "that you are with friends, who will do everything that your comfort requires. Do not seek to know more." Helen bowed, with a disappointed look. "It seems like a dream," she said; " the name would have made it more real. But I submit to your judgment." "You shall know shortly," said Miss Rathburn, and she went out. Another interval of weeks in that quiet chamber, and now the mild dawn of April had come round, and the invalid was lifted to her easy chair, and sat looking out day after day on the little strip of gar- den, and the busy street, of which she caught glimpses beyond. The crocuses had flowered and gone; the hyacinths were opening in bud, and the    AGNES STANHOPE.       4" narrow walk below looked pleasant with its leaving rose-vines and border of thick springing plants. She was still too weak to trouble herself much over the future, or to indulge in long speculations over the strange circumstances in which she was placed, but she accepted the calm wearily, and with a few regrets over the hand which had snatched her from her longed for fate, wondered how soon with renewed strength she must go out again into the bitter, struggling world. She was ignorant still to whom she was indebted for all this kindness; but she felt that there was not one in the wide world, through all its breadth and depth, that would render it to Helen De Lacy, and she ceased to bewilder herself with trying to discover what was so mys- teriously withheld. o9  &#xD;<pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC7555-00000206"/> CHAPTER XXIX. "A visitor for you this morning, madam," said the nurse, as she gave the last touch to the smooth raven bands, now tracked here and there with a thread of shining silver; carefully arranging the soft cushion to her back in the easy chair, and drawing forward to place in a more favorable light the little vase of fragrant violets which Lucy Rathburn's kind hand had gathered. "My master is coming in to see you. Hle talked of it yesterday, so Mary, the upper house- maid told me, but he was called away." Helen looked up with some surprise at the an- nouncement, but she said nothing, and presently the nurse went out. She soon returned, pausing on the threshold merely as she flung open the door to give entrance to Judge Rathburn. Helen raised her eyes; she remembered him in a moment, and knew at once to whose hospitality and care she had been so long indebted, but the discovery so astonished her it left her without the use of words. The Judge approached, bowed, and took the chair opposite. "I am  glad to find you convalescent, madam." His eyes fell accidentally on the vase of violets; he turned a little away.    AGNES STANHOPE.       313 Did he remember her, then? Did he- remember her visit that wild, stormy, winter night, when she nearly lost herself in the blinding mist? No; it was eight long years ago, and he had never seen her face. "I know not how I can express to you my sense of obligations, Judge Rathburn. I wish the life you so kindly preserved had been some other of more value." He threw a penetrating glance on her. "You seem desponding, madam. Perhaps you have been unfortunate. Suffer me to intercede with your friends." She colored; the blood shone up warmly in her hollow cheek and on her pale brow, glowing no longer with the rich complexion which her bitter life had faded before its time. "I have no friends. You need not to be told this when you remember from what you rescued me." The Judge changed his position a little uneasily. The subject which lay in the background was diffi- cult of approach. "It is several years since we met before," he said. "You may have forgotten the oc- casion, but it is quite distinct in my memory." She gave a glance of startled disquiet, but no other answer, and he went on; "I saw Mrs. Mait- -land last evening. She was at a fete in Chelsea." The look of disquiet changed now to a troubled horror.. "'Not here? Not in London?  Is the woman mad?"  &#xD;<pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC7555-00000207"/> "4      AGNES STANHOPE. "I have met her before," he went on quietly, with- out appearing to heed the exclamation. "I knew it was a face I had seen, and there might be something of this kind connected with it, but she was so changed by health and happiness, and the prestige of her new name, that even I was slow to remember." "What man could have married her under such a charge? and last of all, brought her here?" "He is one of the first private gentlemen in Eng- land," replied Judge Rathburn. He paused, and seemed in no haste to add the name. "If you -have ever visited Devonshire you have heard of the old family of De Lacy. He is the last of that line." Such a deep, smothered cry! The Judge turned to find almost the likeness of death, in the white face before him. "I did not mean to distress you, Miss De Lacy," he said, no longer concealing his know- ledge of the name of his guest; "but this is a seri- ous matter, and one that must be disposed of. I have thought over your visit several times, and lat- terly it has awakened a doubt of this woman's guilt. But for this doubt I should have denounced her at once. It is true there is no one to whom I would have done such a service more unwillingly (ignorant as he of course is of her history) than to De Lacy; but it would have been my duty, and also none the less a service." He stopped, but she made no reply. "I waited," he went on, "because there was yet time,    AGNES STANHOPE.       415 and my information can be laid against her at any hour. Blind as she has been in her fancied security, she will be slow to believe her danger." "Blind I blind!" murmured his shrinking audi- tor. "And O, what has led Ralph, of all others, into such a marriage?" "She is very beautiful," said Judge Rathburn, musingly, " and very pure and very sorrowful look- ing. Her face would almost make me believe her innocent, if I had never been on the bench, and were not used to such things. It is a pitf if she be, after all, and must suffer for such a horrible crime blame- lessly, and bring disgrace on an honorable man." Poor Helen; she sat with her pale hands locked together, her eyes fixed, and her breath coming short. The trial before her was too great. Her flesh and blood shrank from it. Not death -she could have met that a thousand times, and welcomed it as the pillow that would at last soothe her to a blessed sleep; but such a death -a low, narrow cell, the hooting crowd, the gallows. "I cannot say more than I told you then," she said in a low voice. "I know her to be innocent; the poison was taken by mistake. I can tell you nothing more." Did he begin to suspect her? - What had she said in those long sick days, a vague recollection of whose fever-colored dreams were now coming back to her. If he should----..  &#xD;<pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC7555-00000208"/> "6      AGNES STANHOPE. The Judge looked at her gravely, almost, kindly. The sternness of the court-room was gradually melt- ing from his face, warming as those wrinkled lines were to a gentleness they had not worn for many a long year. "I confess I have myr own theory of this mysteri- ous subject, Miss De Lacy," he said." Will you listen?" She looked up. The repetition of her own name recalled a fact which had been forgotten in her dis- tress. How had he discovered what she once was? the honorable name she had long ago relinquished as unworthy to bear. Ah, well, no doubt her ravings had told them all. "I heard a strange story," he said, " some weeks ago; a story strange as any fiction, and as sorrowful, but yet such as in my experience now and then comes up in actual life. It was of a young girl, very young and thoughtless, who placed more faith in the assurances of a stranger than in the word of her own kin. She went with him, and turned her back upon her home, to share his fortunes; to be his wife she thought, but it turned out otherwise, for he was more heartless even than she had been told.' The Judge glanced at his listener--her face was closely buried in her hands. "I know little of their wanderings," he went on "in the long years which followed. They wen   AGNWES STANHOPE.      417 abroad, for the life of the man who had wrought this ruin was safe neither at the hand of the father or brother; but at length England was free to them, and they returned. The girl had clung to her be- trayer in all this long interval; she had been all but in right his wife; she would not be transferred to another, or thrown aside when her first bloom was gone. I do not say this in any way atones for her fault, but I say she might have sunk lower even than she did. There came an hour when she found that her doom was sealed; that this man, for whom she had made the last of all sacrifices, was cruelly de- termined to cast her off at last to starvation, or a worse fate. All the entreaties to which she might condescend would be powerless to move him. She stood in his way; she had stood in his way a long time.' He had a friend"- the Judge glanced at the shrinking and trembling form before him,"- a young man of fair connections and good birth, whom he had helped to ruin. This friend had conceived a fickle passion for her; and though, aa I said before, she was incapable of taking this last step in her deg- radation, she was not loth to tamper with his admi- ration in her wretched life. When she knew that she was to be cast off--when perhaps she was in- sultingly told that she could take up with this new fancy--what more natural to a passionate, high- spirited woman as she was, than that her clearer 19  &#xD;<pb n="418-419" xml:id="VAC7555-00000209"/> "8      AGNES STANHOPE. reason should leave her for a little time. She re- membered her- wrongs, and they were none the less because they had been smothered so long. She remembered what she was when he crossed her path, and iwhat she was now. Which is the most plausible supposition -that the wife of a gambler, who still held her own self-respect, and had no bitterer causes than perhaps a little harsh treatment and a little jealousy against her husband, should plan to poison him, or that this woman should suddenly take her wrongs into her own hands?" These was still no answer, but the convulsive shudder, which shook his auditor from head to foot. "They both came there often," he went on in a subdued voice; " there might have been a mistake -the wrong glass offered." There was a lengthened pause. The Judge spoke again. "If this woman whose history I have just given you should cross my path, should come to me with the confession pf her crime, I should not give her up to the right of the law. She was crazed, morally crazed with her misery." How much the Judge's sympathies had to do with his singular clear-sightedness in this everyday case, we will not pretend to say. Helen spoke, slowly, at last, without removing her hands from her face.   AGNES STANHOPE.       419 "I can acknowledge nothing you have said, nei- ther will I deny. What can have inspired any heart with such interest in my wretched story, least of all yours, I cannot conceive." "Hear me, Miss De Lacy," said Judge Rathburn. "I knew your mother in her youth.  For her sake I would serve you. I reveal this to you because it is necessary that I should obtain your confidence. Whatever she would have asked of me, in her name I stand ready to fulfil." "There is nothing that can be done for me," said Helen, mournfully. "If- I could save this unfortu- nate woman, Mrs. Maitland, by the sacrifice of my own life, I would render it up cheerfully, but not un- der the horrible circumstances." She shuddered. "There is a way," said the Judge, looking at her earnestly. "But first, of yourself.  You must not remain in England. Discovery may yet come round. I have known such things to come to light after a sleep of years, when they had almost died out of re- membrance.   There is no sure safety for you here." "I have not the means," said Helen, desponding- ly. "I have toiled with my needle for the last eight years, I hardly know how, and the pawning of my trinkets, and everything that was left of other days, helped me in my struggle for bread. How I lived on I cannot say. It is a mystery to me now."  &#xD;<pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC7555-00000210"/> r' I   -420      AGNES STANHOPE. "Perhaps to save the innocent victim who has suf-f fered for your crime," said the Judge, gently. "Let this thought give you courage to struggle with your despair. The ways of Providence are very wonder- ful. I see it to-day. There may be peace and com- fort for you yet." She shook her head. 't I have heard," he said, " of women in another land who give their lives to deeds of pity and mercy -Sisters of Charity, I think, is the name by which they are known. Some such a life might give you the rest you long for." She was silent and thoughtful. "'As for the means of leaving England," he re- sumed, " and the wants of this lonely exile abroad, leave all that to me." She looked up now for the first time, and the only gleam of gratitude which that long interview reveal- ed shone up in her heavy eyes. "You overwhelm me with obligations. Am I at liberty to accept them?" "' Remember in whose name they are offered." She said no more. "There is the closing subject to be settled," he said. "It is painful, but we must face it before we part. This charge which still hangs over Mrs. Mait- land, which a recognition may bring up at any hour, must be laid at rest."    AGNES STANHOPE.        421 "Alas! how?" "A confession, to be placed in her husband's hands, and used only in the case of stern necessity, when you are far from England, and under the shel- ter of a new name, can expose you to little danger." "Confess all to Ralph-tell him what I am-dare to write to him--.O, no! no!" "You owe it to him," said Judge Rathburn, firm- ly, " but do not place it in that light. It is a con- fession to the world, though one to be used only in the most urgent need. Remember this. And re- member that in no other way can you insure this in- nocent woman's safety." "I submit," she said, mournfully. "But O, could there be a bitterer penance presented to me " The Judge rose and went out, soon returning with pen and paper, which he placed before her. It was some moments before her trembling hand could be steadied, or her agitated mind could frame the words, but with a little assistance from the Judge, who had drawn his chair to her side, the document was at last begun, and brought slowly to its close. Then she pushed it from her, and buried her face again, shudderingly, in her hands, while the Judge silently ran it over. "I, and I alone, caused the death of Howard Maitland, by the administering of a powder of arsenic, in London, on the - of Oct., in the year --, for which his wife, Agnes Maitland,  &#xD;<pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC7555-00000211"/> !    422       AGNES STANHOPE. was tried and condemned. I had then a suite of rooms at pri- vate lodgings, with Mr. and Mrs. Hawes, at -St., No. -, in the suburbs of London, and at that time was known under the name of Mrsi Percival. I had been cruelly deceived and wronged by a man who as the last act of his falseness was about to cast me off, and I was almost frantic with my wrongs. I determined, in my frenzy, to take them into my hands, and after trying what remonstrance might do, sent for him as a last favor to dine with me, pretending to submit to his will, that it might be best after all, but praying we might part in peace. He came, but brought his friend with him unasked. The servant who waited on the table that day was a hired porter, who knew neither of the vis- itors. He supplied the place of the general servant of the es- tablishment, who was called away for a few days. His name was James Martin, but I don't know where he lived. When the dessert came on I poured out L-, yes, I will speak his name -Lawrence, a glass of wine from a separate flask, which I had before well drugged with the poison, and offered him a toast. To my horror, he only bowed over it, and passed it to this wretched man, Maitland, saying he had business to do in an hour, and must keep his head clear, and if he drank one glass another would be sure to follow. Maitland drained it to my toast before I could get my thoughts, or had time to check him. I was in the court-room through all Mrs. Maitland's trial; I should have come forward, but the horrible penalty stayed me. I went to the Judge that night, after the sentence, praying him to inter- cede for her, and get out a petition for pardon, but I could tell him nothing new, and he believed her guilty, and refused me. I have drawn up this confession at last on the eve of leaving England, fearing the day may come when this innocent woman, who escaped from her prison, and I have learned still lives, may be again arrested. I convey it to his charge who judged her and found her guilty on the bench, praying only that unless her   AGNES STANHOPE.         423 need requires, it may never see the light; for my sake it would be useless, as I shall be safe from pursuit, and for the sake of the honorable nanme I once bore, I pray it may remain an ever- lasting secret." "There is one thing wanting," said the Judge, gently touching her arm, " your signature." She affixed it, with a faltering hand. He rose to go. "I will see you again when my arrangements are completed, which will be in a few days. Mean- while I leave this paper in your possession. I know I may trust you.  You will leave it behind you on your departure. You see I must make some provi- sion for myselfin the contingencies of the future."  -  &#xD;<pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC7555-00000212"/> CHAPTER XXX. Agnes came back to London. The week at Dev- onshire had ended, and De Lacy's still entangled business imperatively claimed his return. Her trembling opposition was swept away before the wondering look it at last elicited, and she turned shrinkingly from the next quest6in which seemed almost to tremble upon her husband's lips. It might be the excitement of her distorted fears after all; so she said, and -she tried to seem reconciled with De Lacy's promise, that the sultry midsummer, at farthest, should see them settled in Devonshire for all time to come. So the opening May found them again in the smoky metropolis; and the long mornings, while De Lacy was closeted in his lawyer's dingy office, found Agnes mostly at Crawford's, for she was sit- ting for her portrait, to be added to the long list which graced the old picture gallery. She had wondered if the day would come when this new face would be veiled like poor Helen DeLacy's, and many an anxiety had begun to cross her of late, lest the restless nights and gnawing fears of the tarrying days, wearing as they plainly did, upon her health W     AGNES STANHOPE.       425 and bloom, should bring back a more distinct like- ness to what she had been in that terrible period of her life. Bertha she saw only at a distance, but even then the absence of color, and the heavy eyes, showed her that her secret was torturing another breast, and she shrank, purposely, from the pain of the interview which her sister plainly sought, dread- ing the alternative which she foresaw would be pressed upon her, either of a disclosure to her hus- band from her own lips, or a revelation at last to his ear from these anxious friends. Twice or thrice Judge Rathburn passed her in the street, the same courtly bow, but no longer the gleam of puzzled in- quiry in his cold eye as lit met hers; either his doubts were laid at rest, which of course could not be, or he had dismissed the question where they had met as of little moment. Leslie's calls were as per- severing as ever, but from the cause to which I have before alluded he now seldom found her in, or on such occasions always surrounded by a throng of visitors. De Lacy had begun to discover the change in her outward appearance, absorbed as he was in his present matters of interest, and guarded as her spirits uniformally were in his presence, and she saw with no little uneasiness that his quick eye had traced it to some mental origin, to some cause very different from the smoky atmosphere and lan- guid spring days of London. She saw also that he 19*  &#xD;<pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC7555-00000213"/> 426      AGNES STANHOPj. forebore to question, trying still to deceive himself with the belief that it had its growth in those acute sensibilities which would linger too painfullyl around the past, here in the theatre of its events, but she felt that the fabric of her happiness had never before seemed tottering on so frail a foundation. The portrait was concluded at last; three weeks had dragged away, bringing round the mid-May, so much from the carefully numbered days that must intervene to that blessed period which should witness their departure to Devonshire. It was a drizzly, chill morning. De Lacy had just gone out, and she lingered alone in the draw- ing-room, wondering how in the absence of visitors, with her restless disquiet, she should get through the long hours which must intervene to lunch. The sudden ring of the bell settled this question, but by the announcement of a most unwelcome visitor, Mr. Leslie. She would have retreated to her room, but there was no escape through the open door, and she rose up to receive him. Cool as her greeting was, it seemed neither to embarrass or discompose him; he took a seat with his customary complacency, and with a little graver air than was his wont, began to congratulate himself on the opportunity with which chance had at last favored him. "I do not understand you, Mr. Leslie," said Agnes, with cold dignity. "I have overlooked the words i!       AGNES STANHOPE.       4 427 you addressed to me a few weeks ago, so far as to admit your usual visits, and. to receive you still as one of my husband's friends, but for this to continue you must be sensible of what you owe me as a wife, and a woman of unsullied honor." "I repeat again, that I remember all," returned Lisle, calmly, " but," he went on with easy sophis- try, " there are unusual circumstances which set aside the first, and for the last no woman ever won from me a fuller respect and reverence. When I first met you, -years ago, in your first wedded life, I could but be struck by the circumstances around you, so unworthy of your gentleness and beauty; later, in the court room, when I saw you friendless and deserted', I alone of all that throng believed you innocent, and would have risked everything to save you."  She trembled. The last allusion had struck home, and he saw it. He saw it in her changing color and silently locking hands. "If I had met you under other circumstances,' he went on--" not in danger, free from this terrible fate which hangs over you, I should have kept mJ secret to myself. Reckless as I have been--and that you have no need to be told, when you recal: in what company you first saw me --there is somE good in me yet. It is that very good which prompti me to save you.

You know he X    - is wrapped up in his -family pride - bitter as is the shock it has already received. You know that he is cold and selfish. You know that you dare not tell him." "I know he is everything that is true and noble," said Agnes, faintly. O, how she hated herself to be compelled to listen to this man even for a moment. "In no one thing could I wish or ask him other than he is. Be content with this, Mr. Leslie, and allow me to leave you." She made a movement to rise, but a quietly im- perative gesture forced her to resume her seat. "Are you mad, Mrs. De Lacy, that you will not see your danger! I tell you that others recall your face as well as I. Judge Rathburn remembers you, he is only waiting for a little more confirmation, a little fuller certainty. He is slow and wary, but his hour is close at hand. Do you think he would spare you.? He would be -the last of all men to do that." "You would terrify me, Mr. Leslie," said Agnes. "You forget that I have met Judge Rathburn more than once since my return. If my danger lay from him, it would have come before." She tried to speak bravely but her lips were very white. "It is quite three weeks since your return from Devonshire," said Leslie, musingly. "Do you re- rinJ *    AGNES STANHOPE.       429 member at the close of thefete in Chelsea, at which I had the pleasure of meeting you--that on your return from the supper room with Colonel Maitland, you found Judge Rathburn in close conversation with Mr. De Lacy? Her sudden attention showed that she did. "Did Mr. De Lacy see fit to acquaint you with the subject of that conversation?" The color flushed up now a little in her white cheek. "Mr. Leslie, you will remember that you are speaking of my husband, and in addressing me, guard your tone accordingly." His voice fell from its slight accent of disdain in a moment.  "I pity him," he said, though this pity is mixed with a feeling of bitterness when I reflect how little he understands the woman whom he is so fortunate as to call his wife. But to this conversa- tion, it came to my ear as I stood by, and with the first word I could not choose but listen. It was oi your marriage abroad, and, guardedly, from what part of England you had come." "You see now that I am not playing upon your alarm. Would y3oiL could know that man as I do, you would be no longer blind. You would listen to me." "Not to save my life! Not to save all the agony and misery that may be to come." "Agnes, you are mad!

They may waste your strength and sap- your life, but he never dreams of them. What a love is this I Is it because of your wretch- ed experience you fear to trust me? It must be. Love for your husband - with this concealment- pshaw I I do not believe it!" There was a step in the room. Both looked up. De Lacy stood a few paces from them. -His unu- sual paleness and steady look, showed that he had heard at least the closing, words, how much more neither knew, his entrance had been so unheeded in the engrossmeint of both. Agnes cowered like the guilty thing she felt her- self, and then in the anguish of the moment her breath came faint,.and she slipped in a merciful swoon to the floor. De Lacy made no movement to approach her; a sudden spell seemed to have frozen him to the spot, but Leslie's gesture to rise aroused him, and mo- tioning him, impatiently, to resume his seat, he rais- ed her in his arms, and with a brief word to his guest, "You will remain here till I return," bore her up the staircase. He placed her on the lounge in her dressing-room, and ringing the bell for her maid, went back to the drawing-room. Closing the door carefully after him, he approach- ed Leslie, who, in no very enviable frame of mind,   AGNES STANHOPE.       431 awaited the probable result of his rashness. He was as brave a man as the average of hi; kind, but there were reasons which made this coming inter- view unwelcome. If it should come to a challenge, he knew De Lacy to be a better shot than himself; they had tested it often enough in their boy days, and he had not gained much since. There were old recollections, too, of those days, strange as it seems, and he shrank with as much shame and uneasiness as was in his nature to feel, from the sight of the man he would have so injured. "Have you any explanation to offer me, Mr. Les- lie, for the language I have just heard?" There was nothing offensive or bitter in these sim- ple words, or the tone in which they were uttered, though there was plainly a struggle to keep down another feeling, and Leslie tried to answer. "Very little, De Lacy. Only the very danger- ous circumstances in which Mrs. De Lacy is placed, and of which you, though her husband, seem entire- ly ignorant." "I am at a loss to conceive how Mr. Leslie, of all others, can be possessed of any information regard- ing my wife, which is not the property of all the world." c'I will allow something to the heat of the mo- ment," said Leslie, striving to repress the irritation which this answer excited. "I know I am griev-  &#xD;<pb n="432-433" xml:id="VAC7555-00000216"/> 432      AGNES STANHOPEt ously in fault, too. But, take my word, there is something you should know, believe me, or not. I may have' been mistaken on one point -I think I was -but not on this. If Mrs. De Lacy refuses to answer you, seek for information from Colonel Mait- land." He rlse. "I will not trespass on you farther. I shall not darken your doors again--unless you can forget--and I enter them as the husband of Miss Trevannion." I He was gone. De Lacy sat still, with his hand over his brow, and a shadow on his face, such as it had never worn since that dark, dark day, years be- fore. There was another ring at the door, but it fell un- heeded on his ear, and he only looked up when a tall figure stood upon the thresohold, and recogniz- ing Judge Rathburn, he rose and gave him his hand, striving to throw his usual cordiality into the restrained greeting. "My errand is one of importance," said the Judge, taking the offered chair. "It is also a pain- ful one, and I know not well how to open it." De Lacy looked at him earnestly, in his surprise, almost aroused from his own disquieting reflections. "You remember the Maitland trial," said Judge Rathburn, "which took place rather more than eight years ago?"   AGNES STANHOPE.        433 "Yes," said De Lacy, wondering to what this could lead. "I was then abroad, but I read it in the journals with some interest, as I had seen the gentleman." "Mrs. Maitland, who was condemned on that tri- al, effected her escape by some unknown aid, before her sentence came round,"   pursued the Judge. "She went abroad." De Lacy's color suddenly grew a shade paler. The -tone in which the last words were spoken, struck him. It seemed to stop the quick beating of his heart. 'I left no stone unturned at the time," said the Judge, " to discover the abettors of this daring out- rage upon the laws. I knew them well enough, but the scheme was too artfully planned for even my detection. I would have given half my wealth then, to have had her overtaken, and brought back to her doom, and from fresh crimes on society. But how singularly the ways of Providence are brought about. I have lived to know that she was inno- cent."* De Lacy breathed again. "There is another story I have yet to follow, and *In our day and country it seems a matter of surprise that Agnes Stanhope should be convicted of the crime with which shewas charged on such insufficient evidence; but the recollection of the reader at all acquainted with the administration of English courts at that period, will recall many a parallel.  &#xD;<pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC7555-00000217"/> 434      AGNES STANHOPE. both of these, Mr. De Lacy, touch you nearly. The i;    real murderess, in my belief, was hardly less to be pitied than this poor girl, who was followed about from place to place of her exile, with the dread of discovery and arrest. The poison was not mixed for the wretched man who took it, but for a villain of far blacker character, and whose account may be yet to come. The woman, whom in her youth, he lured by his false words, from her honorable home, after clinging to him for years, in the last hour of his de- sertion, took her wrongs into her own hands. She was wild with her wretchedness." De Lacy moved with a shuddering gesture, but his face was turned away. "I will not prolong this painful part," said the Judge. "I have her confession, here." He unfolded the paper.  De Lacy took it from his hand. He wished to be alone when he read it, and the Judge saw his thought.  One word," said De Lacy, checking his retreat- ing steps, "what of this unhappy woman? what has become of her?" "She has found friends who will provide for her," said Judge Rathburn, " and who will do all for her comfort that can yet be done." De Lacy pressed his hand fervently, and they parted. It was long before Agnes revived from the swoon   AGNES STANHOPE.        4385 into which she had fallen. when, with the first glim- mering of recollection, she found herself in her dressing-room, and  her maid bending over her. The hour so -long-dreaded had come. Her secret was revealed at last. She knew -from De Lacy's absence from her side that he knew the whole, and she felt her heart die within her, as she thought of the first look upon his face. There came a low knock at the door. She had heard it many and many a time, but never as now.  "I cannot see Mr. De Lacy," she said, as her maid rose to answer it. ( Tell him I am too ill. Tell him I shall be better soon." The girl went out, and presently returned with a folded note which she placed in her mistress' hands. Agnes opened it slowly and eagerly, as she glanced at the familiar characters; several seconds passed before she could gather courage to fix her eyes upon them. , Agnes, my poor child: Do not fear to see me. There is nothing in the past beyond forgiveness, if indeed you can feel that you have any need to be forgiven." An hour later,. De Lacy sat beside the couch on which Agnes still lay, weak from the effects of her long fainting fit, holding her hand in his. He had gone gently over the late events we have detailed, not dwelling upon their harsher outlines, but show-  &#xD;<pb n="436-437" xml:id="VAC7555-00000218"/> 436      AGNES STANHOPE. ing her plainly that the terror which had so long hung over her life was at last removed. "And my unworthy concealment?" said Agnes, as he ended, raising her eyes anxiously to his face. "For that you have suffered more than enough already, were there not other and serious reasons to cancel it. Do you remember, Agnes, how, in the face of your most earnest refusal, I pressed you to accept my hand? and that the continuance of your secret, whatever it might be, was at my own provis- ion? It is true I believed it far other than what it was, but having once known you, and knowing with that knowledge your innocence, not even this could have lost you to me." A glow of inexpressible relief flushed her pale face. She was silent. "Do you know, Agnes, in whose name you have suffered?" She looked up. The grief and emotion strug- gling in his face, sent a new thought upon her be- wildered brain. "Poor Helen! is it possible?" "You see that I owe you some reparation. I am thankful my heart so fully enables me to offer it." "Do you know," said Agnes, breaking the long pause which followed, and seeking to draw away his thoughts from this painful subject, "you are yet to recognize in Mrs. Maitland the sister whom I so   AGNES STANHOPE.       437 cruelly wronged, but who has long forgiven me, and shared all the anguish of my late perils?" "I have noticed a personal likeness," said De Lacy, " but I could not, of course, dream of any ne- cessity for concealment. We will send them a note to give us their company to dinner. They must know at once of all these discoveries." "To Colonel Maitland," said Agnes, warmly, ' I owe all the blessings that surround me, my very life. It has not been the least of my griefs of late, to so pain his noble heart, that all he did for me seemed so utterly thrown away." "These happy tidings will repay all," murmured De Lacy, as he rose to put his proposal into execu- tion; but he went no further than Agnes' little rose- wood writing-desk, and was soon tracing the lines on a little violet scented sheet, in his seat at her side. "What brought about your opportune return?" asked Agnes, when he had sealed and dispatched the note, and turned again towards her. "A presentiment; I hardly know what to call it. I could not fix my thoughts on Mr. Markham's de- tails this moriing; they baffled me entirely. I felt a sense of oppression, a consciousness of some dan- ger near you. When I came in, you were both too much absorbed to hear me, and the first sound of Leslie's words riveted me to the spot."  &#xD;<pb n="438-439" xml:id="VAC7555-00000219"/> 438      AGNES STANHOPE. "You will forgive him," said Agnes, uneasily. "You will not suffer the matter to lead to any fur- ther consequences." "For your sake-no. It is no better, either, than I should have expected from Leslie, weak in princi- ple, and never likely to cope with any strong temp- tation. He has found himself foiled in more than one point of his calculations, and at this moment no doubt feels as much shame as he is capable of expe- riencing." It was a happy meeting which awaited the sisters that evening in the drawing-room. The hour which Agnes had looked forward to years before had at last come, the day which should see her stand in Bertha's presence, forgiven, restored to all the old confidence and love. How wonderfully the fulfilment of her long uttered prayer had come about, but O! through what a thorny path. But where was he who should have shared it with her? Ah! in his lonely grave, in the crowded London church-yard. There was at least one heart in this little group that remembered him still, and breathed an involuntary sigh of pain in all its gladness and peace. j I "We will visit dear Hawthorndean. when the au- tumn comes round," whispered Agnes to Bertha, as they found themselves alone for a few moments on their return from the dining-room. "I should like to think over all that has taken place since I was last   AGNES STANHOPE.       439 there. What sorrowful days, and what a peaceful end to crown .them at last. How wonderfully has my fault been overruled in blessings to us all." Bertha pressed her sister's hand, but she was si- lent, and Agnes suddenly remembered that the veil of mystery must still remain around her for anoth- er's sake. Never again-not till long years after the bloom of her youth should be past, could she look once more on the old, familiar scenes, where every face would glow with the light of recognition. Well, it was but a little reparation to be made to him to whom she owed so much, and but a little sac- rifice to be borne for his sake. Meanwhile the gentlemen lingered in the dining- room to talk over more fully the disclosure which as yet Colonel Maitland knew only in substance, and which on account of any emer- gencies that might rise up in the future must of necessity be fully committed to his keeping. Judge Rathburn had taken the pains to add a note in his :own hand-writing to the confession, stat- ing the circumstances under which he had res- cued the woman from exposure and death, and the manner in which the paper had been left to his charge on her abrupt departure. He had also taken the caution to obtain the depositions of the persons mentioned in the paper, the porter, and the family with whom Mrs. Percival had lodged, without, of y'*  &#xD;<pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC7555-00000220"/> "O      AGNES STANHOPE. course, mentioning to them his motives for this sin- gular step. This note, and the important signature affixed, safely established the genuineness of the doc- ument, and all fears on Agnes' account must hence- forth be laid at rest. We need not add that Colonel Maitland was deep- ly relieved by the entire turn which these anxious affairs had taken; he felt, too, what we often feel in real experience, that he had done De Lacy injustice, and ignorant as he was of the one secret which was still held back, he could with difficulty repress the outward expression of his surprise and pleasure. "You will be glad to learn that we go down to Devonshire early in next week, Agnes," said De La- cy, as they lingered together in the drawing-room long after their guests had taken leave. (' Markham will have to plod through the close of this dull busi- ness alone. It has already come near costing me infinitely more than the paltry few thousand pounds I have received." Our tale is nearly told. We would gladly linger, did our limits permit, over Leslie's mission when he quitted the home which but for Agnes' purity and truth he might have darkened forever. We regret to say, however, that his easy self-confidence in his success proved entirely correct. Miss Trevannion was one of that large class who are invariably caught ,   AGNES STANHOPE.       441 by the glitter of a-fine exterior, and though her ear- ly experience had made her cautious, and disposed to look with questioning eyes on his previous suit, this renewal of it on his own accession of fortune (ignorant as she of course was of the little episode of his passion for Agnes) helped powerfully to re- move her doubts. Her father, too, was just on the eve of contracting a second marriage, and one of a nature to change to her altogether the old aspect of her home, and this fact, no doubt, had its considera- tion in the balance. After all, the marriage turned out much better than Agnes, who experienced not a few anxieties for the daughter ofher old friend when she heard of it in the happy quiet of Devonshire, dared to anticipate. If Adele found in her new life at times not all the sympathy she expected, she re- membered also that the union of her own parents had not been perfect, and submitted wisely to what she believed was the usual lot. She met Agnes again, but not till long after Bertha had carefully made known to her the great changes in her fortunes, and they became in latter years true and warmly at- tached friends. Leslie met at first with no little con- straint the woman whose fate he would have so ut- terly wrecked, but neither Agnes or De Lacy in their happiness were disposed to remember, and he gradually abandoned the uneasy fear that this little 20  &#xD;<pb n="442-443" xml:id="VAC7555-00000221"/> I     h442     AGNES STANHOPE. episode might yet reach the ear of' his unsuspecting wife. Poor Maitland, whose undisciplined passions, and rash marriage, laid the foundations of his ruin. He sleeps well under his low mound, a plain white slab, with the simple inscription of his name and age, marking out the spot among the obscure graves. It is from the hand of his sister Alice, the only being whom he perhaps ever truly loved, the only being who still regrets and remembers him. Yes, there-is another in whose memory he still lives, mingling with that dark and stormy past which even an earthly future can now light up with a mournful radiance. And Colonel Maitland? Can he ever forget the erring nephew once dear to him as a son. At Agnes'- interposition, which took place at the first favorable hour, and in the little interval to her re- turn to Devonshire, he settled on Mrs. Moreton a handsome annuity, which found her in her poverty, and which she accepted after all, with no unthankful heart. She knew again through whose hand this tardy gift must have come, and she acknowledged to herself that for once she might have been mis- taken in her estimate of- character, and that under happier circumstances Agnes Stanhope might have turned out far better than she did. And what of Helen DeLacy?    Poor Helen, whose rash will, and rasher faith, blotted out all her   AGNES STANHOPE.         443 promises in life. Years, and years after, when these eventful days were long passed, there came to Agnes, in her Devonshire home, a box of rare em- broidery, from over the seas, wrought by some busy fingers in a convent, and Agnes as she unfolded the package, gazing down upon it through her tears, knew that the unhappy woman for whom she had trod that fiery path of trial, remembered and blessed her in her better life. There is one word more.  It was some two years, dating from their departure from London, that one stormy March evening, as they sat together in the drawing-room, De Lacy pushed across the table to Agnes the London Journal he had been attentively perusing, drawing her attention to the following paragraph: ( FATAL AFFRAY IN A, GAMBLING SALOON.-We learn that a fatal affray took place last evening in Boulard's Saloon, between a gentleman of well known sporting character, Major Oakley, and a Mr Lawrence, hardly less known in certain circles as a professional gamester, and who, we learn, had just returned from the continent. The difficulty grew out of a charge of false play on the part of the former. Both were heated with wine, and the quarrel ended by the latter inflicting a blow on his op- ponent, who before any one could interfere, drew a pistol and fired, the ball taking effect in Mr. Lawrence's left side, close to the auricle of the heart. A physician was instantly called in,        -         .  &#xD;<pb n="444-445" xml:id="VAC7555-00000222"/> "4-      AGNES STANHOPE. but he expired in little more than an hour. Major Oakley is under arrest." It was a merciful fate," said De Lacy, in a low voice, as Agnes raised her eyes at last, beaming with the horror which she felt. "It saved him from a wretched and poverty-stricken old age."   &#xD;</p>
