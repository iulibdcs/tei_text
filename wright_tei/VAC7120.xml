LORING, In the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington D. C.  Stereotyped and Printed by Rockwell S: Churchill, Boston,   PREFACE AND DEDICATION, MY DEAR FRIEND,- Indignation at my dedicating this book to you will be useless, since I am at present three thousand miles out of your reach. Moreover, this dedication is not intended as a public monument to our friendship;--I know too much for that. If that were the case, we should manage to quarrel even at this distance, I am quite confident, before the proof-sheets had left the press. But I can dedicate it to you alone of all my college friends, because you and I were brought so especially into the atmosphere of the man who inspired me to undertake it, - the man to whom, under God, I shall owe most of what grace and culture I may ever acquire. You and I know his wonderful unselfishness, his tender sympathy, his exquisite delicacy of thought and life, as well as others know his wit and his scholarship. It was while I was writing the opening pages of this story that the 3  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7120-00000003"/> PREFACE. news of his death came. It was while my work was but half finished, that I was called away to the most remote and wildest portions of this great country of ours, and thus has my story become a sketch,--a bare outline of what I intended. But, such as it is, you and a few others will know what I mean by it; and that point gained, the rest matters little. If by it one single heart is made to throb, even for an instant, with love of this country, of which we can never be too mindful nor too proud, my object will be gained. And now I commend to you this book. Ever your friend, FRED. W. LORING;  To MR. WM. W. CHAMBERLIN.   "At dawn," he said, '  I bid them all farewell, To go where bugles blow and riles gleam." And with, the waking thought asleep he fell, And wandered into dream, A great hot plain from lake to ocean spread, Through/ it a level river slowly drawn;z He moved with a vast crowd, and at its head Streamed banners like the dawn. Then came a blinding f7ash7  a deafening roar, And dissonant cries of terror and dismay; Blood trickled down the rivers reedy shore, And with, the dead he lay. The morn broke in upon his solemn dream, And still with steady pulse and deepening eye, "Where bugles call," he said, "and rifles gleam, I follow, though, I die."?  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7120-00000004"/>   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.

IT was quarter after two in the after- noon, and the Professor was sitting at his desk, engaged in arranging the notes of his lecture, when there came a knock on the door. "Come in," said the Professor. "Ah, 7  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7120-00000005"/> 8     TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. isted! is it you?" This to a graceful boy of twenty, who entered the room. "Yes, it is Ned," said the boy; 'and he particularly wishes to see you for a few minutes." Every moment is precious," said the Professor, "until my lecture is in order. -What is the   matter?  Are you in trouble?" "Yes," said Ned, t I am in trouble." "Then let me read to you," said the Professor, "the concluding paragraph of my lecture on Domestic Arts." "Oh, don't!" said Ned; "I really am in trouble." "Are you the insulter or the insulted, this time?" asked the Professor.   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.    9 "Neither," said Ned, shortly; " and I'm not in trouble on my own account." "Ah!' said the Professor; "then you have got into some difficulty in your ex- plorations in low life; or you have spent more than your income; or it's the per- petual Tom." It's the perpetual Tom," said Ned.  "I supposed so," observed the Pro- fessor. "What has that youth been doing now? Drinking, swearing, gambling, bad company, theft, murder?-out with it! I am prepared for anything, from the ex- pression of your face; for anything, that is to say, except my lecture on Domestic Arts, which comes at three." "Well, if you choose to make fun of  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7120-00000006"/> 10    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. me," said Ned, "I can go; but I thought you would advise me." "And so I will, you ridiculous creature, when you need it," said the Professor; "only at such times you generally act for yourself. But, come; my advice and sym- pathy are yours; so what has Tom done?" "He has fallen in love," said Ned. "Oh, no!" said the Professor. "Yes, sir," repeated Ned, more firmly, "he has fallen in love." "'Tis the way of all flesh," said the Professor; "but I don't think Tom can fall in love. He never even dislikes any one without a cause."' "That's all very well, sir," said lNed; "but when a fellow has a girl's picture, and   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   " looks at it when he thinks he isn't watched; and when he receives notes, and keeps them, instead of- throwing them around, as usual; and when he takes to being blue,-what do you say?" "'Please state your propositions sepa- rately," said the Professor, " and I will en- deavor to form  an opinion. When a fellow has a girl's picture, - what was the rest?'" "I wish you wouldn't make fun of me," said Ned. "Well, in Heaven's name, what is there to trouble you, if Tom is in love?" asked the Professor. "Because he hasn't told me," said Ned. "Oh!

"You are the most selfish per- son, for one who is so generous, that I have ever seen. You are morbid upon the sub- ject of Tom, I believe." "Well, look here," said Ned; "I have neither father nor' mother; I have no one except Tom. I care more for him than for any one else in the world, as you know; but you never will know how much I care for him; and it does seem hard that he should shut me out of his confidence when I have done nothing to forfeit it. There's some girl at the bottom  of all this. He and that big Western friend of his, the Blush Rose, whom   I never liked, have  [ been off together two or three times; and, I as I say, Tom  has got this picture; and i *     O   Nj   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   13 the Blush Rose knows it, and knows who she is. I've seen them looking at it, and admiring it. I'm afraid, from Tom's not telling me about it, that he's doing some- thing out of the way." "In that case," said the Professor, " you had better let me read you the closing par- agraph of my lecture on Domestic Arts." "N'o, I thank you," said Ned; "I shall have to hear it, any way, this afternoon." "So-you will," said the Professor; " and, by the way, I shall give you a private if you behave to-day as you did in my last lecture. I have told your class-tutor to warn you." t Well, that is pleasant," said Ned. "I meant it to be," replied the Professor.  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7120-00000008"/> "    TTWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. "Good-by. I may call at your room to- night,--to see Tom." And, as Ned was heard going down the stairs, the Professor, seeing that he had still twenty-five minutes to spare, took his lecture, and sat down before the fire, which flickered slightly, and just served to destroy the dampness of that April day.   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.    15 II. THE PICTURE OVER THE FIREPLACE. "WHETHER the Professor would have made any alterations or amendments in his lecture, it is difficult to say; that he did not is due -to the fact that his eye fell upon a little photograph, which hung over his fireplace. As he sits there, thinking over what Ned has told him, and laughing at the idea of Tom's being really in love, he gazes on this little photograph, and smiles. The Professor has one or two real art treas- ures, but nothing that he values quite as much as this fading picture. This is the  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7120-00000009"/> 16     TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. only copy in existence; and this hangs there, and will hang there until the Pro- fessor dies. How well he remembers the morning when the two boys, whom   he loves so well, rushed into his room, and left it there! As he looks at it now, there is an expression of tenderness on his plain but strongly cut features that would great- ly astonish those of his pupils who only know him as a crusty instructor. The Professor is somewhat crusty, it must be owned. It is, however, an acquired and not a natural crustiness. Cause, the fact that at thirty years of age he discovered that he cared more for a certain Miss Spen- cer than for all the world beside. On in- timating this fact to her, she told him that   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.    17 she should always value his friendship; and that she hoped soon to introduce to him her cousin Hugh, " who is," she added quietly, " to become my husband." After this the Professor withdrew almost en- tirely from society, and plunged deeper and deeper into study. Before many years his reputation was cosmopolitan, his head bald, and his life a matter of routine. Boys came and went; and at intervals he repeated before them much of what he knew. It is to these two boys, of whom he thinks now, as he gazes on the picture over the mantel, that he owes his rescue from this lethargic life. What does he see in the picture? He sees behind a chair, in which a boy is sit- , 2 c  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7120-00000010"/> 18    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. ting, another boy with soft, curling brown hair, deep blue eyes, and dazzling com- plexion. His features are delicately cut; but-the especial beauty of his face is the brilliancy of color in his hair, eyes, and complexion. There is the freshness of youth on his features; and his whole atti- tude, as he leans over his companion, is full of that quaint grace of boyish tender- ness so indefinablee and so transitory. The boy in the chair has a face full of strength and weakness.  The photograph makes him appear the more striking of the two, though the less handsome. The sunny sweetness of the first face, though it never alters, never becomes wearisome; but the second face is now all love, now   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.    19 disfigured by scorn and hatred, now full of intellect, and glowing with animation, now sullen and morose.  The complexion is olive, the eyes brown, the lips strongly cut, yet so mobile as to be capable of every variety of earnest and sneering expression. The face is always, in all its varying pha- ses, the face of one who is not dissatisfied but unsatisfied. This is what the Profes- sor sees, as the firelight throws its glimmer over the room, making grotesque shadows waver fitfully on the pictures and books around him, as well as on the heavy cur- tails that hide the rays of afternoon light which struggle through the leafy boughs of the old elms in the yard without. As the Professor sits there thinking, he  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7120-00000011"/> 20    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. seems to recall again the first visit of Tom and Ned to his room. Tom is a lovely boy,-the original of the standing figure in the photograph; and the Professor had been attracted by his face once or twice when he had met him in the yard, soon after his entrance into college. Still he is surprised, one eveni-ng, when he hears a knock at his door, and this Fresh- man enters half shyly. The Professor asks him to be seated, and then looks at him inquiringly. "I was awfully homesick," says Tom, with perfect trustfulness; "and mother told me that you were once a very dear friend of hers; so I thought I would come rlp and see you." The Professor is bewil- ;   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.    21 dered. Still he is a gentleman; so he smiles, and says to Tom: - "Pray be seated. Your mother is well, I trust." "Oh, yes " says Tom.  "Perhaps, as she hasn't seen you since before I was born, I ought to'have said who she was. Her name was Spencer.;" The Professor turns quickly. Tom pro- ceeds with entire unconsciousness:  "She often speaks of you, sir, and- al- ways in a way that has made me want to know you." "I am very glad, Tom," said the Profes- sor. "YouI must excuse my   calling you )y your first name; but then you are the ion of--your mother."  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7120-00000012"/> 22    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. Any one but Tom, who never noticed anything, would have seen here that the Professor's manner was peculiar.  But Tom is always so brightly ignorant of what is before his eyes, that the Professor recovers his self-possession, and says calmly:-                  . "And your mother is well, I hope?"  "Oh, yes!" said Tom; "very well, but   . a little sad at my leaving home. She is  very fond of me, sir."            "Strange fact!" said the Professor, dryly. "And I see that you are equally  fond of her. I am not given to moraliz- ing; but I think that college life will not Ha dec:-.y you, if you don't forget how much   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.    23 you are to your mother,-how unhappy you can make her." "Forget her?"  said Tom;  not I! he I a at he?" When I am  at home, I make love to her all the time." "Then," said the Professor, it is well that you have left home; for it will soon be time for you to make love to some one else." As the Professow makes this observa- tion, there is another knock at the door, Md Ned enters. Who is Ned? Ned is the original of the sitting figure in the ittle picture over the fireplace. He is lespotic in characterl and has therefore lany sincere friends and enemies. He fearless when indignant, and is indig-  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7120-00000013"/> 24     TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.  nant easily. He is not handsome as Tom    : is,--for Tom's beauty charms you im- mediately, and the charm is never broken; but he has a curious grace and fascina- tion of manner when he is not perverse;  but then, he often is perverse. The Professor cannot tell whether he    : likes Ned, or not. He has been giving    ::: Ned private tuition, to fit him for college, f for nearly a year. All their acquaintance  :H hitherto ,has been one of business, all   ; their conversation confined to an oc- casional dry remark on either side. Now,  ? when their contract is fulfilled, the Pro- fessor cannot imagine why Ned   should take advantage of his general invitation, 1 ancd visit him. Still he asks Ned to be    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.    25 seated, and then enters into conversation with him. Ned talks. -His keen eye has noted everything ludicrous and everything in- teresting among  his instructors, among his classmates, among all the persons and things with which college   life has brought him in contact. He is full of animation; he tells stories, all of which have a point; he sparkles with wit, which none  the less brilliant for having a certain boyish   freshness  about it. All is is a  new revelation to the Professor. He laughs, and  in his turn becomes en- tertaining; and,   finally, going  to his    eboard, produces three quaint glasses, which he fills with some  of that rare and    I  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7120-00000014"/> 26    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. wonderful old Madeira, which many of his acquaintances have heard of, but which few have ever seen. Tom, in the mean time, sits listening, radiant with enjoyment, with the firelight tinting his lovely face. "Such a jolly old fellow as this Professor is!" he says to himself; " and such a being as Ned!" He is happier than he has been since he left home; and he wishes his mother could look in upon them  now; and he drains his glass to her health. He is puzzled because Ned will address his remarks only to the Professor, and seems shy whenever he speaks. Finally, con- scious that it is growing late, he bids the Professor farewell, and Ned  rises to   l   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   27 accompany  him. The Professor says then, with a courteous and quiet dig- nity:            u "Tom, you must give my regards to your mother, when you write. Tell her that her boy will be always an object of especial interest to her old friend." Then, turlniung to Ned, the Professor adds, as Tom  disappears in the entry:- "I  have to thank you for a very pleasant evening.  You will come again, my  boy, will you not? .Why have  you never before shown me what you really are?" "It wasn't for you, sir," said Ned, with a  certain frankness that was not dis- courteous. "It was for Tom, sir; though  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7120-00000015"/> 28  .  TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. I like you, and hope we shall be friends. But the moment I saw Tom, I felt drawn towards him; and, as I saw him  come up here, I felt that here was a chance to get acquainted with him. Good-night, sir." And Ned joined Tom at the foot of the stairs, leaving the Professor in a state of complete bewilderment. The Professor laughs now, as he recalls that evening, and looks again at the picture over the fireplace.                   i "They  are an interesting pair,-- a  sunbeam and a volcano," he says; and,    I throwing on his cloak, just as the bell begins to ring, he starts for his lecture- :  room.          * .';, -   A   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   29 "I. HE MOVED WITH A VAST CROWDO IT was just after supper; and the Professor, with his thoughts still occu- pied by Tom   and Ned, walked  slowly toward his room through the dimly- lighted  yard, where the twilight was half dispelled by the gleams of gas-light that stole from the windows around. He sauntered along, enjoying the sweet spring air of the evening, and touching his hat to one boy after another until he came  by Ned's entry, when he turned, and  took his way to the room of his Ifm    f   i  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7120-00000016"/> 30    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. boys. He had stopped, as he passed through the square, for his paper, and had noticed that a crowd seemed to be eagerly and excitedly discussing the news of the evening around the post-office. Pausing an instant in the entry to look at his paper, before ascending the stairs, his eye fell on an announcement which caused him to utter an exclamation of surprise; and he rushed eagerly into the room, with the words:-- "Boys, have you heard the news?" Ned turned from the glass, where he was tying his cravat, and Tom  raised himself from his lounge; but before either of them had an opportunity' to answer, the Professor said:-   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.'  81 There has been a quarrel here. Now, boys, I must know all about it. See, I'm going to spring the lock, and have you clear your minds at once." ' There's nothing to clear," said Tom. tSpeak for yourself, if you please," said the Professor; "You may not have a mind at all; but I know that Ned has, to a limited extent. Doubtless you are both wrong; so let me see which will be gentleman enough to apologize first. Come, boys, this matter must be set right. 'Let not the sun go down upon your wrath' is one of the best pieces of advice ever given." "It is after sunset now," said Ned;  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7120-00000017"/> O:    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. "and we are not both wrong. I am right." "Cheerful self-confidence," said the Professor. "Please let me understand the cause of wrath." "Simply because I object to the Blush Rose," said Ned. "I say that he has come between us." "And I say"-broke in Tom. "Hush, Tom!" said the   Professor, "until Ned has finished." "I have nothing more to say," said Ned, " except that Tom  must, once for all, choose between us." "Very well," said Tom; "as you please; only, while I don't care for ally fellow as I   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   383 do for you, I'm not going to submit to dictation." "You're entangled with some woman, through Blodgett," said Ned. "He's a nice associate for a gentleman, he is."  " I entangled with a woman!" repeated Tom. "Why, Ned! you're crazy." "' Whose picture is it that you are carry- ing?" asked Ned. "Oh, thunder!" said Tom; "is that what all this row is about?" "I suppose you've fallen in love, and in Junior year too!" continued Ned, wrath- fully and contemptuously. "Juniors have done such things before," observed the Professor. "Fallen in love!" said Tom; as if I'd 3  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7120-00000018"/> 34    TWO COLLEGE - FRIENDS. do that! Look here, old fellow, if you knew about that picture, you'd ask my pardon." t"tWell, as I don't, I shan't," said Ned. "Come, boys," said the Professor, "this ridiculous quarrel, worthy only of a couple of little children, has gone quite far enough. Ned, I think you are petulant and absurd; but if you will go out for a few minutes, and take a short walk, Tom will unbosom himself to me, I am sure." "Well, I call that cheek, to turn a man out of his own room," said Ned.

"I don't know," replied the Professor; "but people are sometimes.  And have you a secret connected with that fat, red-faced brute, Blodgett, whom you call the Blush Rose?"

"You dear little peasant girl, put your- self away directly; and now take my advice: show it to Ned; it will make him ashamed of his folly, and will pre- vent any further angry words between you. It is hard to quarrel, and so you will think some day, though now you find it so easy. There, put it away; for I hear Ned's footsteps on the stairs! Come in, Ned! Why! what has happened?"

"Yes," said the Professor, "is it not grand to think that we -are aroused at last?" "'Well," said Ned, "I have still more to tell you. I have enlisted." There was a pause of a few moments; then the Professor grasped Ned's hand, and said simply:-- "My noble boy!" "What do you say, Tom?" asked Ned.

IT is well that I formed the habit of keeping a note-book-some time ago. How interesting what I am now writing will be to my wife and children in years to come, when I sit before my own fire, in my own housel The college chronicle of funny adventures and curious stories that my note-book has previously contained is sus- pended for a time; and I am thinking of' matters of life and death now. Well, it is splendid to have a life -to lose; and the thought of deathl, in this cause, has a  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7120-00000021"/> Y4U    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. grand, awful thrill in it, that drives away all the former terror death has possessed for me. These remarks are intended as an opening of my war note-book. Here am I, just twenty-one, and a captain,- a whole captain. It is absurd; no, it isn't. Col. Burke is raising a regiment. He has as much superfluity about him as an iron nail has, and no more. He was introduced to me about a week ago, and was told about my visits to the people around Crescent Court.  People will make me out a philanthropist, which I am not; for I despise most people I know, though the lower classes are quite interesting, but dirty. I never talked religion to any of those creatures in my life. I have given   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   41 them very little in charity; but I have listened to what they say as I would to mny own classmates; and, having talked with them   at the North End, I have bowed to them at the West End. In a word, I have carried les convenzances into Richmond Street, and have not election- eered.  Result, I have some influence, which is useless, except in keeping me clear of pickpockets.  So the colonel would have me raise a company.    I laughed at the idea, but consented to try; and here are over fifty recruits already. I told them that I had about as much to learn as any of them, and agreed to have the captain elected  by vote, myself becoming a private. I should  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7120-00000022"/> 42    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. have been very much disgusted if they had taken me at my word; but they didn't. So I am a captain; but my lieu- tenants are still to be found. Tom is full of patriotism. I never can tell how deeply a sentiment enters his mind; but he is fretting terribly about going with me. How I wish he could! but his father very sensibly advises him to wait a year longer, till he is through at Harvard; and his mother is in great distress at the idea of his leaving her. The Professor is non-committal on the subject. This morning entered Jane Ellen Bing-   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.    43 ley to the recruiting office, where I was receiving enlistments. Jane Ellen is limp in appearance, but energetic in character. Her bonnet was wine-colored velvet; her shawl draggled green, with a habit of falling off her shoulders as she talked; and her gown was calico. By the bonnet I recognized her. She is the chief attrac- tion at one of the North Street dance- houses, and entertains an admiration for me of which I am   utterly undeserving. I have so often declined in forcible lan- guage to dance with her, that I  did not suppose she could feel pleasantly toward me; but she came   forward and said:- "Here's my man!" tHer man   was a stout  fellow, rather  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7120-00000023"/> "    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. stupid-looking, with a dyed mustache. Jane Ellen herself is really very pretty, and migcht possibly reform, if she was sent away from here. Reformation, when pos- sible, is only possible through removal. So Jane Ellen having presented her man, I said briefly: What of it?" Thereupon Jane Ellen explained that her man wished to enlist, and that she wished him to come under me, as she knew I'd be a good captain to the poor boy. Sensible of the compliment, I sug- gested to Jane 'Ellen the propriety of marrying him first. In that way I ex- plained to her he would send her his salary (I could not say wages, Jane Ellen   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   45 being American); he would have some object for working his way up from the ranks; and he would have a home to think of, when away, wounded, sick, or expect- ing to die. All these things would benefit him greatly. I regret to say that Michael appeared more affected than Jane Ellen at the pictures I drew. Jane Ellen's an- swer which only came after considerable reflection, was, to say the least, peculiar. "I never expected to live to be a mar- ried woman," she remarked; "and it's a queer home I'd be able to make for any- body. However, it may do Mike good; so I'll do it. So, Mike, I'll marry you right off, and endeavor to be a  decent woman,--until you come back from   the  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7120-00000024"/> "    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. war again;" which last clause was pru- dently added. Another quarrel with Tom; and this time the Professor admits that I am right. Tom begs me to write, and solicit his parents' consent; and I won't do it; so Tom sulks,--that is the only word,- and will not be appeased. He even declares that I wish to get rid of him, when it will almost break my heart to go without him. If that boy only knew what he was to me, who am without father, mother, or family of my own, and with almost no friends, except the Pro- fessor! However, for the same reason that I have never yet visited him at his   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   47 house, because I did not wish to have our attachment or my character analyzed or criticised by his parents, I will not say a word now. I believe it will do him good to go; for I know the thought of going has done me good. The Professor has a plan, he says, and wishes me to be at home to-night, so that he can tell it to me. The Professor has told me a great deal more than he has actually said. I know now why he cares so much for Tom; and I should like to see Tom's mother. I wonder if a woman will ever change my life; and I wonder if I shall ever care for any woman as much as I do for Tom.  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7120-00000025"/> 48    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. The Professor says that Tom must go; that he is fretting himself sick now, and that it will develop his manliness of char- acter. He thinks I am right in not inter- fering, however, and says that he is going to try what he can do. Dear old fellow  His face flushed, and he gave a curious sort of gulp, as he said:-- "She always respected me; and I think she would let Tom go, if I advised her to do so." "Then shall you write to her?"I asked. "No, Ned," he said; "I shall go and visit her, and start to-morrow. The first time in twenty years, - dear me, the first time in twenty years! How  old I am getting to be!"   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   49 I knew what he meant; and I honored his pluck. I should sort of like to- be in love myself; but I am half afraid to think about it. Oh, well! there will be plenty of time when the war is over. The Pro- fessor is to start to-morrow; and Tom is not to know about it. My first lieutenant is a treasure. His name is Murphy; and he is a retired rough, by profession, but he has splendid stuff in him. Our acquaintance had a peculiar beginning. I was drilling a squad of men, and not succeeding very well in what I was about, when this giant loafed in, and began to make a disturb- ance. I looked at him, and   saw that 4  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7120-00000026"/> 50    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. remonstrance would be in vain; so I knocked him down, seeing my opportunity to do so effectively. My men laughed. The  giant raised himself in astonish- ment. '"You can't do that again," said he. Another laugh from the chorus. "I know  it," said I. Still another laugh. "I could just walk through you in two minutes," he growled, with an oath. "I believe you," said I; "and I shall give you a chance to, if you don't keep quiet." He kept quiet for a time. Then, while I was trying some manoeuvre, he came up and said, quite politely:-   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   51 "Perhaps I can help you." "Thanks," said I; "do you know any- thing about it?" Then Murphy informed me that he had been in several places where there had been fighting; and I saw he was far my superior in many respects. So, when I got him to enlist, and found that he was thoroughly interested, and that the men liked him with a feeling of fellowship that they will never have for me, I hope, I talked with the colonel about making him my first lieutenant; and it is now a fait accomjpl. Murphy's delight and gratitude at receiving his commission knew no bounds; and several of his cousins enlisted immediately. He has now a sense of personal devotion to me  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7120-00000027"/> 52    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. that will help me greatly. Dear me, how old and mature and self-reliant I am growing! and, three weeks ago, I was such a balby! Murphy is the second largest and second strongest man of us all. The largest is a large-eyed, half- crazy clairvoyant, gentle as a dove, and strong as an ox. I found him weeping the other day; and, somewhat disgusted, as well as astonished, asked the cause. Result was, that he said he wept about me. I was not to die in battle, nor in sickness, but was to meet with  a dishonorable death for a dishonorable action. Tom and Murphy were furious; but I couldn't be be- fore the two or three men who heard it; so I treated the affair as a good joke.

He studies Har- dee incessantly; practises by himself all that he can, and would form himself into a whole squad, and drill himself, if it were possible. He is -even getting into the way of planning battles and movements, and is perfectly wild at each report in the newspapers. I never saw him in such a state before,over anything. His lessons must be suffering in consequence; and I don't dare to think of the number of times he has cut prayers. Hurrah!

It is brief; but I have read it with delight a dozen times: CALL RIGHT! PLEASE SEND HM HOME IMMEDIATELY!" I know of nothing which has ever given me more pleasure than those seven words. Tom has gone off in the most remarkably vague state of mind; and I am going to see my colonel this evening, to find out whether his youth (though, as he is not quite two years younger than myself, per- haps I should say our youth) will .unfit   TWO -COLLEGE FRIENDS.   55 him for the position of second lieutenant. Any way, he's going; and that's enough to make me happy for the rest of the war. The only thing that troubles me is Mooney's prediction, which keeps ring- ing in my ears. I am not to die in battle, nor by sickness, but to receive a dishonor- able death for a dishonorable action. I don't care for the death so much; but I do pray to God, that, while I am in my country's holy service at least, I may not soil my soul. TVhat a sentence!

MY DEAR TOr:- This letter will reach you after you have been at home a day; and you must leave home as soon as you receive it, to join my company. Our colonel is splendid,--grim and grizzled, and the nerve of a steam-engine. I told him about you, and said I wanted you as second lieutenant. He asked how much you knew; and I said, "Little enough, but more than any other of my vagabonds, - God bless them!"Then I told him   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   57 about your study of Hardee; and he laughed, but asked me anxiously what yoLu thought of Hardee. I forget what I said; but I know your opinion satisfied him perfectly; for he said that your youth was your greatest disqualification. Then I said that the rough set of my company needed the influence of an acknowledged gentleman, as well as the fellow-feeling and sympathy which that rough Murphy gives them. He agreed to that. Then he spoke of the value, in any rank of life, of a university education;--he hasn't been through Harvard, you see;-- and I agree with him. Then, when he heard who was your father, and who was your mother, he smiled, and said he believed  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7120-00000030"/> in blood. I agreed agailn with him, and expressed the opinion that no one coxuld get along very well without it. Moreover, I said, that, if you did not come as an officer, the whole company would become insubordinate; for you always had your own way with me; and it would not do for a private to control his captain. He laughed; but you are sure of your position, if you come on at once. We are not a swell regiment, Tom; but my sword-belt and sash are stunning, for all that. You must begin work   at once. And, Tom, you must feel an interest in iMurphy. It will do him good; and, through him, the men.

Well, I should have been a brute if I hadn't felt a little touched. O Tom! you've forgotten to return "Roderick Random" to the library; and Sibley will come down on you for a nice lot of fines, see if he don't. But I was going to tell you about our room. Bob Lennox, who is rooming out- side, you know, wants to come in as tenant during our absence, so that we can have everything just as it always has been, when we come back by next class- day; by which time, I am quite sure, the   "   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   war will be ended; so I agreed to his proposition, subject to your objection, of course. I thought, since your educational ad- vantages impressed the colonel, that a copy of the last rank-list might work in your favor; but I decided, finally, that it would require too much explanation. Ill the same way I was thinking of getting you a certificate of moral- character from Dr. Peabody, but was not sure that he had forgotten you sufficiently. If you wish to secure your position, you must be here by Friday night.

"Oh, certainly! I'll attend to that," said the doctor, and he rushed softly away. Tom sat down by the side of the bed, and looked at his friend's face. It had changed greatly, much more than his, since they left Cambridge. The forehead was marked now with heavy lines, and the full beard made it seem  like the countenance of a mall of forty. So old can even a boy grow in a year. Ned had trained himself, with great effort, to un- questioning obedience. His criticism had been only upon those to whom he gave his orders, and he had struggled not to form an opinion on those to whom his obedience was due; thus he had become an admirable officer.

He turned and saw the Professor, and fairly hugged him in his delight. "So I have found you at last, Tom," said the Professor. "Just think  ,  said Tom; "it is a year now since I have seen you." "And the end seems as far off as ever," said the Professor. "Don't say that," said Tom,  'because sometimes, you know, I  have to try very hard not to think so myself."

"Among the wonderful effects of the war," said the Professor, in a didactic manner, "may be mentioned the fact that it has made Tom thoughtful and consider- ate. Well, go on!" "That sounds just like you," said Tom.

We didn't speak for two days, and then came another at- tack from that restless creature, Stonewall -%    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   81 Jackson. It was such a lovely day,- fresh and spring-like, but it soon grew hot and dusty. Every once in a while a bullet would whiz past; I could hear the rumble of the artillery, and I was terribly thirsty. I didn't see Tom, but I knew he was near, - we always kept close together at such times; still, if I had seen him, I wouldn't have spoken to him. My horse had been shot from under me, and I had cut open the head of the man who did it; it seems strange, now that it is all over, that I could do such a thing. Suddenly I saw   the barrel of a rifle pointed at me. The face of the man who was pointing it peered from behind a tree with a malicious grin. I felt that death  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7120-00000042"/> TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.         .ii was near, and the feeling was not pleasant. However, the situation had an element of absurdity in it, and that made me laugh a little. The man. who was going to kill me laughed too. I heard a little click, a report, and his gun went up, and he went down. Tom had shot him. "Tom," said I, with some feeling, " you have saved my life." "There!" said he, triumphantly, "you spoke first." I saw that I had, and I was dreadfully provoked. However, he admitted that he was wrong; and so, under the circum- stances, I decided that a reconciliation was advisable.   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   83   The Professor has been here to-day. He is the most delightful companion I know; and, what is his special charm, he really believes that he is hard and cynical, the tender-hearted old baby! I know that he fancies himself a second Diogenes. His liking for us boys is very queer to me. Tom  is his pet, but he prefers to talk to me. He discusses Tom with me, and then he discusses me, just as if I were a third person. To-day he told me I was a mass of selfish pettinesses. I don't think that was his word, but that was what he meant; "and yet," said he, "you are capable of heroic generosity." I  always know that part of what the Professor says is said in earnest; but I  am never quite sure what &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7120-00000043"/> TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.  part it is. He doesn't fatigue   me, and doesn't excite me, anld it is well for me that he is here; still, I am impatient to get back again. He has told me about Tom's staying with me, instead of going home. I don't know what to say about it; I don't know what to think. It makes me want to die for him; nothing else that I can do seems sufficient. NWhen this war is over, I suppose Tom will marry and forget me. I never will go near his wife--I shall hate her. Now, that is a very silly thing for a lieutenant-colonel to write. I don't care, it is true. I wonder if I am so very selfish, after all. I like refinement and elegance, and   I hate dirt; and I do like to have people care for me and do things to oblige me. But my first thought is not always of my- self; and I don't think I am unjust to others, because of myself. And, if I de- sire the sympathy and appreciation of others, I am sure it is not wrong. "G'est qu'un ccur bien atteint veut qu'on soit tout a lui." I can't remember, though, just now, a single unselfish thing that I have ever done, unless it was giving some of the fruit and jelly that the Professor brought me yesterday to a poor fellow with hungry eyes, whom I saw glaring at them through the door. That wouldn't have been gen- erous, either, if he hadn't been a rebel.  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7120-00000044"/> 6    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. Giving aid and comfort to the enemy is the only generous action that I can dis- cover of mine, after all my self-analysis. Confound self-analysis, any way! It is only another form of selfishness, mingled with morbid conceit. If I did what I ought to do, without thinking about my- self at all, it would be better for me; but I haven't anything to do just now, except scribble away here, and it is dreadfully stupid. How talking with the Professor has set me to thinking of Harvard again! Now that the lights are glimmering at intervals through the ward, I can see the yard, with Holworthy and Stoughton and Hollis beaming away from their windows at each   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.    87 other, and Massachusetts standing a little apart, as becomes its greater age, but benignant in its seclusion. I hear the voices of singing in the yard, on the steps, and under the trees; I can see fellows sitting round the tables in their rooms, studying and not studying; I can hear recitations made to the different professors and tutors; and just as the bell for morn- ing prayers, which I still hate, begins to clang upon my memory, I remember that I am here in a hospital, while we are still fighting and killing each other for the sake of the country that has given us all we enjoy. I shall be out soon, I know. There is always good prospect of a battle when I feel this way; and yet I do  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7120-00000045"/> 88    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. horribly loathe the tint of blood which has seemed to rest on everything I have seen or dreamed of for a year past. HIow I hate war, and yet how  wholly I am absorbed in it! I am getting feverish; I shall write no more to-day. In looking over my note-book, I find something which,luckily for me, I had almost forgotten; and that is, the predic- tion of my friend Mooney. Poor idiot! he was shot the first time that we were under fire. How pleasant it would have been for me in all the work I have been through, if I had remembered that proph- ecy! How it would ilave aided my recov- ery in my sickness, if I had been haunted    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   89 by those words  I am to meet a dis- honorable death for a dishonorable action, am I? The only dishonorable action I can commit is to go over to Stonewall Jack- son, and learn how to fight. By Jove! I do admire that man. He is what too few officers on either the Union or the Rebel sides are, unselfish and in earnest. But I don't think that I shall join him, for all that; and, if I did, I should not be likely to meet with death,-his luck and   his pluck would take me through. The Professor has confided to me a plan of his, which delights me. He says that he will go North, and bring Tom's mother on to Washington, if 'her health permits.  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7120-00000046"/> 90    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. As Tom's father is in Europe at present, and as it would be highly unpleasant, to use the mildest term, for a lady to travel alone to Washington, knowing nothing of the place and its peculiarities, it is very thoughtful and very kind, and something- more, in the Professor to do this. Then Tom can run up to Washington for a day or two to see her, poor fellow! and all, or rather part, of his great generosity will be rewarded. The Professor is a brick to think of it; and I have made him promise to start to-morrow. And when he goes, I shall go too, only in the other direction. How happy this will make Tom! I don't know what makes me think of   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   91 our class-day now, but I do wonder who had the rooms which Tom and I engaged for our spread. Perhaps it's the contrast between salad and strawherries, and hard- tack and corned-beef; though now every- thing seems to me to be saturated with gruel. I wonder if Tiny Snow was at class- day this year! She was an object of awe to me in Freshman year; then I despised the sex when I was a Sophomore; and then in Junior year I saw a good deal of her. She had a way of drooping her head a little; and then, with a sort of shy little gulp, raising it, and making her eyes childlike and plaintive. It was quite pleasant, even after familiarity with it had destroyed its novelty. I wrote some ver-  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7120-00000047"/> 92    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. ses to her once, and sent them to "The Harvard Magazine;" but they came into the hands of an editor who was gone on her himself, and he very properly rejected them. Once I showed Tiny, quite by accident, the Etruscan locket which I got abroad, and which Tom admired so much that I had his initials cut on it to give to him. "Oh, how lovely!" said Tiny. t Who is it for'?" "Don't you see the initials?' said I. 't T. S," said she, innocently; " who can it be? ' I thought there seemed something like a blush upon her cheek as she spoke; but   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   93 I told her that T. S. was some one I cared a great deal about. "Is ,she pretty'?" asked Tiny. "She "I answered; "it isn't any girl; it's my chum, Tom, you know."2 Then she really colored; and a little while afterward I remembered that those were her initials. How she must have hated me, --perhaps! I have eaten a real breakfast at last, and am upon my feet again. The Professor has gone, and I am going at once.

I have been excited for a year now, and I go to the front this very afternoon. I am rather thin, and my shirt feels something like an air-box; but I shall get over all that soon. We are to make an attack before long, I understand. I am back in camp. This is the last entry that I shall make in this note-book for some time to come. I am alarmed a little about Tom. I think he is going to be sick; he seems excited and feverish, and yet dull. However, he has bright- ened up wonderfully since I told him about the Professor's intention; and I am not sure but that it was a dreadful home- sickness that oppressed him when I first   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   95 met him. He won't see a doctor; he laughs the idea to scorn, and says he is only tired and overworked, and that, if I can manage to secure him a little rest, he will soon be all right. But he is dying to see his mother, he confesses to me, and I am not surprised to hear it. I said that this is the last entry I shall make here. I am  not sure now but that these are the last words which I shall ever write. I take chargme of a small expedition to-night, with men whom I have per- solally selected for the purpose; and we are to destroy the bridge above here. It must be done  at once.

A Good-by, little note-book, perhaps forever. If Tom- and I return safe,--and Tom-  will, I am sure,-why, then, perhaps, I may tell you all about this coming night's work; but, if not, you will be destroyed, unread; and so farewell.   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.      97 VIII. MDNIGHT. "Then came a blinding flash, a deafening roar, And dissonant cries of terror and dismay; Blood trickled down the river's reedy shore," And with the dead he lay. A STARLIT sky, dead silence all around, only the river's murmur breaking it. The moonbeams shining on the forest-path mark   all the  shadows with   a dazzling light, bringing  weird and fantastic out- lines forth, where brush and hedges line the dusty road, and making the parched fields, almost destitute of vegetation, shine  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7120-00000050"/> 98    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. likeburnished sheets of dead white light. And along this road came slowly, with muffled tramp, a little body of men, their dark figures darker by contrast with the gleaming barrels of their rifles, which the moonlight seemed to tinge with silvery fire. They came along so quietly, so noiselessly, now hidden from view in a curve of the road, and 'now appearing again. And still all was quiet. And then a little tongue of flame ran quickly and noiselessly up into the black darkness; and in a moment more all was blaze and smoke. The work was done, - the bridge was destroyed. Down in the road around the bridge the men were grouped,--the fire giving   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   99 them a ruddy coloring, -a tint of blood. Two figures were especially prominent, and seemed to be directing their move- ments. "Well, Tom," said Nred, ' does this remind you of bonfires in the yard at Cambridge?" N"Not much," said Tom, dispiritedly. "Wihy, Tom, what is the matter with you?" asked Ned, anxiously. "I don't know," said Tom.   "I feel nervous and apprehensive." "I ought not to have let you come with me," said Ned.  "It was weak and selfish in me to consent.

"Just as if I was going to let you go off into danger without me!" said Tom.

"Well, now I know that you are going to be sick, Tom," said Ned, "when you take that piteous tone, instead of answer- ing me back. By Jove, there goes a beam, crash; and look, the fire has entirely died out of the other. We can't leave the work half done in this way, we must hurry and finish it.

"Obey ordersl" said Ned, impatiently and angrily; and Tom, with a reproachful glance, left him at once. Only a slender beam now hung over the flood. On this Ned started to cross, balancing himself with the axe, the group of men watching him eagerly. An inch to 'the right or to the left, and all was lost. The flames were decreasing now, yet still the beam stood. Then the boat started   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   103 out slowly across the river. The attention of all was turned towards it for an instant; and, in the mean time, lNed had almost gained the other side. One, two, three blows on the charred part of the beam, and it wavered and fell with a crash as Ned leaped lightly upon the bank. He waved his hand triumphantly, and ran down to meet the boat, which, more than half way across, was now struggling with the powerful current, and yet was visibly nearing the shore. He waved his cap, and started down the river-bank into the copse to meet it. Only two steps, two little steps down the bank, and from the tangled foliage a powerful hand grasped his throat, the cold barrel of a pistol was  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7120-00000053"/> L04   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. pressed to his cheek, and a voice fairly dissed the whisper into his ears:- "Silence! or you are a dead man!"  And for reply, with one mighty effort, he threw off the hand; and, as the pistol- shot resounded through the air, his voice rang out, clear and strong on the still night: - "BACK TO 'T'E CAMP, FOR YOUR VLIVES! THE ENEMY IS UPON US!" In an instant more he was seized; and one of the men who had crept upon him said: - "Damn  you, you hound! you have spoiled all our plans." Then :Ned smiled serenely, and looked calmly at the man.    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.  105 "But we shall bag four or five of them, any way, lieutenant," said one of the men, -"those in the boat down there." And then Ned started and turned pale; but it was too late. Tom and two others had already landed, and were in the hands of two or three of the rebel pickets. "O Tom, Tom!" cried Ned, "why did you not turn back?" But Tom did  not answer, and only stared vacantly and stupidly at Ned. "'The captain's sick, sir," said one of the men who had been captured. 'Drunk, more likely," said the rebel lieutenant, with an oath. "He was taken in the boat," continued the man.  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7120-00000054"/> 106    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. "It is as I feared," said Ned; '" he is in a high fever, as I was." At this the rebel lieutenant drew back. "Oh! it is not contagious," said Ned, with a world of scorn in his voice; and the rebel lieutenant resumed his former position. "Tom, don't you know me?" asked Ned. "Oh, what will be the end of this, I wonder!" "Libby  Prison," sneered the lieu- tenant. "Tell my mother to come and seb me at Libby," said Tom, half stupidly. Upon this the chorus naturally raised an insult- ing shout, and one poor brute indulged in some ribald remark. In an instant, Tom had struck him across the face; in ED   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   107 another instant, Tom himself lay on the ground senseless and stunned by a blow from the butt of one of the rebel rifles. It was at this instant, while Ned in anguish and desperation was struggling with his captors, that the sound of horses' hoofs was heard coming nearer and nearer, and three or four officers rode quickly up. The central figure of the group was a compact, sinewy man, of medium height, with a full, untrimmed beard, and a face, as Ned could see by the dim light of the fire which some of the men were now lighting a little distance off, furrowed with the lines of thought, of care, and anxiety. The eyes were large and expressive, the features clearly cut, and the mouth, even   &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7120-00000055"/> 108    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. though partially hidden by a thin mus- tache, showed indomitable firmness. A  grand head in many respects, and one which made it evident to Ned that he was in the presence of the dreaded Stonewall Jackson. "What is-the matter here?" he asked briefly. "They have destroyed  the bridge, -general," was the reply. Stonewall Jackson turned, and whis- perered to one of his companions who rode away. Then he continued:-- "Are these prisoners?" "Yes, general," said the lieutenant,-- - "these four."   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   109 "A lieutenant-colonel, I see?" said Stonewall Jackson. Ned  simply bowed in  reply. Then Stonewall Jackson looked at Tom, and said:-- "And who is this here?" At this, Tom half raised.. himself, and then fell back again. "May I tell you?" asked Ned. "Certainly," said' Jackson; "what is it?" "He is in a high fever, which has been' coming on for some time," said Ned; "C and one of these men struck him with the butt of his rifle." "After he had surrendered?" asked Jackson. &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7120-00000056"/> "O    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. "After he was taken prisoner," said Ned. "He shall be taken to camp and at- tended to," said Stonewall Jackson. But, when they touched Tom, he uttered a sharp cry of pain; and the men drew back. "'We will let him remain here, then," said Jackson, after a word or two more with his companions. "Lieutenant, you will keep watch here, and down the river's bank, until daybreak, and then report at head-quarters to me with the prisoners. As for you, sir," he continued, addressing Ned, "you can remain here through the night with your friend, --under parole, of   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   11l course, not to break your bonds. Do you accept?" "Most thankfully," said Ned, with a gratitude in his voice and accent far be- yond what his words expressed.

"Keep the other prisoners under strict guard, lieutenant; but treat this gentleman who is under parole with all possible respect. Hark! what is that? Midnight!" And, as he paused to listen, the distant sound of bells rang faintly out upon the air. Midnight; and for ah instant utter stillness upon air and earth and water.

And Ned thanked himn once again; and the noise of the horses' hoofs came more and more faintly, and at last died away entirely. Then Ned knelt down beside Tom, and looked steadily at him. Tom half opened his eyes, and then closed them again with a weary moan that went to Ned's very heart. "Don't you know me, Tom?" he said.

The men had built a great fire a little way apart; and its gleams fell upon Tom's face, just as the firelight had done in the Pro- fessor's room, five years before, when Ned first met him. How well he remembered that night! He laid his hand on Tom's hot brow, and smoothed back his tangled hair. How lovely his face was in this fit- ful, ruddy glow! How much he had sac- rificed for Ned, and now Ned had ruined him! It was dreadful to Ned.

"I couldn't leave Ned possibly! We've been through everything together; and he might not  be cared for properly, if I were to leave him sick and alone.

If I can only get him down to the river-bank there, where I can bathe his head." And, putting Tom's limp arm around his own neck, Ned managed with some difficulty to carry him a few steps to the river's brink. "There, Tom," he said, "I'll bathe your head for you, poor fellow!" "Here is the river," said Tom; "and we are going to see mother in a boat. It's a dangerous thing, Ned, to cross on that beam. OBEY ORDERS! And now it is too late, too late!

And now for the first time Ned saw the means of deliverance within his power. The idea  fairly swept over his mind. To put Tom  into the boat, and gain the other side, would be the work of a few moments only: and it could be done; for the rebel squad was dispersed along the shore, and the one man who sat by the fire a few yards off seemed fast asleep. But then, even as the thought of a possibility of freedom for Tom made him exultant, there came the recollection of his parole.

Without daring to think, without daring to look around him, then he lifted Tom and laid him in the boat. The keel grated on the pebbly shore. He started nervously and turned; but the faithless picket was laboriously sleeping. In an instant more he had thrown off his outer garments; and, with the rope of the boat tied around his neck, he half swam, half drifted, with the strong current down the stream. Wealk from his late sickness, and the excitement and efforts of the night, his swimming soon exshausted him; and he clung to the side of the boat, and drifted with it.

On ach side of him he saw the black trees tanding in groups, now dense, now scat- ered, along the shores; while ever in his ars was the strange murmur of the tol:- ent, broken only by Tom's incoherent auttering as he lay in the boat. Then uddenly came the sharp report of a rifle; nd he knew that his escape was dis- overed at last. He heard the bullets Whistle by him, then one grazed the side If the boat, but luckily did not come near omin. At last the firing ceased; but the )oat seemed to be drifting into a little :ove.

Then he gave one cry, as he saw the first faint gleam of dawn in the east, and the boat struck him, bruised and faint- ing, against'the shore. He crawled feebly upon the bank, the rope still around his neck; and then, stunned and bruised, all consciousness  forsook  him. The last thing which he knew was, tlat the birds were just beginning to twitter in the trees. When he awoke it was later in the day; and the warm light and air of the forenoon e' was streaming into his tent. An orderly was standing by the entrance. "Where is Tom?" he asked hoarsely.  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7120-00000064"/> 126    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. "The captain is there; " and the orderly pointed to the other side of the tent, where Ned saw a figure lying muffied in coats and blankets. He hardly dared to ask what he dreaded to learn, his voice seemed clogged and heavy in his throat; and finally, when he did speak, it was in a hoarse and tremulous whisper:-- Is he dead?" "Dead?" said the orderly, surprised; "why, no, colonell But he is dreadfully sick; and they are going to take him to the hospital, after you have seen him and spoken with him,"  "Go outside," said Ned, briefly, t' and let no one enter under any pretext whatever." And, as the orderly obeyed, he threw   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   127 himself down beside Tom, who was sleep- ing restlessly under the influence ap- parently of some opiate. He looked at him, laid his hand upon his forehead, and then bent over and kissed his hot face. "Tom,"  he said. But there was no answer, no movement. "I have come to bid you good-by, Tom," he said; "I am going back to deliver myself up." But still Tom slept, and groaned. "Not one word of good-by, Tom," said poor Ned. "And yet this is the last time - the very last time - God help me! -- that we shall see each other, that I shall see you. O my darling, my darling, my dar- ling! please hear me.

The last words that you heard from me were those of anger and impatience, and now, poor fellow! you cannot speak even to say good-by. Hear me say it. lWhen you get well again, have some memory of my bending over you and saying it, and telling you that I was saying good-by, good-by, good-by! O Tom, my darling! don't forget it.

It was the night when I determined to go to war that you gave me that picture; it was just before we enlisted. O Tom! why did I let you come at all? You will see your mother, Tom; and you will go home now, and marry, and be happy, and forget me. Oh, no, no, no, Tom! you won't do that; you can't do that.

Tom   only moaned restlessly in his sleep; and there seemed to be a painful death-like silence inside the tent, while outside was the bright life of the morning and the busy murmur of the camp. "Ah, well!" he said, " it is better so. He  would not let me go if he were conscious; he would say that I must stay with him; and that cannot be. He need not know that I am dead, as I shall be, until he him- self is well once again. Good-by, Tom! good-by! and God bless you forever, my - darling!" And calmly, yet with a dreadful pang    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.    131 at his heart, he stooped, and once more kissed the flushed face of his friend; then quickly, as if impelled by some force .not his own, without daring to look backward, he rushed from the tent. , z  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7120-00000067"/> 132     TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. * I, IX. THE BEGINNING OF THE END. "The morn broke in upon his solemn dream; And still with steady pulse and deepening eye, 'Where bugles call,' he said, ' and rifles gleam, I follow though I die.'" STONEWALL JACKSON     sat in his tent, writing  rapidly on a rough  pine table. There was in the man, in spite of his old coat stained here and there with mud, and       I his awkwardness of position and figure, an appearance of power,--power con- scious   and  self-sustaining. At a  first *   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   133 glance he seemed an old Virginia farmer; but an instant's careful scrutiny showed, beneath his awkward simplicity, the grace of a true soldier, while the slow, hesitating speech had in it an undertone which made it evident that at times each word might be charged with fire and eloquence and life. As he moved one hand to brush back the thinned hair on his temples, this hot afternoon, a staff-officer entered the tent. "I have some curious news, General," he -said. "What is it?" asked Jackson, briefly; for a word was a power with this man, and he never wasted power. "The prisoner who broke his parole  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7120-00000068"/> 134    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. this morning has returned here," said the, officer. -"What!" exclaimed Jackson, "has he given himself up?" "Yes, General; they have him in con- finement, andhe has asked to see you." - "To see me, lieutenant!" said Stonewall Jackson. "That will make no difference. He is to be shot at sunrise."  "Very well, General; " and the lieuten- ant turned to depart. "Stop a moment, though," said Jackson. "I should like to know what defence, what excuse he has to offer. Have him brought here." "Very well, General. But he is to be shot'?    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   135 w Certainly, sir!" Jackson laid down his pen, and folded his arms before him on the rough board which served him as a writing-table. He had not long to wait. In less than five minutes, Ned appeared, guarded by two soldiers, his face pale but determined. He met Stonewall Jackson's scrutinizing look clearly and fearlessly, yet respectfully. " You may withdraw," said Jackson to the men. "Now, sir, you wish to see me. What have you to say?" "I broke my parole this morning," said Ned. "I know it, sir," said Jackson; "and, having some compunction for your viola- tion  of honor, you have  tried as a  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7120-00000069"/> nanceuvre giving yourself up again. You lave made a mistake, sir." "It is just because I knew you would misconstrue my motive and my action thus that I asked to see you," said Ned. "I wish to explain." "No explanation is possible, sir," cried Stonewall Jackson; "'and this will avail you nothing." "Oh! wait a moment," cried Ned, im- petuously. "Don't deceive yourself. I know what I am doing; I knew a few hours ago, when I left the Union lines, what I was doing. I came here to die,-- to be shot! Do you hear,- to be shot! I broke my parole; I expected no m'erlcy from you,- I ask for none, I would take   TWO COLLEGE PRIENDS.;  137 none. I claim only my right, and my right is death." "Then why did you give yourself up, if you knew death must be your fate?" asked Jackson. "Death has not frightened me very much," said :Ned, contemptuously. "There is something about you," said Stonewall Jackson, t which makes me wish to respect you. I see you are not a coward."' "And I wish you to see that I am not a liar,' answered Ned. "I gave myself up to death; and I wish you to bear witness, that, having sinned, I accepted the pen- alty."  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7120-00000070"/> "But why sill?" said Stonewall Jack- son. "I will tell you why," said Ned. "I have only one person in the world to care for. I have no family, no relatives, only this one friend. He was all the world to me, and I was something to him. aWhen the war broke out, I enlisted, and he went with me. 'We have been side by side    i through everything. He saved my life in battle at the risk of his own; and a few  weeks ago, when I was taken sick by fever, and he had a leave of absence, he gave up his home, he sacrificed every- thing, to watch by me. Last night he was   taken sick while with the party at the bridge, when in another day he would    have been with his mother at Washington. You paroled me. I was left there with him, and he raved and groaned nntil I could bear it no longer. Every word he said seemed to stab me to the heart. Then I saw the river and the boat; the men were scattered, and the means of es- cape were at hand.  I  hesitated. I thought of my parole; and then I thought of him a prisoner, an invalid, a corpse per- haps, if he waited here, while back of us his mother was hastening to meet her only son.  He had given up so much for me, and what had I done for him?  It seemed as if I must get him away; and then he cried out again, Ned, Ned, won't you help me?' And I said,'Yes!' And I  knew  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7120-00000071"/> "O    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. that yes was death to me. Oh! you see I am prepared.

I ask no mercy; and you could give me none if you wished it: my act must bring its conse- quences. Only I wished you to see that I was neither liar nor coward; that, having forfeited my life, I did not evade the pay- ment of my debt; in a word, that I was enough of a gentleman to be worthy of   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   141 the great privileoge of serving in my coIn- try's cause." "Sir," said Jackson, "you are not only a gentleman, but a soldier. I love war for itself, I glory in it; but it saddens ,ne when it brings with it the useless sacrifice of such a life as yours." "I am not a soldier,"said Ned, quietly. "I hate war; I hate to have to long for the death of such a man as you are. But I am ready for all that, when there is a cause at stake.", "A cause at stake'!" said Stonewall Jackson. "Well, God be with the right!" "'God is with the right," said Ned; "and time will show us which is the  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7120-00000072"/> right. Ahl if I could live to see that tithe! "Be thankful rather," said Jackson, "that you are going to die before you find you are in the wrong. I wish you had been with me in this campaign." "If it had been possible," said Ned, and then he stopped. I shothd lilke," said Stonewall Jackson, slowly, "though doubtless you consider me a rebel and a traitor, to have you shake hands with me." "Not with a rebel or a traitor," said Ned, "but with a sincere and honest man whom I respect and honor; " and with this grip of hands, these two great souls gazed in each other's eyes.   "And now you know what I must say," said Stonewall Jackson. "I know it," Ned replied. Do not think me cruel, do not think me lacking in human feeling," Stonewall Jackson continued; " but war has its du- ties as well as peace. God help those who must execute these duties!" "There is but one thing you can do," said Ned, tranquilly. "There is but one thing I can do," re- peated Jackson. "You will be shot at sunrise." He called the men  outside. "Give this gentleman," he said, "as good accommodations as the camp affords.

"In that case," said  Jackson, with princely courtesy, "I have only to say farewell." He rose agarin, and took Nel's hand; then the soldiers marched away, and he was left in his tent alone.

DEAR P1ROFESSOR,-I am writing to you the last words I shall ever say, -the last thoughts I shall ever think, the last farewell to all I have ever known and loved. To-morrow, at daybreak, I am to be shot. There is nothing that can possi- bly prevent it,%- this is my last night on earth.  Am I resigned to my lot? am I willing to lose my life? I cannot tell, it seems so like a dream.  It is terrible to me to think that this is the end of all my youth and hope; and  you will un-  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7120-00000074"/> "6    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS. derstand me when I say that I do dread and fear death. Yet I am. calm and self- possessed. Iam half dead already, indeed, for my end seems inevitable; and I do not suffer so much as I wonder. I seem to have lost all volition, and, as it were, to have gone out of myself. A little while ago I wound up my watch; and then the uselessness of that performance struck me, and I said, half aloud, "Poor Ned!" and then laughed at myself for doing it. As my laugh died away, there was a cold si- lence around which chilled me through and through. Yes, I must be half dead already. It is only when I think of Tom that the life seems to rush back again; and as I believe this sort of torpor is well for   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.  147 me, I dare not trust to myself write to him. Besides, he must get well; and so you must try and keep my death hidden from him for a time. You can tell him, better than I could, that my last thought will be of him, and that I cannot trust myself to say farewell to him. Even now, I have this cruel uncertainty (about his health, and I do not know but what you may lose us both. Stonewall Jackson is a hero. I never thought that I could say that of any rebel, but I am glad that I have known him. He will work us more terrible injury, I fear; but I am sure that he will not live long. The excitement of this war is killing him; and here, when I so thoroughly admire him, I have to rejoice that he is doomed.  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7120-00000075"/> How   strange war is,- stranger and stranger now than ever! Oh! if I could only see the end,- if I could only know whether we shall gain our country by all this blood, and if Tom will live, I could die perfectly contented. There is Tom again, you see. I have to think of him in spite of myself. When you tell him my story, you can give him this letter, if he wants it, as perhaps he will. And now good-by for yourself. It is not well for me to write, --it brings me back to life too much; but I cannot die without telling you something of my feeling for you. Do you think that I have not fully appreciated all your sympathy, all your kindness, all the wealth of intellect and   culture which you have laid before me? I always have had a sort of hope, that some time, when I should win some great honor, and the world should applaud,. I could say, "Look here; here is the man to whom I owe all this; here is the man who advised me, who guided me; the man with the strong soul and the woman's tenderness, who loved youth and beauty, and sympa- thized with sorrow. You take off your i hats to me; but I kneel before him." But all that is over now, and- you have only a numb good-by from  a man who is to be shot in a few hours. My body will not be sent NNorth. When I am dead, I am dead; and here or there, it matters not where it is buried, to me nor  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7120-00000076"/> 150    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.       5 to any one else. But if you ever want to think of me, ana to feel that I am near, walk through the yard at Harvard, over by Holworthy, in the lovely evenings of the spring  weather. It was at such a season, and at such a time, that I last saw  the dear old place; and, if I ever can 'be anywhere on earth again, it is there that I should choose to be. Ah, if I could only see Harvard once again! God bless it forever and forever! I wonder how many visions of its elm-trees have swept before dying eyes here in Virginia battle-fields! Ah, well! there is only good-by to say once more. When he asks for me, tell him that I constantly think of him, that I   TWO COLLEGE TRIENDS.   151 am well and happy. Don't let him know the truth until he is clearly out of danger, and then tell him all. It is not so very hard to bear; and I am sure now that I shall never be forgotten by him, and that nothing can ever come between us now. Tell him the only thing, after God, worth living for and worth dying for, is our country,--our noble country. Oh! she must be strong and glorious acnd united, at any cost. I feel it and I know it. And now good-by, once more and forever. He sealed and directed the letter; then, throwing himself on the blanket in the corner of the tent, fell into a deep, re- freshing slumber. He woke to feel the  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7120-00000077"/> grasp of a hand upon his shoulder, to see a file of men beside him. Without a word he rose and went with them. They led him out a little from the camp, where it seemed quiet. He saw them stand before him; he heard one preliminary order given, and caught the flash of rifle-barrels in the early morning sunlight. Then there was a noise and disturbance in the camp be- yond, and a voice cried out:-- "It's an attack by the Federals!" Ned turned involuntarily. And with these words, in one great sweeping flood, his life came back. No more numbness, no more indifference; but, in that one instant, every drop of blood in his veins seemed charged with electric power, and   the morning air was like nectar. He stood there, strong, lilke a man; and then there was one report, and he fell dead,--dead in the dust of the Virginia soil.  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7120-00000078"/> 154    TWO COLLEGE -FRIENDS. , XL e AFTERWARDS.       '  THS is the one picture that has been  , ever before my eyes, even in the wild   ' regions of Nevada and the undulating lawns and woody slopes of California. In  S the snow-clad forests of the Sierra Neva- . da, and even in the tropical glory of sky ! and air in Arizona, amid the noise and bustle of the camp, with heavenly peace and loveliness above, and murderous   savages, thirsting for our blood lying in l deadly ambush all around, I still have seen this picture. A dead man lying with   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   155 his face to the earth; while close by his side one little spot of dust seems blackened and congealed by blood. And afterwards? The sunshine steals softly and furtively through the darkened windows of a happy Northern home. It is June, and the perfume of the roses is on the air. In an easy-chair half sits, half reclines, a pale girl, with a happy face, looking down with a perfect smile at Tom, who sits at- her feet. And near by stands a nurse, holding in her arms a baby, - a baby whose two gelatinous arms beat the air wildly, while his voice is raised in a shrill note, which may be triumph or which may be agony. "By Jove"Tom says admiringly, "t his &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7120-00000079"/> TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.        high notes are stunning; ar'n't they, Nettie?" "Tom," replies Nettie, threateningly, "dare to make fun of your offspring again, and we will leave you, and start for In- diana. Won't we, Baby?" To this question, reply is given by an absurd inclination of the head on one side and another wheezy shriek. t I am not laughing, I am not laughing," Tom hastens to remark, lest the threat of Indiana should be repeated; "so don't get angry, Baby. I say, Nettie, we must have a name for him. We can't call him Baby all the time, you know." "He was named' long ago, Tom," said Nettie, ' though of course I had to wait.   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.   157 We must call him 'Ned;' we couldn't call him by any other name." "Thank  you, darling,"   said  Tom, gravely; "that is the way you make me love you more and more every day."  And he kisses his wife, and, rising, takes the baby and looks on its face, while his eyes are filled with tears. And afterwards?  The Professor's room at Harvard is still as it was when we first knew it, with the photograph still hanging over the mantel-piece. And the Pro- fessor sits there gazing at it more lonely now  than ever before. HHe is growing quite old; he is very sarcastic and aston- ishing; and  dreadful stories are current  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7120-00000080"/> among  the students in regard to his severity against culprits in the meetings of the Faculty. There are two or three who know him, and to whom he is very kind. They heard him tell the story of his boys, and they heard poor Necl's last letter. But the Professor declared then that he should never speak of the subject again; and the few who heard hin saw that the rest of his life must be sad. And now, as he takes up the notes and emen- dations of his old lecture on "Dolestic Arts," whose turn has come again, his eye falls on the picture. Again it is the spring weather, again the fresh breeze enters his room. He rises and walks to the window.   "I wonder if he is near," he says, half aloud. "t was in such a season and at such a time, that I last saw the dear old place; and, if ever I can be on earth again, it is there that I should wish to be.' Poor Ned! Poor Ned!  And; as he sits in his chair again, the picture fades from my view, and I see only the moonlight on our mountain camp, and hear the wailing of the western wind. And   afterwards?  Once more the country is intact, freed from the deadly perils which assailed her. We know now what the words ' our country"' mean, -- rocks which the Atlantic lashes with its spray; broad uplands and vast prairies where almost spontaneously fruit and  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7120-00000081"/> 160    TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.  grain seem to spring forth from the rich soil; and barren hills as well, with only the sage-brush for vegetation, within whose secret treasure-houses lie great masses of gold and silver ore. From the summits of the Sierra Nevada you can stand at midsummer in a forest where wreaths of snow lie on the trees, and can gaze far down into valleys, thousands of feet be-" neath, where there are rippling streamlets, and masses of flowers of the most brilliant and the most delicate hues. This wonder- ful country, that is still in its infancy, that is nursing men of every nation to form a new nation; this country, that, with all its imperfections, stands now on the grand basis of universal freedom, -justifies not   TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS.      161 merely enthusiasm, but any loss of human life which  may  aid in its preservation. These friends, these brothers, knew what was the true meaning of life, and with that knowledge, gained by zeal and study, offered their lives as a sacrifice.  Woe to our country should the great debt owed to these heroes be ever forgotten! "May God forbid that yet, Or in all time to come, we should 'their names forget! May every spring-time's hours See their graves strewn with flowers, To show that still remembered is our 'debt!"  &#xD;</p>
