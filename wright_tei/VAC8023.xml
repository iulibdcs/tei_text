'OH E1   MAN WHOM EVERYBODY SNUBBED. I   LAST year, as every body will recollect, New England -was visited with a terrible snow storm, which not only suspended travel for the time being, but put an embargo upon business in general. Railroad trains were snowed up at out-of-the-way sta- tions; and travelers, with private conveyances, were detained for days at lonely farm-houses. Business called me across the northern' part of Connecticut; and as the public conveyances could not be made to subserve my convenience, I was traveling with my own horse and sleigh. The storm overtook me while on the road between Windsor and Putnam. I awoke in the morn- ing to learn that it had not only been snowing for several hours, but that the light, feathery flakes still filled the air, while a fierce wind from- the southeast was fast driving the volatile element here and there into huge drifts. Having but little fear for the results of a New Eng- land snow, however, I determined to press on, hoping to reach my destina- tion by dark at all events. With each additional mile the snow became deeper and more drifted ; but I had a good horse, and resolved not to halt until I was obliged to. Early in the afternoon I overtook a lone pedestrian, slowly   plodding along the almost forsaken highway. I stopped and offered him a seat in my sleigh. He gladly ac- cepted it, stating that he had en- gaged a livery team to convey him to Putnam, but becoming discouraged after going a few miles, the driver had set him down in the road and re- traced his steps. The stranger was trying to reach the town on foot. al- though greatly fatigued. When within about ten miles of my destination the drifts became so formidable that I could urge my wearied beast no farther. Night was coming on apace;- and I re- marked to my companion that we must get out and lead the creature to the next dwelling, in hopes of secur- ing shelter until morning. Fortunate- ly a glance down the highway revealed the outline of what I took to be a farm-house, near the  road-side. Jumping from the sleigh, we man- aged to urge the horse to the gate, and up the short side-lane towards the house. As we neared the dwelling, how- ever, I discovered in its surroundings the appearance of wealth, if not aris- tocracy; and, making a feint to turn my horse about, I involuntarily ex- claimed: "There is too great a show of worldliness here to warrant hospitali-  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC8023-00000003"/> ty to such as we are, my friend. I'd rather brave the snow-drifts again than seek it." Before my companion could reply the wide side-door was thrown open, and a well-dressed man of forty made his appearance. He bade us" good- evening" iin a cheery tone, anticipated our misfortunes by a considerate reference to the unforseen contingen- cies of so rare a storm, condoled with us over the annoyance of being hin- dered in our journey, and begged us to accept the hospitality of his home until the weather should permit us to travel. We thanked him, and gladly ac- cepted his invitation. I gave up my horse to a boy, and we followed our host into the hall. After removing our overcoats and brushing the snow ; from our boots, we were led into the E warm, well-furnished parlor. Lights were ordered, and soon I brought in.  My attention was drawn I to my traveling companion, who all ( at once seemed rather ill at ease; he \ fixed his eyes firmly upon our host t for a moment; then quickly dropping t them  to the floor, a shadow passed v over his face.          a "What may I   call your name?" the host asked him, taking a seat be- v side us, evidently with the intention st of entering into conversation .8( lie answered in a  low tone, butI ha understood. him to say " Benton." t( "And yours?" to me.     le "Thomas," I  replied.    hi "Thank you both. My name is Wilkinson. It is well to know names, cl even if we remain strangers still. cc Besides, I  shall want to introduce you is to my family." When the host pronounced  his pe name, Benton gave another quick, ni nervous look; and  he remained in quiet while Mr. Wilkinson and I pro- Ai ceeded to compare notes.     an Our host said that he was born in the Western New York, where he also married, but had removed to his pres- do   I'd ent home. Here he engaged in manu- lin facturing, and had been very success- ful. My Manifesting as he did such confi- nn, dence'in us, and such candor in refg de erence to his own affairs, I made )d- known my business to him. Advan- ed ces so frank on his part proved that Lte he was to be regarded as a friend n- rather than a stranger. Even the" th seemingly taciturn Benton was drawn n- out, and was soon conversing with Us Mr. Wilkinson with all the familiarity ie of an  old acquaintance. Indeed, to long before supper was announced I was ready to pronounce him one of c- the most genial men I had ever met; y and, notwithstanding the fact that I r had been thrown upon his hospitality g by the force of circumstances, I felt N as much at home as if we had been e schoolmates. i *Ere long Mrs. Wilkinson came in. n She was rather above the medium a height. She possessed a calm blue 1 eye and welltcut features; but she d was lovely rather than beautiful. By t the easy grace of her manners, and , the cordial seconding of her husband's I welcome, I saw that she was as much a lady as he was a gentleman. Just as tea was announced a ser- vant entered, saying there was a stranger at the door who wished to^:-' 'see the gentleman of the house. We had stepped out into the hall to pass to the supper-room, when the host left us standing, begging us to excuse him for a moment. "Good-evening, "  said a figure, closely wrapt in a fur cap and over- coat. ' Can you tell me how far it is to a public house?" "It is a good two miles, sir. Im- possible for you to reach there' to- night. The snow is drifted terribly in that direction. Will you walk in?" And Mr. Wilkinson  stepped aside and waved his hand invitingly toward the light and warmth withinl. "  Thank you. But I have a horse down here in the road. He can wal-   low through, I guess," replied the stranger, pulling his coat closer y around him, and, with a bow, turning 1 to go away. ,'The going, Sir, is worse for t beast than for man, and I advise you to proceed no farther to-night. In- 1 deed, I should not feel easy to have you go away. from my door under the. circumstances. There are two trav- I elers here already who have just ac- i cepted quarters for the night; and, i if you come in, you. anrd they may l sympathize with and console each other in your kindred misfortunes."  And the host turned toward Benton and myself, and gave utterance to a complacent laugh. ' Thank you--thank you, Sir. Your welcome is not to be slighted. I will lead up my horse, and then ac- cept a corner in your dwelling ; " and the traveler was about to descend the steps. "Stop, Sir; my man  will take care of vour horse. Walk in." The stranger was'almost draggedI into the hall by the sanguine Ilost, who assisted him in removing his outside coat and over-shoes. He was then led to the bllazing fire in the parlor. In a moment he declared himself perfectly comnfortable. ("Now for supper," said the host. "I find myself in Connecticut to- day for the first time in my life, Sir," added the stranger, touching Mr. Wilkinson significantly upon the shoulder; "and if this is a sample of the hospitality that grows out of vour blue-laws and steady-habits, 1 shall hereafter regard the State as a Paradise for snowed-up, benighted travelers." A laugh all round was the only re- sponse this sally called forth. My fellow-travelers and myself were now seated with the family (two small children besides the par- ents) at the bountifully-spread supper table, where we were at once made to feel perfectly at home.   The new-comer proved to be a young lawyer-from the West, and, like myself, was only a few miles from his destination. His name, he told us, was Gates. Supper over, our host led us into 5 his library, and placing cigars before us, said: "Now, gentlemen, I wish you to make  yourselves at home. Let neither of you entertain the slighteast feeling of enmbarrassment because you are to-night the guest of a stranger against your will. Perhaps I'd bet- ter say (for it many lead you indirect- ly to becomne more reconciled to your. fate) that my two boys started this nmorning to return to their scllool at Hartford, but at noon I received a tel grlnam from them stating that the trlain was blocked up at Plainfield, and thley would probably have to re- maifn at the station 'all night. An agent of mine left hlere last night on imnportant business in Providence, butthis afternoon I was notified by tclgraph tIhat lie is quarter,:d in a private family a t Quidnic, unable to lproceed falrther. Alhother agent, also on11 pressing business, is blocked up at Worcester ; and 1 verily believe that not a single railroad train in this part of' New England has gone its full route to-day.' I; You offer these facts, I presume, as evidence of your faith in the truth of' the ld adae. '  Misery loves com- pany? ' said Gates, with a smile. 'Yes, yes," gayly returned Mr. ' Wilkinsonl; "and for fear that may not be effectual in setting you wholly ; at ease, I laml disposed to'offer a lit- tle philosophy. Some men seem to be snow-bound all their lives. No sooner do they embark upon an en- terprise than something turns up to f frustrate their plans. However hope- r ful and enegetic they may be, they - never attain success." ' r  ' That is so,' continued Gates. e  There is a man in our' section who never met with a real success, how-  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC8023-00000004"/> ever insignificant, dependent upon his own efforts, in his life. More than that, nobody ever shows him any respect. There is something in his very mien that repels all venera- tion, and every body takes the liberty to snub him when opportunity occurs Although he is rk-h (his property was all inherited), and can buy out half a dozen of his wealthiest neigh- bors, there's not a laborer in the township who ever, speaks of or to him in any other than a tone of con- ternmpt." "4 His history must be remarkable. Let us hear it," said our host. "Certainly; the narrative proba- bly will help us to forget our anxieties, and serve to while away this long winter evening," I ventured to say. Gates lighted a fresh cigar and commenced: -- The story I am about to tell is a kind of bar-room and country-grocery tradition, as the principal events oc- curred some twenty years since.  I have never seen any of the parties excepting the hero, although I  be- lieve they are all still living, as well as the hero and his wife. I am in- debted to a brother lawyer, living- in the immediate vicinity, for the narra- tive. Hugh   Winterblossom, of Cross- c ville, moved into Blanktown  years s ago, bought an  estate,--and settled X down to enjoy  life. He possessed a t large property inherited from his E father, but he never engaged in any i stated business from first to last. His d neighbors frequently said he  knew hI only enough to cling to what wealth g lie owned, and the more spiteful of tE them declared he was only a few re- si moves from anatural fool. Marry- E ing a  woman almost as weak-minded cl as himself, supposing  her to be so wealthy he- was sorely disappointed in to learn, after the knot was tied, that he had made a   sad mistake-she af hadn't a  dollar.        c}   )on  Old Winterblossom, as he is gener- )re ally called, is a singular specimen of im humanity, both physically and men- in tally. Physically, he  might be ra- classed with the genus (" stubby ; " for rty he is short and thick-set in the whole rs and in all his parts. His head is ty large, but short and deficient in brain. mut With a short, stout body, and limbs h- of like proportions, one can not help he thinking that Nature was arrested to in her work while moulding him, and n- failed to draw and finish his franme so elaborately as she first designed. e. His shaggy brows, covered with long, gray hair, project over and shadow a- his stern, stony-looking eyes; his s, nose is large and broad at the base, ig with wide nostrils; his long upper y. lip bulges out and hangs over the id lower, one, giving his large mouth any thing but a prepossessing ap- pearance; and his square, half-sha- a ven chin is short, maintaining its uni- y formity with his other features. i- -With such rugged lineaments ai phy- I siognomist undoubtedly would have ,s given him a character of the most in- - domitable determination and  fixed-  1l ness of purpose; but, in reality, he is - an ignorant, vacillating, pusillani- n mous rider of hobbies-a  victim of - the most errant whims. Having no respect for the rights and feeling of:' - others, every body by common con- s sent seems to regard him as a kind of I traveling Absalom's Pillar, at which ithey may unhesitatingly throw the stones of their contempt for all that is odious in human propensities. In- deed, Nature seems to have violated her usual rules in his formation; she generally stamps a person's charac- ter on his exterior, but Winterblos- som's destiny was put in lieu thereof. He was snubbed by Nature, and in consequence was  doomed -to  be snubbed by all with whom he came in contact. Old Winterblossom's first exploit after he settled in Blanktown was a cheese speculation. A farmer be-   came indebted to him for a small m amount, and, being short of cash, of- w fered to turn over to the old man a hi lot of cheese-about three hundred at pounds. Rather than run any risk s1 by waiting, Winterblossom took the d: cheese. But it was valueless unless h he could get it to market, the nearest d one being Buffalo-twenty  miles h away. One morning his neighbor, s James Wilson, was passing, on his way to the city with a small lot of d butter. Hailing him, Hugh, asked what he would charge to carry three r hundred pounds of cheese too Buffalo. "How many poun's did you say?" i returned Wilson.  "Three hundred." * *"Wa'al, about-a cent a poun' will 1 be the fair thing, I guess," deliberated the farmer, dallying with his whip  across the back of his well-fed horse. "Too much. That 'll 'mount to three dollars; and you're going right there." "That's so; but that shouldn't make no difference; You couldn't git Sheriff Pullet to hang you for any- thin' less 'n his reg'lar fee, even ef he used the same gallers on which he was goin'to hang me at the same time; an' yeou couldn't hire a man to go a- purpose to carr' that cheese for twice that 'mount. Howsomever, neigh- bor Winterblossom, I'll tell yeou what I'll do; I'll carr' them cheese on the follerin' terms, to wit, as the lawyers say: yeou pay me one mill for the fust mile; two mills for the secon,' four mills for the third, an' so on, doublin' on each mile up to twenty." "Yaas, I'll do that," returned Winterblossom, without the least hes- itation, chuckling in his sleeve at the prospect of " shaving"Wilson, and getting his cheese to market for a very trifling sum. It is very obvious from this tran- saction that Winterblossom knew but little of the rudiments even of mathematics, to say nothing of Geo.   metrical Progression. His accounts were always submitted to a niece of his living with him, and at this time attending the district school. So, as she arose from the dinner-table that day, he stated the cheese bargain to her, and asked how much would be due Wilson on his return. Taking her slate, she in a few minutes an- swered, One . thousand and  forty-eight dollars fifty-seven and a half cents." "The d-ogs! Must have made a mistake," exclaimed Winterblossom. "No, uncle ; that is impossible; for it is a very simple problem. Look here, and I'll show you how it is done."' ,( Thunder and Mars! Don't care I how it is done. Will be jest like i Wilson to stick out for the thousand e odd dollars; but I've one 'vantage  over him--thar wa'nt no witnesses o to the barg'in." t  When  this story  leaked out t" cheese " was on every bodly's tongue, t and for months afterwards it rang in 't old Hugh's ears continually. -  Winterblossom's nearest neighbor e is Daniel Thornton. Born in the is town, he has grown up into an honest, ; upright citizen, and enjoys the re- R- spectand confidence of every person :e in the county. A practical farmer, a i- thorough mechanic, and capable of ,u turning his hand to almost any ordi- se nary persuit, hi; opinion is regarded ie as conclusive in all matters of local ill economy and utility. But he is much- ie given to recreation. No man in the so neighborhood can beat him at hunt- to ing, fishing, trapping wild pigeons, and gathering wild honey. ed  Having no business to occupy his -s- hands, and being of a disposition he that demanded some hobby on which Id to air his semi-stagnant ideas, old a Winterblossom began to ape Thorn- ton in his various recreative pursuits. xn- Every hoby praised the skill and ac- 3w .complishments of Daniel, and to be of able to outvie him seemed to be the eo. height of Hugh's ambition.  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC8023-00000005"/> During the first spring of his resi dence in  Blanktown he   closelj watched Daniel's manoeuvres for trapping pigeons, declaring repeated. ly that he could catch birds as well as Thornton. Winterblossom passed the whole summer in boring his neighbor about how it was done, and in getting his nets ready. At length, when spring and the pigeons came again, he prepared for extensive operations. One day the air was filled with birds. Thornton quietly adjusted his apparatus, while his rival took up his quarters in the next field, having every advantage of situation. A large flock was toled down by Winterblossom's dicoys; he sprang his traps, and captured half a dozen birds. Daniel then called the flock in his direction, and in a very few minutes secured over four thousand birds. Hugh was mad- dened with chagrin; and, after re- peated efforts, he gage up in despair, spitefully declared that Dan Thorn- ton had bewitched all the pigeons in the county. For months afterwards this ex- ploit of Winterblossom's was taunt- ingly thrown into his face by man, , woman, and child. It wa s no uncom- mon thing fora ragged laborer to stop. him in the road and crack a  joke at the expense of some of the 1 old man's foibles; and it was the a boast of many a dirty-faced urchin s that, from the retreat of some stone- c wall or hedge, he had "asked old r Winterposey how the pigeon bis'ness r was. During the summer Thornton fre- 3 quently interspersed his seasons of to toil in field and work-shop (for he h was a wheel-wright as well as farmer) with a-day's sport along the trout- sE brook witlh hook and line, or through f( the forest with rifle. And he al- at ways met with good   success-not do through luck, as his still persistent es imitator affirmed, but because he was hi a careful student-of the habits of the ar   si- game he sought. He always returned ly with a well-filled bag, while his sple- or netic rival's oft-repeated tramps only d- resulted in weariness and disappoint- as ment. he  After the autumn harvests Thorn- or ton commenced operating for wild ig honey. His manner of procedure was that usually pursued by bee-hun- le ters: he would bait a fugitive bee )r with honey, note the line he took in Le returning to his hive, and then fol- n low him up. One day, after recon- e noitring for a few hours, he succeeded e in finding five nests, from which, on )f the following day, he took upwards of d a hundred and fifty pounds of honey. When   Winterblossom  heard of i this his eyes opened with astonish- i ment, and he determined to watch 1 hornton's movements and learn the rknack of hunting bees. It was Daniel's custom to devote - his leisure hours to bee-hunting, and when he   had found a number of nests, take a day for felling the trees and securing the spoils. It is a rule among/hunters, when a " bee-tree" is identified, for the finder to score it with his initials, and this mark is considered a  sacred title to the honey by all honest men. Finding a nest, one day, on his own land, but provokingly near Wi:i- "' terblossom's line, Daniel hesitated about marking it. It was in plain sight of his neighbor's chamber win- dows, and he feared that the old sin- ner was not only watching his move- ments, but that he would take the first opportunity to pilfer the honey. However, Thornton finally decided to mark it, and keep a keen eye on his neighbor's manaeuvres. Having no children, Winterblos- som had adopted a niece (already re- ferred to), whose parents were poor and living in a distant town. His design was to make her his sole heir- ess, providing she never disregarded his wishes. But, unknown to him, an intimacy had existed between the   niece and a young man living near her former home. When the fact eventually came to her uncle's knowledge he declared he would put a stop to their intercourse, at the same time forbidding her ever to al- low the youth to visit her. However, he was growing up into a promising young man, and Janette could not well forget her first love; so a clan- destine correspondence was main- tained by them, each hoping that the old man would consent to their union. But they were doomed to disap- pointment in that respect. As old Winterblossom dabbled in every thing' it is not strange that he should try his clumsy hand at-match-making. For a long time he had had lhis eye upon a young man in the town where lie formerly resided, whom he de- signed Janette should marry; and when she -had reached a suitable age Julius Bently was invited by Hugh to make him a visit for the purpose of becoming acqunainted with his niece. The young man was wealthy, and this fact fully satisfied old Win- terblossom. Although there was nothing objectionable in his appear- ance or character, the girl could -re- gard him only with common polite- -.ess and courtesy, because her love was given to another. [Just at this moment Mrs. Wilkin- son entered the library for a book. But the young lawyer was so wrapped up with his story that he did not no- tice, what I could not help remark- ing, that she was confused to a greater degree than could have been occa- sioned by the mere conviction that she was causing a momentary inter- ruption of the narrative; nor did he see the peculiar glances she and her husband exchanged. Benton's con- duct, too, arrested my attention; for he had partly turned his back upon Gates, and seemed intent on reading the titles of the volumes on the shelves 2   near him; and so the lawyer went on with his story: J It was about thiis time (while Win- terblossom was operating flor honey) that Julius Bently visitcd lllanktown. The old man  received him  with marked attention, and entertained him like a lord. Hugh proved to be a very exact- ing host. He compelled hisi'vest to accommpany him on all his excursions, and made him a confidant in all the little hobbies and whims of' his dwar- fish brailn. Of course  Winterblos- som's society and confidences must have been in the main detestable to a younyg man of Julius's make; but it was evident tht lie liked the appear- anceof Janette. and endleavored to', tolerate her uncle for the tinle being in hopes of vinning  her in the end. For at least twenty  times a day the old curmudlge6n would slap his guest on the shoulder, and, withl a conceited chuckle, exclaim : "Yaas, yaas, Julius ; she's a little offish now, 'cause she's young; but jest keep up a good heart, my boy, and you'll come out all right by-'n-by. I'll warrant that." As Thornton feared, Winterblos- som was not long in seeking oult his last bee-tree. Regarding the half- decayed oak with covetous eyes for a moment   or two, Hugh remarked to Bentley, who had accompanied him: "Pretty  close to my line, Julils. Not much chance for old Thornton to make a fihss if I chop it down-; but guess we'll take it some day when he's away from 110om." Such tan opp)ornitity occurred' that very afternoon. Daniel passed on his way to mnill with several secks of grain. To  ascertain how  long  he -probably would ,be gone, old ITugh resorted to a  little stratergy. Ice hailed his neighbor Nwith- ' "Hallo, Thornton! take a   grist for me?"  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8023-00000006"/> "Certainly," Daniel returned, reining up. "'Spect to wait for your grists? "Yes, for we're nearly out of both flour and meal. " "Wa'll, do as you please 'bout waiting for mine," he added, as the hired man threw a couple of sacks into the farmer's wagon. "John can go for it to-morrow, if you don't bring it." Reaching the mill, D&amp;niel found the stones all taken up and the: mil- ler and his assistants engaged in pick- ing them. So he left his load and re- turned immediately. As he neared the house he discovered a heavy smoke in the direction of his timber. Thinking all was not right, he stopped his horse and cut across lots in a great hurry. Winterblossom and his hired man t were engaged in burning a clearing E adjoining Daniel's timber, and the wind was fast driving the flanles tow- t ards his bee-tree. At a glance the d farmer saw it was'the old scamp's de- a sign to let the fire reach the trunlk, I burn it down (which would have been an inevitable result, as it was h quite dry), and then he could secure tl the honey and leave the flames to w complete their work.  The affair s( would then lhave the appearance of' di an accident, while Thornton would a have no positive proof that the sac, ja charine contents of the old oak had tr been pilfered.          I, Thornton restrained his anger, and in without uttering a single word to his w crafty neighbor, at once proceeded to sa head off the advancing  element. th This accomplished, lie hastened to the house and soon returned with an axe fiv and two pails. Felling the tree, he on very leisurely gathered up the honey. wl Old Hugh approached and looked on on with envious eyes while his neighbor he skirmished with the bees.    so0 "Quite a haul, friend Thornton, " bi said the old sinner.       IoU "Yes," Daniel returned, in a sar- has   led, castle tone; " but I shouldn't have been so much in- a hurry about gath- 3?" ering it if I'd had honest neighbors. oth Bees will work for two weeks yet, " "If my fire had got into that tree out 'twould 'a made quick work with the your honey;" and the old fellow Aks tried to look very funny. lan Daniel had to bite his lips to keep ng from   boiling over; but having al- ready decided upon a plan for re- nd venge, he resolved to have no alterca- il- tion with the unreasonable man. So, :k- after a pause, he said: re- "Mr. Winterblossom, I found an- ed other tree yesterday, and from the vy appearance of things I should judge r. there was a hundred weight of stutf Ad in it."  a  "A   hundred weight o' honey in one tree! I declare, you do have n the luck of it!"Hugh exclaimed in Ig astonishment, "But where is it?" e  "Oh, you want to let your fire run 7- that way, don't you? But it's in the e direction of the huckleberry swamp; - and if you find it you're smarter than :, I take you to be. " e  Daniel carried his honey to the s house, and then glided down toward e the  swamp. Winterblossom's eyes ) were upon him. Approaching a big, r sound hemlock, upward of six feet in f' diameter, which stood on the la'u or0- I a neighbor, the farmer pulled out his jack-knife and cut his initials on the i trunk. Turning to retrace his steps, he caught a glimpse of Hugh dodg- Iing  into a thicket. This was just what Daniel wanted.  He was now satisfied that his tormentor would bite the bait set for him. The next morning Daniel arose at five o'clock, and sat down to study on some machinery he was contriving, when he heard the sound of an axe on the still air of dawn. Listening, le heard it again and again. The sound came from the direction of the big hemlock. Giving utterance to a loud laugh, he seized his hat and hastened toward the spot. Crawling   up as near as he could without being  observed, he concealed himself be- i hind the trunk of a tree, and recog- nized old Winterblossom and Julius Bently, stripped to their shirts and pants, chopping away on the big hemlock as if for dear life. It was as much as Daniel could do to keep from laughing outright. They paused in their work; and our listening friend heard the following: "Few more blows will fetch her, Julius; but it's been an all-night job with us, my boy;" and Winterblos- som pulled out his old watch and scanned it by the advancing daylight. "Why, it's half past five--we've been at work over eight hours. " "It will be a dear job, too, if Wil- son should prosecute us for felling this fine tree," was Bentley's reply. "Prosecute us! Why, ain't old Thornton's name on it? and won't that be the strongest kind of evidence ag'inst him?" Chip! chip! chip! went the axes again, and in a few minutes the tree fell. with a fearful crash. But the choppers were so far from any house that they feared no disturbance at that early hour. "Now for the honey!" said Win- terblossom, in a triumphant tone, walking up the prostrate trunk to look for the supposed hlollow that should contain the sweet compound. A fifteen-minutes' closest scrutiny of all parts of the trunk and boughs proved the tree to be perfectly sound, affording not the slightest retreat for bees. It was then that Daniel real- ized the truth of the old adage, "List- eners hear no good of themselves," for curses both loud and deep fell upon his head alike from the lips of old Hugh and his victimized companion. For full five minutes they stormed away, until the surrounding trees seemed to bow their heads in horror Then picking up their axes and the vessels designed to contain the honey these amateur bee-hunters walked   quickly away, tho the elast was already streaked with coming sunlighlt. "Shall I help you carry your honey, Mr. Winterblossom?" asked Daniel, in a tone of the bitterest ,1ar- casm, crossing their path and retreat- ing toward his liouse. Another volley of curses wao, all the response old Hlugh made.-. Bentley's countenance fell. "Now this 'll be known all over the neighborhood before night," mut- tered the clhagrined Julius, who wish- ed from the bottom ot'hllis heart he never had seen old Winterblossom. t"Let himin tell it! There are two of us, and our words 'il go as f'ar in court or community as hs'n, I guess. Let him tell it if he dare!" As Winterblossom nearecd his man- sion his sleepy eyes fell upon the figure of his spouse, standing upon the door-step with disheveled locks and troubled air. Evidently she was very much excited. "Whereve you been all night, you old fool? A pretty husband you are to steal off in this way!"' she vehe- mently exclaimed, as soon as the old t man came  within hearing. "' That poor Hoptown good-for-nothing has - .been here, and Janette's gone,off with , him to be married, I 'spect-and not ; a soul here to hender." I ' Thunder and Mars!" vo(iferated Winterblossom, dropping axe and pail. f "4 Where's John?" s  "He wouldn't do a thing. Might , have locked the srieaking scamp into r th9 barn; but lhe said'twas none of his - affairs." - ( The dog ( I'll discharge him at r onlce.' n  Wihterblossom turned to appeal to d his young companion for counsel, but i. he had suddenly disappeared.

Every body--firom selectman down to the veriest ragged urchin- was rallying Winterblossom onl the superiori y of hemlock honey. EIvery body, also, was glad llhat his nliece had run away, therebly defeating his plalns; for her home with him had been any thing but a pleasant one. I never learned the name of the young maln withl whom she eloped;  but he was reportedl to halve been in I every way worthy of her. Although t poor', hle was a greater fortune to a v loving, fiithhful git like Janette than t all the wetalth of old Winterblossom. b It ;;as rumored that the corscien- n tious Jaliette -o fhlr epented as to n write her uncle, begginghis forgive. less; but the old fellow was inexora w ble, declaring she never should ente, n his hIouse again, nor recieve a penny ui of hi, propelrty.   '  The host, lwho thrloughout this re- cital had listened apparently with no be deeper interest than mvseif; laugh- to ing immoderately now and then at tol the misfortunes of the hero, here ve jumped up and commenced pacing edl the room, while he gave way to fre- a1 quent outhursts of humor that must ni have seriously threatened his sides as and buttons. At length, fixing his w twinkling eyes upon Gates, he, be- no tween halt-suppressed cachinnations, gra said:               tc "The principal part of your narra- as tive-especially the fun-is all new 1 h to me, although I previously had an feel illkling of the old man's cllharlacter; gr but you will admit that I know more nigl of the niece than yourself when I lyg tellyou Iam the ' Hloptown good-for- son nothzg' who married her!"      "H eavens!" exclaimed the lawyer, our coloing. , I beg youlr pardon, Si, yo --indeed I do. Why didn't you tell the me I was assailing your own history, that and perhaps doing violence to the terbl teelings of your wife?"    ,. "No  apology, Sirl-no apology Soo0   of a whatever,"' Wilkinson replied, with over another ringing laugh that put Gates !man entirely at his ease. "I never allow in-- a good story to be spoiled for rela. the tions' sake; besides, I daresay, un- very ler the circumstances, Ihave enjoyed hiece it even better than your fellow-trav- his elels." had  'T"es," interposed Benton, rising 'e. and squarely facing the lawyer the the first time for the last half hour, while ed; his countenance gave evidence of in long-suppressed mirth; 'you proba- *gh bly will be satisfied on tilt score o a when I tell you Iam Julius Bentley an 'hat is the Ilame I gave when asked; sm. but our host evidently misunderstood mn- me, and thinking it immaterial, I did to not correct him." 'e- "W orse and worse!" said Gates, 'a- with a look of mock despair. "I er never s hall dare to tell another story i untilI learn the antecedents of my auditors. ' e-  "Oh, Sir, I assure you it has 'o been no annoyance whatever to listen 1- to this story--a treat, rather, for I've at told it so many times myself that the e version of another improves it decid- g edly-to my ears at least. I did feel - a little uncomfortable when I recog- t nized in our host (as I did as soon s as the lights were brought in) my s wlilom and successful rival; but I - now heartily give him my kindest con- , gratulations. Besides, Ihave learned to despise old Hugh Winterblossom asdeeply as any of his neighbors. 1 hope neither of you will think my feelings have been, in the least de- ;gree, assailed by anly thing said to- night ;" and Benton arose and warlm- ly grasped first the hend of Wilkin- son and then that of the lawyer. "And, friend Gates," interposed our host, "that you maynot take to yourself the credit of touching off all the fire-works to-night, 1 will add that I, perhaps, have given Mr. Win- terblossom a worse snubbing than he ever received from any one else. Soon after I married his niece she   indeed did feel a little conscience- stricken because she had left him so abruptly. Mind, she didn't care an iota for his gold, but she wanted to be reconciled to her uncle and aunt, be- cause she was indebted to them for lher education. So Janette, promp- ted by a sentiment of gratitude alone, wrote her uncle a letter; but it was quickly returned, simply endorsed with a few words of the bitterest corn ment. We-then removed to this vi- cinity; fortune favored us, and now we have a competency. "After a lapse of some eighteen or twenty years Mr. and Mrs. Win- terblossom happened to hear how prosperous we had been-in fact, it was last summer, and we then were living in a smaller house near. town. They came with honeyed words and made us a long visit. Of course we both treated them with the same hos- pitality and kindness that we should had nothing unpleasant ever occurred, Not a word was said in allusion to the past. "The day before they  were to leave us a town cart drove up to our gate with a complete outfit for a par- lor and two bedchambers.    i "' W hat does this mean? ' I asked, as the teamer began to unload the J goods and deposit them according to i the directions of Winterblossom. "'Oh, this is a present from us to your wife,' wasthe old man's reply, in a very obsequious tone. ' We didn't  'cording to custom, make her any present when she was married, and  we've decided to do it now-" better  late 'n never, " you know.' 'Not in this case, Mr. W inter-   blossom,' I responded, decidedly-- my wife was standing in the door be- side me, looking fully as indignant as I felt. 'We can not accept those arti- cles. I know our furniture is worln, but we can readily replace it when- ever we choose. You are welcome to stay under our roof as long as you please, and you both shall be well treated; but not one cent's worth of any thing can you leave here. A gift of. one-quarter the value of this would have been gratefully received once; but we do not wish it now.' "So the furniture was at once re- turned to the dealers; and withllout any show of ill-nature (Old Hught has been .snubbed so many times his pachydermatous sensibilities are proof against all ordinary manifestations of spite) the old couple bade us good-by the next day. We expect another visit fromn them next summer." We had a mirthful time at the breakfast-table the next morning, in which Mrs. Wilkinson took as cheer- ful pal t as any of us, referring, with much good-nature, to her visit to the library while the lawyer was so lost in his story, and humorously dwelling upon the difficulty she had to refrain from laughing outright at his unconsc- ious allusions to herself. The roads were now broken, and we travelers proceeded on our respec- tive journeys; but I never shall for- get that snow-storm, nor the remark- able circumstances which brought to- gether, after a lapse of years, persons once so singularly related, to hear from the-lips of a stranger a story concerning their own experiences.   &#xD;</p>
