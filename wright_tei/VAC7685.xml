PREFACE. THS book   is addressed  to all the young men of America.  I would exhort- them  to follow in my foot- steps, by putting their trust in One who, under all the different circumstances of my eventful life, I have found able to carry me through all difficulties and dangers, and  bring me out more than conqueror. My hope has been not in an arm of flesh, but in One who is 'able to save to the  uttermost. He  has been my pilot and deliverer in adversity and prosperity; by faith and prayer I found him to stick closer than a brother, for he has delivered me "out of six troubles, and in the seventh he  will never forsake."  Young men, let me. exhort you, whatsoever you do, or whatever circumstances of life you are placed in, whether it be on land or sea, whether it be in prosperity or adversity, whether it be in good report or bad report, whether it be in honor or dishonor, whether it be in sickness or in health, to choose the same pilot and deliverer whom I chose in the days of my  youth, and by faith and prayer he will bring you out more than conquerors.

I was born in Boston, in the State of Massachusetts, 20th of April, 1789. I  am the son of John I. Rus- sell, who died whenl I  was young.  Two years after, my mother died. I then was taken by my uncle, Thomas Russell, and lived with him until: I was six- teen years old, when I went to West Point, where I re- mained two years. From that I was commissioned to go aboard of the United States frigate. After being two years in the navy my   uncle was- taken sick aind wrote to Captain Bell to have me  seriat to B6ston;:  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7685-00000004"/> 6       AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF When I arrived I found- my uncle very sick and low, not expected to live. My uncle wished me to resign my commission and leave the navy. His rea- son for it was, that he considered me better calcula- ted for mechanical science than for the navy. He said he had no doubt I would make a very excellent mechanic, and also a great inventor, as I had a natural gift of ingenuity, I told my uncle that Captain Bell said he had never seen a young man advance faster in the navy. He replied-" yes, my dear boy, Captain Bell speaks very highly of you; hand me that letter off the desk." I handed him the letter, and he examined it after perusing it a moment, he read thus: "Col. Russell, Dear Sir: I have somewhat to say in respect to David, your nephew. I do say that I never have seen a boy advance faster in the navy in my life, and my advice to you is to let him remain in the navy. He is now nearly twenty years old, and he has been nearly two years with me, andccertainly he has gone ahead of every thing I have ever seen. I have young men that have been with me for five years, who are not as far advanced as David is, and I have not g6t a man on board that will go to the mast- head as quick as David will, with his spy-glass on his back; yes, and will go to the truck to see a vessel if required. He has got the good-will of all the officers on board of the ship, and there is not a man on board but what would go through fire and water for David. To prove this? after I had been out cruising off Cadiz Bay, in running down the Narrows, David had a   DAVID RUSSELL.        7 misfortune while running up the rigging with the mas- ter's mate, the highest subordinate officer on board; his foot slipped, and he fell overboard, but he being a very active and excellent swimmer, there was no danger of his losing his life. Before I could get the jolly-boat down I looked over the side of the vessel and I saw a half-dozen men swimming to David. I ordered them all to come aboard except one; we threw them  ropes and they were pulled aboard. 'By this time the jolly-boat had got up to' David and the other man, and they both got in the boat and were saved.  This convinced me that the whole ship's crew had the highest esteem for him; for no man will lay down his life for another, unless he' has high respect for him. So, now, Col. Russell, my dear sir, I have given you a brief account of David, the short time he has been with me. As for myself, I cannot help treating him with the highest respect; he is valiant, honorable, bold, kind and-honest, friendly to all. In fact, Colonel, he is the very image of his father, both in looks and principles. My advice to you   is to never take him out of the navy, for he will make a valiant officer, and before he is thirty years old he will command one of the first frigates in the United States service. I remain yours, Capt. WILLIAM BELL,-of U. S. Frigate." "Now, my   dear boy, this is all very good, and I am happy to hear you have such a  good character on board of your ship; but, my  dear son, there is some- thing else to be considered. I have no doubt of your  &#xD;<pb n="8 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7685-00000005"/> 8       AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF smartness in the navy, but there is one thing I have to tell you-you have got the same gifts and talents a} your father, although your father was an excellent military man; but for all- that -be was much smarter in other things-in 'mechanical works of different kinds; and as a politician, there was no better in his day. He would'stand and lecture hour after hour about the tyranny of England, and was called by the English the ' great rebel,' and they offered a great re- ward for his head ; but, my dear boy, they never had the honor of getting him for his friends hid him in caves, and swamps, and in the wilderness ; he lived and died a natural death in his own' country, and was lamented and esteemed by all who knew him, and was buried with military' honors, as a great politician and a good patriot. So now, my dear boy, you are ex- actly in the same place as your father--you are ac- tive in every thing you d-o and quick in learning; but let me tell you one thing, you have that in you that must come out, sooner or later; it cannot be hid-it has already made its appearance to me, and it. Will still -show itself more and more the older you grow. For that reason, I exhort you, my dear boy, to leave the -navy- andto go onwith that you have already commenced, and may God bless you and prosper you in all your undertakings, which I have no doubt he will; Take .this key and unlock that iron safe." It was a very large double lock, and turned once back and once forward, requiring a skillful person to unlock it. I unlocked it as I was told to do. He then gave me another key and told me to unlock  copper box that was inside the safe, and to hand him  &#xD;<pb n="-9" xml:id="VAC7685-00000006"/>   DAVID RUSSELL.       9 a large tin case. He took out of the case his will, and said: "Now, my boy, you have been a good and honest boy, and kind to all that ever knew you ; you have not only friends on board of your ship but you have got friends all over Boston, for all that ever knew you are friends to you. Now, my dear boy, I have always promised to make you equal with my own chil- dren, and I love you as my own child; now you are nearly of age and I am about to leave you; my days are nearly spent, and I am about to part'this life, but may the God of heaven bless you and guide you through this unfriendly world.' Go on, go on, my boy, as you have 'begun, and you will prosper no doubt in your undertakings. There is no one knows any thing about this will I -hold in my hand, but me and my attorney, and no one will know till after my decease; but look at it and see what is done." I read it, and found I was equal in every thing with his own children in money and property. "My dear boy," said my uncle, " you have got a large amount of money left you by your father and me, and more will be left by your uncle William. My advice to you is to take good -care of it, which I have no doubt you will do; be friendly, kind and obliging to all, and remember the fatherless and the widow, the poor and the needy, the sick and af- flicted." "Uncle, you know that I always have been kind and obliging to the poor and the needy, and have always assisted them as far as in my powertas have given them the last cent I had, which ydu have been 1r  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7685-00000007"/> 10      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF an eye witness to, and have rewarded me with hand- some gifts for so doing. I have honored the aged and have taken advice from those older than myself." "Yes, my dear boy, well do I know that you would lay down your life for the aged rather than they should be imposed upon.  Although you are a blooming youth, you remind me of the rose in my garden, splendid and brilliant as it looks, carrying so many different shades and looking so magnificent. My dear boy, know you not that this rose must wither and pass away? so must you; but I believe you will live to a good old age and go down to the grave like a ripe shock of corn, and I trust your works will follow you, for I believe they will be good. May the God of heaven bless you and guide you safe into His kingdom for the dear Redeemer's sake, amen." Soon- after this my uncle was taken with fits and nervous convulsions. He lived a few days and ex- pired. He was loved by all who knew him and la- mented by them. He was buried with the honors of war.  His regimental cap and sword-the same sword with which he killed the British Colonel, his an- tagonist at the battle of Bunker Hill-were laid on the coffin, which was decorated with a wreath of stars and stripes on the base. The hearse was drawn by four of the finest black horses in Boston; all the military companies, far and near, escorted the body and paid their last respects to him at his long home. These are the words I heard from many: "There goes the faithful patriot and a brave soldier, one that has been a friend to his country apd bled for the freedom of America. He spent his life in nourishing and cher- ishing the freedom of his own country!"   DAVID RUSSELL.       " My aunt and cousins and the friends of the do- ceased returned to the homestead.  All things appeared solemn as death in the house.  There seemed to be a vacancy that could never be filled. Thie chair that he sat in was vacant; the voice that had been heard offering thanks to the heavenly Fa- ther for the blessings received was heard no more, and every thing appeared to say there was something wanted when- the family group gathered around the table ; his vacant seat told he was gone. In fact, the whole town of Boston seemed in mourning for many weeks, and every thing appeared as solemn as death. After a few months had elapsed the family went to their stations in domestic life again; but they never could forget the deceased, for the many lessons and good advice he gave them had taken root and had sprung up. Shortly after this I began to prepare for my studies, and while engaged in them I heard that the ship "Perseverance " was going to Liverpool and was to leave in a few weeks. I hastened and prepared my- self for a passage, and after the time was expired, I left for Liverpool. We had a long and wearisome passage, losing a mast and some of the men over- board. After a passage of ten weeks we arrived in Liverpool, and I put up at the "' White Hart " inn. After examining the city of Liverpool and the won- derful mass of docks a few days, I prepared myself to go to the city-of Manchester, -the greatest manu- facturing city in all England. I was there two weeks, examining the different kinds of machinery, and taking drawings and sketches of them, the object,  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7685-00000008"/> 12      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF which you shall see in the latter part of my life, I had in view.  It being the first time I ever set my foot on English soil, as a young American, I determined to make good use of my time. I went into every factory where there was any machinery to be seen, and examined high and low.   I saw some splendid machinery, but I could not find any thing like that I was in search of. Returning to Liverpool I put up at the same hotel as before. I had 'not been there many days before I fell in with a man from Edinburgh, Scotland. The way I first got acquainted with him was bypreceiving a note from him one morning, about nine o'clock. The note read thus- "Dear Sir: Not having the honor of knowing your name, I address you by this note. I would like to have a private interview with you; if you would be so kind as to call at No. 20, that is my room, I shall; be happy to see you and you will oblige me. ATLEXANDER MCDONALD." Accordingly I went to see- him, and met him at his door. He said---"Sir, good morning, how do you do this morning? This is a very fine morning, indeed; this is such weather as we have in England at this time of year, and I suppose you are blessed in America with such weather, also."       -- "Yes, sir," I observed, " the God of heaven brings rain on the just and on the unjuist, and the same God also brings fine weather on the just and on the unjust." " Sir," said he, "I have not learned your name   DAVID RUSSELL.       13 yet, and I should like to know it, for I think you are indeed a remarkable young man from what I have heard and seen of you, and I wish to'learn more of you.' To which I replied, " my name is David Rus- sell, sir, and it is pretty well known in America; when I say that, I mean my ancestry. I am a son of John H. Russell." As I was about to continue, he said, "Stop for a moment, sir, if you please. Is it the sane John H. Russell- I have heard and read so imuch- about, who was termed the 'great rebel' of America?" "Yes, sir," I replied, " he was termed the great rebel of America!" "Well, sir," continued he, "little did I ever expect to see any of his offspring, for he ought to have been beheaded long ago. But, sir, pardon me for speaking quite so hastily, we Britons are very plain spoken, particularly the Scotch, for they are very loyal to England. But, Mr. Russell, I ought not accuse you on account of your father; I ask your pardon a thousand times for what I have already said, for I know the'son cannot help what the father does. But this Mr. RusseJl has been , a scourge to England, by putting  out books and encouraging the rebels to rise against Great Britain. He must have been an uncommon smart man, for his writings are beautiful, certainly. We have some of the finest books in England of his putting out that I have ever seen; if you wait a  moment I will go and bring you a book of your own father's writing." Accordingly he presented me a book which was cer- tainly splendid to look at. I opened the book and X  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7685-00000009"/> "      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF the first words that met my eyes ran thus: "Free- dom and liberty is the life of an American!" "Come forward all free men and stand up for your rights  I know you will lose the last drop of blood for your rights!"I looked over the book a short-time, but my heart was so full it was ready to burst. My friend remarked, I see Mr. Russell you are very much affected; but pardon me, I meant no harm. Now, sir, I will tell you a short history of my life. I was born in Edinburgh, Scotland;. I was the youngest son of Alexander McDonald. I had two brothers and a sister. My sister was the oldest of us all; she married a merchant in Edinburgh, and be- coming very wealthy, rather disdained the whole of us. My two brothers went into the army, and were both killed in Spain under Lord Wellington.- I was then left (being the youngest) with my father, at the age of fourteen. I was bound an apprentice to the engineer and machine business; I served seven years, which made me twenty-one. My father had accumulated a small amount of money by his industry and had it in the bank; but by sickness, infirmity and old age this money was soon exhausted. Working as a journey- man, and being an expert mechanic, I accumulated money to replenish the stock in the bank, so that money could be drawn as wanted by my father. I left Edinburgh a few weeks ago and came to this place: As I am going to travel a little through Eng- land I should be happy to have your company. I had thought of going from here to London, the great metropolis of England; I have read much about it, but have never seen it. Would that route suit   DAVID RUSSELL.       15 you? I have made calculations to leave Liverpool in a few days, and what hinders us from going to- gether, if you think me a man of honori and prin- ciple?" "I have no objection to going with you," I replied, "but I have somewhat to say to you concerning the United States of America. It is a place I presume you have never seen." "No, sir, I have never seen it," he answered, "but I have read considerable about it." "Well, sir," said I, "I will tell you what I know of it. It is my birthplace. I have traveled in many parts of America, and consider it a beautiful country. It abounds in hills and valleys, plains and prairies. Much of it is covered with timber. It abounds in all kinds of minerals-such as iron, lead, copper, golds and silver, besides inexhaustible mines of coal; alf the people of America are boldval- iant and courageous for their rights, full of hospitality, dividing the last dollar and the last pound of bread or flour with their neighbor-I mean those who are true Americans. In respect to my ancestry, sir, I may say, as for my father I know but little about him, only from what I have heard from good author- ity and what I have read, for he died when I was quite young, and my mother died in about two years afterwards. I was then taken by my uncle Tommy Rus/ell, of Boston, with whom I remained until I was about sixteen years old." "Pardon me, sir, for interrupting you," observed my friend, "is Col. Russell, of Boston, your uncle? / *     , .    &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7685-00000010"/> 16      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF he who killed his antagonist, the English Col. Warren at Bunker Hill!" Yes," said I, " he was my uncle; and William Russell, who was called General Russell, was also an uncle of mine; Joseph, who was captaini of the flying artillery, is also an uncle of mine. These\ were my father's three brothers. My father was the oldest of the four, his name was John H. Russell; Thomas was the next, William the next, and Joseph the youngest." "Mr. Russell," said my friend, "we have the his- tory of thfse four men in England, and according to history they are called the greatest rebels that ever rose against the mother country." "Mr. McDonald, sir," said P," the word 'rebel' is a very vile word if applied right, but I will show you they were not rebels, but as true men for England as ever drew a sword, had they been treated like men. Now, sir, I want to ask you one simple question, and leave it to your own conscience. Suppose I was to take you and your family and set you in the middle of a wilderness in an unsettled country, giving you a little subsistance for two or three years, and just as you began to make a comfortable living I should come and demand payment to such amount yearly that you could in no wise pay; would you slave and sacrifice all the enjoyment of life to pay me what I asked? If you would, when I found you could pay me that, what if I should demand more of you, and if you could not pay me I would take the land you had worked on all your life and just got under a state of cultivation, and sell it to pay me, at the same time   DAVID RUSSELL.       17 the land did not'belong to me! Well, this is the way the English did; they held out inducements to the' people to go to America, it being at that time a per- fect wilderness, and when they sacrificed every thing, abandoned their homes and risked their lives to go into a wild wilderness, and when they had cleared enough land to get a living, the English came and press- ed them down by laying heavy taxes on every thing, which they could in no wise pay; and tried to bind them down as it were by iron fetters, that they- never could get off, which they had no right to do, for America did not belong to England, it belonged to the Indians. They forced the stamp tax and the tea tax, and many other taxes un- justly on the people of the colonies, whose burdens were greater than they would bear. The Americans had not a dollar in money at that time, and no way to get it. This was the cause of my father and his three brolhers, and many others going aboard the ships at Boston and throwing the tea overboard." "Mr. Russell, this indeed was very hard, but could not the colony get any redress from Eng- land?" "Sir," I replied, " petition after petition was sent to England, and several delegates were also sent to beg and pray their petitions might be answered; but instead of answering their petitions they put the delegates in prison and laid heavier taxes on America than before. Many were tried for treason, and many of them died in England and never got to their homes or families again. Now, Mr. McDonald, sir, I think I have given a clear illustration that they  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7685-00000011"/> 18      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF were not rebels, but they were standing in their own defence. It is just the same as this-suppose you were coming up to me with a sword in your hand to kill me, and when I   you coming, I drew my sword and was ready oou, I having more science than you, I kill you, and I live.." "Well, Mr. Russell,' said my Scotch friend, "if that be the case there is something to be considered; it makes it look of another color, I must acknowl- edge. I was too fast in my words and expressions, but I humbly ask your pardon, and were it not for my father and mother I would go to America; you give such a good report of it, I should like to see it." Early the next morning we took the stage, that was called the King's mail, for London. The stage was drawn by four large horses, and they were changed every ten miles. There were two guards on the top of the stage, one back and one fo ward, and they were equipped with a brace of pistols, sword and car- bine. We passed through many beautiful towns and villages, and after some time we drove up to a turn- pike gate. Mr. McDonald inquired, as we passed through, if there were any turnpike gates in Amer- ica? I told him we had some few toll-gates, but most all the roads were free in America. In a short time after passing the gate we arrived at the "White Swan" inn, where we stopped for an hour and took supper. When the stage was ready, we all got aboard and started again on our journey. About twelve o'clock there was a great fuss on top of the stage, one of the guards fired a pistol shot and roared out "robbery!" It was a false alarm, nobody was hurt. Of                     .   DAVID RUSSELL.       19 Early the next morning we found ourselves at the "Elephant and Castle" hotel, the landlord of which informed us if there were any passengers wishing to remain for the next stage, which would come in about three hours, they could do so. Mr. McDonald and my- self complied with the proposal. After breakfast we went into a large splendid sitting-room where we ob- served a number of smart looking men, apparently of the navy. They were on a furlough, and appear- ed to have a great deal of money. I asked the landlord if those men belonged to his majesty's war-ship. He informed me that they be- longed to the naval service; some to the Caledonia, some to the Hibernia, And some to the Ville de Paris and Ajax. He thought they were as brave a set of tars as ever pulled a rope, being, as he said, all king's men and full of money. The stage now drove up, and we took our departure for London, where, in a few hours, we arrived at the "Wheat Sheaf" hotel, the largest hotel in London. The landlord was on hand to receive us. He was a portly looking man, very smart and active, and look- ed as if he had never seen trouble. He treated us with great respect. He came to me, saying-" you are a very fine young man, I think you are a native of America?" "Yes, sir," I replied, "I am a na- tive of America, and I am not ashamed of it!" "Well," said he, "you are a credit to your country, or any country. You never need expect to leave England, the girls will never let you go." The landlord invited us up stairs to show us our room. He said to me: "Young man, I should like  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7685-00000012"/> 20      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF; to know your name." I handed him my card, whch: had on it a masonic emblem. He looked at it, then reading it out loud, he said to me: "God bless you, sir! are you of that order? are you advanced that far?" I gave him a friendly sign and a masonic grip, and shook hands with him in masonic order. ( May God Almighty bless you," he exclaimed; "I never saw a man of your age who knew as much about masonry. Sir, you are at home here, and you have thousands of friends here! you are at home any where; you- can even go to the ends of the earth!" , After showing us our rooms, a beautiful front room and two bed-rooms, he invited me down to see his family. He introduced me as Mr. Russell, of North America. He had a very agreeable family, a wife and three daughters, young women grown, who were as fine and accomplished young ladies as I ever saw in that age. Mr. McDonald and myself ordered a hack, which the waiter soon informed us was in readiness. I told the driver to take us first to the Patent office, next to the Tower, then to the Royal Exchange, and then to the Bank of England. These directions were faith- filly executed, and we examined all those places minutely. I took sketches of every thing I saw of any utility. We also went to Westminster and St. Paul's church; we passed through the Wlhispering Gallery; Smithfield Market and Leadenhall Market were also visited. We went to Spittlefields and ex- amined the silk factories, and all the machinery of any note. In fact we visited every place in Loni-   DAVID RUSSELL.        21 don where we thought there was any thing new before returning to our hotel. After a few days we left London, taking passage on the Gravesend boat for Gravesend. After exam- ining every thing there, we went to Woolwicli; from thence to Deptford, and from Deptford to Sheerness, where we examined the extensive dock-yards. From thence we went to Chatham, from which place we returned back to London. Here Mr. McDonald re- ceived a letter from'his father, informing him that he was very sick, and wished his son to come home immediately. My friend called the landlord, Mr. Jackson, into our room, when he said to us--"Mr. Jackson and Mr. Russell, I am heartily sorry to leave you, particularly my friend Russell; but I have received a letter from my father and I must leave you and go home to see how the old folks come on, for it seems they are very sick and not expected to live. But, now, Mr.-Rus- sell, I have one word to say to you in the presence of Mr. Jackson; it grieves my heart sore to leave you, for I do say for the time I have been acquainted with you, that I have enjoyed myself more and better than I ever did before; and also that I have gained more information from you than I ever did from any one else in the same time. I am sorry that I cannot con- tinue with you, for I should like to travel with you to America: so farewell!" and he took us each by the hand, saying-"God bless you, and may the Father of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ bless you, amen!"   The stage drove up, we took a hearty  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7685-00000013"/> 22      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF shake of hands, and my esteemed Scotch friend departed. "Well, Mr. Russell, it seems you have lost your friend,' said Mr. Jackson; " no doubt but what he was a friend, for he seemed very kind and friendly to you. Sometimes the loss of one is the gain of many, and I think it is so in your case; though you have lost Mr. -McDonald and may never see him again, I may say with truth that you have many worthy friends in this city, and a man of your order will find friends, let him go where he will." I told Mr. Jackson that I had some notion of going to work at my business. On his inquiring what business I followed, I informed him that I designed to perfect myself as an engineer and machinist. He replied that he knew a man in the Strand that he would recommend me to; he handed me a paper, and pointed out his advertisement, observing--" his name is William Robertson, Engine Maker, of all sizes. I think, Mr. Russell, he is the very man that will suit you, and you had better go and see him; if I could get away I would go with you, if I cannot go I will- give you an-introduction to him." At this time a number of carriages drove up to the inn, and the landlord told me there was so much company come it would be impossible for him to go, therefore he would give me an introduction which would answer my purpose, as he was well acquainted with Mr. Robert- son. He gave me the letter and I immrediately went to the place indicated. I saw the foreman of the shop, and asked him if Mr. Robertson was to be seen. He said "yes, he is back in the counting-room; I am   DAVID RUSSELL.       23 just going around to the counting-room and I will show you the way." Accordingly we went, and I found Mr. Robertson there. After the foreman had done talking and went out, I handed Mr. Robertson the letter of introduction that Mr. Jackson gave me. He read the letter, and looking steadily at me a mo- ment, said, "Young man, are you acquainted with Mr. Jackson?" "Yes, sir," I replied; "I have a short acquaintance with Mr. Jackson, but in sentiments a very long acquaintance." At this he gave me a sign, I answered it; he gave me another, and I answered it. He stopped for a few moments and there was not a word said. At length, says he, "Young man, I am a little astonished at you; you don't look 'to be over-eighteen years old, and can it be possible you know so much about the order of ma- sonry!"I gave him a sign of the higher order, and showed him by a reacting sign that I could still go higher. He took me by the hand and gave me a hearty shake in the masonic order, saying, "I find  your name is David Russell; we have several of that name here, with some of whom I am intimately ac- quainted. Now what is your business with me?" "Sir," I replied, I came to get employment." Well, young man, what can you do?" "Sir," said I, "I can't do much of any thing, but I can try to do a great deal; if you think proper to give me work on trial I should like to go to work, for I dislike being idle." "Well," he observed, " what must I give you for your time?" '  s "t t  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7685-00000014"/> 24      AUTOBIOQGRAPHY OF "Well, sir," I replied, "I'll leave that to yourself, after you see what I can do." "You look uncommon young," said he, "' to know much about mechanical work, but I may be deceived as much in your mechanical work as I was in your masonry. You can come to work tomorrow morning, and we will give you a trial." I then went back to my hotel, when Mr. Jackson, desiring to have some conversation with me, took me into his private apartment. He inquired how I made outwith Mr. Robertson. I informed him that I had agreed to go to work in the morning. He wanted to know how I made my bargain, and what I was to re- ceive. I told him we did not set any price, that I left that with him. "Well," said he, " you have done just right, for you will find Mr. Robertson a gentleman, and as good a friend to you as any man in England. By the way, Mr. Russell, my daughters are going a short distance in the country, and they requested me to ask you to accompany them." "Cer- tainly I will, sir," I replied, " with the greatest pleasure, for I should like to see the country." After dinner the carriage drove up, and I embarked with my lady companions for an agreeable ride. The coachman was ordered to drive us to Bridgeport, where Mr. Jackson's brother kept the "1 Red Lion" inn. We passed through a beautiful country, with varied scenery, and gazed at the numerous parks and -beautiful gardens, the splendid 'buildings and numerous cottages, built in the highest order of ar- chitectural beauty. The whole route was delightful. The young ladies remarked upon the beauty of every   DAVID RUSSELL.        25 thing, and in the fullness of my heart, I exclaimed-- Yes, it is splendid indeed to behold the handiworks of God! We find the wonderful works of nature and Providence unfolded in every country and nation. We see, my dear girls, a great deal in those gardens; we see the finger of the Almighty in those roses and that honey-suckle, in the running myrtle and the tulip; and look, my dear girls; at the brilliancy of the different shades of those flowers as far as your eye can behold. My dear girls, there is not an artist  in the world can equal one of them with all his skill! I think I see the lily of the valley there; don't you see it, my girls? When I look at the lily it makes me think of the words of our Lord and Saviour. Do you remember, Miss Adaline, the words our Saviour uttered concerning the lily?"I can't think of them just now," she replied, " but will you please explain them to us?" "Well, girls," said I, "our Saviour was talking to the Jews and his disciples, and as he addressed  them  he gave warning against taking anxious  thought for tomorrow, wherewith  they, should be clothed, &amp;c.; for I say unto you, Behold the lily of the valley, it labors not neither does it toil, yet Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like unto one of these. Now, my dear girls, if we are arrayed like unto the lily, with a robe of righteous- ness, pure, holy and white, so we may not be asham- ed at the coming of our Lord and Saviour, how happy we shall be!" The carriage drove up  to a large and splendid hotel called the "Red Lion " inn, and we were con- ducted to a spacious and comfortable sitting-room, 2  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7685-00000015"/> 26      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF elegantly furnished with the best of furniture, and pictures hung around the room of every kind and color. The coachman informed Mr. Jackson that he would have to be very smart, for we must go back home again that night. Tea was served up for us immediately; Mr. Jackson, his wife and three daugh- ters were seated at the table with us. After he had asked a blessing, the servants waited on us with the greatest politeness. Mr. Jackson inquired of the girls whether they intended to let Mr. Russell go back to America! Of course they didn't, if they could prevent it. After tea the carriage was ordered, when the three girls, with two of their cousins and myself embarked for home. It was a very pleasant evening, and after enjoying a delightful ride we ar- rived at our hotel about eight o'clock. After we had got supper, Mr. Jackson invited me into the parlor. He asked me how I liked England for the time I had been in it? I told him I liked it much, and I thought it was a fine country. He asked me if there were as fine buildings and farms in America, and if they looked as well as they do in England? I told him we had some excellent farms and some splendid buildings in America, and a wilderness;, which, when it is cleared up, will make some of the handsomest farms in the world. I said to Mr. Jack- son, "You must remember one thing, which I suppose you know by reading the history of my country; it is only a few years, comparatively, since the first settlers came to America." "Yes,' said he, Mr. Russell, I know it is on1yf short time ago since America was first settled, we mutt make allowance for that!"At this   DAVID RUSSELL.       27 time Mr. Jackson's oldest daughter called him t) her; when he came back he asked me if I was fon  of music. I told him I was, indeed, I liked to hea.' good music and singing. -The oldest daughter went to the piano and played "God save the King," andi many other beautiful tunes, and the rest joined i, and sung. One of the girls asked me if I could sing. and I told her I could, when she played a beautifut tune, and we all joined in and sung. So we passed the evening in social conversation, singing and music, and then we all retired to bed. Early the next morning I arose and fixed myself for a day's work, for I had to be at the shop at six o'clock. In passing tlrough the Strand I saw group s of families taking their tea and coffee at the various stalls. When I arrived at the shop the foreman and a great many of the men were there. I notified the foreman that I had come to work and I wanted a job. He told me to wait, that Mr. Robertson would be soon there. After waiting a short time Mr. Rob- ertson came, and I said-"Good morning, sir," which salutation he returned, saying, "David, I have got a job for you." He handed me the drawing of twelve different sizes pullies, and asked me if I thought I could make them. I said I could try, and the best can do no more. The foreman gave me the stuff, and I commenced to work. I got them all jointed and glued up, when he asked me if I could turn them off. I told him I could try. I then turned them off and finished them in the highest style. When the boss came along, I told him I believed I had got them done. He looked at them, and  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7685-00000016"/> 28      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF then called the foreman, and asked him how he liked the pullies. He examined them closely, and said,--.There is not a maan in the shop can do them better! Mr. Robertson said he lad never seen a better set of pullies. By this time the St. Paul's church clock struck twelve, and the bells rung for dinner. Mr. Robertson called me into the counting- room and told me he wanted to have a talk with me. He said, '(David, whose son are you, and what is your father's name?" ' Sir,". I replied, "I am the son of John H. Russell; I was born in Boston, in the State of Massachlusetts." '"Had your father any brothers '?" ' Yes, sir," - replied, " he had three ; Thomas, William and Joseph." "Was not your father baorn in England?" he, inquired. "Yes, sir," said I, "I understood he was, though I know but little about him, only what I heard from good authors. My maotler was born in Bath, England, and my father was boxrn in Winchester, but they came to America when they were qyuite young, and were married in America." Mr. Robertscn, said, "My $son, would you as lief board with me as with Mr. Jackson?"I said I would. "'I Well,"' says he, "get yourself ready and we will go home to dinner."

WHEN we arrived at Mr. Robertson's hotise, he introduced me to his family as Mr. Russell, the young man from North America.  We all sat down to the table; Mr. Robertson asked a blessing, and we had a splendid dinner, indeed. Mrs. Rpbertson asked me how old I was; I asked her how old she might think I was? (I being much older than I look- ed.) She thought I could not be older than sixteen or seventeen. Mr. Robertson remarked to her, "I do not know how old the young man's body is, but he has an old head. I have but a short acquaintance with David, but from what I have seen of him since I have been acquainted with him, there is not a man in my shop- can go ahead of him." Mrs. Robertson observed, "I have been looking at the young man ever since he came into the house; he has certainly a bold and fine looking counte- nance."  "Yes," said her daughter, " look how he holds his head up."  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7685-00000017"/> 30       AUTOBIOGRAPHY OP Mrs. Robertson asked her daughter,--"Who is it' looks so much like him? There is some youing lady I know, looks very much like him." Maria replied, "I know her, it is Priscilla Rus- sell; she is coming here in a few days, and we shall see how much they resemble each other." In a short time Miss Priscilla Russell, the young lady spoken of, came to make a visit for a few days, and in this time Maria's birthday came; so they made a party, and I was invited to attend. Mr. and Mrs. Robertson and several old gentlemen and ladies were also there, besides a number of young ladies and their companions. ' After tea it was proposed that Priscilla and I should stand- up together, and we did so. Mr. and Mrs. Robertson and several of the ladies got up and looked at us. Mrs. Robert- son said, "There, did I not tell you how much they looked alike! look at their eyes'and nose and hair, and their features, how much they resemble .each other!" "'Yes," said they all, "they look enough alike to be brother and sister!" Priscilla being a very social girl, after sitting a few moments, she said to me, "My father and uncles are very fond of telling history, and I think you are; it pleases me much, and I know it will please them all." I told Priscilla I would- relate some incidents of history if all the company requested it. "Yes," they said, "we should all like to have you relate some, very much."  "Well," I replied, 1' I will commence on these conditions, providing you all meet here every evening till I get through, for it will take several evenings to relate it." "Yes," they all said, " we   DAVID RUSSELL.       31 feel very anxious for you to begin, and we will attend regular every evening and pay the greatest attention, for we know it will be an interesting story." Being in a talkative mood I commenced as follows, the whole narration occupying several evenings: Ladies and Gentlemen,--I am  about to relate to you the History, the Life and travels of Napoleon Bonaparte, from  the age of seven years to the time he surrendered himself up to the British. Na- poleon Bonaparte was the son of a Corsican, born in- Corsica; his father had a small property in the south part of that Island. Napoleon, the uncle of Napoleon Bonaparte, came from France to see his brother in Cor- sica, and requested him to move to the sout part of France. Corsica was under the government of France at that time. He immediately moved to the south part of France, according to the request of his brother, through -hose aid he bought a large vineyard and became a great wine merchant. He was of great note, and made superior wine to any merchant in that country. He supplied most all the wholesale dealers in Paris, and he became very wealthy. Now it was the law of France-that is, the military law-- that all young cadets must be teh years old when they enter the army school. N poleon Bonaparte was eight years old at this time, a :h' yis uncle's persuading his father, he entered him immediately into the army school. He answered as ten years old, though he was only eight. tHe was very large of his age, and very shrewd. He began to make great pro- gress in the school in learning, and when he was about in his leisure hours, he would form companies  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7685-00000018"/> 32      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF of boys with wooden swords and high lofty hats, and dress them in paper regimentals, and fight sham bat- tles. At the age of ten years he had a company of fifty or sixty boys, drilled in the best order. He made such great progress in his military learning, that at the age of sixteen he was offered a captain's commission in the army; they supposed he was older, judging by his looks. His uncle persuaded his father not to let him go, for he said, if you keep him at school he will get a higher offer than that. Now his father and uncle became immensely rich; they were the wealthiest men in all that country. His father and uncle allowed him to draw on them for money at his pleasure ; he drew large sums of money, by which means he formed companies' of young men. He had no person older than twenty years in all his companies. In this way he kept on till he had formed a regiment of a thousand men strong; and by his money and irtrigue, by deception and flattery he got the whole country, far and near, on his side. He left the school at the age of twenty years, and took command of this regiment that he had formed, as colonel. He chose his subordinate officers, such as captains, lieutenants and ensigns, and they were voted in by the companies. At this time, Louis the XVth was at war with several nations, and seeing the smartness, boldness and activity of Napoleon Bo- naparte, the government gave him command as Brigadier-General over a body of regular troops. Soon after this he was ordered to Portugal with his command to- fight the Portuguese; by his kind treat- ,f   DAVID RUSSELL.       33 ment of his men and officers he could flatter them to do any thing. Now the Portuguese army was very strong, and so was the French; Napoleon arranged with Marshal Ney, the commander-in-chief of the Friench army, to let him take his troops oi the front division, and he assured the general that he would take the eagles and colors, which were guarded by a heavy detachment. After a short interview with the general, and pledging his word and honor that he would obey the sound of the bugle, he allowed him to take the position he desired. Napoleon and his aid thern left the general and came to his men. He now called his men up and said-" bravo! bravo to France, and long live Louis, XVth!"He then called his subordinate officers and said, "Brothers, I now show you a plan of the way and manner in which I am going to attack the detachment that carries the eagles and colors, which is the main detachment of the army you all know, and we will defeat them and take their colors and eagles, and every officer of you will be promoted to a high rank. Now I want you all to pledge your word and honor that you will follow me, for I will take the lead!" He explained the plan in a perfect manner, so that they all understood it well. His plan was, he informed them, that he would form a solid square of ten men deep, and he-would attack them on the left flank. "I say now unto you all, officers, I want you to rush on to the colors and eagles and take them. After the first charge you make,. the moment this is done, I want the troops to retreat back. Now I want' every officer to go to his company I     ., 2*  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7685-00000019"/> 384      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF and make this known to his men, then come and make a report to me." In a short time each captain returned to the gen- eraI's quarters, and their report in substance was, that the men all said they will follow their command- er wherever he goes, and they would have the Por- tuguese eagles and colorsj or die in the attempt. The French army lay encamped on the plains of Lisbon, waiting orders from the commander to, advance. The Portuguese were forming in different positions every day, according to the reports of their spies. At last they formed in a position that suited the French commander, and he determined to advance. He ordered the artillery to limber up, the baggage and commissary wagons to be got ready, and special instructions were given to the flying artillery. - The bugle sounded, and the troops advanced on the plains near the city of Lisbon. . The heavy ar- tillery, the baggage and commissary wagons were de- tached from the army, and a reserved guard of several thousand men were placed over them. The commander then ordered an advance in quick time, which was obeyed with spirit. Bonaparte command- ed the troops on the left flank, according to his re- quest. The Portuguese opened from their artillery a tremendous fire on the French army, but the French rushed forward with all speed on their enemies, giv- ing them a tremendous charge. Bonaparte had flank- ed the detachment that carried the eagles and colors with a mighty charge, and carried away those troph- ies he had determined to win. The Portuguese advanced on Bonaparte's division,   DAVID RUSSELL.        35 but the left wing cut them off, so they had to retreat. The rest of the Portuguese army, seeing their stand- ard with their eagles and colors taken, supposed their commander had ordered a surrender, and the French army was speedily master of the field. The victorious army took a large amount of money in the commissary's department, and- also a large ,number of baggage-wagons, loaded with valuable property; also a large amount of heavy and light artillery, and many thousand stands of arms. In consequence of the desperateness of the charge, the loss was great on both sides, in, both men and offi- cers. Napoleon's command was very much cut up and suffered the most severely, losing several import- apt officers; but they secured the eagles and colors. As soon as they overhauled the wounded and buried the dead, they made the best of their way to Paris, where they were saluted by firing of cannon, ringing of bells, and bonfires; the whole city was decorated, the shipping displayed their colors, and at night the whole city-was illuminated. After the prisoners were all secured and the wounded taken to the hospitals, the army encamped in the suburbs of the city.        ' Napoleon Bonaparte was made Knight of the Gar- ter and Knight of the Cross; he was also promoted to the second command in the French army. All his officers that were not killed were promoted to high rank, and many of his privates were made officers. At- this time France was at war with Germany, Spain and many other nations, and Napoleon's army  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7685-00000020"/> AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF was-ordered into constant service. He fought mdny battles, and gained most of them. He treated his men so well that they would -readily sacrifice their lives for him; in fact he got all France under his thumb, and by flattery, deception and money, he got Louis XVth off ,the throne. He persuaded the French not to have a king, but an emperor; the French being excited at that -time, they made him Emperor of France. Immediately after he was made Emperor, he sent certain delegates to England to make treaties, but England would not submit to them. He then commenled to build shipping, and he raised his army to upwards of four hundred thousand men. As soon as they were all ready, he declared war against Great Britain, by laying an em- bargo on all English vessels, and the war lasted up- wards of twenty years. A few years after this Bona- parte was at his highest career; he got all the nations under him except Russia, America and England, and his name was a terror to all the world. About this time he put away his wife because she could not bring him forth a son, and he went to Germany and forced the rnller of that empire to give up his daugh- ter to him for his wife. But the Emperor utterly- de- nied him.' Bonaparte told him he'should send anll army of men there, and they would be like locusts, and eat up all the provisions in the land, so that there would be starvation in the whole'land; and he did so. The Emperor sent for Napoleon, and said to him, s"Why hast thou done this thing to me? Thy career may last for a season, but thou shalt die a prisoner of war. My daughter is willing to go with   DAVID RUSSELL.       37 you, not because she loves or regards you, but out of regard- for the peace of her subjects ; but not till you have withdrawn your army from my land shall you have my daughter."' Bonaparte withdrew his army immediately and took them back to France. He married- the Empe- ror's daughter, and took her with him to' Paris; he had two children by her, whose names were Jerome and Napoleon, but they both died. Soon after this, he collected a very large army and fleet, and issued a proclamation that he would have no neutral powers; they must be for him or against him. He then de- clared war against Russia, and he fitted up a very large army and went to Moscow. He burnt all the towns and villages that he went through, and at last reached Moscow with his army. Winter wls coming on, which is very severe in that country; the Ru8s- sians seeing that they could not hold the town, set fire to it and burned it down. He then had no shelter for his army, for he burned down all tile towns and villages- that he passed through; he had nothing for his horses or men to eat, and they were compelled to eat their horses. Thousands froze to death, or died from hunger and the want of shelter; only a few of his troops ever reached Paris. About this time he made his brother king of Spain, in which unhappy country there were serious divisions among the people, part joined the French, and part the English. Joseph Bonaparte, king of Spain, was furnished with a large army--part Por- tuguese, part Spaniards and part French. ' The British army was very/small, numbering not more than one-  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7685-00000021"/> 38      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF tenth of their opponents. \ The French army advanc- ed at night while the English were marching along the beach. The French army divided into three di- visions and surrounded the British, charging upon them and driving them into the sea. General Moore, the British commander, was killed, and a great many valiant officers and men, and many were drowned in the sea. Lord Wellington, being second in command, with his remaining fragment of an army, retreated to Salamanca, taking the body of General Moore with him.  Lord Wellington ordered his engineers to fortify Salamanca, which was made very strong, the guns being arranged ten tiers deep. Dispatches were sent to England for a tinforce- ment, Wellington giving a true statement f all that transpire, telling the government that if they did not send him men enough he would resign his com- mission, for he would not take men into the field and have them murdered the way they were on the beach, where they had ten to one against them. He said he could fight. them two to one, and if the war depart- ment would send him men, he would drive the enemy out of Spain and Portugal in a short time. Large reinforcements were accordingly hastened forward to relieve him, and Sir Roland Hill was sent out as second in command, with many other generals under him. Lord Wellington prepared his men for action, and he marched them to victory. In going through the country he fought many battles and gained many victories. He took their commissary and baggage- wagons, their artillery, and a large amount of money and other valuable property, besides many prisoners,   DAVID RUSSELL.       89 and sent them a11 to Salamanca. Wellington march- ed his troops forward, to another city, which was situated on an eminence, rendering it inconvenient and hazardous to attack. Sir Roland Hill, the second commander, took the left wing of the army and marched to the rear of the city; Lord Wellington took the right wing and at- tacked the city in front. By the time Lord Welling- ton gained the hill, with a very heavy loss- of men, the French and Spanish not knowing the movement of his left wing, directed all their forces to the front attack. During this time Sir Roland Hill had order- ed his men to advance, but not to fire a gun or make the least noise. Lord Wellington's troops were seriously disabled, and his position was becoming critical, when the left wing, having gained the hill, rushed on the foe with a mighty charge, defeated them and took thy city. Lord Wellington put the city under martial law, and issued a proclamation for all that were in favor of England to come forward, and they should be well treated; and all in favor of France also to come for- ward and be made prisoners of war. He then gave orders to secure all the prisoners, and to bury- the dead. Wellington ordered his engineers to fortify the town, for he soon expected an attack from the French. In the meantime he reinforced his ranks, so that he had a very large army. By this time Napoleon Bo- naparte fitted up a very large army, with which he intended to take the town by storming it; but when he, arrived, to his great astonishment 'he found the  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7685-00000022"/> 40      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OP city so strongly fortified, that it was impossible for him to enter; he then encamped his army near the city. Lord Wellington and Sir Roland Hill were  laying plans how they could attack the French, and were watching their movements with great vigilance. Accordingly they agreed to commence an attack in the night and endeavor to flank them. Lord Wel- lington's army was -very numerous, and they advanc- ed according to previous arrangement; they flanked them and surrounded them.  The French fought courageously, but they, were defeated. Lord Wel- lington and his guards, with the light cavalry, pur- sued Bonaparte to near Paris, where he was taken and brought back to Vittoria. He was put into the tower, and a double guard set over him; they took Napoleon's army and all his military stores. Lord Wellington immediately sent despatches to England, giving a true statement of all that was done. They sent out three frigates immediately, the fastest sailing ones that were in the navy. Napoleon was put aboard the frigate Sea Horse, and guarded by the other two, was taken to England. At this time the Emperor of Russia intrigued with Austria, Prussia and Germany, that they should demand Napoleon and have him beheaded; but Eng- land being experienced in war and the laws of war, wished to know by what authority they demanded him. They said he was such a tyrant and done -so much damage to the nations, and the whole worlds that he ought not to be allowed to live any longer. England replied to them that she had taken him as a prisoner of war, and as a prisoner of war he should   DAVID RUSSELL.       41 be treated. Immediately they built him a very strong stone house, on the Island of Elba, and fitted it in a splendid manner, when he was put into it with his attendants and guarded by a thousand troops. This island was rather small and barren, laying in the middle of the sea, in a soutlh latitude; it had some beautiful springs of water on it, and shipping passing by would sometimes stop to get water. Bo- naparte was allowed to walk around the island, with a guard. At this time there was an American ship' came in to water. Bonaparte was determined to try to get away in that ship if possible. He prepared himself by putting on his large mantle; in this man- tle there were two very large pockets, in each of which he put a bottle of brandy; he then told his servant to ask the sergeant of the guard to come and see him; accordingly the sergeant came. He'told the ser- geant he wanted to go to the watering place. (The main watering place was not far from the house.) The sergeant being an Irishman, he asked him if he would take shmething to drink. Yes, yer honor, and oblige to you," said the sergeant. He then poured him out a very heavy dram of French brandy, and handed it to lIim; he drank it down with a keen relish. The sergeant then said, Yer honor, I see you know how to treat a soldier!" "Yes," says Napo- leon, "I have had many thousands under my com- mand. Now, sergeant, I want you to let me go immediately to the watering place." There were always six soldiers, personally to guard Bonaparte, but he prevailed on the sergeant, saying, "Now, my good fellow, it is but 'a little way  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7685-00000023"/> 42      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF to the watering place, and what need is there of so many men going with me?" "Well, yer honor, I will pass you out and send you down with two of the guards!"When he arrived at the watering place he found everybody busy filling casks. He called one of the sailors up, and says to him, "If you will go aboard of your vessel and hand the captain this letter, I will give you a guinea." Two of the sailors got in the boat, pulled to the ship, and gave the cap- tain the letter. While the boat was gone, Bonaparte asked the two guards if they would take something to drink ; they said they would. He gave them both a stiff glass of brandy, and also treated the sailors. He now pulled out his spy-glass and saw the boat re- turning with the captain in it. He handed the two guards another glass of brandy each, and told them to go to the cave spring and sit down, and he would soon come around when they should have something more to drink, and some good water to mix with it; which directions were obeyed with alacrity. In the meanwhile the boat landed; the captain stepped on shore, and as he did so Bonaparte ,met him. "I have the honor of addressing Captain Nor- ris!" "Yes," observed the captain. "my name is James Norris." "Captain, I want you to come with me, I want to have a short conversation with you." He took him around to a high bluff of rocks, and they both sat down. "Now, captain, there is a chance for you to make more money than you ever made in your life in the same time!"   DAVID RUSSELL.       43 ' Well," says the captain, "I am an American,. and I go in for making money, I don't care how." "Now, captain, I am going to tell you something, and I want you to pledge your word and honor that you will keep it a secret; you know that I am- a prisoner on this desolate island!" "Yes, sir, I do know that you are, and I think it a great shame of England; but they have always used their tyranny and always will!" "Captain, if you will use your endeavors to get' me aboard your ship, and take me to Paris, I will give you a large amount of money." ' Well," says the captain, " if I had you aboard my ship I could get you to Paris, but I think it is im- possible to get you aboard." "Well, captain, I will tell you a plan by which you can do it; you have the most of your casks filled with water, and you must have your boats to tow them aboard; you bring a boat with a large hogshead in it, and have the head to slip in and out, and have four or six holes in it; I will come down this evening and work it with the guards, and while you are fixing your casks I will slip in the hogshead and you can slip off with me." This was agreed upon During the course of the day, he made provision with the sergeant and his guards, by treating them and giving them money, so that they allowed him to go freelyabout the island without much watching. He called, the sergeant of the guard and told him he wished- to take a walk out that evening, as the even- ings were long, and time passed heavily in confine- ment. He then treated him again, observing that-he  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7685-00000024"/> "      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF felt a great friendship to a soldier, for he was once a soldier himself. Hie then gave him a five pound note, and told him to treat himself and his company; adding, "Now, sergeant, if you will treat me right, you will get many a five pound." "Yer honor, sir, I know you are a gentleman, and I told the ser- geants of all the companies that you were a gentle- man, and that there was no danger of you!" ' Now, sergeant, I want you to let me go down to the watering place, let me have the same guard with me that I had this morning, for they are civil fellows,. and I want you to pass me through." "Yes, yer honor, I will!" and he did so. When he arrived at the watering place the boat was there, and the hogshead in it. The captain took no notice of Bonaparte, but hurried his men aboard their boats, telling them to get the casks aboard with all speed, and he would come in the last boat. In the meantime Bonaparte had treated his guard several times, so that they felt the effects of the liquor. He then gave them a bottle of brandy and told them to go around to the spring cave where he would be with them in a short time, and- unite with them in drinking the soldiers' health. To this proposal they readily assented. The captain in the meantime got his boat behind the bluff of rocks, where they had the conversation in the morning. Here Bonaparte joined the captain, and said to him, aside, "Captain, you know we must work very shrewd, you take this bottle of brandy and igive it to your men, tell them to go around to the spring and take a drink and come back immediately." As soon as the coast was clear,   DAVID RUSSELL.       45 Bonaparte stepped aboard the boat, and got in the hogshead, which was quickly headed up. By this time the men returned, and jumping aboard, made all speed to the ship, without any suspicion of what had transpired. Arrived at the ship, the captain ordered the double slings to be lowered down to the boat, and the cask was hoisted up and deposited in the hold. The rest of the casks were hoisted. in as quickly as possible. While this was being done, the captain ordered some of the men to go aloft and loosen the sails, and to sheet the topsails home. The sails were all set, the casks were all aboard, the cap- tain then slipped the anchor, and put to sea with a fair wind, crowding all sailfor Paris; studding-sails alow and aloft were set, and every rag of canvass done its duty. They had not been to sea many days before an English frigate overhauled them; Bona- parte creeps into his retreat again and was headed up. After the English had boarded the ship and left it, Bonaparte come out and went to the captain's cabin again; they had a fair wind and soon came on the coast of France. Bonaparte told the captain to land- him some distance from Paris. He then settled with the captain and. gave him a large amount of money, enough to completely satisfy him. The cap- tain bid him God speed, and told him he hoped that he would make England smart for what, they had done to him. Bonaparte having provided himself with a miller's dress, put on false whiskers and moustaches as white as snow, and went to Paris. He entered into all the hotels and all the public places where any public ,  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7685-00000025"/> "      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF business was going on; he being well learned -and knowing many different languages, and having studied human nature deeply, he could attract the attention of every one that heard him talk. Soon the news came to Paris that Bonaparte had escaped 1 from the island of Elba, and that five thousand pounds sterling was offered for his arrest. Bonaparte at this time was pumping and sounding the minds of the people. He was one day at the largest hotel in Paris, when he heard several of the officers and men say that they wished he was back again to Paris, for he was the best emperor and com- mander that ever France had, and that if ever he came back, all France would join him. At this time the whole country was excited about his leaving the island, and wondered if he would come back to Paris; if he would they would all join him.' Bona. parte having ascertained the minds of the people, he retired back to the country again, still keeping his miller's apparel on. He then sent for all the head officers to come to him, and sent carriages to bring them, and they all came. After they had entered the house and were all seated, Bonaparte had put on a white wig, which made him look still older; he stood up before them in his miller's clothes, and he looked about a hundred years old. He then address- ed them: "Fellow-citizens of France, I am an old man, well stricken in years, and I have been - acquainted with most of the Emperors of France and the Bonaparte family. I was acquainted with Napoleon's father and uncles and all the family, and a. smarter man   DAVID RUSSELL.       47 than Napoleon Bonaparte France has never seen; France was never governed better than it was when he was Emperor, and France never prospered- better. Now, fellow-citizens, I am an old man, as I observed before, and I have a few millions of francs, I would give them all -to have Bonaparte Emperor once more. Now, fellow-citizens, what is your opinion on the subject, in case he should come back again?" They said they would join him, and all France would join him,! The suggestion was received with the utmost enthusiasm. There was a large hotel in this town named "Na- poleon," and Bonaparte said, "Gentlemen, I have ordered a dinner for you at the Napoleon House; I have ordered the best liquors and the best wines that can be had in France for you. The carriages are now waiting at the door and we will drive up to the hotel."  The company numbered about fifty, most of whom were dressed in their uniforms. At the hotel they were invited into a large sitting-room, and from thence in a short time they were ushered into the dining-room, where a splendid dinner awaited them. The officers made many remarks while at dinner, and after they had done eating, the first cloth was taken off, and the second cloth, which was a green one, was put on. Now they were served with small plates, knifes and forks; tarts, cakes, nuts apd jellies of all kinds; and there were three pound cakes which were placed on the table at an equal distance apart. These pound cakes were decorated in the inost splendid style, and in the centre Of each cake stood an image of Napoleon Bonaparte in his full  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7685-00000026"/> 48       AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF uniform, with his sword drawn and presented. Around the cakes were written these words': "Viva! viva le Empereur! viva Napoleon Bonaparte!"The interpretation of these words was-"Long may Na- poleon Bonaparte live and triumph over his enemy!" The officers made many remarks; they began to say one to another, "is not this a splendid dinner? in fact, I have never eat a dinner so good in all my life! and see what splendid wines and liquors, and how elegantly it is got up!"They remarked that it must have cost a vast amount of money. The old miller was sitting at the head of the table; he now arose and addressed them: "Gentlemen and fellow-citizens, I would give a dinner to all France to see Napoleon Bonaparte Emperor of France!"At this, the band struck up, "Honor to Napoleon Bonaparte!"They drank many healths, and every health they drank the band played, and they kept it up to twelve o'clock that night.: Early the next morning the old miller took all their addresses. As they got into their carriages and were preparing to leave for Paris, the old miller said, "Gentlemen and fellow-citizens, I want you all to pledge your word and honor that you will be true to Napoleon Bonaparte if ever he comes back to Paris!" They shook hands with the old man,' pledging their honor as Frenchmen, and 'departed for Paris. The old miller formed a correspondence with those officers, from whom he learned that the British had found out that Bonaparte was lurking in Paris or its vicinity, and they demanded him from the French   DAVID RUSSELL.       49 government. They also advised Louis the X Vllth to raise a large army, for they knew Bonaparte would not, remain inactive for any length of time. The generals and other officers had become very friendly with the miller, and they imparted their feelings and purposes to him freely, and implored him, if he knew any thing -f Napoleon, to send him word to come on in full lniform, as the whole army that Louis had raised would join him. The old miller went back into the country and raised an' army of about 100,000 mei. They all swore and pledged their word and honor they would never surrender, but would die, to a mall, in the service of Napoleon. At this time Louis had heard that Bonaparte had raised an army of 600,000 men, whereat he was greatly alarmed. Louis now notified England of what he apprehended to be Bonaparte's- movements, that he had raised a large army of 600,000 men, &amp;c., and he petitioned the English to send him an army of assistance, for fear Napoleon would be too strong for him. England than fitted up a large army and gave Lord Wellington the command. Louis XVIII., with such forces as he could collect, Prussia, Austria and several other nations joined them. Now, at this time Napoleon had concentrated his forces near a small town, south of the Plains of Waterloo. His men were arrayed and equipped in the best manner. He had rein- forced his army, and made it as formidable in num- bers as possible, with large additions to his heavy and light artillery batteries. He now advanced to t he Plains, of Waterloo, and pitched his redoubts. 3  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7685-00000027"/> 50   .   AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF The old miller was dressed in an emperor's uniform, wearing his badges of honor that he had gained in many battles. The army of Louis XVIII. amounted to about 300,000 men, and they were formed in front of the English army. As soon as they advanced to the right of Napoleon's redoubt, the emperor galloped forward and presented himself before them. At the sight of their beloved general, they grounded their arms and cried aloud, "  V iva, 1'Emperor Napo- leon Bonaparte!' He now took command of the whole French 'army, and further extended his re- doubts. Lord Wellington, when he saw this, was astonished to think one man should have so much influence over a nation. Wellington pitched his redoubts to the left of Bonaparte, and was soon joined by the allied forces, when great preparations were made for a decisive battle. In the meantime, Napoleon went around his army, talking with all his officers and men, and cheered them up for battle. He reserved a guard of 50,000 men, that he kept back for the last charge. Wellington had 25,000 of his best men reserved also. He gave special directions concerning the rations of this reserved corps, ordering an extra supply for each man, in the eating and drinking line, until he should give further orders. They were fur- nished with the best of wines and liquors, andsthe best of provisions, and were fed up like Irish lords. Bonaparte had laid out his plans of attack, and all his officers understood it. His plan was that he would open on the enemy with the heavy artillery,   DAVID RUSSELL.       51 and follow up with a heavy charge of cavalry and infantry. In this way he held the field two days. At this time Wellington had a reinforcement, but Bonaparte still held his ground. The fourth day Bonaparte ordered up his reserved guard of 50,000 men, and Lord Wellington brought forward his 25,000 men, all stimulated up to the highest pitch. Wel- lington spoke to his men, and said, 5' Up, boys, and at them, and do your duty!"They rushed on with a mighty charge, and at' the third onset, they broke' the French lines and flanked them. The French troops then surrendered, and the whole army was taken prisoners, but Bonaparte fled. There was a, British sqventy-four gun ship, the Ajax, off the coast. and Bonaparte hired a waterman to take him aboard. When he reached the ship, he went aboard, and after saluting the officers, he told the captain he had some- thing private to say to him. The captain then in- vited him into the cabin, and after both were seated, Bonaparte said:-"Captain, I am obliged to inform you that I am your prisoner. I am Napoleon Bona- parte, formerly the Emperor of France!" The captain, with some surprise, replied,'"Sir, I am happy to see you. I have heard much talk about you, but I never saw you before. I feel highly hon- ored to have you aboard of my ship. I thought from the first sight of you that you were some very high officer, from the badges of honor you wear." "I surrender myself up, as a prisoner of war, under your protection, and I want you to pledge your word and honor that you will protect me," said Napoleon.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7685-00000028"/> 52      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF "I will protect you as long as my ship sails the water,' replied the English commander. Lord Wellington, as soon as the dead were buried and the wounded attended to, advanced to Paris, carrying his prisoners along with him. Prance was in a blaze of excitement, at the reception of the news of Bonaparte's defeat. It seemed as if the French- man's glory had departed, and the people were deeply moved. Now the Ajax lay off the coast of France, while the Russians were in search of Bonaparte, for weeks. At last they found out that he was on board the Ajax. The Emperor of Russia immediately sent two seventy-four gun ships to demand him, and they demanded him in the name of the Emperor of Russia. The captain of the Ajax replied that Bona- parte had surrendered himself to his majesty, King George the Third, and to him he should go. The commanders of the Russian ships said they would take him by force. The captain of the Ajax replied, ' Not as long as my ship sets on the water will I ever surrender him up to any nation." The captain of the Ajax ordered his guns to be double-shotted and rounds of grape and canister to be in readiness. He also ordered the boarders to be equipped, and every man to be ready to fly to his gun when ordered.  The Russians altered their milds, and abandoning the idea of an attack, left the Ajax and went to Paris. Now the Ajax made all sail for England, and in a few weeks arrived at Spit- head, off Portsmouth harbor. When he arrived, the cap  sent dispatches immediately to London to the , n    . ) s ,        .          ,   DAVID RUSSELL.       53 Board of Admiralty. A frigate was dispatched to take the distinguished prisoner to London, where he was put into a private dwelling, and kept until they prepared a very fine building for him on the island of St. Helena. When the building was ready, they sent him to the island of St. Helena, with a sufficient force to guard him, and there he lived and there he died. I now addressed the company: ' My narrative is told. You see in this history the finger of the- Almighty, in all parts of it. He raises up whom he will, and pulleth down whom he will; he maketh the weak strong, and the strong weak; he raises up nations and destroyeth- nations; he bindeth up the meek and lowly in spirit, and strengthens the feeble; he exalteth the humble, and the high he abaseth; he says,' Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom.' My young friends, I hope that we may all be heirs of that kingdom which our Lord and Saviour speaks of, and may the blessing of the Al- mighty be with us all. Amen." There was an aged gentleman present, who took particular notice of what I said. He observed,- "I am happy, indeed, that I have heard this lec- ture. I would not have missed hearing it for any thing, for certainly it is very edifying to any one to hear such a lecture. Now, young man, I have got sons and daughters older than you are, and I have read a great deal of history and heard a great many lectures, but I must say 1 have never heard one in my life that I have been as well pleased with as this; in fact, every thing has been explained in so clear a  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7685-00000029"/> 54      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF manner, that no one could help but understand it; and particularly in relation to the paternity of Bona- parte. I never heard it explained so clear before, and the way and manner he made such rapid pro- gress, as I always understood his father was very poor, but you have explained his history to the satis- faction of us all." He approached me, and taking me by the hand, said, "Young mail, my name is Thomas Brown, and here is my card. I live in the upper part of the Strand. Priscilla here knows very well where I live, for she often comes to visit my daughters. I under- stand that you are of the same name as herself;- your name is Russell-indeed you look enough alike to be brother and sister. I now invite you and Priscilla to come and see me, and I would be very happy to have you come. You will find plenty of associates-some older and some younger. You are but a young man, indeed, but you are wonderful old in knowledge., May the God Almighty bless you, and may he guide you safe into his kingdom, for the dear Redeemer's sake. Amen." Mr. Robertson observed, Gentlemen and ladies, I am highly gratified at having such a lecture and such company in my house; certainly it las been delivered in the most satisfactory manner, and been edifying to all. I have had but a short acquaintance with Mr. Russell, but the more I get acquainted with ehim the more I like him, and I hope he will not, leave us, for he is such a lively young man that he makes all lively around hims" At this, Miss Priscilla spoke and said, "Mr. Rob-   DAVID RUSSELL.       55 ertson, we young ladies don't calculate to ever let Mr. Russell go back to America; and I hope and trust we shall hear many lectures from him yet, for he lectures in the most splendid manner. His narra- tive is so clear, and he carries it out with such an air, that he almost makes it look like the very thing itself. I have often heard my father and uncle lec- ture, and I thought a great deal of it, indeed; but I never enjoyed myself as much in my life, under any lecture as I have under this. Now, Mr. Russell, we- young ladies, one and all, will stand up and give you our hearty thanks for your kindness and your noble disposition, and if this is a fair sample of the pro- ducts of America, I would wish to see many more, and I should also like to see the soil that you were raised on." All the rest of the young ladies responded, "Amen, amen."- It being now late, they read a chapter, sung a hymn, and then all kneeled down and en- gaged in prayer. Mr. Brown offered a most fervent petition; he prayed for every one in the house, and in fact, for the whole world. He prayed long and earnestly, and before he closed, especially remem- bered the young man from North America,-that the Almighty might protect him and guide him into all truth, and into his kingdom at last, for the dear Redeemer's sake. We sat a little while, and each one retired to his bed. About this time, the whole talk throughout the papers, and in every one's mouth was about going to war with America. I then examined the papers for myself, and I saw the President's message to Con ,       .  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7685-00000030"/> 56       AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF gress. He said, in his address, "I am not a warrior or a fighting man; neither am I a coward. I see the United States of America has either got to fight or be imposed upon. Now, gentlemen of the Senate, and House of Representatives, my opinion is, that if Great Britain will not stop overhauling our ships and dishonoring our colors, we must seek recom- pense by the sword, as we cannot get it any other way. I leave it with the legislators of the country, to make such provisions as they think necessary,-to appropriate money to raise our army and navy to a condition for an immediate war. I see no way of escape for the country, from dishonor and outrage, but war, as Great Britain will not answer our re- quest or our petition." After I read this in the paper, I began to think that where there was so much smoke there must be some fire. I then perused the papers daily, to see if I could find any ship going to America. At this time Priscilla came down to Mr. Robertson's, and she said to me, "Mr. Russell, I should like to go out to Spittlefields." "Priscilla, I can take you to Spittlefields.; but you know we made a promise to make a visit to Mr. Brown's. What I do I must do quickly, as I shall not be long in England-." At this Priscilla drooped her head, and when she raised it again, the tears w6re trickling down her cheeks. This touched my young and tender heart, and the responsive tears were stealing down my own cheeks. I then embraced her and kissed her, and our tears were mingled together. I then said to her, i";   DAVID RUSSELL.       57 Priscilla, what have I done that makes you feel so badly?" "Mr. Russell-Mr. Russell, you have almost broken my heart; if you had pierced a dagger to my heart you could not have made me feel worse. I have always been happy in your company, and I expected to enjoy many happy seasons with you; but to hear you talk about leaving England,-it-breaks my very heart. Now, Mr. Russell, I want you to tell me the truth, which I know you will, for you are bold, frank, and honorable: are you offended at the people in England?" "No, Priscilla, my dear, I am not. God forbid that I should be offended at any one that has treated me as well as they have. I love and respect them, particularly those that I have been acquainted with." After a moment's pause, she said, "My dear David, what is it you want? Do you want money?" " No, Priscilla, I don't want money." "I have a few thousand pounds," said this dear girl,!' left me by my grandmother, and if you stay in England you shall have it all; for I have never seen a young man in my life that I had so nuch love for as for you. My whole heart and soul are wrapped up in you. I could be happy with you in a dungeon, on dry bread and water. You have such a kind, friendly, open, and frank disposition that no one could help but take notice, of it. Mr. Russell, you promised to tell me the truth, and I hope you will." "Well, Priscilla, on my word and honor, I will tell you the truth. I want my country to have its freedom and its rights. I see by the English papers 3*  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7685-00000031"/> 58      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF there is nothing but oppression and tyranny awaits it, and I know the people of the United States will not submit to it, as the people of America are free and independent; always cherishing freedom and liberty. They are bound to protect the rights of their nation and the rights of their commerce on the high seas. Now, Priscilla, if I could have another interview with you, I would tell you the whole senti- ments of my mind, for I love you as I love my own soul, and I would lay down my life for you." "Well, Mr. Russell, I always knew that there was something peculiar about you, as you appear dif- ferent from any other American I ever saw; you appear to be so much attached to your country." "Well, Priscilla, as you and I are going to Spittle- fields tomorrow, I will tell you as we go along." ' Oh, no, Mr. Russell, I don't want you to wait till tomorrow, for I want you to tell me now. I assure you every thing shall be private." I then addressed her,--"Priscilla, I want you to take particular notice of what I say, and weigh it deeply in your mind. I am -the son df John t., Russell; my father had three brothers; they were all born in England, in the city of Winchester, County of Hampshire, in the south part of England. My father was the oldest. Now at the time when they were all boys, their father fixed up and went to America, and landed in Boston. My mother's father, about the same time, went from Bath to Boston. My mother's name was Martha Isabella Reaves; her father's name was William H. Reaves. Mr. Reaves had two sons and two daughters.   *, .     DAVID RUSSELL.        59 "After they had each secured nice farmns, they went to work' clearing their lands and cultivating them; they planted corn and potatoes, pumpkins and garden truck. The country was thinly settled, in- deed, but the Indians were very numerous, and every thing the whites could spare they had to give /to the Indians, to keep on good terms with them, that they would not massacre them, though they had scarcely enough for themselves to subsist on. They lived that way for several years, clearing a little more land every season. At last they had a snug little farm  cleared up, so that they could live very comfortable.  The settlers were very much attached to each other; they were very friendly, and would help each other to clear the land. "After a timb tliose boys and girls were grown to be young men anld women, and on one occasion my father was invited to attend a party at Mr. Reaves'. My father and mother having, been raised together, they were wonderfully attached to each other, and their affection had often been manifested. My father went to the party, and they had a splendid supper, and afterwards a ball. The house was built of logs, covered with bark, and the floor was made of slabss; they kept up the ball until about twelve o'clock. That night my father had Martha Isabella for a part- ner, and he paid his addresses to her for about two years, at the end of which time they were married. My father now bought a farm a short distance from the town  of Boston, ald set up a family establish- ment for himself. "The country began to settle very fast; settlers  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7685-00000032"/> 60       AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF P coming from all parts of EUrope. The town of Bos-- ton was an English settlement, and 'among the earli- est made in America. Another settlement was made in Jamestown, on the James River, in Virginia. They settled so fast that they/formed 'thirteen colo- nies, but we called them states. Every thing now was in prosperity, and the country was flourishing very fast. All the high officers, and judges, and a governor were sent out from England to each colony, and all other officers were made in their own coun- try. My father being very active and smart, and of good learning, was chosen magistrate by the people, and he served as a magistrate for several years. He was also chosen captain of one of the militia com- panies. Some time after this he was chosen sheriff, of his county, in which capacity he served for several years. Now, he being a good mathematician and an excellent scholar, was chosen as assistant in the engineer department;. after serving a few years as assistant engineer, they made him a full engineer, in which capacity he served several years. His plans and estimates were correct and neatly made, and when they were sent to Enfgland to be examined by the engineer department, they found them so correct and so well executed that they sent him a commis- sion as chief of the engineer department, He held that office until the English began to impose upon the Americans by oppressive enactments. "Now at this time there was a great excitement in. America, so that the people formed committees of safety. As most everybody was acquainted with my father,- and he had a very large and commodious   DAVID RUSSELL.        61 house, one of these committees made an appointment to meet at his house every night. They formed a resolution to get up petitions to send to England, to show them the situation of the country; they also agreed for my father to draw up copies of the peti- tion, so that each delegate had a copy; and they were drawn up in a masterly manner. The news reached England that the people of America were disaffected to the government, and that John H.* Russell and his three brothers were ringleaders of it. But they were not disaffected; they only wanted to' show the government of. England that they were not able to pay the heavy taxes imposed. At length the delegates arrived in England with their petition, and the English government put them all in prison, for treason against the crown. Some of them  died in prison, and very few ever got back to their families. "At this time, England, instead of answering their petition, sent a large army to America, and ship loads of tea, and determined to force the tea tax on them. When the people of Boston   saw this, they went aboard the ships, and threw the tea overboard. This enraged the British government, so they termed them all rebels; then they issued a proclamation to each colony, inviting all those in favor of England to come forward'and join the English army, and if they did not want to join the army, they should go to Canada and Nova Scotia, and  be protected oby the British government.   About this time there was a very heavy reinforcement of troops landed, which made a large army in America.  At the sight of -this large army, the tories turned their coats and joined the  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7685-00000033"/> 62      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF British. The English issued a second proclamation, informing all the officers that were in commission before the British army landed, that if they would * come forward, they should have commissions in the British army. The result was that many went and joined them. They also sent letters to my father and uncles, telling them the consequence, if they were taken; that they should be shot down or hung up at a moment's notice, and they had better come and join the army and receive their commissions. "My father and uncles utterly refused them, and said they would'not go. The commander offered a large amount of money to any one that would take them and bring them to the British camp. In the meanwhile the Americans were appointing their offi- cers and raising an army. At this time George Washington, of Virginia, was appointed Commander- in-chief, of the American army. Waslington had beell a colonel in the British army, and served under General Braddock. He was ili the battle at Brad- dock's defeat, and the very man who told General Bra ddock that if he would' attack them ,the way he did he would lose his army. The reply that General Braddock made to the 'olonel was, ' I am come to a pretty pass, to be dictated to by a young buckskin like you!-a British general to be dictated by a youlng buckskin like you!' "Now Waslington had fought many battles with the Indians, in the woods, and he understood well how to attack them; but Braddock attacked the Indians as he had calculated, and the Indians ad- vanced/on them and massacred nearly all his army,   DAVID RUSSELL.       63 except a few that fled and made their escape, among whom was General Washington.   Braddock and  most all his officers were killed. The Indians then robbed the dead of all the valuable articles they had; secured the prisoners and scalped them. This Wash- ington was the man the Americans had chosen for their commander-in-chief. General Washington ac- cepted the post,.and as soon as possible collected an army of infantry and artillery. He divided them into divisions, and took them into different parts of the wilderness, and encamped them. He had them so arranged as to bring them all together at short notice, if any thing should happen to make it nec- essary. "At this time the British had sent spies to see if they could find my father and uncles; they learn- ed to their great astonishment that they were out of their reach; that my uncle, Thomas Russell, had gone to Bunker Hill to command a regiment, and my other two uncles and my father had gone with General Washington, who had made them all high officers, and that it was probable they could not catch -them. Those spies belonged to the British light cavalry; as they were going back, there were twelve American horsemen, away back in the woods, who saw by their dress that they were British cav- alry, and that they were walking their horses and talking as they were going back. The American boys determiled to cut them off; they took a circuit round and come out ahead on the same road that the British horsemen were going, and as quick as they came up to them they were ordered to surren-   &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7685-00000034"/> "      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF. der, which order was promptly obeyed, They took their swords, pistols and carbines, -and escorted them to the American camp. "At this time the American General, (Putnam,) had got his trenches dug around Bunker Hill, and his troops arranged in them. He gave orders to his men not to fire a gun until the enemy came near enough to see the white of their eyes, and every man to have his gun loaded with two buckshot and a ball, not to lose any fire, but to take deadly aim and every one to kill a man. The American army was in a, trench six feet deep, so that the British bullets would have no effect on them, but pass over their heads. The British army advanced with a quick march, and as they came up pretty close to the en- trenchments the Americans opened a tremendous fire on them, which threw confusion and death into their ranks, and caused them to make a hasty re- treat. The British troops were rallied and again marched to the attack, but they were again driven back with tremendous slaughter. The next attack' was at' the point of the bayonet, and, as the Amer- icans were out of powder, they were obliged to re- treat, fighting hand to hand. The, British officers sprung upon the American officers sword in hand, and the retreating fight was very desperate. A Brit- ish colonel flew at my uncle, calling him a rebel, and said he would have his life, but my uncle parried his blow and run him through. "The reason they disliked my father more than all the rest, was, because he had always held a high office under the British government, and because he   DAVID RUSSELL.       65 had written books and given lectures against the gov- ernment, which he would never: have done, had not the English treated the Americans in the way they did when they sent their delegates with their peti- tions, putting them in prison instead of giving them redress, as they ought to have done. They imposed heavier taxes and heavy burdens on them, and this roused the ambition of my father and my uncles, and all America. And now Priscilla, this rouses my ambition, so if there comes war I shall go and fight to maintain the freedom of America and for the honor of my country's flag. Priscilla, I don't want you to think hard of me: if the circumstances were not just as I have told you, I would stay in England; but the case is as it is, and I must go to America or become a citizen of EDigland. Certainly, I would rather go back to my own country, the place of my birth, where I had many happy hours and pleasant seasons in my childhood; where I stood around the hills, valleys and groves, and wandered up and. down the silver streams; where I have played around tthe oak, the walnut, the pine and chestnut trees with my playmates; where I could see the green ivy twining around the trees, and the wild grape of different kinds ; and in the spring of the year I could see the wild plum and the wild apple, and all the trees of the forest that nature has caused to blossom; and the cattle and sheep on the hills, and many maidens playing and skipping, and playing from val- ley to valley, and hill to hill; where I can see the glory of God in every thing as far as my eyes be- hold; where I can see the ripe and yellow corn,  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7685-00000035"/> "       AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF lofty and high; where I can see the yellow pump- kins and melons of all kinds, and fruits of every kind and color, and grain of all kinds that any land produces; where I can see the land of liberty and freedom; where I can see the banner of -stars and stripes floating over the land which is mighty to behold, and will be mighty indeed; where it shines from shore to shore, from east to west, from north to south, and triumphs from pole to pole over the seas; where I see the land of the free and the home of the brave; where I see prosperity showering down as rain from the Almighty; where I see the blessings of the Almighty on those that obey him and serve him; where I see the righteous passing down as a ripe shock of corn into Christ's kingdom; where I see the blessing of God on all those that love and obey him; where I can hear them sing praises to God the Father, forever, amen!" "Well, Mr. Russell, I don't wonder you want to go back to America, for I see you are wonderfully attached to your country; indeed, not only attached to America, but I see you are a true and loyal son to America. I have often heard tell of a true Amer- ican, but I never saw one so devoted as you are. Now, Mr. Russell, I want you to tell me if all the American people are like you in sentiments?" "Yes, Priscilla, my dear, all true Americans are of exactly the same sentiments as I am, and they would lose the last drop of blood in their bodies for their country and the honor of their flag!" "Well, David, if you must go, you must; but I shall never take any comfort after you are gone, for   DAVID RUSSELL.        67 it grieves my very soul to think of it. My whole heart was attached to you the very first time I saw you; little did you know my feelings when we stood up together at Mr. Robertson's, while they were look- ing at us to see how much we looked alike. I de- clare, Mr. Russell, I should like to go with you!" "Well, Priscilla, you can go, and I will take you to my uncle William Russell's. He is now living, and has a plantation in Tennessee and another in Alabama, but he is now living in Tennessee, and there you will be as well treated as you would in your mother's house, and I shall be there, backwards and forwards, all the time, for that is my home at this present time. You will find my aunt to be one of the finest women that ever the sun shone upon, and she would be happy, indeed, to have you come there, Priscilla. You shall have- every thing you want; there is every kind of music that a lady wants, and he has as splendid a library of books as can be found in America; he has also two daughters, elegantly accomplished, and a son; you know my principles, and he is the very same as I am in honor- able feelings. My uncle has a plenty of company to see him; he is not a day without some company, and he has carriages and horses of different kinds, so that you can go anywhere you would like to through the country. You will only have to say the word, and the carriage will be ready, with a driver and a foot- man, and I will be ready at any time to go with you. Now, Priscilla, I have given you a true statement of my uncle and his folks, and it is for you to say! whether you will go or not. I will pledge my word  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7685-00000036"/> 68      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF and honor that I will protect you at the risk of my life." "Mr. Russell, you almost persuade me to go." "I would not only almost, but I would altogether wisli that you would go; it would please my uncle and aunt so much to have a lady from England-to come and see them, and particularly of the same name. They would treat you as their own daughter, and my two cousins, Maria and Matilda, are amiable young ladies and of beautiful disposition." "Well, Mr. Russell, if my ma will let me go, I will go!" At this time Maria Robertson came into the parlor with a newspaper in her hanld. "Mr.-Russell," said she, "I have got some news to tell you, but I am very sorry to have to tell it to you!" "Why, Maria," I inquired, " is it any thing very bad?" "Not for you, but it is for us young'ladies. My pa and ma, and brothers and sisters had made calculations that you were going to stay with us cer- tainly a year' or two, but this paper was sent by a gentleman, through the post-boy, expressly for you." "Well, Maria," said I, handing her back the paper, " please read the advertisement out aloud." She then read it thus: "The ship Lady Jane will leave London in four weeks for Boston. Slhe is a splendid and conmmodious American ship, about four hlundred tons burden. Her cabin is commodiously fitted up for passengers, both ladies and gentlemen. AH1 wishing to go to Boston will apply at the office at   DAVID RUSSELL.       69 Blackwall Dock, or on board the Lady Jane, com- manded by Captain William Price; first mate, Wil- liam Parker; second mate, Stephen Ross." "Well, Mr. Russell," said Maria, "I suppose we shall now lose you." "I don't know, Maria, it depends upon circum- stances; I shall first go aboard the ship and examine it, and see how it suits me; also, I shall see how I like the captain and officers, and the crew; but if it is the Captain William Price that I was acquainted with in Boston I shall surely go, if it is the Lord's will and nothing prevents me. With that captain William Price I am well acquinted. He knows me and all my folks, and I have had many happy hours with his sons and daughters. Now, Maria and Pris- cilla, I want you to listen to me and take particular notice of what I have to say to you. Something strikes me that this is the same captain I know; it is a long time since I have seen captain Price or his family; the last time I went to see him I was much smaller than I am now. I was then dressed in a midshipman's uniform, and he may not know me; but I shall know him the moment I see him. Now, Priscilla, I want you and Maria to get ready, and I shall get a hack. and I will take you down with me. There is one thing I want you to understand before we go'-I want you to walk with me up the gang-way, one on each side, and continue with me on the quarter-deck, and if it is the captain Price I know, 1 will give you each a little touch with my ellbow, and 1 want you to take particular notice of what he says." , They then left me to prepare themselves for a ride. t        .   &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7685-00000037"/> 70'      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF In a short time they were down again in the room, but the hack had not yet come up. They were dress- ed in the most splendid manner; Priscilla was dressed in a 'pea-green silk dress, and as it changed its shade it gave a beautiful orange hue; it was tastefully figured, and between each figure was represented a flat sea-shell. She wore a bright * purple silk apron, with the corners rounded off, a beautiful scarf and a splendid white silk bonnet, trimmed with white roses, tinged witl green. Maria had a light purple silk dress, which presented a shade of crimson red; it was made plain, but very neat. She wore a scarf and a prettily trimmed bonnet of the same color; they were beautiful girls to behold. Soon the carriage was ready. I found that our driv- er was an Irishman, and a funny fellow, too. I said to him, "Sir, do you know the ship Lady Jane, that is laying off Blackwall Dock?" "Yes, yer honor, well do I know her, and I know her commander, sir!" Said I, "What is her commander's name?" "Yer honor, sir, his name is Price, and he has got as fine a ship as ever came on the river Thames; and sir, are you going aboard that ship?" I told him I was, and ordered him to drive on and have us there as quick as possible. As we drove along, I said to the girls, "Now, girls, I want you to mind particularly what I say to you; when I go on the quarter-deck I shall make a short lecture, and I want you to take particular notice of what I say; also, take particular notice of the ship's ensign, and of the ship when you are invited down into the cabin. r   ;      DAVID RUSSELL.       71 Above all, I want you to take particular notice of what the captain says, so that when you go home you can tell'your pa all about it." By this time we had passed through the main street of Blackwall Dock and were going down Blackwall Avenue, that took us straight down to the shipping. As we drew near to the ship, every thing appeared most beautiful. I looked out of the window and said, "Girls, there is the ship we are going aboard of!" "What," said Maria, " that ship which -has that pretty flag on it! 'I "Well," said she, "That is a pretty flag, indeed ; I don't know as I have ever seen a flag like. that before!' Priscilla said, "She is a very beautiful ship! and see, how nicely she is painted!" "Yes," said I, " when you see her cabin you will see something very splendid!"At this time the hack drove up to the gangway. I said to the. driver, "How long will it take you to feed your team?"9 "Well, yer honor, that will depend on yourself!" said he. "I may want to stay only one hour and I may want to stay three; H can't tell until I see the cap- i tain; can I depend upon you?" "Yes, yer honor, I will do every thing I say! i "Well, sir, I want you to be here yourself in one hour." I took out my watch and showed him the time. "In one hour I can give you an answer, and in that time you can have your horses fed." He as- sured me that all should be done as I said. I then gave him a shilling and told him to go and treat him- self.  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7685-00000038"/> 72      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF "Sir," said he, "you're'a gentleman-but not an English one; I know you are an American, for you have no English brogue on your tollgue!" We walked, up the gang-way, and I got on the quarter-deck, between the binnacle and taffrail. I requested the girls to sit down with. me here a few mo- ments, one on eacl side of me. Tile sailors were all busy taking in their cargo. I said to the girls, "I told you I had a short lecture to make on the quar- ter-deck. I feel happy and thankful to-day to come on board a ship of my own nation, and I do feel thankful to God that lie has ever protected, guided and preserved me, and I do heartily and sincerely pray to the God of heaven that he will ever protect my own nation from their enemies, and that he will cause that flag to flourish from one end of the earth to the other; that it may be an example to all the nations of the earth; that they might see in that flag an example to the Whole world; of friendship, freedom, liberty and equal rights to all; and that the nations of the earth may regard it as such." By this time the captain came upon deck, when I jumped up and said," Good afternoon, captain!" "Yes, sir, good afternoon; and it is a veiy fiie afternoon!" The moment I heard him speak, I knew it was my old friend. I immediately gave the girls a touch with my elbow, and they answered me. I said, "Captain, according to your advertisement, I see you are bound for Boston in four weeks." "Yes, sir, he replied, ' My advertisement says in four weeks; but I am afraid that I shall have to leave   DAVID RUSSELL.       73 sooner, as they are about to lay an embargo on all American vessels, and if I don't get away I shall lose my ship." "Well," said I, "Captain, I want to go with you!" "What,"-he replied, " do you want to go to Bos- ton?" "Yes, sir, I do!" "Are you a native of Boston?" "I am, sir!" "Was you born in Boston?" "Yes, sir, I was born in the city of Boston!" "Certainly, you talk like a Bostonian. Can I have the liberty of asking whose son you are?" "O yes, sir." "Well, sir, whose son are you?" "I am the son of John H. Russell!" He made a long pause-then said," "My God, can this be David!" "Yes, sir, I am the boy that stood in the counting- room day after day." "Well, David, I am as happy to see you as if you were my own child, for I never expected to see you in England!" and he took my hand and gave it a hearty shake. I then introduced the girls to him- "Captain, this is the daughter of Mr. Robertson; her name is Miss Maria Robertson; and this is Miss Priscilla Russell, the daughter of Mr. Russell." He now invited us down into the cabin and showed us the accommodations of the ship. The cabin was fitted up in the highest style, with the best Brussels carpet and beautiful looking pictures and glasses of all kinds. 4  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7685-00000039"/> 74       AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF After this, we sat down on the sofa; he then rung the bell and the steward came up. He ordered the steward to make tea and serve it up in the highest style, for he had a 'friend come to see him that he thought as much of as his own son. By this time the Irish driver was inquiring -for the American gen- tleman. The captain and myself went on deck and the driver said, c Yer honor,' I have this half hour1 been waiting for you; how soon are you going back?"The captain interposing, said, "Not till to- morrow.' "Well," said I, "I am willing to stay if  the girls' are.'" 'Well, -well," said the captain, "come again in about an hour;" pulling out his watch and telling him the time. - I then gave Paddy an English sixpence, and told him not to get tipsy, for I should have two'ladies with me, and I should not like to have the carriage upset. "O, yer honor," he replied, "I never was after upsetting a carriage in my life." The captain and I returned to the cabin and sat down, when we entered into conversation. The cap- tain remarked, "Young ladies,'I am well acquainted with David's father and all his uncles, and was ac- quainted with them long before David was born or thought of, and four better men never were born. David's father was the oldest of the four brothers, and the smartest of them all, and through his smart- ness and his kindness he made his three. broth- ers rich; but David's father was richer than all the others. Soon after David was born -his father died, so that he knows very little about him. He thlen grew -and became a very handsome child, so that   DAVID RUSSELL.        75 the ladies of Boston and the vicinity around used to go to see the young child, and they would give him presents and gifts, and say, ' What a beautiful child he is.' In about. two years after this his mother died. In the time of his mother's sickness the nurse agreed to bring David up; but in the time of his fa- ther's sickness, his uncle, Thomas Russell, had made an agreement with his father, by an oath, that if any thing should happen to his mother, he would take and bring him up and make him equal to his own children." By this time the tea was ready and we were all seated, the captain occupying the head of the table. A lively chat was engaged in while we were sipping our tea, and after being again seated in the cabin, the captain recommenced his narration: "The ladies used to Come to see the orphan child, bringing him many gifts, and they would often take him out of the cradle and kiss him. Now there was a very rich old lady living about ten miles from Bos- ton, who had heard from her neighbors of the or- phan being such a beautiful child, and as she was very fond of children, having none of her-own, she made many inquiries in regard to the age, size and looks of the child. This old lady then had an assortment of the finest clothes made up appropriate for the child and ordering her carriage she proceeded to pay the little one a visit. She succeeded in finding the resi- dence of the child, and after the usual ceremonies she was invited into the house. The child was lay- ing asleep in the cradle, and she asked the nurse if that was the orphan child?  The nurse said, ' They  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7685-00000040"/> 76       AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF call it the orphan child!' The lady observed that it was a beautiful looking child, indeed. She said she had heard much talk about it, but never saw it before. At this she told her footman to bring in a small box that was in the carriage. When it was brought in she took from it a large amount of cloth- ing, and told the nurse she brought them for the baby, and she wanted to know from the nurse if she could have the baby; if she could, she would be- queath part of her fortune to it, and would have it nursed and properly brought up. The nurse told her that Mr. Russell was coming in a few days for the baby, and as she had agreed with its mother to nurse it, she was going with it. The old lady left the clothes and- went back home in her carriage. "The next day Mr. Russell came in his carriage and took the chld and the nurse home with him. The baby's aunt took a dislike to the child from the very first; but as the child grew up-everybody admired him, all were friends to him but his aunt. He suffer- ed under this aunt, until he was sixteen years old, awhen he said to his uncle one day, ( Uncle, I bave come to the conclusion, that seeing I have neither father or mother, I will go into the navy as a mid- shipman, and you may take some of my money that my father left me and put me in the navy.' Accord- ingly he was sent to West Point, and was there two years. He made great progress in his learn- ing.

David was always considered by all that knew him o   DAVID' RUSSELL.

The rea- son the unicles leave David money is, because it was the interest of the money his father lent them. His father was immensely rich; he being always. in office, accumulated a large amount of money and was beloved by all who knew him. In fact, I never saw a better man than he was; he was one of the main pillars in gaining  the independence of America. He and his three brothers were all very smart men. Now, ladies, I   have given you a  short history of David's life and his parentage; all this I was eyewitness to, for I did not live a quarter of a  mile from Col. Russell's house." At this time the Irishman came on board again, inquiring for the American gentleman, and he was deeply under the effects of the eighteen pence I gave him.   "Well, yer honor," said he, "are you ready?" "Yes," I   replied, fetch your carriage up as quick as possible." The carriage was brought up; we shook hands with the captain, bidding him adieu, and started for home. The driver's tongue at first went faster than the horses, and he cut and slashed his whip around so that he kept every thing out of his way, and finally his horses went like a streak of lightning. When we  arrived at the house, I  discharged the  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7685-00000041"/> 78,      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OP driver, giving him another sixpence, for which he enthusiastically thanked me, exclaiming, "Long life to your honor! I know you are a gentleman!" After we were all seated in the house, I said, "Well, girls, how did you like Captain Price and the ship, and all you have seen to-day? Maria, I want you to tell first, in the presence of your father and mother; you know I told you to remember all that you heard and saw, so that you could tell it to your parents." "Well, I will," she commenced. "We saw an American ship and an American flag, and I went aboard and took tea, and I must say; indeed, I never saw any thing so nice as the cabin, and such a hand- some carpet, and sofa, and chandeliers, and pictures, and glasses of all kinds, and such handsome colors, with the stripes and stars; they looked beautiful indeed. And such handsome chairs as were in the cabin, and we had a splendid tea, and so elegantly got up; such fine cakes, and tarts, jellies of all kinds, and the best of wines, in fact, nobody could have a better tea than that was, and the captain knows Mr. Russell and all his folks, and speaks very highly of him, of his parents, and his uncles. He said there could not be a smarter and better man than John H. Russell, David's father, and he also said that he was one of the main pillars in gaining the independence of America, and that David's father was very rich, and was the making of the other three brothers. He said that David is very wealthy; his father and his uncle Thomas left him a large amount of money, and his ufncle William will leave him a large amount.   m             DAVID RUSSELL.       7 The captain is a fine, bold looking man, and says h is nearly seventy years old. He has dark, piercin jjj;i! eyes and a bright countenance. He says he has fo; lowed the sea for upwards of forty years." "Now, Priscilla, I want you to 'tell something tha you saw." Priscilla responded :---"Mr. and Mrs. Robertson, i jsay I never enjoyed myself better in all my life, fo hji  , j every thing indeed, was in such high order, it looke( like a palace. And the captain was so polite, kind and clever, no one could help enjoying themselves Xiijji He felt so much excited at seeing David, that h( immediately ordered the steward to bring in the besy of wines, cakes and jellies, and he ordered tea to b got up in the highest style; it was, indeed, the besi Ji   I ever saw. He gave us a sketch of David's life and Ijjj  parentage, and it seemed by what he said that he is well acquainted with all his folks, and well acquainted with David, and I have no doubt but what he is, from  the way he acted. I am  happy, indeed, for David's sake, and for all our sakes; we all thought David an honorable young man, but now it is con- iJj j  firmed in our own country, from what the captain says; it certainly confirms it in the highest order." Priscilla asked me andf Maria if we would go tomorrow and see her mother and father. We both agreed to go, and to start early in the morning. The first thing in the morning I saw, was a car- riage waiting at the door, and the girls were dressed so nice they looked like two angels. We all got into the carriage, and soon arrived at Priscilla's house. We were invited into the sitting-room; and she in-  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7685-00000042"/> 80      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF troduced me to her mother, by saying, "This is the young man that I told you: looked so much like me." Her mother put her spectacles on, and she looked me right in the face. "La! nmy dear child, he certainly does look like you ; he is the very image of you." The old lady continued, "I understand you  are from North America?" "' Yes, ma'am, I am." "And how do you like England?" "I like it very well, ma'am, indeed." ' Do you find much difference in the people of this country and the people of America?" "Yes, ma'am, I do." "How do you account for the difference, when the most of them went from England?" "Yes, ma'am, I know there were a great many settlers came from England to America. I suppose, ma'am, you have read the history of America?" "No, sir, I never did, nor ever traveled in Amer- ica." ' Well, ma'am, then you can't know much about it. I have read the history of England and America, and traveled in America and in England." "Then of course you can tell me the difference in the people?' "The people of England are ruled by a limited -monarch, and they have laws accordingly; they have to submit to every one that is superior to them, and bow to them, and the superiors rule the inferiors, and sometimes very severely. It is not so in Amer- ica, for there Jack is as good as his master. The   people of America rule America; they know no sup riors. Every officer in America is voted, in by th people, and the longest term their highest office serves is four years; so you see, that if an office don't suit the people, they will have him out of offic ! -i and put in another one; consequently the peopl 74 li: have the ruling of the country. It is not so in Eng land, for your king goes in by his birthright, an( stays in as long as he lives, if he is ever so bad You see it is different in America; if they don't d( their duty we put them out of office. All the lords ir ;!!! England also go in by their birthright."  "Yes, young man, that is the way it is in Eng i'-i land; but do tell me something about America!" At this time, Mr. Russell came in, and his wife said to him,  "This is a young gentleman from !North America. His name is David Russell. He is a young man who is stopping at our neighbor Rob- ertson's. Priscilla has invited him over to see us, and I am, for my own part, very happy he has -come, for he is a very friendly and sociable young man, appa- rently, and I find there is much knowledge to be gained from him.  So now, James, you need not be afraid to ask him any questions, for he is ready and willing to answer them." "Well," -said the father, "he has a fine and bold looking countenance, indeed." By this time he got his spectacles on, and looked steadfastly ins my face, when he exclaimed, , Why , mother, he is the very image of Priscilla!" "Yes," said she, "I know he is, for I saw it as soon as I looked at him.  Sit down, James, for the !, '*  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7685-00000043"/> 82       AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF young man is going to tell us something about America.". ' Well, Mr. and Mrs. Russell, I will endeavor to give you a short sketch of America. America is a fine, beautiful, fertile country; it abounds in hills, valleys, and prairies, and we have all kinds of lati- tude. In our southern latitude we can raise cotton, rice, sugar, corn, hemp, flax, and grain of different kinds; also we can raise all kinds of fruit-oranges and lemons, bananas, plantains, cocoa nuts, and tea and coffee. This is what we can raise in the south part of the United States. In our middle states we raise wheat of all kinds in .abundance, oats, barley, rye, corn, and beans of every kind and color, and peas. The middle and eastern states are manufacturing states. We manufacture in those states every thing you manufacture in England, and in abundance. Our western states abound in prairies which are beautiful to behold, particularly in the spring of the year, when every thing is in blossom, as far as your eye can behold. You can see flowers of every hue, color, and shade under the sun, on those prairies. We raise a vast number of cattle, sheep, hogs, horses, and mules, besides beef in abundance, grain, hemp, and flax." "Are the people in America the same as you are?" "The people in America are bold, friendly and full of hospitality ; courageous for the rights of their country!"  "' Are their colors like our English colors?" "No, ma'am, they're not; our ensign is a striped   ]DAVID RUSSELL# red and white, carrying a blue jack at one, corner; in this jack there is a white star for every state in- the Union. There, now, Mrs. Russell, I have given you a short sketch of America !" " Well, young man, I am extremely obliged to you for your kindness; you are certainly excellent com- pany. Indeed, I should like to have you stay with us a few weeks if you would. You look like a very young man, indeed, to be so far from home; you appear to have a great knowledge of history and of the world for such a young man. I expect your mother feels very bad about your being so far away. I could not bear the thought of letting a child of mine go out of England !" "Well, ma'am, as touching my mother, I have got no mother living!" "Is your mother dead ?" "Yes, ma'am, my mother died when I was quite young !" "You have a father, I suppose ?" " No, ma'am, I have no father !" "What ! is your father dead !" "Yes, ma'am, they both died when I was a baby, and my father died first." At this time a   carriage drove up to the door, and the driver delivered Priscilla a note, written to Mr. Robertson, to invite Mr. and Mrs. Robertson and all the girls to come to Mr. Jackson's, and at the bottom of the note was written, "Be sure and bring Mr. Russell and Priscilla."   Accordingly the girls got ready, when we took seats in the carriage and rode up to Mr. Robertson's. When we got there, we found &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7685-00000044"/> 84      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF another carriage waiting for-the family. Mr. and Mrs. Robertson, his daughters and three nieces, Pris- cilla and myself constituted the party. We drove to, Mr. Jackson's, where we were all invited into the parlor. After Mr. and Mrs. Jackson had shaken hands with us all, Mrs. J. observed, "Mr. and Mrs. Robertson, this is my daughter's birthday, and I have invited you all to have a share in it. You must all make yourselves happy and at home." We sat a little while, and then a waiter was brought around with birthday cake and splendid wine. When Mrs. Robertson took her glass of wine and cake, she said, "Adaline, you are a fine girl, one I always thought a great deal of; to-day you are seventeen years old, I understand, and I hope God Almighty will guide, bless- and protect you safe through this life, and at last take you into his king- dom, for the dear Redeemer's sake, amefi!" At this the girls stood up, and forming a ring, placed Adaline in the centre, one of the number saying, "Now, my dear Adaline, we wish you much joy, and may you see many, many happy years and birthdays, and may you be the partner of a very happy one, and may he love and cherish you as he would his own soul, and may your heavenly Fa- ther bless you and guide you into all truth, for his dear Son's sake, amen, amen ;" and they all respond- ed, "Amen, amen!" Now the girls went to the piano and played and sung about an hour, after which,we were invited into supper. The table was set with every thing that England afforded; indeed, it was one of the most   I           DAVID RUSSELL.       85 I   splendid suppers that I ever eat. After supper was over we were invited into the sitting-room. When Mr. Jackson- came in he said, "Mr. Robertson, it '475 seems that David is determined to leave us." I "Yes," said Mr. Robertson, " it seems so indeed; I have used my best endeavors to persuade him to stay, but I find it impossible to turn him from his country. I know he would do as well here as he would in America, and I feel sorry to have him leave us just as we have got acquainted with him; for I have never seen a young man in my life that I thought as much of as I do of him, on such a short acquaintance." "He is certainly very active and smart for a young man of his age; how did you like his work, he has worked some for you, hasn't he?" "Yes, sir, he has, and I have not a man in my, shop can do a better job of work than he can. I would give him an excellent chance if I could get him to stay, for he will make one of the first me- chanics in all England. And then he has such a good disposition, and so joyful, friendly, and kind to all; indeed, I would give a good deal to have him stop with us."   f "Yes," said Mr. -Jackson, "and so would I. I respect the young man highly, and there are other things he has advanced in besides machinery. I never have seen a young man in my life of his age that understood the ma'sonic order as well as he does. I am an old man; I have belonged to the lodge up- wards of twenty-five years; I have tried, him as high as I can go, and he always answers every thing  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7685-00000045"/> 86      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF that I put to him in a. proper order, then reacts on me and insures me he can go farther, and he says, 'go on, go on, and follow up the order, for I am ready to answer any order that you can put to me ;' and so he leaves me completely empty of all my signs and wonders, and he is full ready to answer any thing!" ' Yes, Mr., Jackson, I know he is far advanced in masonry from what I have seen of him; that is one reason I want him to stay, for he would be an honor to our lodge." ' Yes," said Mr. Jackson, " not only an honor to our lodge, but to all the lodges in England; and to any country he goes to, it matters-not where, he will find friends. For my own part, I would give a good deal -to have him stay with us. I knew by his looks the very day he landed here in the stage, that he was an uncommon smart'man, and I soon found out, to my surprise, things that I never thought were in him--and he is so quick and apt in all his ways. Now, my young ladies, myself and Mr. Robertson have made our best endeavors to persuade David to stay with us, and it seems we can't prevail on him to stay; now, I want you to try your skill, all of you, and see if you can have any more influence over him than we have." Maria Robertson remarked, "We will not let him go; and I know he is too gallant a young man to leave such a set of fine young ladies as we are!" "Yes," said Priscilla, "when we come to talk with him, I believe he will stay." At this time the carriages were ready to take us   DAVID RUSSELL.       87 home. After we bid them all good-night, we got in the carriage and drove up to Mr. Robertson's. After !  a short time we retired to the room for prayer, and Mr. Robertson offered a most impressive petition. We sat a little while and then retired to bed. Early next morning I said to Priscilla, while they were getting breakfast, "I want to have a private in- terview," We then went into the small back parlor and sat down. "Now, Priscilla, my dear," I com- menced, "I don't wish to keep any thing from you. I love you as I love my own soul; but I am now to tell you, that I have -to go this day and take my passage for America. Priscilla, if you think proper to go, I will have one of the best berths in the cabin for you; you know that I can get any thing from captain Price. I have already told you what I would do in respect to my uncle; I never told you I was worth a cent of money, you know, and never should have mentioned it had not the captain told you. I now tell you I have got plenty; but still, all I have got is nothing if I can't have my Priscilla with me. I will do all I promised, so if you will go I will have the berth engaged and a servant girl for you. Now, Priscilla, make up your mind as quick as you possi- bly can-, and give me an answer; I will go down to the ship and find out exactly when she is going to leave, and I will invite Mr. Robertson's two youngest daughters to go with me, as they were never aboard an American ship. Maria will be here to keep you company, and I want you to give me an answer when I come back, as I shall take a berth for you." By this time the hack had come, and my friend  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7685-00000046"/> 88 .     AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF Patrick was there again. I said to him, "Gooc morning, Patrick!" "Good morning, sir; how is yer honor this morn ing?"  "I am well, Patrick, thank God, and how are you." "Sir, never better! Why, sir, every time I see you you look better, sir; is all the Americans looking a fair as you do?" said Patrick. "' The Americans, in general, are good lookini men and women..  Now, Patrick, I want you t drive us to the ' Lady Jane' as quick as you can!" He then drove off, and in a short time we arrive at the wharf. "Now, Patrick," said I, " how long will it talk you to get ready to go back, for I want to go back a quick as I see the captain?" "' Well, sir, I can feed in half an hour." "Can I depend on you to have your horses and ca: riage here in one hour from now .?" "Yes, yer honor, I will have them here, you ma depend upon it!" "Well, Patrick, I will- give you this shilling, bi be sure and don't get tipsy!" I then took the young ladies and walked up th gangway to the quarter-deck. We sat down c the same seat I occupied before with my fema friends. At this time the ship had several flap hoisted at her peak; she had her ensigns forward c her bowsprit, and her American jack was hoisted; 4 the main she had the company's flag; at the for mast head she had her Blue Peter, that is a sign   I .      DAVID RUSSELL.       89 for sea, and at the mizzen-mast head she had a white flag with a red cross on it and a red border. The girls remarked, "What a beautiful ship, and what beautiful colors those are!" "Well, my dear girls, you see those beautiful colors; I suppose you have read how those colors as were gained?" "Yes, Mr. Russell, we have read the history of America; but I don't know as we can recite one word!" said one of the girlS. "That flag, my dear girls, was gained by the life and blood of free men that are called true Amer- icans; they were true, indeed, and when you look on me you see the son of one of those true men, one that was considered one of the main pillars of that flag!" At this time the-captain came on board the ship. I said, "Good morning, captain!"  He replied, "Good morning, David, this is a beautiful morning!" "Captain, it is indeed, sir!" then introduced the two young ladies, as -being the sisters of one that was there before. He then- l shook hands with them   and said,' Ladies, I am happy to see you aboard my ship!" He now invited us down into the cabin, when I addressed the cap- tain thus: "I have come, now, captain, to know how soon you will leave this port?" "Well, David, I have been looking for you every day; I shall leave this port in ten days, please God, if nothing happens, and I want you now to select your berth." The captain and myself went around, and I picked  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7685-00000047"/> 90      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF out my berth. I also told -the captain that I ex- pected the young lady, Priscilla, would go with me, and she would have a servant girl with her. "Well," said the captain, " there is a double berth that will just suit." I then engaged the berth, and we returned back to the cabin. The captain rung the bell and-ordered refreshments; soon after that we were invited into the dining-room, where we had a splendid dinner. We drank very freely of wine,-and all felt well. After dinner we all went back to the cabin, when the captain said,- "Ladies, I think as much of this young man as I do of my own son. I was acquainted with him when he was a baby, and lay in his mother's arms, and, ladies, I tell you I never knew a better young man in my life. I was acquainted with his father and also with his uncles; they were all true Americans, and fine, clever, good-hearted men. Hewas a friend to the poor, the fatherless, and the widow, in fact, a friend to all that knew him, and above all, a friend to the freedom and liberty of America. They fought, and suffered, and bled to gain that flag that you see flying at my peak; in fact, David's father was one of the main pillars of that flag, and I never can look at it without thinking of him. I feel happy indeed to have David go back with me, for he is a jovial man, and good company." At this time the Irishman came on board and in- quired for the American gentleman. "Well," said I, "Patrick, you have got back?" "Yes, yer honor, I have got back in time."   DAVID RUSSELL.       91 I told him we would be ready to go in a few min- utes. I went down again to see the captain, and he ![i advised me to be aboard in about eight days, as it would be better to be on board a day or two before sailing. We then shook hands with the captain, and got into the carriage. "Now, Patrick," said I, " you must mind and not upset us into the-mud." "Yer honor, I never upset a carriage in my life." I told Patrick to drive us back to Mr. Robertson's, and in a short time we were landed before the door. I gave Patrick an English sixpence, when he said,- "I don't find no such English gentlemen; they only give me a few half-pence.?' Patrick, if I give anybody any thing, I want to give something of value; so good-night, Patrick." "Good-night, yer honor." I went into the house, where I found Mr. and Mrs. Robertson and the girls waiting for me. Mr. Rob- ertson said, "Now, Catherine, I want you to tell me all you saw aboard the ship." '4 Well, papa, I will tell you. Every thing I saw was splendid; the cabin was decorated in an elegant manner, and every thing was arranged in the very best manner. The ship is neatly painted and looks beautiful; she has a great many different colors, and the captain appears to be a very clever man. He said he thinks as much of Mr. Russell as if he was his own son.  He was acquainted with him when he was an infant, in his mother's arms, and  also, was acquainted with all his folks. He speaks very  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7685-00000048"/> 92      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF highly of them all, particularly David's father, and.. he says he was one of the main pillars of indepen- dence, for he labored day and night for the freedom of America, in studying and getting up books and papers, and making lectures. And, papa, we had a most splendid dinner; every thing was of the very best. We had several kinds of wine, and certainly we had the best of attention. The captain says that David must be on board in eight days." Mr. Robertson said, "Well, girls, you must make the most of David while you have got him." Matilda then said, "Papa, I never enjoyed myself better in my life. I have been in a great deal of company, but I never saw a dinner got up as splen- did in my life, and I don't know as I ever ate so hearty a dinner, for I was hungry, and every thing was so good. If they live that way all the time, I should like to go to America, too, with David." After this they read a chapter and went to prayer. Mr. Robertson made a glorious prayer, after which we all went to bed. Early the next morning when I came down stairs, the first person I saw was Priscilla. "Good morning, my dear," I exclaimed. She replied, sadly, "Who will be your dear when you get to the other side of the ocean-to Amer- ica?" "Why, Priscilla will, for I shall have her with me, I hope." We then went into the parlor and sat down. "Now, Priscilla," said I, "I have made every arrangement that is necessary. I have taken a beau- tiful double berth for you and your female servant,   I DAVID RUSSELL.             93 and I have a young lady about your age, that is willing to go. Now, Priscilla, it is only for you to say whether you will go or not. I will do every thing that I have agreed, and pledge my word and honor I will do it; and I will send you back or come back with you, any time you are not satisfied in America. So, Priscilla, that is all that I can do; it is all left with yourself. You know I must go; you heard what the captain said, and you know that I have not deceived you, so I want you to make up your mind." She went immediately to see her mother, and she plead with her a long time to let her go, assuring her mother that she would come back again in a short time. She told her mother she would leave her money in the bank, just as it was. But all she could do, she could not prevail on her mother to let her go. Her mother said,- "Priscilla, do you want to break my heart? You are all the comfort I have got in this world, and if I lose you I am done. As you are so much attached to the young man,-and I believe him to be a very honorable young man, from the short acquaintance I have had with him,-if he will stay in England, he might pay his addresses to you, and in a short time he may marry you, if you think proper, providing he will agree to live with me, and at my death you shall have all I have got." The old lady ordered the carriage to be brought up, and sent her daughter for m3 at Mr. Robertson's. I had just come down from my room, and was dressed up to go and spend the eyening at Mr. Jack- *                  I st  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7685-00000049"/> "-     AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF son's, when Priscilla told me that her mother had sent for me, and she wanted to see me. We then  got into the carriage and went to her mother's house. When we arrived there, we found the old lady sit- ting in the small back parlor, by herself. She said to me,- "-Young man, how do you do, this evening?"  I told her I was very well, and hoped she was the i same.                !- She replied,-"We old people are hardly ever well. But now, young man, I have something to say to you. It seems that Priscilla is wonderfully attached to you." "Not more than I am to her, ma'am. She can't be more attached to me than I am to her. I have never seen a young lady that I thought I could end my days with, but Priscilla, Mrs. Russell. You know we look a good deal alike in features; but not more in features than we are in principles. You know her principles, and you then know mine, for we are exactly alike."  "Well, now, young man, I will tell you what I have to say to you: I have always liked your appear- ance, from the very first time I saw you. I have i? every confidence in you,.that you would do right by my daughter. She is the only child I have got to comfort me in my old age. So now, young man, if  you are a mind to stay in England, and pay your addresses to my daughter, I am perfectly willing,  and if you will agree to one thing you might be mar- ried in a short time after. That is that you will live    -DAVID RUSSELL.       95 with me till I die, and you shall have all I have got."  "That is the thing I would do with all my heart, was I not in the situation I am. I have a property in America, and I must go and attend to it. That is the very thing that takes me to America." "Well, well," said the old lady, " you can go and come back again." "Yes, ma'am, I calculate to come back, if I don't get Priscilla, and if I get her, I will come back if she wants to; but, Mrs. Russell, I have only a few days to stay." "Well, then, you cafl stay here and be with her." I stayed a day or two, and Priscilla and myself went around in the carriage, making visits to her folks, and to bid farewell to all my friends. While I was staying here, I received a letter from Mr. Jack- son, which read thus:- "Mr. Russell, dear sir, I would wish you to let me know the day you are going to start aboard your vessel, as there are a number of your best friends who wish to escort you to the vessel." I sent word back that I should go aboard on Thursday morning, and I would be at his house at ten o'clock on that day, with my carriage. At length Thursday arrived, and I went, accom- panied by Priscilla, in the carriage to Mr. Jackson's. After we arrived, we were invited into the sitting- room. In a short time the carriages arrived with the escort, and they were all invited into the sitting- room, also. Mr. Jackson then ordered refreshments brought in. After this was over, they all got in  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7685-00000050"/> 96      AUTOBIOGRAPHY O F their carriages and escorted me fdown to the ship. They were all invited aboard, and I introduced them to the captain as my friends, with whom I had formed an, acquaintance in London. iThe captain invited them all into the cabin, where they were soon seated. The captain took his seat in the after part of the cabin, in his arm-chair, and said, "Gentlemen and ladies, I feel highly honored this day to have such a respectable company aboard my ship; and more- over, I feel highly honored to think my friend David has formed such respectable acquaintances in so short a time." Mr. Brown said to the captain, "Are you acquaint- ed with this young man?" "Yes, sir," replied the'captain, "I am acquainted with him and all his folks." "Well, lie appears to be an uncommon smart man." "' Yes, sir, I/know he is a smart young man, and I doubt if all England ever produced a smarter man than his father!" "Can you relate any thing concerning his fa- ther?" asked Mr. Brown. I will give you a short sketch of him, for I have not time to tell you one quarter what I know of him. He was a man, gentlemen and ladies, capable of fulfilling any office in the English or American gov- ernments; hle filled many respectable offices in the English government, and also in the American gov- ernment. And this boy you see standing here, is the very image of his father, in looks and in principles.9 The captain here gave several masonic signs, which   were understood and answered by several gentlemen present. He then continued, "A greater mason than John H. Russell never lived; and, gentlemen, as to this David here, as young a man as he looks, there are very few can go ahead of him!" "I am aware of that, captain," replied Mr. Jack- son, "I have been a mason twenty-five years, captain, and I don't begin to know the order of masonry as. David does." "Yes," said Mr. Robertson, " he is far advanced in masonry, for we have all tried him." "Yes," said the captain, " and I have tried him; I can- go as high as the prime order, and he can go a long way ahead of that. Well, gentlemen, David's father was the greatest mason in all America, and I doubt if there are any in England could beat him. He had filled every office of every order in the lodge; he was high-priest of the highest order' and master of arts of all the orders of masonry, and he wore the igllest badges of honor in masonry on his sash and girdle, ahd on his apron, breast-plate and shield. When he died he was buried with military and ma- sonic honors, and a greater funeral than that of John H. Russell is not often seen. The bier was drawn by four pure white horses, which were dressed in wreaths of roses, red and white, all tinged with black crape. On top of the hearse were four large pillars, and those pillars were decorated highly in the masonic order; on the top of those pillars projected a canopy, with all the implements of the masonic order on them. Attached to the front canopy were the badges of honor that he had gained, and on top of this was 5&#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7685-00000051"/> 98       AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF 'the badge of the office that he fulfilled when he died. On top of his coffin lay his sword, shield, breast-plate and regimentals. There were men from all parts of the United States, and a band of music to every di- vision; the military fired volleys over his grave ill honor to him. It was the greatest funeral I ever saw, or ever expect to see. There, gentlemen, I have given you a description of David's father and of his burial, which is all true, on the word and honor of Thomas Price, captain of the Lady Jane." When the captain had concluded, the bell rung for dinner. After the ladies were seated around the table, the gentlemen took their seats; captain Price sat, at one end of the table and Mr. Jackson at the other. Mr. Brown stood up and said,-' Gentlemen and ladies, I feel thankful, indeed, that I am one of the guests on this interesting occasion. As we have all met together socially and friendly, to take a last farewell dinner, it behooves us to ask and implore a blessing on those that are about to leave our coun- try, and to cross the ocean for America. Almighty God, our heavenly Father, we do implore thee at this time to look down on each and every one in thy di- vine presence, particularly on the- captain of this ship, our brother. Also, we do implore thee to look down on our young friend and brother. Also, we pray thee, heavenly Father, to guide and protect this ship safe into the portJfor which it is bound, with all that may be on board. Also, we give thanks unto thee, our heavenly Father, for all those earthly blessings thou art bestowing on us daily and hourly. Almighty and most merciful Father, we do look up   DAVID RUSSELL.        99 to thee at this time, not only to give us those earthly, blessings that fade away and die, but to give us thy heavenly blessings that never die. All those bless- ings we ask, not because we are worthy, but because thouen assurest us in thy word, whatever we ask in faith we shall receive; and finally, bring us'one and all into thy kingdom, for our dear Reedeemer's sake, amen![' All then sat down to dinner, and it was a splendid affair; there was nothing lacking. Mr. Jackson remarked, "I keep a very large hotel, as you all know, and I am in the habit of serving up dinners for very large parties; but I never served up a better dinner than this in my life, and I never saw a better dinner." The first cloth was taken off and the second put on, then the table was filled with wines of different kinds; fruit of every kind was'put on in large glass stands; then there was another set of stands, filled up with nuts; and there was another set of stands filled with jellies of all kinds, and there were glass dishes filled with tarts of every kind, and plates of several kinds of clheese; besides, ice creams of different kinds, and a great many other things too numerous to mention. After dinner was over we retired to the cabin, when Mr. Jackson remarked, "I should like' to have you, captain, come up and see me if you could before you go to America. I keep the ' Wheat Sheaf. " The captain said he feared he would not have time. Mr. Jackson continued, "We are going to have a  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7685-00000052"/> 100      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF large masonic party there on Saturday, and I should like to llave you, captain, and David come." The captain said he could not promise, for he had a great deal to do, and must leave by the middle of next week. They all shook hands as -we parted, and I took Priscilla aside and told her I would be at her mother's house early tomorrow morning. She said, ' Now, my dear David, don't you fail in coming, for I have a great deal to say to you." I assured her I would be there to take breakfast with her. We then shook hands, and the tears fell on my hand as we parted. Next morning, about seven o'clock, I was at her house. I told the captain I might not be back that night, and if he went to Mr. Jackson's, to drop a note to Mrs. Russell and let me know. After I arrived at Mrs. Russell's we took breakfast; after which, Priscilla invited me into her own sitting- f room. She said to me, 1' Mr. Russell, the more I see and hear of you, the more I like you. It seems that you are an uncommon lucky young man, and from what I heard the captain tell about your father, it makes me almost sav I will go with you." She then told me she was of age, and her own mistress. "Then, Priscilla," said I, " if that is the case, I will take you, for no one has any claim on you. So, now, I want you to make up your mind for certain that you will go." She then went to her mother and told her she was going to America with Mr. Russell, for she was of age.- At- this her mother fell into hysteric fits, and had several, one after another. The physician was   DAVID RUSSELL.       101 sent for and he immediately came. I asked him if there was any danger? and he said there was not. I asked him if she would have any more? he said she would. He ordered the hartshorn bottle to be kept to her nose, and her temples to be bathed in cold water. Priscilla took the hartshorn bottle, and the servant-girl bathed her temples. At length she fell asleep, and Priscilla left the girl to take- care of her. We retired to a private room, when I said, "Pris- cilla, I see there is no chance for you to go, unless you rush right away and lose every thing--all your property--it won't do to lose every thing to go to America. I will be in England in the course of three years, and we will keep up a correspondence all the time; I think that will be the best plan.- So we will consider that to be our plan, for we can do no better." At this time there was a carriage drove up to the door-; the servant-girl went out and the occupant of the carriage inquired if there was a young man there named Russell, from   North America? She  said there was. He handed her a note and told her to give it to him. She brought it in and gave it to me. It read thus: "Mr. Russell, I have come to Mr. Jackson's hotel, and I want you to come immediately." I asked Priscilla if she would go, and she said she would.   I told her to prepare herself, as I expected there would be a ball in the evening. After a short absence she re-appeared, dressed splendidly; we then got in the carriage iand departed.  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7685-00000053"/> 102      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF As we drove up to the steps, Mr. Jackson and the captain met us, and invited us in. The captain shook hands with Priscilla, and said he was happy to see her, and Mr. Jackson invited us into the isit- ting-room. In a short time we were served with re- freshments. There was a large number of people there; navy officers and army officers, members of the masonic lodge, and a great many ladies. There were several remarks made concerning the embargo on the -American shipping. One of those navy offi- cers asked Mr. Jackson if he had taken notice of the late papers. Mr. Jackson said he had. -"What do you think of this embargo the English are going to lay on the American vessels?" "I think, sir, it will all blow over; I doi't think it will be done ; to tell you the truth, I don't think there will be any war. When England goes to war, she goes to make something, but with America she would lose, even to lay an embargo on the shipping. You must consider America has the privilege to do the same with the English shipping, and they would do it to a great extent. They would have the seas lined with frigates and sloops-of-war, and privateers, and take our merchant ships; every ship we sent out." Supper being now ready, we were all invited in to a splendid repast; every thing was in the very best order. After supper was over we were invited into a splendid ball-room, where there was a beautiful band of music. The ball was opened by forming and dancing a double cotillon, and was kept up to nearly twelve o'clock. After that we all retired to the sit- ting-room, when Mr. Jackson' remarked, "Well,   DAVID RUSSELL.       103 David, my boy, do they all dance in America like you?" "No, Mr. Jackson, I never saw two men dance alike in my life, and you did not see two of this party dance alike.' A gentleman called captain Parker, spoke up,- "No," said he, "you are perfectly right, for there never were two men who danced alike." "Well," said Mr. Jackson, "I must say, Mr. Rus- sell, you are a splendid dancer; the best I ever saw in all my life." After some time spent in conversation, the com- pany prepared to retire. I then informed Captain Price that I should accompany Priscilla home, and I would be on board ship in the morning. The com- pany separated for their respective homes, while I remained at Mr. Russell's over night. I was up bright and early in the morning. Mrs. Russell asked me if I ever expected to come and see them again. "Yes, ma'am," I said, "I do, indeed, if nothing happens, and it is the Lord's will." "When you come, here is a home for you," re- sponded the old lady. We took breakfast, and then I told Priscilla, "I must go. I don't expect I shall see you under three or four years. I expect the war will be over by that "Well, Mr. Russell, I feel unwilling to let you go. I want to go with you. Please walk into my private room. I want to give you something." She then went to- her bureau, and took out a large gold locket, and handed it to me. It had her  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7685-00000054"/> 104      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF likeness in it. She said, "Mr. Russell, when you look at that, you may think of your dear Pris- cilla." I then took- a locket off my neck, with my own likeness in it, and handed it to her, saying, s Pris- cilla, take this, and keep it as long as you live, in remembrance of your dear David, one who loved you with sincerity, and when you look on it, you can think it came from a true-hearted young mnan." She gave me her address, and I gave her mine. We tenderly embraced each other, then went down stairs. I shook hands with Mr. and Mrs. Russell, and all in the house, remarking, as I did so, "God bless you all, and may he guide you safe into his kingdom at last, for his dear Son's sake. Amen." I then took Priscilla by the hands, and said,- "Priscilla, my dear girl, I am now about to leave you; may the blessing of our heavenly Father be with you, and protect you through this unfriendly world, and when lie has done with you on this earth, may he take you to himself in glory, for the dear Redeemer's sake. Amen." We embraced each other again, took a hearty shake of hanilds, and parted. I made all haste to be aboard my ship. As we had to pass by Mr. Robert- son's, I told the driver to stop there. I went in, and found Mr. and Mrs. Robertson and their three daugh- ters in the sitting-room. I exclaimed, "Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Robertson, I wish you all good-morning, especially the girls." Mr. Robertson said, "Sit down, Mr. Russell, I   DAVID RUSSELL.       I05 want to talk with you a few moments. What did you think of our ball last night?" "I think it was a delightful ball, and splendidly got up." '"Yes," says Mr. Robertson, "I think every thing was in splendid order, and there was splendid danc- ing. I think you played your part very well, David. I must say you are a splendid danceir. I never saw any better." "Yes," said one of the girls, " he is a splendid dancer. When he was dancing that double cotillon, and there were so many on the floor, how he passed up and down, carrying his partner with such an air, and never made a mistake." "Now, Mr. Russell, I suppose you are about to leave us," said Mr. Robertsol. "Yes, sir, thought I would call and bid you good-bye.' "Well, I am heartily sorry to have you leave us; it seems just as we have got a little acquainted with you, then you leave us; the more I get acquainted with you, the better I like you, and I have never seen any one in my life that I felt as much for as I do for you, for there is something about you that attracts the attention of every one around you. I suppose there were a great many people at that ball last evening you did not know?" '"Yes, sir, I knew but very few of them." "Well, David, I knew them all. You recollect of dancing the last cotillon?" "Yes, sir, I do. I thought I carried that well." 5\*         &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7685-00000055"/> 106      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF "David, there were more than one hundred people watching you." "Well, Mr. Robertson, did I make any mistake?" "No, David, it was done the best of any thing I ever saw. You hardly touched the floor, and you did it with such an air that more than fifty asked me who that young man was that danced and carried that last cotillon. I told them that he was an American, and from North America. They all re- sponded, ' He is a splendid dancer.' Well, Mr. Rus- sell, I understand you are coming back again, and when you do, you must not forget to call on me." Mrs. Robertson said,--"Myself and daughters are sorry to have you leave us, for we certainly thoughlt you would stay with us a year or two." Maria then said, "Mamma, I wish there was no fighting or war; then. Mr. Russell would stay with ius. It seems that he is so much attached to his country, that he can't stay in England while his fellow citizens are fighting for their freedom and their rights; he must go and help them and have a hand in it. I know if it was not for that, he would stay, for he has an object in England that he thinks more of than any thing in this world." "Yes, Maria, I don't deny that, and I think it's very hard that I can't get it.!' "Well, Mr. Russell, there are but few men that have the chance that 'you have got, but what would take it. Priscilla has a fortune which most men would jump at ; it seems you don't regard money.-'  "No, my dear 1Maria, God forbid that I -should every marry a young lady for money. I am but   DAVID RUSSELL.       107 young, but I have seen too many such marriages in my life. I never knew a couple to do well in my life that married for money. ,When I marry a lady, I marry for pure and untarnished love--that love which knits the hearts closer and closer. Then we will put our hands together and make money, if we hlave none; and in that house, love and prosperity are to be found, that will flourish like the green bay tree, that never fadeth, let what will come upon it. Storms and tempests, trial and difficulties may come upon it, and the howling winds in the months of autumn may come on it, and, in fact, every thing that is under the sun, good, bad or indifferent, may come on it, but it will stand in splendor, beautiful to behold-the same green bay tree.  With hearts full of untarnished love, though troubles, and trials, and adversity, and poverty may come, you will hear the voices lifted up in that happy house, to their heav- enly Father, the giver of all goodness, that he would give them such things as they stand in need of, and that He would bless them in their going out and coming in, and that He would guide and protect them through this unfriendly world. Above all things, give them, that spiritual gift and heavenly comfort that the world can neither give nor take away. Maria, such a couple as abound in love are happy indeed." ("Yes, Mr. Russell, there are few such couples as those to be found, and there are very few men who pay their addresses to young ladies that have money, but what think more of the money than they do of  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7685-00000056"/> 108      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF the lady; and they often work all manner of deceit to get around the young lady." "Well, Maria, if that be the case, I would play a game on those young men, so that I would easily find out their hearts." "And how would you do it?" "When they were telling me those great love stories of deceit and deception, I would say,' Sir, how do you expect to support me? Have you any money or property? for I have got nothing, and if you would marry me, you will have to support me.' The man, finding she has got nothing, and that he has been loving an object she has not got, and that he has lost the object of his love, will very soon leave the lady, and by his leaving the lady, it will be happy indeed, for her, for she saves her money and herself, and gets rid of a false heart and a deceitful lover, which will be a great blessing for her." "Mr. Russell, I want you to tell me that again, and I will write it down," said Maria. I then repeated-my advice, and she wrote it down, greatly admiring the project I had suggested. Friends then presented me with gifts, to remember them, and I also gave each of them a gift to remem- ber me. Mr. Robertson said, "Mr. Russell, if ever you come to England, be sure and come here. You shall have a home here as long as you have a mind to stay." I then shook hands with them, bidding them all good-bye. I ordered the driver to take me to the "Wheat Sheaf" inn, where we soon arrived. Mr.   DAVID- RUSSELL.      109 Jackson met me at the door, saying,-"I am happy to see you, Mr. Russell. I feared I should not see you any more." I gave the driver time to feed his horses, telling him to hurry up, as I wanted to go to the ship Lady Jane shortly. Mr. Jackson invited me into the sit- ting-room, where, with his family, we were, soon seated. "Well, Mr. Russell, how did you like the ball?" inquired friend Jackson. I replied that I thought it was a splendid affair, and got up in good style, and that no one could find any fault with it. Well, Mr. Russell, I had no idea that you was such a good dancer. I never have seen a better one in my life." "Yes," said one of the girls, "he is a splendid dancer; there is no mistake." "Yes," said his oldest daughter, "I rather envied Priscilla; having such a good partner to help her through on her part. Really, we are all sorry to have Mr. Russell leave us." "Yes," said Mr. Jackson, " it is a bad job for us,  for just as we have got acquainted with him, he is going to leave us." By this time the dinner bell rung, and we all went into the dining-room, and sat down to a splendid dinner. After dinner was over, we returned to the sitting-room again, when Mr. Jackson thus addressed me:--- "I may never see you any more, Mr. Russell, and I have a few words to say to you.

Last night we had some of the best mechanics here that we have in London, and they say that you will make the best mechanic in all England. Mr. Rus- sell, I want you, when you come back again to Eng- land, to call at my house and make it your home; for in you is perfect happiness for all around you. By your conversation concerning different parts of the earth that you have traveled iln and read about, and your beautiful singing, and your joyful disposi- tion, you make all lively around you." They each presented me gifts, and I also gave them keepsakes. "Now, Mr. Russell, we are all going down with you X  The carriage was ordered up immediately, and we all got in and drove off. We reached the ship with- out the occurrence of any special incident, and went aboard. The men were all busy taking in the last part of the cargo; and she was loaded very deep in the water. We were all invited into the cabin. Mr. Jackson said,- 'Captain, you have a splendid ship,  indeed." "Yes," replied the captain, " she is as good a sea- craft, and as fast a sailing vessel as sails on the water." "Well, captain, you must take good care of my friend David."   ,DAVID RUSSELL.      " That you may depend on, Mr. Jackson." Captain," said Mr. Jackson, "I never knew any young man to have so many friends as David, in such a short time." Why," replied the captain, "it has always been so; wherever hle went he found friends and acquaint- ances in a short time. His father was just like him; even the wild Indians of the forest were all friends to his father, for he always treated them kindly and fed. them when they were hungry, and they would lay their lives down for him." ' What a blessing it is to see such a person, and what comfort it gives to all around! For my own part, I never enjoyed myself and family better than I have these last two months that I have been ac- quainted with David." "Yes," said the captain, " the longer you are ac- quainted with him the more you will like him. I should like to have him come -hack to my house, and make it his home, Mr. Jackson. My house has been open for David for several years, and is open now for him, and Mrs. Price has tried every means to get him to come. Many others that I know would fain have him come to their homes, but he cannot be persuaded, while he thirsts so much for knowledge, which he knows he cannot get perfect without trav- eling. For a young man, there are but few can go ahead of him, and I tell you, Mr. Jackson, I have no doubt but what he could navigate this ship to Boston as well as I could." "What! does he understand navigation?" "Yes, sir, he does, and there are few can beat him.  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7685-00000058"/> "2      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF Mr. Jackson, I have been on the water forty-five years, and I am getting on fast to seventy, and I have no doubt, to-day, to'take all parts of navigation, but what he can beat me." "Well," said Mr. Jackson, "has he ever been in the navy?" "Yes, sir, he has been an officer in one-of the first frigates in the American navy, and I expect would have been still in the navy, had it not been for his uncle. Captain Bell begged and prayed his uncle not to take him out of the navy, but to let him remain, telling him that he would make one of the boldest and most valiant officers in the United States service; that he would have command of one of the first frigates in the United States service, before he was thirty years old. He said he had young men on board five or six years, who did not know as much as David." Mrs. Jackson then remarked to her husband,- "Did I not tell you, long ago, that there was more knowledge in that young man than we knew any thing about?" The girls all said,-"Yes, mamma, and we wish we could have kept him with us, for we have learned many things, and might have learned much more if he had staid with us." "Yes; my dear children, I should have been happy to have him stay with us."' Refreshments were now served in the dinner sa- loon, and we were invited in to participate. On our  return again to thie cabin, Mrs. Jackson observed,- "Captain, you have every thing so nice here on   ,     .

"You would find a very fine country there." "Since David has been here," said she, " he has put many a one in the notion of America., for he has enlightened our minds wonderfully about that coun- try." After some more general conversation, the car- riages of our guests arrived. The parting shake of the hand was given, the captain was thanked for his generous hospitality; wishes for mutual happiness and prosperity were exchanged; blessings were in- voked, and the quick rumbling of carriage wheels awakened me to a sense of loneliness; which feeling I soon dispelled by contemplating the stirring and exciting scenes which, for aught I knew, still lay in my pathway of duty.  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7685-00000059"/> "4       AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF CHAPTER      III.

THE day following the parting scene described in the previous chapter, we were ready for sea. We sailed down the river Thames, passed Greenwich,Woolwich, and Gravesend, and at length reached the English Channel. We thlen laid our course for Boston, my native land, and with a fair wind. All our canvass was spread alow and aloft, and we run many days at the rate of fifteen kndts an hour. Passing by the Ram's Head Light, we cleared the rocks of Scilly, and soon bid farewell to the white and yellow cliffs of England. We had a pleasant passage and a fair wind, and arrived in Boston in the latter part of the fourth week. After landing in Boston, I went to see my friends, who were all glad to see me. I also went to see the captain's folks, where I enjoyed a pleasant visit. I   DAVID RUSSELL.       115 afterwards went to Tennessee to visit my uncle Wil liam, where I staid a short time and then came back again to Boston. When I got back again to Boston, I found, to my astonishment, that England had de- clared war against America, and laid an embargo on all American shipping. This was in 1812. Now, Boston was all alive, fitting up privateers, building shipping and fitting up all kinds of vessels of war. At this time I saw an advertisement from the state of New York, of a very large land sale soon to take place in Erie, Cattaraugus and Genessee counties. My two cousins, Thomas and John, and myself, thought we would go and make a purchase of some of it. We then got ready, and in a few days left for Buffalo. We went as far as a small town, about thirty miles from Buffalo, where we made a stop for a few days. We had not been there long be- fore the news reached us that the British had already landed and burned several towns, and were then bombarding Buffalo, throwing shot and shell from fort Erie. I said to my cousins and a number of others who were at the hotel where we were stopping, "Let each of us hire a horse and get our rifles and to Buffalo, and give them a few shots, and not let them have all the fun l4hemselves; we will give them a scouring, as we are all true Americans." I said to my cousins, Thomas and John, "Comne along with me, as there is no time to be lost!" I went immediately to a livery stable and hired three horses, and had them equipped; I bought three rifles and ammunition, buckshot, ball and powder. I  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7685-00000060"/> "6      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF then said, "Boys, follow me, for I want to reach Buffalo in about three hours!" I then put spurs to my horse and put off, and they followed me. We reached Buffalo in about three and a half hours. We put up at the Eagle tavern, and I soon found out that the British were about landing at Sandytown. Our tavern keeper's name was Benjamin Rathburn. I said, "Benjamin, I want you to have those horses well rubbed down, cleaned and fed, and we want something to eat, as we shall stay witlI you to-night." We then took supper and something to drink, and went to bed, for we were tired, riding so fast. The next morning we were up at four o'clock, it being my usual time of rising. I aroused the whole house up, and said, "Don't you see the town on fire! and why ain't you up and at them!" The British at this time had set fire to the whole town except one house, which was the widow St. John's. She went to the commander and fell down on her knees and implored him to save her house, for she was a widow woman, and had four children. He immediately placed a guard over her house, and that was the only house that was saved in all Buffalo. The army staid there a few days and thlen went back to Fort Erie. Myself and cousins went back to Cold Springs, where we staid a few days at the large hotel. One morning I got uip early, and found every part of the house crowded with young men. I asked the landlord if he would allow me to give a short lecture in one of his rooms? He said "Young man, by your appearance you   DAVID RUSSELL.       117 look like a man of knowledge and good understand- ing, and I am willing to let you have a room to lecture in; but I think it would be better for you to make an appointment about ten o'clock to-day, and I will send around and give out the notice and let everybody know. Accordingly the room was fitted up with seats and a stand, and the people commenced coming in about nine o'clock. At ten o'clock I went into the room and it was crowded. After sitting a short time behind the desk, I arose to address the audience, I pulled out my watch and said: "Fellow-citizens, it is now a quarter past ten o'clock, and the time is past that was appointed for the lecture. As I am the young man that is to give the lecture, I want every one that is within the sound of my voice to-day, to take particular notice of what I say, and weigh it deeply in his mind; for what I am about to tell you is the truth! "Now, my friends andfellow-citizens, I am a native of Boston ; I was born and raised in Boston. I am the son of a revolutionary soldier, one that fought, bled and spent his life in the cause of freedom, and, in gaining our independence. I arrived here yester- day from Boston, myself and two cousins, with the intention of attending the land sales, which you all know were about to commence. I went on to Buffa- lo; while I was there Buffalo was burnt down, and all the towns along the Niagara river and the lake shore, that the British could get at, were burned down.

Do you think they would sit down by their fires and see the tyrants invade it and burn it down, as we do?  No, my friends and fellow-citizens; every man would fly to his fire-lock and rifle, his sword and pistol, and his equipments of war, and fly to the field to face the tyrant enemy and stop his career! Now, my noble young men, let me exhort you, at this time, in the name of those patriots who gained our independence, and in behalf of our country and the honor of our flag, not to stay one minute, but get your rifle, your musket, your sword and- pistol and full equipments, and fly to the field in defence of your country, and fight those haughty rebels and defeat them, and thus stop their career. Now, my fellow-citizens, I am going tomorrow to volunteer, in the service of my country, and I hope I shall have many hundreds and thousands of true Americans to join me! All that are of the same mind as I am for volunteering into the service, I want you to stand up!"And they all stood up to a man; and' the house was crowded. There was a gentleman present who wrote the whole lecture down, in short hand, as I spoke it. He came to me and handed me the writing before I left the desk, and he said, "Sir, I have got all your lec- 'ture, but your name I have not got." I wrote my name, "David Russell, the young and true Amer- ican." He had the lecture printed and sent all over the country, and it was the means of raising fifteen companies; some infantry, some artillery, and some   &#xD;<pb n="Illustration-119" xml:id="VAC7685-00000062"/>  DAVID RUSSELL.       119 horse companies. TThey gave me cheers upon cheers, and if I could have drunk' a barrel of wine, I could have had it. The next day, myself and two cousins went to Buf- falo, and I fell in with captain Chapiu. I said to him, "Captain, are you raising a company?" He said, "Yes, David, I am raising a light cavalry company." "What are your plans?"I inquired.      4 "My plan is,- that every mall find his horse and equip himself, and to be paid afterwards by the gov- ernment. He finds his horse, saddle and bridle, holsters, sword and brace of -pistols, carbine and regimentals, and every thing he needs." The company was all raised and equipped in about ten days, and myself and two cousins volunteered into it. Our regimentals were of the finest navy blue, the finest cloth in America, trimmed with gold tinged lace, and a yellow stripe down our pantaloons; all wpre epaulettes, a high cap, and a large red feather; the officers wore heavier epaulettes than the privates. Our mounted equipments were a sword, a brace of pistols, and a carbine. Our company, with about fifteen or twenty others, of different kinds, was ordered to Canada, under the command of General Brown. We went to Stony Creek, in Upper Canada, and -there the British at- tacked us. They were too many for us, and we had to retreat to the Twenty Mile Creek, and there we built redoubts and reinforced our army. Soon the British advanced on our redoubt.- We .had taken Ball Mill, on the Twenty Mile Creek; this mill was  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7685-00000063"/> 120      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF a large flouring mill, four stories high, and it made us excellent barracks. We expected the British to attack us every hour. At length they advanced on our right division; they attacked us with their artil- lery and a heavy charge. Advancing our left divi- sion, we came upon them with a heavy charge, broke their lines and flanked them, and thus got them be- tween the left and right divisions. We took twelve pieces of artillery. Part of the British army retreat- ed with a portion of the commissary stores, but we took a vast amount of ammunition and baggage wagons, and a great many prisoners. We pursued them so closely that they hid their money in caves and wells. Our army remained at the Twenty Mile Creek for some time, and while we were laying there, we had scouting parties out. My two cousins and myself were in the cavalry scouting party. There was a ta/eriy-bliout three miles from our barracks, on the Twenty'Mile Creek, and on the main road to Hamilton; it was kept by the widow Snyder, who had one son and one daughter. Myself and two cousins went there several times, so that I got well acquainted with the old lady and the family. One day when my two cousins and myself went there, Mrs. Snyder addressed me,-"Mr. Russell, I believe that is your name?" "Yes, ma'am, that is my name; but you must call me David." "Well, David, I want you to come into the room; I want to have some talk with you;." We then went into the sitting-room, where her daughter Catharine was engaged at her workstand.   DAVID RUSSELL.-       121 I- addressed-her, and said,--' Catharine, how do you do, my dear?" She lreplied,--"I am pretty well, and how do you do, David?" "I feel pretty well, but I feel very lonesome some- times." "And what makes you feel lonesome, David?" "Well, Catharine," I replied, "I will tell you; it is because I can't get a wife."  "Why, Mr. Russell, you could get one very easy, if you wanted one." "No, Catharine, you Canadian girls don't like the American soldiers." "Yes, we do, but you Americans don't like- the Canadian girls." Then the old lady commenced,-"Now, Mr. Rus- sell, I am going to tell you something; you are as fine a looking young man as I ever saw in all my life, and every one that sees you takes notice of you. I had some British officers here a few days ago, and they observed what a bold and fine-looking young man you was, and what a pity that- such a fine-look- ing young man should belong to such a beggarly army and nation. Now this I tell you, because I am a friend to. you; you have been to my hpuse several times, and spent a great deal of money in' it, and I am wonderfully attached to you. You are a noble, free-hearted young man; I know by the way you treat your brother officers. Now, Mr. Russell, H want to give you a mother's advice, as you are a young man. Let me beg and plead with you, for I do love you, to leave the 'army immediately, and not 6  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7685-00000064"/> 122      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF set yourself up as a target, to be shot at any longer. for it is a pity that such a fine-looking young man as you should be set up to be shot at; and my advice to you is to leave the army immediately." "Well, Mrs. Snyder, where will I go, if I leave the army?" "' Why," she said, "go where you have a mind to. You have as good a right to go where you please as any body; and I am sure you can't go any where while you are in the service, for you have to be with your regiment. If you don't want to go to your own country, you can come here; I have five hundred acres of land, and plenty of money, and every thing to make you comfortable, and if you want a good wife, you can have one."  "Mrs. Snyd6r, it would not do for me to leave the army, for it would be a stain on the Russell family forever Mrs. Snyder, my father was one of the main pillars in gaining the independence of America, and I should be very sorry indeed to dishonor the name." "Mr. Russell, what do they care about you or the name, after you are dead. Your name will die with you, and you will be very little thought of, let you be ever so great a man. My advice to you is to save your life, and by saving your life, you will save your name." ( Well, Mrs. Snyder, I will have to leave you now; for I have no time to stop any longer, but I will be here tomorrow, for I have a great deal to say to you; but I do sincerely thank you for your good advice, for certainly it is good, and no one could give better.   DAVID RUSSELL.       123 I have a few words to say to Catharine, if you will allow me, and I want it to be private." By all means, you can, Mr. Russell." Then Catharine aid myself retired into the back parlor, and sat down on the sofa. I said to her,- Now, Catharine, my dear, I want you to tell me the truth; I want you to tell me if there are some kegs of gold hid in your well?" "Mr. Russell, I will tell you the truth. I don't know for certain any thing about it. I understood when the British retreated with their commissary department, they retreated with a vast amount of gold and silver in small kegs, and when the Ameri- can army pursued them so close, that they depos- ited their money in different places. I could not tell you where, but, Mr. Russell, my mamma will tell you all about it."' I then embraced her, and told her to come out to the bar, wh6re I treated my cousins and myself, and then returned to the barracks. The next day we came back again to the old tavern.  I treated the boys, anid told them they would have to wait till I found out what I was going to do. I then went to see Mrs. Snyder, and said,-"Good morning, Mrs. Snyder; who comes oftener than I do to see you?" "Good morning, Mr. Russell, I am happy to see you; indeed, you look as fresh and fair as a rose this morning. In fact, Mr. Russell, you look handsomer -every time I see you, and you put on your regimen- tals so neatly, and that gold chain looks so nice that you look better than any of your company." I then said,-"Mrs. Snyder, I want to say some-  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7685-00000065"/> "124      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF thing to you. You recollect, Mrs. Snyder, when the ! British commissary department retreated, that they , had a great deal of money, and I have understood  1 they hid their money in different places. I have also understood that they hid -some on your, farm or in  your well., Now, Mrs. Snyder, if you will tell me the truth, I will give you this five dollar gold piece." She replied,---'Young man, put up your money, in your pocket; you, are too free-hearted. Indeed, don't you ever attempt to bother, your head about that money. Now, you know the British army is close by--they are only on the other side of the hill, and they are watching thllis well, daily and hourly; the moment any one goes down, they will open fire on him, with their cannon. Now, my advice to you is to have nothing to do with it, for you will only endanger your life. Those kegs were small, covered with copper hoops, from one end to the other." "s Well, Mrs. Snyder, do you know how many kegs there are in the well?" ' I do not know-I could not tell you; but there E are several. But let me beg of you, young man, not to attempt to get them out." "Do you know how many companies. there are back of the hill?" "I do not, but there is more than a regiment-- some artillery, some horse, and some foot." "Do you know who is the officer in command?"  '"It is commanded by Colonel McDonald," she re-' t plied.  ' Do you know any thing about their move- ments?"   DAVID RUSSELL.       125 "Yes, I can tell you some things: there is a rein- forcement expected from Chippewa, and they then calculate to attack your army in the night, and de- feat you, and drive you off the grounds, or take you all prisoners." "Well, Mrs. Synder, is there any thing else you can tell me respecting the war?" "Yes, my dear boy, I can tell you a good deal, but you must never divulge it to any one." "No, Mrs. Snyder, I would suffer my life to be taken before I should reveal one word you tell me." "I believe that, my boy. I am going to tell you that this country will be covered with troops in a short time, for General Drummond is coming from Quebec, with 30,000 regular troops, and he intends to scour the country, and drive the American army out."   , I then treated my two cousins again, and  took something to drink myself. I asked Mrs. Snyder if she would take a glass of wine with me. She said, "Yes, Mr. Russell, I will, but I have got a good deal more to say to you before you leave." She invited me into the sitting-room, and said,-- 'Nowj Mr. Russell, it is not only those 30,000 reg- lars that are coming, but they're raising militia ompanies and volunteers all over this country, and he whole country will be swarming with troops, so hat the American army will have no chance what- ver." We now mounted our horses and rode back to the arracks. That night they sent a company, and got he gold out of the well, and we  learned that the  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7685-00000066"/> 126      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF British troops were all ordered to Chippewa. When I went back, I repeated to General Brown all the old lady told me. Our army was then ordered to Chippewa, and in a few days we limbered up- our baggage wagons-and ar- tillery, and advanced on to Chippewa. I went back to the old lady's to bid her and her daughter farewell. "Now," said I, "Mrs. Snyder, I am come to bid you farewell. I don't expect I shall ever see you any more." "Mr. Russell," she replied, " you will find what I tell you is all true; the army has now come, and they are all reinforcing and advancing to Lundy's Lane." "Well, Mrs. Snyder, I am heartily thankful to you for telling me those things, and I never shall forget you." "'Oh, young m. an," she exclaimed, "I wish I could persuade you to stay with us and quit the army." At, this time we heard the army band playing "' Yankee Doodle," as they were coming through the woods. They had to pass by Mrs. Snyder's hotel; for it lay on the Hamilton road. I still kept talking to Mrs. Snyder, till my company came up. I then shook hands with her and her daughter, and said,- "God bless you, Mrs. Snyder; you see my company is coming up, and I must join them." "Well, my dear young man, may God bless you, and I hope he will protect you throughout this great battle you are about to fight, for it will be a battle that will long be remembered. There will be thou- sands and thousands slain in that battle; but I will   DAVID RUSSELL.       127 pray the Lord that you may be protected and brought safe out." I put my hand in my pocket, and gave her and her daughter each a present, in remembrance of me. I then joined the company and went on. General Brown ordered us to advance with a quick march. We advanced till we came within ten'miles of Chippewa; there we built our redoubts and en- camped. At this time General Brown had ordered a reinforcement from Sackett's Harbor and Fort Ni- agara, and also he sent to the president to have as many men raised as he could, and send them on immediately, and large reinforcements were accord- ingly ordered on to join us. General Brown now sent out -spies to watch the movements of the British army. The British had not yet advanced to Lundy's Lane; they were eln- camped at a place called the Beaver Dam. General Brown, after the reinforcements came up, ordered us to advance. We advanced to the pine woods near Lundy's Lane, and there we pitched our redoubt, and lay waiting for the British to come up. The British advanced to a place called Drummond's Hill, in Lundy's Lane, and there they pitched their re- doubts. General Brown  then ordered his army forward again, and we advanced and pitched our redoubts in Brooks' Field. This was a very large field, bordering on Lundy's Lane and the Queenston road. General Brown gave orders to his men to keep on their equipments day and night, so as to be ready for action at any moment; and each man to'have twenty-  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7685-00000067"/> 128      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF four rounds of ball cartridge in his box. We had not remained there long before the British advanced and attacked us in the night; and it was a bloody battle, indeed. To their' astonishment, instead of finding us asleep in our camp, they found us all equipped and ready for action. They did not take us by surprise, for we knew by their movements the day before what they were going to do. I say it was a bloody battle, indeed, for our light cavalry advanc- ed on them, sword in hand, followed up( by our infantry with a very heavy charge, and we mowed them down like grass. Part of the enemy's force re- treated back to the main body of the army, but we took the most of them prisoners, what were not killed. General Brown gave orders to have the wounded attended to and the dead buried, and be ready to advance at any time at a moment's notice. The wounded were as well cared for as possible, and the dead buried by candle light. Very early in the morning General Brown gave orders to advance to the foot of Drummond's Hill, where he formed his army into divisions and into solid squares; the cavalry were ordered in front, and the infantry was to follow up by a heavy charge with the bayonet. We had several regiments of cavalry, some regulars and some volunteers,; the most of our volunteers were young and courageous men, and they, rushed upon the enemy's line like a man going to a day's work, and cut them down on every side. There were several charges made with great slaugh- ter. General Drummond was rallying his men and   DAVID RUSSELL.       129 cheering them up all the time; and, indeed, they fought courageously. About the fourth charge, I lost my right and left hand man, anid that left me in a very critical situation; but still I fought with all my might, strength and power, to hold my own, till at length I received a severe wound on my right shoulder, which disabled me so much in a short time that I had no power of my sword with that arm. I then took my sword in my left hand and fouglt with - all my might. I saw there was nothing but death stared me in the face,for the very first miss that I should make in my defence, I should lose my head. So I saw there was no other way than for me to resort to some other plan.  At that day, we wore very sharp, peaked-toed boots, and I had a carbine hung by a swivel on my right hip. By good luck and good management, I made out to get my carbine cocked unknown to my antag- onist; it was loaded with two buckshot and a ball, well-rammed home. By this time my'antagonist had reined around on me, and his horse threw his right foot over my horse's neck, which brought ,the rider's head in a line with my carbine, by twisting lit a little on the swivel; he then made a desperate pass at me, saying, "You d-d Yankee, I have been fighting with you a long time, but I will have your life at last!"I said, "Go it, boy; go it!" At this time I got the toe of' my boot in on the trigger, and pressing forward, immediately my carbine went off, and he dropped off his horse. I then took my sword and cut his horse's leg off to get clear of him. By this time I had lost a great deal of blood; it 6*   &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7685-00000068"/> 130      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF was all under my shirt, and I looked like a person i that had been dipped in -a tub of blood. I then dropped back, and luckily I got, out. I was met by l the doctor's orderly, who, seeing me covered with blood, thought I was mortally wounded. I rode   X to the surgeonhs camp, where I was washed and my  wound was dressed.                 Both armies were pretty well cut up by the heavy char:les.- The remnant of the British army fell back to the Beaver Dams, and the, American army fell  j back to Chippewa. Wo had not been long at Chip-  1 pewa before the British reinforced and advanced on us. Our reinforcements were coming up daily, and j a great many had already arrived. The British were advancing fast on us, and General Brown ordered the Chippewa bridge to be cut away, so they could not cross their artillery. At length the British went up the creek, where they crossed and came down on  us with a large army, attacking our redoubts. Gen- g eral Brown ordered his troops to advance and defend the redoubt. We advanced on them and met them with i a heavy charge, and there was a great slaughter, in-  deed; we broke their lines and flanked them, when they surrendered, and we took them all prisoners. There were many other battles fought ;there was the battle of Queenstown Heightswhere General Brock was killed. He was commander-in-chief of the Brit- ish army, and lieutenant-governor of the upper prov- ince of Canada. It was he who issued out the proclamation, that all settlers ,coming into Canada should have two hundred acres of land a-piece. Queenstown battle was a very severe one, the British   DAVID RUSSELL.        131 kept the highest ground of the heights, and the Americans had the lowest grounds. The British came down on them with- a heavy charge and drove them over the heights, and as they went over they caught on the crags of rocks and hung there as on gibbets, till they dropped apart, piece by piece, and fell into the Niagara river. At the battle of Little York, which is now called Toronto, the Americans came up with their fleet in the night, and landed their soldiers. below York; the American commander was General Pike. The American fleet sailed up in front of the town, and opened a tremendous fire on the town, and while they were doing this, General Pike ordered his men to advance with a quick march on the town. He advanced, and in -about three hours after he entered and took the town, immediately hoisting the American standard in different parts of the place. The British still holding the main fort, General Pike took half of his army, leaving the other half to guard the town, and went to take the main fort. After a long fight, with a great loss of men, he en- tered the fort just as the British, seeing they could not hold the fort, blew it up. General Pike was killed and most of his men, with all the British that remained in the fort. After the fleet had ransacked the town, and taken all the valuable articles of pub- lic property they could find, and put aboard their ships, they got all their men on board and sailed away.  .- Afterwards there was another battle, where the American light horse and the English light horse met on the main road to Cornwall, and they fought sword  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7685-00000069"/> 132      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF in hand courageously for several hours, till the Americans made them surrender, and took all that were not killed, prisoners. There was also a battle at Cornwall, and the Americans took it and destroyed all the government buildings and took all the gov- ernment property. Also, the battle of Prescott, where the Amer- icans crossed on the ice from Ogdensburg to Prescott and attacked the British; but the British were too much for them, so they had to retreat back after a great loss, and the British pursued them over the ice and set fire to Ogdensburgh and burned it down. About this time General Hull sold the American army, and gave up the town of Detroit to the British General, and the American prisoners were all taken to Quebec. The prisoners were put in bateaux, with. a guard in each boat, and were started on- their way to Quebec, down the St. Lawrence river. Among them was an American captain Chapin, and most of his company were on the same boat with him; this bat- eaux kept behind all the rest. Captain Chapin pull- ed out a large bottle of brandy, saying, ' Come boys, lay down your guns and all take something to drink!' The moment they laid down their guns, he winked to his men, and they snatched them all up. "Now," said the captain, " pull us over here to Sackett's Harbor!" and the order was obeyed. After they landed, captain Chapin called up the red coats and said, "Now, my boys, come up and have something to drink!" and he treated them all,   DAVID R;USSELL.       133 saying, "Now, soldiers, you are all on the land of liberty, and if you think proper to join the American army we will give you a bounty and pay you be- sides!"  They all readily joined the regular ser- vice. There were also many other battles and skirm- ishes fought in Canada. I will now give a short sketch of the battle of New Orleans.  The British had fitted up and shipped a splendid army from England; there was also aE large British fleet with them. They came up across lake Ponchartrain, and entered the foot of the river at the Big Swamp. . General Packenham sent a flag of truce into the town, demanding to have it surren- der and none should be hurt. The town had partly agreed to surrender; but at this time up came Gen- eral Jackson, when the head officials of the town told him what they were about to do, and also that there was no use to attempt to fight against such a large army. 'After fully stating -their apprehensions and fears, they inquired, "Well, General, what are you going to do?" "Why," 5exclaimed the young hero, 1' when I sur- render this town up, I surrender it up in ashes!" At this he put the whole city under martial law and took command of it. Then he sent proclama- tions to all the surrounding states, calling on them to raise troops and have them sent on as quick as possi- ble, for there was a large British army about landing and they would take all the Southern states if they did land.              *        1 Assistance began to pour in from every quarter, and he soon had a large army. After he had got his  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7685-00000070"/> 134      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF army all together, he advanced to the south part of the town, where the British would have to land if they landed at all. He then gave \orders for each man to take a spade or shovel, and they commenced digging a ditch, six feet deep and six feet wide. All along the levee lay thousands and thousands of bales of cotton. Those cotton bales -are four feet. square, cubic measure, weighing four or five hundred pounds each bale. These were placed, three bales high and three wide, which made a breastwork twelve feet high and twelve feet wide; and the ditch, which was six feet, being on the outside, made it eighteen feet high. In the bottom tier he had joints between the bales, large enough to poke out a rifle and fire. At length Packenham advanced his army, and attempt- ed to scale the bales by crossing the ditch; but as fast as his troops got in the ditch they were shot down.  Lord Packenham  was himself killed, as well as most all his officers, to say nothing of the slaughter of his troops. All that were not killed were taken prisoners, and they took all their ammu- nition and arms, and every thing they had, and when the fleet found that the British were defeated, they put off to sea. This Andrew Jackson was the cause of saving New Orleans from the hands of the British, when a set of cowards were about surrendering it up. Had An- drew Jackson listened to them, he would have not only lost New Orleans, but all the south of the United States. Now, my friends and fellow citizens of the United States, and true Americans, this Andrew Jackson   DAVID RUSSELL.       135 knew it behooved him to fight in defence of his country, and save his country,/if possible, which he did in the most skillful manner. He defeated and took the most splendid army that England ever had of its size, composed of the finest men; and all this with only a loss of five or six men! Andrew Jack- son also fought under General Greene, in South Carolina, during the revolutionary war. When he was only twelve years old,' he was out in a scouting. party and was taken prisoner by the British, and this same man was he whom the British officer tied up and flogged, when he was a prisoner of war, because he refused to black their boots and shoes, which they had no right to do; and this is he also that told them he would make them suffer for it, before he was fifty years old, which he did. Now, my friends, and fellow citizens, and true Americans, I was acquainted with this man for about forty years before he died, and he was acquainted with my father and my three uncles, and he knew they were all old revolutionary soldiers. A better man and a tiuer American never drew a sword than An- drew Jackson.  Thus saith David Russell-the true American.  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7685-00000071"/> 136      AUToBIOGRAPHY OF CHAPTER    IV. Peace. Proclaimed--Off again to, London-Recognition by old friends-Miss Priscilla Russell sick-Attempt at marriage- Death intervenes-Farewell to the family. SHORTLY after the events just narrated, peace was proclaimed. I then prepared to go to Lolldon. In looking over the papers, I saw a ship advertised as bound for London-the Neptune, five hundred tons burden, commanded by Captain William Parker. She was to sail in two weeks. I went down to see the captain, examine the ship, and engage a berth. I made a bargain for my passage to London, and the ship left about the appointed time. We had a pleasant passage, and a fair wind part of the way after we started, but before many days we were taken in a severe gale, which blew from the north west, so that we had to send down our royal and top-gallant yards, and strike our royal top-gal- lant mast, close reef our topsails, clue up our fore- sail and mainsail close, and set our storm staysails. This gale lasted about three days, and the ship rolled and pitched tremendously, so that our barrels had to be lashed, and the tables, and chests, and pots, and kettles were thrown about every way, and all the passengers were - sea-sick. After this, the storm abated, and we had a fair wind. We raised our top-gallant mast, and sent up our royal and top-gal- 4    DAVID RUSSELL.       137 lant yards, and set all sail; in a few weeks we hove in sight of England. We passed the Ram's Head light-house, cleared the rocks of Scilly, and passed the Isle of Wight, with its beautiful white, chalk cliffs, splendid to be- hold. In a short time we were at the mouth of the river Thames; there our pilot came on board to take us up the river. The next morning, when I went on deck, I found we were safely moored alongside of Blackwall Dock, where I had sailed from three years before. I then washed and dressed myself, and hired a hack to go to London. The captain asked me at what hotel I was going to put up. I told him I was going to stop at the "Wheat Sheaf" inn for a short time. "Well," said he, " you have picked a good place, for the landlord of that inn is a very fine and clever man; his name is Jackson." "Yes, sir, I know him well." "What," said he, " do you know Mr. Jackson?'" Yes, sir, I left his house about three years ago, and I sailed from about the very same spot that you are laying in now, in the Lady Jane, to Boston. Soon after I arrived in Boston, war was declared. I then volunteered into the American service and joined the cavalry. I was then sent to Canada, and was at the battle of Stony Creek, Twenty Mile Creek, Lundy's Lane and Chippewa. At Lundy's Lane I got wounded." "( Well, Mr. Russell, whose son are you?" I told him I was the son of John H. Russell. "Are you related to Colonel Russell, of Boston?"  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7685-00000072"/> 138.     AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF I told him that I was; that he was my father's brother. 's Are you the young man that I used to see il the counting-room, at Colonel Russell's?" "Yes, sir, I am the very one." "Well, Mr. Russell, you are from a very respecta- A ble family. I was not much acquainted with your father, but I have understood that he was the smart- est of all the brothers."  "Yes, sir, according to the history of his life, he must have been an uncommon smart man."  - "Well, he was a very wealthy man."       "Yes, sir, he was worth considerable when he died." "Did not your uncles owe him a great deal of money when he died?" "Well, captain, I can't tell you much about it, for I was very young when he died, but I have under-   stood that they did."               l "Well, Mr. Russell, I am sorry that I did not get more acquainted with you before, for I have a good deal to say to you, but I will see you at Mr. Jack- j SOnlS." S  We shook hands and parted. I then got in the hack and told the driver to take me to the "' Wheat  Sheaf" inn. In a short time I was landed at the door, where Mr. Jackson met me. "My dear friend, Mr. Russell!" he exclaimed, "I am happy to see you. You told us you would be back again in about three years, but I did not think ( it at the time. Why, Mr. Russell, you look as well as ever you did; you certainly look beautiful."   DAVID RUSSELL.      139 "Yes, sir, I look well, considering what I have gone through since I left England, and I thank the Almighty for his protection in bringing me through the many difficulties and dangers that I have encoun- tered since I last saw you." I then discharged the driver, and Mr. Jackson invited me into his own private apartment. Mrs. Jackson came in, and said,-- Welcome, welcome, Mr. Russell, to England and to my house." At this time the girls came in; they shook hands with me, and said they were happy to see me landed safe in England, ' Mr. Jackson," said I, ' had you not three daugh- ters, when I left?" "Yesh said lie, ' I had, but my oldest has got married and moved away. She has often spoken of you, Mr. Russell, for she thought a great deal of you." "Yes, Mr. Jackson, I thought a great deal of her, for certainly she was a very highly accomplished young lady, and I hope she has got a good partner, for certainly she is worthy of a good partner." "Well, I don't know about that, but I am rather doubtful of it; I know one thing certain, that he is not the man that you are. Now, Mr. Russell, my wife and myself are going tomorrow to see them, and I want you to go with us, for I know that she would be very happy to see you; also I would like to have you go, for I know you are a man that can penetrate through their countenance and find out their princi- ples."  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7685-00000073"/> "O      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF "Well," said I, "Mr. Jackson, what is her part- ner's name?" "His name is James Richardson." I was then invited in to take some refreshments. After we were all seated, and had helped ourselves freely, Mr. Jackson observed, "Well, Mr. Russell, my house is filled again." "What," said I, " you had a large party when, I was here before; you was pretty well crowded, I thought!" "I did riot mean that; I consider your return fills the heart of myself and all my family, and also fills my house. Since you have left this house, there has not been a night that you have not been talked about, when our family met together; about your singing or dancing, and your telling anecdotes, and your sociability; and also at the throne of grace, for your protection and safe return to England. And, Mr. Russell, my daughter that is married scarcely ever ceases praying for your protection and safe return to England. Also, Mr. Robertson and Mr. Brown have offered up petitions to the Almighty for your protec- tion and safe return to England." "Well, Mr. Jackson, I feel ten thousand times obliged to you for your kindness and for your prayers, and also to Mr. Robertson and Mr. Brown. It seems, Mrs. Jackson, that the prayers of the righte- ous avail much, and your petitions are answered; he for whohm you have prayed, is now before you. As, to Mr. Robertson and Mr. Brown, please God I will go and see them after dinner, and they shall behold me with their own eyes. But, Mrs. Jackson, how is my /   DAVID RUSSELL.       141 dear Priscilla? I have not asked you about her, but still, I have had her on my mind all the time!" "Ah," said she, she was taken sick immediately' after you left, and she has been on the decline ever since. You must go immediately to see her; I have no doubt but that the sight of you will do her more good than all the medicine in London." "Will you allow your two daughters to go with me?"I asked. "Certainly, by all means," answered Mrs. Jack- son; and she ordered the carriage to be brought up. We all got in the carriage, and I ordered the driver to take us to Mr. Russell's. When we drove up to the door, every thing looked as solemn as death. We were invited in. I told the girls that they had better go in the room and see Priscilla, and if she was very low not to mention my name, but to tell her there was a friend come to see her. They then went in, and in a little while one came out and told me Priscilla was better that morn- ing than she had been for some time, and I was invited in. I then went in and sat down in the sitting-room. Mrs. Russell then came in the room   and took me by the hand, saying, "I My dear young man, you are welcome in my house, and I want you to make it your home, and promise me that you will. I am heart sorry that you ever left England, for my daugh- ter has never seen one hour's comfort since you left, and she has had poor health ever since. So, now, Mr. Russell, I want you not to break her heart any longer, but to stay With her."  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7685-00000074"/> "2      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF "Mrs. Russell, I told you when I left, that as soon as my countrymen had gained their rights and the honor of their flag on the high seas, I would come back again. I told you that I thought the war would last about three years, and it is now a little more than three years since I was here. Since I was here, Mrs. Russell, I have gone through trials, difficulties, and dangers, having enemies on the right and left, and by the blessing of the Almighty and his loving- kindness and mercy that never faileth, I am permit- ted to stand before you this day, and proclaim his goodness that never faileth. I have come to see you to-day, and to England, wholly and solely on the ac- count of your daughter. She is the object of my heart and whom I intend to cherish, for I love her as I love my own life. At this I was invited into the room; Priscilla was now sitting in the rocking-chair. I took a chair and sat down by her side, and I said, "My dear Priscilla, how do you feel this morning?" "Oh! my dear Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell!" she exclaimed, and then we embraced each other. She continued, "Oh, Mr. Russell, my soul doth magnify the Lord this morning, that he has answered my request! Day and night have I lifted up my prayers to heaven that you might be protected and be brought back safe to England, and my prayers have been heard and answered. Now, Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, I want you not to leave me any more, for I have never seen any peace or comfort since you left me; and, now, Mr. Russell, I want you to promise me on your word and honor, and I know you are an honorable young man, to make   DAVID RUSSELL.       143 your home here, and be at home as you would in your own father's house." We were now invited to dinner; we all sat down, and Mr. Russell asked 'a blessing. After dinner I left Mrs. Russell and the girls in the sitting-room while I went into Priscilla's room. I said to her, "Well Priscilla, my dear, how do you feel now? Is there any thing I can do for you? for I have come wholly to wait on you, day and night, and be with you while you are sick!" "Oh!" she replied, "Mr. Russell, you are very kind, indeed. I have often thought about you since you left me, and I have dreamed many dreams about you, one of which I want to tell you. I thought I was in a country that had much wilderness in it; I thought I crossed a bridge, and after I crossed, I turned back and looked at the stream and the water was very black and very deep. I thought I traveled on a short distance till I came to a large piece of woods where the trees appeared lofty and high, and to be all evergreen trees; these woods were swarming with men and tents. I passed on a little further till I came to a small village, I then stopped at the inn and took refreshments. At the corner of this inn there was a wide road which I could see turned short to the left, and a little distance on the road, I sup- pose about a quarter of a mile, there was a high and steep hill. I went back again into the inn and sat down in the parlor, where I commenced reading a book. Pretty soon I went out again and looked down the road that the hill was on, and looked par- ticularly at the hill, for it was beautiful to behold,  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7685-00000075"/> "4      A UTOBIOGRAPHY OF and, to my astonishment, the hill was covered with men, all around on both sides. There were flags flying, about quarter of a mile apart, and they ap- peared red, and were guarded with heavy companies of men.- I stood a short time and looked at them, and while I was standing -I heard a sound, and it ap- peared as of many bugles. I saw some thousand horsemen and they were riding as hard as they could go, sword in hand, towards those men on the hill; and I thought I saw you ; and I saw a large army of men following after, with their bayonets all fixed on thleir guns. The cavalry rushed on the men on the "hill, and I saw you fighting for a long time. At last you seemed to lose ground, and your man on your right hand was cut down, and I thought it was you. I saw you all over blood, and the blood gushing out from under your shirt; I looked again and you dis- appeared, and then I went to the inn and wept bitterly!' I assured her that her dream was true, and said to her, "Priscilla, I have suffered many things since I left you, but I told you that I would come back to England again, and I have come .back as I agreed, ac- cording to my word and honor!" "Yes, Mr. Russell, I knew that you would come back if you were alive and well, but I also knew that you would fight for the cause of your country, and might possibly get killed in the field of battle; for this reason;I feared I never should see you again." "Now, Priscilla, I want you to cheer up your spirits, and get well as fast as you can; you have been low-spirited long enough, and that is the cause   DAVID RUSSELL.       145 of your being so long sick, and so very sick. As soon as you get able to ride out, I want you to let me know, and I will take you out in the carriage." Accordingly I gave her nourishments, and discharg. ed the doctor, and in a few weeks I had her so as she could ride out in the carriage. She kept getting stronger and better every day. We went around every day visiting our friends and neighbors. We visited Mr. Robertson first; when we went there Mrs. Robertson met us at the carriage and wel- coined us in the house, saying, "Mr. Russell and Priscilla, I am happy to see you once more seated in my house.  Little did I think of ever seeing Mr. Russell any more; and Priscilla, one time that I was at your mother's house, little, did I think of ever seeing you any more in this world. It seems that the sight of Mr. Russell has cheered us all up. I think, Priscilla, he is the best doctor for you yet." "Yes," said the   daughter, "I believe if Mr. Russell had not come back, Priscilla would not have lived three days longer." "C Well," said I, " girls, I am going to have Pris- cilla in a few weeks as well as ever she was. She is gaining as fast as could be expected." We then had tea, and a splendid tea it was. Mrs. Robertson remarked, what a   sight of comfort was taken with a sociable, friendly person. 6"Yes," said I, "Mrs. Robertson, friendship unites our hearts together and gives peace and comfort to all around us." Tea being over we were all invited into the sitting- room; one of the girls played some beautiful tunes 7  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7685-00000076"/> "6      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF on the piano, and the rest sang. We passed away the time till Mr. Robertson came home; when he came in the house he was astonished. He said, "Welcome, welcome, Mr. Russell! You look as well as ever you did! I wish our friend Mr. Brown was here to-night, for he has been talking about you ever since you left here, and wondering if he would ever see you again!" He added, "Priscilla, you look better than you did when I saw you at your mother's! Mr. Russell, you are not going to leave us any more!" ' No, Mr. Robertson, I expect to live and die in England." Priscilla said, "Mr. Robertson, I don't intend to let Mr. Russell ever leave England any more!" We sat a short time longer, and then I had to take Priscilla home. I had every thing necessary to wrap her up with, so as to keep her from taking cold, for the evening was quite cool. Mr. Robertson said, "Mr. Russell, weare going to have a large party at Mr. Jackson's tomorrow even- ing, about four o'clock, to be kept up till about ten o'clock in the evening, and I want you and Priscilla to come." I told him I would go if Priscilla was able. We then bid them good-night, got into the'carriage and went home. On our way, Priscilla observed, "Mr. Russell, how happy I do feel!" "Well, Priscilla, my dear, it is a blessed thing to be happy in this world, but it is far better to be happy in the world to come." "Yes, Mr. Russell, I know it is, but there are , A   DAVID RUSSELL.       147 thousands that are not happy in this world, and will not be happy in the world to come." By this time the carriage drove up to the door and we went into the house. In the sitting-room we found Mr. Russell and his wife talking. Mrs. Rus- sell said' "David, we were just talking about you. Mr. Russell was telling me that he knew you would come back again, for he took notice of you when you - were telling him and Priscilla that you would come back when the war was over, in about three years, and he saw in your countenance that you would do what you said!" "Yes, Mrs. Russell, I intended to do just as I told you, and I have done so." "Yes, my dear boy, we are all perfectly well satis- fied of your veracity and honor." At this, we all fell down ;around the family altar and offered prayer to the heavenly Father for his kind protection over us all, daily and hourly, and for his mercy that endureth forever. i After the old folks left and had retired to bed, I said to my dear Priscilla, "Now you know I am come from North America to take you for my dear be- loved wife. I want you to give me an answer when you will be ready to have the wedding?" She replied, "Mr. Russell, I will let you know in a day or two, as quick as I talk to my ma." "' Well," said I, "Priscilla, the quicker you let me know the better, for your good and for mine. You know that we have to go to Mr. Jackson's tomorrow, and I want to get there by eight or nine o'clock, if you are well enough to go."  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7685-00000077"/> "8      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OP We now retired to bed. Early next morning I arose and washed, and dressed myself in a fine suit of bottle green cloth, with a yellow cashmere vest. I came down stairs as the girl was setting the table for breakfast. I asked her if Priscilla was up. By this time Priscilla rung the bell, and the servant went in to see what was wanted. She came out and invited me into Priscilla's sitting-room. By-and-bye she came out, and I said to her, "Good morning, Priscilla, my dear; how do you do this morning?" "Mr. Russell, I don't feel quite as well as I did last evening.' "Priscilla," said I, "perhaps I have disturbed you of your rest." "Oh, no, Mr. Russell, I was getting up before I heard you and the maid talking." "Well, Priscilla, perhaps you had better lay down a little while, and don't let me disturb you of your rest, my dear." "Oh, no, Mr. Russell, I think I will feel better when I ride out in the carriage." At this time breakfast was ready. Mr. Russell asked a blessing, and we all took breakfast. Afterwards the carriage drove up, and we went to Mr. Jackson's. When we drove up to Mr. Jackson's door he met us and invited us into the sitting-room. Mrs. Jackson and the girls came in, and the old lady exclaimed, "How do you do, Mr. Russell and Pris- cilla! I am happy to see you both! Why, Priscilla, you look much better than when I saw you before!" "Yes, Mrs. Jackson," Priscilla replied, "I feel much better than I did before."   DAVID RUSSELL.      149 "And, Mr. Russell, you look well this morning." "Yes, I feel very thankful that I do; you know, Mrs. Jackson, that health and strength are great blessings, and we ought to be very thankful for them." "Yes, my dear boy, we ought, indeed; and we ought to be more thankful for every thing we get from our heavenly Father." By this time Mr. Jackson and Mr. Brown came in.. Mr. Brown observed, "Mr. Russell, happy am I to see you once more in England. I feel as though the lost is found, for, indeed, we have missed you many times, and felt lost without you. For my own part, I can say, that when I sat down with my dear family at night, I missed one who used to talk with my children, to give them good instructions, and teach them things they never thought of. Now, Mr. Rus- sell, I have always remembered you in my prayers to my heavenly Father, that he might guide and protect you, and bring you safe back to England again. Mr. Russell, you have got many friends in England,whom you know but little about, and my advice to you is, never to leave England any more, for I know you would do well in England. I know several men in London who would give you a good chance to start in business." "Well, sir," I replied, "I don't expect I shall leave England." At this declaration, Mr. Jackson said,--"Mr. Rus- sell, if I was sure you would stay in England, I would set you up- in business myself, for I respect you higher than any other man that I ever was acquainted   &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7685-00000078"/> 150      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF with the same length of time, and would do any thing in my power to start you in business." " Well, Mr. Jackson,"' I replied, "I am ten thou- sand times obliged to you for your kindness, and also to Mr. Brown for all his kind treatment, for I never have been treated better in any country in my life." At this time a carriage drove up to the door, and who should be in it but captain Parker, and several other captains that had been at the ball three years ago at Mr. Jackson's. One of them  exclaimed,-  ," Hallo, here is my friend Russell!" and he gave me a hearty shake of hands, saying, -"God bless you I I am as happy to see you as I would be my own brother." He turned around to captain Parker, who said,- ," Captain, this. is Mr. Russell, a young man from North America, and a true American. Captain Gar- ret, I say a true American; indeed, he is as true as steel, and all his folks were true Americans. Cap- tain Garret, whenever I look at my flag that flies on the peak, I think of John H. Russell, William, and Thomas, and Joseph.  I think of all those men who have spent their lives and money for the free- dom of America and the honor of their flag; and those men, captain Garret, were some of the main pillars in gaining the independence of their country, and a smarter .man than John H. Russell never lived. When you look at this boy, you see John H. Russell, for he resembles him as much as two peas." ,' Well," said captain Garret, " if he looked like his son, he was a fine looking fellow, for certainly he is as fine a looking fellow as there is in all"London."   DAVID RUSSELL.       151 "Yes, sir, and his three brothers were fine looking fellows, and they were all fine men, and their names will last as long as time, in America." "It seems, captain Parker, that you are ac- quainted with him and his folks." "Yes, sir, I am acquainted with David and all his folks, and I tell you, captain Garret, that this young man's father was very wealthy indeed when he died; he set his three brothers up in business, to my knowl- edge; and this young man, David, is very wealthy. His father left him a great deal of money, and his three uncles will leave him a great deal." We were invited into an elegant supper. Mr. Brown asked a blessing, and we had a splendid re- past. After supper we were invited into the sitting-room, when captain Garret said,--"Well, gentlemen, I have been to a great many balls, but I never saw a man more active, or who could carry a double cotil- lon better than Mr. Russell on a ball-room floor." "Yes," said captain Parker, c' this young man, David, can turn his hand to any thing, and his father was just like him. Gentlemen, if I was to undertake to tell the history of this young man, and his father and uncles, it would take me twenty-four hours to tell it." At this time Priscilla said she should like to go home, and asked me if I would accompany her. I told her I would, by all means. The carriage was brought up, and we bade the company good-night, and went home.  After we got home we went into  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7685-00000079"/> 152      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF the sitting-room and sat down. Priscilla was very poorly that evening; she suffered considerable. Mrs. Russell said to me--"Mr. Russell, I am sending letters to all my acquaintances; some of them live fifty or sixty miles off. I am going to have the wedding got up in the highest style." Every body knew of the wedding, all over London. Priscilla was failing every day, and, I saw it. One day I was sitting in her private parlor, in the rock- ing-chair, and she came and sat down on my lap; throwing her arms around my neck, she said,-"Oh, Mr. Russell, Mr. Russell, I wish I was well, for your sake and for mine." I embraced her and said,-"Priscilla, my dear Priscilla, I hope you will be better tomorrow, but you must not go out any more till you get better." She inquired,--"Mr. Russell, will you stay with me?" "Certainly, my dear, I will stay with you; I told you I would stay with you day and night, and attend to you." She talked at times very freely indeed, then she would lower her voice, like one that was fainting away. I stayed with her all that night, and early next morning she was better. I said to her, "Pris- cilla, how do you feel this morning?"   [T  To which she replied,-. Mr. Russell, I feel much better," and she still kept getting better, so that she was soon quite smart and cheerful, but she would not allow me to go out of her sight. A servant girl also waited on her day and nighlt. I said to her one day, "Priscilla, my dear, I hope   DAVID. RUSSELL.       153 you are going to get well, for the time is fast hasten- ing when you and I shall be one, and I would to God, my dear Priscilla, it was to-day."  "Yes, Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, I would be happy to have it over. But Mr. Russell, my dear maminma is making such- great preparations; she is going to have about one hundred persons here, and' it is going to be as great a wedding as ever was in London.'  "I sayl, Priscilla, if I could have had my way, you and I would have been married long ago, and it would have been just as happy a wedding as what we will have now." "Yes, Mr. Russell, but that would not suit my mamnma.5" "Well," said I, "Priscilla, it may all come out right, but I am rather doubtful of it." The time was fast hastening away, and there were- but a few days before the time appointed for the mar- riage. The people were fast coming every day in their carriages to the wedding, so that the house was crowded at this time. I had to dress myself very neat, for I was introduced to a great number every day, and the remark would be, "Well, he is a fine looking young man, indeed." Priscilla kept her private room constantly, and if I would be out of her sight five minutes she would send the servant girl for me.  The day before the appointed day of the wedding, she   sent for me. She said, "Mr. Russell, I do wish this wedding was over." I replied,--"Priscilla, I do heartily wish- it was 7*  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7685-00000080"/> 154      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF over myself. Now, Priscilla, I want you to answer me this question." "I will, Mr. Russell, I will answer you any thing." "Do you not feel worse than you did yesterday?" "I do, indeed." "Do you not feel worse than you did this morn- ing?" "I do." Are you not getting worse all the time?" ' Yes, I am." The next day was the wedding, and the guests crowded around Priscilla so that she could scarcely draw her breath. I said to the ladies that they must stand back and give Priscilla more air, and I ordered the windows to be raised. At this she fainted away in my arms, when I raised her up, and laid her on the bed. I immediately sent for a doctor. By this time her mother and girl had got her dressed in her night-clothes, and the doctor came and examined her. I asked the doctor what he thought of her. Said he,-"Young man, this is a house of rejoicing, it seems. Are you the young man that is about to marry this young lady?" I told him I was. "I thought you was," he replied. a Ildeed, sir, you look like a fine young man, and the picture of health. You are in your bloom, but you will never- marry that young lady, unless you marry her in about three hours; and now," continued he, " young man, whatever you have to say to her, you must say it quickly." I went immediately to Priscilla's room, and asked   DAVID RUSSELL.       155 to have it cleared, for I had some words to say to Priscilla that I wished no person to hear but her mother and father. Accordingly the people all left the room. I took Priscilla by the hand and said, "My dear Priscilla, how do you feel?" She replied, "Mr. Russell, I feel quite easy." This I knew to be bad news. I then said, ' Pris- cilla, my dear girl, don't you feel fast sinking?" "Why," said she, "Mr. Russell, I do feel very strange, indeed, and every thing looks strange around me." I then told her mother to have a minister sent for. I said to Priscilla, "My dear girl, you are fast sink- ing away, and you are fast hastening to eternity. Do you feel as though you had made your calling and election sure? Have you faith in the Son of God and in his blood? Do you feel that you are passing from death to life, as though you would soon join the heavenly throng and leave this wicked and sinful world?" "Yes, Mr. Russell, I feel to put my whole depend- ence on my-dear Saviour, one who is able to save to the uttermost!" She took me by the hand, "Mr. Russell, we were about to get married, but I hope we will get married in a better world! I wish it was so that you could go with me; you have fulfilled all your vows and all your promises to me; you have acted like a man of honor and principle to me; you have treated me with the highest respect and cour- tesy, and in the highest love and kindness, not re- garding dangers, trials and difficulties that you had to encounter. Now, Mr. Russell, I feel sorry for one thing!"  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7685-00000081"/> 156      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OP "What is that, my dear Priscilla?" ' That my ma did not listen to you in respect to the wedding. My property ought to have all belonged to you, and if we had been married it would have all belonged to you; but now I think my ma will do all things right by you." "  My dear Priscilla, whatever way you wish your property to go, it ought to be done by an attorney. My advice to you now is, to have an attorney sent for immediately, and have a will made; and mention every thing just as you wanted it in the will, and then every one will get just what you leave them. Now, Priscilla, I consider you and me as much man and wife as if we had been married ten thousand times, for all it lacked was for the minister to pro- nounce us man and wife! Now, Priscilla, let me ex- hort you to have an attorney and have your will drawn up, and I will see that every thing is done as you direct." She then spoke to her ma, and said," Ma, I think you had better send for a lawyer, as Mr. Russell sug- gests, for he will not advise you wrong; he is a friend to you and me both, yes, and more than a friend!" I saw that I could prevail nothing on the old lady or the old man; I then told the servant to fetch me a bowl of water and some soap. I then stood up in the presence of them all, and raising my- eyes to heaven, said, '"Before God Almighty and all the holyr angels, and all the heavenly throng, and before you, Priscilla, and before you, Mr. and Mrs. Russell, and before all you young ladies and gentlemen, I see   DAVID RUSSELL.       157 there is an intrigue in this property, for they are not willing to have the will drawn, or the thing done right. I now wash my hands and declare myself innocent of any intrigue as touching this property!" Priscilla lingered along for about twelve hours. About this time the minister came, and after a short talk with her, he engaged in prayer. He made a most fervent petition for us all. He then left the house, saying he would call again. Priscilla kept sensible till about the last, when she gave three easy struggles and her life departed. The house was crowded with people, who had come to the wedding, for which great preparations had been made.  People came from  far and near to attend it; but it seemed it was not the will of the Almighty. Instead of rejoicing, it was turned into mourning, for there was nothing but weeping from one end of the house to the other. Priscilla was beloved by all who knew her, far and near, for she was a fine, amiable young lady, kind, friendly and charitable to all, and of a noble disposition. No one could help loving her that ever knew her. I believe her spirit took its flight to Him that gave it, and I believe she is now in heaven rejoicing with all the heavenly hosts. Though I was not permitted to marry her, I hope I shall be permitted to join her before the heavenly throne, where we shall sing praises to "The Lamb that was slain, But lives again To intercede for us." No tongue can tell my feelings at that time, when  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7685-00000082"/> 158'     AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF I looked on that cold, pale face, which once looked like a blooming rose in the spring of the year,; whom I had loved, and cherished for upwards of three years; whom I had crossed the ocean back and forth for; for whom I had gone through all trials and difficulties, and dangers! I now behold her a lifeless corpse laying in her coffin, and nothing but gloom and sorrow and weeping and mourning around me, which made me cry out like one of old, "Oh, that I was cut off in my mother's womb!" I went to my room and fell down on my knees; I implored the Almighty to strengthen me; for I said, "Oh, Lord, thy rod is sore on me, more than I can bear; and I beseech thee, Almighty and most merciful God, to take away thy rod from me, for it is more than I can bear, and teach; me by thy holy spirit not to murmur, and, give me strength, 0 Lord, that I may bear up under all difficulties and trials; and teach me thy will, O God, that I may serve thee, daily and hlourly,'all the reat of nmy life. All these blessings I ask for the dear Redeemer's sake, Amen." This instance reminded me of the first com- mandment that the Lord gave unto Moses, 'Thou shalt have no other gods before me." Priscilla was the idol of her mother's heart; she worshiped her more than the Almighty.  Had it not been for her, Priscilla and I would have been married three years before, and Priscilla might have  lived to a good old age; for immediately after I left England she was taken sick and broken-hearted, and lingered on till I returned, which was more than   DAVID RUSSELL.       159 three years; and after I returned she began to get better, and in two weeks she was able to go out in the carriage and see her friends. When she asked me how long it would take me to get ready for the marriage, I said, "Priscilla, I am ready now; and I am sure you are ready, for you have every thing you need." '"Well, Mr. Russell," she replied, "I know I have plenty of every thing, and so have you; but my ma says you, must have a suit of clothes made in England, expressly for the wedding, and I must have every thing new and expressly for it; and she says it will take her about a month to get ready." I then said to her, "Priscilla, it is all foolishness to go to that expense and time, for it might be done immediately." But her mother would not listen to me or her, but would have her own way. So she went to work and made a great party, and had people come from far and near, and when they had all gathered to the wedding and every thing was ready, in place of its being her wedding it was turned into her funeral; and all they who came to attend her wedding attend- ed her funeral, and they beheld her for the last time on earth.         -  It was a great funeral, indeed, and there were a great many carriages, and a large number of peo- ple in procession walking. The body was deposited in a vault in St. Paul's grave-yard. After this we returned home, and a great number of the guests came  home with the old lady. She said, "Mr. Russell, you appear to feel very bad!"  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7685-00000083"/> 160      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF "Mrs. Russell, I do, indeed, I feel very bad; I can't find words to express my feelings, Mrs. Russell." "4 Well," said she, "Mr. Russell, you must make yourself at home, and here is a home for you as long as you live!" "No, no, Mrs. Russell, it's no home for me, for the sight of every thing in your house looks dismal and solemn to me. She is gone, gone, who would have made you and me and all around her happy, if you would have let her. Now, Mrs. Russell, I have a few words to say to you and then I shall leave you, and perhaps I shall never see you any more.  I would that God Almighty would take me from this world, that I might go where your daughter is! I feel like a wandering Arab, that wanders over the sandy desert of 'Arabia, seeking shade, shelter, water and rest; I also feel like a ship on the sea, without sails or rudder, for my sails, and rudder are gone from me. Indeed, I feel as though I had lost all I ever had in all my life; yea, and more than all, and all this trouble might have been avoided, had you done what was right; you, and you only, are the whole cause of it. How do you think I :can stay under such circumstances? No, Mrs. Russell, I am about to leave you. I hope the God of heaven will bless you, and take away that stony heart from you, and give you a heart of flesh; teaching you by His holy and blessed Spirit to do right for the future; and may God Almighty grant this, for His dear Son'S sake, Amen!" I thanked them for all their kindness, shook hands with them all and left them.   DAVID RUSSELL.        161 CHAPTER       V. Visit Mr. Robertson's--Propose to Quit England--Consolation and Sympathy of Friends-Inducements to remain in Eng- land-Men and Women beseech me, but in Vain. AFTER leaving the former house of Priscilla, I walk-. ed over to Mr. Robertson's. I found Mr. and Mrs. Robertson, and the girls in the sitting-room. Mr. Robertson was a little surprised to see me come so soon after the funeral. He said, "I did not expect to see you so soon after the fuineral." I told him that Mrs. Russell wanted me to stay, and to make it my home as long as I lived; but that I told her it was no home for me and never would be again; that I should leave her house in a very short time, and also I should leave England in a very few days, for my grief was more than I could bear, and she was the cause of it all; that every thing in her house looked mournful and dismal, for the object is gone that might have made her happy and all around.  "I told her this, Mr. Robertson, and a good deal, more, and then shook hands with them all and left them forever. Mr. Robertson, in a few days I shall leave Eng- land forever, for I see no comfort in England, and I don't know   as ever I shall see any more comfort in my life." At this his daughters and himself and his wife tried to comfort me. He sent for Mr. Jackson and  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7685-00000084"/> 162      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF Mr. Brown, and several of his friends that were ac- quainted with me. When Mr. Jackson came, his two daughters came with him, and Mr. Brown's two daughters came with him, and many others brought their daughters with them. They all tried to comfort me. Mr. Brown said, "Mr. Russell, you must not be sorry as one without hope, but have faith and hope in One that is able to carry you through all trials and difficulties. - I know it is hard to lose one whom we love and think a great deal of. But, Mr. Russell, our idolizing mortal flesh is not right in the sight of God. She whom you loved and cherished as you did your own soul, was idolized by all who knew her; her mother and father worshiped her more than the Creator; this was abomination in the sight of the Lord, for he says, ' Thou shalt have none other gods but me.' Now, Mr. Russell, let me exhort you in the name of the God of heaven, as one that loves your soul and loves you as his own life, not to put your trust in mortal flesh, nor in one that is only able to kill the body; but put your trust in One that is able to kill both body and soul, and pray to Him with a fervent spirit that he will support you under all trials and difficulties, whatever they may be, in life or death, prosperity or adversity, sickness or trials, in danger or tribulation, or any other thing; and pray without ceasing, that he might guide and protect you, and that He would give you strength to bear up under all 'these trials and difficulties, and that you might hold out faithful to the end, always giving glory to God and his Son forever; always   DAVID RUSSELL.       163 beseeching him that you might be admitted into His kingdom at last, for the dear Redeemer's sake, Amen! Now, Mr. Russell, I have something more to say to you, for I would wish to comfort you all I can. I know this mortal body is weak --weak in the flesh--and it is hard for us to bear up under difficul- ties and trials, unless we have aid from a Higher power, for truly the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. Now, Mr. Russell, let me exhort you not to give way to this trouble, for you have many friends in London who will assist you; and let me exhort, you not to leave England, for, Mr. Russell, you can do well in this country." Mr. Robertson said, "Mr. Russell, I know your trials and troubles are sore, but you must not give way under them. I am  ready to assist you to any thing you want, to start you into any kind of business, or to take you into my own business with me; and what need is there -of your leaving England?" "Mr. Robertson, I am heartily thankful to you for your kindness," I replied, ', and the gratitude I feel my tongue cannot express to you and my friends in England; and if the Almighty should allow me to live a thousand  years, I never could forget my friends in England.  When I was encamped in the wild woods in Canada, where the bears and wolves were howling around me, then did I think of my kind friends in England, and God forbid that I ever should forget them.  Mr. Robertson, when I came to Eng- land this Jast time, I expected to remain as long as England is at peace with the United States; but if there should come war, I should move to the United  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7685-00000085"/> 164      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF States; but, now, Mr.:Rlobertson, every thing looks like dross around me. When I used to look out of your window into the garden, and see all- those blooming roses and beautiful flowers, it served to cheer my very soul, and I was so animated that my heart leaped within me. I used to say to myself, Surely, the glory of God shines around me, and i can see it.' But, now, Mr. Robertson, all things appear like dross around me; I see no beauty in any thing in all England, and I would pray to God, if it was his will, to take me out of this troublesome world this moment, that I may go where she is gone that I loved and cherished as my own soul. Mr. Robertson, it matters not where I am, for I shall never see much comfort in this world." ,At this, Mr. Jackson spoke,-"My dear friend Russell, I feel for you this day, indeed I do I have sat and listened to your conversation some time, and I do pity you from the bottom of my heart. My daughters and every one in this house pities you, from the bottom of their hearts, for they all know that yours are not vain feelings, but true and senti- mental feelings, and, my dear brother, do let me ex- hort you, in the name of the great I Am, and in the name of Him that sees with his all-seeing eye, and in the name of Him that supports the pillars of the tem- ple, and in the name of Him that carries the reed to measure the Great City, for He is the master builder, and one that will execute his line, and plumb it in order. Now, my dear brothers put your trust in Him, and he will carry you safe through the gates of the city, where you will triumph in glory." (Masonic comfort.)   DAVID RUSSELL.       165 Mrs. Robertson said,--," My dear young man, Mr. Russell, little did I think that such a blooming, rosy, bold, and fine-looking countenance should be pressed down so low; but my dear young friend, let me exhort you not to give way to those feelings, nor let them press you down so low. Put your trust in your heavenly Father, and he will guide and protect you. He never will leave you; he will carry you through the sixth struggle, and in the seventh he will not for- sake you. Yea, and He will carry you through deep waters and bring you out more than conqueror. It is He to whom you must look for comfort, and pray to him that he would send his guardian angel to guard you day and night. Now, Mr. Russell, a few more words, and then I am done. Mr. Russell, you are a young man I highly respect, and all my family respect you. We esteem yotras a young man of high honor and principle. My dear young man, let me advise you not to leave England, for here you can have a home where you will be' treated as well as in your own mother's house; myself and my family will do all in our power to comfort you." "Mrs, Robertson, I feel highly thankful to you for your kindness, and I can't find words to express my feelings to you for your kindness, and your family's kindness to me, for I never was treated better in my life than I have been in your house." At this time all the girls had gone up to dress themselves, and Mrs. Robertson had gone up with them. In a short time they all came down. The young ladies were all dressed in white, with pink silk aprons, and a wide blue ribbon tied around the waist,  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7685-00000086"/> 166      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF and a wreath of roses around their heads. They all stood up and formed a circle, and they passed around by me, and each one handed me a note, as they passed. Mr. Robertson said,-- Mr. Russell, my wife and myself, and daughters are going to Redruff tomor- row. It is about thirty miles, from London. My family are very anxious to have you go with us, and I want to know if you will go?" "Yes, Mr. Robertson," I replied, " will go." It was now getting late. Mr. Brown took the Bible, and read a chapter; we sung a hymn, and all went to prayer. After they had all invited me to come to see them, they bid us good-night and retired to their homes, and in a little while we all retired to bed. Next morning, after breakfast, the carriage was brought up to the door, when Mr. Robertson and all his family, and myself, got in and drove to Redruff. We passed many beautiful gardens, splendid parks, and bowers, and some very fine buildings. At length wearied at Redruff, we drove up to a splendid build- ing, with gardens all round it. It was Mr. Robert- son's brother's place. We were invited into a large, splendid sitting-room. Mr. Robertson introduced me to his brother and all his family, as Mr. Russell, a young man from North America. His brother asked me how I liked England? I told him very well indeed. He asked me how I liked the people of England? I told himn very well indeed. He asked me how the war went in America. I told him it was very severe sometimes.   DAVID RUSSELL.       167 Mr. Robertson remarked to his brother,--" This is the young man that was the bridegroom of the de- ceased that was buried a day or two ago-Miss Pris- cilla Russell." We were now called in to supper, and we sat down to a splendid repast, after which we were invited into the parlor. The girls played on the piano and sung, and we passed away the evening very pleasantly. About ten o'clock we went to prayer, and then we all retired to bed. Early the next morning we arose and took breakfast. Then the carriage came up to the door, and we bid them all good-bye, and returned home. After we got home we took supper, and then went into the sitting-room. Maria came and sat down beside me, and said, "Well, Mr. Russell, how did you enjoy yourself at my uncle's?" "Pretty well, my dear," I replied, " as well as could be expected, with my present feelings, my dear."    . Well," said one of the other girls," how did you like our cousins .?" "My dear, I like them very well; I think they are very pretty girls."         - : Mr. Robertson said, "Well, Mr. Russell, how did you like that country-seat of my brother's?" "I  think it is beautiful," I replied, " and every thing is so beautifully set out." "How would you like a country-seat like that?" "Mr. Robertson, I could not tell now, Inl my pres- ent state of feeling, how I should like it; but Ihllave seen the day that I should like it much."  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7685-00000087"/> 168      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF "Well, Mr. Russell, you can have a country-seat like that." "Ah, Mr. Robertson, I will never be able to buy a country-seat like that." "My dear Mr. Russell, if you will stay in England you shall have as good a country-seat as my brother." Mrs. Robertson said, "Now, Mr. Russell, there is something to keep you from leaving England, and I want you to make it your home in my family, and not leave us." "Mrs. Robertson," I replied, "I feel myself at home in your house, and I ever have felt at home here. I feel sorry that things have worked with me the way they have since I landed here, three years ago and better. But I was after 'an object that I never could obtain. It reminds me of many things that I have seen and read of. I suppose, Mrs. Rob- ertson, you have read the history of Peru?" "Yes," she replied, "I have read a little of it, but I have forgotten all I read." Well, you heard me tell the history of Napoleon Bonaparte three years ago and better?" "Yes, I did, and it was most splendidly done." "Do you reccollect what passed that evening be- fore I commenced the lecture?" "No, Mr. Russell, I don't' reoollect any thing about it." "Well, Maria, my dear, do you recollect any thing that passed?" "I only recollect some few words," she replied. "Will you be so kind as to relate them to your mother?"   *DAVID RUSSELL.       169 She related some to her mother, and it was pretty much the same as it happened. "Well, Mr. Robertson," I observed, "that was the first night that ever I had seen Priscilla'. You know Priscilla was the cause of my relating the history of Napoleon Bonaparte." "Yes," said Maria, "I recollect, Priscilla observed that her father and uncles were very good in relat- ing history, and'asked you if you could relate any." "Yes, Maria, my dear, those are about the words that passed. Now, Mrs. Robertson, if you and Maria and all your daughters will listen to me, I will give you a short sketch of the history of Peru." The three girls stood up and said, Oh, Mr. Rus- sell, how happy we feel to hear you talk about telling history!" "Well, girls, I will endeavor to tell you a little history now. Peru is one of the richest countries in the world, of its size. It abounds in gold, silver, quicksilver, copper, iron and lead; and diamonds are found in abundance. Now, my dear girls, and Mrs. Robertson, I want you to take particular notice of all I say, so that you will be able to relate it. Peru abounds in hills and mountains, valleys and plains; in those plains there are rapid streams that come down from the mountains; this water forms many channels in the plains.  The reason why it forms so many channels, is because the plains are made up with different kinds of soil, and there is one kind of soil on those plains that is called the quick- sand. This quicksand is easier moved by the cur- rents of water than any other soil, consequently, the 8  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7685-00000088"/> 1 :0      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF abater passing down from the mountains with such force, it follows the quicksand, and forms crooked streams. In those crooked streams is where they obtain the richest diamonds. "Now, Mrs. Robertson, I want you to take partic- ular notice of what I say. On those crooked streams they form sheds to work under, for the sun is very hot in that country; they work side by side in the water, and grapple for thile diamonds, aknd when they work many months on one of those crooked streams and find no diamonds, they then leave cit, and call it a ' dash.' Then they move from there and pitchl their sheds oil another place. In this place they may find many valuable diamonds, and when they do this, they call it a ' pearl of great price.' Now, Mrs. Rob- ertson, I leave given you a short sketch of Peru. If I was to give you the whole history of Peru, it would take me several evenings to tell it, but I merely give you this short sketch, to show you what a situation I am placed in, and how I have been placed this last three years and better. I might truly be represented as the slave of Peru, working on the crooked streams. -not only working a month or two, as the slaves do, but I have worked better that three years on a crooked stream, and, indeed, it has proved a ' dash' unto me. It has dashed my noble heart into pieces, so that I fear it will not recover again in a long time, and 1 fear I shall not be like the poor slave, to obtain the 'pearl of great price' at last." Mrs. Robertson said,-"Mr. Russell, you are ele- gant in every part of history. You explain it so clearly that every one can understand you. Indeed,   DAVID RUSSELL.        1 7 Mr. Russell, you are a blessing to the woman th , bore you, and a credit to all mankind, for you har,: got such a mind, and can retain things so long." After this we read a chapter, went to prayer, and retired to bed. Early the next morning, I arose, as usual, at four o'clock. I washed and dressed my- self. I sat down in my room, and meditated o i things that had passed. I then knelt down by m-y bedside, and went to prayer. I lifted up my voice to the Almighty; I thanked him   for his protectioni through the past night;--"I pray, most merciful God, that thou would guide me through this day. and the remaining part of my life, and show me the way I ought to go, and teach me the way. Oh, Lord, thou knowest my heart and desire, and thou knowest my thoughts; thou knowest the situation that I anm placed in.  Oh, God, forbid the tempter should lead me astray at this time, for I am as a pilgrim travel- ing through a strange country, without a shepherd or a guide.  Oh, Almighty and most merciful God, wilt thou guide me into all truth, and at last guide me into thy kingdom; all these mercies and bless- ings I ask, for the dear Redeemer's sake.  Amen, ameln!'" I then went down   stairs to breakfast; it being ready, we were all invited in. I said, " good-morn- ing, Mr. and Mrs. Robertson, and all the girls, and how do you all do this morning?" They all observed tihey were well, and inquired, ' How do you do, Mr. Russell, yourself?" "I feel well in my bodily health, but my spirit is very low."  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7685-00000089"/> 172      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF Mr. Russell, you must not let your spirits go down, for you know that it is the spirit that rules the body, and if you let your spirit go down, of course you will get sick; and if you continue to let your spirits down, your body will sink under it. That was the whole cause of Priscilla's death, for she let her spirits go down directly after you left, and never had her spirits up till you came back. So, Mr. Russell, let me exhort you to cheer up and be lively, for you know what David of old said, that he could not bring his son to him, but he might go to his son; and it is so with you, you cannot bring her to you, but you may go to her. So, I say, Mr. Russell, once more, for you to cheer up and be lively as you once was, for you make us all feel bad about you." "Mrs. Robertson, it is hard for this weak body to cheer up when it is pressed down; I know what you say is very correct and very true, and I feel ten thousand times obliged to you for your kindness to me, and your good advice. But, Mrs. Robertson, you know that every heart knows its own sorrow and grief. Mrs. Robertson, we may sympathise with one another, which is our duty to do, and comfort them. It makes me think of one of old, the Patriarch Job, when he cried out in the bitterness of his grief, ' O, that my grief was weighed in the balances, for it could not be estimated!'" I then left them all and went into my sitting-room alone. I sat down and meditated on what I should do, and asked advice from the Almighty. I had not been there long before Maria came up into the room.   DAVID RUSSELL.       173 She said, "Mr. Russell, ma says she don't like for you to be alone, and she told me to come up and talk with you." "Maria, my dear, your mother is a kind woman, indeed, and your father is a very kind man, and yourself and your two sisters are very kind, indeed. The kindness I have received here I never shall for- get if I should live a thousand years. In fact, I must say I never was treated better in my life than I have been in England." "Now, Mr. Russell, I want you to tell-me one thing,' on your word and honor." "Maria, if I pledge my honor, I will go through fire and water before I will break it." "I know that, Mr. Russell, it has been proved." "Now, Maria, it depends entirely on what you are going to ask me, for it may not be reasonable or pos- sible for me to perform." "Oh, yes, Mr. Russell, I would not ask you any thing that you could not perform." "Well, Maria, my dear, what is it?" "Mr. Russell, I want you to pledge your word and honor that you will take up with pa's offer." "Maria, my dear, what is your pa's offer?" "Mr. Russell, I supposed he had told you, but I will tell you it again. He says that if you are will- ing, he will take you in as equal partner with him, and will give you half of all that is made in the business, and will give you many presents." "Maria, as for pledging my word and honor on those things at present, it is what I could not do, for I have not made up my mind what I am going to do;  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7685-00000090"/> 174      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF but I pledge my word honor to one thing, Maria; that is if I stay in England, I will take up with your father's offer." "Why, Mr. Russell, I think you could do no bet- ter than stay in England, for you have many friends, more than you are aware of." "Well, Maria, I cannot tell you any thing at present, for I don't know myself what I am going to do." "Why, Mr. Russell, I don't see why you can't make up your mind now.  *  After I had traveled, and examined most of the principal towns in England, and all the machinery, and any thing of note, I then made up my mind to go to the Isle of Wight. It was an island that laid off from England a short distance, and it belonged to England. I told Mr. Robertson one day that I thought I would go to the Isle of Wight, for I heard so much talk about it and I never saw it. "Well, Mr. Russell," he remarked, "it seems that you are determined to leave us, but if you like I will go with you, if you will come back, for I don't want you to miss seeing any thing, and 1 don't want you to leave England." "Well, Mr. Robertson, I have made up my mind never to come to England any more, but that I would travel like a wandering pilgrim the rest part of my life, in different parts of the world. I thought I would go from here to the Isle of Wight, and after I have examined the Isle of Wight and seen it all through, I would go to Southampton or Portsmouth, and take ship for the West Indies. Fromn there I   DAVID RUSSELL.        175 would go to the East Indies, and from the East Indies I would go to Paris; from Paris I would go to Rome, and when I got in Rome I would travel through all the principal towns in Italy. I would go to Palmyra, Messina and Sicily. I would then take ship and follow up the Mediterranean sea and visit all the towns as I went up. I would visit Malta and Gib- raltar, Minorca and Majorca, and every town of any note I would visit. I would pass through the great desert of Arabia and go to Egypt.  After I had visited Egypt I would go to Jerusalem and the Holy Land, to Mount Calvary and the river Jordan, and every place of any note. This is part of the travel, Mr. Robertson, that I calculate going through, if it is the will of the Almighty that I should go, and if he will prosper me in my journey." "Why, Mr. Russell, this is a great undertaking, indeed, such a long journey as that!" "Yes, Mr. Robertson, I know it is a great under- taking; but if it is the will of the Almighty I shall certainly go, and I shall pray to Him that He will guide and protect me" in all perils and dangers, by sea and land, and bring me safe back to my own country." "Well, Mr. Russell, I see your mind is not settled." "No, Mr. Robertson, and I am afraid it never will be again, for this is a heavy stroke on me, in- deed. "Well, Mr. Russell, I think there is no other way for you to do but cheer up your spirits, and not let  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7685-00000091"/> 176      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF these things take such an effect on you, for it is not right in the sight of God that we should murmur." "I know, Mr. Robertson, what you say is very true; but we poor mortal creatures are frail and liable: to err and go astray, for there is none of us perfect. But still I have no doubt but what there will be good come out of this, sooner or later, for the Almight5 doeth all things well and right; and I have no doubt but what it will come out right; but those things are withheld from us, for we can't see in futurity. During serious thoughts that I have been taking these many nights and many days, some- thing tells me we ought not to be sorry as men with- out hope, as the apostle Paul says-the great apostle of the Gentiles, 'Rejoice ye in all things, giving praise and glory to God in whatsoever he doeth, for he doeth all things well, and His will be done.' "Now, Mr. Robertson, when I come to study it over seriously, as I have these last few days, and read the Bible, I see I am doing wrong. When we look at the apostles and see the way they took trouble; in the midst of trouble,' they praised God, and sung praises unto God, and rejoiced exceedingly, and gave thanks to him in all things and for all things. Now, Mr. Robertson, from this hour I am going to throw off this sackcloth of ashes and mourning, and I am, going to rejoice in God my Saviour, for she whom I once loved is ten thousand times happier than I could have made her if I had married her; for this cause I ought to rejoice rather than moiurn, to think she is entered into the world of bliss, praising God and the Lamb forever, that Lamb that was slain for her and    DAVID RUSSELL.       1" all that will believe in Him. Now, Mr. Robertson, I have studied deep into those things, and these are my views on the subject, and this is the course that I am going to take from this hour." "Now, Mr. Russell, you talk like a man, for that is my view of the subject. Well, Mr. Russell, there is some hopes of you now. I really feared that you would go astray if you continue on, and now I hope you will stay with us in England. I don't want to stop you from going to the Isle of Wight if you think proper to go, and myself and my daughter will go with you, if you think you will come back to Lon- don."  "Well, Mr. Robertson, I should like to have you and your dauglter go with me to the Isle of Wight, but as to think about coming back to London, it is a thing I cannot do." 'When do you think you will leave, Mr. Rus- sell?" "I shall leave in a few days for the Isle of Wight." Mr. Robertson then went and told his family about it. Mrs. Robertson and the girls came to me, and Mrs. Robertson said, "Mr. Russell, do let me beg and pray of you not to leave us! What is your reason for leaving England?" ' Mrs. Robertson, I want to travel a little more, for I want to see different parts of the world that I have not seen." "Well, Mr. Russell, do you really think you will leave us?" "Yes, ma'am, I shall leave you in a few days, if it is the Lord's will." 8*  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7685-00000092"/> 178      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF "Well, you are only going to the Isle of Wight." Yes, ma'am, 'there is where I am going first, but I shall only stay there a few days." "Well, Mr. Russell, I am sorry to have you leave us, and I do think you would do better to stay." "Well, that may be," I replied, " but something tells me that I must travel and see more of the world, and as I have no one but myself, and I am one alone in this wide world, having no one to mourn or grieve about me." "Well, Mr. Russell, it is a pity that a young man like you should wander around the world so." "Mrs. Robertson, I came to England with the ex- press purpose of settling down, but it seems it was not the will of the Almighty that I should do so." "Oh, Mr. Russell, try again; don't give up that way!" "Well, Mrs. Robertson, I know it is not right to give up that way, but I am anxious to travel and see more of the worlds I have had several disappoint- ments in England; I have tried hard to get a wife in England; but it seems I am not permitted to get married here." "Oh, fie, Mr. Russell, you don't know what you can do." "No, Mrs. Robertson, I shall never try in England again. I shall leave for Portsmouth tomorrow, and from there I shall go across to the Isle of Wight." "You will go and bid your friends farewell before you leave?"   DAVID RUSSELL.       179 "Yes, ma'am, I am  going immediately to Mr. Jackson's, and from there to Mr. Brown's." I then went to Mr. Jackson's; saw himself, and his wife, and his daughters. "Well," said I, "Mr. Jackson, I am come to bid you farewell, for I am about to leave England, and I never expect to see it any more." "Oh, Mr. Russell, I am sorry to have you go; I was in hopes you were going to stay with us. Is there no one that can prevail on you to stay?" "No, sir, no one can prevail on me, for I have made up my mind to travel, and I shall take my passage early tomorrow for Portsmouth, and from there to the Isle of Wight; so I shall bid you all farewell." I then took a hearty shake of hands with them all, and said,-' I hope the God of heaven will bless you, and will guide and protect you, and will receive you into his kingdom at last, for the dear Redeemer's sake. Amen, amen." I then left them, and I saw the tears trickle down their cheelks in streams. I next went to Mr. Brown's. When I got there Mr. Brown and his family were all sitting in the parlor. As I entered, I said, -"Good evening, Mr. Brown, and all the family." "Why, Mr. Russell, we were just talking about yolu."'  "Well, Mr. Brown, I have not got long to stay, for I am come to bid you my last farewell, as I have to leave for Portsmouth, in the four o'cleck stage in the morning."

"Yes, Mr. Brown, I thought when I came I should stay in London, and perhaps end my days in Eng- land, but it seems that we don't know what a day may bring forth. Man is tossed about like the bil- lows on the ocean." "Yes, Mr. Russell, that is a true saying, indeed." "Well, Mr. Brown, I shall have to bid you and all your family farewell, and may the God of heaven bless you and all your family, and guide you into all truth, and at last[ receive you into his heavenly king- dom, for the dear Redeemer's sake. Amen." I then bid them farewell, and they all wept. The tears trickled down Mr. Brown's cheek, when I bid him my last farewell., I then went back to Mr. Rob- ertson's. After bidding the family good-evening, I informed them that I was going to leave in the morn- ing, at four o'clock; that I had just bid Mr. Jack- son's and Mr. Brown's folks farewell. Mrs. Robertson then said,--"Mr. Russell, have, you any respect for me?" "Yes, I love and respect you as my own mother." -"Then why do you not listen to me?" "Why, Mrs. Robertson, it is not that I don't-love and respect you, that I am about to leave you, but it is a journey I have to take, and the sooner I com- mence it the biter." "My advice to you is," she replied, ' not to go, but stay here. You don't know what perils and dan- gers you may have to go through in traveling that journey." fn   DAVID RUSSELL.       181 "I know that I have gone through a great many dangers, and I expect to go through a great many more, Mrs. Robertson." "Well, Mr. Russell, you might avoid a great many dangers, if you would stay where you are." Mr. Robertson said,--"Well, Mr. Russell, I feel heart sorry that I can't prevail on you to stay." "And if things were not the way they are, I should feel happy to stay," I replied, "but as they are, I have made up my mind to go, and the sooner I get away the better, for I ought to be on my journey." I then sent a note to the stage-office for the stage to call for me at four o'clock. While seated in the parlor, Maria came and sat alongside of me. She observed, "Mr. Russell, I want to know if you have any respect for me?" "Maria, have I ever shown you any disrespect?" "No, Mr. Russell, you have not; only at this time you won't listen to me." "Maria, my dear Maria, have I not told you the whole truth? You know I love and respect you and all your folks." She then said, "Mr. Russell, I never shall be happy if you go away!" "Well, my dear, I am sorry to make any one un- happy, but have I ever given you any reason to have any claim on me?" "No, Mr. Russell, I have no claim on you, but I wish I had. If I had a claim on you, I know I could prevail on you to stay, for I know you are a gentle- man of too much honor to deceive any one, particu- larly a young lady."'  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7685-00000094"/> 182      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF- "Well, Maria, I have but a short time to stay, and I want you now to understand what I say to you, and acknowledge to what is right. Maria, have I ever deceived/' you at any time, by word or deed? Have I not offered fair and honorable to your parents and to you? Have I not offered to make you my lawful and wedded wife? Have they not utterly refused me of you. Now, Maria, have I not done my duty in every respect?" "Yes, Mr. Russell,-I have not a word to say against you, for -you have offered fair and like an honorable gentleman, and had my parents as much feeling for me as you have, it would be all right enough, and we would be no longer two, but one." "Maria, I asked you this, that in case any thing should happen when I am far away, I can show a clear receipt of my innocence with your own signa- ture to it." She then signed her name to a statement I had written.  In due time the stage drove up. I shook hands with them all, and bid them farewell. I ad- dressed Mr. Robertson and his family: "I feel at this time I am about leaving the very best friends that I ever had in my life-friends that have treated me as kind as ever my own parents treated me--friends that I would lay my own life down  for, to do them a kindness-friends that I never shall forget as long as the Almighty gives me breath.

DAVID RUSSELL.       183 May He guide you into his kingdom, at last, for the dear Redeemer's sake. Amen, amen." I then embraced Maria, and she wept over me, and they all wept. I then got in Uthe stage, and that night was landed safe in Portsmouth. I put up at the "Plume and Feathers" inn. I was invited into a splendid room, and from there soon went to supper. After supper we sat down in the sitting-room. The landlord asked me if I was a native of London. I told him I was not. He observed, "You don't talk like the cockneys." Shortly afterwards I retired to my room, and went to bed. -Ic  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7685-00000095"/> 184       AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF CHAPTER VI.

EARLY next morning I arose as usual and took break- fast; after which I settled my bill and went down im  mediately to the Navy Yard and examined it all over. I examined all over Portsmouth, went into all the shops and factories of any note, and took sketch- es of every thing of any account. I then went on board the packet that run to the Isle of Wight and took passage. We landed in about four hours after we started; the pier that we landed at extended a great way out in the sea; it was a solid pier, built of stone. I was taken up to the "Red Lion" inn; there I put up for the night. After I was there a short time I was invited in to supper, after which I soon retired to bed. I asked the landlord, before I retired to bed, how far it was to Newport? He told me it was about twenty miles. I 'asked him if there was any conveyance to New- port? He said there was a stage that would be going there about four o'clock in the morning.   DAVID RUSSELL.       185 I told him that I wanted to go to Newport, and I wished him to have me awoke about half-past three o'clock, so that I might have timq to get ready. I was woke up about half-past three o'clock; I then got up, washed and dressed, and got ready for the stage. About four o'clock the stage drove up; and there were several passengers got out and stopped at the inn, which gave plenty of room for more passen- gers. I got aboard the stage, and it drove off. We land- ed in Newport in about three hours, and put up at the "Globe " inn. I told the landlord I wanted breakfast. I afterwards asked the landlord if there was any conveyance through the island, telling him I wanted a carriage for a few days. He replied that he could furnish me with a car- riage. I then examined the town all over, and I found it to be a nice little town, with very few manu- factories. I examined every thing in the town of any note. The town was compactly built, with beautiful dwellings, and all in good order. I came back to the "Globe " again and took dinner, after which I hired the carriage and driver by the day, and started for the town of Allenton, which lay in a valley surround- ed with hills. All around it, on those hills, there were thousands and thousands of sheep grazing, and a great many cattle and some horses. I put up at the "Cross Keys " inn; the landlord was a fat, red face man, and looked as if he had never seen any banyan days. I asked the landlord how far it was to the town of Sanddown.  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7685-00000096"/> 186      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF He said it was about fifteen miles. I told him I would stop with him all night, and I should want plenty to eat for myself and man, and plenty good feed for my horse, and he must be well cleaned. I went in the house with the landlord and sat down. I asked the landlord what was the pro- ducts of the island. He told me they raised wheat, barley, oats, rye, peas, beans, turnips and garden truck of every kind, and fruit of almost every kind. I took a glass of elderberry wine, and we were invited into supper. We had an excellent supper, indeed. I sat a while without eating. The landlord sat at one end of the table and the landlady at the other, while a waiter stood on each side. The landlord asked me what I wished? I asked him where my man was ; that I was wait- ing for him. "What! do you have your servants sit down with you!" "Yes, sir, I do; he is as good as I am; and I, as an American, want all to have their freedom' and rights!" He was then brought in and sat down. After supper we retired into the parlor, and the old gentle- man asked me questions about America. I told him America was a fine country, fertile and fruitful, producing grain of all kinds, and fruit of all -kinds; with rice, cotton, sugar, tobacco, hemp and flax. Said the landlord, "Can you raise all those things!"  "Yes," said I, " and a great deal more than that;   DAVID RUSSELL.      187 we can raise oranges, lemons, cocoanuts, pine apples, banannas, and tea and coffee if we want to." F "Why, Mr. Russell, I did not know you could raise all those things in America; it must be a fine country!" "Yes, sir, it is a fine country, indeed; there is no better country in the world!" It now began to get late, and I said to the land- lord, "I feel tired, and I believe I will retire to bed." "Don't you want some supper?" he inquired. I told him I had had my supper. "O, well," said he, "we always take a snack and some wine before going to bed." "Well, sir, I will join you." After we took our snack and wine I retired to bed. Early next morning when I arose, I sent my man to have his horse taken care of, telling him to be ready to start as soon as breakfast was over. We had our breakfast early, after which the carriage was brought up. I settled with the landlord and shook hands with him, when he said, "Young man, you are a joyful fellow, and good company; I would like to have you call again." "Well, landlord, how long will it take me to go around the island, and do justice to my horse and myself?" He allowed I would be back to Newport tomorrow night. I told my man to push through, as I wanted to get back to Newport tomorrow night. We went along pretty lively, and I took notice of all the gar- dens and orchards, and every thing of interest. We reached Saiddown and took an early dinner.  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7685-00000097"/> 188      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF We started again, and went to the extreme point of the island and put up at a country tavern, where " we took supper. After supper we sat a little while and then went to bed. In coming through that route I saw some of the finest and largest fruit trees that I ever saw in my life. We arose early next morning, took breakfast, and started for Newport on a Northern route. The first town we stopped at was called (owes. We stopped a little while to water and rest our horse. We then drove on and passed many beautiful chalk pits; at length we arrived at a place-called Wooden Bridge, where we stopped to take dinner and feed our horse. -After tarrying about one hour, we started for New- port, where we arrived, about seven o'clock that even- ing.  The landlord said he was glad we got back, and asked me how I liked the island? I told him I liked it very well, and I thought it was a fine, fertile island, bearing splendid fruit of all kinds. I was then invited in to supper, and after- ward retired to the sitting-room. The landlord came in and sat down along side of me. I asked him what time the stage passed for Ride. He said about four o'clock in the morning. I told him I wished him to wake me up about half past three o'clock, so that I could be ready when the stage came along. I then retired to bed. At the appointed time he woke me up; I washed and dressed myself, settled all, my bills, and by that time the stage drove up. There were several passen-   DAVID RUSSELL.       189 gers got out and stopped at Newport. I then got my trunks and myself aboard, and we started for Ride, the place where I first landed. I there had break- fast, settled my bill, and took the boat for Southamp- ton, where we arrived in about four hours after we started. I put up at "Nelson's Arm's" inn, one of the largest inns in Southampton. I told the landlord I wanted to stay with him, a few days. He invited me into the sitting-room, where I sat down a little while. I then walked out on the porch; as I was walking backwards and forwards, there was a hack drove up to the door. I stood waiting to see who was in the hack, and to my astonishment, Mr. Robertson and his daughter Maria stept ouat. The moment they saw me they walked up on the porch to-me. They invited me up into their room, where we all sat down on the sofa, Maria got up, took off her bonnet and shawl, and sat down again by my side; she threw her arms around my neck and embraced me, saying, "Now, Mr. Rus- sell, I will never let you leave me as long as you live!" "Well, my dear Maria, I don't want to leave you."  "Mr. Russell, I know you don't, for I know you love me." "Yes, Maria, I love you as my own soul, and always have, from the very first time I saw you." Her father then said, I think it will do Maria good to travel." s' Yes, sir, I believe it would, in one sense of the  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7685-00000098"/> 190      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF word," I replied, " but in another it would do her harm.' "How do you mean it would do her harm? I don't understand." "Well, my meaning is very easy understood when it is explained. Now, Mr. Robertson, you know that Maria is wonderfully attached tome at this present- time, and every day she is with me she will become- more attached to me; now, you see, Mr. Robertson, she will not allow me out of her sight, and wherever I go she is determined to go with me. Now, Mr. Robertson, God forbid that I should do any thing to injure you or your family, and for that reason let me give you my advice on the subject. My advice to you is this, and it is what I would say if it was my own child; it is for you to either let her marry or take her home."   . ' Don't you wantto0 travel with her?" he asked. "Yes, Mr. Robertson, I will travel with her to the ends of the earth!" Maria then said, "My dear Mr. Russell, when will you be ready to go with me?" "Any time, Maria, any time when you are ready I am at your service." "Well, pa, I want to go in a day or two."  At this Maria said, "' Come, Mr. Russell, into my sit- ting-room." I then went in and sat down; she rung the bell and ordered refreshments to be brought up, and we took some wine and cake. She said, "' Mr. Russell, how happy do I feel since I have seen you. We have !    DAVID liuob^.u. been here two or three days looking for you, and I feel so happy that we found you!" "Well, Maria, I feel happy to see you al$ be in your company." "When you went away,' she continued, "I told my ma and pa that you loved me, and your love was true- and honorable." "Maria, I am willing to do all that I told you, at any time or moment that your father is willing." Soon after this we prepared to go to Cork. We engaged passage for three, in a ship to sail from Southampton for Cork in four -or five days after- wards. We all went on board, and she put to sea. She went through the channel called the Needles, between the Isle of Wight and the main land of England; we then sailed down the English channel, then struck across to the Irish channel. We sailed a few days and then struck into the cove of Cork; we 1hen sailed up the Cork harbor, where the ship came to anchor. The passengers were landed, and we put up at an inn called the "Prince William." We stayed there one day. We then took stage for Dub- lin. We drove through a very pleasant country, con- taining beautiful parks and gardens, and at length arrived at Dublin. The stage drove up to the "Rising Sun" inn, and the landlord met us at the stage. He said to the driver, "; You are here early this morning.1" He thenr invited the passengers into the 'house.  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7685-00000099"/> 192      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF Soon he came to me and asked if I was an American. I asked what made him think I was an American? "Why, sir, you talk and act just like an Amner- ican." Said I, "Was you ever in America?" "Yes, sir, I have been in America." "What part of America was you in?" He said he had been in New York, Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and many other places that he did not recollect. "How do you like America?"I inquired. "I like it well, sir; it is a fine country." At this time Maria sent for me to come to her room. She said, "Mr. Russell, I want, as soon as we can get ready after breakfast, to go around the city in the carriage and see it." "Well, my dear Maria, I must go and get a car- riage." "I wish you would," she replied, " for I don't want to stay long in this city." I then went down and, asked the landlord if he could accommodate me with a carriage or hack to go around and see the city? He said he could, and furnish me with a driver that would show me all parts of the city. Accordingly, as quick as we got our breakfast, the carriage was ready. - We all got in and he drove us around to all the places of note, and he then drove us back again to the inn. Dublin is a very pleasant city, situated on a very pleasant rise of ground, and there are beautiful valleys and fields, well cultivated,   DAVID RUSSELL.       193 with beautiful scenery, parks and gardens, and splen- did country seats. Maria said, "i Mr. Russell, I have seen all I want to see in Dublin." "Well, my dearl Maria, where will you go,next?" "Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, I should like to go to Edinburgh, in Scotland, for I have heard so much talk about it I should like to see it." "Well, Maria, my dear, wherever you want to go I will take you; as I said before, I will go and see your pa, and hearlwhat he says, and then I will make preparations for the journey." I said to Mr. Robertson, "Maria wishes to go to Edinburgh, in Scotland." "Well, Mr. Russell, I don't know what to say about that, for I ought to go home, and must go home, for I have been away a long time, and now lly business calls me home."' "Well, Mr. Robertson, you Iliad better go and talk with your daughter about it, for she is very anx-, ious to see Edinburgh." Accordingly' we went to Maria's room, and he addressed her thus,-"Maria, my -dear child, we must go home."   ^ Said she, "Pa, I shall never go home, unless Mr. Russell goes home with us." "Maria, my dear child, what will your mother think of us staying away so long? Every letter I get she writes for us to come home immediately.". "Well, pa, I shall not go home, unless Mr. Russell goes home with us." I then said; "Now, Mr. Robertson, I see plainly that i                , ';   &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7685-00000100"/> 194      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF there is nothing but trouble ahead, and sorrow anc grief, and that yout will find out when it is too late now it can all be avoided. fMr. Robertson, I wanl you to understand what I am going to say, in the presence of your daughter." I then handed Maria a sheet of paper and i pen and ink, saying, "I want you to write down al I say, and after it is written, I want yon and you] father to sign it, and I shall sign it also: "Mr. Robertson, having loved your daughter as  love myself, and seeing the difficulty that awaits botl her and you, and all the family, now, Mr. Robert son, I shall make you one more offer, and it i: the last ofer that ever I shall make you ; was it no for the unboundedc love that I have for your daughte: and the affectionate feeling, and knowing what await her, I would not make the offer.

Now, Mr. Robertson, I have made you this offer, and I would wish you to accept it; but if yo do not accept it, I, this day, in the presence of the Almighty God, and in the presence of you and your daughter, do solemnly declare that I am inno- cent of any thing that shall occur hereafter." "Well, Mr. Russell, I never can agree to thaV.' E Well, then, Mr. Robertson, I want you and your daughter to sign -your names as witnesses to my sig- -tature." "Oh, yes, Mr. Russell, we will do that..' And they attached their names to my proposition. Maria then said, "Now, pa, Mr. Russell has offer- ed every thing that a gentleman could offer to make me happy, and you and ma and all my sisters happy, but it seems you are determined not to accept his offer; also, you are determined to make me miser- able through your unkind treatment to me. You will throw me into the decline in my youth, and I shall-pine away and die in my youth.' Had you half as much love for me as Mr. Russell, you would ac- cept his offer immediately and comply with his re- quest, knowing what awaits me and the misery that you will bring on yourself and family. Now, pa, this is the second time that Mr. Russell has made this kind offer to you and me, and there are very few men that would do this. Now, pa, my advice to you is this, if in case you don't think proper to let me marry Mr. Russell, leave me here and don't take me home; for it will be no home for me, for I shall be miserable all the rest part of my life."

"O1l, no, my dear, I cannot go home without youi.  , "Well, now, pa, why don"t you grant me my re- quest and you go with us? As I have never been out from home before, now I am out I want to see some little of the world." "Well, I'll think of it!" and he then left her. At this she embraced me and wept aloud, exclaim- ing, "Oh, Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, what shall I do? Don't you leave me T" "Maria- I don't wish to leave you; you know I have done all that lays in my power to have you with me, and to make you happy; but it seems that your father is determined to make you miserable, for he don't listen to a word I say to him. He is determined to 'have, his own way, at the risk of all our happi- ness; so, now, my dear Maria, you must never think hard of me, and if you have any thing on your mind that you think I have done wrong, I want you to tell me."  "No, Mr. Russell, I cannot say any thing that you have done wrong since ever I knew you, but you have always treated me with the highest respect, dignity, honor and kindness."

In a few. days afterwards, Mr. Robertson came to me and said, "Mr. Russell, I have concluded to go to Edinburgh." "Well, Mr. Robertson, I will go immediately and engage the passage." I called up a hack. Maria was looking out of the window, and seeing me call the hack- she rapped, at the window, and I went up to see what she wanted. Said I, "Maria, my dear, what do you want?" "Oh, Mr. Russell, you are not going away?" "No, Maria, I am not going far." ' Where are you going?" 'c I am going, my dear, to engage a passage for you and your pa, and myself,to go to Edinburgh."

I told the driver to take us down to the quay, where the packet was that went from there to Edin- burgh. Accordingly he drove down to the packet. I asked Maria if she would go on board or sit still in the hack. She said she would remain in the hack till I came back. I then got out and went on board of the packet. I inquired for the captain, and while I was talking the captain came 'up out of the cabin. I asked him if he sailed to Edinburgh. He said he did. I then told him I wanted to engage a passage for two gentlemen and one lady. Well, sir," said he, "I can let you have it; will you come down and look at the berths?" I then went down to look at the berths. I engaged a berth for myself, one for Mr. Robertson, and one of the ,very best for Maria, and then entered all our names. The captain asked me where I stopped. I told him at the "Rising Sun." I then asked him when he' would leave ,for Edin- burgh. He said in about three hours, and he would send his-'bus around, to all the hotels foir the pas- sengers. I got into the hack again, and we drove around the   DAVID RUSSELL.       199 city. Maria observed, "My dear Mr. Russell, how happy would I feel if I could go with you." "Yes, Maria, my dear, I would feel happy to have you along with me, but it seems, my dear Maria, you are not permitted to have a young American." "Well, my dear Mr. Russell, if I don't get you I shall never marry." "Maria, I am willing and ready for you to have me at any time, and if you were of age I would have you at any rate; You know the law of this country is, that if you are under age, you are under your parents, for that reason I am not allowed to marry you unless your parents are willing." "I know, Mr. Russell, that is the law of England, but if I was of age I would marry before ever I went to London." By this time the hack drove up to the hotel, and we went into the sitting-room up stairs. Mr. Robert- son came into the room soon after, and I told him that I had engaged the passage for us three; that the carriage would be here in about two hours for us, and I wished all to be ready. "Well, Mr. Russell," he replied, "you dispatch business quick; you are a smart, active young man, indeed." "Yes, Mr. Robertson, it don't take me a week to do what can be done in an hour." After a while the hack drove up for the passengers; we settled our bill, got into the hack and drove to the packet. In about one hour after we got on board, -the vessel left for Edinburgh.

After supper, myself and Mr. Rob- ertson and his daughter retired to our sitting-room. I said, "My dear Maria, this is the' city that you wanted to see and talked.'so much about. Now, my dear, what time will you be ready in the morning that I may have a carriage ready for you." "Oh, Mr. Russell, how kind you are to me; I never was better treated in my life than I have been with you; nothing seems a trouble to you; you do all with a cheerful countenance and a cheerful heart, and, Mr. Russell, in the presence of my father, I do say that I -wish it was my happy lot to be permitted to end my days with you, for I tould be happy with you with a cup of cold water and a crust of bread; but it seems that my father is not willing that I should be happy, but I must die miserable and broken- hearted. He may force me back, but he will not have me long to behold, only as a lifeless corpse.? She then left the room and wept aloud. She told me she would be ready early in the mornling, as quick as she got her breakfast; she also told her father she wanted to go with me alone, as she had business with me. After breakfast the carriage drove up; I asked the driver if he was acquainted with the city? He said he was acquainted with it all over. "Well," said I, " you are the very man that we- want. Now, sir, we want you to show us every part of it of any note, for though we came from Dublin here, we have come from London to see this city; so, now, sir, we want you to show us every part of   DAVID RUSSELL.       201 any note." He then drove us around the city to every place of note, and, certainly, it is a most splendid city. It is situated on a side hill, and the houses. are built nearly of one height; they are twelve and fifteen stories high in front; and the parks, gardens and scenery are splendid to behold. There are many beautiful country seats around the city. I asked the driver if he knew of a good artist. He said he knew the best that was in the city. "Well, sir," I replied, " that is the very one I want; drive me there, if you please." Accordingly he drove us up to an establishment, where' I rung the bell, and we were inited into a sitting-room. I asked to be shown some lockets. We looked at a slmall one with two persons' likeness- es in it. I inquired if they could be taken any smaller thal that? and was informed they could no't. '"Well,' said I, ' I want two gold lockets, both of one size, and I want both our likenesses taken twice." We sat down together, and took each other by the hand, when lie took 'both our likenesses in a most correct manner. After they were properly fixed for me, I went to the jeweller's and got two very hand- some gold chains for them. "Now, Maria," said I, "here is one, and when we are about to part you may hand me yours and I shall hand you mine, as a token of remembrance of our love, and when I am far away you can look on it and think of me, and I can do the same with yours."

' Yes, sir," I replied, " it takes a good while to go all around a city like this, arnd examine every thing mi nutely., , When we had all sat down together in the sitting- room, Mr. Robertson said,' Now, Maria, my dear, you have seen all you want to see of Edinburgh, and I want you to be ready tomorrow to go home." She said, "Pa, I never can leave Mr. Russell; the longer I am with him I am the' more attached to him and the better I like him. Now, pa, let me ex- hort you to allow me to have Mr. Russell for my law- ful husband, for he is the only manl that I ever did love or ever shall love, and if you have any regard for me you will grant my request; and if you don't, you will not have me long to behold, unless you behold me a lifeless, corpse. My dear father, you have no one to blame but yourself for any trouble that shall come hereafter, for you are the cause of it all. Now, father, you nmust never blame Mr. Russell for any thing that shall occur' hereafter, for he is in- nocent and willing to do right, but you will not allow him:'  "Well, Mr. Robertson," I chimed in, "I ha-ve al- ready told you what I would do, and there is no use of rehearsing it over."  "Mr. Russell," replied the old gentleman, " 1 have one thing to say; you may marry Maria tomor- row morning, if you will agree to what I have to say.

"Mr. Robertson, I thank you for your kind offer, but it is impossible for me to accept it. - As an Amer- ican, I would rather have my freedom than all the riches in the. world; and as for being tied to one place, I could never think of it. It seems, Maria, that you and me cannot get married, and there is no use of thinking any more about it. Hshall now pre- pare to take my passage for the West Indies in a few days." "Well, Maria," said Mr. Robertson, " we will start for London tomorrow; there is a vessel going to London from here, which sails about ten o'clock, and I shall go right down and engage our passage." HeAthen went down and engaged passage for two. The next morning, after breakfast, they prepared to go to the vessel. The hack drove up and we all got in and went down to the vessel. I wcent aboard with them. I said to Maria and Mr. Robertson, "I now bid you farewell!" I took Maria by the hand, and continued, " now, Maria, it seems impossible for you and I to get married, so now I bid you my last farewell, for I never expect to see you again on this side of eternity." I then took from my pocket the gold locket and handed it to her, observing, 4 Maria, when you look on this token of honor, you will think of me when I am far away." She put her hand in her pocket and handed me  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7685-00000105"/> 204      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF also a gold locket, saying, "Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, when you look on this, never, never for- get your dear Maria, one that loved you as her own soul!" "Well, Maria, I love you, also, as my own soul, and shall as long as I live; and if I could marry you as a free man, and not as a slave, I would marry you this hour. Now, Mr. Robertson and Maria, I bid you both farewell, and may God Almighty bless you both, and may he guide and protect you from all perils and danger, and guide you into all truth, and at last re- ceive you into His kingdom, for the dear Redeemer's sake, amen, amen." I then embraced her, and we' beheld each other for the last time. I then went back to the hotel, and early next morning I went down and took passage on the brig "Ann Maria," for Barbadoes, West Indies. I settled with the landlord, got my truliks put on board the brig, and early the next morning she left for the West Indies.   DAVID RUSSELL.        205 CHAPTER VII.

WE had a pleasant passage, and in four weeks we landed safe in Barbadoes. I examined the island all over, and found a great part of it to be low land and very fertile, growing cotton, sugar, coffee, corn and fruits of all kinds. After staying there a short time, I took passage to the island of Martinique. In a few days we landed safe, and I examined the island all over. I found a good part of it to be barren and rocky land, and part of it was very fertile; the products were the same as in Barbadoes. I then crossed over to St. Kitt's; examined it as the others, and found it to be much the same. I then took ship for Antigua, or the English Harbor, and in a few days we arrived safe; I found in that island one of the best harbors in the West Indies; it was land-locked all around, so that when a vessel got in it could ride the hurricane for months without any danger. I examined the island all over,-and I found it much the same as the others,with some very high and barren land, and some very fertile  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7685-00000106"/> 206      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF land, producing the same products as the others. I then took shipping from there to Jamaica, and in a short time we arrived safely. I then left the vessel and put up at a private boarding-house. After exam- ining the island all over, I found it to be very fertile, having a large Navy Yard, and producing the same products as the other islands. On this island there is more business done than on any other British island in the West Indies. I remained there a short time and then prepared myself for Paris. I watched daily to get a ship. At length there was a ship stopped to take in fruit for Paris, called the "New London," commanded by Captain Bigelow. I went and engaged a passage. We left in a few days as quick as she took in her loading. We were not out many days before we-were taken in a dead calm,- so that the ship tossed about in the swell wonderfiully; the passengers were all sea-sick. After a few days the wind began to rise from the south-east, and blew a hurricane, so that we had to close-reef our topsails. After a short time we had to fold up all sails, and set our storm staysails; we struck our royal topgallant mast.  We were in that hurricane nearly three days, which is not often the case, for the hurricanes seldom last over ten or twelve hours in the West Indies. After the third day there came a dead calm with a very heavy swell, so that there was no conrtrol of the vessel. In about twenty-four hours the swell abated and the captain ordered the royal topgallant mast, and royal topgallant yards set; and every thing got ready for sailing, when the wind sprung up. We had a great many passengers on board, and   DAVID RUSSELL.       207 among the passengers was an old gentleman and lady, and they had a very handsome young lady with them. They were French, I observed one day, as I was walking the quarter-deck with the captain. They took particular notice of me; as I drew near to the old mall I heard him say, "That man is no English- man, he is an American." I then thought I would watch an opportunity to speak to the old folks, as they were then on deck. The captain left me to attend to the sailors, and I walked towards the old folks; the young lady sat between the two. It being the fashion of the French to smoke, I asked the old gentleman if he would ini- dulge in a good cigar. He said he would and thanked me. I then pulled out my box and told him to help himself. MH took one, atnd I told liln to take a half-a-dozen. Said he, "You appear to be a very fine, bold look- ing young man, and very liberal; my folks have taken a great deal of notice of you since you came on board, particularly my niece. Now," he contin- ued, "young man, I don't wish to flatter you, par- ticularly to your face, but what I have already said behind your back I am about to say to your face. Young man, I must say you are the finest looking young man that I have seen since i left Paris. Now, young man, if it is a fair question for me to ask you,. what countryman are you? we have had a good many debates about you since you came on board at Ja- maica." c' Well, sir, I am an American."  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7685-00000107"/> 208      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF "I thought you was," he ,rejoined, " and I told limy folks you was no Englishman. You -appear to be a very friendly, open and free young man, and your countenance bespeaks friendship and good breeding. I knew-you was an American from the very first time I saw you." "Yes, sir, I am an American, and I am not ashanm- ed of my country. I am a true American! Young as I am, I have fought and bled for my country; I foughtjin the cavalry all through the last war, bo tween Great Britain and the United States, and I 41" willing to do it again, rather than to have the flag of my country dishonored." "Young man, you are a credit to the country you belong to. Since I left Paris I have traveled nearly all over England, and in all my travels through Eng- land I have not seen a young man that can begin with you, either in looks or knowledge. Now, young man, you must smake yourself at home with ius; we have got a very nice cabin and you must call ill several times a day, and as often as you. can." Accordingly I was in several times that day to see him, and he treated me to wine and cakes and fruit; he asked me if I understood any thing about the course we were in. I told him I did. He said, "Sir, I have heard by good-authors this is a very dangerous course we have to go." "Well, sir, it is a very dangerous course, particu-. larly if we are taken in a fogs or should have a gale of wind, for it brings us on a lee shore", and the suc- tion of the water forms a whirlpool 'around the   DAVID RUSSELL.       209 islands. This is the danger that a ship has to en- counter in passing down through the narrow straits, or shoals. Tomorrow I will take a sketch from the map and chart, and I will show you the dangers and how close we will have to pass to some of the isl- ands."' "Well, I shall be much obliged to you, if you will." I promised to attend to it on the morrow. The old gentleman and myself then went on deck, and in a short time we were invited down to the cabin to take some refreshments. By this time the young lady began to be very free to me. I asked her if it was a fair question for me to inquire her name? She replied, "Oh, yes, sir ; my name is Maria Lis- chia; and what is your name?" "My name is David Russell," I replied. She asked me if I calculated to settle in Paris? I told her it depended on how it suited me. "Oh," she said, "I have ho doubt but what it will suit you, Mr. Russell, for Paris is a pretty place." "Well, I cannot say any thing about it till we get landed, for we have several dangers to pass through before we get there." 'The next day I asked the captainf to let me over- haul his maps and charts. He asked me if I understood any thing-about it? I told him I did. "Well," said he, "I will let you look at them." Accordingly I overhauled them, and took a sketch from  them.  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7685-00000108"/> 210      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF, The captain seeing me taking the-sketch, said to me, "( Mr. Russell, I did not think you were so skill- ful in navigation." -I told him I understood a little. He said, "Not only a little, but a good deal." I then showed him the way he would have to steer. He said, "Yes, that is perfectly right; that is the way we have to steer." I then went to see the old gentleman and lady, and took my sketches to show him the danger we had to pass through. He said he was very sorry that we had the dan- gers to pass through; he had heard of them before. By tliis time the captain had got all things ready, and all sails set; the breeze sprung up, then we altered our course for the Spanish Main. We sailed on very lively until we got clear of the windward islands. At length we got in the Spanish Main, and we sailed down the Main very lively. We kept \as far to the windward as we possibly could, till we struck Pigeon Island; from that we rounded to and run down the Narrows. We kept to the Bermuda Islands all we could, and .we went down the Nar- rows pretty lively. After we got down to Bird Island and opposite Buffalo Island, we were taken in a fog. A little to the leeward of Pigeon Island, lay Little Bermuda Island; in between these islands is a deep channel, and rocks on each side of- the channel, sharped and flaring. To the windward of that is what is called the Narrows, or Shoals ; to the leeward of these shoals is 'the Little Bermuda Island. In   DAVID RUSSELL.       2" front of this island is the shoal, and rocks of every size and dimension and every shape. The wind still increased and the fog got thicker; we went on till we got down to opposite this Little Bermuda Island. We set our storm staysails and our foretopmast staysail, and our standing jib. The wind still kept rising and the fog got thicker. , All at once there was a heavy sea struck us on our weath- er bow, and washed a great part of our passengers and crew overboard, and filled the ship with water. This sea wore her away, and she drifted on those rocks in front of Bermuda Island. In the meantime I lashed myself fast to a belaying pin, near the' mizzen rigging. She made about three blows on the rocks, when she split in two. One half stuck on the rocks and the other half was washed away. Between the seas I discovered something floating backwards and forwards, and I slacked away my rope a little, made a grab at it and catched it; I found it was a woman, who was not yet dead.' I eased away one end of the rope and passed it around her, and brought it back and took two half hitches on -the belaying pin. Through the course of the night the wind fell and the fog cleared away a good deal. In  the morning the sun made its appearance through the fog, and the fog began to disperse ; the seas did not run so high and I could see all around me. Wlhen the morning came, I found, to my sur- prise, that the lady I had saved was Maria Lischia! I said, "Maria!" and she could not speak. I then got her up on the high part of the deck, and I rolled her on the deck, backwards and forwards, until she  &#xD;<pb n="212 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7685-00000109"/> 212      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF vomited up the salt water and began to get,better. I got her so that she could stand up on deck; I then got boards and scantlin, and blinds from. the berths in the cabin, and made a raft,which I tied together with pieces of rope. I lowered the lady on the raft, and then lowered myself down into the water; I took a small rope and made it fast to the raft, then pul it over my shoulders and around under my arms and swam for the island. After I got her off the raft I fixed a bower of orange and lemon bushes to shelter us from the sun. After this I formed a bltnk; I took the cocoanut husk and made a bed. We had to get into a shelter from the sun,-for the sun is so hot in the middle of the day in that country that no white person can stand it. In the evening we took a walk around the island to see if we could find any watei to drink, but we could find no water on the island. We then came back to our cabin again. I then said to Maria, "We are in the hands of a merciful God who has protected us from a watery grave. While we behold -many of our fellow mortals dashing aboul on the beach,:not a living soul can we behold on the island; we see nothing .but dead bodies wherever we go; so, now, let us fall down on our knees under this cocoaniut tree, and give thanks and praise and honoi and glory to Him that has saved us from a watery grave." Accordingly we fell down on our knees on the sand beach. I then lifted up my voice to heaven. "Al- mighty and most meiciful God, we do at this time humbly bow before Thee acknowledge our short- comings and nothingness, and also to acknowledge  &#xD;<pb n="-213" xml:id="VAC7685-00000110"/>  DAVID RUSSELL.       213 our sins and wickedness, and to ask forgiveness for all that we ever have committed.

Maria was weeping. and wailing all the time I was praying. There were birds of every kind and color, of every shade and of every hue, lighting on our heads while we were at prayer, and singing most melodious; they made the orange groves ring with their pleasant, cheerful sounds, and when I got up off my knees and beheld the birds and heard their singing, I said, "Maria, Maria, my dear Maria, le of good cheer, be of good cheer, for we shall not Le many days on this desolate island. I believe, O, Maria, something tells me that our heavenly Fathler lias already prepared a messenger, a guardian angel for our escape, and a way whereby we may find something to subsist on while we are on this island; and it will be revealed unto us tlis night I have faith to believe." Maria was calling for water, and saying, "Oh, Mr. Russell, 1 shall die for the want of water!" I was all but famished myself, and when I saw her, I pitied her from the bottom of my heart; burning up with a raging fever, and not a drop of water to wet her parched tongue!  The sun was pouring down with all its power and magnificence, so- that you might cook eggs in the sandy beach. I said, "Maria, my dear Maria, lay down on your couch and I will go and search once more for water for you." She exclaimed,  Oh, Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, don't leave me!" "Maria, my dear girl," I replied, '; you are burn-  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7685-00000112"/> 216      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF ing up with, fever, and if you don't have some water you will die." Oh, Mr. Russell, let me die and let my spirit take its flight aloft and leave this desolate island." "What, my dear Maria, would you leave me alone to die on this desolate island?" No, Mr. Russell, I do want to live on your ac- count, for your kindness towards me. O, that I had you in my own father's house, where there is bread enough and to spare, yea, and water and every thing to make you happy. If I had you there I should never let you leave me ; no one should pluck you out of my hands." "Now, Maria, my dear Maria, let me go in search of water if you please, for I will pray to our heaven- ly Father with a fervent prayer, and I know he will give us water in abundance, for I have faith, and do believe ill God, who has brought us here without the hair of our head being hurt, that he will find some way of escape for us from this desolate island; and I believe it and have faith to believe it." "Well, Mr. Russell, go; and may God grant that you may find water, but don't stay long." Accordingly I left her and wandered across and athwart the island every way, searching in every place that I thought I might find water, but could find none. Every thing was dried up but the orange and lemon trees, the lime tree and the sour sop, which all looked beautiful and green, with the fruit hanging in clusters. I then went into a thick orange grove, where the birds were swarming by thousands; I then knelt down in the middle of the grove and lifted up   DAVID RUSSELL.       217 my voice to God, my heavenly Father and my Saviour, that he would at this time save her and me from the jaws of death: "O, God, there is nothing but death stares us in the face. Strengthen us, O, strengthen us I beseech of you, and give us more faith. O, God, that we may believe more in thee; that we may rest assured that thou wilt perform all thou hast prom- ised. O, God, cause water to spring up, I beseech thee, out of those rocks, that I may obtain water for her who is dying for the want of it. O, God, I be- seech thee to show me what I ought to eat of these kinds of fruit, to obtain life; and open a way where- by I may obtain bread for her and me. Grant, I beseech thee, heavenly Fathler, all these mercies and blessings that I have asked for, for thy dear Son's sake, amen." The birds were flying around me in this grove, lighting on my head and shoulders and singing beautifully, while I was on my knees. I then re- turned back to the cabin, almost broken-hearted, for I had been gone some time and obtained nothing, and no prospects of gaining water for myself or Maria. As I was going back through the groves, and climbing over the high clefts of rocks, something seemed to whisper in my ears, "faith without works is dead," and continued whispering in my ears. 1 reached the cabin where Maria lay; she was asleep when I entered the cabin, but at my entering she woke up and said,  Mr. Russell, my dear Mr Russell, have you got me any water, for I shall surely die!" 10  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7685-00000113"/> 218      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF I replied, ' Maria, I have got none with me, but I think I can get some. Do you feel able to walk?" "Yes, Mr. Russell, I can walk." She took hold of my arm, and I walked with her to the large grove, where I had knelt and prayed. We entered the grove and sat down. I said, "Maria, my dear, I have faith to believe if I dig here, I shall get water, sooner or later." Accordingly I went to work with a flat stone and dug a well; I walled it up with sea shells of every color and kind and shape, and Maria said, "Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, do you think you will ever have any water there?" "Yes, Maria, my -dear Maria, I do believe we will have plenty of water there before tomorrow morn- ing." We walked back to the cabin, and Maria laid down on the bunk and went to sleep. The situation of this island is as follows: It is -a small island, laying, on the straits, narrows or sounds; these narrows or sounds are all full of shoals, rocks and sandbars, which make it a very dangerous course. The shipping has to pass down through these narrows' in a small channel; if it is fine weather they go down very safe, but if it comes on a fog or a storm, they seldom go down through, but are most always shipwrecked.   This- island is bounded with high rocks all around it, and in the centre there is some very fertile land, and tropi- cal fruit of all kinds, and southern birds of all kinds and colors. This island has witnessed the   t DAVID RUSSELT.       219 destruction of many a splendid ship in the course of a short time. Maria woke up. It was now night, and Maria i was nearly dead for the want of water. She said, "Oh, Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, was it not for your sake, I should wish to die this tment; but I am loth to leave you alone on tls desolate island; one that has risked his own life to save me, and done every thing that you could to make me comfortable and happy; was it not for this, I should freely give up the ghost." "Maria, Maria, let us put our trust in God, our Saviour, and look up to Him and to Him only; from Him cometh all blessings, and I have faith to believe before morning there will be a way opened to get bread as well as water. So, now, Maria, I want you not to let your spirits fail, but keep your spirits up, and Hwill pray to your heaven- ly Father and he will give us all things we need.' "Oh, Mr. Russell, your faith is great! Do you verily believe that you will have water in that well before morning?" a Yes, my dear Maria, I not only believes that well will be running over with water, but I believe that before tomorrow night there will be a way opened that we may have bread enough and to spare." I then sung a hymn ; "When I can- read my title clear, &amp;c.," and said, "Maria, let -us fall down on our knees and offer up a fervent prayer to our heavenly Father, that hle might bless us, for we are in his hand and sheep of his pasture; to whom can we go but to Him, for he hath the words of eternal  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7685-00000114"/> 220      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF life! Yea, he has been with us in six troubles and lie will not forsake us in the seventh; he has de. clared he will bring us through deep waters into green pastures; he has also declared that we shall pass through a fiery furnace and not a hair of our head shall be singed, and not the smell of fire be. on our garments. Yea, Maria, and more than those promises, he has made hundreds to those that love Rim and fear Him and keep His commandments. Now,' Maria, my dear Maria, can we help having faith and loving such a Saviour as this; One that not only made those promises for us, but bled and died on Mount Calvary for us! Can we help loving and obeying fim, one that laid down his life for us in pure love? Maria, I believe and have faith that he will perform all he has promised, and more than he has promised; and, moreover, my dear Maria, I have faith- to believe that we shall hot have only bread and water to eat and drink, but before two months roll around we shall both be landed safe in your father's house."' "Oh, Mr. Russell, may God grant it to be true . Oh, Mr. Russell, that I had the faith that you have got; you cheer my very soul to hear what you say.: "Yes, my dear Maria, my God has brought me through many dangers and trials, and he never for- sook me yet, and I know he will not forsake me now; though he should slay me, yet will I believe and put my trust in Him. He has declared he will never forsake or leave me, if I put my trust in Him ; and in Him only do I put my trust, and not in the arm of flesh."   DAVID RUSSELL.      221 It now being late, we laid down on our couch. It was excessively hot, but we slept very sound. I was awakened by a tremendous thunder-gust; the rain poured down in torrents, and the chains of lightning gushed from the elements. I sung praises to God in the midst of the storm, so that I made the orange groves ring. I said, "O, God Almighty, I thank thee that thou hast heard my prayer I know thou hearest prayer at all times when it cometh from a contrite heart; and I thank thee, my heavenly Father, I thank thee for thy loving-kindness; thou hast given us water to drink in abundance, and if I obey thy messenger, O, God, I., shall have bread enough and to spare. O, most merciful God, I do thank thee, all the blessings that thou art shower- ing down upon us. O, God, strengthen our faith and open our understanding, that we may see thy won- derous ways, for thy ways are not as man's ways, and thou seeth not as man seeth. Most merciful God, I beseech thee to fill us with thy Holy Spirit, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. All these mer- cies and blessings we ask in the name of our dear Redeemer, amen!" The sun had risen and the storm was Ecleared; every thing looked fresh and green. I then took Maria down to the well, taking a calabash along that I had prepared to drink out of. We walked over .the rocks into a valley and orange grove, and we came to the well and sat down. I dipped in the calabash and gave Maria a drink of water. The water appeared boiling up, and it was running out of the well in a stream.  I said to Maria, c You  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7685-00000115"/> 222      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF. recollect what you said yesterday, when I was digging this well?" "Yes, I. do recollect it well; I asked you if you ever expected, to get water there." "You recollect what I said to you, that you would see that well running over in the morning?" "Yes, Mr. Russell, I well recollect it." "Now, Maria, you have had a good drink of water and you enjoy it', "Yes, Mr. Russell, I never drank a glass of wine that tasted better in my life." "Well, Maria, come with me and let us go to our cabin; I will tell you something that will astonish you," We then went to the cabin and sat down; Maria said, "Oh, Mr. Russell, how faint I feel and sick at my stomach; this is the third day that we have had nothing to eat!" "I don't wonder you feel faint," I replied, su in not having any thing to eat so long ;. but have patience a few hours and I: will have you -plenty here to eat." "Where will yoiu get it, Mr. Russell?" "Why, Maria, I will swim to the ship, aid there is plenty. I knew nothing about it till last night; you know we sat up till it was late, and then we laid down on our couch and soon fell asleep in the -arms -of our Saviour, protected by Him only. After I had fallen asleep I slept very sound; I thought I saw the angel of the Lord standing before me. He said, ' Son of man, fear not, you must go your journey safe, and not a hair of your head shall be hurt; arise, and go   DAVID RUSSELL.       223 to the ship, and there you shall find provisions enough to subsist on while you are on the island, and some to spare; it is in the furthermost part of the ship, in the stern, in the lowermost hold; I have given you water in abundance, and it will be water for you as long as you are on the island. In a few days there will be a ship passing by that will take you from this island; but there is one thing required of you to do, that is, you must hoist a standard on the south-east part of the island, fronting the Narrows, and hoist it half mast high, as a signal of distress.' Now, Maria, I have got to do those things that I was told to do, and the first thing I will do is to go to the ship and get the provisions." "Oh, Mr. Russell, are you going to leave me here alone to die?"              . "My dear Maria, no, I am not going to leave you to die here alone, God forbid I should; but I am going to get something to save your life and mine." "Mr. Russell, I never can agree to have you leave me here alone; for the moment you leave me I shall die." '"My dear Maria, do let me prevail on you to let me go; do not stop me, for it will be the means of saving your life and mine; I shall only be gone about two hours, and I shall be back with provision enough to last Us while we are on the island." "Oh, Mr. Russell, can't you take me with you?" "Maria, my dear Maria, I could take you with me, but it will take me as long to make a raft as what it would to go to the ship and come back."  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7685-00000116"/> 224      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF "Oh, Mr. Russell, you can never reach that vess l, she is so far off." "Why, Maria, I swam from the vessel and towed you on a raft behind me, and surely I cal go there alone!" "Yes, Mr. Russell, but I don't want to have you go. "Yes, Maria, my dear, I must go to save your life and mine. How pretty it would look in me, knowing that there is plenty of provisions on board that ship, to let you lay down and die for the want of some- thing to eat, and die myself." At this I sprung into the water and struck out for the ship. Maria screamed and yelled at me, "' You wicked wretch, to go away and leave me here to die!" In a short time I arrived at the wreck, climbed up and got on board. I went down into the lowermost hold, where I found things just as I was told; pro- visions of all kinds; also, a case of wine and Maria's trunk; a sword, pistols and a gun, besides a great many other valuable articles. I then went to work and knocked in the bulkheads of the cabin and made a good solid raft, lashing the timber together with ropes. I then got all my things on the raft and lashed them fast; but I could not find any thing of mine. I lost my two trunks and a great many valuable articles, and I was left with. nothing but my shirt and a thin pair of trowsers that I had on, and not even a hat on my'head. After securing every thing on my raft that I could find, I passed a line   DAVID RUSSELL.       2 ,225 around my shoulders, slid off into the water, and struck out for the shore with my cargo fast to me. Maria met me on the beach, and she jumped with joy to see me return safe from the ship. She said, "Oh, Mr. Russell, what a kind man you are! but you must forgive me for what I said when you left the beach; I ask your pardon ten thousand times!" "My dear Maria, certainly I forgive you, for I knew how bad you felt. Now, Maria, look here and see what I got for you by going on board the vessel; here is dried ham, dried vension, dried beef, salt pork and salt beef; tea, coffee, sugar, bread, sea biscuit, cakes, wine and some brandy; a brace of pistols, a sword and gun; and dishes, knives and forks; and see here, I have got your trunk." "Oh, Mr. Russell, you are certainly very clever and kind; I had no thought of your getting so much. In fact, I did not think you would get any thing." "Now, Maria, my dear, we must not eat much at a time; we have been three days without eating, and  if we indulge too freely it will kill us. So, Maria, you must let me give you your allowance for a while." Accordingly we took a little to eat, but very little at first. After we had secured every thing in our cabin, I said to Maria, that I must have her shawl for a flag. Sle told me that I could have' any thing she had got. She took my arm and we walked to the south- east part of the island. Wlen we got down to the point of the island, I said to Maria, '"So stay 10'  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7685-00000117"/> 226      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF here a few minutes while I go and cut a bamboo." I brought a tomahawk with me that I had found on the vessel, and I went and cut a fine large bamboo. I came back to Maria and got her shawl and tied it on half-mast high, and then planted my standard. After this we returned to our cabin; Maria said, 'I Oh, Mr. Russell, do let me have some- thing more to eat t" "Well, Maria, I will let you have a little, but I am afraid to let you have much." So I helped her to, a little. - After we had taken some refreshments we took a walk around the island ; as we walked along the beach we saw nothing but dead bodies, washed back and forth by the surf. After taking a short walk, we returned back to our cabin, and as we were going back we meditated on the solemn sight that we beheld, which was heart-rending, indeed. After we got in our cabin, I said to Maria, "My dear Maria, how thankful ought we to be to the Al- mighty, our heavenly Father, for the preservation of our lives; especially when we behold the dead bodies of our fellow-creatures, which, by nature, are as good as we .are ;but, Maria, we are preserved and what for?" "Well, Mr. Russell, I could not tell you." "Well, my'dear Maria, shall I tell you?" "Yes, Mr. Russell, I would like you to tell me, for you talk like a minister; I never heard our priest talk as you do. When you made your first prayer, I never felt in my life as I did then; it was under that large cocoanut tree whereon you cut the Ameri- can flag, and that splendid verse of scripture under   DAVID RUSSELL.       227 the flag, and your name under the verse with the place and day of your birth, David Russell, the young and true American; and the day we landed on this island. It was well executed." "Yes, Maria, I prayed earnestly and with faith, and my prayer was heard and answered; I dug that well in faith, and the next morning it was running over with water. Yes, Maria, and that well mav stand to cool many a parched tongue, and this cabin we now sit in may afford refuge and shelter to many a poor creature thlat may be cast On this desolate island. But now I must tell you what we are per- mitted to live for Maria, my dear: we are permitted to live, to serve and obey, honor and praise, give might and power and gloryunto God and his Son, our Mediator and Redeemer." We talked a short time, when I said, "Maria i-t is getting late, and we will sing a hymn, make a prayer, and retire to our couch. We slept sound all night; the next morning we were awakened by the beautiful whistling and singing of the birds around our cabin. The sun threw its reflections in through the bushes on us, and every thing looked magnificent around us. We arose and gave thanks to the Almighty for his preservation through the night; we then took some little refreshments and walked down to the flag-staff. We stood and looked around on the ocean as far as our eyes could behold; at last, I said to Maria, "I think I see a sail; it has the appearance of being a ship!" I then took -out my spy-glass from my pocket and looked at her, when I found'she was a ship,' square-rigged, standing for the Narrows with  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7685-00000118"/> 228      AUTOBIOGRAPifY OF studding-sails set, alow and aloft. I said, "Maria, I think that is the ship that will take us off this island." "Well, Mr. Russell, may God grant it," she ex- claimed. I told Maria to sit down, and I would get up on a high cleft of rocks and look out. Accordingly she sat down, and I got up on a high cleft of rocks ; I sat down on one that was lower than another, and rested my glass on the higher one, and by so doing I could take a good observation of her. I was perfectly satisfied in my own mind, that she was a French vessel bound for Paris, and she would have to pass through the Narrows. I then came to Maria and told her that I believed that before to- morrow night we would be on board that ship, and on our way to Paris again! Maria said she hoped so, but she was rather doubt- ful. "Well," said I, "Maria, tomorrow morning will tell the story, for if she is bound to France she will have to pass through the Narrows, and she will pass close by this island. So, now, Maria, we will return to our cabin and make some tea." After we got back, H,got three stones and made a place to set the tea-kettle on*; I then went to the well and got my kettle filled with good pure water, then made a fire and set the kettle in, and in a short time it was boiled. By this time Maria had got some potatoes pealed and sliced up, ready for cooking. She cooked them and we had a splendid tea. After tea we sat down and sung hymns till late. I said,   DAVID RUSSELL.       229 "Maria, it is now getting late, and we will go to prayer and retire to bed." Accordingly we went to prayer, and after prayer we retired to bed. We talked awhile and then went to sleep. Early the next morning, we were awoke by the music of the birds all around us. After we had given thanks to the Almighty for his protection through the night, we got breakfast. After breakfast we went down to the flag-staff, and, behold, the ship was making for the Narrows! - As soon as she got to the head of the Narrows she backed her maintopsail and hiove to. I then said to Maria, "We will go and get your trunk, for there will be a boat here for us in a short time.1" We then went and got her trunk, and the musket and sword and brace of pistols, and brought them down to the flag-staff. By this time the boat was nearly ready to land. We then sat down, on the trunk, and the captain stepped on shore. He said, "Young man, you are a valiant looking young man; how came you here?" I replied, "Captain, I will tell you hereafter; I wish you to step back a few paces, for I have a few words to say to you privately." I then shook hands with him, and gave him a masonic sign of distress; he answered it, and he gave me another; I answered it, and we passed several signs together. - At this time he ordered some of the sailors to go up to the cabin and bring the things down."  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7685-00000119"/> 230      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF "Now, captain," I remarked, "I want you to pledge your word and honor to one thing." "What is that sir?" he inquired. "That you will protect that lady while she is on board your ship, from all dangers of your crew; for my part, captain, I would lose the last drop of blood in my body before any body should molest her; and when I get on board I will tell you the whole story, and you won't wonder why I talk the way I do." Said he, "' Young man, you need not fear, for one hair of her head shall not be hurt while she is on board of my vessel. I will give you and her a berth where you can guard her." I thanked him for his kindness. He then asked me what countryman I was? I told him I was an Amer- ican. He then asked ine from what part of the United States I came? I told him I was a native of Boston, in the State of Massachusetts. "Well," said he, "I am a native of Boston my- self; what is your name?" "My name is David Russell." "'Are you of the Russell family, of the four brothers?" I told him, I was a son of John H. Russell, and a nephew to his three brothers. "Well, young man," he replied, "I know your folks very well; any thing. you want I can let you have. You are at home on board of my ship." I then thanked him for his kindness,. and got Maria on board of the boat with all the things and her trunk, and bid adieu to the island. We were soon safe alongside of the ship, and soon were on   DAVID RUSSELL."      281 board. The captain invited us down into the cabin and showed us our berths, and the accommodations he had for us. He then left us and went up on deck to order the boat" hoisted, and to get the ship in the Narrows. He got safe in the Narrows and had a pleasant run down, and as we went past Little Ber- muda, the island we had left,.I said to Maria, "Now you can bid farewell to the island and to the little cabin." At this the' captain stepped up, and inquired, "Is that the cabin that I see on those crotches?" "Yes, sir, that is the cabin." "Well," said he, "it is very ingeniously made, indeed; I never saw any like it before." "Yes, captain," said Maria, "Mr. Russell is not only ingenious, but he is lively and cheerful; he would cheer the heart of any one. We were three days and three nights in that cabin, without any thing to eat or drink, and I was burning up with a raging fevers; I thought I must die, and I wanted to die, but Mr. Russell sat by me and watched over me day and night, and cheered my drooping heart. Yes, captain, he sung praises and prayed to God in the midst of all that trouble; you behold those orange groves, how beautiful they look!" "Yes," said the captain, ' they look beautiful, in- deed, to behold." "Well, captain, I don't think there is a grove on that island but what has witnessed Mr. Russell's prayers; for I believe he prayed in every one. Yes, captain, when we were famishing for water, and I thought we must die, Mr. Russell went and dug  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7685-00000120"/> 232      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF a well, and he walled it up with sea-shells, andV it was splendid to look at. My father has got many handsome things in his gardens and vineyards, bltt le has nothing in all his gardens and vineyards to be compared with the beauty of that well; and, captain, I would give one thousand francs this moment to have- that well put in my father's gardens. Yes, captain, and when that well was dug, there was no more sign of water than there is on the deck of your ship ; and after Mr. Russell had completed it we fell down on our knees, and he offered up prayer to the Almighty that the well might be filled withl water, and I do believe he was on his knees cne hour; and such a prayer I never heard come from the lips of- man in my life, for I believe it would rend the heart of the hardest-hearted man in the world. Captain, I have heard many, many prayers in my own country, but I never heard such a prayer in all my life as that, nor I never had such a feeling or any thing to touch my heart as that did; and, cap- tain, the whole grove seemed to be illuminated, for the glory of God appeared to shine all around that well; and when he raised on his feet, his counten- ance looked to me like an angel's, and he stepped forward towards me and took me by the hand, aid said, ' Maria Maria, my dear Maria, be of good cheer; let not your spirit fail -you; believe in God, in faith, and whatsoever you ask it shall be given unto you. You see no water, my dear, in that well-, now.' ' No Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, I never expect to see any water there.' That was the reply I made to him, and- Mr. Russell said, ' Maria, by   DAVID RUSSELL.       233 tomorrow morning you will see this well boiling up and running over, and a stream running from it of pure water.' I told him, 'Mr. Russell, you have labored and toiled hard in fetching those shells over the rocks, and digging this well; certainly you have labored very hard, and your shirt is as wet with perspiration as if it was dipped in- the ocean:;' and Mr. Russell's remark I shall never forget, ' Maria, my dear Maria, do you recollect the words our Saviour said to Thomas?   He said, Thomas, Thomas, come forward and thrust thy fingers into the prints of the nails, and thy hand into my side, and be not faithless! Now, Maria, I exhort you in the name of God Almighty not to be as Thomas was, faithless, indeed, but to have faith in God, and cry out as Thomas did when he had faith, O, my God, my God and Saviour.'  By this time we were near the mouth of the Nar- rows, and in a short time we got through into the sea, where we had plenty of sea-room. We were now leaving the islands very fast, with a fair wind, for Paris. It blew a beautiful breeze and we set all sail, with studding-sails alow and aloft; the breeze seemed to freshen, and when I held the log we were running at the rate of fifteen knots an hour. As soon as'we left the mouth of the Narrows, I commenced studying the maps and charts, taking observations and keeping the reckoning. The cap- tain seeing thisg he was astonished. "Why," said he, "Mr. Russell, I never could' take the parallel lines as accurate as you do, and I believe. you can beat me in any part of navigation.  Now, Mr.  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7685-00000121"/> 234      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF Russell, I will give you an excellent chance if you will sail with me; I would not miss having you with me, for I can learn a good deal from you. I never saw a young man, as young as you, know as much about navigation. When I saw you that morning on the island, I thought you was an extraordinary young man, but I did not think you understood any thing about navigation. Now, Mr. Russell, I don't wish to flatter you, but you can get to be captain of most any ship you have a mind to, by making appli- cation." I said, "Ah, captain, I have no idea of ever being captain of a ship; but I do believe if I had staid in the U. S. navy, by this time I would be captain of a U. S. frigate." "Well, Mr. Russell," the captain replied, "I do recollect something about your going to West Point." "Yes; sir, I was two years in West Point, and two years in the navy; and sir, when I left the U. S. frigate, there was only one officer on board that could beat me in navigation, and that was captain Bell." Said the captain, "Miss Lischia, you have got one of the smartest men here that I ever saw of his age." "Yes, captain, I know that, for I am perfectly aware of it." "Miss Lischia, I shall endeavor to get him away from you, for I am going to make him captain of this ship, and I shall sail as mate under him." "No, captain, all the men. in the world could never get Mr. Russell away from me, for he has been my benefactor, and he has saved my life; he, has com- forted -me in sickness and in health, and he has   DAVID RUSSELL.       235 watched over me day and night, as a mother would watch over her infant; he has guarded me from all dangers and perils; -yea, captain, he has prayed day and night for me without ceasing; and several times he has risked his own life for me, to my own knowl- edge; and now captain, do you think that I could ever let him go? He is an honor to his country, and a glory to the mother that bore him, and I never intend to leave him, or he shall never leave me ; and all that I have, and all that my father has, shall be his; and as for him being captain of a ship, there is no need of it, for he may have ships of his own, if he has a mind; and put -captains on board of them." By this time the wind had hauled forward a little, and the captain ordered the yards to be braced round. It was now night, and the captain ordered the lee, studding sails to be taken in. Maria, and myself, retired to our-room. I then went to the log board, and took a copy of every thing that was, on it; and then goes to the captain and asked him to lend me his maps and charts, and he did so; I then went to the cabin. At this time I had all my reckoning as far as we had come. I then said to Maria, "My dear Maria, I am going to take the distance, and I will tell you to a day when we will arrive in Paris, if we have a good breeze, and it is the Lord's will." "Well, Mr. Russell, I would like to know indeed, when we would get, there." We had been running about twelve or fifteen miles an hour, ever since we left the narrows, and we were then running about fifteens miles an hour. Maria began to get sleepy and tired. Said she, "I am very  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7685-00000122"/> 236      AUTOBIOGRAPHY- OF sleepy, Mr. Russell." We then went to'prayer, and she retired to her bed. After she retired, I took my maps and charts, book and slate, and took my dis- tances and my variation ; and I proved all the rules by an accurate mathematical principle. I found by thus doing, that if we had a steady breeze, we would reach Paris in about ten days. I then retired to bed. Early the next morning, I arose as usual, and I then went and woke Maria up. I said, "' Maria, my dear, you will see your father, if it is the Lord's will, and nothing happens, in about ten or twelve days." She raised up and said, "May God Almighty grant it to be true what you say! Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, I don't want to see-him so much on my own account, as I do on yours, that I may present unto him a friend, yea, more than a friend; one that could not have treated me kinder if I had been his lawfull wife. There are but few men, Mr. Russell, that would do as you have done, that would risk their lives three times for a strange woman, one they never saw before, which you have done to my own knowl- edge." "Well, Maria, my dear, I have done nothing but by duty, and could I have saved your uncle and aunt, I would have done it freely." "Mr. Russell, I have been acquainted with you but a short time, but I do say, from the bottom of my heart, calling God Almighty to witness, that I never have seen your equal; you are one that is bold, valiant and courageous; and one that is not daunted at any thing; and kind and free."

We were then called in to breakfast; there were a great many ladies and gentlemen from different parts going to Paris. -The captain had every thing served up in the most splendid order, and in American style; indeed there could never be a better table set than that. After we had done breakfast, Maria and my- self went on deck ; the captain met us on the quarter deck, and he saluted us, saying, "' Well, Mr. Russell, we have been running at the rate of fifteen miles an hour all niglft."- "Ah," said I, "Captain, that is running pretty well." "Yes," said the captain, ' it is doing very well. Mr. Russell, I suppose you have examined the maps and charts, so that you can tell us very near the time we will arrive in Paris?"' "Yes, sir, I can tell youj-to a day what time you will arrive. If you have the breeze you have got now, with this breeze and running at the rate you are now running, that is fifteen knots an hour, you will arrive in Paris in about eight days; and at a mod- erate rate you will run it in about ten days." We sailed six days after this, and I got up one morning and come on deck; I took my spy glass and went to the royal mast head, where I took an obser- vation for land. I had not sat long before I discov-  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7685-00000123"/> 238      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF ered land. ' I then went down and told the captain there was land ahead, and I could see it from the mast head. The captain ran up and looked, and was soon down again, saying, "Yes, Mr. Russell, that is France!" Said I, "I know it is, captain." "Well, Mr. Russell, I did not expect to see land for three or four days yet." ' Well," said I, "Captain, you make wild calcula- tions." "Well," said he, " you make such close calcula- tions and so accurate, that it makes mine look worse than it is. I have been with a good many men since I sailed the waters, and I never saw a man as partic- ular as you in every part of navigation." At this he turned around to Maria, and said, "' Miss Lischia, what a noble captain and commander Mr. Russell would make." 'Yes," said Maria, 'Captain, Mr. Russell is a noble man any way you can fix him, and captain, you know he has got a noble mind, and it is the mind that makes the man."' We had been running at the rate of fifteen knots an hour; and the wind was still rising, and we were drawing near the land very fast, so that we could see every thing plain from deck. The captain ordered all sail to be set, and she went through the water beau- tiful. Early the next morning, I went on deck, and I took my spy glass and looked through it; I could see the French jack flying at. fort Berlon, at. the entrance of the harbor. I then went down to Maria   DAVID RtUSSELL.       239 in the cabin, and I said, "Maria, my dear Maria, I have good news to tell you!" "What is it, dear Mr. Russell?" ' I can see the Frencli flag flying at fort Berlon, and, Maria, my dear, we shall be at your father's house tomorrow morning by ten o'clock." ' May God grant it, Mr. Russell, for I long to see my folks once more." That evening we sailed by the fort, and we went up to Paris with a flowing sheet. We sailed through the shipping till at last we came alongside of the wharf. I then told Maria -that we must stop at the largest hotel in Paris that night, and we stopped at the u' LaFayette." After we had taken our rooms and got our trunk up, I called a hack. I told him to drive us to the best tailor in Paris, where I was measured for three different suits of clothes; they were to be- made Yright off, and were to be brought to the LaFayette Hotel. Maria gave them her card, and then she took me to a shirt establishaent and got me about two or three dozen shirts, of the finest quality, and all-with the finest eambric ruffles. I was fitted up with every thing that I needed; we then went back to the hotel. About two weeks before we landed, news had reached Paris that the New London was wrecked, mnd all the crew, the captain and all the passengers were lost, and not a soul saved. Now, Mr. and Mrs. Lischia, and all the friends of the family were in deep mourning. I said to Maria, "We have got to  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7685-00000124"/> 240       AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF work curiously, for it will not do to take your parents by surprise."  "Well, Mr. Russell," Maria replied, "I will leave it all with you, for your judgment is better than mine." Well, Maria, there is only one way it can be done to do it right. I want to hire a close carriage, and I want to have us shut. up in it so as no one can see us, and drive up near your father's house; when I must get out and go into your fath- er's house and make intercession for you." "Well," she said, "Mr. Russell, that is an excel- lent plan." We then kneeled down and went to prayer, and after prayer we retired to bed. / '    DAVID RUSSELL. J       241 CHAPTER      VIII.

EARLY the next morning we arose, and after giving thanks to, the Almighty for his protection through the night, we each of us took a bath. After we had washed and dressed, our breakfast was sent up to us. After we had eaten our breakfast we sat down a little while and consulted over matters. - Soon, the tailor ,came with the clothes, and I tried them on; they all fitted well. Maria settled the bill, and the tailor left. 4"Now, Mr. Russell," said Maria, "I want to have you dressed up nice." I then went to work and dressed myself. After I was dressed, I said, "' Now, Maria, I will go and get a hack while you dress, and I will be back as quick as I can." Accordingly I went and got a hack, just such a one as I wanted, and I was drove back to the hotel again. When I got there, Maria was dressed and waiting; I then rung the bell and the waiter came, when I told him I wanted our trunk put aboard that hack, and that I wanted to see the landlord. He then went and sent up the porter, and the landlord came up; we settled the bill, and then "  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7685-00000125"/> 242      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF got in the hack. I had already given the driver orders where to take us. Accordingly he drove us to a small inn about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Lischia's house. I then got out and gave him orders to take good care of the carriage and all that was in it, and I would be back in a short time. I then left the carriage and went to the house. Now the house was a cottage, and was splendidly built, having two wings; it was finished in the Corinthian order, and it sat back far enough from the road to give room for a nice flower garden; there were splendid walks and gardens on each side and one on the back, and those gardens were all in splendid order. JI then walked up the front walk to the door, and rung the bell. The porter came to the door, and I asked him if Mr. Lischia was at home? He said he was. I asked if I could see him? He invited me into the hall while he went and in- formed M3r. Lischia that there was a gentleman wished to see him. Mr. Lisclhia came out. He was an old gentleman, dressed in deep mourning. I said, "Good morning, Mr. Lischia!  He replied, Good morning, sir; what is your business with me?" "I wish to have a little talk with you and your family." Accordingly he invited -me into a private parlor; he then called his wife in and they both sat down. 1 then said to him, "Mr. Lischia, I suppose you have   DAVID RUSSELL. -      243 heard of the loss of the New London?" they both wept aloud. '"Yes, young 'man, we have heard of it, and we well know it to our sorrow. I. have lost my dear brother and his wife; and the worst of all, my dear Maria, my only daughter, and only child!" and he and his wife wept aloud. After this we sat 'a little while, and he cried out, "Oh, Maria! Maria! my daughter! my daughter! my daughter! my dear daughter! what would I give to see my dear child!" "Mr. Lischia," I observed, "I want you to cheer up and be not disheartened nor dismayed, but trust, in God, and all things will work for the best; have faith in our Lord and Saviour. Our Lord says, ' If you believe in me, though you are dead, yet you shall live; and whosoever believeth in me shall never die.' Now, Mr. Lischia, I want you to cheer up and wipe your drooping eyes, both you and your lady; I speak to both when I speak to one. Now I want you, Mr. Lischia and Mrs. Lischia, I want you to listen and take particular notice of what I have to say to you., I want you to promise me on your word and honor that you will not be excited beyond ex- treme, when I shall tell you what I have to tell you. I have come to bring you tidings of great joy; I am from the wreck of the New London myself, and I now tell you, Mr, Lischia, when that ship was broken in two, I had lashed imyself to the stern of the ship, to the taffrail, near the mizzenmast, and the waves and billows were dashing mountains high' over me. In the midst of this, while I was lashed  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7685-00000126"/> 244      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF and holding on to the rope, something slapped me in the face several times like the hair of a person's head; I was determined to grab it if I could. It being night and very dark I could not see far, but I watched and I saw something pass close by me several times; then I eased away myrope, ill order to let me out farther, so that I might catch it when it passed. I saw it coming, and I grabbed it and held it fast till I got the same rope around it. We both swung, fastened to the rope, to and fro by the raging billows till morning. In the morning th e wind fell and the sea lowered, so that the stern part of the vessel was dry, for it lay high on the rocks. I then found it was a female that I Itad eaught t but she was as a lifeless corpse, swinging in the rope; she had no power of herself and could not speak. I felt her pulse and found it very high. I- then took her in my arms to the highest part of the ship where it was dry, and lay her downa on the deck ; I held her head up with one hand, and rolled- her to and fro in order to make her vomit up the salt water. -She vomited up some quantity of salt water, and very soon afterwards she felt-better and could talk cheerful. I then found it was a young lady that I had seen and spoken to a day or two before, with an old gentleman and lady from Paris. By this time the winCd fell, so that it was nearly a calm, and the sea lowered. I then asked her if she could swim, and she said she could, not swim a bit. I then- said, ' Maria, we must get. off of this vessel as quick -as we can, and get onl that island, for- if the wind should rise we would never   DAVID RUSSELL.       245 get off.' So I went to work and knocked downi the bulkheads of the cabin, and made a raft and got her on it; I passed a rope around my shoulders and jumped into the sea, and swam with her and the raft to shore. We landed safe on the island of Ber- muda, and we were three days and three nights on this island without eating or drinking; but our heavenly Father at last gave us bread and water enough and to spare. Mr. Lischia, I have given you a short sketch of the history of the wreck of the New London, commanded by Captain Bigelow. Now, Mr. Lischia, you must recollect what you promised me, that you would not get excited beyond measure. She whom you loved and thought was dead now liveth ; she it is that livetlh, who is bright and blooming as the rose in the spring of the year. She it is that liveth, that will make you and yours happy in your declining years; and she it is that liveth, who is your only dear daughter Maria; she it is that liveth, whom the jaws of death were about to devour, and our Lord and Saviour made intercession for her; she it is that liveth, that if she has faith in the Son of God and in His blood and believe in Him, He will cleanse her from sin and unrighteousness, and take her at last into His kingdom to sing praises to Him with -all the heavenly hosts; and may God  grafit it, for His dear Son's sake, amen, amen. Now, Mr. and Mrs. Lischia, I want you not to be excited, for I will present your daughter before you in less than one hour!"

Now, sir, can you do what you say, or are you deceiving me?" "God forbid I should deceive you, but as true as the Lord liveth, I will present your daughter Maria before you in less than one hour." "My dear young man, if you could do that I would give you all I have got; but what you do, do it quickly." " My dear sir, I will do it and not ask any thing, but think it a pleasure to do it, for I delight in doing good." Accordingly I went back and told Maria all that had passed, saying, '"I told them I would present you in less than one hour; so let us go on, Maria, and I will present you to your father and give up my charge." u You ain't going to leave me, Mr. Russell, are you?" "No, Maria, I am not going to leave you, but when I was on the island with you, and also when I went on board the vessel to get provisions for you and me, I prayed to our heavenly Father in both places, that he would, permit me to take you safe to your parents; and do you recollect what I told you when you was at the worst of your bitter- ness and agony on the island; when you told me that you were sorrowful even unto death, and that you wished you could die, and I said,' Oh, Maria, would you go and leave me here alone on this deso- late island to die?'  "Yes, Mr. Russell, I do recollect saying those words to you about that time."   DAVID RUSSELL.      247 "And, Maria, my dear Maria, do you recollect the reply I made to the words you said?" "I can't recollect them all."   * ' Well, I will tell them: I told you to be of good cheer, and cheer up your drooping spirit, and trust in God your Saviour and he will give you such things as you need. Also, I told you that you would have plenty of water and to spare in the morning, and before tomorrow-noon you would have bread enough and to spare; and I also told you before two months you would be at your father's house; do you recol- lect that?" "Yes, Mr. Russell, I do recollect it, well." "Well, Maria, it is not one month yet since I told you; and, now, Maria, you are within a quarter of a mile of your father's hlouse ; this is the reason I told you I wanted to deliver up my charge." At this time the carriage started for Mr. Lischia's. Maria said to me, u' Oh, Mr. Russell, what a kind man you are and how kind you hlave been to me. I shall tell my pa all about your kindness towards me and every thing that happened." We talked a short time and the carriage drove up to her father's door. I then jumped out and helped Maria out of the carriage, and we walked into the house. -Her father and mlother met us in the hall, and they cried out, "My God! my God! my God 'Al- mighty!" When we got in the room they fell on her neck and wept aloud as they embraced her. All in- the house wept, even to the field servant, and it took some time before they could get pacified.  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7685-00000128"/> 248      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF Maria sat-down on the sofa, and said, "Mr. Rus- sell, sit up close to me, my dear, for you are at home; you are in your own house." "Why," said I, "Maria, how am I in my own house?"          , "My dear Mr. Russell," she replied, " this prop- erty is all mine, and what-is mine is yours." She then said, "Now pa and ma, if you will listen I will tell you how I came to get saved from a watery grave. Mr. Russell came on board at Jamaica, and myv uncle and aunt took particular notice of him. My uncle made many remarks about him to me and my aunt.' He observed he was the'finest looking young man that he had seen since he left Paris; but lie knew he was no Englishman. One day my uncle and aunt and myself were sitting on the after part of the quarter-deck, and Mr. Russell and the captain were walking backwards and forwards oil the quar- ter-deck, talking about navigation. The captain had some business with the men and he left Mr. Russell, who walked alone a little while. At length lie walked up to my uncle, and as we all sat close together he saluted us all,; he pulls out a very nice little box and asked my uncle if he would take a good Spanish cigar. He thanked him and took one, and he told him to take ia half-a-dozen, for he had a box of them. Uncle then said to Mr. Russell, ' Young man, you are-a fine, bold looking young man; I don't wish to flatter you, young man, but I must say you are the finest looking young man that I have seen since I left Paris; you appear to have the most judgment of any man that I have ever seen of   DAVID RUSSELL.    .   249 your age. Young man, if it is a fair question, what countryman are you?' He told him he was an American! Uncle turned around to us and said, ' Did I not tell you he was an American!' This was the first acquaintance that I had with Mr. Russell. My uncle then invited him down into the cabin to take a glass of wine and some cake, and he also told Mr. Russell to come to see them and make it his home with them, for he said he liked his looks, he had such an open and free coun- tenance; and the next time I invited him to come down myself, by the order of my aunt. My uncle then asked Mr. Russell if he understood any thing about the course we were going through, for lhe understood it was a dangerous course. He said he did, for he had been through that course once before, and it was a very dangerous course, par- ticularly if a ship was taken in a fog or a gale of wind.  Uncle asked Mr. Russell if he knew any thing about the rocks and shoals, and he told him he would get the maps and charts and give him -a sketch of them, and show him the most dan- gerous ones. "Accordingly he made a drawing and a sketch, with all the shoals and sandbars and rocks, and gave it to my uncle. We had then entered the Narrows, and were going down very lively. All at once we were taken in a heavy fog, and the wind blew a gale. Still we went along till we got down nearly to Bermuda Island, and then we were struck with a heavy sea that filled the ship; most of the passengers, including my uncle and aulit and myself, "I  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7685-00000129"/> 250      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF were on deck. I never knew any thing from that time till I found myself in Mr. Russell's arms in the morning, and he said, ' My dear, how do you feel?' I felt very sick, indeed; I then began to vomit considerable, after wlich, I felt much better. Mr. Russell asked me if I could swim, and I told him I could not. ItHe then went to work and made a raft, by knocking away the bulkheads of the' cabins to get timber to make it. He lowered me down and secured me on it, and then fastened a rope to it and put it around his shoulders and around under his arms and jumped into the sea and struck out for the shore, and towed me along on the raft. At length we were both landed safe onl the island. He then went to work and built a very neat cabin of orange and lemon bushes, to shelter us from the! sun, for it poured down on us very hot. I pitied Mr. Russell, for he had not a hat on his head, and nothing but his shirt and pants on, for he lost all his clothes on the wreck. I offered him my hand- kerchief to tie around his head, but he said,' Never mind me, Maria, I will do well enoughl but, my dear Maria, it is you that I feel for; I want to make you, comfortable and happy on this- desolate island.' He then asked me if I would walk a little way with him. I told him I would, and as we walked along we beheld nothing but dead bodies on the beach, washing about by-the surf and sea, which was an awful sight to behold. In the front of this island the rock was very high; he took me along to a. place where there appeared to be an opening, and the rock was low. He said to me, ' Maria, wo   DAVID RUSSELL.        251 will go in through here.' He then took me by the hand and helped me over the rugged rocks. After we went a little way over the rocks we came to a beautiful valley, and, indeed, it was the most splendid pTace I ever saw in all my life. It was covered with orange groves, with their bright, green leaves glittering in the sun, and the beautiful clusters of oranges hanging between the beautiful green leaves. Those beautifully magnificent trees were some part in blossom, some part in bud; on some the blossoms were just falling off and the fruit was breaking through; some had fruit half grown, and some was perfectly ripe. Such a beautiful contrast was seen that the skill of an artist could never touch it. There was the lemon tree, the lime tree, the tamarind tree and many other trees that we did not know the names of; and all those trees indeed were splen- did to behold. And pa and ma, there were birds of every kind and every color and every hue, which were singing with melodious voices of every sound in this grove. He then took me by the hand and walked with me through this groveI till lie came to a very large cocoanut tree; tis tree, indeed, was beautiful and magnificent to behold; it extended its, branches far anid near, which made a beautiful shade. On this tree hung a vast quantity' of co- coanuts. He then asked me to sit down under this tree, when he said, ' Maria, you see this beau- tiful valley and all these splendid and magnificent trees that cover it, and all those beautiful and magnificent birds that are singing melodious, with voices of every sound, and they are singing praises  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7685-00000130"/> 252      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF and glory to God, Maria; and' he continued, 'ought not we poor mortals to praise and honor and glorify our God and Saviour, when he permits us with our mortal eyes to behold such glory? what shall we behold when this mortal puts on immortality, and the Almighty giveth us our spiritual eyes to behold spiritually? what shall we behold then? We shall behold our blessed Saviour as he is, with all his glory and honor and might and power and dominion; also, we shall behold all the heavenly hosts singing praises to God Almighty, and the Lamb who redeem- ed us by his precious blood. O, Maria, Maria, my dear Maria, how happy shall we be if it be our blessed lot to enter into that rest, where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest. When I look, Maria, on the beauty that is before -us in this valley, it makes me abhor myself in dust and ashes; it makes me cry out as one of old, 0h, wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of sin! Maria, my dear Maria, the finger of God is here to-day, and the glory of God shines around us; now let us fall down on our knees and implore the Almighty for his kind protection, and give thanks unto him for saving us from a watery grave, while many of our fellow-mortals are gone to a world of spirits.' We then fell down on our knees, and Mr. Russell -lifted up his voice to the Almighty. We were on our knees more than an hour I believe, and I never heard such a prayer before in my life, and I never had such feelings. ' He then said, 'Maria, we will go back to our cabin, and as we walked back, we still saw the dead   DAVID RUSSELL.       25a bodies dashing about on the beach as before; at rength we reached the cabin. Mr. Russell then com- menced singing and praising God, and he sung beau- tiful, so that he made the groves ring. He then said, 'Maria, be of good cheer, let not your spirits fail; for our heavenly Father will not put on us more than we can bear, nor permit us to stay long on this deso- late island, for he will find some way for our escape.' I was famishing for the want of water, and burning up with a raging fever, for it was excessive hot indeed; and Mr. Russell tried all over the island to get water for me, and could find none. I said, ' Mr. Russell, I shall die ,for the want of water, for I am burning up with fever!' he said, ' my dear Maria, I know you are suffering for the want of water, and I will use my best endeavors to get you water.' At this I laid down on the bunk, and Mr. Russell- said, ' I will go and hunt agair for water for you.' He left me laying on the bunk, and as I listened between the sounds of the birds, I heard his voice lifted up in prayer to God. I then fell asleep; I don't know how long I slept, but I had a beautiful sound sleep. When I awoke, I 'beheld Mr. Russell by my bunk side on his knees, with his head leaning on my bunk, and he was praying in a low voice, so as not to wake me up. After he got up off his knees, he said, ' Maria, how do you feel? ' 0O Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, I feel much better! ' He said, my dear Maria, do you think you can walk a little way with me? ' I said, ' Yes.' Accordingly we walked down to the grove, and when we got in the grove Mr. Russell said to me, ' Now Maria, I must go and dig a well here;'  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7685-00000131"/> 254      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF at this he got a flat piece of stone, and he went to work. The ground was soft, sandy and loamy, and he soon dug the well. His shirt was as wet with sweat as if it had been dipped in the ocean, aqnd the sweat poured off him like rain. Now this well was dug in the centre of a beautiful orange grove, and after he had got the well dug he went and carried sea shells from the beach and walled it up beautifully. O, pa, my eyes never beheld such a beautiful well as that was, for the shell shone like crystal diamonds, and there was every shade, and it was done so accu- rate, and every shell fitted to its own place, it formed such a true circle no mathematician could beat it; never, never shall I forget the splendor of that well; and after he had finished and completed it, he said, ' Maria, my dear Maria, you see that well; there is no water 'in it now.' 'Yes, Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, I do see it, and you have labored and' toiled hard to dig it, and bring those shells over the rocks-towall it up, and it certainly looks beautifully; and, Mr. Russell, do you think that you will ever have any water there? ' ' Yes, Maria, my dear Maria, by tomorrow morning that well will be running over, and you will see, Maria, that well will boil up, and a continuing stream be running out of it; may God grant it, for our sakes, for surely we want water bad enough.' He then said7 ' Maria, we will fall down on our knees and pray to the Almighty to give us water and fill this well, for I have faith to believe in God that whatever you ask from him, having faith and fervent prayer, and a clean heart, and a right spirit, that he will perform and give us those things   DAVID RUSSELL.       255 we ask for, and know we need. So now, my dear Maria, let us fall down and ask for those things in fervent prayver, having faith with it, that he will give us such things as we stand in need of.' At this we fell down on our knees by the side of the well, and -Mr. Russell lifted up his voice to God Almighty, and implored him that he would give us such things as we stood in need of; that he would give us water and bread, so that we need not die on that desolate island, but live to praise him; and that he would cause in this well a spring of water, so that the mariners when they passed by might get water to drink, and all that comes on the island might get water to cool their parched ttngues. Yes, pa, and he made a very long prayer indeed, and many, many things did he pray for, and many times did he request that the JLord would make some way of escape for us speedily from that desolate island. The birds of every kind and color were flying around us, lighting on our heads and shoulders, and singing melodiously while at- prayer. He then comes to me and takes me by the hand, saying, ' Maria, be of good cheer; let not your spirits fail you; believe in God, having faith in him, and you will have water in abundance by tomorrow morning; and by tomorrow noon you will have bread enough and to spare.' He then took his knife out of his pocket, and went to a large and beautiful tree; he cut the American standard on it, and it looked beautiful; he then engraved his name on the bottom, --David Russell, the young and true American. He then cut my name, Maria Lischia; he then cut on it that we two were the only survivors of the wreck of  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7685-00000132"/> 256      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF the New London, that was wrecked on such a date; he also cut on it the day and place of his birth, and the name of the state ; he also cut on many different trees, splendid to read. Now pa and ma, if we had such a well as that in our garden, I would give a thousand francs to-day. Pa, with all the splendor you have in your garden, you have nothing to be compared to that well. Now pa, Mr. Russell never was idle, from the time we landed on that island till we left it; for he was either fixing something for me, or cutting calabashes for the use of the cabin, or cutting verses, or he was in prayer or singing, and he never was idle. "Early the next morning we arose and went to the well, and Mr. Russell took a calabash along that he had prepared the day before. At length we arrived at the well, and to my astonishment-the well was running over and a, stream running out of it; it appeared to be boiling up with clear, pure water. Mr. Russell took the calabash and dipped it in and gave it to me, telling me not to drink too much for it might hurt me if I did. Mr. Russell fell down and gave thanks to God for his kindness in sending us water. Mr. Russell said to me, ' Maria, my dear, -now you see the Almighty has sent us plenty of water and that which is good, and before noon we will have bread enough and to spare.' Now pa, we had passed three days and three nights without eating or drinking, and the fourth morning we got the water; after we drank what we wanted we returned back to the cabin. Mr. Russell said to me, ' Now, Maria, I must go on.-board the vessel   DAVID RUSSELL.       257 right off.' I said to him,' What, Mr. Russell, are i you going to leave me here to die alone?' He said, ' No, Maria, my dear, I am not going to lea;e you to die alone, but I am going to get you something to eat, that you may live and not die.' I replied, ' Well, Mr. Russell, I will go with you!' He said to me, ' Maria, it will take longer to fix a raft for you to go on than it would take me -to go there, and I have nothing to fix a raft with.' - Mr. Russell then tried to prevail on me to stop, but I told him, that I would go with him. He said, ' Maria, my dear Maria, let me prevail on you not to think about going, for it is impossible' for you to go, as I have othing to make a raft of.' I then said ' Mr. Russell, you can never reach the ship.' He replied, ' Maria, my dear, I swam from the ship with you and a raft in tow, and IJam sure I can' go to it without any thing.' At this he leaped into the sea and swam off like a fish, and I roared out, 'You wicked wretch, to go away and leave me here to die alone!' but he kept swimming away like a fish, and I kept screaming at the top of my voice. At last I saw him get on board of the vessel; he was out of my sight a little while, and the next I saw of him he came on deck and showed me a-large ham and some bread, and I beckoned to him to come back. I then saw him making a raft, and at last he got his things all on the raft and swam and pulled them to shore. When he got to shore he showed me all he had got; he had brought provisions and bread and meat and tea, coffee, sugar, wine, cooking utensils, and every thing heart could  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7685-00000133"/> 258      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF wish, and also a gun, and a pair of horse pistols, and a sword, and some ammunition to keep away our enemies; and what pleased me better than all was, that he had brought my trunk, with all I had in it; some one thousand francs were in it, and all my jewelry, so I lost nothing; but Mr. Russell lost all he had in two large trunks, which amounted to upwards of five thousand francs. I said, '0, my dear Mr. Russell, I ask your pardon ten thousand times for what I said when you left me on the beach i' and Mr. Russell replied, 'Oh, Maria, my dear, I did not mind any thing you said, for I know you felt very bad, indeed.' We then went and got something to eat, and Mr. Russell allowanced me out for fear I would eat too much and overload my stomach, not having eaten any thing for three days, and he told me if I eat what I wanted I would -be dead in twenty minutes after. We, then went to the south-east part of the island, which was a point that extended in the sea a good distance from  the body of the island, and Mr. Russell cut a large bamboo and tied my shawl on half-mast high and planted it. Then Mr. Russell told me that there would be a vessel come by in a few days, and they would see that flag hoisted half-mast high, and it would be the means of causing them to send a boat. We then returned back to the cabin. The next morning, after we had -got breakfast, we went down to the flag-staff, and Mr. Russell looked all around. He said he thought he saw a -sail, but when he looked through his spy-glass he could see nothing. We then returned back to the ,cabin, and we walked *   \ ! , DAVID RUSSELL.       259 around' the groves and through the island, and passed the day away; then we returned back to the cabin and took- some refreshment and retired to our bed. The next morning we arose. and after breakfast we went down to the flag-staff again; after looking all around, Mr. Russell said he thought he saw a sail, and told me to sit down while he went up on the rocks and took a clear observation. He remained a little while and then came down and told me he saw a vessel, and he thought it was making for the Narrows; he said he' had no doubt but what that was the vessel that would take us off the island. We then returned back to the cabin, and in due time the vessel took us off the island and landed us safe in Paris. "Now, pa and ma, no tongue can tell my feelings that I had on that island; death would have been relief to me; and had it not been for Mr. Russell, I should have died any way, for he cheered my drooping soul; he watched over me day and night; he fixed refreshments for me when I could not raise my head from the pillow that he made for me of cocoanut husks; and he comforted me when I was tired of my life, and risked his own life three times for me to- my own knowledge; he prayed to my God day and night for me, that I might be rescued from that desolate island, and restored safe back 'to my father's house again; he got all my property at the risk of his life, and he risked his life to save mine when he saw a few minutes more would launch me into eternity.

Now, my dear parents, a few more words and I am done. You ought to thank him ten thousand times for ever seeing me; and my dear parents, you need not trouble yourselves in respect to getting me a partner, nor you need not give those gentlemen any encour- agement, for I shall never have any thing to say to any of them. No, no, I shall never have any thing to say to any man on God's footstool but the one I have chosen, for he is a man, indeed; he is a man of valor, he is a man of honor and a man of principle, he is a man of love and kindness, lie is a man that fears not the face of clay, for he has the God of heaven for his shield and battle axe, and in him lhe puts all his trust. Had lie not, you would never have seen me; he is a man whose equal I never saw, and he is a young and true Amer- ican. Now my dear parents, there is no man on this globe that I prefer before this young American; and, my dear parents, had you been placed in the situa- tion I was, to have found such a friend as I found you would all but worshiped him; a man to do what he done for a strange woman, one that he never saw but once or twice before! No mortal man could have done more, for he risked his life to save mine, and done every thing man could do to make me 'happy; he labored and toiled in the hot scorching sun with- out a hat on his head, or a coat on his back, trying to get roots and water for me to subsist on, where many a man would lay down and let us both die; and then you would never have beheld me again. Now iy dear parents, you ought to treat Mr. Russell with the   DAVID RUSSELL.       261  highest respect and kindness, for he has done more for you than ever your own. son could have done for you, and myself, and all I have are his, and he is mine."' I remained there about three weeks, and during that time there was a Frenchman come to pay his respects to her. He had formed a slight correspond- ence with her before she went to England, and her parents were very'anxious for him to have her. He came one evening to pay his addresses to her, and I went into another room. Maria soon came in and said, "Mr. Russell, that man is come here by my parents' request to pay his addresses to me, and I tell you how I will fix him. You go up stairs and don't let him see you, and I will soon give him the slip and be up too, and leave him there." Accordingly we did so. There was to be a large ball at the Lafayette house, which was the largest hotel in Paris; it was called the navy and army ball, and there were a great many private gentlemen invited to attend. I was invited to the ball, and certainly it was the most splendid ball that I ever was at. They had a whole army band of excellent musicians, and the ball was opened with two double cotillons. There were cushioned seats all around the room, and we all sat down. We were all called up in our turn; I was called to dance the second cotillon, and after we were all on the floor in our proper places, the band struck up and played splendidly, and the cotillon was carried out in good style. We then all sat down, and while myself and my partner were talking, there was ,a gentleman f,9       4   &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7685-00000135"/> 262      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF stepped up and saluted me, and shook hands with me. Said he, "Mr. Russell, how do you do?" I replied, "Sir, you have the' advantage of me, for really I cannot recognize you.'" "What," said he, " don't you know the captain?" "What," said I, "the captain that brought us from the island?" "Yes," said he, "I am the man!" Well," he continued, "Miss Lischia, you have got the right kind of a man, and he is a splendid dancer." Maria said, "Yes, captain, he is good at any thing." By this time the refreshments were served up; after that we were invited in to supper, and certainly it was a splendid supper indeed. After supper we were invited back to the ball room, and I was then called out; my ticket requested me to take the lead, and accordingly I did. After we got through, a num- ber of ladies and gentlemen gathered around Maria and me. Most of them were acquainted with Maria, and one of them said, "We saw a piece in the paper concerning your shipwreck, and of you being saved by a young American." "Yes," said Maria, "I was." "The paper states that you were three days and three nights without eating or drinking, and after the young man had got water for you, he swam to the ship and got provisions for you, and that he risked his life three or four times for you, and also watched over you day and night while you were sick, and also prayed to God that you might be restored safe back to your father's house; all those things and a great   DAVID RUSSELL.       263 many more, we don't recollect, were in the paper; well, he is a fine looking young man." By this time a good many dancers were going home. I said to Maria, "Shall I have the carriage brought up?" "Yes, Mr. Russell, and we will go home." I then went down and ordered the carriage. While we were going home, I said, "Maria, my dear, how did you like the ball?" She replied, "I think it was splendid indeed, and elegantly got up. Mr. Russell, you are a splendid dancer indeed; I did not think you could dance as well as you do; every one took notice of you. If you would stay in Paris, you would be invited to a good many balls." "Well, Maria, I don't calculate to stay long in Paris; my calculation is to go to Rome, as soon as possible." "Well, Mr. Russell, I shall go with you.". "'I should be very happy indeed to have you go along, and I think it will be the best thing you canl do, Maria, for I don't think you will have much hap- piness if you stay in Paris." Accordingly from that time we began to make pre- parations to go to Rome. Maria's parents had made a great party, and invited all their friends far and near to rejoice over their returned daughter. Accord- ingly they all came at the appointed time, and it was a splendid party indeed. They all congratulated and sympathized with Maria for the sufferings and misfor- tunes she had gone through. "Ah," said Maria, my dear friends and relations, r  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7685-00000136"/> 234      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF you sympathize for me, but what ought you to do for my preserver and protector; and how ought you feel towards one that laid his life down for me! Yes, and more than once or twice, three times to my own knowledge, did he lay down his life for me ; yea, and he labored and toiled day and night for me, and he watched over me like a mother would over her infant when I was burning up with a raging fever, and all but distracted; it was he alone that did watch over me day and night, and comfort my drooping spirit; he lifted up his voice to God Almighty in my behalf, and for me day and night did he supplicate the Lord and offer up his prayer in my behalf, that I might be rescued from that desolate island, and that I might be restored safe back to my father's house. Yea, and there is not a grove or'place on that island, but what has witnessed his prayers for me, that I -might be restored safe back to my father's house. Yea, he cleaved the rock for water for me, where there was no sign of water, to cool my parched tongue, wlien it was burning up with fever, and he obtained water in abundance; he also risked his life in swimming to the ship to obtain bread for me, and did obtain bread and every thing else to make me. comfortable. He also obtained my property, and all I had in the world did lie obtain for me, and brought it to me and deliv- ered it up safe and sound. You may talk about,men, but indeed I never saw a true man till I saw Mr. Russell, for lie is a man indeed, in every shape, full of love and kindness, friendship and humanity. Now my dear friends and relations, I have only told you a small part of what Mr. Russell has done for me. In-   DAVID RUStSLL        265 deed, it would take me may days to tell you all that he has done for me. My d,r-I/iends and relations, suppose you were left in, the same situation that I was left in; five minutes more would have launched me into eternity, had it not been for Mr. Russell; what would you think to meet with such a friend at that precious moment? Will not a man give all he hath for his life; and would not you do the same? My dear friends, let me tell you it is not me that you ought to congratulate, for -none of you would have ever seen me in this world had -Mr. Russell withheld his hand five minutes longer; but he dived like a fish after me when the billows were rolling mountain high over us, and he caught me and secured me by'a rope. My dear friends and relations, I do say- in the pres- ence of you all, that all I have in this world is his, and I am  his, and he is mine till death doth us part." After this we were invited to a splendid supper. The table was very elegantly decorated, and every thing on it that heart could wish. We were invited to our chairs at the table, each one at his place, Maria and myself sat along side of each other., - After supper was over, we were invited back.,to the sitting-room, when they began to ask Maria ques- tions about the island and shipwreck. Most of the conversatioin was in French. Maria:talked a long time with them, and after a long conversation'we retired to bed.  After we had got up stairs, Maria and I had a long/conversation. I told Maria I should be ready to leave in -a very few days for Rome, and' if she wished to go along With me, to have every thing 12  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7685-00000137"/> 26t;      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF ready so as to go at a moment's notice. We then retired to bed. Early next morning we arose, and after breakfast Maria orderied the carriage- to be brought up. Maria camne down stairs, and we got in the carriage and drove off. We rode to the Lafayette Hotel, where we stopped a little while; after that we got in the carriage, and drove around the levee. As we drove along I took 'notice of the shipping laying there, and I saw a ship lay outside of all the rest; her name was Napoleon, and she had her flag hoisted at her foremast head; it said on the flag, "For Rome," at such a date, which brought it about three days from that day. I then said to Maria, "My dear, look, do you see that ship?" "Which one do you mean, Mr. Russell '?" "The one that has the blue flag." 'Yes," he said "I do." I said, "Read the letters on the flag." Accordingly she read them. "Why," said she, "Mr. Russell, that ship leaves in three days, accord- ing to that." "Yes," said I, ' she will leave in three days from to-day. Now, Maria, I tell you what we will do; you must give orders to your driver to take good care of his horses and carriage, and-we will get iin a boat, and go on board of her." Accordingly she agreed to it; we then left the carriage, and went into a ferry boat, and were taken on board the ship. We met the captain on the quarter deck; I said, "Good morning, captain." "Good morning, sir," he replied. "I see, by your colors, you are bound for Rome.'   DAVID RUSSELL.      267 "Yes, sir, we are bound for Rome in about three days." "Well, captain, we would like to take a passage with you, if it is convenient for you to take us." "Yes, sir, I can take you and your lady." He then invited us down into the cabin, and he showed us the cabin all through, and desired us to pick our berths. I picked out our berths, and took passage for three. The Napoleon was a ship of 600 tons burden, and she was splendidly fitted up. I told the captain we would be on board the morning she left; we then Went on shore, and got in the car- riage, and we drove around and  athwart through Paris, and examined the city all over; I found it to be a splendid city, having handsome buildings, and well arranged, with beautifil wide streets. It is a very large city, and there are splendid public build- ings; the King's Palace is splendid to behold. After thoroughly examining the city, we drove home; after dinner we retired to our room, when I said, "Well, Maria, how do you feel about going to Rome?" "Mr. Russell," she replied, c I feel well; I could go to the end of the earth with you, for- I could be happy with you any where; no one could help being happy with you, for you have such a kind, cheerful way; you can cheer the heart of the drooping spirit, and you can join heartily with those that make merry; you can tell tales and history that will make mirth for hundreds; yea, and you are good company for any one, and the more I  see you, and get ac- quainted, the better I like you.- You have such a   &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7685-00000138"/> 268      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OP kind, winning way with you, that no one could help liking you, and every one takes notice of it." "' Now Maria, my dear Maria, I want you to be ready at a moment's warning; do every thing you have to do, and if I can do any. hing to help you I will do it, if you let me know.' "Well, now, Mr. Russell, there is one thing that has got to be considered; you are better acquainted with the banks than I am, anld I want you to do as if you were doing for yourself."' "Well, Maria, what is it you want done, .my dear?" ' I want my money matters fixed, so that I can draw money at any place where I am." "Well, Maria, that is very easily accomplished; in the first place, Maria, my dear, you must take your motney and deposit it in the Bank of France; then get a receipt, and a copy of the charter, and rules of the bank; then get a bank book, with one-half of bills of exchange, and the other half for daily business."            "Well, Mr. Russell, I shall depend on you to at- tend to the business." - u Well, Maria, I. will attend to it, but you will have to go along with me."       , "Certainly, Mr. Russell, I calculate to go with you, for I don't calculate to let you go any where without me."  Accordingly the carriage was brouglt up, and the box of money, which required two men to lift -it, was put in the carriage. We- then drove to the Metrop- ' olis Bank, and had the money taken in. After the    DAVID RUSSELL.       269 money was counted and receipted for, and a copy of the charter and a bank book given us, with one-half hills of exchange, and the other hlalf for daily busi- ness, we returned home. We then made all prepara- tions to go on board the vessel. Maria told her parents she was going with me; her father and mother said to her, "You have-been away from us a long time, and are you going to leave us so soon after coming back?" She said she was going with Mr. Russell when he went, and he was going to leave tomorrow. The old gentleman and lady then began to weep. Maria then said to thlem, "My dear parents, home is no more home to me; it was once a home to me, but now I take no comfort in it. I am opposed in every thing, and must nlot be compelled, to do that which I don't want to do, nor won't do; the young man who has been my guide and protector throughout all my trials and difficulties, and troubles and dangers, and has saved me from a  watery grave,-him wliom you ought to love, to cherish, and not refuse any thing,-you', lhave utterly denied him, and utterly rejected him.

Now he has asked you for her whom lie loves as lie loves his own soul, when he has a  good right to her, for he gained her by risking his life: for her, and this is he whom you would rejoice to-day to see shot down in your own door-yard, or in your ownl house; and this is he who is in danger-of  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7685-00000139"/> 270      AUTOBIOGRAPH lY OF his life every hour he is in your house, and all this is to repay him for his kindness.

Now, my dear parenits, I shall leave you tomorrow morning, and I shall bid you farewell ; it may be for years--it may be forever,-and it is all your own fault, for Mr. Russell was willing to havestaid here with- you, and take good care' of you, and every thing you had, had you let him had me, and a kinder or better man is not in the world; he has dohe that for me that no other mortal man would, do, and he is a man of honor, and as true an American as ever drew a sword, and will lose the last drop'of blood in his body for his rights; and if you would bring all the men in Paris' before him, you could not make him surrender his riglit, for 'he would die first, and he would not die -alone. If you knew him as well as I do, you would not act the way you do." - Maria then left them, and we retired to our room. "Well, Maria," said I, "I like to see you stand'up for your rights, for 1 glory in every one having their rights. Maria, my dear 'Maria, I had no idea, when I talked to your parents the morning I brought you to them, that they ever could have acted so strange as they have towards you, and all because you would not marry a man that y'ou never loved, and amain that cared nought about you, only to get your-pro- perty."   DAVID RUSSELL.       27 We sat and talked a little while, when we were called to supper; after supper we went and sat down in the sitting-room, and the Frenchman came to pay his addresses to Maria, as usual, by her parents' re- quest. After he sat down Maria left the room, when he and the old gentleman commenced talking in French. They thought, I being an American, I could snot understand what they said, but I under- stood all they said. He asked the old gentleman what was the reason lhis, daughter treated him so coolly, and he told him I was the cause of it all, for his daughter was so infatuated with me that she. would not listen to what he said to her. They both commenced to ridicule me so, that I got up and went out. I walked out in the garden, and I had not been out long before the Frenchman came out; I was walking backward and forward, to try to overcome my feelings, and as I was walking up the path he came up to me, and pushed himself against me, as much as to say I was of no account; and as he pushed me one. side lie called me in French, " You, damned toad." I then said, "Sir, what do you mean by insulting me in this way? Do' you think, because I am a stranger, that I will put up with your insults? No, sir! I would die before I would be insulted by any Frenchman in Paris, and if you want satisfaction, take it honorably." ' Having a pair of pistolt well loaded on my belt around me, I took them out and handed him one, "NSow,2 said I, " if you are ai man, take one, and !  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7685-00000140"/> 272      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF pace your ground! I am your manl!" but he re- fused to take it, and began to make an apology. Maria, hearing the loud words, came out and took me by the arm, and said, "Come with me, Mr. Rus- sell, and don't mind him, for lie is not worth mind- ing." We went in the house, and retired to our sitting- room; I said to Maria, "The quicker we leave here the better; for as to be insulted by these Frenchmen, I will not; I will die first. So now Maria, my dear, I want to leave here early in the morning, for I am sick of staying here, seeing the treatment that yoiu have received from those that you ought to have re- ceived the best of treatment from; and myself, one that has done all that any living soul could do for them, to treat me in' the manner they have treated me, when they ought to have treated me with the highest respect and the highest esteem! So now, Maria, I want you to be ready to leave early in the morning." "Yes, Mr. Russell, I feel as bad as you do about it, but I cannot help it; and I know you ought to have received better treatment; one that has done as much for me and my folks as you have! But never mind, Mr. Russell, you have got one that will treat you well as long as you live, and will-ever prove true and kind to you, and it is her whom you love as your own soul, and your love is not in vain, for she' whom you loveti loves you with allher heart, and all her soul, and all her mind, and all her strength, and all she has in the world!" Accordingly we parted, and retired to bed; early   DAVID RUSSELL.       273 next morning we arose, and after breakfast prepared to go on board the ship; we bid them all farewell, and left them. As we were going to the ship, we called and got Maria's servant-girl, and after we got on board we retired to our cabin; then I said, "Well,  Maria, we have got landed safe on board of the Na- poleon, and I hope and trust the Lord will give us a prosperous journey to Rome; Maria, it will be some time before we shall again see Paris." "Yes, Mr. Russell, I think it will, if you go the route you intend." "Well, Maria, I have started to go, and with the help of the Lord, and his guide and protection, I will go the journey." "Well, Mr. Russell, I feel happy with you wher- ever you' go; and I calculate to go with you, if it's the Lord's will."  "Well, Maria, my dear, I think you and I will see many happy days together, although our introduc- tion was very severe." By this time the bell rung for dinner, and we had a splendid dinner, after which we returned to our cabin. We were not long on board before the ship started, and in a short time we cleared the harbor; we were going through the water at a lively rate, and the captain ordered studding sails to be set, alow. and aloft. I said, "Maria, my dear, we are on the way once more, with a fair and pleasant breeze; now, Maria, we must pray to the Almighty for his: guidance and protection through the deep, and to bring us safe into port.'- "O! my dear Mr. Russell," she replied, "how 12*   &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7685-00000141"/> 274      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF happy do I feel, and how can I feel any other way when I hear such kind talk as I hear? O! Mr. Rus- sell, Mr. Russell, it is heaven below to be in your company; Mary already has taken notice of you." '"Maria, my dear, kindness will do a great deal; little did you think, Maria, when you saw me first, when I landed you on the island, having on nothing but a pair of loose .pants and a shirt,--not even a hat on my head,-little did you think the riches I pos- sessed in honor and principle, had faith for a pilot for it." "Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, I want to tell you something that comes to my mind; you recol- lect, Mr. Russell, the time you had me in your arms on the wreck, holding me in your t -ns as a mother would a-baby--you recollect moving the locks of my hair from my eyes, and Wiping my face with your handkerchief? I then awoke, as if it were out of a trance; I looked up into your face earnestly, and your eyes appeared to me like diamonds,-and your face appeared to me like the face of an angel. O!

At length the bell rung for supper, and we were invited to the table. After supper we went back to the cabin, when I said to Maria, "Well, my dear, it seems we have still got a fair wind, and we are going through the water very, lively; I hope the Lord will give us a prosperous and pleasant voyage, and will guide us safe into port. Maria, my dear, I am think- ing of what has passed in the short time that you and I have been acquainted; it is not two months yet" since I first landed in Jamaica, and in a short time I went on board of the New London; little did you know' my feelings at that time, although my counte- nance was like a blooming rose in the midst of sum- mer, and my dark blue eyes shone like two diamonds; Maria, my dear, little did you know the feeling of my heart, when I looked on you as I came on board, and thought on my dear Maria, that I left in Edin- burgh. It seems it was the will of the Almighty that I should come ohn board, to save you from a watery grave and now Maria, my dear Maria, when I think of these things, and the mercy of God that attended them, it makes my very heart and soul rejoice in God my Saviour, and cry out, '0 God, 0 God, thy mercy endureth forever, and of thy loving- kindness, O God, there is no end; for thou hast bound up the broken hearted, and them that were weak and weary thou hast strengthened, and them that were, in the very jaws of 'death thou hast res- coedl.

Amen, and amen.'" I can't find words to express my feelings that I had at that time. "My dear Maria, it was about a month before that time that I buried my bride, on the day of the intended wedding, when the marriage supper was prepared, and the house was filled with guests, invited to thei wedding. My dear bride, Priscilla Rlissell, departed her life, and all tlat had come to attend her wedding attended her funeral." I then went on and told Maria the whole story, and she wept like a child; after this we went to prayer, and retired to bed. Early next morning we arose and gave thanks to the Almighty for his protection through the night, and prayed that he might con- 'tinue-his blessings towards us through this voyage, and' bring us safe into port. Shortly after this we were called into breakfast, after which we retired to our cabin. Soon Maria and myself, and the' girl, went on deck; we had a fair wind still, and a glo- rious breeze, and we were going through the water' at the rate of twelve knots an hour. I said, "Maria, my dear, this is a beautiful breeze: we have now; how beautifully every sail fills. - The Arabs in Arabia, my dear, say there is only one thing handsomer than a ship in full sail." "And what is that, my dear? ." "Well, my dear, it is a handsome wyoman! Maria, don't it look beautiful -indeed, to see all those sails? How beautiful they swell out with the breeze!.  "' Yes, Mr. Russell, certainly they look beautiftul   DAvID RUSSELL.       2" indeed; there is a great contrast between the looks of those sails and the New London's, when she was struck with a gale of wind; when her sails were split in pieces, and the ropes, and blocks and sails bounded over the yards, and the yards were breaking in pieces, and the royal topgallant mast broke, and came down with the yards. The worst of it was, we could not behold the Fails as we behold these, for the thick fog came upon us, that we could rot see our hands before us, and at that time every soul was on deck. To our sad misfortune, you recollect well what struck us; that' mighty sea swept our decks clean, and, Mr. Russell, I never recollect any thing from that time, till I found myself in your arms.'" ' Yes, Maria, my dear, that was a- mighty sea in- deed that struck us; but it seems, Maria, for all that great sea that struck us, and the mighty winds that blew such a gale, and that- tremendous fog, that you could almost cut with a knife,-Maria, my dear, still, for all those things we had to encounter, our kind, heavenly Father brought us through all those trials, and difficulties, and dangers, and not the hair of our heads was hurt, while all the rest of our fellow mortals were doomed to a watery grave; not one left to tell the tale but you and me. OO! Maria, Maria, my dear Maria, what manner of persons ought we to be, when we have a dear Saviour to bring us through all those trials and difficulties? Ought we not to fall down before him, and. give thanks unto him, and praise, and honor and glory, might and dominion, and say,' O!1 mighty God, thou art a mer- ciful God indeed'! '" .

' Yes' sir, I was ; we- wre both on it."  ' My paper gives, a dreadful account of it; it says all were lost, not a soul was saved; and speaks of the storm, and the very heavy gale, and the thick fog, and the heavy sea; and it says when that sea struck her, it swept the decks of every one." "Well, captain, it did not sweep the decks of every one, but it came very near it; for we two re- mained on, and, by exertions and hard trials, and oby the blessing of God and his protection, we were res- cued from a; watery grave." y -  W Well, Mr. Russell, it was a miracle indeed, how you were saved." "Yes, captain, it was nothing but the mercy of God that saved us; but, captain, that God that searches the heart, and knoweth the mind of all flesh, would not permit us to be lost, nor the hair of our head to be hurt. O, captain, and what a mer- ciful God is ours! and what manner of men ought we to be when we have such a kind, heavenly Father!"  Atlthis the captain left, to attend to the trimming of the sails.

"That, island, Mr, -Russell, is called Napoleon's Island; that island is about one hundred- miles froln Rome.  I suppose you have read the history of Napoleon Bonaparte, Mr. Russell? You look like a -man of good information." "Yes, sir, I have indeed read the history .,of Na- poleon Bonaparte, several times, and studied it con- siderable."                 "Well, Mr. Russell, you recollect when Napoleon took his army to Rome?" 's Yes, sir, I recollect it well.", "You recollect of some-kind of a plague getting among his army at that time?"  ' Yes, sir, I do recollect it." "Well, at that time he moved his army from" the shipping, and encamped on that isla  nd, and that island was called Napoleon's Island from that time." -- Captain, when do you think we will get to Rome?"

Maria then' said, "Captainl, Mr. Russell trusted wholly in his heavenly Father; he don't trust in the arm of flesh for any thing; he putteth all his depen- dence in God, his Saviour. He has faith in him, and in him alone doth hle put his trust. He says his heavenly Father has brought him through many trials and difficulties, and has never forsaken him yet; and, captain, we are now nearly at our jour- ney's end, and let me tell you, captain, that myself and my maid, and your cabin, has witnessed the prayers of Mr. Russell for your prosperity, and safe landing in port, night and morning." "Well, I knew from the first sight I saw of Mr. Russell, that morning he came on board to engage his passage, that there was something in him more than I ever saw in any other person, for his face was lit up with such a lively countenance, and his eyes shone to me like diamonds, and he had such a lively and active way with him, and such a polite manner of talking, and his words were so sensible and so re- markable, that I never shall forget them." Maria said, "Captain, if you knew Mr. Russell as well as I do;, you would not wonder 'at all these things; and knew what great faith he has inl his Saviour!' for, captain, when we had been on that island three days and three nights withouteating bread or drinking water, and the -sun was pouring down on us enough to burn us up, it was then, cap- tain,: that Mr.- Russell's faith was tried and proved,   DAVID RUSSELL.       281 when death stared us in the face, with starvation and drought all around us. Mr. Russell then said, 'My dear Maria, cheer up your drooping spirit, and not let your spirits fall, for our heavenly Father will not put more on us than we can bear.' He then struck up and sung the hundredth Psalm, and made the orange groves ring with his voice; after he sang he then fell down on his knees and prayed to his heavenly Father, and another such a prayer I never witnessed, for he was on his knees more than an hour; and when he arose from his knees he came and took me by the hand, and his countenance looked to me like the countenance of an angel. He said, ' Maria, my dear Maria, be of good cheer, and cheer up, for our prayer is answered, and we shall have water in abundance, and bread enough, and to spare ;' and, captaiii, in all the trials and troubles that we had on the island, Mr: Russell- was just as lively as you see him to-day, and felt like a man in a palace ; for he said that he knew that his God would deliver him from that desolate island, and that speedily. Now, captain, I tell you, lwherever Mr. Russell is, or whatever situation of life he is in, he is blessed, and a shower of blessings is poured on him. Iknow, captain, it is not his own prayers alone that are offered up; but there are many prayers offered up for his safety and protection. And that is not all; his faith is so great and strong in his God aiid Saviour, that he will deliver him from all trials and difficulties, and temptations; and he says he knows his Saviour will never forsake him." The captain then said he was satisfied that there ?- , %  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7685-00000145"/> 282      AUTOBIOGRAPHY O OF was something more than common about him.

AFTER supper we returned to our room; I then said, "Well, Maria, my dear, we are safe landed in Rome, now we must make the best use of our time while we are here. Tomorrow, my dear, we will go around and examine every part in the city of any note, for I don't wish to stay in Rome long, and I wish to get away as soon as possible. Now, Maria, we will go to prayers and- retire to bed. We sung a hymn, and then went to prayer, and retired to bed. Early next morning we arose; after that we went to prayers, and gave thanks for the protection through the night. Maria said, "Mr. Russell, what time will you be ready to go around the city?" "That depends on you, Maria, my dear; when- ever you are ready, I am at your service; I think we had better go as quick as we get our breakfast, and I think, Maria my dear, you had better get ready so that we may start immediately after we get our breakfast."  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7685-00000146"/> 284      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF  Accordingly she fixed herself, and got ready. Soon after this *e were invited to breakfast, after which I had the carriage brought up, and we got in the carriage and drove around the city. We examined all the chief places in ithe city ;St. Peter's Church, the Pope's palace, and all his gardens and walks, liis bowers and parks. After this we examined all the nunneries, and all the large academies and schools of all kinds. 'Ifh fact, we examined every place in the city of any note. The city of Rome is built partly on a hill, and partly in a valley; the city is built on a bed of bitumen. The uppet- town is splen- did to behold; the buildings are well arranged, and built in splendid order. In the lower town and suburbs the buildings are wonderfully scattered; most of the buildings are low and scattered. The old settlers of Rome, when I came to talk with them, told' me'that fire often broke out from the side hill, and in many parts of the city, from the bituminous nature of the soil; and they told me that old men had 'propllesied that some time the bitumen would catch fire, and burn up the city. After we had gone the rounds, I said to Maria that we had better go home; we then went back to the hotel. 'Soon after we returned we were 'called to dinner, after which we retired to our,-room. I then said to Maria, "My dear, what do you think of Rome?" "Well," said she, "I have heard a great deal- of talk about Rome, and I expected to have found a much more splendid place than what it is ; in, fact I think -it is a very inferior city, particularly for one   DAVID RUSSELL.       285 that is talked so much about. There are a few buildings in. it, which look very well." "Well, -Maria my dear, I am perfectly satisfied with Rome, and I don't want to stay longer in it. We will take a ride around the levee tomorrow, and see if we. can find a vessel going to Palermo,: and if we find one we will take our passage." The next morning I got the carriage, arid we rode around the levee. We found a brig that was going the next day to Palermo, and I took passage for three. Early next morning, after breakfast, we went down and got on board the brig; soon after we got on board, the brig got under way, and steered for Palermo. In a few davs we arrived at the city of Palermo; we took a carriage, and drove up to the city, and put up at a large hotel. After I had taken our rooms we retired to them; we had not been there long before we were invited to supper. After supper we retired to our rooms, and I said, "Well, Maria, tomorrow we must go around and see Palermo." "Well, Mr. Russell, I think more of Palermo, what little I have seen of it, than I do of Rome." "Well, Maria my dear, we will know more about it tomorrow, when we go through it." ' Soon after this we went to prayers, and then re- tired to bed; early next morning we arose, and made preparations to go around: the town, and I: said, "Maria, my dear, whenever you are ready   I will have the carriage brought;" and I had the carriage brought,.up immediately. Accordingly Maria was, ready, and we got in- the carriage, and drove around the city.

The city of Palermo is situated on a beautiful rise of ground; it abounds in beau- tiful parks, and gardens, and vineyards, all around the city. After we had seen all that we could see, we drove back to the hotel, and retired to our sitting- room; soon after this we were invited to dinner; after dinner we retired to our sitting-room. ' Well, Maria, my dear, how did you like your ride to-day, and what did you think of the city?" "Well, Mr. Russell'" she replied, "I think much of Palermo; it is a handsome place, and beautifully situated."' "Now, Maria, my dear, we have only two more places to go to, and then we are out of Italy; and they are Sicily and Messina. Tomorrow, my dear, we will go and see if we can find a ship going there." 'Early the next morning, after breakfast, we pre- pared to go; I went and got the carriage while Maria was getting ready. I soon came back, and told her the carriage was ready for her; accordingly we got in, and drove down to the levee. We rode along' the- levee till we found a schooner that was going to Sicily and Messina. The captain told me he was going to Sicily, and he would stop three or four days, and from there he was going to Messina. I told him I wanted to go to both places with him. Accordingly I took passage for three, and the next day, after dinner, he was to sail. We then drove back to the hotel, and soon after we were invited to dinner; after dinner we retired to our room.

"I know it is," she replied, my dear Mr. Russell, I know it is your chief delight and desire to make me happy and comfortable, and it always has been ever since you saw me." "Yes, Maria, my dear, it does my very soul good to see you happy, and all around you." We conversed together till the supper bell rung; we then went to supper; after tea we retired to our room; I then said, "Well, Maria, my dear, how does Mary, your maid, like traveling?"

"I am very happy indeed," I replied, "to find she likes it, and I am also delighted to find her so much attached to you." ' Well, Mr. Russell, she thinks a great deal of you, and thinks you are one of the kindest men she ever saw in her life."  -"Maria, my dear, you have seen nothing but kind- ness in me' since our first acquaintance, and I wish to treat every one with kindness and civility."

"Yes, Maria, my dear Maria, that is very true what you-say, but it was not the will of your heav- enly Father that you should be lost in that watery grave, for he fitted up and sent a messenger to de- liver you from it." "Yes, Mr. Russell, it seems to be the hand of Providence all through, for it was by nothing but the mercies of God that we were saved;' and how thank- ful ought we to be t o our heavenly Father for his protection over us." - After our conversation was over we sung a hymn, and went to prayer, and then retired: to bed; early next morning we arose, and went to prayers. After breakfast we went down and got on board the schooner; soon after we came aboard, the schooner left for Sicily, and in a few days we 'arrived in safety. It was late in the evening when we arrived; I then procured a carriage, and drove up to a large hotel, and we retired to our roomsb. Soon after that we were called to supper; after supper we retired-back to our rooms.

"Yes, Mr. Russell," she replied, "I think, by the looks of this country, I should very much like to live here." "Maria, my dear Maria, the country is well enough, and -it is a good, fertile country, but the tyranny that is used in this country would never suit an American; no, my dear Maria, don't talk about settling in this country ; I will take you to a country, Maria, my dear, that is as handsome a country as there is on the whole globe, and where freedom reigns, and not tyranny. Maria, my dear, could I for a moment see tyranny usurp over one that I love as I love you? No, my dear Maria, as long as I live tyranny shall never be usurped over you; I would lose the last drop of blood in my body before tyranny should be usurped over you; you know, Maria, my dears I left your own father's house on the account of tyranny; I saw tyranny brewing there.

"Yes, Mr. Russell, I know you were badly treated indeed for one that ought to have had the best of treatment, and ought to have been treated with the highest respect for-what you had done for them and ne, one that had risked his life as often as you have for me, and done every thing that man could do to save my life, and comfort me." After we conversed awhile we sung a hymn, and went to prayers, and then retired to bed. Early the next morning, after prayers, I said, "My dear Maria, I want you to get ready as quick as you can, so that we can start immediately after breakfast."  We were soon called to breakfast; afterwards we retired to our room. I then said, "Maria, my dear, I will go and get the carriage while you are getting ready." I then went for a carriage, and soon returned, and told Maria all was ready for her, and we all came down and entered the carriage, Maria, her maid, and myself. We drove all around the city of Sicily, and we examined every thing of any account. We found it to be a splendid city; the streets were well arranged, and very wide, and the houses were compact, and very high,'and well arranged, and there were some splendid parks, and gardens, and groves in the city. Around the suburbs of the city there were beautiful vineyards, and in those vineyards 'hung clusters of grapes of all cors, and there were some handsome country-seats, and beautiful gardens, and groves. After we had witnessed all that Was to   DAVID RUSSELL.       291 be seen of any note, we returned back to the hotel. Soon after this we were called to dinner. ' "Well, my dear Maria," said I, after we had retired back to our room, " how do you like Sicily by this time?" a I think, my dear Mr. Russell," she replied, " it is a very handsome city; what beautiful buildings, and gardens, and groves, and 'bowers, and parks it has in it." "Yes, Maria, my dear," I replied," it is a beau- tiful city, and every thing is beautiful around it. Maria, my dear, it is'a pity it lacks one thing, which is the beauty of all, that is the true religion of Christ, and the word of God preached in its purity. That, my dear Maria, would make it shine brighter than the purest diamond from Peru." "Yes, Mr. Russell, I know that pure religion you speak of is lacking in all Roman empires. Oh, Mr.- Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, if I could feel as you do, and have the same mind that you have got, I should be happy indeed." "Maria, my dear Maria, I have prayed day and night for you, and in my secret closet do I pray for you, that you know nothing about.

And, Maria, my dear Maria, I do believe that they will be answered on you, and that your eyes will be opened, and that you will see the error of your ways, and may God grant it, for his dear Son's sake." Soon after this we were called to supper, and after- wards we retired back to our room. "; Well, Maria, my dear,"' said I, " tomorrow morn- ing we must rise up early, and prepare to go to the vessel.'" We went to prayers soon after this, and retired to bed. Early the next morning we arose, and after giving thanks to the Almighty for preserving us through the night, I said, "Maria, my dear, get yourself in readiness, for as quick as we get break- fast we must go down on board of the vessel." We were soon called to breakfast; after breakfast I got the carriage, and left for the vessel. Soon after we got on board the vessel we left for Messina, and in a few days we arrived at the town. We took a carriage, and were driven to a large inn, and the landlord invited us to our room. Soon after this we were invited to supper. We passed the evening in conversation, and singing, and prayers; then we retired to our beds. We arose early the next morn- ing, and after prayers I said to Maria, "My dear, we mrust look around to-day, as this is the last place we f    DAVID RUSSELL.       293 / shall visit in Italy, and I wish you to be ready to start immediately after breakfast." We were soon called to breakfast, and afterwards I told Maria to get ready while I went for the car- riage, that we might go right off. Accordingly the carriage drove up, and I informed her that all was ready, and we all got in and drove off. We drove around the city, aind examined every part of -any note; we found it to be a very fine city, built on a high eminence, and it was beautifully arranged, hav- ing wide streets, high houses, and well built, with beautiful parks, and gardens, and groves, and scenes of all kinds in the city. Around the city, on the outside, were country-seats, and groves, and gardens, and vineyards, and there was beautiful spring water in the city. After seeing all, we returned back to the hotel, and retired to our room. "'Now, Maria, my dear, we must make prepara- tion to go to the city of Malta; that is the place that the Apostle Paul visited after leaving Rome, and preached the true Gospel of our Lord and Saviour, and told the Greeks how he was converted; more- over, he preached all night one night. This country belongs/ to the English at this present time, but at the time the Apostle Paul was there it belonged to ancient -Rome, I will go now and get a carriage, and we will ride around the levee, and see if we can find a packet going to Malta." I went, and soon returned with a carriage. "Now, Maria, my dear, the carriage is ready for you."'

We all went on board, and examined the- cabins; we found the cabins very neatly finiiished; I then took passage for three. The captain told me that I had better .come on board tomorrow afternoon; we then returned back to the hotel, and retired to our room. I then said, "Maria, my dear Maria, I have not heard you say how you liked Messina." "Well, Mr. Russell," she replied, if I was to tell you the truth, I think much of it, indeed; I think t is a beautiful city; every thing is so well arranged in it, and it lies on such a beautiful hill. I have been delighted with Italy ever since I left Rome; I would not have missed seeing it for a good deal." "Yes, Maria, my dear, Italy is a splendid country, it lays in a beautiful latitude, and the temperature is so congenial with our system; and, was the true Gospel preached in its purity in Italy, it would be one of the finest countries in the world; and that is the reason that Christian people will not go there to settle.'" At length the morrow arrived, and we all went aboard the vessel; the next day after we got aboard the vessel left for Malta, and had a fair and beautiful breeze up the Mediterranean Sea, and the captain hugged the shores all the way up, and every now and then we could see the English jack flying on the forts. In anfew days we arrived at the mouth of the harbor of Malta; the mouth of this harbor is very narrow indeed, but very deep; any ship can enter and go in. On each side of the entrance is a large   DAVID RUSSELL.       295 British fort, withl guns pointed down upon you, so that no ship can enter- unless they have a mind to let you. After you get inside of the harbor it forms a complete basin, and you don't see any entrance to the harbor, but you appear to be land-locked all around. There is room for one thousand ships to lay, and ride out the storms and gales without being injured. Our packet was soon moored alongside of a wharf; the captain observed, "Mr. Russell, I am very sorry to have you leave us, for certainly I have enjoyed myself more in this run than I ever did before in my life, for you are certainly one of the liveliest men that, I ever saw in all my life,-from what I have heard of history, and lively stories,-and the best. Mr. Russell, I went to school about five years, to learn navigation, and certainly I have learnt more of the particular points of navigation than I ever learnt in the whole five years; and, Mr. Russell, I have never seen a man of your age before (for you are but a young man) that could explain navigation in its full order. Now, Mr. Russell, I respect you and your family. Where are you going to put up at?" "Well, captain, I have not made any calculation yet, but I think that large house on that hill, which has the sign of the Mason's Arms, will suit me, for it seems to be very neatly finished." "Mr. Russell, you have made a very good choice; that is the largest and best hotel in -Malta.; that is my friend Myers'-Thomas Myers,--andj moreover, he is a countryman of yours, and you will find him, Mr. Russell, one of the best men that you ever came  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7685-00000152"/> 296      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF across in your life; he will be delighted in you, I know, for you will suit him to a notch. It will be a hard job for you to leave him, Mr. Russell, he is an old tar; he is nearly seventy years old, but his equal is not in Malta. In one sense of the word, he is a brother of mine." At this I gave the captain a sign, and he answered it boldly; I then gave him another sign, and he answered it; and at this I gave him another, and he answered that. I then gave him another sign, which was the fourth; at this he gave me another sign, to tell me he could not answer it. He then took me by the hand, and turned around to Maria and addressed her. "Well, miss, you have got one of the smartest men here that I have ever seen in all my life, Then, turning to me, he continued, "NOw, Mr. Russell, I shall call up this evening, and have a little talk with you." . He then shook hands with us all, and he said, "May God bless you, and guide and protect you all, and receive you at last into his-kingdom, for the dear Redeemer's sake, amen." We then got into the hack; I told the driver to drive us up to the Mason's Arms; accordingly he did so. Mr. Myers came out, and opened the car- riage door for us, and invited us into a splendid room. "Sir," said he, "you talk like a Bostonian.' "'-Well, sir, I am a Bostonian." "Was you born in Boston?" '"Yes, sir, I was born and raised in Boston.'   DAVID RUSSELL.       297 He then shook hands with me, and said," Happy am I to see a countryman of my own, and from my own native town; and, sir, if it is a fair question, what might your name be?" 's My name, sir, is David Russell." "Mr. Russell, was you any relation to the four brothers, John, Thomas, William and Joseph?" "Yes, sir, John Russell was my father." "My God! Mr. Russell, I know your folks as well as I know my own." At this a servant called him away on business. "Mr. Russell, I want you to make yourself at home in my own house, and any thing you want is at your command. I have a great deal to say to you when I have leisure time." He then left me awhile. "  Well, Maria, my dear, how do you like the looks of the landlord, Mr. Myers?? "Well, Mr. Russell," she replied, ",he is one of the finest looking men that I ever saw in my life; what a beautiful, open countenance he has got! and his eye is as keen as a brier." "Yes, my dear Maria, that is all correct, he is a good looking man, indeed; but, Maria, my dear, you will find that man lias a heart of flesh, which- is better than all, and not a heart of stone: and, Maria, my dear, that man's very countenance bespeaks some- thing more than common. My dear, I feel thankful to the Almighty this day, to think we are permitted to fall in with such men."' "Mr. Russell, my dear, it seems let:you go where you will you find friends.' 13'  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7685-00000153"/> 298      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF "Yes, my dear Maria, a man that wishes to do right, and serves the true and living God with all his heart, and does unto his neighbors as he would wish them to do unto him, will always find friends, my dear Maria." "Mr. Russell, my dear, I want to ask you one question ; when we were on board the vessel, just as we were coming off, and the captain was recommend- ing you to Mr. Myers' house, he said he was an old friend of his, and old acquaintance; he moreover observed, that in one sense of the word he was a brother of his; and there was a long pause, and not a word said. I saw you make many motions with your fingers, but you did it so quick, I could not distinguish the forms of the motions." "Well, Maria, my dear, I now tell you what I have never told you before;' I belong to the Masonic order, and I can tell a Mason wherever I see him, without talking with my mouth; and, Maria, my dear, whatever difficulties, and trials and troubles we meet with on our journey, wherever I meet with those they are friends to you and me, and all around you; and our friend Mr. Myers is one of those kind of men. And, my dear Maria, you will find him a friend indeed."' By this time we were invited into dinner; before we entered the dining-room he invited us into his private sitting-room, and he introduced us to his family one by one. He introduced me as Mr. Rus- sell, a countryman and townsman of his own; and, Mrs. Myers, a young and a trte American; for his father, my dear, was one of the main pillars of the   DAVID RUSSELL.       299 Independence -of America, and a better man, Mrs. Myers, never, drew breath, than John H. Russell of Boston." We were then invited into the dining-room, and there was a table set in splendor; in fact I never saw a better set table in my life. We were requested to take a seat near the head of the table, and we were helped to every thing in proper order, and a better dinner I never ate in my life. After dinner we were invited to Mrs. Myers' private sitting-room; it was most splendidly furnished, and every thing in elegant style. We were not seated long before Mr. Myers came in, with his two eldest daughters. Mr. Myers took the big arm-chair, and he said, "Now, Mrs. Myers, my dear, and my dear daughters, I am about to tell you a history that will never be forgotten in the United States, as long as time lasts. It will take me some time to tell it, but I will tell you some now, and I will tell you-the rest before Mr. Russell leaves us, for he will not leave us for some time yet. When the United States of America, which now is, belonged to England, it was formed, by Great Britain, into colonies; those colonies had a governor, and judges sent out from England to each colony; the rest of the officers were chosen by the people of the colony, and there were settlers coming from all parts to settle in America; and about that time old Mr. Rus- sell, the grandfather of this gentleman here, left the city of Winchester, in the county of Hampshire, in the south of England, and went to America, and landed near the town of Boston, with his family, his wife, and four boys. About the same time there was  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7685-00000154"/> 800      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OP another family by the name of Reaves landed there. I think that Mr. Reaves had two daughters and two sons. Now Mr. Russell's family and Mr. Reaves' family settled near one another, and I think they joined fences; the boys and girls were all young at that time; they grew up together till they became young men and women. Martha Isabella Reaves, being the oldest daughter, and John H. Russell, being the oldest son, they grew up together, and became wonderfully attached to each other. In a few years from that they were married. After they were married, Mr. John H. Russell bought himself a farm near Boston, and moved on it with his wife. Now, Mr. J. H. Russell being a very smart man, and of good learning, and one of the most ingenious men in that country, he was elected as magistrate by the people. He served as magistrate for several years, and after this he was elected as sheriff. About that time they were raising companies of militia, and he was chosen as captain of a company. Some time after this he was chosen as assistant engineer of the engineer department; soon after that he was chosen as full engineer. He then had to make plans, and drawings, and every year the plans and drawings, and estimations and calculations, were sent to Eng- land to be examined by the Board of Commissioners in the engineer department. When they examined' Mr. J. H. Russell's plans and drawings, and estimates and calculations, they found them so completely ex- ecuted, and so accurate in every point, and they were so well pleased with them,'as they came from a wooden country, as they called it, that they senthim   DAVID RUSSELL.       801 a commission as head engineer of the engineer de- partment, which gave him a salary of five to six thousand dollars a year, besides other perquisites. He was in that office many years, and he accumu- lated a vast amount of money; so that if any one wanted to borrow money they would go to John H. Russell, and they were sure to get it, for he never refused a man in his life. He also set his three brothers up in business, and the bargain he made with them was this: that he would not exact any interest for the use of his money, but that they would make his son David, or his heirs, equal with their own children at their death. He also left his son David a large amount of money, that was then laying in the bank when he died." Mr. Myers then observed, "Mr. Russell, you must be a very wealthy man now if you got all the money your father left you, and the money your uncles were to leave you.' I told him I was worth a little. "Now, ladies, this gentleman that is before you is the very image of his father; they resemble one an- other as much as two peas and his actions, and his speech, and his motions, and every thing about him resembles his father, and I have no doubt but his disposition is the same as his father. John H. Rus- sell was bold, valiant and honorable; friendly, kind and affectionate. Yes, ladies, he was a man that would part the last pound of bread, and the last dollar, with any one in distress; he was one of the most feeling men in that day, and a better man never was born. He was a true and bold American, and  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7685-00000155"/> 802      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF one of the main pillars of the Independence, and this is his son himself; and when he died, Mr. Rus- sell here was only an infant in the cradle." Mrs. Myers observed, that if his father looked like him he must have been a very fine looking man. Mr. Myers then said, "There was not as fine a looking man in the whole State of Massachusetts as John H. Russell." After Mr. and Mrs. Myers and their daughters left the room, Maria then observed, "Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, you never told me you was worth any thing." "No, my dear Maria, I know I did not tell you, nor I have not told you yet, Maria." "Well, Mr. Russell, I know. you must, or have been worth a good deal, from what Mr. Myers said about you.'" "Well, Maria, my dear, I have been a middling wealthy man, and I am not. bad off yet; Maria, my dear, I have always told you if you would go to America with me you would then find out all about me, and all I was worth; but it seems you find out without going to America. Maria, my dear, little did I think . should ever find any one in this far distant land that knew any thing about me, or my folks; but it seems, let me travel where I will, I find people that know my folks. When I was in England I found people there that knew more about my folks than I did." "Well, Mr. Russell, my dear, I always thought that you was of some smart family, but now I am thoroughly convinced of it."   DAVID RUSSELL.       803 As we were conversing, in steps Captain Smith, the captain we sailed with from Messina; he invited me out into the bar-room, and Mr. Smith, and Mr. Myers, and myself all went into a private room and sat. Mr. Myers then gave me a sign higher than the sign that I gave Captain Smith, that he could not answer, and I answered it quickly; he gave me an- other sign, still higher, and I answered it, and he gave me another sign, higher yet; I answered it. He then stopped; I then gave him a sign on the highest order I knew, and he gave me a sign telling me that he could not answer it. "Mr. Russell," said he, "you are wonderfully advanced in Masonic orders; I have belonged to a lodge upwards of forty years, and I don't begin to know to-day what you know about masonry. Mr. Smith, I am well acquainted with all of Mr. Russell's folks, and his father was one of the greatest Masons in all America; he was high priest of the highest order, and his burial was the greatest burial that my eyes ever beheld, and he was buried in military and masonic order. Now, Mr. Russell, I am happy to fall in with such a man as you; and why not settle here, Mr. Russell? It is a fine, healthy country, and every thing that heart can wish, you can get here. It is a temperate climate, neither hot nor cold, and very healthy." "Well, Mr. Myers," I replied, "I have started on- a journey, and conclude to put it through; and after I have accomplished it, I Will consider over it." "Well, Mr. Russell, there is to be a ball here next Thursdayevening,-a masonic ball,-and one of the  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7685-00000156"/> 304     -AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF greatest that ever was in Malta; I shall obtain a ticket for you." Captain Smith said that I must certainly attend the ball; I told him I would be there if I was alive and well. The captain said he intended to be there if he was well, and he wanted to have sonie more talk with me; he did not expect to leave for several days, as he had to wait for freight from the country. Accordingly each of us took a glass of wine, and separated for the evening. I then retired to my room; when I came in Maria said, " O, Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, where have you been all this time? I have been looking everywhere for you." "Maria, my dear, I have only been out to talk with Captain Smith, and Mr. Myers; and, Maria my dear, whatever I do or say will be all for the benefit of you as well as myself. Now, Maria, my dear, there is to be a masonic ball here in this house on Thursday evening next, and we are invited to it; will you go to it, my dear?" "Yes, Mr. Russell," she replied, "I am willing to go any where with you, for the longer I remain in your company the better I like you. But you know, Mr. Russell, I cannot dance; any how I will go." "I am no ways alarmed about that, I wish I could dance as well as you can; but, Maria, I want you, if you go, to have every thing in proper order, and if there is any thing you want, please let me know, and I shall get it foi you, and I want' you to have your maid with you; have her dressed, and look as well as any one there. I think it would be well for you to inquire of Mrs. Myers how the ladies are going to   DAVID RUSSELL.       805 be dressed, for you may have to go to the -dress- makers and milliners, and I would like you to be ready in good season." "I will attend to it, Mr. Russell," she replied, "and have every thing ready in proper order, and you shall not be disappointed." "Maria, my dear, we have not ridden around the city yet; I think, it would be well enough for us, tomorrow, to get Mr. Myers' carriage, and take a ride around the city; what do you think about it, Maria, my dear?" "Well, Mr. Russell, I am afraid I shall not have time to go to ride, as I shall have to make prepara- tions for the ball." "Well, Maria, my dear, let it go till after the ball, and then you will have plenty of time, for I would not miss going to the ball for a good deal, as we shall form many friends and acquaintances at that ball." "Yes, Mr. Russell, my dear, I know you are a very lucky man indeed, for you are forming acquaint- ances all the time." We were now invited into supper, after which we retired to Mrs. Myers' room; we had been there but a short time when Mr. and Mrs. Myers both came in. Mr. Myers said, "Mr. Russell, as you are direct from Paris, I suppose you have heard something about the New London? My paper gives a dreadful account of that wreck." "-Mr. Myers," I replied, "it was dreadful indeed, and no one but myself and another can tell the tale of this dreadful calamity, and nothing but the mer- f  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7685-00000157"/> 306     AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF cies of God and his loving-kindness did ever permit us to tell the tale." "Then it seems," replied Mr. Myers, " that you know all about it."  "Yes, Mr. Myers, myself and Maria were two among the unfortunate number, and the only two that ever survived the ill-fated wreck." "My God!" exclaimed Mr. Myers, in surprise, "my God, Mr. Russell, was you on board of that ship?" "Yes, sir," I replied, "I was on board of that ship." "Mr. Russell, my daughters like very much to have such things told, and I would like you to relate the story while they listen." He then went and brought his daughters in, and they all sat down. -I then commenced my story thus : "I came on board the New London' at Jamaica, in the West Indies; she looked like a very fine ship, and strongly built. I took passage on board of her for Paris; she was commanded by Captain Bigelow. We run down across the- Spanish main with a fair wind; we passed the chains of islands with a fair breeze, going lively through the water, by luffing up, and' in coming into the Narrows we had to brace our yards up a little, and we were still going with a flowing sheet, which brought the wind on the beam. Now we were going along very lively and cheerfully through the Narrows; all at once-the wind blew to a perfect hurricane, and it carried us along at a tre- mendous rate. All the passengers were on deck   DAVID RUSSELL.       307 watching the islands as we passed by; we were sud-. denly taken with a tremendous thick fog; we still run on, not knowing where we were going, until we arrived nearly opposite the- Little Bermuda Island. At this time I walked aft, for I knew the very first slip we made we would strike a rock. I then walked aft, abaft the mizzenmast, and taking a rope I passed it around my body, and fastened one end to a belay- ing clut, and the other part I fastened to a belaying pin, and tlen I swung in the bite. I had not been swinging long before there was a tremendous sea ,struck her broad side, and this, I believe, washed all overboard, as they were all on deck. I kept swing- ing 'there between the seas, till at length the wind took her on the bow, and she wore round, and brought her stern on the slanting rocks, many of which went through her bottom, and left her on the bed of rocks, so two-thirds of her was afloat. The heavy sea surging her up and down, she broke off at the stern, and two-thirds of her went down the channel into the sea; the other third was fast on the rocks. This was the third that I was lashed to; while I was swinging there, to and fro, something passed very quick around my head, like the hair of a female, and I made several grabs at it; it got further from me, and at length I eased away my rope, that I might get nearer to it. Finally I made one more attempt, and caught it by the hair, and drew it to me. I passed the rope around the body, and secured it fast, so we both swung in the bite of the rope (it was about midnight when she struck), and we both swung in this manner till morning.  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7685-00000158"/> 8308     AUTOBIOGRAPHY OP "When daylight began to appear, the wind and sea began to fall, and the fog cleared away, and by the time the sun arose the wind had died away, and the sea had become- calm. I then could distinguish Maria, and she appeared perfectly lifeless, but her pulse was still in action. I then took her in my arms, and carried her up to the high part of the ship, and laid her on the deck; I then took one hand and held her head up, and rolled her with the other backwards and forwards on the deck, till she vomited up some quantity of water; I then sat down on the slanting deck, and held her in my arims. She ap- peared to me as if she would never recover. I'then - kept patting her on the back, and working her about, to make her vomit more. -Accordingly she began to vomit wonderfully, and it appeared to be bile. As I held her in my arms she laid her head back, and ap- peared to be in great agony. I took my handkerchief and parted her hair from her face, and wiped her face; while I was wiping her face she appeared sud- denly to awake, as it were out of a trance. I said to her, ' My dear, how do you feel now?' She replied, ' O, sir, I feel a great deal better- than I did.' After a little she got so that she could talk, and stand upon her feet. I then said to her, 'My dear, can you swim?' (The reason I asked her this was, that if she could, I would swim by her side, and if she wanted help, I would assist her. -I knew it would not be safe for us to remain on the wreck, for if there should be another gale it would wash us overboard, so I - thought we had better make for the island as quick   DAVID RUSSELL.      809 as possible.) She said,' No, sir, I cannot; neither do I feel able, if I could swim.' "I then went to work and knocked down the bulk- heads of the cabin, to make a raft, and lashed my timber together with ropes. I laid a deck on it, and secured it; after that I got on it myself, to see how much it would bear, and I found it would bear me up without any .danger, and I was a great deal heavier than Maria was, so she was convinced it would bear her up. I then got her down, and secured her to it; I then fastened my tow-line to it, and passed it over my neck, and under my arms, and then struck out for the island, and did my very best to reach it. After a short time we reached the island; by the time we reached the island the rope had cut a gash in my neck and shoulder large enough to lay your finger in. After I had landed Maria safe on the island, and secured my raft, I went to work and built a cabin, for it was not long ere the sun poured down. on us so very hqo that it almost burnt us up. After the cabin was built we went in and sat down; I then went to work and built a bunk, and filled it in with cocoanut husks, that we might have a place to lie down to rest; I soon after went to work and dug a well, so that we might have water, but we were three days and -three nights without eat- ing or drinking. On the morning of the fourth day we got some water; after that I swam to the ship, and was fortunate indeed, for I found provisions of different kinds in the'hold of the ship. I also found Maria's trunk, and many other valuable articles; I then made a raft, and towed them all ashore; so on   ,   &#xD;<pb n="310" xml:id="VAC7685-00000159"/> 310      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF the fourth day, about noon, we got something to eat. After this 1 hoisted a flag on a bamboo, half-mast high, on the extreme point of the island, so that every ship could see it as they passed by. In a few days our hearts were made gladj for there was a ship came, and sent a boat, which took us off the island, and landed us safely in Paris. At length we took a ship and sailed for Rome; after that we took a packet and landed in Palermo. Frolm there we took a ship and went to Sicily and Messina, and then we took passage with Captain Smith, and landed here in Malta. Now, Mrs. and Mr. Myers, and girls, I have told you a part of the story, and Maria will tell you the rest some time before we leave, for there is a great deal more that may interest yqu to be told."' Mrs. Myers said, "Well, Mr. Russell, you deserve much credit for your resolution and boldness, for many a man would have sunk under it himself, let alone saving another's life; and, Mr. Russell, it is indeed a miracle how you ever came to save Maria." After this we returned to our rooms, and after prayer we retired to bed. Early the next morning we arose, and I said to Maria, "My dear, you must now be as expeditious as possible, and get ready for the ball; it will take place -next Thursday night, you know, and if there is any thing I can do to assist you I am-ready' and willing to do it." -"Well, Mr. Russell, I would like to have you, if you will, take me around to the --milliner's and mantua-maker's."

Shortly after we were invited in to breakfast, after which I procured Mr. flyers' carriage, and took Maria and her maid to the milliner's and mantua- maker's. After they had finished their business at the milliner's, and they were requested to send their things to the hotel when they were done, we all got into the carriage, and I took them home. After this we retired to our room.  "Well, Mr. Russell, my dear," said Maria, ( I un- derstand this ball is going to be a great and very excellent affair; according'to Mrs. Myers' account, the Masons are to be dressed with their belts, show- ing the degree to which they have advanced.. Also it is to be kept up with a very excellent band., and to be opened in masonic order, as there are none but Masons admitted; moreover, she says. they intend getting up one of the greatest suppers that has. ever been served up in Malta." "Maria, my dear," I replied, u you must endeavor to be ready at the appointed time, as we all have to enter the room in masonic procession, every; one in his proper place, according to his order." In due time Maria's things were sent home; they were splendid to behold. It was a white silk dress, and it was trimmed'with blue ribbon, and very neatly done; her head-dress was a wreath of roses, deco- rated with myrtle blossoms and leaves, and it cer- tainly looked beautiful. The evening came that they were to meet, and all assembled in the lodge-room, to put-on their belts and badges, which was south of  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7685-00000161"/> 312,      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF the ball-room. The ladies assembled in a room on the next story below, and there they all took their seats. As they came down stairs into the hall, each lady took her partner, and walked into the ball- room; as they walked in they each one took their seats, and they continued that way until they were all in, and seated. The manager of the ball sent each one a ticket, that was called out to form two double cotillons, one to the right and one to the left. There was a ticket handed to me to form the cotillon on the right. After they were all on the floor, and every one in his proper place with his partner, the band struck up, by the order of the manager, and the cotillons were carried off finely, and every thing was done in proper order. After the band had played the tune out, they stopped, and all took their scats.   ' We were now invited to another room to partake of a supper; every thing was in the best of order, and after this there were two more sets called to take their places; and so the ball continued all the even- ing, till about two o'clock the next morning.  After this they retired home; some remained all night. After we had retired to our room I asked Maria what she thought of our " masonic ball." "Why, Mr. Russell," she replied, "I it was splen- did, and the best ball I ever saw." "And how did you like your supper?" said I. "Well, Mr. Russell," she replied, "I never saw a table set better in all my life; every thing was most beautiful indeed, and set in the most splendid order; what beautiful cake they had, and how beautifully   DAVID RUSSELL.       813 they were made, and how attentively every one was waited upon, and how observant the waiters were. Every thing was done so polite, and with so much courtesy; and what beautiful wine, and fruit, and nuts they had. I have drunk some very good wine in France, but I don't know that I ever drank any in my life that tasted as good as that did." "Maria, my dear,'? said I, "that wine is made in Sicily, and it is called ' Sicily's best proof;' and how beautiful the masons all looked, having their scarfs, breast belts, and badges on; and what beautiful colors there were in them." "Mr. Russell, my dear," replied Maria, ' I want to ask you one question; what wads that that was in the centre of your rose, on your scarf? In the first place it resembled a very bright, brilliant star; the star appeared to have six, points, and in between each point there was a something that I could not discern, that looked very curious. On the basement of this work there appeared to be a square that projected beyond it all; each part had a different shade, and a different color, and at each point of the square there were different implements, and they were all different colors from the ground that they were laid on ; those implements appeared to project out from the base, and formed an oval, and all those instruments ap- peared to shine like transparent diamonds, and your scarf looked different from any other that was there. In the first place, it appeared to be six inches wide on the base, having on the first edge a gold leaf, about an- inch and a half wide; on the other edge appeared to be a silver leaf, about. an inch wide,; in "  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7685-00000162"/> 814      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OP the centre of it a blue stripe, about an inch and a half wide; on the top of the blue stripe there were stars, about half an inch from point to point, an inch and a half from centre to centre. On each side of this blue stripe there was a red stripe, about three-quarters of an inch wide; on the top of the red stripes was a row of white beads in the centre. Now, Mr. Russell, I want you to tell me what those things meant." "Well, Maria, my dear, I will tell you; the thing that you saw in the centre of the star was the grand point, and those things you saw. on the six points were the orders, and those you saw on the four points were the honors of-the orders; those different shades, and different colors, are differeut-honors from the orders. There, my dear Maria, that is part of tle implements you have asked about, but the best part you left, and forgot; there is the breast-plate and badge." "Well, Mr. Russell, 1 did not take much notice of the breast-plate and badge, but. certainly it looked beautiful, and every thing you had on looked splen- did and beautiful." "Now, Maria, we will go around and see the town.' Accordingly I got the carriage, and we all got in, and went around to see the city of Malta. We ex- amined all the particular places in it. The. city of Malta lays on a high eminence, and it is a very ancient city; it was built in the time: of the Roman empire, and formerly belonged to ancient Rome; the streets are laid out in right angles, and- very   DAVID RUSSELL.       815 wide; the houses aie very high, and very compact, and arraiged in proper order. The city is'well watered with springs, and has beautiful gardens, parks, bowers and vineyards' all around it. It has one of the best harbors in the world; its inhabitants are English; Aiaericans, Greeks, Turks, French, Spanish, and some Dutch; it belongs to England, and is under the English government. After We retturned to. the hotel, I said to Maria, "My dear, how do you like the city of Malta?" "Well, Mr. Russell, I think it is one of the pret- tiest places that I ever was in in all my life ; indeed I like it well enough, Mr. Russell, to settle in it." "Well, Maria, my dear, we have a great ways to go yet, and we shall have to think about moving along." "My dear Mr. RUssell, I feel more at home here than in any place since We left Paris,; in fact, I feel more at home than I did in my own father's house, for your friends appear to treat you with such respect and kindness." "Yes, my dear Maria, you will find this to be the case wherever we go; if we were in the deserts of Arabia, and I was to lift my hand up, and if any one there could answer it, we would find a friend." "Yes, Mr. Russell, indeed, my dear, I know that, for with what few minutes you were with Captain Smith, hisvery soul was animated after you showed him some signs, and I thought you would never get away from him, for when he got hold of your hand I thought you would never get away from him." "Yes, my dear Maria, the order I belong to..will  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7685-00000163"/> 816      AUTOBLOGRAPHY OF give me due respect wherever I go, even to the ends of the earth; and, Maria, my dear, I well know the principles of that order; though I am but young, I have studied deep into it."  "Yes, my dear Mr. Russell, I saw that your friends' countenances were all lighted up when they saw you in the ball-room, and they appeared to treat you with the highest respect and friendship." "Yes, my dear Maria, you will always find that so wherever you go, whenever they meet with a true Mason. Now, Maria, my dear, we must fix ourselves and get ready to go to Gibraltar; that is another English port. I think, Maria, we had better tike a ride around the levee, and hunt up a vessel, so as to be ready to go. When will you be ready for the carriage?" "I am ready any time, Mr. Russell." "Well, my dear, I will have the carriage ready for you right away." Accordingly I had the carriage brought up; we got into it and drove around the levee, where we. soon found a vessel bound for Gibraltar, a Spanish brig. I went on board, and asked the captain what time he would leave for Gibraltar; he told me he should leave in a few days. I asked him if I could get a passage for three to Gibraltar; he told me he had plenty of room. Accordingly he took me down and showed me the cabin, and berths; I then took passage for three. We drove back to the hotel. I then told Mr. Myers I was fixing to go to Gibraltar in a few days; that I had already taken our passage, and we should leave in a few days. Mr. Myers said   DAVID RUSSELL.       317 he was very sorry indeed that I was going away. I told him I had to go away, and get along as fast as I could, for I had but little time to spare. Accordingly in a few days we bid them all farewell, and went on board the vessel. The vessel put to sea the next day, and we had a pleasant voyage and a fair wind. We reached Gibraltar in a very short time, and we went ashore and -got in a carriage, and drove up to the hotel. After dinner we got a carriage, and drove around the city; we examined the city all over, every part of it; also examined all amongst tombs, and caves, and vaults, and cabins, and examined every part of the city of any note. We also examined the dock-yard, and navy-yards, and all the govern- ment works, and every part and place. The city of Gibraltar is built on a solid rock; in most of the buildings the basement is cut out of solid stone; the buildings are built very high, and solid, and most of them are built of stone. The entrance to this harbor is by the gut of Gibraltar, one way; the entrance the other way is by the Mediterranean Sea. Gibraltar is one of the strongest places in the world, and the best fortified place in the world. When the English took it from the Spaniards, they bombarded it three years successively every day, with shot and shell; at last they took it, by the surrender of the Spaniards. After this the French and Spanish combined together to retake it from the English; accordingly they fitted up an immense French and Spanish fleet, with a number of flotillas, which are called floating bat- teries. While the French and Spanish were fitting up their fleet and flotillas, the English were fortify-  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7685-00000164"/> 318      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF ing Gibraltar, and making it bomb-proof; also they were building very large- furnaces, so they might heat red-hot shot by thousands. The French and Spanish fleet and the flotillas attacked the town to bombard it. The English brought all their guns to bear on the French and Spanish fleet, and they threw red-hot shot into them by thousands; they soon blew up the fleet, and all the flotillas, so that no nation ever troubled Gibraltar since. From that time the British have made it impregnable, and impossible to ever be taken by shot or shell, and in no other way but by treachery. The English government, since they have fortified it, has offered a premium of twenty thousand pounds sterling to any man or woman to show them any place where there could be another gun put to advantage. The city of Gibraltar lay at the en- trance to the straits of Gibraltar, and the Mediterra- nean Sea, so that no ship can pass, unless the English have a mind to let them." "Well, Maria, my dear, what do you think of. Gibraltar?" "Well, Mr. Russell, I think it is the strongest for- tified place that I ever saw in all my life; see of what immense thickness the walls are, and look what an amount of mortars and cannon, pointing every way; and look at the block-houses, or castles, with guns pointing every way out of them, one story above another; and then the .whole city, from one end to another, is all a solid rock; and look at those monks' houses! did you observe them, Mr. Russell, how they were cut out of a solid rock? and all the caves, and tombs, how they are all cut out of a solid   DAVID RUSSELL.       319 rock? I have often heard tell of Gibraltar, Mr. Rus- sell, but I never thought to see such a place as this; I would not have missed seeing this place for any thing, for certainly it is one of the wonders of the world; I don't see how the English took. it from the Spanish." Maria, my dear, it was not fortified that way when the Spanish-held it, but still it was a very strong place; then, the moment the British took it, theycommenced to fortify it, and they kept on till they have made it such a place as you see. Tlhe English government has spent one million pounds on this rock, and they have got it so at last that they command the whole Mediterranean Sea.. Not a ship can go up or down without their permission." Mr. Russell, when I was in Paris, and hearing you- tell of going such a journey, I thought very strange of it indeed, to think you should go such a tremendous long  journey, but I would not have missed going with you this journey for any thing, for I have seen and learnt more in the time I have been with you, than ever I did in all my life before." "Well, Maria, that encourages you to go on, I suppose." ' Yes, Mr. Russell, my  dear, 1 am willing to go any where with you." "Well, Maria, my dear, we will prepare to go to: Minorca." "Well, Mr. Russell, whenever you are ready to go, I am ready." "Well, Maria, tomorrow we will hunt up a vessel for Minorca."  .  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7685-00000165"/> 320      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF At this the landlord came in the room-; ' Sir, said he, "I understand you are lately from Paris." "Yes, sir, it is not a great while ago sinch I left Paris., ' "Did you hear any thing of the New London that was lost, bound for Paris?" At this he pulled out a paper, and he said, "This paper gives a distressed account of it, stating that the ship, and every one on board was lost." "No doubt, sir, but it was a distressed wreck, and one of the most distressing wrecks that ever was in the world, and there is no doubt- but what the ship was lost; but of the passengers there was a remnant saved." At this he was called away on business. The next morning we went to hunt up a vessel. Accordingly we drove around the levee, and we found a vessel bound to Minorca; we went on board, and examined her cabin, and we found it was well fitted up; I took passage for three to Minorca!. I asked the captain when he should leave; he said he wanted to leave tomorrow, after dinner. He advised me to get my things on board by ten or eleven o'clock, and for myself, not to be later than twelve. Accordingly we went back to the hotel, and stayed there all night. The landlord asked me if I was not an American; I told him I was an American. "I thought you was, by your speech and actions," he said; " well, sir, I have been all over America, and there are parts of it I like very well, and parts I don't like at all." "What parts do you like, sir?" A+.             .   DAVID RUSSELL.       32t "I like the- southern States very well, most of them, but the northern and eastern States I think very little of." "Yes, sir, the southern States are the best part of America; reckoning the latitude the States are in, and the climate, it makes these much the best, cer- tainly." At this he was called away. "Well, Maria, my dear, you and I are like wan- dering pilgrims yet." "Yes, Mr. Russell, but I am very happy indeed to be with you as a pilgrim." "Well, my dear Maria, we must make haste and push through our journey, and after that I will build you a neat house, and we will settle down in some nice plantation." After this wewent to prayer, and retired to bed. The next morning we   arose bright and early; as quick as we got up I said, c"Now, Maria, you must fix yourself, and as soon as we get our breakfast we, will go on board the vessel." Accordingly we were called to breakfast, and as soon as we got our breakfast I got the carriage, and we drove to the vessel.  The captain said he was glad I had come, for he was going to leave in a few hours. Accordingly he got under way, and left the wharf, and put to sea. In a  few days we reached Minorca. We went ashore, and put up at the best hotel in Minorca; early the next morning we took a' carriage, and drove around the city; we found most of the town  to be in a low situation, with very low buildings, and narrow streets.  There are a few "*  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7685-00000166"/> 322      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF public buildings very good, and some very fine churches, and a very nice dockyard, and some very large men-of-war laying there, and a very good har- bor. This place belongs to Spain, and most of the settlers are Spanish, with some French mixed in with them. Well, Maria, my dear, how do you like Minorca?" "I don't like it at all, Mr. Russell; I wish to get out of it as quick as possible." "Well, my dear, there is a vessel bound for Ma- jorca tomorrow, I'understand, and we will go down early in the morning, and see about it." Accordingly, early next morning we went down, and found she was going to leave in a few hours; she was a packet that made her trips regular. We went oni board of her, and examined her cabin, and I took passage for three to Majorca. The captain told me he would leave in about three hours. Ac- cordingly we went back to the hotel, and got our things, and moved on board the vessel; in a few hours after we were on board she went to sea, and in a few days we reached Majorca. After the vessel reached the wharf I got a carriage, and drove up to the hotel, and took 'our rooms. We went into our room, and sat down, when the landlord asked me if. I was an American or Englishman. I told him I was an American. He said, "I thought you was an American, when I first saw you; well, sir, I am an Englishman." "I know you are; I knew that before you told me." "A Ad what did you know by?"   DAVID RUSSELL.       323 "By your speech and dialect, for you sound on the h." "Well, sir, I am a true Englishman." "Well, I have no doubt of that sir,. and I am a true American, and there are a pair of us true." At this he gave me a'sign, and I answered it very quick; he gave me another, and I answered it; he gave me another, and I answered it; he then stopped. I then gave him a sign on the high order; he then dropped his hand. He turned around to Maria, and said," Well, ma'am, you have got one of the smartest men here that I have seen for this many a day; and he is not only smart looking, but he knows some- thing." "Yes, sir," said Maria, "I know he does." He then turned around to me, and said," Sir, I should be happy to know your name." "My name is David Russell." "Oh," said he, "Russell is a glorious name; I have been acquainted with a great many of that name, and Lord John Russell was a fine man." "And, sir, if it is a fair question, what is your name?" "My name is William Baker." "Well, sir, I have been acquainted with a great many of that name in America." He then said," Mr. Russell, I want you to make yourself at home in my house, and any thing you want you can have; and I want you to stay with us two or three weeks and rest yourselves, and it shall not cost you a cent." "Well, sir, I would stay with you awhile, only 1  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7685-00000167"/> 324      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF am in such a hurry to get through my journey, and get back. Now, Mr. Baker, I want to ask you some questions, and get a little advice from you; you have been living here a good many years, and I have no doubt you know all the course through here." "Well, Mr. Russell, any thing I can do for you I am ready and willing to do it."  "Well, sir, I want to ask you which is my nearest route to Egypt." "Well, Mr. Russell, you will have to go to the city of Arabia, and cross the Great Desert; there are vessels every day or two leaving here for Arabia, so you can get a passage almost any time." "Well, Mr. Baker, I want to, get through, and I want to take the first vessel that leaves here." "Well, sir, there is one leaves tomorrow about three or four o'clock; but I should like to have you stay a few days with us, if you can't stay any more." I thanked him, and I told him I had no time to spare; at this he was called away. I then said, "Maria, my dear, we have not examined the' city yet, and we have but little time to do it in; so we will either have to go this afternoon, or early in the morning." "Well, Mr. Russell, we will go this afternoons" Accordingly I got a carriage, and we went off; we went around the city, and examined it all over. We found the city to be part on a hill, and part on a plain; the upper town looked well, with high build- ings and wide streets, and splendid parks, gardens, bowers, and good springs of water, and some very handsome churches. The lower town was composed   DAVID RUSSELL.       325 of low buildings, and wonderfully scattered, having some very good gardens, and some excellent spring water, and very handsome churches, and a very good harbor for shipping. This place belongs to Spain. After this we drove back to the hotel, and retired to our room, "Well, Maria, my dear,?' said I,. 'how did you like Majorca?" "Well,-r. Russell," she replied, "I like it better than I did Minorca; the upper town looks very well indeed, but the lower town I don't think much of." "Now, Maria, my dear, I want you to get ready soon, for we must go aboard of the ship early in' the morning. Don't you think it is best, my dear, to get aboard early, so as not to lose our passage?" "Yes, Mr. Russell," she replied, "I think it is best to get ready early, or we may lose our passage." I then asked Mr. Baker how long it would take us to go to Arabia; he said we could run it in a few days if we had a good wind, and we would be a few days crossing the desert. Early the next morning we went down to the ship; we went on board, and about two o'clock she left for sea; we had a fair wind all the way, and in about three days we landed in Arabia. After we landed we took a carriage, and drove up to the largest hotel in Arabia, and we took our rooms, and retired to them; soon after we were. calledd to supper; after supper we retired- to our room. "Well, my dear Maria," said I, " we are in Arabia; little did we think, when we were on that desolate island, surrounded' with difficulties and trials on every side, and if we turned to the right or left, or rat   ^   &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7685-00000168"/> 826      AUTOBIOGRAPHY -OF went east, west, north or south, on the beach, we saw nothing but our fellow mortals tossing to and fro by the waves and surf, that we should ever enjoy the pleasures we now enjoy." "( No, Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell," replied Maria, "I never expected to leave that island when we were on it,--no, I never should have left it, Mr. Russell, had it not been for you,--and I am afraid I never shall be able to reward you for what you have done for me; but, my dear Mr. Russell, I shall do, all that lays in my power to make you happy, for I know you have done all in your power to make me happy, even to the risking of your life." "Now my dear Maria," I replied, "I know you do all you -can to make me happy, but there is one thing that I request of you, and before I tell you I will say a few more words; I love you, my dear, as. I love my own soul, and I have laid my life down for you sev- eral times,-you know this,-and I am ready to do it again; but O! Maria, Maria, my dear Maria, when I think of your soul it makes my very soul yearn within me. H may be the means of saving your mortal body, but, my dear Maria, I cannot save your soul. Now I say this on account of the words you have expressed, in order to show you your danger. Maria, it is not me Iwish you to please, but I wish you to please your God and Saviour; let not priests, nor bishops, nor monks nor friars blind your eyes, and lead you to perdition; but, Maria, my dear, listen to one that loves you as he does his own soul, and you know it, Maria; throw away all your idols, and all your tradition and superstition, and all men's   DAVID RUSSELL,       327 works, and embrace the true gospel of our Lord and ,Saviour; that gospel the Apostle Paul preached on the island of Malta, and the gospel that the Apostle Peter preached when there were five thousand con- verted in one day to their God and Saviour. And, my dear Maria, let me exhort you as one that loves you both soul and body, to listen to no false doctrine, or no men's works, but call on your God and Saviour, and He will teach you the true doctrine, and that doctrine, if you follow it truly, having faith in Him, will bring you into His kingdom at last, where you will praise Him and all the heavenly hosts, and sing praises unto the Lamb that redeemed you forever. May the God of heaven hear my prayers, and may the God Almighty grant peace to your soul, for his dearSon's sake, amen, and amen.," Maria then wept. "Maria, my dear, what is the matter?" "My dear Mr. Russell," she replied, "I see how dearly you love me, and indeed I know it, for you are always talking kindly to me about my God and Saviour, and you are warning me against those monsters that would take both soul and body, and devour it. Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, my maid has taken notice of your prayers and discourse for her and me, and she came weeping to me the other morning, and said, ' O! Maria, my, dear Maria, what does all this mean? for when Mr. Russell prays he makes such long prayers, and I feel so strange, and before I get off my knees my heart feels ready to burst, for his prayers seem so kind, and he seems so zealous in the cause; and then when he talks- to us  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7685-00000169"/> 328      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF he talks so kind that he always msakes my heart ache.-' "-'6Well, Mary, my dear,' I replied to her, 'Mr. Russell is a kind nman, and you know it, for you have been with him long enough to know him; Mr. Rus- sell says that we ought not to serve God with our bodies, but with our spirits ; for lihe says our Saviour said, "Whomisoever served me' must serve me in spirit and in truth.?' Again he says: "Fear not those that can kill the body, but rather fear him that can kill both body and sotul."  So, Mary, you. see that we are not doing right, We are not listening to God, buit listening to the- priest.'" Just then the captain of the ship we came in, and an, Arab with him, knocked at the door; I went to the door and invited him in, and they sat down., The captain then said, "Mr. Russell, here is an acquaint- ance of mine; I can recommend him to you as an honorable man, and he is going to leave tomorrow in the forenoon, with his camels, for Egypt, and I think it would be a chance for you to go;. "Well, captain," I replied, , I wholly depend on you as a man of honor, and we have got acquainted enough to know we are brothers, and we are con- vinced of it, and it would be a sad thing, captain,;for one brother to- deceive another." ' No, Mr. Russell, I Would suffer my right arm to be cut off before I would deceive you,- for you are a blooming youth, and a bright young man indeed, and one whose knowledge is not easily fathomed; so, Mr. Russell, you need not be afraid, for this man t   DAVID RUSSELL.    f   329 will take you safe through to Egypt, and he will bring you back if you wish." Accordingly I made a bargain, and drew writings with him, and had the captain to sign it; so early the next morning we took our departure on the camels ; and in about the middle of the Great Desert, at the centre watering-place, we stopped to water and feed our camels. - Now these camels will drink water enough at once to last them three days. I now said to Maria and her maid, "You must get off, and walk around a little, and we will go in and have a talk with the keeper of the inn." The steps were then let down, and they came down off the camel, and I walked around with them a little-while, and then went into the inn. I said to the keeper, "How do you do, sir?" He replied, "Sir, I am pretty well, how are you?" "Well, sir," I replied, "I feel quite well." At this he invited us into the private sitting- room. After this he said to me, "Are you not an American?"  I told him I was. "' Wliat part of America are you from?" I told him I was from Boston. He asked me if I was born in Boston.   I told him I was born and raised in Boston. "Well, sir," said he, " am a native of Boston myself, but it is a great many years since I was there."' At this he went and brought in wine, fruits, cakes and nuts, and set them-before us, and told us to help ourselves. After this he said hewished to speak a  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7685-00000170"/> 330      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF word to me in private, and we walked out; I then told Maria I would return in a few moments. She said, Mr. Russell, I must go with you." Oh, no, my dear, you sit still, and help yourself to refreshments, and I will be back in a few mo- ments." Mr. Reynolds and I then retired; as quick as we got behind the house he gave me a sign, and I an- swered it; he then gave me another, and I answered it; he gave me still another, and I answered it. I then. gave him the highest sign that I knew in the highest order, and he could not answer it. At this he took me by the hand, and said, "Young man, you are a man of great knowledge in masonry, for you are but a youths and you are far advanced in masonry." He then called his family into the sitting-room, and he introduced me as his " brother," and as a "true American," and he told them to get tea ready, and serve it up with the best they had in the house. He then went out, and told the driver he wished him to stay all night, and it should not cost him any thing; accordingly he agreed to stay. Tea was soon ready, and we were' then invited in, and we all sat down to a splendid tea, and every thing was in the most perfect order. After tea we all retired back to the sittinrg-room again. I then said to Maria, "My dear, do you recollect. what I told you a short time ago?  "Yes, Mr. Russell," she replied, "I do ,recollect it." "Well, and what was it,; my dear?"   DAVID RUSSELL.31 "You said, my dear Mr. Russell, 'My dear, if you were in the middle of the desert of Arabia, and held up your hand, and found any one that could answer it, you would find friends.' " "Well, my dear, has not this been proved in your own presence this evening?" "Yes, my dear Mr. Russell, it has indeed." Mr. Reynolds came in the room just then; he said, "Well, miss, how do you like traveling?" "Very well indeed, sr," Maria replied. "Well, miss, you have got a very joyful man with you, and one that has a good deal of knowledge." "Yes, sir," she replied," he is a man that is happy himself, and makes every one happy around himr." "Yes," replied Mr. Reynolds, "I see that plainly; it is impossible for any one to be unhappy where lie is." He tlen left the room. "Well, Maria, my dear,' said I, "whenever you feel as if you want to retire to rest, you must let me know." Maria said she was in no hurry, and she pulled her watch out and looked at it, and said it was not late. By this time refreshments were brought in, and all the family came in, and we all regaled our- selves, and conversed a little while; Maria said she would like to retire; accordingly we retired to bed, and we had a splendid bed, and every thing nice. The next morning we all arose early, and the man was fixing his camels for ah early start, and we had a very early breakfast. After breakfast we shook hands. with them all, and bid them all farewell; then  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7685-00000171"/> -,332     AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF  he charged the man to take good care of us, and carry us safe through, and he pledged his word and honor he would. Accordingly we moved on with our camels, and -we had a pleasant journey across the desert, till we reached the gap that led us to the road to Egypt. The driver then said, "Mr. Russell, I think you are a very lucky man." "Why so, sir?" said I. "Well, sir," he replied, "I have been traveling this desert a good many years, backwards and for- wards, and I never have had such a favorable time ili my life as 1 have had in this route, for I have had nothing but good luck ever since you and your family got on my camels. It has been such a pleasant time we have had, and no winds! Why, sir, I have crossed this desert when me and my camels would    be lifted up by the east winds, and carried away a good distance before we could ground ourselves in a sand-bank."

"Well, sir, you are the very man I want." At this we drove up to a watering-place, and we thought they would never be done drawing water' for their camels. The Fell they drew the water out of was about fifty feet deep, and about six feet across; it was well stoned up, and neatly done. There were two large buckets raised by a windlass, one up and. another down, and they held about a tub full apiece. This great desert that we crossed is one vast plain; not a tree or stump, or a stone to be seen; and you can see nothing but sand-banks as far as your eyes can behold. Some of these banks are very high, and they protect the travelers when the east Wind blows a gale, for they burrow into the batiks so that the wind may pass over them; and not carry them away.            - Maria said, "Mr. Russell, did you observe the driver making motions with his hands when we were at the watering-place?"     .

"Yes, Mr. Russell, certainly we ought to be thank- ful, for I have seen nothing since I have known you but the mercies of God following you wherever you go; from the time that you wiped my face when we sat on the deck of that ill-fated ship, the providence of the Almighty appeared to lbless you."

Shortly we came up to a place to feed our camels; I then said, "Maria, my dear, you and Mary had better get down and walk a little." Accordingly I fixed the steps, and they got down; I then asked the driver how long he would be in feeding; he said about one hour. I told him we would take a short m-walk into- the woods while he was feeding, so accordingly we went into the woods. Now in those woods there was wild fruit of all kinds; viz.: the wild fig, and wild grapes of all kinds, and/ the pomegranate, and wild plums, and many other different kinds of fruit that I found no name for. We then returned back, and we all- got on the camels, and moved on once more. The driver rode on the side that'Maria was on; and he said, "Ma'am, it seems that Mr. Russell has traveled a great deal, for he seems to know a great deal about different parts of the world." "Yes, sir," Maria replied, "he has traveled a great deal, and he don't travel as some men do, for they travel on and pass through the country without noticing any tlring, but he takes notice of every thing ; he sees not a house of any note but he takes a sketch of, or, any other fine buildings. When we were in Malta the house that we put up at was a splendidly finished house, according to Mr. Russell's account; he went to work and took drawings of every part of .the house, outside and inside, and many other buildings in Malta he took sketches of also.

We were in that city many days, and: we rode around the city every day; when there, in our carriage, Mr. Russell would take his drafting instruments and paper, and he would sit for hours taking drawings of the fronts of the handsomest buildings in Greece; also, sir, he has got drawings of every city he has been in, more or less, and he has been in a great many cities for a man of his age; so you see, sir, it is a benefit to him, and also the community at large, for him to travel, for he will instruct the rising generation by .his lectures and books in time, for he has not only got the theory, but he has got the practice, which makes every one perfect." "Yes, ma'am, 1 see in him what I never saw in any man before; I see gifts of knowledge and wis- dom, and understanding, that I never saw in any man before; there is nothing but what he under- stands something about.

' By this time we got out, of the woods into an open plain, and we could see the lofty towers andhigh steeples of Egypt, a  great ways off.

It seemed as though the camels could smell the city, for tey would raise their heads and snort won- derfully. I then said to the driver, "William, what is the cause of your camels acting so-curiously since we came out of the woods?"  s ,4 Why'sir,"l he replied, "-they see Egypt; and you will find they will go faster than they did, and they will continue to go faster until they reac!h the city. We now came to a. watering-place; it was the well at which Jacob watered his cattle and camels when he went to Egypt with his eleven sons, to see his son Joseph. I now said to Maria, "My dear, I want you to get down and walk a little.' ,' Mr. Russell," she replied, "I am :glad we have come to a watering-place." I then fixed the steps, and helped them down; we walked around the plain, gathering flowers. Now there were flowers of all kinds and colors growing on the plain; at length William called to us, and said he was ready to start. We went back .and got on the camels, and moved on, and as we traveled over the plain it was beautiful to see the flowers of an kinds and colors as far as your eye could behold. It ,reminded me of our prairies in the Spring of'the year, for t have been on them when my very soul would be animated at the wonders of nature and Providence. I would say in my soul, ' Surely the finger of God is here, and the glory of God all around me." /"                  DAVID- RUSSELL.       839 I now said to William, "I suppose you ate well acquainted in Egypt?" "Yes, Mr. Russell," he replied, "I know every part of Egypt, and almost every person of any ac- count. " "Well, William, I want you to take us to a place of entertainment, where we will be attended to, and a decent and respectable place, and where we will be safe." "Mr. Russell, I will take you to a place where I will pledge all I am worth in the world for your safety and good treatment; and, Mr. Russell, I am going to take you to a house that the man will be delighted to see you, and you will be delighted to see him when you get acquainted with him; he is a brother of yours, and a better man never was born; he is a Turk. You will find one thousand Turks in Egypt of your class that will give you the last piece 'of bread and the last drop of wine they had, if you were in want." After this, he rode on forward with his camel. I then said to Maria, 4' Maria, my dear, what did I tell you in coming across the desert?"  "Oh, Mr. Russell, my dear, what a lucky man you are."' Presently William came alongside of Maria again, and said, s Ma'am, Mr. Russell is the very man to travel, for a man that knows what he does can travel to the ends of the earth, and find friends. Yes, ma'am, and if he was brought up to be shot in this country, and was to raise his hand, they would -fire over him; and, ma'am, if he. will go back with  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7685-00000175"/> 340      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF me to Arabia 1 will start him in-any kind of business he has a mind to go in; and the man I am going,to take him to will do the same, I have no doubt, for he will be delighted in him when he sees him." He then left, and rode on ahead. Now we were drawing near to the suburbs of the city, and we could see every thing in full splendor, with lofty towers and spires, and splendid mosques and synagogues, and beautiful buildings splendid to behold, and beau- tifully finished. -We passed through many streets, till at length we came'to a beautiful white building, built of splendid white marble. It was finished in the composite and Corinthian order, tinged with the Grecian style, and it had. a piazza all around it. William drove up to the front steps, and spoke to the. landlord, who was a fine looking man. He came out and invited us in; and as we reached the steps of the piazza, which was about six feet from the -ground, there were two young ladies met Maria and Mary, and they locked arms with them, and walked with them into a beautiful sitting-room. After we had sat a little while we were invited into a bath-room, and there were servants there to wash us; our heads and feet first, and then our bodies all over. After this there was a white robe put on each of us, and we were invited to our rooms,-each one to their own room. The clothes we pulled off were taken away, and we did not see them again until they were brought to us neatly done up. After we were all dressed with clean clothes, we were invited back to the sitting-room; we all sat down, and -in a short time the two young ladies came in, and their mother   DAVID RUSSELL.       4 followed thiem. The young ladies had in one hand a binch of fruit, and in the other hand a case of flowers ; they then presented the fruit and flowers to -Maria and Mary. , After this they embraced each other, and kissed each other three times; at this time the mother came in with a large silver waiter, and refreshments; she asked us all to stand on our feet, which we dfd. She then said, "Since the God of Heaven has brought you safe from your native land into the land of Egypt, and has permitted you to come under our roof as strangers and pilgrims, in a strange land, I do exhort you, ill the name of Himn who was crucified on Mount Calvary, not to make yourselves strangers, but to make yourselves at home, and be as one of The servants then. handed each of us a glass of wine, and the old lady then told us to help ourselves to every thing, we wanted, and call for any thing we wanted. Now this is the custom of the Egyptians when strangers enter their houses. After a little while the landlord came in, and William was with him; he invited me into a private room. He then gave me a sign, and I answered it; he then gave me another, and I answered it; he then gave me another one, and 1 answered that; i'he then gave me still another, and  I answered it; he then stopped. I gave him a sign higher than any he had given me; he answered it; I gave him another still higher, and he answered it; I then gave him the highest sign I knew, for I knew, if he answered that, he m usthe a Very high Mason, but he could not answer it.  &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7685-00000176"/> 342      AUTOBIOORAPHY OF He then took me by the hand, and- he said, "My God, young manh, you surprise me! a man' of your age to know so much about masonic orders! Young man, you are at home here, and you and your family must stay here their lifetime ; you will find thousands of friends here in Egypt, Mr. Russell." William then remarked, "Mr. Russell, I told you that you-would find. yourself at home here."  9' Yes, William, and I have no doubt but what I shall find many friends here." I then retired back to my room, and in a .short time the landlord-and William came in and sat down. The landlord then said to Maria, "You have got one of the smartest men here that I ever knew; you need not fear -as long as he, is alive,-no, ma'am, nor after he is dead,--for the order that he belongs to will never let you want for any thing." At this we were called in to dinner, arid certainly it was a splendid dinner indeed ; after which we re- tired back to the -sitting-room. I then said to Maria, "My dear, tomorrow we must go around and see the town-." "Yes, Mr. Russell, I should be happy to see it, for I think it is a very nice place." 6'"Well, Maria, my dear, what do you think of the landlord and landlady?"              i "Well," she replied, "indeed I think they are very nice people." "Yes, Maria, you will find the longer you are ac- quainted with them the better you will like them." "Well, Mr. Russell, I think we are highly blessed in falling in with such people."' ' i   DAVID RUSSELL.       343 " Yes, Maria, indeed we are; I think we ought to be very thankful that we are permitted to'meet with such people; and you know, Maria, I told you when we left Paris that we would go safe, and hot a hair of your head should be hurt, and you see, Maria, my dear, every thing has worked well so far. And, my dear Maria, we must trust to our heavenly Father, and pray to Him to protect us, and having faith in ]Him through our Lord and Saviour, he will protect us. You see, Maria, all that I told you has come to' pass, so far; you know I told you if I was in the middle of the desert of Arabia, I Should find friends; and now I am among Turks and Algerines, and I still find friends. Yes, my dear Maria, and let me go to the ends of the earth, I will still find friends and you will see it if you are with me." Now by this time we were called to supper; we were invited into the dining-room, and we sat down to a splendid supper; there was every thing on the table that heart could wish. After supper we retired back to our sitting-room; after we were seated I, said, a Well, Maria, how did you like your supper ? " " Oh, Mr. Russell," she replied, "it was beautiful; I never had a  better supper in my  life; and how) attentive  the  servants -.are to their business, in changing the plates." "Well, Maria, you are satisfied in Egypt ? " "Yes,- Mr. Russell, I feel at home here." "Well, Maria, my dear, I  am  happy to  hear you are satisfied.

I then said to Mary,-"My dear, how do you like Egypt, from what you have seen of it?" "Mr. Russell," she replied, "I think, it is a very pretty place, and I like the people much, what I have seen of them." "It seems, Mary, that you and Maria ate both satisfied." "Yes, Mr. Russell," replied Mary, "we are both satisfied, I know, and we can't be otherwise, for you are such good company for us, in talking to us, in singing and praying, in giving us good advice, and telling us history and tales; for my own part,--a nd Maria is the same,--the longer I am with you the better I like you." "Mary, my dear; do you feel as well while travel- ing with Maria, as you did living in Paris?" "Yes, Mr. Russell, I feel better; and I feel willing to live with you as long as I live." "Well, Mary, my dear, I am happy to find you are satisfied, and I hope you will always be so." At this I said, "Come, ladies, let us sing a hymn, and go to prayers." Accordingly we did so. After prayers we retired to bed. Early the next morning we arose, dressed ourselves, and went to prayers; after prayers I said, "Now, Maria, you and Mary must get ready, and we will go around and examine the city." After breakfast I got a carriage, and William drove us around the city, and took us to every place of any note. Part of the city was on a side-hill, and part   DAVITD RUSSELL.       345 on a plain. The king's palace is built of blue marble, and it is a very ancient building; it was built by a Greek architect, and they aire the best in the world. The building is a square building, as large one way as it is' the other; it covers a great deal of ground, and the roof of this building is a flat hiproof, forming a piazza all around with iron balusters, in the Grecian order, all around the roof. The cornice is in the Grecian style, and it is beautiful -to behold, and, in- deed, every thing about the building is done in the most splendid manner. This building stands in the centre of a large garden; has a circular fence all around it. The base of this fence is built of blue marble, about three feet high, and it has an iron baluster fence all around on the top of the base. This garden is one of the handsomest gardens in the world, for there is every thing in it that can be in a garden to make it such; there are fountains of all kinds in it, afid mounds of all kinds and forms, and walks finished in the most splendid style. It has beautiful summer-houses, and parks, and bowers, and every kind of Eastern fruit; also flowers of every description and color, and shade and lhue. The town is very compact, and the streets are very wide; the buildings are, very closely built, and neatly finished. Most of them are built in the. Grecian order. There were also some beautiful mosques and synagogues and churches; there were castles and towers, and parapets of all shapes and sizes; some beautiful foun- tains of water, and handsome gardens, of different shapes; and parks, and bowers and vineyards Around the outside of the city there were some beau- 15*  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7685-00000178"/> 346      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF tiful country seats and gardens, of different kinds and shape, and I took sketches and drawings of every thing of any account. The garrisons are built very strong, and are well fortified. The inhabitants of this town are Egyptians, Turks, Greeks and Jews, and some few English and Arabians. "Well, Maria, my dear," said I, " we will drive home and see our friends."' Accordingly we drove back, and they all met us on the piazza. The old lady said, "Well, Mr. Rus- sell, I, am glad you have returned; I don't know what kept you so'long, but I have been so lonesome that I did not know what to do." "Well, ma'am," I replied, "1 we could not get back any sooner, for we found so much to look at." "You certainly must be very hungry," said she. "Yes, ma'am, we feel somewhat hungry." Accordingly supper was prepared in a short time, and we were invited to partake of it; we had every thing in the best of order. After supper we retired to our room. I then said to Maria, "' My dear, how did you like the city?'" "Well, Mr. Russell,"' she replied, "I think nmuch of it; certainly every-thing looks splendid. How beautiful' the king's palace looked, and the garden! every thing was done so neatly, and complete; and what beautiful mounds and walks, and how curiously they were laid out, and what beautiful fountains of water there were there. Indeed, Mr. Russell, I leave seen nothing but what looks handsome in the city; and indeed, Mr. Russell, I like Egypt much, for there is a beautiful country all around it."   DAVID RUSSELL.       347 "Yes, Maria, my dear, it lays in such a beautiful latitude; and it is a pity that the word of God is not more read with diligence and attention here; then, Maria, my dear, it would flourish more than it does. But the people of the East never did study the one thing needful, as they ought. Maria, my dear, had they as closely examined the word of God as they studied the craft of the East, Jerusalem, that great city that was destroyed, would still be standing, and all Pharaoh's army would not have been-lost in the Red Sea. Had they studied the word of God as they ought, Maria, my dear, instead of planning  and scheming with their ' cunning men and women,' as they called them, how they might make images of gold and silver, and wood and stone, and of brass and iron, and of every other metal that they could work, they might have been preserved from destruc- tion. Tle greatest of those images was called the ' great Diana, and another they called ' Jupiter,' and another ' Mars.' Many other, names they had to those images, for they had a  name to every one. When the Apostle Paul was traveling in the East, in entering the gates of Athens, he found an inscrip- tion written 'To To T  UNKNOWN GOD,' and 'GREAT Is DIANA.' Now this inscription was raised up some fifteen or sixteen feet from the ground, and those words were written on both sides, and it was written in Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, so that every one could read it as they passed. Now the Apostle Paul in that day, being a very high learned man, he un- derstood Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, and preached in all those three languages.

"There, Maria, my dear, I have given you a sketch of the Eastern countries, the way and manner they used to worshipe and they do it yet, more or less; and, my dear Maria, they are not alone, for there are thousands and thousands that are worshiping images besides them."

Oh, my dear Maria, when I think of those things it makes me cry out with one of old,' My God, my God, and my Saviour, renew in me a clean heart, and a right spirit, and teach me thy will, O Lord, and guide me into tr uth, and guide me safe into thy kingdom at' last, for the. dear Re- deemer's sake, amen and amen.'

"No, my dear Mary, I know you never did," I replied, ".for,-my dear Mary, where there is, nothing given there can be nothing imparted, and where the blind lead the blind they will both fall into the ditch together. But, my dear Mary and Maria, what I say to you this night comes from a pure and contrite spirit, and aclean heart, I hope.

We fell down on our knees, and I offered up prayers to the Almighty. that they might be converted to the true and living God, and see the error of their ways. After prayers we retired to bed. We arose early the next morning, and after prayers we were called to breakfast; after breakfast we retired to our room. I said to Maria, "My dear, we will now prepare to go to Jerusalem; I suppose you have seen enough of Egypt?" "Mr. Russell, my dear," she replied, "I should like to take a ride around the outside oT the city, and see those vineyards, and those handsome buildings that I see afar off." "Well, Maria, my dear, I will have the carriage brought up immediately, and we will start right off." Accordingly the carriage was brought up, and we all got in and drove off; we drove all, around the outside of the city, and examined every vineyard, -and all the cottages, and we saw some very handsome fountains; we came to one that represented the brazen serpent that Moses lifted up in the wilderness, and the water was gushing out of its mouth in a pure stream.  We saw many others, of different shapes; some in the shape of a lion, some in the shape of an alligator, some like a bear, some like a dog, and many of them were in the shape of the   DAVID RUSSELL.       351 images that they made in the :East. We examined these cottages minutely; the most of them were built square, and very large on the ground. They were built in the Grecian style, and in the best of order with a hanging verandah   all around them, sup- ported from above. These cottages were built of marble of different colors, and they were splendid to behold, for they were built in the most tasteful style andthey all stood in the centre of a beautifill garden. The fence that was around them was of a true circIe and the gardens were very large; those gardens'were fixed up in the most splendid style.  We also ex- amined the vineyards, and in each vineyard there was a wine-press and vat, and those vineyards were in -the most splendid style, and every thing in the best of order, having grapes of all kinds and colors. Tlis is a true description of the city, and gardens, and vineyards of Egypt. "Well, Maria, my   dear," said I, " we must now drive back to the hotel."- We then drove back, and the family met us on the piazza; and as we entered the room the landlady thus addressed me: "Mr. Russell, my daughters tell me you are going to leave us." "Yes, ma'am, I want to leave as quick as possible for Jerusalem." 'Mr. Russell, let me beg of you not to leave us, but stay a   few weeks with us; we have just got acquainted with you, and now you are going to leave us; my daughters say they are delighted with you and your family, and they say you are such a splen- did singer, and so good in telling- history, and stories  &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7685-00000181"/> 352      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF '  of your travels, and relating many things that they never heard before ; and they say they never saw any one that they became so much attached to as they have to you and your family.

"Well,. ma'am, I would stay with all my heart, for I have never been treated better iin any place in all my life than I have been in your house, and I would take it a pleasure to stay, for I feel perfectly at home here ; but, ma'am, I have made engagements I must fulftl. I love and respect you and your family, and ever shall, for your kindness to us, and I never shall forget you; so may the God Almighty bless you and your family, and guide and protect you, and at last receive you into his kingdom for the dear Redeemer's sake; amen, and amen."        - By this time the landlord came in. Mr. Russell, said he," my wife tells me you are going to leave ,' Yes, sir, I want to leave as soon as possible." , Mr. Russell, do let me prevail on you not to leave us; I shall feel -lost when you leave, for you are such good company; my whole family have been delighted with you; and they say they have, never been happier in their lives than they have since you have been here, We people of- Egypt, when we find such a man as you,-though we don't often come across such a one,--we do all we can to keep them with us, for we believe we enjoy more prosperity with them than without them.'"   DAVID RUSSELL.       353 " Yes, sir, there is something to be said in that, and I will tell you one circumstance: you remember the ancient patriarch Lot, to whom the Lord sent an- gels to warn him and his family, and to compel them to leave the city immediately ? Lot constrained the young men to stay with him, for he said, ' in you I have prosperity, in you I have peace and happiness with me and all my family.' And the young men constrained him, and hurried him to get out of the city immediately. And while the young men were doing this, the house was surrounded, and demand made of Lot to deliver up the young men, or they would destroy him and his family, and all he had, immedi- ately.  Lot was now standing at the door of his house, and he begged of the people to let the young men depart in peace, as they had entered his house peaceably. " At this the young men caught Lot and pulled him back from the door, and they struck the people with blindness, and they fell with their faces to the ground; and there they lay, until the city was de- stroyed. The angels then hurried Lot and his family out of the city, with all speed, charging them not to look. behind them. And after they had got some ways out of the city, Lot's wife looked back, and immediately she was turned into a pillar of salt; and it stands to this day. There, sir, is an instance that I have heard of, and the only one that refers to what you have related concerning me." After this I told William to be ready in the morn- ing, and we would go to Jerusalem. By this ,time our camels was well rested, and ready for another   &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7685-00000182"/> 354     AUTOBIOHGRAPHY OF journey. Accordingly the next day, William was ready with his camels. I then called on the landlord for the bill. "Mr. Russell," said he, "I have no bill against you, whatever; and if you would stay a month, a year, or your life time, I should have no bill against you; for me and my family shall all feel lost when you leave us; we shall feel as though we. had lost one of our own family. Now, Mr. Russell, we are go- ing to have a ball here,-and a Masonic ball at that, -and I have made all calculations for you to stay." While the landlord and I were talking together, the landlady and her daughters had Maria in a pri- vate room, with their arms around Maria's neck, and were kissing her, and begging and pleading with her to prevail on me to stay till after the ball; and finally got her to pledge her word and honor that she would. Soon Maria went up to her private room, and she sent Mary to tell me to come, that she wanted to see me. I went up Xto see her; she said, "' Mr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, I want you to promise me on your word and honors-and I know you won't deny me, for you have too much love for me,-that you will grant my request." "Maria, my dear," I replied, "that is a hard question you have put to me, it may be something I can't do; it may be something impossible." ' Mr. Russell, I won't ask you to do any thing you can't do, for I have too much love and respect for you to ask you to do that, and I know you won't deny me, for you never yet denied me any thing that I have asked yoz."   DAVID RUSSELL.       355 "No, Maria, my dear, I never will deny you any thing in reason, that I can do." "now, 'Lr. Russell, my dear Mr. Russell, you know that those people have treated us with the highest respect and kindness, and had we been their own children they could not treat us better than they have done; and it will all but break their hearts if we leave them so suddenly, without giving them more notice. So Mr. Russell, my dear, I want you to grant me my request, and stay till after the ball is over."1 - " Yes, Maria, my dear, seeing it is your request, I will stay; though I have made every calculation to start this morning, and no one but yourself could prevail on me to stay; for Maria, my dear, we have a long journey to go, and it behoves us to make the best of our itime, and go on." Now   the camels were waiting at the door for us to get on, I then told William we- had concluded to stay till after the ball; he said he was - glad of it. After this we went to w ork to'fix for the ball. In a few days the ball come  off; it was a splendid ball Indeed;: every thing was in the most splendid order, and we had a superb supper, and every thing was in the best of order. After this ball was over, the landlord's daughters came up stairs to Maria. She asked them how they liked the ball? "O, Maria, I think it was a splendid ball, and there was some beautiful dancing there, I think Mr. Russell is the best dancer that I ever have seen in 4"  &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7685-00000183"/> 356      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF P my life; every one in thile room took notice of him, when he was on the floor."  "Yes, girls," Maria replied, " he is a good dancer, and wherever he has danced, they have given him that character." "Yes, Maria, and what a beautiful partner he is; it is impossible for you to make anlly mistake when you dance with him." I then said, "Maria, my dear, now you and Mary must be ready to start in the mnlorning." While we were talking, the landlady come up stairs. She said, "Mr. Russell, we have concluded to accompany you part of the way, myself and family,  in our chariot."  'a Well, ma'am," I replied, " we shall start very early in the morning." We now began to make preparations to start, and early next morning we Hleft with our camels and chariot. NTow the camels walked very brisk indeed, for they had a good rest; the chariot came with us to the first stopping place, where we stayed one hour, and when we come to part and bid them farewell, they leaned' their heads on our breasts and wept aloud. It was as much as we could do to leave them; j- at last we parted, and drove on, and the camels went  very smart, and we went a long distance the first day. We traveled all that night, and the next morning we came to a watering place, and we stayed there about  one hlour, and watered and fed the camels, and then  traveled on very lively. So we went along through hills and valleys, till at length we came to another  watering place, and we stayed here one hour, and    DAVID BUSSELL.       37 then went on. Now these watering places are from about two to three days and nights travel apart, and we went along lively, till we come to the little desert, and there we watered our camels, and stayed an hour, and tlien we went on again and crossed the little desert. After we had crossed the desert, we ascended a mount, called  Mount 'Calm."  We traveledon this Mount for some time, at length we descended it; when we came dowrn we crossed a stream that was very muddy, and run very fast. I asked William what n stream it was, and he said it was the " river Jordan." " Well," said I, " then William it cannot be over one hundred miles from here to Jerusalem." He said, " It is just one hundred ihiles to Jerusa- lem from here, and we will be there tomorrow night, or early thile next morning." We passed through Canaan of Galilee) and Samaria, and then we entered Jerusalem. "Now, William," said I   , ,  you  must take us to a place as good as the other we have left, I don't want a better place." He drove up to a low building on a sidehill, and it was very large on the ground; he, spoke to the land- lord, and we    were invited into a fine and   splendid sitting-room   ; from that we were invited into a   bath room  , and we went through the sam e performances as we did in- Egypt. A  fter this we   were called to dinner, and     a splendid dinner it was; and we had evvery thing thatl heart could w ish. After dinner we returned to our room.   &#xD;<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7685-00000184"/> 358      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF "Maria," said I, "how do you like Jerusalem, from what you have seen of it?" "Well, Mr. Russell," she replied, "I have not seen much of it as yet, to tell you, but what I have seen, I don't like as well as I did Egypt." "Well, Maria, my dear, tomorrow we will go around and see how we like it." Accordingly the next day William  drove us around the city, and we examined every place in the city of any note. The buildings are low and wonder- fully scattered, the streets are narrow, with the ex- ceptions of a few. There are a number of Turkish mosques, in the city, and some Jewish synagogues, and several Greek churches. There are splendid gar- dens and vineyards in and around the city; and we saw part of the ruins of the temple, and part of the ruins of many other ancient buildings. We also were on the Mount of Olives and Mount Calvary; and we saw all the ancient sepulchres; also we saw the sup- posed sepulchre that our Lord and Saviour lay in. We saw castles, and towers, and parapets, and monu- ments of different kinds. Then we returned back to the hotel. After we retired to our room, I asked Maria how she liked Jerusalem? "Well, Mr. Russell," she replied, "to tell you the truth, I don't like it near as well as I did Egypt." At this the landlord come in, and he gave me a sign, and I answered it; and he gave me three more, and I answered them; I then gave him one higher than any one he gave me, and he answered it; I gave him a still higher one, and he answered it; I -then gave him a higher one yet, and he answered it; I then   DAVID RUSSELL.      359 gave him one, still higher, and he answered it; I then gave him a sign higher than any I gave him before, and he could not answer it. "Mr. Russell," said he, "I am astonished at you." "Why so, sir?"I inquired. "As young a man as you to know more about masonry than I do; and I have been many years in the lodge. Mr. Russell, you must not be in a hurry about going away; you must stay with us a few weeks." I told him I thanked him, but as soon as the camels were rested enough, I had to leave. He was then called away on business, and I retired to my room. I then sent for William, and he soon came in. I then said, "William, when will you be ready to travel?." "Any time, Mr. Russell, when you are ready." "Well, William, I will let you know in two or three hours when I will be ready to go.!' After he left the room, I said, "Now, Maria, when will you be ready to go?" "Well, Mr. Russell, whenever you are ready to go, I am ready." "Well, Maria, I will tell William any time he is ready that we will go." Accordingly I went and told William, and he said he would be ready .early the next morning. We accordingly made preparations to start. I then told the landlord we should leave early in the morning. "Why, Mr. Russell," said he, "I had no idea you were going to leave under two or three weeks yet,- stay with us, and it shall not cost you any thing; I want to have some talk with you."  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7685-00000185"/> 360      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF "I thank you kindly, sir," said I, " but I have made promises that I must fulfill." "Well, Mr. Russell, I am heartily sorry you are going away; but how are you on for funds? You j are traveling a good deal, it must cost you con- siderable?" "Yes," I replied, "it is very expensive, but I think I can make out." He- said, "'Mr. Russell, if you want any thing, I will get it for you." "Sir," said I, "I think I shall be able to get along," and thanked him for his kindness. At length the next morning arrived, and- we had an early breakfast; after which William brought the camels up, and we got onl themi, and made the best of our way back to Arabia. In a few days we got out of the wilderness into the great desert, and the camels went along at a lively rate. I now said to Maria, "My dear, we are on our way home, and by the blessing of God, we shall be in Paris in one month or less. We will go to Arabia, and take the first vessel to Paris." By this time we stopped one hour to water and feed our camels, and then we moved along again. In the course of a few days we arrived in Arabia, and put up at the same hotel we stopped. at before. The next day we rode around the levee to find a vessel to - take us to Paris. Accordingly we found a French vessel bound to Paris, and we went on board. Maria talked to the captain in French, and he invited us down into the cabin, and we examined the berths and engaged passage for three. .   DAVID RUSSELL.  -3 The captain told us he thought we had better come on board in the'morning, for he did not know exactly  what time he should leave. So early the next morn- ing we went on board, and the next day the ship left for Paris. We had a fair wind, and a pleasant breeze, most of the way; and in a few weeks we reached Paris. We put up at the Lafayette hotel again. I  then said, "Maria, my dear, what is the best way and plan for me to do? I'intend to go to Boston to settle my business, and I think it is best to buy a neat little cottage for you and Mary to live in till I come back. We must examine the papers in order to find one."  Accordingly we examined the French and English papers, and we found a-very neat little cottage for sale about a mile from Paris. It was a handsome ottage, and well situated. 1 purchased it, and noved Maria and Mary, and a servant man on it. Ifter I got every thing fixed, I prepared to go to 3oston. About that time I received a letter sealed v vith a black seal. It gave me an account of the eath and burial of Maria Robertson, of England; it tated that as soon as she got home, she was taken ick, and still kept getting worse. It also stated that 'she could have seen me, she believed she would 3cover, and she told her parents to " take good care the locket that Mr. Russell gave me when he bid e his last farewell ; and to let no one have it.' She lowed her parents the copy of the writing that was rote in Edinburgh, stating what-I was willing to do, id charged them to lay no blame to me. She wrote rt of the letter herself, and after her death her 16  &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7685-00000186"/> 362      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF father finished it. He gave me an account of her death and burial, and he said that he was sorry that he did not let me marry her in Edinburgh. I then told Maria that as soon as she become set- tled, I should go to Boston, and be gone a short time. "Mr. Russell, my dear," Maria replied, "I hate to have you go away."  "Yes, Maria, my dear, I hate to go away as bad as you hate to have me. I shall not leave you until you are all fixed, and you are willing for me to go." We were now living happy and comfortable in our house, and Mary and Maria were delighted. Maria said, "Mr. Russell, my dear, you always told me that we should go that journey, and not a hair of our head should be hurt; and it was so, Mr. Russell. I don't suppose that ever any body had a better journey than we had, to go sO far." "No, my dear Maria, I don't suppose that any one could have a better journey than we had ; and how thankful we ought to be my dear Maria, to our heavenly Fatler, that he has permitted us to return safe back to Paris, where we started from; and we ought to pray earnestly to our heavenly Father that he will ever guide and protect us' "Mr. Russell," said Mary, "I want to ask you a few questions.?' "Well, my dear Mary, I shall endeavor to answer them." "Mr. Russell, what astonished me in all our travels more than any thing else, was, that you being a total stranger, as quick as you entered a house they   DAVID RUSSELL.       363 treated you as if you had been their own brother, and treated us as their own children, on your account." "Well, Mary, I will tell you, my dear; those men were masons, and tley were ' brothers ' in one sense of the word. So you see, Mary, on the account of their belonging to the same order that I did, it made it good for us all; afid we all reaped a benefit from it. Why, Mary, my dear, did you not see us all dressed with our scarfs and breast-plates, and badges on, at the ball in Malta, and in Egypt?" "Yes, Mr. Russell, I saw you all dressed beautiful, but I did not know what it all meant." "Well, Mary, my dear, you did not see any one in the room but those that had the scarf and badges on.2 "No, Mr. Russell, I did not. And, Mr. Russell, how beautiful they looked; and I took particular notice of you. Your scarf was the' handsomest one there ; it differed from all the rest." "Well, Mary, my dear, as much as the scarf dif- fers, we differ in order in masonry." "Indeed, Mr. Russell, you must .be a very high mason?" "Yes, my dear Mary, there was only one in the room among them  all, that was higher in the order than myself, and lhe was only one order higher. If I lad stayed in Malta two weeks longer than we did, I would have obtained that other order." Maria then said, "' Mr. Russell, my dear, you must stay with us one month.' "Well, my dear Maria, I shall1 stay as long as: you want me. I expect Mary and I can agree together."  &#xD;<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7685-00000187"/> 864      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OP Mary said, O, yes, Mr. Russell, you and I can agree- together." I remained with them a month longer; after that I fixed too go to Boston. I then went down to the levee, and hunted up a vessel bound for Boston; at length I found one that was to start in two weeks. I examihed the ship, and took passage; I then came back, and stayed the two weeks. -After, the two weeks had nearly expired I told Maria I should have to go aboard the vessel, or I might lose my passage. I then said to Mary, "My 'dear, now I am about to leave you, and I want yoa, my dear Mary, to promise me, on your word and honor, that you will stay with my dear Maria, and never forsake her as long as you live; I want you to be a good, kind girl to her, and do all that lays in your power for her, and give her that due respect and honor that belongs to her. I want you and Maria both to pray to your heavenly Father night and morning to guide and protect you, and to enlighten your minds, and to fill you with his holy Spirit, so that you may know hMis will, and do it. Also, I want you to remember me in your prayers to our heavenly Father, that' I may be guided and pro- tected from -all dangers in crossing the deep,- to my native land, and also that I may be guided safe back to Paris again." I then called the man-servant, who was an old man. I then said, "Now, sir, I am about to leave you for my native land; I want you to promise me, on your word and honor, that you will do every thing - that lays in your power-for my dear Maria here, and- you will give her that due respect that belongs to   DAfID RUSSELL.       365B her, and that you will honor and obey her, and do your best endeavors to protect her and Mary from all harm." He promised faithfully- he would do all I requested of him. "And also," I continued, " that you will pray to your heavenly Father to guide and protect you and' the family fromi all harm and danrgers; also that you will remember me in all your prayers to my heavenly Father, that he will guide and protect me from all dangers in crossing the deep, and -that he will gulide me safe back to Paris again." I then bid them all farewell, and then kissed Mary and Maria.  I told Maria to write to me soon after I left, and let me know all the particulars, and not miss anythng.  I then got in the carriage and went to the vessel, and got on board, and in about four weeks 1 landed safe in Boston. -After I landed I went around to see my folks; ;and after I visited all around, and settled up all my business, I went to Tennessee. About this time I received a letter from Maria and Mary, stating 'they were in good health, and -every thing was going on well. I answered it immediately; I told thiem that I was' settling up my business, and I should be back as soon as possible. After I  came back from Tennessee, which- was in about three or four weeks, I received another letter from Paris, sealed with a black seal. When I read it I found that my dear AMaria was dead and buried and it almost struck me to the ground. I then im- mediately prepared to go to Paris, and in a-few days took a  ship and left. I landed in Paris in about 16'  &#xD;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7685-00000188"/> 366      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF three or four weeks. As soon as I landed I went to the house, and settled up all my business in Paris as quick as I could, and after every thing was settled I came back to Boston. After ] returned I commenced mechanical business. I left Boston and went to Buffalo, in the State of New York. I entered into partnership with a carpenter and joiner, named Wil- liam Stacy, who was the best workman in Buffalo. We carried on business together some time, until William Stacy died. After his deathl I carried on business alone for a while, and- then moved to Little York, in Canada, which is now called Toronto. I then went into business as a contractor. I took Colonel Coufen's house to build. Colonel Coufen was Sir Perry iMatelin's aid-de-camp; he was Lord 'katelin, and governor of the Upper Province of Canada. I then built his house, and after that I took many other houses and built them. Then I took buildings on Young street, of different kinds, and also took mills of different kinds to build. I took buildings to build from one end of Young street to the other, which is thirty miles. I also took build- ings of all kinds, and mills of all kinds to build, from one end of Queen street to the other, which is about thirty miles. I also took buildings and mills of all kinds on Union street, from one end to the other. I also took buildings and mills on Dundas street to 'build. I also took buildings and mills of all kinds on both sides of Lake Simcoo I also took buildings to build on the Penetangoscein road. I also built buildings and machinery in Montreal, and also built 'a steam-oil mill, and several buildings in Quebec; I   DAVID -RUSSELL.       367 also built several mills of different kinds-in Tarbone; : I also did considerable business in the Bay of Canso, and in the town of Alsenbrook. I also did a great deal of business in the town of Cornwall, and in the Glengary settlement. I built the Catholic church in St. Catherine's, and a great many houses of different kinds-. I also built several locks on the Western Canal, and put 'several gates in other locks. I also built the Presbyterian church in the town of Simco, in the Talbot district. I also built a great many houses in the town and district. I built mills on the twelve and fifteen miles creek, and also did business on Chippewa creek, and on Lion's creek. I also did business in the town of Chippewa. I also did a great deal of business in the town of Drummonville, near Lundy's Lane. I also built the most!of the harbor that leads from Black Rock to Buffalo, in the State ,of New York, and I had about four hundred and fifty men under my employ, steady, all that summer, in the year 1824. I have also built buildings and mills in most of the Western and Southern States, and cotton gins, rice and sugar-mills. I have also invented machinery of different kinds, and taken out several patents. I have done business more or less in every State in the Union, and I have traveled nearly all over the world. I commenced^ traveling in the year 1810, and the object of my traveling the world over was to obtain the object of my desire, which never was obtained before by man; that is, to get the length of lever without diminishing speed, so that any power :may be obtained that is required, without diminishing  &#xD;<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7685-00000189"/> 368      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OP' speed.;' and I obtained it on a very simple prinhciple, and a principle that is not liable to get out of order, and all kinds of machinery cani be -driven on this principle, in the simplest manner, and this principle differs from all others in machinery that ever was invented by man, for it is done by surface, and not bv gearing, doing away with contact and friction, and causing surface to act instead; so that it causes weight when put in motion, to act as power by its revolving motion, and centrific force. So, by forming two revolutions in one, it acts in contra-gravity force, and also in centrifugal force, so that the further the weight is from the centre the more power it has over the centre; and in this principle any speed and power- may be gained that is required, for it is only to enlarge the circular railway, and to lengthen the lever in proportion 'to the railway, and to add suffi cient weight on the balance wheel, and to give width of surface on the railway, to overcome the resisting force of whatever power is driven.     . There is another great principle involved in this; *that is, I always hold fast to my fulcrum in the centre, without shifting it, or moving it; so that if my lever was fifty feet long, my fulcrum in, the lentre would only be six inches, which would give mSe a tremendous ,power. So by getting this power that all kinds of machinery can be driven by two or four horses, such as grist-mills, and saw-mills, and erice and sugar-mills-, and cotton 'gins, carding machines, clothing and spinning Imachinery, and sawing and polishing stone, and thrashing machines of every kind; corn crushers of every kind, and all' kindi:of   DAVID RUSSELL.       369 shop work, such as turning lathes, and' buz saws of all kinds; and, in fact, it is calculated to drive any thing that power is required to drive. This machine. can be -made fixed or portable, and itcani be made to any size that may be required. A one horse-power on this principle can be made, if made right, to do as muich as three or four horses on the old principle. Also this power can be made that a four horse-power on this principle can be made to do any kind of business, from driving one saw to a gang of saws; though on this principle I seldom use but two horses at a time, and often only one. Now this principle, as simple as it is, has caused a great deal of study, time, and expense; also a great deal of toil, and years of traveling in almost all parts of the world. Now this machine, if patronized by the public and the community at large, will prove to be one of the greatest machines that ever was in- vented by man, and also the most powerful machine that ever was invented. It will prove to be one of the most beneficial machines to the public, so that every one that uses this machine will find it to do all I have represented, and mnore, if it is properly made. This machine can be made to all sizes and all prices, according to the resisting force it has to drive. These machines can be built from one hun- dred to five hundred dollars, according to the size. I have now done all I can for the benefit of the community at large ; I have spent my time in travel- ing, and also a fortune in money, and devoted my toil and study, and a good part of my life to procure this machine, and many others, for the benefit of the  &#xD;<pb n="370-371 (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC7685-00000190"/> 370   AUTOBIOGRAPHY OP DAVID RUSSELL. community at large, and not for myself, for I had enough left me to keep me and mine my lifetime, and then have plenty left. Besides all this, as a true American I left England in the year 1811, and came to the United Sta-tes, and landed in Boston, the place of my birth, to defend lmy country, and support the honor of its flag. I then devoted my time iln deliver- ing lectures, and- exhorting the people to stand and fight for their rights. I persuaded my two cousins, i and they and I volunteered into the light cavalry, under Captain Chapens; and my two cousinis were killed at the battle of Lundy's Lane by my side, bine on- my right and the other on my left, and I escaped with a very severe wound. After the war was settled I then resumed my studies and traveling, and after many. years of toil and experiments I obtained the machinery that I now present to the public, and all I ask for my time, and toil, and money, is for the com- munity to use and patronize the machinery that I have procured, and offer to them.
