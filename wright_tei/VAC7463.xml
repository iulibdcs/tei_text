CHAPTER I. From youth's bright morning, 'Till noonday sun, We ever look forward For pleasures to come. "OH! won't we be happy to-morrow?" said a bright eyed, laughing child, of nearly eleven years. The morrow was her eleventh birth-day. Mrs. Grey had promised her little Cecelia a party on that d4ay, and it was in anticipation of the happiness then to be enjoyed, that Cecelia set out, on a lovely afternoon in June, to invite some young friends to spend the day with her. Many were the congratulations given and received; many the wishes that it would remain pleasant, that they might ram- ble in the fields and woods, or gather wild flowers to make them wreaths. At last they were all invited, excepting -her cousins, Alice and Emily Lee, of whom Cecelia was very fond.

Meanwhile, Cecelia, Alice and Emily busied themselves with other things , first tying on their hats, then making wreaths of evergreen to deck them with, or speaking of the brother of Alice and Emily, who was residing with a wealthy uncle, a brother of the father, engaged in the mercantile business, and who em- ployed Edgar in his counting-house. Edgar Lee saved all that he possibly could of his earnings for his mother and sisters, en- joying no holiday so well as when allowed to visit them. His uncle often gave him a few hours' leisure, which Edgar general-s ly employed in writing to his dear friends at home. The sis- ters had that day received a letter from him, stating his leave to make them a visit soon. Emily. "And he should be my brother," exclaimed Cecelia. "But Edgar will not come under a week yet."           Emily thought a week was a long time to wait. As it was getting late, Mrs. Grey bade Mrs. Lee good night; desiring her to be with them early the ensuing morning. On the'way home, Cecelia, who had observed the tears in her aunt's eyes, asked her mother why she wept. "My child," replied Mrs. Grey, " your aunt has endured many trials. Your uncle's death, succeeded by the loss of her property, was a severe blow. Mr. Lee was a kind and affec- tionate husband and father, in every sense of the word. He never denied his family any luxury; and your aunt was fashionably extravagant and thoughtless, thinking she could afford rich furniture and splendid parties, as well as others. I often expostulated with her, but to no effect.  She always said, "William is doing as good business as others-why not enjoy ourselves."

Your aunt is now a much better woman than when rocKfed in the cradle of affluence, for she can now see how wicked and selfish it is for those who are. blessed with wealth, to throw it away on useless articles of luxury, instead of help- ing the needy, who cannot, by the most strenuous effirtS, pro- vide themselves with the most common necessaries of life." "Perhaps, mother," replied Cecelia, "Aunt Lee will again be wealthy ; then she will know better how to take care of it." "That, my child, is very improbable. But if she should, I think she would know better how to enjoy it. There is more pleasure in giving than receiving, and as she received no real pleasure from her wealth, I should think, with her sad ex- perience, she would seek for it among the poor and afflicted." "' But mother," remarked Cecelia, " it costs a great deal to  make parties in the city. I should think she could have made all the poor comfortable."  "You know little of New York," said Mrs. Grey. "There are a great many destitute there. It would take a large sum of money to make them comfortable." "If they were assisted once, I would suppose they might    work and secure sufficient for their future wants ; enough, at  least, to keep them from suffering again ; that is, mamma, if they were not sick, so they could not labor." "Some people," said Mrs. Grey, " do not possess the faculty that others do, to accumulate property, though they may work ever so hard ; there are so many to take advantage of them, that their families are always in want. Then there are many widows and orphans, Cecelia. The poor ye shall always have with you, and whensoever ye will, you can do them good."' "I am sure, if I were rich," replied Cecelia, "I should love to give to the poor; it would make them so happy." "But if you were poor, Cecelia, do you think it would make you happy to receive gifts from others?' "I should -be grateful, mother, but I could not be happy, because I was so poor as to need assistance." '           !

CECELIA GREY; ORE THE  CHAPTER II.  Now let us look back, On the days that thrill    -  Our hearts with joy, And sadness, still.-           -:: MR. GREY, the father of Cecelia, resided in a beautiful coun. try house, situated in themidst of groves of chestnut, maple and sh. On the right was a large orchard of various kinds of fruit, and on the left a vegetable nd o garden. In the front of the house was a large grass plat, thickly strewn with rose-bushes, lilacs, and various other flowers; while four Lom-  bardy poplars threw thir long and un g shadows across  the lawn. Through a beautiful grove, in the rear of the house, a small stream of water rolled leisurely along. This rivulet abounded with trout, which was considered quite a treat by city friends; and gentlemen of fortune and leisure often spent a week or two in the heat of the season in fishing and strolling along its banks, enjoying the fresh air and beautiful scenery of groves, meadows, thick woods and miniature falls, interspersed with moss-covered seats and beatiful wild flowers. It was in one of those secluded del, where the thick branches overhung the steep banks of a deep ravine, and the water dashed from rock to rock down into a little gulf below, that Mrs. Grey, then Alice Clermont, strolled leisurely about, luctating wild owers, or singing natches of song. At last, standing close uponthe brink of the gulf, lost in deep thought,   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.  she was startled by a hand being laid gently upon her arm with: "You are presumptuous, madam ; one misstep and you would be plunged into the water below." Turning hastily around, she encountered the earnest gaze of a pair of fine dark eyes, bent admiringly upon her. With a blush, she replied,- "Perhaps so ; I was not aware of the presence of any one." Arthur Grey, for that was the gentleman's name, inquired if she lived near, saying he came there to pass a short time, and would be glad to procure good lodgings during his stay. She politely answered that it was but a short distance, and if he wished he could walk home with her, and if the location pleased him, she did not doubt her father would accommodate him,  Arthur Grey gladly accepted her invitation, and in a short time was as much at home with the Clermonts as if he had been an old acquaintance of the family. He informed them that he was an only child ; and his father having business in a distant part of the State, had closed his office, for he was a broker, and with his wife had left the city for the season, and that in consequence, he had come to Greenwood to pass the time of their absence. Mr. and Mrs. Clermont were much pleased with their boarder, while Alice was more than pleased with the society of the stranger. Arthur Grey considered Alice by far the best and most beautiful woman he had ever seen, and in fancy thought how proud and happy he would be to present- her to his parents and acquaintances as his wife. It is needless for us to say that Alice was deserving of all his praise. She was yet young, having hardly reached her seventeenth year ; with light blue eyes, and hair that hung in golden ringlets around her snowy neck. But it was not the loveliness of the form or features that attracted the attention  -       A*  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7463-00000006"/> 10       CECELIA GREY; OR; THE of all who formed her acquaintance; but the sweet simplicity and grace of her manners, so void of the artificial, while true piety threw into her conversation an attraction not often to be met with in city life. Arthur himself had an attachment to everything good and noble, and it was not to be wondered at that he should instantly feel an interest in Alice Clermont. Alice had only one. sister-Mary Clermont; she was fifteen, and as different in appearance as in character from Alice. Her eyes were large and black, and her hair of raven darkness. By many she was called the most beautiful of the sisters. By the casual observer, it was not strange that she should -be so called; but in disposition she was proud almost to vanity, and her anxiety for adulation exceeded. every other sentiment of her heart, while she wa's as fond of parties, rides, or sails upon the lake, as Alice was of retirement, and the peaceful occupations of home. "Sister Alice," said Mary, laughingly, one morning while dressing for a ride, and about a fortnight after Arthur Grey had made it his home with them, " do you not think that that city chap might improve in gallantry?'" "Why so?" said Alice, "he appears perfectly gentleman- like." "Well," replied Mary, "I don't care how he appears, as long as he is wanting in compliments; or, perhaps they are all j lost on you."                        i "Perhaps so," replied Alice; " but what then?"You have v no reason to be jealous, sister." "Oh, no," Mary replied, "but I should think he might   i admire a pair of glorious black eyes, and then I could turn his F sedate lordship over to sister Alice in welcome."      i "Mary, you are becoming an accomplished coquette," ob- served Alice. "I fear "  "Fear!" exclaimed Mary, "fear what?  No danger of    losing my heart, I guess ; I an only fifteen, and have a long time to live yet."   VIOISSTrruES OF FOROT E. V.

Besides, we might by that means save something for those that are in want, and secure for ourselves much plea- sure." "Want l" exclaimed Mary, while her eyes sparkled mischiev- ously, "I know who is in want ;" at the same time pointing from the window into the garden, where Alice saw Mr. Grey walking impatiently about, first to the arbor, then to the greenhouse, then towards the grove, as if in search of some one. Mary threw up the sash, saying: "Have you lost anything, Mr. Grey?. "Only Miss Clermont," said he,; "can you tell me where Alice is?"  Alice sprang forward, but it did not prevent Mary from re-v plying :                           . "Just behind the window curtain, watching your worship!" "Mary, you are really too bad," said Alice, reprovingly ; and bowing to Mr. Grey, she said she had just observed him, and would be down in a few moments. "No," exclaimed Mary, "that she shall not, until I am called away. She has cautioned me nof to ride through the village, for we might see the cars; or near the river, for we might see a steamboat; and then you know I But I mean to try my luck that way if the rest will."  "I should advise you," replied Mr. Grey, " to run no such risk. There are more secluded paths, where you could enjoy yourself, and not be in danger." Then simply saying to Alice, "I will await for you in the parlor," he walked away. Alice stood sadly thinking of her sister's avowed intention of riding in the vicinity of the cars. Well she knew the dan- , ger, and well she knew her fearlessness, when she had taken a fancy for any particular object. At last Mary completed her toilet, and asking Alice if she   VICISSTlruDEs OF FORTTUE.       13 did not look charming desired her to go down, for she looked as lonesome as a Jew in a nunnery, and she did not doubt Arthur Grey was in a hurry for a walk, or some other amuse- ment, and was very impatient for her appearance. Alice again urged Mary to choose the most retired roads, for she thought there was more danger in a large company than when two or three were ding alone. Contrary to her expectations, Mary declared she would keep out of mischief if possible, saying, for herself she did not care, but there might be others that were afraid. She did not anticipate any danger - "Snowdrop " was sure footed, and not so easily frightened that even Alice need feel any alarm. Reassured, Alice tripped lightly down, and found Arthur busy with a morning paper, which was more than usually at- tractive, on account of his absence from home; but it was more in fear of Mary's raillery, as he knew she would soon be down. Inquiring if Alice would like to hear him read, he commenced a short piece to amuse her. Alice smiled as she took her embroidery, and  listened attentively. In a moment the bell rang, and Charles Delong  entered the parlor, inquiring for Mary.   Alice sent for her, and she came down  ready, equipped, just as the rest of the company came up. Alice again desired her to be careful. Mr. Delong said she need give herself no uneasiness about  Mary; he would see that nothing happened to her; and  likewise warrant her, if she would accompany them  . Alice politely declined, and Mr. Grey wished them much pleasure as they drove  away. Then turning to Alice,-he in- quired if she were not fond of such excursions. "Oh I   yes, very," was her animated reply. h"Then why did you not accompan  y them  7 they appeared ver y a nxious to have you," resumed, Arthur. "I hardly kn ow why," said Alice  thoughtfully. "If a'gree able,  I will order horses brought around for us,' replied Arthur.  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7463-00000008"/> "       CECELIA GREY; ORB, THE "Do so, if you please; I should be very happy to accom- pany you." "While you are arranging your riding habit," said Arthur, "I will walk over to Mr. Malcom's ; he is quite ill, and it is feared will not get up soon, if ever, owing to his former poor health. His family are almost destitute. Thinking to have you go with me, I wished you to come down. But we will  postpone the visit until to-morrow."  Alice went quickly up stairs, wondering how Arthur Grey   , should know so much about Mr. Malcom's family. Arranging her toilet in haste, she went out upon the piazza to await the arrival of the horses and Arthur. Arthur stayed but a few moments, and upon returning, took a seat beside Alice. It was a lovely day in August; the light clouds flitted across the sky, changing the landscape alternately from sunshine to shadow, or from shadow to sunshine. Soon the horses were brought to the door, and placing Alice upon her horse, Arthur sprang into the saddle, and they galloped away. Alice was an excellent horse-woman, and had been in the daily habit of riding from her childhood. Her "Flying- cloud," as she called her coal-black steed, stepped proudly, and gracefully with his light burden, Alice gently stroked his wavy mane, as she said to Arthur, "Is he not beautiful, Mr. Grey?" "He is, indeed," replied Arthur, "and very docile, I should think. Which road shall we take, Miss Clermont?" "Whichever you choose, Arthur," replied Alice.  "Then we will ride through those lovely woods, to the little  lake, which is the head of that beautiful stream, which winds  through your father's farm." . "Mr. Grey!" exclaimed Alice, "excuse my impertinence ; but I have great curiosity to know if you have ever visited Greenwood before?"  "Alice," replied Arthur Grey, "I have been here ere this,   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       15 when passing to and from school; and I have spent some Vacations in the village." "I think we had better leave our horses here," he resumed, as they came to a little farmhouse, where there was a-cross- road through the woods to the lake. Accordingly they alighted, and Arthur, leaving the horses in charge of a young man, they proceeded forward at a slow pace, through a foot-path overgrown with wild grass and vio- lets, while overhead it was arched with the thick branches of lofty trees, interlaced with the wild grape-vine. Alice felt an unusual depression of spirits, for which she could in no way account. Arthur tried in vain to converse cheerfully, but his own thoughts prevented him, for he had chosen this occasion, which was too good to be lost, to make known his affection for Alice, that he might learn whether he could hope for a return. He was daily becoming more deeply interested in her, and a sojourn there might make it dangerous to his future peace unless Alice's feelings were reciprocal with his own. Arthur requested Alice to sit down and rest on the moss-cover- ed banks, which here and there clustered upon the sides of their path, while he gathered some of the berries which grew there in abundance. Alice complied, and after waiting a few moments, Arthur re. turned with some of the bushes, loaded with the luscious fruit. "Thank you," said Alice, as Arthur presented them to her, "you are too generous ; you must retain some for yourself." "I gathered them for you, Alice," he replied. "If you wish me to enjoy this fruit," resumed Alice, "you must partake with me." Arthur laughingly replied, that it would certainly relish bet- ter, coming from her fair hand. Alice thanked him with a smile, observing she had thought him no flatterer. "Indeed, I am not," he resumed. "If you are sufficiently rested, we will proceed," offering his arm for her support  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7463-00000009"/> 16       OECELL a REY; OR, THE "Do you not think we will be too late for a sail," inquired Alice. - "Oh, no," replied Arthur, looking at his watch ; "it's only eleven now."'  "So early?" said Alice ; "I had thought it much later." Arthur looked sad, but made no immediate reply. Alice had unwittingly pained him. The time seemed long to her,  not that she did not enjoy his conversation, but an unusual    feeling of danger had haunted her all day. She feared not for herself; too well she knew her protector, to think he would - : lead her where there could be any danger. But she feared that - something might happen to Mary; for that reason she felt in a  hurry to get back, but would not speak her fears to Arthur, for she thought he might think her superstitious. In a short time they arrived at a little bower-like bay, where they found a sail-boat, placed there for the accommoda-  i tion of visitors. Arthur loosened the boat, and Alice sprang lightly into it, and after following her he rowed away. Ar- thur was not much of an oarsman, and he concluded not to   - risk themselves far from the land. "Alice-Miss Clermont," said Arthur, after a long and em-    barrassing silence.     -  Alice looked up, and was much surprised that he said no more, while he seemed again to be lost in thought, as he stead- i ily plied the oars.                      E Alice, smiling, inquired if he was " watching for fishes, or what he saw so attractive down in the water?"For her part,  U she thought the beauty of the scenery far more interesting, as they could not, hope to captivate any of the finny beauties, without bait or hook.                     i  Arthur replied that he hoped to captive his prize without either; he was not thinking of fishes, water, or scenery,    although there was enough to admire in each, and to one who   had passed the greater part of his life in the city, it was thrice  beautiful.                           j * X i   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.  "Ah I ah I no 1" replied Alice, "I am sure you could not admire or love the beauties which nature has so beautifully spread around us-in the craggy rocks, the tangled wild woods, or over the glowing landscape, more than I do." "I am well aware of that, Alice ;" he said, " but there are few ladies like you,-at least, among those with whom I have formed an acquaintance, that can so well appreciate everything sublime or beautiful, and give it a home in their heart. Indeed, I know of several young ladies who would say this lake is a dark and dreary looking place, those craggy rocks frightful monsters, and in fact the scenery the most horrid imaginable." "You must surely be joking ; I never saw any one that did not love to visit this lake," observed Alice. "Possibly they might like to visit the lake," resumed Arthur but not to enjoy its location, or the beauties that surround it; but merely as a pastime. Some have no higher idea. of life than to see how  they can make it seem the shortest. They are constantly looking forward for pleasure, and for that reason cannot enjoy their present happiness. I have much to tell you, Alice, much which I fear has never had   a place in your thoughts; shall I run the boat close to that bank of violets-and wild flowers, where the trees overhang the water? The water seems very deep just below the bank, and I think we can pluck some of those beautiful flowers safely." Alice said she had a collection of flowers, but none of that kind, which were seldom met with, and she should be much pleased with them. Arthur soon secured a  handful, saying; "You desired to know how I became so well acquainted in this vicinity. I was not much acquainted with the inhabitants, but knew the Mal- coms by their untiring industry, and extreme poverty. When stopping at the hotel, in going to and from school, I often observed Mr. Malcom, and heard remarks in relation to the family. Your father saying that. he was not expected to live, was the reason of my going to the Malcoms ; and as-I told you,  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7463-00000010"/> 18       OECELIA GREY; OR, THE I spent some vacations here, first attracted by the beautiful Deforests and the diversified scenery, which everywhere meet the view.- And lastly," and his voice almost lowered to- a whisper, "by a pair of bright eyes, rosy cheeks and wavy hair ; and when I was assured her heart was far better, her mind more gifted, more lovely than her person, I longed to make the acquaintance of the fair stranger; an opportunity soon offered to visit this place, which I immediately took advantage of, and planned a fishing excursion, to make it my home in your father's house. In this plan I succeeded far better than I had antici- pated. And hour 'by hour, day by day, as I watched the unfolding of your truly noble mind, my affection for you, Alice, increased, until I found it impossible to be happy without you ; and now it needs no more to tell you my thoughts, dearest Alice. May I hope you will reciprocate my affection. I love  i you deeply, devotedly, and truly., Alice, say, will you, can you be mine-my wife? to my father a daughter, to my mother a  companion. Say, Alice, can I hope?" Alice timidly raised her eyes. "Arthur, you may," she replied, -with one look of love. Until that moment she had not read her heart. She thought she loved his society, for the rich stores of knowledge which his conversation displayed, and for his gentle, unassuming ways, But now she read it all; she loved and was loved; and she trembled, yet was happy, as she gave her heart away. And what shall we say for Arthur? He was happy, su- premely happy, for he had won her whom he first loved, who  d was so noble, so gifted. For a long time they sat there, ex- changing vows, or telling of happiness to come, till Arthur, observing the lateness of the hour, said:          t "We must not expect perfect happiness, here. There is    always trouble to come but we will not let that chill our   present happiness. Let us hasten home, or we' shall have them I all looking after us."                     Then they returned to the little bay, where they left the I   VICISS1'UDES OF FORTUNE.        19 boat, and walked quietly through the woods, to the farmhouse; and mounting their horses, were soon bounding fleetly towards " home. It was almost dark, and the horses seemed to feel some of their impatience. On their arrival at the residence of Mr. Clermont, they were surprised to see the carriage at the door, and her father and mother about stepping into it. "Whither so fast, father," inquired Alice, springing from her horse. "Your sister has been thrown from her horse, and taken up for dead," replied Mr. Clermont. "Follow us, without delay; Mr. Grey will be your escort." He then drove quickly away. Alice turned, and fell insensible to the ground, and in that state was carried to her room, where we will leave her for the present, and look after poor Mary,  .  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7463-00000011"/> 20       CECErLIA GREY; OR, THE CHAPTER      III.

MARY CLERMONT left her home on the morning of the ride in high spirits. To her companions she seemed even more elated than usual. She was always so gay and thoughtless that she was a general favorite.  Although she often wounded the feelings of others, she had not a bad heart ; and her jokes were always so unintentional  on her part, that they were seldom thought of, only to be laughed at and forgotten.                    She accosted her companions with--           "A merry good morning to you all, ladies; I challenge you, each one and all, to follow me who dare.  Snowdrop, you hear: you must jump every fence or creek you come to."1 "Now, Mary," said Charles Delong, "do try and not get into' any mischief to-day ;.you know I promised Alice to take  care of you, and consider myself responsible for your safe return to-night."  "Oh, yes,/I know I promised something to that effect myself.    -  VICISSITUDES OF FORBTUN .      21 I revoke my orders; Snowdrop, you may move as slow as a church mouse, if you please, no one will hurry you." Snowdrop, here shaking the reins, bounded swiftly away, and with merry lauohs they all followed. Mary, looking back and seeing them coming at such a head- long rate, thought of her promise, and reined her horse to the fence, an example which the most of them followed, just in time to save one of the ladies a fall. "Why did you not break your neck, Hannah? you could have tied it," said Mary. "I might if I had yours," was Hannah's reply. "It is very wrong, girls, for you to talk so," said an old gentleman near the fence, who had been watching them. You are not aware of the great danger that lady escaped just now ; she might have been killed, and perhaps some of you will be yet, before you get home. Do you think you would be pre- pared?"  "I don't know what the rest have done; I have not pre- pared yet," replied Mary ; I want to take all the comfort. first, and prepare to die afterwards." "Is your life insured?" said the old man, solemnly. "My life!" answered Mary. "Life insured? Not as I know of, yet I expect to live many years. But you have spoiled all of my happiness for to-day." "I wouldn't spoil your happiness, miss," resumed the old man ; "I only wish to increase it ,; for if you were prepared to die, you would be far happier than you have ever been, being better prepared to meet, without trouble, the slight but many disappointments to which youth is ever liable." "Oh l" replied Mary, "I don't know as I have ever done anything so very bad in my life, and I shall go on and try to forget we ever met," and started off to overtake the rest of the company, who had got quite a distance in advance. "  Now, Snowdrop," she soliloquized, " don't you bring me in contact with such a strange old man again.

"And that was the reason you ran away," replied Mary. Frank Dunbar said they were "a couple of silly gooses, to be  forever talking nonsense."  "Would you not like to talk nonsense too, you old batch . 1 laughed Mary, " you should have stayed South among the ne- groes ; they could appreciate your wisdom." "I have often been present at their gatherings, and I never  heard so much nonsense as I have today," resumed Dunbar. "Very likely, indeed; will you take the lead of our conver- sation, Mr. Dunbar!" said Hannah Murray, sarcastically.  "Oh, no," replied Dunbar, "I do not think myself competent to do so ; but where there is so much nonsense, I know there must be some sense; but it is rather hard to get at it." Well," interposed Mary Lee, " we will have a debating  school for your benefit soon." "Stop your joking, girls," said Mr. Dellivan, "we will stop here and get some water; just ride up to the door, and we will wait upon you, ladies." The landlord of the inn stepped to the door, and was re- quested to bring them water, which being brought, was passed around by a black boy.  "Here is a specimen of Frank Dunbar's southern friends, exclaimed Mary; "let us ask him some questions."   VICISSITUDES OF FORTTUiE.      23 "Miss Clermont," observed Dunbar, "I have white friends as well as black at the -South. As for your intimating my friendship for the blacks as a disgrace, it is a disgrace of which I am- proud. They are as respectful, devoted, and attached to those that are- kind to them, as they are revengeful and mali- cious to those that ill treat them. There are those that will suffer to almost any degree, and still lift up their voice in behalf of their cruel master, or for him would spill the last drop of blood in their veins. It is this class that I am proud to rank as my friends," then bowing lowly to Mary, he passed to another part of the company. "Can it be, thought Mary, that I have seriously offended him?-Papa would be much grieved, for he dearly loves the society of this old batch from the sunny South. Well, a-lack- a-day, as old Mrs. Malcolm says, I must make friends again." "Here waiter," she exclaimed, "give Snowdrop some water, hold the tumbler to his mouth; has he not a right to be wait- ed upon?" The boy was for a moment frightened, then said: "May I not give it to him in a pail, marm?" "' Yes, if you will get the water pail," Mary replied. As soon as the boy disappeared on his errand, she drove away. The boy quickly returned with the water, and to com- fort him, Frank Dunbar ordered him to give his horse a drink, and putting some silver into his hand, he too turned away. The rest of the company soon followed, and found Mary helping a little child into her lap to give it a ride. "There, Mary!" exclaimed Frank Dunbar, " I should never have thought that of you; I didn't know you possessed so much consideration for others, I have a mind to make friends again." "Do so--you will never repent it," replied Mary. "So be it then," replied Dunbar; "but don't joke any more at my expense." 'No, never," responded Mary.  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7463-00000013"/> 24       OECELIA GREY; OR, THE "There is the forest, yonder the river," exclaimed Dunbar with enthusiasm, pointing to the east ; " how lovely it looks  from this rise of ground, meandering through those meadows  and swamps, overgrown with willows so thick as to almost pursuade us it must be dry land."  "The river does truly look lovely," responded Mary, " espe-  cially whgre the sun strikes it yonder in the distance, at the  foot of that high mountain ; how it glistens and sparkles with all the rich hues of the rainbow."               "Indeed I it seems as if painted with fairy fingers of some  angel bird," continued Dunbar. "Then there is the pleasure house in the woods, backed by that high mountain. On one side the rolling river, on the other the little bay where the boats lie so securely at anchor. "This is a noble sight; man's works are truly insignificant,  when viewed with the power and grandeur of the handy work  J of our Creator."- "Ah, Dunbar!" exclaimed Mary, " how I wish I was more. like you or sister Alice ; then I could always find something  to admire, which would ever make me- contented with myself  and all around me ; while now I only find too much to annoy.  I fear I give too much thought to things that are calculated  to create discontent." A "Why I Mary," replied Dunbar, "I had no thought'that  you could ever be discontented with anything!"d  "Well, I am not often," replied Mary, " unless it is when I have no one to tease, or when I have no one to praise me ; you  know I am particularly susceptible to flattery."      : "I am very sorry, Mary,'j replied Dunbar; "you will, sooner or later, learn the vanity of such things; when it is too late,  perhaps, for your peace of mind."  "Oh I I mean to mend my ways," said Mary, penitently, "which I most assuredly should have done before now, if all gentlemen were like Mr. Dunbar." "Flattery," replied Dunbar, "is an adulation which many   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.        25 are weak enough to indulge in, under the mistaken idea that the person they flatter is fool enough to believe their empty nonsense, and esteem them as their best friends ; which, I am sorry to say, is often the case." "I have never been guilty of flattering any one," said Mary; "and if I am fond of being flattered, I despise a fawner as much as I am capable of despising anything; but excepting yourself, Mr. Grey and Alice, I never knew any one that did not make it a business to do so at every opportunity." "There are many gentlemen," continued Dunbar, "who consider it the height of ill manners, if they become acquaint- ed with a beautiful woman, not to compliment her ; but for my part, I consider it insulting to do so. If a lady has beauty, is it reasonable to expect that she does not know it? or if ac- complished, can it make her better to hear it commented upon at every turn?"' It is the occasion of a great deal of deceit and false pride, which should be done away with in good soci- ety; and good common sense substantiated for the false glare and glitter of polished life. I do despise this cringing and fawning, which you so often meet with, even among near friends and relatives; while it is disgusting to see the man of wealth who thinks his poor relative is hardly fit to take a place beside him in his carriage, or at- the table, stand up with all the pomposity of a sultan and receive the humble salutation, of what? perhaps his   poor brother, or it m ay be his gentle sister, when circumstances has placed him above them in point of wealth, wit h a cold and haughty, 'I am quite well, I thank you,' and with a look of scorn or a gathering of his costly garments around him, as if' afraid they would come in contact with the thread-bare  apparel of his poor relatives, who per- haps had, folded him in their arms in their youthful days, or they rambled together over  hills and through groves, or play- ed and studied together at school, or closed their eyes in peace- ful slumber in the same old garret."

"Well, have it so," he replied, laughing. Immediately after leaving the boat, they repaired to the pleasure house, and amused themselves in various ways, till the sun set behind the hills, and then set out for home. Charles Delong came to place Mary upon her horse, saying that he bad quite lost sight of her all day ; that Mr. Dunbar had monopolized her entirely. "You recollect," he continued, "you must be very careful and not get into any mischief on the way home." Mr. Lee then rode up. "You have a beautiful horse," he said, addressing Mary, " what may it's name be?" "Snow drop," replied Mary; "do you not think it very appropriate?" " I do, indeed!"  said Lee; " it is well adapted to the milky whiteness of its color. You manage him well ; I should think  him no stranger to your voice."

"Not in the least, sir; I love riding above all things." "We will look at you with pleasure, the very first ditch we find," said Hannah Murray. "There is one now; if it gives you so much enjoyment, you certainly 'will not deny us ."  "You shall see," returned Mary. "Will you promise to follow, if I go over safe?" "That I will," said Hannah ; " but go along if you' are not frightened."

Mr. Lee sprang quickly from his horse, and taking Mary's insensible form in his arms, tried in vain to restore her to con- sciousness, while Hannah Murray wept, and blamed herself, say- j ing she was the cause of Mary's death, and then fell into fainting fits.                        I Mr. Dunbar was the only calm one in the company. He told  some to convey Mary and Hannah to the nearest house, while he dispatched one for a physician, and Charles Delong vol- unteered to bring her parents.  They both arrived at almost the same moment, and found  Mary still in a state of insensibility. The good people of the : house had exhausted their skill to bring her to consciousness.  The physician opened a vein, and they had the pleasure of see- X ing her revive; when gazing quickly around, she called for  Alice. Her parents bent eagerly forward, and Mrs. Clermont  replied:              "You must be very quiet) Alice will soon come."  Mary moved to speak again, when the physician told her to  ask no questions that night, but promised that on the following day she would be able to sit up ; adding that if she was not  still, he was fearful it might throw her into a brain fever. 1 Mary made no reply, but closed her, eyes as if to shut out  the reality of her situation. For a long time she thought of  her carelessness, and how easy it might have been for her to  have arrived at home in safety. If she had only thought, she j was sure she would not have fallen. If she had fulfilled her promises to Alice, she would not have run the risk of getting  killed for the sake of showing her proficiency in an art in  which so few ladies excell.  "Oh dear, how my head aches," she sighed.  !] ' *^!   VICISSITfUDES OF FORTUNE.       31 Her mother bent fondly over her, bathing her hot temples, and smoothing back her raven tresses ; telling her to be very quiet, or not to think of anything, but try to sleep. Mary almost smiled at her mother's charge, and to relieve her anxiety, feigned sleep ; but her mind was far away, some-: times reflecting upon her conversation in the morning, with the old man ; then of her reckless remark to Hannah Murray, then again of the unnecessary trouble she had occasioned herself; and long before she closed her eyes in slumber, resolved that she would no more be the careless and thoughtless creature she had been in days gone by. Mary was not seriously injured, having been merely stunned -by the heavy fall. The morning found her, as the doctor said, almost well, with the exception of some slight bruises. Not so with Alice ; she awoke to consciousness, in a violent nervous fever, raving incessantly that Mary was killed; that she had neglected to go with her ; that if she had dtone so she would not have been injured. Mr. and Mrs. Clermont wondered what had kept Alice from. coming; and as their carriage was close and easy, and Mary insisted that she was quite well, resolved to return home, which they did at an early hour the ensuing day.,o They were not a little surprised and grieved, on learning the effect of Mr. Clermont's thoughtless announcement of Mary's injuries to Alice. Mary felt deeply the agony of her sister's mind. "I am not deserving of so much love from her," she ex- claimed. The physician whom Mr. Grey had called now came in, and informed them that they need feel no alarm. Alice only need- ed to be quieted ; a few hours sleep, and her sister's safety, would fully restore her. The next morning but one found both the sisters at the breakfast table., Mr. Grey and Alice were unusually reserved, which Mary  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7463-00000017"/> 32       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE would surely have made the occasion of some remarks at their expense, had she not, for the first time, thought it might i grieve her sister; so she contented herself with the idea of ! Mr. Lee and Mr. Dunbar's dining with them that day. Mr. Clermont left the table and entered the library, where Mr. Grey, after giving a sad smile to Alice, followed him. He  tapped lightly at the door, and Mr. Clermont bade him "come 1 in," where we will leave him to win Mr. Clermont's consent to his union with Alice.  Alice, too, left the dining-room, and went out on the piazza, where she appeared to amuse herself by pulling to pieces buds and blossoms of her favorite geranium. Mary watched her a moment from the window, and then turning to her mother with a faint smile, said: "Do you know, mamma, I believe Alice is engaged."  "Engaged!" exclaimed Mrs. Clermont, "impossible!"II "But, did you observe her and Mr. Grey?" resumed Mary,  "how very still they both were this morning-then the look Alice exchanged with him, when he arose from the table?    He has joined papa in the library, and he was so attentive :t when Alice was sick. I would really like to tease them, they , both hate it so i"                     I Mrs. Clermont looked sad, and replied :i "I should be very sorry to part with Alice, but I do not know as we could secure her future happiness more surely,  i than by giving her to Arthur Grey. I think him worthy of  : her, and that is saying much in his praise."  "Oh 1" resumed Mary, "you will have me left, and if I am not so good as Alice, you can make me so; at least, I will  keep you from being lonely." Mrs. Clermont smiled, and then joined Alice.  Alice had been longing to tell her mother of her engagement with Arthur, and crave her blessing on their union. Mrs. Clermont cheerfully consented, on condition that she should stay at home another year, as she was very young.  - I   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       33 After this, Mrs. Clermont retired to her room, to give vent to her grief in a flood of heart-felt tears. She did not wish Alice to see her sorrow,for she knew her sensitive mind would be pained, and she dreaded the effect on her. Mr. Grey soon joined Alice, and they rambled forth to en- joy the morning air. "Alice," said Arthur, "do you know that I am more happy than I had any idea I could be a short time since? I knew your father tenderly loved you, Alice, and I feared he would think me not worthy'of you. But he not only consented to our union, but said he believed me worthy of you I And then with tears in his eyes he said that I was asking him for the greatest treasure he possessed on earth, and that he wished to enjoy your society for one year yet. I could not refuse ; but it is a great while to wait! I was in hopes I could bear you to our city home on my return." "My mother has consented too, Arthur," said Alice, her bright, eyes bathed in tears. "She likewise desires me to stay with her another year. Indeed, I think it necessary. I have much to learn to fit me for a housekeeper." "You need give yourself no trouble on that account," said Arthur, " for my mother is a proficient housekeeper, and will prefer to look after the servants, or oversee them herself." "But she might be sick," resumed Alice, "or away on a visit. At least, we cannot expect her always to be with us, and it would be best for me to be acquainted with the cares and duties which in time will devolve upon me." "Oh!" exclaimed Arthur, "there will be time enough to learn without your undertaking it now. You must try to en- joy yourself while you may. Write me long letters when I am away; that is the only care I would have you perplex yourself with." "Do not call that a care," replied Alice, "it will be my greatest pleasure. I assure you it will add not a little to my store of happiness, to know that I am capable of making home 2*  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7463-00000018"/> 34       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE        -I a happy place-a place to which the weary wanderer could  turn back, and say, ' there I shall find rest, peace and happi- ness-there loving hearts and sweet, smiles will welcome me i' " "But I shall never wander off alone -any more, Alice," said  Arthur. "I wish for no joy in which you cannot participate, : and home would always be attractive while you were there to  ,f be its light, its life, and joy."         .! "And we will live only for each other, Arthur," added Alice.                            -  "I am sure we shall not have to go from home to find that  enjoyment so many seek for in the gay and fashionably misera-  ble world," said Arthur. "All are not miserable, Arthur," returned Alice; "some   ? must be happy, or there would not be so many seek those halls Ai of revelry."         . "Some, I think, do enjoy scenes of empty festivity and   -b mirth," continued Arthur; "they love to watch the busy throng. Every one is in the pursuit of happiness. Some seek X it in the giddy dance, others in the witching smile of beauty,  or the rich strains of thrilling song, and the costly array of dress and furniture; some, perhaps, go to feast on dainties, or . to drain the golden cup. And then again, there are others  that congregate to feast the mind, to drink the thrilling words X that fall from the lips of the gifted, the wise, and the learned of our land. But many, very many, I fear, meet to forget the i past, to hide the future from their view, and to try to make them- selves happy for the present moment. To-morrow, dearest    ! Alice,-I must return to the city. I shall write often, and shall expect you to do so. When, my Alice, shall I return to claim my bride?            " t Not under a year,- Arthur, you know," replied Alice. : "Well, then," said Arthur, " one year from to-day, Wednes- day, I shall return and take you to my father's house. We will be married in the morning in the old church; then take ko'   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.        35 leave of your friends, and away. I will be with you a week before our wedding morn, and have everything ready for our journey; shall it be so, Alice?" As you please," she replied, and they returned to the house. At evening, they all met in the dining-room. Mr. Grey was pleased and surprised, on seeing his most intimate -friend and school-mate 'occupying a seat at the table. "William Lee l" he exclaimed, before they could present him, "is this a vision or a reality?" Mr. Lee was no less astonished than was Arthur at his presence. "And how came you here?" was the mutual inquiry. Mary and Alice were equally pleased at this unlooked for announcement, and the conversation was entertaining and agreeable. Mr. Lee wished to know how long Arthur would remain in Greenwood, and expressed his regret that he must leave so soon. While Arthur tried to pursuade him to return to the city with him. "No, no i" exclaimed William Lee, " you need-not hurry me away ; I am not yet half acquainted with Greenwood scenery. I must stay to view the lake, the forests, and hook one large trout from its hiding-place below the rocks." Dunbar said he could not spare him then ; he needed his assistance to settle his business ere he returned South; and his friends had promised him a hearty welcome, whenever he chose to visit Clermont Place. Lee said he should improve every opportuntly to profit by this privilege, and they'must not expect his visits would be few or far between. 'Mr. Clermont invited them both to make his house their home. In a short time, and to Dunbar's great surprise, they found themselves domesticated under Mr. Clermont's roof. To Alice, this was a source of no thought ; but to Mary is was the cause of great anxiety, for she had not been in the habit of prepar-  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7463-00000019"/> 36       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE              ing for company in the morning, and the time she usually spent at her toilet was extremely short. She now found it necessary to exert herself more than was her custom, for she was anxious to please the " handsome and interesting stranger," as she designated Mr. Lee. Her father had noticed her desire to please strangers, and ? in order to cure her of her negligence, he had urged Dunbar and Lee to make it their home with him during their stay at  i ' Greenwood.                         i1 At a late hour the party separated for the night; Alice and Arthur to regret their hasty separation, and think over the  t many changes each might be liable toundergo during the lapse of one year. Mary and Mr. Lee took a seat by the window,   ,; to think over the many events which had transpired within a  I few days, of interest to them alone. They were mutually pleased with each other ; Mary loved his frank and generous  . truthfulness, while she wondered that she could not remember i any remark that he ever addressed to her; and then again,    why she had never tried, as she had always done before, to  V tease or perplex him whenever an opportunity offered.     ! "Ah!" she soliloquized to herself; " what am I thinking of??i No danger of losing my heart, I hope, especially unasked for." ! Then again she asked herself, "Even if he should desire me to marry him, would I consent? No I no I I am only fifteen, and I intend to remain heart-free, at least until I am twenty-five- - time enough to get married then. I would not be tied up all the best days of my life; it is as well to be old when I must be, and not before."  With these reflections she left Mr. Lee, and ; joined Alice in her room, where she was soon in a sound   a sleep.      *                      i Not so with William Lee. He felt that he loved that gay  X and pleasure-seeking girl. "If I can win. her heart," he thought, "I can surely entice her from those scenes of dissipa- tion which she loves so well. She will surely be fond of home, i and the society of art and genius with which I will surround   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.        37 her. Her home shall be so tasteful that she will not need to leave it to seek for happiness elsewhere. She is young, and I will spend all my leisure time with her. It will indeed be strange if I cannot reclaim her rom her love of fashion ; at least I mean to try." And thus he sat, almost the whole night, forming plans for future happiness, while Dunbar dreamed of his little wife at home, and of the myrtles and the orange groves of the sunny South.  The morning was a sad one to all but Mary, who had deter. mined to enjoy herself. She was dressed tastefully to the agreeable surprise of her mother and sister, but her father had anticipated this change at the breakfast table; and as he greeted her, he gave her a knowing smile, which brought the quick blood to her cheek and brow. Mary turned impatiently away, murmuring, "I will not be so particular another morning ;" but the look of admiration which Mr. Lee cast over her neatly arranged dress, fully repaid her for the mortification she felt at her father's smile of deri- sion. "No wonder," thought she, " papa felt a little displeased, as well as gratified, at this change for the better. Alice has often told me that my parents were as deserving of respect as the most fastidious stranger, and that it was not right for me to appear so slatternly before them ; but as for that, there are very few for whom I would make this distinction." They breakfasted in silence, with the exception of an ani. mated conversation between Mr. Clermont and Dunbar, who ever found something interesting to discuss. Arthur and Alice hardly ventured to raise their voices, for fear of calling the attention of the others to themselves. Mary and  Mr. Lee were too much occupied with their own thoughts to converse. As for Mrs. Clermont she was usually very still, and listened to the conversation between her husband and Dunbar with evident satisfaction.  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7463-00000020"/> 38       CEOELIA GREY ; OR, THE Breakfast over, Arthur took a hurried leave of the family,  J and then turning to Alice, whispered: "Remember, write often, dearest Alice--good by."  Alice replied only with a sad loving smile, and in a moment more, Arthur was gone.  y14   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       39 CHAPTER IV. ALICE retired to her room as soon as Arthur had left them. She was no longer the contented and happy girl of former days. Her heart went with her betrothed, and she knelt humbly to implore the divine protection and blessing to follow him through all his paths of life. Mary' and Mr. Lee were con- stantly riding or walking together, and were almost inseparable during the month of his stay in Greenwood. The mother began to dread the loss of both of her children, but he went away without soliciting the hand of Mary from her parents, although he had sought and won the love of the gay and bril- liant beauty, and ere he left her, he informed her that he would return in one year, and if she remained true to him, he should solicit the consent of her parents, and when she arrived at the age of seventeen, take her to a home of their own. Mary felt quite- as lonely as Alice after William Lee had left them, and the house was almost gloomy to Mr. and Mrs. Clermont, who hoped they would have no more visitors if they took all the gaiety of the children with them. "Never mind, mother," exclaimed Mary, "Mr. Grey will bring it all back with him." "Ah i" sighed Mr. Clermont, "if Mr. Grey has taken Alice's heart away, where is yours? I do not hear its music now as I formerly did."                    ! Mary blushed deeply, as she replied: "Mine 1 oh, it is mourning with Alice's."  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7463-00000021"/> 40       CECELIA UBEY; OR, THE  "I feared so," replied Mr. Clermont j Again that deep blush crimsoned Mary's brow and neck    I with painful intensity.  "Do not tease the children," interposed Mrs. Clermont, as  she observed their agitation ..: The year rolled away languidly, and seemed almost an age to Alice and Mary Clermont. They found pleasure only in    i watching the stages which brought or carried news to or from  one or the other of the absent lovers.             Alice perfected herself in the art of housekeeping; while  Mary said she never wished to know how to make pastry or  preserves, and then it would not be expected of her.  "Mary," said Alice one day when they were alone, "I hope j you are not engaged to lMr. Lee." "Why not?"Mary replied, " is he not rich, handsome, and  well educated?"  "He is," said Alice," and every way worthy of you ; but you v are not worthy of him, and if you marry him you will prove his  ruin, unless you alter your ways."              ^1i "Ruin!" exclaimed Mary, "how can that be, I desire to   i know, my prudent sister?"  "I will tell you, Mary," returned Alice, " he will never refuse X you anything, and you will insist upon being gratified in what- - ever you may desire. His riches, if he-were ever so wealthy, i? will-not satisfy every fancy which will be suggested to you in a  rich and populous city."  "Well, Alice," said Mary, '"I shall not expect better things  than others have in the company to which my husband will  present me."-a "Mary," continued Alice, "you will not only wish to excel them, but you will covet every article of luxury or taste  which may meet your view. Your husband will doubtless fur-  nish your mansion in splendor, surrounding you with many things of richness and art, thinking you will be satisfied. But he will be disappointed. He will find himself daily losing,   VICISSI'UDES OP FORTUNE.        41 instead of gaining wealth, and will consequently grow sad, re- served, and perhaps fretful. Sister, I would not tell you this if I did not desire to warn you of the evils which lie in your path. If you only conform to his noble and generous mind, you will never want for any of the necessaries of life, and will have something left for the poor and needy that will surround you in your daily excursions of pleasure." "What a lecture!  I declare, Alice, if I do not profit by it, it will not be your fault. There, listen, do you not hear a car- riage?  Arthur is coming, and do you know, Alice, William Lee is with him. Arthur wrote you he would bring a friend of Mary's to act as groomsman." Alice stood still for a moment, and then sprang down stairs, and in another moment was locked fast in Arthur's arms. "There," said Mary to herself, " before I would run down in my morning dress, unannounced as they were H intend to look very beautiful; I will wear this grey dress-it is so very becoming with its scarlet border, to a brunette ; and my hair must be braided in artistic style--I wonder 'what Mr. Grey thought, to see Alice come bounding right into his arms, with her curls all unconfined, her white morning gown fastened tight around her throat. To be sure she looked neat, but that was all. Now I   shall look captivating, and shall be very graceful and dignified. William shall not know how long I have looked for him, much less smother me up like a bundle of rags." Mary then fastened the golden clasps of her dress, and stepped lightly down stairs. Her father and mother met her in the hall, saying, "What, Mary, are you not before us?" and the three entered the drawing-room together William Lee sprang quickly to Mary's side, and pressed a quick and burning kiss upon her hand. Mary smiled compla- cently, and he led her to a seat in the deep recess of the win. dow. "Mary, may I  hope you are still faithful to me?" he inquired. "I live only for you," she fondly replied. \I  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7463-00000022"/> 42       CEOELIA GREY  OR, THE Ah I thought William Lee, does she not rather live for vani- ty and show; but she is young, and I can soon cure her of such folly. If she were only a little more like Alice-ortI  mean, a little more natural--I should like her better-no not like her better--for that would be impossible; but I know she  will not always he so haughty and thoughtless.  Arthur thought Alice more beautiful than ever, as he sur.  veyed her fine form, robed in simple white, while her hair,  which hungin natural curls, shaded cheek and brow. The ex- citement of their meeting, too, had given an additional tint to her rosy cheeks, and it was no wonder he thought her more lovely than her richly attired sister. Tea was soon brought in; after which Mr. and Mrs. Cler- mont left them to themselves. William and Mary strolled away to the grove, while Arthur and Alice contented them- selves in the little back parlor, which was Alice's favorite but to eDjoy ourselves as well as we can 1" "All but our wedding cake, an indispensable article, you know, " she replied; " but are not your prents coming to grace our wedding by their presence?" A shade of deep anxiety clouded Arthur's face for a moment, as he answered: "Alice, I must tell you what think will prove of little con- sequence to you, athough to me of great import. You are aware that my father was called a very wealthy man. His business in the western part of the State, when I was last here, was to look after a banking establishment, in which was in- vested the most of his income, and 'on which he relied, as a revenue from which to draw the money requisite to carry on his business. The bank has failed, and he has saved nothing of the immense wealth which he had possessed there. His landed property is involved to such an extent, that he fears he   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       43 shall losb that also. He proposes visiting England as soon as we are married, to look after his banking interest there, which is involved in a law suit, that they assure him can but turn out in 'his favor. If his property in England is left him, we shall have a competency sufficient for every want. Enough for a capital to commence in the mercantile business, for which I have been educated. But I would much rather be a farmer like your father; I am sure he is very happy. My parents cannot come, on account of settling their business before leaving the country. It is needless for me to tell you that it will take the surplus of their property here to defray our expenses during our stay in England?" "Arthur," replied Alice, " you do not expect to visit England?" "Yes, Alice!" was the reply; " I could not think of my parents crossing the ocean alone, and I thought it would be pleasant for you to visit a foreign country, as you have never done so." "If you desire me to go, I shall find pleasure in the voyage," replied Alice; " your wishes henceforth are my law." "Ah!" exclaimed Arthur, "be careful, Alice. You may make me a most tyrannical husband." "If I did not know you I should make no such pledges," Alice laughingly replied. "I have no fear that you will abuse the confidence I repose in you." "I do not know, Alice, but I do wrong in asking -you to share my uncertain fartune," said Arthur; "but if I judge you rightly, you will do so of your own free will." "You wrong me," she replied, " by even supposing I could do otherwise than wish to share your lot, whether it be high or low. We both have strength and health to labor, if necessary; and I shall willingly fill the place which circumstances may place me in. I am no more worthy than many others; besides, wealth brings more cares than happiness, in my opinion." "True," said Arthur, " it brings cares; but if rightly used it likewise brings happiness."  &#xD;<pb n="44" xml:id="VAC7463-00000023"/> "       CECELIA GREY ; OR, THE "Of that I am aware," said Alice ; " but if you are satisfied' with our lot, I certainly shall be. When I gave you my heart with a promise of my hand, it was not in anticipation of your wealth., To that, indeed, I gave not a passing thought." "I know you did not," replied Arthur. At this moment Iary and Mr. Lee returned from their stroll, and the remainder of the evening was passed by the happy group in music, reading, and social amusements. Amid rides, preparations for the approaching nuptials, visits from neighboring friends, and recreations, the week soon passed away, and the bright sun of a September morning pene- trated through the light curtains of Alice's sleeping apart- ment, revealing a most affecting scene: two young girls, each arrayed in white morning habits, with their arms fast locked around each other, murmuring parting blessings and remem- brances, amid a shower of tears. At last, Alice slowly released herself from her sister's encircling arms, and making an effort to dry, her tears, said : "Mary, you must not grieve so; you quite unnerve me. I shall not be able to go through with my morning duties, if you do not better assist me." "Go now, sister," replied Mary, " and I will arrange your bridal attire." Alice went first to her mother's room, to take leave of her. Sinking lowly at her mother's feet, she implored her blessing. Her mother clasped her closely to her breast, while the scalding tears fell like rain drops over her shining hair. Then with quick kisses on cheek and brow, she murmured her part- ing benediction. With her mother's blessing warm at her heart, Alice sought her father in the library. Mr. Clermont pressed his daughter to his heart, and forcing the tears back, said: "Go, my child, with a father's blessing on your union; if in your future life you need anything I have, return to me, and it shall be yours and your husband's."   &#xD;<pb n="Illustration-45" xml:id="VAC7463-00000024"/>  VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       45 Alice hastily kissed her father's brow, and hastened to her little bower, to take a farewell look of the flowers and vines she had loved so well. Gathering a handful of the prettiest, she placed them in her bosom as a memorial of her home. Mary now called her, and they retired to her dressing apart- ment, to arrange her toilet. She wore a dress of simple white, with no other ornament than a plain bAcelet, composed of her mother's and sister's hair, and clasped with a golden clasp, and Mary twined a single moss rosebud in her rich curls. Alice then desired Mary to leave her alone for a few moments in her room, for the last time, perhaps. When alone, Alice knelt humbly beside her bed, and implored her Saviour's bless- ing upon her union, and His watchful care over her and the dear friends she was about to leave. Then taking her Bible, which -she had daily read, and writing "From Alice to Mary " on the fly leaf, she placed it on the dressing-table, and sought her sister. They descended to the dining-room, where they breakfasted, after which Alice's trunks were placed on the carriage, when' Arthur and Alice, Mary and Mr. Lee, Mr. and Mrs. Clermont, stepped into separate carriages, and drove slowly on towards the old church, where Arthur first saw Alice Clermont. The church was crowded with the eager populace, most of whom knew Alice and loved her for her goodness. The sun streamed down through the stained glass of the windows, as the old pastor stood up, with his long, grey hair waving loosely over his shoulders, and in a deep and reverential voice joined Alice Clermont and Arthur Grey in the holy bonds of wedlock. Friends and acquaintances crowded around-them, eager to congratulate i the happy bride and groom. Mr. Clermont - placed his hands upon their heads, when raising his voice to Heaven, he implored the divine protection upon his children, who were about to leave him, perhaps for ever. Mary clung convulsively around her sister's neck, while Mrs. Clermont pressed her again and again to her heart.

ALICE sank back into the carriage, after gazing at her parents and sister till they were lost in the distance, and then gave free vent to her tears, which she had made every effort to restrain. "Weep on, my Alice," said Arthur, "you will then feel relieved. I knew it would be hard, this first parting with your family-but you will never want for friends as long as my parents live. I have no one to take you to but them ; no cousin-no relative, that I know of, alive. How often-how very often, have I wished for one, just one person whom I could claim as a relative.

"Then, Alice, you think we should anticipate the troubles that are to come, giving no thought to the pleasures; enjoy- ing each as it comes along?" "Yes," replied Alice,- "by foreseeing our troubles, one half of them might be avoided Il Where are we to stop, Arthur?" "At the Mansion," he replied, " where we will dine and then take a view of the village.

Alice smiled, and Arthur resumed- "You are not offended, I hope?" "Oh, no," said Alice ; "I would not have you tell me any- thing you had promised to retain a secret. I should doubt you if you did." "Spoken like yourself," laughed Arthur.  "You hold everything in abhorrence that is sinful. It would be no'less than a falsehood." They now alighted at the Mansion or hotel, and after re- freshments were served, strolled off to take a view of the scen- ery and architecture of the little village.

"Will yon tell us who has just been consigned to her last resting-place?" "How 1" exclaimed the old man ; "you must indeed be a stranger here, not to know the sad fate of the beautiful and wealthy orphan-Clara Morton? She was an only child ; her parents died ere she reached her tenth year, leaving her in the care of her uncle, Walter Morton.  A young man from the city won her affections, and her consent to become his wife. But wealthy and accomplished as she was, she had not sufficient for his proud and aristocratic relatives. Besides, he was ashamed of what he called her unpopular friends, and proposed a secret marriage. He -would provide her a home unknown to his friends. Clara Morton immediately left the room, after learning his baseness. No persuasions on his part could alter her purpose; she never saw him again, never would read one word he wrote her, returning all his letters unopened. From that time she began to fade. Like the rose, she drooped and died,' when least expected. She has gone, to return no more to us or to him." The old man stopped, and raising one withered hand, and pointing upwards, while the tears coursed over his furrowed cheeks, exclaimed: "There are no false hearts there; she has gone to her Saviour, whom she loved so well--to her mother, to her father, she has gone. Well may I weep, may well the poor weep, well may all weep ; for she wept and prayed with the afflicted, whether poor or rich; she fed and clothed the needy, plead with and gently rebuked the profane ; she was an angel of goodness while here--all too good to love the vile wretch that stole her heart and poisoned her existence. But God has kindly taken her to rest in his bosom." At this moment the gate, which had been closed, opened, and a young man, richly dressed, rushed wildly forward and threw himself upon his knees beside the grave, beating his breast, tearing his hair, and raving incoherently, begging to gaze once more upon her loved face-to kiss once more her icy lips.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7463-00000028"/> 52       CECELIAX GREY; OR, TTHE "Never I young man 1" exclaimed the sexton, " you have  l disturbed her life, you shall not disturb her last repose."

" She would not look on you in life, you Shall not look on her in death."           : The young man stood up, folded his arms,and tuning his face, pale as marble, towards heaven, exclaimed with shy lips, : but Farewell, Clara Hfrew I but not forever. I go hence; the tall grass will wave over your grave, the summer will come ! and go, loved friends will water your grave with tears; but  foreign lands shall receive me; the night winds will howl  around me till' I make my home in the silent tomb--a home  as deep as dark, as lonely as thine. Farewell!" And with these  words he was gone.  Arthur and Alice, awakening as from a trance from-the  scene which had enchanted them, lingered near the spot long  and sadly, until the moon looked down through the high wil- lows, slevering the rushing water of the distant river- and -  throwing long shadows from the marble slabs around them.  Alice shuddered, while Arthur led her gently away through  the large gates, and they hurried out into the open street. On they hastened, and paused not till they fould themselves safe in their apartments. WNeary and tremblling; Alice threw herself on a sofa, and soon fell into a sound and refreshing sleep. Arthur threw a shawl lightly over her, and went below to order refreshments  served in their own room; after which, he took a willow basket of wild flowers from its place in the bar, and hastening uP stairs  he mischievously strewed them over his sleeping bride, and then sat down to await tea, and watch her awaleninge. Be drew the rich curtains closely around him, so as to entirely exclude him from sight, intending to witness her surprise, on finding herself covered with flowers and alone.   VICISSITUDES' OF FORTUNE.       53 Alice awoke with a wild scream, and when Arthur folded her in his arms, she trembled like a frightened bird. "Why," exclaimed Arthur, " what is the matter, Alice? you must have been dreaming!" "Oh I then it was a dream," replied Alice, with a sigh of relief; "the grave-yard and that lovely girl-oh I I am so glad 1" "We have been to the grave-yard," resumed Arthur, " but there was nothing there to frighten you, although much to distress a noble or good heart." Tea was now brought in, which neither of them could relish. "Cold biscuit, almost cold tea, a slice of cake, and cold bacon--what a cold set they must be here," said -Arthur. "I will order some wine, and perhaps we may stand it till break- fast." The morning sun shone out bright and clear, and when the bell rang for breakfast, Arthur and Alice took their seats at-the table, ready equipped for their journey. An excellent break- fast and good appetite repaid them for their last night's fast; and an hour later they were safely on board the steamer, bound for New York. As they stood on deck, and gazed back upon the little village, nestled like a bird's-n est in the bosom of those steep hills, and saw the little cemetery, in which the last rites were performed for the beautiful and accomplished Clara Mor- ton, they turned heart-sick from the scene; and as they moved away, their eyes fell upon the pale sad face of the young man they had observed at the grave of her whom he had loved, and thoughtlessly hastened to the tomb. He was gazing towards the little church yard, his lips firmly compressed, while his clouded brow, wet with drops of sweat, told of the struggle going on in his heart.

But pride-false pride-has proved his destroyer. Never more will he drink, in this life, from the cup of happiness I He will wander here and there, in the vain effort to forget ;but it will be impossible.

And then, to change the current of her mind, he contihued: "See how gracefully the steamer moves along; it seems almost endowed with life, as it throws the snow white foam   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       55 from its prow. How steadily it bears on its way. To-night, Alice, you will see my childhood home, and your parents and my parents ; and they will have a daughter, so long and so dearly coveted." With these words, Arthur led her to the state-room, where they watched the diversified scenery, till the bell rung for din- ner. "Only one meal more on this boat, Arthur," whispered Alice, " and I shall see my new friends. Do you know, I am very-anxious to make their acquaintance? I am anticipating, I believe ;- but I will forget this new pleasure, for fear I shall not enjoy it when within my grasp." "You have- nothing to do," replied iArthur, "'but discuss these tempting viands to make you do so ; or observe the array of fashion and beauty here assembled ; a bridal tour, I should think, and the young friends of the bride and groom escorting them on their way.. But I am far happier without than 1 should be with an escort." "We do not need one," said Alice. In a short time Arthur and Alice returned to their state- room, which they did not again leave until the boat had reached the-wharf, where anxious friends awaited their arrival. Almost immediately Mr. and Mrs. Grey were on board the steamer, and in their children's arms. "You will not find many relatives to welcome you, my child," said Mr. Grey as Alice was presented, "but warm friends and loving hearts, are ready to receive you as their. own," and he folded her to his heart, and pressed a paternal kiss upon her brow. Alice wiped the glad tears from her eyes and was sure she should love those new parents as fondly and truthfully as her own. They now stepped from the boat and entered the car- riage. The- sun had long since sunk in the west, and it was getting quite dark. The street lamps were lighted, and they seemed to Alice to dance and sparkle in the distance, while the  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7463-00000030"/> 56        CECELIAA GREY; OR, THE busy throng were hurrying hither and thither, and ever and anon she heard the watchman's rattle, above the noise and din of rattling carriages, chattering voices, and the low murmur of the needy and afflicted as they called for charity from the richly dressed and cold-hearted throng. Alice was startled from her reverie by the carriage stopping before an elegant mansion, with marble front, which rose majestically above the lesser, but very beautiful houses around it. *    VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.        57 CHAPTER      VI. MR. GREY led Alice silently into the house. A brilliant light was burning in the hall, revealing the rich carpets and beautiful statuary placed tastefully around.- On entering the drawing-room, she observed that everything was as rich and elegantly arranged as the first sight of the mansion would convince one it must be. Tea was brought-in by -Mrs. Grey, and served in the little breakfast room adjoining Mrs. Grey's boudoir. "This is our home room," she exclaimed; "I could not bear to serve you, Alice, in the largediniung-hall. I wish to make it seem like home. - We have no servants now," she sadly re- sumed, "and in two days more we shall be upon the wide ocean." After tea, Mrs. Grey-showed Alice to her apartments, and they retired. Alice awoke early the ensuing morning, and hearing foot- steps below, hastened down to assist her new mother in pre- paring breakfast. To her surprise, she found William Lee in the hall. "What has brought you back so soon?" said Alice, fearing bad news from home. "I wished to see you and Arthur once more before you left us," replied Lee, " and I have come to breakfast with you. But what an early riser you are getting to be, sis 1" "Oh i" laughed Alice, "as to that, Mrs. Grey has no do.  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7463-00000031"/> 58       CECELIA G'REY; ORB, THE           a mestics, and I am going into the kitchen-that is, if I can find such a thing in this strange building, in time to assist in getting I -breakfast."  "Well, Alice," replied Lee, "I oan show you, for Arthur  and I have taken many a lunch there. By the way, where is Arthur I not up yet?"  "No," said Alice, " and I think not awake."  "That is nothing strange," replied Lee," Arthur always would sleep till the bell rang for breakfast. Many a time have I waked him in the morning, and I shall take the liberty to ' do so now."                         i Then bowing to Mrs. Grey, he resumed, "I have brought you a cook ; now Alice display some of your accomplishments j in the kitchen." Alice soon found that Mrs. Grey was not entirely in her ele- 7- ment here, and often had to consult her rules to prepare the i most common dishes, and appeared fatigued and disheartened with her task.     -1 "Now, mother," said Alice, if you will set the table, I will : prepare breakfast."                     I "You!" exclaimed Mrs. Grey ; " have you been accustomed to such work?" 4,       - "Not until I was engaged to Arthur," replied Alice ;"I then thought it my duty to perfect myself as a housekeeper. I am  not sorry that I am capable of serving up a good dinner when i necessary."                        ! "Ah 1" resumed Mrs. Grey, "I can say that I am very glad I I can oversee work, and know what should be done, but I do not understand cooking; I had almost given up,  X when you came in so opportunely to my assistance, and I feel very grateful for your unexpected aid"           i Breakfast was ,soon ready, and served in the little room of the evening previous. Alice had not before observed the rich mahogany and rosewood furniture, which everywhere met the eye. Even the kitchen was luxuriously furnished, and the   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       59 drawing-rooms superbly. The heavy damask curtains were held back by statuary, sculptured from thel solid marble, with golden chains in their hands; while rich ottomans or divans filled up the spaces between.- -The rich, soft carpets gave back no sound to the foot-step. As Alice wandered through the spacious chambers of the mansion,' she felt an undefined senti- ment of grief and sorrow steal over her, and sinking upon a sofa, she buried her face in her hands, and wept bitterly. "Why do I weep 1" she exclaimed--" to-morrow we leave this house ; what reason have I to mourn the departure ; it is not probable that I shall ever return here-; indeed I is it possible? Arthur will never be rich enough to"re-purchase it, and if -he could he would not. Yet, from the first it has seemed con- nected with some trouble to cometo me, or those dear to me; but I will not be so foolish as to indulge in any unnecessary alarm."          ' Stepping into a vestibule, where a marble basin was con- stantly filled with running water, she bathed her eyes and brow till all traces of tears had nearly disappeared. Here was a conservatory of rare or exotic plants, in which a variety of birds chirped and played the live-long day. Looking through the flowers and thick foliage, -she saw Mrs. Grey, and to her mortification, intently observing her. "To what cause will she impute thes'e marks of sorrow," thought Alice, as she bent her head to hide the burning blush, which she felt mantle to her brow with painful distinctness. -"What is the trouble, child?"Mrs. Grey inquired. "You seem unhappy; come in here, there is a little door to the left; I would talk with you. Arthur has not been making himself disagreeable, I hope." "Oh, no P" exclaimed Alice, "I have not seen him since breakfast. Mr. Lee wished him to go with him to arrange some little affair between themselves; I hardly know what. Indeed I I know nothing at all about the business he has gone upon."  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7463-00000032"/> 60       CECTTA GREY; O, ,THE           ! "Not jealous, Alice?" said Mrs. Grey, slightly smiling. "I i will assure you, you need never fear for Arthur; you are his j idol" 1  Again the color came and went in the cheek of Alice. "You wrong me-indeed, you do," replied Alice; "I was not thinking of Arthur, in particular."            "Well, then," said Mrs. Grey, sorrowfully,' "I conclude you j must regret the leaving your home and friends, or native land. a I cannot reproach you, but you should have thought of it before it was too late to repent, or retrace your steps." "Mother!" said Alice, "you wrong me, sadly wrong me.   j: I did consider if it would be for my future happiness to go with Arthur, giving up all for your sakes, and I found it would. I know God can protect me as well on the stormy ocean as in my father's dwelling; of that I gave no heed, but wept uncon-  X sciously, I know not why, as I stood in that -room, viewing the tastefully arranged furniture'and life-like statuary ; it seeme d as if some painful scene would there meet my view; it was  ? only the impulse of the moment that controlled me, and led me into so foolish an error, as to give thought' to an imaginary X evil."  Mrs. Grey turned pale, sighing deeply, and for a few moments  remained silent, apparently lost in thought; then the tears started to her eyes, trembled on the long lashes, and dropped A upon a book with. which she had been engaged. "Alice," she remarked, " when Mr. Grey brought me here, I  was impressed with the same idea; so deeply did it overcome me j that I fainted and remained some time unconscious. When I re- covered, I tried every means to shake off the impression, but could not. In a short time,my little brother, then scarcely four years of age, came. to see me, and fell from the window and was instantly killedL They brought him into that room, and laid him upon the sofa. After that, my father died, and my mother was then all that I had left of kindred. "She came here to live with me, and as that room was near my own, she   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       61 preferred it for hers, and there she sickened-there she died. After that, I spent many hours there alone, thinking of my poor mother or brother. I was sitting there when my husband brought me word that I must leave my home for a strange land--that the most of our property was lost. Then I felt that the presentiment was fulfilled, and I should at length find peace and happiness. -I have never told any one of this before, and I should not now, if you had not experienced a similar sensation." After a moment's silence, Alice changed the subject by re- marking: "If you will tell me what to get, mother, I will prepare din- ner." "I will assist a little, you are such an amateur," replied Mrs. Grey. "I shall not interfere with your culinary arrangements; but will prepare the dining-room. We may possibly have sev- eral to dine with. us. You must not neglect your toilet. Leave your work in time for that. Many of Arthur's associ- ates are anxious to see his bride." Arthur returned, bringing several gentlemen to dine with him. They were all much pleased with Arthur's selection, as they laughingly called Alice, observing that they expected to be present at the presentment. Arthur colored slightly, while Mr. Lee observed that le had begged the privilege of giving the bridal party at his father's house on the following 'eve, as the young couple were to start the succeeding morning, on their wedding tour, together with their parents, who were going for pleasure and on business., Arthur looked his gratitude to William Lee, who ihad only told the truth, without gratifying all their impertinent curiosity, and silenced any further inquiries in relation to them. The next day was disagreeable and cold. Mrs. Grey gave Alice the keys to all the apartments in the mansion, telling her the lower or underground rooms had not in years been entered  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7463-00000033"/> 62       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE As they had not been needed for use, they were emptied of the i furniture and locked up. Alice gladly started on her exploring expedition. At first going to the attic, and then descending into the little cham- bers formerly occupied by the servants. Here she could not   i fail to notice the neat arrangements, with wash-bowls, stands, :i baths, and other luxuries, besides a good substantial leather- i bound Bible and hymn book, which each servant had been re- quired to read night and morning. She then passed into the- various sleeping apartments below, which were fitted up in ori- ental magnificence. Passing into the library, she stood a long A time beside a vase of flowers, lost in a sad reverie of the past, ! not observing the approach of her husband, until Arthur play-  fully snatched a sprig of jasmin from her hand, saying.:    "Why, Alice!-why do you pull all of those flowers to   A pieces? I cut them for a bouquet expressly-for you to use this evening."                            "I don't know," she replied, "I was not thinking."    ; "Well now," resumed Arthur, "I should think you were  thinking, very deeply "  "I have been through the house so far," said Alice, "and  I am now going into those underground apartments, your mother tells me have remained so long unoccupied. I am rather timid  about going alone; will you accompany me?"         ii "Certainly," replied Arthur, " but we must have the keys first.'" "Here they are," said Alice, "your mother provided every necessary, including a lamp." As they descended the stairs, the gloom and darkness almost drove Alice back, while Arthur laughed, and told her not to be frightened, there were only the coal heap and provisions there ; , besides, he did not think it a good practice to anticipate dan- ger. "You must practise as well as preach, Alice. Let us walk softly or we may chance to frighten those monsters mother tells about, that carry off whole cheeses occasionally."    VICISSIrUDES OF FORTUNE.        63- "Why, Arthur I be still. What was that?' I am sure I heard something." "I don't doubt it, my little heroine," said Arthur ; "it was one of those monsters." "Arthur," said Alice, half reassured, "I am going to preach and you must practice, or I shall run away up stairs. You must not make so much noise ; I am sure I heard some one speak in the east corner of the cellar ; or in one of the rooms opening out of it, and I don't choose to go any further." "Nonsense i" replied Arthur, "I have not seen the inside of those rooms since I was a boy, and I am going to explore them now.  If you are not too much frightened, I should like to have you hold the light for me. Some of the rooms, I remember, were very pleasant." Alice began to reproach herself for her curiosity. She was certain she heard voices, and she knew Arthur would not have thought of visiting those underground apartments, if she had not called his attention to them. They passed through   the rooms on the west side, Alice almost forgetting her fears in gazing from their low windows into the street, and viewing their skillful arrangements. Every room seemed fitted to accommodate a  small family. "Arthur," she said, "I think your father was wicked to keep all these comfortable apartments unoccupied; how many poor people would have been happy,with such a  home." "Fie i  Alice," Arthur replied; "they were only made for servants. We   had plenty of room above, and so we shut these up." They passed to the east side, and when Arthur tried to open the first door, it refused to yield to his strength, although the key turned easily in the lock. "What can this mean?" he exclaimed,   while Alice leaned against the wall trembling and trying to speak, but through fear unable to do so.

While a beautiful child was laughing and playing with a string of glass beads. In a moment he turned to the woman, inquiring:     } "How came you here?"  She replied that her name was Margaret Conner, and she  was a sister to the cook who had lived in his father's family. She also informed him that her husband was a shoemaker, and kept a shop under the next building, and her sister had told  him to make a door through his shop into the room, and oc- cupy it, for it was never used and never would be, and it  would be an assistance to them in saving rent. Arthur laughed, and turning to Alice, who had recovered  from her fright, exclaimed:  "Ah I this is where mother's big cheeses went!" Telling the woman that the mansion had changed owners,  they left them, and after fastening the door firmly on the inside, they returned to the upper rooms, eager to relate the  incidents of the cellar.  Mrs. Grey smiled when she heard of her unknown tenant.  "I fear," she said, "that we have been much to blame in closing those rooms, and letting them remain useless; they might have sheltered many destitute families, more worthy per- haps than ourselves. But the present owner, I think, will not be afraid to do a good act, even against personal security." Alice felt a strong, desire to know who was the present owner; but recollecting Arthur's promise of secrecy, she re-  frained from-asking the question. Arthur informed Alice and his mother, that William Lee was expecting them to pass the afternoon of the succeeding day with his father's family; that his sister and mother would make them a call during the morning, to be presented to Alice, and most likely many others would take the opportunity to do so.  -      ,  '          X   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       65 "I have many invitations for you and myself, Alice," he con- tinued, " but we can only accept those of the Lees." The family then set down to tea, after which all retired to their apartments, as Alice and Mrs. Grey had to be up early, to make preparations for the day. Alice arose as soon as she could discern one thing from another, and when Mr. and Mrs. Grey come down, the break- fast was steaming upon the table. "What witchery is this?" exclaimed Mr. Grey in amazement, as he entered the breakfast-room. "Ah, Alice i' remarked Mrs. Grey, "you must not make a servant of yourself because we are too poor to afford one." "I shall never think it a hardship to serve those I love," Alice replied. ' But you must not give me too much credit, for I was not altogether disinterested in preparing breakfast so early. I was afraid we should have company before-our work was out of the way, or ourselves prepared to receive them. I will do the work, mother, and you keep yourself in readiness to entertain your guests." When breakfast was over, Alice went to the kitchen, and Mrs. Grey to the drawing-room, while Arthur took a book and sat in the hall. Throwing the door open, and seating himself beside it, he was ready to welcome his friends. As Alice had expected, she had scarcely commenced her preparations for dinner, before the drawing-rooms were crowded with company. Alice hastened her work, andlthen hurried up stairs to arrange her toilet. She chose a maroon-colored silk, trimmed with rich lace, and letting her hair hang in graceful ringlets around her neck, with rosebuds twisted in her cluster- ing curls, she sat down to await her husband's arrival, for Arthur was to present her to his friends.) He purposely pro- longed the time of doing so, to give Alice a moment's rest; which she scarcely needed, for she labored with so light a heart, that it was only a healthy exercise for her. With an additional tinge on her rosy cheeks, she inquired of  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7463-00000035"/> "       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE Arthur as he came into her apartment, how he liked her cos- tume.  "It is very appropriate," he replied, "but I think your white muslin more becoming."  "Iam sorry it does not suit you," said Alice. "Suit me!" exclaimed Arthur; "I told you it did suit the occasion, and of course it suits me. It is no reason that others  would think you more lovely in white, because I do. Consult your own taste in such affairs ; you will always be right." As Arthur led Alice down stairs, there was a general mur- mur of admiration ; for all admired the sweet expression of her face, and the timid confidence in her young husband, too truthfully betrayed in her appearanee.  Mrs. Lee received her as an old friend, which she told her ! she must consider herself, for Arthurs sake ; then turning to Arthur, she congratulated him upon his choice. Arthur thanked her with a smile, hoping she would spare  Alice, for fear of making her vain.  "You need give yourself no alarm," said Mrs. Grey. "Alice  is proof against any such vice."  "Alice 1 I forewarn you-don't you let mother spoil you," said Arthur.  "If she will only make me as good as herself, I shall be satisfied," replied Alice. "That you are now," returned Mrs. Grey. "I shall have to take lessons from you, I fear." "There!" exclaimed Arthur, "did I not tell you so? My good mother will monopolize Alice for herself, and fill her head with all manner of eulogy, until she will imagine herself one of the super-celestials I I beg your pardon," he added, "that is getting too high."  Alice was really vexed at this apparent railery, which Mr. Grey observed. He immediately proposed to Alice a walk in the garden, and offering his arm, with a look of reproach at Arthur, he led the way into the yard.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       67 "Well done, father," exclaimed Arthur, as they disappeared; "if we have unconsciously been wanting in politeness we are served right." "Yes, they have served us right," said Mrs. Lee. "We had no right to welcome her as a schoolmate, and talk all manner of nonsense to her, as we did. I saw it pained her, and endea- vored to turn the conversation. We will, however, await her return, and apologize." Alice soon returned, and after Mr. Grey had seated her, Mrs. Lee urged her invitation for the afternoon and evening, and the company took leave. Alice now hastened dinner, but not with the anxiety she had felt in the morning, to see her work disposed of. "It is ever so," thought she ; " when we anticipate pleasure it flees before us like the morning dew; how little have I enjoyed myself to- day, and was it my fault? I think not. Are those the edu- cated, the highly gifted, of whom I have so often heard? Im- possible I their conversation was not only dull, but insipid; and Arthur never appeared so disagreeable,-no, not disagreeable, -I scarcely know what to call it. I will think no more about it. I must dine with the Lees. Well, for William's sake-for mother's and Arthur's sake-I will endure it; but I expect to be miserable. Yet Mrs. Lee looked intelligent, and Amanda pleasing. I may be quite contented with them. I will try to be agreeable, at any rate i" Arthur now came into the kitchen, inquiring if she did not need assistance; he was afraid they would be too late, for William was to send a carriage for them at two o'clock. Alice now went to work in earnest, and in a short time was ready to prepare her toilet: Arthur desired her to choose her evening dress, for they would not return until after the party. Alice was much perplexed to arrange her hair, which had called forth many remarks during the morning. She tried for a long time to make it lay smooth, and after much labor suc- ceeded in brushing it into glossy waves, which rather enhanced  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7463-00000036"/> 68        CECELIA GREY ; OR, THE: than diminished her attractions. After some delay, she chose a white satin robe, which she confined at the waist with a pale  blue sash, and placed a bracelet, ornamented with turquoise and . diamonds, on her arm, and a white rose in her hair. Then  throwing a shawl lightly around her, she descended the stairs.' Mr. Lee stood in the hall, ready to hand her to the carriage, where Arthur and Mr. and Mrs. Grey had preceded her. As Alice took her seat, Mr. Grey sprang to the ground, saying as ' he shut the door of the carriage : "Now good bye, I shall not be with you until tea-time." "Come with us,' said William Lee, " my mother is expect- Ai ing you, for old acquaintance sake. Do not disappoint us on the eve of your departure!" "No, no, my boy 1" replied Mr. Grey, "your father, I    "i know, will have to remain in his counting-house. It is busy times, now, and I shall stay with him. I would not have him  discommode himself on my account, when it is as easy for me to assist him, and he can remain with us during the evening."  The carriage was driven to the mansion of the Lees, while Mr. Grey pursued his way to the firm of Lee &amp; Sons, where the senior partner might ever be found doing the business which  two men would think it hard to perform.  When Mr. Grey entered the room, Mr. Lee was looking over the bills of sale, and preparing the register of the cargo to be shipped in the morning.  "Ah, my old friend ; I need not tell you I am glad to see you," remarked Mr. Lee, rising and presenting his hand. "I was hurrying all day to get thr'ough with these little affairs, so I could go home and visit with you, but was almost discour- aged." '   . "Is there anything I can do for you?" asked Mr. Grey. "If so, let us to work, we will have it all straightened by tea. time, when we will visit at our leisure." "Thank you," said Mr. Lee, handing him the bills of sale, , "take a seat here if you will assist me, as I used to say when ! /   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       ,69 we occupied one seat at school ; if you will only help me through this little sum, I will be obliged, for I never expected to have an opportunity to do more. I hope some day to have it in my power to repay these little services." "They'are all liquidated," replied Mr. Grey, "those little affairs, if you will say nothing about them; they gave me as much pleasure as you, so do not spoil it by comment." 'We will leave those old friends, and return to Alice, Mrs. Grey and Arthur. The carriage bore them safely past the jolting carts, rumbling omnibuses and bustling crowds until they left the more noisy part of the city, when they stopped before an elegant mansion, near the suburb's of the city. Mrs. Lee received them in the hall, whispering to Alice. "We will try to make amends for our uncourteous treat- ment this morning, so make yourself at home, and enjoy your- self, my child." Alice unconciously felt that she had wronged Mrs. Lee, in estimating her friendship as almost worthless, even in thought, and she hastened to atone for her error. Amanda welcomed her gracefully, and presented her with a list of their expected guests for the evening, after which they visited the library, and discussed their favorite authors, consult- ing on different subjects until tea. At the table, Mr. Lee with Mr. Grey joined them. After tea, Alice and Amanda retired to their rooms, to pre- pare for the arrival of the guests. "Do you know," inquired Amanda, "I have a fancy to arrange my costume like your own? I think it very becom- iug." Alice smilingly expressed her pleasure, and Amanda sum- moned her maid to dress her. "I have no such bracelets," she remarked; "you may take that one of topaz from -my dressing-case, and wind this blue taste through the chains; it will have the same effect as tur- quoise."  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7463-00000037"/> 70        CECELIA GREY; OR, THE The guests arrived at an early hour, and Mrs. Lee presented Alice as she received them. When William Lee claimed her hand, and led her off in a schottish, in which Alice particularly excelled, and as they followed her in the graceful undulations, a murmur of admiration went round the company, while many were loud and enthusiastic in the praise of Arthur's bride. That she was the belle of the evening, could not be disputed;  but that she enjoyed this popularity, I can truly say she did X not. Often did the wish herself at home, for such assemblages were ever tiresome to her. "So it is in life," she soliloquized, ' things from which we expect to derive pain, often give us pleasure, and those from which we hope to derive pleasure, give us pain. Now   I dreaded this afternoon's visit; yet I don't know when I have been more gratified than to-day. This evening I expected to  X be far happier, and am most wretched-miserable. To whose   L fault can I impute it? To no one's, but must consider it my own fault, and impute it to my inability to enjoy such scenes. I love home gatherings best; a few choice friends collected to i relate anecdotes, read, argue or bring forth the rich stores of thought, which lay buried beneath the rubbish of this world's conventionalities, or what may be considered proper by the mass, for them to say, do or act, and which has lain so long dormant as to almost surprise them, at the existence of such ideas, so foreign to their daily intercourse with their families or friends. To witness the sparkling eye-the beaming intellec- tual countenance, as they defend their favorite topic. This to me would be pleasure."  'You are thoughtful, Mrs. Grey," said a gentleman advanc- ing to the side of Alice, and addressing her. "Let me intro- duce you to my sister. She is quite anxious to make your acquaintance." Alice smilingly acquiesced, and he led her into a little  , recess, where she observed a lady evidently admiring a vase of flowers.  ,-                  j:   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       T1 "This is my sister," said the gentleman, bowing; " she will be pleased to see you." When the lady turned towards Alice, she was both surprised and pleased to discover one of her old schoolmates, from whom she had not heard for years. "So you did not know me, my precious?" the lady exclaimed. "I know you, Julia," replied Alice, "yet you have altered much." "Ah!" resumed the lady, " and I can say as much for you. You have altered much, and for the better. I never saw you looking so well as you do this evening." "You are married, I suppose?" inquired Alice. "Yes," the lady replied, " six months after leaving school, I became the wife of Martin Compton. You see before you Julia Compton, in the place of Julia Smith; the gentleman I sent for you is my brother-in-law. My health has been rather poor for the past year; the loss of many near and dear friends is a sufficient excuse for my altered looks. I do not enjoy society much, but my husband is anxious to have me go out; he thinks it will relieve the depressions of my mind. But it will be imposible-time alone, if anything, will ever make me forget my children." "Then you have lost children?" inquired Alice. "Two," replied the lady; "such lovely children ; the girl a baby, and I loved them so much. You must come and see me; I live in West street-you will come? I want to show you their pictures-excuse a mother's pride-I am sure you will think them beautiful. Then I want to talk so much about old times. Say, Alice, are you fond of parties like this?" "Not very," replied Alice ; " but if sister Mary were here, she would be, she is so fond of large assemblages; they are never tiresome to her. You remember Mary?" "Oh, yes!" exclaimed Mrs. Compton, " she is a young lady now, I presume ; why did she not attend you to the city?"

I should be very glad to visit you, or receive a visit from you, but it will be impossible at present." "Disappointed again 1" exclaimed Mrs. Compton. "I had promised myself so much pleasure from your society I If it  had not been for the idea of seeing you, I should not have  been prevailed upon to come out this evening. But I am glad to see you, eveni for so short a time, and shall expect you to visit me on your return from Europe. Do you intend to remain in the city after your return?" "It is very improbable," replied Alice, " although I have not heard the subject discussed. We shall at least return to this city.; and if possible I will call on you then. It is a long  while to look forward to, yet I will hope to meet this appoint- ment, Julia."  Arthur now came in search of Alice, and greeting Mrs. Compton politely, told her he had expected her to make the ' first call upon Alice. But feeling somewhat disappointed, had : not mentioned her residence in the city to Alice. "I had expected some little token of remembrance from Alice," replied Mrs. Compton, ' an invitation or something of that kind; but I found I must make the first advances. If' I had been a visitor of your mother's I should have been the first to welcome your wife ; but a stranger to your parents, I dared not intrude." "My mother," said Arthur, in excuse, "so seldom goes out, that it would only be a wonder if you were acquainted." "I intend," continued Mrs. Compton, "to embrace the first. opportunity to form her acquaintance."  "This will be the proper time, then," replied Arthur; "come, let me present you." Mrs. Grey j expressed her pleasure in forming the acquaint- ance of Alice's old friend. *   *   *  *  *   * '*   *   *     VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       73 "Mrs. Grey sighed as she arose to take leave of their hostess, and Alice could scarcely restrain her tears. Mrs. Lee! followed them to the carriage, and gazed long and sadly into the face of Mrs. Grey, while she held her hand firmly locked within her own. At last she relaxed her hold. "Good bye I my more than sister. May God protect you," she exclaimed, and turned quickly away. Mrs. Grey sunk back into the carriage and spoke not until it paused at her own house. As Arthur opened the door, she sprang forward, and placing her hand upon his arm, ex- claimed: "Where is your father, child 7" "Here, ready to help you down," said Mr. Grey, from the side of the carriage. "Mr. Lee and myself chose to be together during this last evening of my stay in America; and to escape from the noise, we came here soon after the guests had arrived. We knew you would be home early, and Mr. Lee could take leave of his friends in time, so they would scarcely know he had been out at all." Wm. Lee said he should defer taking leave of them until another day, as he intended to accompany them  to the steamer. Mr. Lee shook each warmly by the hand, with a hearty good bye, until he took the hand of Mr. Grey, which he held trembling for a moment, then waved his hand and was gone without a word. Mr. Grey led Alice and Mrs. - Grey into the house silently, and Arthur, after a few words with Wm. Lee, followed them. Mr. Grey took his large Bible from its resting place, and read a portion of Scripture to his family; then kneeling devot- edly he prayed to Heaven, for fortitude to bear with patience and resignation whatever afflictions it might be their lot to meet with in life. Without murmuring or resentment, to be thankful for such blessings as they did enjoy--" and they are many, very many,' he cried. "Oh I may we be more worthy ;" 4  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7463-00000039"/> 74       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE he implored; "thou dost not willingly afflict us. We are  about to leave our native land, perhaps forever ; oh I grant us  protection when on the stoiiiy sea; be with us through life;  and in death do not forsake us!"  Alice felt that his prayer had a response in her own heart. She, too, wished the divine protection, and as her thoughts  reverted to her parents and sister, she sobbed and wept bit-  terly. As she arose, she strove to repress her tears, and bade the family goodnight.. On entering her room, she went hastily to work to finish packing her wardrobe, after which she told Arthur she must write to her sister before retiring for the night. She then sat down and addressed a long letter to Mary and her parents. She carefully concealed her dread of leaving her native land, speaking of it only as a pastime, from which, if she could, she would not escape, and which might prove a source of much pleasure to her-fearing it would pain them to know her extreme reluctance at crossing the ocean. She endeavored to convey the impression that it was not entirely disagreeable to her, without doing violence to her own love of truth. Yet her heart ached at the bare possibility of not returning to the home of her childhood, of not hearing the  loved voices of parents or sister again. As she placed the seal upon the letters, her tears fell fast, and she pressed them to her  lips, ere she laid them upon the dressing-table, that Arthur ? might not forget to place them in the office, in the morn- ing. Arranging her travelling-dress, and setting the alarm to her  watch that she might not oversleep herself, she retired to take an hour's repose before preparing for breakfast. It seemed hardly possible to Alice that she had closed her eyes, when her watch gave her warning it was time to arise. Weary and sick at heart, she descended to the kitchen to build a fire, when to  her surprise she found the fire brightly burning, and Mr. Grey dozing in a large easy-chair by the fireside.  Alice hastened her breakfast, and soon had it in readiness.    VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       75 Mr. Grey went to call Mrs. Grey and Arthur, while Alice placed the dishes and prepared to serve them, Breakfast was ate in silence, broken only by an occasional sob, which Mrs. Grey tried in vain to suppress. Arthur, in fact, was the only cheerful person in the group. He had long wished to visit Europe, and would have done so before had he not known that his mother would never consent to his perform- ing the journey alone. "Mr. Edwards will be here in an hourkto take possession, and William Lee will come with his father's carriage to convey us to the steamer," said Mr. Grey, as he directed Mrs. Grey and Alice to be in readiness. The carriage soon made its appearance, and William Lee sprung hastily out, clasping Arthur firmly in his arms, and then took Mr. Grey by the hand. Turning to Arthur, he exclaimed: "It is hard parting thus; if we only knew when you would return, it would seem more like a voyage of pleasure. But you must not forget your old classmate I Here is something for you to look upon when far away," he continued, handing him a miniature of himself. "I have yours here-I have kept it since you gave it me." Lee then assisted Alice into the carriage, where Mr. and Mrs. 'Grey and Arthur immediately followed them, leaving the key of their house-their house no more-in possession of Mr. Edwards, who had come to claim it. They gave one look back as they rode rapidly away, and with a sigh fixed their eyes resolutely forward, endeavoring to smother every regret-hop- ing for another home as dear, if not as elegant in outward appearance. Upon reaching the pier, they found the steamer in readiness to "cast off," and William Lee was obliged to take a hasty leave of his friends. After whispering his adieus to Alice, and shaking the others by the hand, they separated.

VICIBSSA'UDES OF FORTUNE.       " CHAPTER       VII. THE Greys on board the steamer, they immediately took possession of their state rooms. "Now, Alice," observed Arthur, "I just begin to feel at home.   We shall have a few days of uninterrupted happiness, I expect. Father has provided any quantity of reading mat- ters, wherewith to amuse mother, and as long as he will read, she will be contented, and not overpleased to have any one inaterrupt them. I have a few books wherewith to amuse you when you get sick, which I suppose you will soon." "Then you   have no idea of getting sick," replied Alice, laughing. "As for that part of our voyage," resumed Arthur, "I have no particular fancy, although I must confess my head does feel unusually strange. Don't you think the motion of the vessel very disagreeable?" "Not particularly so," replied Alice. "Here, Arthur, lay  down on this sofa, and I will ring the bell and order some tea ; perhaps you will then feel better." Notwithstanding Alice's efforts, Arthur grew very ill. Mr. Grey soon came in, saying that Mrs. Grey wished for her if she was not engaged, as she was as unwell as Arthur. Between them both, Mr. Grey and Alice had to be constantly upon the alert, and by the time they had became able to take care of themselves, Mr. Grey was taken ill, and Alice was confined to her state room, scarcely able to rise from her bed. Alice  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7463-00000041"/> 78       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE recovered in a few days, but not so with Mr. Grey. Although he was able to go upon deck, and walk about, a teasing cough set in which prevented his gaining health or strength.  When they arrived at the end of their journey, each was rejoiced to step on shore again. They procured cheap lodg-  ings, at a private boarding-house in a small village on the south i of London, where Arthur procured a situation as clerk in a mercantile house, Mr. Grey found he could not realize anything from the bank at that time, and it was doubtful if ever. Thus thrown out of employment by sickness, his son scarcely able to furnish a home and provisions, with no prospect of returning to their native land, it is no wonder he grew disheartened, longing almost for death to terminate his sorrows. Mrs. Grey wept incessantly ; first over his hopeless condition -then of their sojourn in a foreign land. "Oh  why did we come here?" she exclaimed; "I knew we could not be otherwise than miserable ; without friends or acquaintances, and without money. How could I think he  would recover anything from a broken bank, involved in law?  Is it possible we are destitute?"  Alice tried to soothe them into resignation, telling them not to despair. There would be some way prepared for their  return; Arthur could earn enough to subsist upon, and she would try to procure fine sewing. In this way she thought she' could earn enough to purchase clothing for them, and medicine  for Mr. Grey. Then if he recovered, he could in time earn  sufficient to defray their expenses home. With this vain hope, they struggled on. Week after week -month after month, they toiled. Mrs. Grey incessantly des-  ponding; Mr; Grey growing neither better nor worse; Arthur constantly employed in a counting-house, while poor Alice went from house to house procuring needle-work, trying to earn  something to assist in purchasing medicine for her husband's father. She never complained, and when Arthur murmured,    VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       19 she encouraged him to hope for better days, telling him it was wrong for him to despond when he had sufficient for-every actual necessity-health and steady employment. She wrote home often, but strange to say, received no replies, and when she felt her heart sink, she would raise her voice in secret prayer. They had been in England just one year, when Alice sat in the little parlor of their boarding-house busy with her needle- work and her own sad thoughts. While thus employed, she heard the bell ring, followed by a quick step in the hall; the door opened immediately after and an elderly gentleman was ushered in. Bowing slightly, he inquired. "Is this Mrs. Arthur Grey, from America?" "It is P" replied Alice, trembling as she placed a seat for the stranger. "Well," resumed the gentleman, "I have had some trouble to find you; but I promised to do so, if you were within twenty miles of London! Here is a letter from a gentleman by the name of Lee; it was written in haste, and he told me you must excuse its shortness. He requested me also to bring a letter from you on my return. If will call for it four weeks from to- day." Then bowing, he hastily left the room, before Alice had time to recover from her surprise or make any inquiries. Quickly opening the letter, she found that Wm. Lee had only written that they had never heard from her; that they were all well at home, and were very anxious to hear from them. "Why did he not write if he were married, or something about Mary," soliloquized Alice, as she read the brief note again and again. When Arthur returned, she handed the letter to him, and he resolved to write to Mr. Lee, and inform him of their situation. A fortnight rolled slowly away, and Arthur, was taken violently ill, from overtasking himself in the store, during the absence of the proprietor ; for Arthur had undertaken to do his part of the business in addition to his former tasks, hoping by that  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7463-00000042"/> 80       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE means to procure some rest for Alice, who was almost worn out with incessant toil. Then, and not till then, did Alice's courage fail. She threw herself in an agony of grief upon her bed, and wept and prayed by turns until entirely exhausted, when she fell into a slight slumber. Her hostess, who had been watching her, was not at a loss : to understand her grief, and immediately set her wits at work to discover some way to relieve her. Too well she knew her husband to think for an instant that a ray of pity would find a place in his heart. At last an idea forced itself upon her. Alice was an excellent singer; her daughters were to have a piano forte sent home on the morrow, and to get a teacher  from London was an expense which they had dreaded; if Alice could teach them, all would be well. She went to her husband, then to her daughters, and imparted her plan. Each was highly pleased with it. The young ladies had long coveted a knowledge of the beautiful ballads which Alice had warbled in their hearing. When Alice awoke, Mrs. Harold tapped lightly at the door of the room. Trembling, Alice hastened to  open it, fearing that she would refuse to shelter them longer, now that Arthur was unable to work. "Do not stand, Mrs. Grey," said Mrs. Harold, "you do not  look able to do so."  Alice sunk back into the nearest chair. "I have come to make a proposal to you," resumed Mrs.  Harold; "I hope you will not think it impertinent, for I know you have done fine sewing. Do you play on the piano?" "I do," replied Alice, while a ray of hope beamed through the darkness, which had before almost driven her to despair. "My daughters will have a piano sent home to-morrow," resumed Mrs. Harold. "If you will teach them, we will give you and your friends board in exchange. But I shall 6xpect more than common music lessons from you. I shall want you to spend at least half of the time in teaching." "Very well," replied Alice, "I will try to please you, and   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       81 teach as many hours as you wish, providing your daughters will consent to be taught for so long a time." After Mrs. Harold left her, Alice hastened to Arthur tQ relate the welcome news. The next day she commenced her labors. She found it a most difficult task, for each of Mrs. Harold's daughters, Julia and Jane, wished to take the lead, and select music after their own fancy, regardless of each other or Alice's wishes. Thus they were constantly disagreeing instead of learning, and for a fortnight Alice toiled with the obstinate and self- willed girls, while at the same time she was preparing letters to her parents and friends at home. To her father, she dis- closed her painful and embarrassing situation. To Mary and William Lee, she wrote of the scenery and the appearance of the inhabitants. Of London she gave a most minute account, for she had often passed through its streets in search of work, or spent hours in the. parlors of the aristocracy, drawing designs for needle-work, or showing her proficiency to do the work they were unwilling to trust to unexperienced hands. Alice was per- haps more able to give information respecting London and its aristocracy than she would have been if placed in circumstances above want. The ensuing morning, as Arthur sat bolstered up in a large easy chair, he uttered an exclamation of surprise, and before he had time to explain, the gentleman who had brought Wil- liam Lee's letter, entered the room. "Mr. Morgan 1" exclaimed Arthur, as he extended his hand, "it is really a pleasure to see you in a foreign land, even if we are reduced to the extremes of poverty 1" Mr. Morgan expressed his sympathy for them, and'said if he was able he would pay their expenses home, but he did not doubt Mr. Lee would immediately send for them upon his return. After receiving the letters which Alice had written, he pro- mised to see them delivered into the hands of Mr. Lee, or con- vey them to Mr. Clermont himself. 4*  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7463-00000043"/> 82       CECELIA GREY; OB, TTHE *   *'  *   *  *ic *  *c  *fe  *      - Three months after Morgan had left them, while Alice still continued to teach music to Mrs. Harold's daughters, a stran- ; ger was again shown to her room. ' Alice felt joy spring to her  heart when she saw that he was an American. "News!" she exclaimed, " news from  home!" as she extended both hands to the stranger. Arthur heard her exclamation'from the adjoining room, and hastened to welcome the bearer. As he entered the room, the gentleman placed two letters and a package of money in the hands of Alice ; then turning around, he introduced himself as "Capt. Morley," of the ship "Clifton," informing them that he was sent there by Mr. Clermont to bring Alice and her   i friends to New York, where he would meet them, and added that he would call for them early on the ensuing morning, for  it would be necessary for them to pack their baggage that  night. Alice trembled so much that she was scarcely able to unfold her letters, which were from her parents and sister. Her  g mother wrote very affectionately, saying her health was very feeble, but she hoped to live to embrace her loved Alice once  more. -Mr. Glermont said they must come and live with' him ; that Arthur must turn farmer; while Mr. and Mrs. Grey would  be very welcome to enliven the long evenings of the coming J winter ; indeed I he promised himself much pleasure from their society, and should expect them to make it their home with  Arthur of course. Mary wrote that she was married, and had such a beautiful home, she should not tell her where until she, came to see her. When Alice had perused her letters, she went to break the j joyful news to Mr. and Mrs. Grey. Mr. Grey hoad laid down, for he was yet quite feeble, and Mrs. Grey sat beside him,  silently watching his broken slumbers. As Alice opened the , door, he started and awoke. "I have disturbed you," she said, as she took a seat beside him.    VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       83 "No, no 1" he exclaimed, "you cannot disturb us; all the blessings we enjoy are bestowed through you, my Alice ; and you are not the least of our blessings; I only wish I had a home for you, poor bird." "You quite spoil me, you pet me so much," said. Alice, " but I must tell you my good news," she resumed-not knowing in what way to commence the subject so near her heart, uncon- sciously fearing it would give them pain. "Good news I Alice," exclaimed Mr. Grey; "what plot now, my dear?" "No plot," resumed Alice; "my father has written for us all to come home, and live with him ; he has sent money for us to prepare for the voyage, and provided for our passage to York. He says he expects you will enliven the long winter evenings, and you must come." "You and Arthur and your mother had better go," Mr. Grey replied ; "as for me, I will stay here, Arthur can be security for my board, until I get well, and can earn enough to pay it ; or I may recover something of my lost wealth from my bankers; I think in time they will pay some of the demands against them." Alice knew too well Mr. Grey's thoughts. She knew he never could get well in Europe-she knew his pride revolted at the idea of receiving pecuniary aid from her father, and she tried for a long time to persuade him, without effect. Mrs. Grey joined with Alice in entreaty, but it was of no avail, and Alice went to her room in tears. She informed Arthur what resolution his father had taken, and he went to him, but returned like Alice, unsuccessful. At last Alice thought of an expedient. She well knew the power of music over Mr. Grey, and she composed a few verses to sing to him ; and after setting them to music, and as the evening drew its shade over the earth, she went to the room of Mrs. Harold, to invite her daughters to come into the parlor, to play and sing a few bal- lads for Mr. Grey's amusement. This done, she went to bring  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7463-00000044"/> 84       CECELIA GREY; ORB THE Mr. Grey to join them. He smiled as she held her hand to lead him, and walked feebly into the parlor, where she had a large easy-chair arranged for his comfort. "Thank you, my child," he said, as she arranged the pillows, and placed the foot-stool. The young ladies then ,sang a few pieces which Alice had taught them, and Mr. and Mrs. Grey complimented them, when they retired. Mr. Grey was also about to do so, when Alice, trembling, asked if he would not like to hear her sing. "Certainly, if you are not too tired," he replied. Alice could not trust her voice to commence the piece she had composed first, but sung in a sweet low voice, the "sailor's adieu," after which she sung with sad and trembling tongue, the beautifully touching lines she had composed. Mr. Grey spoke not for some moments, while the tears streamed down his pale and furrowed cheeks.        1 "Father," said Arthur; and the old man reached out his arms, and folded him to his breast.       - "My child," he exclaimed, looking toward Alice, "you have conquered-I cannot be separated from you all."      -I "Do not mourn so," exclaimed Alice, to Mrs. Grey, as she  reclined weeping upon her chair, " but rather rejoice-are we  not going home, where we have friends? Here we have none to care for us, nor any that we care for particularly. You did not grieve so much at leaving home, as this land, so unfortunate to us. I think if I ever leave it, I shall never wish to see or hear from England again." "You must excuse me," observed Mr. Grey; "I am getting old, and sickness has unnerved me; with the total loss of pro-  perty, it is no wonder I am so childish." Alice now urged him to retire, and Mrs. Grey took the light  and preceded him to the chamber. With a light step and a lighter heart, Alice paced the floor of her apartment. To Arthur's inquiry why she did not retire, she replied she was too happy-she was sure she should not "      ,      g   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       85 sleep. An hour after, she watched by the open window, and thought of her distant "home, while Arthur slept soundly, dreaming not that Alice was still awake. At last she laid down, thinking she might be tired on the morrow, if deprived of rest. She closed her eyes only in an effort to sleep; joy kept her awake; and she saw the morning light streak the western sky, ere she was aware she had been awake the whole night. She arose, awoke Arthur, and arranged her travelling dress, while the rose flushed her usually pale cheek with some of its former freshness. "Why, Alice," observed Arthur, "you look almost like your former self this morning; what have you been doing to make you look so bewitching?" "Ah!" replied Alice, " dreaming we were all at home-your father and mother with us, and we were all so happy!" "Anticipating-eh?" laughed Arthur, " that's it I Do not spoil all your pleasure, but enjoy it as it comes along." "That I shall," replied Alice, " and not spoil it either ; this subject will do to anticipate. Only do think how glad we shall be to get home I will we not have a fine visit with sister Mary?" "Oh, yes 1" exclaimed Arthur, entering into the spirit of the scenes in which Alice had lived for the past few hours. "I wonder how William gets along in the pleasure-seeking world! He was never very fond of-of, well-I will call it extravagance! I can think of no word more expressive of Mary's peculiarities; she is really an expensive piece of furniture, and so thought- less, I believe she will make him miserable 1" "Judge not," replied Alice; "you recollect." "Yes," resumed Arthur. "I recollect, but you don't." Awake father and mother-it will soon be time to leave this place, doubtless forever-at least I hope so." Alice went quickly to do her errand; Mrs. Grey was already up and dressed to go, but she had not yet awoke Mr. Grey, as c  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7463-00000045"/> 86       C OECELIA GREY; OR, THE she wished him to rest as long as possible. Mrs. Grey called him, and Alice went to order breakfast. A short time after, they all met in the dining-room, every one in high spirits ; and notwithstanding Mr. Grey's illness, he joined in the general hilarity with some of the cheerfulness of former times. The coach came which Capt. Morley had ordered, and they were soon whirled away to the pier where the captain awaited to take them on board. A few hours after, and they had left the coast of England forever. For the two first days, Mr. Grey appeared to be much bet- ter, but the ship's physician, whom Arthur consulted, gave no hopes of his recovery. He said it might possibly be that he would reach America, yet he doubted it. Mr. Grey heard the decision with every appearance of composure; but to Mrs. Grey it was the death of all her hopes of joy in life. She wept incessantly, and prayed that she might go too. She said she could no longer wish to live, when he was gone. Arthur and Alice were all she had to love in the world beside, and to them she could be no comfort. Mr. Grey tried to reconcile her and Arthur endeavored to persuade her to calm her grief, while his own sorrow was al- most more than he could bear.                 I As they came in sight of the American coast, Mr. Grey asked to be carried upon deck ; where, fixing his eyes intently Don the land, he exclaimed: "Now I am ready I Arthur, bury me by the side of my      father ; I would not be buried in the dark, deep sea. Fare- well, loved ones, farewell Hprepare to meet me." With these words his spirit flew away'; so calm and still did he look that he seemed like one asleep, as they bore him down to the state room, where Mrs. Grey, Arthur and Alice followed him. Mrs. Grey wept not-her grief seemed too deep for tears;    while Arthur and Alice stood with clasped hands and stream- ing eyes beside his earthly remains.              i "My father-oh I my father 1" exclaimed Arthur, " this is         .!    VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       87 all we can hope for in life ; what are his losses to him now? They will never grieve him more. Riches are nothing but vanity I Poverty cannot keep us from the happiness to come.": The vessel came to anchor, while they were unconscious of anything but their great loss. While Alice stood trembling and weeping, she was clasped in her mother's arms. "Weep here, my child-my Alice!" exclaimed Mrs. Cler- mont, folding her again and again to her heart. Then Mr. Clermont, Mr. and Mrs. Lee, William and Mary, who had come to welcome them, mingled their tears with theirs. Carriages were brought to the landing, and a coffin procured, and after placing the remains of Mr. Grey in it, they repaired to the home of William Lee, now the husband of Mary, to per- form the last said rites, before the burial. Alice was surprised to find her sister occupying the elegant mansion formerly owned by Mr. Grey. She wondered she had not before suspected who the purchaser was. Mrs. Grey's sorrows seemed to increase almost to agony unendurable, as they ascended the marble steps of the mansion. Arthur supported her as she went forward, and a servant threw open a side door which opened into the apartment in which Mrs. Grey's -mother and brother had died.. As she gazed upon the unchanged furniture, and upon her husband's bier, she sunk down insensible to the floor; and when Arthur raised her, he gave one loud, piercing shriek, and would have fallen, had not those standing near supported him, and placed him upon a sofa. When they removed Mrs. Grey from his arms, her features were rigid, and her complexion pale as marble. A physician was hastily summoned, but ere he arrived, Mrs. Grey had joined her husband in that land where sorrows are unknown. When Arthur was restored to consciousness, and heard the physician pronounce his mother dead, his grief was beyond control. For a long time he fell into fainting fits, and the physician had constantly to be with him during that day and  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7463-00000046"/> 88       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE night. Alice was almost worn out with grief and watching with Arthur. The succeeding day the funeral sermons were preached in the church which Mr. and Mrs. Grey had frequented while living, and their bodies deposited in the cemetery, beside his father and mother, as Mr. Grey had requested of his son. The succeeding morning, Mr. and Mrs. Clermont returned home, taking Alice and Arthur with them, wisely concluding that a longer sojourn in New York would add to, rather than decrease, the grief of Arthur. William Lee insisted upon their returning some time during the winter, to spend a few weeks with them, which they promised to do. Alice was truly glad, after so long an absence, to return to her childhood's home. When she entered the old loom, which Mary and herself had occupied, she saw lying upon the dress- ing-table, where she had placed-for Mary a Bible, a large and elegantly bound one ; opening it, upon the flyleaf she found the words beautifully written: "FROM MARY TO HER SISTER ALICE."   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.        89 CHAPTER VIII. Bright and dazzling as the gems That deck a monarch's diadem, And like the Robin, comes and goes-- Till driven back by winter's snows. ON the morning after William Lee had left the residence of the Clermonts, to see Alice take her departure for England, Mary went to the dressing-room formerly occupied by Alice and herself. Throwing herself upon a low ottoman by the window, she mentally exclaimed: "Strange-Alice never gave me a token of remembrance, not so much as a word I Well, if she had done so it would probably have ended in some good advice, which it is a pity should be lost on me. William says he believes me incorrigible, and so do I. How absurd for him to wish me a little more like Alice I I do believe, if Alice had not been engaged, William would have chosen her I Yet, I am far more brilliant in appearance than Alice ever was." Rising, she stepped before the large mirror that hung over the dressing table; as she did so, her eyes fell upon Alice's Bible. "Here!" she exclaimed, in astonishment, "is Alice's trea- sure, which she declared was more precious than jewels or gold  - She has marked all the passages that particularly pleased her, and made comments upon some of them. It will seem like herself to read it, I am so lonely now." Sitting down, Mary began rapidly to turn over the leaves,  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7463-00000047"/> 90       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE not knowing what part she chose to read. She at last thought of looking at the name of Alice. As she turned to the fly-leaf, she burst into tears. "What!" thought she, " have I wronged you so-my sister? I accused you of want of feeling, and here you have left me your dearest companion. The choice of my heart, had I expressed it, would have been this book. Your thoughts, your mind, your soul itself, is here; it is written here; in how many places can I see you I Oh! my sister-my sister; and I gave you what? A golden bracelet How much more would Alice have prized my scrapbook-which, if filled with non- sense, is like myself-to that unspeaking token. But she is gone, and I shall not soon see her again-perhaps never; yet I  hope to welcome Alice home, when she returns from 'merrie England.' How I should like to travel I I would visit the great city of London, the world-loving Paris, the pyramids of  Egypt, the burning sands of Africa, and the deserts of Arabia-' the Jerusalem of Asia; Mount Vesuvius, and Venice; bask in the Italian sun, and sail in the gondolas of the Mediter- ranean!" "But I shall never travel. William says, 'the eye is never satisfied with seeing, or the ear with hearing ;' and he shall be f content to stay at home, attending to his business, and passing his leisure time in reading, or in examining the contents of my work-basket, to be sure that I do not get out of work, and become idle I I fancy I shall not be very idle, with the whole of New York to promenade, and all my fine dresses to arrange.

Won't I have a merry laugh at their expense one of these days? Never mind -we shall see." With these thoughts running through her mind, Mary ar- ranged her dress for a morning walk, taking her way across the fields, accompanied by the old house dog, who was particularly cross to strangers, and a dread to all the children in the place. As she neared the small lake, the old dog sprang into the woods with a sharp growl, which was followed instantly by the shriek of a child. Mary ran hastily through the brush, screaming with fright, and came suddenly upon the brink of the lake, when she saw a little girl, poorly clad, with a basket of berries on her arm, jump from a rock near by, and missing her footing, fall into the water below. Mary hastened to the spot, and as she rose to the surface clasped her by the arm. With her unconscious burden in her arms, Mary waded through the water to the land. Placing the child upon the grass, she chafed her temples and her hands. In a few mo- ments, the little girl opened her eyes, and clung so closely to Mary, looking so frightened, and withal was so wet and poorly clad, that Mary burst into a fit of laughter, as she noticed her own soiled appearance, with the ragged and dirty child in her arms. As she laughed, Hannah Murray, richly attired, stepped to her side: "Are you not ashamed to laugh?" she exclaimed, addressing Mary, " when that poor frightened child is so wet?" Well then," replied Mary, " if you pity her so much, just take her in your arms, and warm her a little, will you?" "Pshaw, Mary 1" sneered Hannah, "hold her yourself; you don't expect me to, I hope?" "Why not?" said Mary, when the little girl sprung hastily from her arms, beginning to cry violently, saying: "My berries-my basket! Oh! what shall I do?" Mary looked for the basket, and saw it floating far away upon the lake.  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7463-00000048"/> 92       OECELIA GREY; OR, THE "Why, my little girl," said she, " your basket is away off on the water, and your berries, I guess, are all gone to feed the fishes."                          i "How cruel you are!" said Hannah Murray. ' Cheer up, little girl--run home, and your mother will give you another. Then you can come back and pick it full. I saw the bushes were black as I came along 1 Hasten, or some one will get them before you." "But I have no mother!" exclaimed the little girl, "and Mrs. Bixbee will whip me so, when she finds I have lost my berries and my basket too I Then she won't let me have any - dry clothes or anything to eat to-day. I was to have sold the berries and carried her the money." "Well then," replied Hannah, heartlessly, you must stand in the sun to dry your clothes, and pick berries for your dinner. I cannot tell you anything better. Come, Mary, let us leave her-she is safe." At these words the child sunk upon the ground, sobbing as if her heart would break. "You can go," coldly observed Mary. "How can you laugh so at that poor frightened child?"            i E Hannah gathered her shawl scornfufy around her, and walked proudly away. When she had fairly gone, Mary folded the child to her . heart. "l No mother?" she inquired. "Poor little girl--I thought as much I I wonder if you could not come and live  with my mother?

Come, lead me to your home, or the place you call home." "It is just through the woods here," replied the child. Mrs. Bixbee received Mary with a deceitful smile of wel- come, and the child with a frown, as she told her to make haste to wash the dishes. "Excuse me," said Mary, "had she'not better change her clothes? She will take cold 1"- "She has no clothes of her own," replied the lady. "She wears cast-off ones of my children, and there is none handy now. If I could only get rid of the little wretch I I prom- ised never to send her to the county-house, or she would have been sent there long ago. I can't be bothered to make dresses for her ; she don't earn her victuals by half." All this time the little girl was trembling with cold and fear, and hastening to get the breakfast dishes washed for the dinner. "I will take the child," replied Mary; " my mother would like her. Will you sell me some old garments to bchange these wet ones?"                 i "Oh!" exclaimed Mrs. Bixbee, "as for that, she is handy to do chores, and as I promised to keep her, I guess I'll not let her go." "To whom did you promise?" inquired Mary. "The child's mother, to be sure," replied Mrs. Bixbee, " and a fine lady she was; she came here with this little girl, all dressed in mourning, and very handsome mourning it was, too I Then you should have seen the gold rings and lockets, brace- lets, chains, and watches. She came from England; but she had lost her husband, and had no money. She sold me the jewels to pay for her board.

"I will give you something, to secure the services of the - child," said Mary, taking out her purse'; '.'get one of her nice dresses, if not too small, or worn out, and I will pay for that also," and with these words she laid a twenty dollar note  on the table. The woman's eyes sparkled as she saw the amount, and taking the child rudely by the shoulder she exclaimed : "It is more than she will ever be worth to me. Let me fix you, and you can go with the lady." Taking off the child's wet garments, she exchanged them for one of her own dresses, at which the child laughed and cried alternately. Holding it up to Mary, she said : "Mamma made it--mamma made it for me 1"It was of cypress cloth; and very rich in texture!      -  l Mary told Mrs. Bixbee that she would also purchase the jewels, if she would sell them, saying she would call or send for them at another time. Mary took the little casket in one hand, and leading the little girl with the other, returned along the road home. On enter- i ing the house, she led the child to her mother, saying,-  "Here is a little orphan I have brought you, mother, to  make you happy when you have lost both of your daugh-  ! ters."7 Then placing the casket in her hand, she told her the story X related to her by Mrs. Bixbee. Mrs. Clermont received the child kindly, observing, that if I she was good, they should love her very much.

"I teased a new  velvet cloak out of papa-you know," returned Mary. "Well, I concluded to do without it this sea- son, and with that money saved this child from everlasting misery with that hateful Mrs. Bixbee ; and I am sure I shall never regret the exchange I Now don't make any remarks, and say it is like Alice and unlike me. I intend that papa shall purchase the jewelry; Mrs. Bixbee has no knowledge of its value, and papa can purchase it for almost nothing! It will make the little girl a nice setting out when she becomes of age." At this moment Mr. Clermont came in, and observing the strange girl, he inquired,- "What child is this you are making such an ado about?" "It is my little waiting-maid," replied Mrs. Clermont. "Waiting-maid!" ejaculated Mr. Clermont; "which do you suppose will receive the most attention, yourself -or the child?" "The child, of course!" replied Mrs. Clermont, laughingly. Mary said she expected to perfect herself in the French lan- guage, through the instruction of the little girl, as she talked it like a native. "Then you have a selfish object in view?" said Mr. Cler- mont. Mary then told the history of the child, and begged her father to go over to Mrs. Bixbee's and purchase the jewels her mother had sold her. Mr. Clermont promised to ride over after tea and see about it. Mary then took the child to her own room, to fit a. dress for her. The poor child was evidently pleased with all she saw; she talking French so glibly, that it set the giddy Mary into a wild fit of laughter, which frightened the poor child so  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7463-00000050"/> 96       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE that she retired to the farthest part of the room, burying her face in her hands, and vainly trying -to repress the rising tears. Mary quieted her milth, and inquired of the little girl why she cried? "Will you whip me? Oh I will you whip me?" cried the child, clasping her hands above her head, as if to ward off the expected blow. Mary fell to laughing again, and inquired why she thought she would whip her?            .  "Oh!" exclaimed the child, " because I talked that infer- nal gibberish, which Mrs. Bixbee called my mother's talk." i Mary's mirth ceased in a moment, and the tears rose to her eyes, as she folded the weeping child in her arms.      "That hateful Mrs. Bixbee shall never torment you again," said Mary; "you may talk that gibberish, as you call it, as ! much as you please I It is good French, I know. I want you to talk it to me all the time, and when I don't understand you, you must repeat the word in English."  "Would you like to talk like my mother?" inquired the child ; " if you would, I am sure I shall like you." Mary took the little girl to the toilet, washed her face, and arranged her straggling hair to glossy braids, and found her more lovely than she had anticipated.

"Why i" he exclaimed, "she is a little lady already, and quite pretty, I declare I Lqok here, little--what is her name, Mary?"! "I never thought to ask," replied Mary. Mrs. Clermont laughed, and told her husband to name her. Mr. Clermont said. she doubtless knew her name, and asked : "What is your name, child?" "Birdella LaGrange," she replied, blushing timidly "A very pretty name," said Mr. Clermont; " but I suppose you will allow us to call you Birda?" "Oh! yes mamma always called me her Birda,". replied the little girl, looking up innocently into his face. "She could 'not have found a more appropriate name," observed Mr. Clermont. "I am charmed with your little pro- tege," he continued, turning to Mrs. Clermont; "I will get the carriage and drive over to Mrs. Bixbee's and purchase those jewels, if they are of value to our Birda. Will you go with me?" Mrs. Clermont arose from the table and went to bring her hat and shawl, while Mr. Clermont ordered the carriage brought to the door.

As Mary went to her room, she heard her bird-like voice, warbling sweet music in her native tongue. "She must learn me that song some day," thought Mary, as she arranged her hair for afternoon calls, expecting many; nor was she disap. pointed, for visitors crowded the parlor the whole day and evening. As Mr. and Mrs. Clermont stopped at a friend's for the day, Birda was not thought of until they returned. When Mary remembered her charge to the child, to go to her room with the embroidery when finished, she exclaimed : "There, she must have waited the live-long day, without her supper too, and all for my carelessness!" "You see," returned Mr. Clermont, " you are not worthy of the charge of this young creature H Your mother must see to that, if' she stays with us. But here are her jewels I you must give her a- box to keep them in, and see -she does not lose them; they are far more valuable than I expected. Mrs. Bix- bee asked twice as much as she gave, and yet it was not near their full value. This chain is no common affair, and as there  is one far richer with the- jewels, I will keep this. It will re- ward me fully for the money I have paid for the others, and will never be missed from the set, which is a very perfect one." Mary took the jewels, and arranging them in a mahogany dressing-case, she carried them to the child, who received them with a cry of joy, as she clasped them to her heart.  a Mary told her to look at them as much as she pleased, and then go to the kitchen or pantry, and get something to eat, for she had forgotten her at tea-time. Mary descended the stairs with a light heart. She had be- stowed happiness upon a fellow-creature for the first time, regardless of self or any selfish motive whatever. Besides, she i had deprived herself of one of her most desired luxuries-a  green velvet riding-dress, a black cap, and crimson plumes. "Ah!" sighed she, "'my old one will do, and make little    VICISSITUDES OF FORTtJNE.       99 Birda happy. It is better than dress!" she ejaculated, as she entered the parlor. Y Yes, better than dress P" exclaimed Mr. Clermont, who too well understood Mary's penchant for finery and appearances. After Mary left Birdella, the child snatched from among the jewels a locket, richly set with pearls and diamonds, and press- ing it -to her lips, she bore her finger upon a large heart wrought in the centre of the locket, when it flew open, reveal- ing the miniatures of a lady and gentleman. "My father I and oh I my dear, dear mother 1" she ex- claimed, kissing again and again the senseless pictures. For a long time she gazed upon them, then slowly closing the locket, thoughtfully said: * "I wonder if my mother knew I would ever see such a beau- tiful, good lady? I would like to show this picture to her; but no, my mother said I must not let any one know about this secret spring or of their miniatures, until I was fifteen, when I could open the casket; and she hoped I would use discretion in the choice of friends, not trusting the secret of the casket to every one. I will wait; it is but three years more; I know these people must be good, they are so very kind to me." After she had got her supper, she asked Mrs. Clermont what she could do for her. "Go right -to bed, child," replied Mrs. Clermont; "Mary will show you to your room. Good night 1" and she pressed a warm kiss upon her full lips, saying  "Remember your prayers, Birda, if you have been taught them; if not, Mary will teach you." Mary led her to a room next her own, when the child drew from her bosom an old and very much worn pocket testament, and after reading six verses over attentively, she knelt beside her bed, and prayed for her dear, good, new friends; she then returned Mary's kiss and good night, and quietly composed her- self to sleep.

First she thought of Birdella, fondly cradled in the arms of tender and wealthy parents, then driven forth into the woods to pick the wild ber- ries, or go supperless to her bed of straw away off in an old dark garret. Then of her own lot of uninterrupted peace and happiness, as far as want of the means of enjoyment were es- sential. She had never known care or disappointment in any way. To be sure, she had sometimes felt slight disappoint- ments, in the society of those who claimed her friendship, or care about making a striking or brilliant appearance at a party, But these things were of no consequence. Then her thoughts wandered to her future destiny. In that she could discover nothing but what promised an Eden of pleasure to her. While she thus reflected, sleep stole over her, and she dreamed that the future was open to her view. She saw herself at the altar, a happy bride ; then she saw an elegant mansion, with many splendid carriages, and horses richly caparisoned, driven to and from the dwelling, while the noise of revelry and sweet music was heard through the open windows. Lights flashed from a hundred chandeliers as she ascended the marble steps, walked through the halls, and stood with William Lee--who seemed unusually sad and silent-to receive. the assembled guests. i She thought that many eyes were bent admiringly upon her, and she fancied herself happy. But whenever she found her- self alone she was most miserable. Then again she returned to  the lighted halls, and listened to the sweet songs, mingling  with the merry dancers, or listening to the voice of flattery, i till her cheek burned, and her heart ached. She hastened back j to her own apartment, only to wish herself again the centre of ! admiring eyes, or began to plan a more captivating dress for the next assembly. At last, she thought William was never ' with her-she always went in a carriage alone. He led her ? sadly to the door, and without a word returned up the marble  steps of the mansion, and stood gazing after her until she could see him no more. She passed through several streets entirely 4   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE. ,      101 new to her, and stopped before a large church. She said to the driver  "Why do you bring me here?" "No matter," he replied; " enter the church, and you will know." She did so, and passing through the long aisle, was conduct- ed to a seat in the front pew. Before her was a coffin, covered with a black cloth - at last the sermon was ended, the coffin opened, and a dark man led her to the side of it, and pointing down, said: "See-see I Mary l" She stooped forward, holding her veil from her eyes, and beheld William Lee cold and silent in death. With a loud shriek -she awoke, and, found it was but a dream. She wiped the cold drops from her forehead, and smiled away her fears, thinking, "It is no wonder I should dream so, sleep- ing here; after thinking so much of happiness to come." Tucking the blankets around the still sleeping child, she went to her own room, and threw herself up on the bed. When she arose at a late hour next morning, she hastened her toilet so as to be before her parents in the dining-room, in which Alice and herself had rivalled each other, making it the theme of their morning entertainments. To be slatternly in appearance at the first meal, Mrs. Clermont had taught them to consider the height of disrespect to their parents. Although Mary had not paid' much attention to this injunction while Alice remained at home, she was far more particular when the duty devolved upon her alone. Little Birda was up before her, and in the kitchen entertaining the cook with her bird-like-voice, singing one of the sweetest little ballads, Mary thought, she had ever heard. She paused upon the stairs to listen till her parents' footsteps echoed in the hall, when she. sprung with almost one bound to the door of the dining-room, and closing it carefully, sunk into a chair as if an occupant for an hour o0 more.  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7463-00000053"/> 1023      CECELIA GREY; OR, THE  "Morning, papa!--morning mamma 1" she said quietly. "What new mischief now?" thought Mr. Clermont, for Mary was always sedate when she wished a favor from him. To his surprise-almost to his sorrow-she did not tease him. Mr. Clermont was rather fond of Mary's coaxing and persuad- ing. It was really necessary for his enjoyment. He often kept her for hours in suspense, to see her grave manceuvering, for it was the only time she was ever grave. Upon Birda's appearance she brightened up, and began her interminable nonsense. "Oh!" thought Mr. Clermont, " her new pet is the occasion of her absence this morning.". - Mary teased the child so much, that Mr. Clermont was obliged to tell her to desist, or else her kindness was no mercy to the poor girl.             - After breakfasting, Mrs. Clermont informed Birdella what would be required of her daily: First, to talk French in the morning for an hour, with Mary-which was a very pleasant task for Birdella ; then learn a lesson which she would give i her; and afterwards embroider or seFr an hour, stopping to do ! any little errand which Mrs. Clermont or Mary might wish ; ! then play or ramble around the farm, if she chose, till dinner;  and in the afternoon embroider and, practice music for two hours, under the tuition of Mary. The-rest of the time to do whatever they might wish her to, or employ herself as she felt disposed. In this way they passed the winter and spring. The coming summer found Mr. Clermont's family-preparing for the bridal I of Mary, as they had been the summer previous, for Alice. Mary would have liked a large company, but her parents and Mr. Lee were unwilling, and she reluctantly complied with their wishes. 1 One week before her nuptial day, Mary stood anxiously look- i ing from the old-fashioned windows of the kitchen, which  i commanded a farther view of the winding road than any other room in the house. -   - ^ i   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE. "I shall not be caught like Alice," she Aused, in my morning dress 1 even if it would please William better, to see me in dishabille. A full dress is far more becoming to my style of beauty than plain white cambric, without ornaments. As soon as I see a strange carriage on the road, I will hie away to my room, and not be in any haste to see him, either," At this moment she heard a footstep in the hall, which made the blood rush to her cheek. "My poor soiled muslin!" she exclaimed, as she saw her lover at her side. William Lee clasped her hand, thanking her for not dressing so superbly that he dare not touch her for fear of displacing some of her finely disposed ornaments, or rumpling her rich attire. "Why I how did you come here?" inquired Mary. "I left my carriage in the village," William replied, " with orders to drive over in the morning; I came across the fields, for I was afraid you would see me coming, and think it neces- sary to fix up a little." Mary was ready to cry with- vexation, for she really looked worse than she had done for a year past; her hair was not combed, and her dress soiled in gathering flowers from the wet bushes. William  saw her troubled glances, and laughed merrily at having caught her so finely. "Ah!" exclaimed Mary, "I will allow myself fairly caught, and a generous mind will not torment me further. But let me go to my room, and do justice to my neglected attire." "No, no 1" he replied, "that won't do 1 you must wear this robe till after dinner. Then you may make as elegant an appearance as you choose. Come, the old cook is making 'wry faces' at us-1 suppose she thinks our room better than our company, so let us go to the parlor." Mary ordered lunch, and they retired to the little family sitting-room, now unoccu- pied, as Mr. and Mrs. Clermont with Birdella were out riding. William informed Mary that his father and mother, brother  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7463-00000054"/> 104       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE and youngest sister would grace the wedding with their pre- sence; that his parents would not come: till the morning of their marriage, but his brother and sister might be expected two days previous. He continued that "Amanda was so much pleased with Alice's appearance as to be very anxious to form her acquaintance"  "Without doubt,' said Mary, "she was pleased with sister Alice; every one is so."  "Why Mary Hnot jealous of Alice I hope?" exclaimed    I William. "Jealous 1" replied Mary, starting, and looking haughtily X upon him ; "you are impertinent, sir."             "Now Mary do go up-stairs," he replied, "you are not at all like yourself this morning-no more so than your morning attire; I am sure when in full dress you will be the Mary of X former times, at least I hope so. You see I am not blind to X your faults, but expect by my presence to cure them; you do i not appear glad to see me, and I believe it is on account of  your poor wrapper."                   - Mary sprung quickly up-stairs, and stepping before her toilet i table she surveyed her soiled dress, her rough hair, and pout- ing lips, and burst into tears. "I am sure William will hate me," she exclaimed ; "I have been so cross; but I have no time. to cry now, for father and ! mother will soon come, and they will wonder at finding Wil- g liam alone.  I will dress just as plain as William can wish I should." So saying, she chose a light gingham, with white mull ? apron, and braiding her hair, she fastened it with golden pins, from which drooped clusters of deep red carnations, contrasting agreeably with her dark and flashing eyes. As she surveyed  ? herself in the glass, she was satisfied she should appear pleas- a ing to both William  Lee and her parents. She was neatly but not expensively dressed-no jewels flashed from her arms N' or hands, and William Lee pronounced her far more lovely than he had ever seen her before, as she stood in the hall beside him. I   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       105 Mr. and Mrs. Clermont welcomed William cordially, and they entered the sitting-room together, where they passed the time till the dinner bell isummoned them to the dining-room. After dinner, William anrid Mary strolled away, and did not- return until a late hour in the afternoon. They then passed the even- ing in reading to each other. "Mary," said William, " in this way I hope to pass my days. At work through the day, and enjoy the evenings at home with you, where I will collect a variety of useful and interesting works. I will read while you listen, and in turn listen while you read ; listening alike to the story and the sweet music of your ever-varying voice ; sometimes so sad, and then so gay, just as the book you read 1" "You will not always want to read," replied Mary. "It would spoil your eyes l" "Oh I never fear," replied William; "when my eyes get tired, I shall have a pair of bright ones at my disposal, that have never seen the service of my poor dull orbs." "Ah V" exclaimed Mary, "I shall not allow you to play the tyrant over my eyes. I shall have a great deal of use for them, besides reading. Everything will be new to me in a large and rich city like New York, especially the miserable poor peo- ple that live in wretched old, cellars, or garrets, freezing and starving. Those scenes will be entirely new, and I hope you will be very saving, so as to have something to give to others, poorer than ourselves., "My father gives each child his portion on going into busi- ness," replied William. "He makes him to understand it is all he may ever expect, and it will be for our interest to work for the welfare of each other. I have purchased a house, furnished in a style far beyond my means, if it had not been second hand. But I knew the good taste and neatness of the mis- tress of the mansion, and I am sure you will. like it, for it is a charming place-a perfect bijou. You will know nothing of its beauties until you have seen them." 5*  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7463-00000055"/> 106       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE These words had the effect he had anticipated. Mary thought him fooling her, and smilingly said, she had not expected him. the proprietor of any princely mansion, or hum. ble cottage. She supposed he was to reside with his father, and remain in the store to help him. "My father does not wish me to assist him," replied William. "My brother is with him in partnership, and it is from choice I t go into business for myself. I think I can succeed if we are i prudent, avoiding any unnecessary expense. A cottage, I am sure, ought to be good enough for us; there are many very elegant ones in town, and I should think myself fortunate in the possession of one.'.' Mary looked annoyed by these contradictions, and proposed to have Birda come in and sing, for them. The child had grown much in the course of the year she had been in the family of the Clermonts, and under Mary's tuition she was very accomplished for a child of her age. She sang beautifully, and was much pleased when William showed her the least attention. i She coveted his regard out of love-to Mary, for she wished to love all that her dear good friend loved. She thought it very  hard to have Mary go so far ; she had so few to love ih all the world, that she dreaded a separation from her.        "You never mind, Birda," said Mary to her one day     "perhaps papa will let you come and stay with me, and go to school." Birda, as usual, looked her thanks without speaking, as she turned her expressive eyes upon Mrs. Clermont, who sat read- ing in'the room.    .  Mr. Clermont smiled, and said he would think of it when she was a few years older. At present Mrs. Clermont would be too I lonely to spre her. Mary retired to array herself for the expected arrival of 1 Amanda and Edgar Lee.  She sat alone in her apartment-for  the last time- not like Alice, thinking of the past, but absorbed I in inventing new schemes of happiness for the future.. She did I /i   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       107 not wish for solitude--oh I no, it was irksome to her. William Lee was absent making arrangements for their marriage, or it is very probable she would have sought a companion. "I would go and sit with mother," she soliloquized, " but she is so absurd as to think of nothing but housekeeping; offering all kinds of good advice, peppered with an overabundance of tears, just as though I ever intended to roast a turkey, or excel in pastry. I hope to have both that are as good as an epicure can desire ; but as for my learning to cook, paugh H could never endure the smell of a kitchen. What a pity that people must eat-except as a matter of taste, just to gratify one's self in luxuries 1 I wonder if William has engaged a house- keeper? If not, I must take one along, for he intends to go to housekeeping immediately after our arrival in town. But a housekeeper from the country will never do I I must speak to William about this. It is very annoying ; I must not allow myself to be bothered with such affairs ; William will throw the whole burden of household matters upon my shoulders if I do I I will never pretend to think of such things, and he will not expect it from me." The tea-bell rang, yet Mary felt no inclination to join the family at the table. After some time, a low rap at the door aroused her and her mother came in, inquiring if she was ill, or what kept her from tea. They wished her company for the last time alone as Mary Clermont. Mrs. Clermont said this with a forced smile, which faded as she walked past her down-stairs. Mrs. Clermont leaned against the balusters,: forgetting her summons to Mary, until she heard a voice calling: "Come, mother; we want you to complete the family of the Clermonts i" With a sigh, Mrs. Clermont joined them, for her thoughts were now with Alice, far away. From her she had not heard since her departure, and often in the still hours of midnight, had the mother's silent prayers ascended to the throne of  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7463-00000056"/> 108       CEOELIA GREY; OR, THE mercy, for her absent, yet ever present child. Mr. Clermont's thoughts were now in unison with hers. "If I could only hear that Alice was alive and happy, we could bear the separation with Mary with far more resigna- tion," he said, turning i4 inquiring glance upon Mrs. Clermont, as if to still the wild agony of his own heart. "If Alice is still alive," he resumed, "I think we shall yet hear from her again; but I fear she is not-she surely would not neglect us 'so IV Mrs. Clermont arose in tears, and left the table, while Mary sobbed -aloud. "How thoughtless!" exclaimed Mr. Clermont, " what have I done?-driven your mother away, and tortured your young heart to agony, for what? an idle tale-a vain delusion. If Alice were dead, would we not have been apprised of it! Arthur Grey is not the man to' forget us, the parents of his wife ; rather let us think them so happy, as to find no time for letter writing-or the letters may have been miscarried ; alas I I can find no plea satisfactory-I know not what to -think; perhaps they have been unfortunate, and have not the means to return home; this is far more probable, and they do not write from pride."         - Leaving the untasted meal standing upon the table, he re- tired to the library. Mary sat half reclining until the victuals were removed, and the cloth drawn from under her arms, which was done by the cook in no gentle manner, murmuring: "I never saw folks eat all night I I guess somebody else is as hungry as the big bugs-for my part I am, and I won't wait always either l" Even this tirade did -not arouse Mary ; she still thought of Alice, far away--or, perhaps, lost forever. At this moment she heard a carriage drive up to the door, the bell ring, and company enter the parlor. Almost unconscious, with her eyes red with weeping, she went to receive the sister of her be trothed husband.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      109 William met her in the hall, and with a look of wonder, led her to his sister. He was astonished to see tears flash in those dark eyes ; he fancied them too bright to weep, or too haughty to be known to do so. As Mary encountered the gaze ofa manda's loving, yet searching eyes, she involuntarily thought of her own appear- ance, and apologizing for meeting her so unceremoniously, she said she had looked for them the whole day, and her father had been speaking at the tea table of her absent sister, from whom they had never heard ; and that unintentionally she found her- self weeping at the time -when it was the least to be expected of her to weep. To her astonishment she saw the tears start to Amanda's eyes, and they were instantaneously friends. William now led forward, and presented his brother Edgar; when Mary's father and mother came in to welcome them. Amanda was pleased with Mr. and Mrs. Clermont, and de- lighted with Mary. In a few moments' conversation with William, she eulogized Mary highly, pronouncing her fit for a prince, she appeared so perfectly good and beautiful. "She is not always good, Amanda," replied William, solemn- ly. "I am aware of her faults, and wish you to assist me in curing them. Mary is yet young, and exceedingly fond of ad- miration, which she is sure to command whenever in company. What I fear is, that it may draw hel from her own better self, and throw her into a whirlpool of fashionable dissipation, which can only end in my total ruin. You see the precipice on which I stand ; yet I cannot force myself from'rthe fatal brink. I love that brilliant beauty far too well, not to risk the loss of wealth to gain her, still I fear- her knowledge of her power over me I You must help me, sister, to conquer this propensi- ty for admiration-;" and he looked sadly and confidingly upon Amanda, who began to wish her brother had never met Mary Clermont, who was so different from her sister Alice.

"Are you fond of walking by moonlight?, inquired Mary;  if so, we will slip aVay for an hour, and leave the gentlemen to entertain the old people." Amanda was pleased with the thoughts of an evening ram- ble il the ountry; she followed Mary into the hall upon tip-  toe, so as to escape notice from the rest of the company.  They directed their steps towards the grove, and paused-be- side the little brook, which murmured gleefully as it went  dancing and glistening ia the moonlight, or black and sluggish  in the shade of the overhanginghushes. Soon they had wan- !1' dered through the grove, and found themselves near a flock of i sheep, that were quietly sleeping oa the green grass of the pas-  ture. "Ah I this is delightful!" exclaimed Amanda, throwing her-  self upon a moss-covered bank, and drinking in the still beauty  of the half-revealed scenery. "Give me the country for plea-  sure-what did I   ever see in the great metropolis half as  beautiful as ttis No artls sbeanutiful as tliis? No artist's studio can boast so rare a j scene."

Mary told her she expected to see scenes of far greater rari-  ty and beauty, in the new company to which her husband would introduce her; she should there find charms more lasting than  the fears of frightened sheep.     more  "What can be more lasting than the sublimity of a scene  X]   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      1Il like this?" returned Amanda-; " with the water on the right, silvered by the moon's direct rays ; the forest on the left; the grove and wood  surrounding us; a lovely girl singing wildly beside me; and a flock of snowy sheep bounding across the fields, the whole revealed by the soft pale moonlight." "You are a stranger to country scenes," replied Mary, "or you would never discern anything unusually beautiful in a sight like this.-" At this moment a shrill voice sounded an Indian war-hoop behind them I Amanda uttered an involuntary scream, while Mary stood a moment in evident astonishment, and then burst- ing into a merry laugh, gave back a scream as shrill and dis- cordant as it was in her power to vociferate. Amanda, trembling with fright;, started on a quick run for the house, and Mary, still laughing, followed her. As they entered the parlor, they found William and Edgar Lee quietly sitting and talking with Mr. and Mrs. Clermont. Mary was evidently astonished to find them there, for she had thought it some trick of theirs to frighten them. She whis- pered Amanda to say nothing of the little incident, or they would be thought a couple of simpletons, to get frightened when it was most probably the owner of the sheep, who had thought dogs were after them, and came out to drive them away. At this Amanda commenced laughing, and notwithstanding Mary's efforts to restrain her, her merriment soon drew the attention of the company, who wondered what Amanda could be laughing about so irresistibly; for although she tried to stop, she only laughed the harder, at the thought of her headlong speed through the brush, over log fences, and lastly old Tiger, who gave her an angry snarl, as she passed through the open' door, half dead with fright and trembling with exertion. Mary fearing she would reveal all, and herself would have to bear a share of the raillery, proposed to retire, and they sought their apartment. Amanda entertained her friend with the history of the many  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7463-00000058"/> "2       CECEiLIA oREY; OR, THE- new brides that had come to the city merely to squander theit husband's property, and left in indigence, and ventured to say that she hoped it would teach Mary a lesson of domestic econ- omy, and warn her to beware of display and too deep a love of admiration. This gratuitousl admonition from Amanda was too much for Mary's independent and sensitive nature; but she restrained the bitter words that arose for utterance, and -only petulantly  retorted that she was " not in need of a guardianess at this late day "  Amanda detected the effect that her words had produced, and was mortified and vexed. She regretted that she had been so premature in proffering her advice, and concluded that Mary was not always good, and not altogether bad; but she resolved that she should never escape a gentle reproof when- ever she indulged in any useless extravagance, even if it did call forth her ready repartee to her own discomfiture. Mary laid her head upon the pillow beside Amanda, with any but the most kindly feelings towards her so soon to be her sister.                ' "And so she evidently dislikes a married woman's taking any part in society," soliloquized Mary ; "perhaps she is afraid William will want some assistance from his father if we are not prudent; how selfish I I wonder if she does not expect me to cook, sweep, make beds, dust chairs, or mope in the parlor, and make myself a fright all to save a sixpence?" Had Amanda been more careful in choosing an appropriate time for her remarks on the downward course of others, with- out seeming aware of Mary's peculiarities, she might have as- sisted'her brother much, in eradicating the love of display from the mind of Mary. As it was, she made her only more determined that none should excel her in costly apparel and brilliant assemblages. "Ah!" sighed Mary, "Amanda will be disappointed in Mary Lee-the fashionable Mrs. Lee-the belle of the season I   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       113 Won't she be disappointed?--the selfish creature!

But Amanda will find her equal in plotting, if that is her game i" and wiping the tears from her eyes, she composed herself to- sleep. Amanda awoke with the first dawn of day, -and noiselessly arose, plaited her hair, and arranged her morning dress for a trip across the fields, She descended the stairs with a silent step, and stole softly out into the still morning air; no one was up or stirring that she could see or hear, as she bent her steps towards the or- chard. For a short time she .wandered from tree to tree tast- ing the different fruits, when coming suddenly to a little rivu- let, she resolved, if not too far, to follow it to its source. As she strolled along through thick grass, willows, marshes, and banks of violets, she compared her present happy freedom with her usual close confinement between brick walls and crowded drives, in which the slight glimpse she got of country life was so mixed up with city conventionalities, that it was impossible to enjoy or realize the still beauty of the scenery, or the rich notes of the feathered songsters, who ever and anon poured forth such glad notes of praise as to shame her into repentance, for her thoughtless and thankless blessings. Just then she came to the little spring, from which the liv- ing water ever bubbled forth, to gladden the drooping violets. The tall grass was overshadowed by the drooping branches of lofty trees, while the pebbles looked silvery from their depths in the clear water. She stood for a moment, enchanted with the sylvan nook, when she fancied that she heard a sob, as of some one weeping near her. , "I declare," she thought, "it is very strange--so many  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7463-00000059"/> "4       CECEL A GREY; OR, THE  tears this morning I If I .were to be married, I am sure I would not shed tears, nor allow others to do so, if they lived near me 1" Stepping softly forward, she put back the branches of a low bush, and encountered the startled look of Birdella La Grange, Mary's little protege. "Why, little girl; what is the matter?" inquired Amanda, kissing the child's wet cheeks. "Nothing-only I am so sorry, miss," the child replied, " that Mary is going away-she was so good to me i" and she fell to weeping again. "Strange-!" said Amanda; "but why are you out here so early?"  "Oh!" replied Birdella, "I could not sleep, and so I came out here alone when it became light, to think about Mary 1" "Ah, then," resumed Amanda, " we will go back together ; they will probably miss us if we stay much longer." Taking the child's hand, she bade her lead the nearest way to the house, and she would tell her a story to amuse her by the way. I The family were mostly assembled in the dining-room when Amanda returned from her ramble. Mr. and Mrs. Clermont welcomed her with such a kind, unaffected smile, that she felt sure William must be mistaken in regard to Mary's not always : being good ; for how could she be selfish, with such amiable parents and so gentle a sister for an example? . She would surely listen to reason, when her husband explained to her the I folly of fashion and extravagance. Mary at this moment came in--spoke coldly, almost scorn-   fully, to Amanda, while her eyes spoke sadly as she gazed   around for her little favorite.               "Birda," she said to the child, as she fastened a necklace of coral around the child's neck, and led her to a deep recess near the window ; "you will not forget me when I am gone?" and she gave her a locket with her own miniature.. "No, no-oh no 1" replied Birdella, as she wound her arms   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      115 convulsively around Mary. "And you will not forget the lit- tle ragged girl you picked up- in the woods?" "Never I Birda--never!" exclaimed Mary, as she gazed down into the eyes of the child, almost as much disturbed as herself. "Never, Birda," she again said; "I believe there is no one-no, not William himself-loves me as much as you, my little Birda. Yet I will not mistrust him," she continued, absently, as she looked towards that part of the room in which her intended husband was. "Mary," said Mr. Clermont, "will you not join us at breakfast?" Then William Lee came forward to lead her to the table, as Edgar sought Amanda who had left the room. "William," whispered Mary, "your sister hates me 1" "Hates you?" he exclaimed, " impossible! I never knew Amanda to hate any one--but here she comtes, and I will ask her." "As you will," replied Mary, slipping her hand from his arm, and taking a seat at the table. Mr. Clermont looked angry, and Mrs. Clermont bewildered; while William, recovering from his momentary confusion, de- clared that lhe should claim Mary's promise to pass the morn- ing with him alone, that he might give her proper advice for the future. "'I am no longer a child, and do not need advice," replied Mary, glancing towards Amanda. William instantly defined the meaning of Mary's cold and indifferent treatment towards his sister, and felt vexed at Amanda for her imprudence in giving advice unasked, and at such a time; he thought she might have foreseen the conse- quences. He was well aware that Amanda's influence over Mary was at an end, and he involuntarily shrunk from a union with the proud, impulsive girl. Momentally the idea possessed him, but it was as quickly repelled, for he had resolved, come what would, he would fulfill his engagement with Mary Clermont.  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7463-00000060"/> "6       OECELIA GOEY; OR, THE             CHAPTER      IX.           ? ON the ensuing morning, Mary was awakened by Birdella, who had been sent to call her. She arose quickly, and throw- ing on her morning dress, descended the stairs with her hap- piest smile. Her mother received her, and pressed a loving lijss upon her cheek, when her father 'folded her to his heart, saying she must be a good girl. Mary laughingly declared it was worth getting married, if it was only to see how much one would be caressed on that won- derous event. "Mary, oh my Mary; do not be so thoughtless 1" exclaimed Mrs. Clermont; " you are about to leave us, to seek for hap- piness in another home, and from new sources." "No-no!" interrupted Mary, "I shall often come home to you for happiness; and when you want to be happy, come to my new home 1" Mrs. Clermont smiled as she replied : "There is no real hap- piness in this world but that of childhood. But we must try to do right in all things, that we may have the less to regret in our old age, when we shall live in the past, and not in the future as we do at present; fot whatever good we do, will be a never-ending source of pleasure to us then."

Each one was pleased, and had Alice been with them, their happiness would have been complete. But so it is in this life; we have ever some one thing to mar our perfect enjoyment, unless we have learned -to resign our all into the hands of our divine Creator-to look to him for iour happiness here, as well as hereafter. Mary and Amanda arrayed themselves in rich attire for the marriage ceremony. They were joined at the church by Mr. and Mrs. Lee, who coincided with the general voice, that never had a more brilliantly beautiful bride stood at the altar. Well might they say it, for she was surpassingly beautiful and graceful, as she raised her bright eyes confidingly to her husband's as they passed away from the altar down the long aisle of a church; while Amanda, as she leaned upon the arm of Edgar, involuntarily murmured a prayer that Mary, her brother's wife, might become as good as she was beautiful. Edgar almost envied William the possession of the love of his elegant and graceful bride. Little Birda, all unnoticed, hid her tears behind one of the pillars of the church, while the friends and acquaintances crowded around to congratulate the newly married couple. After all had bid Mary adieu, and William was labout to hand her into the carriage, Birdella stepped quickly to her side, and pulling her dress so as to attract her attention, slipped a ring upon her finger, saying: "My mother wore it, and I loved her---will you wear it for my sake?" "Why, Birda," replied Mary, "this ring is valuable I But I will wear it."  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7463-00000061"/> "8      cCECrELI- GRLEY; OR, THE The ring was formed in the shape of a violet of turquoise and diamonds, being very beautiful and rich. Mary took from her arm a bracelet of pearls, which she desired Birdella to keep for her, and kissing Birdella, told her to learn fast, and be as happy as she could; and when her parents could spare her she would take her home to the city with her. Stepping into the carriage, she waved her hand to her parents, and was gone. Birdella gazed long after the carriage was out of sight, while Mr. Clermont stood watching her. "Come, my little favorite," he said, kindly taking her by the hand, "you must not be unhappy; my Birda must not lose her song, or we shall be lonely indeed. We will go and visit Mary sometimes," and he led her homeward. "William,".said Mary, as she held up the ring for his inspec- tion, "I shall always wear this ring; I feel confident it will yet bring my little favorite friends I It is very rich and beautiful, you see?" "Yes," replied William, and if she has relatives, they are probably wealthy ; at least, we must judge so by the value of her jewels." They drove to the little village, where Arthur and Alice had witnessed the scene in the churchyard, and took passage the same evening for New York, where they arrived early the ensuing morning. Mary was full of anticipation of happiness to come, while William was content to witness her delight at every new object that met her view. A carriage was in waiting to convey them to their home, and the swift horses soon drew them to the elegant mansion, which had received Alice a bride one year before. Like Alice, Mary gazed with astonishment at the huge piles of marble ' surrounding her, and as she entered the hall of her future home, and met the kind salutations of her servants,   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUE.       119 there assembled to receive her, and gazed upon the rich and tasteful furniture and statuary, she involuntarily clung to the arm of her husband and burst into tears. "Why Mary, what is the matter now? You are not unhappy in our new home, I hope," exclaimed William, " or is not what you expected? Come, let me show you your boudoir; you will find all there your heart can desire. I would have brought Amanda if I had thought you would be lonely; but I chose to show you our home myself, unattended by any one, and fancied it would be such as you wished, if your brightest dreams bad bqen realized." "Ah I William," replied Mary, "it was not that I did not like our home that I wept ; but because it is so much beyond what I had expected; and these statues are so life-like, that unconsciously a feeling of awe crept over me, and before I knew it, tears sprung to my eyes, and I clung to you; but it is past now, and I am so happy  What a charming place this is I "How shall I repay you, my dear husband, for giving me such a delightful home?" "Very easily, my Mary I You can repay me by being satisfied with its present arrangements and furniture, and not wishing me to go to any further expense in procuring every new fashion that is adopted by others with more ample means." "Impossible!" exclaimed Mary; "you need give yourself no uneasiness on that account; I could not desire aught more beautiful." William now led his bride from the boudoir to the library, from the library to the conservatory, to the drawing-room, and to the kitchen ; each and every room was admired and eulo- gized by its young mistress; and last of all he led her to their sitting-room, where they could sit cozily together. At this moment, the cook came to receive her orders for din- ner; Mary referred her to her husband, saying that if Wil- liamn's taste was always gratified, she need give herself no  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7463-00000062"/> 120       CEETA GREY; OR, THE            ! uneasiness about hers. William shook his head, and told Mary she must take a little pains to qualify herself as a house- keeper; he should not be able to oversee her business and his own, and it would be equally ruinous to neglect either. "Never cry ruin to me," said Mary; "if you were' so easily ruined, you would not have purchased this beautiful house, "or costly furniture. I am too young to be expected to know any- thing about housekeeping; I presume you have a housekeeper; if not, it is time you were looking up one ; if it is for nothing b else but to learn me. After I have seen something of city life, I will take lessons from her.  "Mary," replied William, atd the young husband looked sorrowfully in his wife's upturned eyes ; " we can hardly afford -  any additional expense. My income is small, and my capital is but a few thousand. My father is not as rich as many sup- pose, and I have received from him all I am ever to have. I have told you this before."' Mary knew her power over her husband. To be called the  ; fashionable Mrs, Lee, was the first desire of her heart; to - L excel all others-to be admired, was her ruling passion. William paced the floor rapidly, incoherently murmuring, "Does she love me?   No I she never did; so young I hoped I could mould her character and tastes ; I thought the o home I should give her would be so far superior to the one E she left, that she would be happy here." Mary gazed upon him, and smiled, but her brain was busy with thought, as she soliloquized, "He would rather have me shut myself up with him, never going out without asking leave-; which, by the by, I will, just to gratify him; then do as I please." Placing her arm upon his arm, she said, "Come deary, do not be angry with a wayward girl ;" and with a merry laugh, she promised to be better in future. William  kissed the lips of his bride, but his heart s was ill at ease. And Mary secretly exulted in her power over .   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       121 The door bell rang, and Mary heard her husband's well- known footstep in the hall. She sat down by the little work- table, taking a book in her hand, so as to make him suppose she had been occupied with reading. But to her disappoint- ment he did not come near her, but passed through the hall to some other apartment. Mary arose, half angry, and stood by the window, with her forehead pressed against the glass, in which position she stood when William came and stood beside her. He presented his mother's compliments, with an invita. tion to tea. Mary pleaded theat she was fatigued, and soon re- tired to her apartment. As she entered the, dressing-room, she saw upon the table a small mahogany box with her own name ingeniously wrought on the lid. Upon opening it, a set of pearls and diamonds met her view, with a little note- addressed to herself, from Mr. and Mrs. Lee, and Amanda, commencing with, "Our much beloved daughter and sister." Mary dropped the jewels, and the tears fell like rain over the little box, which her husband had evidently placed there for her. The note informed'her that Mr. and Mrs. Lee wished to give her something which she could keep as a token of their regard, and they had purchased the pearls for her.  The diamonds were from  Amanda, who had a set of older style ; they had proposed to purchase a new set for her; but she had chosen to see Mary wear them. No wonder Mary wept, after all her hard thoughts of her kind and forgiving sister; no wonder she promised as she laid her head upon the pillow, that she never again would mistrust - her frank, generous mind. A rmanda had  a double object in view, in bestowing her dia- monds upon Mary. She well knew if she did not present them to her, her poor brother would be importuned for some, which he could ill afford. She thought, too, in case of the loss of his property, which she feared would soon be the result of his im  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7463-00000063"/> 122       CECELIA GREY; ORE THE prudent marriage, they could reimburse their exhausted purse by the sale of Mary's diamonds. Mary's pillow was still wet with tears, when William bent over her, and pressed a good night kiss upon her lips. For a moment he gazed upon her, and with a sigh turned away; taking the large Bible from its place in a recess of the deep window of the chamber, he sought for happiness in its consol- ing promises. The morning light streamed through the half shut curtains, ere Mary awoke from sleep. Her husband had arisen a long time before her, and given ,rders to the servants for the day.  William returned to arouse Mary from her drowsy slumbers, and she had but just completed her toilet when the carriage arrived to take them to his father's house. Mr. Lee came to the carriage and almost lifted Mary from it, while Amanda took her in her arms, as if to shield her from the world, and Mrs. Lee gave her a kind motherly kiss ; Mr. Lee requested them  to follow him, and he would show them what good things their mother had been getting for them. Mrs. Lee urged Mary to taste many luxuries, which she said she had prepared with her own hands. Mary praised them, but could not enjoy them. She wondered how Mrs. Lee came to know so much about cooking; when they were -so very wealthy. She thought it no wonder, that her own mother should excel in the culinary art, for were they not poor in com- parison with Mr. Lee. Amanda and Mary retired after breakfasting, to prepare for  i calls, and discuss the evening arrangements; with which, to Mary's surprise, no one-no I not even herself--took a greater \ interest than did Amanda.                 -  At dinner they were joined by many guests; who were not   S slow in expressing their admiration of William's bride, or to i pay their compliments to her.

She exulted in being known as the belle of the eve- finger, glistened  there alone She had worn it t hus, thinking its curious workmanship might attract attention it being the only ornament she wore upon her hands. Amauda wore a white mull dress, fastened with a sash of blue silk, while a band of pear ls crossed her forehead. I can- not say that there were none that thought her more lovely than the brilliant bride. Therewas one present, who had for years loved that sweet girl, and been loved by her; but her father had forbid heeir uion, until he had earned enough t claim her, as her equal. He had this very night returned from  a foreign tour, andhad joined the guests, that he might remain unknown to Amanda     , to see f he could discover any token of her remembrance of him.   Like Mary, she wore but one  ring, and that was his parting gift-a ringof plain pure gold. Often he saw her tearful eyes bent upon th e ring, when she thought herself unobserved or alone. Once he saw her press it to her lips, with a heavy sigh. He waited  until after the guests had departed, and then  sent a  message to  Amanda that a stranger would speak with her in the drawing-roodm, alone. Amanda hesitated for a moment, and then refused to leave her apartments, replying that she was fatigued, and would see the stranger on the morrow  . T h e stranger took a locket from his bosom, and b id the waitin g-maid giv e it to Amanda, an d again ask her if she would see him.

A week after his return, a plain travelling carriage drove from the mansion of Mr. Lee, bearing away Amanda, the bride of Henry Ames, to his own residence on the banks of the Hudson, where we will take leave of them, to enjoy the happi- "ess their fidelity merits  We left William and Mary at the party; the one filled with delight at the empty compliments paid her-the other with dis- gust, at the empty show, thinking how happy they should be when it was all over, and they were quietly settled down to enjoy life, with its realities, without its cold conventionalities. The rose grew deeper on the cheek of Mary, and the light danced strangely in her haughty eye, as one after another took leave of the stranger bride, with words of honeyed flattery. William led his bride to the carriage with a sigh of relief, declaring he should be glad when- it was all over. "Say, love," he continued, taking the hand of Mary within his own ; " let me hear you say, you shall be glad when we are settled down quietly, in our own house, with no one to dis- turb us." "I don't know," returned Mary, impatiently. "How dull you were, this evening ; I never saw you so silent before!" "Well," replied William, "I am sure you did not need my services to enliven you. You had sufficient attention from a parcel of soft-brained puppies; but I suppose you despised them, as much as I did." "Pray do not annoy me with your lecturing," returned Mary, petulantly.       - William was vexed and grieved at her manner, and when the carriage stopped at the door, he conducted her to the drawing-room, and retired to his room without uttering a word. Mary gazed around her for a moment, upon the neat, tidy   PI            VICISSIB'UD ES Op FORTUGE. 125 room, with its cheerful fire, and then throwing off her shawl entered the dressing-room adjoining their sleeping apartment. ShePwas for a moment surprised at seeing her husband appa. rently already asleep; but she forgot this before she had laid her jewels away, so deeply was she absorbed in thinking of the party, and planning new schemes for selfish gratification. The morning was far advanced, ere Mary awoke on the suc- ceeding day. Again she fur that, her husband had arisen before her. She entered the sitting-room with a sweet smile upon her lips- shade paler than usual from the loss of her accustomed sleep. As she saw William did not look up, she supposed her entrance had been unnoticed, and, stealing softly to his side, she pressed a kiss upon his forehead, smoothing back his hair with her hand. He looked up inquiringly into her face, and the smile came back to his lips, as he saw the contented, loving look she bent upon him. "We shall see much company to-day, my love," he said caressingly. "I hopeyou are not much fatigued?" "Not in the least," she replied, "never you fear for me. " William folded her fondly to his heart, as he whispered: "Mary, dear, will you love me, your husband-or the world most?

At this stage of affairs, William received the letter sent by Arthur to him and Mr. Lee, and with great sorrow learned the situation of his early schoolmate and friend.

Although she sorrowed, yet not sufficiently to keep her from brilliant company. Ai1ce was sent for, and William was in hopes he could per- suade them- to make it their home with him; and that Alice would soon succeed in winning Mary from her worthless asso- ciates. He grieved, but could not blame them for their choice, after their arrival. Mary soon took a new fancy into her head. When she bad no other engagement, she must go home, to visit "Sister Alice and mamma."  She could hardly be said to make a visit--some- times only staying one night, but her rich and varied dress drew sufficient attention to make her excursions very agreeable to her. At first, William was pleased at this new whim of his wife; taking pleasure in gratifying her. But too soon he discovered its object, and begged Alice to use her influence with Mary to stay:her in her downward course. It was in one of her excursions home that, stepping from the carriage into the hotel, an aged, but still genteel-looking man, stepped quickly to her side, bowing slightly, saying: "Pardon me, madam, but will you inform me if you were at the Sandford party, given a few evenings since?" "I was, sir ;" replied Mary, in amazement. "Did you wear a ring, ornartented with turquoise and diamonds, in the shape of a tiny violet?" the gentleman con- tinued. Mary pulled off her glove, and held up her hand, on one finger of which glistened Birdella's parting gift.    VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      127 "The same i" said the stranger, seizing her hand and bedew- ing the ring with tears and kisses ; at the same time inquiring what she would sell it for, and where she obtained it. Mary informed him that it was a long story, but if he would enter the parlor, she would recount the particulars. "Gladly will I comply with your request, madam," replied the stranger. When they were seated, Mary informed him of her meeting with Birdella La Grange in the woods; of her going to the house the child called home; and of the death of the child's mother. At this the stranger wept aloud, and it was some moments before he could control himself to hear more. Mary then told him of her taking the child home; and of her father purchasing the jewels from Mrs. Bixbee for the child. The stranger then introduced himself as the father of Birdella, and continued in a tremluous voice,- "Incited by the demon of jealousy, I took to the wine cup, and while controlled by its maddening influence, I was tempted to murder the dear companion of my bosom, while she lay wrapped in sleep ; but through the interference of an old slave, I was frustrated in my fiendish design, and that night my wife fled the house, taking with her our Birdella and the faithful slave, together with a considerable amount of money, and her most valuable jewels." Here the old man stopped, towipe the tears from his eyes, and with a strong effort to check his emotion, continued: "The next morning, the base wretch who instigated my jealousy, tauntingly informed me that it was a fabrication-that my wife was as innocent of the thought of erring as the child in her arms-that she had despised him-that he had hated me from the first for winning her love--and that now his re- venge was complete I Oh I the untold agony of that moment I Not knowing, not caring 'what I did-as my enemy walked away, I picked up a heavy bar of iron that lay at my feet, and hurled it' at him I It struck him upon the temple, and he fell fhre ita ir  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7463-00000066"/> 128       QEOELTA GREY; OR, Tiit lifeless to the ground I The people that stood near arrested me, and cast me into prison, where I lay for many long/,:eary months.

Here the narrator, again overcome by emotion, paused to give vent to his feelings. In a few moments he rallied, and con- 'tinued his sad story : "My property had increased largely during my confinement, through the kind attention of the brother of my lost wife. A little over one year since, I set out to discover her hiding-place, hoping to be enabled-to make her reparation for the wrong and injustice she had suffered through me.

She informed the stranger that she was then going to Mr. Clermont's, where Birdella was, and invited him to accompany her. The old man was overjoyed, and could scarcely be persuaded to wait the short half hour which was required for the horses to rest.

Birda, with her usual alacrity, was the first to see Mary and find her way to the carriage, where she arrived just as Mr. La Grange stepped from it. For one moment he sur- veyed her, and then snatched her to his heart, and held her there with an embrace that almost suffocated her. Birdella was at first frightened, but as she gazed up into'the stranger's face, she gave a cry of recognition and exclaiming "It must be-it must be my father 1" she mingled her tears with his. When he could speak, Mr. La Grange held her from him, and gazed long and sadly upon her, and then folded her again to his heart, uttering in broken sentences: "My daughter --my long lost--my treasured daughter l" Mr. Clermont came out and invited the stranger in, when Birda brought out her jewels, and touching the secret spring of her locket, she held up to the astonished view of Mary and her parents, the miniature of a beautiful lady, and doubtless of the gentleman before them. There was the same cast of fea- tures, the same expression--only less sad, and more youthful. "ju I knew it must be my father," exclaimed Birdella;  "it is just like him." -And you, my   child, are just like your mother, at the time when I   gave her that locket, with the promise that 4 would love her while life should last. But I have lost her, and now will not our child comfort me ; or is there no hope left? I see there is none- for although I love thee, my child, thou canst never draw the anguish from my bleeding heart." Mr. La Grange thanked Mr. Clermont for his kind care of his child, and endeavored to persuade him to take some more substantial acknowledgment for his generosity;  but Mr. Cler- mont refused so peremptorily, that Mr. La Grange gave up the idea of rewarding him, otherwise than with gratitude, for the benefits conferred upon his child.

Alice had superintended her education since her return home ; but William Lee was desirous she should take their boy, as his mother neglected him so that he had become timorous and peevish, and was so weak that he was fearful he could not live. Alice had taken him under her charge, and he was now a healthy child'; arid little Edgar loved his aunty better than any one else, with the exception of his father. Early one beautiful morning a carriage, attended by a driver and footman, drew up at the door of Mr. Clermont. Mr. and Mrs. Clermont took leave of their protegee, with the promise that if she ever needed a home again, she-would return to them; -Birdella kissed Mary and Alice, wept over little Edgar, and then turning resolutely to her father, she held  her hand to him, and he led her to the carriage, assisted her to ascend the steps, and took his seat by her side.

She went to her father's home-the home he gave her, and was as happy as a good heart, acting conformably to duty,. could make her. One year after leaving Mr. Clermont's residence, she wrote to inform Mary that'she was a happybride; and at the close of another year, she wrote that she had named her little daughter "Mary Lee de Manual." At about the same time, Alice took little Alice Lee from her city home to stay with her. Mary would not pay the least attention to her children, although she dearly loved them. She never thought they needed the care of a mother ; and was heartily glad to get them under the care and in- struction of her sister Alice.

Mary's two oldest children had long been' re-' turned to her, and an accomplished governess provided for them, when William Lee found himself so embarrassed that it became necessary to mortgage his house and furniture. He begged his wife to dismiss one-half the domestics, and take the charge of the children ; but to this, Mary would not listen for an instant, insisting it would all come right at the pay-day I But when the pay-day came, and they had nothing to pay with, Mary fell to weeping violently and wringing her hands, while her husband accused her of ruining him. For a long time she would not believe her husband, but thought it a trick to frighten her, until an officer came to take possession. A thought then forced itself upon her mind-it was her only hope I Mrs. Dundee had long wished to purchase her dia- monds-she would sell them --and requesting the officer to wait until she returned, she hastened to the residence of Mrs. Dundee.  Carelessly laying the jewels upon the table, she asserted that she was tired of them, and would sell them to Mrs. Dundee, as she desired them so much. 'Mrs. Dundee re- tired for a moment, and when she returned, she laid ten thou- sand dollars upon the table, bidding Mary count it, which she did apparently with indifference. She chatted a half hour, then bade Mrs. Dundee good morning. Almost flying home, she laid the notes in her astonished husband's hands. "Mary, Mary!" he exclaimed, " where did you get this? I could neither buy nor borrow money anywhere 1" "Never mind now," returned his wife, " if there is enough to discharge this hateful addition to our household." "It is just enough," he replied, taking up the mortgage which stood against him, and dismissing the officer. Mary laughed and cried, when she knew how near they came to bankruptcy, -promising her husband to be more care- ful in the future. William informed her that the danger was not yet over. He owed several thousand dollars to Mr. Cle-   i!           VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      - 133 ments; but he was very kind to him, and ad promised to wait, if he continued to pay the interest. If she would only retrench in household iatters, stay at home and dress less ex- pensively, he thought he might save himself from total ruin. Mary discharged the governess, housekeeper, and porter, mak- ing the chambermaid take charge of the door; she then de- scended to the kitchen, dismissing all help with the exception of the cook, who grumbled at the new arrangements; but Mary promised to increase her wages weekly, which pacified For  a short time Mary labored with a good grace, when news came of the dangerous illness of her mother, and she has- tened home, just in time to receive her dying blessing. Wil- liam Lee hired the governess back again for a few days, until Mary could return, which -he had hardly done, ere she was summoned back, to follow her only remaining parent to the grave. Mr. Clermont willed one-half of his property to Mary, and the other half to Alice. Arthur was to keep the farm and liquidate Mary's claim. Arthur thought it best to sell one part of the place and pay Mary immediately. With this ar- rangement  William Lee was much pleased, as it gave him a chance to discharge the debt he was owing to Mr. Clements, Mary declared it to be a most absurd idea; that'she would not have  Arthur sell any of the old place; but would give them her portion in welcome. "Why, Alice!" she exclaimed, " you will not have an in- come sufficient to support you comfortably, without the most menial labor. "I am not too good to w ork," replied Alice. "But I w o uld have you more careful of your husband's property and affec- tion, not to throw both away for the tinsel of fashion." "Never you fear that," replied Mary; "I can be prudent when there is necessity for it; but not otherwise.

Arthur paid Mary her portion, and she returned to the city, when William tookl up the notes standing against him at Mr. Clements', and he prospered for a time, and hired more help in his house, for he did not wish his wife to be a slave at home. About this time Mrs. Dundee gave a party. William and Mary were both invited, with the express desire they should not fail to come. As Mary had not been out for a long time, William resolved to gratify her, by attending with her. It happened there was at this party a Spaniard, who had been one of Mary's most assiduous admirers. Although he always treated her with the most studied politeness, on this evening, he was, if possible, more attentive than usual. William was displeased, he hardly knew why; but he saw that Mary was particularly gratified with the admiration of the wealthy Spaniard, and he requested her to attend no more evening parties, assigning as a reason, that it was disagreeable to him, and he wished her company at home. Mary was angry at the peremptory manner in which he made his request, and determined to go at any rate, whenever an .opportunity offered. This, as she foresaw, soon occurred, and she took advantage of William's absence from home, to attend without his knowledge. She well -knew he would return before her, and it pleased her to think how angry he would be. She expected a storm when she came home, but what was her astonishment to see her husband descend the steps to the carriage, and gently assist her from it. Mary knew not his double -motive-of winning her to him, and of learning who escorted her home without inquiring. This proved to be, as he had anticipated, the attentive Spaniard.   4I: II          VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       13 William gently expostulated with Mary; but her old passion for company had returned, and she needed another lesson to persuade her to give it up. The ensuing day several of her old associates called, to learn why she had forgotten them. Among the topics of conversa- tion; they spoke of the beauty and styles of Mrs. Snow's new furniture. Mrs. Dundee observed: "Why, Mrs. Lee, you have not new furnished your rooms this dozen years; and this furniture-was used as many, before you ever saw it. You are getting entirely behind the times." Mary was perplexed; she had not the courage to say it was as good as they wished to have, and so she replied, that they were then thinking of new furnishing their rooms. When William   came home to dinner, Mary discussed the propriety of new  furnishing the drawing-rooms. William replied that he could not gratify her in that respect. Mary retorted that he had her money,' and she would have the furni- ture. William informed her that if she ordered it, he would be obliged to get in debt to pay for it, but she could do as she pleased. Mary took this for a  tacit consent, and forthwith ordered the  most expensive furniture, putting the old on sale by auction.  When William  returned at night, everything was in dis- order. Servants were carrying furniture here and there, and his wife was presiding over all, with the most bewitching grace. "Ah! ha!" exclaimed Willliam to Mary, with a hoarse laugh, "you   are in your element, beauty," and he crossed the hall, and entered. the library, where, after fasten- ing the door, he remained supperless and sleepless for the night.

Mary was so busy through the evening, that she hardly noticed her husband's absence; and when she found he was not in his usual sleeping-apartment, she smiled and said:     - "In a huff, I suppose I Well, he can repose where he chooses, for all I care to the contrary. He will get over it by to-morrow." In opposition to her expectations, he came not near the dining-room, until after she and the children had breakfasted ; when he came in, and kissing the children, hastily partook of a light breakfast, and left the house for his store, where he awaited the bill for the new furniture with a heavy heart. He took it from the boy that brought it, and found himself in debt five thousand dollars for needless furniture, besides owing two thousand upon his goods. With a sigh he told the boy to wait, and going to Mr. Clements, he mortgaged his property for eight thousand, and paid up those bills which he supposed was all he owed. On his-return home in the evening, his wife was absent, having gone to another party, and he scarcely saw her for the next six months, unless surrounded by company, and he spoke with her scarcely as many-times; but 'devoted all his spare hours to his children. One morning as the family met (an unusual occurrence) at the table, Mary made the announcement to her husband, that she must give a party ; she had been out so much that every one expected it of her. "Well!" exclaimed William, springing to his feet, and shaking his finger at her, "I forbid it," and taking his hat he left the house. "He forbids it I indeed 1" exclaimed Mary, sneering. "I guess he has pouted long enough, about this new furniture I It may as well displease as to please-it is all the same." The cards were written, the company invited, and William   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      137 Lee was again involved in an additional debt, to cover the ex- penses. He said nothing, but with a kind of desperation paid each bill as it was presented to him. But imagine his chagrin as sitting in-his counting-house alone, on the evening of the party, a man presented a bill for payment of five thousand dol- lars, for a set of diamonds his wife had ordered. He threw the bill in the fire, bidding the man follow him, and he would pay him.    Walking hastily home, he entered the brilliantly lighted drawing-room, where young Walter Clements was making merry for the company, with all manner of grotesque doings and sayings. Immediately upon    seeing  William, he ex- claimed: "Ha I old chum, we were afraid we   should not have' the pleasure of your company this evening I I should have held an everlasting grudge against you, if you had made this party and jilted us." "No matter if  .you had," replied William, " it was none of my doings, and I  had expressly forbidden it." "Do not expose yourself in company, pray ;" exclaimed Mary, reddening-with anger. "Here," Said William, advancing, and  almost tearing the jewels from  Mary's neck and arms.  "Here are the diamonds my wife purchased ofo you;r  master can take them or nothing. Turning to Walter Clements he requested him to tell his father to secure his demands against him, before it was too late ;  for he should have nothing long. The company, who were mostly schoolmates of William Lee, or people well acquainted with the respectability of his relatives, sympathized warmly with him generally. But there were some that exulted in the bitter lesson of ruin and dis- grace, that had fallen upon the attractive and fashionable belle; for Mary had reigned preeminent, since her debut in fashionable society.

Mary began to coax her husband into a kinder feeling towards her. She had heard from his lips their lutter ruin, and it fell like fire upon her brain. But when he came to her-took the jewels from her hair, and she noticed the peculiar emphasis he placed upon the word "owife " it seemed as if her blood con- gealed to ice, and her heart ceased to beat. Yet 'she only smiled scornfully, and turned a shade paler than usual. But when all she most feared had gone, she sought to reconcile her husband to her. She owned it was her own fault that had brought ruin upon them. She promised if he would only for- give her-if he would only love her as of old-he should never again have reason to complain I ' Henceforth I can love only the children, Mary Clermont," he exclaimed, coldly. The epithet he gave her aroused Mary's pride, and she answered : "Yes I ever since I have borne the name of Lee, it has been nothing but retrenchment and reform!" "Welll you will leave off where you began," replied William, curtly. At this insinuation, that he should take her home to her sis- ter, the Spaniard stepped to the side of Mary, whispering to her, "Would she accept of his wealth, he would think himself honored to care for her children and herself." Mary, astonished at this base insinuation, replied : "You think yourself at liberty to insult me, since my husband has done so. Well I at present I have no other alternative but to endure every indignity that can be heaped upon me I Ah, Alice I true--all my troubles were to come." William overhearing the last few sentences, turned frowning darkly to the Spaniard, and bade him repeat the words he- had said to his wife. This, to the alarm of Mary, he did, taking out his watch as if to learn the hour.    &#xD;<pb n="Illustration-139" xml:id="VAC7463-00000072"/> 77-' PLUNGING h's hand into a side pocket, quicker than thought he drew a dirk, and   , pierced William Lee to the heart.

My dear--dear children-fatewell," and as his brother stooped to catch his words, his life's blood welled away. When Mary returned to consciousness, she was in a luxuri- ously furnished apartment, in her brother-in-law's house, and his wife sat beside her. Mary had looked upon her face for some moments, unper- ceived, when that lady turned her eyes upon her, and said: "Mary, do you know me?" "I do, dear Lucy," replied Mary, " but how came I here? I am not sick, am I?" "You have been sick, Mary, and must now be very quiet." "And how came I sick here-why not at home?'

Mary made an effort to continue, but Mrs. Lee placed her finger upon her lips, and shook her head. Mary nestled her head upon the pillow, and shut her eyes, in the vain effort to shut out thought. For a few moments she lay thus, when recollection returned vividly, and the last sen- tence her husband addressed her; forced itself upon her mind- "The children P" "Mary Clermont "-and his cruel death.

When Mary awoke-under the influence of the narcotic, she talked calmly of her past life, and the prospects of the future. Mrs. Lee informed her that her husband's creditors had taken everything of value they could find. That Edgar Lee had' taken her and her children home, and if she would stay with them they would provide for them. But she must take charge of her children. Mary inquired if her sister had not come to see her. Mrs. Lee informed Mary that she had, and that Alice had been very anxious to take the children home with her, but they would not consent, for they were more able to keep them, than Mr. Grey. Mary resolved to return to her native place--move her children and take in sewing to support them. Therefore she wrote to Alice, to secure her cheap apartments near the village, where she could live comfortably, and when she was able to work, she would take possession of them. Alice promised to assist her as much as possible, in the bringing up of her family, and two months after the date of Mary's party, saw her occupying the low cottage, in which Alice and Cecelia had called to invite Alice and Emily Lee to -attend Cecelia Grey's birth-day party. Edgar Lee had then reached his fifteenth year, and was with his Uncle Edgar, in his counting-house. Mrs. Lee had often been urged:o accept a home with her husband's relatives, and to distribute her child- ren among them. But her invariable reply was her husband's dying words-"My dear-dear children."   "!          VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       141 CHAPTER     XI. ' Here we come, and there we go. Gathering lilies white as snow,  - . Plucking violets in the dell, And singing with the whippowil." AFTER having fully introduced our characters, we now return to the party of Cecelia Grey, which we introduced at the beginning of our narrative. Early on the morning of Cecelia's party, she was  kenea from sleep by her mother calling, "Cecelia I come, dyer, get up, you have much to do to-day!" Cecelia sprang up, partially dressing herself in the dim light' of the room, and ran down stairs -exclaiming: "Does it rain, mamma?" "Yes, child," replied Mrs. Grey; "but it will soon clear away. : Sweep the pantry, and put things to rights there; while I prepare breakfast." "Mamma," inquired Cecelia, "does everybody's little girls help their mother?" "I think not," replied Mrs. Grey; "I have no recollection of doing so when I was little." "Then why do I?" "Because," replied Mrs. Grey, "your father is worth only half as much as was mine." "What difference does that make?" said Cecelia, "am  I not worth only half as much as you when you were little like me?"  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7463-00000074"/> "2       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE "Why, yes ; what a question child I You should consider from what I told you, that we are not as able to hire, as your- grandfather was." ( Well, mother," continued Cecelia, " what did Mrs. Yarns mean when she told the old minister that Mary was ever gene- rous, but you was always so little you could not help to pros- per?" "Hush, dear," replied Mrs. Grey, " you must not say the old minister-it is disrespectful. Who did you ever hear speak in that way?" "Oh I Henry and Julia Yarns, and all the Yarns. Mrs. Dwight said all that the Yarns done was right, for they were rich. Delia Dwight is coming to my party, and Julia -Yarns said she was too big. She is not as big as Cousin Alice, and they two can come together ; can't they, mother?" "What new idea has my daughter got?" said Mrs. Grey, she never called me mother before; why do you not call me mamma?"                - ; Why I Julia Yarns said Sylvia Smith said, that she did hate to hear'me say mamma, so babyish. Now I thought I would commence practising this morning, so that it would be easy for me to say mother, by the time the girls got here." "Cecelia, you are very foolish I I am sorry I allowed you to have a party. If you are afraid of Julia Smith or Julia Yarns, I will send them word to stay at home ; I do not choose my little girl to imbibe any of their notions of right and wrong. She should come to me if she requires advice in any of her little affairs. Will you promise me to drop all those airs, and to talk as you have been taught to at home, or shall I for- bid those girls associating with you?" "Oh, no I mother," exclaimed Cecelia, "I love them dearly; they always sit with me at school, to keep me from that hate- ful Lucy Dale." "Will you promise me, Cecelia, to treat all the little girls alike?"   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       143 "Yes, yes, mamma," replied Cecelia, "I will do whatever you tell me." "Have you not invited Lucy Dale?' "No, mamma ; Sylvia said she would not come, if I did." The I bid you to go over immediately and invite her." Cecelia reluctantly complied. Putting on her shawl and bon- net, she set out for the residence of Mrs. Dale, who was a poor widow, that lived near. She was by far a more accomplished woman than either Mrs. Yarns or Smith. As Cecelia neared the house, she paused to think "would not Lucy Dale resent this late invitation?" As she rapped softly at the door, she heard Lucy's silver 'voice pleasantly respond, "Come in." How different, thought little Cecelia, from Sylvia's haughty "Will you walk in?" As the door opened, Lucy advanced, and when she saw who it was she threw her arms around Cecelia, saying, "I knew you would come, dear Cecelia; we have played together too often to let you forget me." Cecelia blushed, and stammered something about being busy. She then urged her invitation. "Oh yes!" replied Lucy; " mother said I must not be too sure, for you might think the daughter of a poor widow woman not a fit associate for you. But I persuaded her to get up early, so I could finish my new dress to wear. Mother took part of it over to old Mrs. Malcom's to make. I am to do the work and sew till she comes back, and you must keep me com- 'pany!" "You must excuse me, Lu," said Cecelia with her old fami- liarity. "I must go home and assist mother, she needs m e" Cecelia bid Lucy good morning with a much lighter heart -than she had when she came. On her way home, she thought what if Sylvia should not stay? Well, I don't care," she soliloquized, "Lucy is a far better girl than Sylvia Smith." Mrs. Grey inquired, upon Cecelia's return, if she had invited Lucy Dale.  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7463-00000075"/> "4       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE Cecelia smiled, and replied, "Lucy is coming and has-got a new dress to wear."' "That will make her no better," remarked Mrs. Grey. "Then why does it make Sylvia or Julia better?" -inquired Cecelia. "It does not,' replied Mrs. Grey. "Do you really love them as well as Lucy Dale?" "No, mamma, for Lucy is kind and obliging, while Sylvia is overbearing, and won't play unless we all do as she says." It So you see, my child," continued Mrs. Grey, "that fine clothes and rich parents do not make us any better, or make any one love us? On the contrary, many that pretended the most regard for them, do so from a selfish motive. Were it in their power to prove their ruin, they would not fail to do so. But because they cannot destroy them, they flatter and pretend great affection for them, while in their hearts, they despise their haughty ways. Now you must not think because some wealthy people are like the Smiths or Yarns, all are ; on the contrary, there are those among the wealthy of real moral worth-of cultivated minds and of generous and kind impul- ses." "Mamma," exclaimed Cecelia, "  I wonder if those two poor little children will come here again? They were so little they could not be very bad. How old do you think they were, mamma?" "I don't know," replied Mrs. Grey, " perhaps four and six. The boy might not have been more than two years older than the girl." "Why did you not keep them, mother?   I could make almost all their clothes. Poor children, with no home-no parents or clothes. Oh 1 how hungry they were. We could take one of them I Now won't you keep them if they come back, mamma?" Mrs. Grey needed no urging to comply with her little daugh. ter's request. She had often felt reproach of conscience, for   turning the little unprotected orphansfrom her door. She had before resolved if they ever came back to her, she would give them a home, and surround them with such comforts as she possessed. Mrs. Grey requested Cecelia to dust the furniture, and j arrange some wild flowers in a vase over the mantel-piece; which she had done to her evident satisfaction, as she heard the voice of her aunt Mary Lee and her cousins coming up the walk to the house. Obeying the impulse of the moment, she ran down the steps and throwing her arms around both Alice and Emily, she expressed her pleasure at their arrival. Mr. and Mrs. Grey often  assisted Mary Lee; but she chose to do all she could for herself, and would accept of no pecu- niary aid from her husband's friends, excepting the little assis- tance Edgar afforded her through his wages.  Mrs. Grey used every effort to try to make Mrs. Lee forget the loss of her hus- band;- but she never saw her old smile come back, it was gone forever-her only pleasure now  was in her children.  Mrs. Grey had exhausted her ingenuity in preparing a dinner to suit her sister and the children, but she looked in vain for any acknowledgment of its merits from  Mrs. Lee; she seemed not aware that her favorite dishes were all before her, and was entirely unconscious of the merits of the viands she tasted-; while Mr. Grey and the children gave sufficient evidence of their gratification, and the pleasure they enjoyed. A slight rap was now heard, and Cecelia hastened to show Sylvia Smith into the parlor. Laying aside her bonnet, Sylvia expressed her delight in getting there before the rest of the company. She did so hate to be stared at by the vulgar many, who never failed to do so at every opportunity. Taking up a  book she commenced looking over the pictures without so much as noticing Cecelia again, for some moments, who, seeing she was likely to entertain herself, went out for her cousins. On returning to the room with them, Sylvia just raised her 7 &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7463-00000076"/> "6       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE  eyes, surveying Alice and Emily with a supercilious air, and turned her back to them as if for better light. Another rap at the door called Cecelia away, and in a moment more Julia Yarns was ushered in, when, as if electrified with new life, Sylvia Smith sprang up, and kissing the new comer, declared herself delighted, for if she had not thus timely arrived, she must have retired, how much soever she disliked leaving Cecelia alone. Emily Lee being now entirely unnoticed, stole away to the side of her mother. When rid of their presence, Sylvia boldly declared that she did not keep the company of such as the Lees, if they had got new dresses on. Cecelia, I am sorry to say, declared she should never thought of inviting them, if they had not been relatives. "Ah!" exclaimed Sylvia, "Miss Yarns thinks as I do--if she had such relatives, she would never own them." One by one the little group gathered, until they numbered a dozen or more, in Mrs. Grey's parlor. Cecelia then went in search of her cousins, who had left the room upon Sylvia's first unpleasant remark, and found them in the sitting-room, entertaining Lucy Dale. Alice said that Cecelia had better return to the parlor without them, as they were very contented by themselves. But Lucy and Emily con- sented to go with her. Cecelia wound her arms around Alice saying: "You must go; I cannot be happy without you." Alice reluctantly con- sented, and Cecelia blushed scarlet as she met the glance of Sylvia and Julia. Lucy, with one arm around Emily, the other hand free, has- tened from one to another, kissing one, embracing another, until she came to Sylvia and Julia, who turned haughtily from her proffered salutation, remarking, "It is a curious way of persuading a person to attend a party, to promise it shall be very select, and then invite everything and every one to it."   Lucy stood amazed; something of the truth came flashing across her mind. Cecelia was angry beyond control, and told Sylvia she knew she said she would not invite Lucy, because she had influenced her by saying if she did, she would not stay. But she had finally concluded Lucy's company would be preferable to hers, and if she chose she could retire. Sylvia and Julia snatched their bonnets, and were about to leave, when Mrs. Yarns entered the room, accompanied by Mrs. Grey and Mrs. Lee. When Mrs. Grey had inquired the reason of the disturbance, 'Mrs. Yarns declared herself ashamed of Jnlia; that Lucy was a far better girl than either Sylvia or herself. Sylvia threw her bonnet upon the table, telling Cecelia she was only joking, and had no thoughts of going home. Mrs. Grey told her, that when she came to see Cecelia, she must recollect for the future, that there were many who wore poorer dresses, that must be preferred to her, until she knew her proper place, and learned to do as she would be done by. Sylvia was very angry, but did not venture a reply. She ever shunned Cecelia afterwards, who evidently profited by her neglect, for the good seeds sown in her heart were not overrun by the brambles and weeds, sown there by a false-hearted and intinate friend, such as Sylvia had ever been, in school hours, and in play hours. After an unusual amount of juvenile gossip, and several unfortunate mishaps, the little party broke up. When Cecelia had seen the last little guest through the gate, she turned to AliceLee  , and throwing her arms around her neck, she exclaimed: "Cousin Alie, I am very unhappy; I never desire another party, if it is to bring me as many unpleasant thoughts as has this one!"And then she thought of the words she had uttered to her mother, on the evening previous-and which the reader   &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7463-00000077"/> "8       CECEZIA GROEY; OR, TH  will remember commences our narrative-"Oh won't we be happy to-morrow?"

ECCELIA awoke late on the morning after her party, and was startled to find the -sun shining full in her face. She soon remembered the events of the last evening, and resolving to make all the amends in her power, to her aunt and cousins, for her former ill-treatment, she bathed her temples and eyes in the clear cold water, and sinking upon her knees, she implored her Heavenly Father to assist in fulfilling her determination, and to keep her from again falling into the snare of evil doers or evil thinkers. ' Avoid them-pass not by them," she mur- mured, as she descended the stairs, and gave her mother a pleasant good morning. Hastening into the breakfast-room, she kissed her aunt, and with blushing cheek aud downcast eyes, told her she had been very thoughtless and careless of her comfort. She hoped she would forgive her. Mrs. Lee replied that she had nothing to forgive, and Cecelia hastened to embrace her cousins, and tell them she was very sorry she had made them so unhappy the day before. They should never have reason to reproach her again, if they would restore her to their confidence. Mrs. Lee was now determined on returning home, for she was expecting Edgar the ensuing week, and wished to make her home as attractive as possible to him, during his stay. She asked Mrs. Grey to allow Cecelia to return with them, and Cecelia was almost wild with delight at the unthought of privilege.  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7463-00000078"/> 150       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE Mr. Grey shortly after brought his carriage to the door, handed Mrs. Lee and the children to their seats, and taking Cecelia in his arms, drove away. As his fine horses moved swiftly along, he called Mrs. Lee's attention to the beauty of the scenery, with the improved farms, fine houses, and orna- mental shrubbery, which was seldom met with in so retired a place. Mrs. Lee expressed her pleasure in a manner that showed too plainly she could no longer enjoy it. In a short time our little heroine, with her aunt and cousins, alighted at the door of Mrs. Lee's humble dwelling. "Ah I my little niece," exclaimed Mrs. Lee; " it is my own fault that I have no better place to receive you than this hum- ble cottage. How happy could we have been, had your uncle only lived." "Aunt, it looks charming, with your fine taste to adorn it," replied Cecelia. "How sweetly those woodbines and jasmines cluster around the windows, and those June roses show their bright colors, nestled down amid their dark leaves ; I am quite sure, dear aunt, I could never weary of such loveliness." "Oh! no," returned Mrs. Lee, absently; "all places are alike unpleasant to me now. I feel like one without an object in life-all places unsatisfy me. Yet I have much-very much (glancing up to her husband's and children's pictures), to live for-much to do ; may heaven lend me its aid, that I may be a wise mother, and fill the place of the father of whom I have deprived them." Alice Lee gazed up at her mother, with sorrow expressed in every lineament of her face, pale as her mother's, and in every respect more touching. Alice Lee was very lovely; the sweet- ness and intelligence which ever beamed from her dark blue eyes, combined with her grace of manners, made her a general favorite with all with whom she became acquainted; while Emily, the counterpart of her mother, with her da'rk eyes and brunette complexion, promised the same brilliant and, thought- less beauty Mrs. Lee had once been.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       151 tCHAPTER XII. MRS. GREY greatly feared her daughter's ability to avoid the company of Sylvia Smith and Julia Yarns. She determined to withdraw  her from  the little writing-school she had been attending one day in the week- with them.   Of that school Cecelia was very fond, both on account of the praise she received from her instructor, and the chance it afforded of meet. ing her associates. Mrs. Grey knew each meeting she had with them, would only make their' principles less detestable to her child, and after giv- ing Cecelia her lessons for the day, she told her to bring her writing-book from the desk, with pen and ink. Cecelia looked inquiringly up to her mother, as she wrote copy after copy in the book. At  last her curiosity prevailed and she exclaimed-: I Mamma I   what in the world are you going to do with my *book? What will Mr. Thatcher say when he sees it? You must not, mamma 1" and she began to cry. "Cecelia," said Mrs. Grey,  when you go to writing-school who walks with you there?ey "Only Sylvia and Julia, mamma." "Well, child, can you remember the theme of their conver. sation generally?" inquired Mrs. Grey. Yes," replied Cecelia, "most of the time they tell about the latest styles; or Mrs. Canterbury's new velvet, or Mrs. Stumps, old head-dress, and that old thibet shawl of hers.  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7463-00000079"/> 152       CECELIA GREY; Or, THE Mamma, don't you think it a shame to be going around the streets with such looking duds?"

I fear the influence of such minds may have an evil ascendency over you ; for it is easier to learn evil than good. Are you wil- ling, Cecelia, to learn of me?" continued Mrs. Grey. "Certainly, mamma?" replied Cecelia. "I am confident I shall never be sorry for obeying so good- a parent." "Ha I ha I little plotter-plotting against me?" exclaimed Mr. Grey, coming in; "then you have but one good parent, eh?" "Oh I yes--papa." "Well then, pay me off with a kiss," replied Mr. Grey. "That will do ; now tell me, do you want to hear from Cousin Edgar?" "Has he come, papa?" inquired Cecelia. "Not him, but his signature," said Mr. Grey. "Signature I what's that? Oh I I know--his name. Mr. Grey laughed, and took from a side pocket a letter, directed to Cecelia Grey. Cecelia eagerly reached for-it; but her father held it at arm's length, claiming another kiss, as pay for bringing it home.- Cecelia unwillingly complied and then ran away with her prize, almost as pleased as Alice or Emily would have been with it. When she returned, Mr. Grey inquired: ,.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       153 "What is it, runaway? does he speak about us?" "Here, here-read. He says he is coming home this week, sure. To-day is Monday ; he will have to go past here, and I am going to sit by the garden wall, so I can see him come home. I will watch every night till he comes ;" and Cecelia ran and took her seat by the garden wall. For some time she watched for the stage, and in the intervening time fancied she should surely see the form of her young cousin within the lum- bering vehicle. But she was doomed to disappointment, for the stage came and no one gave her a glance of recognition. She had been quite sure she should see him, and a smile and a bow would repay her for her impatient watching.  Then how she would exult in being the first to see him, on his return, and assure Alice and Emily she secured the first glance-the first token of regard. Filled with such thoughts, it is no won- der she was disappointed and half angry as she slowly retraced her steps to the house. She soon retired to her sleeping-room, where she watched the soft shades of evening gather around her, until a silvery light fell upon each object. The running water, the shadowy forest, each wore the same soft radiance. Soon the house was hushed in silence; no one but herself was awake within, and the only sound without was the distant tinkling of the sheep bell-or the deep baying of the watch-dog.  A   trembling desire came over her to steal softly from the house, and out into the night air, to wander in the little grove. Noiselessly she descended the stairs, and passed by the little sleeping-room of her parents, when loosing the rope from Tiger's neck, she bade him come with her.  The old dog, noiselessly as his young mistress, followed her. Starting at every sound, but continuing on, Cecelia soon en- tered the shade of lofty trees, and for a time stood wrapped in awe and admiration at the silent, yet expressive view that met her enraptured gaze. The soft rays of the moon here and there pierced through the sylvan shade, just giving a dim out.  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7463-00000080"/> 154      (OECERT TA GREY; OR, THE line of the objects around her. Suddenly she started, as a   rich, manly voice broke forth in a strain of surpassing sweet-  ness. Enraptured she listened, until the unknown had finished his song, and his footsteps had died away in the distance.  Then the cold chill of evening came over her, and the forest looked so lonely that she hastened to the house-thoughtful and with a new charm for life. Unconsciously, loftier aims had i taken possession of her soul, and to be good-to be noble as  the stranger she had heard-became the leading object of her life through future years. Little did the youth know the good influence he had worked upon the mind of one who would in time become linked to him, by the most endearing, the holiest of ties. It was long after Cecelia's cheek had pressed her pillow, that her eyes closed in slumber. Then the voice of the j unknown warbled in her ear strains of the most enchanting melody. Often in future years was her sleep visited by that deep, thrilling voice. Through the next day, Cecelia!ad another object in view than to watch for her cousin Edgar, although she took her seat as before, upon the wall. The hour went not so slowly away, and the disappointment was not so deep, when she saw the stage rattling along with none in it but strangers. The ensuing day, Cecelia was restless and nervous, appear- ing to think the hours unusually long, and declaring the day seemed like a week. Mrs. Grey felt alarmed for her health, and would not allow her to sit on the garden wall, to watch for Edgar, and to sat- isfy her she took a seat there herself. After, the stage passed, Mrs. Grey returned to the house, and found Cecelia where she had left her, watching the minute hand of the clock as it moved slowly along. "He has not come, Cecelia," said Mrs. Grey. "Well!" returned Cecelia, i"I am glad."', This mystified Mrs. Grey. Why was she glad, who had watched so long and anxiously for Edgar? It was strange I   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       155 Something unusual had happened to Cecelia, she was sure, and she resolved to watch her, without exciting her suspicion. As it began to grow dark, she saw an unusual degree of satisfac- tion steal over Oecelia's speaking face. When going to her chamber, she wrapped a shawl around her, and when Mrs. Grey inquired if she was cold, she stammered, blushed, and replied, "No Hgood night, mamma-good night, papa," and the door closed behind her. "What has come over Cecelia?" inquired Mr. Grey. "She used to be so fond of having you go up stairs with her." "I don't know," replied Alice; "something unusual, I fear. I shall extinguish the light, and sit where I can watch her. She was very unwilling to have me remain in her room  last evening, and evidently feared I would follow her to-night." Half an hour elapsed in perfect stillness, when they heard Cecelia leave her apartment, and descend the stairs. Half wild with fear, Mr. Grey hastened to dress, and in a moment more he stood with Mrs. Grey in the shadow  of some low bushes which hid the rear door from view. Soon the door opened softly, and Cecelia stepping out, closed it, and unfastening the dog, exclaimed: "Silence,! Tiger-behave yourself, and don't make any noise, and perhaps you will hear that enchanting voice again." Mrs. Grey began to fear for Cecelia's reason, but her husband reassured her, and they followed her steps. Soon she reached the grove, and entering the sylvan shade, looked cautiously around her. She then silently made the dog lie down at her feet, and reclined against a tree, with her ear upturned, in the attitude of one listening. Suddenly she started, and came towards her father and mother. They silently awaited her approach, when, coming directly to them, she exclaimed: "What   I mamma-papa-come out to worship here? But no, it was not you, never-never I It could not be I  Papa, do you ever sing in the open air?"          t'  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7463-00000081"/> 1S6       OEOELIA GREY; OR, THE "Sometimes," replied Mr. Grey. "Have you ever heard any one sing in the grove, Cecelia?"            C "Yes, papa," replied Cecelia.  "When?"  "Night before last," said Cecelia, I took an idea it would  be nice to see the grove by the bright moonlight, and I was admiring its grandeur, when the most enchanting voice in the world sang the words :                   I ' All nature's charms around me rise.' I cannot recall the rest." "Do you know who it was?"1 asked Mr. Grey. "No, papa ; but it was a youthful voice-so sweet and touching." "Did he speak to you?" continued Mr. Grey. "Oh, no Hhe did not see me at all"; I stayed with Tiger till he went away. I was in hopes that he would come again to- night." "Cecelia," replied Mr. Grey, " you are doing very wrong to come out here alone, to watch this unknown person. The first time it was unintentional,- and I hope you will never undertake to do the like again. If you desire to visit the grove, speak to your mother'; and if it is proper for you to do so, one of us will come with you here. Now we must go home'; your mother should not be deprived of her rest."       ! Cecelia said she did not mean to keep her mother awake ; she thought she was asleep. Mrs. Grey looked reproachfully at her, and the meaning glance was truthfully interpreted. The next day, Cecelia was cheerful and contented ; learning her lessons in a very satisfactory manner. - Towards night, she again took her seat upon the garden wall, to watch for Edgar. This time she was not disappointed. Edgar had no sooner espied Cecelia, than he bid the coach- man let him down; and taking his baggage from the box, he   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.-       lo was soon beside her, shaking her little hand in a very brotherly manner. Cecelia led him to the house, where he received a warm welcome from his uncle and aunt. As it began to grow dusk, he said he could stay no longer- he must see his mother and sisters that night. Mr. Grey proposed taking him over in his carriage, and Edgar requested his aunt and Cecelia to go with them Mrs. Grey. and Cecelia were soon ready, and after a short drive, the , party arrived at Mrs. Lee's. When the first expressions of joy at the happy reunion had passed, 'Edgar unstrapped his trunk, and distributed his pre- sents. There were silk and mering, lawn and muslin, for Alice ; mering and delaine for Emily and Mrs. Lee; and shawls for each, that had been sent to them by Mrs. Edgar Lee, with whom Edgar lived. Edgar had also brought his mother groceries, and other necessaries for her comfort. For Alice and Emily he had nice bonnets, and for Cecelia a bunch of flowers in a china vase with the words, " remember me," marked- upon it. "You see, sisters," he said, "I strove to get the most useful articles for you, and a keepsake for Cecelia. I was afraid she might forget me, if she had nothing to remember me by." "Forget you, Edgar--impossible 1" exclaimed Cecelia. "I do not need anything to keep you in remembrance." "I am going to school with sister Alice," said Edgar. "Uncle Edgar will take no  denial. iHe said his brother's children should be educated, and take their places in society from which they were unjustly expelled. Indeed I I have been to school two-thirds of the time since I left home. Uncle told me, my wages should be the same. He wished me to work just as hard in studying, as if under his eye in the counting-house. The teacher told uncle I had graduated, and must go up higher. It was a  happy moment to me, when Uncle Edgar expressed his surprise and pleasure. I told him he did not know what an excellent instructor my mother had been ; how many hours she ,        \   &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7463-00000082"/> 158       CErET TA, GREY; OR, THE passed in explatng hard sentences to me, and in persuading me to learn my book." Mrs. Grey now proposed returning horde, exacting a promise from her sister that she would come and pass a few days with them, and that Edgar should come after the carriage and take them over. Anxiously did Cecelia pass the next three days; studying hard to pass the time away, which she thought unusually long, for she desired the society of her aunt and cousins. On the evening of the third day, Edgar came over to stay until the next morning, and then returned to his mother and sisters, who were to pass the week with them. Mrs., Grey gave Cecelia a basket of provisions, with instruc- tions to carry it over to the widow Malcom's. Alice, Edgar - and Emily, volunteered to go with her, and they set out. Edgar with the basket, Cecelia with a bottle of wine, and Alice with a tureen of warm broth for the invalid, while Emily amused herself, and them, with plucking dandelions and filling Edgar's wavy hair with the bright blossoms. As they neared the house, they became thoughtful and silent. The thought -of the suffer- ing invalid within, made them still, and they stepped softly into the little porch, when Edgar placed his finger upon his lips in token of silence. Involuntarily each listened, Cecelia with intense interest. She heard the same voice, whose notes had charmed her ear while- walking in the grove. After talking with the sick woman a few moments, they heard him leave the room. Edgar then stepped in, and placed the basket upon the table, saying Mrs. Grey desired to know how she was?   Mrs. Malcom replied, "Thank you, I feel no better than when she left me; but am very thankful to Mrs. Grey for her kindness to me. I shall not long stay to receive attentions from her tender hand. It matters not how soon I am called; she has my blessings. It is all the recompense I can leave her. May she find as true   'VICISSITUDES OF 'FORTUNE.      159 hearts to cluster around her dying bed, and maklthe moments sweet."  Edgar had never before visited the room of the departing Christian, and her calm resignation astonished and affected him almost to tears-it was with an effort he could control him- self; and he felt a relief when he saw Alice arise to go. Mrs. Malcom bade them good bye, expressing the hope that they would be as ready, as willing to go, when they were called to leave this world, as they had found her. She said, "to live is pleasant, but to die is gain." For many days did the dying words of Mrs. Malcom  haunt the mind of Edgar Lee.  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7463-00000083"/> 160       COCELA GREY; OR, THE CHAPTER XIV. MRS. GREY was not surprised, the ensuing morning, to be called to visit'the house of Mrs. Malcom, to perform the last sad rites for her departed friend.-Mrs. Lee undertook to do the work at home during her absence, while Edgar gave Cecelia and Alice lessons in drawing, an art in which he had become proficient. Cecelia learned rapidly, while Alice had hard work to fix her attention upon the growing blossom his pencil traced. Books were her delight, and easily she solved the mysteries in them hidden. She had no fancy for the lighter accomplishments, and only wished to learn them as a necessity she could not avoid. False pride had no place in her heart ; but firm principles of honor and of duty. Cecelia looked up to Alice as a pattern she might safely copy from; while Emily was a jewel loved for its rich setting, but valueless except as an ornamtent. Thus, each of the sisters held a place in Cecelia's heart, and very dear they were, and essen- tial to her happiness; for while one instructed, the other diverted her youthful mind. Had they been her own sisters she could hardly have been more attached to them. Edgar had spent so many years of his young life there, that it is not to be wondered that he regarded Mr. and Mrs. Grey with almost filial affection. When Mrs. Grey returned from her sad task, she informed Mr. Grey that it would be necessary for some one to give lMrs. Malcom's grand-daughter, Mary, a temporary home until a   VI(ISSITUDhES OF FORTUNE.      1i permanent one could be found for her ; and as ie had no rela- tives, Mrs. Grey thought it would be proper :'him to take charge of her, until a suitable home could be provided. Mr. Grey was silent a moment, and then said, " he did not know as he could: do better by her, than to take her himself; she would be a desirable assistant to Mrs. Grey, and under her tuition would soon become a proficient scholar." Mrs. Grey consented, on condition he would take a boy to assist him. This arrangement made, Mr. Grey began searching in his mind to find a proper child to fill the place of an assistant. At last, the quick mind of his wife suggested the propriety of taking a child from the Orphan Asylum; one that had been put there for a temporary home, and had none of the advanta- ges of the other orphans, being only placed there to keep him from suffering and starvation. "What?" exclaimed Mr. Grey, " that ragged, dirty, Irish child, that no one can understand or endure?" "If he is so unpleasant to you," replied Mrs. Grey, "I would look up -some one else; but I  really pity the child. In a foreign land-without friends or home, despised and hated, for what, I know not. I have heard him described as a faithful, honest boy ; and as far as acquainted with our language, quick to understand."  "How old is he?" inquired Mr. Grey. Alice replied, " fifteen." "Fifteen, eh?"  repeated Mr. Grey, in a  musing tone; "well, we will try them both. I can at least learn him his duty." The ensuing day, Mrs. Grey, Mrs. Lee, and their children, attended the funeral of Mrs. Malcom, and on their return brought Mary with them. Mary Malcom retired to the room Mrs. Grey had prepared for her, and from which Cecelia's opened ; there to weep alone, the loss of her only relative and, as she then thought, friend. Mrs. Grey did not  allow any one to disturb her that day,  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7463-00000084"/> 162       OCECL. GREY; OR, THE until the hourl tea. When she entered the chamber of the child, Mary lay across the foot of the bed, sobbing as if her heart would break. Mrs. Grey took her hand in hers kindly, saying: ". Do you wish your grandmother back here, to suffer and die, Mary?" "Oh I no, ma'm," replied Mary, ' not to suffer and die, but to live; so I could-live with her." "But your grandmother was old," continued Mrs. Grey, "and could not live here long. She suffered much from various causes, and she is now gone home, where she will meet the dear friends that have gone before her. Do you not think it selfish to desire her back in this world, so cold and lonesome to her? To be sure, she loved you, but you could not make her forget her husband and her children." "I don't know," Mary answered, drying her tears ; "it is not wrong for me to weep." "It is not wrong for you to mourn, Mary," replied Mrs. Grey, " you cannot help doing so. But you should endeavor not to' exhaust yourself and become sick. You know I will take you, and if you are faithful in the discharge of your duties, I will as far as possible make your situation pleasant. If you will improve your mind, I will myself become your instruc- tor." Mary said she would try to do as Mrs. Grey desired, and she did not wish for a better place than they offered her. Mrs. Grey then told her to bathe her face, smooth her hair, and try to compose herself; then come down and take tea with them. Mary complied more cheerfully than Mrs. Grey had expected, seeming pleased with a seat beside Cecelia. After tea, she offered to bear away the dishes, and tidy the room. I Mrs. Grey was surprised at her efforts to forget her loss, and her willingness to become useful to her. The next day, Mr. Grey's young assistant was brought home, and duly bound by the authorities to him. He was thick set,   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       163 with bright blue eyes and light curly hair, wh lh was then a knot of snarls, and freckled rosy cheeks, with clothes which hung in tatters around his bare feet. Mrs. Grey had cloth ready, and with the assistance of a couple of sewing girls, she soon had a suit of good clothes for him. After cutting and combing his hair, and washing his face and hands, they had him arrayed in them: and Mr. Grey was much gratified to find him a bright, intelligent, good-look- ing child. He found him   of so much assistance, that his absence would have been considered an irreparable loss. As for Mary Malcom, it was her chief delight to teach him the English language, which, under her tuition, he soon spoke quite intelligibly. Edgar declared there was nothing so amusing as to hide behind the kitchen door, and hear Mary repeat sentence after sentence of the English language, which Patrick McFar- land faithfully pronounced, word for word; and to hear her teach him the alphabet, which he tried hard to remember, but found it impossible.  The ensuing day Mr. and   Mrs. Grey set out to visit the scenes of their early years. For some time they walked on'in silence, when coming to the little spring by which Mary Cler- m ont had sat with her betrothed husband, on the eve of their marriage, she took a seat in the same spot she then occupied with William Lee. For a moment she folded her hands as if in silent prayer; then, with a wild burst of grief, she recited the conversation held there between them, and bewailed the follies of the past. "Here," she exclaimed, as if addressing her departed hus- and, " here did you warn me ; but I heeded you not. I threw fromme the love of your true and noble heart and took in its place the admiration of a false, deceitful world, wronged you, and fancied myself wronged, because you did not comply with every whim  of my exacting spirit. I sought happiness from your side, and found disappointment and misery. I promised to love and cherish you, and then drove the dagger to your  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7463-00000085"/> 164        ECELIA GREY; OR, THE heart. Your dying groans embittered every moment of my future life; -frewell-dear deserted one; thy forgiveness was thy dying blessing; thy memory I will cherish through life, and in death I will hope to meet thee." Mrs. Grey stood a silent spectator of her sister's grief, and when she saw it had somewhat subsided, she took her passive hand within her own, saying: "Mary, it is useless for you to indulge in idle regrets. To repent and reform is all that is left you. You can in no way repay your departed husband for your indiscretions but by a watchful care over his children. They need your counsels. Look not upon the past, but as a warning for the future. Let your footsteps go down to the, grave in quiet submission to the will of Providence, so that you may leave to your children an example of resignation under trial--counting them as mercies sent to-save you from a life of unhappiness here, and misery in the life to come." Mrs. Lee listened attentively to her sister's admonitions, and replied : "Your counsels are always right, Alice. If I had only fol- lowed them when so kindly given, I might have been at this time a happy woman. As you-say, regrets are vain, except as a warning, to avoid the shoals and quicksands which have wrecked us in the voyage of life. I am determined from this time to live as I am sure William would have wished me to, if he had expressed a desire for the future. His children were very dear to him, and I have no right to indulge in selfish grief, when activity is called for. Henceforth I will devote my whole life, so far as it is right and lawful, for their welfare, withholding from them no advantage I can procure for them." "It would not be right," replied Mrs. Grey, "to seek for worldly advantages for them, to the exclusion of heavenly ones; but rather the exclusion of worldly advantages, to secure for them a crown of eternal life." "Yes, yes, returned Mrs. Lee, " such wealth will be the best  VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       165 legacy I can leave them; it will be my study to lead their youthful minds in the straight and narrow path, along whose sides deep ravines lay hidden by the most enchanting scenery, and the most beautiful flowers, which, if they but stoop to pluck, swill plunge them into the raging gulf beneath, from which the dark and foaming waters go dashing down--down to everlasting death." Mrs. Lee shuddered as she repeated these words, and drawing her sister's arm through her own, she hastened homeward. Mrs. Grey had left no orders for tea, and was surprised when Cecelia and Emily led them to the table, nicely covered and spread with the usual fare she had been in the habit of provid- ing. "Who has done this?" she inquired of Cecelia. At this moment Mary Malcom began to tremble, and Cecelia replied- "Your new housekeeper, Mary Malcom. She asked what time you generally got tea, and what you prepared, and then went to work and prepared supper against your return " Mrs. Grey thanked Mary for being so thoughtful of her com- fort, and Mary was at once reassured.  The ensuing day Edgar planned a sail upon the lake. Mrs. Grey and Mrs. Lee consented to accompany him, and Cecelia and her cousins were in high spirits, and Edgar had hard work to keep them quiet until the time to start. After reaching the path which led through the woods to the lake, Edgar left the horses, and they started on foot through the forest. Mrs. Grey, pleased with the liberty which she -enjoyed in leaving some one at home, entered into the sports of her young companions with a lively interest; and Mrs. Lee, for the first time since her hus- band's death, related anecdote and jest with something of her old enjoyment. In a short time they were- all seated in the lit- tle boat, and gliding over the smooth water. After rowing about until fatigued, Edgar put his little boat into a nook or cove between the rocks, where the water was still, and Mrs. &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7463-00000086"/> 166       CEOTQLTA GREY; OR, THE Grey produced her luncheon of pie, sandwiches, and cakes, with home-brewed beer. After resting awhile, they stepped ashore, and gathered a few wild flowers and evergreens, and then recrossed the lake, and returned home. Just as they stepped from   the boat, Cecelia heard the voice of the unknown, as he exclaimed : - Be still, Carlo HCarlo, behave I Come with me," accom- panied by the low whine of a dog, and the cracking of the underbrush beneath their feet. "A savage, that beast is," observed Edgar ; "I have had the pleasure of a sight of him before. That young fellow keeps him pretty close; I guess his father has appointed him his guardian." -Cecelia was angry, and not knowing why, replied : "I guess the young gentleman is capable of taking care of himself." "Well, then don't get angry. I did not know you had the pleasure of his acquaintance. I have heard he is a stranger, sent here to study with your old minister. I beg your most humble pardon, my little queen." "Cecelia, you know nothing of this person ; children should be less forward in their remarks," observed Mrs. Grey. Cecelia blushed crimson; still she knew not why she should take an interest in the defence of a person she never saw. An unseen influence seemed working upon her mind, in favor of the stranger. -She was surte he must be noble and good, since she had overheard his devotions in the grove. Then, might she not be mistaken in the voice? She felt sure she was not, yet she was pained and embarrassed ; and after receiving her mother's reproof, she could scarcely raise her eyes to her cousin's face, to answer the last inquiry. Upon Mrs. Grey's mentioning the occurrence to her husband, he replied, "I should fear for Cecelia's peace of mind, were she five or six years older. As it is, I think it a mere childish fancy, which if let alone will soon be forgotten.    v VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      167 Mrs. Grey gave no more thought to the stranger, busying herself in educating and training Cecelia's mind, to fill a useful place in the society she would soon be called to embel- lish. It was Mrs. Grey's intention to educate her until she reached her sixteenth year, when they would send her away, to learn the lighter accomplishments, such as embroidery, music, and painting. When Mrs. Lee returned home, Cecelia accompanied them for Edgar wished to have them all together during the remain- der of his visit. Mrs. Lee felt sad at the thought of Alice leaving her, but knowing it was for the best, she offered no objection, giving her such advice as would be of service to her when away, and preparing everything she deemed necessary for her during her absence. Alice, too disliked to'leave her mother and sister, but she had determined to become useful to them in future years. Emily said she did not care particularly. To be sure she would feel lonesome, but then Alice  would come back so much improved, it was worth the sacrifice. Alice gave her a faint smile, with " you must make mamma happy during my absence, sisterdear." "No, I  am entirely incompetent to do that; or for that part, you either," replied Emily.  "Mamma is never happy, are you   mamma?" , Mrs. Lee made no reply, but bent her head over her work without any visible' agitation, although the weight pressed heavily to her heart. Her children knew not the struggle that convulsed her every nerve, and made her temples throb with pain. Edgar was to stay until after the celebration of our nation's Independence, and on the morning of the fourth he went with Xhis sisters and Cecelia to enjoy the pleasures of the day. The next mornidg Edgar was up early, and had his trunks  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7463-00000087"/> 168       CEFc T^A GREY; OR, THE packed, and with Alice's, carried to the porch. Then he awoke his mother and Alice.              - Mrs. Lee prepared breakfast, while Alice made herself ready to join her brother in the journey. Mrs. Lee could not take a mouthful of food, but urged Alice to eat heartily before she started in the stage. Edgar told his mother to give herself no uneasiness on Alice's account, he would take every possible care of her. Mrs. Lee placed her hand upon his brow, saying, "Will you promise to take just as good care of Edgar?" "Yes, mamma, uncle has given me much advice, as well as an insight into many of the intrigues of college life, so that I shall not be very likely to ruin myself, either at the card table, or the sideboard of my brother students. Alice will not be more than a mile from me, and I shall walk down and see her every day. It will be a healthy exercise. By the way, there is a Mary L. de Manuel, I think it is, stayed at the school three months last season; she is a most lovely girl, and visited at uncle Lee's. She is about the age of Emily. I don't know her parents-they were going west with a bridal, party. I understand she said she was my mother's namesake." Mrs. Lee explained to Edgar the history of Birdella. She said she must write Mrs. de Manuel; she had in her sorrow unjustly neglected to do so; and Birda had ever been faithful in writing to her. The stage stopped before the door of Mrs. Lee's dwelling, and Edgar put up their baggage, and handed Alice within, then turned to give the parting kiss. Mrs. Lee could not con- trol her feelings ; she sobbed as loud as did Alice within the coach. Edgar did not trust his voice, as he took the parting hand of each, but turning resolutely away took his seat beside his sister, in the stage. After they had gone, Mrs. Lee thought of her neglect of her little protege, ag she ever called Mrs. de Manuel. Procuring writing materials, she was soon absorbed in questions and replies to her absent friend.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       169 Mrs. Lee received an answer to her letter sooner than she had anticipated. Birda wrote of her pleasure to hear from her dear friend, of her health, and lastly of her opinion of the sooty blacks. "Dear Mary," she wrote, "I was so surprised at the situa- tion of the slave, which I had so often heard exaggerated at the North, that I almost trembled at making a plantation my home, with over five hundred blacks, young and old. Could you for a moment, enter the neat cool cabins of our slaves, and turn to my wretched life with Mrs. Bixbee, you would think there was as much to correct at the North, as at the South, and would really pity the poor negro that was obliged to exchange situations, and leave his kind master at the south, for northern coldness and disdain. Could you observe the attachment of the master for his slave, and of the slave for his master, you would say they were happier than many in your land of north- ern freedom.

The charms of life are flying--fast; My toys almost forgot, I do not mourn to find them past, I seek a happier lot. Another year or two and then I'll bid my friends adieu; And happier-happier than I ken, I shall return to you. CECELIA^S fifteenth birth-day was one of unusual interest to her. In this year she was to complete her home studies. It is not to be wondered that her former recreations seemed dull and insipid, in comparison with- those which she was so soon to enjoy. Day after day, week after week, she devoted inces- santly- to the cultivation of her mind. - She wished to learn perfect all the most necessary branches of education. Mrs. Grey-was at last alarmed by her incessant exertions, and planned many diversions to draw her from her books, but all without the desired effect. As a last resort, she sent for Emily Lee, whose natural indolence of disposition could not endure even the semblance of exertion, in any other than the lightest accomplishments. In those she excelled either Alice or Cecelia ; yet it was no exertion for her, but only the pecu- liar talent with which she was endowed. It was plain to Mrs. Lee, that Emily was formed to create a sensation in society, which Alice or Cecelia, with all their   VICISSAITUDES OF FORTUNE.       171 goodness, never could. On learning this, Mrs. Lee trembled for Emily, especially as each warning admonition fell unheeded upon her ear. Cecelia was greatly annoyed when her mother informed her that her aunt Mary, with Emily, was coming to pass a few weeks with them ; and she wished her to amuse her volatile cousin as much as possible. On the ensuing day Mrs. Grey gave Mary Malcom directions to prepare another room for the accommodation of Mrs. Lee and Emily during their stay with her. Cecelia placed all her books in her desk, and with a sigh of regret turned the key upon them, so as to be in readiness to take lessons in embroid- ery, in which art Mrs. Lee and Emily excelled, and she thought it would be an amusement to Emily to teach her, as well as an advantage to herself.  The next morning, after arranging and rearranging' each  article in Mrs. Lee's apartments, she went down-stairs to await their coming, Patrick having set-out some time before to bring them. Upon their arrival, Emily had much to relate to Cecelia, concerning her life in the city, where Mrs. Lee had spent some months in the family of her brother-in-law, Edgar Lee, nurs- ing Mrs. Lee through  her last illness; and after her death, she returned home, much against Mr. Lee's wishes, or those of his children. Mrs. Lee had begged her to remain with them after her decease, as the only one to whom she could in confi- dence intrust her dear children. But she thought it not right to continue there, when Mr. Lee had a widowed sister, Mrs. Dunbar, every way competent to fill a mother's place in the hearts of his children. Emily had much news of importance to Cecelia's susceptive mind. Each object wore a new interest when rehearsed by Emily, and before one week had passed away, Cecelia had forgotten her books, and lived only in visionary dreams  of the future. Life had acquired a new charm for her; her noble' resolves were, for the time, oblite-  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7463-00000089"/> 172       CECELIA GREY; OR, THEI: rated, and her mother was often pained to see her petulant and exacting to a degree almost unendurable. Mrs. Grey could discover no reason for this new fancy of Cecelia, and feared it would poison all the future of her life. One fine evening, as Cecelia sat by the window, absorbed in the idea of dress, fashion or folly, Mr. Grey requested her to walk over to- a neighbor's with him, as her mother was engaged. Cecelia replied petulantly: "Must I forever be a substitute in case of necessity? I should think you could go alone." Once or twice before Mr. Grey had been shocked by a light answer, and left her half in anger, at what he termed her childish whims. But he now saw that forbearance on his part ceased to be a virtue, and with a stern look he bade her pre- pare to accompany him. Cecelia put her bonnet half on, and throwing a shawl slov- enly around her, declared herself at his service. Mr. Grey bade her prepare herself more decently. This Cecelia did with pouting lips. Mr. Grey led Cecelia out, saying: "Cecelia I suppose for an instant," pointing upward, " that silvern orb should so far get entangled in imaginary affairs, as to forget to enliven our dark earth with its cheerful rays; how much unhappiness would its forgetfulness occasion? how many would miss its light? The feeble illumination of the stars would only make us miss the more the presence of our most expected guide, and we should wander on surmising why we were doomed to almost perpetual darkness. We should hardly thank the little star, which faithfully follows its given course, bestowing all its light for our happiness I So it is with your parents. You are their joy, their light ; they bask in the sunshine of your love. Shall I tell you that your regard for us has grown dim?  That you have so far got entangled in visionary affairs, as to forget to do your duty towards us?*   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      173 Paining us by your disobedience, or treating our wishes with disdain, and never complying with them unless from compul- sion. Little did I think Cecelia, my loved and cherished child, would so far forget what she owed to her parents, as to pur- posely, willfully distress us. Let me hope your mother will no more mourn the lack of common courtesy she has a right to expect from you. For myself, if Cecelia has become so selfish as to nourish idle dreams, in place of making her father's home cheerful and happy, let her presence henceforth cease to annoy him. Let the silence of your chamber become the re- cipient of your dreams, the foundation of your hopes." Then dropping her hand, he pointed towards home, and hastened away from her. Cecelia followed him a few steps, then reluctantly turned back. She was not angry, neither could she reproach her father. She saw and felt too keenly the truth of his remarks. Shame and regret, mingled with the fear that she had forfeited the love of her affectionate parent, kept her silent. Then the resolves she had broken arose before her; the grove, with its unknown occupant, and his holy aspirations again found a place in her heart, and with bitter anguish, she mourned her depar- ture from the path of rectitude. With the tall grass waving around her, she besought heaven to lend its sustaining power, that she might fulfill her vows. She had scarcely completed   her petition ere the voice of the unknown addressed her thus: "Young lady, take no thought of the morrow, no further than necessity-calls upon you to. Avoid anticipation of future happiness here but do your duty faithfully. As each day arises upon the wheels of time, let it find you firm, cheerful and con- fiding in the help of one whom you have just petitioned as your strength and your guide. Beware you do not forget that you have a duty to do. If you would be kept from sin, you must exert that firmness and resolution which you are possessed of If you only put forth that strength, you shall not fail in fulfilling those lofty, noble vows."  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7463-00000090"/> 174       OECELIA GREY; OR, THE Cecelia listened almost breathlessly, with straining eyes, en- deavoring to discern the whereabouts of the speaker. Soon she saw him, at a short distance, standing under the shade of  a low tree with his eyes bent upon her. From his situation she could only discern a dim outline of his figure, yet his words left an indelible stamp upon her heart. Pensively musing, Cecelia entered the sitting-room, where her mother was engaged in reading, for the amusement of Mrs. Lee, who had been quite unwell and unusually nervous for a few days past. "Where is your papa, Cecelia?" inquired Mrs. Grey, looking up sadly, as if expecting a petulant reply. "Oh!" replied Cecelia, "I have been such a selfish, naughty  child, he sent me home alone. You will forgive me, mamma, will you not, if I only do better for the future " " "Certainly," replied Mrs. Grey, returning a kiss Cecelia pressed upon her forehead. Sooner than they had expected, Mr. Grey returned home,  and his eyes sought with troubled interest the face of his   l daughter. Cecelia sprang timidly forward, saying: "Papa, I will be a good child, and you will forget I have ever been so naughty."  "Well, Cecelia, I will try this once," said Mr. Grey, as he drew his arm-chair to a more convenient place.  The ensuing day Cecelia wag very careful not to relapse into her former habits, which had so nearly destroyed the even  temper of her mind, which her mother had so long and carefully cultivated. Emily's tales of city life fell upon cold and heedless ears. Cecelia was determined firmly to meet every object which would entice her from the correct path of  duty, which she had resolved to keep, both in thought and in deed. She listened as one asleep to a list of the rich furniture, elegant statuary, and tasty pictures, which Emily described, as adorning her uncle's residence. Emily wondered at Cecelia's indifference, which she finally   VICISSlTUDES OF FORTUIJN.      175 concluded could proceed from no other cause than envy, and consequently she made it the principal theme of her conver- sation for several succeeding weeks. *    *   *    *   *    *   * Some two months after Mrs. Lee had made it her home with them, she received a letter from her brother-in-law, Edgar Lee, desiring her to come and nurse his daughter, who was taken down with the fever, and would allow no one to come near her; but was constantly urging him to bring her aunt Mary to stay with her. This invitation Mrs. Lee thought proper to accept, not only for the child's sake, but for the kindness of her deceased sister- in-law, who had ever treated her with affectionate regard, and begged her to live with them, and take care of her children. It was arranged, much to Emily's chagrin, that she should remain with Mrs. Grey,-until her mother returned home. After Mrs. Lee left, it became Cecelia's duty to entertain Emily; but this to Cecelia was a serious task, for Emily was determimed not to be pleased with anything around her. If Cecilia was gay, it gave her the headache; if grave, the dumps. In this manner Emily kept Cecelia in a constant worry. When awake, it was one unceasing complaint; all because Emily was not allowed to go to the city with her mother. Mrs. Lee often wrote to Emily, and always cautioned her to be a good girl; and Emily as often tore her letters into frag- ments, declaring she did not wish for her advice.; she had enough of it when with her. If she could not write for her to come to her uncle's, she did not want her to write at all. She should not take the trouble to answer them, until her mother knew better than to leave her in such a country hole as that was. She wished her papa had lived, she would not have been doomed to such annoyances. In vain and idle dreams of the future, Emily would sit for hours, only disturbed by the artless simplicity and sweet beauty of her cousin.  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7463-00000091"/> 176       CECELIA GREY; ORB, THE "But she will never come between me and fortune," she would soliloquize ; " she is not half brilliant enough. If she only wore Alice's dignified beauty, she would not be half as attractive. But the sweet simplicity of her expression, mingled with such native grace, makes- her more than charming to a casual observer." Poor Emily I she knew not the struggle between right and wrong inclinations in the heart of Cecelia. She had never listened to the little monitor, which whispered, "Emily, it is not right to waste your time thus ; riches cannot bring hap- piness-you will never be happy unless deserving." To the voice of conscience she had never listened, longer than to reproach herself for such weakness.            While Emily indulged envy and dissimulation, Cecelia was struggling to plant good seeds in her heart. If she, for an  instant, found reflection springing up in her mind, as to a life of  future pleasure, she involuntarily exclaimed:  "I am in thy hands, O Lord 1 keep me in the path in which thou would have me go. Let me give no thought for the future, only beware that I spend the present time in a manner acceptable in thy sight. Let a life of usefulness be  mine. Let my days be well spent, let me become a blessing to my father, and an honor to my mother; let no one have reason to reproach me, or to hate me."  With such thoughts as these she applied herself to the tasks her mother set for her. Cecelia was rapidly advancing in her education, under her mother's tuition. Vacation was to bring Alice and Edgar to Mrs. Grey's for three whole weeks, as Alice playfully wrote to Cecelia. They did not like, as usual, to trouble their uncle Lee with their presence. They thought his daughter's illness sufficient excuse for them to refuse to pass their vacation with him. Indeed, it would have been very imprudent for them to excite her, by their arrival in her extreme weakness. So it was settled that Alice and Edgar should see their dear sister   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       1" and Codsin Cecelia, who was to return to the seminary with them. Emily was full of anticipation of the pleasant surprise she should give her brother and sister, being no longer the mere child she was when they last saw her. If she could only return to the seminary with them, she should be happy, and she resolved to write to her uncle Edgar, to allow her the same privilege that Edgar and Alice enjoyed. But shame for her deficiencies kept her silent. Mr. Grey knew his niece's wishes--he read them in her sad look, whenever Cecelia's departure was mentioned; and deter- mined, if it was her desire, she should be gratified, for he thought at least it could be no disadvantage to her. He therefore purchased the same articles for Emily as were pre- pared for his own child, with this disadvantage, that they were' obliged to hire the work done for Emily, which Cecelia was competent to do for herself. This to Emily was no source of regret. She congratulated herself on being unacquainted with such coarse work. One dark stormy evening, while Cecelia and Emily sat listen- ing to the howling of the storm, instead of the wheels of the carriage, they so long had expected, the door was suddenly thrown open, and Edgar Lee, with his sister leaning on one arm, and a tall elegant young lady upon the other, was ushered into the room by Patrick. Cecelia, with her natural grace of manner, arose to welcome them ; while Emily, with a gesture of extreme surprise, - for- mally kissed the cheek of her sister, and in an affected air, courtesied to the lady presented -by her brother. In a moment more, her fine feelings were outraged by her brother exclaim- ing : "Sis I how   you have grown-almost as tall as Alice. Mary," he continued, turning to the lady who had accompanied them, "I have often described to you my little vivacious, vex- 8*  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7463-00000092"/> 178       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE H atious sister, but I had no idea she had become an attractive and beautiful woman. How old are you, puss?" pulling her ear. "When my brother becomes conscious of the respect due his sister, I will reply to his query," she answered haughtily. Edgar looked half angry, but with a smile, inquired of Cecelia, "How old are you, cousin? You have grown entirely out, of my memory."  "Four years younger than my cousin Edgar," Cecelia re- plied. "Ah I yes, sixteen; I am twenty, Mary; and my dear sister Alice just two years younger. The next term you graduate, and return to the South. And I, poor I, what am I to do? Alice and yourself gone, with no one to console me for the loss of your good advice and gentle influence." "If our influence is lost with our absence, it is worthless," replied Mary L. De Manuel. "And so this is the home of my mother's earliest love. Here she found rest, friends, and hap- piness. Oh I we can never repay your mother and her friends the many kindnesses she received from them. This has been the day dream of my life, to stand beneath the same roof that sheltered my mother from suffering, and from want." Turning to Mrs. Grey, she exclaimed, "To you she owes all the riches of her mind; all the good- ness of her heart, she tells me; and in her name I thank you. I am here to tell you you have in her a firm friend; and if you ever need her assistance in any way, her life, wealth and happiness are all at your disposal." Mrs. Grey said, Mrs. De Manuel owed nothing to her. She had as much reason to claim her thanks, as to be grateful to her. She had been a kind, obliging companion, ever cheerful, whose presence had been a solace through many a weary trial, and her absence had only made her more dearly prized. Life had not sundered more tender ties. Mary held her hand, and   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       179 Mrs. Grey felt the warm kisses, mingled with the tears upon it. Cecelia had been very busy with the toast, turning and watching it, or placing it in the melted butter which stood ready by her, while Mary Malcom, assisted by Patrick, prg- pared supper. The table, decorated for the fifth time at least, by its young mistress, Cecelia led the way to the dining-room. Mrs. Grey smiled, as her husband whispered a useful lesson for Cecelia; "She will learn not to feel embarrassed. I will watch her." "Pray do not," said Mrs. Grey; "if she saw you, she might appear awkward." Mr. Grey, heedless of his wife's warning, took a seat where he could observe every movement of Cecelia; who instinctively knew that her father's eyes were upon her, and she became embarrassed, and dropped a sauce plate of preserved fruit into her cousin Emily's lap. Emily sprang quickly to her feet and left the table. Edgar arose to follow her, but his sister prevented him by placing her hand upon his arm. Cecelia's eyes filled with tears, as Mrs. Grey hastened to her assistance, and with pleasant smiles, and easy unaffected polite- ness, soon restored good humor among them; after which she went to bring back the truant Emily. As she stopped before the door of the room occupied by Emily, she heard her'denounc- ing Cecelia, for purposely spoiling her spencer, because it was like her own. Gently trying the door, Mrs. Grey found it fastened. Then calling, "Emily, will you let me come in?" She heard her murmur as she turned the key, "It will not always be so; I shall not forever be subject to the intrusion of every one that chooses to force themselves upon me."  Mrs. Grey felt half inclined to leave her to her unpleasant thoughts; but, for the sake of Cecelia, Alice and Edgar, she  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7463-00000093"/> 180       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE undertook to bring her back to the dining-room. This she found no easy task, for no sooner was the door opened, than she was confronted with the sparkling eyes, and firm, proud look of Emily, who seemed ready to meet any argument with cold disdain. Mrs. Grey inquired concerning the extent of injury done her spencer. "Your kindness provided it for me. It's loss is only es- teemed on that account," replied Emily. Mrs. Grey told her Cecelia would willingly bear the loss; she should have hers in exchange. To this proposal Emily offered no reply. Mrs. Grey then requested Emily to go down with her. She only replied, "My company will never be missed by- those so much my superiors in education." "Emily!" exclaimed Mrs. Grey, "you do your brother and sister injustice by your suspicions. You are the pet-the idol of your family; your wish has been their law. Do try and treat them in a sisterly manner; you pain and embarrass Alice with your haughty indifference. Have you no inquiries to make after her health or comfort?" "None to make publicly," returned Emily; "I choose to be left alone until Alice comes to my room. I suppose she will sleep here; if not, let her take her choice." Mrs. Grey stood regarding her for some moments in deep sorrow, then said: "If you have no regard for yourself, or your near relatives, have a little for the feelings of your aunt and uncle; who have done all that lay in their power to make you happy while with them." "If you would make me happy," returned Emily, "you would refuse to keep me here against my will." "Come down," said Mrs. Grey, "and I will promise you, your uncle intends sending you away as soon as Cecelia leaves. Are you satisfied" "   VICiSSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       181 "I am," Emily coldly replied, and returned with the air of a queen to the dining-room. Edgar, forgetting as usual that anything of an unpleasant nature had transpired, caught her in his arms, and placed her in Alice's chair, just as she was about taking possession of it. Alice, smiling, wound her arms round Emily's neck. Emily was not insensible to her sister's love, and answered as tenderly as Alice had spoken. "We shall not be long separated, sister," whispered Alice. I am to graduate soon, and as you do not wish to do so, we shall be united in one home again." "Not here, in this dull place," returned Emily. "You have no idea how I hate it." "Oh I Emily, you must not say so," Alice replied, "you can never be happy, unless you are so now."  "Then I shall never be happy, I assure you," said Emily. "Here! sis," interrupted Edgar, extending upon the tips of his fingers a snowy hat-whose plumes, just tinged with blue, fell like snow flakes around it. Emily sprang to her feet. "Is this for me? Oh, Edgar!" she ejaculated. "Don't say, oh, Edgar!" he replied, "but just put it on- look your prettiest, and tell me how you like it." Emily needed no second bidding, and left the room, to return with her sweetest smiles. "Our pride 1" exclaimed Edgar, turning her round for the inspection of Mary L. De Manuel. Cecelia declared she had never seen her half so lovely, while Alice pressed her to her heart in silence. "Here is my gift, sister," said Alice, handing her a picture of the Four Eras of Life," and a statue of the "Grecian Graces ; "they may not be as acceptable as some others, but they are the most costly I could afford.

She never once reflected that her brother and sister had no other way to pro- cure those articles for her than by denying themselves the necessaries of life. Cecelia, on the contrary, wondered that Emily never men- tioned the inconvenience which must have attended their gifts to her. Had her sister told her that to procure those works of art for -her to gaze upon, she had,worn the self-same hat for two seasons, and- her brother had dispensed with a much-needed cloak, they would not have been dearer in her eyes. Far from that, Alice's gifts were the least prized of any. Although Mary De Manuel was a stranger to her, her gift was folded and refolded at least'a dozen times, and again held up to the window, to catch the first light of, day upon its rich colors. Alice was grieved that Emily took no more notice of her gifts, but would not annoy her by telling how many inconve- niences she had endured, for the sake of procuring them for her. The oil painting was one of deep thought and extreme beauty, and was highly valued by Alice; yet Emily scarcely gave it a passing thought. We may as well mention here that Mary L. De Manuel was the betrothed bride of Edgar Lee. She was placed in the same institution with Alice, at the suggestion of Mrs. Lee. Being room-mates, of like talents, they soon became almost inseparable. It was upon Edgar's visits to Alice, that he became attached to the daughter of the wealthy southerner. For a long time he resisted the mad infatuation, as he thought it, but with no effect. The more he resisted, the dearer she, became to him. Mary likewise loved the young and handsome northerner, but had feared to regard his attentions otherwise than as the mere courtesy of friendship, until Alice roused them both to a knowledge of their reciprocal attachments.   Mary was delighted with the idea of passing the vacation with Edgar and Alice, in the home of her mother's early years. She also wished to strew flowers upon her grandmother's grave, and drop a tear to-her memory, as well as to become acquainted with Edgar's youngest and most beautiful sister, as Alice had often called Emily. She had formed an idea vastly different from the truth ia regard to her. She had fancied her of sweet, retiring manners, and of a warm and generous heart, and was disappointed at finding her haughty and exacting, without one spark of her sister's noble, generous feelings. Of Cecelia she had often heard with the faintest touch of indiffe- rence. But she was not surprised when she beheld her young artless face, her easy grace andkind attention to the wishes of others, that she held so high a place in heri cousin's heart. Indeed I she wondered how the indifference of Emily could withstand her gentle goodness. She knew not that jealousy lurked in the heart of Ermily, turning all Cecelia's kind atten- tions into duplicity and clothing her innocent face in a net work of art. Often Emily studied the expression of her fea- tures-often desired to look like her. She knew not that the charm which made her so lovely, lay within her own reach that she had but to throw off her idleness, and live for the good of others, both in this life, and for the life to come; that she must study to improve her natural gifts as well as to correct her faults, and not pass her time in idle dreams, calculated to fill her mind with jealousy and discontent.  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7463-00000095"/> 1ft4      CEOF,T TA GREY; OR, T HE CHAPTER XVI. CECEIt was more than pleased with her new acquaintance, and delighted with the prospect of claiming her for her cousin;  while Emily looked upon it as a marriage de convenance, and studied the probable advantage it would be to her. Mary read her expectations with more pity than anger, while the innocent congratulations of Cecelia found a warm response in her own heart. Edgar was pouring his thanks into her ears, for the happiness she was instrumental in their enjoying. "Oh I yes," exclaimed Alice, " if it were not for Cecelia, we should be miserable. Indeed I nothing ever goes wrong, but sh is ready to bear the burden of it herself. My little sister here would have no ne to shoulder her petulance but for her."' "Indeed!" interrupted Emily, "I am quite competent to sustain my OWn burdens, and do not thank any one to become my supporter."* "There it is," exclaimed Edgar, "Cecelia will only get curses instead of thanks from Emily. We will have to curb that unruly tongue of yours, sister dear; it may bring you into trouble some of these times."  "Never you fear for my tongue," replied Emily; it will not weary in a good cause."       Cecelia turned upon her a look so full of sorrow, that a feel- ing of remorse, for the first time, took place in her mind; and  for that day she ceased to annoy her. But Cecelia did not for'   VICISSITUDA OF FORTUNE.       185 get soon the insinuation so pointedly given, and she was unhappy whenever Emily took a seat by her side. Mr. Grey had solicited Cecelia to make inquiries of Emily, in regard to her wishes respecting attending the next term with her ; and Cecelia went- to the apartment where Emily sat alone, and made the inquiry. "If you came here to satisfy an idle curiosity," was Emily's reply, "  It can tell you that I would like attending the two or three first terms, just to get an insight of music and some such accomplishments that are fashionable. Alice :or mother will never look to anything but the useful in my education. Now tell me, why do you ask?" "Go down stairs, Emily, and tell papa you would like to go, and you will know why I inquired." Cecelia took her seat by the window, while Emily descended the stairs and passed through the sitting-room, to the kitchen, where Mr. Grey sat occupied with a newspaper, while Mrs. Grey cut the leaves of Cecelia's last magazine. Emily did not wait for Mr. Grey to propose the subject, but stepping to his side, said:  "Uncle, Cecelia said I should hear from you why she in- quired if I would like to attend school." "Well,' replied Mr. Grey, " did you tell her?" "Yes, sir, I told her I should."  "Then get ready, and you shall go, if your mother is willing that you should be company for Cecelia." Emily thanked her uncle very kindly, and with some of the warmth of juvenile years, expressed her pleasure to Cecelia. She then hastened to Alice, to inform her of her uncle's inten- tions. "If Uncle Arthur sends you to school," repeated Alice, " to become a companion for Cecelia, you have a great responsi- bility resting upon you. You must be very careful not to make school life unpleasant to her ; or distress her by any ignoble or ungenerous remarks.

Cecelia's school longings all disappeared, as her eye fell-upon her cloak and bonnet placed in the rocking-chair near the fire, so as to be warm when needed. Then she began to think how much she should miss her mother's watchful care, and how long it would be before she should again hear her father's pleasant "good nightV"As she passed through the hall, the sight of her trunk, which she had packed and repacked half a dozen times, made the tears start to her eyes, and if she had not been ashamed, she would have gone back to her mother, and begged to remain with her. But ere the morning call came, she had conquered her repugnance to leaving homp, appearing cheerful and pleased when her mother's searching eye fell upon her. Mrs. Grey folded Cecelia to her heart, while she gave her a parting blessing. Mr. Grey took her in his arms, kissed her, called her his pride, his life ; and telling her to qualify herself to become a companion of the intellectual and the noble in mind, and return to make his home happy, bade her " good bye," and Cecelia was borne away and lost to the view of the tearful eyes that rested upon her.

Would she forget all the lessons her mother had striven to impress upon her mind, since her earliest years? Would she forget the love of her tender parents?' were the questions that each asked of the other.

If sickness or accident should take the stay of our declining years from us, we should place our trust in God. We   have done what we believe the best for Cecelia, and if all our hopes are not realized we will have no  reason to murmur."

I think we had better hire them both. Patrick is of age in the spring, and Mary is more than eighteen now. I have not the least idea she would have stayed until this time, if it were not for Patrick. It will be a treat for Cecelia-the wedding I mean--on her return,  and secure the services of the young people, who are both faithful in their duty to us. We should not know how to do without them." Mrs. Grey told him to do as he thought best with Patrick, if he wished to keep him he could do so. As for Mary, she had promised to remain another year with her. She thought it was their intention to marry, as soon as they had accumu. lated enough to commence housekeeping with. "I have it," returned Mr. Grey ; "Patrick is out to the barn threshing; I will go out and assist him for a while--just long enough to open a conversation with him. He is no fool; if one would get a straight answer from him, he must ask him a straight question." "Mary is a good girl," returned Mrs. Grey, "and I think Patrick is worthy of her. If they conclude to be married, and stop with us, they may go to housekeeping in the little room just across the wood-shed. It will be very comfortable for them ; they can have the little summer pantry adjoining; with the chamber above. You can tell them so; it may be an additional inducement to them." Mr. Grey almost forgot Cecelia with the new idea of happi- ness he expected to bestow. He found Patrick, as he expected he should, standing in the centre of a pile of straw--while the oxen went slowly around-ever and anon throwing a fork full of straw beneath their feet.  Mr. Grey smiled as he looked upon him. "Well, Patrick," he exclaimed, "how do you get along, threshing alone?" Patrick took off his hat and wiped the perspiration from his forehead.

"Stop, Patrick," repeated Mr. Grey.  "I want you to answer my question," and again he commenced laughing, and ran out of the barn to recover his self-possession. When he had sobered himself, and returned to the threshing floor, Patrick was gone. "Ha Il what!" he exclaimed, " what does this mean?," and hastening into the house, he found Patrick packing up to leave. "What does this mean, Patrick?" he inquired. - "Confound your impudence I1" returned Patrick, "you have taught me to resent insult, and if it had been any other than yourself, he should have felt the weight of my goadabout his shoulders. As it is, you had better let me alone, I tell you; for there is no knowing what I may do." "I know it, good Patrick," said Mr. Grey but that little room and pantry, at the end of the woodshed, would just be the nicest home for you and M ary. Then my wife could fur- nish it cheap for you, without you paying anything down, and I will make a contract with you to keep you fifteen years, if you choose; Mary to  assist my wife, and you to  work as you have done for me." &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7463-00000098"/> 190       CECEOLA GRBEY; OR, THE Patrick felt his anger oozing out at the ends of his fingers, and before he knew it, he was showering blessings upon his benefactor's head. To be able to find a home for Mary was just what he had wished. He could not bear the thought of having her leave her comfortable situation, to -go among strangers. She had agreed to stay with Mrs. Grey for a year more. "It was Mary's own 6ffer," he continued; " she thought she could earn enough to get a bed, table, a few chairs and dishes. And he would try to lay in a few years' provisions and rent, and then they were to have been married. - But this arrange- ment was better, and Mr. Grey would never be sorry for the interest he manifested in them."  Mary was as delighted as Patrick had been when she heard from him the arrangements. She hastened to thank Mrs. Grey for the promise of her assistance in fitting her out for house. keeping. "' How can I show my gratitude to you," she urged. "By letting me set the wedding day," replied Mrs. Grey. "That you shall," said Mary, "and I'll thank you for it too." "Then," returned Mrs. Grey, "it must be when Cecelia returns, at the vacation." "Ah! and that will be a pleasure worth waiting for," exclaimed Patrick, coming in at the moment. "We can never sufficiently repay you for your goodness to us." Mrs. Grey thought herself amply repaid for the exertions she had made in behalf of the destitute orphans. Mr. Grey soon came in. "Ah! Alice," he exclaimed; "my plan worked well. Cecelia will have the satisfaction of adorn- ing the bride, I suppose?" "Yes," replied Mrs. Grey; "I shall tell Mary, if she has no style of dress in anticipation, Cecelia will be delighted with the task of planning one." "So she will," exclaimed Mr. Grey, " she is a good girl."    VICISSrrUDES OF FOB1'UNM.      191  "You must not set too much by her, Arthur,"i returned Mrs. Grey, " she has her faults as well as others."

Mrs. Grey inquired if he had been to the post-oflce; for she was expecting a letter from Mrs. Lee. No, no," Mr. Grey replied, "but I will send Patrick this moment." Patrick was dispatched to the office, and Mr. Grey returned to the sitting-room. "Alice,"he inquired, "why do you wish so much to hear from your sister?  You are constantly watching the mail." "I urged her to make it her home with us, you are aware," replied Mrs. Grey. "If she concludes to, I suppose she wil write you to remove her furniture from the cottage she has occupied. The year has almost expired, and if her furniture remains over the time, she may have some trouble with the proprietor, which would be very disagreeable to her." Patrick soon returned from the office; with a letter directed to Mr. Grey, in the handwriting of Edgar Lee.   Mrs. Grey had hastened to the door, as soon as she saw Patrick coming up the walk, and taking the letter from his hand she sunk into the first chair,  I "Arthur," she exclaimed, M Iary is sick-perhaps dying; see, this is not her handwriting, and it is directed to you I, "Never anticipate!" replied Mr. Grey, with a vague fear of impending evil.

"Mary is going to be married to Edgar Lee! He requests me to give away the bride I to fix the little cottage in which Mrs. Lee formerly resided, into a bridal hall-and solicits our attendance at the wedding I He wishes me to write to Edgar, Alice, and Emily, preparatory to his doing so, and expects us, with Cecelia, and his own children (as he already designates them), to return to his city home, and spend the rest of the vacation in bridal festivities. In short, we are to have a new brother- in-law-than which nothing could be more desirable." Mrs. Grey then tore the seal, and unfolded the paper she had been so fearful of reading. Mrs. Lee wrote of the change she anticipated making in life. She said it was for her children's sake alone she married the second time; that Ada was almost recovered from her illness, and, with her brother Delphin, was very anxious she should fill the place in their father's house, made vacant by the death of their mother. She wrote-"You knew our mother," says Ada, 'and she thought it would be better for us all, to have you fill the place she occupied, than that a stranger should do so. She knew your trials had been blessed to you for your own good, and the good of all with whom you associate. We wait to call you mother; we pro- mised her, if you would fill her place, and be kind to us, as she has been, to love and respect you, with the same regard we would have shown her.' Then Delphin says: ' Do Aunt Mary, come and live with us, and be our mother. Then we shall nrer have some hateful mamma here. We love Edgar and Alice-Emily we can endure for your sake-and we will all   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       193 be brothers and sisters together. Younwill be our mamma- won't you-good kind Aunt Mary?' For some time, the knowledge of Emily's peculiar disposition prevented a compli- ance with their wishes. I knew it would be securing a home for my children, with all the advantages they were in so much need of. I knew if William could express a wish, it would be in favor of our union. His children held the first place in his heart; during his last moments he reverted to his children, with the keenest sorrow, at the station his death and their poverty would oblige them to occupy. Still, I dread bringing disunion in this united family. Mrs. Lee was a pattern of gentleness ; and governed her children with a wish. They are both mild, and easily grieved-the more so, perhaps, that they have been so tenderly treated, and were so early taught by their parents to sensitively regard the desires of others, so carefully taught to avail expressing a wish that might cause a disappointment to their friends; and expecting the same forbearance from others. You well know Emily is both exacting and overbear- ing; I have pointed out these defects to Ada, Delphin, and Edgar Lee, their father; yet they insist upon her taking a place in the family as a sister. Mr. Lee says that I must not blame her too severely, for she is only the counterpart of my- self; and will consequently have to wait for time, with its cor- recting finger to rest upon her, to dispel the vain, half-formed visions of happiness her fancy has created. "Too well do I  know the truth of his remarks I Poor- poor Emily; do not hate her, sister Alice. If you have any charity for me  in your heart, leave a little for Emily I Her faults have endeared her to me, perhaps, more than the excel- lencies of Alice .have twined my affections around her.

Edgar has officers in all the villages of that country, watching for his return. It is supposed he is secreted by his friends.. I do not desire his arrest; it would not relieve my mind to know his wife was made miserable, and his children disgraced by a public execution. He carries his punishment with him. Fear keeps him on the alert-misery is his constant companion. His punishment is, doubtless, as great as any we can inflict upon him; then let us leave him in the hands of his Maker.

Edgar Lee--the bridegroom-gives orders to pay the rent for another year, and they will leave the furniture here after the wedding, if you have room for it." "Mary," returned Mrs. Grey, ' I suppose, thinks to make some reparation to us, for the little assistance she has received at our hands.  But I do not wish for anything of Mary's. Her furniture will doubtless be of use to her children at some future time." For a few weeks Mr. and Mrs. Grey busied themselves in planning some new or agreeable surprise for Cecelia, on her return at vacation. The old carpet in the parlor was taken up, and in the place of it, a nice Brussel's substituted. A new centre table stood in the place of the old-fashioned one, that had graced the room for half a century, and damask curtains were hung in heavy folds before the windows., After placing everything to the best advantage, Mrs. Grey said, with a sigh,  "It is very long--this three months ;, I think you had better go and bring Cecelia home in six weeks, at farthest." Mr. Grey nodded his assent to his wife's remark, and light- ing a lamp, retired to dream of Cecelia and her school life. Mrs. Grey plied her needle for an hour, and then taking her ink and paper from the. escritoir by her side, she wrote for an hour; then folded the paper, placed an envelope over it, sealed and addressed the letter to Miss Cecelia Grey. Mrs. Grey retired after recommending her child to the care of her Heavenly Father, who had never disappointed or for- saken them.

Evergreens, twined with tasty flowers, were suspended from the ceiling, and clustered about the bridal-chair. Crimson and white curtains hung in heavy folds to the floor, and each article of furniture was dusted and polished, till the small room looked like some fairy home, instead of the homely dwelling of the widow Leo. As Mrs. Grey gave the finishing touch to the china vases upon the mantel, Mr. Grey came to the door with his carriage. "Well, Alice," he exclaimed, "is everything done to your satisfaction?" and he peeped into the little room so tastefully adorned. "Come in and see," replied Mrs. Grey, " could you) desire a more beautiful place from which to take a bride?" "Oh I no," said Mr. Grey, "I will not soil the carpet with the mud I shall bring in. As for the bride, it is of little conse- quence from what place we take her, if she be but worthy, and we take her to no worse place than we find her in." Mrs. Grey threw her cloak around her and was soon seated in the carriage, moving swiftly towards home. Patrick and Mary sat close by the blazing fire, listening for the echo of the wheels upon the frozen ground, while the steaming viands were covered, and cloth laid for their kind master and mistress. Soon Patrick seized the lantern, and exclaiming: "They have come," ran out to meet them. Mr. Grey lifted his wife from the carriage, and they entered the warm room where the ruddy blaze threw a bright glow over the carpet. "Ah!" said Mrs. Grey, "home is too tempting--I -should never be contented away from it." "Never, from such a home as yours," said Mary Malcom, ' if your home was like Judge Nelford's, you would not say so." "Why, Mary?" inquired- Mr. Grey, " the judge, sure, has everything to make him love his home."   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE;       197 "Everything but peace," replied Mary. "When I was there for a week, they were far enough from happy, with all their finery around them." "You were a mere child then, Mary," said Mrs. Grey; "you should not express an opinion; he doubtless loves his home very much." "If he does," replied Mary, "I am sure his home does not like him. The moment he enters the room, he begins to find fault. First, the rug has not been shook. Finally, it dusts his polished boots, or the fire smokes. Then his wife begins to bend lower over her work, which is no sooner done, than he tells her to stoop-stoop,- she has not become sufficiently crooked, she must make a hunchback of herself, and by the time the tea bell rings his wife is in tears. Then the muffins are not sufficiently browned, or the tea is smoky, or something is wrong, so that he cannot relish his supper. After which, little Charley comes in for his share of blame. He is never in the right place or position, which is true enough ; but he does not correct him in a manner anyways likely to mend the fault. But the judge having satisfied his hunger, as well as given vent to his feelings, saunters forth, to enjoy the jokes of wits, or the conversation of the intellectual and the good. He is happy-oh yes, no one wears a sweeter smile or more obliging air, while his poor wife sits crying over the couch of her much- abused child. That is the life Judge Nelford leads at home." "I don't want to hear it," replied Mr. Grey; "only give Patrick -to understand that you never will allow him to find fault, and let Judge Nelford take care of himself. If he chooses to make those nearest, and that should be dearest to him, miserable, he will have to drink the broth after his own season- ing one of these days." Mrs. Grey sighed as she took her place, and passed a cup of fragrant tea to her husband, inwardly thankful that her life was not bound up in the place of Mrs. Nelford's.

"Why PI exclaimed Mrs. Grey, " is not Charles at home?" "He left some time since," replied Mr. Grey, " and it is said his mother advised him to go. The reason is not known, but I see it all now. His father was crushing all the good principles out of him--making him  believe himself unworthy to fill a place by his fireside or his table; and he has gone out to struggle with the world alone. How far is it they reside from here?" "Nearly thirty miles," replied Mrs. Grey. "Charles Nel- ford is somewhere not far from twenty-one years old, I think. A noble child he was ; his frank open brow and mischievous eye endeared, him to all. Yet a shadow crossed his path in tender years. Think you not his mother sent him to some friend-some protector in whom she could safely confide?" "I am unable to say," replied Mr. Grey'; "it is whispered that he early gave his heart to God ; that he is to fill the min- isterial chair."

"Don't you think," inquired Mrs. Grey, "that if Nelford should find the home of his son, he would seek redress of his benefactor for his supposed injury?"  "No, no," replied Mr. Grey, " he would rather hush up the affair; it reflects no credit to his name. I verily believe, if his son was by his side during the coming party strife, Nelford would receive more votes by ten to a hundred than he will now. His opponents make quite a story of Nelford's treatment of his boy ; more than one I have heard declare him unfit for a seat in Congress." "Well, Charles is not far from  twenty-one," said Mrs. Grey, "I think very likely he will be with his father before election," and Mrs. Grey resumed her old seat by the work- table.  Mr. Grey drew his large easy-chair a little nearer the stove, and listened to the whistling of the wind around the corners of his dwelling ; or its low meanings, as it died away in the forest. Unconsciously, he fell into a sort of half-sleeping- half-waking state ; and he dreamed that he was endeavoring to climb the rugged sides of a steep mountain. He would labor- iously reach the summit of a large rock near the centre of the mountain, when the rock commenced swaying to and fro in the air, and in spite of all his efforts he slipped from it and sunk ex- hausted to the foot of the height, when he, again commenced the ascent. As he slowly crept along, supporting himself by the low shrubs and bushes, he fancied fatigue overcame him, and he fainted- to awake and find himself supported by an old man, whose long silver hair and beard fell below his girdle. He was clothed in the skins of deer, and held a staff in his hand. Starting up, he looked upon the stranger in mingled wonder and awe. "Son!" said the old .man, " what is it you seek upon this mountain? Do yon not know you can never of yourself reach  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7463-00000103"/> 200       CECELIA GREY; 0R, THE the summit. This mountain is called the mountain of Perfect tion. Those who undertake to climb its rugged sides, in their own strength, cling to every bush or shrub that will give them the least support, till they reach the rock of Envy; when they stop to rest. No sooner does Envy feel them upon her shoulders, than she tips them over her head, and they- awake to find themselves at the base of the, mountain, and are compelled with weakened energies and a faint heart to start again for the magic rock, only to fall from the high eminence which they fancied they had attained." "How then," he inquired, " can we climb to the summit of this mountain?" "If you will trust in Jesus, and draw your strength from him," replied the old man, "I am appointed to tell you the way and be your guide.  First, if you would pluck the sweet flowers or taste the rich fruit that grow upon the plain at the summit of this- mountain, you must fix your eye upon that little star you perceive far away up the acclivity, so distant that you can hardly perceive it ; and take this staff in your hand, which is Faith, and place your footsteps in the firm found- ation, which are the steps of Truth. Feel closely with your foot before you let it rest, else you will settle upon the loose gravel, slightly covered over with a little rank grass, called Indulgence, and you will slip backwards to the first step taken upon the firm ground. You must lean firmly upon your staff; and keep your eye upon the little star ; which may even become invisible to you sometimes ; but you must only stand. still, clinging to your staff, so that you do not lose it; and the cloud will pass away and your light break forth, more brilliant for the little delay you have experienced in your progress. But beware you do not weary when the hours of darkness come on, and lie down and sleep, and your staff fall from your hand. The path to the rock is bordered with bushes and shrubs, very easy for the traveller to seize upon. But keep watching, and when weary, look for your star and lean more firmly upon your staff   -VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.                  201 Be very sure you do not faint in the noonday heat, when the little star disappears. You have nothing to fear from outward foes if you only keep peace and hope in your heart, with your good staff, Faith, in your hand." Then Mr. Grey thought he raised his hand to take the staff, which he had no sooner taken, than the stranger disappeared. Looking around, he found himself at the base of the mountain in the same place from which he had before started. Then he looked far away up the mountain, and through the dark forests, to the little star which shone brightly and clearly from the surrounding darkness. He thought if he could only call upon the unknown guide that he had been promised, it would not seem so difficult to reach the summit of the mountain. But in the strength of One who never faints, he commenced the ascent, thinking: "If I should go back, I know not how long it would be ere the darkness overtakes me, or I sink in the swamp of Deception. While now, I have the light of yonder star for my guide, and a good strong staff in my hand, with peace and hope in my heart, the strength and love of our Redeemer to sustain me, what if the path is thorny, or I suffer from hunger or thirst, the heat or cold? There is a level plain at the summit of this mountain, where there is no more sorrow or pain. There all is beautiful, and I will gaze upon it and claim it as my home." Slowly and carefully he stepped along, removing with his staff every impediment to his progress. Sometimes his star disappeared, then he stood still and waited, going neither back- g ward or forward till his guide igain electrified him with its light. Suddenly the rock of Envy stood full before him, in his path; he stooped, looking up to his star, and he saw its clear light shining down upon him. Then placing his staff firmly against the huge impediment, he exclaimed, " not in my strength," and the rock rolled away without the least noise or resistance ; and with a thankful heart, he again resumed his way, till he entered the forests. Here were beds of moss,  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7463-00000104"/> 202       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE covered with the sweetest flowers ; the birds sung around him, and the air bore the sweetest perfume. But whenever he endeavored to set his foot upon these beds, he found no place to rest it, and he cautiously removed it. After a long search, his foot rested in the roughest and most obscure part of the forest. In some places, the briers and underbrush tore his clothes, or lacerated his flesh, so that he felt the blood trickle down his face and hands ; and to add to this discomfort, a dark cloud came over and hid the light of the star. Then the wind moaned in the forest, or came in angry gusts sweeping over the tall pines, and loosening large stones, hurled them down the steep precipice into the unfathomed gulfs below. Then the lightning-flashed, thunders rolled, and the rain fell, until it seemed as if the mountain shook from its foundation. In a pause of the tempest, he heard the sullen roar as of deep waters, and the thought of an inundation for a moment intimi- dated him. Then the words of the stranger came home to his heart. "You have nothing to fear from outward foes or out- ward friends," he said, as the thought suggested itself to leave his painful situation for the other path, which was so inviting, so pleasant; and he calmly waited and watched for the star. At last the cloud rolled away, and more brilliant-more dazzling than before it looked down upon him. He fancied his heart bounded with a hidden joy, as with renewed strength and hope, he continued his journey. After this, he rapidly approached the summit of the moun- tain, with greater ease and more pleasure; his eye remained fixed upon the little star, so that what had at first been very painful, had now become his chief delight. Soon he left the forest, and a brilliant, steady light broke upon his vision. The star appeared just before him-so lovely and so beautiful, he could find no words to extol it. Quickening his steps, he saw before him a level plain, upon which bloomed the rarest and sweetest flowers, perpetually, for as he stooped to pluck one, another grew instantly in its place. The most enchanting   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       203 music was wafted on the air, mingled with the perfume of ten thousand flowers. The most beautiful birds flew past and around him, sitting upon his hand when extended towards them,  or singing in chorus with the voices of unseen musicians. Sud- denly, he fancied he had lost his staff, and stooping for it, he commenced falling as if from a great height. With a scream of terror, he started from his easy-chair, where he had sat nodding and dreaming, while Mrs. Grey sewed the white down upon Cecelia's hood. She had just held it up to the light for inspection, when it fell from her hands, and she flew to- the side of her husband. Patrick and Mary soon crowded around, and while one shook him, and the other cried, Mrs. Grey comprehended the meaning of his bewildered stare, and with a smile, told him it might be more pleasant dreaming in his bed, than his easy-chair. Mr. Grey took advantage of the hint, and retired to think of his wonderful dream. He did not wish to tell Mrs. Grey of his sleeping vision; he feared she would interpret it in behalf of Judge Nelford; who, conscience told him, he had judged rather harshy. Mrs. Grey picked the bonnet from the floor, and fastening new strings to it, prepared to follow her husband. Early on the following morning, Mr. Grey said he would ride over to the village- and see if there was not a letter from Cecelia; and promising to be back in time for breakfast, he left the room. It was stinging cold, and Mrs. Grey, with a sigh, looked out upon the frozen ground around their home. She knew there were many poor and needy families near her, and this was the day she usually called upon them to share their sorrows, and, if within her means, to alleviate them. Yet, the bitter cold was felt by others besides herself, she thought ; "shall I fear who have a warm fire at home, comforta- ble -furs, and all things suited to the, inclemency of the weather, while, perhaps, many have not clothes or food sufficient to keep them from suffering, or perchance, no wood to burn?"Then she  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7463-00000105"/> 204      COEOEITA GREY; OR), THE took the little dresses and coats made from the half-wprn gar- ments of her family, and placed them in a large basket ; then she took her basket into the pantry and placed some rolls of butter, pieces of meat, and loaves of bread in the side of it ; to which she added a cup of jelly, some raspberry wine, and a few other delicacies for the sick ; she then called Patrick, and bade him harness the horses before a light wagon, and place the basket in it, as she wished to make -a few calls after break- fast. Patrick nodded, and Mrs. Grey again took her place at the window, not this time to speculate upon the necessities of -others, but to watch the return of her husband, with the much wished for epistle. In a little time, she saw Tiger bounding along up the road, and hoped Mr. Grey was not far distant. In this she was not disappointed, for he soon came in sight, and rode around to the stable to leave his horse before coming in. Mrs. Grey stepped lightly to the door when she heard his footsteps, and before she had time to ask, Mr. Grey placed a letter in her hand. "From Cecelia," she exclaimed, breaking the seal. "Arthur, come," and they went together into the sitting-room. "You read it, Alice," said Mr. Grey. Mrs. Grey commenced with a tremulous voice, not that she feared for her child--on the contrary, it was such a joy to read a letter traced by her daughter's hand. It was written in clear, legible characters, and commenced thus: "MY EVER LOVED AND RESPECTED MOTHER: "You will excuse me for not saying mamma, as I very much wish to. I fear it might look foolish in a great girl like me.  I never knew what it was to be homesick or lonely before. Your Cecelia is not all her mother would wish her to be ; for I find it impossible not to wish myself back in our little sitting-room, rather than with all these strange faces; some   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       205 showing their perfect indifference towards me, others giving me a broad stare, some tittering, a few inclined to be friendly. But worst of all, is my accomplished room-mate. She has more confidential friends than I expect to have during' a lifetime. Emily examines into- all the minute particulars of each new acquaintance ; if their parents are wealthy and influential, she is uncommonly polite and attentive, and is evidently disgusted with my quiet, unobtrusive ways. "Alice cannot claim one-half of the particular acquaintance that Emily is on the most intimate terms with. In fact, she is a general favorite, I believe, among her school-mates. As for her teachers, they shake their heads and smile, whenever Emily is seen in close conversation with the young ladies. Alice and Mary L. de Manuel keep as near her as it is possible to do with- out exciting her suspicion, and try to keep her to themselves. For my part, I long since gave up the idea. Emily will be her own master; she says, ' she needs nothing but polishing, and she is prepared to enter any society, however learned.' Her songs are all Italian, of which she knows the meaning of only a few words. "I believe I have made some progress in my studies-at least, my teachers flatteringly say so. If I could only learn at home what I -am trying to here, I would not stay another day on any conditions. -Alice says I will begin to love my school- mates, almost as sisters, and a separation will be painful to me. Many of her young friends have returned to their homes, and none can fill their place in her affections. It may be so, but none are so dear to me yet. They say I am cold and indiffer- ent; perhaps I am. My lessons are always perfect, and no one, with the exception of Alice, has ever heard me complain of weariness. "You must write me often, dear mamma and papa-both of you. You don't know with what pleasure I receive your loving words and kind admonitions into my heart. I hope I shall merit all the praises you so willingly lavish upon me.  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7463-00000106"/> 206       CECELIA GREY; OR1 THE But I can find no good qualities in me, that are not counter- balanced by evil thoughts or deeds. My mind is ever running, sometimes in contentment, then in vain regrets or idle dreams, till I think myself almost as bad-as absurd as Emily seems to be. I have much to tell you, mother dear, much to ask you. The bell rings and I must go down and recite my lesson. I have it by heart, and what is more, comprehend it perfectly. "Your affectionate daughter, "CECELIA GREY S" As Mrs. Grey concluded reading the letter, Mary informed them that breakfast was waiting. Mr. Grey folded the letter and placed it in his pocket, for he anticipated a second perusal. Mrs. Grey had forgotten the bitter cold, and. smilingly took a seat in the wagon, when Patrick drove to the door. After driving a short distance, she bade him stop, first at the house of Widow Dale. Mrs. Dale had been sick, but was just beginning to sit up a little. The care of Mrs. Malcom had preyed upon her feeble frame, and as she had given herself no rest, it at last brought her upon the bed of sickness. When Mrs. Grey stepped from the wagon, Lucy opened the door with a glad smile, and a pleasant good morning. She forgot their deprivations and sor- rows as she gazed upon their benefactress' face. Mrs. Grey returned the salutation kindly, and advanced to the side of Mrs. Dale. I' My good friend," exclaimed the sick woman, as she pressed her hand ; " what should I have done without you?" "Our Saviour knows all our wants," replied Mrs. Grey, "you owe me nothing. It is His work. We should do unto others, as we would have them do unto us. And then we have done nothing worthy of reward or thanks, having done simply our duty. Repress all thanks to me. If you are thankful for your comforts, thank the author of them, not me, for in so do- ing you would only pain me."   VIOISSriUJDES OF FORTUNE. j     207 Mrs. Grey left a roll of butter, some bacon, candles, and wine for the invalid; and then hastened to relieve the wants of others in the vicinity of her home. After, clothing and feeding many destitute children, she returned home. Mr. Grey desired to know the result of her calls, and she informed him that Patrick must take the widow Dale a load of wood.  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7463-00000107"/> 208       OECEL A GREY; OR, THE CHAPTER XVIII. WE will now leave the happy fireside of Mr. Grey for a brief season, and look in upon the young ladies at the seminary. While Emily had initiated herself into the "good graces" of the whole school, and had become a general favorite with the most showy and frivolous of. the scholars, Cecelia had remained very much by herself, forming few acquaintances, and devoting her time exclusively to her difficult and arduous tasks. It may well be imagined that Cecelia, who .had been so affectionately trained from early childhood, should feel very sad and lonely in her present isolated condition. Even the teachers seemed to regard her with little favor, until one day Mrs. Wes- ton, the Principal,-was excited to sympathy by her friendless appearance, -and kindly took her under her own especial charge. When Cecelia left Mrs. Weston's room, she rejoiced in hav- ing found a friend that could appreciate her, for neither Alice or Miss de Manuel seemed to comprehend her embarrassed situ- ation. She even smiled, and spoke to a few of the- plainest of her school-mates, and was gratified with their affability. She then found herself wondering at her shyness, and soon after she was walking with the arm of a sweet girl -around her, talking not of this one's foibles, or that one's wealth-ah, no 1 it was of her troubles and attainments at school; how often she had been disappointed in her lessons, how often won a prize ; how ! much she loved her teachers and associates. Then her cornm-   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       209 panion spoke tenderly of her parents, brothers and sisters at home. She said she had been four terms at the school, and hoped to graduate soon. "I do love my school dearly," she said, "but my home is far more dear." "Do see that girl whimper in the corner," said Emily, com- ing towards them. "Who is it?" inquired Miss Media, who was Cecelia's com- panion. "I don't know," replied Emily, "Lilla says she came last night, alone and without an acquaintance here. She must be silly to sit there and cry I Why don't she go home again, if she feels so bad?" "You may not know the circumstances," replied Miss Media ; "perhaps she has other sorrows besides leaving home and friends. It is strange that Mrs. Weston has not discovered her. I will tell her this minute. Stay till I return, Miss Cecelia," and with these words she tripped lightly away. "I would not take the trouble Miss Susan Media has Idone, for that ill-looking girl," said Emily. "But there comes Lilla i" and she ran to meet her. Cecelia felt grieved for the unhappy girl, who had buried her face in her hands and sobbed convulsively. Several of the girls approached her, inquiring, "What is the matter? homesick? Do not cry so, we will all try to make you happy. Can we do nothing for you?" The girl only shook her head, trying to force back the tears, and still the beating of her heart. As they all withdrew from her, Cecelia stepped softly to her side, whispering : "You must not indulge in unnecessary grief. If I had given way to my feelings I should be weeping now. It is hard to leave one's home, and come among strangers; but meet the necessity firmIy, and you will soon feel reconciled to your sit- uation." "It is not that I am among'strangers, altogether, Miss Grey."  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7463-00000108"/> 210       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE Cecelia started, then pushed the hair from the brow of the weeping girl, and exclaimed: "Alpha Nelford!" then kissing her, she whispered, " there- there, you must not weep. Come, we will go up to your room, Alpha." Miss Nelford gladly complied, and they left the room to- gether. When Mrs. Weston came in, a few moments afterwards, Cecelia and the stranger had gone. Cecelia had several times before met the eldest daughter of Judge Nelford at rides, con- certs and afternoon visits. It is not strange that Alpha so readily clung to Cecelia, and asked her to-share in her sorrows. She informed her that she had been sent from home by her father, in anger. He had told her never again to darken his doors, unless she revealed the retreat of her brother Charles, who had left home- some years since, as his father told him never again to come into his presence while he bore the name of Christian. Charles had chosen the rough paths of the world, in preference to his father's wealth. "He is studying Scripture, with the intention of becoming a missionary, and he will soon become of age, when be will write to his father," she continued. "I promised Charles never to reveal the place of his retreat, and cannot, even if my father fulfills his threats. If Charles thinks fit to reveal it, well- but if not, it remains a secret with me." Cecelia could not imagine why the name of Charles brought the quick blood to her cheek, or caused her heart to throb so wildly. She had never seen him ; yet, his sister's voice awoke some half-forgotten echo in her heart, that had lived there un- known and uninvited for years. Cecelia could only tell Alpha to try to be composed, and hope for the best. Her father would doubtless invite her to come home. When her brother wrote to him it would surely bring his forgiveness. , "Ah I I hope so," replied Miss Nelford, "I am so unhappy It is very wrong in me thus to disobey my-father, let his comrn-   VICISSITUDES OF 'FORTUNE.       2" mands be ever so inconsistent or unreasonable. Some one told him that mother and I knew where my brother was. He did not wish to question mother, so he watched his opportunity to command me to inform him. This I begged him not to do, and told him I could not reveal the name of the one that sheltered and protected my poor brother; for I knew my father would severely punish the offender in the person of my brother's friend. This would be the hardest of all, for father had often forbidden any one harboring him. My father will never-never, forgive me, I fear." "Your father paid your )tuition before he placed you here, did he not?" inquired Cecelia. "Yes,; replied Alpha. "Be convinced then," resumed Cecelia, " three months will not pass before you return home. Your father only intends to compel you to tell him of Charles's retreat." "Perhaps so," returned Alpha. "I shall be afraid of join- ing my school-mates for fear of again enlisting their sympathies in my behalf. If I could only command myself, I would get along better. I shall soon have the whole school to condole with me, if I keep on ; thus I must first learn to submit to circumstances with a good grace, and then commence my studies.' My teachers will think me a dull scholar, I fear." They were scarcely seated, when a soft rap at the door announced a visitor; Miss Nelford opened the door, and Mrs. Weston entered. She smiled upon Cecelia, who, in answer to Miss Nelford's wondering stare, introduced her as the precep- tress. Mrs. Weston sat a short time, and then left them alone; for Miss Nelford had become more resigned and cheerful while conversing with Cecelia. After staying a half hour longer with her, Cecelia returned to her own apartment to resume her studies. She found several young ladies occupying the room, laugh- ing, talking or singing, while Miss de Vere entertained them with a ludicrous description of Miss Nelford's appearance. Cecelia was indignant, and exclaimed,  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7463-00000109"/> 212       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE "Miss de Vere, I will thank you to perform your theatricals in your own room. I do not wish to be annoyed with such scenes in my apartment. I will give you to understand that Miss Nelford is my friend, and I shall resent, personally, any insult offered her." "Well done, Miss Linsey Woolsey!" returned Miss de Vere. "Miss Lee, are you not astonished at such authority, from such a source?" Emily laughed, and said, "Never mind; Cecelia is no false friend, it will soon pass over." "But I shall mind," replied Miss de Vere. "Do you give up your right in your own apartment to her? If you do, I shall bid you farewell. See that you do not again ask me to enter this room." Thus saying, she opened the door, and descended the stairs, to lay a charge of uncourteousness against Cecelia. "Her cousin Emily, to be sure, is not to blame," she said; "she is the dupe of that sleek-looking, innocent cousin of hers. What a pity nature had not given her a face to correspond with her coarse garments. She is the most vulgar person in dress I ever saw, and her mind, I dare say, is as vulgar as her- attire." "Miss de Vere," interrupted Miss Media, " you have done Miss Grey injustice ; she is not only highly gifted in intellectual endowments, but is of a gentle, affable disposition. You had better look a little to your own peculiar qualities, and let others rest." "Your wealthy connections and high position in society, give you a right to dispute the most pointed truth," replied Miss de Vere, apparently with the greatest- complaisance; " yet, you must not forget your request, and her promise to remain here while you went in search of Mrs. Weston. Did you fail to find Miss Grey here on- your return!" "I did, and do not dislike her on that account," said Miss   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       213 Medla. "It appears she found an old acquaintance in distress, and it was a token of the goodness of her heart, that she went with her to her apartment in order to console her." "Some green thing, like Cecelia Grey, I will be bound, in spite of her rich and appropriate attire," returned Miss de Vere. The girls exchanged smiles at this demonstration of their school-mate's anger. Another moment and Lilla de Vere was in her own room, crying over her disappointment, and vowing to be revenged, not only upon Cecelia, but Susan Medla. "Susan shall hear many reports of reprimands and disgrace- she has endured in the institution, on her return to Union Square; and she will find many of her former friends ready to drop her acquaintance.  No one will know by whom such slanders are circulated, for I will always speak very highly of her --always. I would not wonder if that Cecelia Grey shoqld go home with her some of the vacations. If she does, I will poi- son the ears of her family against her--that I will; and if her school-mates like her, it will be of no consequence. As for Emily Lee, I must keep on the right side of her, however, for her cousins move in the first circles in the city. Ada Lee will be a belle till time makes her a bride, and as much longer as her husband wears a smiling face. I suppose Emily is lone- some now ; she has lost her favorite, and I will wash away the traces of these foolish tears, and seek her company again." Soon after, she descended to the hall, where she found Emily Lee.  As Emily was about to pass her, she held out her hand, with a smile. Emily gladly seized it, and in a moment the light of anger and disdain might have been seen in the eyes-of either, as they hastily surveyed Cecelia and her friend Miss Nelford, taking seats side by side. Susan Medla took the vacant place by Cecelia, and whispered, "When a new friend will not be burdensome to the lady by your'side, present me to her good graces." Cecelia smiled and bowed.   Listening soon after, Emily heard Cecelia say,  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7463-00000110"/> 214       CECELA GREY; OR, THE             J "It will do you good to talk with the girls, Mrs. Nelford." "I know now," said Emily to her confidant ; "Cecelia was somewhat acquainted with her; she is a daughter of Judge Nelford, my aunt Alice's old cast-off beau. The Judge will be delighted with the friendship between their children." No one knew better than Emily the falseness of this asser-  P tion. She fancied that such a statement, theftruth of which Cecelia could not deny, would sink the stranger, in the estima- tion of the pupils of the institution, which would repay Lilla for the slight that had been put upon her by Cecelia, for the sake of Miss Nelford. Shortly after, Cecelia presented Miss Medla to Alpha Nel- ford, and the trio went to the apartment of Cecelia to pass the evening together.                      O   I        -  VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      215 CHAPTER    XIX. ALPHA felt her grief lightened by the varied and intelligent conversation of her new acquaintance. No one of her school- mates was spoken of but with regard, and those that were unworthy of esteem, she passed in silence ; and Cecelia found herself drawing comparisons between Miss Medla and Miss de Vere, ere the evening waned away. Week after week passed away; Cecelia, Alpha, and Susan, had become more and more attached to each other. They studied, walked, recited and sung together, until Cecelia began to like the life she had so much hated at the commencement of the term. As she one day sat by her window, with her rhetoric lying open before her she mentally exclaimed, "If it were not for this deep snow, how I would delight to ramble with the preceptress and mrschool-mates among those mountains. It is nothing but mountains here it must be a charming place in summer. But I must to my task again ; I have this composition to write, and one for Emily.

But that is nothing, if she would not be so overbearing and insolent. Poor-poor -Emily, I wish she had never thought of coming here; she will be no better for coming, and she only makes us all miserable. Alice feels so bad, I pity her; she wished to write to Aunt Mary, and was obliged to call on Edgar for money to pay the postage. It is very wrong ; but then, if we deny her, she will go to Mary de Manuel, which is too mortifying to Alice. How can she be so thoughtless? There is a concert to-night in the chapel; if she knows it, and Miss de Vere goes, she must go too." At this moment Emily entered the room. "Cousin Cecelia I dear-dear cousin!" she exclaimed, seiz- ing her hand. ",There, there," interrupted Cecelia, " do not ' dear cousin' me now, I have hardly pocket-money enough left to pay the entrance fee to the concert this evening; besides, I want to write home sometimes. If you do not retrench I will be obliged to inform papa at what a rate you are going on. You must be more prudent; you have expended as much money as  your tuition comes to, three times over." ("You need say no more," returned Emily ; "I know who is quite willing and able to furnish the needful 1 I will make no more demands upon your purse, if it is so disagreeable to you ," and she started to ImrTe the room. "Emily," said Cecelia, :" come back ; you shall have the money ; what amount do you need?" "Five shillings will do," Emily replied with the greatest apparent nonchalance. "If it were not for mortifying Edgar and Alice, I would let her ask Miss de Manuel," Cecelia soliloquized, as Emily placed her purse carelessly in her pocket. "I cannot possibly give you any more money without sub- jecting myself to the mortification 'of writing to my mother for a further allowance"Cecelia continued. "You see, there- fore, that you must make no more engagements with Miss   VIOISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       217 de Vere; recollect, some things are mortifying to others as well as to yourself. Do have some regard for Edgar and Alice; you make them very unhappy.   Alice has too much delicacy to ask a pecuniary favor of Mary, the betrothed of' your bro- ther Edgar." "What are rich friends good for, if not to minister to our wants?" replied Emily with a haughty curl of her lips, as she turned away. Cecelia buried her face in her hands and wept bitterly. "What shall I do with her?' she exclaimed. "If I could only make her listen to reason, or withdraw her from her worth- less companions, who only come here to trifle away their time; or' if she possessed the least delicacy, it would be better. Neither Alice nor myself have been able to attend a single lec- ture this term. If Emily had any regard for others, she would be ashamed of her selfishness." A rap at the door called her hastily to her feet, and wiping her eyes she bade the intruder come in, for she had no desire to welcome them. A small boy opened the door, and threw a letter into her lap, which he took from  among a -number of others he car- ried. "From my mother!"Cecelia exclaimed, joyfully breaking the seal. As she unfolded the paper, a single note fell out. ' "Five dollars l" she said, holding it up to the light. "How considerate in mamma ; I guess she had an idea how it would be with Emily.  Dear mother, how much good you would have done with this note this cold winter weather. It would have assisted many poor people, or 'helped them to a few comforts they so much need.  It is not right to let Emily squander it as she will. It is fortunate she was not present when the letter came, for she will not be so free to ask for a few shillings as if she knew I possessed this remittance." Tears again sprung to the eyes of Cecelia, which she brushed 10  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7463-00000112"/> 218       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE  away, and bent over the letter to read for the third time its precious contents. She then placed it in her trunk, and turning the key upon it, she looked towards the window. As she did'so, the chapel bell called her attention to the con-  cert. "How I would like to attend," she thought, as one after another of her schoolmates passed through the corridor, and gave her a smile or a word.  Suddenly the door opened, and Edgar, Alice, and Mary de Manuel entered the apartment. "Come, cousin," said Edgar, taking her proffered hand; "you must go to the concert this evening ;we are all going." "We have the promise of hearing something extra to-night," said Miss de Manuel, "you must go, Cecelia!" Cecelia waited to hear no more, but hastily threw her shawl around her, and was soon seated with her companions, in a secluded corner of the chapel, where the softened light fell  over them, and the sweet voices of the singers floated enchant- ingly to the ear. Cecelia almost held her breath, to catch the words of an affecting ballad, composed by a young lady; then as the last lines fell so joyfully upon her ear, the transition from sorrow to joy was so great, that Cecelia involuntarily clasped her hands, and would have shrieked aloud, if a stran-  ger who had been watching her, had not placed his hand upon her arm, exclaiming, in the rich manly voice that had so long made melody in her heart:  "It is all fiction, Miss Grey, and should be regarded as. such." Cecelia looked up to him, in the vain effort to discern the features of the unknown. She could only get a glimpse of dark wavy hair, and a slender,' graceful form, as he glided from her side. "He is not old," she whispered; "his hair is dark and glossy as the raven's wing, I should judge in this imperfect   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      219 light. How I wish I could learn his name. But why do I take such an interest in this person? Perhaps we shall never meet again." This thought made her more unhappy than before, and the music and  singers were forgotten. The voice of the unknown resounded in her ears and made music in her heart. Edgar shook her as he was about leaving the chapel. "What I asleep, cousin?" he exclaimed; "I did not expect that of you." "No, no I Edgar; not asleep, but thinking," replied Ce- celia. "Thinking!" said Edgar. "Who, pray, has power to com- mand such intense thought, cousin Cecelia?" "I don't know," she replied, blushing. "Ah!" resumed Edgar, "I can guess ; it was the gentleman who gazed so admiringly into the face of my pretty cousin, who was so enchanted with the harmonious voices, of the singers, that she was quite unaware of the dark eyes bent so admiringly upon her. Own up now, Cecelia, are you not fairly caught-caught thinking of that charming young gentle- man-eh, Cecelia?" "Judge not, lest ye be judged," pointing meaningly at his companion, leaning so confidingly upon his arm. "If I might be allowed to guess, I would say, you did not know a word they sung to-night. If you will repeat a line of the poetry, I will own to the accusation!" "I will own that I was very much preoccupied just then," replied Edgar, " and can't remember music like you ladies; besides, I was mostly interested in the Italian piece, which I could not understand." Alice and Mary joined in the merry laugh of Cecelia, which rung out on the evening air. Cecelia bade her friends good night and entered her room. She did not regret having attended the concert ; she had heard  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7463-00000113"/> 220       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE that never to be forgotten voice, and its owner was not unac- quainted with her name. Then why did he so studiously avoid her? He was not unworthy of the acquaintance of any in the land, and still she had never been able to look upon his fea- tures, or learn his name. "He has always addressed me as his inferior 1" she sud- denly and passionately exclaimed; "I will think no more of him. I would go to bed and forget him, if it were not for Emily. That detested creature will be up till midnight, if not sent to her room sooner." A feeling of sorrow involuntarily stole over her. "What have I said," she soliloquized; "Emily detested I oh, forgive me ; this is not as I would be done by. She has herfaults, but she is none the less worthy of love. Halas I I have my faults, which the past hour shows me are not all conquered, after the long and many exertions I have made to that effect." A low rap startled her, and-a familiar voice inquired: "Cecelia, are you alone? If not, come to my room." Cecelia hastened to open the door, and welcomed Alpha Nel- ford. "Dear Cecelia," she exclaimed, "I have come to bid you adieu. Brother Charles is home; he wrote to father, and father went immediately and brought him. I could not go away after all your kindness to me, without first bidding you good bye. You must come and see me at your next vacation. Brother Charles sends you his thanks for the regard you mani- fested towards his unfortunate sister-unfortunate no longer, for papa says I must bury the past and come back to his heart, and nestle there, like the sunbeam in the rose, its warmth, its light, its love. There, give me a kiss, I must away." Cecelia had not spoken a word during all this time, but the last request brought her to her senses. "No, no; not yet, Alpha-don't go yet ; I must talk with you longer. Come, sit down, just here by the fire. When did your brother come for you?"   ;l            XVICISSrIUlDES OF FORTUNE.      221 "To-night," replied Alpha; " we are going back as far as an uncle of ours, about four miles from this place. We shall get there by midnight, and that will be soon enough, for there is a party there, and neither Charles nor myself care much about pleasure parties." "Let me ask," said Cecelia, " was not your brother at tho concert this evening?" "He was," replied Alpha. "Is he not slight in figure?" continued Cecelia. "He is," replied Alpha. "One more question, Alpha; is he old?" resumed Cecelia. "Old!" replied Alpha, laughing heartily ; did I not once tell you that he was just twenty-one on Wednesday last, inqui- sitive? He is old enough to appreciate the favors done his sis- ter; I told him he could not do better than to send his love, but he said his love was claimed by a higher power, and you must accept of his thanks or nothing; for you were beyond the reach of pecuniary benefit, else it might be otherwise. Poor Charles I he will hardly be able to find a companion willing to follow him to the interior of Arabia, where he expects to be called, to whisper the truths of the Bible into the ears of the arrogant, swarthy and cruel Mohammedans." The tears stole to the eyes of the fair girls, as they twined their arms in a parting embrace. "You must often visit me, on my return home," said Cecelia. "And you me," replied Alpha. "Write often," they both whispered, and Alpha glided softly away. Cecelia dropped beside her bed; the tears she had before restrained now coursed freely down her cheeks. - Keep, oh keep him, Heavenly Father, safe from harm I Be -thou his com. panion, his joy, his all ; then he will not be alone in the far-off land to which thou hast called him."

Cecelia arose from her kneeling position, wiped the tears from her face, and commenced looking over her lessons for the succeeding day, while Emily looked mischievously into the face of Cecelia, who was too much occupied to notice her. -   Emily was soon revelling in dreams, from which Cecelia did not care to, arouse her, as she took her place by her side, and it was long after midnight ere she closed her eyes in sleep.

"'With a concert, I have been informed," replied Cecelia; "but I have not heard any of the particulars further." "Yes," resumed Emily ; " but the worst of it is, each young lady is to compose and sing a piece upon the stage. They are to be called on by numbers and after they have all sung their pieces, the spectators will crown the victoress with a wreath of flowers. I wish I might wear the crown ; but that is quite impossible. I could not make a line of poetry to save me, I might say. Alice is to write for me, and she is not very highly gifted as a poetess." Cecelia retired to the little window, and looked out upon the clear azure of the sky, undimmed by the shadow of a cloud, while ten million flashing gems seemed scattered over its broad expanse. As she gazed up, in fancy, she sat by'her chamber window at home; the jasmin bloomed beside her, and her- mother's voice repeated her evening prayer. Thus she stood, till the voice of Emily called her to her senses. With a sigh, she thought, " how little did I prize my mother's watchful care, till deprived of her kind admonitions and her company. I won- der if she will forget the good-night kiss, upon my return home. i^         :^^*  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7463-00000115"/> -2^       CEcELIA GREY; OR, THE Early the ensuing morning, Miss Medla came to Cecelia, and requested her to practice a duet with her for the concert. They repaired to the room of Alice and Miss de Manuel, where it was arranged that they should sing a quartette, in which each of them should bear a part. Mary de Manuel was to sing the tenor, Alice and Miss Medla the alto, while Cecelia sung soprano. Miss Media and Alice were also to sing an Italian duet; and Miss de Manuel, Cecelia and Emily a trio. As Miss Medla tripped lightly away, Cecelia stood for a moment, looking after her, when a servant stepped to the door, with a handful of letters. "This is for Miss Alice Lee; you will hand it to her," he said, giving Cecelia a letter 'for Alice, one for Emily, and another for herself. "A letter for you!" exclaimed Cecelia, opening the door of Alice's apartment, and tossing it to her ; then running away to her own room to read the ever welcome lines traced by her fond mother's hand. She eagerly read the precious words, and with a bound of joy she flew to the room of Alice, who sat alone, weeping bitterly. "Why, Alice "   exclaimed Cecelia, "your letter does not bear the welcome news I had anticipated, else why these tears? I can tell you something which will speedily dry them-Aunt Mary is to marry your Uncle Edgar, who loved you so well. It is the express wish of his children, who will welcome you as a sister ; it was your aunt's wish too ; she loved Aunt Mary so much!" Still Alice wept, if possible, more bitterly than before. Cecelia was alarmed. "What is it, Alice dear?" she exclaimed; " tell me! Aunt Mary is well; sure it was her hand traced your name upon the envelope. Then what cah be the matter with you?" Alice replied not for some moments; then, taking up the open letter, she said : ^   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       225 "Read, Cecelia." Cecelia's eyes traced the lines hastily; they ran thus: "ALICE, MY DEAR CHLD: "I should not have consented to this arrangement, but for my children's sake. It is for your interest to return to the circles from which my imprudence expelled you. My first wish in life is to see my dear children moving in the society which their father so much wished them to grace. If I had con- sulted my own happiness, I should never again make the city my home. Its scenes make my heart bleed with ineffaceable memories. Forgive me, dear one, if I have unintentionally grieved you, and believe me, my children's happiness is the dearest desire of my heart. Prepare yourself to adorn the halls of the rich man's mansion, instead of the village school." "Poor-poor mother!" exclaimed Alice-; " in this arrange- !ment she extinguishes every hope, of happiness I have formed for future life. It was my chief delight-the spur to all my exertions, to be able to support my dear mother, independent of friend or foe, and to enjoy her society through the long vista of years. I had planned for her how many little plea- sures!-how many had I laid up for the future. But time, which changeth all things, has removed those idle dreams from my heart. I have no other way open for me to keep my indepen- dence and freedom, but to fill the place of governess in some family of affluence, who will offer me a remunerative salary for my services. I may, at least, be able to do some good in the world, where my services may be appreciated by others, more needy than myself." "Why, Alice!" exclaimed Cecelia, " there will no longer be any necessity of exertion on your part ; your uncle is waiting to receive you as a daughter.' "Don't-oh I do not pain me by a rehearsal of the proposi- tion so generously offered for my consideration.

Rather would I fill the place of cook in a squatter's cabin I My mother has wronged me by suggesting an idea of such a thing. But remonstrance will be of no avail now. Emily will be delighted when she hears of the betrothals, and Edgar will offer no opposition; he will be proud of the connection. Alas, poor me! there is happiness for all others." "Dear Alice, go home with me and be my sister," said Cece- lia; "you cannot be thought a fortune-hunter in my father's quiet country home, and we shall be so happy together. I have often longed for the society of a kindred spirit. Emily is so wayward, I could never be happy with her. Do promise me, Alice; I shall be so lonely to have you all gone so far away." Alice started to her feet, and pushed the twining arm of Cecelia from her neck.  "Do you ask me to become a dependent in your father's house?" she inquired with flashing eyes. "No I no, Alice i" replied Cecelia, "not a dependent-you should be my companion, my sister, and help me work just as I do." Then the tears welled up to her eyes. "Forgive me," said Alice; "I .have been hasty, I will accept your offer to fill the place of a sister in your heart, and you in mine ; for, Cecelia, 1 can never feel a sisterly confidence in Emily, loving her and pitying her as I do. But I must earn a subsistence for myself; I will not be subject to another while I am blessed with health and an education to provide for myself. Uncle Edgar will not blame me, but do justice in my behalf. I shall repay him everything, my tuition and all, even to the last farthing. Poor mother If I fear she will deprive her- self of the little happiness left her by this sacrifice of her wishes. I know the marriage is disagreeable to her, and it will become a bond of iron from which nothing but death will ever release,   VICISSlTUDES OF FORTUNE.      227 her. It were better if the marriage should never take place." Miss de Manuel returned to the room to learn the reason of Alice's not appearing to recite. Cecelia pressed the hand of Alice, then dropping it, she left the room, and taking the letter of her mother from her pocket, she looked it over again. A postscript, in her father's hand-writing, took her attention ; it read thus : "My dear, you must prepare for an agreeable surprise on your return home. It will be so varied, that I shall not endeavor to give you a hint of its properties." Puzzled and astonished, Cecelia folded the letter, and re- sumed her lessons. Emily came in soon after, and Cecelia called her attention to the letter addressed to her, which lay upon the toilet-table. Emily took it up listlessly, and carelessly removed the envelope, saying: "Now, if mamma would only leave out her entreaties and expostulations, prohibitions and jurisdictions, I would will- ingly forfeit a few leisure moments of uninterrupted anticipa- tion, to a perusal of her wishy-washy vocabulary. But to read this epistle now, I can't just afford to." "Emily!" exclaimed Cecelia, " can you liken your mother's language-the language of her heart--to a worthless, senseless, scrawl? Can you toss with contempt her blessing-perhaps- from you, unread, uncared for?" "Uncared for!" interrupted Emily; " unknown 1-do I not know, the burden of that song? It is, my dear child-my Emily. Then the same story over and over-it is tiresome I I am glad the dear, good soul is well, ana what more do you want; I know she is so, or else she would not have written; but since you think it such a killing affair, I will read the old story to satisfy you, I know it all by heartl so that it will not be much trouble to do so."      &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7463-00000117"/> 228       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE Cecelia watched Emily as she perused line after line of the closely written page. Suddenly she dropped the letter from her hand, and in an ecstasy of delight, danced around the apartment, exclaiming: "My dear, good, blessed mother! I shall be so delighted I She is to be married to Uncle Edgar, and I am to live with them I We shall have the same privileges his own children enjoy. Cecelia I only think I a carriage to make calls with servants to wait upon us-in fact, everything that wealth can procure for our enjoyment I I will learn that haughty, proud cousin of mine, that somebody else is entitled to a, carriage and footman besides her ladyship P" "Why, Emily i" exclaimed Cecelia, "Alice speaks very highly of your Cousin Ada, and of Delphin also. Alice says she is lovely, intelligent, and obliging. Now you call her haughty and proud. One would not think her very amiable to hear your description of her qualities." "It makes no difference what you think," replied Emily, " or any one else. I shall be quite sure to keep on the right side of Uncle Lee, and to do so, I must not offend the daughter. So, you see, I would suffer some little inconvenience to retain the good will of Ada. From her I anticipate no difficulty ; I must, however, hie away to Lilla, and tell her of the new arrangements, in consequence of which I shall be reluctantly compelled to forego my visit to Mr. de Vere's till a more fitting opportunity offers to fulfill my engagement. Oh I it will be so pleasant, living almost within sight of the residence of Miss de Vere's parents I I shall make the most of my acquaintance with her. Ada will not relish the intimacy; she said Lilla de Vere was decidedly'exceptionable ; but we will enjoy our- selves, even at her expense, if we choose 1" "Then," replied Cecelia, "I hope you will not choose to make your cousin miserable. I am well aware of your power to do so, if you feel inclined." "How! pray, are you to take sides with one you have never y   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       229 seen," inquired Emily, "just to gratify a low spite you owe me ? I will soon be in a situation to repay you the little I am indebted to your ladyship or her exacting friends. Uncle Edgar is waiting to call me daughter, and I shall have everything in common with Ada. I wonder what Alice says to the marriage, and new privileges she is to enjoy ?"  " Alice is too noble," said Cecelia, " to accept of a home of luxury and idleness from one upon whom she has no other claim but that of step-daughter. She is grateful to your uncle for his many kindnesses, but would rather her mother would remain single, than become her uncle's wife." i "You do not mean to say," exclaimed Emily, "that Alice will not live with Uncle Edgar, in his beautiful mansion ?" " I do mean," returned Cecelia, " that Alice, after she leaves school, will earn her own livelihood, independent of her wealthy connection." " Impossible 1" said Emily; "she will not disgrace us all I It will be a burning shame, to have a sister that teaches school for a living." " Not half the shame it is for one to become a dependent. No one can love or-respect a drone."  Cecelia said this with more severity than she had ever addressed to Emily before. " Ah 1" returned Emily, " one does not need a microscope to discover your'views of the home my uncle so generously offers me. I suppose you envy me the position I shall in future enjoy, in every way so superior to anything you can assume to. Do not be so bitter against me, I may be of some advantage to my country cousin yet." Thus saying, Emily left the room. For some moments after the door closed on her recedingu form, Cecelia stood proud and indignant, with her eyes flashing, and one little foot pressed with nervous energy upon the carpet. At last she pressed her clasped hands across her forehead, and bent her head upon the cushion of the toilet. "It is just," she exclaimed, raising her eyes streaming with tears.  " It is right. When will I learn to be gentle, to do as &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7463-00000118"/> 230       CECELIA GREY ; OR, THE I would be done by. I provoked Emily to anger, and I might expect an unfeeling and selfish reply." And Cecelia resolved to make no remarks upon the past,- when Emily returned to her. She well knew she would think no more of it, than if nothing of a disagreeable nature had passed between them. Emily came in sooner than Cecelia had expected. Holding up to Cece- lia an advertisement, she exclaimed ; "Lecture bn metaphysics, in the Presbyterian church this evening I Can I go?." "Why I you must ask Mrs. Weston," replied Cecelia. "That is enough, then," said Emily. "I have obtained her consent and yours-I suppose you will accommodate me with a few shillings for the occasion." Cecelia drew her purse from her pocket, and, with a smile, gave her half the contents. "Ah I you are generous, dear--dear Cecelia ; you do love me a little, and I you a great deal. Do go with us to- night.," d"Thank you, Emily; I a9m to pass the evening with- Susan Media. We are to practice a glee.  Mrs. Weston kindly offered to pass an hour with us.  She is a dear good woman.' "I don't like her, or the Principal either ;" replied. Emily, frowning. "Why not, Emily?" inquired Cecelia. "Ah!" replied Emily, "I have a good reason of my own, which I am at liberty to retain." "' I can tell you," exclaimed Miss de, Manuel, coming in just in time to hear the last remark of Emily. "If you know so much, I should think you might keep it to yourself," said Emily. "As you are not the princeps dignag," said Mary, "I shall do as I see fit about complying with your affable request- Miss Ludorph, Cecelia, refused to take Emily into her studio, to learn the art of painting portraits, until she had practised   VICISSITUDES OF FORTU:NE.       231 awhile. Emily would not, like you, first practise with under- teachers. She was sure she would comprehend immediately, and without any effort. Emily went to the Principal, who well knew a raw pupil was the horror of Miss Ludorph. The prin- cipal dignitary-referred Emily to her Latin grammar, which had not been opened for a week at least, and Emily left him in a haff. The Principal only smiled at her sour looks. Since that time, Emily takes every opportunity to manifest her dislike to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.' Emily had taken her bonnet and cloak, and left the room as soon as Mary commenced relating her difficulty with her instructress. "What painting are you to exhibit after the concert, Mary?" inquired Cecelia. "A basket of fruit in water colors," replied Mary. "If I excelled in portrait painting, as you do, I would try to win the prize." "My name is on the artist list," replied Cecelia; " we are a to paint the portrait of Mrs. Weston. The one that gets the most perfect likeness is to receive a medal and chain. Mrs. 4 J Weston sat for an hour this forenoon.

You can see them if you will ask Mrs. Weston," said Mary. "Oh!" exclaimed Cecelia, "I shall see them    after the concert, at the exhibition. The prizes will fill a conspicuous place. The medal and chain are hung in the studio of Miss Ludorph, as a spur to our exertions. Are you to compose music or poetry?" "Neither," replied Miss de Manuel.

Do you know we are to have a Queen to rule at the festival?" "No, Mary, I did not. Who was chosen Queen last year?" inquired Cecelia. "Serena Morton," replied Mary ; "she married a gentleman from the city, an old friend, Herbert Clifford was his- name. By the way-her parents kept her in school; they concluded they were never to be united; and so he came here and they were married irt the little chapel,last fall, soon after vacation. Emily and Miss de Vere are each expecting to wear the floral crown. I shall be sorry to witness their disappointment. They would be rivals if either were chosen Queen, and their friendship would ho longer exist. I almost wish one or the other might succeed." "I do not- think that would break the charm that binds their hearts in one," replied Cecelia, smiling faintly. Mary sighed and turned away. Cecelia, some time after Mary left her, looked out upon the shadowy fields before her. The sun had sunk down behind the tree-tops, and the clouds were all tinged with crimson and gold ; still Cecelia stood by the window with her hands clasped, her eyes upturned and diffused with tears. "Father," she said, and bowed her head, "watch, oh watch over the unknown-the stranger, whose voice has awakened a hidden treasure in my heart I If he wander in foreign lands, wilt thou go with him. If he mourn in solitude or in exile, wilt thou comfort and console him. And, oh, wilt thou put temptation far from him, and keep him good and noble, as when I first listened to the music of his voice, in the sylvan shade of my childhood's home." She still reclined listlessly against the casement, when an arm twined lovingly around her, and a low voice murmured in her ear: "Dear Cecelia." Cecelia started, but returned the kiss Miss Media pressed upon her brow.   Xr          VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       233 Emily had not yet returned, and Susan Media offered to inquire for her in Miss de Vere's apartment. Taking a night lamp in her hand, she passed quickly through the hall, and rapped at the door of the room. Miss de Vere bid her come in, and she found Emily practising a waltz with three or four other young ladies, as wild and inconsiderate as herself. No sooner did they see Susan than they requested her to join them. After circling around a few times, she requested Emily to go back with her to Cecelia. I shan't go back to-night," replied Emily; "I shall stay with Lilla." "You should have told Cecelia; she was alarmed about you." "Alarmed about me I Tell her to take care of herself," replied Emily. "I do not need her superintendence." And she whirled away, as Susan bade them good night. I Miss Medla called at her own room, and telling her room- mate she should pass the night with Miss Grey, she returned to Cecelia, and informed her that Emily was to pass the night with Miss, de Vere, and she had concluded to remain with her. ?.  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7463-00000120"/> 234       CECELrA GREY; OR, THE CHAPTER XXI. FOR the fortnight succeeding, all were busy in preparing for the concert, festival and vacation. Cecelia had written to her father to come a day sooner, so that he might be present at the exercises, and to Miss Nelford also, who had requested her to do so. A bright, cloudless morning, ushered in the first day of May. Slight, graceful forms were seen flitting hither and thither through the halls and corridors, or up and down the stairs of the seminary. Each face wore a look of joyful expectation; or of undefined timidness, mingled with a hopeful look of plea- sure and anticipation." "Who shall be our Queen?" echoed many voices in chorus. "Susan Media!" exclaimed one. "No!" cried another; "it shall be Cecelia Grey." "Not Cecelia I she is not familar enough," said Emily Lee. "Emily Lee shall be our Queen," cried several voices at once. "'No, no!" said Lilla de Vere; "Emily has not been in school long--we should choose some older scholar." "Miss Lilla de Vere for instance," retorted Emily. "Lilla de Vere!" cried many, laughing; "she and Emily shall beat the sceptre." The teachers came forward, inquiring if they had made their choice of a queen? "Yes!" exclaimed several voices at once ; "Susan Media or Alice Lee, or Cecelia Grey." ?    VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       235 :oy i.

"We will ask your'advice when we desire it," replied Mr. Wreston. "We can get along with this difficulty.  Call Alice, we will take her vote, which will decide." Alice came forward saying Susan and Cecelia were each so worthy to wear a crown, she really did not like to take sides against either. Then smiling, she said as Cecelia was very dear to her, she should decide in her favor."- Susan was now called upon to give her vote, either for or against herself. "On one condition I will comply," she replied. "If I may be allowed to bear the news to her gracious majesty, your request is granted." "Noble girl l-hie away to your favorite's bower, and bear messages of loyalty to our sovereign's ear," said Mr. Weston, motioning her away with his hand. Cecelia was thinking of a chain and medal. It would make papa so happy if she could succeed. "For his sake," she solilo- quuized, "I wish I could. - Dear papa, each moment I expect to  be called into the parlor, to meet his loving glance, and his paternal kiss."' A well-known voice filled the hall with its sweet music, singing : "Anld Iamn to be Queen of May, mother- And I am to be Queen of May!" and Susan entered the apartment of Cecelia.  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7463-00000121"/> 236       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE "Dear, dear Susan I Queen of May," exclaimed Cecelia, ris. inug to meet her. As she came forward, saying : "I am so glad! It is just what I wished," Miss Medla advanced with mock gravity, and sunk at her feet, saying: "I am happy to be the first to bow before her majesty." "Stop-stop!" exclaimed Cecelia. "Susan, what do you mean? Not, surely, that Cecelia Grey is chosen Queen of the festivities at Mr. Weston's school I You do not mean so!" "I have come to congratulate you,' replied' Susan, "and bear the message of loyalty from your subjects, who are wait. ing your presence below." When Mr. Grey alighted from his earriage at the hotel in the vicinity of the seminary, his first steps were bent towards the home of his child. As he entered the hall, and heard the loud cries of "Cecelia Grey l" "Cecelia Grey "   his first thoughts were those of terror. His mind pictured her sick or dead, or that some frightful accident had happened to his pre- cious bird. A moment's silence changed his fear to joy. "Cecelia Grey, our Queen of May!- Our Queen of May, Cecelia Grey!" sung a soft voice, as a fairly-like form tripped lightly past him. Mr. Grey was now shown into the parlor; and upon learn- ing his name, Mr. Weston told him to restrain his anxiety to speak with Cecelia for a short time. He then led him into a little room adjoining the one occupied by the busy school-girls. Some of them were twining artificial flowers into a wreath, others raising a throne upon the stage and looping heavy damask curtains from before it. Soon the arrangements were complete, and Cecelia, blushing and trembling with excitement, was led between rows of lovely maidens to a seat upon the throne. Mrs. Weston stood behind the raised seat holding a wreath of lilies twined with myrtles and roses, above her head. Then the girls formed a circle, with joined hands around Ceco- lia, and sung while they danced   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       237 "Cecelia is our chosen Queen, Accept the offering that we bring. Now, as your subjects, all bow down-- Arise and wear the floral crown." Suiting the action to the words, they sunk together around their Queen, and as they did so, Cecelia arose, and Mrs. Wes- ton placed the crown upon her brow. The teachers now played and sung an appropriate piece in honor of the Queen, after which leach advanced to the foot of the throne, and kneeled to kiss the hand of the sovereign. As the last head pillowed its glossy curls upon the cushions and moved away, a familiar face looked up to her from the humble position. Quick as thought, Cecelia sprung from her seat and placing her father upon the throne, sunk her crowned head upon the low cushions before him. ' Long live your majesty!" went up from the lips of one and all, as they saw the occupant of the throne. Mr. Grey placed his daughter upon the throne, and expressed his pleasure at this token of their regard which her schoolmates had bestowed upon her. Then, while the teardrops welled up to his eyes, he addressed Cecelia: "My child," he exclaimed, "I cannot express the joy, the happiness this token of [lifting the crown from her brow] your goodness, of your worthiness, and the estimation in which your young friends hold you, has conferred upon me. I can safely say that this is the proudest, the happiest hour of my life. hIay you, Cecelia, ever walk in the path you have so faithfully followed thus far, winning the respect and love of the good and noble of your acquaintances, and at the same time progressing towards the joys of the upper and better world, where roses shall bloom without the thorn, and the daythe undimmed by the hours of darkness." Cecelia buried her face in her father's bosom, while tears coursed fast down her cheeks. - ', '^        &#xD;<pb n="238" xml:id="VAC7463-00000122"/> 238       CECELIA GREEY; OR, THlE Mr. Weston informed Mr. Grey of the evening arrangements, and invited him to be present at the festival. Cecelia then accompanied her father to the parlor, there to answer and make inquiries of the past and of the future.  The time seemed very short to Mr. Grey, ere the bell called them to the supper-table. He then returned to the hotel where he had left his carriage. As the twilight deepened into darkness, carriages and pedes- trians were seen taking their way towards the seminary, where all were on the tiptoe of expectation. To Cecelia each scene was one of rare novelty. After the guests had all arrived the pupils and teachers were assembled in the chapel, where the concert was to be held. -The young ladies were dressed in snowy white, their hair confined with ribbons and white roses, with the exception of Emily Lee and Lilla- de Vere, who wore bands of pearls, with leaves of myrtle twined with white rosebuds. After the concert, the guests reassembled in the school- room, to hear the glees, songs etc., composed by the pupils. The curtains hung in heavy folds around the stage, and were looped back after .each new comer had taken her place there. Miss de Manuel, Alice Lee, Cecelia and Susan Medla, sung a quartette with muchskill and sweetness; after which Cecelia with Susan sung a duet, in which each of the voices were justly admired and eulogized. The harp was then placed. upon the stage, and the assembly requested to pay marked attention- to the music and the merit of each piece as sung by the com- poser. All the ladies had sung who had written for the occa- sion, with the exception of Cecelia and her cousin Alice Lee; when a ballad, by Miss Alice Lee, was called for. Alice seated herself by the harp with a slight blush tinging her brow and cheek ; but it passed away, and the soft voice of the songstress at first came tremulously to the ear: "List, mother! the storm is raging O'er the dark, deep sea;   'I  . -                                  i  &#xD;<pb n="Illustration-239" xml:id="VAC7463-00000123"/> THE curtains were drawn back, and Cecelia, pale and motionless, bent over the harp. There was one heart that beat tumultuously at the sight of her sweet young face-one that listened with a deeper interest than had before been perceptible, as he brushed the dark hair fhom his lofty brow, and reclined his head to catch the faintest note.-P Gu 239.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.        239 I fear my much loved brother Can ne'er return to me." Then a bird-like prelude, so mournful, so low, like the moans of the wind when it dies away in the forests, came from the harp.  For a moment after she had ceased playing, the audience seemed spell-bound ; then a murmur of approbation came from the listening throng. The curtain was down and each eye turned towards the stage, when "Lines addressed to a Young Missionary, by Miss Grey," was announced. The curtains were drawn back, and Cecelia, pale and motion- less, bent over the harp. There was one heart that beat tumultuously at the sight of her sweet. young face-one that listened with a deeper interest than had before been percepti- ble, as he brushed the dark hair from his lofty brow, and inclined his head to catch the faintest note. Cecelia commenced, like Alice, in a low, soft voice; from a pianissimo, to a fortissimo, which died away in a diminuendo, so bird-like-so clear, that the company forgot to applaud, for fear they might lose a note. She sung thus : "They tell me that you go alone, To traverse the burning sands; They tell me that you go, alone Where tigers prowl and lions roam, To publish God's commands. Yet, not alone; ah! never-nay, My heart thy company keeps, And when in weariness you pray, I'll kneel with you at dawn of day, And know my spirit weeps.

"Yet, never in thy youthful mind, Have selfish motives risen, To claim another not designed, And ties of friendship on them bind, To make the desert Heaven. "Farewell-farewell, and never dream Of her whose thoughts oft stray Through forests green, by purling streams, And deserts where the bright sunbeams, O'er moving mountains play." As the last line came back to the ear, in a low repeat, all held their breath, as if afraid a motion might destroy the effect of the music. The curtain fell amid the loud huzzas of the delighted audience. Yet, there were two amid the throng that forgot to cheer-Mr. Grey, and a slight, intellectual looking young man. They were occupying back seats not far from each other, the- least observed, and the most observing. A lady who sat beside the youth, placed one hand in his, and whispered, while the tears glistened in her dark eye : "Why not applaud, Charles?   Is not that an affecting piece for us? I will secure a copy; Cecelia will not deny me. Ah I I hope you will never go away into the midst of Arabia alone; Cecelia has not done justice to the subject. She has never seen-you, or I would think the lines addressed to you. But that cannot be, for she supposes you to be many miles from this place. I had written her to that effect. Why not secure her for a companion ere you leave your native land?" "Can   you ask why, Alpha?" replied   the young man addressed as Charles. "The song has told you why: 'To claim another, not designed, Anld ties of friendship on them bind.'"   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.'       241 "Ah yes," resumed the lady, " but you must remember : 'I would gladly leave my gilded toys, The pleasures that my spirit cloys, All dangers with thee dare.'" "You know I am not going at present," replied the young man. "Father thinks I had better study a year longer." "Let me introduce you to Miss Grey, brother," said the lady. "Not now," replied the gentleman. The curtain again parted from before the stage. This time Cecelia received the chain and medal; after which a variety of wax fruits and flowers were exhibited, and   the prize was awarded to iiss de Manuel. The curtains were again folded around the stage, and when looped back, Cecelia stood like a marble statue among the evergreens and flowers, beside a throne, covered with cloth of crimson and gold.  Two young ladies parted the foliage from her side, and advanced towards her, when a third stepped behind  the raised seat with a wreath formed of jasmin. blossoms and laurel. The two first mentioned ladies (who were Alice Lee and Mary de ManueD led her to the throne, and seating hereupon it, Susan Media placed the crown upon her brow.   Cecelia trembled, as with queenly grace she received her subjects, who knelt before her. At last one came, with dark wavy hair, and an eagle's eye. He knelt before her, and pressed for an instant her gloved hand to his lips; then his eyes for a moment rested in hers. No sound issued from his parted lips, while Cecelia waited with painful intensity for the deep tones of the musical voice that had long dwelt in the recesses of her heart. But he only turned away, and she saw him no more that night. The time seemed long to Cecelia before she was allowed to descend from her elevated and envied station, and to mingle with the assembled company. "    &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7463-00000125"/> 242       CECELIA GREY; ORB THE After passing absently through the rooms, to learn, if possi- ble without inquiry, the name of the gentleman who had taken her pleasure from the crowded halls, she reclined against the casement of the window, and looked out into the darkness. A short time passed thus, when a familiar voice addressed her with : "Cecelia Grey I I have found you at last, after searching everywhere, with the exception of this dark corner." Cecelia started, confused, when she looked into the face of Alpha Nelford. ' Dear Alpha!" she exclaimed; "this is indeed a surprise. I had not the most remote idea of seeing you this-evening." "I am aware of that," replied Alpha. "Don't you think I can comprehend the moral of your song?" Cecelia trembled and blushed crimson. "Why, Alpha," she said, " it was but a passing thought- can there be a moral?" "Perhaps not," replied Alpha. "If you are weary of this crowd, let us go up to your room; I would like to talk with you." Cecelia drew the arm of her friend through her own, and they ascended the broad stairway to the hall above. "Ah, Cecelia, how unhappy I was when we ascended these stairs a few months since," said Alpha. "You were uncon- scious of the consolation you then bestowed. If it lay in my power, I would express the gratitude I feel towards you. I wish you were acquainted with Brother Charles. Charles says he will seek an introduction after -you leave school; at present it would be better to not burden your mind with too many new acquaintances." "Did your brother attend you hither to-night?" inquired Cecelia, carelessly opening the door to her room and setting a chair for Alpha. "Yes, he did," replied Alpha. "Charles was very anxious to attend, and would have done so, even if I had not. Papa   VICISSITUDES ObF FORTUNE.       243 will send him to school another year, at Yale College. He will stay there until he graduates. I believe papa thinks more of Charles for the longr time he absented himself from him. He said I did perfectly right in not obeying his unreasonable demands when he bade me tell him where Charles had secreted himself. But it was in the heat of the contest-about the time of election, and he needed the assistance of my brother very much, although unwilling to say so. Charles returned in time to meet his wishes. It will be some two or three years before Charles will be called away. The presbytery or Board of I Missions wishes him to learn the Arabian language perfectly, and prepare himself to labor in the field left vacant by the return of the Rev. Mr. Goodly. He has written to the effect that his health was poor, and he should not be willing to labor in that place longer than was necessary to fit some one to continue the good work begun. His wife went with him to that wild region. She must be bold -and fearless to be the first lady to go among those cruel people. Think you not so, Cecelia?" "The Lord is just as able to protect her there, as in the most quiet place of our civilized land," replied Cecelia. After conversing a short time, Alpha prepared to descend to the hall; she was fearful her brother might be awaiting for her, as he anticipated leaving at an early hour. "Now," thought Cecelia, "I shall hear him speak and see her brother ; then I shall know of a certainty whether the voice that thrilled me in that moonlight grove and Charles Nelford are one, as I took them to be." Alpha led Cecelia through the halls and parlors, but her brother could not be found. "Strange!" exclaimed Alpha; "Charles must purposely avoid us ; itis just like him." Cecelia dropped the arm of Alpha, saying, "I must return to the parlor or papa will not know what has become of me.  Good night, Alpha, come and see me when I  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7463-00000126"/> 244       CECELIA GREY; 0o, THE get home-good-night ;" and Cecelia turned away. She went into the parlor in search of Mr. Grey, and not finding him there, took a seat near the door. She had sat but a few moments  when a boy handed her a note, and turned away. Cecelia hastened to her room, and with a trembling hand unfolded the hastily written note, in pencil mark, so light as to scarcely be intelligible by the dim light of her lamp. It read thus: "MSS CECELIA GREY : "I would, if it were an appropriate time, tender you my thanks, personally, for all the kindnesses you have shown my sister. At some future time I may claim the privilege of an old friend to your acquaintance, in the name of my sister, Alpha Nelford. Till then bear in remembrance "CHARLES NELFORD Y "Strange--strange i" exclaimed Cecelia. i"Ought I to show this note to papa? I suppose I should never keep any secret from my parents. Wellt I will carelessly drop it some- where on my return home. Then papa or mamma will find it, and I shall not show it to them. 'At some future time claim the privilege of an old friend, in the name of my sister, Alpha Nelford.' If he had only spoken those words instead of writing'them, the mystery would have been solved. If I could but once hear his voice!-yet, I believe Charles Nelford and the possessor of that never to be forgotton voice are one." Cecelia then arranged her hair, and descended to the parlor, where she found her father waiting for her. Mr. Grey was proud of his only child, as he led her among his friends and former acquaintances, and presented'her to their notice. Her free, unembarrassed air, and frank, cordial smile, brought many a word of congratulation to the happy father.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       245 "Where is Emily?" inquired Mr. Grey. "I have not spoken with her since I arrived here." "She is doubtless with Miss De Vere," replied Cecelia, "shall I have her come down?" "Yes," said Mr. Grey; "go bring her, for it is getting late, and I wish her to be ready to start at an early hour, on the morrow. I know you will not keep me waiting, and I would charge her to be ready." As Cecelia left him, Mr. Grey addressed Edgar. "you and Alice will not keep me," he said ; "I shall be pleased with your society and Miss De Manuel's," addressing Mary De Manuel. "She must favor us with her society, for we should be sorry to miss her from our entertainment. You were Mrs. Grey's favorite, you know, Mary l Miss De Manuel blushed, and looked for Edgar to answer for her. Edgar replied that Miss De Manuel was to return home that vacation. Her father had written to have Alice and himself her escort, and she would not return to the school again. "When I again visit the North," said Miss De Manuel, "I will not forget the kindness of Mr. and Mrs. Grey." Cecelia looked for some time after Emily, in the rooms below, and then ascended the stairs, and passed through the hall to the room of Miss De Vere.   "Only to think (she heard through the door of the room, which was partially open) Cecelia Grey to be chosen Queen. I was never more astonished, but I would not mention it to any one else, she being my cousin. I suppose she expected me to congratulate her." Cecelia would not play the eves-dropper, and she rapped at the door immediately. Miss De Vere answered rudely, " come in here, never fear, walk right in, my little dear." Cecelia had no idea of entering the apartment, and repeated the rap, when Emily came to the door. Cecelia coldly received her deceitful cousin, and telling her that Mr. Grey wished to speak with her, and she would find  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7463-00000127"/> 246       CECELIA GREY; OR, TIIE him in the parlor, she turned away and left her to descend the stairs alone. Emily stepped lightly through the hall and downi the stairs, and with a warm smile extended her hand to her uncle, with the words - "Dear uncle, I am so happy to congratulate you that my dear cousin has been so fortunate.  No one knows better than I how worthy she is of the marked honorI shown her." Mr. Grey -thanked Emily for the compliment she bestowed upon Cecelia, who unobserved, stood near them, having stolen softly down before Emily. After a few more words, Mr. Grey told Emily to be ready to start at an early hour, for he wished to get home before dark. Emily said he should not be kept waiting; and without a word to Alice or Edgar, returned to her Lillian, as she termed Miss De Vere.             -       * Cecelia forbore mentioning to her father the conversation she had heard between Miss De Vere and Empily, and she bade him good night. Alice and Miss De Manuel also left the room, and the guests one by one stole away, until Cecelia found her- self sitting almost alone in the deserted room. Suddenly the thought of Susan Medla aroused her; she had promised to meet her in her room at soon as convenient, and she has- tened up stairs to the apartment of her friend. "You have come at last," exclaimed Susan, leading her for- ward and closing the door. "You do not know, how long and impatiently I have waited for you." Cecelia knew not what to say; for had she not forgotten, actually forgotten, her engagement, while Susan was counting the moments of her absence. "We shall be many miles apart by to-morrow evening, Ce- celia," resumed Miss Medla. "You will not forget, when wan- dering through the sylvan groves of your country home, the   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       247 friend of your early school days. If I return to this school next term-which I expect I shall, if it would be agreeable to you, I would be pleased to room with you. As Miss De Vere tells me that Miss Emily Lee has engaged to room with her, you will not be compelled to say nay." "Oh I Ishould be so happy," replied Cecelia, "if we can only room together. I shall not dread school- life as I have done heretofore. I have got to bid Alice and Miss De Manuel good bye, and must leave you now. Write often, Susan, and don't forget in your city home, your country schoolmate, who owes to you much of the happiness she has enjoyed during the first six months of her school life. I will, if possible, visit you during the vacation-it may be convenient. If I visit the city, will you reeurn and spend a few weeks with me? I will come for you, if my mother will let me." "Ah!" replied Susan, "I should be delighted to do so. Be sure and come; good bye-good bye." "i  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7463-00000128"/> -:0       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE CHAPTER      XXII. AT an early hour, Cecelia arose, and not having seen Alice and Edgar the evening previous, she descended the stairs to take leave of them. "We have waited for you," said Miss De Manuel, advancing to meet her. "We knew you would not neglect the parting kiss," said Edgar, as he   stole slily behind her. Cecelia owned the correctness of these remarks, and then looked for Emily. "Ah!"Alice exlaimed ; " dear Cecelia, you must not expect Emily to discommode herself. Emily is unfortunately too sel- fish to regard others, any further than they prove of benefit to her." And she dashed aside a tear, as she said, "stay a moment, Edgar ; if Emily will not come, I cannot part with her thus." "She must be asleep," whispered Cecelia; "she would not so neglect you." "Yes I that is it," exclaimed Edgar; "I too will bid my dear little pet adieu." A moment more and he stood with Alice by the door of Emily's apartment. Alice- trembled and with :difficulty pressed back the tears, which came   so unwillingly from her wounded heart. Ed- gar rapped quickly, and a  pettish voice answered--" come in."  Edgar advanced a  step into the room, when Alice stepped quickly past him, and without heeding the presence of Miss   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      249 De Vere wound her arms around the neck of Emily and burst into tears. Emily, who was dressed with the most scrupulous exactness, tore herself rudely from her weeping sister, and protested she hated scenes, and she would like to know what had- turned up now, of such wonderful importance that she must make such a muss of her hair which she had taken so much pains to arrange satisfactorily. Alice stood speechless with astonishment and sorrow. Her tears were all gone, and like a statue she gazed upon her incon- siderate sister'; while Emily, pouting, took down the heavy braids of her hair and removed a sister's gift from among its glossy folds. Edgar was mute with surprise and anger. After a. moment he stepped one step forward to Alice's side, and drawing her to the door, he silently walked away. Not so with Alice ; she turned a lingering look upon Emily, and whispered faintly, " good bye, sister ;" and Emily mockingly repeated, "good bye." Cecelia knew that something of an unpleasant nature had transpired between the brother and sisters, and by her lively sallies and assiduous attentions strove to make them forget what had passed. The old fashioned stage coach rolled to the door, and Edgar assisted the porter in placing the baggage upon the top. Mean- while Mr. Grey had noticed the absence of Emily, and sent her word to come down immediately. Emily quickly complied with his imperious command, and Miss De Vere followed her. "Your wishes, uncle Arthur?" exclaimed Emily, smiling, as she dropped a courtesy by his side. "My wishes are,"  Mr. Grey replied, "that you show proper regard for your friends.  You do not consider that this may be the last opportunity you may have to do so." "'  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7463-00000129"/> 250       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE Emily stepped forward and shaking Alice by the hand gave her a kiss and good bye. The same to Miss De Manuel, and then offered her hand to her brother who sorrowfully refused the proffered salute. "Forgive her," whispered Alice, and the appeal found another peti ioner in the dark orbs of his betrothed. He snatched the hand of Emily, pressed a kiss upon her brow, with "Good bye, Emily," and handed Miss De Manuel and Alice to a seat in the stage, took a hurried leave of Mr. Grey and Cecelia, and sprang in after them, and the old coach rat- tled quickly away. "Now, my children," said Mr. Grey,l "throw on your shawls, and I will have the carriage here in five minutes, and you must be all ready to step into it." Cecelia tripped up stairs, stole 4 hasty view of the fine fields and lofty hills from the open window, took a parting view of her apartment, wherein she had passed so many weary hours. Then hastened to the side of Miss Media, who held out her arms to her young friend with many a kiss, and wished her good bye as they descended to the foot of the stairs. Thus had those two minds, so congenial, met and loved, only to be separated. The noble inspiration, the lofty sentiment of each had found a response in the heart -of the other. The sleeping, dreaming reality, so hard to be expressed, was felt and known to each. No wonder, then, that they shrunk from the separation which should part them, perhaps forever. Mr. Grey drove to the door, and the porter placed Cecelia's trunk in the carriage. Then Cecelia took the parting kiss, and exchanged rings with Miss Medla,. who followed her to the carriage. When Miss Medla returned to the room, now so lonely to her, she was more disheartened than she had ever been before in her life. Cecelia had not thought of Emily till Mr. Grey inquired why she was not there.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       251 "I don't know, indeed, papa," Cecelia replied; then hesitat- ing, resumed, " shall I go and see?" "Yes-no," replied Mr. Grey. "Here, waiter, tell Miss Emily Lee I am waiting for her." The waiter returned in a short time, saying : "Miss Lee has not finished packing her trunk; she is hurry- ing as fast as possible, your honor." Mr. Grey, for once, felt it an effort to control the anger that burned in his heart, at such disregard of his wishes, from one upon whom he had showered so many favors.  The sun would appear above the craggy rocks in a short timae. The heat would make it more comfortable for them, to be sure, but not so for his favorite horses, and he must drive slow, and Mrs. Grey would be compelled to wait many an anxious hour, ere she folded Cecelia to her heart. After waiting a full half hour, Emily appeared with her favorite by her side, and the porter bearing her heavy trunk, which contained, besides her own ward- robe, much of her sister's, and not a little of Mary De Manuel's, who, indeed, gave her indiscriminately whatever she chose to possess; of shawls, gloves, veils, etc., she had secured a great supply ; and Cecelia, from not having made any purchases since leaving home, after staying two terms in succession, pre- sented a rather shabby appearance by the side of her richly attired cousin. Mr. Grey observed this, and so did Emily, who said quickly: "Uncle Arthur, you must excuse my attire. Cecelia is not as partial to appearances as I am." Mr. Grey burst into a laugh, in spite of his vexation, as the incidents of the morning passed quickly through his mind. ".Ah 1" exclaimed Emily, languidly; " my uncle chooses to be in a merry mood. Good bye, dear Lillian; do not fail to write me often-good bye." Emily reclined listlessly against the side of the carriage for a few moments, and then inquired the particulars respecting the union of her mother and uncle.  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7463-00000130"/> 252       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE Mr. Grey expressed his astonishment at the marriage taking place at all. For his part, he thought it would be more for their happiness to live single ; and if Mr. Lee wished, and it was agreeable to Mrs. Lee, she could oversee his household. "That -would not give the children," replied Emily, "the right of freedom that they will enjoy after the marriage. My mother, I am told, was once the leader of the fashion." "Fie! for shame, Emily; you know not what you say," returned Mr. Grey. "Your mother will never again enter the giddy circles of fashion and dissipation. To be sure, it was for her children's sake, that she consented to this union. Your father regretted the necessity which would compel his children to endure hardships and deprivations which to the wealthy are unknown. But to fashion, and the follies of wealth and extrava- gance, he had no desire his children should be initiated. No one has told you the misery and ruin a love of dissipation and display has brought upon your family, or you would be wise enough to heed the lesson so harshy taught." As the clock struck twelve, they saw the hotel at which they had dined six months previous, a short distance in advance. "Well done, ponies," said Mr. Grey, patting the reeking sides of the horses. "Forty miles is good fast travelling," he soliloquized. Cecelia and Emily had stepped from the carriage; the first to take a stroll in the garden, and shake off her fatigue-the last to contemplate the luxury of a savory dinner, the rich odor of which was wafted through the hall, into the little sitting-room, where she was soon cozily seated. Soon after, Mr. Grey entered the room, and taking his place in a large arm-chair, he waited for the return of Cecelia. At last he aroused Emily from her reveries, and inquired if she was tired. "To death P"Emily replied, " and hungry as a tiger withal. There is Cecelia, she was never hungry or tired, I believe ; she was no sooner in the house than she started for the garden to shalke off weariness, as she said."   "Where is the garden?" inquired Mr. Grey. "Oh  I don't know," replied Emily., "somewhere about here ; a very fine one, Cecelia said; I am not as observing as Cecelia-and-besides; I have no curiosity in that respect. Only let me rest when weary, it is all the enjoyment I desire." "Well," exclaimed Mr. Grey, " a run in the garden would do you good, after riding so far." "Doubtless, uncle, it is good advice, but I don't think I shall profit by it. I am very comfortably situated." "As I feel some of Cecelia's curiosity," resumed Mr. Grey, i "to view what charms nature and art may possess, I shall fol- low her example." "What nonsense," soliloquized Emily, after her uncle had closed the door. "If Uncle Arthur was not a farmer, I would say he was a fool. I wish- I were safe in my step-father's mansion. How I would call up the envy of my pink of a cousin." Mr. Grey came in with Cecelia, and the trio proceeded to the dining-room, where the variety of fare satisfied even the fastidious epicure, Emily. :    s . *  .  * '   *    *   4    *    * Again they resumed their journey. Thirty-five miles, over hills and through valleys, would bring them to Greenwood. Cecelia was refreshed and glad to resume her seat in the car- riage. Not so with Emily; she reclined upon Cecelia, and declared she should never be able to endure the fatigue of so long a ride ; and instead of enjoying the charming and varied scenery, she complained and murmured, to the evident discom- fort of Mr. Grey. In this uncomfortable manner they travelled till the dusk of the evening gathered slowly around them. Cecelia had become fatigued and looked anxiously for a glimpse of the lofty pop- lars under whose shade she had gambolled in childhood. Mrs. Grey had the table adorned with the snowy cloth, and the new tea-set she had purchased expressly for Cecelia set out            n    .  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7463-00000131"/> 254       CECTTA GREY; OR, THE to the best advantage. And in the sitting-room stood the open piano, with every arrangement calculated to make home attrac- tive. For a long time Mrs. Grey watched and lingered by the door, ere the carriage crossed the smooth lawn, and passed around the house to the door. -Cecelia sprung lightly to her mother's arms, and Mr. Grey, laughing, told her to be careful and not smother a queen, while Mrs. Grey was most thankful to welcome her child in per- fect health to her home again. Emily was really quite ill, and instead of enjoying a warm supper, she was obliged to retire, and Mr. Grey sent Patrick to the village for a physician. The physician arrived, and administer- ing some soothing medicines, gave directions that if she was no better in the morning, to send for him again. "It is just as I expected," exclaimed Mr. Grey impatiently, when Mrs. Grey rehearsed the doctor's statement of the case. "That girl will not only make herself miserable, but every one with whom she may be on terms of intimacy. I don't know what will become of her, if she -does not mend her ways. I wonder how Cecelia could live so long as she has with her." "Oh!" exclaimed Cecelia, "as long as I could furnish her with pocket-money it was very pleasant, although she would have her fits of dejection occasionally." "I imagine," said Mr. Grey, "Mr. Edgar Lee will not find it so pleasant a task taking care of his deceased brother's child- ren, as he anticipates. I almost wish Emily would remain sick long enough to save her mother the additional trouble of her whims on her wedding day." !"Arthur 1" exclaimed Mrs. Grey, " do not speak of that; you know how painful it is for me to contemplate my sister's future marriage. If Mary would only have consented to re- main with us, her children would have found a welcome home. If not as elegant as Edgar Lee's, as good as she enjoyed in her earliest years." After Cecelia had been shown her new piano, and the various   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       255 little presents provided for her, with which she was overjoyed with gratitude, she bid her parents " good night," and descended to her little room. Mr. Grey gave his daughter the good-night kiss, and Mrs. Grey followed her up stairs. "I must see how Emily is, mamma," said Cecelia, and to- gether they entered her apartment. They found Emily much better, and the faithful Mary watching over her. "Is Emily any better," inquired Cecelia. "Yes, ma'm," replied Mary; " she is much better, I think, and sleeps sweetly." "Are you to watch alone to-night?" inquired Cecelia. "Well, yes-no," said Mary, coloring and stammering. "Ah!" said Cecelia, "I see ; you have kept that lock of Patrick's hair I gave you last fall." "Yes-thank you," replied Mary, "and forever shall. It was the greatest treasure you ever gave me, Mfiss Cecelia. Mrs. Grey reminded Cecelia that it was getting late, and she night, and left her alone. -Cecelia first took a view of the new arrangements in her apartment, and was particularly pleased with a new wardrobe, in which were placed several new dresses. She next took a peep into her dressing bureau, where she found a new shawl, a lovely spring hat, and a sum of money, which her father wished her to use in a manner the most agreeable to her. She also found gloves, ribbons, pins, canvas and floss, twist and beads. "Well done, papa!" exclaimed Cecelia; "you don't mean your pet shall be idle, for among all these useful articles I don't , find one book with which to while away an hour. Well, I will work papa a pair of fireside slippers, and mamma some sofa pillows-that will occupy me for the present at least." Cecelia now bowed in'secret prayer ; then calmly sought her pillow, and sleep soon wrapped her in its invigorating em- brace.  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7463-00000132"/> 256       CECFTRTA GREY; OR, THE Early the ensuing morning she arose, and dressing quickly, repaired to the apartment of Emily. She"found her almost well, and already planning an excursion to the lake, for her amusement. She thought that Patrick might take them in a light carriage to the cross road, and from there they could go on foot to the little outlet where lay the boat ready to obey the inclination of the idle or curious who might take a fancy to risk -themselves in so frail a bark. Cecelia listened to the plan, but said she feared her father could not well spare Patrick, as it was a busy season with far- mers. "Of course," replied Emily, "I might have known there would have been an objection in' the way. I shall die with ennui before the time set for my mother's arrival?" "I will walk over to the lake with you," said Cecelia, "if mamma is willing, and you feel strong enough." "We will walk, then," returned, Emily. "Come help me to dress, or I shall not be ready fort breakfast." Ceceiia complacently complied with this new request, but felt somewhat annoyed, not knowing how to please her excitable cousin. After a long time, Emily was arrayed to suit her fancy, and good naturedly walked down stairs with Cecelia. As they entered the sitting-room the piano received Emily's notice. "Uncle Arthur Grey!" she  exclaimed, "where did this beauty come  from, and who is it for? Not for -Cecelia:? Really I am  quite jealous H will assure you, envious. If- I did not know  Uncle Edgar had one for me in his parlor, I would never forgive you. What beautiful carving I and then the initials of your name as I live, Cecelia. With your leave, I will just run my fingers over the keys, before breakfast; it will give me an appitite." Emily had regained her spirits, and chatted, laughed, and sung,.so that her uncle began to think they had done her in- justice.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       257 Cecelia enjoyed with wonder this new phase in her cousin's life. She knew not that Emily was an actress, and had learned the art of deception from one schooled from her earliest years to act from circumstances instead of reality. After breakfasting, Emily and Cecelia took a stroll through the house, admiring the new furniture and the taste of its arrangement. Cecelia began to think, and not without reason, there was no other person in the world had such kind, thought- ful parents, or so happy a home as had she. After dining, they strolled away to the little lake, where Mrs. Lee, then Mary Clermont, drew her little protege from the water. ' Here," exclaimed Cecelia, " your mother drew the mother of Mary L. de Manuel from  the arms of death; behold her reward." "I never knew she ever received any   reward," returned Emily. "No reward, Emily i has she not won the sincere gratitude and affection of Mrs. de Manuel?" said Cecelia. "Has she not time and again solicited her to come with her children, and share her home and wealth? Did not your mother receive a thousand dollars from an unknown scource?" "Well, what then?" exclaimed    Emily; "it is no sign, because mother received a thousand dollars, that it came from Mrs. de Manuel. It doubtless was a debt or money due father. Miss Cecelia Grey, we owe the mother of Mary de Manuel no debt of gratitude." Cecelia made no reply, but contented herself with plucking the early flowers, singing snatches of wild songs, or gazing down into the clear water of the -little woodland lake. Cecelia had gathered flowers to fill her vases, and turned her footsteps homeward, while old Tiger lazily followed after them. When Cecelia entered the gate, the neatly attired and happy faced Mary Malcolm welcomed her. "You have come   at last, Miss Cecelia?  Ma'm Grey said you must make a sponge cake and a pan of biscuit for tea."  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7463-00000133"/> 258       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE "Certainly, if mamma wishes it, after I have put my flowers in water," returned Cecelia. "You must do that afterwards," persevered the faithful girl. "But they will wilt-die!" exclaimed Cecelia. "It is late now," said Mary. "I have waited some time for you. Cannot Miss Emily put them in water?" Emily took the flowers with reluctance from Cecelia, and laying them upon the sofa in the sitting-room, forgot them. Cecelia, in compliance with her mother's request, immediately proceeded to assist in preparing tea. When tea was ready, and Cecelia went to look for her flowers she had so choicely selected, she found them wilted and worthless through the neglect of her cousin. This evidence of thoughtlessness on the part of Emily pained the sensitive Cecelia, and almost brought tears to her eyes. But she forced them back, and called her father and mother to tea. "Now, father, I want you to praise my cooking," she said. "You been cooking?" inquired Mr. Grey. "Yes, taking lessons against the time of need. Mamma thinks it necessary, and I don't doubt it." "A good idea," exclaimed Mr. Grey; "carry it out-you will never regret it." Mrs. Grey smiled at the earnestness of the remark, and praised the cake, which pleased Mary quite as much as Cecelia. After tea they repaired to the sitting-room ; Emily to the piano, Cecelia and Mrs. Grey to their needles, and Mr. Grey to his favorite arm-chair. Patrick came in soon after with a letter for Cecelia. Cecelia eagerly broke the seal, and read as follows: "DEAREST FRIEND : "I am coming to pass, a week with you. My brother has gone South for his health, he will have a charge there till sent   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       259 abroad. I cannot tell you how glad I am that he is not going now. I will be'with you to-morrow, and expect you to return home with me.          "Ever yours, "ALPHA NELFORD." Cecelia's first thought was one of regret that Emily was stay- ing with her. She was so selfish, Cecelia was afraid she would disgust Miss Nelford, and make her visit an unpleasant one. Handing the note to her mother, Mrs. Grey made her describe minutely their acquaintance. This done, Cecelia placed the note from Charles Nelford in her mother's hand. Mrs. Grey read with attention the lines traced within ; but made no-remark as she returned the note to Cecelia. She did not wish to find fault where she could see none. The tone was respectful and grateful, she did not wish to commend it or its author to Cecelia. Cecelia planned many excursions of pleasure for the gratifica- tion of her young friend ere sleep visited her eyes, and the ensuing morning she was up with the sun, and before called to the breakfast table had filled the vases with fresh flowers, dusted the furniture, opened the blinds, and threw an air of extreme neatness, ease and comfort-throughout the house. Emily, meanwhile, adjusted her curls, looked over her ward- robe, and took a novel--a parting gift from her dear Miss de Vere-to while away the time till dinner, or Cecelia's young friend arrived. Cecelia sat by the open window of the sitting-room, seemingly busy with her embroidery, but in reality watching for the car- riage which should bring Miss Nelford. "Two o'clock," she murmured wearily, " and Alpha not come yet. I don't believe she will come to-day." As if in reply to her, she heard a carriage coming in the dis- tance. A moment more and it came within sight. As the carriage stopped, Alpha Nelford alighted from it, and Cecelia crossed the- lawn to meet her.  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7463-00000134"/> 260       CERITTTA GREY; OR, THE Mr. Grey bade Patrick convey Miss Nelford's trunk up stairs and Cecelia introduced her young friend to her mother, then seated her comfortably, took her hat and shawl, and endeavored to make her feel at home with them. The first restraint Miss Nelford, as a stranger, had expe. rienced, had scarcely worn off, when Emily, dressed, combed, curled and perfumed, entered the parlor. Cecelia presented Miss Nelford to her acquaintance, but her presence threw a chill over Cecelia, which she tried in vain to throw off. Emily was dressed so much beyond either Miss Nelford or herself, and altogether so out of place, that she was annoyed, in spite of every effort to the contrary. Miss Nelford, too, felt uneasy and embarrassed. At the tea table, Mr. Grey, with his natural keenness of per- ception, instantly understood the situation of the young friends; while Emily chatted on, not caring or troubling herself to know whether her conversation might be pleasing or otherwise to her companions. After leaving the dining-room, Mr. Grey requested Miss Nel- ford to play for them, which she did in an easy, unaffected style. After this, Emily played, and then Cecelia took a seat by the instrument. Miss Nelford and Cecelia sung and played till it was time to retire. By this time, Miss Nelford had regained her spirits, and thought if Miss Lee would not appear quite so ridiculous, she might enjoy her visit very much. Mrs. Grey bade Mary Malcom    show Miss Nelford to the apartment adjoining Cecelia's. Miss Nelford wished, if it was. agreeable to Cecelia, to occupy the room with her. Cecelia was pleased  with the arrangement, while Emily secretly wondered that a daughter of Judge Nelford could be so vulgar; for her part, she would not room with Cecelia, or any   one else, if it were not absolutely necessary. While they were going up stairs, Miss Nelford said, addressing Emily, "she did not know but she was intruding upon her rights,"   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.    S   261 "Not at all," replied Miss Emily; "I have an apartment of my own while I remain here." "Then," said Miss Nelford, "you do not make this place your home?" "No, indeed!" exclaimed Emily; "I am soon' going to the city; at least, my home will be there when not at a school." After they had entered their room, Cecelia asked Alpha if she would like to read before retiring? taking her Bible from its resting-place upon the stand. Alpha read a chapter aloud, and closed the book, when the --two girls bowed to say their evening prayers. "Did your mother bring you up in the habit of evening prayer?" inquired Alpha. "She did," replied Cecelia, " and I can never sleep comforta- bly after neglecting to pray. 'I think it is a duty we should not hesitate under any circumstances to obey. If we would be protected through the dark hours of night, we should not forget from whom we receive such watchful care, or neglect to solicit it, and express our feeble thanks for so great a blessing." "Surely," returned Alpha, "it is one of the greatest bless- ings, that we are enabled without fear or anxiety to close our eyes in forgiveness. Slumbering in unconsciousness, and trust- ing ourselves wholly and fearlessly in the hands of our Guard- ian Father, who will never neglect or forsake us, so long as we solicit his divine protection." Cecelia closed the window, arranged her morning attire, and was soon lost in as sweet a slumber as her waking fancy could desire. At an early hour the succeeding morning, the girls were up ; and after strolling through the meadows for an hour, retured in season for breakfast. "Papa, can you spare Patrick and one team to-day?" whis- pered Cecelia. "Yes, for one day, child, if you wish it. But why Patrickdl  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7463-00000135"/> 262       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE --would not your father do as well? I can be spared better than Patrick." "Oh, certainly!" said Cecelia; " if it is agreeable to you, I would certainly choose your escort." "Where does my Cecelia wish to go to-day?" inquired Mr. Grey. "To  the fair, at Edenville church. Miss Nelford is acquainted there. I heard her express a wish to Emily to attend; and I wish to make her visit agreeable to her," replied Cecelia. "Have you mentioned the excursion to her?" resumed Mr. Grey. "No, papa," said Cecelia ; "I thought it best not to do so, until I knew we would not be liable to meet with disappoint- ment." "That was right," exclaimed Mr. Grey; "now go and learn her pleasure. If she desires to go, invite Emily lto join you, and then come and tell me at what time you wish to start." Cecelia soon learned from Miss Nelford that it would afford her most sincere pleasure; while Emily was overjoyed with delight. Cecelia assured her father of the gratification it would give all parties, and Mr. Grey ordered the horses put before the carriage; and in a short time the fleet steeds were moving swiftly along the smooth road to Edenville. It was a delightful morning, just cool enough for pleasure. The road wound along by the side of the river, with green fields on one -side, studded here and there with clumps of low bushes, wild flowers, and lofty shade trees. The birds sent forth glad notes of joy, and the boatman's song fell sweetly on the ear. They enjoyed the scenery too well to converse; yet, each was happy in the realization of the beauties surrounding them. After a seemingly short time, they entered a long avenue of   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       263 chestnut trees, which led to the church in which was the fair. The church stood far back from the road, and was surrounded with many beautiful shade trees, beneath whose wide spreading braches, seats and benches were arranged for the accommoda- tion of the multitude. Already numbers were walking, talking or eating from tables loaded with delicacies. Cecelia pointed to the cypress that just waved over the high wall which surrounded the cemetery. "Could one wish a sweeter resting-place than this?" she   inquired of Alpha. "No, no I surely no ; I have often thought so ;" replied Alpha.  "Often and often have I sat by the open window of that church, the slight breeze just waving the drooping branches of some willow, sweeping across the face of some marble slab or monument; the voice of the venerable minister rising and falling in stern and tender cadence ; or the notes of the organ swelling out full, strong, and sweet, and I have thought I could dream thus forever.-Oh I the solemn beauties of this place have left an ineffable trace upon my mind-upon my heart, I might say. For here sleeps my heart's chosen idol, and not many hours roll away that in thought I do not steal away, and sit in the cypress shade, or weave garlands of flowers to deck my loved--lost one's grave. I shall never marry, Cecelia, never. My heart sleeps in the deep silence of the tomb, where sleep the eyes that beamed with tenderness, deep in the sleep of death. The forehead, that spoke of high and holy thoughts, the masses of dark raven hair, and the lips that promised to hold no earthly idol but myself ; and shall I now forget? Ah I no; here, here is the home of my heart." Cecelia wept ; she hardly knew the full meaning of the deep, wild words her companion uttered, as she led her from the car- riage to a small open gate, and down among the sleeping places of the dead. At last, Alpha stopped by the side of a lofty monument, and pressing her lips upon the cold stone, she  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7463-00000136"/> CECELIA GREY; OR, THE whispered " we meet again." Then sinking upon her knees, she pillowed her head upon the little mound. Cecelia did not seek to assuage the grief of her friend, when she read upon the finely chiselled marble, the words--"Sacred to the memory of Herbert Lincoln." After a short time, Alpha arose, calm and resigned, and twined a wreath of cypress and myrtle, aud laid it upon the grave. Then turned away, and with Cecelia left the cemetery. In the church-yard, Alpha met an old acquaintance, to whom she pre- sented Cecelia, and they went in search of Mr. Grey and Emily, whom they found walking from one table to another, admiring the many articles of usefulness, exposed for sale. No one would have thought of the trying ordeal Alpha had just passed through, to look upon the calm, sweet smile, that played upon her lip, as she recognized one old friend or another of her acquaintances among the passing throng. They were all invited to dine with the pastor, at the vicarage ; and returned too late to view the delightful scenery that had entranced them in the morning. The week of Alpha Nelford's stay with Cecelia passed swiftly away; and one fine morning Cecelia found herself ready to enter the carriage of Judge Nelford, which stood waiting before the door. O   CHAPTER XXIII. EMLY stood haughtily by the side of Cecelia, while Miss Nel- ford took leave of Mrs. Grey and bestowed a token of remem- brance upon Mary Malcom for her many kind attentions during her visit. Cecelia bade Emily good bye, and Miss Nelford told her she must come and visit her in her beautiful home. She then stepped into the carriage where Cecelia followed her, with a feeling rather of sorrow than joy. Shle had not been home long enough to like the idea of passing a week away from her parents. Yet, the thought of possibly seeing and conversing with the brother of Alpha, compensated her for her unwilling journey. "If I only could forget that soul-stirring voice," she mur- mured ; "oh I if I only could know it was the voice of common thought-of a common person like myself, perhaps I could forget. It is for this purpose that I go with Alpha. Could I hear his voice for only an instant, I would be satisfied. Then, I might forget and not be forever dreaming on in uncertainty, which is the torment of my life." Alpha seemed buried in dreams of her own, and did not notice the look of dejection which settled upon the face of her companion; and if she had, she would probably have consL dered it the timorousness of youth, going out among almost entire strangers, as were the family of Judge Nelford, with the exception of Alpha, or perhaps Charles. 12  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7463-00000137"/> 266       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE The carriage approached the mansion of the Nelfords, and the judge and lady stood in the piazza; yet no smile came upon the lip of Alpha; no change upon her expressive face. Her cheek only glowed as her mother took her in her arms from her father's greeting kiss. "You are looking  better, love," said  Mrs. Nelford; "brighter-your absence has done you good." Alpha introduced Cecelia, saying: "You must thank her, then ; I have passed all my happy hours with her." Cecelia's pale face and red eyes startled Mrs. Nelford, and she took another hurried look at Alpha, and said: "You do look decidedly better; do you not think so, Miss Grey?" -"Indeed! Mrs. Nelford, I cannot tell. I was not aware that Alpha was ill. She certainly is not as pale as usual." "You are our good physician," interrupted the judge. "You must stay with us and complete the cure your presence has commenced.  Alpha, I believe, pines for your society. Now, I will strike a bargain with you, Miss Grey. You stay half the time with us, and Alpha will stay the other half with you ; and I will incur the trouble of transporting you hither and thither with pleasure 1" "I thank you," replied Cecelia. "I would gladly enjoy the society of your daughter, if possible. I have not yet cornm. pleted my time at school. Her company will always be the sincerest gratification to me." "Then Alpha shall go to school too," exclaimed the judge. "No, no t papa," replied Alpha; " thank you, Alpha will stay with you, in our elegant home; only once in a while visit my favorite in the vacations."  Alpha begged Cecelia to excuse her, and glided away. Mrs. Nelford tried to entertain Cecelia, but could speak of nothing but Alpha, who, she said, had been drooping for the year past, and that the physician declared if nothing served to   amuse her, or dispel the dejection of her mind, she could not live over two years. She also informed her that the judge had never paid any attention to what he called her superstitious whims, till the increased weakness and silence of Alpha, forced his attention to the painful truth. "And we leave it to you," she continued, " to dispel those clouds that darken the natural brilliancy of her mind." "Indeed!" exclaimed Cecelia; "you give me a task which I am not equal to. I fear I should be powerless in the under- taking. Your daughter, I have remarked, is, when not sur- rounded with company, dejected and absent; yet, silently con- tented, not wishing to- notice or receive the attention of any one. Still, if propriety calls upon her to be gay, witty and attractive, she is all life and vivacity, which in the end, I think, only wearies and sickens her. I will try to draw her from her- self; I can do no more.", Tea was announced, and Mrs. Nelford seated Cecelia by her side. When Alpha joined them at the table, her face had resumed its pale, calm look, and she .laughed and chatted with her old, absent air. In the evening a few young friends called, and Alpha enter- tained them seemingly with the greatest pleasure. Cecelia knew the anecdotes,jests and smiles of Alpha were all for others, and her heart ached when she heard a weary sigh after a giddy laugh. An incident, amusing enough of itself, occurred in the evening; yet it brought no light to the sad one's eye, as a light laugh rang from her lips. The judge had hired a young Irishman to run of errands. In the house was another, by the name of Larry McDorn, who was usually called "Ar." Besides those, was the black cook, Laury. "Mike," called the judge, addressing the first mentioned Irishman, as he sat in the midst of a circle of political gentle- men, "Mike, bring Larry here.'  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7463-00000138"/> 268       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE "It's meself that will do that same, yer honor," said Mike. "Away then 1" exclaimed the judge. Mike hastened to the kitchen, where the cook was stirring the flour into the yeast jar. ', It's yerself that must come along," exclaimed Mike. "Clear out dar, you Irish vagabond," screamed Laury, pounding poor Mike on the head with the yeast ladle. The company, hearing the hubbub, hastened to the kitchen, where they found Mike, with one arm fast around the black girl, and the other defending his head from the repeated blows Laury dealt profusely upon him. "The divil, the divil ye be," cried Mike, " but it's the judge that's awaitin' on ye, so here goes" With vigorous effort, Mike lifted her from the floor, when Laury caught the milk cupboard. The increased weight was too much for poor Mike, and over he went, Laury, cupboard, and batter jar. "The divil and all the blessed saints pertect us 1" screamed Mike, when the judge went off into a perfect roar of laughter, in which the company joined without control. Laury scrambled from the rubbish of broken pitchers and spilt milk, and darting a look of anger upon poor Mike, strode away. Not so with Mike, shaking the milk from his curly hair, be stood upright in conscious innocence. This only added to the amusement of the guests. Kathleen was called to put things to rights, and the guests took leave. Cecelia stole out into the veranda which looked upon the garden, and for a moment drank the sweet fragrance stealing upon the still night air, from the bunches of flowers, which in the dusk of evening could not be distinguished. Then with a sigh of relief, followed Alpha to her sleeping-room. For a long time after her head pressed her pillow, sleep refused to    VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       269 refresh her with its soothing balm ; and she wondered to hear the low, soft breathing of her companion. "She sleeps sweetly," she said, rising upon her elbow to look upon the unconscious sleeper. "Strange, that she can rest with the heavy grief working at her heart." Cecelia knew not, that in sleep only lived the pale and sad girl. In dreams she was happy, and she sought her pillow, not in tears, but in joy, for it: brought her nearer the loved and lost. In waking, realizing life, she missed him-not in sleep. It was late the succeeding morning when Cecelia entered the sitting-room. The family were all assembled and gave her a warm greeting. Alpha declared she-must take some of her medicine, she looked more pale and agitated than herself. "I have something," she resumed, laughing, "that will restore your color ;" mischievously holding up the picture of her brother Charles. In an instant Cecelia's face was crimson. She was angry, yet knew not how to express her anger.  She felt the warm blood tingle in her veins, and burn on her cheek. Mrs. Nelford called their attention to the breakfast table, and Alpha proposed calling on a few friends in the course of the morning, if Cecelia had no objections. Cecelia smiled her acquiescence, and in an open carriage they drove from one place to another; Alpha holding the reins with a master hand. After making several calls, they returned home, and Alpha proposed a stroll in the neighboring wood. Pausing through the garden, they entered a thick grove of chestnut, pine, and walnut trees; and following a little rivulet, came to a deep ravine, covered on one side by rocks, moss, and low, stunted trees; and on the other by the giants of the forest, whose dark shade was interwoven for miles back with the wild grape-vine and low under growth of brush and brambles. "This is truly a dark, dreary abode," exclaimed Cecelia, gazing around her.  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7463-00000139"/> 270       CECELIA GlREY; OR, THE "For owls and bats," replied Alpha, dryly; continuing her way over the damp stones, and sharp pointed rocks. Cecelia followed her closely till they came to the darkest, wildest, and most dreary place imaginable. Cecelia was about to speak, when a low 1' hist" from Alpha, and a shrinking behind the rocks caused Cecelia to drop behind the trunk of a large tree. A moment more, and she saw a wild grape-vine cautiously removed from the face of an almost perpendicular rock ; then back, and six rough, stalwart looking men left the secret hiding- place. A woman then stepped to the door, saying, "Be watchful, and don't be detected; be sure and return safe, Belcaur," and as she closed the door, the men came towards the spot where the girls were secreted. With breathless anxiety Cecelia watched them as they passed her. Their last footstep had hardly died away, when Alpha joined Cecelia, trembling with fear. "We must not stay here another instant," she exclaimed; "perhaps there are more of them in that hole in the rocks. Come quick I we will climb the bank, and get away from this place as soon as possible." Cecelia followed Alpha, as she climbed the steep sides of the ravine, assisted by the low bushes. She had just gained a foot- ing by her side when Alpha declared they were out of danger now, and would soon be in the clear land again. Following Alpha through tangled wild wood, and over fallen trees, they emerged from the woods and stood upon the edge of a green field, where the cattle, quietly grazing, served to make them forget the fearful danger they had just encountered and breathe more freely. "Who do you think those desperadoes were?" inquired Cecelia. "I can not have the least idea," returned Alpha; " men employed in some unlawful business, doubtless. Pethaps they i1i   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNS.      271 are robbers, or perhaps they are men convicted of some crimes, living in concealment to avoid detection. I never was in such fear. I was afraid you would make some noise, and attract their attention. The ravine of Nelford Hall is in a fair way to become renowned." Turning to the left, they kept on the edge of the forest, till they neared the grove, which communicated with the judge's garden. Just as they stepped upon a little mossy bank, they beheld the men from tne cave returning towards them. Again the two girls stood breathless with fear, scanning narrowly the movements of the party. Just as they were about to separate, Alpha touched the hand of Cecelia, and turning in the opposite direction seemed moving that way. They were instantly recognized by one of theparty, who followed quickly after them; and overtaking them, he passed on, and turned back. Alpha turned a careless, fearless look upon him, and went on, conversing in a lively strain, with- Cecelia ; who could scarcely support herself through fear. "Which way, Miss Nelford?" inquired the man. "Merely taking a turn in the fields, this fine morning," Alpha replied, gaily. -"Just returned from the woods-eh?" inquired the man from the forest. "Oh I no ; we came around," carelessly replied Alpha. The man appeared satisfied that his gang was not discovered, and followed a little footpath to the road. "Oh!" exclaimed Cecelia, when he had fairly disappeared- "do let us hasten home. I could never endure another such encounter." "Soon, dear Cecelia, you will be in your happy home, and I in the sunny South, assisting my dear brother in his pastoral charge. May I hope you will not forget me in the hours of solitude which may be yours?" "I will promise you never to forget Alpha Nelford," replied Cecelia. * "But will not Alpha forget?"  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7463-00000140"/> I      272       OECELIA GREY; OR, THE "No, never V" exclaimed Alpha,; "you must promise to write me often, and I will do the same." A servant just then came in search of them, and they hastened back to the house, which was filled with i guests from the city. Alpha entertained her friends, and was seemingly the hap. piest of the happy throng. Mrs. Nelford and Cecelia each felt sad, and thought they would much rather see her less excited, or use less exertion to conceal her natural feelings. The succeeding morning Cecelia was to return home, and she retired early in order to be pre. pared to endure the fatigue of the ride. Alpha did not come to her room till long after midnight; her guests had passed a delightful evening and took their leave with the most flattering encomiums upon their young hostess. t .   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       273 * i CHAPTER XXIV. EARLY the succeeding morning, Cecelia arose, and awoke Alpha. Then she hastily arrayed herself in a dark travelling dress, and sat down to await the summons to breakfast. Sooner than they had expected, they were called down and found the judge and Mrs. Nelford already in the dining-room. Cecelia was astonished to see her father occupying one end of the sofa, discussing politics with the judge. "Why, papa!" exclaimed Cecelia, hastening forward to receive her morning kiss. "You did not expect me so early, child, did you? or I might say rather you did not expect me at all." "I certainly did not expect you, as the judge said he would be my escort. But why did you come for me?" 'inquired Cecelia. "I had business near here, and thought to save your kind friends the trouble of bringing you home. You are not sorry, I hope?" inquired Mr. Grey. "Oh, certainly not 1 papa-I am very glad to save them the trouble." "I had anticipated it as a pleasure," exclaimed the judge. "My lady and Alpha had intended to accompany us."  "I, am very sorry, then, that I am so unfortunate as to inter- fere with such an agreeable arrangement," replied Mr. Grey. "I hope my presence will not prevent you from doing so." "We shall anticipate it as one of the greatest pleasures," 12*  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7463-00000141"/> 274       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE' resumed Judge Nelford ; " but as you have come for Cecelia I will defer the visit till another time." Cecelia bade Mrs. Nelford good bye, received the parting kiss from Alpha, and was led to the carriage by the judge; who handing her in, promised to bring Alpha over again as soon as she should return from the South. "You know," said Mr. Grey, addressing Cecelia, " that to- morrow is your aunt's wedding A,y. Your mother has ordered from the city several new dresses for you. Your aunt will bring them, and I expect she will arrive at our residence before us.  Mrs. Grey had arranged everything in the neatest order. The white curtains hung in festoons from the dining-room win- dows, and vases of tissue flowers adorned the table. Cecelia had hardly stepped from the carriage, ere Emily clasped her in her arms, and leading her forward persented her to her Cousin Ada and Delphin. Then to her Uncle Edgar, so soon to fill the place of father to the wayward girl. Mrs. Lee looked sad and unhappy. More than once when her eyes met those of her sister's, did they fill with tears. Not so with Mr. Lee, he appeared contented and happy, as a man about to do an agreeable duty in behalf of his deceased brother's children; while Ada, by her sweet winning ways, tried to soothe and gratify her dear aunt, as the marks of early sorrow were dis- cerned in Mrs. Lee's quiet, resigned look. Long after the household were buried in slumber, Alice and Mary (formerly .Clermont) sat together in the deserted sitting- room. Tears had coursed freely overthe cheeks of both, and still they sat thus, recalling the hours of youth and early child- hood. But they spoke not of the present. Mrs. Grey well knew that her sister's heart was too full of misery to- speak of her coming bridal. Each way that the afflicted:woman looked she saw the pale face of her departed husband. Sometimes he came in the flush and hope of youthful love. Then, in the bit- terness of despair, tore the jewels from her glossy tresses.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       275 Again, and she saw him weltering in his life's blood. And she had done this--had destroyed all her happiness for life ; and now was to bind herself to new ties, to place her children in the sphere from which her imprudence had displaced them. She dreamed not that her two oldest children looked upon the union in dismay and sorrow, -and that their hearts ached at the thought of giving up their humble home. Mrs. Grey attended her to her room, spread the bridal robe upon the sofa, and pre- pared each article for her morning toilet. Mrs. Lee courted in vain the goddess of sleep, and with joy she saw the sun streak the eastern sky, as she leaned from the open casement, and inhaled the fresh morning air. Soon she heard the low call of Ada: "Will you let me come in, Aunt Mary?" Mrs. Lee opened the door, saying, "You are early, dear." "Yes," replied Ada, " will you let me be your tire woman this once, as you have often been mine? I would wreathe that glossy hair of yours in heavy braids across your high, pale brow. You must win back some color to your cheeks, aunt. Mrs. Grey is older than you, and she looks blooming as the fresh blown rose."  "But not as youthful, love," responded Mrs. Lee. "Where is Emily, I wonder?" "Emily!" exclaimed Ada. "Oh!- dear aunt, you must not expect any attention from her. She is too selfish to ever think of gratifying any other than herself." "How, then, Ada, can you think you will be happy with her for your constant companion?" inquired Mrs. Lee. "Oh I I expect her to annoy us sometimes," replied Ada; "but then your society will amply repay me for any little incon- venience she may occasion me." "You are not sure of that, Ada," said Mrs. Lee, "By becoming your mother, I fear I shall bring misery instead of happiness into your quiet home."  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7463-00000142"/> 276       CEOC TA GREY; OR, THE "Well," replied Ada, " we cannot blame you, as it is our choice." Mrs. Lee suffered Ada to array her in the light rich silk, to arrange the orange flowers in her dress cap, and fasten the golden clasp of her sash. She then bade Ada bring her white dress, and she would assist her with her toilet. Ada tripped away, and soon returned with a snowy muslin robe, and bunches of white roses. Mrs. Lee had scarcely fastened the last bud in the ringlets of her wavy hair, ere the door opened and Emily advanced towards them. "Ah I you are busy, mammal she exclaimed, sarcastically. "I am sorry to interrupt you," and with a haughty bow she turned and left the room. "She is jealous, aunt," said Ada; "you must no more assist me at my toilet. Emily did not condescend to notice me." "She is as I was at her age," replied Mrs. Lee. "I was as haughty as your unfortunate cousin. May heaven grant that she may never drink from the cup of bitterness, the anguish of soul her poor mother has tasted. Pity her, and hate her not, Ada ; in your gentleness you know not the hours of sorrow that prey upon her heart." Mrs. Lee had reclined her head upon the dressing-table, while the tears fell slowly upon the pure silk of her robe. "Don't, Aunt Mary-don't cry li expostulated Ada, con- cerned for her sorrows and for the soiled dress. "You know it is not good to cry on your bridal morn, and you are soiling your dress sadly." Mrs. Lee could not forbear smiling at the interest Ada evinced in her attire ; while she blamed herself for yielding to her weakness.  Cecelia now came to summon them to the breakfast-room, and Ada was pleased to discern the similitude of their tastes evinced in their attire; for Cecelia, unconscious of her inten- tions, had arrayed herself in simple white.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       2" "You did not know that I am to be bridesmaid to-day, did you?" Cecelia inquired, holding up her white robe for inspec- tion. ," Mary Malcom is to be married immediately after Aunt Mary; then we return here to dinner, and start for your resi- dence in thile city ; leaving Patrick and Mary at home, to pass the honeymoon alone." "But who do you think is to be brides-man?" continued Cecelia. "Indeed," replied Ada, "I'cannot tell. If Edgar were here I would guess it were him." "Your brother is the chosen one," resumed Cecelia ; "Del- phin was not more surprised than I, at this singular announce- ment. But he kindly consented to bear the honor of attendant to the happy pair." Breakfast over, the carriages were brought to the door. Mr. and Mrs. Lee took possession of the first; Mr. and Mrs. Grey, Emily and Ada, of the next. Then came Patrick and Mary Malcom; and last the bridesman and bridesmaid.   Cecelia was sad at the thought of visiting the little cottage for the last time, where they had passed so many happy hours, and she could not help thinking her aunt and family would have been much happier to remain in the quiet retreat. The woodbine twined around the little porch, and the cot- tage was half buried in the green foliage of the old shade trees. The clergyman had arrived, and stood silently contem- plating the approach of the bridal party. Mr. Grey had been careful to select a clergyman unknownto Mrs. Lee, for he did not wish to awaken painful recollections in the heart of his sister-in-law; and Mrs. Lee felt relieved when she saw it was not the clergyman that officiated at her former nuptials. They alighted from the carriages and entered the well known apartments of Mrs. Lee, whose taste had fashioned each article of comfof. Luxury there was not, for she had not been able to furnish more than the bare necessaries. But  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7463-00000143"/> 278       CECELL GREY; OR, THE everything wore a new charm ; evergreens and wild flowers were scattered in profusion around, and the simple curtains were fastened back with wreaths of roses. Emily was annoyed and angry, observing to Ada, " she could not discover why her mother should wish to come to that hor. rid lonely place to be married. She was sure it was much pleasanter at Uncle Arthur's, or she might as well have re- mained where she was. Ada made no reply to her remarks, fearing her aunt might overhear her, and knowing it would distress and annoy her. Emily knew her dress was more rich than any others present, and her importance was calculated by her personal appearance. In her estimation, she- was above witnessing the marriage of Patrick and Mary. She thought it an insult to her mother and good uncle to celebrate those nuptials in unison with theirs. She never once thought of her own poverty; that if it were not for the kindness of others, she too might fill the place of servant. Mr. Lee's marriage was scarcely solemnized, when a carriage drew up before the door. Cecelia advanced to learn its occu- pants, and was pleased to see her cousins Edgar and Alice, and Mary L. de Manuel. She hastily stepped to the side of the carriage, saying: "Just a moment too late. The marriage ceremony has just been consummated." "Well, I must say I am sorry, as well as glad," replied Edgar; " that is, sorry it ever was thought of, and glad that I was spared the pain of witnessing the ceremony. If I could have arrived in time to have saved my mother the necessity of sacrificing herself to serve her children, it would have been joy indeed." Alice wept long upon her mother's bosom, heedless of her step-father's expressions of fondness. Edgar led Miss de Manuel to his parents, and presented her es^    VICISSITiDES OF FORTUNE.       279 as his wife. Mrs. Lee turned pale as she kissed the cheek of  her daughter-in-law. Now it Was Edgar's turn to receive the congratulations; which were given and received with a far better grace than their seniors had exhibited. Mary Malcom was almost forgotten by all, with the excep- tion of the clergyman, who could not forget that another cou- ple were waiting his services. Delphin was anxious to 'fill the place of bridesman to the timorous bride, who sat bolt upright in a chair, turning pale and red by turns as any one happened to look towards them. The clergyman told them to stand up, and Cecelia was obliged to take her hand to reassure her ; for through bashfulness, she was wholly unconscious of the import of his words. -Delphin, in vain endeavored to conquer the smile which would play upon his lips; but Cecelia stood as demure- and solemn as if repeating her own marriage vows. It was newly arranged that they should allreturn to the house of Mr. Grey, and remain till the succeeding morning ere they returned to the city. They bad scarcely reached the gate which opened upon the lawn in front of Mr. Grey's residence, when the rain fell in large drops, and each hastened to find shelter. Cecelia stood long at her chamber window, watching the dark clouds, and listening to the heavy peals of thunder, or gazing upon the quick flashes of lightning. At length her forgotten guests arose in her mind. They would think her very rude, and she hastened to join them. Alice Lee stood in the hall, and as Cecelia approached, joined her. "Why, Alice!" exclaimed Cecelia, " how could you leave the three brides alone?" "Only two brides occupy the parlor now," Alice replied, "Mrs. McFarland, with her husband, begged leave to return to the kitchen, for they found the pleasure of getting married and a bridal party, altogether no pleasure at all."  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7463-00000144"/> 280       CEOELIA GREY; OR, THE "I'hope there is only one of the party that thinks so," re- turned Cecelia. Alice stood for some moments 'silent, then hesitatingly inquired, "Have you heard from Ralph Harwood since his father's death?" "I have not inquired concerning them," replied Cecelia. "You must know more than I do about their affairs ; Nella and yourself were such dear friends?" The warm blood came to the cheek of Alice. "Yes--no, yes ;" she replied. "If it were not for Nella I would not ac- company mamma to the city. But I will pass a few weeks there, which I suppose is no more than right, since mamma is desirous I shall do so." "What!" exclaimed Cecelia;" is not Nella in Greenwoodville?" "Nella I oh no ; her brother was left with nothing excepting the implements of hrs father's trade," replied Alice. "You know he was a mechanic, and poor Nella had only her mother's fur- niture. You are probably aware that they were well educated and industrious. Ralph is in possession of quite a library-all from his own earnings. Well, to make a long story short, they saw some trouble after the death of Mr. Harwood, the loss of their beautiful home, with one thing and another. At last a friend of Ralph's father took Nella and Ralph into his employ, gave them good wages, and let them rooms in his own cottage, a half hour's walk from Uncle E dgar's. It is the greatest attraction the city possesses, to draw me within its boundaries. I so much wish to see Nella, the friend and play- mate of my early youth. Will you join me in a walk to their quiet home immediately after our arrival, or as soon after as circumstances will admit 7" "Certainly; I would very much like to call upon Nella," rA turned Cecelia ; " she was a general favorite." Ada Lee, stepping into the hall at that moment, laughingly inquired who this lovely creature was that took the hearts of good and bad by storm.    Alice was soon prevailed upon to rehearse the story of Ralph and Nella Harwood. Ada was much pleased to learn that they lived so near them; and made Alice promise to ride around with her to see her humble friends. Cecelia saw a strange look of haughty anger in Alice's eye, as she promised to call with Ada upon her associates. But it soon passed away, for with Ada's kisses and careses, it was im- possible to entertain anger. *   * .  *    sfc *te ** Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Grey were busy talking over the future * prospects of those under their charge. Emily was joking and talking herself into favor with her- papa, as she already designated Mr. Lee, or repelling the sour looks Delphin occa- sionally darted upon her. She made up her mind that Del- phin should like her, and that Ada) should fear to offend her. As for Cecelia, she was entirely beneath her notice -her "country cousin," indeed I she would be sure never to introduce her into the' select circles where she would soon shine. At the tea table they were all united--Edgar and Mary, grave ; Alice and Ada, sad; Emily, joyous ; Cecelia, thought- ful; all being occupied with their own thoughts. The meal, with all its attractions to gratify the senses, was an almost silent one, and at an early hour the younger of the party re- tired to their sleeping-rooms. Cecelia packed her trunks, and prepared presents for Nella Harwood. She then sought her pillow, and slept till the voice of the imperious Emily awoke her to consciousness. "What I asleep?" exclaimed Emily, as soon as Cecelia had procured a light and unfastened the door. "I I ow can you sleep," she continued, "  on the dawn of such an excursion as this? I have not slept an hour to-night. But you have not the prospects in future that I have." " As for the excursion, replied Cecelia, "  it is pleasant view-   &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7463-00000145"/> 282       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE ing the scenery: But I think, even you will become weary before we reach the end of our journey." Soon after, the inmates of the house were astir, and voices and laughter resounded from every room, and each was pleased with the prospect of a delightful day. Cecelia hastened down and entered into the spirit of the party, with hilarity and good will. Even Emily condescended to make herself agreeable to all, not forgetting Patrick and Mary, on whom she bestowed Edgar's gift, the hat with snowflake plumes, and the soiled India shawl, declaring that they were useless to her-she should never need them. The carriages were brought around, and the occupants seated. Cecelia gave herself up to the enjoyment of the varied scenery which passed rapidly by her. She could scarcely believe it noon, when they stopped before the large and commodious hotel, thronged with travellers; many of whom loitered on the piazza or hall, on the alert to catch a glimpse of the bright eyes of the bridal party. Mr. Lee ordered a private room with dinner. TheX had scarcely dined, when the cry of "passeng ers all aboard," sounded from the hall. Instantly the younger portion of the party hastened down the stairs, followed at a slower pace by the elder of the party. They were just seated when the cars clattered away. Here Cecelia found enough to take her attention, so that on the termination of the journey she was far from feeling the fatigue she had anticipated. Mrs. Lee had compared her first bridal with the present, and her heart ached when she thought of her buried husband. It is probable something of this feeling had worked itself into the mind of Mr. Edgar Lee, for he was unusually absent and moody all the journey.  Mrs. Grey, too, thought of their early misfortunes, and talked of the many happy hours they had enjoyed, in spite of the loss of dear friends and wealth. Carriages were in waiting on their arrival, to convey them to the mansion occupied by the millionaire, and Cecelia felt    VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      283 embarrassed by the splendor which everywhere met the eye. She saw the servants throw open the doors, let down the steps of the carriage, and assist Mr. and Mrs. Lee to descend ; then the little maid, Letitia, hastened to the side of Ada. Next she saw Emily with the dignity of a queen, yield her hand to the footman, who assisted her to alight ; then, as if his touch had polluted it, withdraw it from his care. A maid led the way to Cecelia's apartment, and Ada in- formed her that it communicated on one side with her own, and on the other with the apartments allotted for her parents. "So you can be alone when you wish," laughed Ada, " or sit in here with us." "Or go and condole with mamma," haughtily sneered Emily, as she passed to a room on the opposite side of the hall, and adjoining Mr. and Mrs. Lee's. A French dressing-maid followed her with a portemonnaie in her hand, where Mr. Lee had placed it for her mistress' use. "Who is that?" inquired Alice, pointing to the maid. "Emily's dressing-maid," replied Ada, still laughing. "Papa thought she would be essential for Emily's happiness and so 'had one on hand. I thought my good Letitia sufficient and tasty enough for us, Alice. What a sensation Emily will create on entering into society I What a satisfaction that I am- impregnable to the shafts of jealousy, or who can tell the consequences!"  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7463-00000146"/> 284       OECEIBA GREY; OR, TmH CHAPTER XXV. CECELIA slept sweetly her first night in the city, notwith. standing the rumbling of carriages, and the many strange noises that reached her from the busy street. Not so with Emily; her thoughts were with the moving, living throng. Her waiting-maid slept in an adjoining apartment, and her soft breathing had something in it agreeable to her. Emily's step-father had informed her that the maid was an excellent seamstress, and she would have no occasion to weary her own unskillful fingers. Her maid arose at an early hour, softly that she might not disturb her mistress. Emily listened with Breath- less attention to the new scenes surrounding her. She heard her cousin's tiny bell, and still she feigned sleep. Then her mother's voice in the adjoining room, in anxious solicitude, express her alarm that she "feared Emily was not well; the excitement attending the marriage might have too much for her-poor Emily." "Poor Emily I indeed!"Emily ejaculated, seizing the bell and ringing it violently.  "Poor Emily!  Why not poor Alice? What will Uncle Edgar think?" Her maid came quickly to the room, asking, "what would she have?" "Bring me a suitable dress," Emily commanded; "then arrange my hair in fashionable style." Cecelia awoke with the low voice of Letitia, who said her mistress desired her to awake her, and assist her to dress.  VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       285 i "Will not Ada need your services?" inquired Cecelia. "Oh, no! it is not often she will accept them. I pass the most of my time in embroidery or needle-work for the family, in which Ada and Mrs. Lee assist me. But come, let me arrange your hair ; I am here to assist you." t"Thank you," replied Cecelia, "I can get along alone, and Miss Ada may need your services." "But you must consent," persisted the maid; "Ada ex- pressly desired me to arrange your hair in the style Alice and herself have theirs." Twining two white rosebuds along the left side, thus; "I beg your pardon," she continued, if it be agreeable." Cecelia submitted herself to the skillful hands of the maid, and soon saw herself in the mirror, with increased loveliness, through the effect of the tasty arrangement of her toilet. "So much for knowing how to dress," she exclaimed with a smile. "You have not, like myself,. passed your whole life studying the effect of a ribbon, flower, or feather," the waiting maid replied, with a sigh. Cecelia thought that a waiting-maid was like a caged bird; and she was glad she was competent to wait upon herself. Hearing her father's voice in the adjoining room, she dismissed Letitia and hastened to her parents. Mrs. Grey gave her a hug and a kiss, as a reward for look- ing so well, which almost spoiled the effect of Letitia's. skill. Mr. Grey called her to a seat by his side, and gave various in- structions for her appearance during the day, to all of which Cecelia listened attentively, and Mr. Grey presented her a set of jewels, requesting her to wear them in the evening. Cecelia was pleased, but not elated with them, which her father said would have been the effect on most young ladies. Letitia came to request Cecelia's presence in Ada's apart- ment, where Alice. and Ada were alone; and Ada informed Cecelia that they had resolved to call on Nella Harwood before  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7463-00000147"/> 286       OECELKA GREY; OB, THE  breakfasting, for fear she might be absent if they waited longer, and Alice thought it would be impossible to wait till the mor.- row, and their time would be occupied during the remainder of the day and evening.  Cecelia hastened to get her hat, while Letitia was sent to  summon Emily to join them in their walk., "You tell them," Emily replied, " that I haveno idea of re. newing my acquaintance with the Harwoods, and I think it  highly improper for Alice to do so, or take Ada to see those people. Papa Lee will be highly incensed at such an absurd  idea." Ada laughed, Cecelia frowned, and Alice burst into tears. "Can Emily entertain such feelings towards the Harwoods?" she exclaimed, "then she is hardened indeed. How can she  forget the many little kindnesses bestowed upon her by Nella in her time of need. Nella was once far better off than we were, and she did not know it." "Then we will not know it," interrupted Ada; " that is, no further than we are obliged to." They threw on their shawls, and in another moment were on the pavement moving along quickly, in the direction-of the  suburbs, Letitia as pioneer to the little party, having once  walked there with Mrs. Lee. Letitia ascended the steps of the cottage and rang the bell, when a little ,boy, the picture of health and neatness, came to the door. Letitia asked for Miss Harwood, when the little fel- low threw open the door, and announcing visitors to Nella, went into the adjoining room. Alice advanced quickly, and in a moment was in the arms of  Nella Harwood. Her brother sat reading in an arm-chair by the window, when the unusual cry of joy which his, sister uttered, caused him to raise his eyes from the page, and with a spring be stood by the side of Alice; but seeing Ada and- Cecelia, he checked the words that arose to his lips, and spoke in accents of mere common politeness .   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       287 Alice was pleased at the opinion Ada had formed of them, for she knew by her look of wonder and air of studied polite- ness, that she thought them equal to any in the circle of refine- ment in which she moved. The ease and grace of movements, both of the brother and sister, charmed Ada ; and before she left the cottage, she invited them both to attend the bridal party at her father's house. She was astonished, but not angry, at the polite, yet firm refusal she received. Nella said, however, they would call when they thought her time not occupied. They left the cottage well satisfied with their early visit; Ada declaring she had found the most charming youth in the universe, hidden in a little Eden, just. in the border of her morning walk. After breakfasting, they went around to call upon Miss Media, who they found at home in her father's mansion. Meanwhile, Emily drove in a carriage to the house of her friend Lilla de Vere, with her waiting-maid occupying a seat on the opposite, side of the carriage. Susan Medla prevailed upon Ada, Cecelia, and Alice to stay and dine with them, sending a note to the Lees to inform them of their intentions, while Emily drove home with Miss de Vere as a companion during the day and evening. After dining, Ada requested Susan to return with them and pass the afternoon and evening. Mrs. Media said she would send the carriage for her at twelve o'clock P M.; and they returned home.  Ada entered  the parlor with a light heart, and was astonished and angry at seeing Lilla de Vere occuping a seat upon the sofa, and making herself at home, with the air of one perfectly at ease. They had never been friends-never visited, or more than changed salutations at meeting ; and it was with forced calmness that Ada replied -to her courtesies. She saw that Emily and Miss de Vere were on the most familiar terms, and sighed to think of this new trial, the one the hardest to  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7463-00000148"/> 288       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE endure-to dissimulate and play the agreeable to one whom she inwardly despised. Yet she resolved that Emily should have no occasion to complain of any neglect shown her guest.  Miss de Vere was dressed for the party in a robe of pink tissue, fastened with a white zone, covered with spangles. Rubies were on her arms, diamonds were in her hair, yet there was no taste in the arrangement, and her dress was far from becoming. Susan Medla was also dressed for the evening, in blue silk, a white sash around her waist, and a single white rose in the heavy puffs of her hair, which was bound around with pearls. Emily did not give them much of her company, evidently to the chagrin of Miss de Vere, who was obliged to retire with her to her apartment; where, by flattery, she hoped to keep the first place in Emily's heart. Just as the sun set, Ada ordered the carriage for a drive, intending to give Cecelia a view of the city, ere she returned home; and bidding the coachman drive slow through the prin- cipal streets till dark, she pointed out the residences of the wealthy, or related amusing anecdotes for her. diversion. Cecelia could see no beauty in the piles of granite or marble; she could not bear the idea of being shut up almost the year round in walls of brick. She likened the inmates of the lofty mansions to the birds she saw in gilded cages, who knew no happiness beyond the rooms in which they were confined. They returned home just in time to dress for the evening's entertainment; and as they ascended the stairs, Ada turned around and looking in the face of Cecelia, inquired how she liked the city? "Oh I I cannot tell you," laughingly replied Cecelia; "I am not yet acquainted with the mysteries of its enchantment." "You will see, durfig the evening, such a variety of amuse- meats," resumed Ada; " you know, all the old folks will be pre- sent-such a diversity as will at once clear up all the mystery   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       289 of the recherche, purse-proud papas, intri, .ing mammas, consum-  mate flirts, belles and beaux, wits, geniuses, and fools." "Stop-stop your nonsense," interrupted Cecelia. "I don't doubt but what all you enumerate will be present, and humbug will carry a banner, under which all those worthies will con-   il centrate, each hold of the standard, in the vain belief that it is unknown that they do so."                     i The guests had mostly arrived when Cecelia descended to the drawing-room, leaning upon her father's arm. They sauntered leisurely through the crowded halls, listening to the music,   il watching the dancers or conversing with those around them. Mrs. Grey had requested Cecelia not to join the dance, and   j she watched with some impatience the busy feet, beating timei  to the music with her thoughts, rather than her restless slip-  pers. Susan Media was engaged for the evening, and Ceceliai was left almost entirely to her solitary reflections, excepting  i occasionally when Ada joined them for a moment in the lauda-  ble effort of relieving Mr. Grey of his charge; but he con-    I vinced her that it was a delightful care-that of directing and  ii guiding the mind of his unsophisticated child, amid scenes and   characters so familiar to him, yet so new to her. He pointed   ii out distinctly the difference observed among the votaries of  pleasure, and Cecelia felt interested and pleased with the new  study before her, and some of her father's remarks were indeli-  bly impressed upon her mind l The tables were loaded with delicacies, and Mr. Grey drew her attention to the guests around them. First, he pointed toi I a tall, gaunt individual who seemed to loathe every articlei before him, turning with disdain frbm the choicest dainties.  Then a little mincing lady with green spencer and purple skirt,  i nibbled daintily at one dish or another, as if afraid some one might think she lived to eat. On the other hand a lady in curls and blue dress, loaded plate after plate, which dis- appeared with such marvellous rapidity, that one must think she labored under the delusion, that if her plate was always    I  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7463-00000149"/> 290       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE full, she could not be suspected of eating to live. Then the wine which the gents poured down, " bumper after bumper i" until they could hold no more, and satiated their revenge by pouring it into the spittoons, and making themselves appear very ridiculous generally, all unperceived as they fancied. Miss Media came and drew Cec.elia away from her father, after obtaining his consent for her to accompany her home. Cecelia went to bid her mother good night, and then entered the carriage which stood waiting for Susan. Mrs. Media had sat up for her daughter, who, she said, was too young to go out much. She must wait a few years longer before she had her head turned with the giddy world. Susan rang the bell on going up stairs, and her maid came to disrobe her. After braiding the heavy tresses of her hair, Susan told her to assist Cecelia. "Thank you; I am my own dressing-maid," replied Cecelia, throwing on her night-dress and springing into bed. 3     *      *     *     *      *     e     e The sun was up, and its soft light scattered the shadows which lingered in the richly furnished apartment, where the fair girls slept. By the side of a dressing-table sat a slender girl, busy covering a frame for embroidery, ever and anon cast- ing a loving, sorrowing glance upon the- occupants of the bed. At last she murmured aloud. "I think I would be more happy if I were the wealthy heiress, so good and gentle, that slumbers there.  But my heart reproaches me-it tells me I am happier than she. To be sure I must toil for my bread-possibly through life ; but I have a kind mother and a tender brother to assist me, and when my betrothed has earned enough to purchase a home then I can take those dear ones there, to taste the happiness pre- pared for us. Surely she has seen more hours of sorrow than I ever have. She is obliged to humor her money-loving father's whims, who would gladly see her united to that old curmud- geon of a cousin of his who is perpetually teasing her. I have   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.   291   it 1" she suddenly ejaculated ; "but I will see my Henry first. I will thwart her father's designs, by humoring his attentions until poor Susan is rid of his importunities.  How fortunate that I am handsome, and the old wretch would win me in pre- ference to the wealthy heiress for his bride. Then perhaps her father will not refuse young Ernot, who is so worthy of her." For some time the girl steadily pursued her work, when a soft rap at the door startled her from her seat, and she left the room. A moment after, she' returned with a tray of biscuit and a pitcher of chocolate, which she placed upon a stand beside the bed, and awoke the sleepers. Cecelia smiled at the thought of taking refreshments in bed, while Susan refused all except a taste of the chocolate. MIrs. Media sat by the side of the breakfast table, which was covered for two ; and immediately after Susan's appear- ance in the dining-room, she rung the bell for their breakfast, and placed Cecelia by her side at the table. As soon as the dishes were cleared away, Mrs. Media bade the girls amuse themselves as they best could, and withdrew from the room. "There," sighed Susan, "we can have the whole morning to ourselves 1" The door bell rung and a servant was heard to show a visi- tor to the parlor. An instant more and the servant inquired of Susan if " she was at home to Mr. Ernot." The blood rushed to the cheek of Susan, then left her pale as marble. Cecelia sprung to her side with a cry of alarm; aand Mr. Ernot, fearing something had happened, hastened into the dining-room, when the servant withdrew. Susan's maid motioned Cecelia from the half open door, and Cecelia, hesitating but receiving no notice to the contrary, left the apartment. -A half hour later, and Susan joined her, looking sad, yet happy. After excusing to Cecelia her seeming neglect, she informed  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7463-00000150"/> 292       CECELIA GREY; OR, TTE her that Mr. Ernot was an orphan with a small fortune at his command. That her father had been his guardian, and kept him in his counting-house for some time. That he was steady and industrious, and having often met, they had learned to love; which coming to the ears of her father, he had forbidden her to see him again. And when he called it was the thoughts of what he would think of her that caused the emotion she wit. nessed on his announcement.  They had promised to wait till he could obtain a fortune sufficient to satisfy the avarice of her father; then to marry. That they should not try to meet again till after his return from South America, for which he was to start immediately. " And now I have a favor to ask of you," she continued; "mother came in just as I was about to give him this locket containing my miniature, and take his in exchange. I want you to go into the room, pass him as an old acquaintance, and drop this into his hand ; and if he offers his in return, take it and bring it to me." Cecelia inquired why she did not do so herself ? Susan replied that her mother had bidden her retire to her room, and would not allow her to exchange pictures with him. Cecelia said she did not doubt that it was wrong; but it might all turn out for the best, and she would comply with her request. Taking the locket, she descended to the hall, where she saw Mr. Ernot about leaving the house. Calling him by name, he paused, and she presented Susan's miniature. "' Bless you for this, dear Susan I" he ejaculated, and placing his own in the hands of Cecelia, said; " Give it to Susan and tell 1er we meet no more till her father will be proud to claim me as his son." Cecelia flew back with the message, and Susan showered tears and kisses on the senseless picture. Ada and Alice came to pass the afternoon, and take Cecelia   home with them; and during the whole day Mrs. Medla would fix her eyes sorrowfully upon the face of Susan, who would turn hers away from their sad gaze with a sigh.  She was aware her mother knew all and pitied her; for her father's stern will had chosen an old, wealthy and distant relation for her future husband, who would not fail to claim her hand. But she had her mother to plead for her, and she did not despair. She knew not that she had an assistant in her humble attend- ant more potent than her mother's petitions. Cecelia felt all the solicitude imaginable for her young friend, watching her constantly, as if afraid the roses would again leave her cheek, or her laugh lose its cheerfulness. Soon after tea the carriage came to convey Cecelia, Alice and Ada home. Susan promised to call the succeeding day, and they returned to Mr. Lee's. During the forenoon of the next day, Mrs. Medla came with Susan, and requesting Mrs. Grey to be careful of her, promised to have her ready to start at an early hour for Greenwood. The remainder of the day was taken up in making and receiv- ing calls, the most agreeable.of which was with the Harwoods. Cecelia had already wearied of the city, and was glad when her father's carriage had taken up Susan and whirled away from its noisy precinct, and the still fresh air of the country played across her cheek. Throwing her bonnet off, she gave it free access to play hide-and-seek with the dark braids of her hair tossing the heavy tresses from the snowy brow, or bringing the roses to her slightly colored cheek. "If I were to remain in the city one season," she exclaimed, "it would make me hate even the name. I love the free air of the country, and we will enjoy its purity while we have the opportunity. In school we will not be deprived of its invigor- ating effects; there are many sweet secluded nooks among the hills of graduation. What a pity there were not more care taken in choosing situations for select schools." "Ah!" exclaimed Susan, "there is something grand and  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7463-00000151"/> 294       CECELIA GREY ; OR, THE noble associated with the sublimity of nature, that inspires the - mind to holy, lofty aims-to acts of charity, of hope and trust. There is, in my opinion, a vast difference in the tone of thought awakened by the beauties of nature. In some localities, we feel a sense of light and trifling; every object is in itself  amusing. At other places, we seem to read the works of a supreme being, one before whom trifling is foolishness and we reverentially worship the God who has left the impress of his  hand around us." "You are a true lover of nature," observed Mr. Grey; "no one can express such sentiments who has not been impressed  with its charms. There are few who have reached the age of thirty that can discern the beauties of nature, in however cog-  spicuous light they are viewed. The cares of life or the charnms of art have obliterated the purer, finer feelings ; and the holiest, happiest enjoyment of the soul is lost to them forever. But in i some minds the love of the works of God are not extinct wheu old age has dimmed the eye and silvered the hair'; for they  will speak in glowing accents of the green valley, the purling stream, or forest covert."  Mr. Grey seemed striving to recall some half-forgotten dream, X and the-remainder of the journey was performed in silence. It was dark before they reached the residence of Mr. Grey, i and Susan had no chance to obtain a glimpse of surrounding objects till morning light. Mary had the table spread for them, and Susan thought she had never tasted such fragrant tea or nice rich biscuit. For a week she rambled through the I fields and groves around the home of Cecelia. Then with her returned to the seminary, where month after month passed away unrelieved in its dull routine by any recreation excepting  that of passing the vacations either in the home of Mr. Grey, or in the elegant mansion of Mr. Medla.   ,ICISSlTrUDES OF FORTUNE.       295 i 1 CHAPTER    XXVI.  A dream, how oft it brings to view The half-forgotten past; An accident reveals to you The chains around you cast. When something whispers to your heart, "Beware! those lips will lie;"            i Let gratitude refuse to live, And friendship with it die.             . CECELIA made rapid progress in her studies, and it was near the close of her school life that she wandered by the side of a  small lake lying along the edge of a precipice whose verge was hidden by small chestnuts and grape-vines, while far back lay the vast forest in all its wild grandeur. Cecelia and Susan had followed a foot-path which wound along through the deep shade, and on the margin of the pre-     I cipice, from which they caught occasional glimpses of the still water lying below them. Turning into another path which they supposed led far away into the forest,'they commenced searching for flowers, and arriving at a spot where a few low trees were thickly covered with vines, they paused to rest; and Cecelia reclined against the vines, when obtaining a glimpse of a rare flower she- reached for it, throwing her whole weight upon the vines which grew close upon the edge of the cliff; they slipped, and carried her several feet down the precipice.  &#xD;<pb n="296" xml:id="VAC7463-00000152"/> 296       CECELIA GREY; OB, THE With a loud shriek, Susan stood clinging to the trees for sup. port a moment, then swooned away. Cecelia clung with a dying grasp to the vines in which she was entangled and suddenly she saw a familiar face look down from the rock above, and a familiar voice exclaimed,  "Be firm ; do not fear, I will try to save you."      i A short time elapsed, and a large grape-vine was dropped close to the side of those -to which she was clinging, and a  young man descended who had no sooner clasped her in his arms than she became insensible. Fastening the large vine to thq others, to keep them from slipping further down, or break- ing with the increased weight, he stepped boldly upon them; and with one hand bound Cecelia to himself with a vine he had prepared for the purpose; and commenced climbing to the summit of the precipice. Trembling in every limb, his hands torn and bleeding, and his hat gone, he placed his insensible burden upon the ground. At that moment another young man joined him, exclaim- ing  "What have you there? You have not been down the gulf to rescue that girl, Charles?"V "Yes- yes," replied the one. addressed; "but see, she revives. Take care of her and do not tell her who saved her ;" and he hastened away. The young man addressed was the brother of Lilla de Vere; the other was Charles *Nelford. On a visit with his sister in the vicinity, he was walking in the forest, when he saw the two i girls pass near him. Shortly'after, hearing the cry of Susan, he hastened to their assistance, and finding Susan so near the margin of the forest and upon the edge of the precipice, sup- posed that Cecelia was lost to him forever. Had he not loved her so truly, he could never have reached her in the short time necessary ere she became unconscious. Neither could he have supported her weight, when upon the vine, which he was obliged to climb by almost super-human exertion,   &#xD;<pb n="Illustration-297" xml:id="VAC7463-00000153"/> CECELIA clung with a dying grasp to the vines in which she was entangled,i and suddenlyshe saw a familiar face look down from the rock above, and a familiar vo'ce excla':med--"Be firm; do not fear, I will try to save you'"-- PAGE 296.-C1   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       297 clingriug with one hand till he could grasp the vine with the other. As soon as Nelford had disappeared, De Vere stooped over the half-unconscious girl, lifting her head tenderly and chafing her temples. A smile played across her lips, and she whispered: "It is him-it is the unknown ; I have heard his voice," and she closed her eyes again, De Vere was now thoroughly alarmed, and not daring to leave her, he called for help. Susan, who had recovered, and was going to give the alarm, supposing Cecelia to be lost, now turned back and hastened to     the side of Cecelia, and with a cry of joy clasped her in her arms, and then told De Vere to bring some water quick-quick, she said.  De Vere, who had been hunting in the forest, had a bottle of brandy in his pocket, and immediately producing' it, poured some into her mouth, which immediately restored her. As, she slowly opened her eyes she looked inquiringly around her; but not seeing the object of her thoughts, she inquired who had sa-ved her from certain death, at such imminent risk of his own life. Susan remained silent for a moment, then replied, "This young man, Mr. de Vere." She had quite naturally come to that conclusion, for she had seen no other person. De Vere looked searchingly into the face of Miss Medla, but was unable to recall the name of her who evidently recollected him, since his departure for a foreign land, from whence he had but just returned. Miss Medla, smiling, said: "You can scarcely recognize. Lilla's little playmate after so long an absence. Susan Medla is no longer a child." "Susan Media " exclaimed De Vere; "yes, but it is no more than I ought to expect. So Lilla is a fine young lady I I beg, your pardon, I have not yet seen her; I did not write when I should arrive, and I found my family absent on a plea- sure excursion. For that reason I repaired hither, to pass the 13'                  M )*  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7463-00000154"/> 298       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE interval in hunting and fishing. But I have the greatest cause to rejoice in the rescue of your fair friend."' It was now time for Cecelia to express her gratitude for his timely intercession in her behalf. This Cecelia acknowledged  with the grace so peculiar to her, but an ill-concealed disap.- pointment in her manner. This to De Vere passed unnoticed. Knowing that Nelford was to go South immediately, and there was no immediate danger of being discovered in the falsehood which had received  corroboration from Miss Media, why should he not bear the. praise due his absent friend, who was too modest to claim even deserved thanks.  De Vere had been a wild, reckless youth, whom his parents found it so hard to reclaim that they resolved to send him away  from his associates into a foreign land, where he would have to  encounter the difficulty of an unknown language, and the pre- s cepts of a worthy missionary, into whose care they intrusted him. After he had remained there some time, and became  familiar with the language and the habits of the people, Mmr. de Vere entered into trade with the inhabitants, young De Vere acting as agent for his father. In this manner he had acquiredl a princely fortune, his father allowing him all the proceeds of  money invested on the island. Holding this as an agent of his  father, he found no difficulty in plunging into debt, all of which debts contracted he left unliquidated, and came away with his  ill-gotten wealth in his possession, yet in such a manner that the laws could not reach him. It is not to be wondered that he should so willingly take to himself a generous act, the like of'  which would have never entered his selfish brain. Not for a  dozen of the nearest and dearest of his friends, would he have: ventured a descent upon the slender vine which hadc been the means of Cecelia's rescue, in the hands of Nelford. Offering his arm to the still weak and trembling girls, he begged leave to see them safe to the seminary. On the way, he offered manyan insinuating and but half-concealed complimentt 4uu U JYIVIUIUlllrv   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       299 to both of the fair listeners. He spoke of his long absence, of his poverty in a strange land, unacquainted with the man- ners of the country, and recited the. little means with which his father supplied him during his studies with the worthy missionary. Lastly, he spoke of his succeeding in his education, and his0father furnishing him the means of trade on the island. Then modestly hinted at the immense wealth he had returned in possession of.                           1 This to Cecelia was a very interesting story, and raised the speaker, of whom she had formed a low estimate, materially in her eyes. Before relinquishing the hand of Cecelia, he begged leave to call and inquire after her health. Cecelia a t first felt disposed to refuse this courtesy, but grati- r tude kept her silent, and smiling her acquiescence, she followed Susan to her apartment. The instructors were informed by De Vere of the accident Cecelia had sustained, and they hastened to her room to inquire after her. Mrs. Weston brought her wine, then desired her to lie down and rest, while'Susan should sit beside her. Cecelia complied, but no sooner had Mrs. Weston closed the door and forbidden any one disturbing her, than Cecelia requested Susan to rest with her. Susan gladly obeyed and the two girls slumbered a long while, after the time specified by the careful Mrs. Weston. The succeeding morning Cecelia received a bunch of the rarest wild flowers, still damp with dew. - A slip of paper was wound around them, requesting the pleasure of seeing her in the parlor at two o'clock that afternoon. Cecelia tore the paper into small pieces, while conjecturing what excuse she could form for refusing to see the preserver of her life; for such she considered De Vere. She well recol- lected the voice and look of one who said, "Be firm-I will try to save you," but she fancied it a delusion of the brain, caused by the fearful peril she was in. At  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7463-00000155"/> 300       CECELTA GREY; OR, THE De Vere, profiting by his falsehood, became a daily visitor at the seminary, the teachers offering no opposition to the calls of  so noble an individual. Susan was distressed at the serious appearance of attention on the part of De Vere and the pleasure expressed by Cecelia in his conversation. She did not wish to injure De Vere in the estimation of Cecelia; nor did she know a rehearsal of his early follies would do more than prejudice Cecelia against her- self. Besides, De Vere appeared well, and he might have re. formed. Then why awaken a suspicion of his faults, if really there were none. Thus situated, she tried to content herself with withdrawing Cecelia as much as possible from his society. The calls of De Vere became more and more interesting to  Cecelia, till she began to look for his arrival almost with ima. patience. Not that she loved him, far from that-she was merely amused with his intelligence, and the display of his ready wit. She was too much at her ease in his society to love;  yet she thought she had never seen any one half so interest-  ing. She would smile at the anxiety that would make her listen for the call down to the parlor, but did not for an instant desire him to remain with her one moment longer than he could interest her with details of something new. Charles Nelford left the scene of his almost superhuman ex- ertions, with his heart overflowing with thankful gratitude to his Redeemer for the strength and fortitude yielded him, to enable him to save the life of one whom he loved with pure and perfect affection. He had striven against his love in vain, and came to the conclusion that after his return from the South, he would in the interim, before leaving his native land, strive to win her for his wife. At first it had seemed a selfish thought, but persuaded by his sister, he had come to the conclusion that it would be better for her to leave her friends and be surrounded with the influences of religion, than remain at home in idle luxury, surrounded with fashion, ambition and pride. He did   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       301 not wish her to be influenced by gratitude to follow him, and he welcomed with pleasure the assistance of De Vere, and hast- ened back to the house at'which he was then a visitor. Alpha was exceedingly alarmed at the bloody and soiled ap- pearance Charles exhibited on his arrival. Upon inquiry he satisfied the curiosity of the people by saying he had been engaged in assisting to raise a person who had fallen from the precipice, and clung to some vines. Alpha took the earliest opportunity to learn the particulars. Trembling at the danger her brother had escaped, she was vexed that he did not stay and declare himself. She asserted that he was too much afraid of seeming worthy in the eyes of Cecelia, to ever appear so.  The ensuing day, Charles and Alpha Nelford returned home, and the succeeding morning started on their journey south. While in the cars they overheard a conversation respecting the rescue of Cecelia, which set Charles Nelford at rest upon the subject of Cecelia's recognizing him. Two gentlemen taking a back'seat, one them observed: "I would never have'thought Isaac de Vere capable of so noble an act as that of rescuing a person from such extreme peril, at the risk, too, of having his neck broken. I can hardly believe there is not some mistake. Are you quite sure?" "Quite!" replied the gentleman addressed; "I heard the lady express her gratitude in no measured terms to her deliv- erer. Cecelia Grey is not the one to feign. If De Vere wins her, he will win a noble prize." Charles felt his head swim, and he reclined heavily upon the seat. Alpha requested a glass of water, which he drank hastily. The little interruption occasioned both gentlemen to remain silent for some moments ; when one again spoke : "Pshaw! Villers, DeVere has never given a thought to wearing the fair flower, or Miss Grey of his love, either; she does not like De Vere, that is plain." "I hope you speak truly," replied his companion.

What a pity Miss Grey's cousin, Emily Lee, is South with her brother; they would make an envied couple. She is just his ideal of woman, and Miss Lee will fall in love with his elegant figure and wealth." "Have you heard the alleged reason for the brilliant beauty's  leaving the metropolis?" inquired the first gentleman. "Miss Emily Lee 1-no indeed!" replied the other. "Then," resumed the first, "I will enlighten you. Miss Alice Lee, the music teacher, is her sister, and engaged to be married to a mechanic by sthe name of Harwood. Her step-father solicited the. pleasure of having the nuptial ceremony per-- formed in his house, and her mother naturally desired her daughter to stay some little time with her, previous to her mar- riage. Miss Emily, taking umbrage at the thought of associat- ing with a plebeian mechanic, and receiving him in her aristo. cratic home, resolved to leave him to be entertained .by the other members of the family. She Is said to have forbidden her sister to speak with or address her, so long as she persisted in noticing the Harwoods."  "Well," replied the other, " what does Miss Ada Lee say to such arrangements?" "Oh i" resumed the first, "Ada is delighted with the pros- pects of a wedding. She is quite friendly with the Harwoods, calling there almost daily. Delphin, too, is on the tip-toe of anticipation." ' At this moment the conductor called out "Duttonville," and the two gentlemen left the train. We will leave the Nelfords to pursue their journey, and return to Cecelia, who listened to the twice repeated anecdotes of the fastidious De Vere, until one afternoon he failed to call at the usual hour. With slight disappointment, Cecelia resumed her studies, and Susan strove to make the loss of his attention rather agreeable than otherwise. One, two, three days-a week- passed away   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       303 and no news from De Vere. Cecelia began to wonder how she had offended him; but she felt no pain or anxiety on account of his inattention. Cecelia received a letter from her parents, inclosing one from Alice. 'The one from her parents informed her that they would come for her the ensuing week, and if agreeable, she could invite Miss Media home with her, for they would take Susan to the city with them to attend the wedding of Alice. The letter  from Alice informed Cecelia of her intended nuptials, and re- quested her presence at the marriage ceremony. Cecelia informed Susan -of her parents'.intentions, and it was arranged to that effect.  Cecelia and Susan took leave of their teachers and school- mates on the morning of their return home, and not without tears could they speak the last good bye.  Cecelia had beea-an inmate of the seminary three years, and  i Susan four. It is not strange that they became much attached to their teachers and companions. Mrs. Weston felt almost a mother's anxiety for these her best pupils, and while she gave the parting kiss, she bade them write often, and let her share in their welfare, happiness, and . sorrows. Patrick thought the "good bye" would -never be spoken, while he sat on the carriage, snapping his whip, or whistling with impatience. At last he had them seated in the carriage, and drove away, with twenty voices ringing in his ears. "Why, Patrick," exclaimed Cecelia, "could you not wait till I could speak the parting word?" "The word would never be for parting, if I had waited for it to do so," replied Patrick. "Patrick, you are getting cross," resumed Cecelia ; "what is the trouble with you?" "Trouble enough," said Patrick ; "a sick child at home, poor Mary all worn out, and myself out here when I should be at home minding them."  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7463-00000157"/> 304       CECELIA G:REY; OR, THE            X "Mamma will not let them suffer, Patrick," replied Cecelia,- grieved at the surly looks of Patrick, as much as the trouble in  which poor Mary was placed. Patrick hardly took the trouble to assist them- to alight  when they reached home; and Mr. Grey informed them that Patrick occasionally became intoxicated, and was cross and disagreeable at such times; that poor Mary was sorely tried with him, and for her sake they had kept them, thinking if he were to live by himself he would indulge his appetite more freely.                            I After tea they sat for an hour with Mrs. Grey, and then retired for the night. Mr. Grey had met with several severe losses during the past  season, and was unable to do by Cecelia as he wished to, and it  grieved him to be obliged to curtail the allowance of his only child i The morning after their arrival, the two girls passed in talking of their future hopes. Susan expected her betrothed would arrive in the city perhaps before her. His letters spoke of hopes realized beyond his most sanguine expectations. Cecelia anticipated no particular happiness in the future. She was only fearful her father's prospects would become worse, instead of improving.' But she listened attentively to Susan's plans, almost wishing herself in Susan's place, that she might be able to assist her parents. If her father had not written to her that he should attend the wedding of Alice, she would never consented to have done so ; but her promise had been given to  Susan to return to the city with her, and she could not with- draw her promise without exposing her father's perplexi- ties. For a week they rambled 'about the fields and groves, or joined the young people of the neighborhood in rides, or sails upon the lake. Then with Mr. and Mrs. Grey repaired to the city. Ada was at the depot on their arrival, and welcoming them,   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       305 led them to a carriage waiting to convey them to her father's residence. Mrs. Lee looked old and care-worn when seated by the side of Mrs. Grey, who, although some years her senior, still looked half a dozen years younger.   But beauty had lost its oharm with Mrs. Lee; she no longer saw in it a thing to be coveted. Alice looked happy as she presented her intended to her  uncle and aunt, and Ada declared she was going to wear the  orange flowers herself, as she was soon to be a bride. "There is young Ernot, Miss Medla," observed Mrs. Lee;  "he came back in company with the Elisons ; they say he is immensely rich." Susan was unable to reply, and Cecelia inquired when they arrived. "Last evening," replied Mrs. Lee, " and they will be with  us to-night."- Ada left the room with Cecelia to arrange their toilet, and Cecelia chose a dress of azure and silver ;- Ada, as bridesmaid, chose a similar dress to that worn by the bride, simple white; while Susan selected a pale dun color, a favorite with Mr- Ernot, and one he had wished her to wear when they next met, if possible, as a token that he had not been forgotten. Everything wore a joyous look. The family sitting-room was lighted, and adorned as if for a party. Alice had strictly  enjoined that the drawing-room should be closed to the guests invited to attend the wedding; but-Ada had taken care to  have everything in honor of the bride. Alice wished for no  display. She thought no one could or did rejoice at her  humble marriage, and felt vexed at the congratulations showered upon them. Ada stood clasping a hand of Susan soon after the ceremony, when two gentlemen advanced to their side, and drawing a hand of each within their own, walked leisurely about for a few  moments, and then seated their fair partners in the farthest  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7463-00000158"/> 306       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE recess of the window, one facing the hall, the other the conser. vatory. "Have you forgotten our early love?" inquired . Elison of Ada. "Ask your own heart," replied Ada. "Then I would reply-you have not forgotten," whispered Elison. "Never I no, not for one moment have you been forgotten," replied Ada.  "Thank you-thank you, dearest," continued Elison. "You too have been a living idol in my heart, and now I come with my father's blessing, to solicit your hand, first of you, then of your father. Can I hope there lies no difficulty with him?" "I cannot say," replied Ada; "you must learn of him yourself." Susan salt silent in the window where her lover had placed  her, while he gazed steadily upon her. At last he spoke : "You have not altered, Susan-not altered like me. But my heart is the same, although I have grown so old with care and toil. And this dress assures me that you are the same in heart. Bless you, dearest, for this token of my remembrance. It made my heart glad to see you thus arrayed. I have seen your father, and he says if I can win your consent he will not now oppose our union." "My consent you have already won," replied Susan, frankly. "My father's approbation was almost beyond my expectation. I am  happy to have a father's blessing to sanction our union." Cecelia joyed in the happiness expressed by the speaking face of her friend ; with no less gratification because she was denied the happiness allotted her. That night Cecelia shared the apartment of her friend for the last time, and Susan spoke freely to her, of her approach- ing marriage.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       307  Cecelia passed the ensuing day with Alice in her new home, where Nella welcomed her with a sister's tenderness. Alice was still to teach music. She would not accept the proffered assistance of her step-father-determined to earn for herself a home. And here we will leave them and return with Cecelia to her country residence.  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7463-00000159"/> 308       CECELIA GOEY; OR, THE CHAPTER   XXVII. MRS. GREY allotted to Cecelia her tasks day by day. She must learn to cook, wash and iron; those were accomplish- ments necessary to finish her education. Cecelia did not. much approve the firmness her mother displayed, in requiring her at all times to have her work done at such a moment. She thought, sometimes, it might do just as well to put off till the morrow something that was required to be done immediately, and fretted constantly while engaged with the task. Thus a few weeks passed without any particular. inci- dent to break the monotony of country life, until one evening Patrick arrived from the village with a package of letters and papers, which Cecelia eagerly took possession of. In looking over the letters, she found two for herself, one for her mother, and another for her father. Passing the letter to her mother, saying, "It is from Aunt Mary," she broke the seals of her own, remarking : "This, mamma, is from Ada, and that from Susan, inclosing her card and her husband's. So they are married, and dear Susan tells me they have started on a wedding tour. She wishes me to make her a visit after her return."  Then lifting her eyes from the other letter, she exclaimed: This, mamma, is an invitation to act as bridesmaid for Ada I She says she has our dresses made exactly alike, so that when I get married I will not have the trouble of ordering one.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       309 What nonsense, mamma; do you think papa will go or must I send an excuse?" "Your father will go, Cecelia, if you wish to attend the bridal. Your aunt informs me that Ada wishes you to join them in the bridal tour. One Isaac de Vere is to stand up  with Mr. Elison; the same I suppose that rescued you from falling from the grape-vines upon the rocks. You must recol- lect that gratitude may be the only return he is worthy of receiving for the generous act-since his wealth precludes any other return from us." Cecelia made no reply to her mother's pointed remarks, seeming suddenly to become very much engaged with the pie- tures of her magazine. But in reality searching in her mind for the reason of De Vere's sudden departure from the vicinity of the seminary; or the possibility of his being offended at some fancied slight from her. It was neither. De Vere on his return to the hotel, the afternoon he last called upon Cecelia, found an old acquaintance from the city, accompanied by his sister, who were about to leave for a fashionable Watering-place some distance from there. The gentleman expressed his pleasure at meeting him, and said: "Join us, my good fellow ; I will find better recreation for you than scrambling ever these hills, watching for owls and squirrels. Come with us, and let the poor innocents live." A smile from the lady decided De Vere to comply; and in a short time he was far from the scene of his chivalry, forgetful of Cecelia and careless what she might think of his strange departure. So long as the gaiety of the season permitted him to forget, was the lovely girl lost to his ikemembrance."' When the unusual excitement wore away and fashion became dull, he looked around for quiet, but found none. Then the image of Cecelia arose in his mind. "She is a sweet girl," he soliloquized ; so accomplished, she would grace a palace. '1  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7463-00000160"/> 310       CECELIA GREY; OR THE,  But poor-what then? I have wealth enough; indeed I do not wish for more. I think I will win her for a bride. Yes, I will seek her out on my return to the city. There is no danger of her saying nay; indeed, she will consider herself fortunate!" Thus saying, De Vere caught up his hat and sauntered away to the spring, where he joined a number of ladies in a walk; flirting with a dark eyed beauty, distin- guished for her bon-mots and intelligence. Thus the time wore away until he received a message from his parents to return home.1 De Vere was annoyed to find his sister the bride of a, wealthy southerner, some thirty years her senior. He had hoped to enter society with his sister under his protection, but found himself'disappointed in the cherished hope. Annoyed at the airs of Lilla, and disgusted with her gouty old millionaire, he refused to join the family in a fjour of the lakes, and was left at liberty to seek amusement for himself at  home. He was not long in discovering the relation existing between the Lees and Greys, and learning the engagement of Ada, he sought the acquaintance of Elison, and soon after was called his rhost particular friend, and chosen as such for bridesman. He readily promised to join the bridal train, on their antici- pated pleasure tour, considering the society of Cecelia sufficient inducement for him to do so. * Cecelia was not a little surprised and embarrassed at meet- ing De Vere in the family parlor of the Lees, the first morning after their arrival in the city. De Vere advanced with the ease of an old acquaintance and accomplished gentleman, to the side of Cecelia, paying her marked attention. Mrs. Grey watched him with ill-concealed dislike, which only made De Vere more persevering in his endeavors to please Cece- lia. Having formed the resolution of marrying soon, and think- ing he could not possibly find a companion better fitted for   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       3" happiness than her, and knowing her poverty, he sought not-  cared not for her parents' favor, providing Cecelia was pleased.   l Yet he was civil and obliging to them, appearing to strive by gentle means th overcome their evident dislike. De Vere was ever at Cecelia's side-reading, walking, talk-     I ing, or singing with her, and he seemed only to consult her     , pleasure. It is no wonder, then, that Cecelia forgot the mid-     night orisons, or that the voice of the unknown ceased to      i warble in her ears. Indeed, in her morning-prayer another name trembled upon her lip, and she learned to listen to a foot- step instead of a song. She never inquired, "Do I love him?" Her heart would have repelled the idea. But she dreamed on in unconsciousness ; never thinking how the many hours 'slipped so quickly, or heeding aught but the moment De Vere should send her her evening bouquet, or request her company in the parlor or the library. The week sped quickly by, and Ada's dresses were all made with the additional ones ordered for Cecelia ; and there was nothing more but the wedding, and De Vere would have Cece- lia all to himself- through the long summer days and delightful evenings. Immediately after dining, Cecelia repaired to the dressing- room of Ada to assist her to pack her trunks for the morrow, after which her mother assisted her with her own. Cecelia knew not why she dreaded being alone with her mother. She knew her dislike to De Vere, and felt almost angry towards-her for it. Her mother had no right to dislike her preserver, she thought. Contrary to her expectations, Mrs. Grey made no remark in regard to De Vere ; only when she left her, while the tears and kisses deluged her brow and cheek, she charged her, again and again, not to forget, amid the new scenes among which she was going, the duty she owed her God, or do aught her conscience would reproach her for. Telling her mother, not to be anxious on her account while  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7463-00000161"/> 312       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE she was away, Cecelia kissed her again, and Mrs. Grey went to the room of Ada. "My dear good mother 1" thought Cecelia, as she saw her pass through the open door, " ever trying to do good. I won- der what consolation she has to offer the soon-to-be bride, for yielding up all hopes of happiness for this life, into the keep. ing of the individual who has so nobly won her, waiting from childhood for his youthful bride. They loved even in youth, it is said; their constancy has been well tried, and I am sure they will be happy." Cecelia rung for lights, that she might find her hat and gloves, as she had promised Alice to pass the evening with her. For the first time since she left home, she hoped De Vere might not be in sight, for she wished to walk around to her cousin's uninterrupted by his remarks. Bridget, the Irish ser- vant, could go with her and act as her protector. As she descended the marble steps of the mansion, she saw De Vere, but not in time to pass unnoticed. De Vere quickened his pace, and with a "permit me, Miss Grey," drew her hand within his arm. Bridget followed slowly the footsteps of the two, uncertain whether to proceed or return, as Cecelia made known no wishes in respect to her. De Vere stopped at the door of the Harwoods, requesting the pleasure of calling for her when'she returned. Cecelia said she would be ready to walk back at nine o'clock. De Vere pressed her hand to his lips, and turned slowly away. Bridget, who overheard this arrangement between Cecelia and De Vere, turned into another street, and hastened to the residence of her mother, where she passed a hpy evening, and arrived home the same moment Cecelia enteredlhe parlor. Alice was waiting anxiously for the appearance of Cecelia, and the bell was scarcely touched ere Alice appeared, looking       k lc  perd okn   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       313      ! ,! ii happy and contented as few do. Cecelia had expected to see her sad and weary, confined as she was during the day in teaching, and evening sewing with Nella. Mrs. Lee had pitied Alice so much the only evening she had called, that Cecelia concluded Alice must be wretched, leading a slave's life. But the bright eyes and rosy cheeks of her cousin assured her that Alice Harwood was far happier than Alice Lee had ever been. "Poverty does not diminish my attractions, does it, cousin?" laughingly inquired Alice, observing the scrutinizing glance Cecelia gave her. Cecelia felt annoyed, scarcely knowing how to answer the inquiry. "You certainly look better than I ever saw you before," she stammered; "but I did not know that you were poorer than you formerly were." "Well spoken, Cecelia," responded Alice; "you seem to be the only one of my friends that is aware of that fact. I am glad some one can understand that my husband is my equal in point of wealth, and in intellectual endowments you have only to become acquainted With him to learn his superiority. Dear Ralph I I only wonder how he can love me, insulted as he has been by my only sister. But he says, and truly, that she and I are not in the least alike. Poor-poor Emily, she seeks for happiness where it is not. Wealth cannot bring hap- piness; only in contentment are true riches, if she would only believe it. I fear that she will, like her favorite Lilla de Vere, contract a marriage with wealth and misery. You knew Lilla was married?' Cecelia had been busy thinking of the marriage which had     r been spoken of very highfy to her, as a very fortunate one for Lilla de Vere ; but the millionaire lost his attraction by rheu- matism. Then, for the first time, she thought of De Vere's  evident dislike of mentioning his sister or the new alliance; and she felt a new sensation for him-a sensation of pity, that he should be compelled to witness his youthful sister tied up to " E  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7463-00000162"/> 314       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE the hoar frost of age. From that time she became absent and thoughtful, and Alice was more pleased than herself whenl De Vere came with a carriage to convey her home. De Vere found it impossible to obtain more than an audible effort at conversation from Cecelia; and thinking it was her dread of leaving her parents on the morrow, he curled his lips  in scorn, as he lifted her from the carriage and bade her adieu. Cecelia saw a light in the parlor, and entering, bade her  parents good night, and retired.- Early the ensuing morning, Mrs. Grey awoke Cecelia, and assisted her to dress as bridesmaid for Ada, who sent her maid for her the moment Mrs. Grey had placed the last rose in her hair. Ada was dressed and sat gazing upon the miniature of her. departed mother, which she pressed again and aogain to her lips, while the unshed tears glistened upon her eye lashes. "My dear mother is not here-not here within this senseless frame, or kiss would turn to kiss again," she murmured, and  rising, she requested Cecelia to fasten her veil. A rap at the door caused Ada to tremble slightly, as Cecelia stepped to the door to open it. "Elison and the minister are waiting," said the maid. Cecelia led Ada into the hall, where Elison and De Vere joined them, and they entered the family parlor. Mr. Lee received his daughter, kissed her, and gave her to Elison with-"God's blessing go with you, my child." As soon as the ceremony was performed, they breakfasted, and throwing on their travelling dresses, they took a hasty farewell of their parents, and entered the carriage which was to convey them to the wharf. i   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       315 CHAPTER     XXVIII. A STEAMER awaited them, and as soon as they were safely on board, sped merrily up the river. An elegant piano was in the ladies' apartment, which to Ada and Cecelia was an agreeable auxiliary to their enjoyment. De Vere would stand by the side of Cecelia, turning over, the leaves of the music, or whispering in low tones the pleasure her sweet voice gave him, or lament- ing the short time he might be allowed to pass by her side. To all this Cecelia only smiled, or made no reply. Knowing the great wealth of De Vere, and his pretended aristocratic pride, she had no idea that he would seek a wife from among the hills and valleys of a country town. She had supposed him only to aspire to the hand of some city belle-the daughter of a millionaire. He no longer rehearsed his oft-told anecdotes, and senseless witticisms, which had so annoyed Cecelia at the boarding- school. He seemed to have forgotten they had ever met, until the morning he saw her at her uncle's. Cecelia misconstrued his silence in regard to her rescue, for modesty ; which in reality was a wish not to repeat a falsehood openly which might some day be made public. Ada watched the growing intimacy between Cecelia' and De Vere with a mingled sensation of sorrow and joy. The reports detrimental to his moral character, she had not forgot- ten; and she blamed herself for throwing him so much into Ccclia's colmpany. Yet, as she watched him lnarrowly. she  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7463-00000163"/> 316       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE could detect no principles of falsehood or treachery. He was always urbane, upright, and gentlemanly in his manners and conversation. How could she poison the ear of Cecelia against one who, perhaps, after all, was more sinned against than sinful. "Charity at least shall command silence," she concluded, "unless I see something more than usual to excite my suspicion that Cecelia regards De Vere in any other light than as a friend;  and if I think she does, I will unfold to her candidly as I heard them the faults of his early days. But it may be the best mar- riage in the world for Cecelia, and I could daily have the plea. sure of her society and friendship. I almost hope he will win her for a wife, and have a home near us." Cecelia, meantime, loitered in her state-room, listening to the voice of De Vere and Elison, who were walking on deck. "We will leave the boat to-morrow," she heard Elison exclaim, "and take the stage for the Springs. Ada, I know, detests stage coaches, and we must secure the best, or one entirely to ourselves if possible. Now Cecelia would not care if it were a stone boat, so it carried her safe, I imagine." "Elison," she heard De Vere reply, "Miss Grey is a lady of as fastidious taste as Mrs. Elison. can boast, and possesses accomplishments such as few of the first in our city enjoy.  Your hint at her colmtry bringing up does you anything but credit, as a gentleman." "   Ah, De Vere," laughed Elison, "I meant no disparage- ment to Miss Grey, I will assure you. Mrs. Elison thinks'oo highly of her, for me to do otherwise than admire her; so I beg a thousand pardons. Come, take my arm ; we will go below and be the best of friends." "You cannot do otherwise than admire   Miss Grey,"' responded De Vere.  "Ir beauty, without her goodness, would command admiration anywhere." Cecelia heard Elison enter the room beyond, and the light laugh of Ada at some remark he addressed her. She doubted not they were making sport of De Vere, and rose from her seat   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      ' 317  to peep into the mirror, to see if indeed De Vere had spoken truly of her beauty. She started back, as a view of her face revealed the workings of her soul.  Gratified vanity and  pride, almost revenge, were plainly written upon her speak-  ing face. She sunk upon the floor, and buried her face in the cushions.  "Never-oh, never," she exclaimed, " let me look upon my face again, distorted by such worldly, selfish passion I Never before have I looked upon the hidden guilt of my soul-oh, how hateful it is I It mars the sweetest beauty. Oh, let my soul be pure, and I ask for no other charm 1" Humbled, she rose from her kneeling posture, and taking her bible from her pocket, read till all anger and pride had disap- peared from her heart, and a calm peace and joy sparkled from her eyes. *    *    *    *    *    * After tea, De Vere proposed a promenade on deck, and Cece- lia, throwing a light scarf around her, was about to leave the cabin when De Vere stopped her. "-Excuse me, Cecelia-Miss Grey. This thin scarf is not sufficient protection against the evening air." Cecelia smiled, and returning wrapped a shawl around her; when De Vere led her upon deck. For a short time they walked; the shade of twilight deepen- ing around them, till the woods and hills that skirted the shore seemed one dark mass of heavy clouds, such as one sees before a heavy storm. Cecelia almost shuddered as she looked upon them. "How dark and dreary it grows, Mr. de Vere 1" she ex- claimed. "It will soon grow lighter," he replied ; "let us find a seat, where we can see the first star of evening peep forth, from the blackness around it. Yonder, Cecelia, we shall soon see the young moon rise."  Cecelia turned her eyes in the direction pointed, just as the  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7463-00000164"/> 318       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE silver crescent appeared above the distant hills, and threw its mystic light over the forests across the waters, and upon the brow of De Vere, who removed his hat and shook back the masses of dark hair from his forehead, as if he joyed in its shadowing beams of light. Cecelia was an enthusiastic lover of nature, and as her eye took in the beauty of the scene, her companion pointed. to the lone star of evening, just twinkling above the horizon, saying: "How much do I resemble that far-off orb, compelled in loneliness to worship my queen, as in unrivalled splendor, with her myriads of attendants, she pursues her way across the azure arch of heaven; all turn their eyes to gaze upon her, while I, unheeded by the multitude, glide onward, sink into an unnoticed bed, to rise again, pursue my dull path, and again lie down in forgetfulness." "You are dejected this evening, Mr. de Vere," observed Cecelia. "If you resemble in aught yon lovely star, you have never found attendants and admirers enough." "Not when my queen is present," sighed De Vere; "at those times I am compelled to worship with the multitude, while her cold beams chill me with their pale light. Dearest Cecelia, let me tell you-you are my queen, and your coldness grieves me. I have loved you long and fervently since the hour I took you from the arms of death; you have been my life, my light, my hope, my all. Tell me, do I, must I love in vain? or will you live in my soul, exciting me to great and noble deeds, my joy and my happiness. Tell me, Cecelia, may I hope? Do you-can you love the lone star?" "I can-I will!" replied Cecelia, trembling with the effort, while the tears fell fast from her overburdened heart. She  thought she loved De Vere, while her excited fancy, combined with pity and gratitude, compelled her to give herself to him. The cold-hearted, designing wretch, who had wrung his   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      319 wealth from the widow's groans and the orphan's tears-whose acts had brought the strong man low, and made him weary of life--in the same soft, wiiinDg tone he had led them on, until they thought him perfect in goodness, upright in deeds, and strong in his integrity. Elison and Ada, wondering what kept Cecelia so late, resolved to join them-Elison, as well as Ada, thought it very unwise to have thrown Cecelia so much in the company of one whose reputation had not been good in his youthful days, although courted and flattered by the first of the present time. "It is no surety of his improvement in morals," resumed the voung wife, peering into her husband's face. "I could never forgive myself, if De Vere should marry Cecelia Grey, and it should turn out an unhappy alliance. We will try to keep them separate as much as possible." "Nonsense!" laughed Elison ; "I will assure you that would answer no good purpose. Let them consult their own inclinations, and it will turn out as well in the end. De Vere, I am afraid, already more than admires your young friend. If so, all we can do to the contrary would only increase the ardor of the pursuit. I very much fear De Vere is a designing scoun- drel. He has none of the principles that would be likely to win her love. Yet, blackness may admire the light, and in some degree conceal its own darkness.  I know not what to do-he will be apt to defeat his own object if let alone." Cecelia would make a wife for any man to be proud of," replied Ada. "We will take a turn on deck; that we can do Without appearing to regard them." To the quick eye of De Vere, the anxious glance of Ada was rightly interpreted. "Ah 1" thought he, ' the young wife remembers youthful indiscretions, and would fain withdraw her fair friend from my side.

Just as though a pure heart could be bought  with gold I ' She is mine now, and I shall not trouble myself further to please their fastidious fancies." As Elison and Ada advanced, De Vere and Cecelia arose to join them; and Elison and De Vere walked a short distance in advance of the ladies, to indulge a cigar, when Ada and Cecelia leazned upon the railing of the vessel, and Cecelia becoming dizzy, was precipitated into the water. The boat was moving much slower than usual, and Elison and De Vere distinctly saw her white dress in the waves. "A thousand dollars to the one that will rescue Miss Grey -my betrothed bride!" screamed De Vere. A stranger present-started as he heard the name, and in- stantly plunged into the water.       ^ Elison had by this time thrown off his coat, told Ada to go below, and followed the stranger to the rescue of Cecelia. Ada shrieked as Elison disappeared, then sunk upon her knees, and with clasped hands and streaming eyes, prayed that God in his mercy might save her husband. A stranger approached and kindly urged Ada to go below, but to this she would not listen for an instant. Every effort was made by the crew. to save those overboard, but it was feared, owing to the imperfect light, and the steamer having unavoidably passed some distance beyond, that they would all be lost. A boat was lowered, which had hardly measured twice its length from the steamer, ere a loud halloo sounded near at hand. Peering through the darkness, a fisherman's boat was seen, advancing rapidly towards them. The oarsmen answered the halloo, and in a moment were beside the small boat, which contained the three passengers who had fallen or sprung into the water. Cecelia lay unconscious in the arms of the stranger, who ever and anon smoothed back the tangled masses of her hair, and gazed upon the face of her who had twice been saved from death by his hand. Charles Nelford had been in the city, transacting business,   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       321 and was intending to pass one night at his father's before he returned to his labors in his southern home; and he had taken passage in the same steamer with Elison and his party. Owing to his keeping his room the most of the time, he had not observed Cecelia or De Vere until that evening. While pacing the deck he heard the voice of De Vere, but did not care about speaking with him. He had not the faintest suspicion that the lady by his side was Cecelia Grey, or he might have been more interested in them ; and not until he heard the cry of De Vere, did he think of risking his life in a trial which he could not but think must prove fatal to both. Although the words of De Vere told -him that Cecelia, if saved, was lost to him, yet he determined to save her, or perish in the attempt. A fisherman, with a small boat, had been across the river, and was returning when he saw the steamer approaching, and lay still for her to pass. While looking steadily towards the boat, he saw Cecelia fall overboard, and instantly went to her rescue. But before he reached the spot where he saw her dis- appear, another had dived below the surface of the water, and he reached the place of disaster just as Nelford rose to the surface with Cecelia in his arms, and assisted them both into his boat. This accomplished, they distinguished another object a short distance in advance, struggling in the water. The fisherman immediately went to his assistance, and picked up Elison. Nelford had thought this certainly must be De Vere trying to save his betrothed wife; and he nerved himself to place her in his arms. Elison tried in vain to learn the gentleman's name who had saved Cecelia; but Nelford persevered in silence, till about to lift his insensible burden on board the steamer; when De Vere, pale and excited, bent over the steamer's side, saying, "Is she safe? is my Cecelia saved?" "This poor man has won your thousand dollars, De Vere," "*  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7463-00000166"/> 322       CECELIA GREY; OR, TI      H replied Nelford in an assumed voice, pointing towards the fisher. man. Then laid his burden in De Vere's arms, and with one sad, long look, turned away. Nelford then retired to indulge his sorrow alone. "It is just!-oh God I thy decrees are just and merciful. For what have I given so much of my thoughts to this fair girl? Henceforth I will endeavor to serve thee with my whole heart and with undivided affection." With a calm, sad face, but firm step, he took up his portmanteau, and left the boat, which had that moment arrived at a landing. There were long rows of lights burning in the streets of the city that Nelford entered. But before stepping ashore, he in- quired of the captain, if the lady he had saved had become sensible. "The physician thinks she will soon be well," the captain replied. "She must have struck something either in falling or being rescued. There is a deep cut upon the left temple. See I your white vest is saturated with the blood!" Nelford started and turned pale; then hastily buttoning his black coat over his vest, he bade the captain good night, and hastened away. Taking the night stage for home he arrived there the ensu- ing day; and after a short stay with his parents, returned to his labors in the South. When he revealed to Alpha his hope- less love, he said: "Like you, sister, I am doomed to disappointment in my dearest earthly hopes. But I cannot, like you, look forward to a joyful re-union in a holier or happier sphere." *    *    *   *    *    *   *  Cecelia remembered distinctly her fall and sinking into the water, that a strong arm caught, and bore her upward, when it supported her on the surface of the water till the little boat came to their rescue. Then the deep melodious voice that had rung in her. ears when suspended over the precipice, again addressed her thus: "We are safe, Cecelia Grey-safe,   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       323 although lost to me forever. Still safe--Cecelia." She recol- lected, soon after, receiving a violent blow just above the temple, and nothing more distinctly till she found herself in her state-room, surrounded with anxious looks, and the low inquiries of several of the passenger who crowded around. Putting her hand to her head she felt a bandage around it, and was about to remove the handkerchief, when Ada inter- fered, saying: "Leave it till the morning, then perhaps it will do to remove the bandage. The physician thinks you were struck with the oar of the boat, or the boat itself. Your head is much swollen." "I feel well-only a little nervous and weak," replied Cece- lia, rising. The passengers left the room and she changed her wet gar- ments for dry, inquiring of Ada if she knew who it was that saved her from drowning? "Why, how can you ask?" replied Ada ; " do you not sup- pose it was your betrothed husband?" "No-no 1" exclaimed Cecelia; "it was not De Vere 1" "No," resumed Ada, sadly; "it was not De Vere, nor am I able to tell you who it was. Elison has made every inquiry but without effect. 'The stranger desired to b e put ashore as soon as possible after the accident. How far superior to De Vere in every respect-excuse me, dear Cecelia ; I cannot bear to think you should become the wife of De Vere." Cecelia made no reply, but seemed, by her silence, to fear the same. A rap at the door caused Ada to inquire who was there? when De Vere desired to speak with Cecelia. Cecelia threw a shawl over her head so as to hide the band- age, and Ada went in search of her husband. "Dear Cecelia 1" exclaimed De Vere as soon as they were alone, pressing her hand to his lips, " you cannot imagine my terror when I saw you disappear in the water." "I should think you were terrified," replied Cecelia.  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7463-00000167"/> 324       CECELIA GREY; ORE THE "If I had not had the greatest presence of mind," resumed De Vere, "you would certainly have been lost. That alone restrained me from springing into the water after you. But I wisely controlled my feelings, and offered a reward for your recovery, which I knew would prove of more avail to those around than the life so dear to me. It was as I had suspected. A stranger immediately strove to save you, and by my exer- tions I had the boat lowered and the -steamer put back imme. diately, so as to pick you up. It is well that my presence of mind did not forsake me at that critical moment, or we both might have perished." "You were very thoughtful, Mr. de Vere," replied Cecelia. "Thoughtful!" echoed De Vere--"I see, you would have had me spring into the water to rescue you, and we might have died in each other's arms. A very romantic end, surely. But I was not quite ready to relinquish life or the new hope you had but just inspired in my heart. I think I have been the direct means of saving you, my dear girl." "What did you offer for my rescue?" inquired Cecelia. u"A thousand dollars," haughtily replied De Vere. "I am sorry," replied Cecelia; " why did you make such a foolish offer? I think I would have been saved without it." "You would? Indeed!" ejaculated De Vere. "Dear Cecec lia; do not be prudish ; I paid that sum for your rescue as I promised to do." For some time Cecelia, remained silent and thoughtful; at last she inquired. "What am   I to do now?-proceed as I am    to the Springs?"  "I have been thinking, Cecelia," said De Vere, " that as this boat returns to the city immediately after receiving her cargo and passengers, we would remain on board, and return in her. Elison and Ada can get along without us, especially as Ada has her maid with her.  Your parents were to remain a few days at your uncle's, and we will get there before they leave,   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       325 and you can go home with them. You would make an odd appearance at a fashionable watering-place with that ugly wound upon your head, which will take some time to heal." "I will return," replied Cecelia, faintly. The succeeding morning Elison and his bride, pursued their journey, and Cecelia with De Vere returned to the city where Mr. and Mrs. Grey still remained. De Vere made his own statement to Cecelia's friends of the accident, and wound up the narrative by formally demanding the hand of Cecelia from her father.  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7463-00000168"/> 326       CECELIA GREY; OR, TrHE CHAPTER   XXIX. I trusted in an empty sound- A false deceitful tongue; I joy that my life is not bound With that false-hearted one. MR. GREY replied that if he had won the affections of his daughter, he had no objection to offer to their union in one year from that time. He wished to test his affection by this short trial, as well as keep their only child with them a while longer. He might also have added that he would like to learn more of the man to whom they were to yield their dearest earthly treasure. Mrs. Grey folded Cecelia to her heart and wept bitterly at the thought of giving her to De Vere. Yet she thought it use- less to try to break their engagement, and she mourned in silence, praying and imploring Heaven to protect Cecelia from evil, and make her path one of light and joy. That evening De Vere passed with Cecelia, discoursing of the future, and the happiness that awaited them. He painted in glowing colors the paradise he would prepare for her-the ser- ,vants that should come and go at her command, the rides they would take, the parties they would make-in short, of every- thing excepting the silent happiness they would enjoy when away from the giddy world ; loving and being loved with pure and holy affection-affection that should last while life and memory existed.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUlNE.      327 Cecelia thought the picture beautiful which he held up to her admiring gaze, but felt there was something wanting to complete its loveliness. What it was she knew not. Had he not promised to surround her with every luxury her own or a foreign land could supply? "Everything' "she murmured, "that the heart can wish for? And still--I cannot think or see aught that will give me happiness in such a home. Some- thing is wrong, surely I Do I not love De Vere?2 she solilo- quized. "I do not know-I certainly do not hate him, and I don't know but I love him! At least he loves me, and I will learn to love him. It is no more than a just recompense for the kindness he has shown me. Besides, has 4e not been the image of my waking thoughts for these malay days.  The sharer of all my hopes, and the conmpanion of' all my excur- sions. It must be that I love him, better than-than I ever shall love any one, that ever will love me. And to love an unknown individual, as I have sometimes fancied I did, is pre- posterous. I will no longer indulge in such weak vagaries, but give De Vere my whole heart which he nobly merits." The ensuing day Cecelia took an early leave of her be- trothed, and returned to her country home. When fairly in possession of her little apartment, the one she had occupied so many years,-she was more happy than she had been for many weeks previous. A lonely calmness seemed to settle around her, and peace and quiet to rest in her soul; while content- ment nestled upon her pillow, and the low winds sung her lull- aby. Fancying herself rocked by the zephyr-breeze, while supported by a gold-tinged cloud, she slept; and dreamed that she was falling, softly, slowly sinking down-down. At last a well-known voice addressed her, a strong arm supported her; she looked in the face of her preserver, and saw the brother of Alpha Nelford. As he placed her upon the firm ground, she turned to thank him, and saw De Vere standing in the very place she had thought occupied by Nelford, and with a start she awoke.  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7463-00000169"/> 328       CECELIA.

Yet, it was undoubtedly De Vere who saved me from the first imminent peril, as surely as he was the means of doing it in the last. A few weeks later, Cecelia received a letter, from De Vere breathing the fondest affection in every line, and promising soon to come and pass a week at her father's house, that her parents might become better acquainted with him, and he enjoy the presence and conversation of his betrothed. Cecelia replied to his letter soon after,. and expressed her pleasure from his promised visit. De Vere wrote again, telling her when to expect him, and explaining the lonely life he led, amid scenes of gaiety and dis- sipation, and promising to leave his rude associates as soon as married, and live for her alone. The following week a handsome travelling carriage stopped before the residence of Ars. Grey, from which alighted De Vere ; who addressed a few-words to the driver, and hastily crossed the lawn to the house. Cecelia awaited him in the hall, where they exchanged greet- ings, and she conducted him into the parlor, where Mrs. Grey received him with forced politeness. Cecelia, in spite of every effort to the contrary, appeared sad, and took advantage of the slightest pretence to leave the room. De Vere, with all his knowledge of the world, and boasted perception of the human heart, still mistook Cecelia's dejection for bashfulness. Cecelia could not help seeing that De Vere was an unpleasant visitor to her mother, and the more she reflected - upon the probable cause of her -parents' dislike, the more she became  convinced that she could never be happy with him;   TICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       329 and consequently she felt an aversion to his society, which com- pelled her to retire from the room, whenever politeness would permit. De Vere was delighted with Cecelia's modesty, and thought it a presage of the firmest and purest affection. - It was a warm sultry day in August that De Vere returned from a stroll in the fields and forests to find Cec elia absent from home. Upon inquiry, he learned that she had walked to the vicarage, and had not yet returned, and he immediately resolved to call there for her.  V Cecelia was sitting between Mrs. Rudolph and her youngest daughter, discoursing upon the arts of deception, when De Vere appeared, coming up the walk. Cecelia was very much annoyed, and failed in entirely hiding her displeasure from Mrs. Rudolph. Upon De Vere's entering the room, Cecelia rose and introduced him to her friends, then requesting her hat and shawl, prepared to return home. "My love P" exclaimed'De Vere, ' I am happy to see you so readily divine my wishes. The house was so lonely without you that I could not endure the solitude." Cecelia turned scarlet at this public -announcement of his affection, and with an 6ffort she made an audible reply, then bade Mrs. Rudolph and her daughter adieu, a smile following her as she disappeared down the walk, leaning upon the arm of De Vere, who affectedly supported her.  Cecelia said little while walking home; and on her arrival shut herself in her room, and gave way to a passionate burst of tears. "How ridiculous De Vere made himself to-day," she vehemently ex- claimed.  ' Do I love him or respect him sufficiently to become his wife-compelled hourly to witness his affected ways and speeches? How can I endure it? And I have promised to become his wife--to love, cherish, aud respect him. My father, too; welcomes him as his son, and together they discourse of future arrangements; and papa begins to enjoy the society of De Vere, while the more I become acquainted with him, the  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7463-00000170"/> 330       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE more I despise him I Yes, despise him I Can I enter into the bonds of wedlock, knowing that I shall in time detest him, whom I must promise to love till death?

I will yet hide my reaT feelings, at least till time has cooled my anger. Then, perhaps, perhaps-but I cannot believe he will ever become less disagreeable to me." Mrs. Grey, wondering at the strange absence of Cecelia dur. ing the visit of her betrothed, sent to inquire if she were ill. Cecelia answered by appearing in the sitting-room herself, * Smilingly she tried to do the agreeable, and succeeded so well that the most critical eye could not distinguish her false viva- city from real pleasure. Even Mrs. Grey began to like De Vere, who could entertain and amuse Cecelia in so singular a manner, De Vere retired that night with a smile of satisfaction curl- ing his lips ; he thought he had conquered the dislike of the parents of Cecelia, and made Cecelia happy by so doing. "It is as well to cage a happy bird," he soliloquized, "as to imprison a pining one. Cecelia is happy in the approbation of her parents. She is one of those sensitive creatures that would never be contented without their approval of her choice. I will be careful to never give her occasion to weep; her eyes are too bright to let a tear-drop tarnish their lustre., Cecelia entered her room with a sigh of relief, instead of a joyful smile. She took a small gold case from her pocket and from it the miniature of De Vere ; and holding it close to the light she looked long and sadly upon it. Then returning it to its case, she murmured, "Yes, I will marry 'De Vere; be dotes upon me, and my parents approve my choice.   May Heaven grant that I may not utter a falsehood at the marriage altar." Two days after, De Vere returned to his home in the city. *    *    *   ss    e   *    *   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.        331 Emily Lee, who had been absent from the city since the marriage of her sister Alice to Ralph Harwood, on hearing of the marriage and absence of Ada, returned to the house of her step-father. Her first move was to request her mothller to solicit 'of Mr. Lee a party, she having been absent at the time of the marriage of Ada. This wish being seconded by Delphin, was readily granted by Mr. Lee. Emily next called at the residence of Lilla de Vere, and upon learning of her absence with her husband, she returned hoime. On entering her mother's apartment, she exclaimed : "Oh I mamma, is it not provoking? Dear Lilla with her aristocratic husband, is absent, and there is no one to give me an introduction to her foreign brother, as Lilla designated him in her letter to me. What is to be done? It was to become acquainted with the brother of my dear friend that I formed the project of making a party to further the scheme i" "What scheme, child?" repliedMrs. Lee.

As it is, I would not come, only Cecelia will be gratified when I inform her of the particulars attending the party.' "De Vere is not the husband I would have chosen for a child of mine," continued Mrs. Lee.  "I know  your aunt is not entirely pleased with him; that, however, will not answer for Cecelia ; he is surely charmed with her." "Pshaw, mamma I Cecelia Grey marry the wealthy aristo- crat?

Cecelia is far too good for De Vere ; yet if she loves him, she will not be happy without him. Now, Emily, listen to me. His -wealth is but a poor recompense for the gifts Cecelia will bring him. Truth and a pure soul are above all price. So never speak again in such a light and trifling manner of your- cousin, who is not only above you in point of wealth, but in personal qualities. Think not that your step-father's wealth adds to your importance ; nothing can do so, so long as you retain the sentiments you daily and hourly express. Who is it, my child, that has poisoned your mind and deadened your per- ceptions to anything truly noble? Shun them as you would a viper, or turn from them as from the deadly asp." "Mother," slowly and deliberately replied Emily; " would you have me refuse to wed De Vere, if he should offer himself to me, because he had once been engaged to Cecelia?" "I would, my child?" said Mrs. Lee. ' I am glad there is no danger of his making any such offer; he appears to be sincerely attached to Cecelia." "Ah i" exclaimed Emily, " you will see how sincerely he is attached to her; he has never seen  Emily Lee yet. It remains to be told whether his affection for Cecelia Grey is permanent. I very much doubt it." "Emily," resumed Mrs. Lee, " if De Vere does not truly love Cecelia Grey he is unworthy of the regard of any one, and I would advise you to treat him very coolly in case he should make any advances more than a common, acquaintance." "Supposing I should make the first advances? He would not then be so much to blame for slighting Cecelia?" inquired Emily. "Nor you so much to be pitied for winning him," replied Mrs. Lee. "I would not desire the commiseration of any one. Envy would follow me,as surely as admiration, which has ever been my attendant," returned Emily,   V   H ll                         - THE rooms were crowded with richly dressed and beautiful women, but not one of their number could command the attention that this artful lady drew upon herself.--PAGE 833.  &#xD;<pb n="-333" xml:id="VAC7463-00000172"/> ^ [   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.        333 The mansion of the Lees was illuminated the evening ensuing the conversation between Emily and her mother, as if for a bridal. Lights danced in every room, servants ran to and fro, ; and music stole softly through the open casements, Amid the flowers of the conservatory, stood a young and beautiful lady, robed in a crimson bodice, laced with threads of gold, and skirt which wore the hue of the purple heliotrope, looped with laurel and jasmin; while her raven hair was braided with strings of pearls, and fastened on the left side with a bunch of bright, red carnations. HEer brilliant black eyes flashed beneath their drooping lids, while the long, silken lashes swept the cheek of the fair girl.- The rooms were crowded with richly dressed and beautiful women, but not one of their number could command the attention that this artful lady drew upon. herself. As she stood there among the fair exotic plants, tearing absently the petals of the petunia, a gentleman advanced towards her, led- forward by Delphin Lee. Miss Emily, let me present to your acquaintance, Mr. de Vere the affianced of your cousin Cecelia," said Delphin, bowing. Emily courtesied, as with a sad smile she addressed De Vere "The brother of my early friend," she exclaimed. "How surpassingly beautiful-what a superb creature I I never in all my life saw   her equal-no, never 1" inwardly exclaimed De Vere, as his eye took in the oriental richness of her attire. He thought not of Cecelia, as Emily's eye rested upon him with that look of sad, confidential friendship. He took the passive hand of Emily within his own, and led her from the room to the corridor, where, they conversed until Mrs. Lee joined them. "Emily, you will take cold in the damp, night air," she said ; "you had better go   in, your guests are surprised at your absence." "Mr. de Vere will assist in the station my duties as hostess require me to fill," replied Emily.  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7463-00000173"/> 334       CECELIA GREY; OR, TrIE "With pleasure," said De Vere, bowing; and he moved away with Emily, leaving Mrs. Lee alone. Grieved and morti. fied at the conduct of Emily, who, she plainly saw, was striv. iug to supplant Cecelia in the affections of De Vere, Mrs. Lee repaired to her apartment, and wrote to, Mrs. Grey, informino her of the position of De Vere in the city, and of Emily's inten. tions towards him ; and requested Mrs. Grey to allow Cecelia to come and remain some time with them to counteract the evil influence of Emily over De Vere. Mrs. Grey wrote in reply to Mrs. Lee that she had given her letter to Cecelia for her perusal, and that Cecelia wished Mrs. Lee to lay no obstacle in the way of De Vere's attentions to Emily, on account of her.  If De Vere chose any other than herself for a companion, she had no desire to have him fulfill his engagement with her. Mrs. Grey also requested  Mrs. Lee to "give herself no )uneasiness about the matter, but let De Vere and Emily con- sult their own wishes.  For her part, she would not be sorry to know the engagement broken between Cecelia and De Vere. Nor did she think it would affect Cecelia, who she could hardly believe regarded De Vere with any other sentiments than those of gratitude for preserving her life." From  the evening of the party, De Vere became a constant visitor at the Lees. He was perpetually by the side of Emily, who used the most strenuous efforts to win his love. They were one day walking in the suburbs of the city, when De Vere incidentally reverted to a stroll he had once taken with Cecelia in the same vicinity, at the same time plucking a sprig of lilac, whose language is the first emotions of love, lie swayed it around for a  few moments, then handed it to Emily, who took it with a   deep blush; then stooping, she plucked a flower of the cinquefoil, which is love constant, but hopeless, and handed the blossom to De Vere. De Vere, who  had lever once thought of breaking 1his engagement with Cecelia, for the first time recollected lie    VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       335 silent language of the tokens which had passed between them. H e was for a few moments embarrassed ; but the pleading look Emily gave him, conquered-his aversions to forsake Cecelia, for, thiought he, Cecelia never loved me half so fondly as does Emily. Emily is so much more attractive, I know of more than one young gentleman who will envy me the possession of such a queenly prize. He then, from a moss rose-bush, plucked a bud, which he kissed and gave to Emily, who likewise pressed it to her lips, then placed it in her bosom. De Vere was far from being happy at this silent betrothal  and his heart asked him if he could sincerely love the young creature by his side with the same pure, constant affection he had felt for Cecelia. But selfishness triumphed over truth, and Emily became more necessary for his gratification than truth for, his morality; and ere he reached the residence of Mr. Lee, he had whispered vows of eternal love and constancy into her willing ear. They both thought it best to conceal their engagement for the present, and for a few months De Vere continued to address Cecelia with all his former tenderness. But during the winter he did not address to her a single line. He was too much occupied with Emily and dissipation to give her more than a passing thought. Cecelia became so used to his neglect and so fond of home and her parents, to whom she gave all her thoughts, that it was a relief, rather than trouble to her, when released from the disagreeable duty of penning letters to him. The winter snows had disappeared, and the warm breath of spring had melted the last icicle from the recesses of the forest, when Cecelia, tempted by the beauty of the day, strolled through the fields and forests, or reclined against the trunk of some fallen tree plucking, the blue, white or purple anemone, or listening to the song of the robin, perched upon the top of a lofty tree. As  she gazed upon the early blossoms, the harbingers of  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7463-00000174"/> 336       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE spring, her thoughts wandered to her engagement with )e Vere. "Where shall I be at this time another year?" she solilo- quized : "The mistress of a lofty mansion, and the wife of a man I can never love; but I will learn to love De Vere ; I will become to him what he says he so much needs, his guardian spirit. I will win him from his wicked companions, and make him worthy to take his place among the wise and gifted of our land. I will devote all my leisure moments to his improvement, and in such a manner, too, that he shall never know the good seed that has dropped into his heart. Yes-De Vere shall yet be noble, learned and wise ; for I will never weary in my labor of duty to him. Rising from the seat, she gathered a few more of the delicate blossoms, and retraced her steps to the house, where her father handed her a letter which she knew from the writing was from De Vere, and she took the epistle to her room for perusal. Breahing the seal, she read thus : "DEAR AND RESPECTED CECELIA:  "Permit me once more to address you by that loved title. Alas I I find I have awoke on my wedding morn to a conscious- ness of the truth, and would still claim a portion of your pity -of your pure spirit's regard. .Do not mourn-do not despise me, when I inform you that I have broken my vows-those vows which would have saved me from ruin, and from myself.

"Like the rainbow's golden ray, That's only seen to pass away, So our grief on earth is given, Only as a guide to heaven." CECELIA clasped her hands in silent agony and shame, while the letter fell unheeded to the floor. "What would papa say  -what would mamma think," and the tears rolled fast down- her cheek, and rested upon her folded hands. Meanwhile Mr. and Mrs. Grey, who had been apprised by Mrs. Lee of De Vere's falseness, listened for Cecelia in the sit- ting-room below. "Oh, Arthur!" exclaimed Mrs. Grey, " how can we com- fort our child, who I fear will be almost broken hearted? May God, in his mercy, give her strength to despise the false-hearted villain." "Alice!" interrupted Mr. Grey, "Cecelia is far better situ- ated as the object of De Vere's broken vows than as his wife. He has shown his unworthiness, and I can only rejoice that Cecelia is beyond his reach. "But Arthur!" resumed Mrs. Grey, " if he should be the   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.        339 means of injuring our child-if Cecelia loves him, only think how she must suffer." "Cecelia is of a very sensitive disposition," replied Mr. Grey, "and she will doubtless suffer from mortification at the slight he has put upon her. But Cecelia is of too noble a mind to do aught but despise the author of her annoyance." - Cecelia, after a few moments' reflection, bowed her head upon her clasped hands, saying : "I thank thee, merciful Father, that thou hast not permitted false vows to bind my life with De Vere's. I thank thee, that thou hast saved me from a union with one whom I am now convinced I could never learn to respect. My shame is a just recompense for so long living a falsehood by my actions, encouraging the belief that De Vere was dear to me; and I do thank thee, that my punishment is. so light, and so easy to be borne." Then bathing her eyes, and smoothing her hair, she picked the letter from the floor and descended the stairs. Walking immediately to the side of Mr. Grey, she placed the epistle in his hand and blushing, said: "Read that, papa ; you are not likely to lose your daughter ' so soon as you anticipated." "I am rejoiced to hear it," replied Mr. Grey, running his eye over the letter;!" can my Cecelia say as much?" "From my heart, papa 1" said Cecelia. "If I had married De Vere I would never have been happy.' "I think you have had a fortunate escape," observed Mrs. Grey, addressing Cecelia. "Ah, mamma!" replied Cecelia, "I knew   you would be glad to retain me, but was afraid papa would think De Vere's wealth a great loss for me." "You mistook   me, then, child;" replied Mr. Grey. "I would not have you marry a man of De Vere's principles-no I not for the wealth of Guinea.

Patrick interrupted the conversation by entering the apart- ment, and presenting a letter to Cecelia. "FromfCousin Edgar!" she exclaimed, eagerly tearing the envelope, and unfolding the carefully written paper. "Oh I papa-mamma I Mary and Edgar are so anxious to have me come and pass a few months with them in the South. If you will only think you can spare me, it will be such a piea- sant change.

With a happy face, and a bounding heart, Cecelia flew to her room to procure writing materials. For a week she worked busily with her needle to prepare for her journey. Mr. Grey ordered dresses from the city, which, coming to the knowledge of De Vere, piqued his vanity, and made him almost savage in his treatment of his young bride. "How can Cecelia be so selfish and careless," he soliloquized, "to enter immediately into the midst of gaiety, dress and happiness. - She never loved me," he sighed; "of that I am sure.

"Emily wished me to take her out this morning, but a drive with her seemed anything but agreeable. I wish I had complied, however, for it would have prevented the attention of that fop. Emily is beautiful, and I believe loves me; I will try to get along comfortably with her." *   *    * e  *   *    *e      .  Cecelia bade her mother good bye, as with a bounding heart she took a seat in the cars that were to convey her within a short distance of her cousin's home. As she sat by the open window, gazing upon the forests, lakes, and villages, she forgot De Vere, her pride and resentment-all but the sweet, certain joy that nestled in her heart and told her to be happy. She  dreaded uttering no false vows, which her heart would not  sanction. Her soul was at peace with the restless accuser that had for months tormented her. And she resolved that she would never again promise her hand where her heart could not sanction and go with it. The succeeding morning she arrived at a small village, and was greeted immediately on leaving the cars by her cousin's voice. A moment more, and a pair of fine chestnut horses, driven by a mulatto, and. an elegant carriage bore her and  Mary, with Edgar Lee, to their elegant abode. Mr. and Mrs. de Manuel welcomed her .kindly as their daughter's guest, while Mary gathered her a bouquet of the  sweetest flowers. "I will give you a surprise to-day 1" exclaimed Mary, as Cecelia came down-stairs the first Sabbath morning she passed with them. "Really 1" replied Cecelia; "I can hardly expect anything   VIOISSTrUDES OF FORTUNE.       343 unusual here of interest to me, beyond the boundaries of your beautiful home."

You must not make your young  friend believe the Southerners are less attentive in religious  attendance, than her people at home."  "Cecelia is not the one to think any such thing," replied Mary; "you so often take a seat with others of your acquaint-   ji ance, that I could not be expected to associate your pew with yourself, papa."  "True, child," Mr. de Manuel replied, kindly smoothing her dark, soft hair. "Did you ever see a happier home?" inquired Mary of Cecelia, as they entered the dressing-room together. "If there were fewer dark faces around, I would like your home better," replied Cecelia ; "all else is beautiful." "You must take the evil with the good," said Mary; "yet the blacks are not a little addition to our comfort, as you would find if you were to make your home amongst us. You will like their looks better when you become more used to seeing them."  "Oh I there is nothing in their looks so very disagreeable as in their manners," responded Cecelia; "their noise and ges- tures annoy me. I was thinking this morning that you were possessed of a greater stock of patience or stronger nerves than I was blessed with, to bear with such a clatter."  Cecelia threw a light crape shawl around her, and tpok from Mary the large palm fan she recommended. As they entered the church, Cecelia was absorbed in listen- ing to the music of the organ, which was touched with no unskillful hand.

At the first sound of the well-known voice, Cecelia started from her reclining position; with staring eyes and half raising from the cushion, she looked into the face of Charles Nelford. Charles Nelford-the unknown--my preserver-one and the same," she half whispered, drooping her head again to its for. mer position, as much to hide her emotion as to join the petition his heart sanctioned. For some time her head bowed unable to repress the tears which filled her eyes. At last, having resumed a calm, unconcerned expression, she raised her eyes again to the sacred desk. Nelford at the same moment caught sight of the upturned face of Cecelia. For an instant his voice wavered, and a slight paleness came over his cheek; but he resumed his sermon with the usual solemn earnestness. The services were through, and the congregation dismissed, when a well known voice addressed Cecelia.  "Cecelia!" exclaimed Alpha Nelford; "shall I address you as a bride, and offer you my congratulations; or as the dear friend of former times?" "If you remain the same," replied Cecelia, "you will find me in friendship unchanged. I am still Cecelia Grey, and have not the remotest idea of ever becoming aught else." "Then you are not engaged to Isaac de Vere!" exclaimed Alpha. "I heard he was married, and supposed you were his bride." "You were mistaken," replied Cecelia; "A Emily Lee is Mrs. de Vere at the present time."                i The truth instantly flashed across the mind of Alpha, and anxious to know if Cecelia still loved him, she said, "Forgive me the inquiry, Cecelia, and answer me truly. Did you ever- or do you now love De Vere?" "Gratitude. compelled me to try to love him," candidly replied Cecelia; "but I detest him now that his falsehood is   VICISSITUDES QF FORTUNE.       345  unveiled.

"Oh!" stammered Cecelia, "you must excuse me. If it were your father's house, I would go with you, with the sincerest of pleasure. Accompany me with Nlary to her home." "Mrs. Lee," said Alpha, "I wish you to dine with us this afternoon. You will not deny me when I tell you I have so much to say to this timorous creature, that I don't know how to wait till the morrow, and she fears to intrude into a pastor's humble home. Now, if you comply with this arrangement, she cannot escape."           '  "With the greatest pleasure I accept your kind invitation," replied Mary Lee; "and in return I shall expect you a daily visitor'at our plantation." Edgar invited the minister to a seat in the carriage ; present- ing him to Cecelia's acquaintance. The formal salutation was extremely awkward on both sides, Cecelia blushing violently while Nelford stammered his compliment, in a very confused  and unministerial manner. Edgar, in his surprise, concluded it  15* " 'I  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7463-00000179"/> 346       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE must have been some error of his own that discomposed the unusually self-possessed vicar. The afternoon passed quickly to the occupied Cecelia, who scarcely joined the conversation. Nelford was at first diffident and watched Cecelia; while Cecelia,. in turn, listened to catch  every tone of the firm, manly voice that commanded without' enforcing the attention of his hearers. Alpha urged Cecelia to stay over night with her. This Cecelia declined, but promised to pass a week with them ere she returned North.         . Alpha expressed a wish to ride over to the De Manuels' with K Cecelia, and Charles Nelford gladly ordered his carriage and invited Cecelia to a seat with them. Cecelia conversed more freely when free from the company of the De Manuels; and her conversation was doubly pleasing. to Nelford from her previous silence, which he had been unable i to interpret. Her education would preclude the possibility of bashfulness, or he would most probably have thought that timidity bound her tongue.  *   -*        *   e    *   eI .  That night Cecelia scarcely closed her eyes in sleep, and early the next morning Mary rapped at the door saying: "May I come in?" "Certainly," responded Cecelia. Mary was startled at the great change in Cecelia's appear- ance. Her eyes were swollen and red, her cheeks pale, and upon Mary's inquiring if she were ill, Cecelia pleaded a severe headache, and not without reason. Mary left her after making her as comfortable as possible, thinking De Vere had robbed the light from Cecelials eye, and the joy from her heart. "I will never pity Emily," she exclaimed, " let her trouble be what it may-to break the engagement of those young people thus. She might well know that if Cecelia loved, she would love with all the strength of a noble mind. I only wonder how    VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.        347  De Vere could ever win her affections-that is, if he is such an  unprincipled rascal as Edgar describes him to be." Cecelia lay   ! half in slumber, half in tears, when she was again startled by a  rap upon the door. She arose hastily, and a servant advanced  and presented her a vase of flowers, with Charles Nelford's     ; compliments.                             ; With a low cry of joy, Cecelia buried her face among the roses, magnolias, and orange blossoms.               ' "Will you come down?" the servant inquired, still waiting.  "Mr. Nelford is in the parlor."  "In a moment," replied Cecelia, glancing in the mirror at  her disordered hair.  Cecelia soon made her appearance in the parlor, still some-    ; what pale; but with a happy smile playing upon her lips, and     I joy light dancing in her eyes.                .  Nelford arose as she entered the room, and seated himself by   I her side. They conversed a long time in a lively and animated  way, when Nelford, glancing at the clock, requested Cecelia to favor them with her company on the morrow. ' Cecelia acquiesced;' and he promised to come for her the ensuing day. After conversing a moment with Mrs. Lee, he b bade the ladies good morning and left the parlor, Mrs. de Manuel had been out visiting, and returned just as  Nelford drove, from the door.  Entering the parlor, she exclaimed: "What in the world is the trouble with our pas-  I tor, -Mary? I never knew him to make a morning call before l" "You must ask Cecelia," smilingly replied Mary. Cecelia said she could not give her any information on the subject. The ensuing morning, Cecelia dressed and entered the parlor before any of the family. Mary guessed her engagement had  something to do with her appearance at so early an hour ; and Edgar hoped his cousin would never think of marrying Charles Nelford and crossing the seas to teach little infidels their catechism. After the breakfast table was cleared away, Cecelia took a 'I  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7463-00000180"/> 348        CEOITTA GRBEY; OR, THE seat by the window to watch the arrival of Nelford. She had not long to wait ere she saw him coming through the long avenue of trees and flowers, towards the house. She hastened up-stairs and put her shawl around her, shook hands with Mary and Mrs. de Manuel and tripped lightly down-stairs to- the parlor; where Nelford awaited her. Charles Nelford led her to the carriage, and handing her in, sprung to a seat by her side and drove away. IAt first they spoke of home and its many sources of enjoyment. Then Nel. ford informed Cecelia of his call to a foreign land; and of his duties as a servant of Christ to preach the Gospel whenever or wherever a path should be marked out for him. They were riding slowly through a dense forest of lofty trees, and pointing to them, he exclaimed: "Cecelia, shall I go alone; or will the tender vine cling to me as to tiem for support, looking alone to our Creator for sustenance and for life? Will you, Cecelia, accept of the love of one whose first, purest, and holiest affections. are given to the Most High?  If you can return such love-if you can leave home, friends, and your native land, to share my uncer- tain destiny, then will the wilderness become a blessed abode, and the dwellings of strangers my home.   Yes I Cecelia; home I and I shall not weep for the land of my earliest memory and for -the hopes of my earliest years. For the light of my earthly happiness will be with me. Say, Cecelia, can you return a love-like mine?" Cecelia bowed her head, and the tears fell fast upon her clasped hands, as she murmured : "Yes I Charles Nelford ; I can give you my whole heart's affections, and say I love you better for following the dictates of conscience, governed and ruled by our Redeemer. Such love as yours, is worth a million of the false, deceitful throng's. Oh, Charles I you know not how long you have been in pos- session of all the impulses of my heart. All the highest, noblest sentiments of my mind were brought into action by you."   :A'V ' VICISSITUDES OF FORETUE.,      349 Charles Nelford led Cecelia into the parlor of his humble dwelling, with a calm look of pure joy and pride.

Charles laughed, and replied that he had reason to be happy and proud' of the charming companion he had brought to enli- ven the dull hours at the parsonage. Alpha was delighted with the prospect of having Cecelia for a sister, and winding her arms about her neck, said she should "Iove her very much-very much indeed!" For a week, Cecelia wandered with Alpha and Charles Nel- ford among the myrtles and orange groves.

CECELIA passed the day of her arrival in writing letters; for Alpha, after passing an hour at their residence, pursued her journey home. After the evening meal was cleared away and Mr. and Mrs. Grey had taken seats in the sitting-room, Cecelia drew a chair between them, and taking a hand of each, while a deep blush suffused her cheek, she remarked: "You have been disappointed once in losing your Cecelia; do you think parting with her now would be hard?" "Yes Hyes 1" exclaimed Mrs. Grey ; "I was in hopes that my only child would be contented to remain with us, when she would never be- liable to meet with unexpected sorrows or the bitter trials an intercourse with the world will be sure to bring." "Stop I Alice," interrupted Mr. Grey; " would you recom- mend to Cecelia a life of indolence and selfishness-? Rather tell her to go forth into the world and battle with its imper- fections and gain strength from its weaknesses. Not shrinking from its trials or life burdens, but bearing them firmly." Cecelia drew a letter from her pocket which Charles Nelford had addressed to her parents, and placed it in her father's hands ; then bade them good night. Mr. Grey was agitated when he looked upon the neatly folded epistle. "What a fool I have been!" he exclaimed,   VICISSITUDES OP FORTUNE.       351      't (" Alice, you were more wise than I. But dry your tears and lis- ten to the reading of this letter, which is addressed to both you and me." Mrs. Grey nodded her acquiescence, an'd he proceeded: "  To MR. AND MRS.

I can only promise to be kind, and to love her while life shall last-to lavish all the wealth of my earthly affections upon her. "That she returns my affections, you were most probably aware, ere she placed this epistle in your hands. I cannot pro- mise her a magnificent home, or a life of ease or enjoyment.

Mrs. Grey looked up with her face beaming with piety and calm pure joy, as she said : "If our Master calls her to assist in His work, it is well. I rejoice that Cecelia is not to be the wife of a false, deceitful, wicked man like De Vere. If she leaves us, it will be to win a crown of glory.

If you consent, my blessing and approval shall both go with them." Mr. Grey started from his chair and rapidly paced the apart- ment, until its narrow boundaries seemed too small for him. Seizing his hat, he hastened from the house out- into the air. On--on he walked, until the low murmur of deep water met his ear. Hastening to the stream, he sunk upon the bank, and uncovering his head, he bathed his aching brow in the cool water, and brushed back the damp, tangled locks from his tem- ple, while the moonbeams played as if in mockery with his misery, throwing a shadow here and a silver star there, upon the rolling water at his feet. "I will fly away to the dark forest, where you cannot pene- trate," he exclaimed, casting an angry look at the soft light around him. At that moment, dark clouds gathered over the face of the sky, and he was involved in impenetrable darkness. Springing to his feet, he started to retrace his steps homeward, repenting of his rash words. He had taken but a few steps, when his feet caught in the long, coarse, tangled grass, and he was precipitated into the water. Being an expert swimmer, he managed to keep above water, but owing to the darkness, was unable to get upon land. " Oh I for one--but one single ray of that light I so much despised i" he cried in agony and weariness. At that moment the clouds separated and a flood -of silver light poured down upon hill and valley, river, forest and grove. Mr. Grey saw the root of a tree, swayed to and fro by the water. Seizing it, he pulled-himself up the bank, and clinging to some low bushes,  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7463-00000183"/> 354       OECELIA GREY; OR, THE         / was soon safe upon dry land.   Hastening homeward, be exclaimed: "Yes I God is everywhere, and Cecelia will be as safe in his protecting care even in the midst of savages as under her father's roof. He has shown me my weakness, and I will not oppose their union."                  On entering his apartments, he found Mrs. Grey in a tranquil sleep, instead of indulging in useless tears and regrets, in which he had expected that she would pass the night. Changing his wet garments, Mr. Grey resolved to follow her example, and bear firmly the dispensations of Providence, trust. ing in the divine wisdom, that " all is for the best." Cecelia almost repented her promise to Charles Nelford, when she saw the sorrow her leaving her parents was likely to occasion. "Alas " she sighed; "if my leaving home occa. l sions my mother such keen anguish, what will my   leaving America occasion?  Oh  Charles, this is a sacrifice indeedl Were it not for my parents, and I an only child, I would go to the ends of the earth with him.  But I cannot endure the silent breaking of my mother's heart. That is too much--too much.   If my mother does not freely consent, I cannot go with him." The ensuing morning Cecelia arose from  a sleepless pillow, pale and nervous. After dressing herself, she slowly descended the stairs to the dining-room. She heard her mother busy in the kitchen, and setting out the breakfast table and laying the cloth, she stole softly to her mother's side, saying * "What shall I   do for you now, mamma? I  have set the breakfast table." "You may call your father," replied Mrs. Grey, " and come to breakfast." At the breakfast table Mr. Grey remarked, with a trembling voice:  "Since you have resolved to leave, my child, you must have a bridal dress and other little arrangements. I cannot refuse a union which promises peace and true happiness between you,   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       355 sanctioned by piety and good deeds. Your mother and myself will not disapprove your choice, but resign you to the protec- tion of your Redeemer and your husband." Cecelia thanked her father by looks rather than words, while she reclined her head in her mother's arms. Mrs. Grey first obtained composure. "My child," she exclaimed, " it is painful for us to part with you thus. But we think it is for your happiness ; if not for this life, for the life to come. I would rather see you the wife of a poor but truly pious man, than of a wicked millionaire. It is not this life alone to which I look, but the life to come. You have chosen for this world, and may divine protection be with you, and shield you from suffering." Cecelia expressed her thanks for the kindness of her parents in so readily yielding their wishes to her. After breakfasting, Mr. Grey requested Cecelia to put on her bonnet, and accompany him to the village, where they would purchase goods to prepare for her bridal and departure to a distant country. Cecelia returned with the goods, and meanwhile Mrs. Grey secured the assistance of a dress-maker to make up the mate- rials. For the ensuing six weeks Cecelia worked almost con- stantly. :   *    *    *   *    *   , * The evening upon which Cecelia expected Nelford, he arrived.

It was long after midnight when the last light disappeared,   ! and much longer ere Mrs. Grey closed her eyes in sleep.

Breakfast over, the guests began to arrive, ahnd Cecelia with Ada retired to the dressing room, to arrange their attire for the marriage cere- mony.  Cecelia had intended to wear a dress of simple white muslin, with orange blossoms. But her aunt had purchased her a bridal dress, and to please them she consented to be arrayed in it. The dress was of white figured brocade silk, glistening with stars, while a veil, attached to a tiara of stars and orange blos. soms, flowed over her shoulders down to her feet. "You look like a queen l" exclaimed Ada, surveying her from a distance. "I exhausted my invention in arranging that beautiful costume for you." "Thank you, Ada," replied Cecelia; "methinks I look little as the wife of a minister of the Gospel would be expected to appear." "Oh I you just wait until you are a wife before you become so prim and precise," exclaimed Ada, laughing. A rap at the door interrupted their merriment, and -Alpha Nelford entered the room. "My brother awaits you," said Alpha, curiously surveying the dress of Cecelia and her bridesmaid. Nelford stood looking from the window of an adjoining apartment, when Alpha returned with Cecelia and Ada. With a start of surprise, Nelford looked upon Cecelia, then cast his eyes over his own plain attire. "Never mind," said Elison; leading Nelford towards Cece- Iia; "that is not the. taste of Cecelia, but my little wife at ranged it-dress, tiara and all. Don't she look majestic?" She looks superbly beautiful," replied Nelford. "Cecelia I am robbing society of one of its most captivating beauties." Society can do without me!" replied Cecelia. "Therp are fair faces and fine forms enough within its limits." "True 1" exclaimed Nelford ; "more of those than of fine   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       357 sentiments or fair truthfulness." Thus saying, Nelford with Cecelia, preceded by Elison and Ada, descended the stairs and took their places in the parlor, when the clergyman immedi- ately commenced the marriage ceremony. Mr. and Mrs. Nelford surveyed with some surprise and not a little chagrin the dress of the bride-so far superior to Nel- ford's or Alpha's. The judge was angry with his children for not appearing as well as the bride; and their congratulations were reserved and haughty. Cecelia was at a loss to under- stand this; while Charles sought his mother's face to, learn the occasion of this coldness.  A glance at Cecelia's dress, another at his and Alpha's, was    ! his reply. Instantly divining the cause, his cheek burned for a    l moment with shame and anger. But it was for an instant  only. Turning to Alpha, he whispered her to inform their parents of the change of arrangements to please the friends of Cecelia. Nelford was happy a moment after, to see his father, smiling, draw his wife from the circle which surrounded them, and place her between Cecelia and himself; seeming to make  amends for his incivility by unexpected attention and kindness.  -!

LEE was very anxious for Mr. and Mrs. Grey, with the bride and groom, to return to the city with them. Ada sec- onded the wish, saying she was not prepared, to hear any ex- cuse ; and Elison begged the privilege of a friend to urge the cause upon Nelford.  Mr. Grey acquiesced after Nelford had left it to him to decide, and it was arranged that they should leave Greenwood at an early hour the ensuing day s The judge informed them that he should expect them at his house immediately after their return ; and bade them adieu, leaving Alpha, who had complied with Ada's urgent solicita- tions to accompany them. Immediately after their arrival at the residence of Mr. Lee, Mrs. Lee issued cards for a party in honor of the bride. Dar- ing the day, Emily returned to the city from a pleasure tour with her husband; and learning of the return of her parents, she drove around for an afternoon call. Cecelia sat by the open window when a carriage, drawn by "War Eagle," and driven by a servant, stopped before the door. A smile-more of pity than derision-crossed the lips of Cecelia as the richly attired mistress of the elegant equip- age stepped from the carriage and ascended the marble steps of the mansion. Haughtily Emily brushed the rich lace from her face, as she passed though the hall, and as the servant swung open the    VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE;.      359 door of the drawing-room, and announced Mrs. de Vere, Mrs Lee arose to receive her. Mrs. Grey spoke kindly, with her usual sweetness, to Emily, who stepped forward to congratulate the bride. Cecelia received and returned her good wishes, and with a smile of pure happiness presented Emily to her; husband. As the noble, commanding expression of Nelford met her, seeming to read the inmost thought of the soul, her eye for an instant fell before the earnest gaze. Nelford had been watching Cecelia, to note if the splendor of Emily had any effect upon her ; and was delighted at the unaffected ease and happiness with which she received her. Emily was annoyed at -finding herself a person of no greater importance as "Mrs. de Vere" than when bearing the less dis- tinguished title of "Emily Lee." She obtained a promise from Mrs. Grey and Charles Nelford to visit her soon, and then entered her carriage and drove home, where we will fol- low her. Stepping from her carriage with a heart-sick look, she has- tened to her apartment, longing for one look of the tenderness Nelford gave his bride. After passing an hour in tears, she bathed her face and summoned her dressing-maid. As soon ag the servant appeared, she inquired if De Vere was at home. "Yes, ma'm," replied the girl ; "I saw him enter the library not ten minutes since." "Hasten and arrange my hair," resumed Emily; "and bring me a light, becoming evening dress. Do you hear?" she inquired petulantly as the girl turned over the loose leaves of her magazine. The servant slowly drew the combs from her hair, and un- braided the glossy bands, while Emily reclined her head and gave herself up to thought. After the maid had finished her task, Emily arose and, stepping to the mirror, surveyed herself with an unsatisfied look. -  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7463-00000186"/> 360       CERCELA GREY; OR, THE  "How clumsy you have made me look 1" she exclaimed, turning to her maid. "Well," exclaimed the girl, 4' if you are not satisfied, you can get some one that will suit you better." "Very well," said Emily, 1" you can go." "Yes, ma'm," returned the girl; " when you have given me my wages." Emily drew her purse from her pocket, and counted her the money, exclaiming angrily: "Begone, you insulting hussy 1" The girl gave her a mocking smile as she closed the door, and said :  "A hearty good bye to you, Mistress de Vere." Emily summoned her footman and bade him engage the ser. vices of a French girl, for 'a waiting-maid. "One that is ac- quainted with the business," she added, as the man turned away to do her bidding. After the man had disappeared, she refixed her hair and descended to the parlor. Taking her embroidery, with a look of studied sedateness, she waited for the appearance of her husband.  De Vere came in in his usual careless, indifferent manner, with a cigar in his mouth and a dog at his- heels. Turning over a footstool, he used it for a spittoon, evidently bent upon a quarrel with his young wife, who detested smoke in her par- lor, or spit upon the carpets. To his astonishment, Emily remained perfectly silent; and in answer to his inquiry, "What are you snivelling about? Out of money, I suppose," two large tears followed each other down her cheeks. De Vere turned uneasily in his chair. "Do you know," Emily ventured, "that Mrs. Nelford, formerly Cecelia Grey, is in the city?" "  No I nor do I care 1" replied De Vere. "I hope you do not expect me to make her a congratulatory call 1"   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      361 Emily arose haughtily, and was leaving the apartment, when De Vere interfered, closing the door, and putting the key in his pocket. Emily, half frightened, retreated, threw herself upon the sofa and burst into tears. "Stop your snivelling, now!" exclaimed De Vere, advancing, "and tell me what you know of their arrival." "I called to see mother this afternoon,. replied Emily, " and found Uncle Grey, the bride and groom there." "How did they appear?" resumed De Vere. "Nelford seemed very much attached to Cecelia," replied Emily. "As for Cecelia, to use her own language, she is content to shine in her husband's heart." "Ah I she is!" exclaimed De Vere. "And whose heart are you content to shine in, eh? Answer that, Miss Lee." "If I might be content to dwell in my husband's heart," replied Emily, "I fear I would find no room for me there." "Right, by Jove l" laughed De Vere. "If you will remain in your husband's house I will be contented." So saying he unfastened the door, and strode away from the room.    ; Emily buried her face in the pillow of the sofa for a moment, weeping bitterly. Then, with a haughty gesture and a mock- ing laugh, arose. Stepping to a side-table, she took a novel from it, and carelessly threw herself into a rocking-chair. For some time she fixed her eyes upon the page before her, but her  thoughts were too painful to be thus trifled wish, and the tears again overflowed her eyes.                    i "I have mistaken happiness," she murmured, "for ease and   i wealth.

As it is, he deals out my pocket-money more scantily at each application. I will not be thus curtailed-; I will draw upon his banker myself whenever I desire, and let him rave if he chooses. I will shut myself in my apartment till the storm is over." The footman now presented himself, and bowing humbly, said, "I have brought you a maid very highly recommended. Will you see her?" "Show her the room occupied by my former maid," Emily replied severely. The man obeyed, murmuring, "I'll take leave of my pretty mistress also, as soon as I can secure a better place. All this authority is unendurable in a free country. I am willing to obey orders for my wages, but not to become a cringing slave." De Vere, after leaving the splendid mansion he occupied, strolled carelessly down the street till he came to a large saloon, or gaming-house, which he entered, and sauntering leisurely along, took a vacant seat at a table where three were already seated. "Welcome, De Vere i" exclaimed one of the gamblers; " you will be my partner?" "Will I?" replied De Vere, rubbing his hands-" that I will. What amount do you stake?" "One hundred," said one of his opponents, and he laid the money upon the table. "Agreed," cried the others, covering the amount with bank notes. "Here, waiter," cried De Vere, "bring on the champagne." "We will not drink till the game is out," said one, shuffling the cards and passing them to De Vere, who cut, and returned them to the other, who dealt them.

At last, a cloud of blackness covered his brow ; a little later, and " won," cried one of his opponents, seizing the pile and thrusting it into his pocket. De Vere started to his feet, and throwing five hundred more upon the table, cried in a voice of rage : "Cover that ; who dare." His opponents, in the excitement, immediately covered the amount, and in a short time again drew the pile from the table. '"You have used deception 1" cried De Vere. "Never mind, gentlemen, we meet again on the morrow." Thus saying, he left the hall, leaving the champagne stand- ing untouched. Hastening home, he entered his apartments, where for some time he remained alone, absorbed in thought. At last he slowly drew from his pocket his empty portemon- naie.   lI "This will never do," he soliloquized. "Twenty-two thou- sand lost in six months and not one farthing realized from all my loss and gain." Then writing a check, he summoned a servant, and bade him draw the money upon it, and return to him. The man bowed and retired. Then De Vere's thought returned to his wife; and not hav- ing tasted the excitement of the wine cup, he pitied her for his cruel conduct to her so lately his bride. Then he thought of Cecelia, and resolved that his wife should have no reason to complain of neglect while she remained in the city. He would purchase the most costly jewels for her, and the richest attire. While thus soliloquizing, his faithful servant returned, and counted ten thousand dollars into his hand. "That will do," he said, as the man left the apartment. De Vere might have been seen shortly after, entering a jewelry store. From thence he proceeded to a fashionable mer- cantile'establishment ; thence home. Entering the parlor, he laid the articles of his purchase before his wife.  &#xD;<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7463-00000188"/> 364       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE Emily surveyed the rich cloths and diamonds with extreme delight. "Dress so that I will not be ashamed of you," said De Vere, and he left the room for his private apartments. At the table he was unusually condescending and kind ; and after the table was removed, he followed his wife from the dining-room and took a seat by her side. "Won't you read me something i" he inquired, as she was about to take her embroidery. Emily smiled, and De Vere chose a book from the centre table. Emily opened it and read for some time, while De Vere listened attentively. "What do you think of this sentiment?"Emily inquired, reading from the book : " 'If folly should become fashion, how soon would the world be proud of its display,"' "All fashion folly is," replied De Vere, "I can see no sense in the illustration." "Some men, like. books, are hard to understand," sarcastic- ally replied Emily. "Some women, like fools, can be made understand," said De Vere, grinding his teeth with anger ; while Emily, putting on her dignity, put down the book, gathered the jewels and costly fabrics in her arms and swung from the room. "Fool-fool 1" muttered De Vere, seizing his hat and leaving the house. *   *    8   8   es   e   *  After Emily left the mansion of the Lees, Mr. Elison pro- posed making Alice a call at her humble residence. Ada and Cecelia put on their hats and shawls, and descended the marble steps of the mansion, and walked to the home of Alice. They found Mrs. Harwood and Nella, now Mrs. MAarkland, occupying the little sitting-room. Alice, with a happy smile, congratulated Cecelia, and welcomed her companions. Then went to bring her husband and her boy from the adjoining apartment.   VICISSITUDES OF, FORTUNE.       365 Ralph Harwood came in with his boy in his arms, his fine, intellectual face beaming with happiness. He politely accosted Elison and Ada, and warmly congratulated Cecelia and Nelford. "Sir, I can assure you that you have secured a, treasure- whose true value you will never learn, although each day shall reveal to you its increasing value, till death shall separate you; and may Heaven grant that that time may be far distant, and a long life of happiness be vouchsafed to you." The tears were in Cecelia's eyes when Nelford's again sought hers. Soon after, the husband of Nella came in, and they  passed a happy evening together. At leave-taking, as Nelford grasped the hand of his host, he exclaimed:                             l "You will favor us with your presence to-morrow, Mr. Har- wood, at the residence of Mr. de Vere?" "Thank you," returned Mr. Harwood, slightly coloring ; "my presence would be considered an intrusion at their princely mansion.  Indeed I Mrs. de Vere has condescended to invite Alice to call at unfashionable hours, which Alice, in her con- descension, has done some few times. Alice must consult her own inclinations in regard to this matter ;" and the husband sought the face of his wife with a look of the fondest considera- tion and manly pride. Alice smiled, and replied, "We will visit together on the     i forenoon of the morrow; and as you do not leave the city at present, we will pass many an  agreeable evening together  beneath this humble roof, I trust." "Certainly," said Cecelia, "I shall visit you again." On the way home, Elison and Nelford eulogized the accom- plished mechanic and his happy wife. "He will be elected a member of the Legislature this fall," said Elison. "Ralph Harwood will yet be one of our wealthiest and most influential citizens.

The building is paid for, and the whole establishment his own." They now arrived at the residence of Mr. Lee, and entered the parlor of that mansion. Ada soon after retired, which example they all followed, with the exception of Mrs. Lee, who passed an hour more in preparing, and giving orders for the approaching party. The ensuing day they were "delighted with the presence of Alice and her husband at the breakfast table; Mr. Lee having gone for them in his carriage at an early hour. The forenoon passed quickly to the happy party, and after dining, Mr. Lee conveyed Alice to her home, and on his return, the bridal party drove to the mansion of Mr. de Vere. As the carriage stopped before the marble steps of the costly dwelling, the door opened, and a servant, preceding the owner of the princely mansion, descended the steps. With the most stoical indifference, De Vere assisted Cecelia from the carriage, and led her into the hall, where Emily haughtily received them. No happy smile flitted across her lips, no happy glance from her husband fell upon her, as he said : "Do not exert yourself so much, my dear, I will ring for the servant." "It is a pleasure, not a task, to assist my friends," replied Emily, with the icy chill of condescension upon her lips. Nelford, with his usual ease and calm decision, surveyed the young couple. This annoyed, while it threw De Vere into a rage, which he artfully concealed beneath a cloak of smiles and affected regard. To Emily he paid the most marked attention, consulting her wishes in all things. The afternoon dragged slowly away, and they all felt a relief when they again entered the carriage to return home. At an early hour that evening, Emily made her appearance, leaning upon her husband's arm, and dressed in bridal attire. No one in the crowded rooms of the wealthy merchant could boast such elaborate jewels, costly garments, or queenly   VICISSITUDES OF FORTU'UNE.      367 beauty as the wife of Isaac de Vere. No one was followed with such careful attention and fond regard by their husbands, as was she ; and many remarked as they rode to their homes, "How devoted De Vere is to his stately bride.' The ensuing day, Cecelia visited her early friend, Mrs. Ernot. They passed a happy day, and agreed to meet again on the morrow at the house of Ralph Harwood. This engagement they kept in uninterrupted enjoyment, and the succeeding day Mr. and Mrs. Grey, with Nelford, Cecelia and Alpha, returned to Greenwood.

ONE fine evening, a few days after their return from Green- wood, the judge arrived at the residence of Mr. Grey; intend- ing to remain over night, and the succeeding morning return to Nelford Hall, with his children. At Nelford Hall, all were busy making preparations for the departure of Charles and his young bride. Mrs. Nelford wept while her busy fingers assisted the seam- stress in her hurried task. At last, Charles received his orders. He was to take passage in a trading ship, bound for an island on the Indian Ocean; and was to be landed at Aden, in the kingdom of Yeman, and proceed by land to Lohein. Mrs. Nelford heard the final arrangement with a calm deter- mination to hide her grief, and encourage the weeping Alpha that her brother would return again to his native land. Yet hope died in her heart when she thought of the great distance which would separate them, and the cruel disposition of the race among whom he was to take up his abode. The week passed swiftly awav, and Cecelia returned home to pass the few remaining days that intervened before her depar- ture. Alpha's health was poorer since her return from the South than it had been previously; and Cecelia grieved, for she feared they would not return to their native land to meet the tender look and welcoming smile of their sister. The morning of their departure came, and Charles, his   VICISSITUDES OF FOKR'UNE.       369 , parents and sister, with Cecelia, Mr. and Mrs. Grey, were      a seated in the carriages, which were to convey them to the city.   l Immediately upon their arrival, Mrs. Lee sent for Alice, Ada and Emily, to take leave of Cecelia, and witness her departure from their native land. They gathered silently at the mansion of Edgar Lee, with the exception of Emily, who sent her regrets-she had another appointment and must therefore defer the pleasure of meeting. her friends. This was no cause of sor- row to any of the party. Alice knew her unfeeling remarks would aggravate the pain of parting, and was pleased that Gl something had attracted her attention in another direction.    i; The friends of Charles Nelford and Cecelia accompanied them to the wharf, where the vessel was receiving her passen-  gers. Mr. Grey clasped Cecelia silently to his heart, while tears rolled down the cheeks of the strong man, and his voice was    i choked in the blessing he strove to speak. HE  gazed long and wildly upon her, and yielded her to the :arms of her mother. Mrs. Grey and Cecelia had no parting words; their sorrow was too deep to be communicated. Silently they gazed into each other's faces, silently received and gave the parting em- brace. Then Nelford drew his wife from her mother's arms, and led her along the plank to the vessel. Cecelia stood upon deck, and waved her hand as long as she could distinguish her friends upon the wharf. A steady breeze ensued,: all sails filled, and the ship made way, with a lofty and majestic air. As evening drew on, Nelford and Oecelia repaired to their state-room, where they remained for several days confined by sea-sickness. On the evening of the twelfth day, they were alarmed by the heavy rolling of the ship; and Nelford went     i upon deck to inquire if they were in danger.           ! The captain smiled and assured him there was no danger; the wind was steady to a point, and they did not ship a spoon- 15,  &#xD;<pb n="370 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7463-00000191"/> 370       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE ful of water. He calculated that they had plenty of sea-room, although they had changed their course for a few days, to keep away from a black, snakish-looking craft that had been pursu- ing them. "Not a pirate?" exclaimed Nelford, starting, and turning pale. "Can't say," replied the captain; "I have never allowed them to get near enough to take a close observation. I shall be glad if this storm drives them on another course." "Which I pray it may," fervently responded Nelford. The succeeding morning the weather became moderate ; and the crew were employed in shaking reefs out of the top-sails, getting up the top-gallant masts and yards, and rigging out studding-sails. The passengers were now called to dinner, after which Nel- ford prevailed upon Cecelia to go upon deck. They had just stepped upon the deck when a man at the cross-trees sung out: "Sail ho -sail ho!"- "Well, what do you make of her?" cried the mate. "A large schooner, sir I with a black hull bearing down upon our lee bow." The captain ordered them to crowd on all sail, and Nelford with Cecelia returned to their state-room. Who can picture the agony of Nelford as he gazed upon his young wife-her face bathed in tears. They could tell by the rushing of the water that the vessel had, changed her course and was running with great speed before the wind. Cecelia made no inquiries of her husband. She knew by the silent agony he expressed, that some fearful danger threatened them. Suddenly the captain entered the state-room, exclaim- ing: "It will soon be all over with us now. Shall we quietly yield ourselves to our fate, Nelford, or fight for our lives?" "You must decide," replied Nelford. "If your decision is   Edek a siprywtthblooftewuddadyngwente litl cew furofwomony emindweeov rpweed--va 81  &#xD;<pb n="-371" xml:id="VAC7463-00000192"/> I I   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       371 to fight, you will give me arms. How many men can be spared to defend the ship?" ( Twenty-if the passengers will fight for their lives," said the captain. Suddenly a loud report and a crash, like the terrific thunder, came simultaneously upon their ears. Then did the hands that had never wielded a sword seize the arms held out to them by the stalwart crew ; and with the cry of death or victory, sprung upon deck. Nelford just whispered, "Pray, Cecelia, while I fight. My soul shall plead with thine for our deliverance," and he followed them. He gave one look at the black flag of the corsair, whose grappling-irons were made fast to their vessel. With a fiendish yell the pirates sprung upon the deck of the little vessel-only to be repulsed by the handful of brave, stout- hearted men, who drove them back. The pirate chief-a man with long silvery beard, and three or four deep scars upon his cheek and brow-then sprung upon the deck, followed by the whole of his horrid crew. Now ensued a scene of bloodshed, seldom witnessed by the eye of man. Hand to hand, foot to foot, they dealt the death- blow, and drove the weapon to the heart. The deck was slip- pery with the blood of the wounded and dying, when the little crew, four of whom only remained, were overpowered. Nelford being driven near to the companion-way, dealt a death-blow to one of the fiends that endeavored to oppose his descent, sprung down the stairs and flew to the state-room where he had left Cecelia. Cecelia met him at the door, which they immediately closed, bolted, and barricaded. A moment more, and the pirates were heard hurrying -along the companion-way in search of plunder and victims on whom to satiate their cruelty and thirst for blood. The state-room adjoining the one occupied by Nelford, was  &#xD;<pb n="372" xml:id="VAC7463-00000193"/> 372       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE occupied by an aged French lady. "Mon Dieu I Mon Dieu 1" they heard her exclaim, as she was robbed of her jewels and dragged upon deck.  The door of the state-room in which they had fastened them- selves was often tried, and left with bitter curses. The pirate chief at last came to the door, and with heavy blows burst it open. There stood Nelford, the blood dripping from the sword he held in one hand, while the other hand clasped the trembling form of his young wife. The pirate chief sneeringly surveyed them, as no petition cheered his ear, no prayer solicited a favor from him. "Give me your weapons," he demanded, in a stern voice. "Ay weapons are to carve my way to the water," replied Nelford. "Do you give us free passage from this desecrated vessel, or some of you shall pay the penalty with your lives." "Bravo I' cried the pirate chief, and the fiendish desperadoes gathered around their captain. A- dozen pistols were raised and pointed at the heart of Nelford; when Cecelia, tearing herself from her husband's arms, threw herself at the feet of the corsair captain, crying: "Mercy I mercy for my husband!" A horrid grin distorted the -features of the vile crew, at her prayer. Not so with the chief. As his eyes fell upon her clasped hands, raised imploringly before him, he turned pale and staggered forward, exclaiming : "Where-where did you procure that ring?" Cecelia heeded not the inquiry, but continued crying for mercy. The captain suddenly regained his self-possession, and turn- ing to the blood-thirsty crew, bade them leave the state-room- he would question them alone. "A brave fellow!" cried one, as they turned away. ( It were well if he would become one of us." The chief closed the door upon the grinning fiends; and turning to Cecelia bade her rise, they had nothing to fear.

On -the true answer to the inquiries I am about make, depend both your lives." "What security have we in believing your promises?" firmly inquired Nelford. "My word of honor!" exclaimed the corsair captain. "Well,' returned Nelford, " what are your inquiries?" "Where," said the corsair, taking the hand of Cecelia, and pointing to a ring that had long been in her possession, " where did you obtain this ring?" "From my father, Arthur Grey," replied Cecelia, clinging closer to the side of her husband. The corsair became very much excited, and grasped the table for support. "Who did he obtain it from?" he hastily resumed. "It was his grandmother's," replied Cecelia " and a parting gift from a son, Charles Grey, who was lost at sea, and the brother of my grandfather." The corsair drew the ring from her finger, and inserting the point of a knife betweenthe jewel and the setting, he touched a secret spring. The jewel fell back, and revealed the minia- ture of an exquisitely beautiful female. Madly the pirate pressed the picture to his lips, and beat his forehead. When he became calm, he bade Nelford secure their baggage, and returned the ring to Cecelia, saying: "At some future time I will purchase the bauble of you." He called his men and bade them convey Nelford and Cecelia on board the schooner. Their baggage was conveyed after them, and the corsair captain then ordered his -men to scuttle the other vessel and sink her. Nelford reluctantly suffered  the wretches to hand them over the side of the vessel, and to the deck of the schooner. The corsair captain showed them a state-room, superbly fur-  &#xD;<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7463-00000195"/> 3T4       OECELIA GREY; OR, THE nished, adjoining his own. Cecelia sunk upon a sofa trembling, while Nelford envied his fellow passengers who had found a watery grave. The captain returned to them after a few hours, followed by a beautiful Spanish girl. "Here is your waiting-maid," he exclaimed, smilingly address- ing Cecelia. "Isabella, comfort the fair American," and turning he left the room. The fair Spaniard advanced to the side of Cecelia, and tak- ing her hand, bade her be reconciled to her situation; and informed her that the corsair captain had spared her life, and during the three months of her residence on the schooner had treated her well. Isabella then shook a tiny silver bell, and a black girl answered the summons. "Bring this lady and gentleman wine and   food," she ordered. The black girl disappeared, but soon returned, bearing a massive silver waiter, on which was placed substantial food with hot coffee and wine. After partaking of the refreshments, Nelford was summoned to appear on deck by the corsair chief. At first, Nelford firmly refused to comply, or to leave Cecelia for an instant; but upon the captain's allowing him to retain his weapons, and assuring him that they should receive no harm, or be separated any longer than was necessary to secure their safety, he complied with the demand. Nelford was received upon deck with a loud huzza ; and the captain proposed to spare their lives if he would join them. "Sooner," said Nelford, " than promise to join in your fiend- ish, unhallowed occupation--sooner would I tear out this tongue by the roots, or bear the most cruel tortures that your blood- thirsty hearts could invent!" "But your young wife," persuaded the corsair captain- "for her sake you should reasonably comply." - * ' *    VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      375 "Never!" replied Nelford ; "I yield her into the care of my Redeemer, after I have done all I can for her protection." "Ha 1 ha!" exclaimed one of the grinning demons, " hear him croak-; one would think him a parson by his jargon. Suppose we retain him a prisoner on condition of his consol- ing our poor wives at home, who are forever pining for the ser- vices of the Sabbath." "Well said I I acquiesce," replied the captain. "What has been your occupation, young man," continued the chief. "My occupation," replied Nelford, " as that poor wretch insinuated, has been to preach the Gospel." "An extraordinary preacher," interrupted one; "fighting when you should have been praying." "I am commanded to preserve my own life, and the lives of others," replied Nelford. "I could fight and pray at the same time, as some of you perhaps understand." At this bold speech some cursed and others applauded. Meanwhile, the captain ordered Nelford to return to the state- room. Had Nelford supposed for an instant that they were spared for other than a cruel death, he would have been less defiant in his remarks. His hand had driven the death-blow to the hearts of many of the vile crew, and he naturally supposed that they-were spared to endure unheard of miseries. But he was determined to sell his life as dearly as possible. : He placed a brace of loaded pistols in the hands of Cecelia, with directions how to discharge them. Then told her if they approached them in hostility, to follow him into the water, and send a ball through the head of any that endeavored to intercept her in her flight. The captain soon after came in and informed them that they had concluded to spare their lives, on condition that Nelford would become their minister Upon the island.

"We will arrive there in two or three days at most," replied the captain. Then addressing Cecelia, he continued: "Isabelle, the Spanish maiden, will continue to be your waiting-maid. You must call upon her for whatever you may need during your stay here. After we have landed, you shall be accommodated in my own house. Meanwhile, when an oppor. tunity offers, I will make you acquainted with the history of the pirate chief. The succeeding day the corsair captain again entered the state- room of Nelford and Cecelia, who returned his warm greet- ing with a constraint and coldness very easily to be understood. "I have come to redeem my promise," said the corsair, re- moving his cap and seating himself upon the sofa. Nelford and Cecelia prepared themselves to listen attentively while he continued: "Myself and a brother were the only children of a wealthy gentleman in America. At an early age I longed for the sea, but my father strenuously opposed my desire, and with this the entreaties of a gentle and much loved mother, controlled my wishes and I remained at home a few years longer. Mean- while, I sought and believed I had won, the affections of a beautiful and accomplished young lady, a schoolmate and an associate of my earliest years. The ring upon your finger," he continued, addressing Cecelia, " was a gift from that lovely and pure-hearted-girl. For a short six months I was her constant at- tendant and devoted lover. About this time a young man of fine personal appearance and considerable endowments, commenced paying her some slight attentions. This annoyed and vexed me, and I commanded, rather than requested her, to speak with him no more. That night we parted in anger, and I took leave of my parents, and embarked for Portugal, -in the frigate Vul- ture, which was shipwrecked upon a barren island, from which a pirate vessel rescued me, and I became a corsair.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       3" "We fought many battles, and in one of them the com- mander was killed, and I was chosen leader of the crew. My first move was to sail for the coast of America, and secure the person of my betrothed bride. This done, I weighed anchor, and stood out to sea. I then descended to the state-room oc- cupied by the object of my affections, who crouched in one cor- ner of the room, trembling with fear, and begging to be returned to her parents and her home. "I promised her that she should, as soon as our marriage had been solemnized. .I then tried, by the most tender expres- sions of affection, to win the former confidence of my beautiful captive. This proving unavailing, I left her, thinking that solitude might make my presence more agreeable to her. "While sitting alone in the cabin, thinking of the possible return of the poor girl-for my heart reproached me for the cruelty of the act in tearing her from her parents, and com- pelling her to become my bride-I was suddenly startled by a broadside from the guns .of a schooner, which had been mis- taken for a merchant vessel by the blundering look-out. I hastened upon deck, and thinking that but little damage had been done, I ordered them to crowd on all sail, and descended to the cabin. Recollecting that my captive might have been alarmed, I hastened to the room occupied by her. Oh I the agony of that moment," exclaimed the corsair, ringing his hands. "I found her lying by the side of a window, her clothes saturated with blood, from a ghastly wound near her heart. As I lifted her up, she whispered, 'I go-I forgive you, farewell--0h I give me back to my mother.'" For some time the pirate remained silent. Then turning to Cecelia, he inquired: "Can you tell me my name?" "Charles Grey!--the lost brother of my grandfather," re- plied Cecelia. "'Tis so," replied the corsair; " and never since the death of my Lucretia has innocence or beauty suffered through me.  &#xD;<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7463-00000197"/> 378       OECELIA GREY; OR, THE I have sought and laid up wealth sufficient to satisfy the desires of the most avaricious.

At some future time I intend to leave this course of life, and return to our native land. Until then you must be content to share my destiny. Will you be so kind, madam, as to inform me by what name I am to address you?"  "Cecelia Nelford," replied Cecelia. "Nelford!" exclaimed the pirate, springing to his feet, and turning to Charles. "Then you are a relative of my lost Lucretia?" he inquired. "Lucretia Nelford was my father's aunt," sternly replied Nelford. "Ah! you may well abhor me then," said the pirate, hiding his face in his hands. Charles watched the trembling form of the aged corsair, as his sinewy frame shook with the agony of repressed feel- ings. Suddenly the pirate captain regained his composure, and with a firm, elastic step, advanced to the side of Cecelia, and slipping a valuable diamond ring from his finger, requested her to give her ring in exchange. Cecelia took the ring from her finger and handed it to the pirate, who received it and left the room. Nelford. now had no fears for Cecelia or himself, and they retired to enjoy rest, which,'through fear, they had been de- prived of. The succeeding day Nelford requested the Spanish lady to inform the captain that they would be pleased to go upon deck. The pirate chief personally answered the summons, and tak- ing Cecelia upon one arm, led the way, and Nelford walked after them.

The sea was as smooth as a mirror. Not a ripple appeared upon its surface as they neared the island. Suddenly the vessel lay almost still, and a gun was fired for the pilot. Cecelia gazed with wonder upon the vast pile of rocks against whose base the still water laid, and upon whose craggy summit the sunbeams played. Nelford looked with horror, as he said, "I see no inlet, no sign of a bay where the vessel can come to anchor." Quickly, from what appeared to be a mountain of rocks, em- erged a little skiff, propelled by a single oarsman. As the crew recognized  him they gave three hearty cheers. The boat advanced part way from the island, then put about. The schooner immediately filled away, and steered directly after the little boat. "Are they mad?" exclaimed Nelford; "this schooner can never enter the little passage between the rocks--never!" They watched with beating hearts the way of the schooner, and soon her sides wpre almost grating the rocks upon either hand. She struggled, the crew doubled their exertions; sud- denly a  breeze sprung up and the sails filled, the vessel shot forward, and entered a little bay. On one side the perpendicu- lar rocks arose to a  great height; on the other, the most enchanting scenery arrested the eye. Trees in bloom and the ripened fruit grew side by side.

This little valley lay between two mountains of rocks; one comprising the whole of the centre of the island, and of great height--the other extending along the shore, hiding from the observation of those at sea, the whole of the delightful region. Immediately after landing, Cecelia and Nelford were placed in a carriage with the corsair captain, the'Spanish maiden, and the black girl that had been their principal attendant through the commands of Isabella. They rode a short distance, enjoying the varied beauties surrounding them and inhaling the rich perfumery of the spicy breezes, when they entered a village built up in the most attractive style. On one street they saw a row of cottages surrounded with the most beautiful flower gardens. On another was the man- sions of the wealthiest, and in the centre of the village a large building of great magnificence. standing in the centre of a large square, and surrounded with lofty shade trees. Towards this building they advanced. Two blacks stood by the gate, which they swung open, and the carriage passed through. They thenadvanced through a long avenue of shade trees, to the front of the mansion, where two other attendants stood ready to assist them tonalight. Charles Grey received the salutation of the servants with graceful condescension, and bade them prepare the whole of the right wing of the mansion for the accommodation of Nel- ford and his attendants. The servants touched their straw hats and went to obey their master's orders. Meanwhile, the corsair informed Nelford that the whole of the right wing of the mansion, comprising many apartments, was cut off from the main building by a large hall. Also, that Isabella and the black girl would occupy it with them as their attendants, and their food should be sent from his kitchen at regular hours; and they would never be inter- rupted, unless it was when he chose to dine with them. He also informed them that they could go wherever they chose,  &#xD;<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7463-00000199"/> 382       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE and command whatever they desired upon the island, for he owned everything in common with the principal inhabitants. The cottages were occupied by the captains, who would rejoice to welcome him to the island. One of the attendants returned to them and led the way to the right wing of the mansion, and gave the keys into the hands of Nelford. They entered the apartments which were to become their home with sad hearts. Neither could the magnificence of their furniture, nor the sublime beauty of the scenery revealed from the large open windows console them. The rich Persia carpets gave back no sound to their footsteps, as they advanced from room to room, unable to choose from the splendor surrounding them. The Spanish maiden was allowed the first choice of sleeping apartments, and she chose for herself and the black girl adjoining rooms. Nelford and Cecelia then returned to the room they first entered, and resolved to occupryit as their private sitting-room. The room adjoining for the reception room, the sleeping and dressing apartments opening from the first room. The ensuing morning the pirate chief sent them his compli- ments, saying he would breakfast with them. As Nelford bowed his head and besought Heaven's blessing upon the food, the pirate became very much agitated, but did not, however, leave the table. He passed the most of the morning with them, and then requested the pleasure of break- fasting with them continually. With the request Nelford could not do otherwise than com- ply, and the chief informed them that the most of the inha-bi- tants of the place would call during the day-to receive the benediction of their pastor. The large hall which they passed through would answer the purpose for the performance of the Sabbath services ; and Nel- ford would be expected to deliver a sermon there every Sab- bath, and as much oftener as he should feel inclined.   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       383 Nelford found many Christians among the captives, who com- prised people from all nations. Many of the wives of the pirates had been nurtured in the lap of the church, and were praying and entreating for the conversion of their husbands and their children. Nelford ascertained that the island contained about five hundred inhabitants-men women and children. Five vessels of different sizes were anchored in the harbor, besides several skiffs, and fishing smacks. The island was nine miles long and six wide. The mountains were Alive with serpents-the val- ley with the sweetest songsters in the world. A goldfinch had built its nest near the mansions and Cece- lia sat hours by the lattice, listening to the melody of its song. Isabella, the Spanish maiden, and Cecelia became very much attached to each other. Isabella inf6rmed Cecelia that she was the daughter of a Spanish grandee. Her father had sent her to England to complete her education, when the pirates took the vessel, pillaged and sunk it; saving none of her pas- sengers or crew, with the exception of herself. She was very young, and Cecelia pitied her as she thought of her lonely situation among a band of desperadoes. *-   *   *   8   *       3  Two years passed away. Nelford prayed and fearlessly strove to impress upon the minds of the hardened corsairs, the worth- lessness of the wealth they were accumulating, and the value of their immortal souls, strongly denouncing their vile deeds of bloodshed and cruelty. Every Sabbath saw the hall filled with weeping, praying captives, hardened cursing corsairs, and the wives and children of the deluded men. Still no visible effect had been produced upon their hardened, avaricious hearts. -Another two years, and Cecelia sat by an open window, dancing her youngest child in her arms and watching Isabella as she led her little Arthur among the flowers and shrubbery of the garden.  &#xD;<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC7463-00000200"/> 384       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE ' Alice!" said Nelford, taking the babe from its mother's arms and tossing it in the air. "Oh I if mamma could only see our little Alice," exclaimed Cecelia, bursting into tears. "Do you think those pirates will forever retain us prisoners?" "Murmur not, dear Cecelia," replied Nelford. "I have some hopes of being allowed to return. Charles Grey informed me that six months since the corsairs of Rock Rose had ceased to exist. Since that time they had traded with other nations, loading their vessels with the products of the island, and pur. chasing flour and other articles of comfort for their return voy- age. I hastened to the harbor and found the vessels all newly painted, with the flag of Spain streaming from every one of them. As their crew saw me they gave three hearty cheers, and invited me to come on board the vessels. This I did, and joined in prayer with them. On leaving, I said, 'I trust these decks will never again bear the impress of violence and blood-' shed.' The crew took off their caps and raised their right hands exclaiming-"Never i while the earth revolves beneath the azure arch of heaven shall these hands be raised to do a deed of cruelty or of oppression.' And I hastened home, dear Cecelia, to gladden your heart with this faint hope of being allowed to return to our native land." Cecelia left her babe in the'care of Nelford, and went out to make a few calls. At every step she was saluted by the inmates of some dwelling, or some neighboring captive of the island. Many sighed, as they exclaimed, "All is beautiful here ; but this place. will never be home." Cecelia spoke cheerfully and encouragingly to all; by her happy smile gladdening many a heart, and yielding hope to the desponding. Cecelia called at a small cottage at the outskirts of the village, and was met at the door by an aged lady, who received her with much joy, and led her into the parlor. "Have you heard the joyous news?" inquired the lady,   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.      385 almost dancing for joy, while happy tears rolled down her cheeks. "No-indeed I I have not heard anything that can, to any great degree, elate me," replied Cecelia. "I have heard that the pirates of Rock Rose were to pursue their deeds of cruelty no further. That, to be sure, is happy news; but not the tidings I long to hear." "Oh I it is not that-it is not that!" exclaimed the lady. "I am so happy-I was never so delighted in my life. After living here twelve years with my husband, having left a child two years old in England, I am about to return to my native land. Yes I and see my dear boy again." "Possible?" ejaculated Cecelia. "I have heard nothing of it." "Well, it is so!" said the woman ; " a letter was just left here from the chief, who tells us to make up the amount of our loss with the interest, since the time we fell into their hands, and take our solemn oaths not to reveal the piracies of the inhabitants of Rock Rose, and we shall. be returned to our native land. My husband was so elated, that he could not stay at home ; but must fly to spread the glad tidings." "Ah!" replied Cecelia, "that was why he hastened so rapidly from one dwelling to another along the street." "It was-it was i" returned the happy lady, who rejoiced in the hope of meeting parents, brothers and sisters, and her loved child again. Cecelia did not remain long with the excited lady, but returned home to inform her husband and learn his hopes in regard to their release from captivity. Nelford learned they would be unwilling to allow him to Leave them; for who would fill his place when they were gone.  In this uncertainty, they bade adieu to the most of the cap- tives that wished to leave the island. The only answer to their entreaties was, "How can we spare you?" *1'  &#xD;<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7463-00000201"/> 386       , CECELIA GREY; OR, THE Cecelia had the consolation of sending several letters to her friends by the vessels that sailed with the other captives. None of them, however, reached her parents. Meanwhile, Mr. and Mrs. Grey had not the faintest hope of ever seeing or hearing from Cecelia again. They knew the vessel had never reached its destined port, and they mourned for them as for the dead. Another minister had been sent to the mission, and Charles Nelford was forgotten by all, but those nearest to him. Alpha Nelford had grown weaker after the departure of her brother; and the sudden news of his loss at sea overcame her so much, that it threw her into a violent fit of sickness, from which she never recovered. The very day on which Nelford whispered a hope of their being allowed to return to their native land, Alpha Nelford was consigned to her last resting- place in the little churchyard of Edenville, and by the side of Herbert Lincoln. Edgar Lee, the husband of Mary Lee Clermont, had followed his first wife to the grave, and was laid by her side. Mrs. Lee had refused to share in the property, which was equally divided between his two children--Ada and -Del. phin. Ada occupied the mansion of her father with her husband' Delphin Lee was intelligent, respectable and wealthy, and the object of the solicitude of intriguing mammas and affected misses. Edgar Lee, the brother of Alice and Emily, still occupied the mansion of the De Manuels with his accomplished wife, her mother and his own mother, Mrs. Lee. His young wife lost her father soon after the death of Mr. Lee ; and her mother was very anxious to enjoy the society of her early benefactress in her declining years. Ralph Harwood was one of the first men in the city, both in influence and affluence; and his happy wife was the loved of many grateful hearts and happy homes.    VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       387 Isaac de Vere had squandered his property, abused his wife and three small children, and left them in a hovel, where he had conveyed them to starve or beg, as inclination or opportunity offered. He was now a drunkard, a street brawler, and a fre- quenter of low gaming-houses, where he expended what little money he could pick up. His father sheltered him, and cursed his wife as the ruin of his son, refusing to see or assist either her or her children. Some two years after the departure of Cecelia, Alice, una- ware of the aristocratic friends which Emily had invited to pass the day with her, entered her parlor unannounced. This so incensed Emily, that she bade her never cross her thresh- hold again, unless attired as a lady should be, who took the liberty of calling upon her. Since that time, Alice had never seen Emily--Emily having refused to be present at the funeral of her step-father, from some little difficulty with Ada. One bitter cold evening, as Alice, with a friend, was passing a low, dilapidated building, she heard the low moanings of a child accompanied with the sobs of a woman. Alice cautiously advanced, and pushing open the door, saw a woman with a child in her arms, another at her feet, and a third lying upon a bunch of clothes in the corner. There was no fire, and only a feeble light in the lamp, while the child at the woman's feet, moaned and cried for food. As Alice stepped towards her, tears of pity rolled down her cheeks. The feeble woman started to her feet, and buried her face in her hands, exclaiming: "My sister Alice I oh, my sister.' - Alice caught the light and peered into the face of the hag- gard, care-worn woman; then dropping the lamp, exclaimed: "Emily I it is Emily!"And then tearing the shawl from her own shoulders, she wrapped it around the moaning child, and bidding Emily wait patiently until she returned, she hastened home.  &#xD;<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7463-00000202"/> 388       CECELIA. GREY; OR, THE Her husband met her at the door, and started back, exclaim- ing: "What is it, Alice?--what is it you have in that shawl?" "My sister's starving child!" she replied. "Quick, call Mar- garette." Harwood instantly complied, and the careful Margarette took charge of the little one. Meanwhile, Harwood procured a carriage, and with his weep- ing wife went to bring home her sister, who had never, in her days of affluence, condescended to step within their humble abode. Alice took wine and warm clothing for the little ones; and giving each a small portion, she took the youngest child in her arms, while Harwood carried the eldest, and supported the tottering steps of the mother. They entered the carriage, and returned home, where Emily and her children were clothed and fed by Ralph Harwood. After he had learned that she had been refused shelter by the father of her husband, he inquired why she had not come to them? "Because," she replied, "of my heartless conduct towards my sister in the days of my prosperity. I -thought that Alice could never forgive me." "You judged me very cruel," replied Alice.- "I always pitied more than blamed you." "Henceforth you will make it your home with us," resumed Harwood. "We have enough for all." Emily was astonished at the richness and taste evinced in the abode of the humble mechanic, as she still supposed Har- wood-for she had studiously avoided speaking of her brother- in-law. Nelford and Cecelia had been five years upon "Rock Rose,' as the pirates had designated the little island, from its rocky shores and inland beauty; Nelford faithfully studying the spiritual welfare of the inhabitants, and laboring with them.   VICISSlTlUDES OF FORTUNE.       389 Cecelia had taken her children and sought the presence of her father's uncle, who received her visits with the sincerest pleasure. As he held little Arthur Nelford, rocking and tossing him alternately, he made Cecelia minutely relate the early life of her father, with the loss of her grandfather's property. He then inquired if they still wished to return to their native land? "Do we?" exclaimed Cecelia; " can we forget the voice of a tender mother? the blessings of our mourning father? Mourn. ing because his only child shall never again return to make bright the home of her infantile years. Oh 1I my heart longs for the green woods and shady nooks of my father's home. Do not-oh I do not torment me thus; but tell me--may H'can I leave this place and return to our native land?" "I not will keep you in suspense," returned the chief. "Know then, that to-morrow we leave the island forever. I am going with you, and would pass my last days with the only relatives I have on earth. - Now go and break the joyful tidings to your husband." Cecelia almost flew to Nelford, whose joy equalled her own, at the unexpected announcement. The remainder of the day was passed in packing their baggage and furniture for trans- portation, and taking leave of their friends upon the island. A large vessel was fitted out and laden with the wealth of the corsair chief, and Charles Grey, Cecelia, And Nelford- embarked in it for America. In a few hours they cleared the harbor and stood out to sea, with a fair breeze to waft them to their native land. Isabella, the Spanish maiden, still shared the fate of Cecelia, who promised to assist her to procure a passage home, after their arrival in America. In a comparatively short time the vessel touched the wharf from which Cecelia and Nelford had embarked a few years previous ; and while Cecelia was preparing to go on shore, Charles Grey, entered their state-room, informing them that he had  &#xD;<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC7463-00000203"/> 390       CECELIA GREY; OR, THE come to solicit a favor. "I wish you to remain on board a, few days longer," he said, " which request, if you will comply with, I promise you that you shall never regret." Nelford consented to the proposal, wondering why he could wish to retain them on board the vessel. A fortnight passed slowly away, and they had seen or heard nothing from the cap- tain, and they resolved if he did not return by the morrow to leave the vessel and go to the house of Edgar Lee, where they knew they would receive a cordial welcome. The ensuing morning, while sipping their coffee in the cabin, the captain suddenly entered-caught little Arthur in his arms and exclaimed, "So my little man must get his cap and get into the pony carriage, with Uncle Charles, papa, mamma, little sister and Isabella and we will all go home." 't Home I and see black Hattie," laughed- the little fellow, springing for his cap. An hour after and they were seated in a carriage and mov- ing swiftly along from one street to another; Cecelia wonder- ing to what place he was conveying them. At last the carriage stopped before the identical mansion that had received Alice and Mary Clermont as brides, so many years pirvious. The building had been remodelled in the latest style, and was still a splendid dwelling. Charles Grey alighted from the carriage and led Cecelia in- to the parlor of the mansion, followed by Nelford, the child- ren and Isabella. "One half of this mansion is yours," said Charles Grey, turning to and addressing Nelford and Cecelia I "As for Isa- bella, you can do as you please about entertaining her. There are ten thousand pounds, which I give to her, to compensate for the wrongs she has endured in being detained upon the island against her will. Two rooms in this mansion I retain as my own. The remainder will be occupied by those for whom they were prepared. The ensuing day, Cecelia and Nelford were making prepara-   VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE.       391 tions to visit their parents, when the doors were suddenly thrown open, and Mr. and Mrs. Grey, followed by the judge and Mrs. Nelford, entered the apartment i With a cry of joy, Cecelia threw herself into her mother's arms, who folded her to her heart, and swooned for joy. Mr. Grey tried in vain to speak, as he looked again and again upon his restored child. Mrs. Nelford hung upon the neck of Charles, while his father silently pressed his hand within his own. When Mrs. Grey had recovered her consciousness, and each of the party, from excess of joy, had indulged in tears, and re- gained composure, Nelford related their adventures, and Cece- lia learned the particulars of all that had transpired during their long absence. Nelford sought the presence of Charles Grey-led him to the parlor, and presented him to the parents of his wife, the judge, and Mrs. Nelford. They now learned that Mr. and Mrs. Grey, with the judge and Mrs. Nelford, had received notice that if they would repair to the mansion at such a time, they would hear from their lost children.  Mr. and Mrs. Grey expressed their thanks to their new found relative,- who shared in the universal joy. Charles Grey insisted upon Mr. Grey's taking up his abode with them, and presented him a  deed of a large mercantile establishment, with deposits in the bank exceeding one hundred thousand dollars. Thus, Arthur Grey suddenly found himself occupying   the mansion which had sheltered him in his youth, and made dear by a thousand recollections, with a handsome fortune at his disposal, and two lovely grandchildren climbing into his arms, and putting up their ruby lips for a kiss from grandpa. Nelford received a benefice from the principal church in the city, and from his piety and talent, for many years occupied the same pulpit. Cecelia sought out her old friends, and passed many happy  &#xD;<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC7463-00000204"/> 392       CECELIA -GREY; O,0] TE            days in their society. Delphin 'Lee became acquainted with the beautiful Spanish maiden, and sought and won her affec- tions. They were married, and for their bridal tour visited the parents of the bride in her native land. Charles Grey lived a few years to repent of his evil deeds, and reform. He gave large amounts to the poor and needy, and won a blessing from many a dying lip; and at his death he bequeathed all his immense wealth to Cecelia and Nelford. Thus, gentle reader, we will leave them to enjoy the happi- ness which truth and virtue ever bestow upon their votaries, whether situated in a palace or a cottage. THE END.   ;r i   &#xD;</p>
