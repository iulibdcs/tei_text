            <p>BETWEEN the two rivers which enclose the great and growing city of Pittsburgh, stood
               the old French fort which gives name to our story. Within a brief distance lies the
               scene of Braddock's bloody battle, and disastrous defeat; which, together with the
               remarkable expedition that terminated there, form, as it were, the central points of
               this historical novel. It seems most appropriate, therefore, as it certainly is most
               agreeable to the Author, that to the PEOPLE OF PITTSBURGH, among whom he has passed
               his whole life, and whose sturdy virtues and contempt for shams he has ever
               respected, this attempt to weave into a readable romance some of the stirring events
               connected with the struggle for their old fort, and to introduce a few of the more
               notable characters, white and red, who lived or fought along their three rivers,

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is rather an odd coincidence, that part of the title of this book bears precisely
               the same name as that of the now famous Modoc Chieftain, whose late exploits are
               familiar to the whole nation. We need only say in explanation that <emph>our</emph>
               Captain Jack was a veritable character in Colonial annals, known as a famous
               border-ranger along the whole Pennsylvania frontier, and that the historical novel,
               in which he is made to figure as the hero, was not only written but <emph>was in
                  print,</emph> before the author even so much as heard there was
                  <emph>another</emph> Captain Jack, of a deeper color, whose bloody and desperate
               deeds give him a rather bad pre-eminence. A brief biographical notice of the
                  <emph>Pennsylvania</emph> Jack will be found in the Appendix at the end of this
               volume.</p>
            <p>The object of the present book may be expressed in few words. The spot where now
               stands the great and prosperous city of Pittsburgh, was once a place not only of
               national, but of world-wide importance. Great Britain, France, Great Britain again,
               Virginia, the United States, and, lastly, Pennsylvania, have each, in turn, exercised
               sovereignty over it. In 1774 it was the field of controversy between neighboring
               States, and in 1794 was, with the circumjacent territory, the scene of a formidable
               insurrection.</p>
            <p>"Old Fort Duquesne" existed but about five years, yet during that brief time was a
               place of great importance and over-shadowing interest. It was the first point of
               struggle between the French and English for the possession of all the vast domain
               watered by the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and their tributaries. If not the cause,
               it formed the occasion of the celebrated "Seven Years War," which involved almost<pb
                  n="6-7 (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC7175-00000004"/> most all Europe in
               desperate conflict. It was the object of Braddock's far-famed though ill-fated
               expedition, terminating in one of the most disastrous defeats ever known to history,
               and, by consequence, the ruthless scourging of the Pennsylvania border by savages,
               from the Potomac to the Juniata.</p>
            <p>Then ensued the memorable defeat of Grant and his Highlanders at a point in the very
               centre of the present city of Pittsburgh; the advance of General Forbes' British
               American army; the evacuation and destruction of Fort Duquesne by the French, and the
               subsequent construction of the costly and formidable Fort Pitt, which endured even to
               the present century.</p>
            <p>It is fitting, therefore, that some "Old Mortality" should essay—with what success
               the kind reader must determine—to re-grave the almost effaced and perishing lines of
               a long-distant past; should seek to weave together in a readable form the more
               memorable and interesting events of that very exciting period; to revive some of the
               more striking historic associations which cluster about the old French fort; to fight
               over again the disastrous battle of Braddock's Fields, and, finally, to introduce the
               most notable persons engaged—Indian chiefs, white scouts, and prominent officers, the
               more important of whom were Braddock and Washington.</p>
            <p>It is, therefore, to such a distant and almost forgotten past that we have the
               temerity to invite the reader's attention, and it is in the fortunes of the old
               French fort which stood at the head of the Ohio that we seek to engage his interest
               and occupy his fancies.</p>

               <p>STRANGER, should a leisure day ever happen you in Pittsburgh, be sure to take car
                  of the "inclined railway" and be swiftly conveyed to the summit of the lofty and
                  precipitous hills which stretch along the thither side of the Monongahela. Then
                  walk along the comb of "Coal Hill" from the Suspension Bridge down to "Saw Mill
                  Run," and—if the day be a clear one—such a strange, busy, and<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000006"/> withal, beautiful scene, will fill your eye, and
                  such a hum and buzz, and clamor—greatly deadened by distance—strike your ear, as
                  have no parallel anywhere—certainly not on <emph>this</emph> continent.</p>
               <p>At one <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup d'œil,</foreign> three broad and affluent
                  rivers, with their teeming valleys, lie stretched beneath you, the line of
                  separation between the muddy and sluggish waters of the Monongahela, and the
                  clearer and more rapid waters of the Allegheny, being most distinctly and
                  curiously marked for some distance down the Ohio.</p>
               <p>Ranges of bold and picturesque hills jostle and overlap each other on every side;
                  here shooting up in savage and craggy heights, and there rolling back from the
                  waters in graceful curves and billowy slopes. All the ledges, "bottoms," and
                  gentler inclines on both sides of each river, are crowded with blocks of dingy,
                  smoke-stained houses; streets creeping up the sides or pushing over the very
                  summits of the hills; villas and mansions nestling in the favored nooks, or daring
                  the dizzy heights; mills and factories hugging the hill sides as if fighting for
                  place to live and work; "pillars of smoke by day, and of fire by night," from
                  countless mills, forges, furnaces, ovens and foundries, and then, with all this,
                  there surges up to your vexed ear, wave upon wave of indefinite sounds—the heavy
                  thud of the forge-hammer, the hum of the factory, the rattle of rolls and
                  machinery, the clangor of the boiler yards, the shriek of locomotive, ferry and
                  steamer, and that blended and confused din arising from multiplied branches of
                  industry. A night scene from this point, with the huge fires from mill, oven and
                  furnace glaring against the sky, is simply a glance into Pandemonium. It is, as
                  some writer more forcibly than elegantly expresses it, "hell with the lid
                  off."</p>
               <p>A thriving, and rapidly-growing city of nearly two hundred thousand souls lies
                  before you. A hundred spires and towers announce that God, as well as Mammon, is
                  worshipped here. Academies, hospitals, seminaries, and public buildings are dimly
                  seen in all directions, denoting a people of heart, of conscience, and of culture,
                  and yet all this is but the growth of a single century. If, as Tennyson writes,
                  "Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay," of how much more value is
                     <emph>one</emph> year in <emph>America,</emph> where life is so intensified,
                  and where growth is such a very marvel, that the wild dream of yesterday becomes
                  the sober reality of to-day—where the Atlantic telegraph of one year is succeeded
                  by the Pacific Railroad of the next? The ivy-mantled abbeys and castles of England
                  date from William the Conqueror, over eight hundred years ago. <emph>One</emph>
                  hundred years here suffice to give the stamp of antiquity, and the magic growth of
                  Chicago and St. Louis may soon be paralleled by that of Salt Lake, or San
                  Francisco. (See <hi rend="i"/>Appendix A.)</p>
               <p>On the summit of Coal Hill, from which you are supposed to have been gazing, and
                  directly opposite the "Point" of Pittsburgh, which marks the junction of the
                  Allegheny and the Monongahela, and on which stood, in olden times, the formidable
                  and far-famed French Fort Duquesne, there lies a jutting slope, overlooking a
                  sheer precipice of two hundred feet, and flanked on one side by a deep ravine,
                  worn from the rock by some old water course which brawled its way to the river
                  below.</p>
               <p>On the 5th of July, 1755—for it is to such a distant past that we have the
                  temerity to invite our reader's attention—this prominent brow appeared but
                  slightly different from what it does now. Time works but little change on the
                  bolder forms of nature. It may scar, and seam, and corrode, but it requires the
                  earthquake's power to overthrow or destroy. The grassy slope was of a more vivid
                  green than now, and enamelled with bright wild flowers. All around, far as eye
                  could reach, was one boundless sea of verdure, having, too, the freshness and high
                  color of early<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7175-00000007"/> summer. A huge oak, which
                  had for centuries wrestled with the storms coming up from the gulf, and had stood
                  on the very verge of the height, had, years before, been stricken and riven with
                  the bolt, and—wrested from its deep anchorage—lay prone with its mighty trunk
                  athwart the very brow of the hill, its shaggy bark and decaying wood nourishing a
                  most profuse growth of mosses.</p>
               <p>At a little distance back, and as if begrudging even this narrow mead to the grass
                  and flowers, stood the virgin forest, with its serried ranks of oak and elm, and
                  clean-leaved maples, and tulip-trees. Underneath the leafy canopy was the usual
                  undergrowth of an American forest, while the damp and dewy ground was covered with
                  vines, ferns, mosses, and other forms of a luxuriant and redundant vegetation.</p>
               <p>At the nearest verge of this wood, beneath a low dogwood, and just at the gray
                  dawn of what promised to be a most beautiful day, a party of two whites and an
                  Indian was sitting at what might literally be called a <emph>break-fast,</emph>
                  for the food was only slices of jerked venison, and army bread, and for a relish,
                  water from a spring hard by. Guided by the lights from Fort Duquesne, and the
                  Indian camp fires around, they had arrived at this appointed place late the night
                  before, and had slept where they were eating, each on his couch of last year's
                  leaves. They needed not to court "tired nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep;" it
                  came to them unsought, and graciously, amid the hootings of the owl, the howlings
                  of the wolf, and the many strange and uncanny night voices of an American
                  wilderness abounding in every variety of life.</p>

               <p>THE oldest, and apparently the leader of the party—mark him well, reader, for he
                  was a most notable person in those days—was still in the very prime of life,
                  compact of frame, and resolute of manner. His blue eye was without guile; the
                  lines of his countenance all spoke frankness and sincerity, while the cut of the
                  mouth and the squareness of the lower face gave token of firmness and courage.
                  There was an engaging frankness, and an unstudied repose and simplicity of manner
                  about him, which invited confidence.</p>
               <p>And such a man emphatically he was, as his solitary and daring life had amply
                  proven. No bewigged and belaced trifler of the city, he, but a true child of the
                  forest; familiar<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7175-00000008"/> with nature in all her
                  varied moods; more thoroughly versed in wood-craft than any man in the colonies;
                  the companion and friend of the wily and untutored savage; shrewd, patient,
                  tireless, knowing no fear, he was a true and loyal nature's nobleman, every inch
                  of him, and every fibre of his body.</p>
               <p>Raised on the Yadkin, North Carolina, he was a surveyor by profession, and a
                  restless rover by nature. With the same mysterious spirit stirring within him
                  which afterward drove Boone, Poe, Kenton, the Wetzels and other famous pioneers,
                  to dwell in solitudes, and wage constant battle with whatever foes might offer, he
                  had passed nearly his whole life in the woods; had made repeated and solitary
                  excursions to the then unknown West; had often penetrated vast distances and
                  brought back strange reports; had been sent on important missions to Western
                  tribes; had sought out hostile chiefs of fame and prowess, and disarmed them by
                  his nerve and coolness; had accompanied Washington, two years before our story
                  opens, on his celebrated mission to the French Commandant at French Creek, and was
                  now in the employ of General Braddock—who, with his slowly advancing army, was but
                  a few days distant—as chief guide.</p>
               <p>Truly a man of nerve, and of mark. What stories could he not tell of "moving
                  accidents by flood and field, and hair-breadth 'scapes;" of solitary and perilous
                  wanderings amid unbroken forests, where foot of white man had never yet trod; of
                  lonely vigils by night, and weary tramps by day, threading vast solitudes on
                  devious Indian trails, and couching himself amid wild beasts and savages. And now
                  there he sat, clad in the free and simple garb of a scout, with moccasined feet,
                  beaded leggings of deerskin, a fringed hunting shirt, a keen-bladed hunter's knife
                  in his belt, a powder horn at his side, and his bullet and greased patch-pouches
                  depending from his waist; the fresh and balmy air of morning playing about his
                  bared brow. He seemed of the woods a part, as much as ever did Robin Hood in
                  Sherwood forest. His very clothes had, as it were, an odor of the woods—a perfume
                  of earthy mould, of fragrant leaves, and of trodden flowers. Christopher Gist, the
                  man whom we have thus briefly essayed to portray, and on whose life and exploits
                  we would gladly dwell, could be no other than he was and live out his nature. (See
                     <hi rend="i"/>Appendix B.)</p>
               <p>Near him, with figure motionless as a statue, and yet with ear alert and
                  attentive, and with gleaming eye ever searching out the intricacies of the forest,
                  sat the young Indian chieftain; his dress—except the breech-clout and blue
                  stroud—all from the woods, the spoil of beast and bird, and light as Indians in
                  summer generally wear; his scalp-lock braided with eagle feathers; his keen
                  tomahawk flashing from the shell-rimmed girdle, and his rifle lying within easy
                  grasp. His face was freshly and hideously decorated with vermilion, for he was on
                  the war-path. This was Fairfax, a Delaware—son of the celebrated Queen
                  Alaquippa—who had fought with Washington the year before, at the attack on
                  Jumonville, and at the miserable battle at Fort Necessity. Fairfax was the name
                  lately given him by Washington, who called him a "Great Warrior."</p>
               <p>How shall we describe the third member of the party so briefly as to individualize
                  him—his whole appearance and equipment so utterly out of keeping with the
                  backwoods? Imagine to yourself, reader, a slight, delicate, and rather laconic
                  specimen of humanity, of scarce two-and-twenty years, with blue eyes, ruddy
                  English face, blond hair, covered with a fashionable wig of the day, and a faint
                  suspicion of a moustache. Now see this delicate little duodecimo of a man in a
                  fashionable green velvet hunting suit, with knee-breeches and fine Hessian
                  half-boots; an efflorescence of ruffles about his bosom, and of ruffles trimmed
                  with lace<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7175-00000009"/> about his wrists, and you have
                  my young Lord Talbot, the fast son of a gouty English blue-blood, who was an early
                  friend of General Edward Braddock.</p>
               <p>But this by no means fully describes our young sprig of nobility; a most lady-like
                  gentleman, seemingly more fitted to grace the boudoir of a Grosvenor-street belle,
                  or an ogling lounge at Almack's club, than the rude encounters of an American
                  wilderness. This miniature cock-sparrow of a man, as is not unusual with bodies of
                  brief stature and of well-derived English blood, was as full of fight and pluck as
                  a king-bird, and as full of prejudice as an egg is full of meat. He had the most
                  overweening confidence in himself and everything English; despised and ridiculed
                  everything and everybody colonial; would take no advice; swore by Ed. Braddock;
                  abominated the frog-eating French, and was so saturated with the pride of caste as
                  to expose him to constant ridicule from the provincial officers. It was his
                  gaminess, gayety, and never-failing good nature which saved him from disrespect.
                  Add to this, that he boxed like Molyneux, was a perfect master of fence, and could
                  dance like a Parisian ballet girl, and nearly all has been said.</p>
               <p>This young lord, too, was rather <foreign xml:lang="FRA">blasé</foreign> in the
                  world's dissipations; had taken his hunts in India and Africa; had twice made the
                  continental tour; had been out one season—as an amateur—with the Duke of
                  Cumberland; had been well acquainted with Braddock, and the fast set of officers
                  with whom that brave but unfortunate general had associated in London, and had now
                  come over, with Admiral Keppel, in search of American adventure. He had joined
                  Braddock's army as a pet lord; had messed with gay young officers; danced war
                  dances with the Indians, and made love to their squaws and maidens—so long as they
                  were permitted to follow the camp—and now, hearing of this, the only scout that
                  Braddock had, in his pride and self-confidence, ever sent out—and that, too, at
                  the pressing instance of Washington—had so importuned and worried the general
                  that, after recounting the risks, and urging him in vain to throw aside so
                  unsuitable a garb, he was fain to let him go.</p>
               <p>"S'death, 'tis the last scout his father's son will ever want to make," said
                  Braddock, as Talbot moved airily and jauntily out of camp into a forest trail,
                  flourishing a light rapier for a cane, and with a short English rifle on his
                  shoulder. "'Twill be a miracle if he ever come back with that elegant head of
                  hair, or at least without having his brilliant plumage ruffled and besmirched; but
                  let him go; young bloods flout at gray heads."</p>
               <p>The frugal meal over, the party—Gist at some distance in front—began cautiously to
                  emerge from the forest, when a crackling, rushing noise at a little distance
                  startled them. The Indian glided instinctively behind the first tree, his rifle at
                  point, and his restless eye glancing in the direction of the sound, when a shaggy,
                  awkward animal was discovered walking hurriedly away from the little run. The red
                  man dropped his rifle and resumed his course; not so Talbot. Soon as he caught
                  sight of Bruin, and with a "By Jove, if that be not a bear, people have lied to
                  me," was just on point of pulling trigger, when Fairfax rudely seized his arm,
                  wrested the gun from his grasp, and angrily hissed out in pretty good English:</p>
               <p>"What for you shoot? You very young and no warrior. You mad? Delaware and Shawnee
                  'braves' all around—thick as leaves. You no want your much scalp? See here! mine
                  little and long. When time come, here it be for my foe, but not till then. We are
                  on the war trail now—no hunting jays. Be wise and still as the rattlesnake till
                  strike time comes."</p>
               <p>"Look-a-here, Mr. Indian, you red cocks o' the wood have a deuced familiar way
                  with a cove that I don't like.<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7175-00000010"/> Don't know
                  that we've ever been regularly introduced, and yet you lay rude hands on me as if
                  I were your squaw. Hands off next time, and give back my tool. I don't know but
                  you're right this time, but as for the tawny devils you seem to fear so, I can't
                  tell where they're skulking. I've not seen a tanned hide but yours since I left
                  camp."</p>
               <p>"Come, red man show you. Stoop down like him, and creep up behind log yonder,
                  where Captain Gist lies. He no girl. He Indian 'brave;' no shoot gun at bear right
                  above big Indian camp."</p>
               <p>With a feeling of no little disgust, the more so because he knew himself in the
                  wrong, Talbot crept behind the Indian towards the big oak already mentioned.</p>
               <p>"Now, Lord Talbot," spoke Gist; in low tones, "if you wish a glorious sight which
                  all America—and I dare say England, too, for that matter—cannot match, come to
                  this point and look down."</p>
               <p>"There you are again, Captain, with your American scenery, and woods, and canoes.
                  I haven't much reason to be in love with any of them. The canoe we yesterday came
                  down the yog-yoch-wauch—what the deuce do you call that cascady stream with the
                  jaw-breaking name, Cap?"</p>
               <p>"Yochiogheny."</p>
               <p>"Yokoginny. It e'enamost tears my throat to say it. Well, our trifling boat rocked
                  worse than a toy punt on the Cam. 'Twas well I had my hair fixed even all 'round
                  or I'd have upset. Why, whenever I'd pull my watch out, the old shell would dip,
                  so I near-a-most lost my wig—a head of hair, too, that cost me five pounds twelve
                  and six in the Strand. And as for your woods—bah! Just look at my clothes without
                  laughing outright, will you? What with being pricked and jagged with briars; my
                  best suit torn and scuffed with thorns; my eyes ever banged with wet boughs, and
                  my feet snared, like a hare, in pea-vines, and all sorts of entanglements, I look
                  like a Newgate thief, and, gad, I feel much like one, too.</p>
               <p>"Don't know when I'm well off, eh? Jupiter Ammon, Cap, if you'd ever been in an
                  English park, you would forever forswear American woods—the trees a thousand years
                  old, majestic and wide-spreading; not a bush, or briar, or sapling to be seen, but
                  all green sward, the hares and pheasants rising at every step, and the dappled
                  deer in huge herds, the stags in the rutting time fighting and bellowing and
                  crashing their horns together till you could hear them a mile. No, no, Captain;
                  you have woods without end in this country—as witness my dilapidated
                  appearance—but when you want groves, and parks, and gentlemen's preserves, you
                  must go, to 'merrie England.' As for your views, have you ever stood on Skiddaw
                  and took in the Cumberland lakes at a glance, or on Ben Lomond, with its lovely
                  lochs?—but, by the Lord Harry, Captain, that <emph>is</emph> a rather fine
                  lookout," concluded Talbot, as his head lifted over the log and his eyes took in
                  one by one the notable features of the scene below.</p>
               <p>His companions, one behind the log, and the other leaning behind a large oak which
                  stood near, wholly inattentive to his boastings, were earnestly gazing abroad over
                  the height. Gist's eye, assisted by a field glass which he carried with him,
                  rested long on the fort and its surroundings, which lay entirely open to his
                  scrutinizing and experienced gaze.</p>

               <p>A HEAVY white fog, which had lain close over, not alone the three rivers, but all
                  the flats adjoining, was rapidly lifting under the fervid beams of a glorious sun,
                  which was advancing with stately steppings on his triumphal march through the sky.
                  A perfect hush, almost painful in its intensity, was over all nature. The hills
                  and slopes, which had at first appeared like green islands rising from a white
                  sea, gradually, and one after another, stood revealed in all their rich and varied
                  beauty.</p>
               <p>The sun seemed to shed a golden glory on every object, and as the white vapors
                  curled and rolled lazily away, the warm tints and living colors took their places,
                  and the three rivers could be seen in all their pride and beauty, sweeping onward
                  with full banks between living walls of luxuriant verdure. From the willows which
                  dipped their pendant boughs in the stream, and rose and fell to the kissing
                  ripples, away up to the giant oaks and elms on the summits, which flaunted their
                  huge boughs, and struck down their strong roots, bidding defiance to centuries of
                  storms, all was a rich and luxuriant green, but a green pied and mottled with hues
                  and tints as varied as there were species of trees in the woods.</p>
               <p>The spot, however, which riveted and held spell-bound, as it were, the anxious
                  gaze of all was, of course, the French Fort Duquesne, whose strength and weakness
                  they had come there to spy out—the object of so much parade and preparation, and
                  to capture which, an army of drilled and veteran English regulars had specially
                  crossed the ocean. There it lay, snug and compact, right in the forks of the two
                  rivers—the banks of which were there high and steep—with its ditch, its double
                  line of log stockades, its draw-bridge, magazines, bastions, ramparts, and guns
                  too, all plainly revealed to view.</p>
               <p>It had long been a cherished opinion of Sir John St. Clair that it would be a
                  waste of time and blood to attack this fort in full front and by regular approach.
                  It would be taking the enemy just where he was strongest, and where he invited
                  attack; rather, argued the blunt old Quartermaster General, quietly drag guns up
                  to some dominating height and demolish it with hot shot.</p>
               <p>This was the reason, as well as to be able to look right down into every nook and
                  cranny of the fort, that the scout had been divided, one party, whose acquaintance
                  we have already made, to proceed to the hill-top opposite the place, while the
                  other was to make its way by river down close to the fort; study the ground around
                  and in front, and ascertain, if allowed, the force of Indian allies gathered there
                  and encamped about in the adjacent woods.</p>
               <p>We will describe the fort more fully hereafter. Suffice it now to say that Fort
                  Duquesne, although occupying but<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7175-00000012"/> little
                  space, was very strongly and compactly built, quadrangular in shape, with bastions
                  and strong stockades on the sides towards the country, the other two sides having
                  only strong stockades, framed of heavy logs wattled together with poles. An outer
                  line of log stockades, entrenchments seven feet high—the inner line being twelve
                  feet high—was cast up all around the fort, against which earth was thrown up. The
                  area inside, as clearly revealed to Gist, was closely covered with
                  buildings—barracks, guard house, officers' quarters, etc. All the ground about the
                  fort was firm and dry, and cleared for the space of a quarter of a mile around,
                  the trees cut off close to the earth that no enemy could approach under cover, and
                  that full and unobstructed range might be given for the artillery.</p>
               <p>Kitchen gardens had been laid out along the Allegheny river outside the fort; corn
                  was planted about in considerable quantity, and a flour mill had been erected near
                  by, so that the garrison should be, in a manner, independent of French Canada for
                  supplies.</p>
               <p>Outside the outer wall stood an isolated strong house for tools. All around on the
                  margin of the woods were located the bark tents and smouldering camp fires of the
                  Indians, who were evidently gathered in considerable force from the Canadas in the
                  North to the Illinois in the West, all summoned by Contrecœeur, late Commandant,
                  to repel Braddock's army, now almost daily expected. Too early for much stir yet,
                  but still a fresh smoke here and there, within and without the fort, betokened
                  preparation for the morning meal. (See <hi rend="i"/>Appendix C.)</p>
               <p>While Gist, in the line of his duty, was busy with glass and note book, jotting
                  down every single object of importance, the Indian called Talbot's attention to a
                  large white swan, which, with slow beat of pinion, and an occasional hoarse cry,
                  was lazily working its way up the Ohio, until it stood almost stationary over the
                  shallow waters covering a bar at the confluence of the two rivers.</p>
               <p>All at once, and so near as to startle the whole party, a loud haugh-ha-ha!
                  haugh-ha-ha! like the scream of a maniac, was emitted from a huge pine which stood
                  a little below them, which cry was answered by another and similar one, from a
                  heavily-wooded island in the Allegheny, across from the fort.</p>
               <p>The swan showed evident signs of terror and dismay; it dashed forward, wavered in
                  its flight, sunk, rose again, and then smote the air with strong, rapid wing. Too
                  late; the haugh-ha-ha was repeated, and a huge bald-headed eagle darted out from
                  its piny concealment, cleft the air with its mighty pinion, rose to a great
                  height, and with reversed wing, swooped down like a bolt on its prey, struck it
                  fiercely, and with admirable dexterity, pushed the dying swan in a slanting fall
                  on to the island, where the eagle was joined by its waiting mate. It was done all
                  in a minute, but it was well and cleanly done.</p>
               <p>"Je-hu, reddy," exclaimed the excited Talbot, "but that was quick work, and a
                  short shrift! 'Tis a fat breakfast for them, but they've fairly earned it, I must
                  say. Well, master Gist, now that I see you closing your note book, you wont
                  pretend to tell me that that miserable, good-for-nothing little fort, scarcely
                  bigger than a lady's kerchief, built out of logs and brush, and surrounded by a
                  few hundred skulking, cowardly savages, is the stronghold which has so long
                  bothered and defied all your colonies, and which has obliged our good old King
                  George to send over two of his best regiments, and one of his oldest generals, the
                  pet of our great Duke of Cumberland himself?"</p>
               <p>"The very same, my lord, the ve-ry same; and I greatly fear me, that unless
                  'Cumberland's pet' makes far greater speed than he has yet done, and if he
                  continue to have such an overweening confidence in his drillings and facings,
                     and<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7175-00000013"/> so little in his Indian and
                  colonial allies, that he will be some time beating and swearing before that old
                  log fort, ere he serves de Beaujeu with his 'writ of ejectment.' Lord bless you,
                  laddie, I think we of the backwoods ought to know <emph>something</emph> of
                  Indians and Indian ambushes and deviltries. We also have reason to know with what
                  admirable artifice the French manage their swarthy friends. They study well how to
                  please an Indian's eye, and gratify to the full his natural taste for gaud and
                  trinkets.</p>
               <p>"They throw about their gifts with no grudging hand, I tell ye; eat, live, sport,
                  and even marry with the Indians; manage them as Braddock's drum-major does his
                  bugles; can pacify or enrage; feed their pride, or their revenge. They stuff them
                  with lies, trap them with snares, hoodwink them with flatteries, and dress them in
                  fine feathers. Colonel Johnson, of New York, and Conrade Weiser and George
                  Croghan, of our colony, are about the only ones who understand the Indian nature,
                  and I dare swear, that had <emph>their</emph> advice been taken, there wouldn't
                  have been a redskin about that fort, and the frog-eaters would have been forced,
                  nilly-willy, to retire to Wenango, or float down to Orleans, without a blow. Look
                  at those encampments now! There's Quaker diplomacy for you! Now let's ask our
                  quiet Delaware here, as true, staunch a friend as e'er wore English stroud:</p>
               <p>"Fairfax, what is it your people have most complained of for the last few
                  years?"</p>
               <p>"Why," fiercely hissed out the Indian, "rum—one, two, three times, rum. White
                  brother drink 'fire-water' only a little, but red brother drink his head all away.
                  He grow dead like this log. He give land, give skins, give squaws, and papooses,
                  even, for more whiskey. All our chiefs ask our Fathers at Albany and Philadelphia,
                  to keep traders from selling rum; but no use, no use. What we get for our lands?'
                  he continued, sneeringly, sweeping his arm toward the eastern hills, and growing
                  more earnest as he advanced. "Few bead, and wampum, little paint, kettles, combs,
                  match-coats, looking-glass, and tinkle, tinkle bells. All gone in one moon.</p>
               <p>"Then come white man, build wigwam, cut down all big trees; shoot deer, bear and
                  buffalo, and say to poor Indian, '<emph>You</emph> good for nothing—lazy, lounging
                  dogs; not wanted here; go towards the setting sun.' Ten years ago, great many
                  Indians in Juniata, Conestoga, Susquehanna; many as these trees; now all, all
                  moving to find game—no game, no Indian. Queen Alaquippa good woman, much people.
                  She take fire-water, too, and behave very bad. When we no want to leave, our
                  masters, the big chiefs of 'Six Nations,' are brought to Albany. More bead, much
                  eat, much drink and paint, and then they order us off; say we're women, and have
                  no right to sell lands. English claim all lands <emph>this</emph> side Allegheny,
                  and the French all lands on other side. Now where, then, do the Indian lands lie?
                  tell me that!"</p>
               <p>"That's a poser, Fairfax," laughed Gist," and I'll never tell ye. Too much ugly
                  truth in what he says, Talbot; but we musn't be crooning over this now. It's about
                  the time when Captain Jack and Scarooyaddy, the Kalf-King, promised to meet us
                  here. I hope their scout turned out well. Nothing short of a scalping frolic will
                  make them break their plight."</p>

               <p>ANOTHER earnest and long-continued outlook followed, when Gist, as if musing with
                  himself, thus spoke:</p>
               <p>"Ah, me, how well I know the grounds hereabout. Look up the Allegheny. You can
                  just barely see, or think you see, the little island on which Major Washington and
                  I nearly froze to death one night last year. We were coming home from our visit to
                  French Creek, and had sent our horses before us, and wishing to cross the
                  Allegheny, which was bank-full of running ice, we had to spend a whole day with a
                  hatchet in making a raft. We had scarcely pushed out, when Washington's
                  setting-pole got caught in the huge cakes, and he was thrown out into tea feet
                  water, and came very near drowning.</p>
               <p>"'Twas with the greatest difficulty we made that little island, and passed there
                  the most wretched night we ever spent—a night which cost me many frozen toes and
                  fingers. Just look at my poor hands!"</p>
               <p>"And how," asked Talbot, "did you get out of the scrape?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! next morning the narrow part of the river was frozen tight, and we made for
                  land, and reached Queen Alaquippa's, Fairfax's mother. Warm as it is here now, it
                  makes me almost shiver to think about it. Only a day or two before, I caught a
                  scoundrelly Indian guide about to pull trigger on Washington, and had it not been
                  for the Major's kind heart, I would have brained the rascal on the spot, but
                  Washington let him off, although it was a mistake, it was a mistake." (See <hi
                     rend="i"/>Appendix D.)</p>
               <p>"Do you see that queer-shaped, woody hill there, rising out of the plain on the
                  other side of the Allegheny, looking for all the world like a hog's back? Well,
                  sir, would you believe it? I actually went around that hill once and went on down
                  the Ohio, perfectly ignorant of this Monongahela at our feet, although I ought to
                  have guessed it by the increased size of the Ohio when I came out upon it a couple
                  of miles down there.</p>
               <p>"You see, I crossed the Allegheny about two miles above 'Shannopin's town'—that
                  straggling Delaware village which you can just manage to see, if your eyes are as
                  good as mine—a short mile or so above the fort on the Allegheny. That trip I went
                  all alone as far as the Falls of the Ohio, and came back to my Carolina home only
                  to find that the Catawbas, or Cherokees—I never exactly knew which of the
                  thieving, scalping varmints to fasten it on—had burned my house, destroyed my
                  settlement, and driven my family up into Virginia.</p>
               <p>"Ah, younker, this roving, unsettled life is an overanxious and a worritsome one;
                  but it has its charms, lad; yes, it has its charms. I never feel happier, or freer
                     like<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7175-00000015"/> than when, with trusty rifle on
                  shoulder and a bit of jerked venison in my pouch, I swing off into some narrow
                  Indian trail, and commence peering about the leaves and twigs for Indian signs.
                  'Pears to me I feel sort o' stifled in the settlements—can't draw a deep breath.
                  Have been often in Philadelphia, and laughed consumedly at their queer fashions
                  and toggeries—the young bucks in their curled wigs, velvet knee-breeches, silk
                  stockings, and silver shoe buckles."</p>
               <p>"And whereas all the game, Captain, that they tell me infests these Western
                  wilds?" broke in Talbot. "'Cepting the clumsy bear I saw a while since, I never
                  have clapped eyes on any of your <emph>real</emph> game, though I've hunted wild
                  boar in Austria, and had tiger sport in India. I'd like to see your panther and
                  buffalo."</p>
               <p>"Well, you will, younker, if Braddock isn't driven back, and <emph>you</emph> be
                  not the game that's hunted; in the which case you will have enough to do to keep
                     <emph>your own</emph> pelt in place, without seeking some other poor
                  creature's. There's plenty of both panther and buffalo hereabouts, but far more
                  across the Allegheny. All the Ohio valley is but a hunting ground for the
                  Indians—very few large towns or villages. 'Tis extror'nary the distances these
                  pesky redskins come to hunt, or fight, or pillage. Why, I've met in these woods
                  outlying parties of Twightwees, Ottawas, Chippewas from the far lakes, and even
                  some of the Caughnewaugas from Canada, or the 'French praying Indians,' as they
                  are called.</p>
               <p>"Up towards Lake Erie, and the Muskingum river, now, where there are large grass
                  plains, and savannahs, the buffalo go in great droves. No man can call Chris Gist
                  a boaster, and it might appear like that, to tell of adventures and narrow escapes
                  in those dense woods with cats, bears and 'painters.' The hunting grounds
                  hereabouts are famous, I tell you."</p>
               <p>"Why, Cap," eagerly put in Talbot, "it 'spirits me to hear you talk; but what are
                  you chuckling at, man?"</p>
               <p>"Well," answered Gist, "it's easy to laugh right now and here, but the only time I
                  had to run from one of the varmints happened just over in those very forks, before
                  the dense timber was cleared off, and the fort built. 'Twas in '53, when out with
                  Major Washington on his way to Wenango. We had gone down two miles from here to
                  visit old Shingiss, king of the Delawares, as brave and cruel a Red as ever
                  twigged hair or cast a tomahawk. Shingiss and Tannacharison,—the last Half-King of
                  the Iroquois before Scarooyaddy—would not let him go on his journey until they had
                  had a grand pow-wow in the Council House at Logstown, and so the Major sent me up
                  in a canoe to examine these forks closer, as he thought it a good place for a
                  fort.</p>
               <p>"I landed just about dark, and lit my fire under a huge buttonwood, and was
                  quietly basting a turkey I had shot, when I hears a queer cry, much like that of a
                  baby. Well, now, every strange noise when one's alone in a wilderness, is
                  suspicious. I pricked up my ears, and listened, and listened, and again the same
                  weak, plaintive cry. Thinks I that's queer; must be distress there. It's an owl,
                  or 'possum, or mayhap, a mus'-rat. After awhile I hears it again, coming a little
                  from beyond the fire-light. I tell you I grew quite nervous, and all over queer
                  like. Soon as a fellow knows his danger he can front it like a man, but when he
                  don't, he's more like a girl—any new sound rasps his nerves, and makes his heart
                  go dumpety-dump, thumpety-thump; but suspense was awful, so I steps along, until I
                  came almost to the forest edge yonder, and after poking round awhile and seeing
                  nothing, I waited for the cry again.</p>
               <p>"Soon it came, and almost under my very nose; and there, under yonder sycamore, I
                  found a lump of something soft, and wet, and whining like. It crept up towards
                     me<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7175-00000016"/> with its most pitiful story, and,
                  scarce knowing what it was, I picked it up and carried it towards the fire. It had
                  probably missed its leap, and fell from the tree into the water, as it appeared
                  all cold and numb-like, for it was in a raw November. It cuddled up and nestled in
                  my bosom just like a kitten, which it nearly resembled, only its head was much
                  bigger, and more wild and savage-like.</p>
               <p>"I took pity on the damp little cuss with such a human cry; stripped off my
                  match-coat; laid it, with the little beasty on top, near the fire, and commenced
                  my turkey. Had scarce time to choose between wing or drumstick, when I heerd a
                  rustle and a crackling noise right behind me, and on turning my face that-a-way,
                  saw the glaring eyes and savage head of a she 'painter.'</p>
               <p>"Lordy, but she was mad! Her eyes looked like glowing coals; her teeth like a
                  timber saw, and her tail was lashed and jerked about with a quick, quivery,
                  tremulous motion. I felt kind of numbed—couldn't budge a peg to save my life. She
                  didn't wait long on ceremony, I tell ye for true, but without saying 'by your
                  leave, sir,' she was on me in a moment, with a roar and a spring, knocking me
                  down, and giving me an ugly wipe of her paw as she passed; here's the scar of it
                  yet, right above the temple. But, Lordy bless you, lad, 'twasn't <emph>me</emph>
                  she wanted. She scattered the fire right and left, and made for her cub, which she
                  turned over and over, licking it and crooning over it in a loving, motherly sort
                  of a way."</p>
               <p>"By jove, Cap," interrupted the excited young lord, "you don't mean to
                  say?—-and—and what did you do then?"</p>
               <p>"Me? Oh, jiminy, what <emph>could</emph> I do? I didn't wait for any
                     <emph>second</emph> hint, I tell you. My gun was ten feet off, and any move for
                  it would have been death; so bidding her pouting ladyship a hurried but
                  affectionate good-bye, I squirmed over to the bank edge, and rolled over down to
                  the beach, where my canoe was fastened, gave it a shove, and was out in the
                  stream. 'Twas some little spell before I recovered, but on standing up, would you
                  believe it? I saw her catch her cub by the slack of the neck, as you would a
                  terrier dog, and make off with it into the bush.</p>
               <p>"Am ashamed to confess, I was so flustered and streaked like by this narrow
                  escape, I left my turkey, and without my gun, made straight back for Shingiss'
                  lodge. But hark! what's that? Sounds mighty like Scarooyaddy's barker. I can tell
                  its sharp, spiteful crack 'mid a thousand. Can't believe the wary chief would fire
                  off his piece right in an enemy's camp, 'less he was sore beset,'</p>

               <p>ALL now breathlessly turned eyes in the direction of the sound, when soon the
                  whole scene changed into one of intense action and excitement.</p>
               <p>First appeared on the bluff, at some distance above the fort, a gaunt and stalwart
                  figure, which Gist's party immediately recognized as that of Captain Jack, the
                  far-famed leader of the Juniata Free Rangers, known as the most rancorous Indian
                  hater, and the most desperate and relentless Indian fighter in all the
                  colonies.</p>
               <p>He paused but one moment to take in the situation, and then hurriedly leaping down
                  on the beach, hastily made for about twenty birch and pine canoes which were
                  crowded together, heads on the shingle. These, after first securing all the
                  paddles, he, one by one, with a single powerful push, sent darting out into the
                  current, save one long and shapely birch, which was retained.</p>
               <p>At one and the same moment almost, was heard the booming sound of a cannon from
                  the fort, and the noise of a desperate scuffle and angry exclamations from the
                  bank, when Scarooyaddy leaped over and down, closely followed by a powerful young
                  Ottawa chief. They clinched at once, but time was too vitally precious for "hands
                  off" in this conflict. Jack crunched down his rifle-butt on the young chief's
                  head, which the Half-King rapidly followed up by sinking his tomahawk into his
                  brain, and, with scalp lock in one hand, was proceeding to cut the usual horrid
                  circle, when thus Jack, angrily:</p>
               <p>"Art mad, chief?—stay not for the scalp, but jump into the canoe, quick! Ye've
                  done enough mischief already, and we'll have the whole howling pack of whites and
                  reds upon us in a twinkle. I've hunted, and trailed, and fought with ye for a ten
                  year, but never did I think so great and old a chief could do so fool a thing.
                  'Twould disgrace a boy. Not one word, but shove off and paddle for your life.
                  'Twill be a miracle if we escape with whole scalps to our heads. Heavens, see how
                  they crowd us! Bend to your paddles, chief! Here's no child's play."</p>
               <p>It was even so. They were now fairly fifty yards from shore, making rapidly across
                  the stream, under the most superhuman exertions. Indians by scores soon appeared
                  upon the bank, leaping, running to and fro, and crowding over upon the beach,
                  while a yell of baffled rage, and a cry for revenge arose from the whole crowd so
                  soon as they saw the dead body of their chief and all their canoes floating far
                  down the stream.</p>
               <p>Some hurled stones, others their tomahawks, while others still, shot their arrows
                  or discharged their rifles. At the same time the ball from a cannon whizzed past
                  and ricochetted on the water beyond, but the pursued looked<pb n="34-35"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000018"/> neither to right nor left, but desperately bent to
                  their task, plying their paddles in short, strong, nervous strokes till they
                  almost snapped to the strain.</p>
               <p>This terrible work soon told in favor of the fugitives, and although one arm of
                  our Indian was seen for a moment to suddenly relax its grasp of the paddle—a fact
                  which was announced with a loud yell from those on shore—the canoe still dashed
                  forward. They were no novices who impelled it.</p>
               <p>At this moment three canoes from the Allegheny, having two Indians each, shot
                  around the "point," and the batteaux and perogues gathered there, far out in the
                  stream, while two others came unexpectedly out from the <emph>opposite</emph>
                  bank, right in the course of Jack's, making directly for it. In the meantime,
                  Beaujeu, a leader of coolness and judgment, had come out of the fort, and gave
                  direction and effectiveness to the Indian movements on shore. Some were sent after
                  the floating canoes; others were dispatched up the Monongahela, to cross at
                  different points.</p>
               <p>The whole scene now became thrilling in the extreme. The ramparts of the fort were
                  crowded with soldiers and cadets; gun after gun was let off, waking the echoes of
                  the hills till the whole air was full of sound. The throngs of maddened Indians on
                  shore could scarcely contain themselves for rage and excitement. They leaped,
                  yelled, and rolled upon the ground and tore up the earth.</p>
               <p>The situation was, to the last degree, full of peril; and Jack and the Half-King
                  took it all in at a glance, but without losing a stroke, or uttering a word: only
                  this from Jack:</p>
               <p>"Chief, as you have but one arm, keep your rifle at hand: take no notice of the
                  rascals in front. Let them come close; try and push my rifle, with your foot, a
                  little towards me, and watch when I drop my paddle; then we'll seize our rifles
                  and shoot, you at the front Indian to the right, and I at the one on the left.
                  We're in the tightest strait we ever were yet, and we've seen some desperate times
                  together. So—now. I wont reproach you more, for 'tis your only folly. God alone
                  knows how 'twill end. If we can manage to wing the two in front, we needn't fear
                  those laggards in the rear. You used to be famous at throwing the tomahawk. You
                  have still your right hand. If you can make it tell, now, if ever's the time."</p>
               <p>The mortified chief still kept silence, but showed that he understood; and as the
                  two canoes in front neared them, he warily watched them, as well as Jack.</p>
               <p>"Now! <emph>now!</emph> chief," hissed out Jack, "let's give them of our very
                  best."</p>
               <p>All at once, both dropped their paddles and seized their trusty rifles, and two
                  reports rang out simultaneously on the air. It was neatly and dexterously done.
                  The Indian Jack aimed at was mortally wounded. His paddle dropped from his
                  nerveless hand; he wavered, sank, rose again, writhed, clutched the air, and then
                  fell heavily over the thwart of his canoe, upsetting it, as well as his companion,
                  who dived under and clung to the opposite side.</p>
               <p>The Half-King's shot was not so fortunate; it only struck the arm of the foremost
                  Indian, knocking his paddle high into the air: but no sooner was the bullet
                  fleshed, than it was followed by the unerring tomahawk, which finished the work.
                  Striking on the temple with full force, and with the butt end, he was felled like
                  an ox, and sank down with a thud into the bottom of the canoe, which stopped in
                  its course, and fell off.</p>
               <p>As soon as the effect of these shots were seen, Scarooyaddy raised himself to his
                  full height in the boat, turned towards the fort, and gave forth a most terrific
                  "scalp halloo"—a series of shrill, rapid, unearthly shrieks, like the wildest
                  laughs of a madman, which were as clear and distinct as the notes of a clarion,
                  and which reverberated from<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7175-00000019"/> hill to hill,
                  till they gradually died away far down the Ohio. It is difficult to describe the
                  prodigious effect which those fierce yells of contempt and defiance wrought on the
                  shore crowds, who, while the three boats neared each other, had been comparatively
                  still with anxiety and expectance.</p>
               <p>This stir was increased, if possible, by the sight of Lord Talbot on the height,
                  who, in the excitement of the moment, and wishing to see as much of the combat as
                  possible, had leaped nimbly upon the log, and stood clearly revealed against the
                  sky. He was seen by a score, and although immediately and impatiently pulled down
                  by Gist and Fairfax, it was too late, the mischief had been done.</p>
               <p>The crowds on the shore worked like a hill of ants. The fort guns still continued
                  to fire, their booming echoes chasing each other along the river hills with
                  thunderous reverberation, while in the intervals the air was filled with deafening
                  whoops, shrieks and yells. What a startling contrast to the brooding calm and hush
                  of a short half hour before! Some of the younger "braves" were actually beside
                  themselves, but under the direction of a French officer and the famed and active
                  Ottawa chief, Pontiac, they soon gathered their senses and began to display their
                  usual craft. They all seemed instinctively to know that both parties of scouts
                  came from Braddock's army. They <emph>could</emph> come from nowhere else. They
                  knew also by what route they would have to return, and prepared to intercept them.
                  Runners were seen to scatter in different directions. Large parties of fighting
                  men were distinctly visible creeping up the banks of the Monongahela, and
                  dispersing themselves in the woods, while still other parties—some new paddles
                  having been found—embarked in the canoes which had been hastily gathered, and
                  rapidly shot up the river.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile a few vigorous strokes sent Jack's canoe to land, the three pursuing
                  boats having by this time approached proached within a hundred yards, or so; but
                  the paddlers now stood idle, uncertain what course to pursue. The Half-King leaped
                  ashore, turned, and gave another parting yell of triumph and defiance, while Jack
                  seizing his long and ominous-looking rifle, hurriedly drove the bullet home, and
                  took careful aim at the foremost canoe. The Indian at its head saw the movement,
                  swayed, wriggled and at last sank down in the boat to avoid the shot; but the
                  bullet he missed, found rest in the body of the man behind him, who sent forth a
                  yell, tottered and fell headlong.</p>

               <p>THE other canoes stopped at once. The game was up. Indians never attack at a
                  disadvantage. Stratagem is their forte. They saw at a glance that several—they
                  knew not then exactly how many—armed and resolute men could hold the ravine, for
                  which the two were now rapidly heading, against a score, and silent and
                  crestfallen they turned their canoes up the stream, to come on their foes again at
                  a more favored time and locality.</p>
               <p>Captain Jack and the Half-King, panting and breathless, now slowly but steadily
                  climbed the hill, the fatigue and excitement they had lately undergone, as well as
                  the precipitous height, rendering rapid motion utterly impossible. They were met
                  near the summit by Gist's party, and congratulations, mingled with anxious
                  counsels, were interchanged. A look of extreme gravity was on Jack's face, while
                  Scarooyaddy—knowing his rashness to be the cause of all this danger to the whole
                  party—hung in the rear, his head bent in shame and confusion.</p>
               <p>"Well, Captain," laughed cheerily out the careless and volatile Talbot, "I give
                  you joy. I knew such a splendid and clean-limbed set of hunters as your rangers
                  wouldn't have you for a leader without a cause, but I didn't think there was so
                  much fight in you. Hurrah! By the long Harry, but you pinked that scaramouch in
                  the first canoe beautiful, and so sudden, too. He was coming slyly down on you,
                  evidently thinking you didn't see him, and that he'd have it all his own way; and
                  the other big devil. Did you see how he danced, and pranced, and wriggled, and
                  twisted? But the cunning rascal made his point after all, while the sour, solemn
                  old fool behind him got it bad. He dropped like a bag o' meal. By Jove, haven't we
                  all had a most happy escape?"</p>
               <p>A sad kind of smile broke over Jack's swarthy visage.</p>
               <p>"Escape, did you say? Why, foolish boy, the danger's but just commenced. How are
                  we, think you, ever to get back to Braddock? The whole distance will be, in a
                  couple of hours, swarming with savages, and we'll have to run a far more
                  formidable gauntlet than ever did Indians going to the stake. We're not safe here
                  a half hour. If you've never yet made your will, my lord, 'tis a sad oversight.
                  'Twill need all the skill and wit you have to keep your fine hair on your
                  head."</p>
               <p>"How did all this occur?" broke in Gist.</p>
               <p>"Ask the Half-King, yonder," replied Jack. "However, I haven't a mind to scold him
                  more. He's a heart of oak. He never yet has flinched; besides, see how chagrined
                  he looks; and he's been punished, too; I don't yet know how
                     badly—<emph>wont</emph> know till I examine for myself. It must be confessed,
                  also, the temptation was strong. We had about finished our scout, and were getting
                  back to our boat, when we came upon a French officer out so early hunting
                  squirrels.</p>
               <p>"We would have avoided him, but the Half-King catching a glance of his face, saw
                  in him an officer of the fort who last year threatened to hang him up and lash<pb
                     n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7175-00000021"/> him bare-backed because he vainly tried
                  to win back some of his rebellious people to their loyalty. 'Tis an affront an
                  Indian chief can neither brook nor forgive, and so, on the spur of the moment, he
                  fired, brought down his man, and his insulter's scalp now garnishes his
                  girdle.</p>
               <p>"But what's to be done, Gist?" anxiously continued Jack. "<emph>My</emph> course
                  is plain. While <emph>your</emph> party had better keep straight back into the
                  forest, wait for night and work cautiously back to the army, the Half-King and I
                  must cross by the fort again, and visit a party we met on that side last night,
                  and of whom only we two know, and whom we <emph>must</emph> see again. Said I not
                  right, Scarooyaddy?"</p>
               <p>"The Half-King stays by his brave brother, The Black Rifle," was all the
                  response.</p>
               <p>"Either path is beset with dangers, but I have others besides myself to think of
                  now," exclaimed Jack, in an anxious and softened manner.</p>
               <p>"Captain Jack," suddenly spoke Talbot, "I know you to be a brave and I believe you
                  to be a loyal man; but, yet, when I think of your being a <emph>volunteer</emph>
                  on this scout, I trust—I hope your strange return to an enemy's camp means no
                  damage to his majesty's service. Braddock himself charged me—"</p>
               <p>"Silence, rash boy!" angrily answered Gist, for Jack haughtily disdained any
                  reply. "Think you, the late deaths of white and red chiefs will make warm welcome
                  for <emph>them</emph> at the fort? Traitors in our woods are, happily, as scarce
                  as British lords. <emph>I'll</emph> answer for Jack's loyalty <emph>with my
                     life.</emph> Aught else is not only an insult to the bravest ranger on the
                  King's side, but to <emph>all</emph> of us. His secret's his own. Let us respect
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Here, then, Gist," calmly replied Jack, "let us part. You and Fairfax take
                  counsel together,—but, hold, we'll walk all in a row along this hill cope where
                  there are no trees, so that we may be seen by the watchers at the fort going up
                  the river toward Braddock. So—now, hopes for an early meeting. The Half-King and I
                  go first down the bank a couple of miles to call on Shingiss, king of the
                  Delawares. After that, you'll hear from us. Come, Chief, if you're ready, let's
                  step out."</p>

               <p>BEHOLD Braddock's scouting party happily re-united on the brow of Coal Hill,
                  opposite Fort Duquesne: Gist, Talbot, and Fairfax the Delaware Chief, to work in a
                  circuit back to the army, in order to escape a swarm of Indian out-lyers, and
                  Captain Jack and the Half-King to go down shore to the lodge of Shingiss, king of
                  the Delawares, thence to return to the fort side of the river, for some mysterious
                  purpose of their own.</p>
               <p>Be it our business, now, to throw light on this mystery, for it is a most
                  important part of our story.</p>
               <p>Braddock's army was, "like a wounded snake dragging its slow length along," making
                  from four to six miles a day, stopping, as Washington disgustfully expressed it,
                  "to bridge every rivulet, and level every mole-hill."</p>
               <p>No wonder, then, that it was the last of June when the Yochiogheny was passed, at
                  a point near the present town of Connellsville, and that it was on the 3d of July
                  when Jacob's Creek was reached, near where now stands Mt. Pleasant.</p>
               <p>Here it was that our scouts left the army on their mission to Fort Duquesne.
                  Descending the creek to the "Yoch," and having there fashioned a birch canoe, they
                  proceeded down to the Monongahela, bringing up at John Frazier's—a venturesome
                  Scotch gunsmith and noted Indian trader, who had the audacity to locate his little
                  cabin—the most western English habitation across the Alleghenies—near the mouth of
                  Turtle Creek, and who was now serving as lieutenant with Braddock.</p>
               <p>Across from this house, the party divided, just at the gloam of the evening, Gist
                  and his companions proceeding, as related, along Coal Hill, and Jack and the
                  Half-King leisurely descending the river, designing to arrive at the fort when all
                  were wrapped in sleep, and ascertain its condition for defence, and the number of
                  Indians assembled.</p>
               <p>The night was yet young, and having abundance of time, and yielding, perhaps, to
                  the influences of the beautiful scenery around them, the paddles dropped from the
                  hands of both occupants of the light and graceful birch, which, under their
                  skilful and vigorous strokes, had danced over the water "like a thing of
                  life."</p>
               <p>The shades of night, with all its weird and magical witcheries, had gradually
                  stolen over the landscape. The voices of birds were hushed, save the plaintive
                  notes of the whip-poor-will, or the occasional tremulous cries of the loon, while
                  the waters were unruffled except, ever and anon, by the plash of some fish, as it
                  sportively or in pursuit of its prey threw itself from the placid stream.</p>
               <p>Soon the moon, "pale regent of the sky," cast its flickering<pb n="44-45"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000023"/> ering beams over wood and water, diffusing, as it
                  rose higher and higher, a flood of mellow, tremulous light over hill and dale,
                  plain and river; marking the one margin of the water with a line of deep shadow;
                  shedding its soft, lambent rays over the other, and lighting up with its silver
                  sheen the waters flowing between.</p>
               <p>It was a scene of bewildering beauty and enchantment, made more solemn and
                  impressive by the holy hush of all nature, and the solitude of the vast
                  wilderness; and persons far less cultivated or susceptible than these simple
                  canoemen, would have been wooed to quiet and pensiveness by the stillness and the
                  weird associations of the hour. While thus they brood, let us portray them.</p>
               <p>The swarthy, sinewy, stern-looking man who sat at the rear, his paddle dipping
                  idly in the water, and an earnest, almost wistful gaze thrown on either reach of
                  shore, was the far-famed scout and Indian-killer, Captain Jack; as Well known
                  along the whole frontier line of Pennsylvania and Virginia, as was Major
                  Washington himself. The mystery surrounding his origin and life, and the swart
                  complexion which gave him the look and name of the Half-Indian, added to his fame.
                  It was generally said he was a frontier settler who returned from a long day's
                  chase, only to find his cabin a ruin, and the butchered and scalped forms of those
                  most dear to him, strewn around.</p>
               <p>From that time, revenge became his all-absorbing passion, and hunting Indians his
                  life-business, until he had become as much a terror to the savage tribes as a
                  tower of strength to the white settler. He became noted for his reckless daring,
                  his unerring aim, his skill in woodcraft, the sleuth-hound tenacity with which he
                  could follow a trail, till it ended in the very camps of his hated foes.</p>
               <p>In 1753, Jack held some commission under Governor Hamilton, and soon became the
                  leader of a party of bold and dashing rangers, clad, like himself, in Indian
                  attire. His home was in the Juniata Valley, where even to this day a mountain
                  bears his name, but his <emph>habitat</emph> was along the entire Susquehanna,
                  from Fort Augusta to the Potomac.</p>
               <p>In those cruel times of bloody warfare, when the pitiless tomahawk bore sway, he
                  lived in many a fireside legend, and his name was potent enough to lull to sleep
                  the restless infant in many a pioneer's cabin. Innumerable were the tales related
                  of the Black Rifle, the Black Hunter of the Forest, and the Wild Hunter of the
                  Juniata—for by all those names was he called.</p>
               <p>Early in June, Jack, with his trained band of rangers, had repaired to Braddock's
                  camp, and offered their services as scouts, stipulating only, that they should not
                  be bound to camp or march regulations, but should eat, sleep, dress, hunt, and
                  scout as they pleased. To this, Braddock, with that martinet fatuity which
                  attended his every step in this country, turned a deaf ear.</p>
               <p>Captain Jack, however, was too fond of adventure to be thus easily driven off;
                  besides, was he not on the track of the very tribe from which he had so terribly
                  suffered? He therefore, relegating, for a time, his gallant band of free rangers
                  to the next in command, followed, or rather preceded the army as volunteer guide,
                  and hastened to attach himself to the first and <emph>only</emph> scout which
                  Braddock ever sent out; and as he now neared the hated Delawares, his keen, gray
                  eye grew brighter and fiercer, and his whole manner became more restless and
                  impatient.</p>
               <p>Still a rather young and handsome man, though the lines of his face had become
                  hard, and his whole look stern and determined, from the fixedness of a set
                  purpose. An all-absorbing passion does not tend to give grace to the visage, or
                  suavity to the manner, and therefore Jack was deemed stern, austere, and
                  unsociable to those who knew him not;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7175-00000024"/> but
                  he had his moods, and there were favored times when this unrecking, self-contained
                  man, could be as tender as a woman: when his eye would soften, and his tongue
                  loosen. His intimates hinted at some early heart disappointment which had driven
                  him from society to the frontier; certain is it, he had, with all his bluntness
                  and severity, an air of refinement, and a mode of speech not common to the
                  backwoods.</p>
               <p>Lithe, graceful, and yet tall of form, without one ounce of superfluous flesh, his
                  nerves like steel, and his muscles like whip-cords, he was one to compel attention
                  and respect. His dress was simple, though not inelegant, and was altogether suited
                  to the free forest, life he delighted to lead—half Indian, half ranger. His
                  moccasins were more profusely beaded and quilled than common; his deerskin
                  leggings better dressed and more deeply fringed, and his tight-fitting tunic
                  buttoned with a row of wolves' teeth. A becoming cap, of grey-fox skin, with the
                  tail hanging over the neck, completed the costume of one who seemed born for the
                  woods, and whom we acknowledge as the hero of our story. (See <hi rend="i"
                  />Appendix E.)</p>
               <p>As for ornaments, save a richly-decked hunter's knife, a beaded bullet-pouch, and
                  a brass-studded powder horn, he had none, and needed none. His trusty rifle, long,
                  black, and ominous-looking, lay against one of the thwarts of the canoe, ready for
                  instant service. It may well be supposed, that depending on this weapon not only
                  for his living and his protection, but as the instrument of his revenge, he was
                  its master. Many a lurking foe had been sought out by its unerring bullet. It had
                  given him his most common name among the Indians, and La Carrabine Noir, or The
                  Black Rifle, was as well known to the Cauhnewagas of Canada, and the Ottowas about
                  the big lakes, as to the Delawares and Shawnees along the Ohio.</p>
               <p>His companion, with body at rest, still as that summer evening, but with gleaming,
                  searching eye noting every bending willow, and every slightest reach of either
                  shore, was not only a <emph>full</emph>-blooded, but a <emph>noble</emph>-blooded
                  Indian Chief, Scarooyaddy called by some, and Monecatootha by others.</p>
               <p>A true child of the woods, he; cradled amid its babbling brooks, its rustling
                  leaves, its twining vines, and its changing flowers. He knew all nature's moods
                  and seasons; all the habits of its animals, and how readiest to kill or entrap
                  them; knew all the Indian trails and wiles, and the various signs and devices
                  which taught him how best to avoid, pursue, deceive, and conquer. This had been
                  his life for over fifty years, and there was little in wilderness wood-craft or in
                  savage war-craft he did not know.</p>
               <p>No name stands higher, or is mentioned more frequently in our Colonial records and
                  State archives than that of Scarooyaddy, the Half-King of the Iroquois. His
                  services to the English dated from his attendance on Major Washington, on the
                  mission to French Creek, set afoot by Governor Dinwiddie, of Virginia, and were
                  continued all through Braddock's and Forbes' Expeditions. He was ever unswerving
                  in loyalty and unmatched for boldness and energy. He was the most noted of the
                  seven Indians who accompanied Braddock to the fatal field, and was publicly
                  thanked by Governor Morris and the Pennsylvania Assembly for his services.</p>
               <p>His dress and trappings scarce require special mention. They differed only from
                  Jack's in being more Indian in character. His leggings were tufted with scalp
                  hairs instead of fringe, and his scalp lock—that open challenge and defiance to an
                  enemy—was drawn back in a single line, and crested with Eagle feathers, tricked
                  out on the sides with the gayer plumage of the Jay. Altogether, the old Half-King
                  was as noble and dangerous-looking a savage as any<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000025"/> foe would care to meet on a trail; active as cat
                  and supple as serpent, every look and motion was full of life and native grace. It
                  need only be added that he understood and talked English pretty well, and was a
                  fast friend and great admirer of Captain Jack. (See <hi rend="i"/>Appendix F.)</p>

               <p>AFTER floating and paddling along in silence for some time, Jack thus addressed
                  his long-time friend and companion, in the Indian dialect, which we freely
                  translate for the benefit of our readers, preserving the idiom:—</p>
               <p>"And how long, think ye, Chief, are we from the De-un-da-ga?" (the forks of the
                  Ohio, so called by all the Indians). "Now that we are not specially after scalps,
                  'twould be more healthy for us to get to the fort after your kith and kin are dead
                  in sleep, else we'll have trouble in counting heads, even should we escape having
                  our back hair twigged. It's been many moons, Yaddy, since we've been on the trail
                  together, and it kind of goes against my grain to hunt savages up to their very
                  lair, only to bid them a good evening, and see whether they have bear or buck
                  boiling in their camp kettles."</p>
               <p>"Well, Captain, if I know anything of signs, hereabout,<pb n="50-51"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000026"/> 'tis but a short hour's paddle until our canoe is
                  laid along the palisades of the fort. But we must be wise as serpents, and not
                  like young braves on their first war-path. You know the great White Chief bade us
                  open our eyes and ears, but close our memories."</p>
               <p>"Great White Fiddlesticks, Chief, say I—a ridiculous old popinjay, and
                  drill-sergeant rather, with his facings and starchings, his frills and ruffles,
                  and his flummeries and mummeries. Ever since his gouty toes have trodden our
                  country, he has done nothing but scold, and strut and swear at our native troops
                  and riflemen. <emph>He'd</emph> teach us how to fight savages. <emph>He</emph>
                  don't want, forsooth, wood-rangers nor trained Indian fighters—every mother's son
                  of whom could bore out a squirrel's eye from an oak's topmost bough, or better
                  still, pick off a redskin if he only saw the white of a peeper—but. he would rout,
                  and crush the reds by noise and flare of drum, the glisten of bayonets, the polish
                  of boots and brass buttons, and the manœuvres of a ballroom."</p>
               <p>"My young white brother," quietly interposed the Half-King, "has his ears stuffed
                  with cotton when the old Chief is mentioned. He has fought many great battles over
                  the big waters."</p>
               <p>"Bah, Chief, you know better! I tell you, were it not for Washington and the
                  colonial riflemen, I wouldn't give a Delaware's chance before this rifle, for all
                  King George's army. You know how he insulted and drove off my hunters, every one
                  of whom has treed and shot and scalped his foe, and could hit a 'painter's' eye,
                  even when on the bound, at a hundred paces. So help me—But listen! what strange
                  noise is that? As I live, Chief, it sounds like music, and yet music in this
                  solitude—impossible."</p>
               <p>The light birch was stilled with a motion, and with paddles poised in hand, the
                  two stood to their feet, every sense on the alert; the ears strained to catch the
                  soft sounds of music—for music it was—which stole in gentle pulses over the water,
                  now rising to a rich fulness and now dying away into the distance, with cadences
                  so soft and trills so gentle, that nothing scarce could live between them and
                  silence.</p>
               <p>Almost breathless Jack leaned forward, his eyes in amaze and his whole mien
                  softened.</p>
               <p>"Do my ears deceive me, Chief? Is this spirit land? Frazier is away with the army,
                  and Frazier can make guns, and shoot them, too, but he can't make music like that.
                  Who and what can it ever be? If I were not where I am, my old friend, I would say
                  those were the notes of a magic flute, and played, too, with a master touch, by
                  one who knows well all the stops and humors of his instrument.</p>
               <p>"Ah, well-a-day," softly continued Jack, after an attentive silence, "those sweet,
                  plaintive notes carry me back to the days of my youth, when I lived in the great
                  city, and when my eyes and ears, yes, and heart too, had not become accustomed to
                  the rude encounters and bloody struggles of a frontier life.</p>
               <p>"But we must not stay musing, and dreaming here, Chief, for I see that you, too,
                  who know nothing of music but the Seneca's drum, or Braddock's bugles, are dazed
                  by those soft melodies. I ne'er knew but one who could breathe forth such witching
                  strains, and he, alas, if not now dead, is far removed from this leafy wilderness.
                  Turn the prow to yonder broken line of willows, which marks the mouth of some run,
                  and we'll soon know whether these be spirit melodies or no."</p>
               <p>A motion or two, and the canoe gently glided into a little cove overhung by
                  arching willows, and rifle at rest, the two scouts, with cat-like tread and eyes
                  peering into every tuft and hummock and shadow, mounted the bank and hastily
                  advanced toward a widening ravine, in which the light of a fire, glowing upon the
                  sorrounding foliage, was now distinctly visible.</p>
               <pb n="52" xml:id="VAC7175-00000027"/>
               <p>The flute, or whatever was the instrument, was now mute, and as the two intruders
                  glided forward from tree to tree, all at once a merry, ringing peal of laughter,
                  clear and silvery as a bell, and evidently from one of the gentler sex, awakened
                  the echoes of the forest, and came wafted to them like a stream of rich melody,
                  from a sort of bark-covered hut, or rather bower, a little aside from the
                  direction in which they were looking, causing a thrill and shudder to creep over
                  Captain Jack's person. He seemed, all at once, overcome with some mysterious
                  emotion, and grasped his companion's arm with such a convulsive and vice-like
                  grip, that the Indian, stoical as he was by nature and education, fairly winced,
                  as much with the pain as with the unaccountable suddenness of the apparently
                  unfriendly grapple.</p>
               <p>"By the Great Spirit above us, Jack!" hissed the Half-King, with gleaming eyes,
                  "do you take me for a Delaware, or an Ottowa, that you give me this rude bear's
                  hug? Art mad, brother? Hands off, I say, or I'll think the spirit of these woods,
                  which has just befooled us both, has completely stolen away your senses. If we
                  don't act less like that merry maiden, whose laugh is like the warble of a
                  wood-thrush, our scalps will to-night deck old Shingiss' wigwam, and be dressed by
                  his squaws. What has come over you?"</p>
               <p>"Hist! Chief, speak lower, and forgive me. I was o'er-mastered by—I know not
                  what—a note, a voice, a memory of the past 'Tis wondrous strange, but suspense is
                  worse than death. I <emph>must</emph> unravel this mystery to its very end. Keep
                  within the shadow of yonder huge buttonwoods; stay near me, and forward!"</p>
               <p>They glided on and on like shadows, until they stood together fairly on the edge
                  of the circle lit up by the fire, and their startled, wondering eyes gradually
                  took in the salient points of the strange scene.</p>

               <p>IMAGINE to yourself, reader, a ravine, skirted on either side by precipitous
                  hills, feathered to their tops with a luxuriant foliage; on the wide and perfectly
                  level bottom, a grove of sugar-maples, with no undergrowth of bush or shrub, or
                  tangled vine, but a bright carpet of green, on one side of which, and hugging the
                  hill in a graceful curve, a rapid, babbling little stream rippled and murmured its
                  blithesome way to the Monongahela. The grove, judging<pb n="54-55"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000029"/> from the rude bark vessels at the maples' trunks,
                  was an old Indian sugar camp.</p>
               <p>Right on the stream's margin, was a blazing log-fire, its flickering flames ever
                  and anon bursting into flashing jets, and brighter lights, and throwing the
                  surrounding scenery, as well as the overarching foliage, now into light, and now
                  into shadow.</p>
               <p>On a fallen tree trunk, some little distance beyond the fire, its flames clearly
                  lighting up each form, and relieving it against the deep darkness beyond, sat a
                  party of three; the central figure, and the one just now breathing again into his
                  flute, and drawing forth its softest melodies, was a venerable, white-haired old
                  man, with an appearance of unusual refinement, and a countenance of singular
                  gentleness and delicacy—the very last figure one would expect to see in such a
                  place. With his snowy and wavy beard, he looked like a patriarch of old.</p>
               <p>But the accessories of this scene served but to increase the mystery. On the one
                  side of the flute player sat a welldressed, and gentlemanly-looking French officer
                  of somewhat uncertain age, while on the other, was a dusky and swarthy savage,
                  with a milder and more intelligent face than usual with Indians; while reclining
                  on the grass in front, was a fiercer and younger-looking Chief, who occasionally
                  cast stolen glances towards the bower.</p>
               <p>All were gazing earnestly at the noble-looking old gentleman, and apparently
                  drinking in with rapture each dulcet note as thrown off by his fingers. The Indian
                  Chiefs were both in their war garb, their scalp-locks all newly dressed with
                  feathers and their faces barred with colors.</p>
               <p>To complete the picturesque scene, a white horse, hobbled, stood half in light and
                  half in shadow, munching the velvety grass. The whole made a picture worthy of
                  Rembrandt, and one which we in vain essay to depict. It seemed like some wild
                  Gypsy grouping.</p>
               <p>The Half-King was the first to recover both his senses, and his voice, for Jack
                  stood still, leaning heavily against his tree and fetching deep and hurried
                  breaths, occasionally glancing uneasily and expectantly toward the woman's bower,
                  as if he waited some apparition to come thence.</p>
               <p>A bright gleam of intelligence broke over the Half-King's face, and touching Jack,
                  he whispered:</p>
               <p>"Scarooyaddy sees and understands it all. The old man with silver locks, I know
                  not, but the white Chief is de Beaujeu, commandant of the fort; the great red
                  Chief at the other side is Athanase, the Christian Mohawk from Canada, and leader
                  of all the Indian forces now about the fort; the other Chief is a great warrior
                  from my own tribe, and went with Washington, Gist, Tannecharison and myself to
                  Wenango in '53. He's a great hunter, and 'brave.' <emph>We</emph> call him
                  Kiosola, but he's known in the settlements as Guyasutha. They all come up from the
                  fort; will be going back soon, and 'twould be wise if we would ambush them."</p>
               <p>"Stay! not so, Chief," answered Jack, looking much relieved, and gradually coming
                  to himself again, "I have far other business in view. <emph>I</emph> begin to
                  understand, too, though there is much yet that appears strange and unaccountable
                  to me. I know, or <emph>did once</emph> know the old man well,
                     <emph>exceeding</emph> well, and a better, or a purer creature was never
                  fashioned by the Great Spirit. I thank God that I see him once more—I thought him
                  dead. Stir not for your life, while I steal to yonder bower to complete my
                  knowledge. I <emph>will</emph> know the worst, or—best."</p>
               <p>So saying, Jack—though in great agitation—glided stealthily along until he stood
                  at the back of the little open hut, and peering through some fragrant pine
                  branches which formed one side of this fragile summer enclosure, his eyes were
                  soon masters of its contents.</p>
               <p>Here is what he, with varying and conflicting emotions, beheld:</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7175-00000030"/>
               <p>A lady of a bright, intelligent, and expressive face; not, reader, as the
                  sentimentalist would say, "of alabaster brow, ruby lips, a face of Grecian
                  contour, and teeth like two rows of snowy pearls," but a mature, and real
                  flesh-and-blood woman, with a sparkling eye, and a shapely head, around which was
                  simply massed and fastened by a single comb, a wealth of dark, wavy brown
                  hair.</p>
               <p>She was sitting on a sort of camp stool, with a rudely-fashioned painter's easel
                  before her; a palette of water colors in one hand, while the other transferred to
                  the paper the shifting, shimmering glows and tints from the neck of a wild pigeon,
                  which was placed on a twig at her side in a life-like position, as if the bird had
                  just lighted for an instant before taking a new flight.</p>
               <p>Not so intent on her pleasing task but time was found to bandy phrases and
                  exchange repartees in French with a bold and dashing-looking officer from the
                  fort, who reclined near her on a bear skin, toying with the plumage of an
                  osprey—which was waiting its turn to be portrayed—a shade of sadness on his manly
                  face, and a touch of tenderness in his tones.</p>
               <p>Near both, and engaged in quilling a moccasin—strange sight in such a place—sat a
                  young, and very beautiful Indian girl of apparently some fifteen or sixteen years,
                  with little moccasined feet, ornamented leggings, short embroidered skirt, and a
                  gay kerchief over her bosom. Her hair, though of raven black, was finer and softer
                  than usual with Indians. Her face was of clear color, and singularly delicate and
                  refined for one so born and nurtured, and a pensiveness even amounting to sadness,
                  lent an unusual grace and interest. Occasionally her dark, lustrous eyes would
                  lift towards the others, and a bright smile of affection light up her soft, young
                  countenance, and she would seem to draw nearer to her only female companion,
                  attent on every word she uttered.</p>
               <p>The older lady would have attracted attention anywhere, not so much from the
                  regularity of her features as from the spirit and expression which played about
                  them, and the symmetry and gracefulness of her person. Her face was one which
                  "lighted up well," and which responded to every passing thought and emotion. She
                  had that ever-changeful and never-dying charm of expression which neither years,
                  nor suffering, nor disappointment can destroy, and which outlives all beauty of
                  mere feature or complexion.</p>
               <p>Totally unconscious of the ardent, bewildered gaze of any bold intruder, she sat
                  in a perfectly free and unconstrained posture, her little moccasined foot
                  advanced, and her whole carriage one of grace and <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >abandon</foreign>—evidently a person of gentleness and refinement, and so much
                  the more difficult to harmonize with her rude, but exceedingly picturesque
                  surroundings.</p>
               <p>Her dress, too, was one well calculated to set off her superb figure, and to
                  increase the charm of her presence. Like her young companion—to whom she ever and
                  anon cast pleasant and loving glances—she wore the quill and bead moccasin, ending
                  in a beautifully ornamented buskin, while her dress was more like a tunic, only
                  longer and of a finer material, and fastened by a silken sash about the waist.</p>
               <p>The upper portion of her person was enclosed in a richly-embroidered jacket,
                  closely fashioned to her figure. Her throat—which was of an exquisite shape—was
                  bared and devoid of ornament, the lower portion only encased in a little lace
                  ruff. She was many years older than the young Indian girl beside her, and yet her
                  eye had such a brightness in it, and her face such a flush of health and color,
                  that this could only gradually be learned.</p>
               <p>Altogether a wondrous grouping for a Western wilderness, and so thought Jack, as
                  his bosom heaved tumultuously<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7175-00000031"/> ously, and
                  the fierce light came and went into his eyes. His fingers occasionally clutched
                  his tomahawk, and a quiver went over his manly form, when, after a brief and
                  rather low conversation in French between the lady and the officer, their voices
                  arose in unison in a soft duet, still in the same foreign language.</p>
               <p>Then Jack was fairly beside himself. He seemed impatient of all restraint, and,
                  had it not been for the Half-King's whispered but earnest words of caution, he
                  would have broken through the slight intervening obstacles and burst into the
                  lady's presence. What he would have said and done can only be surmised from the
                  sequel.</p>

               <p>HE had not, however, long to wait. Footsteps and voices were heard approaching.
                  The venerable form of the old gentleman appeared in the open doorway, and said in
                  French:</p>
               <p>"Eh, bien, Monsieur le Capitaine Dumas, you must not deem me rude if I interrupt
                  your and Marie's mournful song. De Beaujeu and the Chiefs have tired of my poor
                  music, and gone to the fort, and bade me tell you they would await you at the
                  first bend of the river below."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Monsieur de Bonneville, and is it then so late? Mon Dieu," rising as he
                  spoke, "you must not blame us poor imprisoned officers if, when once we find
                  gentle ladies in these savage wilds, we take little note of time. I have been
                  trying to persuade your daughter, now that our runners tell us Braddock is drawing
                  near, to take refuge in the fort. Believe me, Monsieur, in case we resolve to
                  oppose le General Braddock, the fierce struggles which must shortly ensue in these
                  woods, make it an unfit place for such as these," pointing to the two maidens.</p>
               <p>I have been thinking much of this, Captain," replied the fond father, in low, but
                  earnest tones; "and yet have been treated by you, and your fierce Indians from
                     so<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7175-00000032"/> many different tribes, with such
                  marked respect and kindness, that we could scarce expect less from our own friends
                  who are approaching."</p>
               <p>"But, Monsieur, war is now fairly broken out between us and the English—if not in
                  name, yet in deed; soon the British advance will be along the river, for we think
                  they <emph>must</emph> come this way. We can scarcely hope, with our inferior
                  numbers, and with only a mob of untrained savages, to oppose them short of the
                  fort, even if we can stand there, and you and Marie were safer with us. Promise me
                  to think of this, Monsieur."</p>
               <p>"I do, and when next you come, will have resolved. Good-night, and <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">bon voyage</foreign> to you, Captain."</p>
               <p>Turning to the girls, who were tidying up the hut, he continued in English:</p>
               <p>"Marie, love, I feel unusually sad this evening, and must retire. The wood notes
                  of our forest home seem especially mournful to-night. Even the cricket and
                  tree-frogs have a sort of dismal croak, while that owl from the hillside beyond
                  the run, keeps up a most doleful plaint. Do you and Wau-ki-na retire, while I go
                  and arrange the fire and kettle, and take old Dobbin and hobble him in a new
                  pasture."</p>
               <p>Out again into the grove, and now Jack's time had come at last. Gliding around to
                  the opening of the little cabin; anxious, faltering, but soon resolved, he gave
                  forth a low, and very peculiar whistle.</p>
               <p>Marie sprang up as if it had been the warning rattle of a snake—evidently a
                  familiar and yet incredible sound. Her color fast came and went. She had a
                  startled and troubled air; a crimson flush mantled her cheeks. She stood
                  attentive, anxious, distressed; hoping, may be, yet fearing.</p>
               <p>Again the low signal whistle, and Jack's tall, stalwart form filled the doorway.
                  Marie shrank back with a shudder der, and a low moan of affright. The Indian girl
                  retreated to the other room, for the hut was divided into two simple
                  apartments.</p>
               <p>Their eyes met. Marie's gaze was long, earnest, fearful, as if painfully tracing
                  out features once familiar, and yet very, very greatly changed.</p>
               <p>At last, she murmured, shrinkingly, timorously, but inquiringly, and with a
                  certain daze in her face:</p>
               <p>"Edward? it cannot be; and yet, and yet—"</p>
               <p>"Edward it is, Marie, but not the mere boy you knew ten years ago, but a
                     <emph>man</emph>—matured—full-grown—one who has much suffered, too, but who
                  never expected to see Marie de Bonneville again—at least in <emph>this</emph>
                  world."</p>
               <p>But Marie heard no longer—not even so long. This unlooked-for apparition of the
                  past, coming out of the darkness she knew not how, and from some place she knew
                  not where, was too much for the poor girl, and she first shook like an aspen, and
                  then swooned to the earth.</p>
               <p>"Why, Marie!" exclaimed Jack, hastening towards her, the utmost alarm and anxiety
                  depicted on his face," it is I—the same Edward you once knew so well, in the very
                  flesh and blood. Come! come! look up, and rise, Marie; rise, I beseech you! I was
                  an unmannered boor to come on ye so sudden. What have I done? Here, you—you Indian
                  girl, come to the lady's aid, do you hear? quick! quick!"</p>
               <p>Out sprang the young "Indian girl," her black hair dishevelled, her eyes aflame,
                  as she boldly and with vehement gesture reproached the rash intruder.</p>
               <p>"Ah, you! What for you kill the good, sweet lady? Wau-ki-na saw you and heard you.
                  You very, very bad, cruel 'pale face;' worse than Mingo, you"—but as her flashing
                  eyes met the anxious, puzzled, distressful gaze of Jack, she started, and qualied
                  as if overcome with some memory, averted her looks, and sank to the ground be<pb
                     n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7175-00000033"/> side her companion, her young arms
                  twining about her form.</p>
               <p>Marie soon regained her consciousness, sighed, and cast a shy, bewildered glance
                  around, until her eyes again met those of Jack, and a shudder convulsed her form.
                  At last she managed to murmur, her syllables falling slowly, one by one, as if it
                  pained her to utter them.</p>
               <p>"Is—it—really—a—dream,—or—<emph>can</emph>—you—be—Edward—Percy, my earliest friend
                  and companion in times long past?"</p>
               <p>Her face flushed, and her maidenly modesty took alarm at his presence there and
                  thus, and the seeming familiarity of calling this strong, stern, swarthy-looking
                  man of apparently thirty-five, by his Christian name.</p>
               <p>"Marie!" tremulously spake Jack, "I say again it is Edward Percy; but he was mad
                  to so take you at unawares. Forgive him, will—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, <emph>that voice again!</emph> It must, it <emph>must</emph> be Edward; and
                  yet—and yet—oh, Edward!" looking at him timidly, searchingly, and with clasped
                  hands, "why <emph>did</emph> you all leave Philadelphia and us so abruptly,
                  without one word or message? It was cruel, cruel in you. Where are your dear
                  mother and sisters, and where have <emph>you</emph> been these many, many long
                  years?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Marie, that were a long and sad story to tell. My reason for leaving with my
                  mother's family for the West need not now or here be told, if, indeed,
                     <emph>you</emph> cannot guess it better than all others. But enough. I took
                  them to the banks of the Susquehanna. I there built us a cabin, made a clearing,
                  turned to a hunter-farmer, and was soon learning to forget the past, when, one
                  day, after a long and fatiguing hunt after a stag, I returned to find my little
                  cabin a smouldering ruin, everything burnt to the ground, stock driven off,
                  nothing—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, merciful heaven! And your good mother, and Emma, and little toddling
                  Lucy?"</p>
               <p>"Gone, all gone; not a trace of them to be seen," almost convulsively replied
                  Jack, his hands nervously clutching his rifle, and the old fierceness returning to
                  his eyes and the hardness to his voice.</p>
               <p>"But—they had only fled to the woods—you surely found them again—I shall soon see
                  them—they are with you <emph>now,</emph> and <emph>here,</emph> are they not?"
                  hurriedly queried Marie, with increasing excitement, and with her earnest,
                  questioning eyes fastened on his, as if fearing to hear more.</p>
               <p>"Never in <emph>this</emph> world, Marie: I hope so in a better; but I cannot,
                  dare not dwell on the harrowing scene which next met my eyes. I had scarce
                  followed the track of the savages to the edge of the woods, before I saw the
                  mutilated remains of my dear, gentle mother; I might almost say <emph>our</emph>
                  gentle mother, Marie; a little further on—oh, horror—I came on Emma, faint,
                  bleeding, and kneeling against a tree, her head hacked in a manner too sickening
                  to describe. She had only time to answer my inquiring glance by pointing to the
                  woods, before she expired. I rushed forward after my pet, my darling sister Lucy,
                  and—"</p>
               <p>"Lucy, Lucy," softly repeated Wau-ki-na, as if dreamily going over to herself a
                  name she had once heard but lost.</p>
               <p>The eyes of Jack and Marie both turned quickly towards her, but she was bent over
                  her beads, whispering to herself.</p>
               <p>"You had better, dear Wau-ki-na, go to your couch," Marie gently spoke; "this is
                  an old, old acquaintance, and we would speak together."</p>
               <p>The young Indian maiden slowly retired, a troubled expression on her brow, and
                  casting a lingering gaze, first at Marie, and then at the mysterious stranger.</p>
               <p>"Soon," continued Jack, "I came upon a little ribbon<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000034"/> that used to band her dark tresses; a little
                  further, her tiny shoe; still further on, a lock of her wavy hair, and a mile or
                  so away, alas! I saw the marks of blood oak the leaves, and of struggle,
                  and—and—but I can say no more," and here the strong man's eyes filled with tears,
                  and his broad and brawny breast sobbed convulsively. He leaned against the
                  door-post, and his, eyes closed as if trying to shut out the dreadful scene.</p>
               <p>Marie's tears, too, fell fast, as she bowed to the earth, her hands clasped over
                  her eyes. At last:</p>
               <p>"And did you find no further trace of her?" she softly and sympathizingly
                  asked.</p>
               <p>"Never anything more, but I had little doubt of her fate; I lost all trace; and
                  was forced reluctantly to return to the sad, sad duties of that woeful, wretched
                  night. Marie, you, as a loving daughter, can imagine my feelings. Gathering up my
                  poor mother's and sister's remains, I carried them to the trunk of a huge elm, and
                  there, with none but God to see, dug their grave and buried them close together,
                  first twining their arms around each other's necks."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Edward, say no more! What a terrible trial it must have been!"</p>
               <p>"I tell you, Marie," sternly responded her companion, "I grew a <emph>man</emph>
                  that single hight—and it was a dreary and an awful night, which turned all the
                  hopeful and tender feelings of the impulsive boy that <emph>you</emph> knew me,
                  into the hard and unforgiving man you now behold me. Stretched sobbing on the
                  freshly made grave, I took a solemn oath against the cruel savages who had thus
                  pitilessly robbed me of all remaining hope; and if Captain Jack has won any fame
                  in the settlements as an Indian- killer, the cursed reds have themselves to thank
                  for it."</p>

               <p>"WHAT, Edw—;Mr. Percy," exclaimed Marie, in great surprise, "<emph>you,</emph> are
                  not the Captain Jack who heads the Rangers, and whose prowess is told and sung
                  from one end of the frontier to the other?"</p>
               <p>"I am called differently in different localities; but now to yourself, Marie, How,
                  in the name of all that is good, came you and your old father into these leafy
                  solitudes, in the very midst of these savages, and in a time of war, too? Has he
                  forever taken leave of his senses, that he brings you thus into the very jaws of
                  danger? What can be his business here?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, just as ever, and as you might suppose—nature. He is the same simple,
                  enthusiastic naturalist he has been since I and since you knew him, only his
                  passion seems to be more absorbing and exacting with growing years and increasing
                  opportunities. He chafes, and frets and pines in the city; yearns for the virgin
                  forest and its free life;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7175-00000035"/> for its sombre
                  shades, its glad waters, its sweet odors, and its purifying influences; would be
                  ever chasing some new species of bird or animal; knows no delight equal to that of
                  roaming through fresh, untrodden wilds—and, indeed, he has so infected me with the
                  same spirit, that I believe I feel far more at home when sojourning in nature's
                  groves, with father and old Dobbin, than when in the great city."</p>
               <p>"And how," asked Jack, "has he escaped the savages, which swarm about him
                  here?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, that's the strangest part of it. He is loved and worshipped by them almost as
                  much as <emph>I</emph> love and worship him. 'Twould go hard with him among his
                  fellows, if any Indian of them all dared molest him. At first, as they daily met
                  his venerable form roaming the forest, chasing a butterfly or a
                  humming-bird—hunting out a wild flower or a wood fern—letting the deer and turkeys
                  go free, that he might bring down some little innocent bird which he wished to
                  pencil, he was looked on as one touched in his head, and as it is a universal
                  custom among the Indians to respect and protect any whom they think the Great
                  Spirit has thus afflicted, he came and went unquestioned and unharmed."</p>
               <p>"This is, indeed, passing strange; I can scarcely credit it. And how long have you
                  been in this secluded nook?"</p>
               <p>"Ever since May, and now it is July. Scarcely had spring opened before father grew
                  restless and uneasy. He had searched and hunted all the eastern part of the State.
                  His ambition is, as you well remember, to classify and represent on paper the
                  fauna of America. He made me learn to draw and paint, and prepare birds and
                  animals, and having exhausted those in the settlements, he yearned, with a
                  wondrous longing, for the unexplored wilds west of the Alleghenies. He soon so
                  infected me with his spirit, that when I saw his very life almost depended on his
                  coming West, I no longer resisted. So, loading up old Dobbin with a few
                  necessaries, we crossed the Susquehanna, and here we are. Father is just as happy
                  as a bird of these woods, and as free too, and I am well contented with seeing his
                  joy. He makes his long daily excursions up, down, and across the rivers that join
                  at the fort below; brings in his specimens for me to prepare or paint, and joyous
                  is the day for him when some rare, or new species of bird or animal is found. Why,
                  I'm almost afraid, sometimes, so glad. he is. His passion seems so deep and
                  engrossing-like, as if it touched the hidden springs of his very being."</p>
               <p>"Strange, passing strange," said Jack, "and yet I might have known it of him. I
                  have week after week coursed the forests, ascended mountains, forded or swam
                  streams in his company, and never did I see so artless, or unflagging an
                  enthusiast."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that's just the very word," smilingly replied Marie. "He's an
                     <emph>enthusiast</emph> of the first water, and his passion so possesses him
                  like a flame of holy fire, that I sometimes think it's consuming him—he seems more
                  fragile, and self-absorbed as his days pass among these solitary woods.</p>
               <p>"At first, as I said," continued Marie, pensively, "the Indians respected, but
                  avoided us, but soon they met us often in our excursions—for Dobbin and I
                  frequently accompanied father in his longer jaunts—and came to know us. They then
                  visited our camp here; saw me preparing or painting what father shot; then heard
                  him on the flute, until now scarce an evening passes but we have, as tonight, some
                  of the French officers or red chiefs up from the fort."</p>
               <p>"And the brave-looking French officer I saw sitting and heard singing with you
                  to-night, who was he, and does <emph>he</emph> come often?"</p>
               <p>"Captain Dumas; oh, yes, <emph>very</emph> often. In fact, I think I<pb n="68-69"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000036"/> am becoming quite necessary to the Captain's
                  happiness," said Marie, for the first time smiling gaily, and with an arch
                  expression on her face, very becoming to her. "He is a most gallant and
                  accomplished gentleman; and sings delightfully, and, as for conversation, he
                  excels in that—always witty and full of spirit."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, I know. I heard him talk and sing in his foreign lingo," and a cloud
                  passed over Jack's face—he could not help it. "What does he talk about. I didn't
                  understand his confounded gibberish."</p>
               <p>"Why, Edw—Mr. Percy—that is rude language. You were not eaves-dropping, were you?
                  Listeners, 'tis said, rarely hear any good of themselves. It might be well if you
                     <emph>did</emph> understand his gibberish, as you are pleased to call our
                  musical native language."</p>
               <p>"But what does he talk about to <emph>you?</emph>" impatiently repeated Jack.</p>
               <p>"Oh," archly replied Marie, her eyes shyly searching out those of Jack with a
                  certain hesitating, embarrassed air in them which was very charming, "of his wife
                  Louise and his two daughters, in Quebec. He grows melancholy enough at his
                  enforced absence and his imprisonment out in the fort. He has made me his
                  confidante, and insists he has the prettiest wife and sweetest children in
                  America, so that I feel as if I already knew them."</p>
               <p>A brighter look comes in Jack's face, which grows softer and handsomer under the
                  change. He appears ten years younger than an hour before, and as if he would
                  almost give a Delaware a run for his life rather than drop him with a pursuing
                  bullet. Another dark shadow, however, as he puts the following:</p>
               <p>"And, Marie, tell me what has become of—of—of your husband?"</p>
               <p>"What! my—my husband?" and a mirthful and musical, but rather constrained little
                  laugh rippled from her lips. "And who told you, inquisitive sir, I had a
                  husband?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no one," rather nervously and impatiently responded Jack. "I only judged that
                  you soon would have one, from the scene I last saw you engaged in; and—and—have
                  you never married?" looking at her earnestly—almost pleadingly.</p>
               <p>Marie flushed up and bit her lip. A brief and embarrassed silence followed, when
                  thus Marie, rather sarcastically:</p>
               <p>"And so, Edw—Mr. Percy, I mean you have waited these many years to offer your
                  singular congratulations to me as a bride. That was not very gallant for one known
                  as the very pink of courtesy. Did I not, since you force me to recall it, as a
                  girl of sixteen, once tell you as an ardent and very romantic youth of twenty,
                  that my life should be devoted to my father, who required all my loving care and
                  affection? What I said I <emph>meant,</emph> and so have lived."</p>
               <p>"You did say it, but you talked very differently in French to young Monsieur
                  Dubois the next evening."</p>
               <p>"Oh, did I? It might have been very far better if you had studied French when you
                  were young. 'Twould have saved your fiery and jealous nature from some hasty, and
                  allow me to add, foolish actions."</p>
               <p>It was Jack's turn now to flush up and bite his lip. His swarthy, weather-beaten
                  visage, looked disturbed. There was a new light in his eyes, arid a stammer on his
                  tongue, as he essayed to speak. But the words died on his lips. He was eloquently
                  dumb, and an embarrassed silence followed, both parties looking rather
                  uncomfortable; but with the ready address of a nimble-witted woman, Marie managed
                  to get out of the difficulty by exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"But I hear father coming. He will be astounded to know what a visitor he has
                  to-night."</p>

               <p>IT may be as well just here to go back a little in our story, and state what never
                  did or could have come out in their conversation. Many things can be thought,
                  which it would not be proper to speak. The minds and memories of both were busy,
                  and each rapidly recalled the past—their separation and the causes of it.</p>
               <p>Monsieur de Bonneville was a professional French naturalist, and a most ardent
                  enthusiast. He had aspirations beyond what was common in the old French schools of
                  that day, and was most ambitious to make his own original researches from the live
                  form, and not follow the beaten path of studying animated nature from stuffed
                  collections. He left France for America in 1726, impelled thereto by an
                  irresistible yearning to explore the untrodden wilds, and to roam the virgin
                  forests of America; make discoveries of new species of birds and animals; see them
                  in their own native haunts; study there their habits and characteristics—their
                  loves, chases, battles, gambols, and changeful moods. This to him was the very
                  poetry of life, and a fascination which only enthusiasts like himself could
                  appreciate.</p>
               <p>With the desire to note, came also the resolve to portray; to transfix, as with an
                  enchanter's pencil, these "arrowy cleavers of the air," as they glowed past in all
                  the gay tints and airy graces of their fresh, fleeting lives. The spoils of each
                  day would be immediately transferred to paper, before their "vesture had been
                  sullied," or death had faded their glows and tints of plumage. Not only so, but
                  they would be represented in the very attitude of life, and on the very reed,
                  twig, or bush, where death had stilled them. Thus, and only thus, de Bonneville
                  argued with justice, could we have very nature itself, and not her counterfeit
                  presentments.</p>
               <p>Debarking at Philadelphia, and having thus reverently and lovingly dedicated
                  himself to this holy priesthood of nature, de Bonneville patiently prepared
                  himself with the greatest care. He learned to draw and color. He soon made the
                  acquaintance of, and married an American lady, who died when Marie, his only
                  child, was but thirteen years old. Mrs. Percy, a dear friend of the deceased, and
                  a widow of respectability, took charge of Marie when her father was absent on his
                  various forest expeditions throughout the colonies, and thus she was thrown into
                  relationship with Edward and Emma, and Lucy Percy, then a mere child.</p>
               <p>Edward was a bright, ardent and impetuous youth, hasty and violent in his likes
                  and dislikes; somewhat moody, and extravagantly fond of hunting and roaming the
                  forests. He belonged to the restless "wild-turkey breed" of men, so common in that
                  day, and spent much of the last<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7175-00000038"/> two years
                  with de Bonneville, in his various excursions towards middle Pennsylvania.</p>
               <p>M. de Bonneville, desirous of putting into some useful shape the results of his
                  many wanderings, in which he had so long braved "all the spite of the wreckful
                  elements," and having most carefully educated Marie to do her share of the
                  artwork, took lodgings of his own. 'Edward never knew how intimately Marie had
                  twined herself into his young life, until she left his mother's house. Possessing
                  one of those hot and jealous natures which would not brook two passions at the
                  same time, his love for Marie became a paramount and all-absorbing devotion,
                  attended by fitful moods and jealousies.</p>
               <p>Marie's love for him was probably quite as deep as his for her, but it was not so
                  demonstrative—scarcely even known to herself. She had all a true woman's address,
                  and delicacy, and maidenly reserve. Not very long afterwards, and at the end of a
                  misunderstanding in which Edward had hotly reproached her with favoring the
                  attentions of a Monsieur Dubois—a nephew of M. de Bonneville, who had lately
                  arrived from Paris to push his fortunes in the New World—he somewhat violently
                  threw himself at her feet, and passionately declared his love.</p>
               <p>It is not much wonder, in the temper she then was, that she did not respond as
                  ardently and as fully as was hoped. She treated the matter lightly; said she was
                  but a mere girl, entirely too young to think of such matters; and besides, had
                  made up her mind to love none but her father, and devote her life to him; he was
                  almost like a child in many things; was alone, and growing old, and required all
                  her most watchful care.</p>
               <p>Edward was baffled and deeply chagrined, for his passion was an all-devouring one,
                  admitting no faint or divided worship. He grew moody, unhappy, and unreasonable.
                  But all would probably have righted itself in time, had he not, unluckily, the
                  very next evening, on entering her parlor without knocking, quietly come upon
                  Marie and young Mr. Dubois together, talking French in a most rapid and earnest
                  manner, the latter on his knees, and Marie smilingly—and as his jealous eyes saw,
                  or thought they saw—approvingly raising him to his feet.</p>
               <p>This was enough for Edward's violent and impetuous nature. The shock was a most
                  terrible one, for a moment completely stunning him. He had occasionally suspected
                  Dubois of interference, but never dreamed of its having gone to such a pass. He
                  did not know, and never stayed to learn that this Dubois, a light and rather
                  trifling character, was enamored, or supposed he was, of an entirely different
                  lady, and was only sportively rehearsing to his cousin how he intended to pay his
                  successful addresses when the time should come, and- requesting her to act the
                  part of his sweetheart.</p>
               <p>Edward—though not unseen by his lady-love—rushed madly from the house, told his
                  mother all in the violence of despair, was deaf to her entreaty, and insisted on
                  instantly carrying out a scheme of removal to the West, which they had often
                  talked over.</p>
               <p>The fond mother, proud of her son, and almost equally hurt and disappointed,
                  finally consented, and a few days afterwards they quietly took their departure
                  towards the Susquehanna, which was the extreme frontier line at that time.</p>
               <p>We have seen how sadly, how shockingly, that pioneer dream ended, and how the
                  impetuous, but lovable youth of twenty was, under this double grief, transformed
                  into the stern, moody, and revengful man, with all the most amiable qualities of
                  his character—which, under more propitious circumstances, would have blossomed
                  into a steady and happy life—turned into gall.</p>
               <p>The years had since elapsed. Supposing Marie long<pb n="74-75"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000039"/> since married, he had never re-visited the city,
                  and had never once heard from her or her father.</p>
               <p>She had her disappointment, which she bore patiently and uncomplainingly, as only
                  woman can, merely showing, by an increased devotion and tenderness to her father,
                  and by a total seclusion and unremitting attention to her art, that a shadow,
                  which the world wot not of, had passed over her young life, blighting though not
                  crushing.</p>
               <p>But time passed on. She was but a girl, naturally hopeful and buoyant, and had
                  long since learned, if not to forget, at least to dwell on the event as a tender
                  memory of the past, when Edward's sudden and mysterious appearance, with the old
                  peculiar signal by which he was accustomed so often to announce his approach, gave
                  her a terribly rude awakening, and her whole mind was in a wonderful tumult and
                  agitation, which she had great difficulty to conceal, and which, had her old lover
                  once suspected, would have stirred and gladdened him to the inmost fibre of his
                  being.</p>

               <p>—AND now was heard old M. de Bonneville's excited, quavering voice, as,
                  approaching the hut, he hastily cried out:</p>
               <p>"Why, Marie, child! daughter! what—what means this? Look this way, quick! quick!
                  As I was about approaching the fire to renew the wood for the night, I saw that
                  strange, dusky figure, sitting like a statue on the log, his painted face in all
                  its grim and hideous savagery. It turned not at my approach. 'Tis an
                  apparitio—some baleful spectre! I never saw the Chief before."</p>
               <p>"Fear not, Marie," hurriedly whispered Jack. "I expect 'tis my companion, who
                  knows he has nothing here to dread, and who must be tired of waiting on me."</p>
               <p>"Be not alarmed, dear father; I think this unexpected visitor here can explain the
                  matter, satisfactorily."</p>
               <p>"What! child," anxiously exclaimed de Bonneville, on entering the lodge door, and
                  catching sight of Jack. "A stranger here, and in our tent? Marie, daughter, 'twas
                  thoughtless of you; you should have told me this." Then<pb n="76-77"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000040"/> stepping forward and looking Jack calmly in the
                  eyes, and with a noble and simple dignity: "Who and what are you, sir, and what is
                  your errand here, that you enter my simple hut so rudely and unceremoniously? If
                  you are English—and I address you in that language because I know you are not
                  French—tell me why the presence of this lady has not taught you better
                  manners."</p>
               <p>"Why, dear father, is it possible you do not know an old friend?"</p>
               <p>The old man gazed intently into Jack's face, scrutinized it most searchingly, then
                  threw his eyes rapidly over the tall form, and shook his head. It was no wonder.
                  Great changes had taken place in that visage and frame since he last saw it.</p>
               <p>"I'm getting very, very old, sir, and my eyes are none of the best. Pardon me,
                  stranger, but I don't—think—I ever saw you before."</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, Father, and hunted with him many and many's the day! You used to say
                  you could <emph>see</emph> the birds the quickest, but Edward Percy was the only
                  one who could bring them down without spoiling their plumage."</p>
               <p>"What! Edward Percy?" said the old man, slowly, hesitatingly, and in a sort of
                  daze. "Why, Marie, this is a cruel, sorry jest; you mock me, daughter. Edward was
                  a bright, joyous, eager boy, active as a cat, lithe as a leopard, and supple as a
                  panther; the keenest eye, quickest foot, and truest shot I ever saw before or
                  since, while this great, dark stranger is—is—"</p>
               <p>"Edward Percy, at your service, Monsieur de Bonneville," smilingly exclaimed Jack,
                  Marie's eyes fairly beaming and glistening with delight. "Time works sad changes
                  on a man, sir, especially if life has gone heavy with him, and I presume
                     <emph>I</emph> am no exception to the rule."</p>
               <p>The old man's face began to show signs of recognition. The voice, smile and
                  decisive manner of old were not <emph>all</emph> gone. At last it came, full and
                  free:</p>
               <p>"Why, Eddy, this is a miracle, indeed. Where have you been these long, long,
                  lonely years? 'Twas uncivil in you to leave us so. Oh, how I've missed you in my
                  rambles; but now you've come to join me again. Oh, Eddy, what treasures I have
                  found in these western wilds. Enough for a lifetime, lad. Scarce a day passes but
                  I bear some new feathered or petted prize home for Marie to draw. Why, just look
                  here!" and he hurried over to his large books of drawings and commenced turning
                  over the leaves.</p>
               <p>"Father", sadly whispered Marie, somewhat "smily 'round the lips, but teary 'round
                  the lashes," "thinks you still a boy, Mr. Percy, and that he has but just lately
                  parted with you. Bear with him and his passion. Time has wrought its changes on
                  him, too, as well as on you and me, but he is the same brave, gentle, and gallant
                  spirit as ever. Nature never had truer, or more devout worshipper."</p>
               <p>"Jack," as we must continue to call him, went over to the various
                  portfolios—covering the results of long months of rambles, and patient
                  workings—and with somewhat of his old enthusiasm, listened to the "old man
                  eloquent," as, with a lover's look and fondness, he introduced him to each object
                  of his regard.</p>
               <p>They both had a dash of the wilderness, and, as it were, a fragrance of the woods
                  about them, and yet how different. And Marie, with softened eyes and beaming
                  countenance, would join in, catching the fine enthusiasm of the hour, and
                  gradually talking of old and of present times, and of what father and she had
                  done, and were doing and going to do. Jack, too, was closely questioned as to his
                  own life, and told them much that moved their wonder. They would all doubtless
                  have continued there till dawn, had not Scarooyaddy suddenly made his appearance
                  at the<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7175-00000041"/> lodge door, and with grave and
                  dignified face, on which surprise and curiosity, too, were clearly visible,
                  exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Captain Jack, 'tis growing very deep into the night, and we have a full hour yet
                  before we can reach the fort, and much long work to do there. The moon is down,
                  and, and—you can come back this way"—this last on his begining to take in the
                  situation.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, Chief, I was rude and forgetful to keep you waiting so long.
                     <emph>You</emph> would not have done it, I know." Then turning to Miss de
                  Bonneville's father:</p>
               <p>"<emph>This,</emph> sir, is doubtless, the apparition which disturbed you awhile
                  since. Know him now, in the flesh and blood, as the truest, bravest and most
                  faithful redskin that ever trod and Indian trail. A full-blooded and mighty Chief;
                  a Sachem of the Six Nations—the Half-king, Scarooyaddy."</p>
               <p>"Any tried friend of Edward Percy, be he white, or red, is most heartily welcome
                  to my rustic home," answered de Bonneville with inimitable grace and dignity.</p>
               <p>"But, Marie," exclaimed Jack, "what has become of the little Indian maiden, who
                  would have fairly slain me awhile since with her angry, piercing eyes. She has all
                  the spirit, and the beauty, too, of a panther's kitten. Despite her indignant
                  flashes, she has a singular interest for me. How came she, too, in your lodge, or
                  is this a part of the strange dream which even yet enthralls me?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Wau-ki-na, 'the bounding fawn,' you mean. She is my protégée, and glad am I
                  to have her blithesome company. I saw her but a moment since, on her couch of
                  skins, in a troubled sleep, a bright flush on her fair cheek, and the name of Lucy
                  dwelling on her lips. A more affectionate child I never saw. I already love her
                  like a sister."</p>
               <p>"But who, and whence is she?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, a sprite of these woods, I believe. Father and I passed through
                  Shannopinstown about a month since, and while he was absent across the Allegheny,
                  I spent the day in the Delaware village, going about among the tents, and making
                  acquaintance with the squaws and maidens. In the afternoon the young lasses had a
                  dance of the grass, and I was instantly struck with this beautiful young girl—at
                  her grace, her fairness, and refinement. She was a singular contrast to all the
                  rest, and my heart went right out to her, as I believe hers did to me. 'Twas a
                  real case of 'love at first sight."</p>
               <p>"Yes," laughed her father, "so much so, that she begged, almost with tears in her
                  eyes, of Captain Pipe, the Delaware Chief and her father—although she looks about
                  as much like him as my leggings do to a leaping stag—that he would let the child
                  stay with her for the summer, in our forest home, and she gained her point, too,
                  and they are inseparable, billing and cooing like two turtle doves."</p>

               <p>"AND now," said Jack, rising and leading M. de Bonneville a step apart, "one
                  earnest word, my dear sir, before I go. Do you not know this is no safe or proper
                  place for you and these maidens? Why, Braddock and his whole army are but a few
                  days distant. We are now, as I told you, out on a scout from his army. Very soon
                  these woods will be swarming with savages and scouts, of both French and English.
                  Blood once drawn, your swarthy friends will turn into incarnate fiends. The devils
                  will brook no neutrals on these grounds. On one pretence or another, they will
                  invade this forest sanctuary, and I shudder to think what may happen."</p>
               <p>"You judge them too harshly, Edward. I have—"</p>
               <p>"Not a whit; not one iota, I warn you. I know them all from moccasin to
                  scalp-lock. Pontiac, mayhap, would not do it, nor Athanase, nor Guyasutha, but
                  their cruel followers would. Now, I do beg you, my old friend, be advised in time.
                  Soon as my scout is done at the fort, I will be back early to-morrow, and then let
                  me conduct you and Marie safely to Braddock's army; as for Wau-ki-na, send her
                  home <emph>at once.</emph> After the fort is taken, you can make <emph>that</emph>
                  the centre of your naturalist operations, and I will most gladly join you. I'm
                  free as air, can go where I list, and would glory in the life."</p>
               <p>"I have," replied the anxious father, "brooded over this. Should anything happen
                  my darling child, I could not survive it. Do you <emph>really</emph> think,
                  Edward, there is danger?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, of the most imminent kind! I would not for the world have Marie stay
                  here one minute longer than necessary. Have all your affairs ready to move on an
                  instant's notice, and promise me to go with us to-morrow. Wont you promise?"
                  almost pleaded Jack.</p>
               <p>"I do, most solemnly," hastily whispered the now thoroughly-alarmed father; "and,
                  oh! hasten back! 'Tis not for myself I fear, but for Marie."</p>
               <p>"Ah, where is she?" hurriedly exclaimed Jack. "Marie, I must now bid you
                  good-night. I will be back, if all go right, by sunrise to-morrow, and you and
                  your father must be ready to go with me. Don't question! I have already loitered
                  here much too long."</p>
               <p>"And where, Mr. Per—"and then smilingly, "Edward, I may call you, as of old, may I
                  not?—where would you lead us, and why this wondrous haste?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, your father will explain all; only be ready; stir not from this spot,
                  and—and—good-night; I cannot, <emph>must</emph> not stay longer, 'twould be
                  weakness."</p>
               <p>He extended his brawny hand; her delicate fingers closed in its roomy palm; their
                  eyes met, and more was told in their softened glances than either of them yet
                  knew, or could fairly comprehend.</p>
               <p>"And where do <emph>you</emph> go, Edward? Certainly not to the fort!" anxiously
                  exclaimed Marie.</p>
               <p>"Oh, we are not now on a fighting, but a scouting expedition," said Jack, as he
                  seized his trusty rifle, and joined his companion, who awaited him at a little
                  distance. "We<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7175-00000043"/> will be as cautious as
                  foxes, ready to run at the first alarm. Don't fear for us. Once more, good-night,
                  and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au revoir,</foreign> as your Captain Dumas would
                  say."</p>
               <p>The two hastily strode down to their canoe, shoved it off, and were out into the
                  Monongahela. The paddles were industriously plied. Jack remained for a period in
                  silent musing, as if he were engaged gathering in his confused mind the scattered,
                  tangled threads of what had just transpired, and then began to smile and chat
                  almost gaily, even giving out an occasional low laugh, in a way that the Half-King
                  had never yet heard, and which greatly astonished him. Finally, he was, regardless
                  of all prudence, actually breaking out into a snatch of camp song, when the Chief
                  could stand it no longer.</p>
               <p>"My brother is gay to-night. He is no longer the Indian's <title>Black
                     Rifle,</title> but the maiden's <title>Warbling Flute.</title> What has the Old
                  Medicine in the tent given Captain Jack, the Ranger, to turn him into a boy again;
                  or maybe," he meaningly continued, "it was the Young Medicine girl who has stolen
                  away my brother's senses. The 'wood thrush' has a pleasant warble, and her face is
                  very sweet to look on."</p>
               <p>"Why, Yaddy, I <emph>do</emph> feel to-night as if a great load were lifted from
                  my heavy heart. I have talked with old and dear friends of my youth; and what's
                  more, we must see them again to-morrow, and lead them back to the army. Wont the
                  strutting, pompous old General be stunned at the kind of prisoners we bring him?
                  but now we are nearing the fort, I must grow sober again. Let us float quietly
                  amid stream. The moon is now clouded, to be sure, but still, 'twould be safer to
                  keep out a little. I'm now Jack, the Ranger, again."</p>
               <p>They floated on, and on, keeping a most wary lookout on either shore, and
                  listening with strained ear for the dip of paddles, or for any, even the faintest,
                  sound from the dark, sombre, solemn forests which crowded down to the very
                  waters.</p>
               <p>None, however, were heard, and now the dim outlines of the stockades of Old Fort
                  Duquesne could be faintly seen above the steep banks, and the flickering lights
                  from dying camp fires around. It was about one of the morning. The canoe was
                  allowed to float noiselessly along past the fort, until it struck the swift
                  current of the Allegheny. The paddles were then cautiously and quietly dipped in
                  the water, and the light birch, obedient to the slightest motion, turned up the
                  Allegheny.</p>
               <p>Close observations were made along the shore for a full half mile, and all the
                  canoes and batteaux counted, to find out how many had lately come down from French
                  Creek. Happily, not a wandering canoe was encountered. No sentinel's challenge
                  broke the stillness of the night. The enemy, both in and out of the fort,
                  expecting no immediate danger, was sunk in the deepest repose.</p>
               <p>They then turned back on their course, and continued up the Monongahela, but
                  closer to the shore than before. All was quiet as the grave. Nothing heard but an
                  occasional loon, the owl's gloomy hoot, or a prowling wolf's howl, answering to
                  one on the opposite bank.</p>
               <p>About a mile up this river they, with exceeding caution, impelled their light
                  birch into a little cove, and waited and waited, in perfect silence, until near
                  three, when all should be wrapped in deepest sleep. They then stole out of the
                  canoe, rifles at rest and tomahawks ready for instant service. Clambering up the
                  rugged bank, they entered the dark forest, avoided as best they could the
                  entangling vines and retarding underbrush, glided stealthily from tree to tree,
                  and gradually approached the circle of Indian fires.</p>
               <p>These they counted. Not even a dog to give the alarm. They were not coming on an
                  Indian village now, but camps<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7175-00000044"/> of "braves"
                  out on the war path. As expected, no sentinels were out. The Indians were too
                  constantly and correctly advised of the exact daily progress of Braddock's army to
                  apprehend the slightest danger yet; and all was a death-like silence.</p>
               <p>Our reckless scouts glided about like spectres from one fire to another, always
                  keeping in the shadows of the huge oaks and buttonwoods which grew thickly about.
                  They carefully completed their observations, and just as dawn was breaking, gained
                  the edge of what is now called Grant's Hill. Here they rested for half an hour,
                  and then skirting the hill, were making for the river and their canoe, when, as
                  has already been stated, they suddenly came upon a French officer out on an early
                  hunt.</p>
               <p>Then followed the Half-King's unlucky shot, by which all the plans so carefully
                  laid by Jack were deranged, and winch led to the exciting chase and escape across
                  the Monongahela river, and right under the very guns of the fort. It was an
                  untoward blunder, which put both parties of scouts in extreme peril. (See <hi
                     rend="i"/>Appendix G.)</p>
               <p>Our readers are now masters of Jack's secret; can appreciate how keen must have
                  been his disappointment at not being able, as intended, to go straight back to de
                  Bonneville, and are prepared to follow him and the Half-King, in their visit to
                  old King Shingiss, thence to reach Marie and her father by a roundabout course,
                  and one which lay right through their swarming foes, and which was beset with the
                  most imminent perils.</p>

               <p>THE reunited scouting party, following Captain Jack's suggestion of walking
                  ostentatiously along the cone of Coal Hill, in order to mislead the many watchers
                  from the fort, had no sooner gained the favoring obscurity of the first woods,
                  than it turned abruptly off.</p>
               <p>Captain Jack and the Half-King immediately doubled on their course and hurried
                  down the stream—but along the crest of the hill—at a free, swinging gait, which
                  soon brought them to a steep and rugged declivity overlooking the valley through
                  which, what is now called "Saw Mill Run" brawled its tortuous way.</p>
               <p>Down this headlong steep, aiding their descent by vines and brush, and without
                  pausing long to pick their steps, they plunged. Crossing the run, they sought the
                  covert of the river bank, and sheltered behind its dense and luxuriant foliage,
                  and feeling, for the first time, comparatively safe, they paused to fetch a long
                  breath.</p>
               <p>The sun was now well up in the heavens; the air was fresh and balmy; the fragrance
                  of the lush and abundant vegetation rose like morning incense from all sides,
                     and<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7175-00000045"/> had not their situation been so
                  full of grave peril, and their long life in the forest made such scenes a daily
                  occurrence, the two scouts might well have paused to admire the beautiful
                  scene.</p>
               <p>But more anxious thoughts filled their minds. The situation was one of imminent
                  danger, to escape from which required all the fertile resources of a ready wit and
                  an experience of many years of backwoods life.</p>
               <p>Even as they gazed toward Fort Duquesne, to note what new steps were there being
                  taken, five canoes, filled with young warriors engaged in animated conversation,
                  shot close by them. These were all alive with expectation, and were excitedly
                  speculating on the cause of the late commotion at the fort. Our scouts, crouched
                  behind some water-willows and the thick undergrowth which skirted the stream's
                  margin, giving it such a rich broidery of emerald, could almost have touched hands
                  with the Delaware paddlers.</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! Chief," whispered Jack, "we've shook up old Shingiss' camp, sure! He's
                  scarce enough men left to draw his nets to-day. Those younkers, I'll wager, have
                  had little time to digest their morning venison; but their room is better than
                  their company. It couldn't have happened better. How long are we yet from the
                  lodge of the grim old Delaware?" No answer. "I say, old fellow, why—"Jack turned
                  abruptly, and saw Scarooyaddy leaning against a tree, limp and pale, an expression
                  of anguish on his face.</p>
               <p>"Why, whatever's the matter with the Chief? I see it all. Let an Indian alone for
                  hiding his pain. The old fox would as soon whimper under a Catawba's torture as
                  let me know how his wound hurts him.</p>
               <p>"Why, Chief, how goes it? Let <emph>me</emph> see your arm."</p>
               <p>Jack took up the dangling limb tenderly, and carefully examined it. The blood was
                  pumping out quite freely— evidently no bones broken, but the bullet had made an
                  ugly hole, and had done its bloody work among the Oneida's flesh and arteries.</p>
               <p>"Come! come! Chief. This has gone too far. You've lost enough good blood to
                  rejoice a Huron. Stay till I bind this handkerchief around,—so;—now come to the
                  water's edge, till I dash some in your face, and take, too, a little inwardly.
                  'Tis not, as the Irish rum traders would say, so pinetrating or sarching, quite,
                  as 'fire-water,' but 'twill do on a fetch. Drink from this bass-wood leaf, 'Twill
                  do you good, man. Now; don't you feel better already?"</p>
               <p>"Scarooyaddy thanks his good brother. 'Tis nothing. Come! I'll show you the path
                  to the Delaware's lodge. When the chain of friendship was kept bright and the road
                  ever open, I was often in the old Delaware's wigwam; but now a black cloud has
                  come between us, which I must blow away."</p>
               <p>"And what are you going to say to old Shingiss, Chief? He has clearly taken sides
                  with the French. Do you think it safe for us to defy him in his own lair? Mind ye,
                  he's of a devilish ugly temper, and as hard and crooked as the gnarl of an
                  oak."</p>
               <p>"Scarooyaddy," answered the Chief with dignity, "will order him to take up the
                  hatchet against the French. <emph>I</emph> care not who he's for or against The
                  Delawares are now women and wear petticoats. The Six Nations conquered them long,
                  long years ago. They made them move back first from the Delaware, then from the
                  Susquehanna, and we'll drive them still further to the setting sun, if they forget
                  who are their masters."</p>
               <p>"Braw words, Chief; but have a care—have a cafe! The Delawares are a proud and
                  warlike people, and it is far from the Allegheny to the Council Chamber at
                  Onondago. If I mistake not, they have been long restive under your<pb n="88-89"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000046"/> rule, and seek a pretext to throw off the Iroquois'
                  yoke." (See <hi rend="i"/>Appendix H.)</p>
               <p>While thus engaged in conversation, they came to the mouth of the large creek
                  called after Peter Chartier, the noted half-breed French spy and Indian trader.
                  Here they found a number of fishing canoes. Jumping into the nearest, it took but
                  one shove to land them on the other side, and they straightway proceeded along the
                  bend which sweeps around the foot of what was then called Chartiers, but now
                  Brunot's Island.</p>
               <p>Near the jutting promontory at present known as "McKee's Rocks," and on one side
                  of the commanding knoll, where the celebrated Ohio Company had once marked out as
                  even a more fitting place to build a fort and found a settlement, than the forks
                  of the Ohio, was a collection of bark huts, where Shingiss, king of the Delawares,
                  lived. (See <hi rend="i"/>Appendix I.)</p>
               <p>And a most carefully-selected site it was—few more picturesque or more commanding
                  on the Ohio—and our scouts could not refrain from pausing, hurried as they were
                  and urgent as was their business, to cast an admiring and comprehensive glance
                  over the salient land and water features of the beautiful scene before and around
                  them.</p>
               <p>Directly in front was the long and densely-wooded island, now everywhere known as
                  Brunot's, dividing the broad current of the Ohio, yet, in such fashion that the
                  volume of the main stream seemed no whit diminished, while the other had cut
                  deeply into the land, curving around, as stated, in a beautiful sweep. Near the
                  end of this island came in Chartier's creek, running through a rich and
                  heavily-timbered "bottom."</p>
               <p>Along the course which the scouts had travelled, the hills rose high and
                  precipitous, leaving but a narrow ledge between them and the river; but here they
                  softened down into gentler forms, and receded from the water in a series of
                  billowy slopes, covered from their tops almost to the very river's edge, with the
                  most vividly green and bright foliage.</p>
               <p>Right back of the little cluster of cabins and the smouldering fires around them,
                  was a broad level of rich and densely-wooded bottom-land, flanked by the isolated
                  and beautiful knoll, on top of which can yet be seen, for miles, a prominent
                  Indian mound. On the shingle in front were drawn up a dozen or so of birch and
                  pine canoes.</p>
               <p>Altogether, a right royal place for a king's residence. It had evidently been
                  chosen with care and taste. It was, at the same time, sheltered, commanding,
                  picturesque, and with unsurpassed fishing and hunting grounds all about. Even to
                  this present, that pleasant reach of shore forms one of the most favored
                  excursions from Pittsburgh.</p>
               <p>In the midst of the group of cabins, stood one much more spacious and pretentious
                  than the rest. The frail door was drawn to, but curious sounds, as of chanting,
                  could be heard coming from it. No human visible but a squaw, and an Indian maiden
                  at a little distance, coming down the hill path at the side. All the fighting men,
                  disturbed by the great guns from the fort, had gone up the Ohio.</p>
               <p>The Half-King, leading the way as one knowing his ground, and closely followed by
                  Jack, strode hastily to the door, tapped, and exclaimed, with great directness, in
                  the Delaware dialect:</p>
               <p>"If King Shingiss is within, Monecatootha and 'La Carrabine Noir' are at his door,
                  waiting a welcome."</p>
               <p>Had a bomb-shell fallen in their midst, it could not have caused a greater
                  commotion among the inmates. There was a cry, a rush, a click of rifle cocks, and
                  the door was flung open by a short, sturdy, and determined-looking chief, past the
                  middle age, and with as piercing and glittering an eye as was ever placed in an
                  Indian forehead.</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7175-00000047"/>
               <p>With rifle at cock, he seemed uncertain what to do—shoot, or club the reckless
                  intruders. He was evidently taken wholly at unawares—not a sound or a single note
                  of alarm, and this may be, for what he knew, the advance of Braddock's army. The
                  name of The Black Rifle was a potent spell in those days. Of him, Shingiss had
                  often heard, but never before seen.</p>
               <p>The old king, speechless and quivering with excitement, gazed, or rather glared,
                  first at one, and then the other. His eyes fairly shot fire. A fragrance, as of
                  burnt herbs and shrubs, escaped from the open door, and behind the form of
                  Shingiss could be dimly seen other chiefs, in attitudes fixed and attentive. Our
                  scouts stood calm and resolute, but with rifle on shoulder, denoting peaceful
                  intent.</p>
               <p>At last Shingiss, endeavoring to conceal his surprise and indignation at the
                  unseemly interruption to the incantations evidently going on within, broke
                  silence:</p>
               <p>"Monecatootha is a very rash chief, thus to bring himself, and his friend, The
                  Black Rifle"—and here he cast another scrutinizing but respectful glance, at the
                  foe of his tribe—"into the very camp of the Delawares. What means it?"—glancing
                  along the route they came—"war, or peace? Are you alone, or have you a following?
                  Surely"—gazing inquiringly into the Half-King's eyes—"the noise of the big guns
                     <emph>can't</emph> mean that the English have taken the fort?" and he
                     <emph>again</emph> raised his rifle.</p>
               <p>"Stay your hand, king! We came straight from Braddock, but he is far from here.
                  The hatchet is not yet dug up between us, and we mean peace, unless
                     <emph>you</emph> mean war."</p>
               <p>"Shingiss thought his young men could not so deceive him. One, two, three, four
                  days before the English come. We have out many eyes and ears. Enter Shingiss'
                  lodge, if you come with 'speech-belts.'"</p>

               <p>THE old king, with a meaning and sarcastic smile, stood aside for them to
                  enter.</p>
               <p>It was our scouts' turn now to be surprised. Jack only found himself in presence
                  of three Delaware chiefs, whom he did not know; but the Half-King immediately
                  recognized them as King Beaver, brother and equal to Shingiss; Kateuskund, a noted
                  sachem and counsellor, and Killbuck, a great captain and conjurer—all Delawares.
                  Schooled, as it was his nature and education to be, he could not refrain an
                  exclamation of surprise.</p>
               <p>"Monecatootha,—a little bird has sung to me,—takes the place of Tannecharison, who
                  has gone back to the Great Spirit. If the new Half-King brings speeches from our
                  uncles at Onondago" (meaning the Six Nations), "he will be glad to have so many
                  great chiefs, whom he knows, to hear them."</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7175-00000048"/>
               <p>"It is well," replied Scarooyaddy or Monecatootha, with dignity. "I offer you this
                  belt," producing a broad belt of wampum, with eight diamond figures beautifully
                  worked in. "The Six Nations have heard a bad tale that the Delawares and Shawanos
                  have taken up the hatchet against the English; and the great war chief, Braddock,
                  has sent me to you that I may know these tales are lies, and to brighten the chain
                  of friendship which has so long tied us together, and to smoke a new pipe of peace
                  with that good old tobacco which the Friends [Quakers] send you. What answer shall
                  I carry back?"</p>
               <p>"And what says The Black Rifle?" politely put in Shingiss. "So great a white
                  'brave' should have a voice in this council. Does he, too, carry a new story of
                  peace on his tongue?"</p>
               <p>"Even so. The English are but a few marches off, with an army of trained 'braves,'
                  numerous as the leaves in the forest. They will take the fort at the De-un-da-ga
                  (the forks), and drive the French into the lakes. All who fight with them will be
                  crushed."</p>
               <p>"Before we give answer," searchingly queried Shingiss, "will my brothers tell us
                  what made the big guns fire this morning? My young men have not yet come back to
                  tell me."</p>
               <p>The two scouts looked at each other. They had not expected this question; when
                  thus Jack:</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, Chief; I'm white, and am not here to keep back the truth, whether it
                  tells for or against. They fired at <emph>us,</emph> and that was the cause,"
                  pointing to the Half King's girdle, where hung the French officer's scalp; "but if
                  I must say it, so far I think we've had the best of the fight, although your old
                  friend here <emph>has</emph> been winged a little," and he pointed to
                  Scarooyaddy's arm, stiffened with blood.</p>
               <p>This crisp and double-shotted little speech excited some interest among the
                  chiefs, who cast quiet but meaning looks at each other, but said never a word. It
                  was fortunate the scalp was a French and not a Delaware one.</p>
               <p>"Then my brothers come out as spies, as well as to carry peaceful songs," calmly
                  continued the old Delaware. "Another question: If the great white chief means so
                  well to the Delawares and Shawanos, and their friends, the Iroquois, why has he
                  hired so many hundreds of our old enemies, the Catawbas and Cherokees, when he
                  might have had <emph>us?</emph> Does he look two ways? Has he a cleft tongue, like
                  a snake?"</p>
               <p>"Now, Chief," hurriedly answered Jack, "who told you that? It's all stuff and
                  nonsense. I will not deny that he <emph>did,</emph> through Gist's son, bargain
                  with some of those far-South Indians, but 'twas before he knew what a blunder it
                  would be, and because he wouldn't take advice. He hasn't one Carolina or Florida
                  red with him—not one. Besides, how many western tribes have the French hired to
                  take part against us? Whose camp-fires are now about the fort? tell me
                     <emph>that,</emph> Shingiss!"</p>
               <p>"My brother talks from the heart and is not forktongued," replied Shingiss, his
                  respect for Jack evidently increasing each moment. "Let Kateuskund say what answer
                  Monecatootha shall carry back with him."</p>
               <p>The chiefs exchanged a few meaning looks and words together, when Kateuskund, the
                  oldest, arose, and with great calmness and dignity said, first pointing to some
                  scalps in one corner, which were stretched on small hoops to dry:</p>
               <p>"Monecatootha sees there that his speech-belt is too late. I return it to him. We
                  don't tramp it under foot, but we don't want it, and wont have it," handing back
                  the belt. "Our young braves have been on the war-path ever since the pale-face
                  army left Cucucbetuc [Cumberland]. The Six Nations are not so foolish as you may
                  suppose. We do not know what they say to <emph>you,</emph> my brother, but we
                     do<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7175-00000049"/> know they fear the English want to
                  take all our and their lands. Some of them are now with us. We have taken up the
                  hatchet for Onontio [the French]. They have always treated us well, and given us
                  all we want, and the Great Spirit goes with us."</p>
               <p>Then King Beaver:</p>
               <p>"The Shawanos gave us the hatchet from the French, and have persuaded us to strike
                  the English. Blood has been shed; there are the scalps of your marching warriors;
                  and it is too late to go back. Why don't the English and French fight their
                  battles in their own land, or on the water? This country was given to us by the
                  Great Spirit, and neither French nor English shall have it—not one foot. As soon
                  as the English are driven away, we will not suffer the French to stay here. They
                  have promised us to go back to Canada. If not, we'll <emph>drive</emph> them back
                  with bloody switches. All this," stretching his arm majestically in a broad sweep,
                  "is the red man's land, given us by the Great Spirit; we'll live and die here. Be
                  warned in time. King Beaver has spoken."</p>
               <p>Then Killbuck, more fiercely and vehemently:</p>
               <p>"We know well what the English want. Your own traders say that you intend to take
                  all our lands, and destroy us. It is you who have begun the war. Why do
                     <emph>you</emph> come here to fight? How have you treated the Delawares? You
                  know how the Iroquois deceived us into acting as peace mediators; how they shamed
                  us, and took our arms; put petticoats on us; called us women, and made us move
                  three times away from our homes. And why? Because the English paid them a few
                  beads and blankets and paint, and when their senses were stolen away with
                  firewater, they sold our lands; but we tell you this must cease. We are no longer
                  women, but"—striking his breast—"<emph>men</emph>—men who can strike and kill
                  and—"</p>
               <p>"Yes!" hissed out old Shingiss, springing to his feet, rising to his full stature,
                  his wicked little eyes flashing a venomous fire. "We are <emph>men,</emph> and no
                  longer women! We have thrown off the petticoat of the squaw, and have seized the
                  keen tomahawk of the 'brave!' I speak"—stamping his foot—"as one standing on his
                  own ground. Why do you come to fight on our land? Keep away! both French and
                  English. The English are poor and stingy. They give us nothing but a few beads,
                  some bad rum, and old, worn-out guns, which kick back and break to pieces; and
                  their traders cheat us and fool our squaws and maidens. But I tell you we wont
                  suffer it longer.</p>
               <p>"Look! brother, and you, 'La Carrabine Noir!' We don't want to be rich, and take
                  what others have. The Great Spirit has given you the tame beasts. We don't ask for
                  them. He has given us deer and bear and buffalo, and we rejoice and thank Him for
                  it. We are but a handful to what you are; but remember, when you hunt for a
                  rattlesnake, it is so little it hides itself under the bushes; you cannot find it,
                  but perhaps it will bite you before you see it. We are told—and we sometimes
                  believe it—that you and the French have contrived this war between you to waste
                  the Indians and divide their lands. We are all cut up by the two, as cloth is cut
                  between the blades of a pair of shears. We are better than you, for when we take
                  prisoners, we adopt them and treat them just as our own flesh and blood. We are
                  poor, and yet we clothe them well as we can, though you. know our children are
                  naked, as at first. Now, brother, if anybody strikes you three times, you sit
                  still and think; he strikes you again, then, my brothers, you say it is time, and
                  you will rise up and defend yourselves.</p>
               <p>"See here!" he continued, vehemently, stooping and taking up some little twigs
                  from the ground; "our runners watch your army every day. The dandy soldiers
                     don't<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7175-00000050"/> know how to fight; we kill ten
                  for one. Too much Quaker, too much big-wig there! Here's the way they march
                  through the woods—so,"—placing the twigs all close together. "We'll shoot you down
                  like pigeons on a roost. The English people are fools; they hold their guns
                  half-man high, and then let them snap. We take sight and pick off the leaders, and
                  so do the French. We don't shoot with one bullet, but on top we put six swan shot.
                  We wont meet you in open field, but where there are plenty of trees and ambushes.
                  Look out! look out! I warn you one, two, three times," and the old king whirled
                  his tomahawk into a tree close by, and sat down, fairly livid and shaking with
                  passion.</p>
               <p>These hot, jerky sentences, coming fast and thick from Shingiss, meant something,
                  as was afterwards proved along the whole frontier line of Pennsylvania, which
                  repeatedly felt his cruel hand. Of him Heckewelder, the missionary, who was better
                  acquainted with the Indians of that day than any man in the colonies, writes:
                  "Were his war exploits all on record, they would form an interesting document,
                  though a shocking one. Gonacocheaque, Big Cove, Sherman's Valley, and other
                  settlements along the frontier, felt his strong arm. Sufficient that he was a
                  bloody warrior—cruel his treatment, relentless his fury; his person was small, but
                  in point of courage and activity and savage prowess, he was said never to be
                  excelled by any one.</p>
               <p>Our scouts heard these fierce, scornful and indignant utterances one after the
                  other, in silence, but with astonishment. The Half-King, especially, was much more
                  moved than he cared to show. Accustomed to the deference, and even submissiveness
                  to the Six Nations so long shown by the Delawares and Shawnees, he now saw they
                  had passed utterly from his authority, and had not only sided with the French, but
                  had clearly set up for themselves. He had listened courteously, but with
                  unquailing eye, to each speaker, and after a brief pause, replied, with
                  dignity:</p>
               <p>"Enough. The great chiefs have spoken in council, and the dust is cleared from my
                  eyes. Scarooyaddy takes back in sorrow the despised peace-belt. He feels better
                  than you what all this means. He has lived long both among English and Iroquois,
                  and knows their power. They're like the fish in yonder river, or like the leaves
                  on these trees, for number. They'll grind you to powder. There will not even a
                  squaw be left to say, 'This was the land of the Mohicans. The Great Manitou was
                  angry with his children, and swept them all away.' The Half-King is sad. Will
                  Shingiss give us a birch to cross the Oh-hee-yo?"</p>
               <p>"Shingiss will paddle you himself; but you're mad to cross there, Chief! You know
                  well that from Sawcunk" [now Beaver] "to the fort, it is the Shawanos country,
                  lined with their towns, and just now the war-path of all braves going to
                  Duquesne." (See <hi rend="i"/>Appendix G.)</p>
               <p>"It matters not. The Black Rifle <emph>must</emph> cross to the other side, and
                  Scarooyaddy goes with him, even though every tree covered a painted warrior."</p>
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> risk much, and <emph>I</emph> risk much to cross in open day,"
                  more softly spoke the old Delaware; "but you're safe in my lodge; stay till
                  setting of the sun. Shingiss' wife lies near death. Even as you came, Killbuck,
                  our Chief Medicine, was calling on the Great Spirit. I see, too, your belt is
                  drawn tight, and your arm hangs idle; you must have food and medicine." And the
                  old king strode over, with short and rapid steps, and examined the Half-King's
                  wounded arm, and commanded fish and venison to be brought, and a swathing of
                  chewed sassafras and wood herbs to be applied to the wound.</p>

               <p>THE two scouts partook heartily of the simple meal, which both needed badly, and,
                  much refreshed, asked again for a canoe. Shingiss bade them enter one close at
                  hand, and he and King Beaver took up the paddles, Scarooyaddy first assuring them
                  that they were neither after scalps, nor were they going to scout about the fort,
                  but chose this route rather than the other of getting back to Braddock, as being
                  safer. It was the truth, but not the <emph>whole</emph> truth.</p>
               <p>The canoe was headed somewhat up stream, and landed on the edge of a dense grove
                  of elm and walnut. The two chiefs, after advising our friends to keep off the
                  fort-trail, and move straight across the bottom, so as to strike the Allegheny
                  above Shannopinstown, where they could easily find a canoe, here bade them
                  farewell, and were out again into the stream. They would keep their secret, but
                  could not, without themselves incurring suspicion, guide them further.</p>
               <p>The scouts, with stealthy tread and with extreme caution, pausing at each moment
                  to cast about the most searching glances, were soon beyond the beaten trail
                  leading to the fort. So much gained.</p>
               <p>Scarooyaddy now most earnestly, and even passionately, insisted with his friend,
                  that in case of meeting with a strong party of Indians—than which nothing was more
                  likely—the two should at once separate, Jack going in the direction originally
                  intended, while he himself would strive to divert the chase, so as to allow Jack
                  to reach and save Marie and her father. To this proposition Jack would not listen
                  for a moment, but his mouth was stopped by the Half-King saying:</p>
               <p>"No word more. It <emph>must</emph> be so. Scarooyaddy is now old, but there was
                  once a maiden dear to him as the dew to the flower. What use for a brother if he
                  cannot risk something? His rashness has led you into this trouble, and, if need
                  be, he alone must get you out of it. Think of the Wood-thrush and the old
                  bird-hunter, with his locks of snow."</p>
               <p>Seeing the chief obstinate in his purpose, Jack was fain to submit. The trial came
                  soon enough. They were threading the tangled, wild woods with their accustomed
                  wariness, when suddenly they met, in full front, a party of eight or ten Shawnees,
                  marching along in usual Indian file, chatting and laughing merrily together, and
                  certainly expecting no enemies in <emph>this</emph> quarter. Both scouts
                  instinctively glided behind two large basswoods, but too late to escape
                  notice.</p>
               <p>As bad luck would have it, this was a Shawnee scouting party which had long been
                  following Braddock's army, and were now returning, decked with scalps and laden<pb
                     n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7175-00000052"/> with spoil, to the village situated on
                  what is now called Montour's, or Seven Mile Island. The leader in front—a sinewy
                  and stalwart chief, by the name of Kustaloge—who was well acquainted with the
                  persons of both Jack and the Half-King, and who had just heard of their escape
                  that morning under the guns of the fort, came to a sudden stop in his tracks,
                  giving a low cluck of alarm to his fol-fowers, and distinctly hissing out the
                  dreaded name—"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">La Carrabine Noir!</foreign>" All was still
                  in an instant. Every man stole behind his nearest tree, and prepared for action.
                  The whole party vanished like magic. The "plaided warriors" of Roderick Dhu sank
                  not out of sight sooner or more completely.</p>
               <p>Scarooyaddy, counting on the party's ignorance of late events, and whispering Jack
                  to edge off fast as possible, came out from behind his tree, his hand advanced in
                  a friendly attitude, and a pleasant speech upon his lips. The sullen, defiant look
                  of Kustaloge; the easily detected gesture to his followers, in obedience to which
                  they commenced to glide from tree to tree in a semicircle, so as to surround, at
                  once told the Half-King that <emph>that</emph> fetch would not serve. They two
                  were known.</p>
               <p>It was either fight, flight, or capture.</p>
               <p>Just as Kustaloge hastily took sight to shoot, Scarooyaddy, without a moment's
                  pause, changed his whole tactics. With his well arm, which happened to be the
                  right one, he whipped out his keen tomahawk, and hurled it with full force at his
                  foe, and then bounded off straight towards the fort. It was the <emph>only</emph>
                  direction now open to him.</p>
               <p>Kustaloge, struck fairly in the breast, reeled and fell, just as his piece went
                  off in the air. At the same instant, the sharp crack of Jack's rifle chimed in,
                  taking the exposed front of a red-skin who was just peeping out from behind his
                  tree for a shot. Jack, too, waited not to see the effect of his aim—though he
                  seldom made mistakes—but broke through the thin line in front, and bounded off in
                  long leaps in the direction agreed on.</p>
               <p>The fell of the Chief and one of their best fighters, stunned and confused for a
                  moment or two the remaining Indians. Gathering about the fallen with angry cries,
                  they fiercely gesticulated for a brief time, but soon—at the hurried command of
                  the next chief in rank—they separated in pursuit—only two following Jack, while
                  the rest dashed after the Half-King, perhaps because he was the more hated of the
                  two for having dropped their Chief, or because, from the direction he ran, he had
                  the least chance of escape.</p>
               <p>They gave him but short breathing spell. Gathering on his track like a pack of
                  wolves, they bounded off in pursuit. It was a race for dear life, in which every
                  nerve was strained, every muscle taxed. The Half-King had a long start, and
                  managed, by almost superhuman effort, to keep up the interval. He ran till the
                  sweat poured off in great drops, and until his veins stood out like whip-cords. He
                  had, early in the race, managed, unseen, to chuck and wedge his gun in behind a
                  log over which he leaped, and to cover it with leaves. The relief from this gave
                  him great advantage. He made his way directly to a narrow branch of the river,
                  which ran behind a low and densely-wooded island just opposite the fort, long
                  afterward called Smoky Island. No vestige of it now remains.</p>
               <p>Here the swift current of the Allegheny coursed and chafed like a mill-race,
                  eating out the earth beneath the huge sycamores, and leaving along that side of
                  the island farthest from the fort, a reach of deep and comparatively still water,
                  its surface only crumpled with whirling eddies and bubbles. Choosing a position on
                  a fallen log, which lay right on the margin of this swift water, and directly
                  opposite and enormous buttonwood, whose, huge, massive<pb n="102-103"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000053"/> roots, projecting into and over the current, had
                  collected quite a drift of old logs, branches, bark, and other floating riff-raff,
                  he waited patiently.</p>
               <p>On this log, hot, panting, and distressed, the Half-King quietly sat, every moment
                  recovering the breath now so nearly spent. Soon his pursuers hove in sight, and
                  the foremost, seeing in the distance the scout sitting despairingly on the river's
                  edge, set up a fierce yell, which was echoed by each as they one by one panted
                  into sight.</p>

               <p>SCAROOYADDY sat perfectly calm and still while his pursuers closed in upon him.
                  They had him now; there could be no escape. He had evidently been driven to bay.
                  Waiting till the foremost was almost within tomahawk-throw, the Chief slowly
                  arose, and looking around, as if confusedly, on his tormentors, began to chant his
                  death-song. He then, just as his first foe raised his tomahawk for the fatal cast,
                  suddenly sprang into the water, and struck out for the island. He seemingly
                  preferred drowning to capture and torture. Shortly his first pursuer leaped upon
                  the log, and soon as breath was given him to take any aim, fired at the swimmer.
                  The scout sank, rose to the surface, tossed his arms wildly above him, sank again,
                  and finally, with a despairing cry, and throwing the whole upper part of his body
                  into the air, he went down for the last time, not ten feet from the island, and
                  just where the current was deepest.</p>
               <p>The gurgling and disturbed waters soon closed over his<pb n="104"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000054"/> head, and nothing but little eddies and pursuing
                  and ever widening circles of waves, marked the spot of his last exit.</p>
               <p>Even his cruel foes watched his dying agonies with silence; and when his struggles
                  ceased altogether, and the swift waters grew more placid over the spot where he
                  disappeared, only one yell gave note of the fact. During the rest of the afternoon
                  many Indians of prominence came over to the Island from the fort, to see the very
                  place where the famed Iroquois Sachem last sank. Those who witnessed it narrated
                  the circumstances with eloquence and graphic detail, while many of the Half-King's
                  admirers, and those, too, who owed him allegiance, recounted his virtues and
                  lamented the untimely death of so great a chief, blaming it on the French and
                  English, whose quarrel was involving old friends as well as foes.</p>
               <p>As for Jack, <emph>his</emph> chase was much less pressing; but two Shawnees
                  followed him, and these apparently not over-anxious to bring him to a close
                  encounter. He led straight across the broad level stretching between the Ohio and
                  Allegheny. Loading his rifle as he ran—a practice he had taught himself by long
                  and careful trials—at the first favorable opportunity he aimed at the foremost
                  Indian, and must have wounded him, as he dropped altogether out of the course.</p>
               <p>The remaining one, a big, burly, strapping fellow, followed on, getting closer and
                  closer, until at length he fired a long shot, which whizzed most uncomfortably
                  near Jack's ears, and just as he was approaching the brow of a declivity on which
                  lay a huge log. On top of this Jack leaped, then turned, and giving forth a
                  defiant yell, made a downward plunge. Soon, however, as he touched ground, he
                  turned straight around, and crept back, snugging himself up close under the

               <p>Shortly the big Indian jumped upon the fallen trunk, blowing like a porpoise, and,

                  </figure> around, also made the down ward leap. With a low, sharp cry, out sprang
                  Jack like a panther, on the Indian's very back and shoulders, actually bearing him
                  to the earth by his weight and impetus.</p>
               <p>Both fell together, but before his unwieldy adversary could recover breath, or
                  wake up from his daze, Jack's knee was on his breast, and both arms were securely
                  pinioned and held as in a vice. The Indian puffed, and struggled, and rolled his
                  eyes, more in surprise and dismay than in ferocity, but all fight was evidently
                  run and knocked out of him.</p>
               <p>"Look here, my good Indian," quietly, and almost mildly, spoke Jack in English,
                  scarcely knowing or caring whether it was understood or not, "you're fearfully
                  blown and out of wind. Another half mile, and you'd have exploded. Why, you're a
                  perfect Falstaff of a reddy, and must have ransacked a broad neck o' woods for
                  your keep. Now, I'm not out after scalps, but on very different business; besides,
                  you're Shawnee, and not my kind. I'll let your back hair grow where it's rooted,
                  if you'll promise to roost on yonder log, let me alone, and pay your whole
                  attention to coaxing back your wind."</p>
               <p>"Ugh! The Black Rifle—never see him before. Great white brave; now I see him."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and feel him, too; and the more you see him, the less you'll like him, if
                  you don't behave yourself and be amiable. What say you, must I brain you, or will
                  you promise? It wouldn't be healthy to make a fight."</p>
               <p>"I sit on log; after while, go back to my friend, The Hungry Wolf. The Black Rifle
                  has struck him. Let me see the great Medicine gun," laying violent hold of Jack's
                  rifle.</p>
               <p>"Now, none of that, if you're wise, or you're a dead and scalped Indian! Hold!
                  think I had better tie you. Don't like the roll of your eye or the grit of your
                  teeth; in fact,<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7175-00000056"/> you don't look one bit
                  handsome; and, bless me! why the fat and sweat's coming through your tawny hide
                  like a sieve!" and Jack proceeded to draw some thongs—with which all hunters were
                  provided—from his pouch, and to bind them firmly about the Indian's elbows. The
                  Shawnee commenced to heave, and wriggle, and struggle, until Jack brought down his
                  closed fist on the Indian's painted sconce.</p>
               <p>"Wont you be quiet, you—you big booby you? Be thankful that gentle thump was not
                  from the butt end of a tomahawk. 'Twould have made your head ache and your teeth
                  rattle. Why so foolish, gentle Injun?"</p>
               <p>The Shawnee made no further resistance, Jack tying both elbows, and fastening the
                  knot behind his back. He then laid him in an easy position, stuffed some leaves
                  and grass under his hideous old head, gave him a swig of rum from his flask, lit
                  him his pipe of sumach, and left him, pleasantly remarking:</p>
               <p>"Upon my word, Shawnee, I hate to leave you, you look so uncommon chipper-like and
                  comfortable. But don't thank me for it, but your bellows, which work badly, very.
                  You must eat more corn and venison, and less possum and raccoon. Good-evening, old
                  swell-head, and pleasant dreams to you. I have a trysting to keep."</p>
               <p>The prostrate Shawnee grinned a ghastly smile, followed Jack's retreating form
                  with a horrible leer, sighed like a furnace, and coaxed hardly for release; but
                  the scout only laughed, shouting back, "Not any tobacco, thank you; I never smoke
                  on a war-trail, I'm much obliged to you. Now <emph>do</emph> try and compose
                  yourself; a little nap would do you <emph>ever</emph> so much good; and bye-bye,
                  bub!"</p>
               <p>Jack, knowing well that pursuers would soon be on his track, hurriedly strode
                  along, coming out upon the Allegheny and proceeding a long way up its bank, until
                  he came to a large run, about three miles above the fort, and at whose mouth lay a
                  single canoe.</p>
               <p>Instead of embarking directly, he kept cautiously off; made his way up the run a
                  quarter of a mile; waded down stream to the mouth; carefully pulled the canoe off
                  by the water end, and was soon in the dense woods on the other side of the
                  Allegheny. Here he lay concealed till nightfall, whence his way to De Bonneville's
                  forest retreat was easy and without further adventure.</p>

               <p>AND what, all this time, happened Gist, Fairfax and Talbot? When they turned off
                  at right-angles from the brow of Coal Hill, they continued straight back until
                  they came to a deep valley, through which meandered a run of considerable size.
                  Hunting out a rocky shore, so that no foot-prints might reveal their course, the
                  whole party—much to the disgust of the dainty Lord Talbot—entered it, and waded
                  along for at least half a mile.</p>
               <p>To this course Talbot protested most strenuously. To be sure, "water left no
                  trail," but at the same time, the sharp stones cut and bruised his tender feet,
                  for he had insisted on carrying his boots and stockings and wading bare-foot.
                  "What a picture I would present, to be sure," he said to Gist, "tramping over
                  these horrible, rough mountains, and through these infernal jungles, with my wet
                  boots pumping water, and flop, flop, flopping at every stride! I positively
                  decline to do it—would rather risk capture and torture by the natives."</p>
               <p>Emerging from the run, with the same precautions as on entering it, the party kept
                  back another two miles, and came to a halt before a rocky cavern, where it was
                  proposed to stay until evening and then continue their course in safety. Picking
                  their way, they entered—under noisy protest from the Englishman—the low, damp and
                  dark cave, and made themselves comfortable as possible until noon, when Talbot,
                  who had steadily kept up a running alternation of grumbles and mild swears, could
                  stand it no longer.</p>
               <p>"Captain Gist, this is shocking!—<emph>perfectly horrible!</emph> I'm neither a
                  clam, nor the son of a clam, that I must endure this abominable wetness. There's
                  been a stream of water—foul, dirty, nasty water, at that—trickling down my back
                  for an hour. Nothing but a snail, a toad, or a vampire bat could stand
                     <emph>this!</emph> The silence, too, is awful—dreadful! It appals me! It takes
                  the starch right out of me. I'd as lief stay in a charnel house, hob-nobbing with
                  cold, clammy corpses, as in this dark, damp, doleful, dismal, dirty, dreary,
                  dreadful, damnable dungeon—<emph>there's</emph> alliteration for you! Besides, I
                  don't believe there's a red-skin within miles of us. I move we go on; I am anxious
                  to get back to camp."</p>
               <p>"Lord Talbot," said Gist, "Fairfax and I think this cave, damp and uncomfortable
                  as it is, much the safest place. You know as little of American woods and Indian
                  ways and deviltries as a baby; if you leave this secure shelter, you do it at your
                  own risk."</p>
               <p>"Enough! <emph>Anything</emph> but this horrid, slimy place. I will, at any rate,
                  get out into the sunlight, and take the kinks out of my back and legs. Gad! I feel
                  like a packed sandwich, or a smoked herring. Will be back in a jiffy."</p>
               <p>And out he crept, gun in hand, looking around for Indian<pb n="110-111"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000058"/> dian signs, as wise as an owl. All sunlight and
                  pleasantness. The birds were singing, the wild bees humming, the butterflies
                  fluttering from flower to flower, the leaves were whispering to each other
                  overhead, but no sign of aught else. "What prudent old grannies these American
                  hunters are, to be sure," thought Talbot, as he wandered further and further down
                  the valley. "They make more fuss over a moccasin print, than we of the 30th did in
                  India over the 'spoor' of a tiger or a wild elephant. Hanged if I don't soon 'cut'
                  the whole connection, and go it on my own hook!"</p>
               <p>Very soon Talbot sat down at the foot of a hollow beech, to watch the playful
                  gambols of a couple of young hares, and was just commencing to hum a favorite
                  tune, when, happening to look back, he thought he saw, away off, an Indian coming
                  at right-angles to the course he had taken. His heart was in his throat in an
                  instant. On a second sight, his thought became fact.</p>
               <p>The Indian was crossing Talbot's path, when all at once he paused, and looked
                  quickly and carefully around. He then stopped, and commenced examining the grass,
                  assuming a crouching posture.</p>
               <p>"What is the painted omadhoun doing?" thought Talbot. "I haven't a moment to lose;
                  he might chance to come along here; nothing for it but to mount the tree, should
                  he pass this way." Talbot then concealed his gun in the hollow, and, with much
                  difficulty, managed to climb to the lowest limb, and swing himself up into the
                  tree.</p>
               <p>Then, mounting to a higher notch, he sat contentedly, curiously and speculatively
                  watching the motions of the Indian, who first looked up, then down, then all
                  around. Finally, with eyes still on the ground, he advanced Talbot's way. He
                  swerved neither to right nor left, for Talbot left a trail like a buffalo, that
                     <emph>any</emph> Indian could follow. He came straight up to the beech, looked
                  in the hollow, saw the carbine, and started back with a sudden exclamation; got
                  behind the next tree, and then cautiously peered out on every side. Knowing that
                  Talbot's track led only to, and not <emph>from</emph> the tree, his glance then
                  went upward. With a shudder that shook his whole frame, Talbot soon felt the
                  savage's baleful eye dead upon him.</p>
               <p>With a <emph>ugh!</emph> the fellow seized his rifle, raised it to his shoulder,
                  "drew a bead" on him, and in an instant would have brought down his gay bird, had
                  not Talbot hastily exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"See here! Mr. Indian, hold! I beg you. For God's sake, don't shoot! I'll come
                  down."</p>
               <p>The wondering savage paused, without lowering his piece, or taking off Talbot his
                  glittering eye.</p>
               <p>"Halloo, I say! For mercy's sake, take the mouth of that dreadful blunderbuss from
                  off me! It puts me all of a tremble. By jove! fellow, don't you understand King
                  George's English?"</p>
               <p>The rifle was lowered, the Indian gazing at Talbot with an undisguised curiosity,
                  not knowing what course to pursue.</p>
               <p>"That's better! I breathe much freer, I'll now come down and surrender myself
                  prisoner of war; but what a pickle I'm in, and what a spectacle I present! I wish
                  my mother could see me now; she'd not know her oldest."</p>
               <p>The Indian, who seemed, happily, to be good-natured enough, advanced and took
                  possession of the carbine, and then quietly waited Talbot's descent. As the latter
                  was coming down from limb to limb, he made a false step, a branch broke, and over
                  he tumbled, right on top of the savage, who was doubled up in an instant and
                  brought violently to the earth.</p>
               <p>He leaped up in a moment, mad as a hornet; drew his scalping knife, pounced upon
                  poor Talbot, whose breath was knocked out of him, and twisted his fingers in
                     the<pb n="112 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7175-00000059"/> young lord's long
                  locks, and was just about to cut the fatal circle, when behold! the whole
                  confounded thing came off in his hand!</p>
               <p>The scene was ludicrous in the extreme. This far-away Shawnee chief had never seen
                  or heard of <emph>wigs,</emph> and he stood perfectly aghast and stupefied; his
                  mouth open, his eyes big as saucers; first looking at the wig, and then at Talbot,
                  who was now prostrate and peeled like any onion. It was some time before the
                  amazed red-skin recovered from his astonishment; until even Talbot, desperate as
                  his situation was, commenced to enjoy the scene. At last the Chief cautiously put
                  out his hand and felt all over Talbot's cropped head. This was too much for the
                  latter, and he fairly laughed out, saying:</p>
               <p>"You think, big Injun, I'm a very little 'pale-face' to have so much hair. Well,
                  it <emph>did</emph> rather stunt me to grow it all, and in separate lots, too; but
                  you'll admit it's very convenient among you savages. Now, if you're done with my
                  scalp, I'll put it on again," and Talbot took the wig from his non-resisting
                  hands, and set it on his head.</p>
               <p>The Indian took it off and put it on several times, before he fairly understood
                  the "wrinkle," and then he brought out a cumulative, guttural roar, which seemed
                  to be gathered away up from his moccasins; which convulsed his burly frame, and
                  which he intended for a laugh.</p>
               <p>One would think, to see the two together, that they had been cronies from youth.
                  Talbot seemed to enjoy the joke even more than his companion. He could well afford
                  it, for his wig had saved his life.</p>
               <p>All at once a bright thought seemed to seize the puzzled Indian, which came from a
                  long and careful scrutiny of Talbot's dress, ruffles, and delicate features.</p>
               <p>He sprang up, saying, in his broken English:</p>
               <p>"Come! little 'two-scalps,' go to Nymwha's lodge and be his squaw. Him thought you
                  a 'brave;' now he know better.</p>
               <p>

               <pb n="113" xml:id="VAC7175-00000060"/>
               <p>Talbot jumped as if bit by a rattlesnake. He fairly danced and pranced with
                  indignation.</p>
               <p>"You old, painted, heathen scare-crow! what in Gód's name do you take me for—a
                  woman? Say it again, and I'll brain you with your own tomahawk!" And then,
                  pensively, to himself: "Who'd have thought I'd ever lived to be taken for a female
                  woman, by a North American savage? What would my old Governor and Lady Grace say
                  to that? By the lord Harry, the thought stuns me! I'm faint! I'm going to die!"
                  The good-natured Indian looked amusingly on, not understanding the drift of
                  Talbot's words, and apologetically remarked:</p>
               <p>"No hoe corn in Nymwha's wigwam—much meat, nice birds, good hominy, only two
                  squaws, plenty papooses—"</p>
               <p>"What! By jove, I'm not equal to this last! Here! Indian, strike me dead; I'm
                  tired of life! There's my scalp!" and he whisked off his wig and hurled it at the
                  Chief's head. Then, springing up, he took him by the shoulders, and shook him with
                  all his strength, and shouted in his ear:</p>
               <p>"Know that I'm a man, and a warrior like yourself! and if you ever again call me
                  woman—even so much as name <hi rend="i"/>squaw to me—I'll—I'll—well, upon my word,
                  I don't know what I <emph>would</emph> do, except swoon, the whole thing's so
                  perfectly absurd;" and here the amusing side of the joke took him, and he laughed
                  till he cried.</p>
               <p>Finally Nymwha—for that was the name of the old Shawnee Chief—said: "Well, you
                  vely funny' pale-face;' if you warrior, come with me to big gun house" [Fort
                  Duquesne]; "but where the Indian and the other 'pale-face?' They near here? Come!
                  I must get on trail again. I'm Nymwha, which mean in Anglish,
                  'trailing-wolf.'"</p>
               <p>"No use, Nymwha! if that's your name. They went back to Braddock hours ago." Then
                  to himself: "I hope I'll be forgiven for that whopper."</p>
               <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7175-00000061"/>
               <p>"And why you no go with them?" looking at him suspiciously.</p>
               <p>"Look at my feet, stupid! and ask that question; couldn't walk. I was to wait till
                  night, and was to meet a party sent out for me;" and then, with an appearance of
                  great indignation: "Do you doubt me? Don't you believe the word of an English
                  gentleman? and"—<foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce</foreign>—"he lying to you as
                  fast as he can."</p>
               <p>"Me no much understand; but if they go or stay, all the same. Heaps of warriors in
                  the woods. Burn them up at big gun house. No burn you. I lose a good son; you take
                  his place and be Indian."</p>
               <p>"Ah, now, my big old papa, you talk sense, and don't insult me. Lead on to the
                  fort! It cannot be but a few days before Braddock will own it, and all inside and
                  about it. Ah, <emph>he's</emph> a chief for you! He'll scatter you wild Indians
                  like leaves before a tornado."</p>
               <p>And so the two took up their line of march to the Monongahela, the Chief in high
                  good humor walking behind, carrying Talbot's carbine, and every now and then
                  laying his huge paw lightly and caressingly on Talbot's wig, feeling of his velvet
                  coat, fingering his lace ruffles, and evidently highly delighted with his
                  prize.</p>
               <p>It was late in the afternoon, when Talbot stood behind the very same log, on the
                  hill opposite the fort, which he had so hurriedly left in the morning. A feeling
                  of sadness stole over him, and it was with greatly changed emotions that he now
                  looked abroad at the fort, and saw it surrounded by Indians, many of whom were
                  even then engaged in a game something like "leap-frog." For the first time an
                  anxiety as to what might be his fate, began to oppress him.</p>
               <p>Talbot, though small and gently nurtured, was brave as Julius Cæsar, but the
                  appearance of so many yelling savages was enough to appal a stouter heart than
                  his. The brawny Chief seemed actually to have taken a desperate liking to the
                  young lord. He had never seen anything like him before, and tried all he could to
                  be friendly.</p>
               <p>"Now! little 'two-scalps,' watch! see what a stir-up I make down there."</p>
               <p>He then sprang on the log and gave a long yell, followed by a succession of quick,
                  shrill shouts of joy and triumph, understood to indicate that a prisoner had been
                  taken. Then, laughingly pointing to Talbot's wig, said: "I now make
                     '<emph>scalp</emph>-halloo.'" This was a far different kind of yell. The effect
                  of both was magical.</p>
               <p>All who had been at play, left their games and gathered on the bluff. Each hut and
                  tent poured forth its contribution; the soldiers and cadets, too, gathered on the
                  ramparts, and all that were not then out on the hunt after Braddock's scouting
                  parties, were assembled to see whether it was Jack, the Half-King, or some one
                  else who was scalped or prisoner. All was joy—dancing, shouting, and firing of big
                  and little guns.</p>
               <p>Soon a couple of canoes pushed off for the opposite shore, when Nymwha and his
                  captive, looking forlorn and disconsolate enough, commenced their descent to meet
                  them. When they reached the beach, Talbot, looking as indifferent and defiant as
                  he could, unflinchingly bore the scrutinizing glances cast at him. It must be
                  confessed, he presented a rather sorry appearance. With his fine clothes all
                  ruffled, besmirched, and in many places torn by thorns and briars, and with his
                  poor wig all awry and dishevelled, he was more the object of an amused curiosity
                  than of any fierceness of looks.</p>
               <p>He had scarce entered the canoe, before a low but earnest conversation sprang up
                  among the paddlers, and Nymwha was evidently being called to account for the
                  "scalphalloo" he had given without any scalp to show for it; but<pb n="116-117"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000062"/> he, laughing inwardly, sat like a Stoic, and waved
                  off all explanation.</p>
               <p>Poor Talbot had now a most trying ordeal to undergo. A dense crowd was assembled
                  on the other side; shore and bluff and rampart were lined with spectators, and as
                  he stepped out of the canoe, every eye was levelled at him. The same curiosity and
                  surprise were manifest here as on the other side. The young lord felt so keenly
                  his situation, and was so conscious himself of the ludicrous appearance he
                  presented, that if he had seen a laugh on the face of any spectator, he would have
                  rushed forward and struck it off. None but Indians directly around—not an officer
                  or soldier from the fort, though it was but a couple of hundred yards distant.</p>

               <p>THE party had scarce gained the bluff, before a number of Indians, dressed only in
                  their breech-clouts, and freshly and hideously painted in divers colors—chiefly
                  vermilion—made their appearance, ran hastily forward, and ranged themselves in two
                  ranks, about a rod or so apart. Here, also, a murmur arose against Nymwha for
                  giving the "scalp-halloo," and no scalp taken. He, however, bore it all very
                  patiently, telling Talbot, as well as he could in his broken English, that it was
                  an old Indian custom that when a prisoner was taken, he must "run the gauntlet,"
                  and the faster he ran, the better it would be for him; and if he could get into
                  any hut by the way, or as soon as he reached the end of the files, he would then
                  be perfectly safe.</p>
               <p>This was unwelcome news to Talbot, who felt outraged at such treatment of a
                  prisoner, and indignant that the French did not interfere to relieve him from so
                  great an insult. No help for it, however. The double file seemed good-natured
                  enough, and many of them apparently very much interested in his favor.</p>
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7175-00000063"/>
               <p>Just as all was ready for the trial, the grave and dignified Delaware, King
                  Beaver, who had by this time come up from Shingiss' camp, stepped forward, and
                  pointing to the prisoner, made an effective little speech, which evidently told in
                  Talbot's favor. He was followed by Athanase, the Christianized Mohawk from Quebec
                  and the great Chief alluded to as listening to De Bonneville's flute the night
                  before. They had probably directed attention to Talbot's slight form and delicate
                  appearance, so different from what they were accustomed to see. At any rate, all
                  guns and clubs were cast aside, and nothing but ramrods, switches, twisted
                  blankets, etc., retained.</p>
               <p>All was now ready, when suddenly Talbot's captor arose with an air of great
                  solemnity, led him forward, and seated him directly between the two files.
                  Stooping down, he whispered:</p>
               <p>"You no fear; me no hurt my son; me make much fun, and save you a good
                  beating."</p>
               <p>Then, stepping back and resuming his solemn looks, he commenced a speech to the
                  wondering lookers-on from many different tribes, in which he alluded to the
                  murmurs against him for giving the "scalp-halloo" without a scalp, and now he
                  would show them one; with that, he uttered a fierce yell, whisked out his keen
                  blade, sprang to Talbot with a single bound, and twining his fingers in his long,
                  curling locks, he drew the knife lightly around the crown, and brandished the wig
                  in the air.</p>
               <p>Several of the chiefs, and even two French officers from the fort, rushed forward
                  to stay his ruthless hand, but it was too late. Soon as the deed was done, Nymwha
                  emitted a most terrific "scalp-halloo," which made the hills around fairly ring
                  with echoes, and which struck horror into the hearts of the soldiers and cadets
                  who lined the ramparts.</p>
               <p>The effect of this tragical and totally unexpected act was magical. The perfect
                  stillness wag succeeded by great noise and confusion. On seeing Talbot's under
                  crop of hair, the amazement was conspicuously ludicrous; but the soldiers, and the
                  more knowing of the Indians—those who had mingled much with the whites and visited
                  their cities—immediately began to appreciate the joke, for joke it was.</p>
               <p>It was some time, however, before the puzzled and stupefied mob could understand
                  the double-scalp arrangement, but when they <emph>did,</emph> all fierceness and
                  anger had fled, and they crowded around Talbot, roughly feeling his real and his
                  artificial hair with the greatest curiosity, and giving out loud guffaws of the
                  most uproarious laughter; indeed, some of the inveterate wags and jokers—and what
                  nation has not its funny men?—seemed as if they would hurt themselves at the
                  sight. They twisted, and wriggled, and rolled on the ground in fits of
                  uncontrollable merriment.</p>
               <p>For the second time Talbot's wig had saved him, and he was actually beginning to
                  be so exceedingly popular that his patience was sorely tried. At last he could
                  stand it no longer, so he cried out to his captor, to whom this was evidently the
                  biggest and most successful joke of his life, and who was standing by pompously
                  doing the honors and grinning from ear to ear:</p>
               <p>"'Tis time this farce and tom-foolery was about done! I'm as little of a clown as
                  I am of a woman, and I'd rather be scourged by your infernal demons from one end
                  of the ranks to the other, than to be held up as an object of ridicule. Take me to
                  the fort at once! I must and will see its craven commander and call him to
                  account."</p>
               <p>"'Little two-scalps' must run the gauntlet; 'tis an old and strong custom, but
                  Nymwha has now taken all the hurt out of it. Here! take this!" and he secretly
                  filled Talbot's hands with fine sand from the beach. "When Indian go hurt you,
                  throw in him eye."</p>
               <p>"Good! I'll do it. If I <emph>must</emph> run, I must; so here goes,"<pb
                     n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7175-00000064"/> and, jumping up suddenly, he had gone
                  half way down the course before the by-standers could collect to flog him. He
                  received some sharp blows and strokes, but most were saved him by his throwing the
                  sand into the faces of those ready to strike, who jumped back rubbing their
                  smarting eyes amid the laughs and jeers of all.</p>
               <p>At the end stood one huge, ferocious looking fellow, with a club poised in air,
                  but Talbot, suddenly stooping, darted under his legs, making him turn a complete
                  somersault. Getting up bellowing with rage, he was rushing after Talbot, but was
                  held back by his laughing companions, and the trial by gauntlet was over, leaving
                  Talbot fairly bursting with shame and indignation.</p>
               <p>Just then the fort gate was opened, and Talbot crossed the draw-bridge, marched
                  scowlingly past the crowd of smiling or sympathizing Frenchers, whom he completely
                  ignored, and was taken to a rude room in Captain Dumas' quarters. Here he demanded
                  to see Beaujeu, the commandant, who after a long delay, in which Talbot had plenty
                  of time to cool down, granted him an interview, wishing, doubtless, to ascertain
                  some reliable information of the approaching army.</p>
               <p>Talbot glared at the commandant—who was a fine, dignified, and courteous officer
                  of about middle age—as if he would like to throttle him, the more especially as he
                  detected a hardly-concealed smile on Beaujeu's countenance, produced, probably, by
                  Talbot's tawdry and dilapidated appearance, and by the memory of the late scenes
                  he had just witnessed.</p>
               <p>"Captain Beaujeu, do you speak English?" brusquely commenced Talbot.</p>
               <p>"J'ai the honnaire, monsieur, to parler a verra leetle bit Anglish."</p>
               <p>"Well! if that's a sample, I'll not contradict you," saucily replied the peppery
                  and choleric young lord. "I now tell you, as soon as I can and without wasting any
                  words, that I am Lord Talbot, heir to a noble house of England, and being a peer
                  of Britain and <emph>certainly</emph> your equal in rank, I demand to know when
                  and where we can meet and with what weapons!—now and here would suit
                     <emph>me</emph> admirably!"</p>
               <p>An amused smile hovered over the pleasant face of the commandant:</p>
               <p>"Eh, bien! monsieur; I muss say votre deportment is tres extraordinaire."</p>
               <p>"Extraordinary or not, you have tamely stood by and allowed me to be insulted most
                  grossly. Never were so many shameful indignities heaped upon any one, as on me, by
                  the painted demons you call your allies, and I ask satisfaction and <emph>will
                     have it.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Parbleu! Monsieur assurément forgets to re-remember he is ze prisonnier of ze
                  Indians, and zat I can do nozzing—nozzing <foreign xml:lang="FRA">de
                     tout.</foreign> Ze Indians do wiz him as wiz all zeir prisonniers. It does say
                  in votre Anglish 'How d'ye do.' C'est cela, exactement."</p>
               <p>"Bah! all stuff and rubbish! You know better, Captain; but a <emph>real</emph>
                  commander is coming, who will teach you manners as well as the art of war."</p>
               <p>Beaujeu bowed courteously.</p>
               <p>"Monsieur muss aussi remember zat if he vaz not prisonnier of ze Indians, mes
                  soldats muss shoot him as a—a—vat you call him?—a spy."</p>
               <p>"'Tis false, I say! I'm no spy, but an amateur scout—<emph>that's</emph> good
                  French—an amateur scout!"</p>
               <p>"Excus-ez ma mauvais Anglish, monsieur, but ven you claim to be a nobleman you
                  muss nevaire forget to be a shentilman—nevaire."</p>

               <p>THE young Lord Talbot—by reason of his too great nimbleness of tongue—being now
                  safely snugged in the guard house, had plenty of leisure to bewail his fate, and
                  the rapid mutations of human affairs. His scout—entered upon with so much zest and
                  enthusiasm—had been productive of anything but pleasure. He had, in fact, seen
                  more than he bargained for. Having been, as it were, twice scalped; forced to run
                  the gauntlet; held up to ridicule in presence of his detested foes, the
                  French—whom he hated worse than he did the devil—and last, though not least, taken
                  for a "female woman" by a North American savage—all this was too much for his
                  proud and egotistical nature, and his rage was speedily succeeded by melancholy at
                  his forlorn and desolate situation.</p>
               <p>The guard house was situated within the fort, close by the rampart, and abutting
                  on the road leading to the drawbridge and the huge log gate which presented to the
                  eastern side. It was a simple shed, made—like all the other buildings<pb
                     n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7175-00000066"/> ings with which the area within the
                  fort was crowded—the front and roof of rough, sawed plank, and the back of logs,
                  placed about three feet distant from the stockades, the space between being filled
                  with earth to the height of eight feet—the stockades being about four feet
                  higher.</p>
               <p>Talbot had not lain there long until, worn out by the fatigues and excitements of
                  the day, he fell asleep, and three hours after, when Captain Dumas quietly entered
                  the room, was lying in a most profound slumber, a smile playing about his mouth,
                  and one arm thrown over his head. He looked like a young girl, so soft was his
                  smile, and so delicate were his features and whole appearance.</p>
               <p>Dumas, who bore in his hands some venison, a broiled bird, and a flaçon of
                  Bordeaux, gazed long upon the young sleeper—who seemed so utterly out of place
                  amid the rude surroundings of a backwoods camp—and an expression of interest and
                  sympathy stole over his countenance. It was some time before he ventured to
                  disturb the dreamless slumber of his prisoner; but as it was growing very late, he
                  finally shook him quietly by the shoulder, and said, in gentle tones:</p>
               <p>"Monsieur! Monsieur! awake! I bring you votre souper!"</p>
               <p>Talbot sprang up with a start, gazed around him, rubbed his eyes, gradually took
                  in the situation, and could not restrain a deep sigh from escaping him. All his
                  anger had left him, and in its place was an expression of sadness and
                  weariness.</p>
               <p>"Milord Talbot, J'espère que vous avez—ah, peste! I did forget zat you no
                  understand my langue. I muss send for un interprète."</p>
               <p>"Je crois," replied Talbot, smilingly, with infinite grace and in most excellent
                  French. "Qu'un interprète n'est pas necessaire ici. Si vous avez quelque chose à
                  dine, monsieur, à un malheureux prisonnier, je suis tout prêt. A qui est ce que
                  j'ai l'honneur à parler."</p>
               <p>A bright and friendly smile illumined Dumas' fine, soldierly face, and the
                  following conversation, which we freely translate, followed:</p>
               <p>"Parbleu! monsieur, I was told you could not speak one word of French."</p>
               <p>"Say, Captain, that I <emph>would</emph> not, and you're nearer the mark. Like
                  most well-bred Englishmen, I understand your language, and dislike your race. Your
                  commandant, especially, I have every reason to detest, for allowing an unarmed
                  prisoner to suffer such indignities as were heaped on me, and not raise a voice or
                  finger to prevent. I protest against his conduct as ungentlemanly—that's too weak
                  a word!—as cowardly in the extreme; and when I found de Beaujeu floundering along
                  in broken—I may add <emph>very</emph> broken—English, it was not for me to help
                  him out—would have died first. <emph>You</emph> look like one of a different
                  stamp—are not responsible for his demerits—and your presence in my poor quarters
                  betokens some heart."</p>
               <p>"I care not" said Dumas, with the usual French shrug and elevation of the
                  eye-brows, "to discuss the virtues of my commandant, and I beg you to spare me
                  further disparagement of him. He is not only a brave soldier, but a gentleman.
                  Milord Talbot"—bowing courteously—"is too shrewd and sensible a man to expect that
                     <emph>just now,</emph> when his army is daily expected, M. de Beaujeu would do
                  anything—even the slightest—to weaken his hold on his jealous and impatient
                  allies. Diable! monsieur, we have to do many things in this country which would be
                  thought strange and cruel at the Court of Louis XV. Will monsieur"—offering Talbot
                  a goblet of wine—"partake of some refreshments after his fatigue?"</p>
               <p>"I thank you, Captain; I'm as dry as a mummy"—taking a long and relishing draught.
                  "By jove! you seem<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7175-00000067"/> to be well
                  provisioned out in these backwoods. That wine was positively delicious—never
                  remember to have tasted finer. 'Tis enough to tempt an Anchorite or satisfy a
                  Sybarite!"</p>
               <p>"Ma foi, but monsieur speaks truth. 'Tis said in France, that his American
                  colonies have nearly ruined Louis—all outgo and no income; and you wouldn't
                  wonder, if you knew the American leeches and brigands who are spending his blood.
                  Why, this string of forts from Niagara to this point, is a very wonder for waste
                  and prodigality—all sorts of fripperies and grotesqueries out in this wilderness;
                  stuffs of silks and velvets; ladies' slippers and damask shoes; silk stockings and
                  the costliest wines of Spain and Italy. Mon Dieu, you'd think they were making
                  ready for a grand tour for our king and all his court and grand dames. But when
                  and where did you leave le General Braddock?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, some time ago, and in the woods," evasively replied Talbot.</p>
               <p>"He has a fine army. How large, monsieur, do you estimate his force?
                     <emph>We</emph> put it at four thousand," mentioning a figure far beyond the
                  reality.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Captain, I never counted it; but taking the regulars and provincials
                  together, I should think there was—quite a force."</p>
               <p>"We have here great difficulty from keeping our Indians of different tribes from
                  quarreling with each other. Does not your General fear that his Catawbas and
                  Iroquois—who have <emph>always</emph> been at war—will fall out by the way?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, not at all, Captain!" answered Talbot, with an innocent and peculiar smile
                  (there were only seven Indians with Braddock, all told); "<foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >au contraire,</foreign> they are such ardent friends, that their affection
                  extends to each other's squaws; and <emph>our</emph> great trouble is to keep them
                  from mistaking their neighbors' scalp-locks for their own. One would think,
                  Captain, that your own Indians were unruly enough to engage your whole
                  attention."</p>
               <p>Dumas bit his lips, trying to keep back a smile.</p>
               <p>"Your General moves very, very slow. We have been expecting him for weeks. He
                  evidently doesn't understand American campaigning, and has a very formal and
                  crowded way of marching."</p>
               <p>"As for your expectations," replied Talbot, "you'll not be disappointed; and he
                     <emph>has</emph> rather a <emph>formal</emph> and <emph>crowding</emph> way of
                  marching—into a place: one like this, for example!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, you need not think, milord, we are ignorant of your army and its doings. Our
                  Indian runners report to us nightly. Your soldiers cannot shoot a turkey or start
                  up a rabbit, but what we know it soon after. Occasionally they bring home a few
                  scalps or horses."</p>
               <p>"I know, Captain," tartly replied Talbot, "that our army has lost hundreds of
                  horses, and a few stragglers their scalps, since it left Fort Cumberland; but I
                  never thought I would find a French officer of the line boasting of these deeds of
                  cattle-stealers and scalp-lifters! A residence in this country must be very
                  demoralizing when a French 'regular' can take pride in the petty exploits and
                  barbarous cruelties of a low lot of heathen savages!"</p>
               <p>Dumas colored up to the very roots of his hair, when Talbot, pursuing his
                  advantage, sharply continued:</p>
               <p>"I would have you know, Captain, that our Braddock is by no means the mere Irish
                  soldier of fortune which some deem him, but a gentleman of courage, honesty and
                  capacity, who has won his honors by nearly fifty years of service. He was almost
                  born into the 'Cold Stream Guards,' and his and his father's name appear on its
                  'roster' for seventy years. The 'Guards,' you know, are our 'household troops'—the
                  crack and pet regiment of the country. Hold! Captain, were you at the battle of
                  Fontenoy, in '45, fought<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7175-00000068"/> between your
                  king, the Dauphin, and Marshal Saxe, and the English and Dutch allies, with our
                  Duke of Cumberland at the lead?"</p>
               <p>"No, monsieur, I had not that honor; I am too young in the service."</p>
               <p>"Well, Braddock <emph>had</emph> that honor; and it <emph>was</emph> an honor,
                  although our forces were defeated. 'Twas terrible slaughter, I've heard. There it
                  was the 'Cold Streams' fought like lions, and extorted the admiration of your own
                  troops, no less for their furious and desperate charges, than for their cool and
                  admirable retreat. They lost, in that action, no less than two hundred and forty
                  men; and for Braddock's share in the desperate and bloody day, he was first
                  promoted to be major, and shortly after lieutenant-colonel of these famous 'Cold
                  Streams.' 'Tis no wonder that a fifty years' connection with such a regiment—the
                  very perfection of drill and discipline—would make Braddock a rather orderly
                  marcher; you will find him an <emph>orderly</emph> fighter, too! If you wish to
                  disparage or insult my general, Captain, I beg you will do it somewhere else than
                  in my presence."</p>
               <p>"Pardon! monsieur; I do assure you I meant no disrespect to le General Braddock; I
                  only—"</p>
               <p>"Pardon <emph>me,</emph> Captain!" excitedly broke in Talbot, who, when on the
                  subject of the favorite "Cold Streams," scarce knew where to stop. "Did you ever
                  hear how, at Fontenoy, the 'Cold Streams' were ordered to attack the French Guards
                  and Swiss combined, who, entrenched and in perfect confidence of victory, awaited
                  their onset? and how they advanced right into the jaws of death, composed and
                  steady as if on parade? and how, as they neared their adversaries, their officers,
                  and Braddock among them, armed with nothing but light rattans, doffed their caps
                  to their foes, who politely returned their salute? 'Gentlemen of the French
                  Guards,' cried Lord Charles Hay, 'fire! if you please!' 'Pardon, monsieur,'
                  replied your countryman man, 'the French Guards never fire first; pray, fire
                  yourselves!</p>
               <p>"And they <emph>did</emph> fire, and your ranks were mowed down as ripe grain
                  before the sickle. Throughout that whole bloody day the Guards behaved with the
                  same steadiness, their officers in the heat of the fight, with their canes turning
                  their men's muskets to the right or the left, as they wished. Now, Captain, when I
                  think of that action between tried and disciplined gentlemen soldiers on both
                  sides, and then hear you talk with patience of a parcel of screeching red devils,
                  who steal horses, lay in wait for stragglers, and who flay the wounded alive, and
                  don't even spare the dead, I confess, Captain, I am shocked, horrified, disgusted.
                  The times are degenerate."</p>
               <p>The year before, the French forces at the fort had been officered by such men as
                  Drouillon, de Villiers, Jumonville, Chauvignerie, de Longueil, and last, though
                  not least, La-force—a man speaking several Indian tongues, and of extraordinary
                  influence among them. The above were all noted men along the border—dashing
                  spirits—fonder than the Indians themselves of adventure—cooler, and more
                  enterprising than they.</p>
               <p>They were all of the same tastes as those far-famed French <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >coureurs des bois,</foreign> or as we would call them, forest-rangers, who,
                  like Frenchmen generally, showed a marvellous facility in adapting themselves to
                  circumstances; who took to the woods like natives; who dressed like the Indians;
                  lived, mingled and married with them, and who became the progenitors of that
                  celebrated and very peculiar race famed as Canadian half-breeds and trappers.</p>
               <p>Had Dumas known the fact, it might have been a sufficient retort to Talbot's
                  sarcasm, to ask whether Braddock himself had not strenuously endeavored to ally to
                  this very expedition, a large body of Southern Catawba Indians, and whether he had
                  not—as he did—publicly offered pound;5 for<pb n="130-131"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000069"/> every enemy's scalp brought in by either an Indian
                  or one of his own soldiers.</p>
               <p>Those were cruel and bloody times, and neither side was very particular as to the
                  kind or instrument of punishment on their foes. When even the younger Penns, and
                  our State Council, could resolve to issue a reward for Indian scalps—¥25 for a man
                  or boy, and ¥10 for a woman—it may well be supposed the times were troublous and
                  "out of joint."</p>
               <p>Dumas, <emph>not</emph> knowing this, was content to turn the subject as best he
                  could, and conversed in a more and more friendly spirit, until late in the night,
                  asking Talbot whether he knew Monsieur de Bonneville and daughter, and of their
                  picturesque home in the neighboring woods. On his companion stating he had never
                  heard of them, Dumas descanted at some length and with considerable enthusiasm
                  upon the grace and accomplishments of the daughter, and the engrossing studies and
                  exploits of her venerable father.</p>
               <p>Captain Dumas, at length rising to go to his quarters, concluded the interview by
                  remarking:</p>
               <p>"Eh, bien! milord, we have had an interesting conversation, and I would be
                  unfeignedly rejoiced to ameliorate your situation. You are confined here because
                  of your rude and violent language and conduct toward the commandant; but, if you
                  will give me your <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parole d'honneur</foreign> not to
                  escape, I will take it on myself—in fact, I am requested by Sieur de Beaujeu—to
                  offer you my own quarters, whatever change of apparel you may need, and the
                  freedom of the fort grounds."</p>
               <p>"I thank you, Captain, from my heart, but I cannot accept my freedom on such
                  conditions. Were I <emph>your</emph> prisoner, I might consent at once and freely;
                  but if I am to be considered as prisoner to those devils of Indians, I think it my
                  duty to escape from their infernal clutches at the first and at <emph>every</emph>
                  opportunity."</p>
               <p>Dumas mused awhile, surveyed Talbot's slight and effeminate person, and then
                  briefly said:</p>
               <p>"Oh, well, milord, come with me! I'll risk your escape. The whole matter between
                  the two forces will be decided in a very short time, and one man, and he an
                  amateur, can make but little difference. An escape just now, with so many
                  thousands of watchful eyes about, would be rather difficult." And then, in an
                  undertone: "I could almost wish 'twere easier. I don't myself like too much the
                  odd ways and deviltries of our painted allies; and rest assured, if you feel like
                  escaping out of their cruel hands, although my duty forbids me to aid, my
                  inclination will equally forbid my throwing many obstacles in your way. You
                  understand? Eh?"</p>

               <p>AND so the two groped their way past the guard, to a low, barrack-like shed, about
                  fifty feet long, set apart for officers. Here Talbot was duly introduced to the
                  Sieur de Langlade, who had brought down from the far lakes the North-western
                  Indians under Pontiac and King Nis-so-waquet, and to de Lignery, and was made
                  quite at home. (See <hi rend="i"/>Appendix K.) Throwing himself on a spread of
                  bear skips, he soon slept the sleep of the young and the weary; nor did he awaken
                  until a broad bar of sunlight was thrown athwart his face, arousing him once more
                  to a sense of his forlorn condition.</p>
               <p>After a bountiful, and—considering the place—even a luxuriant breakfast, and a
                  chat with the French officers, Talbot was permitted to walk about the area within
                  the entrenchments, just as and just where he pleased; and you may be sure he was
                  all eyes at the novel scenes, inside and outside the walls.</p>
               <p>Now he inspected the troops and militia as they were drilled in squad, and
                  afterwards manœuvred outside on the parade ground; now he stood on the ramparts
                  land-ward, and watched the numerous groups of Indians as they gathered in noisy
                  clusters, attended to camp duties, engaged in games and dances; and now he stood
                  on the ramparts on the two water sides, gazed up and down the rivers, saw the
                  Indian canoe races, watched the fishers as they pulled in their finny prey by line
                  and nets made from the inner bark of the tamarac.</p>
               <p>We have already described the general appearance of Fort Duquesne. It is only
                  necessary to add some few details, so as to give the reader a better idea of the
                  whole <foreign xml:lang="FRA">enceinte.</foreign> It was planned by monsieur le
                  Chevalier de Mercier, captain of artillery, and was built with immense labor,
                  having a "great deal of strong works collected into very little room."</p>
               <p>It was a parallelogram in form, its longer side fifty, and its shorter about forty
                  yards. The bastions and inner wall were made of very large squared logs, about
                  twelve feet high, and compactly filled in with earth to the depth of eight, thus
                  leaving about four feet of ramparts to shelter the plateau.</p>
               <p>The sides nearest the rivers were unprotected with bastions, but were fortified by
                  a strong stockade twelve feet high, made of logs a foot thick, and ingeniously
                  wattled together with hickory poles, and having loop-holes slanting downwards, cut
                  in them to enable the men to fire. At a distance of about sixty feet from this
                  inner wall, was a shallow ditch, completely environing the whole <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">enceinte,</foreign> and protected by a second log stockade seven
                  feet high, which was solidly embanked with earth.</p>
               <p>The main gate opened to the northeast. Immediately<pb n="134-135"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000071"/> between its posterns was sunk a deep well, as wide
                  as the gate, which gate was nothing but the log drawbridge itself, that at night,
                  or in times of danger, was drawn up with chains and levers. The other and smaller
                  gate, was on the Allegheny bank. Both were made of logs, but the one to the
                  northeast had a wicket cut in it, for ordinary use. Hard by this were the magazine
                  and kitchen; the former twenty by forty, built of heavy, hewed timber, sunk deeply
                  into the ground, and covered for four feet with a coating of clay.</p>
               <p>Besides these, there were other solid and substantial log and rough, board houses
                  within the walls—barracks, storehouses, commandant's residence, officers'
                  quarters, etc., while a well was sunken in the very centre of the area.</p>
               <p>This fort was considered strong enough in those days to resist not only Indian and
                  infantry assaults, but even attacks with such field pieces as were then generally
                  used. It was, as stated, Sir John Sinclair's opinion, that the best method of
                  subduing the post was to erect a battery on the brow of Coal Hill, which perfectly
                  dominated the position, and thence, with hot shot, set the buildings on fire, and,
                  if possible, blow up the magazine. All the artillery consisted of a few cannon—one
                  half of them three, and the remainder four pounders. Five of these were generally
                  mounted on the northeastern bastion, defending the powder magazine. The ground
                  about was dry, and all the timber cut away for about a quarter of a mile, so as to
                  afford an unobstructed range for the artillery.</p>
               <p>As Talbot thus carelessly (to all appearance) sauntered about, peering into every
                  corner, he carefully noted each point, in order not alone to make a reliable map
                  of the fort and its armature, but to see how and when an escape could best be
                  effected.</p>
               <p>He had just withdrawn to a point farthest removed from all observation, when he
                  noted a sturdy and rather gawk ish youth in civilian's clothes, approaching him
                  cautiously and with an awkward gait. When near enough, the loutish but
                  resolute-looking lad carefully looked about, and finally said, in English:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Talbot—if that's your name—you are, like me, a prisoner; what are you going
                  to do about it?"</p>
               <p>Talbot started at hearing English spoken where he supposed all were ignorant of
                  that language, and replied:</p>
               <p>"Who are you, my lad, and what's your name?"</p>
               <p>"My name's Smith—James Smith; and—"</p>
               <p>"Smith—Smith—Smith," musingly repeated Talbot. "I surely have heard that classic
                  name before; and now <emph>who</emph> are you?—the prisoner of whom Captain Dumas
                  told me to-day?"</p>
               <p>"The same. I'm a Pennsylvania boy, and was engaged, with three hundred more, in
                  cutting a road from Fort Loudon to join Braddock's road at a point near the Turkey
                  Foot, when, on going back to hurry up some provision wagons, my companion and me
                  were fired at by three Indians, from a blind of bushes. He was killed outright,
                  while I escaped unhurt; but my horse, making a violent start, threw me, and while
                  thus entangled, I was taken prisoner."</p>
               <p>"And how long have you been here? You look weak and sick. Haven't you been treated
                  well?"</p>
               <p>"Here over a month, and <emph>am</emph> sick. Greatest wonder I aint dead and
                  planted. I hadn't as good luck as you—was forced to run the gauntlet over exactly
                  the same spot that you ran yesterday. When I had reached near the end of the
                  lines, was knocked down by a club or tomahawk handle; got up and stumbled on, but
                  was beaten so unmercifully, that I became at length insensible, and—"</p>
               <p>"The pitiless devils!" cried Talbot; "and didn't any from the fort interfere?"</p>
               <p>"Never a one. The first thing I remember, was being<pb n="136-137"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000072"/> in a rough room, and a <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >parlez-vous</foreign> doctor standing over me, opening a vein in my arm, and
                  washing my bruises with brandy,"</p>
               <p>"The ruffians! And these are your polite and gentlemanly French! and what did the
                  pusillanimous frog-eaters do then?"</p>
               <p>"A number of Indians surrounded me, threatening me with death if I did not tell
                  the truth. They asked me how many men were in our road-making party, and were they
                  armed. I told them three hundred, that they <emph>were</emph> well armed (meaning
                  the arm of flesh), for our whole party had only thirty guns among them, which, if
                  the murderous, scalping varmints had known, they would have gone and killed every
                  man of them; so that, although only a boy of eighteen, I hope I have done
                     <emph>that</emph> much good. 'Tis only been a week since I've been out of the
                  hospital." (See <hi rend="i"/>Appendix L.)</p>
               <p>"Well," said Talbot, after a meaning pause, "I'm going to throw back your own
                  question to you. What are <emph>you</emph> going to do about it?"</p>
               <p>"Well, stranger, I've pretty well made up my mind to escape, and if you've a
                  notion to join me, two heads are better than one. The Frenchers tell me I'm a
                  prisoner to the Indians; that they can't and wont interfere, and that as soon as
                  I'm able to travel, my captor, Tecangkretanego, intends taking me, God knows
                  where, for adoption into his tribe. I choose death to that."</p>
               <p>"Good boy, you! And you've given no parole?"</p>
               <p>"Not a mite of it. My youth and illness have spared me that; and I've been allowed
                  the range of the fort."</p>
               <p>"Have you planned any escape, Smith? 'Twill be difficult to get out of this trap
                  just now. And yet I would risk my <emph>under</emph> scalp this time, to be of
                  some use to Braddock, for the red-hides are gathering in great numbers, and
                  evidently mean fight."</p>
               <p>"I," replied Smith, "have thought out <emph>this</emph> plan, but will allow there
                  are objections to it; but I'll risk it, any-how—this very night, too. To-morrow,
                  they tell me, there's to be a grand ball match just outside the fort. Indians, you
                  know, are all famous ball-players; and the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >par-lez-vous</foreign> are constantly planning games, dances, foot-races, and
                  amusements for them. Ginger! they <emph>have</emph> to do it, else there would be
                  everlasting mischief brewing between so many fierce and jealous fellows from a
                  dozen different tribes. Not a day or night but has its dance, its conjuring, or
                  its merry making."</p>
               <p>"Why, they must be a jolly, careless set of rascals," said Talbot, "to want so
                  much play."</p>
               <p>"Jolly! Jolly as a grave-stone when they've their 'mad up.' But, as I was saying,
                  this afternoon two canoe-races take place on the Allegheny—one between two young
                  girls from the Delaware village of Shannopinstown, just above, and two others
                  selected from a Shawnee village just opposite Shannopin. This is for a silken
                  scarf and a gilt comb, or some kind of woman's head-gear or another. These are to
                  be presented by the doctor's fair daughter, the only lady in the fort, and a most
                  gentle nurse she is, as I can truly witness."</p>
               <p>"Haven't seen <emph>her</emph> yet," said Talbot. "Is she pretty?"</p>
               <p>"Well, now, she <emph>is,</emph> stranger, you'd better believe it. Never saw any
                  in my parts quite so taking and genteel-like. Has a merry laugh that kind o' goes
                  all over and works down into you; and the neatest little foot and ankle; and the
                  tenderest voice and softest eyes, that tickle under your waistcoat, and—"</p>
               <p>"Halloo! hold, James! Why <emph>how</emph> you run on, boy! And what next?" asked
                  Talbot, almost forgetting, in his keen desire to witness this race, that he is
                  planning an escape.</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7175-00000073"/>
               <p>"Next—next? Why, she's <emph>all</emph> pretty! Danged if she isn't the—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, bother the girl! <emph>I'm</emph> asking what next after the Delaware and
                  Shawnee girls?"</p>
               <p>"Oh!" answered the flustered Smith, the light somewhat fading out of his eyes, and
                  in a vexed tone; "why didn't you say so? Why, then—let's see, where was I?—oh—then
                  follows a pine canoe-race, two paddles to a side, between four picked braves from
                  Shingiss' village below, and four others from the Shawnee village of Nymwha."</p>
               <p>"What!" cried Talbot, in the greatest glee; "Nymwha? why, he's my captor and new
                  'governor.' Come, James, my covey, what do you 'lay' on this race? I'll wager two
                  to one Nymwha wins; and, for the same reason, I'll take the same odds on the
                  Shawnee girls. I mustn't desert my tribe, my boy."</p>
               <p>"But—but, mister, you're forgetting the escape."</p>
               <p>"Confound it! so I am; but don't these races come off this afternoon?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and to-morrow, as I said, the great ball match takes place between two
                  hundred picked Ottawas and Chippewas, led by Pontiac, and two hundred selected
                  from the Delawares, Mingoes, and Shawnees, under Puckeshinwa. Now, there are
                  always great 'medicine' ceremonies the night before a big match comes off; all the
                  bets are then made, the stakes laid, and the dances for victory gone through with.
                  These will draw every man, who can't go out of the fort, to the nearest rampart.
                  Expecting no immediate attack, the discipline is very slack, and the guards go
                  their rounds solely for form's sake. Down at this angle there is no guard at all,
                  while on the whole Allegheny side there is but one, whose beat is from one bastion
                  to the other, and between the inner and the outer stockades. Nothing is easier
                  than to get over the two lines of stockades, and jump into one of the many canoes
                  at the 'point,' if we can only escape the guard. If I could but talk French, think
                  I could manage it."</p>
               <p>"Hold!" cried Talbot, after a brief pause, "I've got it, lad—a capital idea! Why,
                  I begin to like this fort-life. Hang me if I don't believe I was born for a
                  strategist! <emph>I</emph> talk French like a native of—England. Now, James, let
                  me propound a few questions, on which I must have 'the truth, the whole truth, and
                  nothing but the truth!' Ready? Do you know any young <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >cadet</foreign> who looks like me?—not so commanding or good looking, you
                  know, but about my size and build?"</p>
               <p>"One—Iittle Jacques Baptiste, the merriest and prankiest jackanapes of the whole
                  kit of them."</p>
               <p>"Good! Could you manage to get his coat?"</p>
               <p>"Don't see how I could."</p>
               <p>"His cap, then?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>That</emph> might be managed, but—"</p>
               <p>"No matter; we'll risk the clothes, in hopes the night will be dark. Do you know
                  the guard who will be on the Allegheny beat to-night, and what kind of a cove he
                  is?"</p>
               <p>"I do, sir—a fat, good-natured lout, by the name of Meurice—Peer Meurice."</p>
               <p>"All right. By Jupiter, we'll fix him in a jiffey—though I think you mean Pierre,
                  which is French for Peter. Now listen, Jim—you don't mind my calling you Jim, do
                  you? Now, we must separate just here,—not to be seen together until nine o'clock
                  to-night; unless," added Talbot, "you want to double your bet on the Delaware
                  squaws, in which case, hunt me up <emph>at all risks.</emph> I'll go even my
                  wig—which has twice saved me—on the girls of <emph>our village,</emph> you
                  know."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Talbot," replied Smith, wonderingly, "you are an odd fish—not at all the
                  timid, girlish chappy I took ye for. I kind o' thought ye cared for nothing but
                  pretty clothes and curly hair."</p>
               <p>"Why, look ye, James," laughingly replied the volatile<pb n="140-141"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000074"/> Talbot; "the Scriptures say' there's a time for all
                  things.' I've <emph>had</emph> my sad night and morning; that's over. It don't
                  suit me. Now, in the language of our immortal bard, 'Richard's himself again!' Do
                  you snuff? No? Sorry—but to return. Oh, one thing I've forgotten. Do you know the
                  countersign to-night?"</p>
               <p>"Fortunately, I do—<hi rend="i"/>Scarooyaddy," whispered Smith.</p>
               <p>"By jove! you don't say so! How shocking! Why, that's my friend, the great Mingo
                  chief, who, Dumas tells me, drowned himself yesterday afternoon, right over back
                  of that island, after having killed Kustaloge—one of the best Shawnee chiefs."</p>
               <p>"The same, although I never heard of him before yesterday; but his death kicked up
                  a terrible hullabaloo, both inside and outside the fort."</p>
               <p>"And well it might, James. He was the 'noblest Roman of them all,' and it grieves
                  me to know he made two such gallant fights yesterday only to find a watery grave
                  at last; but <foreign xml:lang="FRA">revenons à nos moutons,</foreign> as we
                  French say. Well, at nine o'clock, all inside the fort being assembled, as you
                  say, on the nor'-eastern ramparts, you and I slip off to this angle. As soon as
                  Pierre—what did you say his name was?—oh, Meurice, is fairly on his back stretch,
                  you slip over the ramparts, make across the interval, and jump over the second
                  stockade to the beach, and have a canoe ready. I'll follow soon as may be, and if
                  the guard stops me, leave me to manage him. Don't want to hurt him, if I can cheat
                  him with bastard French—but here comes Captain Dumas, and, as I live, with the
                  young lady, and I must say, James, a deuced taut-looking craft she is. Now, my
                  boy, <emph>mum's</emph> the word, and nine's the hour."</p>
               <p>"Eh, bien! Milord Talbot," said Dumas in French, which as usual, we translate. "I
                  see you, like all others, are others, are attracted by the beautiful views of 'la
                  belle rivière.' How did you find out Mr. Schmitt?"</p>
               <p>"By the law of affinity, I presume, Captain," said Talbot, taking off his hat to
                  the young lady. "Misery loves company, you know. We were just discussing the boat
                  races which come off this afternoon. By the bye, Captain, have you yet chosen your
                  favorite, and would you like to make a small wager with me?"</p>
               <p>"Let me first introduce you, milord, to Mademoiselle Fleury, the daughter of Dr.
                  Fleury. We know not what we would do, or come to out in this wilderness, were it
                  not for the presence of this fair lady."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Smith has already spoken to me, mademoiselle, of your kind attentions to him,
                  and, as one in the same cause, I thank you. I scarce know whether to be sorry or
                  glad that the like rude Indian ordeal did not throw me, too, under your care."</p>
               <p>"Oh, milord," laughingly (remembering the scene of the wig) replied the Doctor's
                  pretty daughter, in the softest and most liquid of tones, "be most heartily glad!
                  I cannot and ought not to give you my opinions of the cruel, pitiless savages,
                  whom, it seems, we are compelled to take as our allies, but we <emph>can</emph>
                  change the subject. Is monsieur an admirer of the beautiful scenery of our rivers?
                  I see he has chosen a good point from which to take in the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >tout ensemble</foreign> of river, island, woods, and mountain?"</p>
               <p>"I must confess, mademoiselle, that my eyes have never rested on a more beautiful
                  scene. Such glorious rivers as here sweep past their bountiful currents are
                  unknown in my country."</p>
               <p>"And in mine. To me the luxuriant and vividly-green foliage, so dense and varied
                  and all-pervading, lends an additional charm to the landscape. I have been here
                  now many months, milord, but must confess I never <emph>loved</emph> the country
                  until the warm rains of spring awakened all those hills and plains into life, and
                  covered all nature with so rich and beautiful a mantle. I sometimes stand here
                     of<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7175-00000075"/> a breezy evening, looking out
                  upon the unknown and untrodden West, and fancy my cheeks are fanned by the fresh
                  airs from the gulf; and again, that I can detect the odors from the flower-gemmed
                  prairies, which our pioneers and missionaries tell us stretch away out there for
                  hundreds of miles—but I must not sentimentalize. Captain Dumas tells me you do not
                  know Mademoiselle de Bonneville, who lives in such a picturesque valley, and
                  passes her time in such a romantic manner near here."</p>
               <p>"No, mademoiselle. From his account, she must be very lovely and interesting, and
                  her father a singularly attractive character."</p>
               <p>"Believe me, monsieur! they are. We will probably have them down to the fort soon,
                  and you will then be happy in making their acquaintance. I sometimes think Captain
                  Dumas, here, finds much consolation with her, judging from the increased frequency
                  of his visits. Whenever he gets pensive or melancholy, he hums snatches of strange
                  airs, deserts our poor Company, and rushes off to the de Bonnevilles. I am sure,"
                  she archly continued, "it must be the birds Marie draws. Is it not so,
                  Captain?"</p>
               <p>"Oh," gaily replied Dumas, "I make Marie my confidante. Whenever I miss most my
                  wife and children, I pay her the compliment of a visit, and return back refreshed
                  and more contented with this wilderness."</p>
               <p>"You make gallant speeches to-day, Captain. Married men, however, must have their
                  freedoms. Milord, will you take any interest in the day's races?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, wont I, mademoiselle? I heat <emph>you</emph> are to donate the prizes to the
                  winner. I cannot get any ladies' gloves or whimsies, out in this wilderness, but
                  if you could mention anything I can procure, which would make the races more
                  unusually interesting, I would be glad to go Shawnee versus Delaware in
                     <emph>both</emph> races. You may have heard, I am to call old Nymwha—God bless
                  him and make away with him—my papa."</p>
               <p>"Well, while you two are settling your bets, I will leave you. Mademoiselle will
                  bring you to my quarters by dinner;" and so saying, Dumas sauntered off, leaving
                  Talbot to the attentions of the amiable young lady, who showed him everything of
                  interest in and about the fort, and brought him back to Dumas' quarters as fresh
                  as a daisy, and as gay as a lark.</p>
               <p>By three o'clock, everything in and about the fort betokened preparations for the
                  amusements of the evening. A slight shower had intervened, and never did the three
                  rivers and their surroundings present a fresher or more lovely appearance.
                  Everywhere the eye wandered—over hill, plain and valley—was a boundless sea of
                  bright, emerald verdure, while the clear air above was free from all stain of
                  smoky impurity.</p>
               <p>The fame of these canoe-races and the approaching grand ball match, had spread far
                  and near; and canoes filled with the warriors, squaws, girls, and even children,
                  from all the Indian villages up and down the three rivers for a distance of many
                  miles, could be seen on the streams, converging about the starting point on the
                  Allegheny, just opposite the river gate of the fort.</p>
               <p>It was a wise and shrewd device, these various amusements which were set on foot
                  just at this juncture by Beaujeu. Notwithstanding his manifest influence over the
                  heterogeneous gathering of Indians, it required all the art and address of which
                  he was master, to keep them well in hand. So many fierce, wild and untamed
                  spirits, accustomed to brook no control; jealous of each other; subject to no
                  drill or discipline; going and coming at their own will, were liable to scatter,
                  or to do something unexpected and unwished for, just at the critical moment.</p>
               <p>A feverish and unrestful spirit, too, had lately been<pb n="144-145"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000076"/> growing among them. As runner after runner came in
                  to report the size, the progress, and the character of Braddock's army, now
                  marching steadily, dauntlessly forward day by day; overcoming all obstacles;
                  bridging ravines; crashing their way through forests; wading thigh-deep in
                  morasses; letting down from craggy heights their cannon and mortars and cohorns by
                  block and tackle; all this meant <emph>business.</emph> It looked like dead
                  earnest. The Indians saw it and felt it. It was rapidly producing a demoralizing
                  effect Some of the far-West and Canada bands began to whisper and waver; those
                  nearer home to count the cost and grow lukewarm. It was not <emph>their</emph>
                  quarrel; let the English and French fight it out.</p>
               <p>It was then a timely craft in the French to appear to ignore Braddock; to affect
                  to despise his slowly but steadily approaching battalions, and to deport
                  themselves as though victory was sure; and so the French flags were flung to the
                  breeze, the cannon roared oftener than usual, the drills and parades occurred
                  daily, and all sorts of amusements were planned to divert, occupy attention, and
                  banish apprehension.</p>

               <p>As four o'clock drew near, the whole scene was exceedingly animated. The junction
                  of the rivers seemed fairly alive with elm, birch, and pine canoes, as also with
                  the larger batteaux and perogues, carrying twenty or thirty each, which had
                  conveyed troops and Indians down from French creek. All kinds of craft darted
                  hither and thither, their excited occupants betting, laughing and shouting; now
                  and then collisions and upsets would occur, and parties of both sexes and all
                  ages, would splutter around in the water, amid the merry snouts and laughs of both
                  shore and water crowds.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the whole scene could be said to differ but little in its essential
                  features from a boat-race as witnessed on the same rivers now, except that very
                  many of the canoes<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7175-00000077"/> were paddled by
                  squaws and girls, while the crowds along the Allegheny shores were swarthy,
                  painted, and half-naked savages, instead of well-dressed citizens with their wives
                  or sweethearts. There were the Cauhnewagas from Canada; the Ottawas, Chippewas and
                  Hurons from the lakes; the Piankashaws and Twightwees from the Miami and
                  Muskingum; the Shawnees and Delawares from adjacent parts, and a plentiful
                  sprinkling of Mingo or Iroquois stragglers, fighting on their own hook—famed
                  chieftains, grim-visaged warriors, sage and dignified counsellors; and then there
                  was the rude but massive Fort Duquesne, with the tri-color fluttering to the
                  breeze; the mounted cannon on the bastions; the ramparts on the river side crowded
                  with gaily-dressed French officers, regulars, Canadians, cadets, and some few
                  invited Indian chiefs; and at one point, Dr. Fleury, his fair daughter, with the
                  prizes of victory in her hands, Dumas leaning carelessly against one of the guns,
                  and our little friend Talbot, his eyes fairly dancing with excitement, and with
                  the spirit of a true "sport," ready to wager all he had, even to his fancy boots,
                  velvet coat, and much-prized wig, on the issue of the day.</p>
               <p>But, hark! the deep boom of a cannon is heard, awakening a series of echoes from
                  the hills around, and is immediately followed by a loud shout from all on shore
                  and water. It is the signal for the contestants to get ready. All is commotion.
                  The huddled canoes begin to scatter, and two light, graceful birches, with a
                  couple of girls in each, standing erect in either end, rapidly glided toward the
                  starting-point, which was a single canoe anchored a few rods out.</p>
               <p>They were simply but modestly clad—gay moccasins, quilled leggings, a bright-hued
                  skirt or tunic, a white shirt over the upper part of their persons, crimson
                  scarfs, presented by the fort officers, about their waists, and their long black
                  hair streaming down their backs, kept in position tion by velvet bands. It was a
                  beautiful and picturesque sight, and as the light paddles dipped in the water and
                  the bodies swayed in unison, a universal shout came from the delighted
                  spectators.</p>
               <p>"By jove! isn't it perfectly splendid?" cried the excited Talbot. "And,
                  mademoiselle, do but just look at that graceful young girl in the front canoe;
                  she's as lithe as a leopard. Did you ever see such grace and such a figure? Look!
                  look! how she sweeps her paddle and throws back her hair! Don't you wish old
                  Braddock was here? He's a judge of fine-looking girls. I lay you five guineas that
                  girl's Shawnee; why, who knows, maybe she's a sister of mine, or still better, a
                  cousin. Hurrah! Who knows? Where's Father?"</p>
               <p>"There you mistake, milord. She wears the Delaware colors, and it's—no, it cannot
                  be—why, yes, it is—she's Wau-ki-na, the 'bounding fawn,' and daughter of Captain
                  Pipe!"</p>
               <p>"And who the devil's Wau-ki-na?" shouted Talbot. "Oh, pardon, mademoiselle! I
                  thought for the moment I was with our fellows on the Thames. Well, if anybody had
                  told me, three days ago, that I'd be swearing and betting in an enemy's fort, and
                  at an Indian girl's boat-race, I'd a given him the lie and struck him! By the lord
                  Harry, but this is a great country! Oh, if only Lady Grace—"</p>
               <p>But the boom of another cannon cut off all further conversation, and the two
                  birches bounded forward like mettled coursers on their race. The yells and
                  screeches which then went up from the throats of the half-crazy Indians, were
                  something to remember for life. They jumped, and danced, and surged along the
                  shore, shouting and shrieking until the very hills around were full of echoes. The
                  course was up to Shannopinstown, the Delaware village about two miles above the
                  fort. Few were content to stand<pb n="148 (Illustration) "
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000078"/> still, but all kept moving along the shore, keeping
                  abreast of the boats, which were rapidly shooting up the stream, the paddles
                  dipping in swift, short, nervous strokes. It was wonderful.</p>
               <p>"Oh, well!" cried Talbot, "I can't stand <emph>this,</emph> you know! I'm going to
                  follow the boats. It looks confoundedly just now like Shawnee was going to lose.
                  That Wau-ki-na, as you call her, has a mighty dexterous stroke of her own. Just
                  look how she bends to it! By-by, I'm off"—and Talbot was actually moving away, his
                  eyes fixed on the boats, when Dumas touched him on the shoulder, and said: "Not
                  this time, milord; you forget you're a prisoner."</p>
               <p>Talbot gazed at him with a most ludicrously-puzzled expression. "Prisoner? Why so
                  I am! But I pledge you the word of a gentleman, Captain, an escape <emph>just
                     now,</emph> never so much as crossed my mind. Just let me follow up this race,
                  and I give you my <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parole d'honneur,</foreign> I'll be back
                  in half an hour."</p>
               <p>"What! and leave mademoiselle?"</p>
               <p>"No more; I stay, but what shall we do? Let's double the bets all round—though I
                  fear Wau-ki-na is going to win. Who did you say she was? What a figure! and what
                  soft, luxuriant hair!"</p>
               <p>"Why, milord, she's the young Indian girl I told you of who has kept Marie de
                  Bonneville company since May. I know she's the best swimmer and dancer, and most
                  expert paddler of her village. Why, I'm told she fairly lives in, or on the water;
                  but how came she in this race? Did you not see her with Marie, Captain Dumas,
                  night before last?"</p>
               <p>"Most assuredly; and Marie never talked of sending her home. I've got it! Marie
                  has concluded to take my advice, and will come to the fort this very evening! 'Tis
                  the very best thing she could do."</p>

               <p>Thus passed the time away until the noise along shore, and the returning flotilla
                  of boats denoted the approach of the two canoes. On and on they came, accompanied
                  by the same surging, jostling and shouting throngs of Indians. It was now clear to
                  all that the Delaware girls were fully four or five clean lengths ahead. Now they
                  are abreast of the fort, the stroke of the paddles a trifle slower but none the
                  less steady than that with which they started out.</p>
               <p>And now the goal is reached, and such a shout arose as frightened the very eagles
                  around from their eyries. The winning boat was again proceeding up stream, when
                  just as it was abreast the water-gate, she who was called Wau-ki-na rose erect and
                  curved her paddle in graceful salutation to Fleury's daughter, who could be
                  distinctly seen on the bastion.</p>
               <p>A motion was immediately made for her to approach, when with a single, quick sweep
                  of the paddles, the prow of the canoe was turned to shore, and soon after struck
                  the strand. Wau-ki-na and the other girl stepped out, and approached the gate,
                  where stood Dumas, who led them directly up to where the Doctor, his daughter,
                  Talbot, de Beaujeu, and almost all the officers had assembled.</p>
               <p>Mademoiselle Fleury hastened forward and caught her hand and warmly pressed it,
                  saying in French.</p>
               <p>"Here, Wau-ki-na, take the prizes which I most gladly give you. No more modest or
                  more worthy Indian girl have I ever seen, I am <emph>so</emph> rejoiced you are
                  its winner," and she fastened a beautiful silken sash about her waist, and
                  inserted a rich tortoise-shell comb, rimmed with gold, in the tresses of her
                  hair.</p>
               <p>Nothing could exceed the captivating grace with which Wau-ki-na! bowed to receive
                  her gifts. Her slight, girlish form, the delicacy of her features, the modest
                  down-cast of her eyes, extorted the admiration of all. If she had been<pb
                     n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7175-00000080"/> born and raised in Louis' Court, she
                  could not have comported herself more easily or appropriately. When her older and
                  darker-hued companion had received her presents, Wau-ki-na raised her eyes
                  somewhat, and said in soft tones and broken English—or English that was more
                     <emph>bent</emph> than <emph>broken.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"You know, lady, me no talk French, me talk pretty much English."</p>
               <p>"English, do you, Wau-ki-na?" hastily broke in Talbot, who had almost abashed the
                  girl with his earnest and admiring looks. "That's <emph>my</emph> language, and
                  between you and me, worth a dozen of the mincing, prattling, die-away sort of
                  tongues which these Johnny Crapeaus talk. English is a language for full-grown
                  men,—don't you think so?" rising to his utmost stature, which our readers will
                  remember was not very much of a rise.</p>
               <p>"Me no very well understand. Miss Marie talk both, and they come sweet from her
                  lips, all two."</p>
               <p>"And where <emph>is</emph> Marie, little one? Is she coming to the fort?"</p>
               <p>Wau-ki-na's eyes filled with tears as she answered in the saddest of tones, and
                  scarce able to restrain herself from sobbing.</p>
               <p>"Ah, no! me know not; me must be very bad. This morning Marie put her arms around
                  Wau-ki-na's neck, and cry very much, and tell me I must go home, my father want
                  me. I drop the big tears all day. Cannot live away from Marie; she like mother to
                  me."</p>
               <p>"And who was with her, Wau-ki-na?" said Talbot.</p>
               <p>"Why you ask? Maybe you no friend to Marie and Edward."</p>
               <p>"Never saw her in my life—don't know her, but <emph>she's</emph> English and
                     <emph>I'm</emph> English, and come from Edward Braddock. Is <emph>he</emph> the
                  Edward you mean?"</p>
               <p>"From Braddock?" and a bright intelligent look passed over the girlish, guileless
                  face, and she continued more cautiously and in lower tones, "Ah, then you know
                  Jack, Marie's Edward—Captain Jack?"</p>
               <p>"Jack—Edward! what can the little puss mean? Phew! the devil," and then a long
                  whistle. "I see it all now; and was Captain Jack with Marie to-day?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and"—lower still—"Scarooyaddy, too."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, Wau-ki-na, that wont do! Scarooyaddy's drowned, cut into small bits by
                  the fishes."</p>
               <p>"No drowned; both with Marie, I tell you! Now me want to go."</p>
               <p>"It strikes me, milord," broke in Dumas, "that's an interesting conversation you
                  are carrying on in English. Are you making love to the girl?"</p>
               <p>"No, Captain, but 'twouldn't be hard to do—such beauty, and grace, and
                  artlessness. I never saw the like. She wants to go home. You stay here, I'll just
                  run down with her to the canoe."</p>
               <p>"But, monsieur," laughingly replied Dumas, "You forget you are a prisoner, and
                  can't leave the fort."</p>
               <p>"Oh, curse your confounded fort, and every Frenchman in it! Well, then, take her
                  down yourself. When I want to leave this old trap, I wont blab it to all the
                  world, I warn you. Good bye, Wau-ki-na, and may we meet again."</p>
               <p>So saying and giving her wee hand a warm and cordial pressure, Talbot turned on
                  his heel and left the group, taking care to follow her with admiring glances long
                  after she had entered her canoe and again took to her paddles.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>BY this time all was ready for the second race. Two long and shapely pine canoes,
                  one with Shingiss' picked crew of Delawares, and the other with Nymwhas' four of
                  Shawnese, shot up to the start. The upper portion of their bodies entirely nude,
                  and their tawny, polished skins glistening in the declining sun, the contestants
                  offered as fine a show of brawn and muscle, of perfect proportions and litheness
                  of movement, as were ever displayed in sculptor's studio.</p>
               <p>Again the deep boom of the cannon, and almost before its echoes could be given
                  back from the hills, the two pines were off like a shot, amid the same shore
                  clamor and tumult. The paddles dipped in perfect unison, and in certain harmony
                  with a wild Indian chant, which put those of the same tribes as the paddlers
                  beside themselves with excitement. The chants, with their singular refrains, each
                  ending with a loud and shrill shriek, were soon dropped, and the young and supple
                  fellows bent to their work in dead earnest. On! on! they sped, and now they are
                  clear out of sight, followed by shouting, yelling and swaying crowds of Delawares
                  and Shawnees.</p>
               <p>Talbot did not take the same interest in this as in the other race. He sauntered
                  off by himself, only returning when the shouts and increasing clamor gave token of
                  the "home stretch," and it <emph>was,</emph> indeed, a stretch, and a most
                  desperate struggle for victory. The light craft were so near together that a
                  blanket would have covered both. The poor fellows appeared greatly distressed. The
                  beaded agony stood out upon their brows. The work was too terrible to last. Just
                  before reaching the goal, one of the Delawares wavered, the paddle trembled in his
                  nerveless hand, and he sank into the canoe utterly exhausted. Even
                     <emph>this</emph> only gave the victory to the Shawnees by a single length.</p>
               <p>The excitement among the rival tribes on shore was awful. It was nearly ending in
                  a regular battle, so deeply were their feelings enlisted. The races were now over.
                  The canoes, as well as the surging crowds began to scatter, and, just as the sun
                  sank in a crimson glory behind the western hills, all the fort guns belched forth
                  their fire together, filling the whole heavens with reverberating roar.</p>
               <p>The beaten party stopped not, but silent and crestfallen made their way past Smoky
                  Island, and down the Ohio to King Shingiss' camp. The victors, however, were
                  beckoned to the fort, and there a new rifle and tomahawk were presented to each,
                  accompanied by some complimentary words from de Beaujeu, the commandant. And thus
                  ended a most exciting day for all parties.</p>
               <p>After partaking of refreshments, Talbot accompanied Dumas, de Lignery and other
                  officers to the easterly bastion, where a hum and stir were already noticeable
                  among the large assemblage of Indians. They had just finished their simple meal,
                  and were gathered all over the plains in front of the fort in excited little knots
                  of talkers. There must have been over a thousand of them, laughing, shouting and
                  gesticulating. Their blood was up, as it were; famed chiefs and brave warriors,
                  old and wrinkled counsellors, and young<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7175-00000082"/>
                  athletes out upon their first war-path. The grand ball match, in which the
                  far-western tribes were to be pitted in desperate struggle against those living
                  about the Ohio, was to commence at nine of the next day, July the 7th, and now the
                  preliminaries, and ceremonies which invariably preceded a great match of this
                  kind, were about to commence.</p>
               <p>As the shades of a moonless night gradually fell upon all nature, wrapping hill,
                  plain, river and fort in gloom, the Indian camp fires, which were scattered in a
                  semi-circle all along the edge of the woods from river to river, and at a short
                  quarter of a mile's distance from the fort, were fed with fat woods and shot their
                  flames high into the air. Groups of dusky, sinewy, half-naked warriors moved to
                  and fro, their forms now in strong light and now in shadow. Then appeared lighted
                  pine knots in the hands of many, as they moved across and around the plain. Soon
                  the monotonous, muffled tum-tum-tum of the rude Indian drums rose from the various
                  parts of the ground, ever and anon interspersed with a wild, shrill chant from the
                  squaws, who had come up to the show from the neighboring villages.</p>
               <p>Altogether, this strange night scene was one of extraordinary weirdness and
                  fascination, and all the inmates of the fort, except only such as were on duty,
                  crowded the nearest line of ramparts and gazed at the large concourse of wild and
                  untamed savages, with some such heart-in-throat feeling as we of a later day watch
                  the serried battalions of a great army, with its banners, gleaming bayonets, and
                  heavy, regular tramp, tramp, tramp of feet. None could remain unmoved; some, and
                  Talbot among the number, were fairly appalled.</p>
               <p>And naturally so. There was such a dread power of savageness and fatal mischief
                  slumbering 'mid those wild, dusky, swarthy groups. Now they were all harmony and
                  good humor, but one exciting speech from a great chief; a bad omen from one of
                  their "medicine" men; a false suspicion picion harbored in those jealous,
                  unreasoning minds; even the distribution of a keg of rum, would turn that whole
                  assemblage into a pack of ruthless hell-hounds—a seething mass of pitiless,
                  yelping and scalping demons, sparing neither sex, age, nor condition.</p>
               <p>But now the preparations for the match have commenced. First, a level piece of
                  ground right in front of the great gate of the fort was carefully selected; at
                  either end, and about three hundred yards apart, were erected two saplings twenty
                  feet high, and six feet between, with a connecting pole on top. These for the
                  bases. In the centre, between the two goals, was inserted a small stake.</p>
               <p>At this point, umpires—aged chiefs selected by both parties—were to toss up the
                  ball, the endeavor of each side being to force it through their own wicket by
                  means of a net of thongs drawn across the bend of a stick, like the modern shinny
                  stick. No player was allowed to strike the ball or touch it with hands, or aught
                  else beside the netted stick. An old "medicine" man now drew a straight line from
                  one wicket to the other, across which, as soon as done, all rushed forward to make
                  their bets, choose stakeholders, and deposit their wagers. As almost everybody
                  betted, and especially the squaws, the quantity of moccasins, wampum,
                  morris-bells, pipes, strouds, knives, tomahawks, rifles, and what not, was
                  immense. These piles were to be watched all night by the stakeholders.</p>
               <p>The two champions, Pontiac, for the western, and Puckeshinwa, a noted Shawnee
                  chief from the Shawanee, Florida, and father of the afterwards famous Tecumseh
                  (then unborn), for the tribes about the Ohio, had, during the day, carefully
                  selected the most expert and famous players, by taking around a ball-stick painted
                  red, decorated with feathers, and with it touching each one chosen, who, on this
                  stick promised to be on hand at the hour.</p>
               <p>Now commenced the "Ball Play Dance." At beat of<pb n="156-157"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000083"/> drum and amid the chantings of the women, all
                  players thus selected, assembled at their respective wickets, and danced and
                  leaped and howled around them, rattling their ball-sticks together, and
                  occasionally breaking out with sharp yelps and shrill shrieks. The squaws, too,
                  who had goods at stake, formed into two rows on each side the "betting line," and
                  danced with uniform step and with a low monotonous chant, while the umpires who
                  were to toss the ball and decide disputes, assembled about the central stake,
                  smoking to the Great Spirit for victory and for wisdom to decide aright.</p>

               <p>WHILE all in the fort were intent on these novel and fantastic ceremonies, Talbot
                  had managed occasionally to exchange signals with Smith, and about nine of the
                  evening both quietly withdrew from the parapet, and wended their several ways to
                  the western angle of the fort—the point nearest the junction of the rivers. Here
                  they met, both excited yet determined.</p>
               <p>"Well, here we are, James! So far, so good. The night favors us. Do you see
                  Meurice?"</p>
               <p>"No, but I hear his low whistle along his beat. A fellow couldn't see his own nose
                  on such a night."</p>
               <p>"Well, now—hold till you hear the whistle moving up stream, then slip over the
                  stockade and creep along till you come to the water line. 'Tis an easy thing to
                  jump; make straight for a canoe and I'll be after you in a wink.
                     <emph>Now's</emph> your time; go—go! and, for God's sake, be cautious—one
                  misstep and we're lost!"</p>
               <p>"I'm over," whispered Smith. "Don't forget you're Jacques Baptiste, should Pierre
                  challenge you."</p>
               <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7175-00000084"/>
               <p>"Yes, yes, never fear! Leave him to me. I'll fool him to the 'top o' his bent,'
                  but he <emph>wont</emph> challenge. I'm too dev'lish sly."</p>
               <p>Talbot anxiously watched the lad as he dropped down from the, log stockade, and
                  disappeared in the darkness. When Meurice had gone two-thirds of his beat, Talbot
                  prepared to follow. Letting himself hang by his hands from the coping of the
                  parapet, and shutting his eyes tight, he dropped. It was a matter of some seven
                  feet, or <emph>should</emph> have been, had Talbot made it, but he didn't. Right
                  beneath him a thick limb projected for a foot, at an acute angle from one of the
                  big upright logs forming the stockade, and down into this narrow crotch came
                  Talbot, <emph>kerchunk</emph>—wedged so tight he could scarce move.</p>
               <p>"Curse the luck!" muttered Talbot in despair, "I'll bet guinea this is the only
                  crotch around the whole fort, and 'twill about finish my clothes, too. I hear
                  Meurice's whistle coming, and me hanging astraddle this sawed limb as tight as a
                  clothes-pin. By the lord Harry, but it hurts!" and the plucky little fellow
                  squirmed, and twisted, and wriggled, until finally he got one thigh over the
                  crotch, and stumbled to the ground like a possum—on what part of his body he could
                  never tell. The first thing he knew was—</p>
               <p>"Qui va Ià?" from Meurice, who was rapidly advancing, musket at cock. No answer.
                  In fact, Talbot <emph>couldn't</emph> answer. He was all bent and doubled, and
                  very much mixed up generally. Again it came, nearer and sterner:</p>
               <p>"Qui va là?"</p>
               <p>"Helas, c'est moi."</p>
               <p>"Et, qui est <foreign xml:lang="FRA">moi?</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Un ami, avec le mot."</p>
               <p>"Avancez, ami, et donnez le mot."</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Scarooyaddy" came from Talbot, in a very feeble, piping ing,
                  shattery sort of tone. But the rest of the conversation we must give in
                  English.</p>
               <p>"Right; and who le diable are <emph>you?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Me! <emph>me?</emph> Why, Meurice, blamed if I know myself; I'm all so
                  topsy-turvied by a fall I've got. I feel just as if I had been worried by a bolt
                  of lightning; been teased by a pack of curs, or—but don't you know little cadet,
                  Jacques Baptiste?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, that you, Jacques? Why, wouldn't have known your voice; you must have a bad
                  cold."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Very</emph> bad; but I assure you, Pierre, it's the very best I've got.
                  That's the reason I'm so muffled up."</p>
               <p>"And where are you going this time o' night?"</p>
               <p>"Oh,"—edging away and off towards the second line of stockades—"don't you ask too
                  many questions. Le Capitaine Dumas and I understand each other. You saw young
                  Delaware girl who won the race this afternoon?"</p>
               <p>"I did, and what of her? Oh-ho! <emph>now</emph> I understand. Ah, you young dogs
                  of cadets play the deuce among the Indian girls."</p>
               <p>"Pierre, no joking; this is a serious case. Will be back in an hour. Be careful
                  not to shoot; I've a mother, three sisters, and an old aunt at home. <hi rend="i"
                  />Scarooyaddy, Pierre"—and so saying, Talbot reached the second stockade, and
                  tumbled over to the other side, leaving the honest Pierre chuckling all over to
                  himself.</p>
               <p>Talbot was not long in jumping over the bank on to the beach, where he found Smith
                  already in the canoe, paddle in hand.</p>
               <p>"I'd e'enamost given you up," whispered Smith.</p>
               <p>"And I had <emph>altogether</emph> given myself up, Jimmy; but here I am, and out
                  she goes. Steady! there, lad! This is another of those infernal, rocking,
                  tottering, whiffets of boats—fit for nothing that I know of but coffins! Down with
                  your paddle, and lay flat in the canoe! We'll be full<pb n="160-161"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000085"/> into the firelight soon, and must float for
                  awhile—I don't care if its an hour, I'm so done up."</p>
               <p>The canoe was now fairly out in the current, both occupants flat on the bottom,
                  and quiet and nervous as cats in a milk-house. They had floated on for some little
                  time, when at last Talbot, gathering confidence as he got further away, indulged
                  in a quiet little fit of laughter, which made the canoe fairly tremble.</p>
               <p>"Sore as I am, Smith, I can't help laughing at the way I came it over poor Pierre.
                  Ill tell you the whole story some time, going lightly over the forked limb part.
                  But if Braddock don't decorate me and you for this escape from Fort Duquesne, I'll
                  have him dismissed the army. Why, lad, I've got the whole plan of the fort in my
                  pocket, and will lead Braddock right into it. Talk about your strong-holds and
                  fortifications! why, I'd agree to walk out of any of them, with a sentry at every
                  angle! But what's that?" he continued, as a slight grating sound, and a bump,
                  bump, bump was felt. "Oh, now I know; it must be that old sand bar which we saw
                  from the fort, just at the meet of the two rivers. We're all safe now, and beyond
                  the firelight. Let's get up and shove her off. Heigh-o! what a misery it must be
                  for one to be as stupid as Meurice!"</p>
               <p>He had no sooner risen to his knees, than strong hands had pinioned his arms and
                  forced him down again into the canoe, and Talbot dimly saw the ugly, painted faces
                  of two Indians bending over him. Two others had just as quietly done the same by
                  Smith, at the stern.</p>
               <p>No use resisting. There they lay, utterly powerless, and both paralyzed by the
                  perfect suddenness of the whole affair.</p>
               <p>After a while, a familiar voice issued from a huge grinning cave of a mouth.</p>
               <p>"Does 'little two-scalps' so love Nymwha's wigwam that he must find it by night?
                  Now, me have <emph>two</emph> sons."</p>
               <p>It will be remembered that one village of this Shawnee chief was on "seven-mile
                  island," on the Ohio.</p>
               <p>"Great Jupiter! Nymwha, is that <emph>you?</emph>" plaintively replied Talbot,
                  very much relieved. "If you're going to give me one of those horrible, volcanic
                  laughs of yours, don't do it, I beg—would rather take a blow. If you've a mind to
                  take my <emph>real</emph> hair this time, or even torture me at the stake, now'd
                  be as good a time as any—would just as soon live as die."</p>
               <p>"Will 'little two-scalps' go again with Nymwha to the big gun-house? or must he
                  put thongs about him and carry him?"</p>
               <p>"Will go <emph>anywhere,</emph> only let me up!" and Talbot rose and stepped out
                  of the canoe. "Where am I, Injun? and how came <emph>you</emph> on the sand
                  bar?"</p>
               <p>A broad grin divided Nymwha's face as he said: "Here no sand bar. You 'zactly
                  where you start from. Nymwha had just land from canoe to see ball play, when he
                  think he hear his dear son, 'little two-scalps.' He creep down and find canoe go
                  down river; he and his braves go in water, swim after and around it, and lead him
                  back to shore. Nymwha's son glad?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, sure—tickled to death! Come, James, I'm terribly 'cut up' about this—nothing
                  left but follow. Just to think of the infernal arts of these painted heathen!"</p>
               <p>"Hadn't we better make a sudden rush on the devils?" whispered Smith, as he came
                  out on the strand.</p>
               <p>"I thought of that—'twould be sure death. They're two to one, while a whoop would
                  bring a thousand to their aid. No, no! we must quietly go back to the fort and
                  wait till Braddock takes it." Then to Nymwha: "Lead on, old leather-breeches, and
                  if you dare laugh, I'll throttle you! I will, by the living jingo!".</p>
               <p>The party then climbed the bluff; went round to the drawbridge gate; found
                  admission, and the forlorn and<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7175-00000086"/> downcast
                  prisoners were soon met by Dumas, the first intimation either he or any in the
                  fort had of their absence. That courteous officer, after hearing Nymwha's story,
                  looked more surprised than pleased. At last he said: "Eh bien, messieurs, the
                  races to-day must have made you anxious to try our canoes; I trust you've had a
                  pleasant little trip."</p>
               <p>This quizzing tone was gall and wormwood to Talbot, and he with difficulty assumed
                  an indifferent air as he replied: "Not so bad, Captain, but our <hi rend="i"
                  />pic-nic ended too quick to suit us. Would you mind telling us what the Indians
                  have been doing since our impolite departure?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, dancing and yelling like mad! I'm told by one of our cadets, that you were
                  drawing something on paper this afternoon; will milord be kind enough to let me
                  see it?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Captain," said Talbot, knowing how vain a, refusal would be and
                  drawing out his rude plan of the fort. "'Tis but a rough sketch—a first
                  attempt—and no use now. I had to leave out the pretty face of Mademoiselle Fleury,
                  although her eyes are about the most formidable battery you have in the fort."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" replied Dumas, looking grave, after scanning the paper; "not so bad (pas si
                  mal). Le General Braddock might have seen something in it to praise. I am afraid I
                  have underrated your character and talents, milord. Our poor fort is not
                  attractive enough to hold you; I must, therefore, ask you to retire to the guard
                  house. I am chagrined (desolé) that I have no better quarters to offer.
                  Good-night, and pleasant dreams."</p>
               <p>"The same to you, Captain," gaily answered Talbot, with as <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >insouciant</foreign> an air as he could assume, as the guard led him and Smith
                  to the guard house. "Should anything occur outside, should be glad to hear it. Au
                  revoir!"</p>
               <p>And so Talbot found himself—in no enviable frame of mind, but with one companion
                  to share his solitude—in precisely the same place he was the night before. Here we
                  leave him for the present, while we see what happened to Jack and the de
                  Bonnevilles all this time.</p>

               <p>THE sultry, drowsy afternoon was well advanced when, after having found and left
                  in such a comfortable plight his burly and broken-winded pursuer, Captain Jack
                  escaped across the Allegheny. His late dry joke was, on the part of this strange,
                  stern, silent man, a proof that he was getting along pretty well, and very few of
                  our readers would go greatly astray in seeking the true cause of this, his
                  unwonted exhilaration.</p>
               <p>The weary scout at once sought the nearest covert, designing to lie closely
                  concealed in the thick woods along the river bank until a favoring dusk. He had
                  abundance to occupy his thick-crowding fancies. The exciting actions of the day
                  were soon forgotten, while the thought of Marie and his late strange meeting with
                  her, crept into his mind and heart, and filled them with a tide of unaccustomed
                  feelings. The stern, almost savage, expression of the revengeful Indian hunter—who
                  had had but one single object for which to live—gave way to a softer and more
                  humanizing feeling, and life took on for him new views and hopes.</p>
               <p>The old love for Marie was fast resuming its sway over him, and that sway—as is
                  the natural result of every pure, disinterested, heart affection—was a beneficent
                  and ennobling one. His whole life—and it had been, though short, a cheerless and
                  solitary one, with little admixture in it of anything but hard and stern and
                  passionate—came in review before him. There was needed, to round it off and fill
                  it with good purposes and kindly outflows, the advent of some strong, tender,
                  heart passion, one which, in love for another, teaches to forget one's self, and
                  which, by a merciful decree of the all-wise Father, is most graciously designed to
                  energize, enrich, develop, and glorify human character and life.</p>
               <p>When, therefore, Jack emerged from his retreat at the gloaming of the evening, and
                  crossed the hill to reach the "Four Mile Run," it was not his long rest, but a new
                  strength which had its springs deep down in his heart, that gave an unwonted
                  springiness to his tread, and which filled his eyes with a sparkle and a softness
                  to which they had been strangers for many a long, weary year.</p>
               <p>Descending into the quiet valley, and picking his way along the margin of the
                  merry little run that tripped its blithsome way over the pebbly bottom, he went as
                  fast as the gathering darkness would allow, and soon came upon the smouldering
                  camp fire of the de Bonnevilles, showing that the evening meal had been concluded.
                  Neither Marie, nor Wau-ki-na, nor M. de Bonneville was visible. All was silent and
                  desolate, and had it not been for the fire and old Dobbin, who was quietly
                  munching his grass, the place would have looked deserted.</p>
               <p>Cautiously stealing his way to the bower—for in the very midst of wary and artful
                  foes every step had to be taken with prudence—Jack peered within. None there but
                  Wau-ki-na and Marie. The young Indian girl, with head bent over some bead work,
                  was humming a low, mournful Delaware chant, while Marie sat before her easel, but
                     looking<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7175-00000088"/> far different than when Jack
                  last saw her thus employed. Now, her hand had fallen listlessly by her side; a
                  look of sadness and anxiety appeared on her face, and her fine, tender eyes were
                  filled with tears. A letter she had just finished reading, had fallen into her
                  lap, and the sigh she gave forth was so deep and expressive, that Waukina raised
                  her eyes, dropped her work and glided to her side.</p>
               <p>"What make my good lady so sad? Why she fall the tear? Is it because Wau-ki-na
                  must go way?"</p>
               <p>"Partly, that, my good, dear child, and partly because my life is now become
                  lonely and full of anxiousness. I feel forebodings of which I cannot get rid. Did
                  you not hear Edw—Captain Jack say he would be here early to-day and convey father
                  and me to the army?"</p>
               <p>He did, Miss Marie, but maybe he can no <emph>get</emph> here. The woods are now
                  full of Indian runners, and he must fly in air to come here in day time."</p>
               <p>That's just what I fear—<emph>have</emph> feared all day," excitedly exclaimed
                  Marie, rising from her stool and hurriedly walking the floor. "He's not the man to
                  promise and fail. Besides, the air has been full of dolorous sounds the whole day.
                  The fort guns were busy this morning, and then again this afternoon. What
                     <emph>can</emph> it mean? and how will it all end? I'm sure he's either killed
                  or a prisoner. I'll go this minute and—"</p>
               <p>"Well, Marie," rang in the cheery, sonorous tones of Jack's voice, "you never were
                  more mistaken in your life, for here stands Captain Jack—six feet two in his
                  moccasins—as good as twenty dead men yet, and only waiting invitation to
                  enter."</p>
               <p>The startled exclamations of surprise from both girls were followed on the part of
                  Marie by a hurried rush to the door, and a—</p>
               <p>"Oh, Edward, Edward! but I'm <emph>too</emph> rejoiced to see you safe here again!
                  I was afraid you never, <emph>never</emph> would come back. Where have you been
                  all day? What has happened you? What caused the fort firing to-day? Where's
                  Scarooyaddy, and—and—answer, quick! tell me all."</p>
               <p>"Well! there's woman for you. Will I answer those questions all on the fly, or
                  will I take them in order?" laughingly replied Jack, as he entered the hut. "Here,
                  Marie, is the letter you just dropped on the threshold, and which, if I mistake
                  not, has caused some of your tears. It looks like a man's write."</p>
               <p>"Where! where! give it me; it's nothing," hastily exclaimed Marie, grasping the
                  letter, and crumpling it up in her hand, the rosy color suffusing her cheeks and
                  mounting to her forehead.</p>
               <p>Jack looked grave for a moment, little suspecting that it was a youthful letter of
                  his own, written to her many years since, and which Marie, anxious and fearful
                  lest something had befallen him, had that day unearthed from her treasures. Almost
                  all women who have had heart histories—and who of them has not?—possess such
                  treasures, either of paper or of memory.</p>
               <p>"And now, Edward, tell me of your day, and why you were not back as promised,
                  early this morning. Since father reported to me your last night's parting advice;
                  we have discussed the matter and resolved to be ready to move at once, and
                     <emph>have</emph> been ready all day. I fear we have already stayed here too
                  long. Little matters, which otherwise would not have been noticed, have, under the
                  altered directions you have given our thoughts, taken a new significance."</p>
               <p>"<emph>What</emph> matters?" said Jack, a trifle less cordially than before. "Have
                  you been visited to-day by any from the fort?"</p>
               <p>"No; oh, no! But Captain Pipe, the Delaware Chief from Shannopinstown, and
                  Wau-ki-na's father—though I never can understand how such a man could be father
                     to<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7175-00000089"/> such a girl, they are so utterly
                  unlike in feature, color, disposition and manners—has been here to-day, with a few
                  of his followers, and behaved with so much haughtiness and showed so much
                  suspicious curiosity, that my worst fears have been aroused."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I know that Delaware Chief too well, Marie," fiercely exclaimed Jack; "a
                  false-hearted and blood-thirsty knave, and, I verily believe, a coward to boot. I
                  have been in search of the rascal for years, and he knows it well. I am led to
                  believe that he was one of the party that wiped out my home, and cruelly murdered
                  all that were dear to me. He certainly has not dared to say, or do anything here,
                  Marie, which would compel one to put him to a double, and a more instant
                  vengeance. If so, you must delay another day, and I will hunt him up, even in his
                  own town, and—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, Edward! run no unnecessary risks; if not for your own, yet for poor, dear
                  father's sake."</p>
               <p>"And where <emph>is</emph> your father, Marie?"</p>
               <p>"Down by the run there preparing a Caracara Eagle he shot late this afternoon. He
                  has been, for him, unusually anxious and restless all day; would come to me a
                  dozen times and wonder why you did not come; was disturbed by the sounds of the
                  distant firing—indeed, I never saw him so mistrustful before. He's ageing very
                  fast, of late, Edward; don't you think so?" and Marie's eyes softened with the
                  tenderest affection and solicitude.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Jack had never, even in the first flush of her girlhood, seen her look so
                  perfectly beautiful. There was such an engaging frankness, such a winning
                  naturalness in everything she said or did, that Jack gazed on her as one
                  spell-bound. His look was so steadfast and ardent, that even Marie could not but
                  notice it, and her eyes fell as her color mounted.</p>
               <p>"Why, yes—no, Marie—oh, I don't know, Marie. I think he's as hale and hearty as
                  ever. Not so much spring in his step or life in his eyes, perhaps, but he has
                  twenty good years in him yet."</p>
               <p>"Do you think so, Edward? Thanks, but I thought I've noted moods which are strange
                  to him. He rambles more, but to less purpose of late; communes more with himself;
                  talks much in his dreams, and babbles more of birds and flowers. It seems to me as
                  if his great life purpose was, as it were, burning him out. His eye—which you know
                  used to be like the eagle's for brightness and power—sometimes looks droopy and
                  faded-like; at others, it has an unnatural lustre as if fed by some internal,
                  consuming fever. Oh, my friend, what would I do if I lost him? He's everything to
                  me," and Marie could not restrain the tears from her eyes.</p>
               <p>"Why, Marie," said Jack, but evidently admiring while he chided, "this will never
                  do! You must have the <hi rend="i"/>megrims to-day. Drive such foolish notions
                  from your head! What did Pipe say of Wau-ki-na?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, he helped me there. I couldn't make up my mind to part with the dear
                  girl—have been trying all day to tell her she had better now go back to her
                  father, but every time I would approach her for that purpose, she would gaze at me
                  so tender and mournful-like and with such a look of anxiety and alarm in her fair
                  face, that the inhospitable words ever died on my lips, but her father, with much
                  peremptoriness, told me she must be sent right home; that the whole village was in
                  a clamor for her, and that it had selected her to paddle in a canoe race which it
                  seems is to take place near the fort sometime to-morrow, and so, amid our mutual
                  tears, she has consented to go. Do you know, Edward, I take a most singular and
                  unaccountable interest in that girl? Her face haunts me like some old picture or a
                  cherished memory, and, if you'll not be offended, Edward, 'tis of your dear,
                  sainted mother she often reminds<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7175-00000090"/> me—an
                  occasional look out of the eye, a tone of her voice, a certain cadence in her
                  laugh; 'tis the strangest thing—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, nonsense, Marie! Why, you're full of sentiment, to-night. Are you turning
                  poet out in these wild woods? An Indian girl, and daughter, too, of such an
                  abominable old scalp-lifter as Pipe, look like my sainted mother! Fie! for shame!
                  You'll be saying she looks like <emph>me,</emph> next; but let's go down to the
                  run. I'm too old a bird to be caught in this sort of a net; and you've many
                  strange visitors here?" And so they passed out, and on to the log on the stream's
                  margin.</p>
               <p>"And where's Scarooyaddy, Edward? I thought you could always rely on him."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Marie, there's the saddest part of this day's doings. He left me in the midst
                  of a hard fight, insisting that as he had brought me into a difficulty, he would
                  now get me out of one; said that you and your father needed my aid, and was so
                  obstinate in his purpose, that I was compelled to yield—a weakness I've been
                  blaming myself with all day."</p>
               <p>"What! is he killed, or captured?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, who knows? The chances were most fearfully against him—ten to one—and such
                  chiefs as our friend will not be taken alive if it can be helped. Death is vastly
                  preferred to torture; and yet, who can tell? The Chief was an old and wary
                  warrior; up to every turn, and shift, and device known to a born and bred Indian,
                  and the direction he took, looked to me as if he had a set object before him; but
                  let us sit down on this mossy log, and in this moonlight, and I will relate the
                  day's adventures, so you may judge for yourself. Well"—looking long and carefully
                  around—;" I've lived many, many years in the woods; have wintered and summered
                  them, and am familiar with all their wondrous changes and delights, but never do I
                  remember to have seen a more witching scene than this—quiet, but inexpressibly
                  lovely."</p>
               <p>And it <emph>was</emph> most beautiful and picturesque. The solemn sugar-tree
                  grove, with the moon's pale beams struggling through the leafy arches, flecking
                  and mottling the mead beneath with chasing lights and shadows; the prattling
                  little brook in front, laughing and singing its gladsome way to the Monongahela;
                  the steep and gloomy hill on the other side, one mass of verdure, and no sounds
                  around save those of the cricket, the katydid, and, ever and anon, the plaintive
                  and melancholy notes of the whip-poor-will, as he persistently poured forth to his
                  mate the only love song he knew. This radiant moon seemed to touch every object
                  with its pure, cool, chaste lights, not only to illumine, but to glorify. It might
                  truly be said of it, in a different sense than usual, "nihil tetigit quid non
                  ornavit." It was like the wand of enchantment.</p>

               <p>AND so there Jack and Marie sat under the beautiful moon, whose mellow light so
                  enriches a woodland scene like this; hiding whatever may be repulsive or
                  ungracious, and bringing into stronger prominence all that is lovely and most
                  attractive. You all have enjoyed just such nights and scenes as those, readers,
                  and many of you have sat and gossiped as did Marie and Edward.</p>
               <p>How Jack's eye kindled and flamed as he recounted the morning's escape over the
                  river from under the very guns of the fort; then the visit to old Shingiss' camp,
                  and then the brief but desperate encounter with the Shawnee band, when he and
                  Scarooyaddy parted company, and after, his own contest with and capture of the
                  burly Indian, whom he had left tied, and doubtless "clothed with curses as with a
                  garment."</p>
               <p>And how Marie listened, now pale, now flushed; now anxious, and now defiant; now
                  sorry for Scarooyaddy, and now glad for Jack; and thus the night was wearing on,
                  when all at once Marie, turning her head, saw a sight which froze her very blood
                  with horror. She clutched the scout by the arm, but could only point with her
                  finger. Jack looked, and there, at the end of the very log on which they both were
                  resting, a little removed out of the moonlight, sat a full-rigged Indian chief in
                  his war-paint—grim and motionless as a statue; fixed and rigid as marble, and
                  apparently as cold.</p>
               <p>Jack sprang up as if bitten by a rattlesnake, drew his tomahawk, threw himself
                  before Marie, and took a defiant attitude. No word, or look, or motion from the
                  Indian.</p>
               <p>"It's a ghost!" gasped Marie, her teeth chattering from fear, and ready to sink to
                  the ground.</p>
               <p>"Ghost or no ghost," hissed her companion, almost equally puzzled, his eyes fairly
                  starting with amazement, and his querying gaze thrown around in every direction,
                  "I must tackle it!"</p>
               <p>With tomahawk uplifted, Jack advanced towards the statue, and fairly stood beside
                  and almost over it; still no motion or sound. In a moment more, down would have
                  come Jack's keen hatchet on his ghostship's sconce, had not the uplifted arm been
                  arrested in mid-air, by a—</p>
               <p>"Ugh! The Black Rifle keep watch like a boy. The soft moonlight blind his eyes so
                  he no see. Indian meet young squaw, too, but he always keep one eye out for his
                  foe. Here your pet rifle, which I just now take from behind you."</p>
               <p>"The Half-King, by all that's good!" joyfully exclaimed Jack, throwing down his
                  tomahawk, and warmly and affectionately embracing the Chief. "Here! Marie, here's
                  the best 'spook' ever walked by moonlight. I forgive his rude joke on me, for very
                  gladness at his return. Halloo! Old<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7175-00000092"/>
                  fellow, where <emph>did</emph> you come from? Why, you look wet!"</p>
               <p>"Wet as muskrat, croaky as raven, and cold as frog," answered Scarooyaddy, now
                  condescending to loose his marble jaws and grin a little. "I soak in water up to
                  the mouf all afternoon. My brother must wring Scarooyaddy out; he very, very
                  damp."</p>
               <p>"That I will, Chief! But tell us all about it. The last I saw of you, you were
                  going towards the fort at heart-burst speed, and a baker's dozen of yelling
                  Shawnee after you."</p>
               <p>"Scarooyaddy pretty old; he no live so many snows for noting; he know what he
                  'bout. Shawnees"—looking contemptuously—"young fools, worse than squaws. Me first
                  hide rifle, and then lead them to the All-ghen-we. Me sit on log till wind come
                  back. Me fool them by singing death-chant, and then me dive under water like a
                  loon, but always wid eyes open. When first warrior shoot, he no hit, but me jump
                  and dance and toss arms all same. Shawnee tink me killed. No bit killed. No; very
                  much live. Me then take long dive, like bull-frog, go under the drift of logs and
                  bark, and come way up in the deep water, under the roots of the big buttonwood.
                  Understand? Eh? Many summers have passed over Scarooyaddy's head."</p>
               <p>"Well, they have, Chief, and no mistake. Who'd have thought, Marie, of that way of
                  escape but an Indian? Beat <emph>them</emph> for cunning and deviltries, who
                  can!"</p>
               <p>"And, Scarooyaddy," broke in Marie, "did you know of this place and tree
                  before?"</p>
               <p>"The 'Wood-thrush' very young, or she no ask that. Scarooyaddy often catch fish
                  from that tree. When his line get fast, he often go down under to see. He knew
                  water very deep there, and the ground all washed from under. A wise chief'tink of
                     <emph>all</emph> dese ting."</p>
               <p>"And how long was you under the roots?" asked, Marie.</p>
               <p>"Two, three, four, several hour." And then he laughed a most peculiar, hollow
                  laugh, which seemed to come up somewhere from near the region of his belt, but
                  which altered not one particle the expression of his face. "Fort officers, many
                  Delaware, and Shawnee and other chiefs, old friends, new enemies, come over to
                  island all afternoon, and, walk over Scarooyaddy's head, and talk about him, and
                  him sitting like a blood-noun', a winking and a blinking of his eyes, and a
                  laughing and a scolding all the time. Bime-by all go away, the dark come, and
                  Scarooyaddy swim to shore, hunt his rifle, jump into canoe, and here him.
                  Ugh!"</p>
               <p>The brave old Chief had never yet done anything which seemed to please him so much
                  as this—an exploit wherein he had outwitted the whole assembled tribes. Every now
                  and then, cold and wet as he was, he would suddenly open wide his mouth, and fetch
                  up one of his mechanical, guttural, stomachic laughs—<foreign xml:lang="LAT">vox
                     et præterea nihil</foreign>—and then as quickly subside into a grave and
                  dignified silence.</p>
               <p>At last, after hearing all the particulars, Jack said: "Well, Chief, I'm downright
                  glad to have you back again. We've heavy business yet before us, but with you near
                  me, we'll enter on it with more heart. Marie, while I hunt up your father, wont
                  you give the Chief what food and fire you have? He's as wet as a mussel, and as
                  empty as its cast-off shell."</p>
               <p>Jack now proceeded down the stream a little, and soon came on M. de Bonneville,
                  very busily engaged over his great treasure, a blazing pine knot throwing a circle
                  of light around him. With all the skill and care of a professional taxidermist, he
                  was taking off the skin of the eagle, and dressing it most carefully, smoothing
                  down, caressingly, every brilliant feather, and making it look as natural and
                  life-like as possible. Jack fondly watched the rare old enthusiast as he crooned
                  over the bird an old French song,<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7175-00000093"/> as if
                  it had been a child, and stroked down its pied and iridescent plumage as if it had
                  been that child's silken hair, and finally said:</p>
               <p>"Good evening, M. de Bonneville, and what have you there? A 'rara avis' by the
                  look of it."</p>
               <p>The old devotee started, paused from his absorbing work, while a puzzled
                  expression went over his delicate face, and at last said:</p>
               <p>"Why, Edward Percy, when did you return, boy? We've been looking for you all day.
                  I'll tell Marie you're back again. She'll be downright rejoiced to see you. Here,
                  Marie! Marie!"</p>
               <p>"No occasion, monsieur. I've met Marie, and I've come to see what
                     <emph>you're</emph> about."</p>
               <p>"You have, have you? Well, lad, I'll right gladly show you," and with eye lit up
                  with the sacred fire of a noble enthusiasm, he went forward and led Jack
                  reverently by the hand to where the bird lay, as if it had been some sacred Ibis
                  of his faith, which this High Priest of Nature was guarding with zealous care from
                  all profane eyes. "'Tis a rare good fortune, Edward, to find a Brazilian eagle in
                  such a high latitude. 'Tis a native of the fervent tropics. I've heard it spoken
                  of, and intended next season to make a voyage to the gulf, in search of it and
                  other specimens. Look, laddie, at the graceful shape and the beautiful sweep of
                  its scimitar wings, the cut of its beak and the brilliance of its plumage, which,
                  however, has already much faded. Oh, you should have seen it when it first
                  fluttered to the ground. 'Twas a most royal bird, with an eye of fire, and a port
                  of grace. I tell you such glorious and iris-hued birds will wait no man's leisure;
                  why, their bright hues change like the chameleons, even as you look, while death
                  fades and tarnishes all their finer tints."</p>
               <p>"And where did you happen to see it?"</p>
               <p>"I was strolling, rifle in hand, along the river bank this afternoon, wondering
                  what could be the meaning of the firing at the fort, when I heard a strange cry in
                  the air right above me. On looking up I saw this majestic bird, sweeping around on
                  motionless wing, in magnificent circles. I took to the trees to watch it. Finally
                  it descended, not two hundred yards from me, where lay the carcass of a young fawn
                  which some hunter had left on a little grass spot on the bank. How lordly it
                  stalked up to it, and with what an aristocratic air? Breathless I crept up close,
                  crawling on my stomach to get a better shot. Twice it raised its head, and flew
                  off a little distance, evidently having caught notice of me. I was so nervous that
                  I could not draw a steady bead on it. At last, as it got eye of me, and was flying
                  off for good, I risked a shot and luckily brought it down," and the old man looked
                  triumphant.</p>
               <p>While Jack was inspecting the bird in his hands, his thoughts began to wander to
                  the grave business of the morrow, but the steadfastness of his gaze was
                  misinterpreted by the venerable naturalist, who exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"I know it, lad, and I feel it: you are looking at that yawning rent in the neck.
                  If <emph>you</emph> had been the shooter, the bullet would have gone two inches
                  higher up, straight through the head, so as not to have marred the brilliancy of
                  that iris-hued plumage. 'Twas awkwardly done by me, I confess it, Percy, but 'twas
                  either that or nothing."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, M. de Bonneville, you mistake. I was rather studying the best way of
                  getting off to-morrow. 'Twould be useless to conceal that our path to the army is
                  beset with perils. This is the 5th, and Braddock expects to be at the fort by the
                  8th. He can't, therefore, be more than twenty miles away. God grant we may be
                  allowed that distance, in quiet, but I doubt it."</p>
               <p>"What! Edward!" anxiously exclaimed the old naturalist<pb n="178-179"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000094"/> alist, now thoroughly alarmed, "Do you fear
                  pursuit? Let's start this very night! I'm sure Marie—"</p>
               <p>"Better very early to-morrow; we'd make more progress; besides, Wau-ki-na must
                  first go home. No, no, sir. Have everything ready for a go by early dawn; and
                  you'd better let Scarooyaddy and me manage the expedition."</p>
               <p>"By all means, Edward. We'll trust all to you, and now let us join the
                  others."</p>
               <p>They found Scarooyaddy, Marie, and Wau-ki-na at the bower, and an hour or so was
                  passed in arranging details for the morrow. At last they separated for the night,
                  de Bonneville offering Jack and the Half-King a spread in his apartment.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no," said Jack, "that would never do; we'd be snared like beavers in a trap.
                  The Chief and I have much to talk over, but we'll keep within watching distance.
                  We hardly expect any on our trail to-night, however, but to-morrow—look out! Come,
                  Chief, we must to rest."</p>
               <p>The two retired to the very base of the hill, then lay down at the foot of a huge
                  white-oak, and commenced a low but earnest conversation. Soon they heard the
                  sweet, tremulous notes of de Bonneville's flute creeping up towards them; now
                  full, now faint; now rising, falling, swaying, dying, until it seemed the very
                  trees bent down to listen, so inexpressibly soft and plaintive were those "wood
                  notes wild." De Bonneville appeared to be pouring forth his most mournful farewell
                  to the loved scenes of the past few weeks, and the feeling and expression he threw
                  into his notes, were indeed most marvellous. It almost seemed as if the very notes
                  were in tears.</p>
               <p>The old Chief, raising himself attentively on one arm, drank it all in in silence,
                  while Jack could scarce breathe, so tender and witching was the weird spell thrown
                  over him. At last the notes died away, as it were, in a low sob or wail, when Jack
                  first spoke:</p>
               <p>"Chief, what think you of that sweet 'good-night?' Marie tells me her father
                  always rounds off the evening thus. 'Tis his vesper hymn to the Great Spirit; and
                  if ever that Spirit had pure and devout worshipper, he has one in de
                  Bonneville."</p>
               <p>"I no understand him," answered the Indian, doggedly; "he too old and thin to
                  wander about in the woods that-a-way. He kill too many little birds, and make too
                  mournful music. Me tink something not all right here," touching his head
                  significantly.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, of course, Chief, 'tis the way of the world. What it can't understand,
                  it must abuse and belittle; besides—"</p>
               <p>"Me like the pale-faced squaw, though. She beautiful as the night, and have a
                  voice like the wood-thrush, and a laugh like the ripple of pleasant waters.
                  She—"</p>
               <p>"Chief!" petulantly interrupted Jack, jealous even of the admiration of a savage;
                  "for a man of your years, you're a great goose; you ought to be ashamed of
                  yourself' and you'd better go straight to sleep; we must make an early start
                  to-morrow."</p>
               <p>It was a long time, however, before the scout followed his own advice.</p>

               <p>THE first streak of dawn saw the whole party on their feet. While Marie and
                  Wau-ki-na hastily prepared breakfast, de Bonneville gathered up all his goods—his
                  precious packages of specimens and drawings, while Jack and the Indian fastened
                  them on Dobbin, and all was made ready for instant motion. Everything, almost,
                  depended on an early start. The danger lay in two directions—from pursuers in the
                  rear, and from returning runners and scouting parties in front.</p>
               <p>The frugal meal concluded, Marie first nerved herself to part with Wau-ki-na, who
                  clung to her like a very shadow, her eyes swoollen with weeping, and her girlish,
                  nut-brown face looking so sad and wo-begone, that all were moved to pity, but it
                  had to be done and done quickly.</p>
               <p>Marie managed the matter with great tact and tenderness, loading Wau-ki-na with
                  presents; assuring her they would soon meet again; twining her arms about her in
                  most affectionate embraces, and bidding her "good-bye" at least a dozen times.</p>
               <p>It seemed, however, as if the poor girl, <emph>could</emph> not tear herself away;
                  she stood mute, paralyzed, her bosom heaving and sobbing, and her face bathed in
                  tears, until even Marie was so affected she was compelled abruptly to leave her
                  standing at the threshold of the hut, and to rejoin her companions.</p>
               <p>Wan-ki-na finally withdrew, sobbing, and casting many mournful, lingering looks
                  behind. Jack and de Bonneville threw to her cheery farewells, but Marie sat by the
                  run, unable to trust herself to look around. It was not until the young, amiable
                  Indian girl was fairly out of sight, that Marie raised her tearful eyes.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Edward! that was a hard, hard parting for me. You cannot imagine how her
                  young life has twined itself in mine; I did not know, myself, till this morning.
                  For two months, now, we have been almost inseparable, and her face has the
                  strangest influence over me. My very heart goes after her. Would it be wrong,
                  Edward, to call her back and take her with us? She begged me this morning, with
                  tears and sobs, to let her go wherever <emph>I</emph> would go."</p>
               <p>"Yes, very wrong! Marie," replied Jack. "She is a dear, good girl, and I'm
                  strangely drawn to the little minx myself, but she wouldn't thrive away from her
                  own tribe. The great mystery to <emph>me</emph> is, how such a sweet, fair, and
                  graceful girl can have such a shrivelled-up old parchment as Pipe for her father;
                  but the world's full of strange mysteries—a bigger one than this is now being
                  unravelled for me," and with this comforting assurance, Jack briskly led the way
                  down the run to the Monongahela, followed by de Bonneville, his daughter, and old
                  Dobbin, while Scarooyaddy, his watchful eyes never resting for an instant, brought
                  up the rear.</p>
               <p>On the very verge of the maple grove, Marie could not refrain from turning and
                  gazing long and wistfully at the<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7175-00000096"/> sweet
                  sylvan scene of so much tranquil happiness. The whole place seemed redolent with
                  the aromas which rose like morning incense, not alone from the dewy earth, but
                  from grass, shrub, vine and flower. Every bough and twig and fern seemed a
                  fragrant censer for Nature's purely-distilled perfumes. Her father seemed to
                  divine and even to share her thoughts; and quietly gliding back to her side, he
                  wound his arm about her, and slowly and affectionately led her from the spot. It
                  was like Eve leaving Eden, with her—"and must I then leave thee, Paradise?"</p>
               <p>The order of march had been fixed as above, and it was thought best to go along
                  the margin of the river, since the scouts and runners to and from Braddock's army
                  took a more direct course back from the water and along the uplands.</p>
               <p>The morning was a most beautiful one, and the course through the open woods
                  skirting the river was a constant succession of lovely views and varying delights.
                  It was impossible long to withstand the freshness and buoyant influences of such a
                  journeying, and the spirits of the whole party rose with each advancing step.</p>
               <p>No attempt whatever was made to cover up their trail. It would have been useless.
                  Jack and the Half-King did, indeed, suggest the night before, that old Dobbin and
                  the packages should be left until the army had advanced and taken the fort, but
                  the very idea was received with so much alarm and anxiety on the part of de
                  Bonneville—many months of whose life were wrought into those portfolios—that it
                  was dropped as soon as broached, and so all, trusting to good fortune, trudged
                  cheerily and hopefully along, de Bonneville or Marie occasionally wandering from
                  the direct course to pluck a fern or a flower or take a view of the river, and
                  Jack or the Indian to stop and listen and scrutinize, so that they might not run
                  into danger at unawares.</p>
               <p>All that could be done, either to avoid peril or to skilfully and bravely
                  encounter and overcome it, might surely be entrusted to those two wary and
                  experienced leaders. They seemed to have at once eyes in every part of their
                  heads, and not a leaf stirred or a bird hopped, that did not on the instant arrest
                  their attention.</p>
               <p>They had steadily advanced thus over an hour on their loitering course, without
                  anything to betoken danger, when Jack, under the pretence of tightening Dobbin's
                  girth, spoke in low tones to de Bonneville:</p>
               <p>"Don't be at all alarmed, but 'tis, sir, as I feared. We're pursued."</p>
               <p>"What! where?" excitedly exclaimed de Bonneville; "I see nothing, hear
                  nothing!"</p>
               <p>"Sh-h-h, gently, gently, my good sir. Don't let Marie know, please. Look at
                  Scarooyaddy!"</p>
               <p>The old Chief had fallen very far into the rear, and was rapidly gliding from tree
                  to tree, now stopping, now running, now aiming his rifle, and now resuming his
                  course again.</p>
               <p>"I can't, of course, tell how many are on our trail," resumed Jack, "but you may
                  depend that all that <emph>can</emph> be done <emph>will</emph> be done by the
                  Half-King to keep our pursuers at bay. We are now leaving the 'narrows,' and must
                  hasten on, or the redskins will work around us."</p>
               <p>"All's lost!" said de Bonneville. "What's to be done? I'll go back and explain.
                  They all know me and will reverence my gray hairs."</p>
               <p>"Gray hairs," sadly whispered Jack, "they'd hanker after them as a new color on
                  their legging fringes. If you went back you'd be riddled with bullets like a
                  sieve. No, no; rather you and Marie hasten forward with all possible speed. I
                     <emph>had</emph> hoped, by travelling all night, to reach Braddock; but it
                  seems it can't be done. Fortunately, Frazier, the Scotch trader's house, is now
                  within a brief half mile. You must make straight for that, and tell Jennie and
                     the<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7175-00000097"/> gude wife to make all ready for
                  the defence. I must go back and join the Chief."</p>
               <p>"What! and leave Marie and me?"</p>
               <p>"Even so. Our danger lies now entirely from the rear. For God's sake! don't
                  parley, sir, but push on, push on, without one instant's delay!" so saying, Jack,
                  with piece at cock and with kindling eye, rejoined the Half-King, just as the
                  rifle of the old Indian delivered its spiteful fire, and the foremost Indian
                  pursuer was doubled up in a trice.</p>
               <p>"Hurrah! Chief, here I be." Now commences about our fiftieth fight together. Have
                  a care, Yaddy! Keep behind your tree; I see a bead drawn on you. Quick! quick!
                  load up and I'll fetch that varlet myself. Ready?—so"—and Jack waited till the
                  tufted head popped out for a shot, when, quick as lightning, his long black rifle
                  was up and off.</p>
               <p>"Ha! Ha!" as the fellow dropped at the base of his tree and wriggled in the bush;
                  "ye'll know plaguey soon who you've got to deal with. Keep off!" he shouted
                  excitedly, "if you want whole pelts to your bodies."</p>
               <p>Jack was one of those worthies whose spirits rose with the occasion. He kept up a
                  running fire of talk and exclamations, but never for a moment forgot just the
                  right thing to do.</p>
               <p>This second shot was the signal, on the part of the pursuers, for a general rush
                  forward from tree to tree, and a combined yell which made the very woods to ring.
                  A patter of bullets crashed around, one of them striking the butt of Jack's
                  rifle.</p>
               <p>"Whoop! but the snaky, slippery varmints are swarming. Why, if there's one, Yaddy,
                  there's twenty of them—Shawnees too! I fear me, Chief, we'll have to run for it.
                  Back! back to the next tree!" Both now made a short, quick, zig-zag run back for a
                  hundred yards and got behind their trees. Jack commenced reloading. All was
                  silent; not an Indian could be seen, but an arm was here and there visible,
                  ramming home its bullet. They had been taught wariness, and knew who fronted
                  them.</p>
               <p>The scout, as soon as he was loaded again, shook off his skin cap, put it on the
                  end of his ramrod, and slowly and cautiously pushed it out from the tree. Five or
                  six cracks and two bullets right through the skin, told of the success of his
                  device.</p>
               <p>"Didn't think they'd do it, Yaddy, blamed if I did; 'twas a stale, old trick, but
                  thought I might as well try it;" adding contemptuously, "they must be younkers.
                  Now for another run back." This time they made a rush of about <emph>two</emph>
                  hundred yards, keeping their trees as much in line as possible.</p>
               <p>All this took time, and time was just what the two were most anxious to gain.
                  Marie and de Bonneville were by this well on to Frazier's cabin.</p>
               <p>"Now, Chief, you watch your best chance for a shot, and then we must cut for it.
                  The ground's widening here, and I fear the rascals will flank us and get in our
                  rear. Halloo! What does <emph>this</emph> mean?" as some rifle cracks were heard
                  some distance behind them, one of the bullets plunging into the tree right by
                  Jack's head, and the other actually pinning Scarooyaddy's scalp lock to his
                  tree.</p>
               <p>It was just as he feared. Three of the redskins had, while the two scouts were
                  keeping back the rest, climbed along the side of the hill and got directly in
                  their rear. They were now between two fires.</p>
               <p>"Come, Chief, this is murder! by heavens, we'll be slaughtered like rats in a
                  hole. We've drawn <emph>their</emph> fire and are loaded ourselves. Let us turn
                  tail and make square at those in our rear with the tomahawk."</p>
               <p>No sooner said than done. The two turned short around, and bounded with tremendous
                  leaps right down on the couple of Indians now reloading, Jack first making a wing
                  shot at the third one, who went sneaking and limping off, with<pb n="186-187"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000098"/> no stomach left for the fight. Jack made easy work
                  with <emph>his</emph> Indian, who, as the white hunter panted up and made a leap
                  and a stroke together, dropped his rifle. The tomahawk missed its mark, and there
                  was an instant grapple, a heavy fall and a blow.</p>
               <p>Jack was too quick and powerful for his swarthy foe. He grasped him by the throat,
                  and pressed it till the Indian grew fairly purple in the face; till his tongue
                  protruded, his eyeballs stood out from their sockets, and the blood gushed from
                  his nostrils. Giving him a final and terrible hug and punch, Jack threw him off
                  like a squeezed lemon; leaped to his feet, recovered his rifle, and was bounding
                  off again, when he saw Scarooyaddy and a powerful young Shawnee chief engaged in a
                  death grapple. The old Half-King was making the most desperate efforts, but so,
                  too, was his opponent. They rolled and twisted and struggled, the young Shawnee
                  having on account of Scarooyaddy's age and wounded arm, rather the best of it,
                  until Jack ran to his friend's assistance.</p>
               <p>"'Tis a very pretty fight as it stands, Chief, but fair play's no jewel
                     <emph>here!</emph> I hardly know which is which, you're so jumbled and mixed
                  up, but I'll punch <emph>this</emph> peeled head at a venture," and Jack crunched
                  the butt of his rifle hard in the Shawnee's face. "Now, Yaddy, let's be off, or
                  the whole gang will be in front of us to fight."</p>
               <p>So saying, the two took to their heels, and ran with most desperate energy,
                  Frazier's isolated log house now hove into view—a most welcome sight. A shout from
                  Jack, to let the inmates know of their approach; the heavy oaken door swung back
                  on its rude, wooden hinges, and closed behind them with a rattle of the huge bar;
                  the bullets from the pursuers pattered against the outside, and a loud yell of
                  baffled rage filled the air, as both our heroes fell panting and exhausted to the
                  floor. A narrow escape, truly. All safe for the present.</p>

               <p>A LONG lull now ensued. The discomfited foe drew off in silence to the cover of
                  the surrounding woods, to concert a vigorous and successful assault. Jack and the
                  Half-King gradually recovered breath, and rose to take account of their situation
                  and to plan a defence. They were both well aware of the numbers and devilish
                  ingenuity of their enemies, and the situation was sufficiently grave—not to say
                  desperate—to command their most anxious solicitude.</p>
               <p>There was, however, no thought of quailing or despair. If either knew the thoughts
                  of the other, he kept up a most resolute port and an unfaltering eye for the other
                  inmates of the cabin. With the exception of one end of the Half-King's scalp-lock
                  having been carried off and his recent wound having broken out afresh, and Jack's
                  having received a tomahawk gash and a sprain from his tussle with the Indian, both
                  were in good condition.</p>
               <p>The house of Frazier, the Scotch gunsmith and Indian trader—then serving with
                  Braddock's army—was the most<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7175-00000099"/> western
                  habitation of that day. It was of the same build and character as most of the
                  frontier cabins of the time—fashioned out of rude, notched logs, cut from the
                  surrounding forest, without the use of either nail or spike. (See <hi rend="i"
                  />Appendix M.)</p>
               <p>The roof was made of huge, unhewn clap-boards, overlapping and stretching from
                  pole to pole. The floor was formed of puncheons made by splitting trees about
                  eighteen inches in diameter, and hewing the faces with a broad axe. These were
                  then laid on sleepers. The great chimney was also built of logs, and made large
                  enough to admit of a back and jams of stone.</p>
               <p>The cracks between the logs were filled with billets, and daubed over with
                  mud-mortar. The inside of this backwoods cabin corresponded in rudeness and
                  simplicity with the outside. A huge table was made of a split slab, supported by
                  four rough legs, set in auger holes. A number of three-legged stools were
                  fashioned in the same manner. Rough, wooden pins stuck in the logs around the
                  house, upheld clap-board shelves, or served to support garments, vegetables, and
                  what not, while the rifles and hunting accoutrements—of which every pioneer cabin
                  had a most liberal supply—depended from huge buck's antlers fastened over the
                  chimney and around the walls.</p>
               <p>This particular cabin of Frazier's fortunately formed an exception to others, in
                  that, from its very exposed situation, it was made somewhat like a
                  block-house—that is, the second story projected beyond and over the first about
                  eighteen inches all around, leaving an opening at the bottom of the projection, so
                  that those inside and above could fire downward and prevent any enemy from making
                  a lodgement under the walls. A number of sloping port-holes had also been left at
                  convenient distances.</p>
               <p>Frazier's cabin stood right on the bluff of the Monongahela, and was pretty well
                  protected on that side by nature. The trees had been cut around in a semi-circle,
                  and all cleared away, with the exception of one huge walnut at the chimney end,
                  which threw its broad branches over the roof, affording a most grateful shade.</p>
               <p>Jack and the Half-King, in their first search, found an ample supply of rifles and
                  ammunition, and were so much pleased with their careful survey of the whole
                  premises, and the staunchness of door, chimney and walls, that they gathered fresh
                  hope, and seemed prepared to withstand quite a siege. It was not a direct assault
                  they so much apprehended, as some devilish stratagem or device of their enemies by
                  fire. It was concluded best to send M. de Bonneville and the three females to the
                  attic story, which was reached by a rude ladder and floored with pinned
                  clapboards; but to this the old gentleman would not consent, insisting he could be
                  of service in loading the guns, handing ammunition, etc.</p>
               <p>All was now ready for whatever might happen. While Jack ranged around the cabin,
                  perfecting all needful preparations, the Half-King stood by a loop-hole, looking
                  out toward the forest. Not a sign of an enemy. All was still, calm, and sultry as
                  a desert. It was now nearing noon; not a leaf or a blade of grass was stirring; no
                  sign of life except old Dobbin, who could not be gotten inside soon enough, and
                  who was lazily cropping the herbage before the doorstep.</p>
               <p>A sudden "<emph>Ugh!</emph>" from Scarooyaddy, and an immediate stiffening up of
                  his whole frame, betokened something unusual. Jack jumped to a loop-hole, and saw
                  two unarmed Indians approaching, carrying branches in their hand, which, as they
                  approached, they waved in sign of peace.</p>
               <p>"Who are they, Chief? and what do you make of them?" whispered Jack.</p>
               <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7175-00000100"/>
               <p>"It's Catahecassa, or Blackhoof, one of the most noted young chiefs of the
                  Shawnees." (See <hi rend="i"/>Appendix N.)</p>
               <p>"It is, is it? Well, Cassy or no Cassy, he comes no further without a challenge!
                  Halloo! Halt, there! you bloody rapscallions or you're dead Indians! No nonsense!
                  Say your say where you stand and be quick about it!" shouted Jack.</p>
               <p>He who was called "Blackhoof" then smiled and bowed, waved his hands and called on
                  Scarooyaddy, who asked in the Shawnee dialect what he wanted.</p>
               <p>Blackhoof then commenced a most artful and palavering speech; praising the courage
                  of The Black Rifle and the Half-King; telling them they had just made a most
                  gallant fight; stating how much the latter's pretended drowning and subsequent
                  escape had moved the admiration of both French and Indians, and laughingly going
                  over Jack's tying exploit with their big Shawnee chief. He then spoke of de
                  Bonneville and Marie; how much <emph>they</emph> had been liked and protected
                  during the spring, and concluded by stating that they—the Indians—were ten to one;
                  that no help was near, and that it was useless to contend against numbers; and
                  offering to protect and care for them, if they would open the door and
                  surrender.</p>
               <p>All this was duly reported to Jack, on whom it made but very slight impression. He
                  knew well the cruel, treacherous nature of the foe he had to deal with.</p>
               <p>"Well, Chief, ask the murderous villians what if we don't! what if we don't! What
                  then?"</p>
               <p>Well, then, came back the reply, they would have to take the house the best way
                  they could, and if all in it were killed, scalped, or burnt up, they would have
                  only themselves to blame.</p>
               <p>This raised Jack's ire. He couldn't wait for the Half-King, but shouted:</p>
               <p>"Be off with you! you bloody, slaughtering, scalp-tearing varmints, or I'll drive
                  a bullet straight through your tawny hides! Vanish! get out! away with you! Not a
                  word more, or I'll drop you in your very tracks!" and he actually projected his
                  long black rifle through the port-hole.</p>
               <p>Blackhoof knew enough English to at once comprehend Jack's meaning. His whole
                  countenance changed on the instant to one of savage ferocity; and brandishing his
                  arms, and shaking his clenched fists, he rapidly retreated, giving forth a most
                  terrific war-whoop, which was taken up by at least a score of Indians skulking
                  under the trees.</p>
               <p>Blackhoof then suddenly whipped out a short rifle, concealed about his person, and
                  shot directly at Jack's porthole, while his companion did the same at poor Dobbin,
                  who fell almost before he knew what hurt him, and lay struggling and writhing
                  right before their very eyes.</p>
               <p>Hostilities then commenced in earnest. Volley after volley of bullets came
                  pattering against the logs and oaken door, but with no other effect than so much
                  hail. Jack and the Indian contented themselves with firing long shots only when
                  they saw any part of a foe exposed. These exposures, however, were seldom made, as
                  the Indians seemed to have a wholesome dread of their rifles. The firing soon died
                  away, and silence reigned so long, that de Bonneville expressed the belief that
                  the enemy had altogether retreated.</p>
               <p>Jack and his companion both shook their heads. They knew better, the Indian
                  character. They were only planning some new deviltry.</p>
               <p>About three of the afternoon, a sudden but smothered exclamation was heard from
                  Marie, who had gone up to the loft to remain with her father, he being utterly
                  worn out with the excitement of the day.</p>
               <p>"What is it, Marie? what do you see?"</p>
               <p>With face blanched with fear, Marie stood at the head of the ladder and motioned
                  him up. Quietly Jack ascended<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7175-00000101"/> the rude
                  rounds, when Marie took him to the projection overlooking the extreme west angle
                  of the cabin, and there, close to the cabin wall, and on the very edge of the
                  bluff, stood no less than seven Indians, while one or two others were crawling,
                  like venomous serpents, along the river bank to take their position in line, and
                  then to make a rush <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en masse.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>It was enough to appal a stouter heart than Jack's. His hair fairly stood on end.
                  His breath came thick and fast. Not one instant to lose. Quickly descending, he
                  told Scarooyaddy of this new danger from such an unexpected source. A large kettle
                  of water was boiling on the fire, and Jack filled all the vessels he could get and
                  quietly handed them above. Ascending then himself, he stationed the three women,
                  and took his own position with the Half-King. When all was ready, signal was
                  passed; two rifle cracks were heard, and the boiling water was poured right down
                  on to the heads of the Indian file, and such a scampering and howling and yelling
                  was heard as would have been supremely ridiculous at any other time. As the
                  result, one very dead Indian lay close to the cabin wall, while another, evidently
                  grievously wounded, lay writhing in pain, working himself to the bluff's edge, and
                  then rolling himself completely over and out of sight.</p>
               <p>Jack drew a long breath and could not refrain exchanging smiles and
                  congratulations with the Half-King, exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"Well, Chief, I do not count that as a brilliant success. You tried
                     <emph>cold</emph> water yesterday, and it was healthy, but scalding hot water
                  is not so soothing. It bites like mustard, and flays like a scalping-knife. Your
                  countrymen have found out the peculiarity of a block-house build. What next, think
                  you?"</p>
               <p>The Chief gave out one of his ghastly, mechanical laughs, saying:</p>
               <p>"Scarooyaddy not know—but something very bad. He now very old, but never saw
                  Shawnee make such big jumps or so funny noises," and the old fellow, followed by
                  Jack, made for thé ladder and chuckled all the way down.</p>
               <p>They were not long in finding out "what next." The redskins seemed fairly maddened
                  with their late punishment, and an hour later the Chief hurriedly called Jack to
                  the front of the house again. There was a low, thatched stable at some little
                  distance, to which the Indians set fire, and while the flames were at their
                  highest, a rude cart with heavy, block wheels, and filled high up with hay, was
                  seen to roll forward by some unseen agency. When near the house, first appeared a
                  smoke, and then a bright flame burst out. The old cart, with its bursting flames,
                  and big pile of combustible material, was thrust up hard against the cabin wall
                  and right under the projection.</p>
               <p>The inmates stood fairly dismayed and paralyzed at this new and imminent danger.
                  Jack and his companion were for a moment appalled. Before they could get a shot at
                  the fiendish monsters who had moved up behind the hay as a bulwark, they had
                  leaped away and got safely off.</p>
               <p>The smoke was now becoming stifling, and the dry clapboards on the roof began to
                  warp and curl and crackle with the heat. A half minute more and the whole house
                  would have been on fire, but Jack was equal to the danger. It was no time for half
                  measures—here was an emergency demanding prompt and heroic treatment. He quickly,
                  therefore, drew back the bar, threw open the door, and with a "Follow me, Chief,
                  what those pitiless demons can do we can at least <emph>undo,</emph>" rushed
                  out.</p>
               <p>The two then got under and behind the cart, and pushed it out to a safe distance
                  beyond the house, and then rushed back amid a shower of bullets. With Jack's rifle
                  at one angle, and the Half-king's at the other angle of the house, it would have
                  been sure death for any Indian to have<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7175-00000102"/>
                  again approached, and so they were fain content to see the hay pile and cart
                  harmlessly consumed before their eyes. It was a wonderful escape, though, from a
                  horrible death, and every occupant of the house felt it most deeply.</p>
               <p>Jack looked at Scarooyaddy, and the Chief at him. Both shook their heads.</p>
               <p>"What say you, Chief, shall we give up, open the door, and trust to the mercies of
                  those lambs of Shawnees? May be <emph>you</emph> might make some kind of terms for
                  us."</p>
               <p>"No! no! my brother," vehemently and bitterly broke out the Half-King, "too much
                  kill, too much kill! Indian very, very mad; never forgive the boiling water, and
                  the blood blind his eyes and make his heart like stone. 'Twould be this for
                  all—may be worse," and Scarooyaddy drew the back of his sharp knife around his
                  scalp-lock.</p>
               <p>"As you say, Chief. That's <emph>my</emph> creed, but thought I'd ask you. We'll
                  have to fight it out, but blest if I ain't bothered to guess what the varmints
                  will do next. We've fought them many's the time before, but we never were in a
                  trap like this. Do you see them?"</p>
               <p>No, not one could be seen or heard—all was silent again as the grave. The carcass
                  of old Dobbin, and the smoking ashes of the cart and hay alone told of an enemy's
                  presence.</p>

               <p>IT was now about five of the evening, and so long a time had elapsed since there
                  was any indication of the Shawnees, that even Scarooyaddy began to hope they had
                  finally abandoned the assault as hopeless, or else were waiting for
                  reinforcements.</p>
               <p>Ah, delusive, short-lived hope! The two were quietly sitting speculating as to the
                  whereabouts of Braddock's army, and what course they would take that night to
                  reach it, and how and when they would set out, when all at once a horrible shock
                  and crash and clatter were heard in the loft, immediately followed by the crack of
                  a rifle and a series of women's screams.</p>
               <p>"My God! what is that?" cried Jack, his hair fairly lifting on his head, as he
                  made one bound for the ladder, closely followed by Scarooyaddy. A moment more and
                  he was in the crowded room, glaring around like a tiger who has been robbed of its
                  whelps. What a sorry spectacle was there! In one corner lay poor, old M. de
                  Bonneville, insensate, the blood oozing from a bullet wound, and apparently hurt
                  to the death. There stood three dusky, ferocious and horrid looking savages, and
                  another was just coming through a broad hole in the roof. Jack glared<pb
                     n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7175-00000103"/> from one to the other, scarce knowing
                  where to commence. He soon made decision.</p>
               <p>One of the brutes had his red hand twined in Marie's long tresses, and was just
                  about to draw around the fatal scalping-knife, when Jack with a fierce howl of
                  rage was upon him with the tomahawk.</p>
               <p>"There, take that, and that, and <emph>that,</emph> you infernal hell-hound!—and
                  now show me another." He turned, and saw the Half-King in a death-grapple with
                  one, while another huge, glistering fellow had retreated to a corner, absolutely
                  cowering before Jack's blazing, devouring look. "You, too!" and Jack leaped at his
                  throat, and shook, and tore, and worried and throttled him, bearing him violently
                  to the floor by the very impetuosity of his attack.</p>
               <p>He had succeeded in doubling him up, and was actually squeezing, and crunching,
                  and forcing him out of the eighteen-inch projection, when the fourth Indian, who
                  had paused at the roof-hole, seeing both Jack and the Half-King fully engaged,
                  jumped down right on the scout's back, but he was the veriest fool to do so.</p>
               <p>Jack, while he lay heavily on the Indian beneath him, who, almost strangled to
                  death, could make no resistance, suddenly threw around both his hands and held the
                  fresh Indian's arms as if they were in a vice, crying out, "Marie! Marie! where
                  are you? Here! pass that thong around this assassin's arms, while I hold him!"</p>
               <p>Marie, who had just recovered sufficiently to go to the aid of her poor, stricken
                  father, awakened to the great danger threatening Jack, and hastened to pass the
                  thong of deerskin again and again and again about the Indian's arms, when Jack
                  gave him a heave and a toss, and he lay on the floor, helpless as a big baby, his
                  eyes rolling and his teeth gnashing with rage.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Jack continued his purpose with the other, fairly pushing him out and
                  down from under the projection tion, whence he fell with a heavy thud on the
                  ground beneath—a totally used-up Indian.</p>
               <p>Scarooyaddy had had a fierce and desperate struggle with his foe, and, with but
                  one arm, and having lost his tomahawk in the struggle, could only succeed in
                  pinning him, wounded, in one corner. He, too, was now securely tied and laid
                  alongside his companion.</p>
               <p>"Jennie," panted Jack out of breath, "hand me up my rifle! I'm not done yet, till
                  I see how the infernal scoundrels got in, and whether there are any more of this
                  hell-brood out there;" and so saying, trembling and exhausted from his superhuman
                  exertions and the closeness of the small and crowded room, he passed out on to the
                  roof just in time to see the last Indian making away from the trunk of the big
                  walnut, and the whole secret stood revealed. The wily savages had, one by one,
                  climbed the huge walnut, which we have stated grew at the chimney end of the
                  house, where there were no lookouts or loopholes. Crawling out on one of the
                  branches, they had quietly dropped one by one upon the roof, and, removing the
                  clapboards, had leaped into the room, making de Bonneville their first victim.</p>
               <p>The fresh cool air from the river somewhat revived Jack, and leaving the roof
                  purposely uncovered, he re-entered the room. Marie was sitting on the floor, the
                  very picture of stony despair, her father's venerable head resting in her lap.
                  Jack sent for water, and carefully lifting the body of the wounded naturalist, he
                  bore him tenderly, and laid him on the rude couch. First dashing water in his face
                  and fanning his cheeks, he then succeeded, with Marie's help, in baring the wound.
                  It was a small, but a mortal one—right through the lungs. There was a deathly
                  pallor on his delicate features; the cold dews were on his brow, and his eyes were
                  closed as if in his last sleep.</p>
               <p>Jack's bosom heaved piteously. He could not trust himself<pb n="198-199"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000104"/> self to speak. He simply pressed Marie's hand, as
                  if to assure her of his heartfelt sympathy, and that he would do all that could be
                  done.</p>
               <p>Marie stirred not—scarcely breathed; weep she could not, but sat gazing with
                  inexpressible longing down into her father's wan and gentle face, waiting till the
                  closed eyes either waked to recognition, or were quenched in eternal sleep.</p>
               <p>Jack now quietly assisted the Indian to convey the two prisoners to the lower
                  floor. They were shot down the ladder quite as fast, though not so hopefully, as
                  they came into the loft, and were then stretched side by side, amiable as two
                  turtle doves. The body of the vile fellow whom Jack had so violently untwisted
                  from Marie's tresses, was cast out on the roof, whence he rolled over and down,
                  dead as Julius Cæsar. Jennie Frazier and her mother were then sent above to
                  arrange the loft and stay with Marie, while Jack and the Half-King anxiously and
                  in low tones discussed the situation.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Chief! what <emph>can</emph> we do, with <emph>that</emph> above, and those
                  around? Think you they'll give it up now?"</p>
               <p>Scarooyaddy shook his head. "No; Shawnee madder than ever. Dare not go home with
                  so many hurt and gone. They know only us two here, and can send for plenty braves.
                  Scarooyaddy ready. Rather fight than burn at stake."</p>
               <p>"And so I, but would rather get out of this cursed trap than do either. Will old
                  Braddock never, never come? If he had American rangers to the fore, they'd ha'
                  been in the fort a month since."</p>
               <p>He had scarcely given utterance to the words, when the Half-King's quick ear was
                  turned quickly and attentively towards the river. One of the bound and helpless
                  prisoners had, also, heard an unusual sound in that direction, as his face was all
                  life and expectation.</p>
               <p>A noise as of talking and splashing of water was now distinctly heard, and the
                  Half-King leaped to a river-side loophole, with Jack close at his side. Oh,
                  welcome sight! A body of horse, led by an old Indian wading on foot, was clearly
                  visible not a hundred yards from shore.</p>
               <p>"Hurrah! hurrah! Yaddy. Braddock at last! at last!—the slothful old laggard!
                  There's his advance, but how ever in the world does he come that way? Hurrah!
                  hurrah!" and Jack seized hold of the Half-King's hand, and shook it like a
                  pump-handle. The Indian's face broke into one huge grin, and another of his
                  stomach laughs was emitted.</p>
               <p>"But, hold!" said Jack, "what am I thinking of? I must hasten to hail and warn
                  them of Indians;" and so saying he danced up the ladder and re-entered that sad
                  room.</p>
               <p>Marie was sitting just as he had left her, gazing down into her father's face; oh,
                  so earnestly, for one, ever so slight, symptom of returning consciousness. Jack
                  approached her.</p>
               <p>"Marie, we're saved! Braddock's advance is even now crossing the river—will be
                  here in a jiffy. I'm going now to hail them."</p>
               <p>Marie sadly shook her head. "It matters little now, Edward; 'tis too late for me,
                     and—<emph>him,</emph>" and then, for the first time, broke out into a violent
                  flood of tears.</p>
               <p>"Weep on, Marie, 'twill do you great good! I'll be back soon;" and seizing an old
                  quilt, he sprang out upon the roof, and waved it most vigorously. The old Indian
                  saw it at once, and turned to the leader of the band. Then the notes of a bugle
                  sounded out clear and strong and sweet, filling the hills with echoes.</p>
               <p>Jack motioned them to come near as possible, and pointed to the woods. As they
                  advanced, Jack recognized Captain Waggoner, of the Virginia Rifles, in the front,
                  and shouted, "Hold off, Waggoner! Have a care! we're standing a siege<pb
                     n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7175-00000105"/> from a gang of redskins. They're
                  skulking in the woods there."</p>
               <p>"And is that <emph>you,</emph> Captain Jack? Hurrah! hurrah! Cap, we're all
                  devilish glad to see you again. Braddock had almost given you up as lost—Gist and
                  Fairfax got back yesterday. Where's the Half-King and Talbot?"</p>
               <p>"The Indian's with <emph>me.</emph> The young Lord's I don't know where—killed or
                  captured I expect. If you've a mind to come on, the Half-King and I'll join
                  you—don't think the Shawnees will stand a fight. They're pretty sick of it."</p>
               <p>"All right, Captain, we're with you!" and again the bugle sounded, the horses
                  broke into a trot, a dash was made up the bank, and the whole party drew up at the
                  door of the cabin, just as a scattering volley was poured at them from the
                     woods.<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>

               <p>AS Captain Jack hurried down from the roof to receive the small troop of
                  "light-horse," he was momentarily arrested by Marie's joyful exclamation:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Edward, father has 'wakened again to life and sense. He just now languidly
                  opened his eyes and asked <emph>if they were gone,</emph> and how he came on the
                  couch, and if he didn't hear the sounds of some strange music. See! he looks at
                  you. Speak to him, Edward!"</p>
               <p>Jack gently approached the old naturalist's side and took his hand.</p>
               <p>"Well, Monsieur de Bonneville, we're saved at last. Braddock's 'body-guard' is
                  even now at the door. You've received a terrible shock, sir, but I trust all will
                  soon be well."</p>
               <p>The old gentleman feebly shook his head, and answered in almost inaudible tones:
                  "All will soon be well, indeed,<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7175-00000106"/> Edward,
                  but not in the sense <emph>you</emph> mean. I can't deceive myself. There's
                  internal bleeding. My summons has come; I've received a mortal hurt; I feel I'm
                  stricken to the death."</p>
               <p>"Oh, don't say so, sir!" answered Jack, hastily brushing away a tear. "You're
                  grievously hurt, to be sure; but I think—at least I hope—all will yet come right.
                  I'll be back in a few minutes."</p>
               <p>And the ranger hastened to unbar the door, around which the gallant little
                  Virginia "troop" had grouped themselves.</p>
               <p>"Captain Waggoner, you're just in the very nick of time, and right glad we are to
                  see you. We had almost given up all hope. There's been sad and bloody work here."
                  And Jack rapidly recounted all that had occurred, and the trying scenes they had
                  just gone through. "And how came <emph>you,</emph> Waggoner, a captain of Virginia
                  Rangers, to be at the head of 'Stewart's light-horse?'"</p>
               <p>"Oh, by special favor, Jack," answered Waggoner—as dashing and gallant a ranger as
                  ever hailed from the "Old Dominion." "You know I was all over this country last
                  year, in Major Washington's campaign, and as I was anxious to come and Braddock to
                     <emph>have</emph> me come, Stewart made no difficulty, but gave me half his
                  'troop'—I've only fifteen in all. I'm glad you call us '<emph>light</emph>-horss,'
                  Jack; anything else would be a misnomer. Look at them! Did you ever, in all your
                  born days, see such a wretched, shackeldy, broken-down looking set of old
                  skeletons? Why, a flock of eagles and carrion crows follow us like shadows! How do
                  you think any one of these transparent anatomies would answer Job's description of
                  the war-horse, 'whose neck is clothed with thunder, who paweth in the valleys, who
                  smelleth the battle afar off, and who crieth ha! ha! among the trumpeters?' Bah!
                  you could knock down a whole file of them with your fist. They look like standing
                  advertisements of 'oats and corn wanted—inquire within.'"</p>
               <p>"They make a big clatter, at all events," laughed Jack, "and that's enough for
                  Indians. They're as much afraid of your 'troop,' ghostly as the animals look, as
                  if they were elephants. Certes, Braddock has been villanously cheated in his
                  horse-flesh! He has all the spavined, wind-galled, string-halt and broken-winded
                  horses in the whole country. Put yours, Waggoner, alongside of the draught
                  horses—those miserable bundles of bones, and be content, old fellow." (See <hi
                     rend="i"/>Appendix O.)</p>
               <p>"Well," laughed Waggoner, "these'll maybe last to the fort; but if we don't soon
                  give 'em rest, and something besides leaves and wood-grass, they'll have to lean
                  against a tree to eat. Wo! <emph>wo!</emph> Bucephalus; stand away, Jack, from my
                  horse's head, with his flaming eye and smoking nostrils, or he'll ride right over
                  you! If he once takes you for a sack of oats, you're a goner, sure. Dismount, men,
                  and turn 'em loose for a while, and drag away those two painted carcasses from the
                  door!"</p>
               <p>"Hadn't we better," put in Jack, "scour the woods before Braddock comes up?"</p>
               <p>"Braddock comes up? Why, Cap, what dy'e mean? You don't think this 'troop' the
                  'advance,' do you? Why, bless you, we're an exploring party. The army's a good two
                  days' march from here. It has taken a circumbendibus'—is away out of its direct
                  course, and the eastern branch of Turtle Creek which the army reaches to-night, is
                  said by the engineers to be so steep and rugged and utterly impracticable for
                  waggons and artillery, that there's no getting over Turtle Creek Valley that way,
                  but by means of a long and expensive bridge, which will cause a longer delay than
                  Braddock can afford to stand just now."</p>
               <p>"Well, what in heaven's name," pettishly exclaimed<pb n="204-205"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000107"/> Jack, "is the old bungler going to do now? He'd
                  better 'box the whole compass,' work round and attack the fort from the West."</p>
               <p>"Sh-h-h, Jack—a good many ears about; for one of us ignorant provincials to say
                  anything against Braddock is 'flat treason.' Some of his Indian guides have told
                  him there's a much easier route to the fort the way we've just come—one, too, by
                  which he can avoid a dangerous 'narrows' of three miles on the Monongahela. The
                  General has sent us forward to test the matter, and sure enough we've crossed both
                  fords this evening, and the whole route is comparatively so favorable that there
                  isn't much doubt that Braddock will adopt it, and 'right about face' immediately.
                  We must go back to-night to report."</p>
               <p>"Good!" cried Jack; "we'll go with you. But stay!—de Bonneville; he's dying, I
                  fear, and can't be moved. What's to be done? Are you <emph>sure</emph> Braddock
                  will be this way by the 8th?"</p>
               <p>"That or the next, if our report pleases. But we'll talk of this again. Call the
                  Half-King, and let's scour those woods on foot!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, the Chief don't need calling, when there's any of <emph>that</emph> business
                  about. There he stands, ears cocked, eyes live as coals, fingers twitching, ready
                  for the signal! As we're old woodsmen, he'll lead the way on this side, while I'll
                  do the same on the other. Come, Chief!"</p>
               <p>Both parties now entered the woods at either end of the cabin, and worked
                  cautiously around to the front, where they met. All quiet. Every redskin gone. No
                  sign of an enemy except a rude, insulting inscription or two, cut on the fresh
                  peeled trees, which made the Half-King's eyes flash. They had plainly hurried back
                  to the fort for reinforcements, and to relate what they had seen—a body of horse
                  coming from an entirely unexpected direction.</p>
               <p>The whole party now prepared for a rest, and made themselves as comfortable as
                  possible. The horses were stripped of saddle and bridle, and turned out to grass.
                  Jennie and her mother, greatly overjoyed at the favorable turn matters had taken,
                  gathered provisions and commenced preparations for supper. The troopers pulled out
                  their pipes, and stretching themselves along the grassy river bluff, chatted in
                  quiet tones, or cast hungry and expectant eyes towards the cabin. All knew by this
                  time every thing that had occurred, and while old M. de Bonneville was gently
                  breathing away his life, these unlettered but intelligent Virginians kept decorous
                  and respectful silence.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Jack, finding that Captain Waggoner was obliged to make a speedy
                  departure, and was unable to leave any of his small force behind, had arranged
                  with him to have Marie's father carried between two of the horses on a rude
                  litter, hoping that the army doctors could yet do something for him.</p>
               <p>Alas, vain hope! While busy with his preparations, Jack was hastily summoned to
                  the loft by a message from Marie. A wondrous change had already come over M. de
                  Bonneville. His eyes had an unnatural brilliancy. His breathing had become more
                  difficult; his delicate features were pinched, and his whole appearance gave
                  evidence that the seal of death was on his brow. There was no mistaking those
                  peculiar, infallible signs by which all know and feel that a loved one has been
                  called and is passing away; that an immortal and Heaven-born soul is being
                  gradually withdrawn from its earthly tabernacle—about to enter the awful mysteries
                  of another and a better world.</p>
               <p>The old naturalist extended his thin wan hand, and welcomed Jack back with a smile
                  full of affection. Death evidently had no terrors for him. Why should it?</p>
               <p>"Edward, I know and I feel it. It could not be otherwise<pb n="206-207"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000108"/> wise. I have but a very brief time yet to live. Be
                  patient with me, for I have something to ask you which <emph>must</emph> be
                  granted. Promise me!"</p>
               <p>Jack turned away, sobbing, from that gentle, patient, yearning, <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">spirituelle</foreign> face, with its delicate tracery of fine,
                  blue veins, and crowned with its long, silken, white hair. His eyes met those of
                  Marie, who sat at the foot of the couch, her countenance pale with weeping, her
                  whole frame convulsed, her heart breaking—the very picture of hopeless sorrow. His
                  tongue refused to syllable a word. He could only press tenderly the old
                  naturalist's hand.</p>
               <p>"Thanks, dear boy! I knew you would not, could not refuse my last simple request.
                  Look around! This room is hot, dark, gloomy, contracted. The air is close and
                  stifling. I can't see, can't hear, can't smell, can scarcely breathe. 'Tis no fit
                  place for one who has lived as I have lived, and who has loved nature as I have
                  loved—her fresh breezes; her blessed sunshine; her leaves and flowers; her running
                  waters, and all her soothing, wooing influences—this is no place for me to—to—why
                  should I hesitate to say the word?—to die in."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Father, dear Father," pleaded Marie, her eyes streaming with tears, and an
                  imploring look in her sad face, "do not! do not break your daughter's heart! You
                  cannot, <emph>must</emph> not die! 'twould kill <emph>me,</emph> too! You must
                  live! Braddock's own physician will see you and dress your wound, while I myself
                  will nurse you back to health and strength. Wont you <emph>try</emph> to live,
                  dear Father?"</p>
               <p>The dying old man gazed wistfully at Marie, with a look of unutterable sadness and
                  tenderness. The tears welled up to his eyes, and there was a choking in his
                  throat. He could not speak one word. At last:</p>
               <p>"Marie, dearest child, you have been to me more than daughter ever was to
                  parent—as much as ever wife to husband. Your whole life has been one long act of
                  self-sacrifice and of devotion to one who only now—in the solemn, serene light of
                  another world—begins to see and to realize how exacting he was, and how utterly
                  unselfish <emph>you</emph> were—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Father, do not—"</p>
               <p>"Say no more, Marie, I entreat! You unman me! you change the current of my last
                  thoughts. God knows, if this change is hard for you, 'tis much harder for
                     <emph>me.</emph> I have been trying—oh, no one knows how earnestly—to rise
                  above all mere earthly thoughts, all human affections; but, <emph>dear</emph>
                  child, you are tugging at my heart-strings. Have pity! My strength is ebbing with
                  my time."</p>
               <p>Marie, by one strong, mighty effort, stilled her emotions, and bent over her
                  father's hand. A. brief and solemn pause:</p>
               <p>"My dying request, Edward, is, that you carry me from this stifling, pent-up room,
                  out into the fresh air and under the open sky. Spread my bed on the bank of the
                  Monongahela. I wish to see the sun make, for me, its last golden set; to look once
                  again on the virgin woods, under whose green, leafy, canopy I've spent so many
                  quiet, happy years. I yearn to breathe God's pure air, and gather in—only this
                  once—the freshness of evening. Hasten, then, Edward, ere it may be too late!"</p>
               <p>Jack exchanged a few words with Marie, gave brief directions to Jennie, and when
                  all was ready, he tenderly took up in his strong arms the form of the fragile old
                  man, and gently conveyed it below; passed out amid the silent, wondering troopers,
                  and placed him in a half-reclining position on a couch on the banks of the river
                  and at the foot of the big walnut.</p>

               <p>THE sun was just descending behind the western hills; and as the old naturalist
                  looked upon it, with all its golden, dying glories and its varied tints and hues,
                  and then out upon the river, and then across and around at the thick, leafy
                  wilderness, an expression of intense, restful satisfaction came over his face. His
                  smile was almost seraphic. The freshening airs; the odors, from the water and the
                  woods; the glowing colors of the clouds, all seemed to revive him, and he
                  murmured:</p>
               <p>"Ah, this is better, far better! So I have lived, and so I would die; and yet 'tis
                  hard to lose one's hold of earth; never again to see the varied beauties—again to
                  feel the multiplied delights which attend and minister unto nature's devout
                  worshipper. Who knows but still fairer scenes, and still more varied pleasures
                  await me in the world to which I'm hastening!"</p>
               <p>The old Frenchman now lay a long time in silence, his failing sight taking in
                  lovingly, and one by one, each feature ture of the beautiful panorama of cloud,
                  woods and water. The shades of evening soon commenced to gather. After a little,
                  de Bonneville asked Jack to raise him higher, and Marie to bring him his
                  flute.</p>
               <p>The poor, wo-begone girl hesitated, but upon a glance from Jack, she hastened,
                  amid blinding tears, to comply.</p>
               <p>It was a sad and inexpressibly touching sight to see the dying naturalist, his
                  snowy beard waving over his breast, his eyes, for the last time, lighted up with
                  their old enthusiasm, and his white and delicate fingers wandering and trembling
                  among the stops of the instrument.</p>
               <p>He commenced with low, sweet, fluttering notes, which rose higher and higher,
                  fuller and fuller, richer and richer, until it seemed as if the parting soul were
                  being breathed into arid floated off on the wild melodies. It was most touching.
                  The troopers, with Captain Waggoner at their head, stood grouped at a little
                  distance, hats in hand, and in respectful attitudes of listening attention. The
                  notes now became again softer and wilder, more plaintive and subduing, until
                  finally an expression of anguish passed over the changing face; the flute was laid
                  aside, and all but Jack—even Marie—requested to retire.</p>
               <p>"Edward," almost whispered the old man, "I feel I'm sinking fast. I have kept this
                  to the last, but can no longer delay. Marie—oh! Edward, it wrings my very soul to
                  leave her thus, and alone! What <emph>is</emph> to become of her? She had only me
                  in the world. Will you, my dear boy, see her safe to the army? and after the fort
                  is captured, accompany her to Philadelphia? 'Tis my dying request."</p>
               <p>"Trust me, M. de Bonneville; I'll do all you can wish, and <emph>more</emph> than
                  you can ask!"</p>
               <p>"Thanks, Edward! I knew your kind nature. I had many, many friends in that city.
                  They would have aided me to publish my paintings and writings. They may do it for
                  Maire. 'Twill be occupation and support for her. Oh,<pb n="210-211"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000110"/> how keenly I regret that the absorbing work of my
                  life is thus abruptly cut off; that all my dreams, my heart hopes and fondest
                  aspirations, have thus been crushed—utterly crushed—ut-ter-ly crushed. But God's
                  will be done!" and the dying old naturalist closed his eyes as if in silent
                  prayer.</p>
               <p>"And, Edward," after a pause, he muttered, in still feebler tones, "draw yet
                  closer. You'll sometimes, as you visit the city, go to Marie, console her, direct
                  her, strengthen her, and give her the benefit of your counsel. You used to love
                  her society. At one time I thought you had even a stronger and deeper feeling than
                  mere friendship, but your sudden departure from the city undeceived me. Yet
                  still—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, my dear M. de Bonneville, I had! I had! I loved Marie as fervently as ever
                  man loved woman, and I now believe she returned it; but I acted like a fool, and
                  rashly, madly cast the rich blessing away; but I've been punished in a bitter,
                  desolate, revengeful life—yes, sorely punished! I love her yet, as much—yes, more
                  than ever! I—"</p>
               <p>"Edward, I did not know—could not have guessed this," whispered the fond father,
                  "or I would not have spoken so freely. Forgive me; I believe my senses wandered.
                  Does Marie know this? Think you she returns your affection? Have you told her?"
                  with a brightening and more eager look.</p>
               <p>"I have not, and can not, yet. May be some time in the future, after this bloody
                  war is over, I'll—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I feel that she will, she must love you! She never has loved another! There,
                  leave me now! God bless you! I commit Marie, for the present, to your honorable
                  protection. I feel happier and easier already; but I'm getting ve-ry, ve-ry—weak.
                  My eyes grow dim. Oh, Saviour, can—this—be—death? Send Marie to me; quick!
                  quick!"</p>
               <p>Marie was soon locked in her dying father's embrace. It is not for us to intrude
                  on that last sad, sacred interview between father and only child. The tears of
                  both were freely blended. They talked of the past, of the dead mother and wife; of
                  the future and its prospects. Marie was told of Jack's promise to see her safe to
                  Philadelphia, but not one word of his declaration—naught but the simple expression
                  of the father's confidence in Jack as one whom he had long known and esteemed as a
                  friend, and as one whom he had secretly hoped to call some day by a nearer and
                  dearer title.</p>
               <p>The old man, after this most harrowing interview, sank back completely exhausted.
                  His wound was bleeding inwardly, and his strength and life were rapidly ebbing
                  away. His eyes now began to wander. His lips moved, but the utterance was rambling
                  and incoherent. Occasionally he would point up to the river, and then look up to
                  the sky. He babbled of birds and their plumage: of the cool, dewy woods and their
                  indwellers; of wild flowers and wood shrubs and their fragrances, until it seemed
                  as if his whole soul was steeped with beauty, and his memory filled with nothing
                  but scenes and adventures among hills and dales, woods and waters.</p>
               <p>At last, by an unusual effort, he raised himself up once more, turned his fading
                  vision to the tinted, radiant clouds, and whispered, "Oh, Edward! oh, Marie! my
                  dear children, I seem to see in the glowing track of that western sun, long vistas
                  of the most beautiful and luxuriant trees, with their clambering vines and
                  exquisite shrubs and flowers. They are all filled with birds of strange forms and
                  brilliant plumage. The most delightful music fills the air. The breezes are spiced
                  with odors; the—and—and—I go to enjoy them—oh, so gladly! I thank the dear God,
                  who knows all my tastes and loves, and—that—He has still work for me. Marie!
                  Edward! where are you? I no<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7175-00000111"/> longer see
                  you; a hand of each! Farewell forever! Come, blessed—"</p>
               <p>The old, white-haired enthusiast sank back as it in a swoon, and breathed his life
                  away so gently, so softly, that the crowd of weepers near and distant could scarce
                  believe it was anything else but sleep—so, indeed, it was; long and sweet and
                  dreamless.</p>
               <p>A hurried consultation soon followed between Jack and Waggoner as to what were
                  best to be done. The troop must go back to Braddock as soon as possible. The
                  others could not be left behind. This necessitated either the transporting of the
                  body, or—harsh and hard as it seemed—its almost immediate burial. Waggoner took it
                  on himself to arrange pillions on which to seat Jennie and her mother, each behind
                  one of the troopers, and, by dismounting one of his men, to prepare a horse for
                  Marie. A rude coffin was knocked together in the woods to receive the mortal
                  remains of M. de Bonneville.</p>
               <p>Jack, after a long struggle, resolved to break the arrangement to Marie—a most
                  unwelcome task, but better from him than another. Sending Jennie and her mother
                  forward to prepare the body, dressed just as it was, for burial, he took the
                  crushed and weeping Marie gently by the hand, and led her into the cabin.</p>
               <p>"Marie, you are a sensible, self-reliant woman; you see the strait we're in. We
                  must all be off from this in a couple of hours, or else be slain and scalped. It
                  seems hard and cruel for me to tell you—and I would rather, this minute, be bound
                  and going to the fort as Blackhoof's prisoner than do it—but your dear father must
                  be buried now, and here."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Edward! Edward!" pleaded the poor, stricken girl, making the most heroic
                  effort to restrain her tears, and to force down the choking in her throat; "must
                  this, indeed, be? Oh, 'tis a hard, hard, cruel lot, and yet—oh! could we not
                  carry?—but no. I see it all. I must submit. I know you'd spare me this if you
                  could," and Marie leaned her head upon the table and sobbed as if her very heart
                  would break.</p>
               <p>Jack could be of no use there. Better for nature to take its course; so he hunted
                  up Waggoner, who had just given command to get all ready, and led him to the cabin
                  door, saying in low tones:</p>
               <p>"Captain, what's to be done with the Shawnees that I've had carried out here?
                  There they lie, rolling their wicked little eyes, venomous as two
                  copperheads."</p>
               <p>"Well, Jack, that passes me; I've been thinking of it. Our two Indians, if we'd
                  allow it, would make short work of them, and have the Shawnee scalps hanging at
                  their girdles quick as a wink. 'Twould be fifty good pounds in their pockets, too;
                  but that's not to be thought of. We're white, and can't murder in cold blood."</p>
               <p>"Of course not," said Jack. "I've reason enough to hate redskins, as you
                  know—these devils in particular—and if the fellows were behind their trees, with
                  rifle in hand, I'd like nothing better than a drive at them; but we've had enough
                  of blood here. We can't send them adrift, with what they know, to the fort; that's
                  sure. We can't leave them in the cabin; that's even more sure. I see nothing for
                  it but drive them along before us, and if they give trouble, let them look
                  out!"</p>
               <p>"Well, so be it! The Half-King had better see their hands are firmly bound, and
                  loose their feet and tell them what we've resolved on."</p>
               <p>Scarooyaddy, who had been sitting on the river bluff, his head bowed down, for
                  hours back, didn't much like this arrangement, but had to submit; and he and
                  Waggoner's guide hastened to have the Shawnees ready, and promised to watch over
                  them</p>

               <p>A GRAVE had, meanwhile, been dug by some of the troopers on the bluff, just at the
                  edge of the woods. The body of poor de Bonneville had been carefully laid in the
                  rude coffin, and all was ready for the burial. The evening was fast changing into
                  night; the horses stood saddled; the troopers were standing about, and everything
                  was ready for the march, but still there came a pause—a pause which all seemed to
                  understand, and which each dreaded to have broken—Jack more than all.</p>
               <p>It was the desolate, sorrow-stricken, grief-laden mourner in the cabin who was in
                  the thoughts of all—even the two friendly Indians seemed to feel for her, while
                  the two prisoners stood aloof, their heads down and a shamed look in their savage
                  faces. Any show of triumph at that moment would have brought down the tomahawks on
                  their heads. At last, Jack softly to Waggoner:</p>
               <p>"Captain, I swear to you I'd sooner march to the Indian torture than do it, but it
                  must be!" Then, going into the cabin, where Marie sat leaning on the rude, massive
                  table, her position unchanged, and her eyes swoollen with much weeping, he said,
                  tenderly:</p>
               <p>"Marie, all is now ready. Wont you strive hard to control yourself? I'm not much
                  used to such trying scenes, or to giving consolation; but if you'd like it, Marie,
                  I would—attempt to read the service for you."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Edward, Edward!" feelingly exclaimed the desolate mourner, "if you only
                  would! 'Twould be such a comfort—such a comfort."</p>
               <p>"Jennie, go before with the light," solemnly spoke Jack. "Marie, give me your
                  prayer book, with the place open, and now lean upon my arm. I'll do it."</p>
               <p>The two passed out and on towards the sombre woods, where were the grave and the
                  coffin. They were followed by Jennie and her mother, then by Waggoner and his
                  troopers. All stood around the open grave. At sight of it, Marie's hard schooling
                  was almost in vain. Jack felt her arm tremble in his like an aspen. Her frame
                  seemed convulsed, and it needed of her a strong effort to keep from falling; but
                  the effort was made, and tearless she bent over the grave, into which all that was
                  mortal of her father was carefully lowered by two of the troopers.</p>
               <p>Jack then, by the dim light of the candle, slowly and solemnly—but at times with
                  broken and trembling accents—read out the beautiful and impressive service for the
                  dead. It was a most peculiar and touching scene. It can easier be imagined than
                  described.</p>
               <p>At last all was over. Marie had gone through it nobly, heroically, until she heard
                  the first, hard clod falling rudely upon the coffin lid. She then uttered a low
                  wail, more like<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7175-00000113"/> a moan of pain, which
                  was followed by sobs that seemed to convulse her whole person. Even the rude
                  troopers were moved to tears. Jack hurried her away as soon as possible, and
                  mounted her directly on her horse. He rightly thought that motion, change of
                  scene, and the requirements of a night journey, would be the best
                     <emph>present</emph> medicine for her wounded and sore-stricken heart; time
                  alone could bring healing.</p>
               <p>The cabin—of late the scene of so much stirring action—having been securely
                  closed, and all of Marie's effects having been carefully lodged in the loft till a
                  more propitious season, the whole cavalcade took up its melancholy march, the four
                  Indians in front; then half the "troop;" then Jennie and her mother, followed by
                  Marie, with Jack walking at the horse's head and holding the bridle, and the other
                  troopers bringing up the rear.</p>
               <p>No use to ford and reford the river. The direct course lay on the cabin side, past
                  the mouth of Turtle Creek (the Tulpewi Sipu of the Delawares); thence along the
                  "narrows" for a couple of miles or so, to the mouth of what is now called "Crooked
                  Run." Thus far no obstruction, except what the gloom of the forest and the natural
                  difficulties of a night march along an unbroken path, might offer. It may be
                  imagined that the progress was slow, and the journey a doleful and dismal one.</p>
               <p>Up the dark, narrow valley of Crooked Run they turned, and soon fell in with an
                  old Indian trail, which led pretty directly towards "Brush Creek," where lay
                  Braddock's advance army of twelve hundred picked men. The Indian prisoners gave no
                  trouble whatever. They trudged along in front, in dogged, sullen silence, making
                  no attempt at escape. About midnight, the party stopped under a particularly dense
                  and dark wood until the guides could recover the lost trail. After the many
                  excitements of the day, all were weary; some of the troopers even nodded in the
                  saddle, while others dismounted and stretched themselves under the trees.</p>
               <p>After a quarter of an hour's search, the guides returning, the word for advance
                  was given, when, all at once, the two prisoners and the Half-King's pet rifle were
                  missed. The thongs which tied their hands were found by the latter, who, with the
                  guide, immediately plunged into the forest. It was full an hour before they
                  quietly rejoined the party and resumed the march. At Scarooyaddy's belt, Jack's
                  quick eye observed a fresh scalp attached. The other Indian—he who had stolen the
                  rifle—escaped in the darkness.</p>
               <p>"Why, how now, Chief!" said Jack, in low tones; "you wont go back to Braddock
                  without the elegant rifle he presented you with?"</p>
               <p>"'The Black Rifle' not good to his brother," angrily answered Scarooyaddy. "Why
                  you no let me kill him at the cabin? He very bad Indian—very much rascal. He try
                  hard to kill both us; then when you have him, you no kill <emph>him?</emph> Me
                  never understand the 'pale face.'"</p>
               <p>"But I see," said Jack, glancing at his companion's belt, "that you sent
                     <emph>one</emph> of the scoundrels to the happy hunting grounds."</p>
               <p>"Ugh," answered the Chief, in great disgust, "he wrong one. My gun gone. Byme by,
                  may be, I be killed with my own bullet. I soon come 'cross this fellow," pointing
                  to the scalp, "squatting behind a bush like a rabbit. He make big jumps and try
                  for my tomahawk, but I no let him have it—not <emph>that</emph>-a-way—no. Shawnee
                  all over rascal—much fight."</p>
               <p>"Oh, well, Chief, the 'scalp bounty' will buy you another gun."</p>
               <p>"Me no want any more but that. It make little bit noise, but it kill very
                  big—almost as good as the 'The Black Rifle.'"</p>
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7175-00000114"/>
               <p>The route now lay along the uplands. The party had scarce defiled from the close
                  valley of the run out into the open, and were crossing a little moonlit hillside,
                  when the sharp crack of a rifle was heard from the edge of the woods behind them,
                  and instantly after, the pinge of a bullet, which whistled past Jack's breast and
                  buried itself in the loose fleshy part of the neck of Marie's horse. The beast
                  shied and reared but was soon quieted down.</p>
               <p>The report had scarcely died away, when the two Indians, taking diverging courses,
                  bounded back into the woods.</p>
               <p>"Marie," said Jack, as soon as the party had gained the first shelter, "I wager
                  that bullet was meant for me. 'Twas from Scarooyaddy's own rifle. I can tell its
                  vicious bark among a thousand. I must have choked that big redskin more than he
                  can forget or forgive. Did you see how the Half-King sprang for that noise? 'Twas
                  to him like the call of his squaw."</p>
               <p>"Edward," anxiously exclaimed Marie, trembling and nervous from the many shocks
                  she had lately gone through, "this is a dreadful, dreadful life! It cannot be that
                  it is to your liking, with all its alarms and surprises and encounters."</p>
               <p>"I don't know about that, Marie. This back-woods life certainly has its charms and
                  its pleasing excitements. You know that, even as a boy, I almost lived in the
                  woods and under the free air of heaven. The feeling grows with years. 'Pears to me
                  I can't breathe a deep, full breath in the city. The airs and steamy odors of the
                  sun-baked street stifle and oppress me. The wigs and ruffles and pumps and
                  starchings and airs of the quality vex and anger me. I pine for the wild woods and
                  their sequestered retreats. Nature is ever fresh and ever true—she never deceives
                  or betrays you. She's sometimes rough, but she's always honest and kindly. No, no,
                  Marie; the thronged city may do for lawyers, doctors, preachers, and
                  pelf-gatherers, but not for me."</p>
               <p>"But, Edward, you surely can't love this life of blood, and violence, and
                  incessant peril. <emph>I</emph> have lived much in the woods too—more than most of
                  my sex, and love them dearly. You know it; but I love better, peace and quiet, and
                  a heart free from bitterness to any."</p>
               <p>"Well, Marie, <emph>I</emph> was of that mind once, and still have dreams of a
                  peaceful time when all bloody strife and fierce excitement shall be over, but you
                  know I've had grievous trials; have been stripped of all I held dear in the world,
                  and turned out into the wilderness with nothing but injuries to avenge and
                  memories to forget. There may yet come a time—God speedily grant it—when the gall
                  and hatred and bitterness which have made me what I am, shall give way to softer
                  feelings and more quiet and peaceful scenes. I feel, Marie, as if a great change
                  had already come over me, and it's still going on; may be—"</p>
               <p>But just here the sudden appearance of the Half-King put a stop to further
                  conversation. Holding up his beloved rifle, he said:</p>
               <p>"Shawnee very much crazy. He no go when he <emph>can</emph> go; now he die when he
                  no want to die. I told you, my brother, that Scarooyaddy's own lead might kill
                  him."</p>
               <p>"But you <emph>ain't</emph> killed," said Jack. "'Twas <emph>me</emph> the rascal
                  wanted. He couldn't forget the loving hug I gave him in the loft. Where did you
                  turn him up, Chief, and"—in lower tones—"where's his hair?"</p>
               <p>"Me no touch him. The Tuscarora chase him over big tree trunk, knock him cold with
                  hatchet, and pull his scalp before me come. All the same, though. Here
                  Scarooyaddy's gun. You see, now, Captain, that Great Spirit want <emph>both</emph>
                  Shawnee. He no want you and me; not just now."</p>

               <p>Poor fellow. He only reasoned according to his color and habits. He little thought
                  that that very evening a tragedy had been enacted on Braddock's march which would
                  touch him to the very core. But we must not anticipate.</p>

               <p>THE march was now resumed, and continued without further incident until after
                  midnight, when all at once, as the party surmounted a rising ground, the Tuscarora
                  guide came to a sudden halt, and pointed to a piece of woods just below him, where
                  smouldering fires and sundry columns of smoke rising lazily among the trees
                  denoted a large encampment.</p>
               <p>"'Tis Braddock's army at last," exclaimed Jack. "Waggoner, as you know the
                  countersign, you'd better take the lead. Those scary pickets have an ugly way of
                  firing offhand. Everything's an Indian to them. I was out the other evening to
                  hunt some hickory for a new ramrod, and on passing the outer line of sentries, was
                  challenged by a 'Wha gaes tha' from a stupid, lowlander Scot, and, notwithstanding
                  I gave the word, he fired his piece, yelled 'Injun', and made a vicious lunge at
                  me with his bayonet."</p>
               <p>The party, Waggoner many steps in the front, now cautiously advanced over a glassy
                  glade, and entered an open woods of white oak, having very little undergrowth.</p>
               <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7175-00000116"/>
               <p>Suddenly, and apparently from right under Waggoner's feet, came out of the silence
                  the click of a gun lock and the ringing voice:</p>
               <p>"Who goes there?"</p>
               <p>"A friend, with the countersign."</p>
               <p>"Advance, friend, and give the countersign."</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Conestoga;' and where have we struck the camp, Sergeant
                  Dobson?"</p>
               <p>"At the very head, Captain. There's the 'light horse' vidette in that clump of
                  laurel. We were just about to relieve the pickets."</p>
               <p>The party now passed the line of sentinels who were posted outside the fires, and
                  got into the cleared paths which connected the various sergeants, pickets and
                  flanking parties.</p>
               <p>Whatever could be said of Braddock's carelessness and neglect in other respects,
                  certainly every precaution which prudence or experience could suggest, was taken
                  to prevent a night surprise or attack. Turn where one might, a sentinel, of which
                  a close chain went around the whole encampment, confronted him. In the rear of
                  these were pickets and flanking parties of ten and twenty men each. At the very
                  head and rear were posted light-horse videttes. The long line of artillery,
                  baggage-wagons, tents, etc., was drawn up, as compactly as possible, in the
                  twelve-foot-wide road cut by the engineers and carpenter corps right through the
                  forest.</p>
               <p>The whole party, headed by the sergeant with a torch, now turned into and down
                  this rude road, in the camp's centre. The sergeants, the subaltern's parties, and
                  the detachment of sailors from Admiral Keppel's fleet, and then the tents of the
                  Grenadiers, were passed one after the other. Then came the long line of artillery,
                  with the tumbrils, caissons, ammunition wagons, and a single line of tents, facing
                  outward on either side.</p>
               <p>Near the very centre of the whole camp, the silent and ghostly procession came to
                  a halt before a little semicircular clearing, where were posted, first the
                  General's guard; back of it Braddock's tent, and behind both again, a detachment
                  of light-horse, acting as "body-guard." In the road beyond continued the line of
                  wagons, rear-guard, etc.</p>
               <p>After some little punctilio and ceremony, Waggoner's men were dismissed to their
                  own place for the night, while the others drew up near the guard, waiting to know
                  the pleasure of Braddock.</p>
               <p>The old General, anxious for Waggoner's report concerning the fords, had only
                  thrown himself in undress upon his camp-couch, and when he heard that the
                  Virginian's troop was accompanied by Jack, Scarooyaddy and three females, one of
                  them a lady of beauty and refinement, he was greatly interested and hastened out
                  in person. As he passed Dobson, he said in low tones:</p>
               <p>"Has any body yet told Scarooyaddy the sad news, Sergeant?"</p>
               <p>"No, General; I thought that had better come from headquarters."</p>
               <p>"You <emph>did,</emph> did you! S'death! Haven't we enough confounded worry and
                  trouble of our own without <emph>this</emph> added? Well, sir, go take him with
                  you and tell him at <emph>once</emph>—or stay! <emph>I'd</emph> better arrange
                  it," adding to himself in low tones, "'twas a d—d awkward blunder. If it had been
                  made by the stupid militia of the country, 'twouldn't have been so bad; but, by my
                  own veterans—gad, its horrible!"</p>
               <p>Braddock then courteously saluted Marie and the other females; accosted Waggoner
                  and Jack; heard from them a very hurried explanation of matters, and sent an
                  orderly to have some of his officers give up their tent to the three women for the
                  night, meanwhile telling all to dismount right there. He then went up to
                  scarooyaddy, shook him<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7175-00000117"/> very warmly by
                  the hand, and taking him aside, said feelingly:</p>
               <p>"The Half-King has done well—very well. He's a great war chief, and his words are
                  always as wise as his deeds are brave. He deserves our full confidence. It grieves
                  my heart to have very, very bad news for him. May the Great Spirit help him to
                  bear it."</p>
               <p>The Chief darted a sudden, questioning look at the General, then raised himself to
                  his full stature and with great dignity made answer:</p>
               <p>"Scarooyaddy is a man—an old chief of over fifty snows and thirty battles. He
                  waits the great General's message. Good news can keep, but bad news must go
                  straight," looking inquiringly and searchingly at Braddock.</p>
               <p>"You say true, Chief, and I know well your courage; but 'tis cruel hard to tell
                  you that your brave son has been accidentally shot this evening."</p>
               <p>At the word a shudder went over the old Indian's frame. His face fell, his mouth
                  worked convulsively, but making a strong effort, the aged stoic simply and
                  inquiringly said:</p>
               <p>"Shot, and what then?"</p>
               <p>"He was shot by our own men," nervously and rapidly continued Braddock: "was
                  mistaken, for a French-Indian. He was sorely wounded, was—was—"</p>
               <p>"He's dead," said the Chief, looking the General fairly and squarely in the
                  eye.</p>
               <p>"Alas, that I must say it, he is!" answered Braddock, dropping his eyes to the
                  ground before that calm, clear gaze. "The whole camp is in grief. I weep for him.
                  I've done all possible honor to so brave a warrior and <emph>your</emph> son."</p>
               <p>"I would see him," moaned the old Chief.</p>
               <p>"I'll send my own aid with you at once. He'll explain all. I need not say again,
                  Chief, how very grieved I am—we <emph>all</emph> are."</p>
               <p>The Half-King bowed his head and stepped back into the deep shadow of a tree,
                  leaning against its trunk, and waiting patiently until Captain Orme, Braddock's
                  aid, quietly conducted him away.</p>
               <p>This painful task over, the General returned to his tent, where he received his
                  company affably and courteously, being particularly gracious and gentle to Marie,
                  whose sad story had been told him by Jack.</p>
               <p>Generalissimo of all his Majesty's troops in North America, and favorite of the
                  great Duke of Cumberland, Major General Braddock was now full sixty years of age,
                  over forty of which were passed in active military service with the famous "Cold
                  Stream Guards." It is difficult within the compass of a few brief paragraphs to
                  sketch his life and character. It is generally allowed, even by his bitterest
                  enemies, that he was personally brave, honest, loyal, and well versed in military
                  matters, but a rigid martinet, and too apt to rely on exact drill and discipline
                  exclusively for success. "Desperate in his fortunes, brutal in his behavior,
                  obstinate in his sentiments," writes Walpole, "he was still intrepid and capable."
                  Mr. Shirley, his own military secretary, in a confidential letter written while
                  far on this march to Governor Morris of Pennsylvania, says, "We have a General
                  most judiciously chosen for being disqualified for the service he is in, in almost
                  every respect. He may be brave for aught I know and he is honest in pecuniary
                  matters."</p>
               <p>In private life, it must be confessed, Braddock was, or rather had been, dissolute
                  and reckless, keeping the low and disreputable company of London actors; given to
                  the debaucheries of his day and class—the bottle and the gaming table.</p>
               <p>Franklin, that keen observer of human nature, pronounced him a brave man and a
                  good officer, but arrogant, having too much self-confidence, too high an opinion
                     of<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7175-00000118"/> regular troops, and too mean a
                  one of both Indians and Americans. The old philosopher, when hearing Braddock's
                  account of what was to be done <emph>after</emph> Duquesne was taken, told him
                  that the only fear <emph>he</emph> had, was from Indian ambuscades and from the
                  stretch of his attenuated line of march, nearly four miles long, which would be
                  exposed to flank attacks and liable to be cut like a thread into several pieces.
                  Braddock smiled at Franklin's ignorance, and replied, "These savages may, indeed,
                  be a formidable enemy to your raw American militia, but upon the king's regular
                  and disciplined troops, sir, it is impossible they should make any
                  impression."</p>
               <p>What singular fatuity. It was this very raw militia spoken of and treated so
                  contemptuously by him, that saved his army from being totally annihilated, and
                  himself from being killed and scalped in the battle approaching, while it was the
                  "king's regular and disciplined troops" which afterwards became utterly and
                  shamefully panicstricken, firing their pieces in the air or at their own
                  companions, and, when the day was thus lost, fleeing, as Washington expressed it,
                  "like sheep before the hounds."</p>
               <p>The Indian opinion of him was given by Scarooyaddy himself to Governor Morris and
                  the Pennsylvania Assembly three months after the defeat, which he attributed to
                  pride and ignorance. "He is now dead," said the Half-King, "but he was a bad man
                  when alive: he looked upon us as dogs, and would never hear what we said to him;
                  and that's the reason why a great many of our warriors left him, and would not be
                  under his command."</p>
               <p>There are numerous incidents told of Braddock before his arrival on our shores. It
                  is pretty certain, for instance, that he had once made a most unfeeling speech and
                  a cruel pun when he heard of the sad death of his beautiful but unfortunate sister
                  Fanny, who committed suicide under most distressing circumstances; that he was
                  mean and base enough to live on the infamous wages of a notorious Mrs. Upton, in
                  whose eyes he had found favor. (See <hi rend="i"/>Appendix P.) He was known to be
                  so needy that in one of his duels—this time with a Col. Gumley—his opponent, on
                  coming on the ground, tossed him his purse, saying "Braddock, you're a poor dog;
                  there, take my purse if you kill me, you'll have to run away, and then you'll not
                  have a shilling to support you;" and finally, that he spent the last evening in
                  London, prior to his departure for America, in the company of that frail actress,
                  Miss Bellamy, then living as the reputed wife of a Mr. Calcraft, whom Braddock
                  afterward made his executor. It is little wonder that the witty and sarcastic
                  Walpole called him a "very Iroquois in disposition."</p>
               <p>But these were matters of the past. All authorities, foreign and provincial, unite
                  in stating that since his arrival on our shores, the General had conducted himself
                  with honesty, dignity and diligence, using his utmost energies to push matters
                  forward—and this under the most vexatious and disheartening difficulties—and being
                  exceedingly anxious to further the king's service. Had he been successful as
                  everybody expected he would have been, it is probable we would have heard little
                  of him but praises. "Nothing is so successful as success." (See <hi rend="i"
                  />Appendix Q.)</p>
               <p>The worst that could be said of Braddock since his sojourn in America, was that he
                  was impatient, intolerant, and complaining—scolding at everybody and finding fault
                  with everything. But then it must also be admitted, he had much reason therefor.
                  The delays, swindles, and outrageous impositions which he and his army had to
                  submit to, in the way of horses, wagons, provisions, and general army supplies,
                  were almost incredible. The General's intercourse, too, with both Washington and
                  Franklin was always Pleasant and honorable to all parties; and when the latter had
                  raised a large number of wagons and teams<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7175-00000119"
                  /> for Braddock, in Pennsylvania, by means of a timely handbill circulated among
                  the Dutch farmers, in which the threat was craftily held out that unless the aid
                  was granted, the ferocious Hussar, Sir John St. Clair, would enter the province
                  with a body of horse and forcibly take what he wanted, Braddock expressed his
                  thanks to him in person, and wrote to his government that it was "almost the first
                  instance of integrity, address and ability that he had met with in all these
                  provinces."</p>
               <p>During his march, Braddock had gotten rid of many of his foolish and pompous
                  European notions. He soon discovered that America was a strange, unknown territory
                  for him and his veterans, and that a western wilderness, with its crowded trees,
                  dense thickets, and bridgeless streams, was a very bad place for high style or
                  display. Thus he started by buying a tawdry and lumbering travelling chariot from
                  General Sharpe, of Maryland; and on the 10th of May, the army was startled by
                  Braddock's rapid transit, on his way to Fort Cumberland, sitting grandly in his
                  chariot, with a body of light-horse galloping on either side. Poor, mistaken old
                  man, he was soon glad to come down to one sorry, attenuated cob, and after, to a
                  rude litter, carried by a few faithful soldiers.</p>
               <p>Braddock now held a long interview with both Jack and Waggoner. Their reports
                  seemed to make considerable impression on him, and he was anxious for morning that
                  he might confirm his doubts and consult with his officers, As soon as the orderly
                  reported the officers' tent ready for the three females, Braddock arose and
                  addressed himself very gently to Marie:</p>
               <p>"Miss de Bonneville, you will excuse the rough quarters we have to offer you, but
                  such as they are, you are most heartily welcome. I have heard from Captain Jack
                  your sorrowful story, and, believe me, sympathize with you from my very heart.
                  These are terrible times to all, but especially to one of your sex and culture. I
                  have tried to persuade Jack that it would be better for all three of you ladies to
                  retire to Captain Gist's plantation, not far from here, rather than follow the
                  fortunes of the army and share the privations of the camp and march. What think
                     <emph>you?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I thank you, General. After the terrible shock we've lately gone through, we
                  sadly need rest and quiet, all three of us; but still, if it wouldn't burthen you,
                  we—at least I—would prefer staying with the army, to running any new risks by the
                  way. I have other reasons," meaning her father's grave and her goods and
                  portfolios, "You have no doubt, whatever, of taking the fort, I presume?"</p>
               <p>Braddock smiled scornfully. "Never a doubt—<emph>couldn't</emph> have any. My
                  veterans will scatter this French-Indian rabble like grain from a threshing-floor.
                  I expect no more than a skirmish. You are assuredly welcome with us, Miss de
                  Bonneville, while Lieutenant Frazier can care for his wife and daughter until his
                  cabin is reached. I've about concluded to go by way of the river fords—will know
                  to-morrow, when General St. Clair reports."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, General," answered Marie, her eyes filling with tears at the memory of
                  that cabin, with its harrowing associations "and now we beg leave to retire."</p>

               <p>CAPTAIN ORME, having returned from conducting the Half-King, now led the way to
                  his tent, just next that of Braddock, and which had been fitted up as comfortably
                  as possible for their reception. It had been occupied by Braddock's three
                  aid-de-camps and secretary. A cold collation was found upon the table, and one of
                  the camp women—a Mrs. McMurtree—was there as attendant.<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_002" xml:id="return_002">*</ref>

                  <p><ref target="#return_002">*</ref>Shortly after the army left Fort Cumberland, not only were the Indian squaws
                     banished the camp, but all the white women—with the exception of two to a
                     company—were sent to Philadelphia. In the Pennsylvania archives are
                     published their names, and the number of O's and Mac's sufficiently attest
                     the nationality of Braddock's regiments.</p>
               </note>
               <p>Captain Orme now, at Jack's earnest request, led the way to a distant quarter of
                  the camp, where the seven Indians that accompanied Braddock were quartered. They
                  were all that were left of near fifty which had started from Cumberland. One of
                  these, Cashuwayon, or Captain New Castle, was a son of Queen Alaquippa; another
                  was Iagrea, Scarooyaddy's son-in-law, and two Mohawks, Esras and Moses (the song),
                  were his wife's brothers, so that Scarooyaddy's son was among relatives.</p>
               <p>The General, knowing the great importance attached by the simple-minded redmen to
                  a little ceremony and attention, and in order to palliate and overcome, as much as
                  possible, the bad effects of the stupid blunder of his grenadiers, had called this
                  evening's encampment Monecatootha, after the Half-King; had given the Indians a
                  tent in which to deposit and lament over the body; had stationed a guard before
                  it, and issued orders for a military funeral early the next morning, and a burial
                  with all the honors of war.</p>
               <p>As Captains Jack and Orme entered the tent, they found the Half-King bent in
                  tearless sorrow over the dead body of his son—an active and gallant young chief,
                  whom the father had left in the flush of youth and vigor of health. A number of
                  Indian ceremonies had already been performed over the body, and even then all were
                  engaged in a rude chant of lamentation; Iagrea beating the Tay-wa-egun or
                  one-headed drum—made by adjusting a deer's hide to one end of the section of a
                  hollow tree—while the others recounted the virtues and gallant exploits of the
                  deceased.</p>
               <p>Jack quietly went up to his old friend, took his hand, and whispered a few words
                  of comfort and condolence. The old Chief, grieved as he was, seemed pleased with
                  this visit, as he evidently was with the attentions and honors bestowed by
                  Braddock. With great pride and animation he spoke of his son's bravery, and then
                  narrated how the accident happened. Several loiterers in the very rear of the army
                  had been killed and scalped by a party of French Indians. The General had sent
                  back his grenadiers, before whom the hostile Indians had fled. They were
                  discovered again soon after in front, by his son and the other Indians,<pb
                     n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7175-00000121"/> who were about attacking them, when
                  they themselves were fired on by a party of Braddock's out-rangers, who mistook
                  them for the enemy, notwithstanding they made the agreed countersign, which was
                  holding up a bough and grounding their arms. By this fire the young chief was
                  killed; but the simple-minded father seemed so gratified with the orders Braddock
                  had given on the occasion, that the stupidity of the blunder was somewhat excused
                  and forgiven.</p>
               <p>Orme and Jack soon retired to quarters offered by the former, and the whole camp
                  was now again wrapped in silence. It was just the time for deepest slumber. Within
                  a narrow circuit in those dark, wild woods, lay over twelve hundred picked men,
                  who slept profoundly; totally unconscious of the sad fate and disgrace which
                  shortly awaited them. Foot-sore and travel-stained, they had lain them down that
                  night in unusually bright spirits. Two more days and their toil would be over; the
                  battle would be fought and won; the fort assaulted and taken, and then a rest from
                  all their labors and privations.</p>
               <p>The extended circuit of sentries kept their ceaseless vigils among the trees and
                  bushes. The little knots of flankers waked and slept by turn. The long line of
                  wagons—the horses hobbled about them—stretched down the narrow road overarched by
                  huge oaks, and elms, and hickories, and all was profound stillness.</p>
               <p>Most impressive and solemn is an encampment of soldiers just on the eve of a
                  bloody battle. It is well that the future lies hid from man. Could these unrecking
                  slumberers have foreseen the carnage that would shortly ensue—that of the fourteen
                  hundred and sixty men, officers and privates, who went into the battle, four
                  hundred and fifty-six would be slain outright; that four hundred and twenty-one
                  would be more or less grievously wounded, and that the rest would be a routed,
                  disgraced, and panic-stricken mob of fugitives, what a scene of horror and
                  commotion there would have been!</p>
               <p>It is not our aim or purpose to give a detailed account of Braddock's command, and
                  its tedious, toilsome march, first to Cumberland, and thence to this spot; but now
                  would seem a favorable time for grouping together a few salient facts which may
                  serve to give readers some comprehensive idea of the size, character and
                  composition of this ill-fated army.</p>
               <p>Its nucleus, in the shape of the 44th Regiment, Colonel Sir Peter Halket, and the
                  48th, Colonel Thomas Dunbar, had arrived from Cork, Ireland, disembarking at
                  Alexandria about the middle of March, 1755. Neither regiment numbered five
                  hundred, and these were made up of Irish, Scotch and English, drafted from
                  different commands, and a large proportion of base material. After reaching this
                  country, these two regiments were recruited by raw, provincial levies up to an
                  effective of seven hundred each, and, after innumerable and vexatious delays and
                  an immense labor, were joined by independent companies from New York, Virginia,
                  Maryland, South and North Carolina.</p>
               <p>The trouble, expense, and delay in getting the army supplied with wagons,
                  provisions, horses, etc., was almost incredible and entirely disheartening, and it
                  was not until about the 8th of June that the heterogeneous little command was
                  ready to march from Cumberland. Had not Dr. Benjamin Franklin raised a large force
                  of wagons and pack-horses in Pennsylvania, by the timely publication before
                  alluded to, in which he frightened the German population by a threat that if they
                  were not immediately furnished, the Hussar, Sir John St. Clair, would overrun the
                  province and impress them, the army would not have been able to march at all. The
                  whole force was divided into two brigades under Colonels Halket and Dunbar,<pb
                     n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7175-00000122"/> numbering about 2150 effectives, not
                  counting the usual train of non-militants—women, wagoners, and hangers-on.</p>
               <p>The progress of this ill-assorted command was painfully slow, five miles being
                  considered an excellent day's march, while most frequently it did not reach half
                  that. Bridges had to be built, roads to be cut the whole way, deep and miry
                  marshes to be traversed, and steep and rugged hills to be surmounted. The route
                  chosen was by no means the shortest or the easiest one. The advice of Nemacolin,
                  the Indian guide, was too closely followed. Frequently morasses had to be waded
                  through and savage hills to be climbed, the heavy artillery being let down by the
                  sailors with block and tackle. The number of wagons and pack-horses was strung out
                  in a line of over four miles in length, which was constantly made the object of
                  attack, though happily by small parties.</p>
               <p>In addition to the natural difficulties of the route, were superadded such as
                  arose from crazy wagons, wretched and inadequate food, most miserable horses, and
                  a general sickness and discontent among the soldiers and officers. It is little
                  wonder, then, that this army had been ten days in reaching the Little Meadows, but
                  twenty-four miles from Cumberland.</p>
               <p>This fatal tardiness would never do, and reductions of baggage were constantly
                  occurring. Even the officers were compelled to give up their horses to the
                  service, Washington, Braddock's aid-de-camp, offering his best charger, and
                  reducing his luggage to one poor half-filled portmanteau.</p>
               <p>At the Little Meadows a council of war was held, the result of which was that
                  Washington's advice was taken, and the army was divided. It was daily more evident
                  if Fort Duquesne was to be reached before it was reinforced, and in time to allow
                  of subsequent military operations tions, that a light fighting division must push
                  forward more rapidly, and so about twelve hundred of the best and most reliable
                  troops were sifted out, together with a select train of artillery and pack-horses
                  for the provisions.</p>
               <p>Colonel Dunbar, with all the heavy wagons, useless artillery and other <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">impedimenta,</foreign> was left behind with the worst and most
                  unreliable troops, to make his way as best he might. Even with these aids to a
                  more rapid progress, it was not until the 21st of June that Braddock entered
                  Pennsylvania, and not until the 30th, that he crossed the Yough, near where
                  Connellsville now stands, and now, here was the 7th of July, and Turtle Creek yet
                  remained to be passed, with a strong probability of being obliged to turn back on
                  their course and seek a crossing of the Monongahela.</p>
               <p>Had the General waited here for Dunbar's army, as was strongly urged by Sir John
                  St. Clair, the Quartermaster-General, it would probably have been the middle of
                  August before the fort would have been reached, and the whole army would either
                  have starved or fallen into the hands of the enemy, as numbers would have availed
                  little. "Dunbar, the Tardy," as he was called, had lost so many of his wretched
                  draught horses by sickness and starvation, and by constant stealings, that he
                  could only move half his wagons at a time. After one day's march, the miserable
                  and worn-out old jades were sent back to bring up the remainder, and then two days
                  more before a fresh start could be made.</p>
               <p>Now, add to all this a bad state of feeling among the troops, caused by an
                  insufficiency of provisions; no allowance of spirits; nothing but water to drink,
                  and that often bad and unwholesome, and a general disheartenment among the foreign
                  troops. Disputes and jealousies were common too among the officers, and Braddock
                  was not<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7175-00000123"/> even on speaking terms with his
                  two brigade commanders. Even the robust constitution of Major Washington had given
                  way under this state of things, and he had been travelling for ten days in the
                  rear in a covered wagon, and was but just now returning. He had exacted a promise
                  from Braddock that on no account should a battle be fought without him being
                  present.</p>

               <p>THE morning of the 7th dawned auspiciously. At the early beat of the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">reveillè</foreign> the whole army was astir. The quiet and
                  deadness of the night before was changed into most intense activity. From one end
                  of the long line to the other, every one was busy. The wagoners and batmen made
                  ready their horses; the fires were kindled and preparation for breakfast
                  commenced, and all the various steps of preparing for the march were soon
                  completed.</p>
               <p>After the morning meal was over, the first thing in order was the burial of the
                  young chief so unfortunately killed the night before. The whole command was
                  ordered to pay respect. Soon the Half-King, accompanied by the other Indians,
                  issued from the tent, followed by a special guard detailed to carry the body. This
                  funeral cortége was accompanied by many of the principal officers and the chief
                  band playing the Dead March.</p>
               <p>A grave had been dug on a slight eminence near by and at the foot of a clump of
                  chestnuts, just then in full blossom. The general officers, out of respect to the
                  Half-king, gathered around. The body was lowered to one of the Indians' own wild
                  chants; the chaplain read the service for the dead, and when all was over, there
                  was platoon firing over the grave. These little honors and attentions were so<pb
                     n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7175-00000124"/> agreeable to the Indians that they
                  became more attached to the service than before.</p>
               <p>Short march this day. The army soon came to a halt on the very brow of a
                  precipitous hill overlooking Brush Creek. Sir John St. Clair was out with his
                  engineers, his guides and his light-horse, but the reports were unfavorable—the
                  country utterly impracticable for artillery and the wagon train—and so it was
                  decided in the afternoon to abandon this direction altogether; to turn sharp about
                  and make for the Monongahela fords. The rest was much needed by both man and
                  beast. Some of the officers managed to get up horse races, and the soldiers
                  gathered about in knots and laughed and chatted, or grumbled and complained, as
                  suited their various moods and grievances.</p>
               <p>The late stirring adventures of Jack and the Half-King becoming by this time much
                  discussed, they were the objects of great interest to the rank and file, and of
                  much attention among the officers. The latter numbered many who rose to
                  distinction and held important commands in after years. Not to speak of General
                  Washington, who in this district had learned the rudiments of war, there was
                  General Gage, the well-known British commander at Boston and Bunker Hill; General
                  Horatio Gates, if not so much as General Arnold the hero, at least the one who
                  received the credit at Saratoga when General Burgoyne's army was so badly defeated
                  and cut up; General Gladwyn, whose gallant and obstinate defence of Detroit
                  against Pontiac and his leaguering hosts, is so well known; General Adam Stephen,
                  General Lewis, and others, besides British officers who attained high rank in
                  England. (See <hi rend="i"/>Appendix R.)</p>
               <p>There was still another officer of distinction in our revolutionary war whose
                  acquaintance Jack made this day in a rather singular way. He was sauntering away
                  in the rear among the wagons and wagoners—generally a rude, clownish, boisterous
                  and profane set of vagabonds—"lewd fellows of the baser sort"—who had gathered to
                  this expedition from Virginia, Maryland, but especially Pennsylvania.</p>
               <p>Among them was a rough, uncouth and powerful fellow, said to have been a Virginia
                  overseer. He had happened to incur the anger of one of the lower British officers,
                  who, "dressed in a little brief authority," were accustomed to be arrogant and
                  overbearing to all provincials. Reprimanding the teamster for his tardiness, he
                  probably received an insolent reply, whereupon the officer struck him with his
                  sword. The sturdy wagoner, not being able to brook this insult in presence of his
                  jeering companions, whipped out his lash, fell upon the officer, and gave him a
                  thorough and severe drubbing.</p>
               <p>So great an insult, coming especially from an American teamster and a hireling at
                  that, could not go unpunished in such a severely-disciplined army as Braddock's,
                  in which any officer or soldier found gaming received three hundred lashes; any
                  soldier found drunk, two hundred, and any soldier, or army follower found stealing
                  provisions was adjudged to death; and so for this rank offence the poor wagoner
                  was condemned to receive five hundred lashes, and as Jack was passing, the
                  execution of the sentence was about being concluded. Kneeling before, and his
                  hands tied around a sapling, the cat came down with terrible severity on the poor
                  fellow's bare shoulders. He squirmed, and writhed, and his flesh quivered under
                  the stinging, cutting lash until, when about four hundred and fifty strokes had
                  been conscientiously administered, the sufferer fainted, and fell into the arms of
                  the indignant Jack, who had him taken to his friend Gist's tent, dressed his
                  wounds, and carefully nursed and tended him.</p>
               <p>Gen. Daniel Morgan, who commanded the celebrated rifle corps of the revolution,
                  who proved such a powerful<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7175-00000125"/> aid at
                  Saratoga, and who caused Tarleton to fly at the Cow-pens, used afterwards to say
                  that "old King George" yet owed him fifty lashes. It was some little easement to
                  him to know that the very officer whom he had thrashed, afterwards acknowledged
                  himself in the wrong and made the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">amende
                     honorable.</foreign> It is said that in the battle of Braddock's field, Morgan
                  was shot in the neck, the ball passing through his mouth, taking out some of his
                  teeth by the way. This is probable, as some of the wagoners in the front were the
                  very first to receive the enemy's fire, and suffered severely. Those in the rear,
                  however, behaved shamefully. At the very first suspicion of defeat, these fellows,
                  to a man, abandoned their charges, cut the traces of their best horses, rode off
                  at hot speed, and made such astonishing time that at five the next morning the
                  first one rushed—his eyes distended with fright—into Dunbar's camp, with the
                  dreadful tidings that the whole army was completely beaten, destroyed,
                  annihilated, and that <emph>he</emph> was the sole survivor. (See <hi rend="i"

               <p>BY reason of the attenuated line of his army, Braddock was compelled to take even
                  greater precautions to guard against surprises and attacks during the march, than
                  when in camp. While the artillery, pack-horses, baggage and the main army were
                  slowly and painfully worked along the rude, narrow road hastily constructed by the
                  engineers right through the forest, numerous videttes and flanking parties were
                  thrown out on either side, and a surprise was thus rendered almost impossible.</p>
               <p>On the 8th of July, at the beating of the "assembly," both soldiers and officers
                  turned out with unusual alacrity. The tedious and harassing march was nearly over,
                  and, leaving the head waters of Turtle Creek, the army turned off at right angles
                  and took the direct route for the Monongahela fords.</p>
               <p>Jack's usual place on the march had been with the Indians and Captain Gist, but
                  now he walked along side of Marie, who, mounted on an easy-going palfrey and in
                     company<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7175-00000126"/> pany with Jennie and Mrs.
                  Frazier, had been requested by Braddock to keep close with him.</p>
               <p>Near the present town of Stewartsville, Pa., the head of the army, preceded by the
                  ringing blows of the axe and the crash of falling trees, soon plunged into the
                  sequestered valley of Long Run, and over its lonely swales and hillsides; through
                  its dark thickets and coverts, and among its luxuriant forests of oak and maple,
                  the baggage and artillery jolted and rumbled along, while the pack-horses, mounted
                  officers, and straggling foot-soldiers picked and plodded their tedious way,
                  startling the wild bird or beast almost at every step.</p>
               <p>General Braddock was very considerate for Miss de Bonneville's comfort, and
                  frequently sent Bishop, his body-servant, to consult her wishes, and ever and anon
                  rode by her side and engaged in conversation with her and her protector. At noon
                  the whole force took dinner at a spot near where Sampson's Mills now stand, and
                  then made a brief march to a lovely and sheltered nook, midway between Long and
                  Crooked Runs, having made during the day no less than eight miles—the best and
                  most cheerful march since leaving Cumberland.</p>
               <p>The route between these two runs lay along a most singular plateau or table-land,
                  having an average width of about a hundred rods, now known as "the white-oak
                  flats."</p>
               <p>The buoyant soldiers pitched their tents with joy, and the whole camp was soon
                  alive with preparations for the night. A bountiful fountain—to this day known as
                  "Braddock's spring"—here poured forth its refreshing waters. After the evening
                  meal, the entire grove was vocal with song and laughter, and little knots of
                  soldiers and officers, by this or that stately oak or mossy trunk, discussed the
                  eventful morrow.</p>
               <p>By general order, the arms were now burnished up; fresh loads put into the
                  muskets; all the clothes and accoutrements brushed and scoured, and every
                  preparation made for a grand military display which, should strike a wholesome
                  dread into the hearts of the foe. But few of the British regulars who did not
                  think that an easy victory would crown their arms, and that a sharp, brief
                  skirmish would open an easy way to the possession of the fort which had for so
                  long been the almost sole subject of their thoughts and conversation. The
                  provincial troops were not so sanguine, and gravely shook their heads at British
                  boasts. They had more experience of Indian stratagems and bravery, and felt that
                  success would depend on fighting and whipping them in their own way.</p>
               <p>A council of war had been held early in the evening, at which were present all the
                  field officers—Colonels Halket, Gage, and Burton, and Majors Sir John St. Clair
                  and Sparks. At this last official meet, Sir John, with that passionate hastiness
                  which so distinguished him, vehemently urged the sending forward a detachment to
                  invest the fort that very night. But it being argued that the force so dispatched
                  would not be within proper supporting distance, and that such a move would be more
                  judicious from the next evening's encampment, the gruff and tempestuous old
                  Quartermaster-General was fain to acquiesce.</p>
               <p>Sir Peter Halket, next in command to Braddock, and more cautious and diffident of
                  success than he, now frankly expressed his forebodings, and with great solemnity
                  enjoined on Braddock—with whom he was scarcely on speaking terms—to take every
                  possible precaution against ambushes and surprises: pressing him most earnestly to
                  thoroughly examine every foot of the way, and to beat up the forest as Highland
                  hunters beat up the mountain coverts for game.</p>
               <p>To this timely advice, the confident General, still possessing that overweening
                  confidence in the discipline of his<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7175-00000127"/> own
                  veterans, and that fatal contempt for his Canadian and Indian foes, listened with
                  impatience, and the wary old veteran retired in sadness from his presence. Sir
                  Peter was a fine old Scotch soldier and high-born gentleman of the ancient
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">régime.</foreign> A nobleman by birth, he had married
                  the Lady Amelia Stewart, daughter of the Earl of Moray, two of his sons being then
                  with him. He was a brave, loyal, sagacious and honorable gentleman and an
                  experienced officer, who had risen by merit alone; and had Brad-dock trusted more
                  in him and in Washington—the two who generally agreed touching all military
                  movements—it would have saved him from defeat as well as disgrace.</p>
               <p>At the famous battle of Preston Pans, which occurred only ten years before between
                  Sir John Cope and the Highland clans and Jacobitish adherents of Charles Edward,
                  the Pretender, Sir Peter, then lieutenant-colonel, had been captured and released
                  on parole by Charles. This coming to the ears of the Duke of Cumberland, he
                  ordered that officer to disregard his parole and rejoin his regiment, which Sir
                  Peter stoutly and resolutely refused to do, saying that "His Royal Highness was
                  master of his commission but not of his honor." The king approved this proper
                  resolve of an honorable soldier and he retained his rank. It is sad to think of
                  the fate which awaited so good a man. He and one of his sons now lie buried near
                  the bloody field where they so bravely courted death rather than dishonor.</p>
               <p>It was now agreed that the "narrows" lying between the army and Frazier's—being
                  very impracticable for artillery and affording for several miles admirable
                  facilities and opportunities for attack and ambush—should be avoided by crossing
                  the Monongahela by the fords already tested by Captain Waggoner; and so Lieutenant
                  Gage was ordered to march before daybreak, with two companies of grenadiers, 160
                  of the rank and file, with Gates' independent ent company, all preceded with
                  proper guides, etc., to pass the two fords and take post after the second crossing
                  to secure the passage. At four o'clock he was to be followed by Sir John St.
                  Clair, with 250 men, including the engineers and a company of carpenters, to make
                  roads for the artillery and baggage, which was to march with the balance of the
                  army at five.</p>
               <p>This important business having been transacted, the General, being in a
                  particularly gay and hopeful mood, turned aside to the tent of his aids—now
                  occupied by Marie and Frazier's wife and daughter—where he found Captain Jack and
                  his own chief guide, Captain Christopher Gist, whose happy escape with Fairfax,
                  Queen Alaquippa's son, we have already noted.</p>
               <p>Marie was still overwhelmed with her great grief, but occasionally roused herself
                  to take interest in passing movements and even some part in the conversation. Jack
                  had remained with her as much as possible the last two days, striving ever to
                  divert her mind from its absorbing sorrow; making no allusion whatever to the sad
                  events at Frazier's cabin, but constantly surrounding her with those little acts
                  of attention and thoughtful regard for her comfort, which betrayed—far more than
                  could any words of his—the homage of his heart and his deep-felt sympathy in her
                  affliction.</p>
               <p>These little civilities of his did not pass without notice from Marie. When did
                  they ever in like relations? It is the thousand nameless little proffers of
                  gallantry and considerate attention, where self is forgotten and where every want
                  of the loved one is anticipated, which constitute the grace of young love and give
                  to it its chief zest and flavor, Happy are those who, in after life, can keep up
                  the devotion of their days of courtship and its varied modes of expression. It is
                  rare, but it is beautiful, to see the husband of sixty just as fervent and
                  constant in his delicate attentions<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7175-00000128"/>
                  tions as the impetuous lover of twenty; and yet this is the test and token of the
                  truest and purest love—such as comes not from the blood, but from the soul.</p>
               <p>While Braddock was closely questioning Jack and Gist as to their late adventures,
                  and anxiously speculating as to the fate of Talbot—who, despite his
                  eccentricities, was a general favorite in camp for his pluck and good humor—the
                  step of a horse was heard outside, and immediately after, the flap of the tent was
                  unceremoniously lifted, and a tall and stately form entered. The stranger started
                  back in great and unaffected surprise when he saw who were the occupants of the
                  tent, and making a hurried but courteous bow, was about to retire in much
                  confusion, when all three gentlemen started to their feet, and rushed towards him,
                  Braddock catching and pressing the young officer's hand and exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"Why, Major, this is indeed a surprise and a pleasure. When, and how did you
                  rejoin the army? and, my poor fellow, how thin and weak you do look! I trust, dear
                  Major, you've not over-tasked your strength. I expressly charged our Doctor Walker
                  not to let you put foot on ground till you were able to stand the march; but what
                  the deuce am I thinking of? Plague take it! if this backwoods life don't make one
                  forget all his manners. Allow me, Miss de Bonneville"—leading forward the stately
                  and still wondering young officer—"to present to you one of my military family—my
                  trusted aid, Major Washington. S'death! I don't much wonder at his surprise at
                  finding his quarters so charmingly occupied."</p>
               <p>Marie, her fine, earnest face suffused with blushes but with a look of evident
                  pleasure in her beaming eyes, arose and answered his dignified bow with a graceful
                  courtesy, remarking:</p>
               <p>"I ask of Major Washington a thousand pardons, and am sorry if my temporary
                  possession of his tent will put him to any inconvenience."</p>
               <p>"I beg, Miss de Bonneville, that you'll not mention it," replied Washington. "I
                  only regret that in wishing to surprise my tent-mates, Orme and Morris, I did not
                  inform myself of your presence. Please make yourself perfectly at home in it."</p>
               <p>"And now, old fellow," said Braddock, again affectionately pressing Washington's
                  hand, "here are your friends Gist and Jack, and most eager to greet you," while
                  both of these admirers of his warmly took each a hand, and welcomed him back to
                  the army.</p>
               <p>"Why, Jack, and Gist, too!" said Washington. "How rejoiced I am to see you again
                  in the flesh, and with whole scalps! Orme's last letter told me you had gone on a
                  dangerous scout, and were probably either killed or captured. Nothing has ever
                  chafed me so much as being stretched impotently on my back, while I might have
                  been as actively if not so usefully employed. I was afraid, General, you would
                  forget your promise to me not to give battle without letting me know, and so I
                  came on in a wagon with the last provision convoy from Dunbar's camp."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Braddock, "and you look at this moment fitter for a hospital couch
                  than for a march—still less a battle. I must remand you to the care of Dr. Craik
                  and Bishop, now that Alston your own servant is also sick."</p>
               <p>"General," laughingly replied Washington, "I would have been much worse had it not
                  been for the James's pills you kindly forwarded me. They acted on my system like
                  magic, restoring tone, and giving me at the same time strength and spirits."</p>
               <p>All this time Washington could not refrain from turning occasional glances, in
                  which surprise and curiosity were plainly but not offensively manifest, towards
                  Marie, as if he were trying to account for the strange presence of so<pb
                     n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7175-00000129"/> beautiful and elegant a lady. The
                  General observing this, attempted to rally him, laughingly remarking, "I see,
                  Major, by the looks you throw toward Miss de Bonneville, that our guest and her
                  visit here are a mystery to you."</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, General, I must confess, saving the fair lady's presence, that she
                  puzzles me no little. Such fruit does not grow on the trees hereabouts. She has
                  not come with our army from the East, that I know; and where she could spring from
                  in the West passes my poor comprehension. I trust the lady," bowing gracefully
                  toward Marie, "does not take it amiss, or think me uncivil because the General
                  has—too frankly, perhaps—uttered a truth."</p>
               <p>"Not at all, Major. I have, then, much the advantage of you," modestly replied
                  Marie, "for I have often heard of Colonel Washington, and, I must add, nothing to
                  his hurt. Jenny Frazier and her mother are never tired of sounding his praises.
                  I've heard, also, the French officers of the fort speak favorably of you, although
                  they <emph>do</emph> feel somewhat sorely concerning the death—or as they style
                  it—the <emph>assassination</emph> of Monsieur Jumonville, whom they allege was an
                  ambassador."</p>
               <p>"Why, this increases the mystery," gravely answered Washington. "French officers
                  of the fort and yours a French name; and pray, what does Miss de Bonneville think
                  of the Jumonville case. I trust nothing to the disparagement of my honor?"</p>
               <p>"Not in the least, Major. Had I done so, be assured I would not have mentioned the
                  matter. I know the whole case, and acquit you of everything but what was to the
                  highest degree honorable and patriotic. Sieur de Beaujeu takes your part strongly,
                  but Captain Dumas either doubts or affects to doubt."</p>
               <p>"Major," interrupted Braddock, "I fear you'll have to give up the conundrum,
                  unless Jack will come to your assistance. 'Tis rarely a scout brings such rare
                  booty— and allow me to add—beauty, as Jack's late one. Not content with bearding
                  the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Parlez-vous</foreign> in their very den, giving their
                  Indian allies several severe fights, and nearly drowning the old Scarooyaddy, he
                  surprises us by bringing back this gentle lady, whom we hope soon to install as
                  mistress of Fort Duquesne and interpreter extraordinary between us and the French.
                  Rest you here, while I make out my orders for the morrow and tell Orme and Morris
                  of your arrival.</p>

               <p>"WASHINGTON soon heard the brief but connected history of late events, and the
                  reports concerning the fort, Indian allies, etc., and passed some time in
                  conversation with Marie. At last, rising, he courteously bade her goodnight
                  and—Gist wishing to retire to his quarters—engaged Jack for a round about the
                  camp.</p>
               <p>"I don't know how it is, Captain," he said, as soon as he was fairly outside, "but
                  my return to camp has already acted like a strong cordial on me. I have been of so
                  little use in this expedition, and was so fearful that I would miss altogether its

                  new heart. By the by, Jack, that is a strange story you tell me about your late
                  adventures and the way in which you came upon old friends and rescued them. Your
                  amiable <foreign xml:lang="FRA">protégée</foreign> is very beautiful, and I
                  flatter myself I know a fine woman and a true lady when I see her. There's a part
                  of the story," looking meaningly at his companion, "that remains to be told; eh,
                  Captain?"</p>
               <p>"Not that I am aware of, Major," reservedly answered Jack, with dignity. "Miss de
                  Bonneville's grief is too recent and crushing not to enlist my most heart-felt
                  sympathies. Her poor father placed her under my protection for the present, and my
                  duty is to endeavor to assuage, somewhat, her great grief. I scarce know now," as
                  if musingly to himself, "whether I'm doing right or wrong in going back to her
                  father's grave. 'Tis a slow way to make her forget, but she seems to wish it; she
                  seems to wish it."</p>
               <p>Washington, respecting his companion's feelings, made no answer, but linking his
                  arm in Jack's, passed with him along the line of tents.</p>
               <p>Here we may state, in explanation of Braddock's warm and affectionate welcome of
                  Washington, that nothing in that unfortunate General's American career reads more
                  pleasantly to one of this country, or does more credit to both his head and heart,
                  than the just and ever warm appreciation held of Washington's character and
                  abilities. He seemed to single out both Franklin and Washington as objects of his
                  special praise and approval. On his arrival in the country he found the latter,
                  who had been the esteemed and honored colonel of, the Virginia troops, and who was
                  exceedingly anxious to still further serve his king and country in the field, at
                  Mount Vernon. This unwelcome retirement was compelled by King George's order,
                  denying all rank to the Colonial military in comparison with those given by
                  himself. To obviate this difficulty, Braddock sent him a very friendly letter, not
                  only offering him the position of aid-de-camp, but requesting him to suit his own
                  convenience as to time, and to consider himself at liberty, in all events, to come
                  or go, as best suited his business or inclinations.</p>
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7175-00000131"/>
               <p>This position, Washington, desirous not only of serving his country, but of taking
                  lessons in the military art from so experienced a teacher, hastened gladly to
                  accept. During the whole march, it is certain that Braddock not only frequently
                  consulted Washington, but acted on his advice, even when it was somewhat at
                  variance with his own convictions. In one of Washington's letters, in which he
                  states how Braddock condemned the Colonial authorities and contractors for their
                  supineness and lack of honor and honesty, he adds: "We have frequent disputes on
                  this head, which are maintained with warmth on both sides—especially on his, as he
                  is incapable of arguing without it, or giving up any point he asserts, be it ever
                  so incompatible with reason or common sense."</p>
               <p>When Washington took sick on the route, nothing could exceed the General's
                  attention to and solicitude for him, dispatching his own physician to him, sending
                  him the pills he himself made use of, detailing a guard to take care of him on the
                  road when too ill to bear the joltings of a wagon, keeping up a correspondence
                  with him, and, finally, solemnly promising him that if he would stay quietly in
                  the rear and nurse himself, he would on no account give battle without having, if
                  it were possible, Washington present.</p>
               <p>It is also certain that Braddock had such a high esteem for him as a man, and
                  confidence in him as a soldier, that it was his intention to give him a high
                  position in the king's regular army. This was distinctly promised him; Governor
                  Dinwiddie emphatically asserts it. At his death, Braddock expressed compunctions
                  at not having more scrupulously followed Washington's advice, and singled him out
                  as his nuncupative legatee, bequeathing to him his favorite charger and his
                  body-servant Bishop, so well-known in after years as a faithful attendant.</p>
               <p>Washington, notwithstanding a certain gravity and stateliness liness which well
                  became, and seemed natural to the man, and Jack, notwithstanding a certain reserve
                  and sternness, which were part of his habitual manner, were both very popular with
                  the common soldiers, more especially with the Colonial troops, and as both men now
                  passed under the trees and down the long narrow line of tents, they were warmly
                  and even affectionately greeted. They stopped to, chat with this, and with that
                  group of officers or men, and, finally, attracted by the noise of loud laughter
                  and merry singing, they came to a pause before a motley crowd of officers and
                  soldiers—foreign and provincial—Scotch and Irish—camp-women, wagoners, and what
                  not.</p>
               <p>It seemed as if all the jovial and roystering spirits of the camp were here
                  assembled, and all, too, in a state of excitement and joyfulness. From the broad
                  brogue spoken and sung, it was easy to detect the Scotch nationality of most of
                  the group. They joked and chaffed and sang together, as if campaigning in the
                  wilderness, surrounded by Indian outlyers and on the very eve of what might prove
                  a bloody and desperate struggle, was the merriest business in the world.</p>
               <p>It was a strange and impressive scene in these virgin forests—vast solitudes
                  frequented only by bird or savage beast or the still more savage Indian. Beneath
                  an immense white oak, whose huge trunk and spreading branches, with their thick
                  overhanging canopy of leaves, were lit up by the flickering flames of the camp
                  fire, reclined the promiscuous assemblage. Now Sergeant Mac Pherson, noted
                  throughout the whole army for his fine, powerful voice, and for the fervor which
                  he generally threw into the song, was vociferously called on for "Annie
                  Laurie"—that old camp favorite of Scotch soldiers out on a campaign. Nothing could
                  exceed the peculiar, startling effect, in these solemn old forests, of those
                  simple and touching<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7175-00000132"/> ing words,
                  delivered with unusual pathos, and in a voice oi exceeding richness: <q>

               <p>As the Sergeant's voice rang full and clear along the stretch of tents, there was
                  a general hush; all ears were attentive; all hearts were affected, and before the
                  touching lyric which expressed so general a heart-sentiment had died away amid
                  those leafy aisles and sombre shades, many an eye was filled with tears.</p>
               <p>Then followed on the part of other noted singers, war songs, love songs, and
                  drinking songs—Scotch, Irish and American, until at last the cry arose to round
                  off with the "Braddock Campaign Song," a jingling provincial ballad, more
                  remarkable, let us hope, for its melody than for its metre, but which, like our
                  own old John Brown war song of a later date, was a general favorite with the army: <q>

               <p>Many a camp doggerel, with no more pretensions to poetic or literary merit than
                  the above, but yet having a good, ringing chorus, and its defects hidden under a
                  dramatic action and in a stirring melody, has excited a martial spirit and urged
                  men to mighty deeds of war. So, in the present instance, the effect was simply
                  prodigious. The chorus, "Huzza, my valiant countrymen," etc., was taken up by
                  group after group of soldiers, until the whole camp rang, and the woods re-echoed
                  with exciting "huzzas." Had they gone into battle next day with it in their
                  mouths, who can tell but the fate of the struggle would have been changed?</p>
               <p>The beat to quarters now came to quench the excitement, and the camp gradually
                  sank into silence and slumber. The effect of the song on Washington and Jack was
                  rather a saddening one. They saw more plainly, perhaps, than did the poor,
                  unthinking soldiers about, the difficulties now immediately before them. Both of
                  them knew well the character of the French foe they were about to encounter, as
                  also the savage ferocity and devilish ingenuity of his painted allies. Indians of
                  different tribes had followed<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7175-00000133"/> their
                  march ever since leaving Fort Cumberland, never losing a chance to harass troops,
                  run off horses and cattle, and kill and scalp stragglers; and thus all this
                  enthusiasm of, the army, begotten of the feeling that now their weary marchings
                  were about to end, could not altogether stifle Washington's apprehensions.</p>

               <p>TAKING leave of Jack, who went to the quarters where Scarooyaddy and his little
                  band of faithful Indians had also—after their own fashions, with their own rude

                  a marquee tent near the middle of the line.</p>
               <p>To his request for admission, a gruff but hearty voice answered: "Coom ye in," and
                  Washington advanced to the side of a rude couch, on which reclined the large and
                  stalwart form of a noble-looking old officer of some seventy years. His hair was
                  plentifully sprinkled with white; a keen, gray eye sparkled under a bushy, shaggy
                  eyebrow, while a stiff, white moustache gave the square, Scottish face a stern and
                  decidedly military look. He now appeared, however, sad and weary. He had evidantly
                  been engaged in writing, as paper and pen were then lying on a low campchest
                  beside him.</p>

               <p>At sight of Washington he started up quickly, warmly pressed the proffered hand in
                  both his own, and said, in a strong Scotch brogue, which grew broader in
                  proportion as he was excited: "Ah, Geordie, my worthy young laddie, I heerd you
                  were coom back to camp, and would hae' ta'en it amiss o' you if ye had na ca'd on

               <p>"Ise muckle reason, lad," replied Halket, gloomily. "Awell, Major, ye'll be in at

                  the General will give his army a fair chance, the foe must be badly beaten."</p>

                  which maks me doot—a vision of death and bluid—of battle and carnage."</p>
               <p>"Why, Sir Peter, this is positively wicked! You are ill—have been over-anxious of
                  late! You must drive away these gloomy phantasies—the creatures of a distempered
                  mind. God does not work in that way, Colonel Halket."</p>
               <p>"Bide a wee, bide a wee; I dinna ask ye to believe, Geordie," solemnly replied the
                  old nobleman. "I only say what my ain een saw. I tak' the warning to mysel' alone,
                  an' tell nane but you—not e'en my puir bairns. As I walkit alane under the oaks
                  this night, a mist seemed to rise before my two een; and as I lookit and lookit,
                  wundering what culd it a' mean, the glamour brake up into shaips and ghaists, and,
                  'tis thrue as that I see ye, Major, I saw a stream running thick with bluid, and
                  on its banks a throng of spectres walkit, and one stuid there for me and one for
                  the bairn James, and baith were crossed, whilk I na understand. But this I knaw,
                  they were all white with shrouds. Ken ye what that means, laddie?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I do not, Sir Peter," replied Washington, deeply affected by the fixed
                  and solemn look of the old man. "I put but little faith in Scotch superstitions,
                  although the belief in them <emph>is</emph> now so common."</p>
               <p>"It means <emph>death,</emph> Geordie. If the shrouds be below the middle, not so
                  soon; but if aboon the breath, the <emph>very next day.</emph> All the shrouds I
                  saw, Major, were <emph>high up on the breast.</emph> Oh, Ise sair distraught, but
                  ne'er fear ye but I'll do my whail duty the morrow, dear Geordie; but I tells ye
                  my weird is dreed, and so is that of my bairn, James. Wha, alas, will pipe our
                  coronach? Ye see my will there, and whin Ise dead and gone, ye'll see to't, lad;
                  and noo let's turn the talk." (See <hi rend="i"/>Appendix T.)</p>
               <p>Colonel Halket now, with a great effort, seemed to rouse himself out of his gloom,
                  and talked calmly and even pleasantly on various subjects, and on Washington
                  rising to go shortly after, he shook him most affectionately by the hand, and
                  begged him to take care of himself. As he passed out into the air, Sir Peter
                  smiled sadly, held up his warning finger, and simply said: "Ye'll remember,
                  Geordie, the Scotchman's <foreign xml:lang="GAE">taisch.</foreign> I saw nae end
                  of bluid, bluid, bluid!"</p>
               <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7175-00000135"/>
               <p>Washington, himself still weak and suffering from his prolonged fever, was very
                  deeply moved by Sir Peter's manner and relation. He soon met Morris and Orme, who
                  had been out on the hunt for him; but, try his very best, he could not shake off
                  his gloom; and, on reaching his quarters, threw himself anxious and distressed on
                  his couch, without undressing.</p>
               <p>His slumber was fitful and disturbed, and the earliest streak of dawn found him up
                  and preparing for the day. Parts of the camp were even then in motion. He
                  witnessed the departure of Gage's advance, and then of Sir John St. Clair's
                  working party.</p>
               <p>At six the whole army had taken their simple meal, and with quick step and joyful
                  hearts, marched down the valley of "Crooked Run" to the Monongahela, but two miles
                  distant. Soon cheer after cheer went along the ranks as the river was first
                  sighted. Those in front broke into a run, while those behind pressed hard after
                  them, and all was joy and tumult at the first view of the beautiful Monongahela,
                  which rolled its peaceful waters between hills, clad from the river's margin to
                  their very tops, with the freshest and greenest verdure.</p>

               <p>JUST as the little army emerged from the defile, a singular apparition—as it
                  looked to the soldiers—met their wondering eyes. On a jutting rock, some twenty
                  feet higher than their route, stood the bold figure of a very tall and
                  commanding-looking woman. Her coarse, black hair was plentifully streaked with
                  gray, and fell down her back in great abundance; her countenance, though dark and
                  weather-beaten, was yet comely and impressive. Her eye was like the eagle's for
                  fire and boldness. She had on the moccasins and leggings of the Indian, but over
                  her shoulders was thrown an ample, flowing robe of fine cloth, while in her
                  outstretched hand was something like a lance, with which she would point to the
                  opposite shore, as if showing to the army the way to honor and victory.</p>
               <p>The commanding figure of this strange being stood strongly revealed against the
                  sky. Not a word spake she nor movement made she, but as she stretched out her long
                  wand or lance, as if showing the route to the enemy, the<pb n="262-263"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000136"/> superstitious soldiers were at first appalled, but,
                  afterwards, taking it as a good omen, they gave her cheer after cheer—the first
                  English cheer that those hills had ever echoed.</p>
               <p>Thus she proudly stood, until the crowd of officers, led by Braddock and including
                  Washington, Marie, Jack and others, stopped abreast of her. Then, with a majestic
                  step, and leaning on her lance, she slowly descended from her rocky perch, and
                  with stately and dignified mien, strode directly towards Washington. All were
                  sorely puzzled, and Braddock most of all, scarce knowing whether she? was "of the
                  earth, earthy," or some tutelar divinity of these Western wilds, standing at their
                  very entrance to warn off intruders from her dominions.</p>
               <p>All at once Washington recognized her, and exclaimed, "Why, as I live, General and
                  gentlemen, 'tis the Delaware Queen Alaquippa, for many years the unwavering friend
                  of the English, and the mother of our two trusty scouts, Fairfax and New Castle.
                  Come! I must descend and meet her with due deference, for, I warn you, she stands
                  greatly on her dignity. She was once greatly offended because I dared pass her
                  royal lodge—which lies at the junction of the Yough with yonder river—without
                  calling on her."</p>
               <p>So saying, Washington dismounted, went forward to meet her, greeted her kindly and
                  politely, and presented her first to Braddock and after to the other officers, and
                  to Marie.</p>
               <p>The old queen spoke pretty fair English, and, in right royal style, bade the
                  General and his army welcome to her country; told him of the route, and expresssed
                  the hope that he would speedily take the fort which dominated her river. After
                  shaking hands all round, she passed to where were Scarooyaddy and her worthy
                  sons.</p>
               <p>By 8 o'clock the first passage of the river was made, at a point opposite Crooked
                  Run, and even to this day observable by a deep scar in the banks, where they were
                  graded down to make a road for the artillery. The army now found itself on a broad
                  bottom, covered with a fine growth of maple, walnut, and sycamore, and moved
                  steadily forward in the road cut for them.</p>
               <p>Soon a messenger comes back from Gage to inform Braddock that the advance has
                  recrossed the river without any resistance, and is posted agreeably to orders. The
                  only enemy seen was a score of savages who had been routed from cover and who had
                  fled at his approach. This was joyful tidings, for if the foe was to stand
                  anywhere, surely the river crossing was the expected place. By eleven o'clock the
                  second ford was reached, nearly opposite the mouth of Turtle Creek, and but a
                  quarter of a mile below what is known now as the "Second Dam."</p>
               <p>Here the "broad bottom" begins to narrow until it runs into the hills very near
                  the margin of the river. On this grassy savannah, denuded of trees, Braddock, not
                  doubting that the enemy were anxiously watching his every motion, resolved to
                  impress them with the size and character of his command. Accordingly, while the
                  banks were being graded down, on that as well as the other side, to allow of the
                  passage of the artillery, baggage wagons, cattle, etc., the troops were ordered to
                  appear as for dress-parade.</p>
               <p>Now the astonished hills re-echo with the loud beat of drums and the swell of
                  martial music. Every man was attired in his cleanest apparel. The burnished arms
                  shone and glistened in the noonday sun. The flags and colors were unfurled, and
                  the joyful and well-drilled troops, glittering in scarlet and gold, were rapidly
                  marched and manœuvred, and put through all their movements, which they executed
                  with the precision of a piece of machinery.</p>
               <p>This plateau, where, for over an hour, all this showy parade was going on, was in
                  full and uninterrupted view from the subsequent battle-field. The officers, and
                     soldiers<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7175-00000137"/> all viewed it with
                  undisguised pride and delight. There was but one universal belief, and that was of
                  the speedy occupation of the fort. It is no wonder that Washington, in after life,
                  declared it to be the most beautiful and imposing spectacle he had ever witnessed.
                  Even Sir Peter Halket, as the grim old Scotch soldier sat his horse, near where
                  Braddock, Washington, and Mile, de Bonneville were posted, seemed to throw off
                  entirely the gloom of the night before.</p>
               <p>All was now ready, and after a brief repast the army had safely passed over by the
                  second ford, and reformed about two o'clock, in a thick walnut grove, several
                  hundred yards below the mouth of Turtle Creek, and hard by Frazier's cabin, where
                  Jack and Scarooyaddy made such a gallant and successful resistance.</p>
               <p>How sadly and yearningly had poor Marie kept her eyes towards that cabin, and to
                  the sacred spot on the river's margin where rested all that was mortal of her dear
                  lamented Father! She was now free to visit it.</p>

               <p>Go we now back to poor Talbot and Smith, who, after making that most gallant
                  effort to escape from Fort Duquesne by water on the day of the canoe races, were
                  re-captured by Nymwha—the young lord's Indian Father <foreign xml:lang="LAT">in
                     posse</foreign>—and brought back to Dumas. The plan of the fort having been
                  found on Talbot's person, that officer remanded him back to the guard house, as a
                  person too dangerous to be left at large, while the lad Smith was put with him for
                  company.</p>
               <p>It was then late at night, and after having had the full range of the fort; having
                  enjoyed the exciting boat-races, and the interesting preparations for the
                  challenge ball match, which were even then being continued, it may well be
                  supposed that the change to the solitude of the lonely guard-house was anything
                  but pleasant.</p>
               <p>The key had scarce turned in the massive door, and the footsteps of the guard had
                  just died away along the passage, when Talbot—whom it was difficult long to
                  repress—first broke the silence by a long whistle, and then a few impatient
                  tattoos with his feet on the puncheon floor, ending in:</p>
               <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7175-00000138"/>
               <p>"Well, here's a rum go! Jimmy, if you feel like laughing boisterously, pray don't
                  mind me; I'll excuse it, but, <emph>I'm</emph> going to swear. If you know any
                  word bigger or longer to swear by than Nebuchadnezzar, let me have it, I want to
                  do full justice to the occasion."</p>
               <p>Poor Smith was in sad humor for jesting, and kept a lugubrious silence.</p>
               <p>"Why, James, your face seems to have soured on you. Liver must be out of order.
                  Give me one of those sweet smiles of yours that are creating so many flutters
                  under Mlle. Fleury's bodice. So—that's better! Never get in to the lollydrums,
                  lad; they won't help you a bit. Leave them for love-sick girls, who've nothing to
                  do but dawdle."</p>
               <p>"Why, Mr. Talbot," at last answered Smith, "you're a queer cove and seem to take
                  life very easy."</p>
               <p>"Got to do so, my boy, else life would take me very hard. I see nothing in our
                  present condition to whine or whimper about. I've already resolved what
                     <emph>I'm</emph> about to do."</p>
               <p>"And, please, what is that, sir? I'm but a green boy—never been away from home
                  before; and besides, sir, I don't care about letting <emph>you</emph> know,"
                  sinking his voice, and with an air of confidence, "I've—I'm—I've got a sweetheart
                  at home, and am engaged to be married."</p>
               <p>"Phew! the devil! why, what an old <foreign xml:lang="FRA">roué</foreign> you are,
                  to be sure. I'll tell Miss Fleury on you. But, bother the girls, now. Why, I'm not
                  a very old chicken, Jimmy, and yet I've a full score of sweethearts about the
                  world, of all lingoes and colors, too, from pink-and-white down to richest cream
                  color. Never feel exactly right under my doublet unless something of that kind's
                  going on. Now, I'm getting real anxious about Wau-ki-na, the young Indian princess
                  or chieftainess, or whatever's her rank. I've never yet seen the girl, Jimmy, to
                  match her for either grace, beauty, or modesty. She's struck me harder than usual.
                  Heigho! James. Plague take the sirens, I say! Never out of <emph>one's</emph>
                  clutches but am dropping into those of another. As the old song says, 'First be
                  off with the old love, before you're on with the new.' Wau-ki-na, too, is so
                  artless, has such soft, lustrous eyes and such a flute-like voice. I never—"</p>
               <p>"I must quote your own words on you, sir," interrupted Smith, "and say, 'Oh,
                  bother the girls, now!' What <emph>I</emph> want at present, is to get out of this
                  scrape."</p>
               <p>"A fair hit, James. I owe you one. Well, first, I shall immediately stretch myself
                  on Dumas' robe in the corner there—by the by, Smith, he's a devilish clever
                  fellow, is Dumas—and will put a solid wedge of dreamless, kickless, and snoreless
                  sleep between the two days. Second, I'm bound to see this grand ball match
                  to-morrow, and shall bet heavy on it. The only way to get rid of these shabby,
                  dilapidated clothes, is to win a new suit from de Lignery, who's the only
                  decently-dressed Frenchman in the fort—wonder who made that slashed undress of
                  his? the one with the frogs, I mean—and thirdly, and lastly, I'm going to give my
                  parole to Dumas to be a good boy, talk nothing but French, and make love to Miss
                  Fleury."</p>
               <p>"What!" laughed Smith, "going to call old Nymwha father, embrace Mrs. Nymwha, and
                  fish out of a bean-and-hominy pot with all the dirty, naked, little Nymwhas?"</p>
               <p>"See here, Smith! I've done my <foreign xml:lang="FRA">devoirs</foreign> to
                  Braddock in drawing him a tip-top plan of the old fort he's after; I've done my
                  duty to myself in making a first-class escape—not to speak of that confounded
                  notch—and I've done my duty to old father Nymwha, in not choking him to death
                  when, after landing our canoe, he opened on us with that horrible, sepulchral
                  laugh. Now, then, what's the use of sulking here when there's so much fun and
                  excitement outside, and when Braddock will release us in two days? I want to get
                  the run of this fort before our General gets here. I'd love to set up housekeeping
                  in that blasted old de Beaujeu's<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7175-00000139"/>
                  quarters. I'd like to do a month's fishing, and hunting, and courting about here.
                  Where would you have better, lad? and what more lovely courting material could you
                  find than Captain Pipe's sweet daughter? Blamed if she isn't the—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! but do you think, sir, Braddock will take the fort so easy? There's a
                  deal of Indians camping around, and all seem very confident hereabouts."</p>
               <p>"Look here, Jimmy! you and I'll have to quarrel, straight, if you even hint that
                  doubt again. You don't know Braddock; why, I've seen him, in Hyde Park, wheel and
                  turn and manœuvre his 'Cold Streams' in a space no bigger than a parlor floor, and
                  never a jar, or hitch, or interference—just like a well-oiled piece of machinery.
                  Why, he's confessed the best drill-master in Europe! Now, what chance will a set
                  of raw Canadians, chasseeing Frenchers, and breech-clouted savages have against
                  such veterans?—each as steady as an oak and as cool as a small iceberg! In the
                  words of the great dramatist, 'I pause for a reply;' But come! let's to sleep, and
                  early to-morrow we'll send for Dumas."</p>
               <p>So saying, the two laid them down on the robes so considerately provided for them
                  by the Captain, and were soon fast locked in slumber.</p>
               <p>Betimes the next morning, Talbot knocked away until one of the guard made his
                  appearance, grumbling at his impudence, and telling him, in a surly tone, he could
                  not have his breakfast for an hour yet.</p>
               <p>"Did you think, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">imbecile</foreign>" said Talbot, in
                  French, "that I sent for the bill of fare or for lollipops? I want to see Captain
                  Dumas, quick! By the by, aint you our old friend, Pierre Meurice? I thank you, in
                  the name of Jacques Baptiste, for allowing him his visit to the Delaware
                  girl."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mille Diables!</foreign>" snorted out Meurice, for it was
                  he; "but that was a shabby trick on a poor soldier, and you, with your 'bad cold,'
                  and your Delaware girl! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Peste!</foreign> but you've found
                  that two can play at tricks! Old Nymwha made it all even. Sacre-e-e!"</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Monsieur</foreign> Nymwha, please, Meurice, when you
                  speak of my father; but go, go! there's a good fellow, and bring Dumas here;" and
                  off went honest Pierre, muttering and swearing to himself.</p>
               <p>The Captain soon appeared with an orderly, bearing a good, warm breakfast. "Eh,
                  bien, milord Talbot. J'espère que vous avez bien reposé, hier soir."</p>
               <p>"Assez bien," replied Talbot, in the same language. "Would have liked better
                  passing the evening with your mess or Mlle. Fleury. You don't bear any ill will to
                  me, Captain, for what occurred yesterday?"</p>
               <p>"Surely not! Your plan of the fort was a good and truthful one, and if you had
                  gotten clear off, I wouldn't have shed many tears over you."</p>
               <p>"May I ask, Captain, what news from Braddock?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, milord; a party of Shawnee braves, who had a most desperate fight
                  yesterday with Jack and Scarooyaddy—that was an elegant, drowning game the cunning
                  old redskin played on us; he stands higher with all the Indian tribes about here
                  now than ever—report a small body of cavalry crossing the Monongahela ford, which
                  denotes an entire change of route on Braddock's part. We have now a large force of
                  whites and reds out watching his every step."</p>
               <p>"And so," said Talbot, "Jack and the Half-King got off after all, and I suppose
                  Gist and Fairfax?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, all; and that's not the worst of it. The former two have carried off Miss de
                  Bonneville and her father, of whom you have heard us all so often speak, and the
                  inoffensive old gentleman has been cruelly murdered by one of those cursed
                  Shawnees, but his death, from all thier accounts<pb n="270-271"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000140"/> counts, was quickly and fully avenged. That Captain
                  Jack of yours, or, as <emph>we</emph> call him, 'la Carrabine Noir,' must be a
                  very incarnate devil to fight. He don't seem to know the word <emph>fear.</emph>
                  He's a match for our La Force, whom Major Washington took as hostage. I hope,
                  milord, you haven't many like him in your army—but sit to your breakfast, and I'll
                  tell you the whole fight."</p>
               <p>After the breakfast, Dumas very willingly received their paroles, and gave them
                  again the freedom of the fort. This day was to be a grand gala day. Although the
                  news of Braddock's approach and changed route evidently created uneasiness and
                  hastened preparations, the ball-match was to go on as announced, commencing at
                  nine.</p>
               <p>The first significant sign noted by Talbot, was that a solitary gun was mounted on
                  a carriage. This, together with other minor facts, looked towards either an
                  abandonment of the position without striking a blow, or an honorable surrender
                  provided an evacuation with the honors of war could be obtained. The daily reports
                  of the size of Braddock's army—which was greatly exaggerated—and the order and
                  discipline with which every move was made, had so operated on and demoralized the
                  Indian allies, that there was little to hope in the way of successful resistance,
                  yet still a brave front was kept up, the Commandant's resolve—even if he had come
                  to any—being known to but a few of his officers.</p>
               <p>Long before the hour appointed, the whole force inside the walls had taken up
                  favorable positions on the parapets nearest the ground staked out. Here a rude,
                  board platform had been erected for better accommodation. Soon the huge gate was
                  swung open, and a number of Indian chiefs, with a few squaws and maidens entered,
                  and strode their way to the seats. Among these latter, Talbot was rejoiced to see
                  Wau-ki-na, accompanied by her grim old father, and Captain Jacob, another
                  celebrated Delaware chief.</p>

               <p>THE fresh young girl was dressed with unusual care and richness, and looked
                  exceedingly attractive, but very, very sad. Her fine, luxuriant hair, decked only
                  with a simple wreath of wild-wood flowers, was allowed to escape from the
                  gold-rimmed comb she had won at the late race, and fell in wavy masses down her
                  back, even below her waist. Her dark-blue tunic was elaborately embroidered and
                  curiously inwrought with dyed porcupine quills, and trimmed with eagle and
                  wild-pigeon feathers. Her neat-fitting, fawn-skin buskins were singularly
                  ornamented with scalps of the red-headed, wood-pecker and wild duck, wrought in
                  figures, while her leggings had a fringe made from the tail feathers of various
                  gay-colored birds, which were attached and still further set off by
                  deftly-fashioned quill work. The long silken sash, also her prize at the late
                  race, hung gracefully from her waist and completed a costume no less tasteful than
                  gaudy, and yet all seemed in thorough keeping, not only with the girl herself, but
                  with the occasion and the surroundings.</p>
               <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7175-00000141"/>
               <p>Talbot hastened forward to the brilliant young beauty, and when he called her by
                  name, and Wau-ki-na artlessly, but shyly took his proffered hand, the young
                     lord—<foreign xml:lang="FRA">blazé</foreign> as, he was in such interviews—felt
                  more embarrassed than he could have thought possible.</p>
               <p>"Why, Wau-ki-na, this is an unexpected pleasure! If that's your father—and it
                  seems to me confounded strange if it is—would like to know him."</p>
               <p>Wau-ki-na timidly plucked Pipe's robe, and gave a sort of introduction, when the
                  powerful old chief seized hold of Talbot's delicate hand, and gave it such a
                  vice-like grip and shake, that the bones almost crunched under it, and tears
                  fairly started to his eyes.</p>
               <p>"I think I'll know the chief now, Wau-ki-na. He seems like a very cordial sort of
                  a man. He must paddle a good deal in canoes. And so you have come to see the
                  ball-play?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mr. Lord; but Wau-ki-na no want to come, and no want to dress this-a-way,
                  but her father make her. Me very, very sad. Marie—she call Wau-ki-na sister
                  sometimes—gone far away, and poor old Mr. de Bonneville killed. He was a so good,
                  kind man. Oh, Miss Marie, she never happy no more—Wau-ki-na, too—no more
                  happy—want to die;" and the young girl's eyes swam with tears.</p>
               <p>"Oh, nonsense! my girl, this wont do! You'll be happy plenty, and make some other
                  chappy happy, too."</p>
               <p>"Chappy? Me no understand 'chappy.' I like no more my town and people. I don't go
                  in canoe nor water, not any more. I love only Marie and her Edward—Captain Jack me
                  mean."</p>
               <p>"Why, Wau-ki-na, Jack's a stern, proud, cross man; I never could make anything of
                  him; he's sour as vinegar, and as haughty as Lucifer."</p>
               <p>"No know Lucifer, but he no cross to Wau-ki-na, nor Marie—gentle as falling dew.
                  Me love to get near him, look in his eyes, and hear him talk. Don't know why. Me
                  wish my mother was alive. Do <emph>you</emph> like Wau-ki-na very much?" raising
                  her eyes and looking shyly, but straight at Talbot.</p>
               <p>"My God!" thought Talbot to himself, startled at the confiding simplicity of the
                  question, "wonder if she, too, takes me for a female woman; but no,
                  impossible!"</p>
               <p>"Why, you funny little puss," he laughingly replied, actually blushing at the
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">naïveté</foreign> of the question, "of course I do. Who
                  could help liking you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Wau-ki-na <emph>so</emph> glad. She like <emph>you,</emph> very much;" and
                  then, in low and confidential tones, "me don't care no more for Indian. Me like
                  white people better—and want to learn English."</p>
               <p>"You would? Well, I'd like to teach you English, and French, too, and German,
                  and—and—several other European tongues. But, come! let us get a good seat to see
                  the play. Do you think your father would want to shake hands again if I offered to
                  take you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, he no care; me go with you," and off the little couple started, meeting Mlle.
                  Fleury by the way, who, after kissing Wau-ki-na—Talbot mentally, but not entirely
                  to his own satisfaction, going through the same motions—took places with them. All
                  was now ready for the great ball-match, the preliminaries of which, as already
                  described, had been going on the whole of the preceding night. The ground had been
                  marked out right outside the great gate and along the Allegheny; "byes," or goals
                  driven at either end; all the bets made across the "betting line," and stakes
                  deposited, and the dances and invocations ended.</p>
               <p>The anxious contestants were scattered over the field awaiting the signal—four
                  hundred picked red men, divested of all clothes but their moccasins and
                  breech-clouts, which were fastened to broad bead-belts. Most of the far-western<pb
                     n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7175-00000142"/> western Indians—coming from a region
                  where horses were abundant—had each a tuft of white horse hair depending from this
                  belt, and a sort of mane of dyed hair or quills, running from between the
                  shoulders to the base of the head.</p>
               <p>Two hundred of the young, brawny fellows now strutting about the field, were
                  Ottawas and Chippewas, led on by the fierce and fiery Pontiac—the head and brains
                  in the desperate struggle which broke out a few years after, well known as
                  "Pontiac's War." The other two hundred were selected from the Delawares, Shawnees
                  and Iroquois, living about the head of the Ohio, and led by Pukeshinwa, a noted
                  Shawnee chief, and father of the afterwards famous Tecumseh.</p>
               <p>Now, two aged Sachems, ball in hand, step forward to the stake driven equi-distant
                  from the goals. The most eager and skillful players of both sides, flourishing a
                  bat in either hand like the modern "shinny stick," but with a web of thongs across
                  the curve, crowd around. The object of the players was to drive the ball through
                  their respective wickets, which scored one in the game of a hundred. No player was
                  allowed to touch the ball with anything but the netted stick. When the ball passed
                  a wicket, an interval of one minute was permitted before it was again tossed for
                  the next bout.</p>
               <p>Now the deep boom of a cannon is heard from the fort, and before its echoes are
                  returned from the surrounding hills, the ball is in the air, the mob of players
                  leap to the centre, and a desperate struggle is immediately commenced.</p>
               <p>There they go—the surging, swaying, almost naked crowds—pell-mell,
                  helter-skelter—now up, now down—now here, now there—now packed in dense, writhing,
                  desperately-struggling masses, and now scattered over the field, or leaping,
                  shouting, and giving forth sharp, shrill yelps as they rush after those who were
                  running with the ball before them.</p>
               <p>It was a wonderfully exciting scene—so many strong, supple and well-proportioned
                  athletes—active as panthers, lithe as leopards, earnest as death—all their thews
                  and muscles in full play and in open view. What a study for a sculptor! None could
                  look and remain passive, and cheer after cheer came from the fort parapets, along
                  which thronged soldiers, officers, visitors—<emph>everybody.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Talbot sat between Wau-ki-na and Mlle. Fleury, and <emph>should</emph> have been
                  as calm, and "happy as a clam at high "tide," but he wasn't, not a bit of it, but
                  kept bobbing up and down like a cork in a whirlpool, and when, at last, old
                  Pukeshinwa took the ball, and, in spite of all opposition, bravely carried it
                  through his wicket, which was almost under the fort stockade, Talbot was fairly
                  beside himself. He rose up and cheered till he almost choked, and then snatched
                  off his wig and flourished it around in so exciting a manner, that even the
                  Indians about laughed out their approval. Nymwha grinned at him like a Chesser
                  cat. The young lord subsided somewhat as he noticed old Captain Pipe coming
                  patronizingly forward with his huge bony paw extended, and looking as if he wished
                  to shake hands again with him. He then found it convenient to give Wau-ki-na a
                  lesson in English.</p>
               <p>"Do you think, my lord," proudly exclaimed Captain Dumas—the subsequent commander
                  of the fort and a brave and gallant officer—"that all those pretty fellows there
                  will quietly open the fort gates for Le General Braddock to enter?"</p>
               <p>"Eh, what! Braddock? Where is he?—Oh, now I understand. That's not the question
                  just now before the House, Captain; but what will you bet on this play? I go two
                  to one on the Ohio Indians; if Captain de Lignery<pb n="276-277"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000143"/> is there, I'll lay him a new velvet suit, if I can
                  only come at his Paris tailor. He dresses like a count."</p>
               <p>"And yet," retorted Dumas, "you're shouting yourself hoarse over those glistering
                  redskins, who don't dress at all—that is, none to speak of."</p>
               <p>To Wau-ki-na in English: "He has me there, Wau-ki-na—but I'll be even with him."
                  To Dumas in French: "Captain, I profess to be a connoisseur in fashions. Now, if I
                  were an Indian—and Nymwha there thinks I'd make a first-rate one—I might consider
                  myself dressed in a bears-clout, a necklace of bears-claws, and some streaks of
                  red paint. 'Tis not exactly full dress, you know, neither, do I think such a suit
                  would improve my appearance, that's the <emph>naked</emph> truth, yet still—"</p>
               <p>But here the cannon sounded for the second round, and at it they went again. It is
                  extraordinary the interest all tribes of Indians take—or used to take—in the game
                  of ball, and the great skill they attained in it. Matches were sometimes made
                  between whole tribes, in which there would be thousands on a side, and entire days
                  occupied before the game was concluded. All weapons were carefully left behind,
                  and when single encounters took place, which were almost constantly, even the
                  sticks were laid down, and they would wrestle or fight out their little
                  differences, and then join the throng again.</p>
               <p>Even the women had their ball-plays, the only difference being that
                     <emph>they</emph> used two balls attached to a thong, about a foot and a half
                  long, and instead of a curved stick with a web, they all held short straight
                  sticks, one in each hand, with which they would catch the string and throw the
                  ball toward their own goal. There were matches, too, between the young men and
                  women of a village, at which it was permitted the young fellows to catch the
                  squaws and wrestle for the ball. It is said, by those who have witnessed these
                  games, that the girls were more passionately sionately fond of the play than the
                  men, and in the frequent wrestles, managed often to come off victorious.</p>
               <p>The combatants of the present contest—the first flush of excitement over—now
                  settled down to their work more steadily, but occasionally there would be
                  struggles of terrific desperation and intense interest. Sometimes, at a critical
                  point of the game, and especially when the ball was on the ground, the whole field
                  of players would be gathered about it in a confused mass—pushing, wrestling,
                  scuffling, knocking their sticks together, raising up clouds of dust, never once
                  seeing the ball, but still contending for it long after it had been sent to
                  another part of the field.</p>
               <p>There were also innumerable incidents of a comical nature. Sudden collisions would
                  occur. Flying leaps would be taken over the heads and shoulders, and, as it was
                  allowable to impede an adversary in every possible way, sudden darts would be made
                  under the legs or dexterous trip-ups caused, creating personal conflicts or shouts
                  of merriment.</p>
               <p>Up to noon, the lake tribes were considerably ahead on the score, but after a
                  short interval of rest, the Ohio Indians went into the game with such earnest
                  effort and determination that they were brought nearly even with their
                  adversaries. The struggle then became terrific in its intensity and superhuman
                  effort. The feeling, too, grew deeper, and the temper more uncertain. Angry
                  exclamations, derisive shouts, and sharp conflicts occurred, not only between
                  individuals, but between whole groups, and the sport was fast becoming hot and
                  furious.</p>

               <p>FOR a prisoner, it might be considered that on this day Talbot was having rather a
                  good time. He certainly made the most of his opportunities with Wau-ki-na, who
                  seemed to be getting a stronger hold on his ardent fancy than he would have wished
                  to confess—perhaps more than he knew himself. It was very amusing to watch the
                  behavior of the two, for Mlle. Fleury, disgusted with the one-sidedness of
                  Talbot's attentions, very soon deserted him.</p>
               <p>The couple gradually tired of the play and wandered all over the fort together,
                  promenaded the parapets, gazed out upon the rivers and surrounding hills, and
                  seemed like two careless, happy children out for a day's frolic. His instructions
                  in English were very assiduous, and must have been at times amusing, judging from
                  the little melodious ripples of laughter that came from her lips.</p>
               <p>The shyness and sadness of the young woodland beauty gradually wore away, and she
                  became more engaging and communicative. Even her broken English and queer
                  pronunciation pleased. Talbot soon knew all about her relations with Jack and
                  Marie; about her home, her companions, her duties and enjoyments, and was
                  infinitely amused at the simplicity and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">naïveté</foreign>
                  of her remarks, going off a step or two and looking at her, and then laughingly
                  approaching again, as if he never had in all his life seen just such an odd,
                  taking little witch.</p>
               <p>Once, when standing by the big gate and looking up the Allegheny, Talbot said:
                  "And Shannopin, where you live, is just around yonder point, is it,
                  Wau-ki-na?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and much pretty place. You come soon and see Wau-ki-na. She live in woods
                  and on the water. She show you where be all the pretty flowers; where the bees
                  hide their honey; where you find many birds; you teach me Marie's talk, I teach
                  you how to paddle canoe, and shoot, and fish, and dance, and swim."</p>
               <p>"Why you must lead an idle, merry, vagabondish life, Ki-na. Play all day; no work,
                  no trouble, no lessons."</p>
               <p>The girl's countenance changed.</p>
               <p>"Yes, much trouble sometimes. When snow comes, wigwam cold and wet, fish no
                  plenty, birds, deer and bear sometime all go away, and—"sinking her voice to a
                  lower key—"Indians drink pale-face 'fire-water,' and fight and scold much. That
                  make Wau-ki-na pretty much sad—make her fall tears. Old squaws very cross—winter
                  not good time for Ki-na; she like summer and the woods much as the birds."</p>
               <p>"And is your father ever very cross to you, dainty little maiden?"</p>
               <p>"No—yes—not so much. When he get fire-water, or when Ki-na very bad; you mustn't,"
                  looking reproachfully at her companion, "ask such tings—come, see?"</p>
               <p>"Well, to be sure I will, when I get to be Nymwha's son. Did you know, Ki-na, I
                  was going to turn Indian? What kind of a chief do you think <emph>I'd</emph>
                  make?" taking a<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7175-00000145"/> position and drawing
                  himself up as tall, and looking as fierce as possible.</p>
               <p>This brought out a musical little laugh and a merry twinkle of the eye not
                  altogether pleasant to the little Lord.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you make so funny Indian. Your hair's too much, skin too white, hands too
                  little, little, and you not high enough. When you hunt deer and eat much venison,
                  you grow, oh, so big," putting her tawny little hand above Talbot's head. "You
                  make very nice Indian girl, though."</p>
               <p>"What! you tormenting little minx," hastily exclaimed her mortified companion.
                  "That's not nice of you: mustn't talk that foolish way. Come! let's go and watch
                  the play."</p>
               <p>Talbot sat quiet and with averted face so long, and seemed so desperately intent
                  on the game, that Wau-ki-na finally touched his hand, timidly glanced up into his
                  face with a very droll, coquettish look, in which shyness and merriment were about
                  equally mingled, and whispered:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Lord, Wau-ki-na am mistook. She think you be great big chief like my father;
                  make all the braves tremble."</p>
               <p>"Oh, girl, that wont do; comes too late, and's too much on t'other side. I'm very,
                  very angry," and he stayed angry for at least—five minutes.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the game had gone on with varying fortune, but with increased feeling
                  and even bitterness, until about five of the evening, when a dispute suddenly
                  arose about the ball being carried by one of the Ohio Indians through the wicket,
                  and which the fierce Pontiac charged was unfair and contrary to rule. There was
                  immediate commotion and great clamor. The hot blood was up on both sides, and a
                  war of angry words ensued, followed by many encounters in different parts of the
                  field.</p>
               <p>Finally, an Ottawa was unfortunately felled with one of the bats, when, with a cry
                  of terrible rage and with shrill whoops, the lake Indians, with one accord, rushed
                  to the woods where the arms were piled under guard.</p>
               <p>The other side, too, made a rush for <emph>their</emph> weapons, and both parties,
                  violently thrusting aside the guards, seized knives and tomahawks, brandished them
                  fiercely about their heads, and with great leaps and yells and terrible whoops,
                  were just about rushing to the deadly encounter, when all at once, the great gun
                  of the fort boomed out its reverberating roar; the massive log gate was let down
                  to make the drawbridge, and a company of armed soldiers, accompanied by de Beaujeu
                  and the other officers and numerous Indian chiefs, poured out upon the plain.</p>
               <p>At the same time two Indian couriers, almost spent with running and covered with
                  sweat, were seen to issue from the woods, at foot of the eminence which is now
                  called "Grant's hill," and to make rapidly across the interval. There was an
                  immediate hush of all the clamor. The Indians on both sides stood with sullen,
                  dogged, vindictive looks, as if transfixed into statues. The runners stopped not
                  until along side of de Beaujeu and Athanase, the christianized Cauhnewaga from
                  Quebec and the recognized leader of all the Indian forces with the French. To them
                  they hurriedly delivered their message, which it was evident to all was one of
                  great moment.</p>
               <p>Now de Beaujeu advances, and a brief but earnest discussion follows. Curiosity on
                  the part of all on-lookers begins to take the place of rage and hate. The weapons
                  drop to the side, the countenances soften, and all eyes are anxiously bent on the
                  runners. At last, Commandant de Beaujeu, who was very much beloved by the savages,
                  and who exercised over them a powerful influence, strode forward with dignity,
                  accompanied by Athanase. The thousand Indians from so many different warlike
                  tribes, and who were but just now prepared to hack each other to<pb n="282-283"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000146"/> pieces, crowd around in a semicircle, the various
                  chiefs a few steps in advance.</p>
               <p>Then the old Athanase, gathering up his robe and stretching out his arm for
                  silence, commenced:</p>
               <p>"Shame! shame! Sachems and warriors—must the sons of Onontio turn themselves into
                  foolish children? Must they, like maddened wolves, fight, rend, and devour each
                  other over a few naked bones? The Great Spirit will be angry and turn forever from
                  his children, if it is thus they make haste to offend him. You are gathered here
                  from many different tribes and by many different roads—from the great western
                  waters and from the big rivers, and for what?—to snarl and quarrel among
                  yourselves? or to fight and drive back a common foe?—one who has dug up the
                  hatchet against you; who would sweep you from your hunting grounds; who would
                  steal away your head and strength with strong waters, and who would drive you and
                  your families from the graves of their ancestors!</p>
               <p>"Look you here, brothers!" pointing to the two runners who, jaded and panting,
                  were standing a step or two in the rear; "where think you do these come from, and
                  what message do they bring? The proud, pale-face general, with a great army from
                  beyond the sea, is now coming into your grounds, among your own woods and wigwams,
                  to kill and burn and destroy. Coming, did I say? <emph>He is now almost
                     here.</emph> These two have seen him but a few brief hours ago. They have made
                  haste to tell you that you might know what to do."</p>
               <p>This announcement created a great sensation among the listeners. All animosity
                  against each other vanished on the instant, and the chiefs commenced discussing
                  the matter in low tones.</p>
               <p>Athanase resumed: "Brothers, there is no time left now to smoke and talk. Your
                  braves have followed this army every step from Cucucbutuc (Cumberland). You know
                  its size, its leader, how many big cannon come with it. You have taken some, and
                  killed and scalped others of its braves. General Braddock is changing his course.
                  He now comes by the Monongahela fords and crosses at the Tulpewi Sipu (Turtle
                  Creek). When the sun stood in mid-sky this very day, he was preparing for the
                  march. To-morrow's noon will see him at the Tulpewi Sipu, and the next sun will
                  see him before that big gun house.</p>
               <p>"'Tis for you to say whether he shall enter it and drive you across the Ohio, or
                  whether all these western tribes will scatter his warriors and drive him back over
                  the mountains whence he came. I, and my Caughnewagas, have come all the way from
                  Canada to help you do this. The Ottawas, Chippewas, and Pottowatomies from the
                  lakes, will also go on the war-path with you."</p>
               <p>Beaujeu, who thoroughly understood the Indian language and character, followed to
                  the same effect, artfully and eloquently depicting the dreadful effects which
                  would follow if the English were once allowed to get a lodgment in the Ohio
                  country; reciting the wrongs they had already suffered; how the Six Nations,
                  living at a great distance and assuming to be their masters, had been bought or
                  persuaded in their cups to sell tract after tract of western land; how English and
                  Irish traders had come among them, to first make them drunk, and then cheat them
                  out of their skins, debauch their women, and deprive them of their hunting
                  grounds. He then endeavored to show them that the French were their friends; that
                  they lived, hunted, and married with them without wanting their lands, and that
                  they had been as prodigal of their gifts as the English had been stingy, etc.,
                  etc.</p>
               <p>The plausible Beaujeu used every art and device of rhetoric to influence their
                  minds and lead captive their judgment, but he only partially succeeded. None knew
                     better<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7175-00000147"/> than these experienced
                  chiefs, the size, discipline, and complete appointments of Braddock's army, whose
                  numbers they, however, greatly exaggerated. They knew well, also, the small French
                  force at the fort and very much doubted their ability to make a successful stand.
                  Very many of them, too, were tired with the long waiting, and were ready, at the
                  first pretext, to break with their allies. When Beaujeu had concluded, therefore,
                  they broke up into little knots, and discussed the whole matter with warmth and
                  earnestness. Finally King Beaver, of the Delawares, speaking the general sense,
                  made brief reply:</p>
               <p>"Our ears have been open, my Father, to what you had to say. It has entered deep
                  into our hearts, and we wish to turn it round and round. We <emph>do</emph> know
                  all about this great army of 'pale-faces' which is coming into our grounds. Most
                  of us used to be friends with them, and you, my Father, have done all you could to
                  blow up a great cloud between us. We are not certain that you mean better to us
                  than they. If <emph>they</emph> claim the lands west of the Alleghenies, and
                     <emph>you</emph> claim them also, where, pray, do the Indian lands lay? Are you
                  so bent on destruction that you can ask us to go out with one thousand against
                  four thousand warriors? Would you sacrifice us to save your big gun house? Truly,
                  this is not the saying of a wise man. But we will treasure up all that we have now
                  heard, and to-morrow you shall know all our thoughts."</p>
               <p>Beaujeu vehemently tried to persuade them to change their purpose, arguing that if
                  resistance was to be made, steps must be taken <emph>that very night,</emph> but
                  all to no effect. They answered it was too important a matter to be decided
                  hastily, and they would hold a grand council on it.</p>

               <p>THE game was virtually over; for, although renewed, its spirit was gone, and a
                  "draw" was announced. The usual keg of rum was distributed among the players, but
                  the late misunderstanding had caused a shock, a stiffness, a soreness, which
                  prevented further cordiality. The visitors inside the fort soon took their leave,
                  Talbot accompanying Wau-ki-na to the very gate, and whispering, as he pressed her
                  wee hand: "Good-bye, my winsome little gypsy, we'll meet again. I have much yet to
                  tell you, and soon." He would have said more, had not her father just then turned
                  and offered his hand for a farewell grip, but Talbot had vanished; he would as
                  soon have inserted his digits in a steel-trap.</p>
               <p>All the Sachems and leading chiefs held a grand "powwow" that night under the
                  trees. Their discussion was protracted, and at times, exceedingly earnest.
                  Pontiac, Athanase, old King Shingiss, and lastly, Blackhoof, smarting under the
                  severe punishment lately administered to<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7175-00000148"
                  /> him by Jack, spoke briefly but hotly in favor of an attack on the English,
                  regardless of numbers: but then followed the more temperate and dignified
                  utterances of Killbuck, Kateuskund, King Beaver, and other old Sachems and warlike
                  leaders of weight and influence. These had lately been estranged from the English;
                  would have been, had they been more adroitly managed, still their allies, and had
                  more to dread, in case of defeat, than the lake and Canada tribes. (See <hi
                     rend="i"/>Appendix U.)</p>
               <p>Prudence and interest at length got the better of valor and hate, and it was
                  finally resolved that it would be madness to think of resisting Braddock's army
                  with their small numbers, and that so the Commandant should be informed. The
                  council then broke up, and all was stillness.</p>
               <p>Beaujeu passed an anxious night. He was a man of great nerve and of prompt action,
                  and had for some days back been fearing some such <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >dénouement</foreign> as this. He had watched the Indians closely; had sought
                  out their chiefs for private interviews, at which he employed all his art and
                  ability, but was forced to acknowledge that notwithstanding all the prodigal means
                  used to assemble and hold firm his red allies, they were liable to fail him at the
                  last moment.</p>
               <p>Much, then, depended on the resolve of the Grand Council; and early the next day
                  Beaujeu issued out alone to know the result. He soon met King Shingiss and
                  Beaver.</p>
               <p>"My children are astir betimes. They have had much wise talk together. What do the
                  great war chiefs say? Will they aid us with their braves to drive Braddock and his
                  dogs into the Monongahela, and make it red with their blood?"</p>
               <p>"Our Father," said old Beaver, "is not wise to ask us to do this thing. He would
                  sacrifice us to save his gun house, which is on our ground, and which we have
                  'warned off' many times. We are sorry, but Onontio must fight his own battles; we
                  cannot aid him."</p>
               <p>This was a terrible, though as we have premised, not an entirely unexpected stroke
                  to Beaujeu. He saw that the capture of Duquesne would be a death blow to French
                  dominion west of the mountains. If they could not stand there, they could stand
                  nowhere. Vast sums and great effort had been spent in collecting and holding
                  together these Indian bands, gathered from far and near, and now here was the fair
                  fabric he had been so patiently and laboriously building, all tumbled into ruins
                  about his feet. The mortified officer flushed up with indignation, and bit his
                  lips with anger. He scarce could trust himself to speak; at last, schooling his
                  voice, he simply and with great dignity, said:</p>
               <p>"And this is the voice of the council? 'Tis well. 'Tis better to be deserted here
                  than in the midst of battle. Onontio did not expect this of his beloved children.
                  The time for repentance will come speedily, and punishment will be swift and
                  overwhelming. I know we can beat back this proud and indolent General. We will
                  fight him at the river's crossing, where one will be equal to twenty. And will you
                  let your Father go out alone?" he concluded, sadly.</p>
               <p>Beaujeu had, as we have said, great influence with the savages, by all of whom he
                  was much beloved. He managed them with exceeding adroitness, and his words now
                  caused the chiefs to waver. After consulting together, the fiery old King Shingiss
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Shingiss and his Delawares will go with you if 'tis an ambush you seek. You would
                  be mad to try a great battle—one against three. 'Tis, as you know, against Indian
                  law and custom to join open battle with superior numbers, but if you choose your
                  ground and lay an ambush, or will<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7175-00000149"/> fight
                  them at the ford, all the chiefs will join you, and I speak for them."</p>
               <p>"Enough! 'tis all I ask!" joyfully exclaimed the Frenchman. "You'll see that we
                  will, we <emph>must</emph> triumph! You know how these Swannocks are
                  marching—crowded together in the woods like pigeons. Your rifles will shoot down
                  the leaders, and the rest and all the vast stores of booty are yours, to do with
                  as you please. Pick out your best chiefs, and we'll select the ground this very
                  day."</p>
               <p>An hour later, Pontiac, Killbuck, and Shingiss disappeared in the woods in company
                  with Beaujeu, Dumas, and Langlade, gone to select the spot most favorable for
                  coping with Braddock's army. They did not reappear until late in the afternoon,
                  having found the locality they desired, and now both fort and woods were alive
                  with preparations. The Indians made the whole night hideous with their revels and
                  orgies. "Fire-water" had been freely distributed, and the "medicine" men were out
                  in force, with their dances and sacrifices and incantations.</p>
               <p>The next day, which was the dread day of battle, as Talbot and Smith stood on the
                  parapets, they witnessed a strange and stirring sight, both inside and outside the
                  fort. Hundreds of whooping and yelling Indians were gathered about the great gate,
                  their scalp-locks all dressed anew; their faces hideously streaked with fresh
                  paint; every garment thrown off but the breech-clout, and all busily helping
                  themselves at will with flints, bullets, powder, buckshot, and what not, from
                  barrels which had been rolled out of the fort. Those inside were just as busy.</p>
               <p>At about 11 o'clock everything was ready for the march, and off they started;
                  Beaujeu—who had first gone piously to confession, and then to communion—leading
                  off with his regulars and Canadians and cadets in front, and followed by a motley
                  mob of yelling and leaping red devils, who fired off their guns, and gave out
                  whoop after whoop until they were lost in the woods towards the hill.</p>
               <p>Both Talbot and Smith nearly agreed in their count making about 75 regulars, 150
                  Canadians, and 630 Indians.</p>
               <p>An awful silence—a silence that could almost be felt—followed, and the two
                  captives sat, quiet and subdued, speculating on their own fate, and the chances of
                  the battle about to ensue, but both quite confident of victory. How could it be
                  otherwise?</p>

               <p>BEHOLD, now, Braddock's joyful little army—after having safely made, a short half
                  mile below Turtle Creek, the second fording of the Monongahela—all snugly gathered
                  on the first bluff and under the grateful shadow of an open walnut grove, hard by
                  Frazier's cabin.</p>
               <p>It was a stirring and exciting scene. Soldiers, officers, artillery, wagons,
                  pack-horses with their batmen, camp servants, and a drove of cattle, all crowded
                  together, and gradually but noisily falling into the rough road cut for them
                  through the timber by the pioneers and carpenters.</p>
               <p>The landing had scarcely been effected, before the Fraziers and Marie de
                  Bonneville—escorted by the two inseparables, Jack and the Half-King—made for the
                  little cabin which had so lately been the scene of such a bloody and heroic
                  struggle. They found the premises undisturbed. All its contents, including Marie's
                  precious packages of specimens and portfolios of drawings, remained just as
                  left.</p>
               <p>The sorrow-laden daughter soon passed to the margin of the wood, where all that
                  was mortal of her dear father had been so hastily buried. The sacred spot,
                  carefully as had been the effort made to conceal its every mark and trace, could
                  not long have escaped the practised eye of Indians, but it, too, was safe from all
                  profane touch. Either their kind feelings toward the old naturalist, their belief
                  in his visitation from the Great Spirit, or the influence of the French officers,
                  had secured the body from all sacrilege, and the weeping Marie, the sounds of fife
                  and drum and the confused tumult of an army on the march filling her ears, sat
                  herself sadly and wearily down on this, to her the most sacred spot on earth.</p>
               <p>Here Jack, whose work was in the very van of the march, left her, charging her on
                  no account to leave her post, and promising his escort as soon as the army had
                  mounted the first hills. He, no more than any of us poor, short-sighted mortals,
                  could forecast the future.</p>
               <p>It was now past one o'clock of a sultry afternoon. The rear guard had not entirely
                  crossed the river, before the van had been pushed forward towards the hills; Gage,
                  with his three hundred videttes, engineers, light-horse, and pioneers in front,
                  followed at a little interval by Sir John St. Clair's working party, with its two
                  brass six-pounders, and its tumbrils and tool carts. Their business it was to cut
                  and prepare the road marked out for them by the engineers.</p>
               <p>The march was to continue until three, and then the last bivouac before resting in
                  Fort Duquesne, or, at least, before encamping down about it. On either flank of
                  the advance were thrown out squads of videttes, to guard against surprise.</p>
               <p>The distant sound of the ringing axe, and the crash of<pb n="292-293"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000151"/> falling trees, could be distinctly heard as the
                  pioneers rapidly advanced—first over the broad and gently-rising river bottom, and
                  then up the slope which led to another gradually-ascending plain, which, in its
                  turn, rested against a line of bold, wooded hills. This second alluvial slope was
                  more heavily timbered than the flat below, while the undergrowth of vine, thicket,
                  and tall wood grass became at every step more abundant and luxuriant.</p>
               <p>Adown this second sloping plain—although at that time, and not until long after
                  known to or even suspected by the British—ran several ravines nearly at right
                  angles to the brow of the hill which the advance had just surmounted. From one on
                  the left trickled a little stream, which as it debouched into the first bottom,
                  lost all distinctive channel, and was so diffused as to cause a sort of marsh. It
                  was to avoid the treacherous footing of this miry bog, and to pass the head of the
                  ravine which gave it birth, that the army was mounting so far towards the
                  hill-sides.</p>
               <p>The ravine on the extreme right, which sprang from the hills and traversed the
                  whole second plain, was both broad and deep, its sides and bottom thickly covered
                  with huge trees, and having an unusually rampant growth of vines and brambles, and
                  sufficiently ample to conceal an army of ten thousand men.</p>
               <p>About two hundred yards from the line of hills and the same distance from the
                  broad ravine just mentioned, commences, right in the middle of the plain, and
                  without any apparent <foreign xml:lang="FRA">raison d'être,</foreign> a most
                  singular ditch, with a depth and breadth of a few feet at its head, but increasing
                  soon to ten or twelve, and at that time overhung and completely concealed by a
                  thick growth of vines and bushes; of grasses and trailers and the wild Indian
                  plum. Even to this day it can scarcely be perceived, or, at least, its full
                  capacity cannot be fully appreciated until one is right upon and then
                     <emph>in</emph> it. It is a most peculiar ditch, and could not be better
                  adapted, either for attack or defence, were engineers to devise and fashion it. It
                  could easily conceal a thousand men.</p>
               <p>The main place of action was on the densely-wooded tract between these two
                  ravines, with its fallen trunks, its coverts and thickets of vines and brush and
                  grass. The course of the twelve-foot wide road cut through these leafy coverts,
                  was not parallel with either, but diagonal and turning the head of the last
                  described ravine at an angle of about forty-five degrees, the whole face and
                  flanks of the passing army being exposed to a long line of the enemy's fire at an
                     <emph>average</emph> distance of sixty or seventy yards.</p>
               <p>This then was the spot so carefully reconnoitred and so admirably chosen by the
                  six officers and Indian chiefs, whose departure from the fort we described in our
                  last. Here was the slaughter-pen they had so adroitly marked out for their foes.
                  When, or if, beaten by their adversaries at the river crossing, it was to this
                  refuge they would retire, and here would they prepare their ambush.</p>
               <p>Not a man or officer of the British army ever dreamed of these ravines, and never
                  saw them during the three hours of combat, and it was only long after the
                  disastrous action, when reason resumed its sway, and the beaten, driven mob of
                  fugitives considered how pitilessly they were pelted and mown down by a terrible
                  but unseen <foreign xml:lang="FRA">feu d'enfer,</foreign> they concluded their
                  wily foe <emph>must</emph> have fired from hidden ravines.</p>
               <p>Pass over these quiet, peaceful "fields" now, as we have but lately done, part of
                  them in grass and part staked out and soon to be occupied by the country seats of
                  Pittsburgh business men, and then imagine them covered with a sombre and luxuriant
                  forest, the ravines choked with vines and brush and under-growth, and the long
                  rows of deadly rifles resting on their edges and deliberately sighted by hundreds
                  of naked savages, and then see the narrow road<pb n="294-295"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000152"/> choked up with an unsheltered crowd of soldiers and
                  mounted officers, and Braddock's defeat is easily accounted for.</p>
               <p>Had the French hunted for days, or had their engineers the privilege of selecting
                  a ground for successful combat and arranging artificial ditches for attack and
                  concealment, they could not have found or prepared any place better fitted for a
                  dreadful and successful assault, or one which could so easily have protected the
                  assailants.</p>
               <p>As Braddock and his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">aide</foreign> Washington—still weak
                  and shattered from his fever and unable to sit his horse without a pillow—were
                  standing on the river's bluff, trying to bring order out of confusion, and to
                  separate the noisy mob of soldiers, wagoners, artillery and cattle, the clear ring
                  of the distant axe was suddenly exchanged for the rapid and continuous discharge
                  of firearms. The crack of rifle, followed by the roll of musketry, appeared to be
                  incessant.</p>
               <p>"My God, Major!" cried Braddock, as he leaped to his horse, whose bridle his
                  servant Bishop was holding near him, "the advance is attacked, and sharply, too!
                  What can it mean? Mount on the instant, and bring me back a report of what's going
                  on! Tell St. Clair and Gage to throw well out their flankers! and urge Burton, as
                  you pass, to hurry forward with the vanguard, while I get the artillery in motion.
                  Here! you infernal scoundrels of wagoners and cattle-drivers, get you out of the
                  road with your rubbish into the woods on either side, and let the troops and guns
                  press on! Quick step! Don't dally!"</p>
               <p>Washington delayed not an instant, but springing upon his powerful roan, spurred
                  along under the trees and by the side of the road now choked up with artillery and
                  soldiers, all pressing forward with utmost speed and excitement. He soon reached
                  the first slope; a few strides and his horse was over its brow and on the plain
                  beyond. The firing was now straight ahead of him. Officers and men stood huddled
                  in groups in the road; some few had taken to the trees on either side. The two
                  brass pieces had just been unlimbered and the cannoneers were preparing to apply
                  the match. The attack had evidently been sudden and unexpected, and Washington now
                  saw Gage's advance doubled back upon St. Clair's working party, and for a brief
                  space all was confusion.</p>

               <p>NOTHING could be seen in front but the flashes of the enemy's guns and the shadowy
                  forms here and there of French and Indians as they glided from tree to tree;
                  nothing heard but the crack of rifles, the noise of muskets, the piercing yells
                  and whoops of the savages, who seemed to fill the woods and to be working around
                  in a semicircle.</p>
               <p>"Ho! Sir John," exclaimed Washington, as St. Clair foaming with rage and mad with
                  excitement approached to form and urge on the men. "What's all this? The General
                  bids you halt where you are; throw your flankers well out, and hold your own—if
                  hotly pressed—until Burton comes up. What's the nature of the attack?"</p>
               <p>"Fierce as furnace fire and hot as d——n," answered the fiery Sir John. "Harry
                  Gordon was in the very front marking out the road when, upon hearing a rushing
                  noise ahead and looking through the trees, he saw a pack of French and Indians on
                  the run, a gaily-dressed officer, with a silver gorget on his bosom, leading the
                  way with long kangaroo leaps. Soon as they got within musket shot, the cursed
                  Frencher stopped short in his tracks, and waving his plumed hat above his head and
                  then stretching his arms to either side, his pack of red devils scattered to right
                  and left, crouched down and slunk away behind trees, trunks, and what-not, until,
                  by heavens, they had completely vanished—not a painted head or hide of one of them
                  to be seen—the skulking cowards! The first we knew, a pitiless hail of bullets
                  rained upon us, amid the most horrible screeches and yells and infernal noises
                  sure ever mortal heard. I'm blessed, Major, if I'm used to this kind of
                  fightin—don't know what to make of it. Our flankers have all run in, and the
                  carpenters, or what's left of them, are huddled down the road like so many sheep
                  worried by wolves, and the troops are fairly appalled by these screeching demons.
                  For God's sake, hurry old Braddock up! tell him we've got the whole French-Indian
                  army in our front, and will have to fight our way to the fort step by step."</p>
               <p>Washington, after a few more brief, rapid questions, took in the whole situation
                  and turned his horse's head. He had gone but a few steps when he saw Jack and the
                  Half-King a few yards on one side of the road, each peering from behind his tree
                  and trying to catch sight of something to shoot at.</p>
               <p>"Halloo! Jack and Scarooyaddy. <emph>You</emph> there, my braves? Where are the
                  other Indians? They must scatter in the woods and try and find out where those
                  devils are hiding and what's their force. I'll have Braddock here in a flash."
                  Just then a crack was heard and a bullet whizzed by, going through and through the
                  lappel of Washington's coat.</p>
               <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7175-00000154"/>
               <p>"Aha! Major," cried Jack quick as thought, as he raised and fired his rifle,
                  "that's just the chance I've been waiting for, I've watched that skulking Shawnee
                  now for over a minute. I knew he wouldn't let you pass without a shot. That's
                  their game, the cunning varmints. Pick off the mounted leaders, and the rest
                  comes, of course. Don't stay to see where I hit him, Major. Old 'Black Rifle' is
                  certain as death. Hurry up the troops! we'll need 'em all, for the savages are in
                  full feather in front; if there's one, there's a thousand, twisting and creeping
                  and gliding about among those trunks. Halloo! there's Yaddy's rifle. Hit him
                  again, by Jupiter, and a Frencher, too! No bark without its bite is the plan we're
                  acting on."</p>
               <p>Washington had not far to go. Braddock, finding the uproar not only continuing but
                  even increasing in front, had raged through the whole army like mad, and could not
                  wait for his aid's report. Ordering Burton to detach eight hundred men and hurry
                  forward with all possible speed, he left Sir Peter Halket in the rear with full
                  four hundred to protect the baggage. He then swore and stormed along the whole
                  artillery line, and pushed the guns forward as fast as possible.</p>
               <p>Washington met the General, his eyes fairly aflame and with spurs buried deep into
                  his horse's sides, right on the brow of the hill. Gage's cannon at that moment had
                  just filled the woods with their resounding roar, which was followed with cheer
                  after cheer from the British, who were standing in a confused crowd in the middle
                  and on the sides of the road, loading and firing as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>The terrible, leaden hail, which had been so steadily raining on the English and
                  shattering their columns, now slackened for a while. The British then advanced on
                  the French in front, pouring in a hot fire, though very few of the enemy could be
                  seen. As they drew near, another staggering discharge met them, appearing to come,
                  as it were, right out of the ground.</p>
               <p>The British rallied again, and opened a dreadful storm of grape and musketry,
                  sweeping away everything living before them, but the grievous misfortune was, that
                  about the <emph>only</emph> living things were the trees of the woods. Beaujeu,
                  the chief leader of the foe, and several others, were seen to fall, while the
                  Indians, unaccustomed to the appalling roar of artillery and the loud huzzas of
                  the soldiery, appeared to waver, and for the moment gave way. A well-pushed
                  bayonet charge just then would have put them to remediless flight.</p>
               <p>Observing, however, that the French and Canadians still held their ground in the
                  direct front; much exasperated by the fall of their loved Beaujeu, and urged on to
                  revenge by Dumas, Langlade and de Lignery, they took fresh heart, and returned to
                  their trees and ravines, through and along which they extended more and more.</p>
               <p>It was just at this critical moment that Braddock's horse leaped into the road,
                  and, struck instantly by a bullet in front, fell on the very leap, throwing the
                  General violently to the ground. The grim and infuriated old warrior staggered to
                  his feet, sword in hand, and glared around like a lioness robbed of her whelps.
                  His eyes fairly shot flames, and his face grew livid with rage as he saw his
                  carefully-drilled veterans standing in groups and without order, all appearing to
                  fire at random, while many were shooting into the trees above them, as if their
                  foes were birds in the branches.</p>
               <p>To increase his disgustful rage, just at this moment Gage's advance gave way
                  entirely. The unseen enemy had worked themselves along the ravines on both flanks,
                  and, from behind the dense undergrowth and tall grass which fringed them, poured
                  in a most galling fire, coolly and securely picking off officer after officer.</p>
               <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7175-00000155"/>
               <p>Colonel Burton's command had just come upon the ground, and were forming, as well
                  as could be under such a murderous hail of lead and in such a narrow road, when
                  crowding down upon them came Gage's and St. Clair's shattered columns trying to
                  get into their rear, and mixing the two regiments in inextricable confusion.</p>
               <p>Then it was that Braddock stormed around with a rage and an indignation which was
                  almost sublime from its intensity. Turning sharply on Gage:</p>
               <p>"How's this, craven sir! would ye so basely dishonor your king and the duke? God's
                  wrath! is <emph>this</emph> the way ye've been taught to fight! By the Eternal,
                  but I'll break your disgraced sword where you sit in saddle! Curses on you all for
                  a set of white-livered cowards! You look more like a flock of silly sheep set on
                  by hounds than drilled soldiers. For shame! for shame! Fall in ranks, every
                  mother's son of you, and come out from behind those trees! By the great God above
                  us, men, but I'll cut down with my sword the first soldier, British or American,
                  who <emph>dare</emph> skulk behind a cover! Out with you, cowards!" and suiting
                  the action to the word, Braddock leaped to the road side and actually hit with the
                  flat of his sword several whom he found behind the trees, while others he pushed
                  into the road.</p>
               <p>"General," sullenly expostulated Gage, "these insults are undeserved. We can't
                  fight a deadly foe who surrounds us on three sides but whom we can't see. The
                  officers are falling like leaves all about you. The men are plainly
                  panic-stricken. If allowed to get behind whatever cover offers, they can pick up
                  heart and reform when the enemy is found. If not, we'll all be killed, officers
                  and men."</p>
               <p>"Killed!" hoarsely roared Braddock, while mounting his second horse. "And why not?
                  Better die with naked front to the foe than blink and skulk like hares in their
                  'forms.' Get behind trees! Oh, that ever I'd live to hear a British officer and a
                  nobleman's son, too, give voice to such dastard words! Officers, I command you to
                  separate yon frightened mob! Advance the regimental colors! Set up rallying
                  points! Tell the men off into platoons, and hunt up the enemy in that way! Major
                  Washington, bid the rest of the artillery advance and open with grape!"</p>
               <p>The word had scarce left his lips, before his second horse was laid low with a
                  bullet, and Braddock was again on his feet in the road, which did not go far to
                  improve his temper. Here Washington ventured to observe, quietly and in low tones:
                  "General, since the enemy's evidently in great strength ahead and on each flank,
                  would it not be well to find out exactly where he is, and how he manages to so
                  hide himself? If we could retire the troops a little out of fire, beat up these
                  woods with the bayonet, and reform—"</p>
               <p>"Retire! retire out of fire, and before a d—d dastardly foe who dare not uncover
                  himself!" shouted Braddock. "Major Washington, you are my aide-de-camp to
                     <emph>carry</emph> orders, not to <emph>give</emph> them! <emph>Retire</emph>
                  is a round, well-picked word! It may suit your American militia, but, sir, it is a
                  disgraceful word for an officer holding his Majesty's commission, either to speak
                  or to hear! It was by <emph>retiring,</emph> as you well call it, that Forts
                  Duquesne and Necessity were given up by you last year to the French! Damme, sir,
                  it has been so much retiring that brings me and my army on this field! Here,
                  orderly, bring me another mount!"</p>
               <p>Washington's pale face flushed up with indignation at this stinging, but totally
                  undeserved taunt, the more galling since Braddock had repeatedly given his
                  approval of the '54 campaign. Seeing the General's obstinate temper, and knowing
                  he had no right to offer advice, he put spurs to his house and was soon over the
                  hill to hurry up the artillery.</p>
               <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7175-00000156"/>
               <p>"That's right, officers!" hoarsely shouted Braddock, soon as he was again mounted.
                  "Tell off your men into small parties, advance on a double-quick, and drive those
                  d—d skulking vagabonds from their hiding places!"</p>
               <p>It was useless. By this time the confident and whooping savages had enveloped both
                  flanks, while a most galling concentric fire was poured in upon the panic-stricken
                  army, which was particularly severe upon the officers.</p>
               <p>In vain these officers, with unparalleled bravery, put themselves repeatedly at
                  the head of small parties and advanced with cheers upon the hidden foe.
                  Distinguished by their horses and uniforms, they were simply sacrificed.</p>
               <p>In the dark and narrow road, surrounded on all sides by gloomy trees and dense
                  thickets, were crowded close together the panic-stricken wretches, appalled at the
                  fatal fires of foes whom they never saw. Many fired away into the air; many more
                  brought down their own men.</p>
               <p>Wherever a puff of smoke was seen, off went the soldiers' muskets; while all
                  around, securely hidden in those mysterious, unsuspected ravines, lay a
                  screeching, murderous, insatiate foe, their rifles or muskets loaded with both
                  bullet and buckshot, peering through grass and bushes, resting them on the brinks,
                  gathering more and more confidence with each fatal volley, and making the forest
                  echo with demoniac yells and whoops and savage clamor.</p>
               <p>Occasionally a naked and hideously-painted savage would break from cover, and rush
                  forward with fearful screech, to secure the scalp of some officer he had shot.
                  Then would follow a volley of musketry from the poor soldiers, killing or wounding
                  their own fellows more than damaging the enemy.</p>

               <p>WHAT followed deserves not the name of battle; it was simply a horrible slaughter.
                  Once Colonel Burton managed to gather a hundred men and advanced towards a rising
                  ground in front, the very centre of the French position, but upon his being
                  disabled by a rifle ball, the rest retired precipitately.</p>
               <p>By this time Sir Peter Halket came up with reinforcements, but too late for good.
                  The men were hopelessly disordered and panic-stricken, firing off all their
                  ammunition, quarrelling with their brave officers, who threw themselves from their
                  horses and led them repeatedly on foot, but only to be swept into eternity.</p>
               <p>The only thing for Braddock to do when he found himself caught in this horrid
                  slaughter-pen, was, manifestly, to<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7175-00000157"/>
                  retire his forces while he had them yet under control; throw out scouting parties
                  to beat up the enemy's position; bring up his artillery to the ends of the ravines
                  and thoroughly rake them with grape and canister, or to rout out the
                  securely-hidden foe with the bayonet. Indians have never yet been found able to
                  withstand a bayonet charge. The cold steel at close quarters demoralizes. They
                  quiver, break and fly.</p>
               <p>This was what both Halket and Washington urged him to do, but to no purpose. He
                  raged along the road like a fury; drove back his men by the sword and seemed
                  determined to overcome by mere force of drill and obstinacy. Indeed, it is
                  uncertain whether he now could have executed the manœuvre. No soldiers—not even
                  Cumberland's veterans—could long withstand a deadly and concentred fire from front
                  and both flanks.</p>
               <p>The fact that the fatal flashes and puffs of smoke and volleys seemed to come
                  right out of the ground and from unseen foes, while the whole air and woods around
                  rang full of savage yells and horrible screechings, completed the demoralization.
                  Many afterwards declared that during the whole three hours' contest they had never
                  once seen a foe; while others would not assert that they had seen over half a
                  dozen. It is only wonder that soldiers so wretchedly posted and so badly
                  commanded, could stand it as long as they did. (See <hi rend="i"/>Appendix V.)</p>
               <p>The provincials suffered as much as the British soldiers. Whenever and wherever
                  they could, they took to the trees. It is even asserted, and we think it probable,
                  that some of the officers who, by Braddock's explicit command, attempted to beat
                  back into the road the men who had thus sought shelter behind trees, were shot by
                  their own men.</p>
               <p>In one of the pauses of this one-sided conflict, Washington, who had been kept
                  busy carrying the General's orders —the'other aides, Orme and Morris, having been
                  wounded—saw Col. Halket, grim and weary-looking, standing discounted under a huge
                  oak, and leaning heavily against its massive trunk. Hastening up and out a little
                  from the fire, he anxiously inquired,</p>
               <p>"I trust, Sir Peter, you are not very badly hurt?"</p>
               <p>"Na, na, Geordie; but Ise gotten eneuch. Tis joost aboon my baldric. Wha culd luke
                  to go thro' siccan an awsome day wi'out scaur or scaith. I ha'e fear Ise ta'en a
                  strong grippit o' death. I am sair, sair forfoughten, but, ne'er fear, mon, but
                  wha' the auld Sir Peter will e'er present a heckle to his foes."</p>
               <p>"Oh, 'tis not so bad as that, Colonel," said Washington; "but you, like the rest
                  of us, have received your baptism of fire. 'Tis a gory field, and the end's not
                  yet."</p>
               <p>"D'ye mind, Major, the 'secon-sight' I tauld ye of yestreen and the vision of
                  bluid? Said I not recht?—but, ha'e ye seen Jamie, laddie?"</p>
               <p>"I have, Sir Peter; there he stands, and unhurt."</p>
               <p>"'Tis strange, verra strange. 'Tis the bairn Francis, and not James that's hurt
                  and ta'en to the rear, alang wi' Sir John Sinclair, Col. Burton, Gladwin, and mony
                  ithers. Oh, but this is a sorra day! Braddock's joost lost his fourth horse. The
                  fule carle thinks he's fightin' on the broad plains o' Flanders. 'Tis eneuch
                  amaist to drive one distraught to see him trying to wheel and manœuvre a whail
                  army, shoulther to shoulther, in a twal-fut road I ha'e beggit him to let his men
                  tak to the woods, but the dour deevil wi' not. He's clean daft, Geordie, clean
                  daft."</p>
               <p>"Well, Colonel," said Washington," no use to discuss the General now. You need
                  immediate attention. I'll send some soldiers to take you to the rear."</p>
               <p>Washington had scarce gone a hundred paces before a bullet, sped by an Indian
                  rifle from the ravine, struck Halket<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7175-00000158"/>
                  ket straight through the heart. Just as he was falling, his son James rushed
                  forward and caught him in his arms He, too, was at the same instant mortally
                  struck, and both fell together, locked in each other's embrace, and this was the
                  last of the old Scotch nobleman.</p>
               <p>The two bodies lay, just where they fell, for years, through summer's heat and
                  winter's snow—"'mid all the wreck of the spiteful elements." We will hereafter
                  relate how, three years after, two skeletons were found locked together, and in
                  how singular a manner the young Sir Peter Halket identified them as those of his
                  father and brother.</p>
               <p>The Provincials—the American militia of whom Braddock was so contemptuous—were
                  among the last to yield the hill. Among them were Jack, Gist, Waggoner,
                  Scarooyaddy and others of the more cool and collected scouts and rangers, who had,
                  wherever they could obtain a "coign of vantage," kept up a desultory fire upon the
                  foe.</p>
               <p>About this time Jack, his face all begrimed with powder, his bullets almost all
                  spent, his eyes glowering and teeth clenched in a sort of bull-dog fixedness, was
                  sullenly retiring from tree to tree hotly pushed by some Ottawa Indians, when he
                  noted the approach of our old acquaintance, Captain Waggoner of the Virginia
                  Rangers, with what was left of his men. They were doggedly retreating step by
                  step, casting many an anxious look behind.</p>
               <p>"Waggoner," exclaimed Jack,"' tis a crying shame that we should stay here and be
                  butchered for the mad whims of a man, who may be as brave as Julius Cæsar but
                  who's also as crazy as a loon. Now, I've been studying the lay of these lurking
                  red devils, and from the line of their fire, I feel certain their whole position
                  can be turned from that huge fallen tree yonder, lying just on the rise of the
                  hill. What say you? Can you take your men, and let us run for it?"</p>
               <p>"Good! Jack. Give me your hand on't, old hickory! I'm with you till death. I can
                  depend on what is left of my company to a man, and think I can get enough rangers
                  from Dobb's, Dagworthy's, Stevens' and Peyronies' companies to make the attempt.
                  Ho!" he shouted in clear, ringing tones, "American rangers, stay one moment! We've
                  tried fighting Indians on the British plan, and if we go on one short half hour
                  longer, we'll not have a whole scalp left. Captain Jack proposes to run forward
                  and take possession of yonder huge log, which commands the enemy's position and
                  will give us complete protection, and we'll route those cursed, yelping, barking
                  devils down there, quicker'n you could scrunch a nest of rattlesnakes. All who
                  want to redeem this disgraceful day and strike at least <emph>one</emph> stout
                  blow for victory, follow me!"</p>
               <p>A hearty cheer rang out, and about eighty American rangers, including, also, Jack,
                  Scarooyaddy, Alaquippa's two sons, Gist, Fairfax, and two other friendly Indians,
                  agreed to follow.</p>
               <p>"Now, lads, all load up, and sling each man of you around his tree and draw their
                  fire:"</p>
               <p>"So;" as a brisk volley came from the foe. "Now for it," and Jack and Waggoner
                  leading, they darted rapidly forward, rifles cocked, all ready in trail and losing
                  only three men by the way.</p>
               <p>"Now!" shouted Waggoner, "spread yourselves along snug and fire one volley all
                  together, and then every man load and fire at will, and if we don't have some
                  little to boast of this day, my name's not Tom Waggoner. Look! Jack; look! D'ye
                  see the painted slippery devils wriggling and gliding away! Aha we've got 'em,
                  every pop! Now for it, boys! Quick! quick! before you lose 'em. Ready! Take aim!
                     <emph>Fire!</emph>—and a tremendous volley and red line of flame leaped from
                  their rifles.</p>
               <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7175-00000159"/>
               <p>"Ha!" yelled Jack, springing to his feet with excitement, as he saw a whole raft
                  of Indians break cover. "One more like that and we'll have scalps enough to buy a
                  farm apiece. Hurrah! boys; hur—"</p>
               <p>His words were drowned by the roar of guns and a general discharge of musketry
                  behind him, and at least forty of the eighty fell killed and wounded by the fire
                  from the mob of British regulars in their rear, who loaded and fired wherever they
                  saw a flash or smoke.</p>
               <p>"My God!" gasped Jack, the first to recover from the dreadful shock which seemed
                  to paralyze and hold speechless all that were left. "Shot by our own men, as I'm a
                  living sinner! Worse than murder, by heavens! Come, Waggoner and Yaddy, it's no
                  use. The day's lost when British soldiers can thus slaughter their betters."</p>
               <p>Another volley was poured on their doomed heads, until fifty out of the gallant
                  little band were either killed or wounded, and the rest were put to a hasty
                  flight. Their rage, disgust and indignation can be imagined but not described.<ref

               </note>
               <p>Braddock, almost all his best officers either killed or wounded, and all the
                  ammunition shot away, found it now almost impossible even to effect a safe or
                  orderly retreat. The Indians, having little more to fear from the army on the hill
                  plain, had now worked down the ravines until they appeared on the first "bottom,"
                  and commenced to attack the baggage.</p>
               <p>The flank parties posted for its security all but one ran in. A great number of
                  horses and some drivers were shot down, while the rest, cutting loose the best
                  horses in the teams, mounted and were off. The cannon did some service, and,
                  commanded and sometimes even served by Washington himself, had for sometime kept
                  off the foe, but the spot was so woody that very little execution could be
                  done.</p>

               <p>JUST at this juncture, Braddock himself, who had had five horses killed under him
                  and whose clothes had been, riddled with bullets, received a mortal wound while
                  standing beneath a large tree on the brow of the second rise. The ball passed
                  through his right arm, lodging deep in his lungs. The order he was just giving was
                  left unfinished on his lips. Falling from his horse, there the brave but
                  unfortunate General lay, with but a few friends around him and all his drilled
                  veterans flying off in headlong, disgraceful flight. "They ran," wrote Washington
                  in his first letter after the battle, "as sheep pursued by the dogs, and it was
                  impossible to rally them."</p>
               <p>It is related by George Croghan, the famous Indian Interpreter, that Braddock,
                  unwilling to survive the disgrace of his defeat, disgusted at his desertion by the
                  famous soldiers "who had served with the Duke," and probably tormented by the
                  pains from his wound, refused to be carried from the field, insisted upon being
                  left alone, and finally tried to possess himself of Croghan's pistol, wherewith to
                  make an end of himself.</p>
               <p>Be this as it may, Captain Orme, wounded as he was, offered sixty guineas to any
                  of the regulars who would carry him off the field, but in vain. It was a <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">Sauve qui peut</foreign> rout with the regulars and "devil take
                  the hindmost."</p>
               <p>Captain Stewart, of Virginia, commander of the body guard of light horse, and
                  Braddock's own "aide" Captain Orme, carried the dying General off the field, put
                  him in a tumbril, then upon a fresh horse, and thus the old veteran was borne from
                  the scene of his defeat. It was a custom in those days for every officer to carry
                  a sash of scarlet, silken net-work, with which to bear him, if wounded, from the
                  field. The sash in which Braddock was this day carried, the date of its
                  manufacture (1707) and the initials E. B. wrought in the woof, and the blood-red
                  stains upon its netting still visible, is said to be yet preserved in the family
                  of the late President Taylor.</p>
               <p>The fall of the General destroyed all semblance of further opposition. Every aide
                  but Washington and every field officer was struck down. About nine hundred out of
                  the fourteen hundred men, and sixty-three out of the eighty-six officers were
                  either killed or wounded, and the rest scarce waited for the drums to sound the
                  retreat. All, all was abandoned! Horses, cattle, wagons, artillery, military
                  chest, personal baggage, <emph>every thing</emph>—and what was worse, almost
                     <emph>every person</emph> who was badly wounded.<ref rend="super"

                  <p><ref target="#return_004">*</ref>There were two exceptions worthy of special note. Captain Treby of the 44th
                     was so desperately wounded as to be unable even to crawl to the nearest
                     bushes to avoid the pursuing Indians. While the herd of fugitives went
                     trooping by, his woful situation arrested the attention, of a gentleman
                     volunteer named Farrel, who placed the sufferer on his own back and so
                     carried him until out of danger. At the first fire, Captain John Coyngham's
                     house was shot down and he himself very severely wounded. Falling under his
                     horse, and being unable to rescue himself, his soldiers "for the love they
                     bore him," rushed to his rescue and finally carried him in triumph to a
                     place of safety, athough many were shot dead in the attempt.</p>

               <p>Down, down the fugitive mob rushed to the ford, over which they had passed with
                  such pageantry and enthusiasm in the morning. The whole route was strewn with
                  guns, military trappings, and even clothing—<emph>all</emph> which could impede
                  flight. About fifty Indians pursued even to the Monongahela, tomahawking several
                  in the passage.</p>
               <p>It was well that the savages, glutted with blood, ladened down with scalps, or
                  having a wholesome fear of Dunbar's army still in the rear, turned aside from the
                  monotony of slaughter to the work of gathering the rich spoils of the disastrous
                  field. Had they chosen to pursue across the river, or had they gone up the same
                  bank and waited at the other ford, two miles above, for the poor, panting,
                  exhausted; and panic-stricken fugitives, as they crossed the stream for the fourth
                  time that day, but few would have been left to tell the sad and disgraceful
                  tale.</p>
               <p>But happily, and it is a well-attested historical fact, the French and Indians
                  were about as much frightened as the British. After hastily tearing away the
                  scalps from both living and dead lying on the fatal field; after having loaded
                  themselves and the captive beasts with all manner of spoils and killed all the
                  horses they could not take with them, they spiked the British artillery and burst
                  all the shell, and only followed the route of the British fugitives when they
                  learned from deserters that the panic with Dun-bar's reserves was even greater
                  than with the army in the field.</p>
               <p>Scarcely believing that this disgrace, which was at the time considered throughout
                  the country as far greater, more inexcusable, and more disastrous in its
                  consequences than even the defeat and flight of Braddock's army, could be
                  possible, Dumas—Beaujeu's successor—then sent a force to follow the route, and to
                  destroy all that "Dunbar the Tardy," in his pusillanimity, bad left.</p>
               <p>This headlong, disgraceful flight is an unwelcome theme, and not being directly
                  connected with our story, we care not to dwell on it, except to say that about a
                  quarter of a mile on the other side of the river, a hundred men were prevailed
                  upon to make a brief stand at a favorable point. Braddock and some wounded
                  officers remained there an hour or so, but soon all the soldiers sneaked off, and
                  Washington, sick, exhausted and fever-stricken as he was, and having so lately
                  passed through a most terrible ordeal, with two horses shot under him and four
                  bullets through his coat, was dispatched by Braddock to Dunbar to forward wagons,
                  provisions, etc., to the wounded.</p>
               <p>He rode sad and oppressed during the whole of that wet, long and dismal night;
                  through dark, gloomy forests, frequently having to dismount to grope for the path,
                  and reached Dunbar—whose camp was in an incredible state of alarm and confusion
                  from reports brought by the frightened wagoners—by sunrise the next morning. His
                  wretched feelings during that truly doleful ride can better be imagined than
                  described. Thence, being still very feeble, he retired to Mt. Vernon to recruit
                  his shattered health.</p>
               <p>It is a well-attested fact, that in 1770—fifteen years after this
                  battle—Washington, when travelling on the Big Kana-wha, was visited by an old
                  Indian chief, who stated that he had been present at the battle of Braddock's
                  Fields and had not only often fired on Washington himself but had instructed his
                  young warriors to fire; but finding it in vain, had come to the conclusion that he
                  was protected by the Great Spirit and was preserved for a great future. So,
                  indeed, he was.</p>
               <p>We may pause by the way one moment to follow Braddock till death released him. He
                  remained under the faithful care of Captain Stewart; was first carried on
                  horseback and afterwards conveyed by soldiers in his sash, fastened on poles as a
                  "stretcher."</p>
               <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7175-00000162"/>
               <p>At 10 P. M. on the tenth, the day after the battle, he reached Gist's plantation.
                  Next morning he arrived at Dunbar's camp, high up in the Laurel Hill, six miles
                  from the present city of Uniontown, where the half-famished fugitives from the
                  battle-field were constantly coming in and soldiers deserting by the score without
                  ceremony.</p>
               <p>Braddock's strength was now rapidly ebbing away. He had abandoned all hope of
                  achieving anything; and it is to be supposed that the sufferings of his mind were
                  far greater than those of his body. He still issued his commands, and confidently
                  expecting pursuit and knowing that Dunbar's panic-stricken force was in a most
                  shameful and dangerous state of demoralization, ordered the destruction of the
                  immense stores of arms, wagons, powder, and provisions, resuming his march towards
                  Cumberland on the 12th. These orders were not fit for a British officer to give,
                  nor for one to obey. Want of horses and demoralization of his army were Dunbar's
                  excuses.</p>
               <p>On the 13th, Braddock was evidently sinking fast. Ever since the retreat
                  commenced, he had preserved an almost unbroken silence. His dying hours were very
                  much embittered, and it would have been far better had he left his remains on the
                  carnage field.</p>
               <p>The only allusions he made to the fate of the battle, was to softly repeat to
                  himself once or twice: "Who would have thought it?" Turning to Orme: "We shall
                  better know how to deal with them another time!" and these were his parting
                  words.</p>
               <p>A few moments later he breathed his last at 8 P. M. Sunday, the 13th, and was
                  buried the next morning right in the middle of the road—Washington reading the
                  funeral service over his grave. The troops, wagons, and artillery passed over the
                  place to destroy all traces and prevent discovery and mutilation by the enemy,
                  supposed to be in pursuit. (See <hi rend="i"/>Appendix W.)</p>
               <p>About 1823, some laborers, while working on this road, exposed these last "unwept,
                  unhonored, and unsung" remains. They were still distinguishable by their military
                  trappings. It is asserted that some were sent to Peale's Museum, Philadelphia,
                  while the rest were re-interred under a tree near by.</p>
               <p>This tree has, in these present times, either by "Decay's effacing fingers," or by
                  the spoliations of relic hunters, been reduced to a mere rotten stump. It remained
                  for Josiah King and John Murdock, of Pittsburgh, to rescue the spot from total
                  neglect. In December, 1871, they proceeded to the forsaken grave, situate on the
                  farm of James Dixon, nine miles east of Uniontown, and planted about it a number
                  of elms, spruces, larches and willows. Should any fail to grow, they will be
                  replaced, and Mr. Dixon having agreed to surround the spot with a strong fence, it
                  is to be hoped that thus the last resting place of the brave but rash and
                  unfortunate General will be marked out to generations yet to come.</p>
               <p>We scarce deem it worth while to allude to a Pennsylvania tradition, industriously
                  circulated and generally believed throughout the whole country for half a century,
                  that Braddock fell by the hands of one of his own men.</p>
               <p>Thomas Fausett, a sort of mountain hermit of Fayette county, wild, uncouth and
                  gigantic in his appearance, distinctly claimed for himself that he killed Braddock
                  to save the remnant of the army from destruction, and to revenge the cutting down
                  of his brother Joseph by Braddock for taking position behind a tree.</p>
               <p>Hon. Winthrop Sargent, who, under the auspices of the Pennsylvania Historical
                  Society, published the only full and reliable history of Braddock's expedition and
                  battle, has most carefully and thoroughly examined this Fausett romance, sifting
                  all the evidence on which its credibility rests, and unhesitatingly pronounces it
                  unworthy of credence<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7175-00000163"/> dence. In this
                  dictum we most heartily concur. There is not a tittle of trustworthy evidence to
                  support the story. All cotemporary authorities are totally silent concerning any
                  such feat, and Fausett's own tale—as well as are the accounts of those who uphold
                  his claim—is bungling, absurd, and inconsistent.</p>

               <p>SOON as the fierce tempest of battle and the cloud of hurtling bullets had fairly
                  swept the beaten forces over the slope and down upon the lower flat, Jack felt
                  that all was over. He saw the "beginning of the end."</p>
               <p>Knowing that the ruthless savages would soon spread as a red cloud over the plain,
                  and anxious for the fate of Marie—though absent not forgotten—he called on the
                  Half-King, and while Jack hurried towards Frazier's cabin, the latter proceeded to
                  the woods' edge where last he had seen Marie.</p>
               <p>All silent and desolate. Jack, his heart heavy and his brain fairly in a whirl
                  from apprehension, then made for the old naturalist's grave. Unhappy man! No Marie
                  to be seen. All deserted. Her horse, which was tied near, gone too—not a trace of
                  either.</p>
               <p>Back again to the cabin, his limbs in a tremor; now out upon the bluff, gazing
                  wistfully over the water.</p>
               <p>Amid a group of fugitives crossing the stream—at that time exceeding low—he
                  recognized Lieutenant Frazier, wife, and daughter on their horses, but no Marie.
                     He<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7175-00000164"/> scarce knew what to think or do.
                  He was fairly stunned. His breath came thick and fast, and he leaned wearily
                  against the cabin to regather his dazed senses.</p>
               <p>A touch on the shoulder startled him. It was the Half-King.</p>
               <p>"My brother does not see clear to-day," he said, in earnest and sympathizing
                  tones. "The loss of the 'Wood-thrush' clouds his mind. Scarooyaddy is now old. He
                  has no young maiden to make the blood fast come and go. When—"</p>
               <p>"What is it, Yaddy? Out with it, Chief! Have you any trace of her? Speak
                  quick!"</p>
               <p>"Come!"—rapidly leading the way to the grave of de Bonneville. "When my brother
                  lose his senses, Scarooyaddy must see and think for him. He has been out on the
                  search. Look there!"—pointing to the place where the palfrey was tied and around
                  which could be faintly discerned traces of moccasined feet.</p>
               <p>Jack gazed first at the prints, and then at the Half-King. He was now himself
                  again, although very deeply moved.</p>
               <p>"Indians, sure as there's a God above us! Anything more, Chief?"</p>
               <p>The Half-King led the way into the woods and down the river's margin, pointing out
                  the plain tracks of the horse, and here and there and on both sides, foot prints,
                  twigs broken, leaves displaced, and sundry other mute but infallible signs.</p>
               <p>"Yes!" excitedly exclaimed Jack, "here the horse has gone and Indians on both
                  sides of it—that's clear as sunlight—but no trace of Marie. She may have crossed
                  the river, or, frightened by the terrible tumult of the fight, may have joined the
                  crowd about the artillery; or—"</p>
               <p>"Come a little further," quietly answered the Half-King. "What does my brother
                  think of that?" pointing to a lady's glove lying aside of the road, behind a
                  laurel bush, which the instinctive delicacy of the Chief had left to the ardent
                  lover first to touch. Marie, at some favorable moment, must have thrown it behind
                  her for a clue to Jack, should he seek her.</p>
               <p>Jack snatched the dear token from the grass, pressed it to his lips, and said in
                  great agitation:</p>
               <p>"Chief, you are right—are <emph>always</emph> right. No more room for doubt. Marie
                  is a captive, and among Indians. This precious little glove bids me follow and
                  rescue her. Anything else?"</p>
               <p>"Listen! The Indians are five; they are Delawares; they have passed only a half
                  hour; they were careless and did not fear pursuit, and they will keep the river
                  bank and not go along the hills."</p>
               <p>Jack, knowing well the unerring and almost miraculous sagacity with which Indians
                  discern and interpret the minutest signs, and having had very many especial
                  occasions to test Scarooyaddy's wonderful powers in studying out and following
                  indistinct trails, at once accepted the Indian's conclusions with unquestioning
                  confidence. He himself was no mean adept in all kinds of woodcraft, but in
                  trail-hunting he yielded the palm to the old Half-King. It was an Indian's life
                  business, his <emph>specialty,</emph> as it were.</p>
               <p>Jack mused a moment. The great love he bore the fair captive made him less prompt
                  and resolute than usual. Looking up somewhat anxiously, however, he said:</p>
               <p>"Well, Chief, you know the awful peril just now, but I'd follow that trail if it
                  led into King Shingiss' wigwam—yes, into the very grave. Here let us part. The
                  whole country is alive with enemies, and I must, as you know, go right through
                  them and into their very nest."</p>
               <p>The Half-King darted a quick, hurt look at his companion and said simply and
                  quietly, but none the less rebukingly:</p>
               <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7175-00000165"/>
               <p>"'The Black Rifle' is very dear to Scarooyaddy. When his son was killed by
                  Braddock's soldiers, his white brother came to his lodge and wept and mourned with
                  him, and now that the 'Wood-thrush' is taken to a Delaware cage, shall a great
                  Chief turn his back and let his brother hunt his song bird alone? Is Scarooyaddy a
                  Delaware dog to do so vile a thing?"</p>
               <p>"I might have known as much, Chief," said Jack, pressing the Indian's hand, and
                  brightening up at this proof of friendship and valuable assistance. "Well, be it
                  so, Yaddy. We've hunted many's the trail together, and I'd be loth to part company
                  now. So step out, Chief! If Marie <emph>can</emph> be found, we'll find her and
                  save her, too."</p>
               <p>And the twain, taking on the set look, and falling into the steady, dogged gait of
                  trained trailers, passed deep into the woods and along the very route they had so
                  gallantly fought over a few days before.</p>
               <p>While so many others were then flying from the foe, these two tried scouts, their
                  lives in their hands, were going directly towards him—out of the jaws of death
                  into the mouth of hell.</p>

               <p>HOURS after Beaujeu and his Indians had left the fort, Talbot and Smith sat on the
                  ramparts, gazing out upon the woods which had covered them from view. Both felt
                  confident of victory, but Talbot, with his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">couleur du
                     rose</foreign> disposition, and with such an exalted and unshakable confidence
                  in Braddock and his drilled army, felt actually jubilant.</p>
               <p>"You see, James," he said, in one of his gushes, "Braddock's no chicken. He's an
                  old campaigner—has served long under the fighting Duke of Cumberland and knows a
                  thing or so. Those screeching scaramouches, too, who sometimes positively make me
                  blush for the brevity of their pantaloons and the exposure of their bosoms, have
                  no cannon, and when the first big gun is trained on them and opens with its awful
                  roar—and when the grenadiers, with their muff caps, commence to throw their
                  grenades, 'twill be just like—like—what <emph>will</emph> it be like, Smith?"</p>
               <p>"I'll swear <emph>I</emph> don't know, Mr. Talbot; tell me. Miss Fleury chasing
                  the fort chickens?"</p>
               <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7175-00000166"/>
               <p>"Pshaw! Why, like a fox jumping into a warren of rabbits, to be sure! You'll see
                  those red rascals trooping back into their holes absolutely white in the face, and
                  old father Nymwha at the head of them; but, by jove, here comes your Miss Fleury
                  and looking pretty as a pink, too. Bon jour, mademoiselle!"</p>
               <p>"Good day, milord," replied the doctor's daughter, appearing somewhat anxious and
                  nervous. "I fear we're about to have a terrible battle. What <emph>will</emph>
                  become of us, should your General be victorious? Has he a very superior force,
                  milord?"</p>
               <p>"Well, mademoiselle, not so much as regards quantity, but in quality—if you'll
                  allow me—I think—no, I'm sure of it—he has—but never fear, my young lady, you may
                  expect the most generous and courteous treatment at Braddock's hands. He's a
                  perfect gentleman and a very great favorite with the ladies."</p>
               <p>"I haven't, between you and me, milord, too much faith in our painted friends.
                  They appear jealous and suspicious, and if they were crossed in anything, would
                  prove treacherous; but Beaujeu says that wherever they've been fairly matched with
                  the British, they've beaten them."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Beaujeu be d—dumbfounded!" hotly answered Talbot. "He's enough to make a
                  fellow swear! <emph>He</emph> knows much about the British, don't he? What's he
                  made all ready to decamp for? Look at those guns and other signs! Why, his own
                  Indians bully him. When Braddock reaches here, by the lord Harry, if I don't get
                  him to make the pompous, swaggering old turkey-cock run the gauntlet of
                     <emph>our</emph> Indians! Yes, and blamed if I wont dress up, or rather down,
                  as the head of the file! But, halloo! what's that?—sounds like the distant roar of
                  cannon. Listen!"</p>
               <p>Again came that peculiar, impressive, reverberating roar, distant, yet
                  distinct.</p>
               <p>"It is, James, by Jupiter Ammon! and Braddock's army is come at last! 'Twouldn't
                  do for me to hurrah just here, but would you mind telling me what time it is,
                  mademoiselle?"</p>
               <p>"About two, milord. Why do you ask?"</p>
               <p>"Two? Well, let's <hi rend="i"/>kalkerlate, as they say in these colonies; about
                  half an hour for the scrimmage, and three hours for the long driving them—that
                  makes three and a half; then a half hour here, accepting the invitation to enter;
                  that makes four. About six—well, may be half-past six—this evening, Miss de
                  Fleury, I hope to have the pleasure of introducing to you our gallant old
                  General."</p>
               <p>"Come, come! milord!" flashed up the little lady. "These are strange words from a
                  prisoner. As I can't share with you in your opinions, I beg to take my leave; and
                  I'd advise you, as a friend, to restrain your tongue somewhat."</p>
               <p>"Appears to be a little huffy, Smith. May be I <emph>did</emph> show more delight
                  than was civil or prudent; but I never, in all my born days, James, felt so big
                  and proud."</p>
               <p>"Braddock's guns <emph>have</emph> a cheery, gladsome sound to a poor prisoner,"
                  said Smith. "But oh, they've been <emph>so</emph> long a coming."</p>
               <p>"Never fear!" gaily answered Talbot; "they're here now, and I don't see how I can
                  be held down. Every roar—just listen to <emph>that</emph> music!—seems to lift me
                  right out of my boots. I just think I see the grape and canister scattering those
                  bewildered reddies; but, Smith, we'll have to sit around for a few hours, meek as
                  Moses, or these poor fellows wont like it. I wonder if they'll evacuate. Gad, I'm
                  afraid of it."</p>
               <p>By this time every man left in the fort was out on the drill ground, or gathered
                  in groups on the rampart, looking intently, in the direction of the sounds, and
                  speculating in low tones on the chances of the battle then in progress.</p>
               <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7175-00000167"/>
               <p>All were anxious, restless and excited, and these feelings increased as the hours
                  wore on. The reports of the cannon could be distinctly heard, now singly, now in
                  full chorus, and each sound, as it came, caused its thrill. Conversation sank to a
                  whisper; positions were shifted; none could stay from the ramparts, and every eye
                  was anxiously fixed on the woods for the first fateful news from the field.</p>
               <p>About five o'clock the whole line of listeners was electrified by the sudden
                  emergence of an Indian runner from the wood in front. Almost exhausted, panting,
                  breathless, and covered with sweat, he gave one scalp halloo, and staggered his
                  way immediately towards the crowd who had gone out to meet him and know the fate
                  of the fort.</p>
               <p>It was Nymwha himself, but almost spent with rapid running. His news came from him
                  in jerks and spurts, ever and anon interrupted by a scalp halloo, and the glad
                  tidings he brought were soon passed from mouth to mouth.</p>
               <p>The change from anxiety and apprehension to that of joy and exultation, was indeed
                  magical. Every eye danced with delight. The soldiers shook hands with each other,
                  and so crowded on the old Shawnee, asking a thousand questions, that the grim
                  Chief was nearly suffocated. He was the hero of the hour.</p>
               <p>His tale was soon told. Its burden was that Beaujeu had not been able to reach the
                  ford, where, posted securely behind the thick trees on the river's margin and with
                  Braddock's unsheltered army before him, he had hoped to drive them back; that,
                  although the battle was in full progress when he left, there could be no doubt of
                  the issue, as the English had been surrounded, and were shot down in great
                  numbers; that the Indians had been hidden in ravines and behind trees, and that
                  the Swannocks [English], instead of at once flying or rushing on the concealed
                  foe, appeared completely bewildered, huddled together in the centre of a ring, and
                  before the sun was down there wouldn't be a man of them alive. Beaujeu was killed,
                  and a few Canadians and Indians, but almost all Braddock's officers had been
                  picked off their horses, where they foolishly remained to be shot.</p>
               <p>This was an awful shock for our poor captives. Their hearts sank within them. It
                  was like thunder out of a clear sky. They were the Indian's prisoners, and, if
                  this news were true, had nothing before them but death, torture, or captivity
                  almost as bad as either.</p>
               <p>At first Talbot scouted the story and flouted the story-teller; told Smith 'twas
                  as "false as hell;" that Braddock <emph>couldn't</emph> be beaten; that the runner
                  wouldn't have time to bring the news so soon. At length such was his violence that
                  the soldiers began to look ferociously at him, and would soon have laid rude hands
                  on the peppery little Englishman, had not the officer in temporary charge of the
                  fort threatened him with the guard house if he did not hold his peace.</p>
               <p>The poor fellow, crushed to the earth, but still hoping against hope, wandered off
                  to the Allegheny side of the fort, sat himself down on the bastion, almost
                  shedding tears of chagrin and disappointment.</p>
               <p>After a while he managed to get old Nymwha up to him, in order to question and
                  cross-question him. Drawing himself up to his full height, which our readers will
                  remember was not so <emph>very</emph> full, and confronting his captor and
                  expected father with an angry and indignant look, he burst out on him:</p>
               <p>"Nymwha, you hoary old sinner, you! Does your Great Spirit love lies?"</p>
               <p>"Me no like that talk from my son. Little 'Two-scalps' must watch his tongue, or
                  my squaws must switch him with hickories. Nymwha ever speaks truth, and is great
                     chief<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7175-00000168"/> and warrior. To-morrow he take
                  'Two-scalps' and make him his son before all the Shawanos tribe."</p>
               <p>Talbot winced under this threat, and began fully to realize his forlorn and
                  hopeless situation. He noted, too, a marked change in his once good-humored
                  captor. His temper and amiable mood had plainly altered. Besides, Nymwha looked
                  and talked so sincerely, that Talbot was forced to credit the tidings he
                  brought.</p>
               <p>"But, Nymwha, your story seems so wild, I can scarce believe it. Braddock had a
                  splendid army and is a great General."</p>
               <p>"Nymwha speak with a straight tongue. Braddock very brave but much crazy. All the
                  Indians laugh at him. Officers, too, crazy—lose their heads. Never try to find
                  enemy. Shoot each other down. No get behind trees, but all crowd thick in road so
                  Indians could better fire. Every redman have plenty horse and scalps. But me go to
                  meet my braves."</p>
               <p>Talbot now joined the throng on the ramparts. All were eager and joyful and on the
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">qui vive</foreign> for the next tidings. Meanwhile,
                  every gun of the fort had been loaded up to the muzzle, ready to celebrate the
                  victory.</p>

               <p>JUST as the sun was going behind the western hills and casting its dying glories
                  over the waters, a loud and constant firing was heard from the woods in front,
                  accompanied by the scalp-halloo, and a succession of short, sharp yells and whoops
                  and joyful shrieks, and the first Frenchmen emerged from the woods, driving before
                  them a number of horses, laden down with booty and spoils.</p>
               <p>The news, then, was true—not a peg left to hang a doubt on—and such a shouting and
                  firing of guns and cannon went up from the fort as never had been heard before.
                  The hills about were fairly full of the noisy tumult. It seemed, as Smith
                  expressed it, "as if all hell had broken loose for a holiday." (See <hi rend="i"
                  />Appendix X.)</p>
               <p>Soon appeared a constant succession of whites and Indians, absolutely staggering
                  under the weight of their booty, The latter were fantastically tricked out in
                  officers' chapeaus and gold-laced uniforms; flourishing swords in one<pb
                     n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7175-00000169"/> hand, and strings of scalps in the
                  other; silken sashes about their waists, and richly-embroidered baldricks and
                  silver gorgets about their breasts.</p>
               <p>Some had on cavalry boots, while others had their panted heads most grotesquely
                  hidden under the huge grenadiers' caps. Here one party trailed in the dirt the
                  flags and standards, while another dragged along the two brass six-pounders.</p>
               <p>The victory was, then, complete—too great, almost, for belief. Everything was in
                  their hands, and the joyful inmates of the fort rushed forth and mingled with the
                  crazy throngs outside—catching hands and leaping like a set of Dancing
                  Dervishes.</p>
               <p>To fittingly close the long procession, came a little band of twelve British
                  regulars, stripped entirely naked, their hands securely bound behind them, and
                  with half their faces and bodies painted black, a sure sign of their being devoted
                  to the stake and the prolonged cruelties of a savage torture.</p>
               <p>It was a sad and most piteous spectacle—enough to have moved a heart of stone. How
                  captured, none will ever know. If they surrendered to the Indians in hopes of
                  quarter and the usages of civilized war, they must have had a rude awakening long
                  ere they reached the fort.</p>
               <p>As these miserable and dejected captives approached, their eyes cast down, their
                  faces full of anxiety and apprehension, Talbot recognized Sergeant MacPherson at
                  their head and could not restrain his tears and sobs. He abruptly turned and left
                  the parapet. They were all his own unhappy countrymen, brought across the seas to
                  grace an Indian triumph.</p>
               <p>How would his eyes have streamed tears, and his breast have swelled with
                  indignation, had he then knew what he afterwards learned, that half the captives
                  had been tomahawked on the way from the field; that the remnant were prisoners of
                  the Indians, doomed to die a most horrid death by stake and torture.</p>
               <p>Yet so, indeed, it was. They were soon swept past the fort down to the beach of
                  the Allegheny, and conveyed across in canoes to a little island right opposite the
                  fort. The horrid, damnable rites were to take place that very night. The fires
                  were even then being lighted, and the stakes driven. Glutted with blood, the
                  pitiless devils now demanded torture by fire.</p>
               <p>Night now fell upon these maddening scenes of triumph, but neither did the silence
                  or the darkness long endure. Poor Talbot and Smith, their hearts bowed down with
                  grief and filled with the gloomiest apprehensions, retreated to the remotest angle
                  of the fort—that nearest the junction of the two rivers.</p>
               <p>Here they sorrowed and conversed together, wondering if they would be permitted to
                  question the prisoners when brought in. They had picked up the general results of
                  the battle, but Talbot, who had many friends in the army, hungered for more news,
                  and had just told Smith that he was resolved to give up his parole and share the
                  prison with the others. He would not accept any favors and would again risk his
                  life to escape.</p>
               <p>Their attention was now irresistibly drawn to the island opposite, where the
                  flames were blazing higher and higher, and where they could not but note the
                  assemblage of Indians constantly growing larger and larger.</p>
               <p>The huge fires, built on a bare space near the beach, cast a broad sweep of vivid
                  light across the water and fort. The dark stretch of sombre woods behind them was
                  brought out with wonderful clearness and distinctness, while the lines and circles
                  of swarthy Indians, as they either walked in front or danced and howled around the
                  flames, were thrown into strong relief.</p>
               <p>The excitement on this island grew stronger and stronger<pb n="330-331"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000170"/> each moment. The eyes of the two captives were
                  fascinated and held spell-bound by the weirdness of the scene. The "scalp-dance,"
                  and the "victory dance," were first performed, with such intense vigor, such wild
                  and savage screams, such leapings and grotesque contortions, as to excite the
                  utmost wonder along the line of soldiers which thronged the river ramparts.</p>
               <p>And now a brief and awful pause, and, amid a yelling and frantic crowd of painted
                  demons brandishing their blood-red tomahawks, the little crowd of naked British
                  regulars, Sergeant Mac Pherson at the head, are slowly led out and bound to
                  stakes, in full view from the illumined bastions of the French fort.</p>
               <p>"Good heavens!" cried Talbot, in the utmost anxiety; "why are the poor prisoners
                  there and what are they going to do? What! Why, Smith, it surely cannot mean
                  torture right in sight and hearing of the garrison! No! oh, no! They could
                     not—<emph>dare</emph> not commit such an atrocity."</p>
               <p>Talbot started up in alarm. Observing de Lignery standing not far off, he accosted
                  him in French.</p>
               <p>"May I ask, Captain, what is about to be done with your prisoners over there?"</p>
               <p>The French Captain shrugged his shoulders, tried to look away off, but obliged to
                  reply something, said curtly:</p>
               <p>"Not <emph>our</emph> prisoners but the Indians'. I believe they are going to put
                  them to death."</p>
               <p>"Great heaven!" excitedly exclaimed the now thoroughly-aroused Talbot, "What! by
                  torture? Your Commandant surely would not permit so inhuman, so horrible, so
                  cowardly an act."</p>
               <p>Another shrug and far-off look from the French Captain, as if he wished to avoid
                  those earnest, indignant, questioning eyes.</p>
               <p>"There sits le Capitaine Dumas, milord, in his quarters. He is now the Commandant.
                  Go ask him."</p>
               <p>"That will I," and running straight up to where Captain Dumas sat writing in his
                  room, and hastily passing the single guard, he burst out in French:</p>
               <p>"Will monsieur please inform me what mean the fires and your prisoners on that
                  island?"</p>
               <p>Dumas started, grew pale, shrugged his shoulders, French fashion, and finally
                  said, as de Lignery did before him:</p>
               <p>"The <emph>Indians</emph>' prisoners, milord. They intend to treat them, I very
                  much fear, in their own manner. We are powerless to prevent—"</p>
               <p>"What!" cried Talbot, his face and voice betraying his horror and indignation;
                  "scalp and torture them? in sight, too, of this fort and the lilies of France?
                  Surely Captain Dumas jests. I have found him brave, gentle and humane, and he
                  cannot mean so cruel a thing. He <emph>dare</emph> not so stain the French
                  escutcheon and besmirch the victory his allies have somehow been allowed to win
                  this day. Are those inhuman savages not yet glutted with blood?"</p>
               <p>"I fear, milord, the Indians must carry out their customs," answered Dumas, with a
                  shamed and cowed look. "We have already crossed them many times to-day. They are
                  angry, excited and rebellious—have demanded the lives of their prisoners, and
                  threaten to abandon us to-morrow if we do not allow them their sacrifices."</p>
               <p>"And you have consented?" questioned Talbot, his eyes flashing indignation, yet
                  trying to keep down his rising scorn and wrath.</p>
               <p>"What <emph>could</emph> I do?" the Frenchman deprecatingly argued. "Captain
                  Beaujeu <emph>might</emph> have influenced them, but, alas, he is killed, and my
                  authority is not yet respected. Braddock has another large army just behind him,
                  and I was forced to it to save this fort."</p>
               <p>"Forced—to—it?" slowly hissed out Talbot, his slight form rising, and his face so
                  aflame, as it were, with a righteous<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7175-00000171"/>
                  indignation, that Dumas fairly cowed before him, and appeared insignificant beside
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Forced to it! God in heaven! and you call yourself a gentleman of France? I tell
                  you, degenerate Sir, you have done a base, and a wicked, and an inhuman thing—one
                  that dishonors your flag and nation, and that disgaces <emph>you</emph> as a man
                  and an officer. I solemnly protest against this horrible barbarism, in the name of
                  God, my country, and humanity. I call on you to forbid <emph>at once</emph> this
                  awful outrage. Far better save your honor than your fort—your manhood than your
                  garrison. An avenging God will surely punish such <emph>cowardly</emph>
                  cruelty."</p>
               <p>"How, insolent Sir!" hotly answered Dumas, now finding in Talbot's bold but
                  imprudent words an excuse for a diversion; "do you, a prisoner and a civilian,
                  mean to insult a French officer in his own quarters?—to—to—"</p>
               <p>"I do, Sir," calmly interrupted Talbot; "if that <emph>can</emph> be done. I say
                  again, 'tis a cowardly act. I'll not withdraw the word. I'd say it if you sent me
                  to prison or death, or to the same slow torture you subject my poor countrymen. I
                  am <emph>more</emph> than your equal in rank, and if you wish to resent the
                  offence, there's my glove. I hold myself ready at any time and with any weapons;"
                  and Talbot cast down his glove before the astounded Frenchman, and with scorn on
                  his face and wrath in his eye, turned and left the cabin.</p>
               <p>The young Hotspur expected immediate arrest. But no. Captain Dumas, whose
                  subsequent career showed him a humane officer, felt at heart the English lord was
                  right. He had no defence; was afraid of a scene; and knowing there were no
                  witnesses, and that Nymwha had claimed and would remove his prisoner early next
                  morning, was fain to tamely swallow the insult.</p>

               <p>THE agonies of the poor prisoners had now commenced. Their doleful cries and
                  groans were swept over the fort. Most of the French soldiers, to their credit be
                  it said, withdrew from the sickening sight. One pitying glance from Talbot was
                  enough, and sent him, his hands tightly pressed over his ears, to the bastion
                  farthest removed from this horrible dance of death.</p>
               <p>The prisoners were baited about their stakes like bears, by their merciless
                  tormentors; obliged to run their weary rounds on hot embers; slashed with knives
                  and tomahawks; live coals pressed against their roasting, quivering muscles; pine
                  splinters, soaked in fat, thrust into their flesh and fired to crackle under the
                  skin; red-hot gun-barrels drawn across their shrinking flesh; scalding whiskey
                  poured down their parched and burning throats, and blazing brands thrust into
                  their mouths and ears.</p>
               <p>Oh, it was horrible, most horrible!</p>
               <pb n="334" xml:id="VAC7175-00000172"/>
               <p>Happy was the Indian who could wreak upon the wretched victim a pang or torture
                  more exquisite or excruciating than the last; who could wring from him a more
                  agonizing cry or more profound groan, and then to crown all this devilish
                  ingenuity, as the sinking, dying sufferer lost his sensibility; when his nerves no
                  longer shrank nor his flesh quivered; as his horrible screams diminished with the
                  power to feel, then, tearing off his scalp, these inhuman monsters extorted one
                  last dying groan, by flashing gunpowder or heaping coals on the throbbing,
                  palpitating brain beneath.</p>
               <p>And all this in full view of the frowning bastions of a French fort, whose flag
                  was never more sullied than on that day.</p>
               <p>Sergeant MacPherson, he whose sweet, powerful voice had—with his "Annie
                  Laurie"—only the night before, entertained the whole British army, and sent their
                  thoughts arid affections trooping homewards to their loved ones, was reserved for
                  the last. He was the only officer captured, and by a hellish refinement of savage
                  cruelty, his soul was to be first tortured before his body, by being compelled to
                  witness all the awful sufferings of his companions, and thus to enjoy a foretaste
                  of his own doom.</p>
               <p>It was almost a relief to him to have these incarnate fiends commence on his poor
                  body, but not for long. Soon a piercing shriek was extorted from the unhappy
                  sufferer, which set Talbot's nerves all on the quiver, and brought him once more
                  to the ramparts. All his countrymen silent in death save poor MacPherson, who
                  stood with hands tied over his head, and strongly revealed against the
                  firelight.</p>
               <p>Talbot had known the sweet singer well, and knew him now. He could stand it no
                  longer, Rushing to the nearest sentry, he suddenly wrenched the musket from his
                  hands, and before the frightened fellow could recover his<pb

                  </figure> senses, he took deliberate aim and fired, hoping thus to end the poor
                  fellow's tortures.</p>
               <p>It was well aimed, but, alas, the distance was too great. The ball missed its
                  mark, but succeeded in wounding one of the sergeant's chief tormentors. There
                  followed a momentary pause and stillness. The sergeant turned him towards the
                  fort, and dropping on his knees, appealingly stretched forth his charred hands for
                  another shot which might bring him surcease of misery.</p>
               <p>He asked not in vain. Just then there sounded on the night air the sharp, clear
                  crack of a rifle. The friendly bullet sped unerringly on its merciful mission.
                  Sergeant MacPherson gave but one leap, and then lay stark in death, shot directly
                  through the head.</p>
               <p>But who was the mysterious shooter who had thus balked the savages of their prey?
                  None could tell. Surely not Talbot, for he was now in the rough hands of the
                  guard, being rudely and violently dragged to prison.</p>
               <p>A great hush and wonder fell upon the garrison, and a terrible uproar and
                  commotion commenced on the island. The infuriated Indians turned angry eyes, and
                  made menacing gestures towards the fort, from which direction the two shots had
                  come.</p>
               <p>There was a running to and fro; whoops and shrieks followed in quick and appalling
                  succession. A crazy crowd of savages entered their canoes and made straight for
                  the fort. Fearing an assault, Dumas ordered the draw-bridge to be raised and
                  secured. The maddened mob were now at the very gate, and demanded instant
                  admission and prompt punishment on the insolent meddlers, one or two, who had
                  first wounded a chief, and then cheated them of their revenge.</p>
               <p>A parley was held. Dumas, who spoke Indian well, frankly explained the first shot,
                  and that the offended was their prisoner and would be severely punished. Whence<pb
                     n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7175-00000174"/> the second fatal shot proceeded, none
                  inside the fort knew. <emph>Must</emph> have come from the outside. They would
                  make every possible search for the guilty man.</p>
               <p>This speech was received with scorn by the crafty and infuriated Lake Indians, who
                  had already been deeply angered and disgusted at the division of the spoils of the
                  late battle-field.</p>
               <p>These now fairly howled in scornful derision. They were not fools to be so put off
                  by old squaws' stories. They had examined the bodies and the wounds, and the
                  bullets had plainly come from the fort; where else <emph>could</emph> they have
                  come from? The culprit must be instantly given to them, or they would seek revenge
                  and abandon the French.</p>
               <p>This was stoutly and sternly refused as impossible, and so the angry and insulted
                  Ottawas, after giving one discharge of their guns and a whoop of defiance, retired
                  for the night, and actually marched off early the next morning, but not before
                  killing and scalping two unlucky Frenchmen whom they caught outside the fort
                     stockades.<ref rend="super" target="#note_005" xml:id="return_005">*</ref>

               <p>THE trail on which Jack and the Half-King entered after finding Marie's glove, was
                  an easy one to follow. It lay for miles through the forest, and along the narrow
                  ledge between the hills and the Monongahela, and abundant evidence was given of
                  the truth of the shrewd old Indian's assertion, that the Delaware captors were
                  careless and regardless of pursuit.</p>
               <p>The contrast between the roar and tumult of the battle field, with all its savage
                  whoops and shrieks and vociferous clamor, and the hush and stillness of these
                  peaceful woods, was most marked and wonderful.</p>
               <p>Nothing now to be heard but the drone and drowsy hum of insect, or the plaintive
                  note of a wandering bird—the sluggish water on one side, and the silent, solemn,
                     rock-ribbed<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7175-00000175"/> ribbed hills on the
                  other. The trees lifted aloft their leafy coronals far above them, and through
                  these secluded cloisters and adown these woody aisles and colonnades, their
                  foot-fall was soft and noiseless.</p>
               <p>The two friends plodded along in silence, but with the stealth of panthers; and
                  Jack, though outwardly calm and quiet, was deeply excited. The traces left by the
                  enemy were so fresh, and the object of his search was so precious to him, that his
                  countenance seemed fairly to shine with the fierceness of his wrath, while his
                  eyes were actually aglow with passion, and pierced the dim vistas of the forest as
                  if their very glance would annihilate.</p>
               <p>The trail lay past "Four-Mile Run"—on which it will be remembered, the old
                  Naturalist had for so long his sylvan camp—until it came to a small, brawling
                  stream, now known by the euphoneous title of "Soho Run," where the tracks diverged
                  directly over the hills. Here the two scouts came to a sudden halt. They looked at
                  each other significantly, when Jack thus broke silence:</p>
               <p>"Well, Chief, the tale's told. Old King Shingiss escapes my vengeance this time.
                  'Tis that old thief and scalp-lifter, Captain Pipe of Shannopins, who must make
                  the acquaintance of 'Black Rifle.' I've a heavy score against him already. He's
                  the pitiless, murdering fiend, you know, whom I blame for the murder of my family.
                  I've hunted him scores of times, but he's ever managed to get off somehow. Now
                  that he's stolen away Marie—Gods!—but come! Yaddy, come! let's hasten! why
                  tarry?"</p>
               <p>"Stay! my brother," answered the cool and crafty Half-King, "that way leads to
                  sure and instant death. It crosses the broad and crowded trail leading from the
                  battle field. Hark! d'ye hear that?" as the first heavy boom of the fort guns came
                  roaring along the river hills. "The news of the battle has reached the fort, and
                  the crazy and scalp-laden victors are enjoying it."</p>
               <p>"And Where's the wonder?" bitterly exclaimed Jack. "They were fools else. Sure
                  never did men, with or without brains, march with wide-staring eyes into such a
                  clumsy fatal trap. Why, the wolves or bears of these woods wouldn 't so disgrace
                  themselves, and the old Braddock, too; oh, <emph>his</emph> troops would show the
                  American rangers how to fight Indians, and they <emph>did</emph> show us with a
                  vengeance: shooting us down like pigeons; turning on their own brave leaders and
                  running like deer before the hounds. Where would that army be now, Yaddy, if my
                  ranger scouts had not been so insolently sent back to their woods? Oh, its
                  sickening!"</p>
               <p>"Braddock much heart, very little head—no more sense than a mud turtle," moodily
                  answered the Half-king. "His soldiers wear too pretty clothes, make too much music
                  and too many turns. Shewnees and Delawares, brave warriors, and Shingiss and
                  Gyasutha and Killbuck and Pontiac wise and great chiefs. But, come! my brother
                  forgets the 'Wood-thrush' pines in a Delaware cage. We must find canoe here and go
                  in the dark. Water leaves no trail, and night shuts the eye of an enemy."</p>
               <p>"Right again, Chief! Down to the river at once and hunt a canoe! 'Twill go hard
                  with us but we'll stir up these yelping brethren of yours. <emph>We're</emph> not
                     <emph>half</emph>-whipped yet, and when Pipe feels most secure and careless,
                  we'll be right into his very camp. But let's stop awhile under you clump of
                  willows. 'Tis a trifle too early yet to venture out on the water."</p>
               <p>And the two crouched down under the bushes at the mouth of the run, and talked
                  earnestly together in low tones. As some disguise was absolutely necessary for
                  Jack, he proceeded to make himself look as much like an Indian as possible.
                  Borrowing some paints from his companion, he daubed and streaked his face in the
                     most<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7175-00000176"/> approved fashion. Then,
                  thrusting his fur cap into his pouch and gathering up his hair, he tied it at the
                  crown so as to resemble a scalp-lock, and made a few other changes, which so
                  completely transformed him that, except in broad daylight and on very near
                  inspection, he might readily pass for an Indian brave.</p>
               <p>"There, Chief," when he had all finished, "don't I make as grim and ugly and
                  vicious a looking chief as Nymwha or Black Hoof or any of yon red devils? 'Tis not
                  the first time I've turned Indian, either. Did ye ever hear me give the war-whoop?
                  I could make your scalp-lock stand right up—yes, drop clean off, unless it has
                  very deep roots. Now, Yaddy, creep down along shore, and see if you can find a
                  canoe."</p>
               <p>In half an hour or so, and just as it was growing somewhat dark and indistinct, a
                  canoe appeared around a point in the river, and came creeping up silently and
                  cautiously, the Half-King dipping his paddle so noiselessly as scarce to make
                  sound or ripple. When it touched the beach, Jack just as quietly shoved out, took
                  position and paddle, and when the mid-stream was reached, both sat down and the
                  boat was allowed to float idly with the current.</p>
               <p>It was now night. The big guns of the fort had by this time altogether ceased
                  their roar, but as the canoe slowly neared the junction of the rivers, the clamor
                  from the island opposite the fort commenced to make itself heard. Both scouts
                  pricked up their ears and rose cautiously up on their feet.</p>
               <p>"What's that, Chief?" whispered Jack. "'Pears to me I see a singular glow in the
                  sky over the fort there. What does it mean? It can't be that your people have
                  fired the brush to celebrate their easily-gotten victory. Well, no matter! I must
                  do the reddys justice. They planned and yelled and fought well—couldn't have done
                  better. Hang it, Chief, what d'ye make of it—the light and noise?"</p>
               <p>The old Half-King was a picture to see just then. He stoodly firmly erect in the
                  bow, his form looming up grandly in the gloom, his head bent forward in a
                  listening attitude, his eyes gleaming into the thick darkness ahead, his nostrils
                  in the air as it were. He was all alive, from moccasin to scalp-lock.</p>
               <p>The canoe was just then opposite the log tool-house outside the fort, whose rough
                  bastions and stockades appeared dim and indistinct in the distance beyond.</p>
               <p>"It means <emph>prisoners</emph>" he slowly hissed out at last, as he quietly
                  resumed his paddle. "The fires are all lighted and torture has commenced. Don't
                  you hear the screams?"</p>
               <p>"God in heaven! 'tis true—must be so!" fiercely exclaimed Jack, in his excitement,
                  and, dashing his paddle into the water.</p>
               <p>It was fortunate the rivers were just then well cleared of canoes. Most of the
                  Indians who were not dancing or carousing in their own camps or villages, had
                  already assembled on the island. A few quick, nervous strokes, and the prow of the
                  canoe turned towards the Allegheny, and there stood, fully revealed to their
                  startled gaze, the fires, the tortured prisoners, the circles of tormenting
                  savages, and all the horrible "dance of death," such as we have already described
                  it.</p>
               <p>Even the old Indian was moved, while Jack was fairly beside himself with rage and
                  excitement. He dropped his paddle and snatched up his long, black rifle, and was
                  proceeding to cock and aim it, when the Half-King darted forward and violently
                  caught his arm.</p>
               <p>"What would my foolish brother do? Is he so young and strong, and yet tired of
                  life? Does he too wish to be tied to yon stake, and roasted and tortured by
                  fire?"</p>
               <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7175-00000177"/>
               <p>"Hands off, Chief!" hissed out Jack. "I'd put a hole through that big fiend who's
                  hounding the rest on, if I died for it the next minute! Hands off, I tell ye!
                  You're all devils alike—cruel, savage, pitiless!"</p>
               <p>The old Chief's eyes fairly flashed fire and he would have immediately grappled
                  his loved friend, but all at once he released Jack's arm, drew himself up with
                  impressive dignity, and quietly said:</p>
               <p>"Scarooyaddy is now old, and is well content to die with his young white brother,
                  if he so wishes; but will the 'Wood-thrush' then sing more happily in Captain
                  Pipe's wigwam? Will she not listen, listen, listen for the footfall of the man she
                  loves, and wait for his strong arms to—?"</p>
               <p>"No more! and forgive me, Chief! I'm but a green boy to-night, and my head's
                  turned; but let's hurry past this cursed island and get to the Delaware
                  village!"</p>
               <p>The torture fires, as already described, were built on a little semi-circular
                  clearing near the beach of the island, and threw a broad but sharply-defined
                  expanse of light across the Allegheny and the opposite fort. On the very edge of
                  this bright reach of firelight, but quite in shadow, and only a hundred yards or
                  so out from the fort beach, rested the scouts' canoe. Hence the wisdom of the
                  prudent old Chief's answer to this suggestion.</p>
               <p>"It cannot be. The bright light would make us known to both those on the island
                  and at the fort, while just beyond, canoes are constantly coming and going. We
                  must stay here in the dark until all the canoes are over."</p>
               <p>"So be it, then, Chief; but back! back out, I say! Thank God I'm white, and can't
                  be made to look longer on such horrible sights or to have my ears filled with such
                  dreadful groans and shrieks!" and Jack gave two or three powerful back-strokes
                  with his paddle.</p>
               <p>Almost before he knew it, the craft had glided right between tween a couple of
                  canoes crowded with warriors, which had quietly come up unnoticed.</p>
               <p>The position was perilous in the extreme. It was well our scouts had gotten deeper
                  into shadow. Jack hurriedly turned his face and stooped as if hunting something in
                  the bottom of the boat. The Half-King, who had quickly taken in the whole danger,
                  had to face it out.</p>
               <p>Presuming the canoes were from King Shingiss' village on the Ohio, he called out
                  in the Shawnee tongue:</p>
               <p>"Hold there, Mohigans, or you'll run into us. If Shingiss' young men are come to
                  see how Braddock's palefaces meet death, why are they so wide out of the
                  course?"</p>
               <p>"Oh," came a voice back in rather broken Shawnese, "we've been in the battle and
                  stayed to send our dead and wounded down by canoe and to take scalps. We, too,
                  have just come down by water. Our girdles are laden down with the scalps of our
                  enemies. How do the 'Long Knives' stand fire?</p>
               <p>"Not like true Indians. They are cowards all and howl like wolves. We are from
                  Nymwha's village on the island. Our canoe takes in much water, and we go to find
                  another at the forks yonder. If you would see the pale-faces dance and scream
                  under torture you must hasten," and giving the canoe a stroke forward, that danger
                  was past.</p>
               <p>"'Twas a narrow escape, Yaddy," whispered Jack; "'tis safer, I think, to push
                  boldly past the fort than risk these chance comers. You have no doubt but that
                  Marie has been taken to Shannopins by Pipe?"</p>
               <p>"No doubt. There's where Wau-ki-na lives."</p>
               <p>"True, but what's Wau-ki-na to do with Marie?"</p>
               <p>"The 'Bounding-Fawn' loves the 'Wood-thrush' very much, but as she can't spring to
                     <emph>her,</emph> the old father brings the 'Wood-thrush' to Wau-ki-na."</p>
               <p>"You're right, Chief. I didn't think of that. Let's straight for Shannopins!"
                  giving the canoe a push up the river.</p>
               <pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7175-00000178"/>
               <p>The Indian no longer resisted. When they approached again the broad belt of light,
                  MacPherson had been bound to his stake and his cruel torture had commenced. The
                  same cry which had attracted Talbot to the ramparts also excited Jack. Looking
                  once more towards the fire, he said:</p>
               <p>"Look, Chief! What! that surely can't be my friend Sergeant MacPherson whom they
                  have there! It is, as I live!—the sweetest singer and the truest man in Braddock's
                  army."</p>
               <p>Another doleful cry of agony just then came from the island.</p>
               <p>"I tell you, Chief, I can't and wont delay an instant longer! I will balk those
                  demons and save the sergeant, if I take his place the next minute;" and Jack
                  snatched up his rifle.</p>
               <p>Just then came Talbot's shot from the fort, wounding the Indian behind the
                  sergeant. A moment's pause.</p>
               <p>"Chief," said Jack, sadly and solemnly, "I've deserved this; yes, I've deserved
                  it. I feel as if I'd been called a coward and been struck in the face. To be
                  reminded of my duty by a cursed Frencher and a foe at that. He's far more heart
                  and courage than I have, and risks for an enemy what I dared not for a friend,"
                  and the ominous black rifle was raised quickly and fired with true aim.</p>
               <p>"He's dead, and may God pardon the deed," as the sergeant fell at the shot. "I've
                  saved MacPherson two good hours of agony and mutilation. Back! Chief, back! and
                  make straight for the Monongahela!"</p>
               <p>It was not long before their practised eyes noted that there was no pursuit—not
                  even a suspicion. Never dreaming of a foe so near after the decisive victory of
                  the day, and knowing that the first shot came from Duquesne, and the second from
                  the same direction, the enraged savages naturally credited it with both.</p>
               <p>When, therefore, the Indians were embarking in their canoes, Scarooyaddy rested on
                  his paddle, while Jack reloaded, and then both, with quick and vigorous stroke,
                  pushed boldly across the broad belt of light, actually joining in the line of
                  canoes coming from the island, and as noisy and apparently as excited as any of
                  them.</p>
               <p>As they approached near the shore, and when in the shadow and out of range of the
                  dying fires, by a dexterous turn of their paddles their canoe was made to shoot
                  out of line and to proceed on up the Allegheny</p>

               <p>THEIR course was now quiet and cautious. They were environed by grave perils, and
                  it needed cool heads, steady hands and brave hearts to steer clear of trouble, but
                  all these our scouts possessed, and soon they came abreast, and then passed
                  Shannopins town—a long, straggling village of Captain Pipe, the noted Delaware
                  Chief, and situated just below what is now known as "Two-Mile Run."</p>
               <p>Just above the head of the island—on which two years before Washington and Gist
                  were nearly frozen to death—now known as Wainwrights—the two quietly made a
                  landing, and earnestly counselled together as to the next step.</p>
               <p>It was now very late in the night and little hope of accomplishing much. The first
                  thing to be done was to ascertain of a surety Marie's presence, and then manage an
                  interview and, if possible, plan an escape,</p>
               <p>As the two scouts—rifles and knives held in readiness—cautiously and stealthily
                  approached the village, they heard the tum-tum-tum of the rude Indian drum, and
                  the wild chants of crazy revellers. This was to be expected on the night after so
                  great a victory, and Scarooyaddy knew at once that almost the whole village would
                  be celebrating the <emph>scalp</emph> and the <emph>victory</emph> dances.</p>
               <p>The sounds and lights came from a thick grove of maples and sycamores—which trees
                  here grew of great size and luxuriance—situate some distance off towards the
                  hills.</p>
               <p>It was therefore determined that the Half-King should boldly enter the village and
                  try and discover Pipe's lodge, where it was supposed Marie would be found. Jack
                  was to await his report at the foot of a huge buttonwood, which, with its whitened
                  trunk and exposed roots, stood bending over the mouth of the run.</p>
               <p>The wary old Indian advanced as rapidly as the dark would admit, and after passing
                  a sort of little clearing found himself on the very edge of the village. It was as
                  expected; the place appeared deserted—nothing but here and there a barking and
                  yelping dog.</p>
               <p>The Half-King strode along at an easy and indifferent gait until he saw a light
                  coming from a log cabin about the middle of the straggling hamlet. This he judged
                  to be Pipe's. Hearing female voices within, he slipped quietly around to the back
                  of the lodge and unhesitatingly applied his eye to one of the chinks.</p>
               <p>A gleam of satisfaction lighted up his swarthy visage, as he found his
                  expectations confirmed. There, sure enough, were the objects of his search. Marie
                  was reclining on a sort of low couch covered by a panther's skin, while on another
                  robe at her feet, her arms resting on Marie's lap, and her young, girlish face
                  turned to that of her companion with a tender, wistful look in which sorrow and
                  sympathy were mingled with love, sat Wau-ki-na.</p>
               <p>It was a group to exact the warmest admiration for its<pb n="348-349"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000180"/> grace and beauty, and would have interested even a
                  less impressible person than the noble old chief. Marie's picturesque dress was
                  rumpled and disordered from her late journeys. Her luxuriant hair, escaped from
                  its fastenings, fell in heavy masses about her shoulders. Her face looked
                  inexpressibly sad, while the unbidden tear stood in her eyes. She appeared jaded,
                  fearful and restless. While "her fingers were playing with the dark tresses of the
                  affectionate young beauty at her feet, it was plain her mind was far, far away,
                  and every now and then, as the bark of dog or sound of distant voice was heard,
                  she would give a little start and look of eager expectancy, and then would appear
                  sadder and more anxious than before.</p>
               <p>Unhappily, the two were not alone. On a husk mat near the door sat, or rather
                  reclined, two hideous, devilish-looking old hags of squaws, smoking their pipes of
                  unsavory sumach, crooning and croaking and gossiping together; their wicked eyes,
                  though now dull and heavy, were yet still sleepless and watchful.</p>
               <p>Little hope of doing much this night, and yet the grim old chief stood still and
                  patient, fixed as though cut in stone; his ears inclined to catch the faintest
                  whisper from within, or the slightest noise indicative of danger from without. And
                  now Marie in soft, saddened tones, resumed her conversation.</p>
               <p>"Well, my dearest child, no use to sorrow longer for me. I know you grieve much
                  more than you are glad that I am here, but it was your father's doing, and I now
                  believe for <emph>your</emph> sake. I still have hope, although all
                     <emph>does</emph> seem against it. If Edward only is safe, however, I feel he
                  will not desert me."</p>
               <p>"Me, too, Miss Marie, will not desert you," came in a low tone. "If your Edward
                  come for you, me help you go—yes, me go with you. Wau-ki-na hate this place and
                  these Indians, since she know you. Wont you take her with you?" arid Wau-ki-na
                  caught Marie's hands and looked with earnest pleading eyes into her face.</p>
               <p>"Hush-h-h. That would be very wrong. 'Tis not <emph>me</emph> you should love
                  most, nor Edward, but—"</p>
               <p>"No use, my dear, good lady. Wau-ki-na go with you and Edward, if you no drive me
                  back."</p>
               <p>"Alas! Edward may be even now among the dead. 'Twas a fearful day, or," as an
                  expression of sadness mixed with fear, flitted over her face, "he may not come at
                  all."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, Wau-ki-na be your Edward. She do all she know to make her friend
                  happy—go in woods and on water with her; gather flowers, shoot and paint the
                  beautiful birds, find the honey and wood apples—anyting—everyting, but leave
                  you."</p>
               <p>"I've no doubt you'd do all you could, pretty maiden," answered Marie, smiling
                  sadly; "but when did you say the prisoner was to become Nymwha's son?"</p>
               <p>"Morrow, and right over on yonder island. All go to see him. He very merry,
                  handsome young brave—very, very kind to Wau-ki-na—like to stay with her very
                  much," a bright flush she knew not of mantling her young cheek.</p>
               <p>"And do you like <emph>him,</emph> Wau-ki-na? He's but a stranger to you, and you
                  can't understand all he says."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes," casting her eyes down, and speaking more gently, she knew not why.
                  "Wau-ki-na understand very well. He teach her English and look so sweetly out of
                  his two large eyes—eyes just like a fawn's, Miss Marie. Wau-ki-na like him
                  very—quite much. He make very nice Indian chief, noting like"—with a disdainful,
                  contemptuous glance which well became her brown face—"de rough and noisy Mohigans
                  and Shawanos' young men. Wau-ki-na can't bear dem—wont speak to dem."</p>
               <p>"Why, how you run on, Wau-ki-na, girl? Have a care<pb n="350-351"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000181"/> that the handsome young Englishman don't steal away
                  your heart."</p>
               <p>"Oh, my dear lady," with a puzzled, frightened loot, pressing Marie's hands tight
                  between her own little ones, "he wouldn't do dat ting. He very good and kind to
                  Wau-ki-na—say such pretty words and look so loving from his eyes. Oh, no! no! me
                  not afraid. You must come with Wau-ki-na early to-morrow and she show you place
                  she always sit and sing and take swim bath—<emph>away</emph> up on the little run,
                  where the laughing water come tumbling down and make music all the time. Wont
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, I'll go with you,"Marie answered, the sad, weary, wistful look again
                  upon her face, "but—"</p>
               <p>Just at this moment an approaching tumult of sharp, angry whoops caught the
                  Half-King's wary ear. He rightly thought it was the return of the party of baffled
                  and maddened Delawares who had gone down to the torture scene, and which was so
                  unexpectedly ended by Jack's shot. He had heard and mainly understood the
                  conversation of the two girls, and once even his stern, iron features relaxed into
                  a grim kind of smile as Wau-ki-na's innocence was so plainly betrayed in
                  confidential words; but he was a listener only so far as he might help his friend,
                  and having obtained a clue which he thought of service, he now retreated as
                  quickly and as quietly as he came. He passed unchallenged—unnoticed even, except
                  by the Indian dogs, which occasionally barked at his heels. He found Jack chafing
                  and fretting with impatience and just about to go in search of him.</p>
               <p>"Well, Chief, back at last!—thought you'd never, never come. Out with it, man!—did
                  you find her? Where is she? how does she look? and what does she say? quick!
                  quick!"</p>
               <p>The Half-King now rapidly and carefully related all he had seen and heard, and
                  both agreed that they would watch the next morning for Marie up the run, judging
                  rightly that after a day and night of such excitement the Delawares would sleep
                  late.</p>
               <p>So far all was in their favor. The presence of Wau-ki-na would trouble them
                  somewhat, but they hoped to find some moment when the two would be separated, or,
                  if this were not possible, then to make the young Indian maiden a confidante and
                  even an accomplice.</p>
               <p>The two now sought their canoe, concealed it carefully among the bushes at the
                  mouth of the run, and then Scarooyaddy, who was perfectly familiar with the whole
                  region, led the way to the hilltop and pointed out a safe and secluded shelter for
                  the night. Before sleep closed their eyes, the two scouts had arranged all the
                  details of the escape.</p>
               <p>After the terrible fatigues of the day, they slept on their couch of grass and
                  leaves long and soundly, and it was not until the sun was high in the heavens that
                  they ate their frugal meal of jerked venison and army bread, which they carried in
                  their hunting pouches. Of course they dared neither shoot nor build a fire.</p>
               <p>Instead of returning to the village bottom, the scouts made their way along the
                  hill cone until they overlooked the valley through which the run took its course.
                  Into it they descended, very warily and stealthily gliding from tree to tree. At
                  last the noisy little stream was reached, and along its margin and beneath the
                  dense covert of trees and bushes which lined it on either side, the Half-King led
                  the way to the appointed trysting place, a full half mile from the village.</p>
               <p>The old Chief knew it well, and Wau-ki-na could not have selected a more
                  picturesque or secluded retreat. At this point the noisy and rapid little
                  stream—which then flowed full from recent rains—poured over quite a fall of rocks,
                  its foaming and agitated waters being collected into<pb n="352-353"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000182"/> a deep rocky basin at their foot. Over this deep
                  pool the thick foliage of the trees overarched, while among them, and hanging in
                  graceful festoons from their branches, twined luxuriant grape vines and creepers.
                  The undergrowth of bush and vine and trailer was so dense and matted on both
                  sides, that scarce did even the sun's rays ever penetrate.</p>

               <p>IT was, then, this cool and sequestered nook which Wau-ki-na called her own. Here
                  she was accustomed to come and sit and muse; weave her flowers and grasses, and
                  bead her leggings and moccasins. To this shaded basin, in company with other
                  Delaware girls—but more frequently alone—did she retire to bathe in the fresh,
                  limpid waters, or to sit on the mossy tree trunk, which, gradually undermined by
                  the widening pool, lay stretched right alongside the murmuring cascade.</p>
               <p>Jack surveyed the spot with undisguised admiration, and could not help but think
                  more kindly and tenderly of the young girl who had so long been Marie's companion,
                  and whom both so much esteemed. He now, with that natural desire every lover has
                  to look attractive in his lady's eyes, carefully washed off all traces of paint,
                  undid his hair, and made himself look as comely as possible. Taking position
                  behind a dense covert of laurel and vines, he and the Indian then waited and
                  waited, but with very different feelings.</p>
               <p>Finally their patience was rewarded. In the distance<pb n="354-355"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000183"/> could be seen the two girls, arm in arm, picking
                  their way along the margin of the stream and engaged in an animated conversation,
                  Wau-ki-na, however, being the chief talker. Soon the sad tones of Marie's gentle
                  voice fell upon Jack's listening ear and thrilled along every tell-tale nerve of
                  his body. Now a musical little ripple of a laugh was heard from Wau-ki-na's lips,
                  as she pointed out, with expressive gesture, this or that point of interest.</p>
               <p>The graceful, engaging little Indian maid never appeared to more advantage. She
                  seemed desirous of doing all she could to banish Marie's sadness and make her feel
                  at home. Her dark, brunette face was all smiles and dimples, and as her little
                  moccasined feet stepped daintily from stone to stone, and as her broken but dulcet
                  English was carried to Jack's attentive ears, he scarce knew which to admire
                  most—Wau-ki-na, or her more matured but none the less beautiful companion.</p>
               <p>At last the two were cozily seated, Wau-ki-na gracefully doing the honors. Jack,
                  who stood above them breathless and agitated on the rocks which shut in the little
                  pool, hesitated to reveal himself. He hoped that soon he would have opportunity of
                  seeing Marie alone and of telling her his plan of escape. He could scarcely help
                  being a listener—to say that he was an unwilling one would, perhaps, be going too
                  far.</p>
               <p>"And this," said Marie, "is your snug, sylvan retreat? Well, Wau-ki-na, you
                  couldn't have picked a more lovely spot. 'Tis fit for the home of either
                  wood-nymph or water-sprite. No wonder you are happy."</p>
               <p>"Wau-ki-na happy once—no more so now if Marie go. She no like pretty much Indian
                  life, and tink of many ting—my dear Marie, Mr. Talbot and Edward."</p>
               <p>"Edward," quickly answered Marie, "and why do you think of him? You never saw him
                  but twice."</p>
               <p>"Seems to Wau-ki-na as if she had seen him many, many times. He like a dream to
                  her. Make her tink of mother, long, long dead."</p>
               <p>Jack should have retired just here or else made his presence known, but he could
                  not—the conversation interested him too deeply.</p>
               <p>"Oh, nonsense! child," replied Marie. "I have already told Edward that you had a
                  look about you that strangely reminded <emph>me</emph> of <emph>his</emph> mother,
                  but how he could remind <emph>you</emph> of <emph>your</emph> mother I can't
                  understand."</p>
               <p>"Me don't know—can't tell," pensively answered Wau-ki-na; "but, when he is wid
                  you, I feel as though he belonged to me."</p>
               <p>"Why, Wau-ki-na, this is madness—folly! Don't talk any more that way. I've known
                  Edward from a boy, and his mother and sisters. There was one dark-haired,
                  dark-hued little girl, whom Edward loved very dearly; but she was murdered by
                  cruel Indians with all the rest—not one left. He used to fairly dote on this dear,
                  toddling little girl, whose body he never could find with the others. I remember
                  as it were yesterday," Marie continued, tenderly, as if recalling the past to
                  herself, "a child's hymn he taught her, and which this little girl used to sing
                  after him so sweetly, and with such broken, child-like accents that it was a treat
                  to listen to her. Do you know what a hymn is, Wau-ki-na?"</p>
               <p>"You told Wau-ki-na dat it was a song of love to the Great Spirit."</p>
               <p>"And would you like to hear a verse of this little hymn of Edward's sister,
                  Lucy?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Lucy, Lucy,</emph>" softly repeated Wau-ki-na to herself, as if dreamily
                  struggling to recall a name or thought about escaping from her; "Wau-ki-na has
                  heard that word—seems like an old, old name."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you heard Edward say it the other day, Wau-ki-na,<pb n="356-357"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000184"/> when he was telling me of the murder of his mother
                  and sisters."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Lucy, Lucy.</emph> May be so, but long before dat, me tink. Will dear Marie
                  sing Wau-ki-na the little Spirit song? She loves so much to hear her Marie
                  sing."</p>
               <p>"It went something like this," and Marie's eyes filled with tears as she commenced
                  to sing, in broken accents: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Dear Father, may a little child,</l>
                        <l>Humble and weak, approach Thy throne?"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Why—why—Ma—Marie!" here broke in the greatly agitated Wau-ki-na, who, as soon as
                  her companion had commenced to sing, sat breathless and trembling, a flush on her
                  face and a strange bewildered look in her eyes; "Wau-ki-na know dat. Listen!" and
                  she took up the tune, and sweetly sang these lines: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Jesus, the Saviour, on us smiled,</l>
                        <l>Asked us to come—called us His own."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"My God, Wau-ki-na, what <emph>can</emph> this mean? Where heard you those lines
                  and that tune? It cannot—you are not—why—"</p>
               <p>At this moment a noise and rush was heard from behind them, and Jack appeared
                  before the two startled girls, and caught Wau-ki-na in his arms, crying out, "Why,
                  Marie, <emph>dear</emph> Marie, don't you see? It's Lucy, my little sister Lucy;
                  she whom I thought dead, but whose body I could never find. 'Tis as I ever
                  suspected, Captain Pipe was the murderer of my mother. Oh, my dear, long-lost
                  sister," and Jack's bosom heaved with sobs, while his eyes rained tears. Taking up
                  again the frightened, trembling girl, who seemed bereft of all sense and motion,
                  he held her off and gazed intently into her eyes: he then commenced lifting away
                  from her temple the long black hair.</p>
               <p>"Here, Marie; why here's the very scar. Don't you remember in Philadelphia when
                  the hatchet flew off the handle and gave Lucy such a frightful wound? Here's the
                  very place, Marie."</p>
               <p>No answer. Marie, overcome by the double shock of his sudden presence, and the
                  strange discovery which was not yet fully understood, had sunk, down to the ground
                  in a swoon.</p>
               <p>"My God, what have I done? Fool that I was to come on them this clumsy, crazy way.
                  Have I killed them both? Here, Chief! Chief! come quick!" and Jack caught the
                  fallen Marie in his arms, while the Half-King, who had also descended and just
                  then come round upon the scene, lifted some water in his hand and dashed it into
                  her face.</p>
               <p>Poor Wau-ki-na was gradually recovering from her shock. During this touching scene
                  she had stood passive, trembling, speechless—carried away by the suddenness and
                  import of the disclosure. Then she had burst out into hysterical sobs and tears,
                  but now, when she saw Marie helpless in Jack's arms, she shyly advanced, caught
                  hold of her brother's arms, gently laid her burning cheek against his and
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Wau-ki-na no Indian at all; she Edward's little sister Lucy. She feel it
                  here,"—placing her hand over her heart. "It's all true. Lucy old name—new name.
                  Captain Pipe very bad Indian. Wau-ki-na now hate him—he kill my mother and
                  sister." Then seating herself beside Marie, and leaning her friend's head against
                  her own throbbing bosom, she murmured: "Me love my broder very, very much."</p>
               <p>The whole scene, with its rapidly shifting events, beggars all description Even
                  the old stoic, Scarooyaddy, was deeply moved. He actually turned away to hide his
                  emotion, and had never a word to utter. Jack, overcome by the blow he had
                  inflicted on Marie, was also, in his turn,<pb n="358-359"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000185"/> bereft of speech, and could only gaze dumbly into
                  Marie's face.</p>
               <p>At length, as she gave sign of returning consciousness, the Half-King—as much from
                  motives of delicacy as from a timely caution—went a few hundred yards down the
                  valley, to see that all was safe and no prowlers about.</p>
               <p>Marie soon opened her eyes; the color came and went in her cheeks; a long-drawn
                  sigh escaped her; she looked first at Jack, then at Wau-ki-na; smiled, and closed
                  her eyes again, murmuring:</p>
               <p>"Thank God! Thank God!"</p>
               <p>"Marie! dear Marie!" at length said Jack; "can you ever, ever forgive my cruel
                  awkwardness? I forgot entirely that you could not have known my presence, but
                  thought only of my long-lost little Lucy,"—twining his arm around the waist of his
                  happy sister, and looking at her fondly and proudly.</p>
               <p>"Easily, Edward, easily, for the great joy you bring with you," replied Marie, now
                  sitting up and smiling from very gladness; "but oh, it was a terrible shock!—to
                  find you living, then here, and then Wau-ki-na to be your own sister. Did I not
                  tell you, Edward, how she often strangely reminded me of your mother? And to
                  think, too, how the discovery was made—by a little infant's hymn. How marvellous
                  is the power of association and the tenacity of memory. One can never forget. No
                  wonder, my dear Wau-ki-na, the name of Lucy brought back the past to you. Oh, I'm
                  too, too happy! If only my dear father had lived to know all this. There can be no
                  doubt, can there, Edward?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, not in the least! The only wonder is that we never discovered her before, but
                  I never once thought of Lucy as among the living."</p>
               <p>"And then," said Marie, "she's naturally so dark and her hair's so very black and
                  the Indian language and costume tume and all; but Wau-ki-na, love, did you ever
                  see Pipe have anything peculiar?—I mean anything which ever belonged to your
                  dress?"</p>
               <p>"Noting but dis pretty ting," eagerly answered Wau-ki-na, drawing from her bosom a
                  locket containing some fine grey hair, and the initials "E. G." engraved beneath.
                  "My fader—no, <emph>not</emph> fader,"—with indignation, and stamping her little
                  foot imperiously—"but dat bad Indian, Captain Pipe, hang it here dis very day to
                  wear."</p>
               <p>"Give it me!" hastily exclaimed Jack. "Why, Wau—Lucy, I mean—'tis <emph>our</emph>
                  dear mother's own hair, and these are her initials! Ellen Graham was her maiden
                  name," and he turned away to conceal his feelings.</p>
               <p>It were useless to repeat the long, confidential conversation which followed. No
                  further need for making a stranger of Wau-ki-na, and it was beautiful to see Jack
                  sitting with Marie and Wau-ki-na—as we must still continue to call her—the
                  latter's little nut-brown hand resting in Jack's, and her eyes every now and then
                  shyly and timidly stealing up to his swart and bearded face, as if to make sure it
                  was not all a fleeting dream. She was too full for words—could not yet realize the
                  great change which had come to her—could scarcely comprehend it. Her eyes would
                  now gladden, and now moisten with tears. Now she would clutch her brother's arm
                  and nestle close up to his side, as if fearing to lose him, and anon she would
                  gaze at him with a look of awe and fear.</p>
               <p>But gradually all reserve wore away. They talked fully of the past and then of the
                  present. And Marie related how, while fitting at her father's grave, the noise of
                  the battle and the yells of the Indians grew louder and nearer, and that, finally
                  becoming aware of the confusion at the ford, she was just preparing to go to the
                  cabin for news, when she found herself suddenly surrounded by several Indians, led
                  by Pipe. It was too late for outcry or escape.<pb n="360-361"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000186"/> Pipe was quite pleasant with her; offered no
                  violence, but said the battle had gone against the English; that Wau-ki-na was sad
                  and restless, mourning for her, and that she must immediately mount her horse and
                  accompany him. This she found herself compelled to do, and hoping the trail would
                  be followed by Edward, she had thrown back her glove. Jack, in his turn, told how
                  shocked he was at finding her gone; how the Chief had found the glove, enabling
                  them to trace her right into Pipe's lodge, and how the little waterfall, then
                  foaming and dashing before them, happened to be the place for so happy a meet and
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">dénouement.</foreign> It was all considered a most
                  delightful ending of all their troubles, and much was hoped for the future.</p>
               <p>When Scarooyaddy returned, he was taken into council, and it was agreed that the
                  escape should be attempted that very night, and by canoe, as being far easier for
                  women, and as offering no trail for pursuers.</p>
               <p>The details were now all carefully arranged, so that there might be neither error
                  of omission nor commission Jack and the Half-King were to lie concealed all day
                  and to have the canoe—which fortunately happened to be amply large enough for the
                  whole party—ready at early dark at the mouth of the run, which taking an abrupt
                  turn past the village emptied into the Allegheny at some distance up. Talbot, if
                  possible, was to be included in the escape, and Wau-ki-na was to go over as
                  intended, and as if nothing had happened, to the opposite island and witness his
                  adoption into Nymwha's tribe.</p>
               <p>The young lord was to be quietly told all by Wau-ki-na, so that he could conduct
                  himself accordingly, and then he was to get permission from Nymwha to take canoe
                  and visit Wau-ki-na, or failing that, to be ready at the very point of the island
                  to be picked up. The two girls were likewise to steal off about twilight, as if to
                  take an evening walk, secreting, if possible, provisions for the journey.</p>
               <p>"And now, Marie, and my sweet little Indian sister," said Jack rising, "the Chief
                  and I must bid you a brief farewell, and climb yonder hill again, Marie, keep you
                  close in Pipe's lodge all day, and Lucy—oh that precious name again—you had better
                  go straight to the island, and be very cautious in telling Talbot. Good-bye, and
                  may God aid us all!"</p>
               <p>So saying, Jack pressed Marie's hand and gave his sister a parting embrace, and
                  then at once—preceded by the Half-King—strode rapidly away and was soon lost to
                  sight.</p>
               <p>The two girls stood for some little time still and motionless. It seemed to be all
                  a pleasant dream, which had now commenced to vanish. Turning at last, Marie found
                  Wau-ki-na, her eyes looking yearningly and her hands stretched imploringly towards
                  the hill, as if pleading for a brother's protection. Giving her a warm and long
                  kiss, the two girls, their arms entwined in a mutual embrace, turned back towards
                  the Indian village.</p>

                  Indians; about to be adopted into a savage tribe; Braddock's army scattered to the
                  four winds; a hundred miles of pathless forest between him and the English
                  settlements, and thousands more between him and <emph>home</emph>—all this gave
                  cause for gloom, and tears almost unbidden came to his eyes as he thought of his
                  forlorn and desolate situation and the sorrowful prospect before him.</p>
               <p>"Blessed," says the immortal Sancho Panza, "be the man who first invented sleep,"
                  and balmy, blissful sleep gradually stole over the youthful prisoner, sealing the
                  sorrow-laden eye, unlocking the thronging memory, bringing the "oil of gladness
                  for the spirit of heaviness," and proving, indeed, as rich a blessing to him as it
                  has before and since, to myriads of other weary and perplexed mortals. It soon
                  carried oblivion—better yet, bright and happy dreams. His fancy wandered to the
                  lordly domains and palatial manor of his father, the baronet. He was again, after
                  his many wanderings, surrounded with all he loved, and all who loved him. A
                  brightness stole over his countenance; a sweet smile played about his mouth, and
                  the names of Mother and Wau-ki-na became somehow ever blended in his disordered
                  murmurings.</p>
               <p>The day was quite advanced, when a rude knocking shook him out of his long
                  slumbers. He awakened refreshed, hopeful, and almost gay again. So much had sleep,
                  the enchanter, done for him. Captain de Liguery stood before him, flanked on the
                  one side by an orderly with coffee and refreshments, and on the other by the
                  grinning, good-humored phiz of Nymwha, the Shawnee Chief, coming to claim him for
                  his son.</p>
               <p>For a moment Talbot's heart sank again within him, but hopes of a speedy escape
                  and the natural spirits of youth, caused him to brighten up immediately as he bade
                  the Frenchman a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bon jour,</foreign> and extended his hand
                  to Nymwha, who covered it with one of his huge paws and shook it almost to
                  dislocation.</p>
               <p>"Well, Father—for so, I suppose, I must begin to call you—how are the Madames
                  Nymwha and all the little he and she Nymwhas—as dirty and good-for-nothing as
                  usual, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>The old Indian's bony cave of a mouth opened wider and wider, and his portentous
                  grin shot from ear to ear.</p>
               <p>"Me no much understand pale-face speech, but all welly well. Me have no one, two,
                  three squaw—jis one," holding<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7175-00000188"/> up a
                  long, bony, and not very clean talon, and shaking his head and leering with his
                  eye the while, in a very droll and comical manner.</p>
               <p>"Just one—that's bad: so much loveliness wasted on one squaw, and when do you want
                  me, Nymwha?"</p>
               <p>"Now—this vely morning. All two Indian towns waiting. Heap of Shawnees and
                  Delawares come to see you. Make little 'Two-scalps' great big chief; not big
                     <emph>so,</emph>" resting his paternal paw on Talbot's head as he read aright
                  the incredulous smile in his eyes: "but big <emph>so,</emph>" beating his own
                  broad and brawny breast with his clenched hand till it sounded something like a
                  dilapidated base drum—"big heart, brave warrior, great chief and Medicine—"</p>
               <p>"But, Nymwha, I don't <emph>want</emph> to be your son. I've as much father and
                  mother and big wigwam across the great water, as I care for. Would you wish me to
                  commit <emph>bigamy?</emph>" looking earnestly and somewhat fiercely into the
                  chiefs eyes.</p>
               <p>"No understand <hi rend="i"/>mitbigmy—not Shawnee word. Listen! Nymwha had
                  son—great warrior. His son killed—wigwam empty. Little 'Two-scalps' take him
                  place; be a dear, good boy; he eat, shoot, take many scalp, marry Indian squaw,
                  and have—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes; thanks, I know; all very enticing, and 'tis devlish hard to give it up,
                  but wouldn't much paint and blankets and powder and two new guns be better than a
                  little fellow like me, Nymwha? I'd rather go to my own home and live with my own
                  father."</p>
               <p>"What!" loudly answered the grim old Shawnee, in a disdainful manner, an
                  incredulous look breaking out in spots over his impassive, parchment-like face;
                  "go away from Chiefs wigwam and the big woods, with plenty fish, and honey, and
                  raccoon, and possum and bear—no work like squaw, but shoot, shoot, all day, and
                  sleep, sleep all night, and—"</p>
               <p>"Enough, Nymwha; you've won me, but suppose I run away?"</p>
               <p>A look of utter wonder before the Chief answered.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Can't</emph> go 'way from great Chief's wigwam. You too big fool if do so.
                  If little 'Two-scalps' run off Nymwha catch him, cut him into little, little bits,
                  and put him in pot with hominy," and Nymwha's face crimpled up into broad wrinkles
                  of fun and merriment at the exquisite humor of the conceit.</p>
               <p>"Don't think I'd do well as a broth, Nymwha—am positive I wouldn't mix kindly with
                  corn. I might prove palatable but very indigestible to Mrs. N and the children,
                  but if I <emph>have</emph> to go, gentle Father, lead the way! I'm ready," and
                  Talbot, his meal now finished, passed out towards the drawbridge, his stalwart
                  papa just behind and looking down on him in the most absurdly bland and
                  patronizing manner.</p>
               <p>Just at this moment, Smith, accompanied by Tecaugkretanego, a noble and
                  dignified-looking chief, came up to bid him good-bye. The young man looked very,
                  very sad, and the tears actually stood in his eyes as he pressed Talbot's hands in
                  the most affectionate manner. "Come! come! Jimmy, this will never do, my boy; we
                  must keep up a brave heart, if for nothing else than to spite these cursed
                  frog-eaters. Blamed if I wouldn't rather be Nymwha's than Dumas' captive; I would,
                  by jove, and especially after last night's doings."</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't care so much, Mr. Talbot," lugubriously answered Smith, "if we were
                  only going together, for I've come to like and to—to depend on you so much. You've
                  ever, somehow, such a light merry heart."</p>
               <p>"Pooh, pooh, Jimmy! I'm far, far sadder than I look; but I'd rather die than show
                  that just now to these conceited Frenchers. Besides, you know, James, I've one
                  advantage over you; while you're going away from your<pb n="366-367"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000189"/> sweetheart, I'm about to hunt mine up; and now,
                  good-bye, old fellow, and take this to remember me by;" as Talbot secretly slipped
                  into Smith's unwilling hand his fine compass—at that time quite a rarity. "Now,
                  not one word, lad! you <emph>must</emph> take it; may we soon meet again;" and
                  Talbot turned his back on his friend, who went to what afterwards proved a five
                  years' captivity.</p>
               <p>Many of the French soldiers, knowing what was about to happen, were standing
                  around as if undesignedly. On their faces could easily be seen an expression of
                  both respect and sympathy. Some of them even ventured to testify their
                  appreciation of the act for which he was arrested, by coming up and pressing his
                  hand.</p>
               <p>While just upon the drawbridge, Talbot turned to de Lignery and said in
                  French:</p>
               <p>"Were it not for your Commandant, Captain, I would be glad to say '<foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">au revoir.</foreign>' I'm sure he'll not trouble himself to bid
                  me farewell and I don't want him to. I've met many brave Frenchmen in this fort—I
                  am constrained to believe Dumas himself is or was one, as I learn he took the
                  gallant Beaujeu's place when he had fallen, and won, against great odds, the
                  strangest battle and the most complete victory of modern times—but excuse me for
                  saying, I've nothing now but contempt for him; he lacks <emph>moral</emph>
                  courage, sir; and I not only brand him to you as having a heart of stone, but as
                  having, also, a heart of hare. He's an arrant coward, sir; I've told
                     <emph>him</emph> as much to his face and so may tell you to his back. I've
                  flung down my glove before him, but my challenge still remains unaccepted."</p>
               <p>"I must no longer listen to you, milord," expostulated de Lignery; "it would be
                  ungentlemanly and disrespectful to my superior officer. You—"</p>
               <p>"I tell you, Captain," eagerly interrupted Talbot, "he's base coin—has not the
                  genuine ring about him. The indignities he allowed his painted savages to inflict
                  on <emph>me</emph> are nothing—I can readily forgive them—but the fiendish and
                  inhuman tortures he has permitted, under his own eyes and almost under the very
                  shadow of King Louis' flag, on a lot of poor, defenceless, unfortunate prisoners
                  of war, I can never—God <emph>may</emph> never—forgive. He did that yesterday
                  which will make his nights hideous for a lifetime. I know not what Frenchman he
                  was who made good my false shot, but whoever he is, he's a <emph>man,</emph> every
                  inch of him, and God will bless him, and so, good-bye; and now, Nymwha, lead
                  on!"</p>
               <p>Talbot turned and raised his chapeau to the group of French officers and soldiers
                  who crowded the gateway, just as the mournful "dead march"—as played by the fort
                  band accompanying the party sent out to bring in the body of Captain Beaujeu—could
                  be heard in the distance. He walked rapidly down to the beach of the Allegheny,
                  and was about stepping into Nymwha's four-paddle birch—his canoe of State—when a
                  soft, sweet voice was heard from the bluff—of course in the French tongue:</p>
               <p>"Why, milord Talbot, you're not going to leave me without just one little word of
                  farewell, are you? This is not nice of you" (ce n'est pas gentil,) and the
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">petite,</foreign> and pretty Mademoiselle Fleury, with
                  quite a bundle under her arm, bustled her way down to the shingle beach,</p>
               <p>Talbot turned quickly and clasped her proffered hand. "Why, my dear mademoiselle,
                  this is <emph>too</emph> kind of you. I <emph>did</emph> think of you but never
                  supposed you would think of <emph>me,</emph> a poor prisoner, especially since the
                  last time I saw you, I was guilty of very rude and saucy words, for which I most
                  humbly ask pardon."</p>
               <p>"Pooh, pooh, milord!" pouted out the little damsel, in the most liquid of French,
                  a tear actually begemming each eye. "I pray you don't mention it—'twas nothing;
                  and so you're going away among the cruel Indians, whom<pb n="368-369"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000190"/> I so abhor and detest? Your shot last night, let me
                  tell you, my friend, is the talk of the whole fort, and if my father and the
                  garrison had <emph>their</emph> way, they would now be firing the big guns for
                  you. You did a noble and merciful act, and the good God will surely reward it, and
                  so we think all."</p>
               <p>It was Talbot's turn now to show emotion. There was a choking in his throat and a
                  tremble in his voice, as he answered:</p>
               <p>"Mademoiselle, this is as unexpected as it is grateful to me. You see, it quite
                  unmans me. I go much more content since I know the respect and sympathy of even my
                  country's foes are with me."</p>
               <p>"Well, milord, I must not detain you. Old Nymwha," smiling archly through her
                  tears, "is getting up a terrible scowl on his face—thinks I want to steal away his
                  son. Adieu! adieu! Keep up a brave, merry heart. You'll be free soon; we'll buy
                  you off, I <emph>know</emph> we will; or if not, I'll see you often, as we'll be
                  neighbors, wont we? And here, take this," thrusting the bundle into his reluctant
                  hands and answering his inquiring eyes with an—</p>
               <p>"Oh, never fear! It's nothing—only a few trifles-nick-nacks and ladies' whimsies.
                  They may come in use some time, and once more adieu! adieu!" and the tenderhearted
                  little lady again pressed his hand and walked quickly away, never venturing to
                  look behind.</p>
               <p>Talbot stepped mechanically into the canoe, and sat himself pensively on one of
                  the hickory thwarts. Nymwha gave a powerful shove, the paddlers commenced their
                  monotonous chant, and the light birch darted up the Allegheny.</p>
               <p>It was some little time before Talbot, overcome by his feelings and busy with
                  sorrowful thoughts, observed the course now unexpectedly taken.</p>
               <p>"Why, Nymwha, how's this? I thought your village was on an island several miles
                  down the Ohio, while here we go up the Allegheny,"</p>
               <p>The proud and happy old Indian, having now Talbot, whom he really liked
                  exceedingly, all safe to himself, seemed to smile all over as he said:</p>
               <p>"Little 'Two-scalps' tink true, but Nymwha great, rich chief. He have three
                  villages; one, two on the broad O-hee-yo—one on the Alle-ghen-we. Big fight now
                  done. My young men go next sun far up the Alle-ghen-we. You go, too. Kill much
                  bear, deer, and buffalo. Nymwha's lodge never empty. Fire always burn; the meat
                  and hominy always cook."</p>
               <p>"But how far up is this village of yours, Nymwha?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, welly near—close by—you see. Captain Pipe and Mohican people want to see my
                  new son. We go to island right over river from Shannopins."</p>
               <p>"Shannopins!" excitedly exclaimed Talbot, brightening up amazingly. "Why that's
                  where Wau-ki-na said she lived."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Captain Pipe and Wau-ki-na, the 'Bounding Fawn,' both with Nymwha's
                  people—want welly much to see little 'Two-scalps' made into son."</p>
               <p>"The deuce you say! Why didn't you tell me that before?" eagerly starting forward
                  and reaching for an oar. "I'm tired sitting, Nymwha; let <emph>me</emph> take a
                  paddle."</p>
               <p>"No! no! You'll turn over canoe. See how it go this-a-way, that-a-way; this-a-way,
                  that-a-way—tipsy-topsy. You do nothing till you made into Indian. You look welly
                  glad. <emph>I</emph> glad, too—all over feel good."</p>
               <p>Talbot was fain to take his seat again. In truth, his whole appearance now had
                  changed. His cheeks were flushed, his eyes aglow; a look of glad and eager
                  expectation rested on his handsome face.</p>
               <p>It may as well be stated here that Wau-ki-na had taken a deep hold on the young
                  man's mind—far deeper than he<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7175-00000191"/> himself
                  had any clear idea. He had never stopped to analyze his feelings for the Indian
                  girl, but it was surely no passing whim or idle fancy. Talbot himself may have
                  thought so, but these matters very frequently get beyond one's control, and what
                  is oftentime deemed a transient caprice or a pleasant pastime, turns out to be a
                  deep-rooted heart-passion—an important part of a man's welfare—yes, of his very
                  life, inwrought with every fibre of his being.</p>
               <p>Talbot now bethought him of Miss Fleury's bundle, and on opening it up and
                  searching down into its depths, his eyes softened again at the memory of her
                  delicate attention and thoughtfulness.</p>
               <p>Here was a package of tea, coffee, and salt—there a case of needles and cushion of
                  pins. Now he came on tiny bundles of spices and now upon thread, and buttons, and
                  tape, and scissors—and, of course, a looking-glass. There was a little of
                  everything in this <foreign xml:lang="LAT">omnium gatherum,</foreign> and much
                  that would be of great use to him. None but a lady—and none, perhaps, so well as a
                  French lady—would have had the tact to make such a selection.</p>
               <p>As he quietly and carefully tied up the bundle again, the unuttered thought
                  crossed his mind—strange, passing strange, that away out in this lone wilderness,
                  where he had expected to see nothing but savage beasts or still more savage
                  Indians, his heart had been stirred to its very depths, and that, too, by two
                  women, whom he had known but a few days and of whose very existence even a week
                  ago he had not the slightest knowledge.</p>
               <p>Yet, so it is in life. A wiser and further-seeing intelligence than anything
                  human, happily guides and provides all. When a mortal thinks he is but drifting,
                  he is being directed; nearest a haven, when nothing but storm and wild wave are
                  visible. His strength is weakness, his life death. When he feels safest, ho is
                  most in danger; happiest, on the very edge of some big sorrow; most wretched, in
                  the very presence of the breaking clouds and the rainbow of hope and promise. Our
                  "sincerest laughter with some pain is fraught," and life, humanly considered, is
                  one grand antithesis.</p>

               <p>THE island—now known as "Herr's Island"—on which stood Nymwha's summer village or
                  rather camp, was soon in full sight, and as the canoe rapidly approached, Talbot
                  could distinctly see the low bluffs lined with Indians and, further on, several
                  canoes crowded with Delawares crossing over from Shannopins.</p>
               <p>And now the prow grates upon the sandy beach. Many from the bank—chiefly, however,
                  lads and girls, moved by curiosity to see their new young chief—crowded down upon
                  the canoe.</p>
               <p>Talbot was the target of hundreds of critical eyes. He bore the scrutiny with as
                  much indifference as possible. The smiles and jokes of the curious girls and
                  squaws near by, however, were much harder to endure; but as he stepped from the
                  boat upon the shingle with a <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >quid-times-Cæsarem-vehis</foreign> sort of expression on his fresh and
                  handsome face, he quietly ignored the crowd around, while his eye boldly swept the
                  long line of Indians on the bank above.</p>
               <p>Nymwha, with an air of great importance, now led the way to the bluff. Here he and
                  Talbot were received with grave dignity, by other Shawnee chiefs and warriors. The
                  young Englishman glanced around with eager curiosity. Right behind the grassy mead
                  on which was collected the promiscuous crowd of Shawnees and Delawares, stood the
                  dense and luxuriant forest, which was well cleared of underbrush.</p>
               <p>The rude bark houses and tents were scattered here and there among the beeches,
                  maples, and sycamores, while just on the edge of the woods stood the "Council
                  House," constructed of rough logs. The views from the bank up and down the
                  Allegheny, and over the plains and hills on the thither side of the river, were
                  beautiful and extensive.</p>
               <p>Just here Talbot's roving eye beheld Wau-ki-na, the object of his anxious search,
                  standing alone and leaning against the trunk of a young birch. She looked—compared
                  with others of her sex around—very, very winning. His face lighted up in a
                  wonderful way. His whole manner changed. He gave a nod and made a graceful gesture
                  of recognition, but could not fail to observe, however, that, blended with the
                  look of pleasure and sympathy on her face, there was a <emph>new</emph> expression
                  in her eyes. Her person seemed to have acquired an added dignity, while her
                  speaking countenance fairly beamed with a mysterious something on it which he
                  never had seen before. Not knowing the great change which had come to her, he
                  wondered while he admired.</p>
               <p>Nymwha having stepped into the Council House to make preparations, Talbot tripped
                  lightly to the young beauty's side, took her hand and said earnestly: "Well,
                  Wau-ki-na, you once invited me—here I am. We'll be nearer neighbors than I
                  thought. You don't appear so glad as I am. Has anything happened? Is there—"</p>
               <p>Wau-ki-na touched his arm lightly and said earnestly, but in low tones: "You
                  mustn't speak pretty much to Wau-ki-na now—mustn't even look at her—Mohicans not
                  like it. Do just as Nymwha say. Look glad and make<pb n="374-375"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000193"/> tink you want to be Indian chief. We all go away in
                  canoe this night."</p>
               <p>"Go <emph>where,</emph> Wau-kina? and who the deuce is <emph>all?</emph> What
                  mystery's this?"</p>
               <p>"Why,"—sinking her voice yet lower and speaking very hurriedly—" Edw—Captain Jack
                  and Scarooyaddy and Marie all over on the other side. Canoe at mouth of run little
                  above Shannopins. You ask Nymwha"—and here a little blush mounted up into her
                  face—" let you come see Wau-ki-na this evening;—Edward say for me to tell you
                  this;—if he no let you come, go alone to de very edge of this island"—nodding
                  towards the point meant—"and we gather you up; but <emph>must</emph> come some
                  way."</p>
               <p>Talbot stood breathless and excited.</p>
               <p>"Well, if this isn't the strangest!—you seem in your senses, Kina, but if so, how
                  come <emph>you</emph> to go along? Is Jack going to steal you away from your
                  father? That's not clever in him. Do you really mean what you say, Wau-ki-na?"</p>
               <p>"Yes! yes!"—stamping her little foot impatiently—"don't you see the true in my two
                  eyes? Wau-ki-na no longer my name. I am Lucy, and Captain Jack is my dear
                  broder,"—drawing herself up with pardonable pride and dignity.</p>
               <p>"Whew!" exclaimed Talbot, with a very much puzzled look, and then a soft whistle;
                  "the little girl's clean daft—mad as a March hare. Jack's sister! What next? Who,
                  or what's done this, my poor Wau-ki-na?"</p>
               <p>"Am <emph>no</emph> man's <emph>poor Wau-ki-na,</emph> I tell you for true, but
                  Edward's Lucy. If you no believe,"—a frown on her face and a taunt in her tones—"
                  you stay here and be Nymwha's dear son. Here he come. Remember!" and Wau-kina held
                  up a warning finger and glided rapidly away.</p>
               <p>Talbot stood as if stunned—scarcely knew <emph>what</emph> to think, but could not
                  help trusting Wau-ki-na, she looked so earnest nest and sincere. Just then Nymwha
                  touched him on the shoulder. He turned and saw some young warriors of both tribes
                  scowling ominously at him, evidently sore displeased at his protracted interview
                  with the "Bounding Fawn." His resolve was made to put full faith in her and do as
                  she said; but Jack's sister—that staggered him.</p>
               <p>"All ready now. Little 'Two-scalps' must take off his first hair,"—removing
                  Talbot's curling wig, and exciting first the wonder and then the loud merriment of
                  the on-looking crowd. "Now my son take off his clothes and put on
                  'breech-clout.'"</p>
               <p>"What!" angrily exclaimed Talbot; "wouldn't do that for the King of England! What
                  do you take me for, you copper-colored omadhown?"</p>
               <p>"Nymwha's son must do jus as Nymwha say," grimly replied the old Indian, and with
                  a certain ugly look in his fishy eyes; and Talbot, remembering Wau-ki-na's advice,
                  thought so too, and quietly suffered himself to be disrobed.</p>
               <p>Nymwha then ran his hand over Talbot's cropped hair, shook his head, and said
                  mournfully: "Hair too short to pull out. Can't make any scalp-lock. Every hair
                  ought to be out but little, little bit here. Nymwha <emph>so</emph> sorry;
                  but—brightening up a little—"must wait short while till it long enough to
                  catch."</p>
               <p>"Well, <emph>I'm</emph> plaguy sorry, too, gentle Father; but here's my finger and
                  toe nails, or my back teeth, if they'd be any accommodation to you."</p>
               <p>"Now my young men will put on the war paint. "And this the young men aforesaid
                  proceeded to do, with much more alacrity and enthusiasm than Talbot thought the
                  occasion warranted; but he uttered never a word, and busily put in the time while
                  they were making a striped zebra of him, with ghastly smiles and heavy internal
                  swearing.</p>
               <p>Nymwha waited till it was all completely done; turned Talbot around admiringly;
                  walked about him several<pb n="376" xml:id="VAC7175-00000194"/> times with
                  squinting, critical eyes, just as a connoisseur would inspect a statue, and
                  grunted out:</p>
               <p>"That's vely good—all fort paint. Nymwha's son feel much better, eh?"—with a
                  horrible leer and grin.</p>
               <p>"Ye-s-s, <emph>much</emph> better, thank you, Father—nearly dead, I'm much obliged
                  to you. If there's any paint left, Nymwha, wouldn't it be well to close up my
                  eyes, nose and mouth, and glue all my hair together?"</p>
               <p>"No, no! you too greedy—paint cost many skins."</p>
               <p>Nymwha then threw over Talbot's neck a broad belt of wampum, and huge brass bands
                  about his hands and legs, and then led him out before the crowd and gave the
                     <emph>alarm-halloo,</emph> at which the whole village came running out and
                  stood around. Nymwha then took Talbot by the hand and proceeded to make a tedious
                  speech.</p>
               <p>The modest young lord was in perfect agony. He squirmed around and dropped his
                  eyes, taking a somewhat <hi rend="i"/>Venus-de-Medicis pose, and then—as he heard
                  some twittering among the young people—glared around fiercely at the crowd; then
                  smiled a sickly smile, and finally threw himself into a statuesque position and
                  mentally wished his <emph>real</emph> father could see him just then. He was
                  rapidly forced to the conclusion that if <emph>they</emph> could all stand it,
                     <emph>he</emph> could; but worse yet was to come.</p>
               <p>Nymwha now called up three young squaws, two of whom took Talbot by either hand
                  and led the way down to the river with great solemnity. When they had gone out to
                  where the water was about two or three feet deep—Talbot all this time as red as a
                  lobster with shame and indignation—he turned towards the bluff and saw it lined
                  with spectators. He then gazed as blandly as he could upon his fair tormentors,
                  who looked as if they meant business. He had determined to change his tactics and
                  make a virtue out of necessity.</p>
               <p>"If there is no impropriety in the interrogatory, young<pb n="(Illustration)-377"

                  </figure> ladies, I would ask what you intend to do with me—if I'm to be murdered,
                  I'd like the selection of my mode of death and place of burial."</p>
               <p>The squaws laughed, made signs that he was to wash off the paint, and commenced
                  noisily chattering away like so many magpies.</p>
               <p>"Ladies," smilingly replied Talbot, who, ever since he had time to reflect on
                  Wau-ki-na's message and his near prospect of escape, was fast resuming his natural
                  gaiety and friskiness of spirits,—"Ladies, I respect the natural taciturnity of
                  your sex, and will have to appeal to my father. You may speak Shawnee
                  grammatically and even eloquently, but I'm blest if it isn't all Greek to me.
                  Here, Nymwha!" turning around and shouting up to him, "what does this mean, and
                  what am I to do?"</p>
               <p>"You stand still—they no hurt you! Wash all the white blood out of you. When you
                  come out, all over Indian."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Thank you, Nymwha, but—"</p>
               <p>At that moment his feet were pushed from under him and down he plunged under
                  water, and came up dripping and spluttering and rubbing his eyes. Resolving to
                  take the joke—which he began now thoroughly to appreciate in all its magnitude—he
                  said pleasantly:</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, ladies, for disappearing so abruptly—fact is, I had an appointment
                  down below which I was obliged to keep. What next on the programme?"</p>
               <p>Signs were made that he must rub off the paint, which he at once proceeded to do,
                  swiftly and enthusiastically, the squaws digging their knuckles into his face,
                  back and shoulders. Then, seizing him by the arms, down he went again and again,
                  much to the merriment of the multitude, who shouted and clapped their hands for
                  joy, Nymwha dislocating his jaw in his loud guffaws, which seemed to<pb
                     n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7175-00000196"/> come away up from his moccasins. He was
                  always a hearty laugher, was Nymwha.</p>
               <p>This ducking was repeated several times, until the paint was all off, when Nymwha
                  descended to the water's edge and received him dripping and gasping from the
                  laughing squaws, saying, "White blood all gone—you every bit Shawnee now. How you
                  like it?"</p>
               <p>"Like what, the blood or the washing?" spluttered out Talbot, soon as he could
                  draw a free breath. "If the latter, I may frankly, and I hope without offence,
                  say, I never enjoyed anything so much in all my born days. By jove! was sorry when
                  the bell rang to come out. 'Twas <emph>perfectly splendid.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You did look much better, my son, with much paint—by-by we put on more."</p>
               <p>"Did I? Well now, <emph>I</emph> thought I looked very much like my conception of
                  the devil; but, Nymwha, as one of your own old poets has well remarked," Nil
                  disputandum de gustibus."</p>
               <p>The more grandly and unintelligibly Talbot talked, the better the jocular old
                  chief liked it. He was manifestly as proud of him as a hen is of one chicken, and
                  Talbot humored him whenever he could.</p>
               <p>He was now led up to the Council House again, and there were his Indian clothes
                  for him. They put on him a pair of leggings decked off with beads and feathers;
                  then a pair of dainty little moccasins—an offering from Wau-ki-na's own hands;
                  then a sort of fringed hunting tunic, ornamented with hair and porcupine quills,
                  and fastened in front with bear's teeth, and then a sort of soft cap of skins.</p>
               <p>It must be confessed Talbot looked much better in this full Indian suit than in
                  the torn, shabby and dilapidated clothes he had lately cast off. He himself felt
                  so, for he had been greatly ashamed of the old ones, they were so scuffed and
                  frayed and rent.</p>
               <p>Now they painted afresh his face and neck; seated him on a bear's skin with pipe
                  and kinnekenick; tomahawk, spunk, steel and rifle, and when all was done, Talbot
                  made as neat and handsome a chief as ever led savages to a grand
                  scalp-lifting.</p>

               <p>Now flocked all the chief Indians into the Council House. For some time a profound
                  silence reigned—every one smoking as if his very life depended on it. At length
                  Nymwha arose with great dignity and addressed Talbot in Shawnee, telling him he
                  was now his son and a Shawnee chief, bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh; that
                  by the ceremony in the water every drop of white blood was washed from his veins;
                  that he was admitted into the great and warlike tribe of Shawanos and was adopted
                  into a powerful family, in room of a great "brave," and concluded thus:</p>
               <p>"My dear son, you have nothing more to fear. We are now under the same duty to
                  love, support and defend you that we are to love and defend one another;
                  therefore, you are now and from this forward to consider yourself as one of our
                  people;" and, according to a strong old Indian law and custom, thoroughly tested
                  and proved in innumerable instances in American history, they would have
                  faithfully and constantly kept their word. (See <hi rend="i"/>Appendix Y.)</p>
               <p>As this speech was addressed to him, Talbot could surely do no less, though not
                  one word of it did he understand, than rise and make a profound bow. This he did
                  at the conclusion of each speech that followed. In fact, his new clothes set him
                  off so well, and he looked and acted so like a young "blood" of an aristocratic
                  Indian chiefly family, that old Nymwha was perfectly delighted. He seemed to laugh
                  at every feature, almost at every pore, and the good-natured old sinner shuffled
                  around as if he wished to shake hands with himself at every step. His constant,
                  effervescing happiness gave evidence of a perfectly healthy liver, ever in good
                  working condition.</p>
               <p>The speeches all over, the hilarious and ridiculous old gusher <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">chassèd</foreign> over to where Talbot was sitting, quietly
                  "chewing the cud of sweet and bitter fancy," and giving him a hearty thump on the
                  back—intended to be appreciative and encouraging—said he must say something to his
                  new kin and friends.</p>
               <p>"What! in Shawnee, Nymwha?" plaintively responded Talbot to the thwack, although
                  he felt at that instant more like throttling his venerable and playful papa for
                  the painful shock he had just given him. "Shawnee is a far nobler tongue than
                  Latin or Greek, but I don't yet feel quite so fluent in it that I could
                  extemporize a poem like an <foreign xml:lang="ITA">improvisatore.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"No! no! in English. It good language for great big words—better than Shawnee or
                  Mohigan. All Indians want to hear you make big speech in English—<emph>I</emph> no
                  mind what you say, and Shawnee no understand."</p>
               <p>"Well, Father, if you say <emph>yea,</emph> I must not say <emph>nay.</emph> So
                  here goes for a war speech; but if I'm overcome by my emotion, don't fail to have
                  a stretcher with relays of <emph>our</emph> young men to carry me to my royal
                  couch."</p>
               <p>"Yes, dat's jus it—big round words. Listen! chiefs and warriors, Nymwha's son
                  speaks!"</p>
               <pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7175-00000198"/>
               <p>Talbot now rose up slowly and with great solemnity advanced a few steps, and then
                  glanced deliberately around the expectant circle. He seemed to gather inspiration
                  from the wondering and admiring face of Wau-ki-na, whom he just then saw peeping
                  in at the door.</p>
               <p>Waving his hand majestically, he commenced:</p>
               <p>"Romans, countrymen and lovers!—Big Ingun me! Hear me for my cause, and be silent
                  that you may the better understand! Quousque tandem, O Catilina! abutêre patientiâ
                  nostrâa! Carpe diem, for the tempus is fugiting and forte dux fefellat in gutture.
                  Now is the winter-r-r-r-r of our discontent made gel-l-l-lorious summer by the sun
                  of York, and as one of our greatest and most eloquent poets has most exquisitely
                  said, 'make hay while the sun shines,' and 'time cuts down all, both great and
                  small.'" Then, quietly and impressively, "Nymwha, do the chiefs seem greatly
                  touched?"</p>
               <p>"Me no understan 'touched,' but they struck—a heap: you too still—no jump roun'
                  nuff—more tunder!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, that's it, eh? I think I'll fetch the chiefs now," said Talbot, and giving a
                  sudden and tragical start, which made even Nymwha jump, he hissed out, "Ah-h-h,
                  an' if <emph>thou'lt</emph> mouth, <emph>I'll</emph> rant as well as thou. A
                  horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse! Slave! I've set my life upon a cast and
                  I'll stand the hazard of the die!"</p>
               <p>Then, going up to Nymwha, and taking from him a blanket and a long hunting knife,
                  he looked round on the circle of glittering eyes and parchment faces, and said in
                  the most hollow and sepulchral tones possible: "If you have tears, prepare to shed
                  them now! You all do know this mantle," holding it up. "Look! in <emph>this</emph>
                  place ran Cassius' dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made! Through
                     <emph>this</emph> the well-beloved Brutus stabbed, and as he plucked his cursed
                  steel away"—giving a vicious lunge at the blanket with the knife—"mar-r-k how the
                  blood of Cæsar followed it."</p>
               <p>Nymwha, surprised and delighted at the treasure he had in his new son, gazed from
                  one to the other of his warriors, as much as to say, "Did you ever?"—but the
                  greatest triumph was to come. Talbot now ran nimbly across the floor, seized on
                  Nymwha's tomahawk, and first feeling its keen edge and looking as ferocious as he
                  could, he gave a quick bound and striking a stage attitude, held the weapon in mid
                  air, glanced at it fiercely and commenced:</p>
               <p>"Is this a dagger which I see before me!—the handle towards my breast? Come! let
                  me clutch thee! I have thee <emph>not,</emph> and yet I <emph>see</emph> thee
                     <emph>still!</emph> Ah-h-h, Erin go Bragh! Hip-hip-hurrah!" ending by casting
                  the tomahawk deep into one of the logs.</p>
               <p>This finished the whole business. Talbot had hurled his hatchet at Nymwha's foes,
                  and was now ready to take scalps, He was evidently one of them. The entire circle
                  of hideous looking spectres was both delighted and surprised, but Nymwha most of
                  all. A big bowl and spoon were then given Talbot for the feast which was to
                  follow, and the show was over.</p>

               <p>TALBOT'S very dramatic speech to the Shawnee chiefs put him in such "high feather"
                  that, on emerging from the Council House, he essayed a regular but rather meek and
                  feeble war-whoop, which was about as near the genuine thing as the jerky and
                  conceited efforts of a young cockrel are to the sonorous and pompous notes of a
                  venerable old grandfather of a rooster.</p>
               <p>The feast of "fat things" followed, and the youthful Talbot, with his bowl and
                  spoon, presented himself before the range of kettles in which were boiling venison
                  and bear's meat, with very much the same aspect and attitude now so well known as
                  "Oliver asking for more."</p>
               <p>He had very little "stomach for the fray" which ensued, but his make-believe was
                  worthy of all admiration. The girls and squaws eyed him askance and bent upon him
                  looks of such evident admiration, that only the thick coating of vermilion paint
                  sufficed to conceal the tell-tale blood which mounted to his face.</p>
               <p>The feast was closely followed by war-dances and songs, accompanied by the
                  enrapturing tum-tum-tum of a stump drum, and the gay and inspiring melodies caused
                  by rattling pebbles in a dry hollow gourd.</p>
               <p>Then followed a dance, in which the young "braves" stood in one rank and the girls
                  in another, about a rod apart. All sang and danced together, advancing towards
                  each other; stooping until their heads were nearly touching and then retreating
                  and advancing again, intermingling brief remarks in a low voice with their notes,
                  and wooing each other in a rhythmical sort of a way.</p>
               <p>This courting dance—probably the origin of our popular "Virginia Reel,"—was much
                  more absorbing to the performers than to on-lookers; and Talbot, finding an early
                  opportunity, quietly withdrew from the crowd, and slowly sauntered off in the
                  direction in which he had watched Wau-ki-na disappear in the forest an hour
                  before.</p>
               <p>As his moccasined foot pressed the tender grass and mosses of the fragrant woods,
                  and the sounds of barbaric revelry died away in the distance, the enamored young
                  Englishman's face brightened; his step became more springy and elastic, and his
                  eye glanced inquiringly through the trees and under the coverts, if perchance he
                  could discover Wau-ki-na and gather from her the solution of the late mystery and
                  what he had to hope from the future.</p>
               <p>It was now late in the afternoon. The Delawares had all returned to Shannopins;
                  and Talbot, as he approached the extreme end of the island, seeing nowhere traces
                  of Wau-ki-na, began to fear that she too had deserted him. His heart sank within
                  him; his eyes lost their lustre, and he keenly felt the pangs of an utter solitude
                  and desertion.</p>
               <p>And now he turns toward the Delaware village and on the beach below him beholds a
                  birch canoe. Going still further towards the island's head, he is suddenly
                  arrested by the sight of Wau-ki-na, in an attitude, too, so full of grace and
                  picturesqueness that his senses are completely<pb n="386-387"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000200"/> bewitched, and under so sweet a thrall, that he can
                  do naught but gaze.</p>
               <p>Just at the very point of the island, where the bright, clear waters of the
                  Allegheny were divided into two swift, sparkling currents, stood a gigantic
                  sycamore, its huge roots washed bare by the corroding, encroaching waters; the
                  massive trunk, with all its weight of multitudinous branches and canopy of
                  luxuriant foliage, inclined over the mottled surface of the dancing waters.</p>
               <p>On one of these great, arching roots, her head leaning wearily against the tree's
                  smooth bark, sat the young and artless girl; her hair—black as midnight—fell in
                  massy luxuriance over her shoulders and far down her back. Her face wore a grave,
                  pensive, and yet anxious expression, and her eyes had in them a far-off, dreamy
                  look, as if the discovery of her new relationship had brought with it a tide of
                  strange and serious thoughts, which she could not yet fully fathom.</p>
               <p>She had, too, unlatched and taken off her moccasins, and while her hands clasped
                  in a tight embrace the locket con taming her dead mother's hair, her little tawny
                  feet plash idly in the water, breaking it into refreshing and musical wimples.</p>
               <p>The spell for Talbot was but momentary. With a "Halloo! Wau-ki-na! Oh, but I'm
                  glad to see your sweet face again!" he leaped down beside the startled girl, and
                  took her hand in his.</p>
               <p>This—a charming flush suffusing her cheek the while—she quietly withdrew, and then
                  gazing earnestly and critically at her painted companion, her whole face finally
                  dimpled and crimpled with pleasure; her eyes lighted up with merriment and a
                  musical little laugh rippled from her lips.</p>
               <p>Talbot stood astonished and abashed. At last he said, half poutingly:</p>
               <p>"Why, girl, this is strange behavior! I'm in the full toggery of a young Indian
                  'blood,' and yet you laugh right in my very face. It becomes you, lassie, I must
                  confess, but I don't like it."</p>
               <p>"Me no like it, too!" she laughed out, as lifting her nimble feet from the water,
                  she sprang up, leaped to his side, and, with a charming <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >naïveté,</foreign> took his hand and soberly led him to the water's margin,
                  just where the sun was shining on it.</p>
               <p>"Now, look in there, sir, if please; you make a vely fine little chief. Paint much
                  good for Indian 'brave,' but vely bad for 'pale-face.' You no look pretty—no at
                  all. Eyes talk, but face not. Me know not now what heart tinks."</p>
               <p>This was touching Talbot in a tender point. An ardent swain don't exactly like to
                  be laughed at just when he thinks he's making a decided sensation. With a half
                  angry look, he whimpered:</p>
               <p>"Well, Wau-ki-na, the colors <emph>are</emph> somewhat frequent and laid on a
                  trifle too loud, and I know I look like the devil; but I didn't think you'd be the
                  first to make sport of your new Indian b-b-brother. Don't my new clothes fit well?
                  Aint they of the latest Shawnee cut and fashion?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes!" the mischief and archness fading out of her eyes and speedily
                  relapsing into seriousness. "My new brother do vely well; but come! You sit right
                  there! Wau-ki-na tink vely much all day and have someting to say."</p>
               <p>Talbot had nothing to do but obey the imperious little beauty, and with a
                  half-abashed, half-amused look, awaited her words.</p>
               <p>"I no longer Indian Wau-ki-na, but Edward's sister Lucy. Edward is Captain Jack.
                  You know he. He know you, and want to take you with him. Everyting ready. I now go
                  way in canoe. When dark come, Nymwha—he vely good Indian—let you come see me,—so
                     my<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7175-00000201"/> brudder say for me to tell you.
                  If he no let you, come to dat big tree and we paddle for you; and oh! be sure, or
                  we must leave you!" and her face clouded.</p>
               <p>"I understand, and <emph>now</emph> believe, Kina. I suppose I must wait for the
                  whole story from Jack, but the more I study it, the less strange it now appears;
                  and <emph>I've</emph> been thinking, too, to-day. I'm glad and I'm sorry to know
                  you're Lucy."</p>
               <p>"Why you sorry! eh? Edward vely brave, good white chief—great name, many friends.
                  I love him; Marie love him; everybody love him. Why sorry?" and her look was
                  earnest and searching.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Kina,"—trying to escape her frank, straightforward look and digging up the
                  sand with his foot. "I've—you—I was learning to love you <emph>so</emph> much as
                  an Indian chief's daughter, and I thought you lo—liked me, too, some, and now I
                  fear, while Jack finds a dear sister, that I lose Wau-ki-na, a very,
                  very—dear—friend."</p>
               <p>There it was—quick as the lightning's flash—nature's revelation to both. There was
                  the bold, arrogant and self-confident young lord, who thought he had been but
                  toying with a pretty Indian girl, now sitting abashed in her presence; his cheeks
                  pale; his eyes cast down; his moccasined foot nervously scratching up the sand.
                  And there stood the artless, innocent, unthinking girl—the perfeet child of
                  nature—a startled look in her face, a bright flush on her cheeks, and an unwonted
                  trouble in her eyes.</p>
               <p>A silence ensued, as eloquent as it was embarrassing. In that brief minute, a
                  strange and wondrous change—human yet divine—had coe over both; and when at last
                  Talbot shyly looked up at Wau-ki-na, he saw her standing now plae and trembling,
                  all the light gone from her eyes, which were cast down upon the sand. Finally she
                  murmured, very softly;</p>
               <p>"Me tink I better go now. Me do so; Marie watch for me. Will her friend bring
                  Wau-ki-na's canoe here?" and while the young Englishman hurried off to do her
                  bidding, she stooped down with a much older expression on her face—for the first
                  time in her life, perhaps, breathing forth a sigh—and deftly put on her
                  moccasins.</p>
               <p>When Talbot returned, he looked more assured and confident, and as he handed the
                  blushing girl into her birch and extended to her the paddle, he took first her
                  outstretched little hand in his, and said:</p>
               <p>"Wau-ki-na, before you leave me here all alone, wont you tell me whether you care
                  for me? In finding the brother, will you forget the lover? you <emph>must</emph>
                  say! I may not meet you to-night!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, yes!" with a frightened look; "you <emph>must</emph> come!
                  Wau-ki-but—"dropping her eyes—"I—he—<emph>you</emph>—<emph>are—too,</emph>" and
                  her hand trembled in his as he drew her towards him and sealed the sacred compact
                  then formed with a long, warm kiss and embrace.</p>
               <p>Writing of the heart-passages between two young and ardent lovers is such dull and
                  graceless work to all outsiders—so very far beneath the reality—that we are
                  naturally silent as to what followed; but Wau-ki-na was not all owed to go so soon
                  as expected, and when the birch <emph>was</emph> shoved off into the stream,
                     <emph>she</emph> looked gay and happy, and <emph>he</emph> looked fond and
                  foolish, and stood talking and waving her until she reached the other shore, and
                  with many a look behind and gesture of found meaning, disappeared over the
                  bank.</p>
               <p>Talbot now gave a long, low whistle, muttering to him self as he turned toward his
                  Indian home:</p>
               <p>"Well, here's a rum go! Who'd ha' thought it? My lord Talbot, scion of a noble
                  house which dates from Billy the Conqueror, mad in love with an Indian maid, or at
                  best, with the pretty sister of an American scout, and, gad,<pb n="390-391"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000202"/> glad enough to be accepted, too! What would Lady
                  Grace and my haughty, gouty old father say to that? Oh, but isn't she a little
                  woodland fairy, though! and so plaguy positive, and with such odd, cunning little
                  ways, too! I'm sure bewitched! Heigh-o! wonder what'll come of it!"</p>
               <p>He hadn't gone far before he met Nymwha out in search of him. The amiable old
                  Chief scrutinized him searchingly, with an inquiring leer on his ugly phiz, and
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Nymwha saw the birch of the 'Bounding Fawn' just now. She very good Delaware
                  girl, beautiful as the wild honeysuckle. Make pretty squaw for little
                  'Two-scalps.' What you talk about? eh?"</p>
               <p>"Oh," gravely answered Talbot, "we were discussing the best way of Christianizing
                  the red man and teaching him to worship God."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, me know," wisely put in Nymwha. "God the name the Indian traders say all
                  the time. The more fire-water, the more God and more <emph>dam,</emph> eh? You
                  like to go to Shannopins and see Wau-ki-na?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed would I, venerable old saddle-bags—this very night, too!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, but you sure no run away? You come back again?" looking at the young man
                  keenly and searchingly.</p>
               <p>Talbot gravely took Nymwha's huge paw between his own, pressed it feelingly,
                  looked solemnly into the old Chief's eyes and said:</p>
               <p>"Nymwha, your island home is very good, and Wau-ki-na is like the wild-rose of the
                  woods for sweetness. I like them both, but," trying his game of mystifying the old
                  Chief by big words, "if a benignant Providence and the nocturnal darkness favor me
                  to-night, I will see you and your island in Halifax before I agitate my pedals
                  here again."</p>
               <p>Nymwha essaying to gather meaning from the serious manner of his companion rather
                  than from his words, owlishly nodded his foolish old head, saying:</p>
               <p>"Yes, me tink so, too—pretty much. The 'Bounding Fawn' very young and sweet—make
                  good chief's squaw. There's a canoe. You go over by'm by, and call Wau-ki-na out
                  of Delaware lodge—so," and he imitated the low, chirping note of the cricket.</p>
               <p>The two now entered the noisy camp, Talbot sitting meekly down near the Chief's
                  family kettle, and every now and then grinning amiably at mother Nymwha, whose
                  face looked like a used-up old drumhead, and making mouths at the divers juvenile
                  Nymwhas, of various ages and sexes, who were tumbling about on the grass like a
                  knot of sportive earth-worms.</p>

               <p>NIGHT now came over the scene, and watching his time and quietly dropping out of
                  the fire light, the impatient young nobleman, his heart beating like a small tilt
                  hammer, made his way to the beach, found the canoe, and silently pushed out into
                  the current.</p>
               <p>Following Wau-ki-na's oft-repeated instructions, the canoe was headed up stream
                  till it passed the end of the upper island. A landing on the other side was then
                  effected, and with commendable caution Talbot crept down the edge of the wood and
                  shore shadow line, and approached the place where was said to be the run's
                  mouth.</p>
               <p>Just as he was crossing a little reach of moonlit strand in order to gain a thick
                  bunchy copse of bushes and undergrowth, a stalwart Indian figure stepped out from
                  behind the tree he had just passed, while a pair of strong arms stretched forth
                  and seized him by the throat, shaking and worrying him much as a terrier would a
                  rat.</p>
               <p>While the half-suffocated Talbot was slipping his hand down for his knife, there
                  was hissed out in his face, in right good English and between the different
                  shakes:</p>
               <p>"There! take that, and that, and that, you
                  little—trifling—skulking—painted—varmint, you! I hate mightily to take life if't
                  can be helped, but squeezing your wizend wont do—fear I'll have to knife
                     <emph>you.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Why—Jack! Jack!" gasped out Talbot. "Con—found—your—cur—sed clumsiness, you'll
                  choke me to death! <emph>I'm</emph> no redskin! Hands-off, or I'll knife
                     <emph>you!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Jack loosened his hold at once and grasped his hand.</p>
               <p>"Why, Talbot lad, delighted to see you once more; excuse me—'twas a fool trick in
                  me. I <emph>ought</emph> to have known <emph>you,</emph> but altogether forgot
                  your paint and Indian dress, and was looking for yon, too, from the other side of
                  the run. Am right heartily glad I didn't stick or club you as you passed."</p>
               <p>"The pleasure's mutual, Captain, I do assure you," replied Talbot, half angrily.
                  "They say two soothsayers couldn't meet in the streets of Rome without laughing in
                  each other's face, and, by Jove, I think <emph>we</emph> might do the same. You're
                  as much Indian as I am! But where's the Half-King, and—and—Wau-ki-na?"</p>
               <p>"My sister <emph>Lucy</emph> you mean, Talbot. She has told you the strange
                  discovery. 'Tis all true, every word of it. I'll give you the whole story some
                  time, but <emph>now</emph> crouch down. The old Chief's, on the watch-out on the
                  other side of the run, and we expect Marie and Lucy every minute. From what I
                  hear, you've had a rough time at the fort and among the reddys. You've got a story
                  to tell, too. Blamed if you don't look plaguy chipper and saucy in your Shawnee
                  toggery. You made a devilish narrow escape just now, though," and the scout gave
                  out his low, peculiar laugh, and then fell into a long confidential conversation
                  with Talbot, drawing from him all that had happened since their parting, both in
                  and out of the fort. When Talbot was feelingly relating the dreadful tortures of
                  poor MacPherson and how the attempt was made to end his sufferings, Jack
                     suddenly<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7175-00000204"/> grasped his hand and gave
                  it a most hearty shake, saying:</p>
               <p>"And so, Talbot, <emph>you</emph> are the unknown who sped that bold bullet and
                  taught me my duty, are you? I might have guessed it. It does you much honor, lad,
                  but you were too far off. I'm proud I was so near as to—"</p>
               <p>"What!" joyfully broke in Talbot, equally surprised in <emph>his</emph> turn.
                  "Then you, Jack, must have been the mysterious rifleman who made good my false
                  aim. But where could you have been? I, too, was sure it was a French shot from the
                  fort. Would you mind giving me your hand again, Jack?"</p>
               <p>"Not a mite, my lord, although it <emph>does</emph> look sort of odd and
                  unfeeling-like for us to be congratulating each other on our joint attempt on the
                  life of such a noble comrade as poor Mac; but I think I know what Indian torture
                  is and the best gift I could ask of God, were I tied like the poor sergeant to a
                  torture stake, would be a bullet in the heart from some friendly rifle. My lord
                  Talbot, I like your heart and pluck and am glad you go with us."</p>
               <p>The two now—their partnership in a merciful deed having drawn them closer together
                  and increased their mutual respect—discussed, in low tones, the late events, as
                  well as the plan of escape decided on by the scout and the Half-King.</p>
               <p>At last a signal whistle from the Chief warned them of an approach, and soon Marie
                  and Wau-ki-na were led down to the mouth of the run by Scarooyaddy, and quietly
                  passed into the canoe in waiting under the overhanging bushes.</p>
               <p>But little was said. It was a moment of great suspense. Talbot managed, by a
                  tender pressure of the hand and a few whispered words, to assure Wau-ki-na of his
                  presence. He was then introduced to Marie de Bonneville by Jack, and a place
                  assigned him.</p>
               <p>All was now ready for the start and Jack was just about to whistle in the
                  Half-King, when a crackling and rustling of the bushes and smothered exclamations
                  were distinctly heard on the village side of the run.</p>
               <p>"My God, Talbot, the Chief's attacked! Whatever's to be done? Listen! Listen!"</p>
               <p>The sounds of a terrific struggle were now plainly audible, and then the
                  Half-King's voice, not one tone louder than necessary to be heard, saying in
                  English:</p>
               <p>"Shove off, my brother, and keep out in the stream! I'm beset by only three
                  Delawares—one of whom I take to be Pipe. I can hold them till you get fairly off
                  and then I'll yield me prisoner. Never mind <emph>me,</emph> I'll get—"</p>
               <p>Here the voice suddenly ceased, as if a hand had been clasped over the mouth, and
                  the sounds of the struggle were again heard.</p>
               <p>"Talbot, my dear fellow!" excitedly whispered Jack, "I leave these precious ones
                  to you; I know you'll defend them with your life. Keep well out in the river, and
                  when a half mile up, rest on your paddles. Lucy, can you give the cry of a
                  loon?"</p>
               <p>"I can," replied the frightened girl, "but, dear brother, would you leave us—Marie
                  and me—now? Wont you, too, come into the canoe and let Scaroo—"</p>
               <p>"What! Lucy, and leave my old friend to fight at such odds, and with Pipe, too,
                  our mother's murderer and your captor? 'Tis not my sister's heart but her fears
                  that advise this—couldn't do it. I'd go back to fight Pipe if he'd a score instead
                  of only two at his back. Take paddle, Lucy, and when you get to where I told you,
                  rest awhile, and every now and then give the loon's cry, and if we whip the
                  devils, we'll soon know where you are. If we don't, why—God help you all! Talbot
                  knows our plans and you must trust to him. And now good-bye, dearest Marie and
                  Lucy, the Chief must be sore pressed."</p>
               <p>With this, Jack gave the canoe a powerful shove, which<pb n="396-397"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000205"/> shot it far out into the current, and then with a
                  low, sharp shout of encouragement, leaped across the run and hurriedly made his
                  way to his friend.</p>
               <p>"Hold up, Chief!" they distinctly heard him say. "Use your rifle butt till I'm
                  with ye, and then close in, but be sure to leave Pipe to me!"</p>
               <p>After a brief pause—"Now! now! hug him close! Grapple him tight, Chief, while I
                  take Pipe! Ah-h-h! got you at last, you double—cursed—murderer—and kidnapper!
                  I've—hunted—you—long. Either—you—or—I—have got to die this clinch!"</p>
               <p>The two girls—entwined in a mutual embrace—sat pale and breathless in the bow,
                  while Talbot stood, paddle in hand, intently listening to every sound and change
                  of the desperate fray going on so near them. Now would be heard the cracking of
                  twigs, smothered groans and curses, angry exclamations, and even the loud pantings
                  of the combatants, as they writhed and twisted in this terrible struggle to the
                  death.</p>
               <p>And now the paddle was dipped and the canoe proceeded slowly up stream. They had
                  scarce gone a hundred yards before was heard an attempt at a
                  war-whoop—hoarse—broken—feeble—and finally ending in a muffled, spasmodic gurgling
                  and gasping, as though the throat from which it issued was being pressed tighter
                  and tighter.</p>
               <p>It was an encouraging sign, a cry of distress on the part of the Delawares, as if
                  they were being worsted and called to the village for help. Then all was silent
                  for them.</p>
               <p>The point where Talbot had left his canoe was now reached. The paddles were
                  stilled and the three listened anxiously and most intently for the next sounds.
                  When about a quarter of an hour was thus passed, Wau-ki-na—for so we most like to
                  call her—raised the clear, tremulous, and very peculiar cry of the loon. It was so
                  natural that even Talbot looked around to see whence it issued.</p>
               <p>It was unnecessary to repeat it. Immediately after, answer was heard from the
                  shore, and Talbot dashed in his paddle and would have made straight for the sound,
                  but Wau-ki-na—fully posted in all Indian stratagems—was too wary, and restrained
                  him until she could again raise the cry, which was again answered and from a much
                  nearer point.</p>
               <p>"Edward, is that you?" Wau-ki-na at last ventured to say in low but clear
                  tones.</p>
               <p>"Yes! yes! the Half-King and me—all safe too! Make haste—not a moment to
                  lose!"</p>
               <p>"Thank God for that!" now for the first time spoke Marie—joy and deep feeling
                  expressed in every tone, and soon the prow grated on the beach, and the two scouts
                  rapidly and silently took their places and the paddles.</p>
               <p>"Stay!" exclaimed Jack. "The Half-King and I had arranged some devices to throw
                  the Delawares and Shawnees off our trail and make them think we had escaped down
                  the Allegheny and thence up the Monongahela by way of Braddock's route, but we've
                  no time for that now. None of them but what will believe, at any rate, that we
                  have gone down instead of up the river. We must risk it, at all events.
                     <emph>One</emph> thing however, we <emph>must</emph> do. Talbot, where did you
                  leave your canoe? Was it a large one?"</p>
               <p>"It was, and you see its dim shadow on the beach there."</p>
               <p>"Good!" said Jack. "Now, Lucy and Marie, each give me some trifling article of
                  dress—so! Come! Yaddy, let's turn over that canoe, and send it adrift down the
                  river."</p>
               <p>The two then drew out and upset Talbot's canoe, let a small shawl from Marie and a
                  gay ribbon from Wau-ki-na depend, in what would be a very natural sort of way,
                  from the thwarts of the boat, while Jack thrust an old pouch<pb n="398-399"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000206"/> under a sort of seat in the bow, so it would not
                  fall out, and down the canoe was borne by the swift current.</p>
               <p>"Rather a clumsy fetch, Yaddy, isn't it, with which to fool an Indian? but 'tis
                  the best we can do just now. It <emph>may</emph> serve. And now, girls, we must
                  work hard all night and get a long, long start, in case of pursuit. Yaddy and I'll
                  take the paddles—off we go."</p>
               <p>And the paddles were dipped in a slow, long, regular stroke, which had no
                  intermission for hours. They had scarce fallen regularly to work before thus
                  Marie:</p>
               <p>"But, Edward, you haven't told us of that dreadful struggle, the noise and various
                  changes of which were borne to our ears. Are you at all hurt?"</p>
               <p>"Not a scratch, Marie—not a single scratch! At one time, while busy with Pipe, I
                  got a blow and a bear's hug from the third Indian, which made me see stars and
                  stopped my breath, but I managed, by a powerful effort, to throw him off, and give
                  him a kick which doubled him up like a jack-knife. But <emph>Yaddy</emph> has some
                  beauty streaks about his throat which will last him a long time instead of wampum
                  or paint, and will make him as hoarse as a bullfrog for a month to come.</p>
               <p>"Why when I got up to him the Chief had just clinched with a gigantic old
                  Delaware, whose muscles stood out like a trained boxer's. He was almost too much
                  for our old Indian and had him so tight about the windpipe that Yaddy was making
                  some very odd noises and was casting up his eyes like a dying dolphin. By-the-by,
                  how did you get out of that scrape, Yaddy? I was too hard pressed, myself, to
                  see."</p>
               <p>"Scarooyaddy pretty old, but strong like the oak," grimly and hoarsely croaked out
                  the old Chief. "He got one arm loose and work his knife around <emph>so,</emph>
                  until big Delaware much glad to let go; then I have him. I let him lie and go for
                  little one. He give me very much trouble. He twist and squirm and jump 'roun', but
                  my white brother help me, and Scarooyaddy," patting his girdle, "have two more
                  locks under his skirt."</p>
               <p>"But Captain Pipe, Edward, what happened him?" anxiously inquired Wau-ki-na,
                  unable to lose interest in one who, although he had murdered mother and sister,
                  yet still, after an Indian's nature, had for so many years been a father to
                  her.</p>
               <p>"Well, Lucy, I failed to kill him, as he did our mother and Emma, but I think we
                  are avenged. He made a sudden jump across the run and crawled away, escaping in
                  the dark, but better for him had he died then and there. He bears wounds which
                  will I think worry and torture him to the grave. 'Twas a tough struggle—the
                  sharpest, I think, I ever had. The cruel old ruffian fought long and desperately.
                  No blow, or cut, or hug he got from me was begrudged, I can tell you. If he
                  informs the Delawares of this combat, they'll have to find him, be sure of that.
                  But enough of him!"</p>

               <p>THE moon was now abroad, casting its silver sheen over the bright waters of the
                  Allegheny, and bringing into view the bold and heavily-wooded hills which border
                  both sides of this most beautiful and picturesque stream. The light canoe,
                  impelled by the practised paddles of men whose nerves were like steel and who knew
                  not fatigue, danced over the water "like a thing of life." Island after island,
                  rapid after rapid were passed.</p>
               <p>As mile upon mile sped rapidly behind them, increasing their distance from enemies
                  and lessening the danger of successful pursuit, the spirits of the whole party
                  arose in proportion, and a free and full conversation was indulged in.</p>
               <p>Jack told them his plans. He had avoided the Braddock route because he supposed it
                  would be beset with outlying parties of pursurers and spoil-gatherers, and had
                  chosen what was then everywhere known as the "Kittanning trail," because it
                  afforded a safer and easier route of escape, and because it led more directly to
                  his own home, which was at Aughwick, where afterwards Fort Shirley was built and
                  where now the town of Shirleysburg stands.</p>
               <p>The "Kittanning trail" was then the broad and beaten path—used for foot and horse
                  by Indians and traders—between the West and the Susquehanna. Commencing at what is
                  now called Kittanning, Pa., and where was at that time a large Delaware village
                  under the chieftainship of the celebrated and redoubtable Captain Jacobs—it bore
                  southcastwardly, the descent on the eastern slope of the Allegheny Mountains being
                  through a gorge, the mouth of which is about five miles west of Holidaysburg at
                  what is well-known to this day as Kittanning Point.</p>
               <p>Thence this Indian path diverged into what are now called Scotch, Canoe, Hartsog,
                  and Woodcock valleys, and thence across Broad Top Mountain into Aughwick, and
                  after into Tuscarora and Sherman's valleys.</p>
               <p>Jack's design was to stop about five miles short of the Delaware village at
                  Kittanning—from which point bloody and devastating excursions against the frontier
                  settlements were so frequent as soon after to lead to its destruction and the
                  death of Jacobs—and making a detour, to come into the Indian trail somewhere near
                  the present Armstrong and Indiana county line.</p>
               <p>Such was the fear and danger from pursuit and recapture, that it was considered
                  better to risk cautious travel in the woods by day than to lie by for the night.
                  Marie and Wau-ki-na were, therefore, urged—in view of the fatiguing march before
                  them—to take as much rest as possible, and Talbot busied himself with great
                  deftness and delicate attention in fitting up for them in the bow of the boat a
                  temporary couch on which to recline.</p>
               <p>All was now still on board the frail craft, and nothing was heard around but the
                  steady and regular dip of the two paddles, the occasional plash of a fish in the
                     water,<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC7175-00000208"/> the cry of loon or distant
                  howl of wolf, and the hoot of owl or note of whippoorwill.</p>
               <p>Such were the weird witcheries of this strange night ride; so impressive were the
                  stillness, the loneliness, the various notes and sounds so peculiar to the hour,
                  that it was long before the two maidens—completely exhausted as they must have
                  been—were visited by the slumber so much required.</p>
               <p>At last it came, softly and quietly, dropping like the gentle dew from heaven,
                  causing Wau-ki-na's lips to move in the empty babblings of dreams, and bringing to
                  Marie—who had lately so much suffered and endured—the priceless blessing of total
                  oblivion.</p>
               <p>Not a man of them there, as he watched those two helpless, innocent maidens, who
                  did not feel better, stronger, more resolute, from their presence. To Jack,
                  especially—who had spent so many long years of lonely vigils and trampings in the
                  gratification of a fierce, devouring passion—his new-found first-love and Lucy had
                  a wonder-fully softening influence. The unbidden tear would now and then follow
                  his frequent glances back, and his heart was filled with tender and long-forgotten
                  emotions. Even Scarooyaddy's paddle dipped noiselessly, for fear the slumbers
                  might be stirred by a plash.</p>
               <p>And so, without pause or intermission, until the first gray of dawn. Nothing to
                  disturb but just once, when close to the mouth of the Kiskiminitas, the noisy dash
                  of paddle and the sound of voices gave notice of the approach down stream of
                  Indians. The canoe was quietly turned toward the deep hill-shadows along shore;
                  the scouts crouched down to a level with the thwarts; perfect stillness was
                  maintained, and the Delaware party—probably from Kittanning on a visit to the fort
                  to sell pelts and venison and to bring back ammunition—had passed on their
                  boisterous course.</p>
               <p>Marie and Wau-ki-na were at last awakened by the grating of the boat on the sandy
                  beach of a snug little cove, completely overarched with foliage. They started,
                  marvelled for a moment at their surroundings and their company, gave forth a long
                  sigh of relief, and arose smiling and almost gay at their escape. So far,
                  well.</p>
               <p>Talbot glanced shyly at Wau-ki-na, tipped her a pleasant "good morning," and
                  thought he never saw the blushing and nut-brown little damsel look so
                  divinely.</p>
               <p>Jack was as happy as a—yes, as <emph>the</emph> lord beside him; his face had lost
                  all its sternness, and a pleasant smile played around his handsome mouth.</p>
               <p>Scarooyaddy, even, forgot all his grimness, and his iron jaws opened and closed
                  like a steel-trap. He smiled and even grinned all over his face, and insisted
                  several times that it was a "wely good mornin'."</p>
               <p>Oh, woman! woman! What would—</p>
               <p>But our readers can supply what ought to be said here, and can follow, at
                  pleasure, the varied lines of reflections which the <emph>strange</emph> word
                  suggests.</p>
               <p>"Well, gentlemen, all," said Marie, "you've given us a very quiet ride,
                  and—"looking on both green sides of the cozy, peaceful little inlet and at the
                  overhanging canopy of verdure—"what a delightful change from last night's horrors.
                  Wau-ki-na, we must have slept long. Where are we now; and what next, Edward?"</p>
               <p>"Well, Marie, next for you and Lucy <emph>ought</emph> to be horses, but as none
                  of us are proud, and as neither of you is a mincing, die-away city damsel, guess
                  you'll have to trudge along on foot,—sorry, but <emph>must</emph> get on."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Brudder," broke in Wau-ki-na, "we go the best and quickest on our own feet.
                  Marie and Wau—Lucy I mean—walk, walk all day through woods—way past Alaquippa's
                  place. 'Fraid this new little chief, though," pointing<pb n="404-405"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000209"/> ing smilingly to Talbot, "not go wely well.
                  Moccasins too thin."</p>
               <p>"Who—<emph>me?</emph> Wau-ki-na! What put that odd notion into your funny noddle?
                  Why, the old chief there'll lag behind <emph>me;</emph> mother and father
                  Nymwha'll be <emph>my</emph> whip and spur. Why, since I've been on this
                  wilderness tramp, I've developed about sixty-five distinct new muscles, and if my
                  moccasins ain't good, who made them, eh?"</p>
               <p>Wau-ki-na blushed, looked shyly at Edward, cast down her eyes in some confusion,
                  and commenced getting out the provisions which she and Marie had brought from
                  Shannopins.</p>
               <p>This abashment on the part of his sister, did not pass unnoticed by Jack. He
                  looked grave, then troubled, but said nothing.</p>
               <p>After a hearty meal and much pleasant conversation, the party rose to their feet
                  and prepared for the long journey before them. The canoe was run still further up
                  the little cove; all traces of their presence were carefully removed or concealed,
                  and with light steps they sprang from stone to stone, following the run a
                  considerable distance, and then mounted the bank, and commenced their journey, the
                  wary old chief—to whom the whole region was familiar—in front, then Talbot,
                  Wau-ki-na, Marie and last, Jack—all in Indian file.</p>
               <p>Their course—guided by the mosses on the north side of the thick trees and with no
                  beaten path—was, in the hill places, somewhat difficult, but the Half-King, a
                  life-long denizen of the woods, had an Indian's wonderful and unerring sagacity in
                  picking out the easiest directions and the more open woods, and the progress was,
                  on the whole, not only rapid, but pleasant.</p>
               <p>The two girls never flagged or flinched—in fact, their spirits rose with every
                  mile that brought them nearer the back settlements and that left longer distance
                  to pursuit. Their moccasined feet plodded deftly through the intricacies of the
                  forest way, and had a springiness and airiness of step which betokened long
                  familiarity with wilderness tramps. Talbot kept close behind the Chief—at once
                  bothering and amusing him with questions and conceits; sometimes talking too loud
                  for prudence, and, irrepressible as ever, keeping up a running or rather walking
                  conversation with Wau-ki-na behind him.</p>
               <p>Jack could not help but observe the growing pleasure Talbot and his sister took in
                  each other's society. He made Marie keep close behind her, but for
                  reasons—prudential and sentimental—obvious to our readers, was not exactly
                  prepared to change places with the now gay young lord.</p>
               <p>And it was a marvel, too, to see the old Scarooyaddy. He seemed like some dusky
                  spirit piloting a party over Acheron. Erect, silent, solemn, unerring, never
                  hesitating, turning neither to right nor left, he glided rather than walked in
                  front. Planting his feet in the same line—one directly before the other—after the
                  universal Indian fashion, and stepping lightly but firmly just where his foot
                  would make the least noise and leave the least impression, he went, true as the
                  needle and stealthy as the panther.</p>
               <p>His roving, restless eye seemed to pierce both long distances ahead and wide
                  circuits around; not the slightest object or movement escaped his notice—a bird's
                  hop on a bough, the rustle of a squirrel in the tree top, even almost the fall of
                  a leaf, would still him instantly in his track.</p>
               <p>Occasionally, too, he would stop and seat himself near some pleasant little grassy
                  glade; at the foot of some noble old oak or beech, or by the side of some
                  prattling, babbling stream or noisy waterfall. He said nothing, but it was plainly
                  meant for the girls behind, and when they expressed pleasure at any view or forest
                  charm or beauty, which he thus craftily brought to their notice, he would show it
                     in<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC7175-00000210"/> his weather-beaten old face by a
                  milder look in the eye or by softer lines about the mouth.</p>
               <p>Once, he actually turned from the path to pluck a wild-flower which was flaunting
                  its gay colors and wasting its sweetness all unnoticed in a little dell by a brook
                  side, and suddenly turning, handed it with a grim smile to Wau-ki-na.</p>
               <p>"Why, do but watch the old fighting chief!" whispered Jack to Marie, "he's
                  actually turning courtier; a flower's about as much in his line as a diamond
                  pin."</p>
               <p>"Barbarian as he is, <emph>I've</emph> always found him a brave and gallant
                  gentleman," answered Marie, feelingly; "he's one of nature's noblemen, titled by
                  God, and putting to shame many who bear the name but know not the meaning of
                     <emph>noble</emph>."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Marie, if you'd known him as I've known him these long, long years past—as
                  true as steel, wise as serpent, brave as lion, and yet, at times, tender as a
                  woman; why, Marie, I actually love that dear old fellow, and I believe he loves me
                  too."</p>

               <p>IT was now high noon, and Scarooyaddy came to a pause just at the bottom of a deep
                  glen and by the side of a moss-covered, pine-crowned cliff, and at the foot of a
                  musical little waterfall, which tumbled its leaping and sparkling waters
                  pell-mell, hurry-scurry, into a cool, rocky basin.</p>
               <p>"Just the very place for lunch," cried Talbot, in great glee. "Here, Wau-ki-na,
                  what's your bill of fare?" looking into the sack—"jerked venison, corn dodgers,
                  army bread, cold hominy, and for dessert, oh, yes, here it is—hominy, bread, corn
                  cake, and venison, with some of that nice 'Adam's ale'for a <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">bonne bouche.</foreign> 'Tis good enough for a king—or at least
                  for a Half-King; eh! Jack!"</p>
               <p>The party were evidently becoming well-acquainted, and after a hearty meal, at
                  which hunger gave the chief relish, and a long two-hours' rest and much
                  conversation, the march was bravely resumed in the same order as before, nothing
                  occurring to obstruct a constant progress.</p>
               <pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC7175-00000211"/>
               <p>It was a sultry July afternoon. The walking had for some time become a settled and
                  monotonous trudge; all conversation had nearly died away, when, finally, about six
                  of the evening and just on the long rise of a hill, Jack said:</p>
               <p>"Halloo! Yaddy; where are we, and where do we stop to-night? The ladies are
                  getting jaded and weary and I think I see Talbot limping."</p>
               <p>Talbot stiffened up in an instant.</p>
               <p>"Me limping? Why, Jack, you must be blind-tired. 'Twas the Half-King you saw. I'm
                  as springy as a foot ball. If 'tweren't for these rough woods, I'd just like to
                  run you a five-mile race, even weights. I'd show you what our turfmen call
                  'staying powers', but I would like the course, if convenient, on a down
                  grade."</p>
               <p>"They <emph>would</emph> be '<emph>staying</emph> powers,' indeed," laughed Jack.
                  "But it's high time, tired or not, for us all to rest for the night. Where is it
                  to be, Chief?"</p>
               <p>"Over the hill there—'Kittanning path' near by. Beautiful woods half-hour from
                  here."</p>
               <p>"Well, push on! Old Ironsides. Bear up cheerily, Marie and Lucy, 'tis but a little
                  while longer."</p>
               <p>Now the hill top is reached, and the Indian, as was ever his wont, cast a
                  scrutinizing glance on all sides and far in the front. He evidently saw at once
                  some suspicious object. He gave a slight start and gazed long and intently at
                  something which had attracted his quick eye on the other side of the valley below
                  them, and just in the direction they were going.</p>
               <p>"How now, Chief? What d'ye see?" said Jack, pushing hastily to the front.</p>
               <p>"Look!"</p>
               <p>Following the direction of the Half-King's finger, Jack soon saw two clouds of
                  blue smoke lazily rising from above the trees of a grove about half a mile off—the
                  very place the Indian was trying to reach for the night.</p>
               <p>"What d'ye make of it, Yaddy? Indians?"</p>
               <p>"Delawares. from Kittanning; but"—shaking his head—"almost too much smoke; they
                  must fear nothing. Right on the big trail, too."</p>
               <p>"Well,<emph>we've</emph> not much to fear, either, I take it. We'll stay
                     <emph>here</emph> to-night."</p>
               <p>"Good!" grunted the Indian. "My brother stay here, and when the dark come,
                  Scarooyaddy go see."</p>
               <p>"Then I 'go see,' too," said Jack; and so finally it was arranged, and shortly
                  after, leaving the two maidens in care of Talbot, and strictly charging him on no
                  account to move from a sheltered spot hard by a rocky ledge on the eastern slope
                  of the hill, Jack and the Indian quickly disappeared in the valley.</p>
               <p>They were soon mounting the opposite hill, and just as the twilight was deepening
                  into night, they cautiously approached the woods, above which they had seen the
                  smoke.</p>
               <p>And now, as the brow of the hill was reached, two bright fires suddenly appeared
                  in near view, and around them and among the trees a number of figures were seen
                  standing or moving about.</p>
               <p>Jack suddenly clutched the old Indian tight by the arm.</p>
               <p>"Good heavens, Chief! you're mad wrong for once! Those fellows are
                     <emph>white</emph>—all over, and every man of them! Who can they be? and, eh!
                  what, Chief!" as a log just thrown on the fire threw up a burst of bright flame;
                  "scalp me alive, if they aint in the dress of my own brave hunters! And look! man,
                  look! Why, if there isn't Lieutenant Hogg, and Sergeant Imbrie, and Archy
                  MacAllister, and Sandy MacLaughlin, and little Pat McGuire! Why, curses on our
                  stupid heads, Yaddy, they're <emph>all my own boys!</emph>
                  <pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC7175-00000212"/> —my true and tried Forest Rangers!"
                  and Jack at once gave a loud and joyous hurrah which made the woods ring again,
                  and started the whole troop, first to their feet and then to their rifles.</p>
               <p>Then catching the Chief by the arm, and rapidly drawing him forward, Jack ran
                  right up to the crowd, shouting: "Hurrah! my boys, here we are again!—Jack, your
                  own leader, and the Half-King! I could almost cry for joy!"</p>
               <p>And then such a glad shout rose up from Jack's Rangers as would have done your
                  ears good to hear. They crowded about him, seized on his two hands, and almost
                  fairly lifted their beloved leader from the ground.</p>
               <p>And then the Half-King—well known to the whole of them—came in for
                     <emph>his</emph> share of attentions, and amid laughs and shouts and questions,
                  and "Why Caps," both sides commenced to realize the fortunate meet.</p>
               <p>"And what, Hogg and Mercer, in God's name!" cried Jack, when he could recover
                  breath and get rid of their attentions, "are the 'Rangers' doing here, away out on
                  the 'Kittanning trail?'"</p>
               <p>"We might ask the same thing of you, Jack!" quickly answered sturdy Dr. Hugh
                  Mercer—afterwards one of the best generals in our Revolutionary war. "You're about
                  as wide out of your reckoning <emph>as we</emph> are! If you desert your company
                  to fight on your own hook, why, <emph>we</emph> must somehow keep in practice,
                  too. To see the Delaware Jacobs coming from Kittanning, wouldn't have stunned us a
                  whit; but to see <emph>you</emph>—hang it, Captain, it's kind o' knocked us! Has
                  old Braddock taken that place, too?"</p>
               <p>"Braddock?" indignantly answered Jack. "I tell you, boys, he's the hardest hit and
                  worst whipped old humbug you ever saw—his whole army completely cut up, and what's
                  left of them racing through the woods and over the hills as if the devil himself
                  were after them. Oh, don't speak to me about <emph>him!</emph>" bitterly continued
                  Jack; "it makes me grind my teeth and gnaw my lips to even think of the vain,
                  pig-headed blunderer!"</p>
               <p>"And when did the battle come off?" inquired Hogg. "We never heard a word of
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Don't well see how you could. It only happened two days since. I'm even now
                  coming from it, but in a rather roundabout way; but this I must say, lads, and the
                  country will bear me out in it, that had Braddock accepted the 'Rangers' as his
                  scouts, instead of insulting us and rejecting our services, this disgraceful
                  defeat and rout could never have happened; but sit down, men, and I'll tell you
                  all about the scrimmage."</p>
               <p>And round about their trusted leader, the whole company of eighty as brave and
                  skilful riflemen rangers as the country could then produce, grouped themselves on
                  the grass. They were chiefly of Scotch-Irish stock, most of them young, hardy, and
                  reckless frontiersmen, who had, with that desperate love for adventure which
                  characterized our border population at that time, been prompted to leave the older
                  settlements of York, Cumberland and Lancaster counties, and stray over into the
                  lovely valleys and hunting grounds of the Juniata.</p>
               <p>"Captain Jack's Rangers" were known all along the Allegheny mountains, as far
                  south even as the Potomac, and had been for years—but were still more to be in the
                  future—of incalculable aid in keeping the jealous, marauding Indian tribes, which
                  hung upon the skirts of civilization, in check; in repressing incursions;
                  punishing savage robbers and murderers; recovering stolen property, etc.</p>
               <p>The conflict between them and the ever-hostile Indian bands was constant and
                  irrepressible; and they were even now out on an expedition to destroy Jacob's
                  Delaware town at Kittanning, when so opportunely met by their leader and advised
                  of Braddock's defeat and retreat. It was left<pb n="412-413"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000213"/> to Colonel Armstrong to renew the expedition and
                  carry out its objects, the very next year.</p>
               <p>Jack hurriedly, and with great animation, ran over the stirring events which had
                  happened since he took service with Braddock at Fort Cumberland; modestly
                  recounted the chief incidents of the last few days' scouting, and ended with:</p>
               <p>"But, lads, I've not told ye all; the strangest news is to come. Yaddy and I have
                  a great secret for you, which will astound you more than our unlooked-for
                  presence. We're not alone, and I'll soon beg leave to introduce to my gallant
                  free-hunters, young lord Talbot, of England, and two ladies—one <emph>my own
                     sister,</emph> many years ago stolen and adopted by Captain Pipe, and the other
                  a—a very dear friend of my youth. Ah! no wonder you stare. I scarce need ask of
                  you a hearty welcome and backwoods hospitality for them."</p>
               <p>The rough but warm-hearted Rangers stood about almost incredulous, and Jack had
                  now to acquaint them with as much of his story as he wished them to know, when
                  Mercer broke in:</p>
               <p>"And where did you say, Captain, your lady company were?"</p>
               <p>"But a short half mile from here. The Chief and I'll have them here in a
                  jiffy."</p>
               <p>"Not a bit of it!" hastily put in Lieutenant Hogg. "Come, men! take rifle at once,
                  and let us make a guard of honor for our Captain's sister and friends! and Mooney,
                  make ready two of the pack-horses; quick! quick! and scurry after!"</p>
               <p>A great hubbub now ensued. A sister of their Captain found—that strange, moody,
                  reckless and mysterious man who never was heard to speak of family or relatives.
                  It was an unheard of word and thought among them, and all was joy, excitement and
                  curiosity; and soon the proud and happy Scarooyaddy, followed by every single man
                  of the company, except enough to guard the camp, quickly led the way down the
                  hill, across the bottom, and then up the other side to where Talbot and the
                  others—wondering at their long absence—anxiously awaited in the dark the return of
                  their guides and protectors.</p>
               <p>The quick ear of Wau-ki-na—sharpened by many years of Indian life and
                  customs—first caught afar off the approaching sounds—the muttered voices, the
                  breaking of twigs and branches, etc. She could not comprehend, and catching
                  Talbot's arm, hurriedly called his attention.</p>
               <p>"What can it be, Kina? Could your brother be captured, and can these be
                  Indians?"</p>
               <p>"No, no, me tink not—Indians no go that way—too much noise—can't be bears, nor
                  panthers, either—may be a pack of hungry wolves. That would be bad. Oh, my new
                  brudder's lost!"</p>
               <p>"Well, whatever it be, girl, you and Miss Marie had better slip around the rock
                  there, and hide yourself as much as possible. I'll do all I can to defend you from
                  danger."</p>
               <p>It would be foolish to say Talbot was calm and undismayed. He was not; but had
                  that dread which comes over every one, no matter how brave, who knows a danger
                  approaching, of which he can measure neither the kind nor extent. But whatever
                  else were of the little lord's failings, want of pluck was not one of them. He was
                  as brave as Julius Cæsar, and now seized his knife and cocked his rifle; advanced
                  a few steps to the brow of the hill, and waited all alone and quietly.</p>
               <p>The noise now ceased, and then another rustling, and a shadowy figure could just
                  be dimly seen a little way down the hill.</p>
               <p>"Stop!" exclaimed Talbot, in a firm but low voice; "whoever, or whatever you are,
                  or I shoot!" and he presented<pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC7175-00000214"/> sented
                  his rifle. "Not a step further, or you're a dead man, if you <emph>are</emph> a
                  man! Can that be you, Jack?"</p>
               <p>"That's me, <emph>Jack,</emph>" cheerily spoke out Jack, glad to find Talbot of so
                  much spirit. "I fell into the rear, and just thought that maybe we would frighten
                  you with so much noise."</p>
               <p>"Well, Jack, I must say it was devilish unkind and thoughtless of you to come on
                  us in that way. A moment more and I might have done a deed the memory of which a
                  whole lifetime couldn't wipe out."</p>
               <p>"Where are Marie and Wau-ki-na?" answered Jack.</p>
               <p>"Around the rocks there," said Talbot, petulantly; "but they must have better
                  tempers than I have if they can relish your little joke."</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, Talbot; '<emph>twas</emph> thoughtless in me, but I'm much upset
                  myself, and thought only of the pleasure in store for you all. Besides, my boys
                  got ahead of me."</p>
               <p>"Why, Jack, art crazy, man? What mean ye by your 'boys?' Are you pushing still
                  further your sorry jest?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Talbot, and Lucy, and Marie"—for these last two, hearing his voice, had now
                  come up—"my whole company of hunters is right here, and with food and horses for
                  all three, and nothing more now to fear." And the proud and happy scout shook
                  Talbot warmly by the hand till his fingers ached; gave Lucy a tender embrace, and
                  seemed about, in his joy and excitement, to do the same with Marie, but exchanged
                  it just at the last moment, for a tender and most affectionate pressure of the
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"And now come on, my brave lads, and bring up your horses! here are Lucy, my
                  sister; Miss de Bonneville, and Lord Talbot of England, who just now had a bead
                  drawn on your Captain and was near making an unpleasant corpse of him. You'll find
                  him a devilish clever fellow, and a very tight little Shawnee Chief, who'd fight
                  his own shadow, although he <emph>has</emph> washed off his war-paint."</p>
               <p>The Rangers now clustered about, while the officers and leading men came forward
                  and exchanged greetings with the ladies, looking with the greatest interest at
                  Wau-ki-na, who conducted herself throughout with a charming grace and dignity.</p>

               <p>MOUNTED on the horses, Scarooyaddy at Wau-ki-na's bridle piloting the way, and a
                  guard of Rangers on either side, the little procession soon reached the grove and
                  the bright, cheery fires. By this light the three had to undergo a closer
                  inspection, which, however, seemed to make such a favorable impression, that the
                  whole camp was in a state of exuberant joy and hilarity.</p>
               <p>While some prepared a bountiful frontier supper, others arranged pillions for the
                  morrow's journey, and others still cut pine branches for a bower, and collected
                  leaves and robes for a fitting couch for the lovely guests. The whole camp seemed
                  richer for their presence, and they were the recipients of all kinds of most
                  respectful attentions.</p>
               <p>Jack couldn't help but show his gladness at the happy turn matters had taken. He
                  stole occasional glances at Marie, so full of joy and regard that she could
                  scarcely misinterpret them. The evening was passed by the men in jokes, and songs,
                  and stories, the occasional peals of laughter filling the sombre old forest with
                  the strange sounds.</p>
               <p>Jack's party, to which some of his more intimate acqaintance were added, beguiled
                  the time with pleasant conversation, and in going over the events of the past few
                  days, now brought to such a favorable termination. Talbot, as often as he could
                  secure her undivided attention, devoted himself to Wau-ki-na and seemed to
                  outshine Jack in his beaming looks of content.</p>
               <p>The news of Braddock's defeat caused an immediate abandonment of the expedition
                  against Kittanning. It would have been too risky to have pressed it with such a
                  small force. Jack now resumed command of his Rangers, and gave out the word for an
                  early start on the morrow back to the settlements. The hut of fragrant pine
                  boughs, and the couch of robes for the two females, had long been ready, and such
                  were the wearing fatigues of the day, that soon after retirement, they fell into a
                  long, unbroken slumber.</p>
               <p>It was bright day when Jack awoke. His men were busy about the fires in
                  preparations for a hunter's breakfast of game, and with his mind unwontedly filled
                  with pleasant thoughts, the Ranger-scout sauntered through the fragrant woods, and
                  soon came to the edge of a wild and sombre glen, adown which danced in wild glee
                  or in mad tumult a great rush of waters.</p>
               <p>At the foot of this boisterous and foam-covered rapid, and sitting pensively on a
                  tree trunk close by the margin of the whirling eddies, he was astonished to see
                  Marie. With a start of pleased surprise, but with an air that had yet somewhat of
                  embarrassment in it, he hastened to accost her.</p>
               <p>"Why, Marie, you're an early bird! Still ever finding out the romantic spots.
                  You're as true a child of the woods as myself."</p>
               <p>Marie had turned quickly at his voice, a rosy blush, she knew not wherefore,
                  mounting her cheek, and her sad eye kindling with pleasure.</p>
               <pb n="418-419" xml:id="VAC7175-00000216"/>
               <p>"'Tis part of my life, I suppose, Edward," she gave answer. "My dear father was
                  such a very high priest of nature, that I could not pass so many years with him in
                  the woods without sharing largely in his devout spirit. I was just watching the
                  peaceful gambols of those two foxsquirrels, and thinking how delightful it would
                  be when I, like them, could live undisturbed by the rude alarms and terrible
                  shocks which have so tried me of late. Is Lucy yet astir?"</p>
               <p>"Not yet, poor child. She must be very, very weary. 'Tis of her I would now talk
                  to you, Marie. I've been wishing for some time to ask your opinion of her."</p>
               <p>"How <emph>could</emph> you ask, Edward? You must already know. She has so much of
                  your mother's good, gentle, woman's spirit, that all these years of Indian life
                  and companionship, have left her as sweet, as pure, and as winsome a creature as I
                  ever knew. Don't fear Lucy; she'll always be a pride and delight to you. I think I
                  know her thoroughly. You must have seen how, even before I dreamed of her birth
                  and relationship, I, and poor father, too, always had an unaccountable affection
                  for her."</p>
               <p>"Marie, I'm heartily glad to hear you say this—<emph>so</emph> glad, you don't
                  know. I love her dearly already. It would be unspeakably sad to know that her
                  wilderness life, and her many years with those marauding Delawares, had spoiled or
                  contaminated her. Another thing disquiets me. I've been watching closely, and fear
                  she's taken a great liking to the young English lord. Have you ever noticed—"</p>
               <p>"To speak frankly, Edward, I have, but it will wear off with his absence, which
                  must now be very near. Of course, he, looking on her all along as but a pretty,
                  graceful, and winning Indian beauty, does not think of her
                  <emph>seriously.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No; and what's more, by jove, he <emph>shall</emph> not," flashed out Jack,
                  angrily. "If I thought <emph>that,</emph> I would forbid another word between
                  them. I'm too proud an American to seek any such mesalliance. You must warn her
                  however, Marie, <emph>at once.</emph> Better from you than me. I'll keep close eye
                  on him, too, and see that he treats her just as a mere chance acquaintance. A
                  manner and style of words which might not be amiss while she was thought Pipe's
                  daughter, wouldn't answer at all now that she's Jack's sister. He must part from
                  her at Aughwick."</p>
               <p>"And so, alas, must I. Perhaps he—"</p>
               <p>"You! Marie? Why, wha—what mean you? You know your dying father solemnly charged
                  me to see you safe to Philadelphia, and do you think I'd prove recreant to the
                  trust? What have I done to make you think so harshly of me?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, nothing; I do assure you," with a half-frightened look at the possible
                  turn which she had so unconsciously precipitated; "but I—you—Philadelphia is so
                     <emph>very</emph> far from your home at Aughwick, and 'twould be better for me
                  to go with Talbot, since so good an opportunity offers—wouldn't it?" looking down,
                  her face covered with blushes.</p>
               <p>There it was again. The time had evidently come for Jack to speak, but he
                  couldn't, but stood trembling before her—this strong, brave, stalwart man—a
                  choking in his throat and the beads of perspiration on his bare brow. At length,
                  controlling himself by a strong effort, he approached gently and said tenderly,
                  but decidedly:</p>
               <p>"No, it <emph>wouldn't,</emph> Marie. <emph>No one</emph> shall accompany you but
                  just myself and Wau-ki-na, whom I shall take to the city to educate. And now,
                  Marie, I had not intended to speak of this just here, and now, but it is, perhaps,
                  better. You know me as a plain, blunt, earnest man, of few words and fewer
                  pretences. You <emph>have</emph> known me from boyhood, and my feelings then
                  towards you. You know the cruel misunderstanding that drove me from your
                  presence—the roving, restless and unhappy life I've since led—the singular<pb
                     n="420-421" xml:id="VAC7175-00000217"/> gular manner in which I found you
                  again, and now, so help me God! nothing shall separate us more but the utterance
                  of your own lips. Speak, Marie, and say if this life-long love of mine, of late so
                  wonderfully renewed and strengthened, shall be in vain?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot speak only to say, Edward," Marie falteringly replied, looking up at
                  him, pale, but smiling through her tears, "that I <emph>do</emph> know you and
                  trust you and <emph>love you,</emph>" her voice sinking to a gentle whisper as she
                  extended her hand to meet his.</p>
               <p>"Thanks! thanks! dear Marie," joyfully exclaimed Jack, imprinting a most fervent
                  kiss on her lips, and drawing her blushing face to his bosom. "I've waited long,
                  long weary years for this, but I'm to be blest at last. You've made me, in truth,
                  a happy, happy man, and now no more about leaving and all such nonsense;" and the
                  two sat down together on the tree, and went over the past and forecast the future,
                  and there is no knowing how deep they would have gone into the day, had not
                  Wau-ki-na, fresh as a dew-drop and radiant as the morning, came tripping down upon
                  them, joyfully exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"Oh, you <emph>so</emph> naughty brother. I find you at last, and you, dear Marie,
                     <emph>you</emph> naughty, too "—shaking her finger at her. "Edward's men all
                  eat breakfast and don't know where you be. Why you no wake Wau-ki-na?"</p>
               <p>Then noticing the embarrassed manner of each, she peered saucily into his, and
                  then into her face, laughingly saying, "What you do here, and what you say? you
                  bofe look so funny!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Lucy," laughed Jack in a constrained, awkward sort of manner, "Marie and I
                  were just listening to that water-music, and watching the antics of those
                  squirrels."</p>
               <p>"What squirrels?" looking around. "I no see any squirrels."</p>
               <p>"Why, they were racing along that sapling a moment since, weren't they, Marie?" It
                  was nearly a full hour before, but lovers "take no note of time except from its
                  loss."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I know de whole trute," said Wau-ki-na, suddenly springing to her brother's
                  lap, putting her arms around his neck, and nestling her nut-brown face against his
                  brawny breast. "You tink little Indian girl know noting, but she very cute" (the
                  artless yet <emph>artful</emph> little minx had "been <emph>there</emph>" before
                  them). "You look wise and solemn as great owls, and <emph>now</emph> tell each
                  other what <emph>I</emph> know, and Mr. Talbot know, and everybody know,—you love
                  Marie and Marie love you, and I—love bofe together," taking a hand of each, and
                  laughing and crying at the same time. "Oh! we'll be so happy."</p>
               <p>"Well, Lucy, you sly little fox, you've about guessed it. And now since we're all
                  happy together, let's to breakfast, for I'm almost ashamed to confess it, I'm as
                  hungry as a wolf."</p>
               <p>As Jack strolled into camp, striving to look as indifferent and unconcerned as
                  possible, he soon found from the sly glances and laughs and side-talks of his men,
                  that they were no more blinded than was Lucy, and were almost as glad, too.</p>
               <p>The meal finished, the march back along the Kittanning path was speedily taken up,
                  the rangers forming a sort of escort about the two horses on which the girls were
                  seated, and as proud of and as attentive to them as if they were regular
                  "daughters of the regiment."</p>
               <p>Nothing occurred to hinder a rapid march. Whatever Indian parties were out, gave
                  wide berth to so large and formidable a company. The next day the mountains were
                  crossed, and finally Aughwick, a new settlement, where Colonel and a number of
                  friendly Indians resided, was reached.</p>

               <p>THE morning after his arrival, Jack was sitting at the door of a rude log cabin of
                  this frontier hamlet, watching the clumsy antics of a tame bear belonging to some
                  of the Indian boys, when Talbot, looking far better in his Shawnee than in his
                  civilized suit, approached him, but with a manner of some embarrassment.</p>
               <p>"Well, Captain, so far on our way back to civilization; and then, ho! for dear old
                  England again."</p>
               <p>"Why, Talbot, have you tired of our wild woods and rude frontier life so soon,
                  that you would thus take 'French leave' of us. It's rough, but it's exciting."</p>
               <p>"No, no; but now that our English army has been so badly defeated, I have somewhat
                  lost my interest in the country, but not in its people, Jack, I do assure you. And
                  what do <emph>you</emph> intend to do now?"</p>
               <p>"A question more easily asked than answered, Talbot. Since Braddock's defeat, this
                  exposed frontier post must be at once abandoned. I am on my road, with my hunters
                  and the settlers, to Harris' Ferry, there to consult with the Paxton Rangers, and
                  see what the government at Philadelphia are going to do at this crisis, for I take
                  it as a matter ter of course, Dunbar's shackeldy mob of an army is by this time
                  fleeing like the wind back to Fort Cumberland, and the whole range of frontier
                  valleys will soon be alive with those cursed, scalping thieves of redskins. We
                  start to-morrow, early. <emph>You</emph> will probably go on to-day?"</p>
               <p>"By no means. I stay with your Rangers, and with Wau—Lucy, I mean."</p>
               <p>"Yes, her Indian name had better be dropped now, as will soon your acquaintance
                  with her. She—well, indeed, all of us—will ever remind you of a strange, although
                  I hope not an unpleasant, episode in your roving life."</p>
               <p>"Why, Jack, it is of your sister I would like to speak with you a moment."</p>
               <p>"And what can Lord Talbot have to say about my sister," said Jack, unconsciously,
                  perhaps, assuming a stern and haughty air, which threw the Englishman into a state
                  of nervous embarrassment.</p>
               <p>"Why, <emph>this,</emph> Captain, that I have taken a desperate liking to her, and
                  I think she—that is to say I hope—"</p>
               <p>"She's taken the same to you; is that it?"</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, I—she—"</p>
               <p>"And you haven't <emph>dared</emph> to tell her this," flashed Jack, an ominous
                  frown on his brow and a dangerous light gathering in his eye.</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, Jack, I did, and also, that—"</p>
               <p>"What! after or before you knew she was my sister?"</p>
               <p>"After. It was that very discovery that made me hasten it," said Talbot, bristling
                  up in his turn.</p>
               <p>"Why, Talbot," said Jack, rising and sternly confronting the little lord, who
                  seemed to grow smaller as the scout rose to his full proportions, "by heavens,
                  this is unpardonable—'tis almost an insult. You should have known, sir, whatever
                  may have been your humors as regards Indian girls, that one so near to me is not
                  to be trifled with."</p>
               <p>"Trifled with, Jack!—why, man, I'm in dead earnest;<pb n="424-425"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000219"/> never was more serious in my life. If to love a
                  pure, sweet, lovely girl with all one's heart and soul, and with the most
                  respectful and honorable intentions of marriage is an insult, why, then, it does
                  not come from <emph>me,</emph> but from the fact."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! Talbot," answered Jack, but evidently with a more softened manner, "I
                  didn't think you could be such a goose. If you're in earnest, as you say, more's
                  the pity."</p>
               <p>"Why, Jack, this language is rude and contemptuous. From any other I could not and
                     <emph>would not</emph> endure it. Do you mean to intimate that my rank and
                  family are not good en—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, I know. They're far <emph>too</emph> good in the estimation of your
                  relatives and countrymen—not a whit too good in <emph>my</emph> opinion. Look
                  here, my lad, let's talk sense! Briefly and finally, I, as an American, am too
                  proud and have too much self-respect to ally me or mine to a foreigner of rank,
                  and least of all to an Englishman, where the feeling of <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >caste</foreign> is as strong as among the Indian Brahmins, and where a man is
                  not so much esteemed for what he is himself, as for who was his
                  great-great-great-grandfather.'</p>
               <p>"Yes, but Jack, <emph>my</emph> family are not of that kind, and will surely
                  welcome the object of my choice. Lucy <emph>is</emph> my choice, and—"</p>
               <p>"Yes; well, we wont risk it," rather sneered Jack. "Love for <emph>you</emph>
                  might make your family tolerant of <emph>her.</emph> 'Twould be a notable
                  exception if it <emph>did,</emph> but English society would turn their backs on a
                  simple American girl, without dower or pedigree—and she too raised among Indians.
                  No! no! Talbot, don't mention the matter again! 'Tis offensive. What you call your
                     <emph>love</emph> is but a passing whim, born of the occasion and the singular
                  circumstances which have thrown you two together."</p>
               <p>"Jack, you're hard on me," answered Talbot, with much feeling, greatly hurt rather
                  than angry. "Be more just. <emph>You</emph> love Miss de Bonneville, and intend
                  very shortly to marry her. (Here Jack winced.) Is it strange that I should wish to
                  do the same with Lucy? You wouldn't compliment your <emph>own</emph> judgment and
                  Miss de Bonneville's merits at the expense of <emph>my</emph> taste and the charms
                  of your own sister, would you?"</p>
               <p>"Well, Talbot, that's well put—rather a neat turn on me—what the Philadelphia
                  lawyers used to call when I was there, the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">argumentum ad
                     hominem,</foreign>" laughed out Jack, now completely disarmed. "I'll tell you
                  how we'll leave the matter. <emph>You</emph> think you love Lucy. <emph>I</emph>
                  am sure it is a passing whim, which will vanish when you come among the stately
                  English beauties of your own rank and station, if it do not even before. Now, I'll
                  question Lucy at once: if I find she sincerely returns your affection you may, if
                  you please, accompany us as far as Philadelphia, where I intend putting her in
                  good hands for at least two years to be educated and accomplished. You pledge me
                  your word that, until you leave the country, you will act towards her only as a
                  friend, and not as the ardent and devoted lover. At the end of two years, if your
                  love stands the test of time, and your family give their <emph>full</emph> consent
                  to the marriage, Lucy is free to take or reject you, as she may then feel
                  inclined. What say you?"</p>
               <p>"That your terms are har—very hard, but I acknowledge your right to impose
                  conditions. Say <emph>one</emph> year, and I accept them."</p>
               <p>"Not a month less. I am proud to know Lucy is a pure, sweet, good girl, singularly
                  uncontaminated by her life and associations; but you know how and among whom she
                  has passed her days, and it will require <emph>full</emph> that time," said Jack,
                  with a peculiar uncredulous smile showing itself for a moment on his lips, "to fit
                  her for the exalted position she's to occupy. What do you decide?"</p>
               <p>"That I must accept, but will keep her company until my departure. Should my
                  family refuse their consent, by<pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC7175-00000220"/> jove!
                  I'll return and live in America, and cut my own way. I swear—"</p>
               <p>"'Swear not at all,' one good book says, and another, 'lovers' vows are false as
                  dicers' oaths,'" laughingly replied Jack, as he sauntered off to a little sugar
                  grove where his men were encamped.</p>
               <p>That same evening Jack had a long and confidential conversation with Marie, in
                  which—among <emph>other</emph> matters—they fully discussed the affair between
                  Talbot and Lucy. Marie finally disappeared in the cabin, and sent the unthinking
                  girl out to her brother. She seemed—scarce knowing why—somewhat shy and flustered
                  before a peculiar grave look in his face, but tripped lightly up to his side, took
                  his hand between both of hers, and said:</p>
               <p>"Edward, I'm <emph>so</emph> glad you be Lucy's brother. I never leave you—not any
                  more. I learn to talk English very fast—seems as if I knew it all before,
                  and"—here a slight hesitation—"and, Mr. Talbot take much trouble to teach me."</p>
               <p>"He does, does he, Lucy? Well," looking steadily into her face and dark eyes," and
                  what do you think of him?"</p>
               <p>"Him? oh, he talk so fast, and some words I 'fraid very bad,"</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! little simpleton, what do you think of him—as a <emph>man,</emph> I
                  mean?"</p>
               <p>"A man? Why he very nice, pretty little man—not so broad and strong like you,
                  Edward, and his hair too stiff, and not long and curly like my own brother's; but
                  he have soft eyes, just like a fawn's, and very, <emph>very</emph> sweet
                  smile."</p>
               <p>Nonsense, thought Jack. What use in questioning her artlessness. She's innocent as
                  a child, as indeed, a child she is.</p>
               <p>"Lucy, you've seen a good deal of Talbot lately. Before fore he and you knew I was
                  your brother did he ever say anything to you improper?"</p>
               <p>Lucy looked at him with wondering, questioning eyes "I don't know that word,
                  Edward. What does it say?"</p>
               <p>"I mean did he ever say anything to make your cheeks blush—anything he ought not
                  to have said to a young innocent maiden?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, Edward;" showing him then how charmingly her cheeks <emph>could</emph>
                  blush. "He told me I was the prettiest and sauciest little witch he ever saw, and
                  that I had a very funny little nose, and a dear, weeny-teeny foot, and that some
                  fine day he would like to make me his little Indian wife."</p>
               <p>"What more, Lucy?"</p>
               <p>"More? not much till that day on the island when I told him you was my dear
                  brother, then he said if I loved him he would make me his little wife. He would,
                  'by Jove', dey were his very words. Who can Jove be, Edward? some dear friend? I
                  'spect."</p>
               <p>"And then what did <emph>you</emph> say?" laughed Jack in spite of himself, his
                  regard for Talbot's prudence and sincerity evidently increasing.</p>
               <p>"Let's see; I most forget, Edward—so long ago—but I'm <emph>sure</emph> I told him
                  I loved him, and, I tink, Jove, too."</p>
               <p>"You did, you queer little riddle. And when was all this?—before—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, before you told Marie—on that log, you know, you were so long time busy
                  watching squirrels—that you loved <emph>her,</emph> and she told you if so you
                  did, why then she loved you."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! Lucy. I don't believe you're neat as artless as you look, and why
                  didn't you tell me all this before?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Edward, <emph>you</emph> never told Lucy that you loved Marie. I had to find
                  it with my own two eyes. First<pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC7175-00000221"/> thing I
                  see—down on that same tree, you know—you take her face, and draw it towards you,
                  and then—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, silence, you little blather, I'm in too awkward a fix myself to make much out
                  of you. But now let me ask you <emph>seriously;</emph> do you think you really
                  care enough for Talbot to be willing to be his wife? Have you ever thought of
                  that?"</p>
               <p>"Y-e-e-s, Edward, I tink I have, but"—her eyes appearing brim full of mischief—"he
                  just little, <emph>little</emph> bit too short. Why he no taller than me; no
                  higher than the fringe on your hunting-shirt."</p>
               <p>"Oh, run away into the cabin, Lucy, I can't make anything out of you, but first
                  let me warn you to be very stiff and proud—so—before Talbot, while we are going to
                  the big city."</p>
               <p>"I will, Edward," very demurely. "I be <emph>very</emph> proud. When he say he go
                  away over the big water, I look so"—putting on a pensive and pouty expression,
                  "and when he take my hand and kiss and hurt it—just as I saw you kiss and hurt
                  poor Marie's to-day—I look so," and the little mischief drew herself up haughtily,
                  frowned severely, and looked as stern as possible, until Jack had to burst into a
                  hearty laugh, as he turned away.</p>
               <p>Wau-ki-na tripped back towards the cabin with a conscious look of triumph on her
                  face, as much as to say, "Didn't I get through that well?" and just as she was
                  entering the door, she turned and gave her brother this parting shot, "Oh, I
                  behave myself very much—you don't know. I not so wise as Marie, but then I'm
                     <emph>so</emph> young and little Indian maid, but I watch you two all the time.
                  Then I learn so fast, and do just right."</p>
               <p>Early next morning they were on their march to John Harris' Ferry (now
                  Harrisburg), which they reached without incident of note. Here they found all in a
                  state of excitement. The news of Braddock's disaster had but just reached them,
                  and the Paxton Rangers were out with their Colonel, the Rev. Mr. Elder—the
                  "fighting parson," as he was called; for many years pastor of the Scotch-Irish
                  churches at Paxton and Derry—dressed in his cocked hat, and with rifle on
                  shoulder.</p>

               <p>THE welcome accorded by the Paxton Rangers to Capt. Jack's scouts, and especially
                  to the ladies in their company, was most warm and cordial. As yet they had only
                  heard a flying rumor of Braddock's disgraceful defeat—but Jack, who had been
                  actually in the thickest of the fight, and who had afterwards witnessed on Smoky
                  Island the inhuman tortures of the prisoners, was enabled to give full
                  details.</p>
               <p>These brave but rude and unlettered frontiersmen hung on his every word, and when
                  the full extent of the disaster was known, there was an anxious discussion of its
                  probable results. All agreed that the whole border—unprotected as it was—would
                  necessarily be exposed to the fell sweep of French-Indian incursions.</p>
               <p>The brave and greatly beloved Rev. Col. Elder—with his small cocked hat and his
                  long rifle swung on shoulder—counselled a general banding along the Susquehanna
                  for mutual protection, and made vouch for the fighting qualities ties of the
                  Scotch-Irish boys of Paxton, Derry, Hanover and Donegal.</p>
               <p>Capt. Lazarus Stewart, a daring partizan of unusual influence in those days—he who
                  a few years afterwards led the cruel attack on the Conestoga Indians, and
                  subsequently the slaughter of the survivors placed in the Lancaster jail for
                  protection—backed up his pastor, and advised the erection of block houses and a
                  general muster of the fighting men of the frontier.</p>
               <p>And there, too, was John Harris, the son of the brave Esther Say, the subsequent
                  founder of Harrisburg, and at that time proprietor of "John Harris' Ferry," a
                  point of such importance in those years, and so widely known abroad, that letters
                  in Ireland, Scotland, and Germany, were directed "care of John Harris, Harris'
                  Ferry, North America." He was then about thirty years old and one of the most
                  active and indomitable spirits and the most extensive Indian trader on the whole
                  frontier. His hospitable mansion, which was surrounded with stockades and had
                  therewith connected a long row of sheds for the storing of skins and furs, was
                  generously thrown open with all its good cheer and bounty to both companies.</p>
               <p>And there, too, were Geo. Fisher, the founder of Middletown, and Marcus Hulings,
                  who dwelt on Duncan's Island, and Matthew Smith and James Gibson, and other
                  notable worthies of that daring, restless, "wild-turkey breed" of men, who, almost
                  beyond the reach of the laws of the province, were a law unto themselves.</p>
               <p>The next day was to witness a ceremony of great interest to out readers. Jack had
                  scarcely come in contact with his old friend, the Rev. Col. Elder, before he made
                  him a confidant of the whole history of his acquaintance with Marie de Bonneville;
                  his reunion with her after so many years of absence; his intended journey to
                  Philadelphia.</p>
               <pb n="432-433" xml:id="VAC7175-00000223"/>
               <p>On account of the unsettled state of affairs, Marie's unprotected situation, the
                  long journey before them, the presence of an old friend to officiate, and other
                  cogent, conducing circumstances, it was the parson's prompt counsel that the
                  marriage between them should be celebrated at once. This was Jack's own opinion;
                  and, after a long and persuasive conversation with the object of his regard, he at
                  length won her blushing consent that, under the circumstances, it was the most
                  fitting thing to do.</p>
               <p>And so it was resolved, and the news soon spread among the members of both
                  companies. As Jack's party were to start on horseback early on the morrow for
                  Philadelphia, that very night was agreed upon for the solemn rite, and a dense
                  grove of large sugar-maples which skirted the Susquehanna near "the ferry,"
                  selected as the most appropriate place.</p>
               <p>As evening drew near, all was made ready for the ceremony. The Rangers composing
                  the two companies took a wonderful interest in the occasion. They had gathered in
                  groups during the afternoon and discussed the great change about to happen the
                  dashing, reckless, and withal mysterious "Wild Hunter of the Juniata." They told
                  each other all they could gather of his history; his early love and
                  disappointment; the murder of his family; the captivity of his beautiful sister,
                  and his strange reunion with both sister and his first and only love. Each had
                  trigged himself up somewhat in honor of the occasion, while a number of curious
                  invited visitors, male and female, from Derry, Hanover and Donegal, hastened to
                  lend their presence at the ceremony. Wau-ki-na was in a wonderful state of
                  excitement all day. Now she was all smiles and laughter and merriment; and now all
                  tears and sobs; would now coyly accept the honeyed words and blandishments of
                  Talbot, and anon—with all a betrothed woman's caprice—would pout and tease and
                  scold him. Her preparation of the bride's dress was a very easy thing. Those were
                  old-fashioned times, when but little attention was paid outside of the largest
                  cities to exterior personal adornment. Marie sensibly preferred standing up in her
                  half-Indian dress, which, however, with its ornamented moccasins, buskins and
                  bright-hued skirt, was unusually picturesque and becoming.</p>
               <p>Indeed she had no other. All that she possessed of the dresses and decorations at
                  that time fashionable in the city, had been left in Frazier's cabin hard by the
                  late bloody battle-field. She needed little, indeed, to make her attractive.
                  Wau-ki-na had taken great pains to arrange and decorate with a few flowers her
                  friend's luxuriant hair, and when, all being ready—supported on the one side by
                  the proud and happy Captain of the scouts, and on the other by his gentle and
                  modest sister clad in her Indian costume—she passed with grave face but firm tread
                  under the shadow of the trees, there was a universal feeling of admiration among
                  the rough but gallant hunters assembled there. They talked in low tones to each
                  other of her grace, her beauty and her dignity.</p>
               <p>All was now prepared. Two great fires had been kindled on a gentle acclivity right
                  on the margin of the broad river, and as their bright flames leaped into the air,
                  illumining the deep shades of the solemn old maple grove, casting broad reaches of
                  light athwart the Susquehanna, and bringing out into bold relief the two companies
                  of Rangers, every man of them leaning on his trusty rifle, the whole scene was
                  impressive and picturesque in the extreme.</p>
               <p>When Jack and Marie, flanked by Talbot and Wau-ki-na, had taken position between
                  the two fires, which were about fifty yards apart, the Rev. Col. Elder appeared
                  before them, and, with the simple yet solemn service of the Presbyterian faith,
                  made the "twain one flesh." The whole<pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC7175-00000224"/>
                  ceremony closed with a fervent and impressive prayer, the sturdy Presbyterian
                  Rangers bowing their heads in devout attention, and then, clustering about the
                  beaming and happy couple, they made the forest ring with three hearty cheers for
                  the bravest and most reckless scout of the border.</p>
               <p>A plentiful feast of game and fish was the next thing in order, followed by a
                  dance on the green sward, and then by games, rifle shooting, and what not; and
                  when Jack and his blushing bride rose from the green to go towards John Harris'
                  hospitable cabin, they were escorted by the parson and a company of Rangers on
                  either side, and afterwards serenaded with some of the wild, ringing songs then in
                  fashion along the border.</p>
               <p>Of all the jocund, buoyant spirits present on this auspicious occasion, sure the
                  happiest and merriest was Talbot. He seemed to live for the present and was during
                  the whole evening just in his element. No foot tripped so lightly in the dance; no
                  voice was so joyous and jubilant, and no laugh was so ringing and infectious as
                  just this happy little lord's. The rough, stalwart border-rangers had taken a
                  wonderful fancy to the dapper little Indian chief, and it must be confessed that
                  not only did his Shawnee decorations become him, but also that he
                     <emph>knew</emph> that they did, and he would not now have exchanged them for
                  the finest silk and velvet.</p>
               <p>Wau-ki-na, upon whom he was ever a close attendant, stood or sat shyly and
                  contentedly at his side, evidently greatly pleased at his exuberant flow of
                  spirits; "his quips, and cranks and wanton wiles," and at the many attentions paid
                  him by the Rangers. Talbot had managed during the evening to find frequent
                  occasion for little side talks and bursts of tenderness, and when the two were
                  about to part at the cabin, he quietly drew her aside and whispered:</p>
               <p>"And now, Wau-ki-na, I <emph>do</emph> hope you will think seriously ously of your
                  brother's marriage, and prevail on him to follow it up by a second one when we
                  come to Philadelphia."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! no!" mischievously broke in Wau-ki-na, wilfully bent on misunderstanding
                  him. "That would be bad. He no marry two times. Marie make him a very good wife.
                  He want no other. Edward no Indian chief to want one, two, three squaw, that—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, pshaw! Wau-ki-na, that wont do! You know well that I mean <emph>our</emph>
                  marriage. You've promised me to become my own little wife, and—"</p>
               <p>"But Edward say," demurely responded the little maiden, "you make fun of poor
                  Wau-ki-na, and that you go away and forget her; and that your father great white
                  chief, and too high to have American daughter. I 'fraid so, too, and—"</p>
               <p>"All stuff—confounded twaddle and nonsense, Wau-ki-na! If <emph>he</emph> thinks
                  so, <emph>you</emph> mustn't. I vow to you—but what's the use of saying more than
                  a thousand times, how deeply and truly I love you."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," eagerly exclaimed the innocent girl. "Say it yet more. Wau-ki-na never
                  tired. It make music in her ear."</p>
               <p>"Well, I <emph>do</emph> say it again;" and if your brother <emph>will</emph> be
                  so unjust to me, why not let me show my honesty by an instant marriage?"</p>
               <p>"No! no! that cannot be! I too proud"—drawing herself up and throwing back her
                  head—"and my brother too proud. He tell me all, and I must go to school and learn
                  English, and dress like city girl, and you wait only one, two year, and
                     <emph>then,</emph> if you love Wau-ki-na, she—she—"</p>
               <p>"Well, what? you little witch!"</p>
               <p>"Witch! witch? Edward say that a bad word. You mustn't—"</p>
               <p>"Well, maybe <emph>this</emph> is bad, too"—suddenly seizing her<pb n="436-437"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000225"/> earnest-looking face between his hands, and
                  imprinting a burning kiss upon her pouting lips. "If it <emph>is,</emph> I'm
                  devilish wicked, and what's more, as unrepentant as the Old Boy."</p>
               <p>"There! take dat for dat!" answered the imperious beauty, smiting him lightly on
                  the cheek with her hand, and running towards the cabin. "Edward say—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, bother Edward! while he <emph>says,</emph> I <emph>do!</emph> Good-night!
                  I'll see you bright and early to-morrow!" and the young roysterer turned to join
                  the Rangers, who seemed bent on making a night of it.</p>

               <p>EARLY the next morning Talbot, the Half-King, Wau-ki-na, Jack and his wife, were
                  mounted on horses, kindly provided by John Harris, and started on their long
                  journey to Philadelphia. That evening, after a pleasant day's ride, they reached
                  Lancaster, and found the bad news had preceded them, and the little town in great
                  commotion. Knots of excited citizens stood on the corners discussing the late
                  battle, and Jack and Scarooyaddy were eagerly surrounded and forced to tell a
                  score of times the story of the defeat and rout. Had the good burghers known the
                  full extent of the disaster, and that even then Dunbar's army was in marvellously
                  rapid retreat for Will's Creek and Fort Cumberland, excitement would have grown
                  almost to panic.</p>
               <p>Off again in the morning, and making rapid progress to the big city. All along the
                  route every one was discussing the great battle, and Jack had often to repeat his
                  story to eager questioners. No incident of note happened, and on the evening of
                  the fifth day, our party entered the city and put up at the Royal George Inn.</p>
               <pb n="438-439" xml:id="VAC7175-00000226"/>
               <p>The news of the arrival of the famous Captain Jack and Half-King was soon noised
                  abroad, and the house was rapidly crowded. By this time the disaster was pretty
                  well known throughout the city. It created intense excitement and dismay, the more
                  so since no adverse tidings had been expected by any one. Governor Morris, on his
                  return that very day from Carlisle, where he had personally examined some of
                  Braddock's fugitive wagoners, had been insulted on the public street for giving
                  out that Braddock and his fine army of British regulars had been defeated. Many of
                  the citizens had even raised subscriptions for general bonfires for the victory
                  which was sure to crown their arms. The direful news, therefore, came upon the
                  Quaker City like "a clap of thunder from a clear sky."</p>
               <p>Our party had not been long in their quarters before Dr. Franklin, then
                  postmaster-general, and a philosopher and public man of great influence, hearing
                  of their arrival, and knowing well both Jack and the Half-King, called upon them,
                  and insisted upon taking Jack, his wife, and sister, to his own modest mansion,
                  where all were made most heartily welcome. Jack was very thoroughly questioned by
                  the Doctor and all he knew about the battle gleaned from him.</p>
               <p>Next day the Pennsylvania Assembly met, and both Jack and the Half-King were
                  publicly thanked for the gallant part they had taken in the late struggle, and a
                  choice piece of proprietary land on the Juniata was donated by the Governor and
                  Council to the former.</p>
               <p>Meantime a suitable and fashionable dress of the day was procured for Wau-ki-na,
                  by which—although she could not look more attractive than she had in her modest
                  and becoming Delaware attire—so changed was her appearance, and such an air of
                  grace and dignity given her, that even Talbot, when he saw her, gave forth a long
                  whistle of surprise prise and admiration. She scarcely seemed the same Indian girl
                  whom he had loved and courted.</p>
               <p>By Franklin's aid, also, a very pleasant and retired boarding school for young
                  ladies was found, and Wau-ki-na was comfortably ensconced in her new home and
                  immediately commenced her studies.</p>
               <p>Talbot, who had speedily doffed his Shawnee dress, had decked himself out in a
                  complete modish suit of the day—and the gentlemen's fashions of those days were
                     <emph>very</emph> odd and peculiar—including wig, velvet small clothes, silken
                  hose and silver-buckled shoes; and on his first formal visit to Wau-ki-na,
                  afforded as great a surprise to her as she had to him.</p>
               <p>As soon as the lady principal of the school had left the room, Wau-ki-na, who had
                  for many minutes been carefully and blushingly scrutinizing the young lord from
                  his buckles up to the crown of his curled wig, and with an amusing mixture of
                  curiosity and embarrassment, hastily rose, tripped over the floor, gave out a
                  musical yet provoking little laugh, and said:</p>
               <p>"You not the little Shawnee Chief I knew in the woods, and <emph>I</emph> not the
                  Delaware maiden you say—so many times—you love so hard. I tink,"—extending her
                  dainty wee hand—"we better be introduced again, don't you?"</p>
               <p>"That's a happy thought, Wau-ki-na," said Talbot, taking her hand and offering her
                  a kiss, about which there was a slight quarrel, ending in a sad bungle. "And if I
                  had the time, I'd like to make love to you all over again; but, alas, I haven't,
                  but sail to-morrow from the Delaware direct for England."</p>
               <p>"What?"—growing pale of a sudden—"Edward did not—oh, no—you mustn't do—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Wau-kin-na; would like to stay, but I know the Captain; have taken my
                  passage; am watched as if I was a woman-stealer when I come to see you, and
                  besides, your<pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC7175-00000227"/> countrymen are getting so
                  deucedly disagreeable and decidedly personal in their remarks about British
                  regulars and British courage and British arrogance; but I'll be back soon to claim
                  you. <emph>Be sure of that!</emph> and now I have a few parting words for you. But
                  come! let's sit on yon sofa;" and taking her unresisting hand, he led her to a
                  seat, and for some time the two chatted and murmured and whispered those tender
                  little nothings which have weight and meaning only to those interested.</p>
               <p>The reappearance of the lady of the house, with that well-known look of surprise
                  and disapproval on the face so intimately known in ladies' boarding schools when
                  the fair inmates receive visits from <emph>cousins,</emph> put a <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">finale</foreign> to the interview.</p>
               <p>The next day Jack, accompanied by Marie and Wau-ki-na, proceeded to the Delaware
                  to take leave of Talbot. There lay the huge ship which was to carry him home, her
                  bowsprit almost touching the line of low wooden stores which lined the wharf.</p>
               <p>Climbing up her steep sides, they were welcomed by Talbot, his hands outstretched
                  and his eyes beaming with pleasure. "Well, Jack, this is <emph>too</emph> kind of
                  you!—more than I expected; though I must say, I longed for it; and you, too,
                  ladies, I'm glad you cast a thought on a poor devil of a foreigner about to make a
                  lonely and tedious voyage. I only wish you were all going along."</p>
               <p>These last words were addressed to the whole party, but his eyes rested
                  affectionately on Wau-ki-na, who stood timid and downcast behind her brother.</p>
               <p>"Why, of course, Talbot," warmly answered Jack, "we couldn't think of allowing an
                  old and pleasant companion—one for whom we all have a warm regard—to leave America
                  without bidding him a hearty 'God speed;' but you'll be back again, you know, in
                  the course of time, eh?" a peculiar smile lighting up his swarthy countenance.</p>
               <p>"Of course I will," vehemently protested Talbot, adding: "Excuse me, ladies, but
                  would you promenade the deck a minute while I have a word with this incorrigible
                  man," and linking his arm in Jack's, he said earnestly: "Jack, still unfair and
                  suspicious of me. Why do you doubt the depth and sincerity of my love for Lucy? I,
                  doubtless, have appeared light and trifling to you—maybe it's my nature, but I
                  hope I'm a true man and have eyes to discern, sense to appreciate, and heart to
                  love a true woman. Confound it, man, it chafes me!"</p>
               <p>"Not a word more, my lord," said Jack, feelingly. "I <emph>must</emph> say that
                  you have behaved truly and honorably towards Lucy, even when you supposed her no
                  other than a simple Indian girl, and I thank you for it and am not the man to
                  forget it. I'm sure you have a strong liking for her, as well as she for you; but,
                  excuse me, I have known so many of these passing fancies—the creatures of occasion
                  and romantic association—that I don't put much faith in them."</p>
               <p>"But, Jack—"</p>
               <p>"One word more," quickly replied the scout, "and let's end the subject. I cannot
                  brook any trifling in this affair. Let the matter rest as I arranged it. Should
                  your affection for my sister outlive the prejudices and the attractions of your
                  proud English society, and should you, after two years' absence and with the full
                  consent of your relatives, return to claim Lucy, then let it be between you and
                  her; I'm content. There, now, say no more, but let's join the rest."</p>
               <p>After an hour's promenade about the vessel—wonderful novelty to Wau-ki-na—the
                  signal was given to loose ship, and our party went ashore, watching the vessel
                  with interest as she moved out into, and then dropped down the stream, and waving
                  handkerchiefs so long as Talbot could be seen. They then slowly turned away,

               <p>Jack did not stay long in the city. It was as distasteful to him as to Marie. They
                  were both <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en rapport</foreign> as regards the location of
                  a home and longed for the wilderness again. The happy couple traversed the
                  streets, making together sundry purchases of clothing, furniture, and utensils
                  necessary to set up the plain and simple housekeeping of those days, and arranged
                  to have them immediately sent out on pack-horses.</p>

               <p>ALL necessaries bought, the two again mounted horse, and travelled by easy rides
                  back to Harris' Ferry. Having "ample verge and room enough" wherein to choose to
                  his own fancy, Jack was not long in selecting a site for his farm and humble
                  dwelling.</p>
               <p>It was on the margin of the "blue Juniata," not far from where it <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">debouches</foreign> into the Susquehanna, and near what was then
                  called Juneauta, but now Duncan's Island, on the latter river. A rich and grassy
                  bottom was here flanked on the one side by a noble forest of beech, maple, oak and
                  elm, and bordered on the other by a noisy, rapid-running little stream of clear,
                  sparkling water, which tumbled down through a sombre ravine in a series of rapids,
                  ending in a cascade of some ten or twelve feet high. The whole country around,
                  though broken and rugged, was yet exceedingly picturesque. Sherman's Creek was
                  near by, while the Kittatinny Mountains could be distinctly seen to the south, and
                  the Tuscarora Mountains to the northwest.</p>
               <p>Here, then, Jack and Marie resolved to build their home. It was a very paradise
                  for a hunter. The woods and<pb n="444-445" xml:id="VAC7175-00000229"/> mountains
                  were full of deer, bear and panther, and all the streams abounded in fish. While
                  not too far from the confines of civilization, there were but very few adventurous
                  spirits who lived higher up the stream. A number of friendly Indians frequented
                  the country, and had a town on the island at the Juneata's mouth.</p>
               <p>Jack, assisted by some of his Rangers, was for some time kept busy building his
                  rude but comfortable log cabin, which he finished and furnished with a care and
                  taste unusual with frontier habitations. He then devoted himself to clearing and
                  embellishing the grounds, and soon there grew up in that lone, wild spot, a neat,
                  cozy, and heartsome home, where Jack and Marie lived contented and happy.</p>
               <p>For many months they dwelt in peace, undisturbed by the incursions of hostile
                  Indians, and occasionally visited by the old Half-King, who was always made most
                  heartily welcome and who lingered about the cabin for days at a time, making his
                  frequent hunting excursions, and keeping the table of his old friend and companion
                  abundantly supplied with the finest of game. He would then grow restless and
                  quietly disappear for weeks, absent on some lone scout, or on some accredited
                  mission to the Indians west and north; or sometimes he went in company with the
                  far-famed Indian interpreter and ambassador, Conrade Weiser.</p>
               <p>At length troublous times came. Savage slaughters and inhumanities grew fearfully
                  near. Then Jack put himself at the head of his gallant Rangers, and scoured the
                  valleys like a storm, from the Juniata even down to the Potomac; sorely smiting
                  the savage foe, and beating him back in every direction, until his very name
                  became a talisman of protection to the frontier, and equally so carried dread and
                  dismay to the pitiless marauders.</p>
               <p>Twice was Jack compelled—so near and threatening did Indian incursions become—to
                  remove his wife to Lancaster. But then came quieter times. When the hardy
                  frontiersmen had learned the necessity of banding together and acting and fighting
                  in concert, forts were built as rallying points along the exposed border.</p>
               <p>Two years had now passed since what was generally known throughout the country as
                  "the great battle." The Indian troubles still continued, but had been transferred
                  more to the north or south of the locality where Captain Jack had pitched his lot,
                  yet such had already been the effect of the frequent and desolating savage
                  onslaughts, that whereas in the summer of '55 there were, west of the Susquehanna,
                  full three thousand fighting men, there were <emph>now</emph> left only about one
                  hundred of the more tenacious and reckless of them, who, despite the constant
                  menace and harassment from small roving bands of Indians, and the terrible
                  suspense ever hanging over them like a Damocles' sword, still clung to their
                  chosen homes.</p>
               <p>On a pleasant evening of July '57, just after an early supper, Jack and Marie sat
                  together on the rustic stoup of "The Hermitage"—as they were sportively but not
                  altogether inappropriately accustomed to call their isolated home. Our old friend
                  Scarooyaddy had been on a two weeks' visit to them, and he and Jack had been out
                  since early morning on one of their grand hunts. Two gaunt, shaggy stag hounds, of
                  great size and power—which had been mysteriously left at Jack's door by a passing
                  Indian trader over a year before, by order from Philadelphia as he said—lay tired
                  and snoring in front of the house. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Two dogs of black St. Hubert's breed,</l>
                        <l>Unmatched for courage, breath and speed."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Jack took to these splendid dogs at once—no such staunch, tireless hunters in the
                  whole country. They would follow with unflagging zeal and attack with wonderful
                  courage any kind of game, and both Jack and his wife credited them to Talbot, but
                  never could find out anything for certain as to the giver.</p>
               <pb n="446-447" xml:id="VAC7175-00000230"/>
               <p>The old Chief was even now walking gravely around the cabin, his face ever and
                  anon breaking into grim smiles and grins, a merry, laughing child of some fourteen
                  months perched on his back, one chubby little hand about the Indian's neck, and
                  the other holding fast to the pendant scalp-lock. It was Jack and Marie's darling
                  boy, and proud enough they were of him.</p>
               <p>Lucy, too, had finished her schooling, and had gladdened their home by her gentle
                  presence for a full month. She was now nearly eighteen and had grown into ripe
                  womanhood, but was so changed in her appearance from the time we knew her last,
                  that she would be scarcely recognizable. With, of course, the same black and
                  luxuriant hair, earnest brilliant eyes, and rich, brunette complexion, her person
                  had grown somewhat taller and more rounded. To the grace and ease of manner which
                  were native to her, there had been added a dignity, a certain womanly charm and a
                  matured beauty, which, even in the great city, had attracted notice and compelled
                  admiration. Her simplicity, artlessness, and sweet, winning ways had continued
                  with her—nay, had increased with her growth, and she had gathered many friends and
                  admirers and was generally esteemed a beautiful and charming little woman. Both
                  Jack and Marie were very proud of her.</p>
               <p>On <emph>this</emph> evening she was neatly and tastefully attired, and half an
                  hour before had taken a ramble alone in the direction of the little water-fall in
                  the glen before alluded to, but with a manner so pensive and distraught, that
                  Marie could scarcely help observing it.</p>
               <p>"Do you know, husband," she remarked with an air of anxiety, "that I'm getting
                  concerned about Lucy. She does not appear herself. I have noted her growing
                  melancholy. She sighs more than is natural for one of her age; likes to wander by
                  herself; seems to be absent-minded, as if something were on her heart. I fear it's
                  that old affair with Talbot, and that her feeling for him was far deeper than
                  either she or we thought."</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> have watched her, too, Marie," answered Jack, scoffingly, "and am
                     <emph>sure</emph> it's that. You have given all the standard symptoms. What did
                  I tell you and her? That Talbot was a trifler, and had but a mere passing whim for
                  Lucy; and that as soon as he was out of sight and among his relatives and old
                  associations, he'd forget her entirely. The scoundrel! never even to have written
                  or sent any message whatever. I knew," he added bitterly, "his 'deep love,' as he
                  called it, wouldn't last longer than one of his wigs, but I <emph>did</emph> think
                  he would have been <emph>man</emph> enough to write and tell us so, frankly. I
                  tell you, Marie, he's a fraud, and if I could get at his impudent lordship, I'd
                  teach him a lesson he wouldn't forget in a hurry."</p>
               <p>"Did you ever speak to Lucy on the subject?" continued Marie, after a reflective
                  pause.</p>
               <p>"Well, no—not formally. You know at first we used to quiz her somewhat about him
                  in our letters, but after the months passed and no word from him, <emph>I</emph>
                  felt hurt and <emph>she</emph> felt hurt, and so his name was dropped entirely,
                  and it's best not to revive it and for us to appear as if we had entirely
                  forgotten him, nor noted anything amiss with her. 'Tis one of those cases where
                  time alone can bring healing."</p>
               <p>"But still, Edward, I feel keenly for the dear girl and think I'll take some early
                  occasion to question her. I've already made attempts that way, but Lucy has at
                  times such a haughty way about her and such a peculiar repelling reserve, that I
                  liked not to venture further. But <emph>do</emph> look at the old Chief, husband!
                  He'll surely drop that child!"</p>
               <p>Scarooyaddy had just seated the boy on the top of his shaved pate, and the little
                  fellow was testifying his huge delight by loud crows and laughs.</p>
               <pb n="448-449" xml:id="VAC7175-00000231"/>
               <p>"Oh," laughed Jack, "trust the Chief for that! He's raised a big family of
                  papooses, and I'm delighted that the lonely old man can take such a grandfatherly
                  interest in child of mine. Why, Marie, he just <emph>dotes</emph> on little Eddy
                  and I do believe comes here more to play and romp with <emph>him</emph> than to
                  see <emph>us;</emph> but look, wife, who can those two horsemen be turning up our
                  road? Blamed if they ain't coming here! Uncommonly genteel-looking persons, too.
                  Who <emph>can</emph> they be? The one in front is surely not Parson Elder—he's too
                  gray for him," and Jack rose up and advanced to the steps.</p>
               <p>Sure enough, the horses now approached on a brisk trot and stopped before the
                  door, the two hounds—disturbed from dreams of the chase—starting forward with an
                  angry snarl, which was soon changed to joyful leaps and mad gambols as they jumped
                  towards the saddle of the first horseman.</p>
               <p>"Down! Chester! and you, Hector, down!—down! I say. Is that the rude way you
                  receive strangers? For shame!" sternly shouted Jack; but the dogs would
                     <emph>not</emph> down but continued in a wonderful state of joy and excitement,
                  when the elder of the gentlemen, taking off his three-cornered hat, uncovering a
                  very full, curling wig, and bowing very courteously, said:</p>
               <p>"Don't blame the dogs, my dear sir. They have good reason to remember me, as they
                  are of the best blood from my own kennel. I believe I have the pleasure of seeing
                  Mr. Edward Percy?"</p>
               <p>"That's my <emph>real</emph> name, sir," spoke Jack in great surprise; "but not
                  the one I'm known by on this frontier. Will you alight, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Thank you, yes. 'Twould have been better, perhaps, for this young man here,"
                  waving his hand to his companion, who now advanced to the fore, "to have presented
                  me, rather than for me to introduce myself. He claims both you and your wife as
                  friends."</p>
               <p>"Why, Jack! don't you know an old acquaintance? <emph>There's</emph> friendship
                  for you, with a vengeance! You once had a desperate close grip of my throat, and
                  the night after, <emph>I</emph> had a bead drawn on you and was near sending you
                  to the 'happy hunting grounds.' I think we <emph>ought</emph> to know each
                  other."</p>
               <p>"Why, eh! What?" said Jack hesitatingly and gazing earnestly at the young man; "it
                  can't be, and yet it <emph>is,</emph> by Jehoshaphat. Here! Marie! Chief! Lucy!
                  here's the little Shawnee chief back again! You've bravely redeemed yourself,
                  young man, and I think <emph>ever</emph> so much of you again."</p>
               <p>Marie and the old Chief now hurried up and shook Talbot warmly by the hand. The
                  latter, overjoyed to see his old associates again, leaped from his horse,
                  exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"But what a stupid I am. Let me make known to you my own father, Lord Talbot of
                  Westley Manor, Sussex, who has come all the way from England to see your wild
                  country and to make the acquaintance of those to whom both he and his son are so
                  much indebted."</p>
               <p>The old baron was hospitably welcomed by all and gracefully bowed his
                  acknowledgments. When he too had alighted, Talbot, meanwhile looking eagerly
                  around, anxiously enquired:</p>
               <p>"But, Jack! I don't see Wau-ki-na. We heard in the city she was with you. She's
                  well, I hope, and here, is she not?"</p>
               <p>"Lucy's here and well. One word with you aside, my lord."</p>
               <p>The two moved to the further end of the porch, Marie, meanwhile, bestowing every
                  attention on the old Englishman, when thus Jack very gravely:</p>
               <p>"Talbot, I believe it's my duty to tell you—"</p>
               <p>"Now, <emph>what!</emph> Jack?" hastily interrupted Talbot, his countenance
                  growing suddenly pale, and with his questioning eyes fixed on the scout's face.
                  "You don't mean to tell<pb n="450-451" xml:id="VAC7175-00000232"/> me that
                  Wau-ki-na has forgotten me, or that she, she—loves another! <emph>Don't</emph> say
                  that! Jack, please don't!" pleadingly.</p>
               <p>"No, not quite so bad as that, my lord," answered the Ranger, smilingly; "although
                  you well deserve that fate after so long silence and neglect. But now that you
                     <emph>are</emph> back, I ought to know upon what footing you renew your
                  acquaintance with Lucy."</p>
               <p>"Why, as her betrothed lover, of course! What do you take me for, Captain? I come
                  to wed her, if she still loves me as I do her."</p>
               <p>"And your father?" continued Jack.</p>
               <p>"Oh, the governor's all right; has given his free consent—so have they all at
                  home. Gad, they <emph>had</emph> to—I'd have 'cut' the whole connection, else. By
                  jove, I'd have—I'd have—disinherited and expatriated them. They're all anxious now
                  to see and welcome your sister. Now tell me, Jack, that's a good boy, where
                     <emph>is</emph> Wau-ki-na and does she love me yet?"</p>
               <p>"You'll have to ask <emph>her</emph> that, Talbot," laughed Jack. "You'll find her
                  sitting, I think, at the foot of yonder waterfall whose noise you hear in the
                  distance."</p>
               <p>"Where? where? By George, you don't say so!" and without staying to hear more, off
                  the impatient lover shot like an arrow.</p>

               <p>HE soon came in sight of the little cascade, and then his quick lover's eye
                  discovered Wau-ki-na, sitting pensively on a tree trunk at its foot. The book she
                  had in hand had fallen to her lap, and the lovely girl was dreamily watching the
                  bright waters as they leaped into the rocky basin at her feet. Their noise had
                  entirely prevented her hearing approaching footsteps.</p>
               <p>Talbot paused at a little distance to regard her, and study how he should make
                  himself known. Indeed, so altered and so greatly improved was her appearance, that
                  his heart leaped into his throat, and to stop its tumultuous throbbing, he leaned
                  for a moment against a smooth beech.</p>
               <p>He was fairly enraptured with the beautiful girl, who, it must be confessed, was,
                  with her distracted air and graceful négligé attitude, looking her very best.</p>
               <pb n="452-453" xml:id="VAC7175-00000233"/>
               <p>At last he managed to approach and murmur, "Wau-ki-na! Here I am, according to
                  troth."</p>
               <p>The frightened girl sprang to her feet with a sharp, quick cry, and gazed at him
                  with a startled, bewildered look; her face grew rosy red, and then pale; her eyes
                  closed, a shudder came over her frame, and she would have sunk to the ground, had
                  not Talbot sprang towards her and caught her in his arms, covering her face with
                  kisses, and at the same time exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"Why, Wau-ki-na, my own, 'tis I!—Talbot, your betrothed lover, who has come back
                  to claim you."</p>
               <p>Wau-ki-na speedily recovered, and with blushing cheeks and sparkling eyes, quickly
                  disengaged herself from her lover's arms, and drawing herself up haughtily, but
                  with downcast eyes, she said:</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, Lord Talbot, but I am constrained to say, that it was taking an unfair
                  advantage of a weak woman to come upon her in that abrupt way. One would think
                  that before presuming on the familiarity of an old acquaintance, you would have,
                  at least, first attempted to explain your long silence."</p>
               <p>It was Talbot's turn now to be astonished. His eyes widened and the puzzled look
                  and attitude of wonder which he assumed were almost ludicrous. At last he gave a
                  long whistle, and then said in a bewildered sort of way:</p>
               <p>"Bless me, Wau-ki-na! why you talk English as well as—yes, a plaguy sight better
                  than <emph>I</emph> do. Why! why! I'm fairly stunned at your looks and language!
                  And proud—I declare, you're as haughty as a countess, and a vast deal prettier
                  than any countess <emph>I</emph> ever saw. Why, you're no more Pipe's Indian
                  daughter than I'm Nymwha's Indian son. I see it! Hang me if I wont have to court
                  you all over again—that's plain!"</p>
               <p>This odd speech, taken with the young lord's ludicrous and puzzled attitude, and
                  his allusion to the old Indian names, completely broke down Wau-ki-na's haughty
                  reserve; her whole face changed on the instant; her bright eyes sparkled and
                  twinkled with the old merriment, and she gave out a ringing peel of rich laughter.
                  She positively could not help it. At last she said:</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, no matter how much <emph>I</emph> am changed, I see <emph>you</emph>
                  are the same odd character I always knew you. Where in the world did you come
                  from? and what are you doing here?"</p>
               <p>It was amusing to watch Talbot's shy, puzzled glances. He could not get over his
                  surprise, pleasing as it was. He left her a mere girl; he now found her a woman,
                  with many added charms. She used to speak in simple, broken English; she
                     <emph>now</emph> talked as correctly and as glibly as he did himself, with just
                  every now and then a peculiar accent and pronunciation, which only made her words
                  more attractive. Besides, he saw that her quick woman's wit was giving her the
                  advantage, as witnessed by her last questions, and for the first time in their
                  acquaintance he stood abashed before her. He was by no means so sure of his ground
                  as before.</p>
               <p>"Why, Wau-ki-na, what an absurd and ridiculous question! If <emph>you</emph> have
                  forgotten, <emph>I</emph> have not! I repeat, I come to claim <emph>you!</emph>
                  I've seen your brother, and my father now awaits you at the cabin."</p>
               <p>"Your father!" faltered out Wau-ki-na, all the maiden shyness and timidity
                  returning, as her imagination quickly conjured up a stern, haughty English
                  nobleman, looking at her with cold, critical eyes. "Good heavens! what shall we
                  do? Come! sit down by me, and explain all this mystery! Why have you never
                  written? 'Twas cruel and unfeeling of you to treat me so!"</p>
               <p>"Why, bless you, Wau-ki-na, I've been nearly 'round the world since I saw you! I
                     <emph>did</emph> write, too, twice; first,<pb n="454-455"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000234"/> as soon as the ship reached London, and again when
                  I sent the hounds over; and—"</p>
               <p>"Ah, it was <emph>you,</emph> then, to whom we are indebted for those magnificent
                  dogs? I always thought as much!" and her confidence in her lover was evidently
                  fast coming back.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I'd scarcely reached home before I wanted to let Jack know I was grateful to
                  him, and to all of you. The dogs, and a letter of instructions to a countryman in
                  Philadelphia how to forward them, came all right, I find; but the letter I wrote
                  you, and then the one to your brother, it seems never reached either. When I got
                  home, there was a terrible bother and hubbub, I assure you. They had somehow heard
                  that I had left the army and was taken captive, and had given me up for lost. But
                  when, afterwards, I related my adventures, and told them all about my acquaintance
                  with you, then my love for you and betrothal, it created a vastly bigger commotion
                  than my return. But I was firm, obstinate, and—"</p>
               <p>"Stay!" interrupted Wau-ki-na, with flushed face and haughty mien; "if your
                  parents think me not good enough or high enough born to mate with you, I release
                  you right here, and on the very instant, of all imprudent engagements!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Will</emph> you?" quickly put in Talbot; "but I'll not release
                     <emph>you,</emph> Miss Wau-ki-na Pipe! As the poet Milton, or Dryden, or some
                  other antique jingler says, 'you're mine till death doth us part!? It is Wau-ki-na
                  against the world! and so I told them. Why, what do you think, Kina? they had
                  actually arranged to match me with a prim, cold-blooded, oldest daughter of a
                  seedy Scotch nobleman—a certain Lady Ruthven—a woman whom I always detested, who
                  looked as if she had a glass eye, and who said <emph>aye, aye</emph> for
                     <emph>yes,</emph> and <emph>na, na</emph> for <emph>no,</emph> and
                     <emph>kye</emph> for <emph>cow,</emph> and so on. Do you think I'd marry a
                  woman whose thin lips were as cold and colorless as an oyster's, and not red and
                  pouty like yours, and who even couldn't talk good English?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> didn't talk <emph>very</emph> good English myself, sir, as
                     <emph>you</emph> knew me all along!" rippled out Wau-ki-na, who certainly just
                  then, with her melting eye, lip as red and ripe as a cherry, and plump,
                  well-rounded form, must have presented a strong contrast to her high-born
                  rival.</p>
               <p>"Ah, true! I forgot that!" said Talbot, greatly embarrassed, not so much at his
                  own blundering as at his being caught in it; "but—but—" brightening up as a happy
                  thought took him, "you speak <emph>very</emph> good English <emph>now!</emph> Why,
                  Kina, by jove! you talk like a book! and then you are an angel compared with that
                  vinegary and angular Scotch lassie!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, <emph>that</emph> makes your logic good," laughed the merry girl. "Go on,
                  young Mr. Nymwha!"</p>
               <p>"Nymwha's good, my rose bud! Wonder what's become of the absurd, bombastical old
                  gusher? Well, we talked you over and over at our house, until your name was as
                  familiar to the whole large household as it used to be in Shannopinstown. But I
                  was in dead earnest—I always told you I was—and finally Lady Grace and my father
                  came to the same sensible conclusion that Jack did—to let time heal the 'American
                     <emph>delusion,</emph>' as they called it—think of it, Kina, 'delusion'—and so
                  it was agreed that after spending a long time in foreign travel, and I not to
                  correspond with you, time would test both our affections; and so it did, and I
                  came back just as infatuated as ever, and so—and so—to make a long story short, my
                  father concluded to come over with me and save me from a rapid decline. You see,
                  my girl, that I'm but the shadow of my former self—merely 'an eagle's talon in the
                  waist'—but come! here's for another kiss of those tempting lips, and then let's go
                  and meet my governor."</p>
               <p>"Oh, indeed, sir, I cannot! What if he didn't like me?"</p>
               <p>"Now, just as if that were possible!"—looking saucily into her bright eyes.</p>
               <pb n="456-457" xml:id="VAC7175-00000235"/>
               <p>"But he's proud, and stern, and severe."</p>
               <p>"Am I so?—that is, when I haven't on my Shawnee rig and paint? Why, he's the best
                  and kindest father ever was and thinks that I—scapegrace as I am—am just a model
                  of a son. Na, na! nane o' your auld, dour, Lang Syne Scotch lassies for
                     <emph>me!</emph>" And so they lingered by the water side and chatted on for a
                  while longer, recalling the past, enjoying the present, and forecasting the
                  future.</p>
               <p>We would not, if we could, put down on cold paper the many little nothings that
                  passed on either side. They were, doubtless, very sweet and pleasant, but our
                  readers will have to imagine them. Experienced ones will have no difficulty in
                  doing so.</p>
               <p>One thing was plain: as they at last—hand-in-hand, like two happy children—slowly
                  sauntered towards the cabin, the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">entente
                     cordiale</foreign> was fully re-established between them. When Wau-ki-na at
                  first caught sight of the strange elderly gentleman on the porch, she faltered,
                  grew pale, and fairly trembled; but Talbot reassured her, and was so conspicuously
                  proud and happy, that she made her approach with grace and dignity. When the steps
                  were reached, Talbot took her hand and presented her to his father, saying:</p>
               <p>"Here, Father, is the young Indian girl you have heard so much about. I'm glad to
                  find her, after so long a separation, as true to me as I am to her, and I beg at
                  once to assure you, and all here, that having seen her and talked with her again,
                  I esteem and love her more than ever."</p>
               <p>This frank, open speech of Talbot, as if anxious to show his trust and pride and
                  affection in the lady of his choice, put the whole company at once at their ease.
                  The old baron—evidently agreeably surprised and delighted at Wau-ki-na's lady-like
                  appearance and manners—came forward, took the hand of the blushing girl in the
                  warmest and most gracious manner, bowed down and saluted her affectionately on the
                  cheek, and said some pleasant, fatherly words.</p>
               <p>A merry, happy time they had that evening; Talbot, Jr., taking a most lively
                  interest in the "little Captain Jack," as he called the heir of the cabin. He
                  thought it the strangest, funniest thing in the world for such a silent,
                  mysterious, old leather-stockings as Jack to have a real walking, talking baby in
                  his home. By this interest, the young Englishman rose rapidly in Marie's esteem.
                  She said that very night to her husband, after all had retired, that Talbot was an
                  odd stick, but, on the whole, a very sensible fellow, who took no airs on himself,
                  and she was sure he would make Lucy a most excellent and affectionate husband.</p>
               <p>For two weeks, the Englishmen, father and son, were Jack's guests. They were
                  immediately made completely at home, and showed such an earnest desire to know the
                  country, its customs, people, native sports, etc., that all who came in contact
                  with them were delighted. For days together they would—Jack, the old Chief, and
                  the two tireless hounds in the van—roam over the wild mountains, sequestered
                  valleys and noble forests of the Juniata, hunting the elk, deer and bear. Then
                  they would have night hunting and fishing, and again would mingle in the rude
                  back-woods sports of the Paxton Rangers, and once even rode with them as far as
                  Shamokin (now Sunbury) to repel a threatened foray of Indians.</p>
               <p>But pleasant times must all have an end, and the Talbots, delighted as they were
                  with this novel frontier life and their exciting hunting adventures, were obliged
                  to hurry back to England, and so the marriage between Wau-ki-na and Talbot took
                  place immediately in a very quiet way at Paxton, and in the humble log cabin of
                  the Rev. Colonel Elder, who officiated.</p>
               <p>We would like above all things to describe this marriage<pb n="458-459"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000236"/> riage, and to narrate the appearance and behavior
                  of the little couple, and record some of the lovers' quarrels and odd
                  conversations which occurred between them, but we must reluctantly draw our tale
                  to a close. The young Englishman seemed to become more hopelessly in love every
                  day. He was actually nearly daft, and the exuberance of his spirits threw him into
                  all kinds of strange pranks, merry tricks and funny conceits. He was a perpetual
                  astonishment to the whole circle, and when, after the ceremony was performed and
                  the grave parson Elder offered to kiss the blushing bride, Talbot offered his own
                  merry face instead and gave him a hearty buss and embrace, finishing up by some
                  wonderful dancing and magnificent gifts to all, he was voted a general favorite
                  and a regular magazine of oddity and merriment.</p>
               <p>Marie clung to Lucy for hours before parting time came. It seemed as if she could
                  not possibly let her go and to such a great distance, too, with thousands of miles
                  of water between them; but the horses dashed up to the minister's door with a sort
                  of lumbering, travelling chariot which had been procured from Lancaster, and amid
                  tears and kisses and hearty good-byes, Lucy was off on her road to
                  Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>The bridal party did not rest long in the city, but took passage in a sailing
                  ship, and in due course of time arrived in England, and proceeded as fast as post
                  horses could convey them to Westley Manor, in Sussex, the beautiful country seat
                  of the Talbots.</p>
               <p>Here they found the whole family most anxiously awaiting their coming. The young
                  Lady Talbot was received by all with due respect and attention. It was only,
                  however, after some little acquaintance with Lucy; with her beauty, modesty,
                  amiability and winning ways, that Lady Grace and her other relatives could not
                  avoid giving her their <emph>hearts.</emph> Lucy Percy was naturally such a
                  graceful ful and sensible little body that she soon filled with great ease and
                  credit the station among the surrounding gentry to which she had been called, and
                  young Talbot forced all to confess that, in going over to the far wilds of America
                  for his beautiful and charming wife, he had done just the most sensible thing of
                  his life.</p>
               <p>Jack and his wife lived very many happy years in their pleasant home on the
                  Juniata. The "olive plants" increased about their bountiful table, and 'Captain
                  Jack, the scout" found the greatest delight of his life in teaching his troop of
                  bold-spirited boys the wood-craft and sports which had occupied so many of his own
                  younger years. From their mother, they learned to love the woods for the sake of
                  the flowers, the ferns, the mosses, and other wonderful creations which taught
                  them to "look from nature up to nature's God;" from her, also, how to draw, paint,
                  and preserve the birds and animals they killed; while from the aged Half-King,
                  whose visits were longer and more frequent as advancing years required more rest,
                  they learned to trap, to fish, to take long rambles, and to endure patiently all
                  the trials of life.</p>

               <p>WE could not fittingly conclude without some brief mention of the subsequent
                  fortunes of the old French fort which gives our tale its name.</p>
               <p>Of course the disastrous battle of Braddock's Field settled for the time the
                  dominion of all the vast territory between the Allegheny and the Mississippi—but
                  more, it left naked and defenceless the whole western half of the provinces of
                  Pennsylvania and Virginia.</p>
               <p>We have already stated that the ignominious and totally unnecessary retreat of
                  Colonel Dunbar's reserve army, was far more deplorable and immediately calamitous
                  in its effects, than the defeat of Braddock's army itself. Had "Dunbar the Tardy,"
                  in compliance with the earnest petitions of the whole border and the Pennsylvania
                  Assembly, possessed the courage to make a firm stand even at Fort Cumberland, he
                  would have afforded a nucleus and rallying-point for both Pennsylvania and
                  Virginia provinces; but when, deaf to all urgent entreaty, and in direct
                  opposition tion to the dictates of the commonest prudence and manliness, he
                  destroyed his stores and ammunition and marched his demoralized and panic-stricken
                  mob back to Philadelphia, all was given up as lost.</p>
               <p>The whole back country was thereby left naked and unprotected, and its
                  inhabitants, finding themselves deserted, with no money or leaders or
                  organization, became also panic-stricken, and left houses and stock and growing
                  crops, and moved back to and even beyond the Susquehanna.</p>
               <p>Our provincial Quaker Assembly, instead of taking prompt, decisive and energetic
                  action at this eventful crisis, sat supine and lethargic under the petitions and
                  the tidings of flight and burnings and slaughters which poured into Philadelphia
                  from every direction. A miserable quarrel had sprung up between the Assembly and
                  the Lieutenant-Governor Morris and Penn's Council, about the raising of money and
                  troops, and it was only after a long season of most untimely inaction, and after a
                  vast amount of ruin, and slaughters and savage barbarities had been committed,
                  that any efficient measures were taken to drive back the marauding bands of
                  Delaware and Shawnee Indians, who had made the whole border a howling and desolate
                  waste.</p>
               <p>But to return to the fort itself. Its dead commandant Beaujeu was immediately
                  succeeded by Dumas—the officer whom readers will remember as having led the
                  French-Indian attack at Braddock's Field after the early fall of the gallant
                  Beaujeu. Some time in '57 M. de Lignery relieved Dumas in his command, and
                  reinforcements to the amount of four hundred men were furnished from Canada.</p>
               <p>It was some time before the remaining French and their Delaware and Shawnee allies
                  discovered the woful state of panic and demoralization which followed the great
                  battle; but when small, adventurous parties of scouts and robbers brought back
                  news how their mere presence even put whole communities to flight, and how houses,
                  crops, cattle, and<pb n="462-463" xml:id="VAC7175-00000238"/> the entire
                  settlements were deserted, both French and Indians entered upon their horrid work
                  with alacrity and with a keen relish for blood and slaughter.</p>
               <p>Many of the friendly Indians living along both sides of the Allegheny Mountains,
                  became at first discouraged, then defiant, and then hostile, joining with the
                  western bands to burn, murder and destroy, until the whole country from New York
                  down deep into Virginia became one vast theatre for the most wanton destruction
                  and inhuman barbarities.</p>
               <p>Our old friend Scarooyaddy made many ineffectual attempts to arouse our provincial
                  Assembly to a sense of the imminent danger. He pleaded, reasoned, scolded and
                  denounced in turn, but all in vain. He then visited the friendly Indians west to
                  secure their alliance and aid in beating back the bands which, under Shingiss,
                  Guyasutha, Killbuck, Blackhoof and other Indian chieftains of prowess and renown,
                  were devastating the border. This failed. He then visited the Six Nations in New
                  York to secure <emph>their</emph> assistance. Even these powerful
                     tribes—<emph>secretly,</emph> if not openly in league with the western hostile
                  bands—were found sullen and indifferent, and gave nothing but empty promises.</p>
               <p>The only redeeming feature in that whole period was the successful expedition
                  which Colonel John Armstrong made September '56, against Kittanning, at that time
                  occupied by Delaware Indians, headed by the brave but cruel Captain Jacobs, and
                  the point and direction from which most of the forays against the Susquehanna
                  border were made. The village was attacked in the night, a number of houses burned
                  and Indians killed, including Jacobs and some of his wives, and a great many white
                  captives set free.</p>
               <p>In fine, these were sad and humiliating days for England, both at home and abroad.
                  Everything British was at the very lowest ebb. There was nothing but defeat,
                  disgrace, and despair; and so, indeed, it continued until the great man after whom
                  Pittsburgh was named seized the helm of State. His nerve and decision and ability
                  soon put a new complexion on matters.</p>
               <p>Among his very first resolves was to make a second attempt to take Fort Duquesne,
                  and to recover to the English crown the vast domain given up to the French at
                  Braddock's Field; and to this end he ordered the immediate collection, in Eastern
                  Pennsylvania, of a large force, under a brave and skilful general.</p>
               <p>The army of the Scotch General John Forbes—the "iron-headed," as he was called—was
                  nearly six thousand strong, composed of about thirteen hundred Highlanders, and
                  the rest chiefly Virginia and Pennsylvania troops. At Raystown (now Bedford) he
                  halted, and sent forward Colonel Bouquet with two thousand men, to occupy the
                  Loyal Hanna.</p>
               <p>The detachment by Bouquet of eight hundred men under Major Grant; the advance, and
                  empty bravado of that officer under the very walls of Fort Duquesne; the
                  subsequent sally of the French and Indians from the fort, by which Grant's army
                  was flanked on both sides of the hill which now bears his name and situate right
                  in the centre of Pittsburg, and his force only saved from utter annihilation by a
                  stand made by the Provincial troops, are all well-known matters of history and we
                  need not dwell on them. It is sad, however, to be compelled to relate that De
                  Lignery was cowardly enough to deliver five of the prisoners taken at that rout to
                  be burned at the stake, and that the remainder were tomahawked in cold blood on
                  the <emph>parade ground of the fort.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The triumph at Grant's Hill almost brought the French to ruin, for, as after the
                  battle of Braddock's Field, so now, the lake Indians, believing the English army
                  completely defeated, deserted for their distant homes. A most timely visit, just
                  at this time, of the Moravian Missionary, C.<pb n="464-465"
                     xml:id="VAC7175-00000239"/> Frederick Post, to the Delaware and Shawnee chiefs
                  between Duquesne and Beaver, completed the demoralization of the French. These two
                  tribes were found very sick of the war and most anxious to return to their
                  allegiance, so that when Forbes' army—after innumerable difficulties and
                  disheartening delays—drew near, De Lignery, after firing the buildings, destroying
                  the stores, and all possible of the works, ended by blowing up the magazine, and
                  embarking in boats, some down the Ohio and others up the Allegheny. On the 24th of
                  November, 1758, Forbes' army had encamped at Turtle Creek, his provisions, forage,
                  etc., so nearly exhausted, that even from that advanced point, a retreat was
                  seriously advised by a council of war.</p>
               <p>The sick and emaciated but stout-hearted old General—who was carried on a litter
                  all the way from and back to Philadelphia, where he shortly after died—would not
                  hear of it, but swore he would sleep in the fort the next night. That very evening
                  a great smoke, in the direction of the fort, was reported, and at midnight the
                  whole camp was startled by the dull, heavy sound of some great explosion.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>It was the magazine of the old fort;</emph> and encouraged by these signs,
                  the army pressed on, the Provincials, in their fringed hunting-shirts, leading the
                  way; next came the Royal Americans, their drums beating a lively march, followed
                  by the old iron-headed General, his wasted form reclining in a litter; and last of
                  all came the Highlanders, in a long and picturesque line, in their kilts and
                  plaids—the "petticoat warriors," as the Indians called them.</p>
               <p>As they all approached the fort, they passed along a race-path, on either side of
                  which a horrid sight presented itself. A long row of naked stakes were planted, on
                  each of which was impaled the head of a Highlander, killed at Grant's defeat,
                  while beneath was suspended his kilt and accoutrements. Disgusted and provoked at
                  the scene, it is said the Americans quickened pace and hastened on; but not so the
                  Highlanders. One who was present thus relates the exciting scene that
                  followed:</p>
               <p>"The first intimation given by the Scots of their discovery of the insulted
                  remains of their butchered brothers was a subdued, threatening murmur, like the
                  angry buzzing of a swarm of bees. Rapidly swelling in violence, it increased to a
                  fierce, continuous, low shriek of rage and grief, that none who listened to would
                  willingly hear again. In this moment, officers as well as men seemed to have
                  abandoned every sentiment but of quick and bloody vengeance, and, inspired by a
                  common fury, cast all discipline to the winds. Their muskets were dashed upon the
                  ground, and, bursting from the ranks, the infuriated Gael, with brandished
                  claymore, rushed madly on with hope to find an enemy on whom to accomplish
                  retribution. Startled at the sound of swiftly tramping feet, the amazed Provincial
                  looked round to see the headlong torrent sweep by, burthening the air with
                  imprecations, and foaming 'like mad boars engaged in battle.'"</p>
               <p>Too late. The fort was in flames, and the last boat of the flying Frenchmen was
                  disappearing in the evening mist that hung around Smoky Island. In place of old
                  Fort Duquesne—the scene of so many exploits and the bone of contention for so long
                  a time between two great and powerful nations—there was now but a heap of smoking
                  ruins, the stacks of some thirty chimneys only remaining to mark where the houses
                  stood, and sixteen barrels of gunpowder and ball and a cart-load of scalping
                  knives—discovered in the only magazine which had refused to fire—were the only
                  spoils which remained to be gathered. But a small force was left, the main army
                  marching East soon after. A square stockade for two hundred men, under Colonel
                  Hugh Mercer, was built, which was succeeded the next year by the more imposing and
                  much more costly structure, Fort Pitt.</p>

                  <head>STRANGE DISCOVERY BY THE YOUNG SIR PETER HALKET OF THE SKELETONS OF HIS
                     FATHER AND BROTHER.</head>
                  <p>No sooner had General Forbes possession of the fort, or rather its site, than
                     Major Halket, the son of Sir Peter Halket, and successor to his title and
                     estates, resolved to visit the battle-ground of Braddock's Field with a company
                     of sharpshooters, under command of Captain West, brother of the great painter,
                     Sir Benjamin West. The young Sir Peter had piously accompanied the Highlanders
                     to America mainly to try and discover the remains of his father and brother,
                     whose sad and peculiar death, at Braddock's Field, we have already
                     described.</p>
                  <p>By interrogating some of the Indians who had fought with the French at that
                     massacre, he found one who said he had seen an officer, answering the Major's
                     description, fall near a remarkable tree, which he thought he could discover,
                     stating, moreover, that the incident was impressed on his memory by observing a
                     young subaltern, who, in running to the officer's assistance, was shot dead on
                     reaching the spot, and who fell across the other's body.</p>
                  <p>The Major had a mournful conviction on his mind that the two officers were his
                     father and brother, and the expedition, commanded by Captain West, and piloted
                     by the Indians, took up their melancholy march. From Gait's Life of Benjamin
                     West we give this brief account of this remarkable excursion.</p>
                  <p>"Captain West and his companions proceeded through the woods and along the
                     banks of the river, towards the scene of the battle. The Indians regarded the
                     expedition as a religious rite, and guided the troops with awe and in profound
                     silence. The soldiers were affected with sentiments not less serious, and as
                     they explored the bewildering labyrinths of those vast forests, their hearts
                     were often melted with inexpressible sorrow, for they frequently found
                     skeletons lying across the trunks of fallen trees—a mournful proof to their
                     imaginations, that the men who sat there had perished of hunger, in vainly
                     attempting to find their way to the plantations. Sometimes their feelings were
                     raised to the utmost pitch of horror by the sight of skulls and bones scattered
                     on the ground—a certain indication that the bodies had been devoured by wild
                     beasts; and in other places they saw the blackness of ashes amidst the
                     relics—the tremendous evidence of atrocious rites.</p>
                  <p>"At length they reached a turn of the river, not far from the principal scene
                     of destruction, and the Indian who remembered the death of the two officers
                     stopped; the detachment also halted. He then looked round in quest of some
                     object which might recall, distinctly, his recollection of the ground, and
                     suddenly darted into the woods. The soldiers rested their arms without
                     speaking. A shrill cry was soon after heard, and the other guides made signs
                     for the troops to follow them towards the spot from which it came.</p>
                  <p>"In a short time they reached the Indian warrior, who, by his cry, had
                     announced to his companions that he had found the place where he was posted on
                     the day of battle. As the troops approached, he pointed to the tree under which
                     the officers had fallen. Captain West halted his men around the spot, and with
                     Sir Peter Halket, and other officers, formed a circle, while the Indians
                     removed the leaves which thickly covered the ground. The skeletons were found,
                     as the Indians expected, lying across each other. The officers having looked at
                     them some time, the Major said, that as his father had an artificial tooth, he
                     thought he might be able to ascertain if they were indeed his bones and those
                     of his brother.</p>
                  <p>"The Indians were, therefore, ordered to remove the skeleton of the youth, and
                     to bring to view that of the old officer. This was done, and after a short

                     Halket exclaimed, 'It is my father,' and fell back into the arms of his
                     companions. The pioneers then dug a grave, and the bones being laid in it

                     existing relic, or rather suggestion of Fort Duquesne. It still stands, strong
                     and staunch, and the loopholes for musketry plainly visible, amid a crowd of
                     shabby, dingy houses near the river junction. It was built over the ruins of
                     the evacuated post by Col. Bouquet. The stone in the facade bears in rude
                     characters the inscription: <q>

                  <head type="sub">WASHINGTON'S THREE VISITS TO "THE FORKS."</head>
                  <p>The first account and description of the site on which a vast and prosperous
                     city is afterwards built, is always of interest. The very earliest visit on
                     record to the area at the junction of the Allegheny and the Monongahela, and
                     now forming what may be called Pittsburgh proper, was by no less a man than
                     Major Washington, who stopped there on the 24th of November, 1753, when on his
                     mission from Gov. Dinwiddie to the French forts at Venango and French Creek.
                     Arriving at Frazier's, near Turtle Creek, his baggage was carried down the
                     Monongahela in charge of his servants, while he and Captain Gist, his guide,
                     went down by land. His journal contains the following notice of the site where
                     now stands Pittsburgh, and where, at that time, no human being resided:</p>
                  <p>"As I got down before the canoe, I spent some time in viewing the rivers and
                     the land in the fork, which I think extremely well situated for a fort, as it
                     has the absolute command of both rivers. The land at the point is twenty-five
                     feet above the common surface of the water, and a considerable bottom of flat,
                     well-timbered land all around it, very convenient for building. The rivers are
                     each a quarter of a mile across, and run here very nearly at right angles,
                     Allegheny bearing north-east and Monongahela south-east. The former of these
                     two is a very rapid and swift-running water, the other deep and still, without
                     any perceptible fall.</p>
                  <p>"About two miles from this, on the south-east side of the river, at the place
                     where the Ohio Company intended to erect a fort, lives Shingiss, King of the
                     Delawares. We called upon him to invite him to a council at Logstown. As I had
                     taken a good deal of notice of the situation at the fork, my curiosity led me
                     to examine this more particularly, and I think it greatly inferior, either for
                     defence or advantages, especially the latter; for a fort at the fork would be
                     equally well situated on the Ohio, and have the entire command of the
                     Monongahela, which runs up our settlement, and is extremely well designed for
                     water carriage, as it is of a deep, still nature. Besides a fort at the fork
                     might be built at much less expense than at the other place."</p>
                  <p>Washington's second visit to the Forks, was in '58, five years later when
                     General Forbes occupied the smouldering ruins of old Fort<pb n="470-471"
                        xml:id="VAC7175-00000243"/> Duquesne. A small military work, for temporary
                     purposes, was commenced on the Monongahela, and two hundred men under command
                     of Colonel, afterwards General Hugh Mercer of Virginia, were left in charge.
                     The very next year was commenced an extensive and formidable five-sided
                     fortification to which the name of Fort Pitt was given, from which Pittsburgh
                     derives its name. It was built by General Stanwix and cost the British
                     Government sixty thousand pounds. It was abandoned in 1772 by order of General
                     Gage. The redoubt, which can be seen in Pittsburgh this day in a state of good
                     preservation, with the loopholes for musketry still visible, was the last relic
                     of British labor at the Forks, and until very lately had a stone in one front
                     on which was rudely carved "Colonel Bouquet, 1764." It has lately been removed
                     by order of the Pittsburgh Councils for better preservation.</p>
                  <p>In 1770 Washington paid his third visit to the Forks, on his way to the Kenhawa
                     in company with Dr. Craik, Captain Crawford and others to locate lands. He
                     writes thus in his journal; "We lodged in what is called the town, distant
                     about three hundred yards from the fort, at one Semple's, who keeps a very good
                     house of public entertainment. The houses, which are built of logs and ranged
                     in streets, are on the Monongahela, and I suppose may be about twenty in number
                     and inhabited by Indian traders. The fort (Pitt) is built in the point between
                     the Allegheny and Monongahela, but not so near the pitch of it as Fort Duquesne
                     stood. It is five-sided and regular, two of which near the land are of
                     brick—the others, stockade. A moat encompasses it."</p>
                  <p>This collection of log cabins belonging to Indian traders was the commencement
                     of the large and opulent city of Pittsburgh, now numbering with Allegheny city
                     and various suburbs nearly <emph>two hundred thousand souls.</emph> It remained
                     small and unimportant until after the advent of the large army despatched
                     thither in 1794 to quell what is generally known as "the whisky insurrection."
                     After the insurgents were scattered, the greater part of the troops were
                     withdrawn, but a body of twenty-five hundred men under Morgan remained encamped
                     in the district all winter. Among the soldiers who came west were many young
                     men who either remained there or afterwards found their way to a settlement,
                     and the growth of the city was thenceforward as steady and solid as it still
                     continues to be.</p>

                  <head type="sub">SKETCH OF CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER GIST.</head>
                  <p>Christopher Gist, whom we have brought in as one of the <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                        >dramatis personæ</foreign> story, was a very prominent character of his
                     time. His life, even for those days of stirring action and personal daring, was
                     unusually crowded with adventure. Hon. James Veech, formerly of Fayette county,
                     Pa., has gathered many details of him and his descendants. Gist was a native of
                     England, and first became known in North Carolina as a good surveyor and fine
                     judge of land; a bold and skilful woodsman, and an intrepid explorer; and hence
                     was selected by the Ohio Company to make the location of their enormous land
                     grant, and procure the Indian assent thereto. We have, in our notice of that
                     land association, stated that in 1750 he was out seven months on an excursion
                     to the then unknown, untrodden wilderness beyond the Allegheny Mountains. He
                     left Colonel Cresap's trading post, on the Potomac, crossed over to the
                     Juniata, swam the Allegheny at Shannopinstown, passed across to the Ohio
                     without seeing the Monongahela, followed the great Indian trail across Big
                     Beaver to the Muskingum, where he met Croghan treating with the Indians in
                     behalf of Pennsylvania. Thence west to the Scioto and Miami; thence down the
                     Ohio on the south side to near the Falls. Here he turned into Kentucky, being
                     the first explorer of that magnificent country—the very paradise of the hunter
                     and afterwards made so celebrated by the daring exploits and adventures of
                     Boone, Kenton, Harrod, and their successors.</p>
                  <p>Gist reached his home on the Yadkin in May, '51, and found his cabin in ashes
                     and his family scattered by the Indians. In the same year he made another
                     shorter but more important excursion, and was the master spirit of the
                     negotiations with the Ohio Indians. In the winter of '53 he acted as
                     Washington's guide from Wills Creek to the French post on French Creek, Pa.,
                     then called <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Riviere au Bœufs,</foreign> on account of
                     the large herds of buffalo frequenting its margins. He was again with
                     Washington in his Fort Necessity campaign, of '54, and was chosen by Braddock
                     as chief guide to his expedition.</p>
                  <p>Braddock's defeat seems to have ended his agency for the Ohio Company, and for
                     some years he found ample employment in defending the Virginia borders from
                     Indian forays. In '55 he was at the head of a company of scouts. In '56 he was
                     sent southward; was successful in enlisting the Cherokees into the English
                     service, and was appointed Indian agent for the South—a service for which,
                     wrote Washington, "I know of no person so well qualified. He has had extensive
                     dealings with the Indians; is in great esteem among them; well acquainted with
                     their manners and customs; indefatigable and patient, and as to his honesty,
                     capacity and zeal, I dare venture to engage."</p>
                  <p>What was called "Gist's Plantation" was situate on the Mount Braddock lands, in
                     Fayette county, near Uniontown, and within a short distance of Dunbar's camp
                     and the scene of Washington's fight with Jumonville. He had induced a number of
                     Scotch-Irish families to join him there, among others Cromwell, his son-in-law,
                     and the Stewart family, which gave the name to "Stewart's Crossings," where
                     Connellsville now stands. Gist lived at this settlement but a short time, and
                     only to seat his family, returning to his business in the South to die, but
                     exactly where is unknown.</p>
                  <p>Gist had three sons, Nathaniel, Thomas and Richard, and two daughters, Violet
                     and Anne. Nathaniel did good service in Braddock's campaign, and was the
                     Colonel Gist of the Virginia line in the Revolution, removing to and dying in
                     Kentucky. Richard lived in Fayette county till 1771, sold out his interest to
                     Thomas, and was killed in one of the Revolutionary battles. Thomas became a man
                     of local note, was Justice for Bedford, and afterwards for Westmoreland
                     counties, and presided in the courts of that county.</p>

                  <p>It is a very singular fact, that <emph>until very late years</emph> it was not
                     known <emph>who</emph> was in command of Fort Duquesne at the time of General
                     Braddock's defeat. Not only do the English, American, and even French
                     historians speak of Captain Contreecœur as the then commandant, and of Captain
                     Beaujeu—who led the French-Indian force to the battle, where he was killed
                     almost at the first fire—as second in command;<pb n="472-473"
                        xml:id="VAC7175-00000244"/> but even our own local historians, Neville B.
                     Craig and Winthrop Sargent, the latter of whom, under the auspices of the
                     Pennsylvania Historical Society, published, so late as 1856, a very full and
                     exhaustive monograph on "Braddock's expedition against Fort Duquesne." Sargent
                     even goes so far as to assert, that as Braddock drew near, Contrecœur had
                     almost decided to abandon his position without striking a blow; if not that, he
                     was certainly prepared to surrender on terms of honorable capitulation, and as
                     late as the 7th had announced no definite conclusion.</p>
                  <p>"On the 8th," Sargent writes, "de Beaujeu, a captain of the regulars, proposed
                     to the commander that he might go forth with a suitable band to prepare an
                     ambuscade for the English on the banks of the Monongahela, and to dispute with
                     them the passage of the second ford. If we may believe tradition, it was with
                     undisguised reluctance that Contrecœur complied with this request, and even
                     then, it is said, refused to assign troops for the enterprise, bidding him call
                     for volunteers as for a forlorn hope. To that summons the whole garrison
                     responded," etc.</p>
                  <p>Sargent goes on to say that for his conduct at the battle of Braddock's Field,
                     Captain Dumas—Beaujeu having been killed at the battle—was early in the
                     subsequent year promoted to succeed Contrecœur, and proceeds to mention a
                     romantic story to the effect, in which, however, he does not put implicit
                     faith, that jealousy of Dumas' success induced Contrecœur to persecute him,
                     sending him home on a charge of purloining the public stores; that he was tried
                     and cashiered, and retired to Provence in disgrace; and that during the
                     Revolutionary War Washington informed Lafayette of these circumstances, whose
                     influence speedily brought Dumas in triumph to receive the grade of a general
                     officer.</p>
                  <p>Now this is all wrong. Contrecœur was <emph>not the commandant of Fort Duquesne
                        at the time of the battle, but Lionel de Beaujeu.</emph> This admits of no
                     doubt whatever, and the discovery of the truth only at this late day affords
                     another evidence of the uncertainty of history.</p>
                  <p>Our attention was first called to the error by Judge James Veech, of the
                     Pittsburgh bar, and a gentleman of scholarly attainments and remarkably well
                     posted in all matters pertaining to the early history of western Pennsylvania.
                     His assertion was confirmed by a late visit to the rooms of the Pennsylvania
                     Historical Society, in Philadelphia, where almost the first book put into our
                     hands by the Librarian was a small and rare French work, presented to the
                     Society by Bishop O'Connor, and unearthed some years since at Quebec or
                     Montreal. It is the official register kept by Denis Baron, a Franciscan Friar
                     and Chaplain at Fort Duquesne in 1754, containing a brief record of the
                     marriages, baptisms, and deaths at the fort during '54 and '55. These are
                     countersigned so late as March by Contrecœur, who was then commandant. We find
                     the following important entry on the 12th of July:</p>

                  <p>In further pursuance of this subject, we found that the French lost two other
                     officers that day, Lieuteuant de Carqueville and Ensign de la Perade, and had
                     several wounded. The whole killed amounted to thirty, three-quarters of whom
                     were Indians. We found, also, that Neville B. Craig, Esq., a very reliable and
                     pains-taking historian, in the Pittsburgh Gazette of July 5th, 1858, had first
                     published a translation of this register with certain interesting notes. A
                     journal of Mr. Godefrey, an officer of the fort, and an account in the French
                     War Department, all concur in calling de Beaujeu commandant of the fort and the
                     forces there. An article in the "New York Historical Magazine" of September,
                     1863. exposes the historical error which has so long obtained, but itself falls
                     into the error of calling Contrecœur <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >Contrecœur.</foreign> At the Pennsylvania Historical Society we also came
                     across a memoir of Beaujeu, by which we find he was born at Montreal, 1711; had
                     won the cross of a Knight of St. Louis, and for a time commanded at Fort
                     Niagara.</p>

                  <head type="sub">WASHINGTON'S MISSION TO THE FRENCH.</head>
                  <p>A very memorable event before the outbreak of Braddock's war, was the visit of
                     Major Washington—then only in his twenty-first year—to the French commandant at
                     Venango, on the Allegheny. Both English and French laid claim to the
                     magnificent domain west of the Allegheny Mountains—the former by right of
                     purchase from the Six Nations, who themselves claimed by right of conquest, and
                     the latter by right of discovery, asserting that toy law and custom La Suite's
                     discovery of the Mississippi gave dominion over all the vast country watered by
                     it and its tributaries. The French had been exercising sovereignty for several
                     years, capturing or turning back English traders, and building a line of forts
                     to circumscribe the English settlements. The British colonies became jealous
                     and indignant, and Governor Dinwiddie sent young Washington to find out the
                     French intentions and ascertain the temper of the Indians in that region.</p>
                  <p>No better man could have been selected for the lonely and perilous journey. The
                     very same day he received his orders, with the commission of Major; he started,
                     hiring four Indian traders to accompany and Captain Gist to pilot him.
                     Frazier's house, hard by which was afterwards fought Braddock's battle, was
                     reached November 22d, '53. His first impressions of the junction where
                     Pittsburgh now stands, we give elsewhere. He had early interview with the
                     Half-King, Tannacharison, the predecessor of Scarooyaddy in that office, and a
                     wise and powerful Seneca Sachem; with Shingiss, king of the Delawares; with
                     Scarooyaddy and other noted chiefs. He found them earnestly opposed to French
                     encroachments, and a party of Indian guides, with the Half-King at their head,
                     agreed to accompany the English to the first French fort, which was at the
                     mouth of Rivière au Bœufs, now called French Creek.</p>
                  <p>This was reached December 4th. They found the French colors hoisted on the
                     house whence John Frazier, gunsmith, the Indian trader and lieutenant of our
                     story, had been driven, and had an interview with the famed Captain Joncaire, a
                     shrewd, politic and artful French agent among the Indians, over whom he had
                     great influence, Breaking all their tongues. Liquor soon flowed freely, and
                     Joncaire boasted that in spring they would take possession of the whole Ohio<pb
                        n="474-475" xml:id="VAC7175-00000245"/> country, and tried all he could to
                     make drunk and mislead the Indian chiefs with Washington. Tannacharison
                     remained firm, however, warning the French off the soil with a speech-belt.
                     Joncaire refused to receive it, but directed the Major to his superior, at the
                     fort above, Sieur Legardeur de St. Pierre, a Knight of the order of St. Louis.
                     This fort, located where Waterford, Pa., now stands, was reached on December
                     11th, the Major and his letter being received courteously by the one-eyed
                     commander. Washington used his eyes busily, jotting down the minutest
                     particular, and finding in fifty birch and one hundred and seventy pine canoes
                     a startling confirmation of Joncaire's boast that a fort was to be built at the
                     forks of the Ohio, as soon as spring opened. The French Commander openly
                     claimed all the territory even as far east as the Susquehanna, and said they
                     intended taking immediate possession.</p>
                  <p>With this important news, Washington hastened off by canoe, reaching Joncaire
                     again on the 22d December.</p>
                  <p>Here the horses were found so weak and the baggage so heavy, that they were
                     given up, and after going with them three days, Washington and Gist, guns in
                     hand and packs on back, started through the woods on foot, piloted by a bad and
                     treacherous Indian guide. The very next day a party of French Indians lay in
                     wait for them, and one of them, writes Washington, in his journal, "fired at
                     Mr. Gist or me, not fifteen steps off, but fortunately missed. We took this
                     fellow into custody, and kept him until about nine o'clock at night, then let
                     him go, and walked all the remaining <emph>part</emph> of the night without
                     making any stop. The next day we continued travelling until quite dark, and got
                     to the Allegheny about two miles from Shannopins. We expected to have found the
                     river frozen, but it was not, only about fifty yards from each shore. The ice,
                     I suppose, had broken up above, for it was driving in vast quantities."</p>
                  <p>"There was no way forgetting over," continues the Major's journal, "but on a
                     raft, which we set about with but one poor hatchet, and finished just after
                     sunsetting. This was a <emph>whole day's work!</emph> We next got it launched,
                     then went on board of it and set off, but before we were half way over, we were
                     jammed in the ice in such a manner that we expected every moment our raft to
                     sink, and ourselves to perish. I put out my setting pole to try and stop the
                     raft that the ice might pass by, when the rapidity of the stream threw it with
                     so much violence against the pole, that it jerked me out into ten feet of
                     water; but I fortunately saved myself by catching hold of one of the raft
                     logs."</p>
                  <p>"Notwithstanding all our efforts, we could not get to either shore, but were
                     obliged, as we were near an island, to quit our raft and make to it. The cold
                     was so extremely severe that Mr. Gist had all his fingers and some of his toes
                     frozen; and the water was shut up so hard that we found no difficulty in
                     getting off the island on the ice in the morning, and went to Mr. Frazier's. As
                     we intended to take horses here, and it required some time to find them, I went
                     up about three miles to the mouth of the Youghiogheny to visit Queen Alaquippa,
                     who had expressed great concern that we passed her in going to the fort. I made
                     her a present of a match-coat and a bottle of rum, which latter was thought
                     much the better present of the two."</p>
                  <p>This island was Wainwright's Island, now almost completely destroyed, but which
                     lay near Herr's, and is about three miles above the Ohio forks. The former
                     island lay near the eastern bank, and that branch of the river might well
                     freeze over in a night, but the wide channel between Herr's Island and
                     Shannopins could scarcely so easily freeze over. Now, Gist also kept a journal
                     on this memorable expedition. His account of the attempt by the Indian guide at
                     murder is so very creditable to Washington's kind and humane heart, that we
                     will quote the passage at length:</p>
                  <p>"We rose early in the morning, and set out about two o'clock, and got to
                     Murderingtown, on the southeast fork of Beaver Creek. Here we met an Indian
                     whom I thought I had seen at Joncaire's. This fellow called me by my Indian
                     name and pretended to be glad to see me. I thought very ill of the fellow, but
                     did not care to let the Major know I mistrusted him. But he soon mistrusted him
                     as much as I did. The Indian said he could hear a gun from his cabin, and
                     steered us more northwardly. We grew uneasy, and then he said two whoops might
                     be heard from his cabin. We went two miles further. Then the Major said he
                     would stay at the next water, and we desired the Indian to stop at the next
                     water. We came to water; we came to a clear meadow. It was very light, and snow
                     was on the ground.</p>
                  <p>"The Indian made a stop, and turned about. The Major saw him point his gun
                     towards us and he fired. Said the Major, 'Are you shot?' 'No!' said I; upon
                     which the Indian ran forward to a big standing white oak, and began loading his
                     gun, but we were soon with him. <emph>I would have killed him, but the Major
                        would not suffer me.</emph> We let him charge his gun; we found he put in
                     ball; then we took care of him; either the Major or I always stood by the guns.
                     We made him make a fire for us by a little run? as if we intended to sleep
                     there. I said to the Major: 'As you will not have him killed, we must get him
                     away, and then we must travel all night;' upon which I said to "the Indian: 'I
                     suppose you were lost, and fired your gun.' He said he knew the way to his
                     cabin, and it was but a little way. 'Well,' said I, 'do you go home, and as we
                     are tired, we will follow your track in the morning; and here is a cake of
                     bread for you, and you must give us meal for it in the morning.' He was glad to
                     get away. I followed him and listened until he was fairly out of the way, and
                     then we went about half a mile, when we made a fire, set our compass, fixed our
                     course, and travelled all night. In the morning we were at the head of Piny
                     Creek."</p>
                  <p>All doubt as to French claims and intentions were removed by Washington's
                     important visit. In order to arouse the colonies and England, Governor
                     Dinwiddie had the Major's journal published far and wide, and reprinted in
                     England, which led to very important and immediate action, since it was the
                     first positive intelligence of the views and designs of the French. Instant
                     steps were taken by Dinwiddie to send troops to the Ohio forks, which were at
                     that time supposed by him to belong to his province. One company, under command
                     of Captain Trent, was soon ready, and early in April Ensign Ward reached the
                     forks, and commenced work on a rude fortification. They had made but little
                     progress, however, before a French-Indian force of a thousand men, with
                     eighteen cannon, suddenly made their appearance on the Allegheny, in sixty
                     batteaux and three hundred canoes, and an immediate summons to surrender their
                     works was made on Ward by Contrecœur. Tamacharison, the Half-King, who was
                     present with Ward, in order to gain time, shrewdly urged him to reply that he
                     had no authority to surrender but would send for orders. To this, of course,
                     the French leader would not listen, but gave just one hour to retire, which
                     poor Ward was compelled to do. The French then landed and built there a fort,
                     first giving it the name of "The Assumption of the Holy Virgin," afterwards
                     changing it to Fort Duquesne, in honor of the Marquis Duquesne<pb n="476-477"
                        xml:id="VAC7175-00000246"/> quesne, the then French Governor of Canada; and
                     this little affair has always been considered as the commencement of that long
                     and memorable "seven years' war," only terminated by the treaty of Paris, and
                     by which France ceded to England all Canada, and the whole territory east of
                     the Mississippi except the isle of Orleans.</p>

                  <head type="sub">CAPTAIN JACK, THE "WILD HUNTER OF THE JUNIATA."</head>
                  <p>Captain Jack, of the French-Indian war, was a real, historic personage, and the
                     novel of "Old Fort Duquesne" was all composed and in print before its writer
                     ever heard of his Modoc namesake. Although there is much of legend and mastery
                     connected about the Juniata-valley Jack, this much is certain, that there was a
                     notable hunter and "Indian-killer," known all along the Pennsylvania border,
                     from the upper Susquehanna down to the Potomac by that name. In Hazard's
                     Register there is frequent mention of him. Colonel Armstrong calls him—on
                     account of his swarthy visage—"The Half-Indian" in his reports of his
                     expedition against Captain Jacobs of the Delaware village of Kittanning.</p>
                  <p>Colonel George Croghan, who, while Braddock was preparing for his march, was
                     engaged in beating up a number of Indians, scouts, etc., to serve as guides,
                     distinctly states that Captain Jack was at the head of a body of bold
                     hunter-rangers, skilled in woodcraft, expert in Indian fighting, clad, like
                     their leader, in Indian attire, and offered them to Braddock, provided they
                     were allowed to dress, march and fight as they pleased, and not to be subject
                     to the strict regulations of a soldier's camp. "They are well armed," said
                     Croghan, "and are equally regardless of heat or cold. They require no shelter
                     for the night, <emph>and ask no pay!</emph>" This, of course, could not be
                     permitted by such a strict and self-reliant martinet as Braddock, and the
                     Rangers were suffered to depart. It is idle now to speculate what might have
                     been the result of the British Expedition had these scouts, and a larger body
                     of fighting Indians been allowed to accompany, or rather precede Braddock's
                     army. Judging, however, from the late invaluable services of the Sweet-water
                     Indians in tracking the Modocs to their lairs, beating up their fastnesses in
                     the lava-beds, and bringing them to bay in such manner that nothing was left
                     but surrender, it is certainly safe to assume that these Pennsylvania Rangers
                     and Indians would have performed the same offices for Braddock, and rendered
                     wholly impossible the disastrous defeat which we have taken such pains to
                     describe.</p>
                  <p>Captain Jack's early history is shrouded in mystery, but it is the current
                     tradition in middle Pennsylvania, that he was a frontier settler, and that
                     returning one evening from a long day's chase, he found his cabin a heap of
                     smouldering ruins, and the blackened corpses of his murdered family scattered
                     around. From that time he became a rancorous Indian hater and slayer. In '53 he
                     held a sort of roving commission from Governor Hamilton—his home being in the
                     Juniata valley—going under the names of "The Black Rifle," "The Black Hunter,"
                     and "The Wild Hunter of the Juniata." It is thought by some that "Jack's
                     Mountain." in Pennsylvania, was called after him; but this, we think, is a
                     mistake; it, as well as "Jack's Narrows," having taken their names from the
                     fact—which caused a great deal of excitement at the time—of the atrocious
                     murder, in 1744, of a noted Indian trader named John Armstrong, together with
                     his two servants, Smith and Woodward, by a Delaware Chief called
                     Musemeelin.</p>
                  <p>In Jones' "Juniata Valley," we find a lengthy account of Captain Jack. He makes
                     him a hunter living on the Juniata, near a beautiful spring; having a mystery
                     about him which no one ever succeeded in fathoming. He is described by Jones as
                     a man of Herculean proportions, with an extremely swarthy complexion, and a
                     relentless Indian tracker and killer. The settlers about Aughwick (now
                     Shirleysburg, Huntingdon county, Pa.), as well as those in Path Valley and
                     along the Juniata, "frequently found dead savages, some in a state of partial
                     decay, and others with their flesh stripped by the bald eagles, on the spot
                     where Jack's rifle had laid them low." "On one occasion," writes Jones,
                     "Captain Jack had concealed himself in the woods by the side of the 'Aughwick
                     Path,' where he lay in wait for a stray Indian. Presently a painted warrior,
                     with a red feather waving from his head, and his body bedizened with gew-gaws
                     recently purchased from a trader, came down the 'path.' A crack from Captain
                     Jack's rifle, and the savage bounded into the air and fell dead without a
                     groan. <emph>It</emph> appears that three others were in company—but had
                     tarried at a spring—who, on hearing the discharge of the rifle, under the
                     impression that their companion had shot a bear, gave a loud 'whoop.' Captain
                     Jack immediately loaded, and when the Indians came up to the dead body, Jack
                     again shot, and killed a second one. The Indians then rushed into the thicket,
                     and one of them getting a glimpse of Jack, shot at him, but missed. The 'Wild
                     Hunter,' seeing that the chances were desperate, jumped out and engaged in a
                     hand-to-hand encounter—the fourth savage being only armed with a tomahawk. He
                     soon despatched the third one by beating his brains out with a rifle; but the
                     fourth one, an athletic fellow, grappled, and a long and bloody fight with
                     knives followed, and only ceased when both were exhausted by loss of blood. The
                     Indian managed to get away, and left the 'Black Hunter' the victor of the
                     field. Weak and faint as Jack was, he scalped the three savages, and managed to
                     work his way to the settlement, where his wounds—consisting of eight or ten
                     stabs—were dressed."</p>
                  <p>"It is said," continues Jones, "that one night the family of an Irishman named
                     Moore, residing in Aughwick, was suddenly awakened by the report of a gun. On
                     opening the door, they found a dead Indian lying upon the very threshold. By
                     the feeble light which shone through the door, they discovered the dim outline
                     of the 'Wild Hunter,' who merely said: 'I have saved your lives,' and then
                     plunged into the dark ravine and disappeared. With an eye like the eagle, an
                     aim that was unerring, daring intrepidity, and a constitution that could brave
                     the heat of summer as well as the frosts of winter, he roamed the valley like
                     an uncaged tiger, the most formidable foe that ever crossed the redman's path.
                     Of the final end of Captain Jack," concludes Jones, "we have nothing definite.
                     One account says he went west, another that he went west, another that he died
                     in 1772. It is said that his bones rest near the spring at the base of the
                     mountain bearing his name, and this we are inclined to credit. The early
                     settlers of the neighborhood believed that Captain Jack came down from the
                     mountain every night at twelve o'clock to slake his thirst at his favorite
                     spring; and half a century ago we might readily have produced the affidavits of
                     twenty respectable men who had seen the 'Black Hunter' in the spirit, roaming
                     over the land that was his in the flesh. The towering mountain, a hundred miles
                     in length, bearing his name, will stand as an indestructible monument to his
                     memory."</p>

                  <p>Thus far Jones. It is not singular we should seize on such excellent material
                     for romance, and make of Jack, who lived in so many a fireside legend, a
                     leading character in our fiction; and in venturing to unravel for our readers
                     the mystery of his early life, and to give a reason for his hatred to Indians,
                     we only take the privilege universally allowed to all writers of romance.</p>

                  <head type="sub">SCAROOYADDY, THE HALF-KING.</head>
                  <p>In the Colonial Records and Archives of Pennsylvania, from the year '53, and
                     during the whole French-Indian war which followed, the name of no Indian Sachem
                     has more frequent or honorable mention than Scarooyaddy, or Monecatootha, or
                     Skirooniatta; for by all these names was he called. He was an Oneida Sachem,
                     belonging, of course, to the Iroquois or Six Nations, and lived at a time when
                     the native red men of this continent appeared at their best; were considered
                     the lords of the soil; were brave, proud, dignified, and faithful to their
                     simple habits and traditions. By degrees, and after many bloody battles, the
                     Indians were conquered, pushed back from place to place, debauched and
                     contaminated by the society of traders and unprincipled borderers, and finally
                     degraded into a state of vassalage; abused and maltreated; all their pride and
                     dignity gone, and degenerated into such poor creatures as we now find on the
                     western plains and in the neighborhood of the settlements.</p>
                  <p>We first hear of Monecatootha as the companion of Washington on his visit to
                     the French forts on the upper Allegheny. The noble old Tannacharison was then
                     the Half-King, which means that he represented the Six Nations among the
                     western tribes who were subject to them. A letter from John Harris, dated
                     October, '54, gives an account of the death of Tannacharison at Harris' Ferry
                     (now Harrisburg). Sent by his people to Onondago, the council place of the Six
                     Nations, to ascertain their views on the expected troubles with the French,
                     Scarooyaddy was there selected to succeed as Half-King. He was publicly
                     thanked, and his services all through the Braddock campaign were fully
                     acknowledged in Pennsylvania. "You fought under General Braddock," said
                     Governor Morris, "and behaved with spirit and valor during the engagement. We
                     see you consider yourselves as our flesh and blood, and fight for us as if we
                     were of your own kindred." He was always not only loyal to the British, but
                     ever active in their interests; advising them how and when to attack the
                     French; sternly rebuking the Pennsylvania Assembly for their lethargy and
                     inactivity, and not hesitating to express his contempt for what he deemed their
                     untimely cowardice in allowing their back settlements to be so scourged, and
                     they doing nothing to protect them. For instance, in a public and manly speech
                     made before the Pennsylvania Assembly and a large concourse of citizens in
                     Philadelphia, we find him using such expressions as these:</p>
                  <p>"We are amazed to find you still sitting with your hands between your knees,
                     and for an apology for so unbecoming a posture, you tell us," etc. And again:
                     "Awake! Shake off your lethargy! Stand up with your hatchet in your hand, and
                     use it manfully! Show your enemies you are men! Your people are foolish. They
                     are extremely heavy, move slow, and are liable to surprises," etc., etc.</p>
                  <p>In '55 Scarooyaddy headed a war party from Shamokin against the French, and
                     made repeated visits of importance to the Six Nations, as well as to the
                     western tribes. In the "Gentleman's Magazine" of September, '56, is a
                     fac-simile of his memoirs, by which it appears he had fought in thirty one
                     combats, had slain many, and taken numerous prisoners with his own hands. On
                     his breast was tattooed the figure of a tomahawk, and on each cheek that of a
                     bow and arrow. We have narrated how unluckily his son was killed during
                     Braddock's march, for which fatality, and in order somewhat to appease and
                     gratify him, one of the night encampments was called "Monecatootha." He had a
                     large family of children, and was, take him altogether, a brave, noble old
                     Chief of "the olden time."</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE ONLY SCOUT EVER SENT OUT BY BRADDOCK.</head>
                  <p>Robert Orme, Braddock's aide-de-camp and Washington's friend, was a lieutenant
                     in the "Cold Streams," and was an honest and capable man, making a most
                     favorable impression on all colonial dignitaries with whom he was thrown in
                     contact. He was wounded at Braddock's Field, returned to England and went into
                     private life, having married Lady Townsend, and this, much to the displeasure
                     of her family, who had destined her for Lord George Lenox. Orme kept a very
                     careful diary, and it is to it that history is indebted for much information of
                     Braddock's expedition. Under date of July 4th, only four days before the
                     battle, he jots down:</p>
                  <p>"We marched about six miles to Thicketty Run. From this place two of our
                     Indians were prevailed upon to go for intelligence towards the French fort, and
                     also (unknown to them) Gist, the General's guide. The Indians returned OIL the
                     6th, and brought in a French officer's scalp, who was shooting within half a
                     mile of the fort. They informed the General that they saw very few men there or
                     tracks; many additional works; that no pass was possessed between us and the
                     fort, and that they saw some boats under the fort, and one with a white flag
                     coming down the Ohio" (Allegheny?). "Gist returned a little after, the same
                     day, whose account corresponded with theirs, except he saw smoke in a valley.
                     He had concealed himself with intent of getting close under the fort, but was
                     discovered and pursued by two Indians, who had very near taken him."</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE LENNI-LENAPE, OR DELAWARE INDIANS.</head>
                  <p>A great interest has always been felt in this gallant little tribe of Indians,
                     partly because of their peculiar history, and partly because Cooper has so
                     dwelt upon their varied fortunes, their trials and struggles, selecting from
                     them the heroes of his fascinating romances. They were formerly called
                     Woapanachki, which means <hi rend="i"/>people from the East. They themselves
                     have ever proudly claimed to be the <hi rend="i"/>Lenni-Lenape, or "original
                     people;" and when the whites first came to this country, these Indians, divided
                     into three tribes—Miamies, Munzies and Unalacticos—lived between the Hudson and
                     Susquehanna rivers, on both sides the river Delaware.</p>
                  <p>The Confederacy, or League known as the Five, and afterwards—when the
                     Tuscaroras were taken in—as the Six Nations, is well known<pb n="480-481"
                        xml:id="VAC7175-00000248"/> as the most wonderful and the most powerful
                     combination of Indian tribes ever known on this continent. Called <hi rend="i"
                     />Iroquois by the French, <hi rend="i"/>Magua by the Dutch, <hi rend="i"
                     />Mingoes by the English, and <hi rend="i"/>Menywe by the other Indian nations,
                     they became the <hi rend="i"/>Romans of America, and went on from conquest to
                     conquest until all the Indians between their settlements about the lakes of
                     Central New York and the far Mississippi became subject to them. They found
                     strength in union; and being governed by old and wise Sachems, and having been
                     trained to war and all the warlike virtues, they brought into the field such a
                     number of brave, skilled and adventurous warriors, that nothing could stand
                     before them.</p>
                  <p>To manage their common concerns, they had a council somewhat like the old
                     Wittenagemot of the Saxons, composed of the very wisest Sachems of the six
                     different tribes, who met annually at Onondago. Of these Six Nations—the
                     Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagos, Cayugas, Tuscaroras and Senecas—the latter were
                     the most westernly located, living about the headwaters of the Allegheny river,
                     where their descendants engage in rafting to the present day. To this nation
                     belonged the Half-King, Tannacharison, Guyasutha and Cornplanter. The Delawares
                     used to be the inveterate foes of the Iroquois, but were finally conquered by
                     them about 1617, and as the Iroquois boasted, were forced to put on
                     petticoats—that is, were degraded from the rank of <emph>braves</emph> to that
                     of <emph>women.</emph> The Delawares admit the fact, but assert that the
                     Iroquois acted treacherously, and used a crafty artifice by persuading them to
                     act as mediators during some of their wars. Now, the peacemediators among
                     Indians were always women, and hence the appellation they received from their
                     conquerors. The Iroquois treated them with great harshness and haughtiness, and
                     compelled them to make move after move, finally forcing them back to the
                     country around the headwaters of the Ohio river, where our story finds them
                     calling themselves <emph>men</emph> again; very resentful against their
                     insulting masters, the Six Nations, and anxious to throw off their yoke. They
                     and the Shawnees generally lived in harmony, and acted as allies in the many
                     struggles which ensued before Ohio became thoroughly under the possession of
                     the whites.</p>

                  <head type="sub">AN ACCOUNT OF "THE OHIO COMPANY."</head>
                  <p>The pioneer explorations made in the West by the English were conducted under
                     the auspices of what was called <hi rend="i"/>The Ohio Company, an association
                     of twelve gentlemen, formed in 1748 by Thomas Lee, of Virginia, and a London
                     merchant by the name of Hanbury, and of which Laurence and Augustus, older
                     brothers of George Washington, were active members. The object of the Company
                     was to carry on the Indian trade on a large scale, and settle the lands west of
                     the Allegheny Mountains.</p>
                  <p>To this end an immense grant of half a million of acres was obtained from the
                     Crown, one of the conditions of which was that two hundred thousand acres
                     should be located immediately, and one hundred families seated thereon within
                     seven years. The whole tract was to be located south of the Ohio, and between
                     the Monongahela and the Kenhawa rivers. Two cargoes of Indian goods were at
                     once sent over, and Captain Gist engaged to make thorough explorations of the
                     West: examine the quality of the lands; draw a map of the country; make
                     friendly visits to the Indians in peaceful possession of the territory desired,
                     and report to the board. Gist was absent on his first tour nearly seven months,
                     penetrating the wilderness for several hundred miles north of the Ohio, and
                     proceeding as far as the falls of that river, where Louisville now stands. In
                     November, 1751, he passed down the south side of the river down to the Big
                     Kenhawa, and spent the winter in studying the ground. He reported that it would
                     be vain to do much before winning over the consent of the Indians, and gaining
                     their friendship, which he did the next year, at a grand conference held at
                     Logstown, a few miles below Pittsburgh. Mr. Lee, the projector of the Company,
                     dying, the chief management devolved on Laurence Washington, who had a project
                     of settling a German colony on the lands. Mr. Gist was instructed to lay off a
                     town and fort at McKee's Rocks, near the mouth of Chartiers Creek, about three
                     miles below the forks of the Ohio, and described in our story as the residence
                     of King Shingiss, of the Delawares. In the meantime, the adventurous Gist had
                     fixed his residence on this side of the mountain, near where Uniontown now
                     stands, and induced eleven families to settle around him.</p>
                  <p>Matters were in this state when the border troubles broke, out between the
                     French, English and Indians. The design of constructing the fort at Chartiers
                     was, it seems, afterwards abandoned, and the fort which, but just commenced,
                     was forced to surrender to Contreeœur in the spring of 1754, and which soon
                     grew into Fort Duquesne, was being erected for this same Ohio Company.</p>
                  <p>Nothing more was now done by the Company until 1760, after Duquesne was
                     captured by General Forbes, when Colonel Mercer went to London to procure
                     permission from the Crown to take up the grant, or to obtain a reimbursement in
                     money. But times had changed; conflicting interests were at work. General
                     attention had been turned in that direction, and finally, after a six years'
                     stay in London, Mercer was obliged to merge the interests of his Company in
                     those of Walpole's, or <hi rend="i"/>The Grand Company, as it was called. These
                     terms were not agreed to by the American members of the Company, and the matter
                     was in agitation down so far as the Revolutionary war, which ended not only the
                     Company, but also all British claims in this section.</p>

                  <head type="sub">A FEW WORDS ABOUT INDIAN TRAILS.</head>
                  <p>The Indians were great and very rapid travellers, often going hundreds of miles
                     on their hunting expeditions, or in pursuit of their foes. Although they
                     threaded the vast solitudes of the wilderness with unerring sagacity, pursuing
                     their way by day or night with marvellous precision, and by means of certain
                     infallible signs well known to them, it is a great mistake to suppose that they
                     roamed at random. They had their beaten trails, great and little, as well known
                     to them as out State and County roads are to us, and frequently far ore direct.
                     The white traders, and even military leaders often adopted them as being not
                     only the best but also the shortest routes between given points. These are now
                     almost wholly effaced or forgotten, but in some localities they can yet be very
                     distinctly traced.</p>
                  <p>We make mention in the story of the great Indian trail from Kittanning, on the
                     Allegheny river, to Philadelphia, called the "Kittanning Path," and which
                     formed the great highway between East and West, first for the Indians, and
                     afterwards for white pioneers, settlers, and<pb n="482-483"
                        xml:id="VAC7175-00000249"/> traders with their pack-horses. This path,
                     distinct traces of which can yet be plainly seen in various places, was a
                     famous road in its day. Commencing at Kittanning, it crossed the Allegheny
                     Mountains in a southeastern direction, the descent on the eastern slope being
                     through a gorge at what is now known as Kittanning Point, a few miles west of
                     Hollidaysburg. Thence it went through what are now called Scotch, Canoe,
                     Hartstog and Woodcock valleys, crossing the Broadtop Mountain into Aughwick;
                     thence into Tuscarora and Sherman's valleys to the Susquehanna.</p>
                  <p>At Kittanning Point, the indentation made by the feet of thousands upon
                     thousands of warriors, traders and pack-horses which travelled it for an
                     unknown number of years, are still plainly visible. In some places, where the
                     ground is marshy, close to the run, the path is at least a foot deep, and the
                     very stones along the road bear the marks of the traders' iron-shod horses,
                     while occasionally you can pick up gun-flints or arrow-heads.</p>
                  <p>Another great east-and-west route went from Smoky Island, across from Fort
                     Duquesne, along the margin of the Ohio river, to Fort McIntosh, where Beaver,
                     Pa., now stands, and extending westward to Sandusky and Detroit. Following the
                     highest ground, it passed by Salt Springs, Trumbull county. It also ran through
                     Palmyra, Portage county, near which there are even to this late day several
                     large piles of stone, under which skeletons were found. The trees have also
                     been found painted along this as well as other beaten Indian trails. In some
                     places the bark has been carefully shaved off two-thirds the way round, and
                     figures cut in. This trail is yet a plain beaten path west of the Beaver river,
                     near the Mahoning. Another great trail led more directly west across Big Beaver
                     to the Tuscarawas branch of the Muskingum.</p>
                  <p>What is called "Nemacolin's Path" was a different great Indian trail, which led
                     east from the "Forks of the Ohio," through southern Pennsylvania. At the
                     instance of the Ohio Company, Nemacolin, a well-known Delaware, who resided at
                     the mouth of Dunlap's Creek, Fayette county, "blazed" the forest path from
                     Wills Creek to the Ohio, which was the original tracing of that great highway
                     now known as the National or Cumberland road. In 1753 it was well-marked and
                     cleared of bushes and fallen timber, so as to make it a good pack-horse road.
                     "Gist's plantation" was located on this road, which afterwards became
                     Braddock's road, but as Judge Veech forcibly contends, that was a misnomer; it
                     should have been called <hi rend="i"/>Washington's road, for he made it to
                     Gist's; from Gist's to Turtle Creek it was Braddock's.</p>
                  <p>Still another very prominent and ancient north-and-south path was the old
                     Catawba or Cherokee trail, leading from the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, etc.,
                     through Virginia and western Pennsylvania, on to western New York and Canada.
                     The principal trail entered Fayette county at the mouth of Grassy Run; a
                     tributary trail, called the <hi rend="i"/>Warrior Branch, came into it from
                     Tennessee, Kentucky and southern Ohio. The main Catawba trail passed along
                     where now stand Union-town and Connellsville; thence across Westmoreland county
                     to the head of the Susquehanna, and into western New York, where the Six
                     Nations lived and compelled the periodical attendance of the various conquered
                     tribes.</p>
                  <p>Many other Indian trails have been traced, and could be here noted, but we may
                     say in general, that between all important sections or Indian tribes and towns,
                     great and well-beaten trails served as communications.</p>

                  <head type="sub">LANGLADE, THE LEADER OF THE LAKE INDIANS.</head>
                  <p>In the third volume of the "<title>Wisconsin Historical
                     Collections</title>"—kindly placed in our hands by Judge Veech, of
                     Pittsburgh—we note an interesting account of Sieur Charles de Langlade, as
                     taken by Lyman C. Draper, Esq., from the lips of Captain Grignon, a grandson of
                     Charles de Langlade. In this account we find two positive assertions, new to
                     us: First, that Charles de Langlade led the Lake Indians at Brad-dock's defeat;
                     and Second, that Pontiac, the famous Ottawa Chief, was undoubtedly among the
                     number. This latter fact does not seem to have been certainly known to Parkman
                     himself, since in his "History of the Conspiracy of Pontiac" when writing the
                     biography of the famous chief, he says: "It is <emph>said</emph> that he
                     commanded the Ottawas at the memorable defeat of Braddock."</p>
                  <p>Charles was the son of Augustin de Langlade—called the founder of Wisconsin—his
                     mother being the sister of the head Ottawa chief, king Nis-so-wa-quet. At the
                     breaking out of the French war, he was about thirty years old, and a bold and
                     influential half-breed Indian Chief. Such was his skill, high standing, and
                     influence over the Indians, that he was appointed by the Governor-General of
                     New France to head the partisan force of French and Indians in the war then
                     about to commence. He first repaired to Fort Duquesne, and was with Pontiac and
                     king Nis-so-wa-quet at the great battle. Langlade demanded of Beaujeu several
                     times that the attack should be made on Braddock's army, just after they had
                     crossed the river, and while they were at dinner, but Beaujeu for some time
                     refused, disheartened at the size and drill of Braddock's force; but finally
                     the order was given, "and the English officers, who had their little towels
                     pinned over their breasts, seized their arms and took part in the conflict, and
                     a good many of them were killed with these napkins still pinned on their
                     coats." This statement is very improbable; not to speak of the absurdity of
                     English officers, after months of weary marching, eating their frugal meal with
                     napkins, it is not very likely they would rush to the battle-field nearly half
                     a mile off, with them still pinned on. We rather suspect it was the light
                     yellow-and-buff facings on the uniforms which were mistaken for napkins.</p>
                  <p>The account goes on to say that most of the French and Indians who were killed
                     were not hit by the enemies' bullets, but by the falling limbs cut from the
                     trees by the over-shooting of the English cannon. As soon as the defeat was
                     sure, Langlade had all the liquors found among the English stores poured upon
                     the ground lest the Indians should indulge. La Choisie and de Rocheblave, two
                     young French officers with Langlade, quarrelled over the superb uniform of an
                     English officer, and the next morning La Choisie was found assassinated and his
                     purse missing; Rocheblave was strongly suspected of the crime. After Braddock's
                     repulse, Langlade was sent by Dumas to go towards Cumberland, and ascertain the
                     English strength and movements, and should the Indians take any prisoners, to
                     use his best efforts to prevent their torturing them.</p>

                  <head type="sub">WONDERFUL CAREER OF COL. JAMES SMITH.</head>
                  <p>The lad James Smith, whom we have introduced as a fellow-prisoner with Talbot,
                     in Fort Duquesne, was a veritable character in Pennsylvania history. He had a
                     most adventurous career, and the diary published of his five years' life among
                     the Indians, as the adopted son of Tecanghretanego, furnishes the fullest and
                     most faithful account ever printed of the habits, customs, sentiments and daily
                     forest life of the American Indian.</p>
                  <p>In May, 1755, young smith, then about eighteen years of age joined a force of
                     three hundred men sent out be Pennsylvania to cut a road fall into that of
                     Braddock's at the "Turkey-foot; of the Yough river. Although, as he says,
                     violently in love with an amiable young lady, he worked diligently, until one
                     morning he was captured by a body of Indians, hurried, off to Fort Duquesne,
                     and forced to run the gauntlet just outside the fort, much as Talbot is
                     described to have done. He was the only English person in the fort, and it is
                     to him the public is indebted for the <emph>only</emph> account of the
                     French-Indian departure for the battle, their return from the bloody field
                     laden down with scalps and spoils, and the subsequent torture of the prisoners
                     on Smoky Island.</p>
                  <p>A few days after, his captor demanded him, and the adoption scene we have given
                     was very much the same—the washing in the river by young squaws included—as he
                     himself went through. He was then, according to the universal Indian custom,
                     treated exactly as if he had been born and bred one of themselves. Smith
                     describes very fully the daily habits of his Indians, their lives, dances,
                     funerals, arts of war, and methods of gaining a livelihood, some of which are
                     very singular and entertaining, He had good times and bad times, accompanying
                     the Indians in their bee, deer, and horse hunts, their them their privations
                     and seasons of plenty.</p>
                  <p>Smith says that the French were deserted by the Indians during Forbes' campaign
                     against Duquesne, because Forbes had very many American riflemen with him, and
                     that they were learning the art of war; that if it was only redcoats they had
                     to deal with, they could conquer, but they could not withstand the Big Knives,
                     the name they gave the Virginians. When they heard of Grant's defeat they
                     called him crazy, saying that the art of war consists in ambushing and
                     surprising enemies; that Grant did well in artfully approaching the fort by
                     night; but when the Indians were all asleep outside the fort, and could easily
                     have been destroyed, the whites had to beat their drums and play their
                     bagpipes, and the only way they could account for such folly was that he and
                     his force were drunk. Young Smith remained with the Indians five whole years,
                     and when on an expedition with them to Montreal where he was detained a
                     prisoner for months he was there exchanged, reaching his home at Conococheaque
                     to find himself taken for an Indian and his sweetheart married but a few days
                     before his arrival. He did not appear, however, to take this disappointment
                     much to heart; but married in 1763, and on account of his bravery and knowledge
                     of Indian fighting, was elected captain of a ranger company dressed exactly as
                     Indians, and with faces painted red and black.</p>
                  <p>In '64, Smith was Lieutenant with Col. Bouquet's famous expedition against the
                     Muskingum Indians. In '65, he, and his Indian Boys, carried on war against the
                     Indian traders who were supplying the red men with ammunition, etc., contrary
                     to law; and afterwards raised three hundred riflemen, who were engaged in
                     various services. In '66, he went West to hunt lands on which to settle, and
                     explored great parts of Kentucky and Tennessee. On his return he was
                     accompanied by no one but a mulatto, and received a serious stab in his foot,
                     which compelled him to make a severe surgical operation with his knife, and
                     Kept him in the woods several months. He had now been eleven months in the
                     wilderness, and during this time saw, as he says, neither bread, money, women,
                     nor spirituous liquors, and for three months no human being except Jamie, the
                     mulatto. His clothes were worn out, and Jamie had on nothing but skins of
                     beasts. He returned home in '67, and, the Indians again proving troublesome,
                     took up his old business of fighting Indian traders. Some of his companions
                     were put in irons at Fort Bedford, and Smith, raising eighteen of his old
                     "black boys," made a gallant attack on the fort, and released the prisoners.
                     "This, I believe", quaintly writes Smith, "was the first British fort in
                     America taken by American rebels."</p>
                  <p>He was soon arrested, put in irons at Bedford, and brought in guilty of murder;
                     taken to Carlisle for fear of arrest, he remained in prison four months, stood
                     his trial, was acquitted, and an Indian war breaking out again, was appointed
                     Major, and at the commencement of the revolution, a member of the Pennsylvania
                     Assembly. Smith, however, soon pined for active life again, and raising a
                     scouting party, he marched into the Jerseys before Washington's army, and did
                     excellent service. In 78, Smith became Colonel, and soon took four hundred
                     riflemen on an expedition against an Indian town on French Creek.</p>
                  <p>In 1788, he settled in Bourbon county, Kentucky, and represented that district
                     in the Assembly down to the present century.</p>

                  <p>The description of Frazier's house is taken from Rev. Dr. Doddridge's notes on
                     our Western Settlements, (now out of print). Most of the frontier cabins of
                     those early days were fashioned in a similar rude style. The furniture
                     consisted of a few pewter dishes and spoons; but mostly of wooden bowls,
                     trenchers, and noggins; or of gourds and hard-shelled squashes. Iron pots,
                     knives and forks were brought from the East, along with the salt and wire, on
                     pack hordes. "Hog and hominy " was the chief food, jonny cakes and pone being
                     the only bread. At supper mush and milk was the standard dish; when milk was
                     scarce, molasses, bear's oil, or ham gravy was the substitute. The
                     "truck-patch" attached to every cabin supplied the roasting-ears, squashes,
                     pumpkins, beans and potatoes, which were cooked with pork, venison, and
                     bear-meat.</p>
                  <p>The frontier dress for the men was partly Indian; the chief article being the
                     hunting shirt, which was a loose frock open before, with large sleeves,
                     reaching half-way down the thighs, and lapping over the waist belt a foot or
                     more. The cape was large and handsomely fringed with ravelled cloth. The belt
                     had suspended on one side the bullet-bag, and tomahawk, and on the other the
                     scalping knife in<pb n="486-487" xml:id="VAC7175-00000251"/> a leather sheath.
                     A pair of drawers or breeches and fringed leggings covered the legs, while
                     moccasins of dressed deerskin served much better than shoes. They were neatly
                     made of a single piece, with a gathering seam along the top of the foot, and
                     another from the bottom of the heel, without gather, as high as the ankle
                     joint. Flaps neatly tied to the ankles and lower part of the legs by thongs of
                     doeskin, so as to exclude dirt, snow, or sand, were left on each side. Each
                     hunter made his own moccasins in a few hours with a moccasin awl, which,
                     together with a roll of buckskin and thongs or whangs for mending, was part of
                     the regular trappings. In cold weather the moccasins were well stuffed with
                     deer's hair or dry leaves, but in wet weather moccasin wearing was only a
                     decent way of going barefoot due to the spongy texture or the leather. Owing to
                     this, Indians as well as whites, were much afflicted with rheumatism, and this
                     was the reason why, at night, all slept with their feet to the fire. Very
                     frequently young frontier men became so much enamored of the Indian dress that
                     drawers were laid aside, and the leggings made to come well up on the thigh,
                     and the breech-clout adopted, which last was a piece of linen or cloth nearly a
                     yard long and eight or nine inches broad. This passed under the belt before and
                     behind, leaving the ends for flaps with ornamented ends hanging over the belt.
                     Where this belt passed over the hunting shirt, the upper part of the thighs and
                     part of the hips were naked. Doddridge asserts that the young hunter instead of
                     being abashed by this nudity, was proud of his Indian dress, frequently
                     entering houses of worship thus clad. Their appearance, however, did not,
                     according to the veracious chronicler, "add much to the devotion of the young
                     ladies."</p>
                  <p>The linsey petticoat and bed-gown formed the universal dress of the women, with
                     a small home-made 'kerchief about the neck. They went barefoot in warm weather,
                     while in cold their feet were covered with moccasins, or coarse shoe-packs. The
                     garments of both men and women were hung around the cabin on wooden pegs. The
                     young women of these days knew nothing of curls, ruffles, rings, jewels, or
                     other modern adornments. Instead of the toilet they had to handle the distaff
                     or shuttle, the sickle or weeding hoe, contented if they could obtain their
                     linsey clothing, and cover their heads with a sun bonnet.</p>
                  <p>Doddridge gives an interesting account of the manner in vogue in those rude
                     times of settling a young couple for life. Their cabin was built by neighbors.
                     First were the choppers, then those who hauled and sorted the logs on the
                     chosen spot. The best axeman searched the woods for a straight-grained tree
                     from three to four feet thick, for making clapboards for the roof. These were
                     split four feet long, with a large iron and as wide as the timber would allow,
                     and were used without hewing. Others still got out puncheons for the floor by
                     splitting young trees, and hewing the faces with the broad axe. They were half
                     the length of the floor they were intended to make. The second day was allotted
                     for the raising. Four cornermen were first selected, whose business was to
                     notch and place the logs. The rest raised the timber to their places. When the
                     cabin was raised a few rounds high, the sleepers and floor began to be laid.
                     Next, a door was made by cutting the logs on one side so as to make an opening
                     about three feet wide; a wider opening was made for the chimney, which was
                     built of logs and made large to admit a back and jams of stone. The roof was
                     formed by making the end logs shorter until a single log formed the comb of the
                     roof. On these the clap-board were placed, the ranges of them lapping some
                     distance over those next below, and kept in their places by logs resting on
                     them. A third day was spent in levelling off the floor, finishing up, making a
                     rude door, table, bedstead, and three-legged stools. Then the masons made
                     billets for chinking up the cracks between the logs, which were plastered over
                     with mud mortar. The cabin being thus finished and furnished, the house warming
                     took up a whole night, and consisted of a vigorous dance, made up of the
                     groom's and bride's relations, and all the neighbors. On the following day the
                     young couple took possession of their new house.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE SHAWNEES, AND THEIE CHIEF, BLACKHOOF.</head>
                  <p>The Shawnee tribe were a very peculiar people; brave, restless, warlike, and
                     adventurous, who were certainly from the South, some say from the Suwanee
                     river, Florida. They first appeared in Pennsylvania, about the year 1700, at
                     Montour's Island, on the Ohio, six miles below Pittsburgh. Part remained there,
                     while divisions went Eastward, settling on the Delaware and Susquehanna. In
                     1728, they finally migrated West, and located near the Ohio and Allegheny. In
                     '32, they had so grown in numbers, that half the warriors in Pennsylvania
                     belonged to that tribe. They had several villages between Fort Duquesne and
                     Beaver, and, as at first they considered themselves under the protection of the
                     Delawares, so they always called them <emph>grandfathers,</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Shawnees have had many noted chiefs, among the most warlike and influential
                     of whom was Catahecassa, or the Blackhoof of our tale. He died at Wapakonetta,
                     Allen county, Ohio, aged over one hundred years, shortly before the removal of
                     the Shawnees in 1832 to beyond the Mississippi. He always asserted that he was
                     born in Florida, near salt water. Certain it is, he was at Braddock's defeat,
                     and engaged in all the subsequent Ohio wars down to the treaty of Greenville in
                     1795. He won the confidence of the whole nation by his sagacity, adventurous
                     spirit, and success in warfare, and never lacked <emph>braves</emph> to follow
                     him in his many warlike excursions. He was known far and wide as the
                        <emph>great Shawnee warrior,</emph> who was bold to plan, zealous to carry
                     out, and successful in his battles and expeditions.</p>
                  <p>Blackhoof was the inveterate foe of the whites, and would never consent to
                     smoke, treat, or make peace with them unless they would agree to go back over
                     the mountains. He was the chief orator of his tribe for many years. Col.
                     Johnston, the famous Indian agent, described him as the most graceful Indian he
                     ever saw, and as having a most natural and happy faculty of expressing his
                     ideas. He was well versed in all the traditions of his people, and their
                     relations to, and treaties with the whites; but although stern and
                     uncompromising, and the hero of a hundred battles, yet, when convinced that
                     opposition was unavailing, he lived a friendly and peaceable life with his old
                     foes. Before Wayne's great victory over the combined tribes, he was hopeful,
                     but after he saw further resistance was useless, resolved to make terms, signed
                     the treaty of Greenville, and continued faithful to it through life. He was the
                     principal chief of the Shawnees when<pb n="488-489" xml:id="VAC7175-00000252"/>
                     Tecumseh and his brother the prophet took up arms. They tried long to enlist
                     Blackhoof, but he not only steadily refused himself, but kept back the greater
                     portion of his tribe. In that contest he was the ally of the United States,
                     exerting a salutary influence over his people. In January, 1813, while on a
                     visit to General Tapper's camp, at Fort McArthur, some miscreant fired through
                     a hole in the wall, and shot the old chief in the face. The ball passed through
                     his cheek and lodged in his neck. For some time he was supposed dead, but
                     gradually recovered. He was opposed to burning prisoners, and to polygamy,
                     living over forty years with one wife, and raising a large family. He was
                     cheerful and agreeable in his deportment, of medium size, and had good health
                     and unimpaired eyesight to the last. The famous Tecumseh, and his father
                     Puckeshinwa, mentioned as one of the leaders of the ball-match before Fort
                     Duquesne, were of the Shawnee tribe.</p>

                  <head type="sub">BRADDOCK BADLY SWINDLED IN HORSES.</head>
                  <p>Braddock, before starting on his expedition, had been promised twenty-five
                     hundred horses, and two hundred and fifty wagons from Maryland and Virginia;
                     but twenty wagons and two hundred horses were all that could be procured, and
                     these after so long a delay and of such a wretched, miserable character, that
                     the march would never have been made had not Franklin by his famous
                     proclamation among the German farmers of Pennsylvania—in which he threatened
                     that if they did not hurry forward horses and wagons, Sir John St. Clair, the
                     Hussar, would override the province and impress what he wanted—raised one
                     hundred and fifty wagons and five hundred horses, and thus enabled the force to
                     move. It is well known that Franklin ran greatly in debt in this service, and
                     that a commission sat in Lancaster ten days in '56 to audit and settle his
                     claims against the government. This was not the only instance of Franklin's
                     practical common-sense way of doing things. When the army was at Wills Creek,
                     both officers and soldiers were nearly starved—no butter, spoiled meat, and
                     mouldy bread. Franklin visited the camp and saw the condition of affairs, and
                     was the means of having ¥5000 expended by Pennsylvania in supplying tea,
                     coffee, cheese, wines, hams, tongues, and requisite accessories for the
                     officers' needs, for which he had their repeated thanks. Again, he organized a
                     good postal service, by which the communications between the army and the
                     different provinces were prompt and regular. But to return to the horses; as
                     Washington truly said, "There was vile management there." Instead of proper
                     draught-horses, all sorts of broken-down hacks, and sprained, windgall ponies
                     were shamelessly palmed off on the army by contractors. Besides, the very
                     owners and a lot of base camp-followers hung on the skirts of the army during
                     the whole march, stealing every horse that was left to graze without a guard.
                     Over three hundred were thus made away with. What these scoundrels left, were
                     either stolen by the Indians, or broken-down by hard usage and extra service;
                     so that Dunbar could only move half his wagons at a time. After one day's march
                     the poor beasts were sent back to bring up the remainder, and it was invariably
                     two days more ere the detachment could start from the spot of the first night's
                     encampment.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE TOUCHING STORY OF FANNY BEADDOCK.</head>
                  <p>The story of Braddock's sister, Fanny, which Goldsmith relates at length in his
                     life of Beau Nash, is a sad and touching one. She was left a large fortune at
                     her sister's decease, moved in the very best society, and contracted a passion
                     for elegance. "Whatever the finest poet could conceive of wit, or the most
                     celebrated painter imagine of beauty, were excelled in the perfections of this
                     young lady." Naturally gay, sprightly, and generous to a fault, and excelling
                     in conversation, she left writings both in prose and verse which were as witty
                     and brilliant as any in that age. Her chief failing was imprudence in the use
                     of money. Anxious to relieve distress, she was lavish beyond reason; at
                     nineteen she was surrounded by lovers, among whom was S——, a talented but
                     unfortunate man, whose love, pity, generosity, and even friendship, were all in
                     excess. He was called "the good-natured man," and became Mistress Braddock's
                     favorite. Very soon his debts becoming overwhelming, he was arrested and thrown
                     into prison, and his lady-love immediately took the fatal resolution of
                     releasing him by discharging all his debts. All the admonitions of Nash and her
                     other friends were disregarded. Her fortune was by this means exhausted, and,
                     with all her attractions, she lost rank and esteem, and accepted Nash's
                     invitation of a return to Bath, where, for a time, she moved in the very first
                     circles, but a settled melancholy now possessed her, and nothing could divert
                     her.</p>
                  <p>Her beauty, simplicity, and artlessness finally made her the victim of a
                     designing woman who kept fashionable gambling rooms, and who by flattery, loans
                     of money, etc., soon gained an entire ascendency over the thoughtless deserted
                     girl, and in 1727, Miss Fanny Braddock, without, as Goldsmith says, "ever
                     transgressing the laws of virtue, had entirely lost her reputation. Whenever a
                     person was wanting to make up a party for play at dame Lindsey's, Sylvia, as
                     she was then familiarly called, was sent for, and was obliged to suffer all
                     those slights which the rich but too often let fall upon their inferiors in
                     point of fortune."</p>
                  <p>This charming girl struggled hard with adversity, and yielded to every
                     encroachment of contempt with sullen reluctance. Matters soon grew from bad to
                     worse, until her friend Nash induced her to break off all connection with dame
                     Lindsey, and to rent part of a house, where she behaved with the utmost
                     complaisance, regularity, and virtue; but her detestation of life still grew on
                     her, and about this time she frequently dwelt, and conversed much, on suicide.
                     She soon became so poor that, unable to mix in company for want of the
                     elegancies of dress, she lived a lonely and deserted life, and accepted the
                     position of governess in Mr. Wood's family.</p>
                  <p>While he and part of his household were absent in London, she conceived the
                     fatal resolution of leaving a life in which she could see no corner for
                     comfort. Thus resolved she sat down at the dining-room window, and with cool
                     intrepidity wrote the following lines on one of the panes:— <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>O death! thou pleasing end of human woe;</l>
                           <l>Thou cure for life! thou greatest good below;</l>
                           <l>Still mayst thou fly the coward and the slave,</l>
                           <l>And thy soft slumbers only bless the brave.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>

                  <p>She then went into company with the most cheerful serenity, and ordered supper
                     to be ready in the little library, where she spent the hours before bedtime, in
                     dandling two of Mr. Wood's children on her knees. From this point we quote
                     Goldsmith:</p>
                  <p>"In retiring to her chamber, she went into the nursery to take her leave of
                     another child, as it lay sleeping in the cradle. Struck with the innocence of
                     its looks, and the consciousness of her meditated guilt, she could not avoid
                     bursting into tears, and hugging it in her arms. She then bid her old servant
                     good-night, and went to bed as usual. She soon quitted it, however, and dressed
                     herself in clean linen and white garments of every kind, like a bridesmaid. Her
                     gown was pinned over her breast, just as a nurse pins the swaddling clothes of
                     an infant. A pink silk girdle was the instrument with which she resolved to
                     terminate her misery, and this was lengthened by another made of gold thread.
                     The end of the former was tied with a noose, and the latter with three
                     knots.</p>
                  <p>"Thus prepared, she sat down and read: for she left the book open at that
                     place, in the story of Olympia, in the 'Orlando Furioso' of Ariosto, where, by
                     the pity and ingratitude of her bosom friend, she was ruined and left to the
                     mercy of an unpitying world. This fatal event gave her fresh spirits to go
                     through her tragical purpose. So, standing upon a stool, and flinging the
                     girdle which was tied round her neck, over a closet door that opened into her
                     chamber, she remained suspended. Her weight, however, broke the girdle, and the
                     poor despairer fell on the floor with such violence that her fall awakened a
                     workman that lay in the house, about half after two. Recovering herself, she
                     began to walk about the room, as her usual custom was when she wanted sleep,
                     and the workman imagining it to be only some ordinary accident, again went to
                     sleep.</p>
                  <p>"She once more, therefore, had recourse to a stronger girdle, made of silver
                     thread, and this kept her suspended till she died. Her old maid waited as usual
                     for the ringing of the bell, hour after hour, until two of the afternoon, when
                     the workman entering by the window, found their unfortunate mistress still
                     hanging and quite cold. The coroner's jury brought in a verdict of lunacy, and
                     her corpse was next night decently buried in her father's grave.</p>
                  <p>"Thus ended," concludes Goldsmith, "a female wit, a toast and a gamester;
                     loved, admired, and forsaken; formed for the delight of society, fallen by
                     imprudence to be an object of pity. Hundreds in high life lamented her fate,
                     and bought up her effects with the greatest avidity; and she remains the
                     strongest instance to posterity that want of prudence alone almost cancels
                     every other virtue."</p>
                  <p>When the news of the suicide was told to her brother, Edward Braddock, he is
                     said to have uttered this cruel and unfeeling play upon words: "Poor Fanny, I
                     always thought she would play till she would be forced to '<emph>tie herself
                        up.</emph>'" To "tie oneself up from play" was a cant phrase of the day for
                     incurring some obligation, which should act as a restraint upon gambling.</p>

                  <head type="sub">WASHINGTON'S OPINION OF BRADDOCK.</head>
                  <p>Nile's Register for May, 1818, contains a deeply interesting account, written
                     out for the Editor, by the venerable William Findley, Youngstown, Pa., of a
                     conversation held with President Washington, concerning Braddock's defeat. He
                     said that Braddock was unfortunate, but his character was very much top
                     severely treated; that he was one of the best and honestest of any British
                     officers with whom he had been acquainted. Even in the manner of fighting he
                     was not more to blame than others; that of all were consulted, only not person
                     (probably himself), objected to it. "Braddock was both my general and my
                     physician. I was attacked with a dangerous fever on the march, and he left a
                     sergeant to take care of me, and gave me fever powders, with directions how to
                     use them, and a wagon to bring me on when I would be able, which was only the
                     day before the defeat, the first day I had ridden a horse for a considerable
                     time, and then had to ride with a pillow under me." The President stated, also,
                     that when once out, during Forbes' campaign in '58, he ran the greatest hazard
                     of his life; that he had been ordered to reinforce a bullock guard on their way
                     to camp, and marched his party single file, with trailed arms, sending a runner
                     to inform the British officer in what manner he could meet him. The officer
                     some how misunderstood him, and the parties met in the dark, and fired on each
                     other, till they killed thirty of their own men; nor could they be stopped till
                     he had to go in between their fires, and throw up the muzzles of their guns
                     with his sword.</p>

                  <head type="sub">BRITISH AND AMERICAN OFFICERS ENGAGED.</head>
                  <p>Many of the officers—both British and American—beside those mentioned, rose to
                     prominence in. after times. It is generally stated that Hugh Mercer, the hero
                     of Trenton, was present, but this is a mistake. The first mention we have of
                     this sturdy Scotchman, is in Armstrong's expedition against Kitanning in '56.
                     There was a George and a John Mercer, both of whom were at Fort Necessity, with
                     Washington, but no Hugh Mercer with Braddock. Dr. Hugh Mercer was left by
                     General Forbes in command of the handful of troops placed in charge of the
                     ruins of Fort Duquesne in '58, and subsequently took prominent part in our
                     revolution. Captain Adam Stephen, of the Virginia Rangers, rose to be Colonel
                     of Virginia troops, and was a general officer of the revolution. General
                     Horatio Gates, who figured so conspicuously in our revolution, and whose
                     peculiarities are a well-known part of American history, did not cut much of a
                     figure in this expedition. Colonel Dunbar, "the Tardy," notwithstanding his
                     disgraceful retreat, was made a British Major-General in '58, and a
                     Lieutenant-General in '60. Lieutenant Gladwyn, distinguished for his very
                     gallant defence of Detroit against Pontiac, was made Colonel in '77, and
                     Major-General in '82. Engineer Harry Gordon, who first discovered the foe at
                     Braddock's Fields, became Lieutenant-Colonel in '77. Captain Morris, Braddock's
                     aid, married in 1758, the beautiful and celebrated Mary Philipse, of New York,
                     a great heiress, for whose hand Washington himself was a suitor. The landed
                     possessions of the Philipse family were enormous, embracing much of the site of
                     New York City. Adhering to the crown at the outbreak of the revolution, their
                     estates were confiscated and the children's claims were purchased by John Jacob
                     Astor for $100,000, worth at that time $5,000,000, but, at present,
                     incalculable. Lieutenant-Colonel Burton rose to be Major-General in '62. He
                        once<pb n="492-493" xml:id="VAC7175-00000254"/> about this time fell
                     desperately in love with the tawny daughter of an Indian Chief, and some state
                     that he married her. Captain Lewis, of the Virginia Rangers, had five brothers
                     in his Company, and became the General Lewis, whom Washington, at the outbreak
                     of the, revolution, considered the foremost of all American soldiers. Sir John
                     St. Clair remained a long time in service in America, and in '62 was made a
                     full Colonel. At Braddock's defeat he "was shot through the body under the
                     right pap;" and so we might run on. Certain it is, however, that Braddock's
                     campaign proved a dear school to many a young and ambitious officer who
                     afterwards sought service and achieved distinction in different fields.</p>

                  <head type="sub">GENERAL DANIEL MORGAN'S LASHES.</head>
                  <p>The whipping administered to General Daniel Morgan, the celebrated Commander of
                     the Riflemen of the revolution, is a historical fact, acknowledged by himself,
                     but authorities differ as to the time, place, and details. It is also an
                     undeniable fact that Morgan, when about nineteen years of age, was a wagoner
                     employed by Braddock. We have given the common version of this whipping, but
                     Dr. Wm. Hill, of Winchester, Va., who was General Morgan's pastor and most
                     intimate friend, gives another, as follows:</p>
                  <p>"Upon one occasion, while assisting in changing his linen, I discovered his
                     back to be covered with scars and ridges, from shoulders to the waist!
                     'General,' said I, 'what has been the matter with your back?' 'Oh,' replied he,
                     'that has been the doing of old King George. While I was in his service upon a
                     certain occasion, he promised to give me five hundred lashes. But he failed in
                     his promise, and gave me but four hundred and ninety-nine, so he has been owing
                     me one lash ever since. While the drummer was laying them on my back, I heard
                     him miscount one. I was counting after him at the time. I did not think it
                     worth while to tell him of his mistake, and let it go.'"</p>

                  <head type="sub">SIR PETER HALKET AND "SECOND SIGHT."</head>
                  <p>We do no violence to probability in making Sir Peter Halket have a vision of
                     what is called "Second Sight." It was not only a general Scotch belief of that
                     day, but long after and even yet, Walter Scott makes great use of it in his
                     novels. All will remember in "Waverly" the eve of the battle of Preston-Pans in
                     1745, when Callum Beg aimed his fusee at the English Colonel, Gardiner, and was
                     about to shoot, when an aged Highland seer stopped his arm, saying 'Spare your
                     shot, his hour is not yet come, but let him beware of to-morrow. <emph>I see
                        his winding sheet high up on his breast</emph>." This is easily explained.
                     The Taish, or Second Sight, was a faculty which Scottish seers were said to
                     possess, without any volition on their part, of seeing future events as if
                     present before their eyes. When a vision comes, the eyes stare until the object
                     vanishes, and sometimes a swoon ensues. The time of the foreseen occurence is
                     judged by the time of the day at Which the vision occurs; if early in the
                     morning, it will be accomplished a few hours afterwards; if at noon, that
                        <emph>very day;</emph> if in the evening, that night; if in the night,
                     according to the lateness of the hour; in days, weeks, months, and sometimes
                     years. A shroud seen about a man is to them a sign of death. If said shroud be
                     below the middle, death will not come for a year; but if it be around the upper
                     part of the body, death may be expected in a few hours or days. Thus the
                     significance of Callum Beg's and Halket's remarks. Scott, in a note on old
                     Allan-bane, in his "Lady of the Lake," almost professes his belief in the
                     Taish, and quotes Martin's account of it, and how to interpret the sights seen.
                     The beautiful and well-known poem of "Lochiel," by Campbell, will also occur to
                     the reader.</p>

                  <head type="sub">INDIAN CHIEFS, AND CHRISTIAN POST.</head>
                  <p>The Chiefs here mentioned were some of the most noted of that day. The
                     assertion made that most of them, with their followers, could have been firmly
                     held in the British interest, had they been as justly, liberally, and politicly
                     treated by them as by the French, is a well-established historic fact. It
                     admits of not a particle of doubt. The Delawares and Shawnees, especially, were
                     the old-time allies of the British, and the committee appointed by the
                     Pennsylvania Assembly to enquire into the reasons of the alienation and
                     hostility of these two tribes in particular, set forth very plainly the causes
                     for Indian estrangement. The main complaint was that the British were
                     constantly, by means of negotiations, feastings, presents, etc., buying from
                     the Six Nations who claimed to be their masters, the land from under their
                     feet. Scarooyaddy and Andrew Montour stated to the Assembly that the defection
                     was secretly encouraged by the Six Nations, and that their hostility grew more
                     bold and open after Braddock's defeat, owing to the seeming weakness, and want
                     of union among the English, and to their inability or unwillingness to protect
                     them. It might have fared very much with General Forbes as with General
                     Braddock, had not Christian Frederick Post, a worthy Moravian Missionary, been
                     sent on two separate visits to the Delawares and Shawnees, gathered about the
                     head of the Ohio. Post kept a very interesting diary, giving a faithful account
                     of his travels, difficulties, and various talks with the Indians. 'He found
                     them sick of the war, anxious for peace, and re-alliance with the English. He
                     saw Kings Beaver, and Shingiss; Killbuck, Kuckquetackton, Pisquetumen,
                     Keteuskund, and Delaware George, who seemed as much surpised as pleased at
                     Post's representations, all agreeing that if they had known the feelings and
                     good intentions the British had towards them, they never would have taken up
                     the hatchet against them.</p>

                  <head type="sub">COLONEL BOUQUET'S DEFEAT OF GUYASUTHA.</head>
                  <p>The bloody and desperate battle fought on the 5th and 6th of August, 1763,
                     between Colonel, afterwards General Henry Bouquet and Guyasutha, the celebrated
                     Seneca Chief, is memorable for two reasons—because of the ruse by which it was
                     won, and because it<pb n="494-495" xml:id="VAC7175-00000255"/> furnishes a
                     sample of an Indian battle fairly fought, and gallantly won. For it cannot be
                     well denied that down to the decisive victory of "mad Anthony Wayne," August
                     20th, 1794, over the combined forces of the Ohio Indians, which led to the
                     cession to the United States of all Eastern Ohio, the Indians had been almost
                     uniformly successful. Fighting Indians is an art which has cost innumerable
                     bloody and expensive battles to learn, and, is to this day very imperfectly
                     acquired; as witness the late struggle with the Oregon Modoc band.</p>
                  <p>In '63, broke out the famous Indian war, usually known as "Pontiac's war,"
                     though sometimes called "Guyasutha's war." In this contest all the Ohio Indians
                     took part, and all the British forts were attacked about the same time. Fort
                     Pitt which had succeeded Old Fort Duquesne, and which was then held by a very
                     small force under the gallant Captain Ecuyer, was very vigorously assailed.
                     Guyasutha's Indians had surrounded it and cut off all communication. Although
                     the savages had no cannon, they posted themselves under the banks of both
                     rivers, and incessantly harassed the garrison with musketry and rifles, hoping
                     by fire, famine, or perpetual annoyance to overcome the brave little
                     garrison.</p>
                  <p>Bouquet hastily assembled a small force of about five hundred, chiefly
                     Highlanders, totally unused to Indian warfare, and reached Carlisle about July.
                     He found the whole country in a panic, and the fort, and every house, barn and
                     shed crowded with settlers' families. Forts Ligonier and Bedford were first
                     reinforced in the most secret and skilful manner. Reaching Fort Ligonier on the
                     2nd of August, Bouquet left there his wagons, and adventurously proceeded with
                     pack-horses into a dangerous defile at Turtle Creek.</p>
                  <p>When within half a mile of Bushy Run, after a very harassing march of seventeen
                     miles, they were suddenly and violently attacked by Indians at one P. M. These
                     were at first beaten off, but they rushed in on all sides, and in great force
                     occupied the heights, almost completely surrounding Bouquet's little army, and
                     pouring in a most galling and fatal fire. A general charge along the whole line
                     dislodged the swarming Indians from the heights, but the savages returned again
                     and again to the attack, pouring in a murderous hail of fire in front and on
                     both flanks, and even attacking the convoy in the rear.</p>
                  <p>The contest became hotter and hotter, the savages rushing to the attack with
                     wonderful spirit and resolution, and the British holding their own with
                     obstinacy and tenacity. It was life or death with them. Darkness alone ended
                     the bloody battle. The brave little force was almost completely worn out. The
                     day had been exceedingly sultry; they had fought for seven hours on empty
                     stomachs; they were nearly tormented to death by thirst, and had coolly and
                     with desperate courage withstood the galling hail from a fiery circle of
                     whooping demons.</p>
                  <p>Right in the leafy wilderness where they had fought, on this hot sultry August
                     night, without one drop of water to cool their parched tongues and fevered
                     bodies, the poor Highlanders sank down to rest. Over-sixty of their number,
                     including several officers, had been killed or wounded. A dropping fire, and
                     occasional yells and whoops were kept up by the Indians; and in constant fear
                     of a desperate night attack, the anxious hours were dragged through. At the
                     very first streak of dawn a horrible din of yells and shrieks burst forth on
                     all sides of them, and volley after volley of bullets came whistling among
                     their thinned ranks. The combat raged fiercer and hotter than the day before.
                     The Indians seemed more desperate and reckless. They would rush up to close
                     quarters and fire from every bush and tree which could yield cover. Although
                     repulsed at every point, fresh Indians would take the places of the retreating,
                     and the conflict raged more furiously as the day advanced. Yielding their
                     ground when a charge was made, the crafty savages would vanish for a moment
                     only to come out in a new spot.</p>
                  <p>The troops maddened by thirst, minting from heat, and worn out by incessant
                     charges which led to nothing, were almost completely exhausted. Their distress
                     was so plainly visible, that the foe redoubled their horrid yells and fierce
                     attacks, approaching so near as to deride and curse them in bad English. The
                     whole camp was in utter confusion. The wounded and terror-stricken horses
                     rushed frantically about, and the drivers concealed themselves or ran away, and
                     all seemed lost. The defence became wavering and irresolute; all hope had gone,
                     and death or torture menaced the jaded but still brave survivors. If anything
                     was to be done, then was just the time, and no moment to spare.</p>
                  <p>Bouquet happily was equal to the occasion. In the very midst of despair he
                     conceived and carried into immediate execution a masterly stratagem. He
                     determined to get the Indians into one body, draw them into a trap, and then
                     give them a furious bayonet charge, and so end the conflict. Two Companies were
                     ordered to fall back suddenly in the centre, while the troops on the flank
                     should advance across the vacancy in the circle as if to cover their retreat.
                     Meanwhile another Company of Light Infantry, with one of Grenadiers, were
                     ordered to lie in ambush to support the first two Companies on the feigned
                     retreat. The stratagem took. These movements were mistaken for defeat and
                     retreat. The yelling, screeching demons, believing that their time had come at
                     last, leaped from cover on all sides and rushed headlong to the spot, pouring
                     in a most galling fire. It seemed for a moment that nothing could withstand
                     that impetuous advance and attack, but the two Companies which had retreated,
                     had, under cover of the dense woods and underbrush, made a rapid and secret
                     detour, and now burst out on each flank of the veiling, onrushing crowd of
                     savages, and discharged a heavy volley right in their very midst. The Indians,
                     though taken completely by surprise, faced about with great intrepedity, and
                     boldly returned the fire, and essayed to recover ground.</p>
                  <p>It was too late; with a wild fierce yell of rage, the Highlanders were upon
                     them with the cold steel. A well-conducted bayonet charge an Indian
                        <emph>has</emph> never and <emph>will</emph> never stand. The shock was
                     irresistible, and they fled in a tumultuous mob. Now the two other Companies,
                     who had been crouched in ambush, awaiting the moment to strike, put in an
                     appearance. As the fugitive throng, pressed back by the advancing wall of
                     bristling steel, passed directly across their front, they rose and poured in a
                     destructive volley, which ended the whole matter. The four Companies now
                     uniting soon changed flight to utter rout. No time was given them to reload;
                     many were shot or driven down, while the rest were scattered in remediless
                     confusion throughout the woods.</p>
                  <p>While all this took place in one part of the circle, the remaining savages on
                     the other sides first watched, then wavered, then lost heart, and finally
                     betook themselves to headlong flight.</p>
                  <p>And thus was this gallant little force, and its brave and skilful Swiss
                     commander, saved from a terrible disaster—snatched from the<pb n="496-497"
                        xml:id="VAC7175-00000256"/> very jaws of death. Forty Indians, some of them
                     their chief warriors, had been slain outright Bouquet lost about fifty killed,
                     and had sixty wounded. The troops had so greatly suffered, and so many horses
                     had been lost, that large amounts of stores had to be destroyed. The march was
                     still difficult and tedious, though entirely unmolested, and it was not until
                     four days after this bloody struggle that Bouquet arrived at Fort Pitt with his
                     convoy, and thus raised the siege.</p>

                  <head type="sub">WASHINGTON WISHES A MONUMENT TO BRADDOCK.</head>
                  <p>Every student of American history is familiar with the name of General Gage, so
                     indelibly associated with the outbreak of our Revolutionary War. He was second
                     son of Thomas, eighth Baronet and first Viscount Gage, and was of noble but
                     poor-family. His father once remarking in a political dispute that he always
                     gave his sons their own way. "Yes," said Winnington, "but that is the
                        <emph>only</emph> thing you ever do give them." Gage rose to high rank in
                     the British army, and married Margaret, daughter of Peter Kemble, Esq., of the
                     Cold Spring, (New York,) family of that name, and their son subsequently
                     succeeded his uncle in the Peerage. The English writer, Smollett, commits a
                     grave error when, in speaking of Braddock's defeat and retreat, he says:</p>
                  <p>"At last the General received a musket-shot through his right arm and lungs, of
                     which he died in a few hours, having been carried off the field by the
                        <emph>bravery of Lieutenant-Colonel Gage,</emph> and another of his
                     officers." Cowardice, rather than conspicuous bravery, is attributed to Gage on
                        <emph>this</emph> side of the Ocean. In Washington's conversation with
                     Findley, quoted elsewhere, the President stated there had been a coldness
                     between Braddock and Dunbar, and that after the battle, he, Washington, had
                     been sent with orders to the latter, first being commanded by Braddock to stop
                     the retreat; which was the easier to be done since the enemy did not pursue. He
                     overtook Gage <emph>three miles in advance</emph> of the place where the
                     retreat was halted, to which spot he sent Gage back; that this being done, he,
                     with two men, in one of the wettest and darkest nights, in which they had often
                     to alight and grope for the road, and after travelling forty miles, arrived at
                     Dunbar's panic-stricken camp about sunrise.</p>
                  <p>Washington stated, moreover, "that he had taken care of the wounded General,
                     having him carefully carried in a tumbril, and that he buried Braddock in the
                     middle of the road, making the horses and wagons pass over it, to conceal the
                     place from the Indians, <emph>designing</emph> at some future day to
                        <emph>erect a monument to his memory,</emph> which he had no opportunity of
                     doing, till after the Revolutionary War, <emph>when he made diligent search for
                        the grave, but the road had been so much turned and the clear land so
                        extended, that it could not be found.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>This is a passage exceedingly creditable to Washington's heart. Gratitude is a
                     very rare virtue, and that he should thus endeavor to pay back on the dying and
                     deserted old General, the kindness and attention he himself had but a short
                     time before received from him, and that he should be so anxious to show respect
                     to a brave, but unfortunate and foully-aspersed soldier, as to hunt for
                     Braddock's neglected grave after a long and bitter war with that General's
                     countrymen, is something of which an American can well be proud.</p>
                  <p>We have stated in our story how it has remained to Pittsburghers of <emph>the
                        present day</emph> to rescue this neglected grave from total neglect. This
                     monument will, we trust, <emph>yet be erected. It is not an American, but a
                        British duty.</emph> Braddock's battle-field, hard by which lies the dust of
                     so many English soldiers, should also have its appropriate monument.</p>

                  <head type="sub">COLONEL JAMES SMITH'S ACCOUNT QF THE TORTURE.</head>
                  <p>The scene which we have described as presenting itself to Talbot and Smith on
                     the evening of the great battle, is pretty fully taken from the published
                     narrative of the latter. As stated, Smith was the only English-speaking white
                     man who witnessed the French and Indian departure for the battle-field, the
                     return of the conquerors, and the subsequent torture of the prisoners, and
                     there is not the slightest reason to doubt his veracity. We quote his own
                     words: "I had observed some of the old country soldiers speak Dutch; as I spoke
                     Dutch, I went to one of them and asked him what was the news. He told me that a
                     runner had just arrived, who said that Braddock would certainly be defeated;
                     that the Indians and French had surrounded him, and were concealed behind
                     trees, and in gullies, and kept up a constant fire on the English, and that
                     they saw the English falling in heaps, and if they did not take the river,
                     which was the only gap, and make their escape, there would not be one man left
                     alive before sundown. Some time after this, I heard a number of scalp halloos
                     and saw a Company of Indians and French coming in. I observed they had a great
                     many bloody scalps, Grenadiers' caps, British, canteens, bayonets, etc., with
                     them. They brought the news that Braddock was defeated. After that another
                     Company came in, which appeared to be about one hundred, and chiefly Indians,
                     and it seemed to me that almost every one of this Company was carrying scalps;
                     after this came another Company with a number of wagon horses, and also a great
                     many scalps. Those that were coming in, and those that had arrived kept a
                     constant firing of small arms, and also the great guns in the fort, which were
                     accompanied with the most hideous shouts and yells from all quarters; so that
                     it appeared to me as if the infernal regions had broke loose.</p>
                  <p>"About sundown I beheld a small party coming in with about a dozen prisoners
                     stripped naked, with their hands tied behind their backs, and their faces and
                     part of their bodies blackened;—these prisoners they burned to death on the
                     hank of the Allegheny river, opposite to the fort. I stood on the fort wall
                     until I beheld them begin to burn one of these men; they had him tied to a
                     stake, and kept touching him with firebrands, red-hot irons, etc., and he
                     screaming in the most doleful manner—the Indians, in the meantime, yelling like
                     infernal spirits. As this scene appeared too shocking for me to behold, I
                     retired to my lodgings both sore and sorry."</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE INDIAN CUSTOM OF ADOPTION.</head>
                  <p>No strange custom among the American Indians seems so universally established,
                     or so well-attested, as that of the adoption into their tribes and families of
                     those captured in war, or on their various forays, and of the subsequent kind
                     and impartial treatment received. They appear absolutely to make no difference
                     between them and their own<pb n="498-499" xml:id="VAC7175-00000257"/> kith and
                     kin. The formal ceremony of adoption is observed with solemnity. The one Talbot
                     is made to go through, including the speeches, and the washing by young squaws
                     in the river, was borrowed from the actual experience of Colonel James Smith,
                     noticed elsewhere. American border annals abound in instances of the adoption
                     of both children and grown people of both sexes, and of their restoration to
                     friends and relatives after many years of separation. Some become such complete
                     Indians, or form such strong attachments to their new relatives, that they
                     refuse to quit them.</p>
                  <p>We have, elsewhere, recounted Colonel Henry Bouquet's victory over the Indians
                     at Bushy Run. The next year he made a highly successful campaign against the
                     Ohio Indians, which resulted in the return of over three hundred captives to
                     their homes. A large number of these had been adopted, and we cannot better
                     illustrate our subject than by showing their behaviour. Many had become
                     completely attached to their habits of life, and returned to their settlements
                     with great reluctance. The scene when the captives were brought to Bouquet's
                     camp, and delivered up, is said by those who witnessed it to have been
                     exceedingly touching and affecting. The Indians used every possible device,
                     first to avoid, and then to delay this delivery, but Bouquet made it a <foreign
                        xml:lang="LAT">sine qua non;</foreign> they shed torrents of tears,
                     earnestly and most affectionately commending these adopted relatives to the
                     care and protection of the officers. So long as they remained in camp the
                     Indians visited them from day to day; and brought them skins, horses, corn, and
                     many rich presents as tokens of their sincere and tender affection.</p>
                  <p>Not only this, but when Bouquet's army took up its backward march, some of the
                     Indians solicited and obtained leave to accompany their former captives all the
                     way to Fort Pitt, and employed themselves in hunting and bringing provisions
                     for them on the road. A young Mingo carried this still further, and gave an
                     instance of constant devotion, which is well worthy of honorable mention. He
                     had formed so strong an attachment to a young Virginia captive as to call her
                     his wife against all remonstrances of the imminent danger he exposed himself to
                     by approaching the frontiers, where the rude and lawless pioneers were
                     exceedingly hostile to all Indians; he persisted in following her far beyond
                     the border, and at the risk of being killed by the relations of those who had
                     been captured or scalped by those of his nation.</p>
                  <p>Some grown persons who had lived long with the Indians, had become so much
                     attached to them that the Shawnees were obliged to bind several of them and
                     force them along to camp. Some women who had been delivered up, afterwards
                     found means to escape and run back to the Indian towns, while others, who could
                     not make their escape, clung to their tawny acquaintances at parting, and
                     continued many days in bitter lamentations, even refusing all food. These
                     undoubted facts challenge our esteem, and shed honor upon the Indian character.
                     It is generally admitted that those they adopt are treated exactly like their
                     own relatives. No difference in food, raiment, or treatment.</p>

                  <p>After the burial of the two Halket skeletons, the remains of four hundred
                     soldiers were gathered together arid deposited in a large, shallow low pit near
                     by. But the work must have been very imperfectly do, since, in 1776, at the
                     time Justice Yeates visited the battle-field (see farther on), he saw numerous
                     skulls, and skeletons (in many instances mere <foreign xml:lang="LAT">disjecta
                        membra</foreign>) lying all over the ground. About twenty years ago, some
                     laborers, engaged on a cutting for the Pennsylvania Central R. R. (which road
                     now skirts, and in some places divides, the battle-ground), came upon a mass of
                     these buried remains, and the discovery therewith of some hundreds of British
                     guineas created a great excitement at the time and much profitless search for
                     more.</p>
                  <p>This visit to Braddock's Field, and the gathering together and burial of the
                     skeletons found therein, has been appropriately likened by Pittsburgh's
                     historian, Neville B. Craig, to a somewhat similar event of old classic times,
                     and of which the Latin historian, Tacitus, gives a touching and deeply
                     interesting account. We can only very briefly refer to it.</p>
                  <p>In the year 9 of the Christian era, Varus, with an army of three legions and
                     some cohorts, was induced by treacherous advisers to penetrate far into the
                     territory of the Bructeri, Germany. Having advanced for many days through thick
                     forests, they found themselves in a deep, sombre valley, where they were beset
                     by German foes, and badly defeated after a desperate struggle lasting for three
                     whole days. Varus himself dared not survive his disgrace, but killed himself
                     with his own sword.</p>
                  <p>Some time afterwards another Roman army, under the celebrated Germanicus, found
                     itself victor in the same country, and while pursuing the fugitive Germans came
                     upon the forest of Tentobrugium, in which Varus had been defeated, and where
                     lay the unburied remains of the massacred legions. "Touched by this affecting
                     circumstance," writes Tacitus, "Germanicus resolved to pay the last human
                     offices to the relies of that unfortunate Commander, and his slaughtered
                     soldiers. The same tender sentiment diffused itself through the army; some felt
                     the touch of nature for their relatives; others for their friends. The army
                     marched through a gloomy solitude. The first camp of Varus appeared in view.
                     Further on were traced the ruins of a rampart, and the hollow of a ditch well
                     nigh filled up. This was supposed to be the spot where the few who escaped the
                     general massacre made their last effort and perished in the attempt. The plains
                     around were white with bones; in some places thinly scattered; in others lying
                     in heaps, as the men happened to fall in flight, or in a body resisted to the
                     last. Fragments of javelins and limbs of horses lay scattered in the field.
                     Human skulls were seen upon the trunks of trees. In the adjacent woods stood
                     the savage altars, where the tribunes and principal centurions were offered up
                     a sacrifice with barbarous rites.</p>
                  <p>"Some of the soldiers who survived that dreadful day, and afterwards broke
                     their chains, related the particulars. 'Here the Commanders of the legions were
                     put to the sword; on that spot the eagles were seized; there Varus received his
                     first wound; and this is the place where he gave himself the mortal stab, and
                     died by his own sword. Yonder mound was the tribunal from which Arminius
                     harangued his countrymen; here he fixed his gibbets; there he dug the funeral
                     trenches, and in that quarter he offered every mark of scorn and insolence to
                     the colors and the Roman Eagles.'</p>
                  <p>"Six years had elapsed since the overthrow of Varus; and now, on the same spot,
                     the Roman army collected the bones of their slaughtered countrymen,—whether
                     they were burying the remains of<pb n="500-501" xml:id="VAC7175-00000258"/>
                     strangers or of their own friends, no man knew. All, however, considered
                     themselves as performing the last obsequies to their kindred and their brother
                     soldiers. While employed in this pious office, their hearts were torn with
                     contending passions; by turns oppressed with grief and burning for revenge. A
                     monument to the memory of the dead was raised with turf. Germanicus, with his
                     own hand, laid the first sod."</p>

                     <head>BRADDOCK'S FIELDS IN THESE MODERN TIMES.</head>
                     <p>Judge Yeates paid a visit to Braddock's Field in 1776, and even then, more
                        than twenty years after the battle, saw many striking signs of the desperate
                        conflict. Skeletons unburied, huge limbs cut off by the cannon ball, and the
                        trunks and branches of those yet thickly standing marked and scarred for
                        thirty feet up with ball and grape. He writes: "My feelings were heightened
                        by the warm and glowing narrative of that day's events by Dr. Walker, who
                        was an eye witness. He pointed out the ford where the army crossed the
                        Monongahela (below Turtle Creek, eight hundred yards). A finer sight could
                        not have been beheld; the shining barrels of the muskets; the excellent
                        order of the men; the cleanliness of their apparel; the joy depicted upon
                        every face at being so near Fort Duquesne, the highest object of their
                        wishes. The music re-echoed through the mountains; how brilliant the
                        morning; how melancholy the evening."</p>
                     <p>That unhappy field was witness long after to another strange and startling
                        scene. It was on Friday, August 1st, 1794, and during the height of the
                        Western Insurrection—generally known as the "whiskey rebellion"—that many
                        thousand armed men assembled by expresses sent through the four counties
                        involved, under penalty of having their property destroyed if they absented
                        themselves. A Pittsburgh delegation was there, urged by the threat that as
                        they harbored the chief opponents to the insurrection, they must appear on
                        the ground to assert their adherence to it, or their town would be burned
                        down about their ears. The motives which gathered this multitude were
                        varied. Many came from fear; many from curiosity; many were deceived into
                        the belief that it was a simple militia muster, and all seemed confused as
                        to what were best to be done.</p>
                     <p>The day was spent in eating, drinking, and smoking. At night the fires were
                        lighted, and groups of men chatted, sung, gamed, or earnestly discussed
                        under the trees. David Bradford, mounted on a superb horse, with splendid
                        trappings, and arrayed in full martial uniform, with plumes floating, and
                        sword drawn, acted as Major-General to this remarkable and heterogeneous
                        collection of countrymen. The good people of Pittsburgh were greatly alarmed
                        at the threats and rumors carried to their ears that an attack was to be
                        made on their fort, and their town destroyed. Goods were packed, houses
                        abandoned, guards stationed, and the whole town was in a state of terrible
                        commotion and dismay, but happily, peaceful counsels, under the politic
                        advice and entreaties of leaders, prevailed, and it was agreed that the
                        insurgents should simply march through the place to impress and overawe the
                        citizens, and should then cross the Monongahela and disperse.</p>
                     <p>The procession, said to be about two and a half miles long, and to number
                        between five and six thousand persons, entered the town about noon of
                        Saturday, all in file and in good order. The guns of the fort were loaded,
                        and the little garrison of two hundred and fifty soldiers drawn up, prepared
                        to give the insurgents a hot reception should they venture an attack, but
                        they prudently gave the fort a wide berth, and after marching through the
                        main street, and being helped liberally to whiskey by the frightened
                        citizens, they noisily crossed the Monongahela in boats about nightfall, and
                        gradually dispersed; but not until the most reckless or drunken of their
                        number had fired the barns and stacks of Colonel Kirkpatrick, located on the
                        top of Coal Hill, and near by the spot where we have located the first scene
                        of our tale. The flames cast a lurid glare over the little town and
                        surrounding country, but fortunately this was the extent of the mischief
                        done, and then this strange impromptu army scattered to their various homes.
                        Although this vast assemblage gave weight and impetus to the insurrection,
                        yet it was soon after completely suppressed, and without bloodshed.</p>
                     <p>Since that troublous time, Braddock's Fields have been left to the peaceful
                        labors of the husbandman, and waving fields of rich grain have year after
                        year occupied that "dark and bloody ground." Many is the bullet or
                        grape-shot we have gathered on that fatal plain; It is now staked off, and
                        will soon be completely covered with the elegant mansions of Pittsburgh
                        merchants, and no monument is yet erected to announce to a curious public
                        the exact locality of this important battle and disastrous defeat.
                        Pittsburgh should bestir itself in this matter.</p>

            <p>PURE, BRIGHT, CHEERY, AND WHOLESOME.</p>
            <p>THE <title>Peoples Monthly</title> grew out of a widely-felt want for a
                  <emph>pure,</emph> wholesome, and attractive Illustrated paper for the
                  <emph>family.</emph> It is now in its third year, and its ever-increasing
               popularity is due to the fact that it is suited to the <emph>people;</emph> is full
               of pleasant, original matter, <emph>practical</emph> information, home and local
               Illustrations. Its circulation is now increasing at the rate of <emph>one hundred per
                  day.</emph>
            </p>
            <p>Its publishers had faith in the virtue and goodness of our western folk—and
               especially in the <emph>family</emph> portion of it—that they would prefer for their
               homes what was <emph>pure,</emph> moral, and <emph>wholesome,</emph> to the indecent
               and licentious illustrated trash of the day, which actually floods the country,
               debauching to an incredible extent the minds and corrupting the morals of the youth
               of <emph>both</emph> sexes. <emph>They were right,</emph> and very rapidly increasing
               issues <emph>prove</emph> that they are supplying a popular want. It is welcome to
               the homes of all who have examined it; is universally praised for its beauty, merit,
               interest, and purity, by the religious and the secular press, both at home and
               abroad, and is now worked off on tinted paper, but at no extra charge.</p>
            <p>In a word, it is for the <emph>people;</emph> only $1.50 per year, or $2.00, with
               Chromo, sized, varnished, and mounted, leaving but a <emph>very</emph> small margin
               of profit, as can be readily seen when the originality of contents, variety of
               first-class contributions, profusion of cuts, quality of paper, and excellency of
               typography are considered. <emph>Nothing coarse, common, or shabby about it.</emph>

            <p>The fact that we have now on our list over <emph>one thousand Christian

               <p>ELEGANT and attractive as the "Peoples Monthly" confessedly is, it can be had for
                     <emph>nothing</emph>—yes, for <emph>less</emph> than nothing—since every new
                  subscriber or renewer gets with it a magnificent Chromo worth, at least,
                     <emph>three times the subscription price.</emph> We are now using, and give a
                  choice between, a beautiful fruit piece (15 X 17 in.), and our new and universally
                  admired "Pet" (16 X 20 in.), an unusually large and remarkably fine Chromo.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Either</emph> of these pictures surpasses in beauty and richness any
                     <emph>ever yet given by any paper.</emph> We have, at great expense, bought the

                  already received it at our hands have been delighted, and we could fill pages with
                  their unsolicited testimonials. It is a much too expensive Chromo for us to
                  present, but we were determined to avoid the shabby, worthless daubs now so common
                  as premiums, and to give either good, valuable pictures, or none.</p>
