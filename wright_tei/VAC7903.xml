that may well be called voluptuous, and a face (shaded by masses&#xD;
of raven hair) which, with its clear brown complexion, large hazel&#xD;
eyes, and arching brows, tells the story of my descent on my,&#xD;
mother's side,-she was a WestTidian, and there is Spanish blood&#xD;
in my veins. My acquaintance wth Eugene ripened into warm&#xD;
as&amp;amp;3passionate love; and one day my father surprised me as I&#xD;
upon -ry lover's breast, and ;instead of chiding us, said with&#xD;
aof unmistakeable satisfaction:&#xD;
x R1ght" Eugene ! You have won my daughter's love. When&#xD;
ayou return from the West aies you shall be married. And once&#xD;
married, instead of my head clerk you shall be my partner."&#xD;
father was a venerable man, with a kindlysface and snow-&#xD;
,  hte hair : as, he spoke, the tears ran down his cheeks, for (as I&#xD;
awards ascertained) my marriage with Eugene, the orphan&#xD;
of he dearest friends of his boyhood, had been the mos&#xD;
e of his life for years&#xD;
{.left for Havana, intrusted with an important and secret&#xD;
Uaion from my father. He was to be absent;only a month.&#xD;
as it on the day of his departure, as le strained me to&#xD;
 reasstand covered my face with his passionate kisses, that a 4rk&#xD;
presentment chilled my blood? 0, had he never left my side what&#xD;
oid   f agony, of despair,-yes, of crime,-would have ,been&#xD;
tspred to me!&#xD;
"e true to me, Nell," these were his last words,-"In a&#xD;
'£ 'wll return.":&#xD;
14True to you! Can you doubt it, Eugene?  True until death&#xD;
And we parted.&#xD;
as once more alone in my father's splendid mansion. One&#xD;
evemig he-came home, but not with his usual kindly smile.  'e&#xD;
was pale and troubled, and seemed to avoid my gaze. Without&#xD;
S trin the sitting room, he went at once to his library ad looked&#xD;
ikelfin, having first directed the servant to ca   n i eea&#xD;
, Mr. Morton inquired for 'him. It was after .eigYl he Mr*r-&#xD;
,  or called and was shown into the parlour, while the erva&#xD;
toannounce him to my father.&#xD;
"Misis Ellen, I believe " he said, as he beheld me by thefight&#xD;
  e astral lamp,-and then a singular look passed over hisface&#xD;
'r c hich at that time I could not;define, but whicler&#xD;
ae 'terribly clear to me. This Mr.Morton, who th  Ft&#xD;
A ,~3 time entei-ed my father's house, was by. no mean8 preysA&#xD;
g nhis exterior. Over fifty years, corpulent in form;bald-&#xD;

While, Iwas taking a survey of this singular visitor, the servant&#xD;
entered the parlour,-- Mr. Morton will please walk up into the&#xD;
library," he said.&#xD;
"Good night, dear," said Mr. Morton with a bow and a gesture&#xD;
that had as muck  insolence as of politeness in it,-" Bye-bye,-&#xD;
we'll meet, aga :'&#xD;
am.&#xD;
le went up stairs, and my father and he were closeted together&#xD;
for at least two hours.." At ten o'clock I was sent for. I entered&#xD;
the library, trembling I knew not why; and found my father and&#xD;
Mr. Morton seated on opposite, sides of a table overspread with&#xD;
rpers,-a hanging lamp, suspended over the table, gave hght to&#xD;
scene. My father was deathly pale.&#xD;
cMSt down, Nell," he said in a voice so broken and chased,&#xD;
that would not have recognised it, had I not seen his face: oms.&#xD;
Morton has something to say to you."&#xD;
"Mr. Morton1" I ejaculated; "What can he have to say to.&#xD;
cSpeak to her,--speak, said my father, "speak for I&#xD;
and resting his hands on the table, his head drooped on hisbe&#xD;
" Sit down, my dear," exclaimed Morton, in a tone&#xD;
familiarity; "I have a little matter of business with your father.&#xD;
There's no use of mincing words. Your father, my dear, isa&#xD;
ruined man."&#xD;
I/sank into a chair, and my fathe  groan confirmed Morton's&#xD;
'opelessly involved," continued Mr. Morton. "cUnless heca&#xD;
three hundred thousand dollars by to-morrow noon, he i a&#xD;
d s     poured man. Do you hear me, my dear?  Dishonoured !"&#xD;
TDhshonoured 1" groaned my father, buryng his head in h&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
."cAnd more than this, continued Morton, "your fath  ?inog&#xD;
his many meroantie speculations, has dabble a, little-ye-, mr&#xD;
than a little-in the African slave trade. He has rel ti  5      -41&#xD;
eertan gentlemen at Havana, which, once known to our&#xD;
ment, would consign him to the convict's cell."&#xD;
The words of this man filled me with indignation and with.h r"_ ;F&#xD;
Half fainting as I was, I felt the blood boil i my veins.&#xD;
"Father, rebuke this har," I said, aS I placed myband , 0i.&#xD;
shoulder; "raise your face, and tell hin that he is thAe&#xD;
falsehood as atrocious as it is foolish."&#xD;
My father did not reply.&#xD;
"And more than this, Morton went on .as though le h&#xD;
beard me, "I have it in my power, either to relievey i1Ya 'r&#xD;
from is financial embarrassments, or,"-he pause~an~u4~&#xD;

My father's mind Was broken, and froi that hou he SUrre dered&#xD;
himself to Morton's control. Mort6 took charge of his: bu e&#xD;
made our house 1 home-he was my father's master and mine.&#xD;
The course which he pursued to blunt my feelings and deadeh etel7&#xD;
faculty of my better nature, by rousigwall that was sensual within&#xD;
me, was worthy of him. lie gave parties at our home, to the pro.&#xD;
fligate of both sexes, selected from a -certain class of 'the so-caild&#xD;
" fashionable" of New York. Revels prolonged from midnight&#xD;
until dawn, disturbed the quiet of our mansion; and in the winf-&#xD;
cup and amid the excitement of these fashionable but unholy orgie,&#xD;
I soon learned to forget the pure hopes  of my naidenhood. Thre&#xD;
months passed, and no word of Eugene. My father meanwhile if&#xD;
sinking deeper every day into hopeless 'imbecility. Atilength _th:&#xD;
early part of summer, my husband gathered together ap ity tf bib&#xD;
fashionable friends, and we departed on a tour to Niagara: a1M,&#xD;
the lakes, then along the St. Lawrence, and to Montreal."it&#xD;
Niagara Falls we pit up at the -- Hotel, and the orgieswAhiek&#xD;
had disgraced my father's mansion were again resumed. My fafier&#xD;
we had left at home in charge of a well-tried and faithful ervant.&#xD;
One summer evening, tired of the scenes which took placer  r&#xD;
parlours, at 'the Hotel, I put on a bonnet and =veil and alone pbz-&#xD;
e4 uy way across the bridge to Goat Island, and from Goat to&#xD;
'd. The night was beautiful; from- a clear sky the moe&#xD;
elton     the falls - and the roar of waters alone dist rbE41he&#xD;
silence Othe scene. Crossing the narrow bridge, which er  s&#xD;
Goat Island from Luna Island, I took my way'through the deep&#xD;
shadows of the thicket, until I emerged in 'the inoonlight, uponte&#xD;
'verge of the Falls.  Leaning against a small beech te 4hich&#xD;
stati&amp;amp; there, I clasped my hands upon my bosom ind wept. That&#xD;
scene, full of the grandeur and purity of nature, awoke the tmao&#xD;
of my pure and happier days.&#xD;
u One plunge 'and all is o er!" the thought-lshed over me&#xD;
I Measured with 'a rapid glance the distance between myelf _n&#xD;
the brink of the cataract. But at this moment I discovered thatX&#xD;
ras not alone upon Luna Island. A stranger was leanin&#xD;
,a tree which was nearer to the brink of'the talls than th&#xD;
against which I leaned. His face was in profle, the lower part&#xD;
it, covered with a thick moustache and beard; and his game'r s&#xD;
lifted absently to the moonlight sky. As I dropped my ve oAr&#xD;
my face, and'gazed at him freely, myself unpereived, I felt my&#xD;
limbs bend beneath me, and the blood rush in a teetoeyJ4&#xD;

fainting on his heart.&#xD;
When ILfecovered my onseiousness, I found myself resting in&#xD;
lii arms, awhile he covered my face with burning kisses.&#xD;
"You here, Eleanor !" he cried. "This is indeed an unexpected&#xD;
pleasure!!"&#xD;
uHe had not heard of my marriage!I&#xD;
"I an hierei.-with some friends," I faltered. "QMy father could&#xD;
hot come with me, and"---&#xD;
Betweeru the kisses which he planted upon the lips of his be .&#xD;

: tiipated,had left Vera Crus for New Orleans, taken steamboat&#xD;
ro{Cincinnati, and from thence to Cleveland, and across the Lake&#xD;

ileanor," he concluded. "What a pleasant surprise it will be for&#xD;
father!"&#xD;
aI am married, Eugene !" the words were on my lips, but I could&#xD;
yet speak them. We rose and, arm in arm, wandered over the&#xD;
4.idge up the steep and through the winding walks of Goat Island.&#xD;
y"ening o' AbJd e arm of Eugene, I forgot everything but\that e&#xD;
loed met and that he was with me. I did not dare o thit&#xD;
~tmorrow's light would disclose to him, the truth,-.that  ws&#xD;
ascied, and to another. At length as we approached thebridge,&#xD;
r.^        which leads from the island to the shore, I said, "Leave me,&#xD;
Eugene. , We must not be seen to return together. To-morrow&#xD;
youan call upon me, when I am in presence of my--friends."&#xD;
One passionate embrace was exchanged; and I watched him, as&#xD;
,rossed the bridge alone-,until he was out of sight. Why, I&#xD;
;not, but -n impulse for which I could not account, induced&#xD;
me to retrace my steps to Luna Island. In .a few moment had&#xD;
k}:y ssed the bridge (connecting Goat with Luna Island), and stood&#xD;
once more on the cataract's brink, under the same tree, where an&#xD;

few feet from .the verge of the cataract Where the waters look&#xD;
.smooth a4id glassy, as they are about to take the last plunge, he&#xD;
stood gazing: now at the torrent, now at the moon, with .a vague&#xD;
half-drunken stare.&#xD;
2Thatimomen decided my life !&#xD;
His attitude, the cataract so near, my own lost and hopeless&#xD;
condition; all rushed upon me. Veiling my face,,I darted forward&#xD;
and uttered a shriek. Startled by the unexpected sound, he turned,&#xD;
lost his balance, and fell backwards into the torrent. But as he&#xD;
'fell; he clutched'abranch which 'overhung: the water. Thus, scarerely&#xD;
two yards from the brink, he struggled madly for his life, his face&#xD;
upturned to the moon. I advanced and uncovered my face. He&#xD;
knew ,me, for the shock had sobered him.&#xD;
"Eleanor, save me--save me !" he cied.&#xD;
I gazed upon him without a word, my arms folded on my breast,&#xD;
and saw him struggle, and heard the branch snap, and, heard his&#xD;
death'howl as: he was swept over the falls. Then, pale as death,&#xD;
and shuddering as with mortal cold, I dragged my steps from the&#xD;
island, "over the bridge, shrieking madly for help. Soon I heard&#xD;
footsitefpand voices. "Help ! help;!" I shrieked, as ,I was. sur-&#xD;
ouide by a group of faces, men and women,---"My husband i&#xD;
My husband ! The falls F" and sank fainting in their midst;&#xD;
Morning came, and no suspicion attached to me. A murderess,&#xD;
if not in deed, in thought certainly, I was looked upon as the in-&#xD;
consolable widow. Eugene left Niagara without seeing me. How&#xD;
did ha regard me? .I could diot tell. The death of. Morton broke&#xD;
up our' travelling party, and we returned to New York. I returned V&#xD;
'in time to attend my father's funeral, and-found myself theheiress,&#xD;
in my own right, of there9 hundred thousand dollars., An heiress&#xD;
and a widow, certainly life 'began to brighten  Morton removed,&#xD;
the incubus which sat upon myfather'srwealth "was gone; and I&#xD;
was beautiful and free, and--rich, immensely rich.,&#xD;
But where was Eugene? ,Months.p assed, and I did not see him.&#xD;
As he was the head clerk:of my father; I hoped toA see *him, in com-&#xD;
pany with the legal gentlemen engaged in-closing .up my father's&#xD;
estate.: But he settled his accounts, closed all connexion withmy&#xD;
father's estate' and business, but did not come near me. At length,&#xD;
weary of suspense and heart-sick of the loneliness of my desolate&#xD;
mansion, I wrote to him, begging A  interview. He called.in the&#xD;
-dusk of the evening, when a siagg handlee lighted up the spaciow.&#xD;

"Az&amp;amp;    , yoU wishedeto see me," he began.&#xD;
His eold and formalhmanner 4ut mne-to the heart.&#xD;
SEtggsee!" I oried, and flung myself :upon his breast, and pas-&#xD;
sion:tely, but in broken accents, told him how my father's antioi&#xD;
pated ruin had forced me to marry Morton.&#xD;
Eugene was melted-"-    Eleanor! Eleanor! I love you, and&#xD;
Ya ay sshall love you, but-but---"&#xD;
He paused: in an agony of suspense I hungupon his word*-&#xD;
'Butyou are so rich, and I-I---am poor"&#xD;
I drowned all further words with kisses, and in a moment we&#xD;
.,ere retrot1hed again.&#xD;
We were married. Eugene was the master of my fortune,  y&#xD;
person, and my future. We lived happily together,'eontent with&#xD;
eac other'e society, and seeking in the endearments of a pure&#xD;
marriage to blot out the 'memory of an unholy one. My husband,&#xD;
truly Miy husband, was 'all that I could desire; and by me, he&#xD;
became the possessor of a princely revenue, free to gratify his taste&#xD;
or all that is -beautiful in the arts-in painting andraslpture-&#xD;
,ithu hindrance or, control. Devoted to me, always     eag&#xD;
togratify my slightest wish, Eugene was all that I' coul  n&#xD;
e lived to ourselves, and fbrforthe miserable mocke'_rkaled&#xD;
the fashionable world," into whioh  Morton had intreduoe me-.&#xD;
Thus a year passed away, and present happiness banishd' the&#xD;
inmemory of a gloomy past. After a year, Eugene began to have&#xD;
important engagements, on pressing business, in Philadolphia,&#xD;
Boston, :Baltimore, and Washington. His 'absence was death to&#xD;
'e, but having full confidence in him, and aware that his business&#xD;
austbe of vital imortance-or assuredly he would not leavk me- --&#xD;
saw him 'depart, time aid again, with grief too deep for words;&#xD;
id always hailed his 'return-the very echo of his step-with a&#xD;
joy as deep. On one occasion, when he left me, for a day, on a&#xD;
'business visit to'Philadelphia, I determined, I scarcely knew why,&#xD;
to follow him, 'and greet him, on his arrival in Philadelphia, with&#xD;
'thieunepected but welcome surprise of my presence. Clothing&#xD;
'myself in black-black velvet bonnet, and tlack velvet mantilla,&#xD;
and with a dark veil over my face--I followed him to the ferry-.&#xD;
boat, crossed to Jersey City, and took my seat near him in the&#xD;
e.s. We 'arrived in Philadelphia late at night. To my surprise&#xD;
'1e did not put up at one of the prominent hotels, but benit his way&#xD;

esjecially desired him tQ meet tme here--"&#xD;
Thesewords seemed to resolve her doubts.' She motioned me to&#xD;
enter,'and we'passed into a&amp;amp;small room; neatly furnished, with the&#xD;
light, which came through the curtained windows, shining upon a&#xD;
picture--the portrait of Eugene Burton, my husband.&#xD;
"Capital likeness of Crawfurd ?" I said, carelessly tapping my&#xD;
switch against my boot.&#xD;
"Yes-yes"-she replied, as she took a seat at the opposite end&#xD;
of the sofa, "but not so handsome."&#xD;
In the course of' two hours, in which with a maddened pulse,&#xD;
and heaving breast, I waited for the appearance of my husband, I&#xD;
learned from the young girl the following facts: She was a poor&#xD;
grl, and her mother with whom she lived, a widow in very moderate&#xD;
M eustances. Her name was Ada Bulwer. Mr. Lawrence Craw-&#xD;
d (this of course was the assumed name of my husband) was a&#xD;
wealthy gentleman of a noble heart--he had saved her life in a&#xD;
railroad accident, some months before. He had been unhappy&#xD;
however in marriage; wasnow divorced from a wicked and unfaith-&#xD;
ful woman; and-here was the climax-" And next week we are&#xD;
to be.married, and mother, Lawrence, and myself will proceed to&#xD;
Europe directly after our marriage."&#xD;
This was -Ada's story, which I heard with emotions ,ta aT&#xD;
scarcely be imagined. Every word planted a hell in my heart:&#xD;
At length, towards nightfall, a knock was heard, and Ada hastened&#xD;
tosthe door. Presently I heard my husband's step in the entry,&#xD;
and th n his voice--&#xD;
"_Dearest"-there was the sound of a kiss-" I have got rid of&#xD;
that infamous woman, who killed her first. husband, and have&#xD;
turned all my property into ready money. On Monday we start&#xD;
for Europe."&#xD;
ilHeentered, and as he entered I glided behind the door. Thus&#xD;
his back was towards me, while his face was towards Ada, and his&#xD;
arms about her waist.&#xD;
"On Monday, dearest, we will be married, and then--"&#xD;
I was white with rage, but calm as death. Drawing the poignard&#xD;
(which;Ihad never parted with since I first procured it), I advance&#xD;
and struck him, once, twice, thrice in the back. He neverabeheld&#xD;
me, but fellFupon Ada's breast, bathed in blood. She uttered a&#xD;
shriek,-but laying my hand upon her shoulder, I said sternly. :&#xD;

"Surely," he said, fixing his ,gaze earnestly upon me, and his&#xD;
Fords seemed to be forced from him, even against his will, a"surely&#xD;
one so beautiful and so good, cannot have anything like -sin upon&#xD;
her soul."&#xD;
Our gaz. met, and from that ,moment, we talked of everything&#xD;
but the case of conscience. All his restraint vanished. His eye&#xD;
flashed, his voice rolled deep'and full; he was eloquent, and he&#xD;
was at home. We seemed to. have been acquainted' for years. We&#xD;
talked of history, poetry, the beautiful in nature, the wonderful in.&#xD;
art; a.ad we talked without effort, as though our minds mingled&#xD;
together, without even the aid of voice and eyes. Time sped doise-+&#xD;
essly-it was twelve o'clock before we thought it nine. *H  os&#xD;
"all do myself ,the pleasure to call again," he said, and his&#xD;
oeg'faltered.&#xD;
' extended my hand. His hand met it in a gentle pressure.&#xD;
That touch decided our fate. As though my very being andhis&#xD;
had rushed together and melted into one, in that slight pressure;of&#xD;
hand to hand, we stood silent and confused, one felling in our g e&#xD;
blushing and pale by turns.&#xD;

head with kisses. Pale, half fainting, he lay almost helplessly&#xD;

will watch over you as you ascend, step by step, the difficuItteep&#xD;

It was the first time that"young Lirow had trembled to awoman'0&#xD;

with a passionate warmth. I felt a strange interest in the beauti-&#xD;
ful boy: a feeling compounded of pure love, of passion, of voluptu-&#xD;
ousness, the most intense and refined.&#xD;
" 0, Eleanor, do you not think that if I act aright in all other&#xD;
respects, that this one sin will be forgiven me?" said Herbert, as&#xD;
one sabbath evening, after the service was over, we sat side, by side,&#xD;
in my home., It was in a quiet room, the curtain down, a light&#xD;
shining in front of a mirror, and a couch dimly seen through the&#xD;
shadows of an alcove.&#xD;
" One'sin?  What mean you, Herbert ?"&#xD;
" The sin of loving you," and he blushed as his earnest gaze met&#xD;
mine.,&#xD;
"inAnd is it a sin to love me ?"' I answered in a lo voice, suffer-&#xD;
ing my hapd to rest upon his forehead.&#xD;
"Yes !" he stammered, to love you thus unlawfully."&#xD;
"Why unlawfully ?"&#xD;
le buried his head on my breast, as he replied-" I love you as&#xD;
a husband, and I am not your husband.'&#xD;
" And why," I exclaimed, seizing him in my arms and gently&#xD;
raising his head, so that our gaze met, " and why can you not be&#xD;
my husband?   I am rich ; you have genius. My wealth-enough&#xD;
for us both-shall be linked with your genius, and both shall the&#xD;
more firmly cement our love. Say, Herbert, why can you not be&#xD;
my husband?"&#xD;
He turned pale and avoided my gaze.S&#xD;
" You are ashamed of me-ashamed, because I have given you&#xD;
the last proof which a woman can give to the man she loves."&#xD;
" Ashamed !  0, no-no-by all- that is sacred, no ! But,&#xD;
Eleanor-"&#xD;
And bending nearer to me, in faltering accents he whispered the&#xD;
secret to my ears. He was betrothed to Mary Somers, daughter&#xD;
of the wealtiest and most influential member of' his congregation.&#xD;
He had been betrothed long before he met me. To Mr. Somers,&#xD;
the father, he owed all that he had acquired in life, both in position&#xD;
and fame. That gentleman had taken him when a friendless orphan&#xD;
boy, had educated him, and after his ordination, had obtained for&#xD;
him the pastoral charge of his large and wealthy congregation.&#xD;
Thus he was bound to the father by every tie of gratitude ; to the&#xD;
daughter, by an engagement that he could not break without in-&#xD;
gratitude and disgrace. My heart died within me at this revela-&#xD;
tion. At once I saw that Herbert could never be lawfully mine.&#xD;
Between him and myself stood Mary Somers, and every tie of&#xD;
gratitude, every emotion of self-respect and honour.&#xD;

Not long after this interview, I saw Mary Somers at church,&#xD;
made the acquaintance of her father, a grave citizen, who regarded&#xD;
me as a sincere devotee, and induced Mary to become a frequent&#xD;
visitor at my house. Sherconfided all to me. She loved Herbert&#xD;
devotedly, and looked forward to their marriage as the most certain&#xD;
event in the world. She was a very pretty child, with clear blue&#xD;
eyes and brown hair, and a look of bewitching archness. I do not&#xD;
step aside from the truth, when I state that I sincerely loved her;&#xD;
although, it is also true, that I, never suffered myself to think of&#xD;
her marriage with Herbert, as anything but an impossible dream.&#xD;
An incident took place one summer evening-about a year after&#xD;
Herbert's first visit to my house-which, slight as it was, it is just&#xD;
as well to relate. It is such slight incidents which often decide&#xD;
the fate of a lifetime, and strike down the barrier between virtue&#xD;
and crime.&#xD;
I was sitting on the sofa at the back window of the parlour, and&#xD;
Mary sat on the stool at my feet. The light of the setting sun&#xD;
shone over my shoulders, and lighted up her face, as her clasped&#xD;
hands rested on my knees, and her happy guileless look was&#xD;
centred on my countenance. As I gazed upon that innocent face,&#xD;
full of youth and hope, I was reminded of my own early days, and&#xD;
at the memory, a tear rolled down my cheek.&#xD;
"Yes, you shall marry Herbert," the thought flashed over my&#xD;
mind, " and I will aid you, Mary-yes, I will resign Herbert to&#xD;
you."                                               f/&#xD;
At this moment Herbert entered noiselessly, and took his place&#xD;
by my shoulder, and, without a word, gazed first into my face and&#xD;
then into the face of Mary. 0, that look ! It was never forgotten.&#xD;
It Was fate. For it said, as plainly as a soul speaking through&#xD;
eyes can say--" Thou, Eleanor, art my mistress, the companion&#xD;
of my illicit and sensual love, but thou Mary, art my wife, the pure&#xD;
partner of my lawful love !"&#xD;
After that look, Herbert bade us good evening, in a tone of&#xD;
evident agitation, and hurried from the room.&#xD;
From that hour, Herbert avoided me. Weeks passed, and he&#xD;
was not seen at my house. At church he never seemed to be con-&#xD;
scious of my presence, and the service over, hurried at once from&#xD;
the place, 'without a single glance or sign of recognition. At&#xD;
length, Mary's visits became less frequent; and when she did come&#xD;
to see me, her manner manifested a conflict of confidence and sus-&#xD;
picion. That this wounded me, that the absence of Herbert cut&#xD;
me to the soul, will easily be imagined. I passed my time between&#xD;

26           CONFESSIONS OF ELEANOR BURTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
alternations of hope and despair, now listening-and in vain-for&#xD;
the echo of Herbert's step, and now bathed in unavailing tears.&#xD;
Conscious that my passion for Herbert was the last link that bound&#xD;
me to purity-to life itself-I did not give up the hope of seeing&#xD;
him at my feet, as in former days, until months had elapsed.&#xD;
Finally, grown desperate, and anxious to avoid the stings of&#xD;
wounded love, the perpetual presence of harrowing memories, I&#xD;
sought the society of that class of fashionables, to whom my first&#xD;
husband-Morton-had introduced me.     I kept open house for&#xD;
them.. Revels, from  midnight until dawn, in which men and&#xD;
women of the first class mingled, served for a time to banish re-&#xD;
flection, and sap, tie by tie, every thread of hope which held me to&#xD;
a purer state of life. The kennel has its orgies, and the hovel, in&#xD;
which ignorance and squalor join in their uncouth debauch ; but&#xD;
the orgies of the parlour, in which beauty, intellect, fashion, and&#xD;
refinement are mingled, far surpass, in unutterable vulgarity,&#xD;
the lowest orgies of the kennel. Amid the uproar of scenes like&#xD;
these, news reached me that the Rev..Herbert Lansing and Miss&#xD;
Mary Somers were shortly to be united in marriage.&#xD;
One evening I was sitting alone, in the back parlour, near a&#xD;
table on which stood a lighted .candle and a wineglass (for I now,&#xD;
at tines, began to seek oblivion in wine), when Mr. Dudley Haskins&#xD;
was announced. , Dudley was one of my fashionable friends, over&#xD;
forty in years, tall in stature, with a florid face, short curling&#xD;
brown hair, and sandy whiskers. He was a roue, and a gambler,&#xD;
and-save the mark-one of the first fashionables of New Yprk.&#xD;
Dudley entered, dressed in a showy style-blue coat, red velvet&#xD;
vest, plaid pants, brimstone coloured gloves, and a profusion of&#xD;
rings and other jewellery-a style indicative of the man. Seating&#xD;
himself on the sofa, he began chatting, in his easy way, about pass-&#xD;
ing events of fashionable life, and of the world at large.&#xD;
" By-the-bye, the popular preacher, young Lansing, is to be&#xD;
married-and to such a love of a girl-daughter of old Somers, the&#xD;
millionaire. Lucky fellow ! Do you know that I've often noticed&#xD;
her at church-a perfect Hebe-and followed her home, once or&#xD;
twice, and that I should not mind marrying her myself if I could&#xD;
get a chance."&#xD;
And he laughed a laugh, which showed his white teeth. "Bali!&#xD;
But that's it-I can't get a chance."&#xD;
Perhaps I blushed at the mention of this marriage, but he imme-&#xD;
diately continued--&#xD;
" On dit, my pretty widow, that this girl Somers has cut you&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
ont. Lansing once was sadly taken with you-so I've heard. How&#xD;
is it?_ All talk, I suppose ?"&#xD;
I felt myself growing pale, although the blood was boiling in my&#xD;
veins. But, before I could reply, there was a ring at the front&#xD;
door, followed by the sound of a hasty footstep, and the next&#xD;
moment, to my utter surprise, Mary Somers rushed into the room.&#xD;
Without seeming to notice the presence of Haskins, she rushed&#xD;
forward and fell on her knees before me, her bonnet hanging on&#xD;
her neck, her hair floating about her face, and that face bathed  in&#xD;
blushes and tears.&#xD;
"0, Eleanor ! Eleanor !" she gasped, "some slanderer has told&#xD;
father a story about you and Herbert-a vile wicked story-which&#xD;
you can refute, and which I am sure you will! For-for----"&#xD;
She fell fainting on my knee ; the violence of her emotions, for&#xD;
the time, deprived her of all appearance of life. Her head was on&#xD;
my lap, one hand sought mine, and'was joined to it in a convulsive&#xD;
clasp.&#xD;
0 ! who shall say, that those crimes which make the world&#xD;
shudder, but to hear told, are the result of long and skilful&#xD;
planning, of careful and intricate scheming? No-no-the worst&#xD;
crimes, those which it would seem might make even the heart of a&#xD;
devil contract with horror, are not the result of long and delibe-&#xD;
rate purpose, but of the temptation of a moment, of the fatal&#xD;
opportunity !&#xD;
As her head rested on'my lap, a voice whispered in my ear---&#xD;
"Your rival !-retire for a few moments in search of hartshorn&#xD;
or some such restorative-and leave the fainting one in my care."&#xD;
I raised my head and caught the eye of Haskins. Only a single&#xD;
look, and the fiend was in my heart. I rose-the fainting girl fell&#xD;
upon the floor-I hurried from the room, and did not pause, until&#xD;
I had reached my own chamber and locked the door. Pressing&#xD;
my hands now on my burning temples,-now on my breast, I paced&#xD;
the floor, while perchance fifteen minutes-they seemed an eternity&#xD;
-passed away.&#xD;
Then I went slowly down stairs and entered the back parlour.&#xD;
Haskins was there, standing near the sofa, his face wearing an in-&#xD;
solent scowl of triumph. The girl was stretched upon the sofa,&#xD;
still insensible, but-I dare not write it.  Opposite Haskins&#xD;
stood Herbert Lansing who had followed Mary to the house and&#xD;
arrived-too late. His face was bloodless:&#xD;
"40, villain !" he groaned, as his maddened gaze was fixed on&#xD;
Haskins, a"you shall pay for this with your blood !&#xD;

&#xD;
"Softly, reverend sir-softly ! One word of this, and the world&#xD;
shall know of your amours with the handsome widow."&#xD;
Herbert's gaze rested on my face-.&#xD;
"You-knew-of-this," he began, with a look that can never&#xD;
be forgotten..&#xD;
" Pardon, Herbert, pardon-I was mad," I shrieked, flinging&#xD;
myself at his feet, and clutching his knees.&#xD;
For a moment he gazed upon me, and then lifting his clenched&#xD;
right hand, he struck me on the forehead, and I fell insensible on&#xD;
the floor. The curse which he spoke as I fell, rings even yet in&#xD;
my ears.&#xD;
*   *       *       *       *       *      *       *&#xD;
Three days have passed since then. Such days as I will never&#xD;
pass again ! I have just learned that Haskins has fled the city ;&#xD;
his purpose to obtain Mary's hand in marriage, by first accomplish-&#xD;
ing her shame, has utterly failed. Her father knows all, and is&#xD;
now using every engine of his wealth to connect my pame with&#xD;
the crime, which has damned every hope of his idolized child.&#xD;
And he will succeed ! I feel it-I know it-my presentiment can-&#xD;
not prove false. What shall I do?  Whither turn? And Herbert&#xD;
is a raving lunatic. This too is my work. Yes-yes-I am re-&#xD;
solved. I am resolved.&#xD;
To-morrow's dawn will bring disgrace and shame to me, and in&#xD;
the future I see the crowded court-house, the mob eager to drink&#xD;
in the story of my guilt and the felon's cell. But the morrow's&#xD;
dawn I shall never see !&#xD;
I am alone in my chamber-the very chamber in which I became&#xD;
Morton's in an unholy marriage ; Eugene's in the marriage of a&#xD;
stainless love ; Herbert's in the mad embrace of passion. And&#xD;
now, 0, death, upon that marriage couch I am about to wed&#xD;
thee!&#xD;
The brazier stands in the centre of the -bridal chamber, its con-&#xD;
tents were ignited half an hour ago, every avenue to my chamber&#xD;
is carefully closed-already the fumes of the burning charcoal&#xD;
begin to smite my temples and my heart.&#xD;
This record, written from time to time, and now concluded by&#xD;
a hand chilled by death-I leave to my only living r-elative, not&#xD;
&#xD;
as an apology for my crimes, but as an explanation of the causes&#xD;
which led me to the brink of this awful abyss.&#xD;
Air ! Air ! Morton, for thee I have no remorse-let the branch&#xD;
snap-over the. cataract with thy accursed face ! Thou wert the&#xD;
cause of all-thou! But, Eugene, thy last look kills my soul!&#xD;
Herbert, thy curse is on me ! And poor Mary ! Air ! Light !&#xD;
It is so dark-dark-0, for one breath of prayer !&#xD;

CONCLUSION.&#xD;
THE preceding Confession, signed by the tremulous hand of the&#xD;
poor suicide,, was found in her room with the senseless corse, by&#xD;
the Relative, to whom she addressed it. For days after the 'event,&#xD;
the papers were filled with paragraphs in regard to the melancholy&#xD;
affair. A single one, extracted from a prominent paper, will give&#xD;
some idea of the tone of the public -mind:-&#xD;
(Extract from a New York paper.)&#xD;
"TRAGEDY IN HIGH LIFE.--The town is full of rumours, in regard&#xD;
to a mysterious event or series of events, implicating a member of&#xD;
one of the first families of New York. These rumours ai-e singularly&#xD;
startling, and although they have not yet assumed a definite shape,&#xD;
certainly call for a judicial investigation. As. far as we have been&#xD;
able to sift the stories now afloat, the plain truth, reduced to the&#xD;
briefest possible shape, appears to be as follows: Some years since&#xD;
Miss E----, daughter of-old Mr. ---, one of our first mer-&#xD;
chants, was, while under an engagement of marriage to Eugene&#xD;
B--, forced into a marriage with Mr. M-----, a man old enough&#xD;
to be her father, but who, it is stated, had the father absolutely in&#xD;
his power. The marriage took place, but not long afterwards,&#xD;
M---, while on a visit to Niagara, was precipitated over the Falls,&#xD;
at dead of night, in a manner not yet satisfactorily explained.&#xD;
(30)&#xD;
&#xD;
CONFESSIONS OF ELEANOR BURTON.           31&#xD;
&#xD;
Soon afterward the young widow, then immensely rich, encountered&#xD;
her former betrothed, and the fashionable world were soon after-&#xD;
wards informed of their marriage. A year passed, and B--, the&#xD;
husband of the former widow, was found in Philadelphia, mysteri-&#xD;
ously murdered, it was not known by whom, although it was&#xD;
rumoured at the time, that the brother of a wronged sister was, on&#xD;
that occasion, the avenger of his sister's shame. The beautiful&#xD;
Mrs. B--- was once more a widow. Here it might seem that her&#xD;
adventures, connected so strangely with the death of two husbands,&#xD;
had reached their termination. But it seems she was soon fascina-&#xD;
ted by the eloquence of a young and popular divine, Rev. H--&#xD;
L-. While betrothed to Miss M-         5-    , daughter of a&#xD;
wealthy member of his congregation, the eloquent preacher became&#xD;
a visiter at, the house of the rich widow, and finally his affections&#xD;
became entangled, and he was forced to choose between said widow&#xD;
and his betrothed. He sacrificed his affection for the former, to his&#xD;
solemn engagement with the latter. The 'slighted' widow endured&#xD;
the usual pangs of 'despised love' coupled with something very much&#xD;
like Italian jealousy, or rather jealousy after the Italian school.&#xD;
The betrothed was inveigled into a certain house, and her honour&#xD;
.sacrificed by a gentleman of fashion, known for thirty years as a&#xD;
constant promenader on the west side of Broadway, Mr. D-&#xD;
1-H   . The widow (strangest freak of a slighted and vindictive&#xD;
woman!) is said to have been the planner and instigator of this&#xD;
crime. We have now arrived at the sequel of the story. Unable&#xD;
to obtain the hand of the Rev. H-- L----, and stung by re-&#xD;
morse, for her share in the dishonour of his betrothed, the widow&#xD;
put a period to her own existence, in what manner is not exactly&#xD;
known, although conflicting rumours state the knife or the poison&#xD;
phial was the instrument of her death. No coroner's investigation&#xD;
took place. The body gave no signs of a violent death. 'Disease&#xD;
of the heart,' was stated in the certificate of the physician (how&#xD;
compliant he was to the wishes of rich survivors we will not say) as&#xD;
the cause of her unexpected decease. She was quietly buried in&#xD;
the family vault, and her immense estate descends to a Relative,&#xD;
who was especially careful in cloaking over the fact of the suicide.&#xD;
The tragedy involved in the affair will be complete, when we in-&#xD;
form the reader, that Mr. D------ H---- has fled the city, while&#xD;
his poor victim, M- 5-, tenants the cell of an Asylum for&#xD;
the Insane. Altogether this affair is one of the wildest exaggera-&#xD;
tions, or one of the most painful tragedies, that ever fell to the lot&#xD;

&#xD;
of the press to record. Can it be believed, that a young lady,&#xD;
honourably reared, would put a period to the lives of two husbands,&#xD;
then procure the dishonour of a rival who interposed between her&#xD;
and a third husband?  Verily, 'fact is stranger than fiction,' and&#xD;
every-day reality more improbable than the wildest dreams of&#xD;
romance. The truth will not be known until the CONFESSION, said&#xD;
to be left by the young widow, makes its appearance. 'But will it&#xD;
appear?  We shall see."&#xD;
So much for the public press.'&#xD;
The reader can contrast its rumours, with the facts of the case&#xD;
as plainly set forth in=the previous Confession, penned by the hand&#xD;
of the unfortunate and guilty Eleanor.&#xD;
How this Confession passed from the hands of the Relative to&#xD;
whom it was addressed, into the hand of the one who writes these&#xD;
lines, is a matter which may excite the reader's curiosity, but which&#xD;
the present writer is not at liberty to explain. It passed honour-&#xD;
ably from one hand to the other, at all events.&#xD;
A few words more will close this painful narrative.  Eleanor-&#xD;
was quietly and honourably buried. Her relatives were wealthy&#xD;
and powerful. The 'physician's certificate' enabled them to avoid&#xD;
the painful formality of a coroner's inquest. She sleeps beside&#xD;
her husband, Eugene Burton, in Greenwood Cemetery.&#xD;
Soon after her decease, Mr. Somers sold all his property in New&#xD;
York, and with his daughter disappeared completely from public&#xD;
view.&#xD;
Herbert Lansing remained in the Lunatic Asylum for more than&#xD;
a year, when he was released, his intellect restored, but his health&#xD;
(it is stated) irretrievably broken. After his release he left New&#xD;
York, and his name was soon forgotten, or if mentioned at all, only&#xD;
as that of a person long since dead.&#xD;
Dudley Haskins, after various adventures in Texas and Mexico,&#xD;
" turned up" at last in California. His last exploit appears in a&#xD;
San Francisco paper---.&#xD;
"tAmong the numerous black-legs who infest our otherwise peace-&#xD;
ful community, none has been so prominent for months past, as one&#xD;
Dudley Haskins, formerly well known as a man of fashion and pro-&#xD;
fessed roue in New York, but latterly only known as a professed&#xD;
black-leg, up to any desperate act, living by his wits, and as reck-&#xD;
less as he was poor. The last exploit of Dudley, undertaken by&#xD;
him with a view to retrieve his desperate fortunes, took place near&#xD;
Sonora, and ended rather disastrously. John Hawkins, a poor&#xD;
&#xD;
fellow from the States, who had achieved a little fortune in the&#xD;
mines, was on his way home with his well earned store. He was&#xD;
found near Sonora barbarously murdered. Unfortunately for Dud-&#xD;
ley, the knife with which the deed was done was identified, the&#xD;
property of the murdered man found on Dudley, and Dudley him-&#xD;
self strung up by Judge Lynch, after an hour's trial. A pitiful&#xD;
end for the once brilliant roue of New York city.&#xD;
And that was the end of Dudley Haskins.&#xD;
A single incident more, and this narrative is at an end.&#xD;
About a year after the death of Eleanor Burton, a young man&#xD;
in moderate circumstances, accompanied by his wife (a pale, faded,&#xD;
although interesting woman) and her aged father, took up his resi-&#xD;
dence in C--, a pleasant village in south-western Pennsylvania.&#xD;
They were secluded in their habits, and held but little intercourse&#xD;
with the other villagers. The husband passed by the name of&#xD;
Wilton, which (for all that the villagers knew to the contrary) was&#xD;
his real" name.,&#xD;
One winter evening, as the family were gathered about the open&#xD;
wood fire, a sleigh halted at the door, and a visiter appeared in the&#xD;
person of a middle aged man, who came unbidden into the room,&#xD;
shaking the snow from his great coat, and seating himself in the&#xD;
midst of the family. Regarding for a moment the face of the aged&#xD;
father, and then the countenance of the young husband and wife,&#xD;
which alike, in their pallor, seemed to bear the traces of an irre-&#xD;
vocable calamity, the visiter said quietly,-&#xD;
"Herbert Lansing, I am the Relative, to whom. Eleanor Burton&#xD;
addressed her Confessions, and whom she invested with the trustee-&#xD;
ship of her estate."&#xD;
Had a thunderbolt fallen into the midst of the party, it would&#xD;
not have created so much consternation, as these few words from the&#xD;
lips of the visiter. The young wife shrieked, the old man started&#xD;
from his chair, Herbert Lansing (otherwise called Mr. Wilton), with&#xD;
the blood rushing to his pale face, said simply, " That accursed&#xD;
woman!&#xD;
woIhold her last will and testament in my hand," continued the&#xD;
visiter; "I am her nearest relative, and would inherit her estate&#xD;
but for this will, by which she names you and your wife  ary, as&#xD;
the sole heirs of her immense property."&#xD;
Herbert took the will from the visiter's hands.&#xD;
"6As administrator of her estate, I am here to surrender it into&#xD;

your hands. The will was made as a small atonement for the&#xD;
injury she caused you."&#xD;
Herbert quietly dropped the parchment into the fire:&#xD;
" Her money and her memory are alike accursed. * I will have&#xD;
nothing to do with either."&#xD;
That night the Relative turned his face eastward, to take posses-&#xD;
Sion of the estate of Eleanor Burton.&#xD;
