                  <p>In "The Hidden Sin" the consequences of an evil deed are brought home to the perpetrator, and many complications arise which give zest to the story. Bessie is a charming creation, and for her sake the reader feels that he can forgive the sin committed on her account, though she refuses to be benefited by it when the truth becomes known to her.</p>

               <head type="sub">A JOURNEY SETTLED.</head> 
               <p>AFTER the departure of Frank from Ashurst, the health and spirits of Bessie reacted so slowly, that her mother became anxious about her, and finally recalled the family physician to examine into her condition.</p> 
               <p>Dr. Manton prescribed change of scene, with as much gayety as possible. He declared his young patient to be suffering more from <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ennui</foreign> than from physical ailment of any kind.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley objected that the recent death of the Judge rendered it indecorous for Bessie to mix in gay society; but the physician insisted that the mental health of his young friend was of more importance than mere scruples of etiquette. He said:</p> 
               <p>"Miss Ashley need not join in the dance, madam, 'bearing about the mockery of woe,' as the poet tersely puts it, but she can be taken where young society will reanimate her; where gay music will give a new spring to her being, even if she does not 'shake the light fantastic toe,' in keeping time to its measures. Believe me, madam, young creatures need those of their own years around them, as much as the flowers need sunshine, and now Frank is gone, Miss Bessie is moped by the quiet and dullness of the house."</p> 
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6346-00000004"/> 
               <p>"That may be," replied Mrs. Ashley, thoughtfully, "for Frank is full of life, and a most agreeable daily companion. I am extremely reluctant to leave the seclusion in which I have so long lived, but if it is necessary to the health of Bessie, I must not hesitate to do what is best for her. But I can never consent to go to a fashionable watering-place, doctor. There are springs in this State, frequented by some of our best people, who are not fond of the bustle and worry of a very gay life. Young people will be found there as elsewhere, and Bessie can find new friends to chase away the leaden melancholy that seems to be settling over her."</p> 
               <p>She anxiously regarded the physician, who ominously shook his head:</p> 
               <p>"My dear lady, a humdrum watering-place of that kind will only increase the malady from which Miss Ashley is suffering. She needs something to interest her vividly-to arouse her from the incipient sadness that is fastening upon her. Since you seem unwilling to leave your beautiful home, I am happy to suggest to you that an opportunity is offered to send Miss Bessie on a charming tour. The Welbys are kind and excellent people, and I think they are sincere friends of both yourself and your young charge. The young people are warmly attached to Bessie, and I heard Kate say only yesterday, that nothing would delight her more than to gain your consent that she shall go with them."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley faintly smiled:</p> 
               <p>"I understand your diplomacy, doctor. Kate has asked you to become her ambassador, and ascertain what I would say to the proposal. How extensive a tour does Mr. Welby think of making?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, the usual round for Southerners. Niagara, of course; Quebec and the Thousand Isles; Saratoga, then Newport, and from there to Boston and Nahant. They will be gone six weeks, which will bring the middle of September. By that time the roses will have returned to the cheeks of our sweet invalid, and the natural elasticity of her spirits be restored. When young Wentworth comes back, he will find that we have taken good care of his ladylove in his absence. Do you know, Mrs. Ashley, that the gossips in the neighborhood were very much surprised that the wedding did not come off before he made his European tour. In fact, there was a curious story told, which I did not believe a word of-but you may be offended if I repeat it."</p> 
               <p>The doctor, who was himself the prince of gossips, curiously regarded the annoyed face before him. Mrs. Ashley coldly replied:</p> 
               <p>"We thought it best to defer the marriage on which my husband's heart was set, till after Frank's return. Bessie is very young, and she has seen too little of society to be willing to give her hand to her cousin at present. As to the talk of the neighborhood, I care very little about it."</p> 
               <p>"Of course not-of course not, Mrs. Ashley. A lady in your position can well afford to ignore the idle talk of the busy-bodies. But if Miss Bessie wishes to see something of life before she settles down, this is the best chance she will have till she gets a husband of her own to take her about. I seriously advise you to permit her to avail herself of it."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley earnestly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Do you really think this change necessary to both physical and mental health, doctor?"</p> 
               <p>"I assure you in all seriousness that I do; if she is kept in this quiet house a few months longer, she may suffer from it throughout all her future life."</p> 
               <p>Now thoroughly alarmed, Mrs. Ashley at once gave<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6346-00000005"/> her consent to his proposal, and with satisfaction she saw him mount his horse, and ride in the direction of Mr. Welby's place, bearing a request from herself to Mrs. Welby to receive her daughter as the companion of her summer tour. On the following morning she intended to drive over to the Oaks, as the Welby homestead was called, to prefer her request in person. She wished to avoid the awkwardness of first asking the favor in person, for until Bessie and Frank were old enough to associate with her children, Mrs. Welby had held herself aloof from the plebeian mistress of Ashurst, and nothing less than the fears instilled into her mind by Dr. Manton as to her darling's health, could have induced Mrs. Ashley to place her daughter under Mrs. Welby's care.</p> 
               <p>She acknowledged to herself, that if Bessie must see something of the world, a more suitable chaperone could not be found for her, since she herself felt that it was impossible for her to lay aside her habits of seclusion, and venture in crowds in which she might encounter recognition and, perchance, something worse.</p> 
               <p>Unwilling as Mrs. Ashley was to be separated for a single day from the object of her passionate regard, she would not permit herself to hesitate when assured that the permanent welfare of her daughter was at stake. Yet she thought, with dismay, that in her absence Bessie might find one on whom she would willingly bestow the hand she had so persistently withheld from Frank. Conscience asked:</p> 
               <p>"If such a thing should happen-if your child recedes from the contract made for her, and thus restores the estate to its lawful heir-will she not make a happy escape from the false position in which you have placed her? For yourself you have secured fortune, then why not remove this suffering young creature from Ashurst, and permit her to seek happiness in her own way?"</p> 
                
               <p>Then the objections to this course presented themselves to her harassed mind.</p> 
               <p>"I have no <emph>certainty</emph> of keeping possession of any portion of the property left me by Judge Ashley. If discovery <emph>should</emph> come, ruin and disgrace must be the inevitable fate of my child and myself, unless, as Frank's wife, my poor Bessie would be screened from the consequences of my crime; and then, perhaps, for her sake he would also save me, and allow me enough to live on in comfort from what I may be called on to surrender to him.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no-there is no safety for either of us, save in Bessie's union with the heir, and she <emph>must</emph> eventually marry him."</p> 
               <p>Having arrived at this decision, Mrs. Ashley sought the library, in which she knew her daughter was to be found.</p> 
               <p>Bessie was sitting by an open window, in an attitude of listless weariness, and the book she had been trying to read had fallen from her hand. Her eyes had dark circles around them, and the smiling lips had lost all their mirthful meaning. So lost in abstraction was she that Mrs. Ashley came quite close to her before she became aware of her presence.</p> 
               <p>"My love," she began, in a tone she tried to render cheerful, "I have some good news for you. Do you know that Dr. Manton has been playing the part of your good genius?"</p> 
               <p>"By prescribing a nauseous bolus?" asked the young girl, with a gleam of her old archness, as she turned toward the speaker. "Minny, I am so glad that you have come to me just now, for I believe that I was again falling off into another of those strange fits of immobility when your entrance broke the spell that was closing around me. Did you tell Dr. Manton how singularly I was affected yesterday?"</p> 
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6346-00000006"/> 
               <p>"I told him that you had fainted-nothing else could have been the matter with you, my dear."</p> 
               <p>Bessie gravely replied:</p> 
               <p>"It was something far more serious than that, Minny. I must have fallen into a species of catalepsy, for I was conscious that I was still in my own room, though the phantom forms that surrounded me were not those with which which I am familiar, except that of my grandfather. The others seemed to make efforts to communicate with me, and I have a dim recollection of what they said. Just as I was recovering from the strange insensibility that numbed my body, grandpa suddenly bent over me and distinctly said-'Tell Minny to-' I understood no more, for in another instant I awoke fully to what was passing around me, and found you trying to restore me to consciousness again."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley became deadly pale, and after a moment of silent struggle, she asked:</p> 
               <p>"And those other forms, Bessie? Can you not remember what they were like, and what they said to you?"</p> 
               <p>"It was very strange, Minny," the young girl went on in a dreamy manner. "One of them was a brown-haired man, exactly like the miniature I once saw in your drawer, which you told me was that of your first husband. He seemed about to kiss me, but he only breathed on my cheek as he whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Be firm, Bessie. Never consent to be made the instrument of consummating a wrong. Tell <emph>her</emph> that retribution will yet overtake her."</p> 
               <p>"I can make no sense of such a warning as that-nor can I divine who was meant by <emph>her.</emph> But you are ill, Minny; good heavens! why should my wild fancies affect you thus!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley had sunk down upon a chair, pale and unnerved nerved; making a violent effort to regain outward composure at least, she hoarsely asked:</p> 
               <p>"And the other form, Bessie? whose likeness did that one wear, and what did it say?"</p> 
               <p>"It was the mother of Frank. I knew her by the portrait of her which hangs in the library. She knit her black brows together, and angrily spoke to me:</p> 
               <p>"Impostor! how dare <emph>you</emph> aspire to wed my son? Refuse him, and restore him to his own, untrammelled by vows which will be a burden and a curse to you both."</p> 
               <p>"So you see, Minny dear, the power of the supernatural world is arrayed against the union of Frank and myself, as much as our own inclinations are."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley regained the power of self-control, and she now quietly asked:</p> 
               <p>"What effect had these strange visions on your mind, Bessie? At the moment they were passing before you did you imagine them to be real?"</p> 
               <p>"I cannot recall what I believed then; but they were so vivid that they now seem to have been very real. But the absurdity of what they said proves them to be false spirits, if they were such at all."</p> 
               <p>"What had you been reading before you fell into this cataleptic condition, my love?"</p> 
               <p>"A strange book I found in grandpa's desk. It is a description of the condition of spirits in the spheres into which they pass after leaving this world. It was in my hand when the faintness came over me."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley gravely said:</p> 
               <p>"That accounts for it all. You are too young, and your spirits in much too variable a condition to bear such mental aliment as that. In his last days, the Judge took a deep interest in reading those curious dreamings, for they can be nothing more. They certainly cannot be elevated<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6346-00000007"/> to the dignity of a new revelation, and I regret very much that the book was left where you could find it. I beg that you will look into it no more."</p> 
               <p>"I shall not desire to do so," replied Bessie, quietly, "for I had just finished reading it when you came in. But we are forgetting the good news of which you announced Dr. Manton as the bearer, and I am becoming anxious to hear it."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley eagerly turned to another topic, and with a faint smile said:</p> 
               <p>"The doctor insists that you shall be removed from Ashurst for a season; that you shall try the effect of change and amusement to arouse you from the dreamy melancholy into which you are in danger of falling."</p> 
               <p>Bessie listened with sudden interest, and she quickly asked:</p> 
               <p>"And what did you say, Minny? You will go with me, of course; for dreary as Ashurst has lately become to me, I could never think of leaving you here alone."</p> 
               <p>"We will speak of that some other time, my love," she evasively replied. "It seems that the Welbys are about to make an extended northern tour, and Kate has expressed a wish to have you become one of their party."</p> 
               <p>"Oh! that will be charming! Kate is a dear girl, and Rufus will be a most attentive escort. Besides, Mr. and Mrs. Welby are most agreeable companions for young people. If you will go along, Minny, we shall have a delightful time."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley, with a piercing glance at the brightening face before her, suddenly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Do you like young Welby, Bessie? That is, I mean do you find him more agreeable to you than-than other young men with whom you have been thrown?"</p> 
               <p>Bessie's laugh, which of late had rarely been heard, rang out merrily:</p> 
                
               <p>"Of course I <emph>like</emph> Rufus, for we have been friends from childhood, and I do not think that we have ever had a single quarrel; but if you mean, do I love him the least bit, I can truly say that such a neat little piece of primness as Rufus Welby will never be anything more to me than a well-dressed and a well-bred gentleman. If you think there is danger that I shall care more for him than for Frank, you are much mistaken. If I were compelled to choose between them, I should prefer my cousin to him."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley looked satisfied, but she gravely said:</p> 
               <p>"My darling, if you could only give me this assurance with regard to all others with whom you may be thrown in contact during your absence from Ashurst, I should be far better satisfied to see you go. For one situated as you are, you are about to pass through a most dangerous ordeal, Bessie."</p> 
               <p>The fair face of the girl clouded, and she passionately said:</p> 
               <p>"Minny, I wish I had never been born to wealth-or that it had not been bequeathed to me on such cruel terms. My grandfather could scarcely have been in his sober senses when he bound Frank and myself to make ourselves miserable, or forfeit that portion of his estate which the law would have given to us."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley impressively replied to this outbreak by saying:</p> 
               <p>"The law would give <emph>you</emph> nothing. If there were no will, Leon Ashley could claim your portion, and if he did not run through it before his death, divide it among all his children."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Minny-even that would be better for me than to be forced on a man who really cares very little for me; and for whom I only have a strong sisterly regard. If you persist in pressing this distasteful marriage upon me, I tell<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6346-00000008"/> you that I shall perish slowly in your sight. But I have one hope left. Frank will himself recede from the contract; in his letters he is so enthusiastic in his descriptions of my sister Evelyn, that I am sure he has fallen in love with her."</p> 
               <p>At this unwelcome suggestion Mrs. Ashley again changed color, but she firmly said:</p> 
               <p>"I must warn you, Bessie, that the fancied inconstancy of Frank will not release you from the necessity of obeying your grandfather's will. Mr. Ashley will never give him the hand of his younger daughter, and I am very certain that he will insist on the fulfilment of the contract by which you and Frank are in honor bound."</p> 
               <p>"Honor!" repeated Bessie, indignantly.-"Will there be honor in perjuring ourselves before high heaven for the sake of money! I had far rather earn my own bread than enter into such wearing bonds as those would be. Minny, please don't talk to me any more about it. If Fate <emph>insists</emph> that I shall eventually become Frank's wife, leave me at least some fancied loophole of escape, that I may not die of the blues outright. Shall we go North this summer? That is now the question to be settled."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley saw that she would bear no more at that time, and she replied to her last words in her softest and most caressing tones:</p> 
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> will go, darling, but I must remain here."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Minny, why do you say that? I am sure half the pleasure of my trip will be destroyed if you are not my companion. Why can you not go?"</p> 
               <p>"Because I have led a quiet life so long that I should not enjoy a change in my habits, Bessie, even if it were proper for me to go out in the world so soon after the death of my kind, good husband. With you it is different. You will enjoy and be benefited by the change, which the doctor insists is absolutely necessary to the preservation of your health. If I did not see for myself that he speaks the truth, I would never consent to be separated from you at this time."</p> 
               <p>After a few moments' thought, Bessie said:</p> 
               <p>"It is selfish in me to accept your permission to leave you, but I yearn to get away from this place with a feeling of sick weariness which is indescribable; I never dreamed that I <emph>could</emph> suffer so much from staying in a place where I have hitherto been so happy. But it is so, Minny, ungrateful as it seems, an although you refuse to go with me, my heart bounds at the thought of seeing that world of which I have hitherto only dreamed."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley mournfully replied:</p> 
               <p>"I see plainly how it is, Bessie. You are glad to wing your way from your home nest into that unknown region whose delusive attractions beckon you on, free from the guiding hand which has hitherto carried you safely through life. It is the natural course of things, I suppose, but still it wounds the heart which has learned to cling to you as its dearest earthly stay."</p> 
               <p>Bessie rose in great agitation, and throwing herself in Mrs. Ashley's arms, she tenderly said:</p> 
               <p>"No motherless child ever before had such love lavished on her as you have given to me, Minny, and I return it with all my heart. But you worry me so about Frank, that, to tell you the whole truth, I am glad to escape from Ashurst, and all thought or mention of him for a season at least."</p> 
               <p>"You must promise me one thing before you go," whispered Mrs. Ashley. "Pledge your word to me to form no other tie, to close your heart against the insidious voice of love, at least till your return here-till your father has decided your fate. Oh! Bessie, you do not know how<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6346-00000009"/> much is dependent on your conduct for the next few months!"</p> 
               <p>Bessie extricated herself from her clasping arms, and with some fire replied:</p> 
               <p>"I fully understand that the happiness of my whole future life is dependent on my willingness to accept respectable poverty, or wealth shamefully gained. But as far as I can, I give you the promise you ask. I will not entangle myself with another lover while the shadow of a tie binds me to my cousin, though I cannot say that I may not find some one I should infinitely prefer to Frank, if I am compelled to marry."</p> 
               <p>"I must try and satisfy myself with that," said Mrs. Ashley, kissing her upon the cheek. "Certain that I may confide in your honor, I shall part from you with a heart less apprehensive for your future than it has lately been. To-morrow we will go over to the Oaks, and make such arrangements with Mrs. Welby as may be necessary."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, thank you, Minny! You are the best and kindest of creatures. It is true that I need this change, and I promise to write you an account of everything I see; and you can invite some one to stay with you while I am gone."</p> 
               <p>"No one could fill your place, my love; and with books, my flowers, and my daily walks, I can manage to pass the time away. Do not let any thought of me weigh on your mind, but gain as much enjoyment as possible from your tour. I shall be happy in thinking that you are regaining your health and spirits, and your letters will brighten me up nearly as much as your presence."</p> 
               <p>Bessie knew better than this-she knew very well that <emph>nothing</emph> could be to her devoted Minny what her daily presence was; but she only pressed her hand tenderly, with the assurance that the letters, at least, should never fail to make their appearance every few days.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
               <head type="sub">MRS. ASHLEY AT "THE OAKS."</head> 
               <p>ON the following day the visit to the Oaks was made; it was a fine old place, surrounded by the noble trees from which it took its name.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Welby was a wealthy planter, and lived as a few old Maryland families still did at that day-with open house and open hand welcoming even the chance wayfarer with that cordial hospitality which gives from its abundance as freely as it is given.</p> 
               <p>Both Mr. Welby and his wife were well-bred, good-natured people, ready to promote the enjoyment of others, and never better pleased than when their capacious mansion was filled with guests.</p> 
               <p>The house was the centre of gayety in the neighborhood, and a large family of sons and daughters successively appearing on the stage of life, kept up a round of festivities of which the elders seemed to grow weary no more than the youngest guest they received.</p> 
               <p>Luckily for Mr. Welby his fortune was sufficient to stand the drain thus constantly made upon it, for his management was good and his income large.</p> 
               <p>Two sons and as many daughters were already married, and settled near their parents; another son was grown, and the third daughter was to make her dbut this summer, while two younger girls were to remain at home under the care of their governess.</p> 
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6346-00000010"/> 
               <p>Mrs. Welby, a dumpy, light-haired woman, with a face of rosy contentment, received Mrs. Ashley with punctilious politeness, and Bessie with affection. Her daughter presently appeared-a small, fair-haired girl, with blue eyes and flaxen hair, evidently a youthful copy of her mamma.</p> 
               <p>Kate greeted Mrs. Ashley with the affectionate interest that lady rarely failed to inspire in those who had seen much of her; and Miss Welby had been a frequent guest at Ashurst. She impulsively said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, my dear Mrs. Ashley, I do hope that you have come over to confirm the good report Dr. Manton brought us yesterday evening. He said he had been persuading you to let Bessie go North with us, and if ma would only second him, he thought you might be induced to give her up to us for a little while."</p> 
               <p>Dr. Manton had evidently displayed more tact than Mrs. Ashley had given him credit for, in removing from herself the disagreeable necessity of asking as a favor that which Kate Welby now implored as a boon. Before she could reply to her, Mrs. Welby herself spoke:</p> 
               <p>"What Kate says is quite true, Mrs. Ashley. It will add very much not only to her pleasure but to that of our whole party to have dear Bessie as our travelling companion in the trip we contemplate making. I have remarked the change in her of late, but if you will trust her to our care, I think we can promise to return her to you quite restored to her former self."</p> 
               <p>Bessie gave her a grateful look, and after a few whispered words with Kate the two left the room, to go to the apartment of the young lady and discuss their plans in private.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley hastened to reply to her hostess:</p> 
               <p>"I scarcely know how to thank you, Mrs. Welby, for your kindness in offering to burden yourself with a young girl who may prove something of a charge to you. Bessie is very tractable, but she is giddy and impulsive, and I own to you that I am very anxious as to what may happen while she is away from me. The trip may benefit her health, but I fear it will sadly dissipate her mind."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Welby laughed good-humoredly as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"You must expect that she will have her head a little turned; a young lady of her attractions must, of course, receive much attention, and listen to a great deal of flattery; but Bessie has sense enough to reject the froth, and settle down on what will promise some solid comfort."</p> 
               <p>"I hope so, Mrs. Welby; but I beg that you will not permit Bessie to be spoken of, or introduced into society as an heiress. Unless she marries Frank Wentworth she loses everything, except three hundred dollars a year."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Welby looked astonished, for the lawyer had been discreet, and the provisions of Judge Ashley's will had not become generally known; and intimate as the two girls were, Bessie had never breathed a syllable of the distasteful compact by which she was bound, in the ears of her friend Kate.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Welby merely said:</p> 
               <p>"Then I may look on my young friend as betrothed to her cousin? Of course, with this confidence bestowed on me, I shall feel bound to look after her more carefully, Mrs. Ashley. I remember now, that there was some talk in the neighborhood about a wedding at Ashurst before Mr. Wentworth left, but as no intimation came to us from either party that such an event was likely to take place, I concluded there could be nothing in the report."</p> 
               <p>"I may tell you in confidence, Mrs. Welby, that there would have been one, if Bessie had not been suddenly attacked with illness. In fact, the minister was in the house to unite them; but the poor child was so deeply grieved<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6346-00000011"/> by her grandfather's death that she became too ill to give Frank the assurance that he would find her as he left her-certainly his own."</p> 
               <p>"I had heard something of that too," admitted prudent Mrs. Welby,"but the impression I received was, that Bessie was unwilling to ratify the contract, and Mr. Wentworth refused to insist on it when he found how unhappy it made her. Perhaps the change in the poor child's spirits may be traced to her dread of Frank's return."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley rapidly changed color as she listened, but she readily replied:</p> 
               <p>"I do not believe that Bessie has the slightest dread of such a thing. She and Frank are the best of friends, and they are really very fond of each other. The unwillingness she betrayed was, in my opinion, mere girlish caprice, arising from her ignorance of life. A few months hence she will understand herself better, and yield gracefully to the destiny which has been laid out for her."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Welby looked grave, but she said nothing in reply, and Mrs. Ashley went on with nervous haste:</p> 
               <p>"During Bessie's absence with you, she will have opportunities of learning the true value of wealth; she will begin to comprehend the prestige it gives; and I am sure when she once understands how important an element of happiness money is, she will not consent to relinquish her grandfather's estate because she has not formed a romantic attachment for her destined bridegroom. If she goes with you, my dear Mrs. Welby, I hope that you will constantly keep in mind her peculiar position, and guard her as much as possible from those silly, sentimental flirtations to which young girls are so prone. I assure you, that without absolute ruin to Bessie's prospects, there is no escape for her from the marriage Judge Ashley so ardently desired."</p> 
                
               <p>Struck by the earnestness with which she spoke, Mrs. Welby said:</p> 
               <p>"I will do my best to guard her from the dangers you dread for her, Mrs. Ashley, and I must say that the tender maternal interest you show for this motherless girl, is highly creditable to you."</p> 
               <p>The listener shrank a little, but she replied, with perfect calmness:</p> 
               <p>"I have reared her from infancy; she has been as my own, for she took the place of the infant that was removed from me; and of course I love her very dearly. Any misfortune happening to Bessie would affect me as nearly as it would herself. If I had spirits to go into the world again, I would never permit her to leave me; but I feel that, for me, it is impossible to forsake the shades in which I have enjoyed so many years of quiet happiness, so soon after the death of him who conferred it on me."</p> 
               <p>"I understand your reluctance, Mrs. Ashley, and respect it. You may feel assured that I will watch over Bessie as if she were my own daughter, and I will endeavor to save her from every temptation to swerve from her allegiance to Frank. I thank you for the confidence you have reposed in me, and I will prove to you that I deserve it."</p> 
               <p>"We understand each other now, and I feel better satisfied to send Bessie away with you. When do you think of leaving?"</p> 
               <p>"In four days from this time. It is short notice for Bessie, but we shall stop a week in New York, and she can have her wardrobe for the summer campaign supplied there."</p> 
               <p>"Of course; that will be the best arrangement. She will only need a travelling dress made here, and that can soon be done."</p> 
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6346-00000012"/> 
               <p>"I cannot tell you how happy I am that you have consented to let the dear girl accompany us, and here comes Mr. Welby to tell you the same. Mrs. Ashley, my dear, has come over to see about Bessie-and we have arranged it that she is to go North with us."</p> 
               <p>"Upon my word, that is good news indeed," said Mr. Welby, who was even fatter and more good-natured in appearance than his wife. "We shall be the gainers by that arrangement, and you could not have come upon a more agreeable errand, Mrs. Ashley."</p> 
               <p>"I am glad to see that Bessie is so great a favorite with you all, and I assure you that there are few with whom I should be so willing to trust her as yourself and Mrs. Welby. You know how to deal with young people-and the marriages your own daughters have made were so prudent that I can have no misgivings as to my darling, especially as I have fully explained her position to your wife."</p> 
               <p>He gravely replied:</p> 
               <p>"If my children have made good matches, the credit is entirely due to themselves, Mrs. Ashley, for we never sought to influence them in any way. I am sure it is wrong to do so. Mother and I had a nice time of it before our marriage with the senseless turmoil made by her family because she was much richer than I was, and we have been as happy together as two turtle doves. I have heard something about Bessie's affairs, and I am sorry that my old friend should have bound those two poor children in the way he did."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley felt extremely uncomfortable, and she hastened to say:</p> 
               <p>"He thought he was doing the best for them, Mr. Welby. He had watched them growing up with the fondest affection for each other, and he thought the safest way to secure Bessie's future fate from the grasp of her father, was to make sure of her union with Frank before Mr. Ashley could return to his native land."</p> 
               <p>For once in her life, the speaker was thrown so completely off her guard that the reference to Leon Ashley escaped her lips unconsciously, and she was not aware of what she had said till the expression of astonishment on the two faces before her warned her of her error.</p> 
               <p>She sunk back faint and sick for a few moments, but recovered as she heard Mr. Welby say:</p> 
               <p>"Leon Ashley alive! Leon Ashley coming home again! It seems incredible, when the world around us has so long believed him dead. It will be well indeed to save this poor child from his authority."</p> 
               <p>"That is what I most earnestly wish; but you can understand my feelings on that point without more words concerning them. I have been very thoughtless to speak as I did just now, but it is the truth. You know why Mr. Ashley was compelled to expatriate himself, so we will let that part of the story lie in oblivion. A letter came from Frank only a few days ago, in which he says that his uncle declares he will come back to Maryland so soon as he has recovered from a severe attack of illness from which he has been suffering. I cannot tell you how deeply I regret his threatened appearance here on Bessie's account. From all accounts of Mr. Ashley, he is a most violent and unreasonable man, and his want of principle was so clearly shown in his youth, that I can have no faith in him."</p> 
               <p>"Will he not be afraid to venture here again?" asked Mr. Welby. "He might be arrested for the-the fatal termination of his duel with that poor young Arden."</p> 
               <p>"He insists that he did not kill him; and, even if he had done so, that it would be impossible, after so long a time has elapsed, to prove it against him."</p> 
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6346-00000013"/> 
               <p>"He is right," said Mr. Welby. "I remember the inquest, and the verdict was death by drowning. As the dead man's sister subsequently eloped with Ashley, she, of course, believed him innocent of her brother's blood. Am I not right, Mrs. Ashley, in supposing that the Larne with whom Miss Arden went off to Europe, after what was supposed to be a very brief acquaintance, was no other than the son of Judge Ashley?"</p> 
               <p>"You are quite right. He and Miss Arden were again united, and she accompanied him in his exile from his native land. You are aware that she is dead long since, but she left a daughter who is the heiress of Arden Place; and by his last wife Mr. Ashley has a son who is yet a boy."</p> 
               <p>"And he will bring them all back with him. Bless my soul! it seems like a wild romance. If the young heiress of Arden will inaugurate the same style of hospitality which prevailed there in earlier days, it will be a fine thing for the young people of the neighborhood."</p> 
               <p>"I think she will have no control there till she is of age; her mother left her income to her husband till her child is twenty-one, and Evelyn Ashley is but seventeen. Her father has expressed his intention of taking up his abode at Arden Place when he comes hither. I am very thankful that he will leave me in peace where I have so long dwelt."</p> 
               <p>"If I remember Leon Ashley aright, you cannot be too thankful for that, Madam; and I can quite understand your anxiety on Bessie's account. I hope she will yet see with your eyes, and find happiness in the union her grandfather desired her to make."</p> 
               <p>At that moment a dapper little figure, dressed in the extreme of fashion, and carrying a slender cane in his hand, came in. His features were regular as those of a girl, and his blonde hair hung in soft waves around a brow as smooth and lineless as his sister's. Mrs. Ashley almost smiled as she thought how lately she had questioned Bessie as to the possibility of her falling in love with this miniature specimen of humanity.</p> 
               <p>Rufus Welby greeted Mrs. Ashley with great empressement, and then said:</p> 
               <p>"I have just seen the girls, Mrs. Ashley, and I have come to thank you for permitting Miss Bessie to accompany us on our tour. It will be rendered doubly delightful by her presence, and I am only sorry that you too are not to be with us. I shall have a fine time with two such pretty girls as Kate and Miss Ashley to escort everywhere."</p> 
               <p>With her sweetest smile Mrs. Ashley replied:</p> 
               <p>"I make over Bessie to you, Mr. Welby. Of course you will find other beaux for your sister, but it is my wish that you shall constitute yourself Miss Ashley's constant attendant."</p> 
               <p>Young Welby bowed low and began to express his acknowledgments for such unexpected favor, when his mother cut him short by saying:</p> 
               <p>"Don't flatter yourself, my red-haired darling, that Mrs. Ashley wishes <emph>you</emph> to make an impression on the heart of our young friend. She only thinks you are a safe attendant for our pretty betrothed, and you are too much Frank Wentworth's friend to try and rival him in his absence."</p> 
               <p>Rufus elevated his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders at this explanation, but he gracefully said."</p> 
               <p>"I am flattered, at any rate, Mrs. Ashley, that you should have so much confidence in me, and I mean to do my best to deserve it. But girls will flirt a little, and I can't engage to make Bessie hate me by interfering too much with her amusements."</p> 
               <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6346-00000014"/> 
               <p>"Oh, I can leave that to your own discretion. I wish my young fledgling to enjoy as much as possible in her flight from her parent nest. You will only step in, Mr. Rufus, when things begin to wear a serious aspect, and save her from the consequences of her own imprudence. I have spoken very freely on this subject with your father and mother, and they understand my motives for guarding Bessie from every chance of breaking the troth it is so important to her interest-and I also believe to her happiness-to fulfil."</p> 
               <p>"It cannot be otherwise, for Frank is a noble fellow, and if he loves Bessie I can understand your anxiety about the temptations to which she may be exposed while on this northern journey. She will be much admired, of course, for she is singularly handsome."</p> 
               <p>"It is not <emph>that</emph> I care to guard her against, only to prevent her from admiring any other one too much in her turn. Bessie is romantic, and she thinks it is too humdrum to accept the happiness which has been thrown at her feet. Like many other young girls, she believes that difficulties must be overcome to render a marriage blissfully happy. She will get over such notions when she gains a little more experience, and all that is necessary now is to guard her till her judgment has ripened a little."</p> 
               <p>Rufus laughed gleefully and said:</p> 
               <p>"I am really highly flattered, Mrs. Ashley, that you should appoint me the guardian of this pretty piece of humanity. I cannot boast of much experience, but with ma and pa to back me, I dare say I shall come out with credit to myself-that is, if Bessie is not provoked into cutting my acquaintance."</p> 
               <p>At that moment the bell for luncheon sounded, the girls came in together, and Mr. Welby, with old-fashioned politeness, offered his arm to Mrs. Ashley to conduct her into the next room.</p> 
               <p>The party gathered around a daintily spread table, and gayly discussed plans and made arrangements for the proposed tour. They at length separated with a promise from Mrs. Ashley to take Bessie to the railroad station on the following Tuesday in time to join her friends before they set out on their travels.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
               <head type="sub">FIRST FLIGHT FROM HOME.</head> 
               <p>AT the last it was with extreme reluctance that Bessie parted, for the first time in her life, from her darling Minny. But for Mrs. Ashley's firmness in insisting that she should go, in spite of the young girl's eager desire to leave the scenes of her childhood for a season, her affectionate heart would have prompted her to give up this charming tour sooner than leave the lady of Ashurst alone in that deserted and solitary mansion.</p> 
               <p>But Mrs. Ashley clearly saw the revival in Bessie's spirits which the mere prospect of change had caused, and she quietly overlooked the packing of her clothing, saw that every garment was in proper order, and drew from her banker a sufficient sum to cover every expense her daughter could possibly incur. This was placed in Mr. Welby's hands for Bessie's use, and every arrangement made that she thought could promote her darling's enjoyment.</p> 
               <p>When the morning actually came and the carriage was at the door, Mrs. Ashley steadily put aside the regrets<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6346-00000015"/> which she saw only increased the nervousness of her companion, and quietly assumed her seat in the vehicle.</p> 
               <p>Bessie had already taken leave of the servants, but old Jupiter, with the freedom of a privileged retainer, came up to the side of the carriage, and respectfully lifting his hat from his grizzled head, said:</p> 
               <p>"I hopes as how you'll come back to us safe, Miss Bessie; but I'members how Miss El'nor went off to de Norf jest as you is a gwine, an' she never come back agin no mo'. She run off from Nagry, an' dat was de las' dese ole eyes ever seen o' her bright face."</p> 
               <p>"Don't fancy that you are going to get rid of <emph>me</emph> so easily, Uncle Jupe, for I have not the least idea of going away from my beautiful home to stay forever. Like a bad penny, I shall be sure to be returned on your hands again."</p> 
               <p>"Dat's as it maybe, young Mistis; but ef you vally de ole place as much as ye lets on to, you must be keerful to hold on to yer own right in de way dat was pinted out. Dere's two on you to claim dis house, an' ef you don't stay true to Marse Frank, in course as you is de <emph>gal,</emph> you'll have to give it up to him. You is gwine away, an' I jes' thought I'd use my 'sperience to warn you of what mought come to pass while you is a gallivantin' around, forgettin' what's due to de young marster."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Uncle Jupe; I shall remember your caution, and when I come back I will bring you a roll of fine tobacco for your thoughtfulness in making it."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you in my turn, Miss Bessie. You don't look a bit like any of de ole stock, but I mus' say dat you's as pretty spoken as any on 'em ever was."</p> 
               <p>"Drive on," said Mrs. Ashley, in a sharper tone than she was in the habit of using, and the coachman instantly obeyed her.</p> 
                
               <p>Bessie glanced at her face, saw that she was annoyed, and said:</p> 
               <p>"The old man is almost in his dotage, and he was so faithful a servant to my grandfather that I can bear with his freedom of speech."</p> 
               <p>"I know that, love, but Jupiter often tires and vexes me without intending to do so. But let us not speak of anything unpleasant in this last hour of uninterrupted communion for many weeks to come. You will write to me every other day, Bessie, and oh! my darling, still continue to confide in me as you have hitherto done. Tell me all your thoughts, describe each new impression made upon you in the scenes in which you are about to appear, and if you <emph>can,</emph> Bessie, try and discipline your feelings to accept the destiny which, I am sure, will bring happiness to you."</p> 
               <p>In that parting hour, poor Bessie would have pledged herself to anything her beloved Minny asked, and; with a tremulous thrill in her voice, she said:</p> 
               <p>"I have tried, Minny, but I will make a yet stronger effort to reconcile myself to the path duty points out as the right one. Now that I am separated from Frank, and there will be no one to urge his claims upon me, I may be able to think more complacently of uniting my fate with his. I am a very wayward person, I am afraid, and perhaps when I am left to the dictates of my own feelings, I may choose to love him better than any one else. I will do my best not to disappoint your wishes. I know that you only seek my good, and I thank you as sincerely as if your views and mine agreed on this momentous subject."</p> 
               <p>"They must yet agree, my darling, and all will be happily settled at last. If I did not part from you in this belief, I should be very, very unhappy."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," replied Bessie, vaguely, "God will direct us in the right path, and I pray constantly to him for guidance."</p> 
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6346-00000016"/> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley seemed to shrink within herself at this reply, and she remained nearly silent till the end of the drive, holding the hand of Bessie tenderly clasped in her own.</p> 
               <p>At length the carriage drew up in front of the station house, a rough and noisy place, the platform of which was covered with the luggage of our travellers. The rest of the party was already there, and they were momentarily expecting the shrill warning which gives notice of the approach of the train.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley had scarcely time for a few parting words when the piercing whistle of the engine was heard; in a few more moments the cars thundered past them, were suddenly checked, and the conductor's voice was heard:</p> 
               <p>"All aboard!"</p> 
               <p>One convulsive embrace, a long, long kiss, and Bessie was parted from her mother; again that wild shriek pierced the air, the train went rushing onward, and Mrs. Ashley stood desolate, almost despairing, as she caught the last glimpse of her vanishing idol.</p> 
               <p>She regretted now that she had not gone with her-anything would have been better than yearning with every passing hour for a glimpse of that beloved face-to grow heart-sick for the sound of that fresh young voice. But it was now too late-Bessie was gone, and she must return to her lonely home, and endure her absence as she best could. She mechanically stepped into her carriage, and wept bitterly all the way back to Ashurst.</p> 
               <p>She endeavored to stifle the forebodings of evil that assailed her, but they would not be set at rest, and long before the day closed in she had deeply repented allowing her daughter to leave her.</p> 
               <p>In the mean time, Bessie had almost become reconciled to her separation from her beloved Minny. When they parted, it seemed to her scarcely a moment had elapsed before she was whirled away with the speed of the wind, leaving behind her the scenes she had once regarded as the very Eden of the world. Yet she was gladly leaving them, with such anticipations of the brilliant panorama about to open before her, as only the young and inexperienced can indulge.</p> 
               <p>A few bitter tears were shed, but the life and bustle on the train soon caused her to forget everything but what was passing around her. Her travelling companions sought to divert her mind from dwelling on the recent parting, and when they reached Philadelphia late in the night, she declared that she had enjoyed her trip exceedingly, and already felt better for the change.</p> 
               <p>After two days' stay in the city of brotherly love, our travellers set out for New York, and there our two youthful novices found a new pleasure in selecting their own dresses and ornaments-a privilege which had hitherto been exercised for them by their elders.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Welby decided that so far from her own home, it would be perfectly proper for Miss Ashley to appear in half mourning, and the most exquisite demi-tints, with rich black trimmings, were chosen for her, to be worn with jet ornaments.</p> 
               <p>No style of dress could more charmingly have set off the natural attractions of Bessie. Her radiant complexion and golden brown hair seemed to harmonize with the grave colors, and the brilliant animation of her piquant face rendered her an object of attention wherever she appeared.</p> 
               <p>After ten days spent in New York, the party set out for Niagara. Pleasant rooms had been secured for them in the Cataract House, and the one assigned to Kate Welby and her friend overlooked the rapids above the fall on the American side. They were much surprised and rather disappointed<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6346-00000017"/> appointed that the thunderous roar of so mighty a volume of water did not shake the building to its foundations.</p> 
               <p>But like everything else that is grand and mighty, Niagara slowly impresses the beholder with its wonderful power. It pours down its vast volume of water with a majestic dignity which, after a while, becomes awful. The mind gradually comprehends how restless is that calm sweep of waters-how powerless man must become in the grasp of that element which is ordinarily so submissive to his use, and the sublime effect of the cataract is heightened by the vague dread with which it fills the imagination.</p> 
               <p>The first day was spent in exploring every nook, and both the American and English sides of the river were visited, for so eager were our young tyros to see all that was to be seen as soon as possible, that Mr. Welby good-naturedly consented to allow them to take a cursory view of every object of interest, though they were to be again visited and enjoyed.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Welby declared herself too much fatigued to appear that evening, but the two girls could not resist the sounds of gay music which came from the ball-room, and after a crowd had collected in the scene of gayety, Rufus Welby, feeling as proud as a peacock of his fine plumes, entered the brilliantly lighted saloon with his fair sister leaning on one arm, and Bessie, stately as a young princess, on the other.</p> 
               <p>The fire of expectation lighted up her beautiful eyes, and brought back the roses to her cheeks, the ruby red to her mobile lips. Already had her health marvellously improved, and in her new freedom, she rarely gave a thought to the shackles which had so deeply eaten into her soul in the solitude of Ashurst.</p> 
               <p>Young Welby found many acquaintances who had been known to him while at a northern college, and he found himself soon beset by requests for introductions to the two fair young creatures he had escorted into the ball-room.</p> 
               <p>Kate was soon on the floor, whirling around in the fascinating mazes of a waltz, but Bessie declined dancing. She promenaded with several of her new acquaintances, and charmed each one by the mingled simplicity, shrewdness, and native wit her conversation displayed.</p> 
               <p>As the evening was drawing to a close, Rufus came toward her, accompanied by a tall, finely-formed young man, with a dark, expressive face, and large, black, dreamy eyes.</p> 
               <p>He presented the stranger as he gayly said:</p> 
               <p>"Miss Ashley, my college chum and particular friend, Mr. Ernest Delancey, wishes to make your acquaintance. He has been going into ecstacies over your exquisite hair, which, to tell you the truth, I think is almost as red as my own."</p> 
               <p>A faint color flashed into the olive cheek of Delancey, and bowing before Bessie, he said:</p> 
               <p>"Pray excuse my friend's freedom, Miss Ashley, and do not attribute any want of respect to me. I merely asked an introduction to the young lady with radiant hair which wears the hue that painters love."</p> 
               <p>Bessie smiled graciously, shook her finger at Welby, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Welby and I have been children together, and he feels privileged to say what he pleases to me. As to the color of my hair, persons differ. Some call it red, others golden auburn; but so long as it suits the style of my face I do not care what name it receives."</p> 
               <p>"You are quite philosophical on the subject, I perceive, Miss Ashley; but if it were less becoming, I fancy you would care a little," replied Delancey, with an admiring glance at the lovely face crowned by the golden aureole which seemed to glitter in the flood of light that filled the<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6346-00000018"/> room. "When you passed through New York did you visit the Dusseldorf gallery?"</p> 
               <p>"Of course-that is one of the chief attractions to be found in the city."</p> 
               <p>"Then you saw there the picture of Tasso reading the poem of Jerusalem Delivered to the family of Este. Do you remember the beautiful hair which two of the ladies have? Yours is precisely of the same tint."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I remember; but I think the painter has taken the liberty of bestowing locks of his favorite color on at least one of them. History does not tell us that Leonora D'Este had blonde hair."</p> 
               <p>"I am not sure that history gives any accurate description of her; but as the portrait was ideal, the artist was at liberty to bestow on her every attraction which, in his eyes, would enhance her charms. Do you not agree with me?"</p> 
               <p>Before she could reply, Welby, who had remained near them, laughingly said:</p> 
               <p>"A curious taste he must have had if he considered red hair an attraction."</p> 
               <p>With a mischievous twinkle in his eyes, he made his escape, and Delancey offered his arm to Bessie as he said:</p> 
               <p>"Shall we promenade, Miss Ashley? That is, if you are not already fatigued with walking around in the heat and glare of the ball-room."</p> 
               <p>"If we can escape from it into the open air I shall be very glad to take a short walk to some point from which we can see the effect of the moonlight upon the fall," she thoughtlessly replied. "Half its solemn beauty must be lost in the garish light of day."</p> 
               <p>"That is my own feeling exactly," said Delancey, with a sudden touch of awakened interest in his voice. He had been struck by her pretty face, and commenced, as all men do with an attractive woman, by flattering her; but her last words showed him that there was something in common between them, and he earnestly went on:</p> 
               <p>"I am familiar with every point of view from which this mighty wonder can be seen to best advantage, and if you are not afraid to venture out in the night air in evening dress, I shall be happy to point out to you a few of them."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I walk out in the night air when I am at home with nothing over my head. I do not think that half an hour spent in visiting the falls will do me any harm. But there is Mrs. Welby coming in now. I suppose she was afraid to trust us too long out of her sight, so set aside fatigue and followed us."</p> 
               <p>Delancey conducted her to the side of her chaperon, who seemed to have quite recovered, and looked around with an air of enjoyment as rare as it was agreeable in the anxious mother of a family.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Welby at first objected to her young charge leaving the ball-room, but the entreaties of Bessie finally prevailed. But before she left, the elder lady took from her own shoulders a lace shawl, and insisted that Bessie should throw it over her head.</p> 
               <p>This was readily agreed to, and in great glee at her success, the wilful young girl threaded her way through the crowd with her cavalier, and soon found herself standing with him on the wide bridge leading to Goat Island, the glittering stream sweeping down in silent majesty on the upper side; on the lower one foaming and chafing over huge boulders of rock till it reaches the abrupt ledge over which the American fall precipitates itself.</p> 
               <p>The moon was full, and the wild panorama was as distinctly seen as by day, yet clothed with that misty light which softens every asperity, and gives its own charm to all it shines upon.</p> 
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6346-00000019"/> 
               <p>The usual loungers seemed to have abjured romance and left the scene to night and solitude, for the bridge was quite deserted; and the young pair leaned on the railing of the rustic structure, and talked as neither of them had ever talked before. Each one felt a charm in the mere presence of the other which they made no attempt to define, and the open sesame of hearts must have been applied to theirs, for they spoke together more as friends of old standing, than as acquaintances of an hour.</p> 
               <p>Delancey at length pointed out the exquisite effect of light and shadow in the scene before them, and descanted with such earnest interest on the beauties of the falls, that Bessie said:</p> 
               <p>"You must be an artist, Mr. Delancey-nay, I am sure you are one, or you could not have so lofty an appreciation of the beauties of nature."</p> 
               <p>"I have the honor to enroll myself among the followers of that noble craft, Miss Ashley. I aspire to be an artist in the truest sense of the word, and not a mere copier of nature. I feel her loveliness in every thrilling pulse of my being, and my unskilful hand has essayed to transfer the spirit as well as the form of things to my pictures. I have not yet satisfied myself, but I shall-I will do it, if life is only granted me."</p> 
               <p>He slightly raised his hat, as if in reverence for the majesty of the theme he discussed, and Bessie's eyes were fascinated to his face, which seemed to become almost luminous with the fire that glowed within.</p> 
               <p>She softly said:</p> 
               <p>"I see that you are indeed a <emph>true</emph> artist, Mr. Delancey, and I shall take great pleasure in seeing some of your productions."</p> 
               <p>"They will always be at your service, Miss Ashley; but I have nothing with me here except my sketches of Niagara ara. When they are completed, I hope, by a series of views, to give those who have never visited the falls, a faint idea of their mighty charm. I think that I can comprehend the fascination they exercised over the hermit who came hither and passed his life in communion with their sublime grandeur-perishing, at last, within the sound of the cataract's solemn roar."</p> 
               <p>"I read of him in a little book I bought to-day, containing the history of the falls, and our guide pointed out the place where he was lost. It is not very far-let us go on to the spot."</p> 
               <p>"Will Mrs. Welby approve of your wandering so far from the house?" he respectfully asked.</p> 
               <p>Bessie blushed vividly and hastily said:</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps not. I was thoughtless, as I often am. We have already lingered here a long time, and we had better return at once."</p> 
               <p>As they were stepping off the bridge, two figures were approaching them from the house. One of them wore a white nubia over her head, and Bessie recognized her friend Kate, attended by her brother.</p> 
               <p>Miss Welby gayly spoke:</p> 
               <p>"Mamma sent us in search of you, Bessie, but she did not tell us to come back as soon as we had found you: so if you are 'agreeable,' as Mammy Phillis would say, we will take a moonlight stroll around this romantic Island."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Katy, you have divined my wishes!" said Bessie, joyfully, "so we will go at once."</p> 
               <p>With perfect <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sang froid</foreign> Rufus walked to the speaker's side, and offering her his arm, said to Delancey:</p> 
               <p>"Exchange is no robbery, Ernest. I will give you my sister in lieu of Miss Ashley for the remainder of the walk."</p> 
               <p>Though neither Bessie nor her companion was particularly<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6346-00000020"/> larly pleased with this exchange, it was made with perfect good breeding on both sides, and the four walked on.</p> 
               <p>The exaltation Bessie had lately felt sunk to the flattest prosaic level, as she listened to the bantering of young Welby on the conquest she had made. Just as they were approaching the hermit's bath, Rufus said something that both excited and annoyed her. She turned her clear eyes upon him and disdainfully asked:</p> 
               <p>"Am I to understand, then, that I am to be guarded from the attentions of every agreeable man I may meet, because my cousin Frank has some chimerical claim upon my hand. Mr. Welby, you are impertinent to hint such a thing to me, and if that is why you were sent hither to take me from Mr. Delancey, I frankly tell you that in future you may spare yourself any such trouble: I can guard myself sufficiently."</p> 
               <p>He deprecatingly replied:</p> 
               <p>"I beg that you won't get angry with me, Bessie. It was my mother that sent me after you, but I was a fool to hint anything of it to you. Ask her, and she will tell you that Mrs. Ashley spoke seriously to her about you, and she told me herself that she gave you over to my special charge."</p> 
               <p>"Which you interpret to mean that I am not to enjoy a rational and agreeable conversation with any gentleman without being interfered with. I am not a flirt-neither am I a susceptible young lady, so you may spare your cares on my account."</p> 
               <p>Before he could reply, they gained the romantic hollow through which the water dashes over broken ledges of rock on its way to the edge of the fall. Beneath one of these tradition says that the hermit sat to take a unique shower bath whenever the weather permitted.</p> 
               <p>Bessie was vexed and in one of her reckless moods; ignorant of the danger she incurred, she sprang suddenly upon the nearest ledge of rock before the warning voice of Delancey could be heard. The surface was slippery from the constant falling of spray upon it; she lost her footing, and in another instant she must have been borne bruised and bleeding down the swift moving current, had not the presence of mind of the young artist saved her.</p> 
               <p>As she stood balancing on the very brink of destruction, struggling to maintain her perilous footing, Delancey sprang to her side, struck the heel of his shoe in a crevice in the shelving rock which his quick eye had detected, and heedless of danger to himself, caught her tottering form in his arms. In another instant he regained the firm earth, holding her clasped to his breast.</p> 
               <p>Extreme as her danger had been, Bessie had not had time to realize all the horror of the terrible fate that menaced her, before she found herself safe. Panting and blushing she extricated herself from the strong clasp which had just saved her from a doom she shuddered to think of, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh! Mr. Delancey, but for you I must have gone down-down into that terrible turmoil of waters, and been never-never seen again by mortal creature! Till I stood vibrating above it, I had no idea that the current could be so strong at this point."</p> 
               <p>He quietly replied:</p> 
               <p>"No one who has not studied Niagara as I have, can comprehend all the dangers that encompass it. The stream, even where it seems to glide along most softly and smoothly, carries with it as certain destruction to him who falls into it as if he were thrown into the 'hell of waters' below the fall, which Byron has thus graphically described. You do owe your life to my strong arm and quick eye, Miss Ashley; if every crevice around this spot had not been perfectly known to me, you must have perished. But<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6346-00000021"/> I ran no risk myself, and therefore you need not thank me for what I have done. Do you feel too tremulous to walk on? If we go as far as Iris Island, the moon is so very bright to-night that we may chance to see a lunar rainbow."</p> 
               <p>"Let us go on," said Bessie, impulsively. "I am as well as I ever was in my life; and when Mrs. Welby hears what a narrow escape I have had, I know she will not permit us to come out again by moonlight during our stay here."</p> 
               <p>Rufus attempted to remonstrate, but Kate sided with her friend, and the party went on; but now Bessie clung to the arm which had so lately saved her, and a glance at young Welby showed him that she understood his tactics, and was determined to defeat them.</p> 
               <p>He offered his arm to his sister as he whispered:</p> 
               <p>"It is no go; Bessie is like a blooded colt that has never felt the curb, and 'tis of no use for our good mamma to manuvre to keep her out of danger. She will rush into it in the very spirit of defiance."</p> 
               <p>"So-o-ma sent us here to prevent a flirtation, then," said Kate, saucily. "I wondered why she so suddenly became uneasy about Bessie. I understand now; you were to appropriate <emph>her,</emph> and force my society on Mr. Delancey, victimizing both of us; for he greatly preferred Bessie to me, and I did not find walking with him half as agreeable as dancing with Fred. Ellery. You made me forfeit my last waltz with him."</p> 
               <p>Her brother mockingly said:</p> 
               <p>"I dare say you think you have made a wonderful discovery now, Miss Welby. But what will you think when I tell you that mamma commented on your dancing three times with Fred. Ellery, and ordered me to take you away before you had made it patent to all the world that you and he have fallen in love with each other at first sight. What do you say to that?"</p> 
               <p>Kate blushed and defiantly tossed her head, but she thought it safest to make no reply to her teasing brother, and they walked on in silence till they stood upon the miniature gem of verdure which lies between the two falls and commands a fair view of both. The rising spray showed a faint reflection of the brilliant bow which spans the island on a bright day, but so shadowy was the resemblance that Bessie declared it scarcely merited the name of a rainbow."</p> 
               <p>They stood just above the rocky bed of the American fall, over which the water glides with more majestic slowness as it approaches the verge of the torrent-while on the other side of the little oasis was the rush and roar of the Canadian fall, flashing in the moonlight, and sending its spray in clouds almost to the spot on which they were standing.</p> 
               <p>Rapt, entranced, with her clasped hands lifted in an attitude of reverent admiration, Bessie softly said:</p> 
               <p>"Thy wonders, O Lord, amaze our souls, and carry away our senses captive!"</p> 
               <p>Welby, in whom the sense of reverence was singularly wanting, laughed, and quoted: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"'Thy wonders, Lord, the parson cries,</l> 
                        <l>Amaze our souls-delight our eyes;</l> 
                        <l>The tailor only made this note:</l> 
                        <l>Oh, what a place to-sponge a coat!'"</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>"From the sublime to the ridiculous, eh, Bessie?"</p> 
               <p>She flashed her luminous eyes on him with an expression of indignant surprise, and Delancey exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Sacrilege! You deserve to be tossed into the roaring flood, Welby, for such irreverence in the presence of one of Nature's mightiest works."</p> 
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6346-00000022"/> 
               <p>Before any reply could be given by Rufus, Bessie shivered, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Let us go back; I feel chilled to the heart, and I am disgusted too. The charm is broken by that Vandal. The next time I come on such an expedition as this, Rufus, I shall take care to exclude from the party every one that has not some trifling sense of the sublime and beautiful."</p> 
               <p>"Which means that I am tabooed. But pray relax your severity, fair Bessie, for I promise immediately to set about studying Burke on those themes; and, perhaps, he will develop in me some sense that I seem to lack."</p> 
               <p>He assumed such a mock repentant air, that Bessie could not forbear smiling. Then skipping forward with Kate, he declared that the sweet expression of her bright eyes had revived his sinking spirits, and enabled him to recover from the stinging reprimand her rosy lips had uttered.</p> 
               <p>The party turned in the direction of the house, but Delancey and his fair companion lingered some distance behind the others, again forgetting all the world but themselves in the absorbing interest of their conversation.</p> 
               <p>Bessie marvelled that she felt so little shyness toward one she had known so short a time, and when they gained the entrance of the hotel, she placed her hand in that of Delancey, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Good night, Mr. Delancey; I have enjoyed a most charming walk, and gained from you so many new and beautiful thoughts, that I feel quite grateful to you. We shall, of course, see you to-morrow, and Mrs. Welby will thank you for the service you have rendered me, far better than I can. I must also see your drawings of the scenes we have visited to-night."</p> 
               <p>"I shall be charmed to call on you, Miss Ashley, and also to exhibit my pictures to yourself and your friends. I will bring my portfolio to your parlor, and leave its contents tents to be inspected at your leisure. I have no studio here, unless the spot in the open air on which my easel is set up can be called by that name. Good night, young ladies, and may the angel of dreams shed her sweetest influence over your slumbers."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> shall dream of being tossed in a seething cauldron, and drowned in a cloud of spray," said the incorrigible Rufus. "Macbeth's witches are nothing to the modern ones. Good night, <emph>young</emph> sisters, and escape the effects of our romantic promenade, by taking-a drop of Mrs. Gamp's elixir of life."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Rufus, you horrid creature!" exclaimed the girls in chorus, and they tripped up to their apartment, leaving the young men together.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A FRIENDLY WARNING.</head> 
               <p>WELBY and Delancey moved toward their own wing of the building. After a few moments' pleasant reverie, the latter said:</p> 
               <p>"That Miss Ashley is a most enchanting creature, Welby. I have never before been so deeply interested in any one on so brief an acquaintance. Do tell me something more about her."</p> 
               <p>"Touched, eh? but you had better look out, old fellow. You are treading on dangerous ground, I can tell you. That young lady is destined to marry her cousin, whether she will or no, or lose the whole of her inheritance. I warn you off fairly, and it will be your own fault if you permit your heart to play the traitor to you."</p> 
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6346-00000023"/> 
               <p>"Pshaw! stuff! The day for such complications as that has passed away. The law will right her, even if she won't marry the man you spoke of. I would swear that she has never loved any one; and such an impulsive creature as that will never consent to give her hand without her heart. But what do you mean by warning <emph>me?</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Only that I think you are in need of something of the kind. I meant merely to tell you that making love to an engaged young lady is sometimes a dangerous pastime."</p> 
               <p>"But if, as you hinted just now, Miss Ashley is engaged without her own consent, there will be something piquant and romantic in winning her from the fate from which she shrinks."</p> 
               <p>"But you can't <emph>afford</emph> to do such a thing, Ernest. You have no fortune, and she will have deuced little unless she marries Wentworth. You see, I am perfectly frank with you."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Welby," said Delancey, with a slight touch of hauteur. "I know you mean well, but you only pique me to the trial; for I believe I have been guilty of the absurdity of falling in love at first sight. By heaven! this is no bread-and-butter Miss! with the sweet insipidity of most of her kind, but a creature with heart, brain, sensibility! Ah! such a being as this may well make a man dream how divine a thing pure and perfect love may be!"</p> 
               <p>"Whew! ages gone already! I say, Ernest, you have fallen in love with the wrong sister. The other one-the Arden heiress-is coming to this country, and <emph>she</emph> should be your quarry. I had settled the whole thing in my own mind, and I mean to invite you to the Oaks after the family return from Europe, that you may have a chance to make the acquaintance of the second daughter."</p> 
               <p>Delancey looked puzzled. He said:</p> 
                
               <p>"I do not exactly understand to what family you refer, and how is this young lady a <emph>sister</emph> of the heiress to the Arden estates?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I forgot. That is a secret yet, but it will be safe in your keeping. Leon Ashley is coming back to Maryland to resume his own name and live at Arden Place. The young lady whose acquaintance you made to-night is the daughter of the first wife, and the joint heiress to her grandfather's estate, provided she gives her hand to the other heir; if not, she gets only a small annuity. Have you never suspected that Leon Ashley and Leon Larne are one?"</p> 
               <p>Delancey listened to this explanation with vivid interest. He replied:</p> 
               <p>"My father always said so, but I have never thought much about it. He insisted that a woman so fanatically attached to a man as Grace Arden was to her first lover, would never have consented to elope with his cousin within two months of his death. And Ashley is really coming back?"</p> 
               <p>The conversation which ensued we will not repeat, as it treated of things already known to the reader; but it was nearly dawn before the two friends separated and retired to their own apartments.</p> 
               <p>The acquaintance thus commenced was successfully cultivated by the young artist, in spite of the feeble efforts made by Mr. Welby and his wife to discourage his visits.</p> 
               <p>In fact, Bessie had plucked up courage to speak freely with them on the subject of the tie that bound her to Frank, and the kind and sympathetic couple concluded that it would be sinning against this helpless young creature if they aided in thrusting her into a union which they clearly saw was so repulsive to her.</p> 
               <p>They believed that little harm could come from her acquaintance<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6346-00000024"/> quaintance with Delancey. The two seemed to take much interest in conversing with each other, and they soon discovered that there was marvellous sympathy in their tastes; but, unconsciously, the manner of both was guarded, and Mrs. Welby never suspected that beneath that seeming reticence glowed the first embers of a flame which might yet defy the conventional forms which binds the victim to the car of destiny that rolls relentlessly upon its course, crushing out the life of the suffering and bleeding hearts over which it passes.</p> 
               <p>Day after day what Delancey called his movable studio became the centre of attraction to at least four of the visitors at Niagara, for Fred. Ellery, a distingu looking young man from New York, had attached himself to the party, evidently fascinated by the blue eyes of Kate Welby; and she accepted his devotion with the quiet satisfaction of one who has found the jewel of her life, and is ready, in due time, to appropriate it.</p> 
               <p>Bessie allowed Rufus to escort her on these occasions, but they quarrelled and made up every day of their lives, and she only forgave his teasing when he left her quietly seated on the grass near the spot on which the easel was placed; that had now become enchanted ground to her, and the conversations on art daily held by herself and Delancey were the most delightful intellectual recreations she had ever known.</p> 
               <p>Bessie was quite unconscious that the personale of the artist lent enchantment to his eloquent words. She believed her mind and imagination alone to be revelling in the scenes he brought up before his vivid fancy, when in reality her heart was dumbly crying out:</p> 
               <p>"This man is your fate. Flee from him while you yet possess the power to do so, or it will soon be too late to make the attempt."</p> 
                
               <p>She heeded not the silent warning, but from day to day drank in the sweet intoxication of his presence-of his dreaming eyes-of the silvery stream of words that issued from his lips with no apparent effort on his part. But no look or conscious sign from Delancey broke the delicious dream of security in which she revelled. Had he incautiously betrayed the slightest evidence of the increasing interest with which she inspired him, Bessie would at once have been upon her guard, and at last have made an effort to keep her parting promise to Mrs. Ashley.</p> 
               <p>But Delancey was an honorable man, and aware of the position she held, he forbore to betray the passion which increased with every hour they spent together. He mentally decided:</p> 
               <p>"I will leave things to take their own course. But if Bessie betrays the slightest preference for me before she leaves this place, I will trample impossibilities under foot. The man to whom they would force her to give her hand shall then never possess it while I live to dispute his claims."</p> 
               <p>Thus trembling on the very verge of the fiery gulf of passion, these two met day after day, and with each meeting Delancey looked into the crystal depths of those frank, dark eyes, to see if they as yet had any message for his inner soul. But Bessie, in happy unconsciousness of her danger, betrayed no sign that her heart had wandered from her own keeping.</p> 
               <p>Delancey had spent several years in Europe, and Bessie never wearied of listening to his descriptions of art and manners in the countries he had visited. One day, when Ellery and Kate had wandered to some distance, and Rufus had not come out with them, he came very near betraying the new feelings that swayed his heart.</p> 
               <p>He had been speaking of Italy, and he went on as if dreaming aloud:</p> 
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6346-00000025"/> 
               <p>"One can live on very little there, yet enjoy all that is really worth having. If I could return to that beautiful land, with a companion suited to my tastes; with one who would sympathize with me in all my pursuits; who would make my life beautiful by her tenderness, I think I should be willing to abjure my cold fatherland for ever, and be contented to dwell upon the classic ground consecrated by the genius of the great masters who have lived before me."</p> 
               <p>As he finished speaking, his large, soft eyes fell upon the young girl seated nearly at his feet, and the sudden change in her expressive face startled him into the consciousness that he had been expressing the thoughts which had lately haunted him day and night.</p> 
               <p>She instantly regained composure, and with one of her arch smiles, replied:</p> 
               <p>"The wide world will surely afford you 'one fair minister' for whom you seem to sigh, Mr. Delancey. You picture to yourself a life of Arcadian simplicity and peace; but prosaic as it may sound in this moment of exaltation, may not a domestic rebellion arise if there should happen to be a deficiency of bread and butter."</p> 
               <p>This was lightly said, to conceal the vivid interest she was conscious of having taken in his words; and the sudden pang that struck to her heart gave her the first intimation that she had already passed the neutral ground of friendship, into the fiery vortex of an overwhelming passion.</p> 
               <p>But Bessie managed to control the outward expression of her dismay at the discovery, and she arose with a feeling of relief as she saw young Welby approaching them, fanning himself with his hat.</p> 
               <p>Delancey lowered his voice, and reproachfully said:</p> 
               <p>"I scarcely expected that such a revulsion of feeling would be caused by <emph>you,</emph> Miss Ashley. In that favored clime, bread and butter are but vulgar accessories to life. 
                  <emph>My</emph> Peri and her slave could live on fruit, nectar, and <emph>love.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>With the last word he flashed a glance into her shrinking eyes that made her tremble, but she gayly replied:</p> 
               <p>"Such light diet would, doubtless, refine and elevate your conceptions of beauty; and if you only succeed in finding the Peri who may be willing to enjoy it with you, I hope you may realize your brightest anticipations in her society."</p> 
               <p>Welby here joined them, and bowing to the artist, she moved away attended by him. She did not see Rufus put up his hat to screen his face from her scrutiny while he made a singular grimace at his friend. This was returned by a defiant wave of Delancey's brush; and when they had passed on till a curve in the path shut them from the view of the artist, Rufus demurely said:</p> 
               <p>"I sincerely beg your pardon for appearing so inopportunely, Bessie. If I had dreamed that Delancey was making love to you, I should have kept at a discreet distance."</p> 
               <p>She turned her flashing eyes upon him, and disdainfully replied:</p> 
               <p>"What do you mean by such an assertion as that? You saw nothing-heard nothing that savored of a declaration of love. Mr. Delancey and I were merely discussing possibilities."</p> 
               <p>"Yes-I see-I understand," he replied, with a most provokingly knowing look. "But there was a greal deal of personality mixed up with them. Faces tell more than words sometimes, and I had been studying yours and Delancey's at least a minute before I interrupted you."</p> 
               <p>"Then you are a false and dishonored wight, Rufus Welby. How dared you play the spy upon us in such a manner as that! But, thank heaven! you made no discovery worth speaking of."</p> 
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6346-00000026"/> 
               <p>"Didn't I, though! How blind some people are! They remind me of the ostrich that hides its head in the sand, and fancies itself safe from observation. Pooh! Bessie, you are as transparent as glass."</p> 
               <p>"If I am, I can see myself so darkly through it that I cannot understand what you mean by such idle talk. I desire that you will speak to me in this way no more-I find it annoying, not to say impertinent."</p> 
               <p>Welby saw that she was really excited, and after walking on a few paces with an air of mock humility, he said:</p> 
               <p>"I should never have followed you, but I was dispatched by my honored mamma to bring back our stray sunbeam to shine on letters which have just arrived from Ashurst. If you and your cavalier <emph>will</emph> place yourselves upon my path, with conscious looks upon your faces, of course I shall look out, and interpret them for my own satisfaction. Is there anything dishonorable in <emph>that,</emph> Mademoiselle Wasp, and will you swear that I did not make the notable discovery that <emph>you</emph> are getting on thin ice-ready to break through into a sea of troubles?"</p> 
               <p>Bessie had recovered control of her temper, and felt ashamed of her late words; she hurriedly said:</p> 
               <p>"Please, hush your nonsense, Rufus, and tell me what is the news from the Oaks."</p> 
               <p>"The Oaks, is it, that you want to hear from? I am much flattered, I am sure. Let me see: Miss Brunton is flourishing, and Addie and Jenny are improving each shining hour, as we are assured the busy bees do. All the darkies are well, and matters are getting along swimmingly generally. I hope that satisfies your anxiety about my paternal home."</p> 
               <p>She laughed, in spite of her vexation.</p> 
               <p>"Yes-quite; I am satisfied. Of course, you could tell me nothing about what has happened in my own home. I must read dear Minny's letter to find out about that."</p> 
               <p>"No-I am not gifted with clairvoyance; but I have another gift which answers very well in its place while we are still in this mundane sphere. <emph>My</emph> intuition tells me that the subject of your Minny's letter will not tally with the thoughts and feelings I so lately detected flitting over your tell-tale face. Oh, Bessie, I am your fast friend, and I warn you to draw back resolutely from the tempting precipice whose edge is covered with flowers. You were not born for poverty-neither could Delancey bring down his fine taste and aspiring hopes to the level of an unsuitable marriage, without losing the noblest part of his nature. Do not permit yourself to become the stone fastened about the neck of the man you love, which will forever impede his efforts to rise. <emph>He</emph> must gain money with his wife, or drudge out his life in the lower walks of his profession, to win bread."</p> 
               <p>The earnest words of the speaker struck to the conscious soul of Bessie, and she bitterly felt the truth of his words, unexpected as they were from such a source.</p> 
               <p>She stopped, with every shade of color retreating from her cheeks and lips, while the sombre fire that gleamed in her dark eyes seemed to flash the lightnings of the repressed storm that raged within her bosom. In a voice of deep emotion, she said:</p> 
               <p>"Rufus, we have been children together, and on this subject I will bear from you what no other being should say to me with impunity. When I parted from Minny, I promised her that, <emph>if possible,</emph> I would reconcile myself to the necessity of obeying my grandfather's wishes with reference to Frank and myself. But the struggle is useless. I will endure the bitterest poverty sooner than give my hand to a man I cannot love; but I tell you in all sincerity,<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6346-00000027"/> that I would sooner commit the unpardonable sin of self-destruction than become a burden to <emph>any</emph> man. Now, let me alone, and-hold-your-tongue."</p> 
               <p>"That is easily done," said Welby, who was in one of his most bizarre moods; and he daintily took the tip of his tongue between his thumb and forefinger.</p> 
               <p>In spite of her deep excitement, Bessie laughed at this ridiculous action; and she struck up his hand with her parasol, and ran off in the direction of the bridge.</p> 
               <p>Welby soon overtook her, and they went on more amicably till they reached the house.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
               <head type="sub">IMPORTANT LETTERS.</head> 
               <p>BESSIE ran up to Mrs. Welby's room, and found her with a table in front of her covered with letters and papers. She gave a double one to her, and said:</p> 
               <p>"I hope it contains good news from Ashurst, my dear. I think, from its thickness, that you will find European letters inclosed."</p> 
               <p>"The glow faded suddenly from the young girl's face, and she quietly said:</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps so, ma'am; I will go to my room and see what Minny says."</p> 
               <p>Kate was still abroad, and she had the apartment to herself, for which she was very thankful. Tearing off the envelope, three letters fell out, two bearing a foreign post-mark, one of which was addressed to Mrs. Ashley-that one had been opened-the other was from Frank to herself.</p> 
               <p>She took up the one bearing Mrs. Ashley's name with a strange thrill of emotion, for she felt that for the first time she was brought in contact with something that emanated from her unknown father. After holding it clasped in her hands a few moments, she laid it down with a light shudder, and first read the lines addressed to her by her Minny.</p>

                           <p>"MY DARLING:-I need not again tell you how much I miss you; how often you are beside me in spirit, though you are so far away in person. It seems to me that there is some kind of communication between us all the time, and this delusion, if it be one, sustains my spirits through this weary separation.</p> 
                           <p>"But I bear your absence now far better than I did when you first left me-so make yourself as happy as possible, and come back to me bright and charming as in days of yore.</p> 
                           <p>"By the time you return we may expect our dear Frank back again, and with him comes your father. Mr. Ashley returns here to remain permanently, and his residence so near us will in a great measure place your destiny under his imperious control.</p> 
                           <p>"Oh, Bessie! I dread his advent more than I can express to you, and I am convinced that the only escape for you from his tyranny is to accept the protection Frank can afford you. Dearest, in the brilliant world to which you have been introduced, have you not already discovered that wealth is necessary to maintain the prestige of those who aspire to something more than mere animal existence? Keep your fancy free, Bessie-do not give me a rival just yet, and for the sake of your own future keep the promise on which I so implicitly rely.</p> 
                           <p>"Frank did not write to me, and much as I was tempted to open his letter, I thought it best to send it to you intact; so I do not know what new arguments he has to offer to win over your wayward heart.</p> 
                           <p>"Thank Mrs. Welby for her maternal kindness to you, and remember me to the rest of the family.</p>

                           <p>"MRS. ASHLEY-<hi rend="i"/>Madam: Since the advent of my nephew, and my removal to this place, I have improved so much that I can now address a few lines to you myself.</p> 
                           <p>"It is quite true that I shall return to Maryland and resume my own name; it was laid aside contrary to my better judgment, but so long as my father lived I maintained the deception he compelled me to practise, from a fanatical notion that his family honor would be compromised if I underwent a trial for a crime of which I was really innocent.</p> 
                           <p>"I will cast no reproach on Judge Ashley's memory which can wound you, for Frank assures me that you have made him a most devoted and exemplary wife.</p> 
                           <p>"'Every one to his taste,' as the homely proverb has it, but I must give a young and attractive woman, such as I am informed you are, credit for great self-control in keeping up the farce of affection for a sexagenarian to the very end.</p> 
                           <p>"But the old man has paid you well for your devotion, for I find that he has left you nearly all his personal property, besides the third of his estate which the law will allow you.</p> 
                           <p>"At first I thought I would contest the will, but on becoming better acquainted with Frank's views, I have concluded that it will be best for my <emph>interests</emph> to permit it to stand, and the wishes of Judge Ashley with reference to the two grandchildren he reared beneath his roof, to be carried out.</p> 
                           <p>"I hope to find Bessie submissive and ready to accept the fine young man he designed for her.</p> 
                           <p>"I shall not intrude on you at Ashurst, and I shall be glad if you will send orders to Arden Place to have the house prepared for my reception there.</p> 
                           <p>"I hope we shall be able to leave Europe in time to avoid the September gales-and I am improving so rapidly that I think we shall do so. With love to my daughter, I am yours respectfully,</p>

               <p>"There was not much comfort in this, and with a curl of her lips that was almost contemptuous, Bessie threw aside this characteristic missive, and broke the seal of Frank's. Her face brightened as she read the following lines:</p>

                           <p>"We are coming home, Bessie, as fast as steam can bring us, so soon as my uncle is strong enough to bear travelling.</p> 
                           <p>"I have written to you once before from Vienna, but have not yet received any letters from dear old Ashurst. In my first letter I said nothing of my own peculiar feelings as to the past, but now I will write frankly to you.</p> 
                           <p>"I reflected deeply on all that happened at Ashurst before I left, and the more I thought, the more imperative did it seem to me to give you up, for I felt assured that you could never be happy with me for your husband.</p> 
                           <p>"But since then, Bessie, a new revelation has dawned on me, and I now know that you were right. We did not love each other as those should who bind themselves irrevocably together.</p> 
                           <p>"Are you curious to know how I have at last made this discovery? I will tell you-simply by falling really in love myself.</p> 
                           <p>"In my last letter I described my arrival in Vienna and my introduction to your father's family. If I said what I thought of my cousin Evelyn, I must have given you some intimation of what has since happened.</p> 
                           <p>"Bessie, your sister and I love each other; let this confession give solace to your apprehensive heart-neither Minny's persuasions nor the will of my grandfather can make me do so fatal a thing for both of us as to insist on the fulfilment of the contract in the forming of which we were not consulted.</p> 
                           <p>"We will recede from it, and yet find means to divide the estate between us, but this intention must be held a profound secret till the right time for action arrives, for we have a watchful, wilful, and, I am sorry to say, an <emph>unscrupulous</emph> enemy to our plans in your father.</p> 
                           <p>"Mr. Ashley does not wish Evelyn to marry at all; as,<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6346-00000029"/> through her, he enjoys the revenues arising from the Arden estates.</p> 
                           <p>"But of all these things we will talk when we meet, as I have not time now to discuss them. Evelyn sends her love to her unknown sister, and I shall never know how to be grateful enough to her whose clear insight into her own heart and mine saved us both from committing an irreparable error.</p>

               </q> 
               <p>Bessie read this letter over several times, and the fervor with which she at last said:</p> 
               <p>"Good, noble Frank, I love you better now than I ever did before in my life," proved how great a weight had been lifted from her heart.</p> 
               <p>She put her letters away and sat down to think what use she would make of her restored freedom, and in spite of the sage warning she had so lately received from Rufus Welby on the folly of marrying poor, with a vivid blush she came to the final conclusion that to surrender it to Delancey was the best thing she could do for her own happiness. Her three hundred a year would, in so cheap a country as Italy, prevent her from being a burden to him, and in spite of the harsh predictions of Welby, she would help her lover to rise to the position his talents entitled him to fill, in place of dragging him down into a slough of poverty and suffering.</p> 
               <p>With such happy thoughts filling her heart and deepening the roses on her cheeks, she sat and dreamed several hours away. She was aroused by the entrance of Kate, who seemed to be in a state of great excitement.</p> 
               <p>After a little preliminary hesitation, Miss Welby confided to her friend that Herbert Ellery had asked her to be his wife, and she had referred him to her parents.</p> 
               <p>"Then I may consider the affair as settled," said Bessie, "for Mr. Ellery is unexceptionable in every respect. He is good-looking, intelligent, moral, and, withal, the son of a merchant prince. I congratulate you, Katy dear; you will be married this fall, and I will go to New York and spend next winter with you."</p> 
               <p>Kate laughed.</p> 
               <p>"You settle things with wonderful rapidity for other people, Bessie, though you are in no hurry about your own affairs. I shall be glad to see you if Frank will let you come to me, for, by that time, I expect you will be married yourself."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, indeed; I am happy, then, to tell you that I shall <emph>not</emph> consult Frank on that, or any other subject in which I am personally concerned. I may as well tell you now what I have already said to Rufus, that I have made up my mind never to marry Frank, I don't care what becomes of my refusal. So, hey for a brilliant winter in the metropolis of this great country, with the dashing bride, Mrs. Herbert Ellery."</p> 
               <p>She seized Kate by the waist, stifled the remonstrances she was preparing to utter by innumerable kisses, and then whirled her around in a mad waltz till both were out of breath.</p> 
               <p>Depositing her friend on a sofa, Bessie sunk down at her feet, and said:</p> 
               <p>"I am not going to listen to any tirade on duty, and all that, from <emph>you,</emph> Kate, so just leave me to fight my own battle in my own way. I have had glorious news from Europe, but Frank bids me be prudent, so you must 'bide your time' to hear all that we are doing to circumvent our elders."</p> 
               <p>"I can see plainly enough what <emph>you</emph> are doing," replied Miss Welby, pointedly; "I am afraid mamma will have a poor account of her guardianship to return to Mrs. Ashley."</p> 
               <p>"Pooh! what can your ma do but advise, and I am sure she has done enough of that. She has no authority<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6346-00000030"/> over me, and if I do not take her advice, how is she to help herself? But really, Kate, I think I have been very good since I have been with her. I have given her little trouble, and I have not got into a single flirtation."</p> 
               <p>"Oh-h! then you are in earnest-I declare I had no idea that you would eventually throw Frank over for this good-looking artist. My dear Bessie, Mr. Delancey is charming, but he will not be able to support you as you have been used to live, for years to come, if ever."</p> 
               <p>"Always the same story, even from young lips," exclaimed Bessie, indignantly. "Suppose I prefer giving up some of my luxuries for the privilege of choosing my own future, what then?"</p> 
               <p>Kate laughed, shrugged her pretty shoulders, and said:</p> 
               <p>"How savagely you speak, my dear. What then will happen, I suppose, will be a quiet wedding such as we read of in sentimental stories, succeeded by perfect bliss in an humble cottage."</p> 
               <p>"However humble the home may be, I promise you that it shall be the abode of peace and contentment," said Bessie with emotion.</p> 
               <p>"I know it will, darling, so forgive my light words-they were not meant to wound. But there is the first dinner bell, so we must hasten to the important duties of the toilette."</p> 
               <p>Radiant in loveliness, with a new and softer charm beaming from her lovely eyes, Bessie made her appearance in the dining saloon; but for the first time since she had known Delancey, he was seated nowhere near them. For some time past, if he could not escort one of the young ladies in to dinner, he had managed to secure a seat on the opposite side of the table, from which he could see and converse with them at intervals.</p> 
               <p>Bessie scarcely tasted her dinner, but the unusual flow of her spirits caused Rufus to shrug his shoulders, and whisper:</p> 
               <p>"Did Frank tell you that you are at liberty to go to the deuce for all he cares, that you are in such glee, Bessie?"</p> 
               <p>She gave him a quizzical side glance, and replied in the same tone:</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps he did-what then? Shall I lay myself on the funeral pyre of blighted affection, and bewail my desertion till I perish of a slow decay?"</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps you might have done something better than that, if <emph>somebody</emph> had not been called suddenly away to the sick bed of a friend. He leaves to-night, so you may wear the willow for whichever one you lament most."</p> 
               <p>Bessie curled her lip at the suggestion, but she turned her head away that her tormentor might not read its expression, and the lively flow of words with which she had amused those around her continued with unabated brilliancy till they arose from the table.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A PURSUER ON MRS. ASHLEY'S TRACK.</head> 
               <p>BESSIE took refuge in the private parlor attached to their suit of apartments, believing that Delancey would be sure to seek her there before he took his departure.</p> 
               <p>She knew that the Welby family were in consultation on Kate's destiny in Mrs. Welby's chamber, and she felt secure of at least an hour of uninterrupted solitude, provided Delancey did not make his appearance. Bessie unconsciously listened for every step, and flushed or grew<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6346-00000031"/> pale as they were mistaken for the one she believed must yet come.</p> 
               <p>Her expectations were not doomed to disappointment. So soon as Delancey had completed his arrangements for leaving Niagara, he sought the parlor in which he had, of late, spent so many pleasant hours.</p> 
               <p>With scarcely defined feelings as to what he desired to gain in this parting-interview, he knocked at the door and entered the room, to find the only one he particularly cared to meet sitting alone with a book in her hand, which she did not seem to have been reading.</p> 
               <p>Delancey quietly said:</p> 
               <p>"I have called to bid you farewell, Miss Ashley. You have probably heard that the illness of a friend summons me away."</p> 
               <p>Suddenly chilled by his changed manner, she replied quite as coolly:</p> 
               <p>"Yes-Rufus told me at dinner that you were going. I hope your friend is not seriously ill."</p> 
               <p>"No-I fancy not; but he is an eccentric person-a seafaring man just in from a voyage. As he has few friends-in fact, none that I know of who have a nearer interest in him than I possess-I feel bound to go to him without delay."</p> 
               <p>"Is the gentleman a relation?" she presently asked, to break the awkward pause that ensued.</p> 
               <p>"No-I first made his acquaintance on shipboard. My father died at sea, Miss Ashley, and the kindness shown to him in his last illness by Captain Martin bound me to him for life. I would go to his assistance in similar circumstances, if he summoned me from the other side of the world."</p> 
               <p>"That would be but right, Mr. Delancey; such a claim as that is sacred-of course you should lose no time in going to your friend."</p> 
                
               <p>She scarcely knew what she was saying, but she looked up; their eyes met, a flash of electric light seemed to issue from them, and for the space of ten seconds the gaze of each one was held spellbound by that of the other. All that a look could express was said by that one, without any volition on the part of the two who had so many reasons for, as yet, concealing the interest they felt in each other.</p> 
               <p>At length Bessie tore her eyes away from the fascinating splendor that flashed into them from the dark orbs of Delancey, and a rosy flush mounted to her cheeks.</p> 
               <p>He clasped her hand fervently in his own, and in a low, excited tone said:</p> 
               <p>"Farewell, Miss Ashley; I shall see you again before your tour is ended. Welby will keep me informed of your whereabouts. Present my adieux to the other ladies, for I have scarcely a moment to remain, even if I dared do so at present."</p> 
               <p>Delancey left her standing there, palpitating with shame and indignation at the expos she had made of her feelings, and the evident gratification it seemed to afford him. He had taken with him the assurance of her regard, while he shrank from committing himself in words. Such was her unjust thought, for at that moment a wild and blissful hope was thrilling the heart of her lover, and he was resolving to risk everything to make her his own.</p> 
               <p>He went on his way that night, buoyant as a lark, though he was going to the sick bed of one he loved. The next morning he found himself in New York, and hastened at once to the boarding house in which Captain Martin usually stayed when in that city.</p> 
               <p>Delancey found his friend still confined to his bed, though not dangerously indisposed. He was irritable as most active men are while confined to a single room; and<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6346-00000032"/> it tasked his utmost skill to amuse him and keep him quiet as long as the physician declared it to be necessary to do so. He nursed him carefully, read to him, and while Martin slept, he amused himself by painting a miniature of Bessie on ivory.</p> 
               <p>Truthfully did the lover's memory serve him, and the radiant image which had so deeply enchanted him soon smiled back into his eyes with that look of living light which had laid bare her secret.</p> 
               <p>When Martin awoke, the young artist would conceal the fair vision, on the contemplation of which he nursed his passion; but one day he was not quite rapid enough in his movements. The sick man detected his attempt to put something from his sight, and he peevishly asked:</p> 
               <p>"What are you hiding from me, Delancey? If you have anything that affords interest to yourself, I really think you might show it to an old hulk laid up at anchor as I am."</p> 
               <p>After a moment's hesitation the young man replied:</p> 
               <p>"I will show you a picture I have been painting, which I think is a fair specimen of young America-that is, of the fairer part of it. But I warn you not to criticise it so severely as your usual habit is, for I believe that I am more than half in love with the original. If I had not considered <emph>her</emph> future before my own, I should have told her so before I left her."</p> 
               <p>"Umph! Thinking of marrying, I suppose, on the pittance you can win by your brush. I hope, for the sake of your sanity, that the girl has some money of her own."</p> 
               <p>Martin impatiently held out his hand, and without replying to his last words, Delancey placed the square of ivory within it. He glanced at the sweet face, and in an excited tone asked:</p> 
               <p>"Who is this? It is the strangest resemblance I ever saw in my life. She might be Frank Wilde's daughter; but that is impossible, for <emph>his</emph> child died."</p> 
               <p>"No-that young lady is not Mr. Wilde's daughter."</p> 
               <p>"Who, then, is she? What name does she bear?"</p> 
               <p>"That is Miss Ashley of Maryland. She is the grand-daughter of Judge Ashley of-"</p> 
               <p>But his further explanations were cut short by the excitement of Martin. He raised himself upon his elbow and thundered:</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Who</emph> did you say she is?"</p> 
               <p>"The grandchild of a distinguished Maryland judge, and a man of large fortune. But unluckily for me, the old man left his estate to his two grandchildren on the condition that they shall marry each other. The one that refuses loses all. If I were only independent I would try my cause with Bessie, for I am desperately <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pris</foreign> with her, and I have a faint hope that I might succeed in winning her for my own."</p> 
               <p>"Why can't you speak English?" growled the excited listener, who seemed to be making a great effort to control himself. "As to the girl, if she will have you, ask her frankly, and trust to Providence for the rest. I tell you you're <emph>free</emph> to love her-to win her-in spite of Judge Ashley's will; and when she knows what <emph>I</emph> can tell her, she would sooner starve than touch a penny of his estate, if she has in her the spirit of her father."</p> 
               <p>"Her father was the son of the old gentleman, Captain Martin; from what my friend Welby told me about him, I should not think him anything to boast of."</p> 
               <p>"Umph! much <emph>he</emph> knew about it! I know a great deal more about her father than any one else living, but I cannot now explain how I came by that knowledge. You have furnished me with a clue to the most singular-But no, it will be wrong to enlighten you any further just<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6346-00000033"/> now. If you truly love this young girl, tell her so as soon as may be, and in your honorable affection let her take refuge from the evils that threaten her. There-that is all I have to say at present."</p> 
               <p>Delancey was completely mystified, and he said:</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry to hear you say that, for you have only bewildered me by what you have said. Will you not be induced to explain how you came to know anything of Miss Ashley, Captain Martin?"</p> 
               <p>"Miss D-l!" cried out the irascible invalid. "I did not say that I know anything about her, but I know something about the original of this picture, which I could tell if I chose, but I <emph>don't</emph> choose, and that's the end of it."</p> 
               <p>Delancey gazed at him as if in doubt as to his perfect sanity; he at length said:</p> 
               <p>"And in spite of this singular mystery, you still advise me to ask this young lady to be my wife?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, ye-es, if she is as innocent and charming as that bit of ivory looks, you may risk your fate with her, for one of her parents had honor and truth, if the other is-what I sha'n't at present say. Only let me get out of this bed, with strength enough left in my body to follow this thing up through all its windings, and if I don't make some pay for this, my name is not Jack Martin. I let her off for the <emph>first</emph> sin, but may the d-l fly away with me if I do the same for this."</p> 
               <p>The sailor's excitement threatened to bring back his fever, and much as his interest and curiosity were aroused, Delancey insisted that he should be quiet, and endeavor to compose himself.</p> 
               <p>After a good night's rest, he hoped to induce Martin to unravel the mystery to which he had referred; but his hopes were disappointed, for on the next, and on the following days they spent together, the reserve of Captain Martin on this subject proved impenetrable. He seemed to have made up his mind on the course it was expedient to pursue, and all the satisfaction Delancey could gain from him was-</p> 
               <p>"You can marry the girl if you wish it, and if she will consent to have you. <emph>I</emph> possess the power to compel those people to give her to you, but she will have no fortune, mark that. When I see her, if I like her as well as I do you, I'll give you both the little I have saved, after I am gone to kingdom come. That will be nothing in comparison with the Ashley estate, but it will be honestly come by. Don't bother me about this affair any more, lad, for I am not going to tell you a thing about it till I have ascertained beyond a doubt that my suspicions are correct."</p> 
               <p>With this Delancey was forced to be contented, and glad of any excuse for laying his heart and hand at the feet of Bessie, he watched the progress of Martin's recovery with intense solicitude. He almost made up his mind that his old friend was slightly demented, and he wearied himself with conjecturing what could be the secret he so tenaciously guarded.</p> 
               <p>If, as Martin asserted, it threatened misfortune to Bessie, his must be the privilege of sheltering her from its worst effects, and with all the fine chivalry of his nature aroused to protect and defend her who had already betrayed her preference for himself, the young artist impatiently awaited the moment in which he could fly to Bessie's side, declare his passion, and win from her the confession that it was returned.</p> 
               <p>As soon as Captain Martin had recovered sufficiently to commence his investigations, he went over to Hoboken, and sought out the man in whose family he knew Margaret Wilde had been received in her day of darkness and poverty.</p> 
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6346-00000034"/> 
               <p>To his intense chagrin, he found that Hinton was dead, and his family had moved to the West. By persevering inquiry, Martin learned from one of the neighbors that a young woman called Margaret Wilde had boarded with the Hintons a short while, but she afterwards went to the cottage of the widow Sims to take care of a young child whose mother had died there.</p> 
               <p>He furthermore learned that Mrs. Sims was now bedridden, very deaf, and extremely cross, but he made his way to her cottage, and after a lengthy and most unsatisfactory interview with the old woman, Martin ascertained that Mrs. Wilde had given her own infant to some rich lady in New York, but the failing memory of Mrs. Sims could not recall either her name or place of residence.</p> 
               <p>At this point Martin was unwillingly compelled to forego his investigations, for an imperative summons to take command of his ship without delay was forwarded to him from the navy department.</p> 
               <p>Baffled for the time, he deferred following up the clue he had gained till he returned from his voyage, which he believed would occupy but three months. He made notes of the few facts he had gathered, and among them these words were found:</p> 
               <q>
                  <p>"I know the James Hunter who employed Mrs. Wilde to go South as nurse to Judge Ashley's granddaughter. <emph>One</emph> child was given away to-I can't discover who-must trace <emph>her,</emph> and come up with Hunter, if it is possible to do so."</p>
               </q> 
               <p>With this resolution, Captain Martin took the command of his ship. At the last moment he warmly shook hands with Delancey, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Good-bye, lad; I have failed in what I undertook to do, but it's only for a time. I shall come back soon, and follow up the clue to as rare a piece of villany as ever was heard of. But I won't expose the perpetrator of it for the sake of the gratitude I owe her father, and for the friendship I felt for the man that loved her with all his true and noble heart. Ah yes-he proved his devotion to her happiness in a way that not one in a thousand would."</p> 
               <p>"As mythical as ever, Captain. I begin to despair of ever unravelling your late oracles. Do you still bid me pursue this young lady, who seems to be enveloped in a cloud of mystery which even you cannot penetrate," asked Delancey, with a smile; for by this time he had made up his mind that the eccentric captain was suffering from some hallucination of mind with regard to Bessie and her connections.</p> 
               <p>The strange hints Martin dropped, but which he pertinaciously refused to explain, gave his young friend this impression, and he sincerely wished that he had never shown him the miniature of his beloved.</p> 
               <p>To his inquiry Martin energetically replied:</p> 
               <p>"Youngster, if I believed you to be worldly minded, lightly given to the vanities of life, I would say, give up this poor girl on whom a heavy blow is preparing to fall. But you are not shallow, nor mean, nor cold of heart, therefore I say to you this:-If that pretty creature has shown that she likes you, take her away from the false position in which she has been placed by one who is now ready to secure it to her by forcing her, perhaps, to give her hand to the true heir of the Ashley estate. Since you've told me about the will, the devilish cunning of that woman is plain enough to me. But I won't accuse her-no I won't, till I am <emph>convinced,</emph> and then I promise to deal gently with her for your sake, as well as for that of the bright-haired lassie you may, by that time, claim as your wife."</p> 
               <p>"Good-bye, old friend. If you <emph>will</emph> talk in enigmas, I<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6346-00000035"/> cannot pretend to understand you. I hope you will have a prosperous voyage and safe return. In spite of your hints that something terrible is looming in the background of her fate, when you come back you may find that my golden-haired goddess has descended to the prosaic level of a poor artist's wife."</p> 
               <p>"So much the better, lad-so much the better for you both if that should happen. Good-bye again, and God bless you!"</p> 
               <p>Delancey was set on shore, and went back to his boarding-house in a deep reverie. Every tender and generous impulse of his nature had been aroused by the hints of Martin. Unlike the ordinary generations of the world, the intimation that poverty, and perhaps disgrace, might hereafter be Bessie's portion, only deepened the fervent love he cherished for her, and made him more resolute to snatch her from the evil to come.</p> 
               <p>That morning he had received a letter from Welby dated from Newport; during his detention in New York the party had visited Canada, and returning by the way of Boston, they were now on their way South. A week at Newport, and another in New York, would find them ready to return home. The weather was still delightful, and in the hope that they could be induced to linger as long as the skies were genial, and the breezes soft, Delancey set out to join them.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">DANGERS THICKEN.</head> 
               <p>MRS. ASHLEY sat alone in her elegantly furnished sitting-room, clad in soft raiment, and surrounded by all she could once believed could afford her unalloyed happiness; but at this hour she found only bitter regrets in her heart for the heavy price she had paid for the luxuries she enjoyed, unavailing penitence for yielding to temptation through her passionate and overwhelming love for her child.</p> 
               <p>The bitter fruit her sin had already borne she alone knew; the lonely struggles, the writhing consciousness that she had forfeited both happiness and self-respect to secure the position of her daughter; and yet, through her, she now felt assured that her punishment was to come.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley had endured the days of Bessie's absence with a dull sense of vacancy and desolation; it seemed to her that the sun of her life had gone out with the departure of that beloved face, and many times was she tempted to follow her and join the party, that she might watch over her darling with the Argus eyes of jealous affection.</p> 
               <p>But then the dread of her life arose before her to threaten her with detection, and she felt that she <emph>dared</emph> not venture from her seclusion. So the days lapsed away in a kind of dumb, apathetic suffering, which she meekly bore as some expiation for her wrong-doing.</p> 
               <p>Sinner though she was, an evil soul did not dwell in<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6346-00000036"/> Margaret Ashley, but a proud and tenacious one did; and day by day she hardened herself in the resolution to hurry on the marriage of Frank and Bessie as soon as they both returned to Ashurst, and listen to no remonstrance from either.</p> 
               <p>She would use Leon Ashley to carry out this purpose. Since he <emph>would</emph> return to Maryland, she would secure his aid by such wiles as she knew how to practice successfully, and when completely fascinated, she would use her power as she had used it with Judge Ashley. Then, without endangering her influence over Bessie, she could compel the contumacious girl to submission through the authority of her supposed father.</p> 
               <p>Of late, Bessie's letters were unsatisfactory; they were not as frank as she wished them to be, and she restlessly feared that some infatuation for another had driven from her mind the slight preference she had cherished for Frank.</p> 
               <p>The tour of the party would be extended to the middle of October; the weather was still delightful, and letters had not failed to come from each place at which they stopped long enough for Bessie to write. But they were only <emph>surface</emph> letters, which did not satisfy her mother. Bessie described the scenes in which she was taking a part, gave graphic pictures of the society in which she mingled, and sketched the scenery through which she was passing, with a power of language and an appreciation of the beauties of nature, that both surprised and delighted the reader.</p> 
               <p>She was enthusiastic in her praises of the Welby family, and seemed never wearied of dilating on their kindness to her. She gave a most flattering description of young Ellery, the betrothed of Kate, but she never once referred to her own inner thoughts or feelings, or gave a clue to that which was moulding her life and fixing her future destiny.</p> 
               <p>Delancey's name was never mentioned, though she more than once referred to a talented artist who had shown her his masterly sketches of the falls. Neither did she refer to Frank, nor make any comments on the contents of the letter Mrs. Ashley had forwarded to her, though that lady had several times inquired what Wentworth had written.</p> 
               <p>In all this there was no intentional deception on the part of Bessie. She regarded Frank's last communication as the final closing of the engagement which had existed between them. She understood Mrs. Ashley's wishes and feelings, and she considered it useless to fill her letters with unprofitable arguments concerning a subject which had already been discussed in all its bearings. When they met, an understanding must take place, and she reserved the final struggle for freedom till Frank was near her to sustain her through it.</p> 
               <p>In this state of anxiety the weeks wore away slowly enough to the solitary woman, and the state of her mind began to show itself in her person. She grew thin and languid, and a degree of irritation once unknown to her placid temper daily assailed her.</p> 
               <p>On this morning she was expecting letters, and she impatiently watched for the arrival of the boy who had been sent for the mail. At length he came in sight, leisurely walking his horse up the avenue. Mrs. Ashley threw open the half closed blind, and waving her handkerchief to him, exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Hurry, you sluggish dullard! While my heart is eating itself out with anxiety for the news you bring, you idle along in that careless manner. Come faster, I say."</p> 
               <p>The lad could not hear her words, but he understood the impatient motion of the white cambric very well, and hastened to put his steed in rapid motion.</p> 
               <p>When he dismounted on the lawn, and came toward<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6346-00000037"/> the window with the postbag in his hand, he rolled his goggle eyes, and deprecatingly said:</p> 
               <p>"I's been gone a long time, I knows, Missis, but 'twan't my fault; de pos'mas'r kep' me 'long o' his havin' to hunt up a letter what had been somehow forgot. He had put it out'n de way agin, an' had to look arter it a right smart chance."</p> 
               <p>"You always have some excuse, you provoking boy. When you are once mounted on that pony, you are never willing to come back home as long as there is a pretext for staying away. Give me the bag, and get out of my sight."</p> 
               <p>Glad to escape with no further reprimand, for of late his mistress seemed to have changed her character, Sambo handed over the bag, and retreated toward the stable yard as rapidly as possible.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley, with compressed lips and shining eyes, hastened to strew the contents of the bag upon a table. Among them she found three letters for herself. One was from Bessie, and on this she was about to seize when her eyes fell upon the address of the second, which she saw was from Wentworth.</p> 
               <p>The third one had a slip of paper wrapped around it, on which the postmaster had written an apology for having, in some inexplicable manner, overlooked it, and left it in a crevice in her box for several weeks past.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley read the excuse with a faint, sick feeling of apprehension, for she remembered the sprawling writing on the envelope but too well. She recalled the days of her childhood, when she had often guided the hand that formed those characters, but had never been able to change the style of his chirography. She passed her hand over her eyes, and convulsively muttered:</p> 
               <p>"What can John Martin have to say to me? What-what?"</p> 
                
               <p>She groped blindly for the seal of the letter for several moments before she succeeded in breaking it. Then, pressing her fingers upon her eyelids to steady her vision, she sank upon a seat, and with extreme agitation read the following lines:</p>

                           <p>"MARGARET:-When we met sixteen years ago in the woodland near Ashurst, I spared you then because I did not believe that you had outlived all your noble instincts, even if you had proved false to him who merited better treatment at your hands than he received.</p> 
                           <p>"I should never have intruded on you again, had I not discovered that, in that interview, you basely <emph>lied</emph> to me. You may think this harsh language, but I have been in the habit of calling things by their right names, and you must bear what your conduct has brought on yourself.</p> 
                           <p>"On that day you assured me that the child of Frank Wilde was dead. I believed you, and went away satisfied to leave you to such peace as you could enjoy after what you had done. You told me this falsehood at the very time that his daughter and yours was dwelling with you in the stately home of which your perfidy had made you mistress.</p> 
                           <p>"I am now convinced in my own mind that Bessie Wilde has been reared as the heiress of Ashurst, while the other child, the true scion of that family, was left with strangers, who were ignorant of the name and station to which she was born.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Ashley here clasped her hands, and sat several moments staring into vacancy, as she wildly muttered:</p> 
               <p>"What is to come next? Oh! merciful Father, how has he discovered this?"</p> 
               <p>Her keen anxiety drove her to learn the worst, and she again lifted the paper, and read on:</p>

                           <p>"Shall I tell you how I have made this discovery? By simple and most providential means. A youth I love met Miss <emph>Ashley</emph> at Niagara this summer. He is an artist,<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6346-00000038"/> and he brought away with him the fair image of <emph>your</emph> daughter in his heart. He transferred it to ivory, and showed it to me.</p> 
                           <p>"Do you wonder that I recognized her as the daughter of my friend when she looks at me with his eyes, smiles on me with his lips, and wears upon her brow the golden crown of hair so like that of my poor lost Frank.</p> 
                           <p>"So soon as the so-called Miss Ashley's connections were named, I <emph>knew</emph> that you had done even worse than break the heart of poor Wilde, and with my knowledge of your past, I needed no proof to convince me of the crime of which you have been guilty.</p> 
                           <p>"Yet, without that, I would not accuse you, Margaret.</p> 
                           <p>"At the time the discovery was made I was ill in bed, or I should at once have followed it up. On my recovery, I made such efforts as were possible to do so, but I have hitherto been baffled by not being able to ascertain the person to whom the true Miss Ashley was given.</p> 
                           <p>"My ship is on the eve of sailing, and I have been unable to complete my inquiries, but my cruise will not be a long one, and when I return I shall resume it with the determination to bring it to a successful issue. If it is necessary, I will find Hunter, the man who employed you to go to Judge Ashley's, and from him learn what I wish to know.</p> 
                           <p>"You have a breathing spell in which you may yourself right the wrong of which you have been guilty, to secure wealth for your own child. I am aware that a will exists binding her and young Wentworth together under the penalty of loss of fortune if they spurn the shackles <emph>you</emph> would impose upon them; for to <emph>your</emph> influence I can trace such a clause as that in the will of so just a man as Judge Ashley was.</p> 
                           <p>"Suffer Bessie to recede from that arrangement at once, for I am assured that she loves another. Ernest Delancey is worthy of her, and he will make her happy. Give her to him, and cleanse your soul from the accursed leprosy the love of luxury has spread over it.</p> 
                           <p>"When I return, if I find that you have scorned my advice-that you are still persevering in the sinful course that you have so long followed-I warn you to beware of the consequences. I swear to you that I will come down on you as an avalanche, without mercy, and without delay.</p>

               <p>"Lost! lost! <emph>all lost!</emph> Oh! Bessie-cruel, ungrateful girl-what have you done? Would you tear from me the last plank that is between me and the sea of disgrace and ruin into which that madman would plunge me?"</p> 
               <p>She sat nervously fingering the envelope, scarcely conscious of what she was doing, and for the moment her keen intellect and active mind were stunned by the sudden blow.</p> 
               <p>At length recovering herself, she sat up, threw back her hair from her brow, and muttered:</p> 
               <p>"This will never do. I must arouse myself to grapple with the difficulties that beset me, and find means to overcome them. First I must see what Bessie has to say for herself. Deceitful and secretive as her course toward me has been, I must still guard her from the evils this dreadful man threatens to bring upon us both. The artist-yes-she referred carelessly to him to mislead me. False-false girl! how little does she dream of the precipice on the edge of which she is hovering."</p> 
               <p>She slowly unclosed Bessie's letter, but her eyes glared on the opening words, and she made a motion as if she would crush the paper in her hands. It ran thus:</p>

His letter gave me freedom to choose another, and I have done so. You must be discreet enough to keep Frank's secret, for my father has no idea of what is going on, and I am afraid we shall have some trouble in bringing him to consent to the exchange of sisters. But we shall do it, you may be sure.</p> 
                           <p>"You may think that I should tell you something more about Mr. Delancey before I close my letter. He was a college ehum of Rufus Welby's, and is a young man of good family but little fortune. We first met at Niagara; he saved my life there-how, I will tell you when we meet; and before we parted we both knew that we loved each other, though no revelation in words was made.</p> 
                           <p>"He was suddenly called away to the sick-bed of a friend, and we did not see him again until we arrived at this place on our way to New York. We shall leave tomorrow <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> for the South; but I felt that I must not delay an hour in assuring you that my earthly destiny, so far as marriage is concerned, <emph>is</emph> finally settled.</p> 
                           <p>"Last night Mr. Delancey found an opportunity to declare his love; he told me that he is aware of the sacrifice of fortune I shall probably be called on to make if I break the ties that bind me to Frank; but with the belief that I manifested a preference for himself, he felt that I had a right to decide my own fate.</p> 
                           <p>"He offered me the love of his noble heart, and a bare independence. Frank could give me wealth, but he said if he had not greatly mistaken me, he believed that I would follow the dictates of my own heart regardless of worldly influences.</p> 
                            
                           <p>"Oh, Minny, while Ernest spoke thus, if I had been base enough to cling to the sordid gold poor Frank could give me, I could never have escaped from the fascinating power of his glorious eyes, his persuasive voice, and I have yielded the consent he asked, even if my heart had not gone entirely over to him and the cause he was so eloquently pleading.</p> 
                           <p>"But I will confess to you that it had long before played the traitor to what you consider my <emph>interests,</emph> and I had but one reply to give. Of course you know what that was, but you can never know the fervent truth, the perfect trust with which I pledged my heart and life to this noble-noble wooer of mine.</p> 
                           <p>"Make up your mind to receive him as my future husband-to give him your spoiled darling, for Fate has written the irrevocable decree that if any man ever calls me wife, that one will be Ernest Delancey.</p> 
                           <p>"A few more days, and I shall be with you to tell you all, and to convince you how impossible it is that Frank and I should ever have been happy together.</p> 
                           <p>"In December Kate Welby and Mr. Ellery of New York will be united; Mr. Delancey is to be first groomsman, and, of course, I am to be first bridesmaid. If my unknown father is not the most unreasonable of men, he will permit my marriage to follow soon after. Ernest wishes as soon as possible to return to Italy, which country will probably become our future home. Of course, we expect you to accompany us, for I could not be perfectly contented if so widely severed from my dear Minny. You can leave Frank to take possession of Ashurst with his chosen one, for I am determined he shall be rewarded for the desertion of one sister by obtaining the hand of the other, and far dearer one.</p>

               <p>The spirit of joy and love which pervaded this effusion did not move Mrs. Ashley. She was bitter, hard and ruthless in her determination to adhere to the plan she had so long matured-had so nearly, at one time, brought to a<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6346-00000040"/> triumphant conclusion, and she breathed through her white lips:</p> 
               <p>"Stuff! girlish sentimental nonsense! Older and wiser heads must decide on what is best for her prosperity and eventual happiness. How can the creature who has been reared in the very lap of luxury and indulgence, find even contentment in the mean and drudging life she must lead as the wife of a poor artist? She knows nothing of the hardships she must encounter, and the glamour of passion induces her to believe that she can bear everything for the sake of him she loves.</p> 
               <p>"No, no, no-Bessie shall <emph>never</emph> wed any but Frank, and with Mr. Ashley's aid, I will make her his wife before that officious meddler can return. <emph>Her</emph> future safe, I can easily evade John Martin, or turn aside his evil interference with what does not concern him. Now for Frank, and his missive.</p>

                           <p>"DEAR MINNY-In a few more days we shall leave this place on a fast steamer, and very soon after this reaches you, I hope we shall be safe in Baltimore.</p> 
                           <p>"I trust that we shall find Arden Place in readiness for the reception of my uncle, as I do not think you would find him an agreeable inmate at Ashurst. I am afraid that you will like neither himself nor his wife, though I know you will be attracted by the sweet charm my cousin Evelyn possesses for all who approach her nearly. She will atone in some measure for the annoyance the boy is sure to give you.</p> 
                           <p>"Oh! such an <foreign xml:lang="FRA">enfant terrible</foreign> as Maitland is! I can give you no idea of him before you see him; but 'sufficient to the day is the evil thereof.' I only hope that in the freedom of country life he will take to hunting and fishing; for he has my permission to become a veritable Orson, provided he will free his sister from his persecutions.</p> 
                           <p>"Oh, Minny, I wish I only dared open my heart to you; but you would accuse me of perfidy, perhaps. It matters not; Bessie will exonorate me from blame, and prove to you that there is something in life more valuable than gold, more precious than the hoarded wealth of all the misers under the sun.</p> 
                           <p>"I am writing nonsense, you think, but I am basking in the sunshine of happiness so rare and new to me, that I believe it has half turned my head.</p> 
                           <p>"My uncle is partially restored to health, and anticipates his return to his old home with immense satisfaction. I hope Bessie will be there by the time we arrive, for he did not seem very well pleased that she had gone on a tour of pleasure so soon after her grandfather's death. The state of her health he believed a mere excuse, for it is one of my but uncle's peculiarities to think that no one can be really ill himself. I am afraid that he is tyrannical, and poor Bessie, with her high spirit, will have a hard time with him if-</p> 
                           <p>"I have not a moment more to spend in writing, so I must bid you an abrupt farewell.</p>

               <p>"I can finish your last sentence for you Mr. Frank Wentworth," muttered Mrs. Ashley, with curling lips, as she crushed his letter in her hand, and threw it from her. "If Bessie does not soon gain a protector for herself; <emph>that</emph> was what you meant to say, and what I mean to accomplish in my own way, in spite all the opposition you may both offer. In spite of <emph>your</emph> clearly hinted passion for Evelyn Ashley-in spite of Bessie's infatuation about this young artist-will I make her your wife. I have not worked, manuvred, planned for years to bring this marriage about, to be circumvented by two silly children, who do not seem to understand what is good for them. My sentimental pair, I shall yet have the satisfaction of seeing you brought to your sober senses, settling down into a very respectable Darby and Joan, quietly enjoying the fortune my tact has secured for you."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley spent several hours in deep reflection, then ordered her horse, and followed by Sambo on the<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6346-00000041"/> pony, she rode over to Arden Place to see if her orders had been properly carried out.</p> 
               <p>Many painful thoughts crowded upon her mind, and strange as it was, the most of them were given to the uncertain fate of the child she had thrown among strangers. From the day the infant was given to Mrs. Allen, she had sedulously turned her thoughts from her, laying the flattering unction to her soul that the little Evelyn was rich, and idolized in her new home; but the demand of Captain Martin that justice should be done to this forsaken child, first awoke her to a true sense of her guilt in throwing her upon the charity of others as she had done.</p> 
               <p>She clearly saw that the one evil deed had moulded all her future life; but deeply as it might now be repented, she believed it was too late to atone.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">HOME AGAIN.</head> 
               <p>THE old homestead of Arden Place had for years worn a most desolate aspect; but of late it had assumed a far different appearance. The lawn had been cleared of the underwood which had gradually encroached upon it; the trees and shrubs were trimmed; and the bright light of the sun was again admitted to the moss-grown structure in which the voice of welcome had been so long unheard.</p> 
               <p>Since the departure of Grace Arden for Cape May, eighteen years before, the house had been given up to the occupation of rats and spiders, the overseer of the estate only visiting it occasionally to have it aired and thoroughly cleaned.</p> 
                
               <p>When an order from Mr. Ashley for the renovation of the place came over to the agent, painters and paperers were set to work, and every necessary repair was made to render it an agreeable and elegant abode. When assured that it was positively the intention of her step-son to return to Maryland and take up his residence there, Mrs. Ashley went over herself, inspected the unpacking of carpets, curtains, and household linen, and had them arranged in the best manner.</p> 
               <p>But the faded old-fashioned appearance of the furniture would, she felt assured, be repulsive to the luxurious taste of its future occupant, and she exercised the discretion confided to her to order all that was necessary to fit up the place in an elegant and comfortable manner.</p> 
               <p>An upholsterer was sent for from Baltimore, and under his tasteful superintendence the old halls soon wore an entirely new appearance. Light and elegantly ornamented paper covered the sombre oak panelling which had grown nearly black with age. Gay draperies and new carpets entirely changed the aspect of the lower portion of the house, though the upper rooms were left with the dark grained walls in their original state.</p> 
               <p>Modern furniture had been placed in them all, and as Mrs. Ashley walked through the house, she thought everything that was possible had been done to contribute to comfort or gratify good taste.</p> 
               <p>A corps of efficient servants had been installed in their places, and the visitor saw with satisfaction that everything was in readiness for the reception of the man whose advent she so deeply dreaded that she was actually nervous at the thought that anything might be neglected which would give him offence.</p> 
               <p>More than once she murmured:</p> 
               <p>"I am a simpleton and a slave to feel thus. Why<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6346-00000042"/> should I fear Leon Ashley's anger? I am entitled to respect as the widow of his father, and why shall I doubt my power to fascinate him and bend him to my will, as I have done with others-such power as induced Judge Ashley, haughty as he was, to lift me from the depths of poverty and humiliation to share his own prosperity. At this crisis, when <emph>everything</emph> is at stake, it surely will not fail me."</p> 
               <p>Thus meditating, she sat in the wide hall after making her tour of inspection. She was aroused by the sound of approaching wheels, and looking down the avenue, saw a carriage driven leisurely toward the house attended by a gentleman on horseback, in whom she instantly recognized Frank Wentworth.</p> 
               <p>Summoning all her self-control, Mrs. Ashley went out on the portico to meet them, and Frank no sooner saw her well-known form than he put spurs to his horse and dashing forward, was soon at the foot of the steps. In another instant he was bounding up them, exclaiming:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Minny, dear, dear Minny! I am so glad to meet you again! Is Bessie here with you to greet her father? I know he will expect to see her immediately."</p> 
               <p>She suffered him to press his lips upon her brow, and then gravely replied:</p> 
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> are most welcome to me, Frank, as you always must be; but I could have wished that Mr. Ashley's family had deferred their arrival a few days longer. I am sorry to tell you that Bessie is not here; I am looking for her every hour, but she has not yet returned to Ashurst."</p> 
               <p>"Hem! I do hope that my uncle will have respect enough for you to behave himself like a gentleman when he hears this. He is a very violent man at times, Minny, and it is best to put you on your guard before you meet him."</p> 
               <p>She carelessly replied:</p> 
                
               <p>"Have no fears on my account; I shall find means to manage him, be sure of that. But here they are at the door."</p> 
               <p>Frank only paused to say:</p> 
               <p>"If any one can do that, you will, Minny," and bounded down the steps in time to open the carriage door and hand out a petite figure who stepped to the ground with the grace of a fairy queen.</p> 
               <p>Next came Maitland skipping out after her, without respect to her travelling dress, on the skirt of which he trampled in his rush toward the house. He cried out:</p> 
               <p>"Eh! but it's a jolly old place, sure enough! And this is <emph>your</emph> house, Evy, and your are the last of the Ardens. Hooray! I wish I was in your shoes, that's all!"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Ashley, with the assistance of Wentworth, had slowly gained terra firma, and as Maitland incautiously ventured within reach of his arm, he seized him by the shoulder and shaking him, sternly said:</p> 
               <p>"Be quiet, sir! You have racked my nerves to pieces while in the carriage, and now you begin your nonsense anew as soon as I am released from it. Be quiet, or I will have you sent off to bed at once."</p> 
               <p>"No you won't, either, for I sha'nt go-so there! I <emph>am</emph> glad to see what a fine house Evy has, and I'm to say what I please about it without being sent to bed either," and the incorrigible twisted himself from his father's grasp and ran up the steps.</p> 
               <p>In excuse his mother feebly said:</p> 
               <p>"His spirits have overflowed all bounds at seeing the place he has heard so much about. If we just let him alone, dear Leon, they will exhaust themselves, and Maty will be sorry for his rudeness to you."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Sorry,</emph> Madam! the brat does not know what the feeling is. Thanks to <emph>your</emph> training, he has become a perfect<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6346-00000043"/> pest and a hard-hearted little monster who cares no more for my sufferings than he does for those of the merest stranger. Sorry indeed!"</p> 
               <p>This rude speech was made as they ascended the steps, and fully within hearing of Mrs. Ashley, who regarded the broken-down wreck that approached her with mingled feelings of repulsion and fear.</p> 
               <p>Far different was the impression she herself made on Ashley. In her deep mourning dress, with her dazzling complexion and brown hair, the beauty and abundance of which was scarcely concealed by her widow's cap, she was a most striking and attractive object, and contrasted with the faded, wan-looking Augusta, she seemed in the first freshness of youth.</p> 
               <p>Grace and elegance always commanded the homage of Ashley, and he bowed low before the fair syren who held out her small hand and smiled on him with that gracious sweetness that never failed to enchant all who approached her.</p> 
               <p>Her soft, vibrant voice dwelt pleasantly on his ear after she had finished speaking her words of welcome, and he courteously replied:</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, Madam, for your kindness in coming hither to meet us; for the care you have evidently taken to have everything prepared for our reception. I have heard much of you, Mrs. Ashley, both from my father and from Frank; but until this moment I had no idea that an angel had condescended to become the soother of the old man's last days."</p> 
               <p>Her soft laugh rang out like music on the evening air, and she replied:</p> 
               <p>"I perceive that you are a flatterer, Mr. Ashley, and I shall take your compliments for what they are worth. But let us go in; your wife and daughter look wearied with the long journey they have made."</p> 
               <p>With a slighting glance toward them, he said:</p> 
                
               <p>"Oh, they are in perfect health, and have no right to feel tired when I am not, for <emph>I</emph> am the only invalid in the crowd. I wish to take a glance around the place before I go in. But where is my daughter Bessie? I supposed that she would be the first one to welcome me to my native land."</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry to tell you that she has not yet returned home. You know that Bessie is dependant on the movements of those with whom she is travelling, and she could not hasten them on account of her desire to be here in time to meet you."</p> 
               <p>His face darkened and he brusquely said:</p> 
               <p>"Then she should have left them, Madam, and have come on alone. I do not tolerate neglect from those whose duty it is to obey my slightest wish, and Bessie, I must say, has shown a degree of indifference to my commands that I find extremely displeasing to me."</p> 
               <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Ashley," she replied, with a slight tone of annoyance in her voice, "but I did not convey your commands to Bessie. I believed she would be at home before you could possibly reach this place, and I left her to return with her friends when they were ready to do so. It was my fault, and if there is blame attached to any one, you must lay it entirely on me."</p> 
               <p>He bowed stiffly, glanced into her pleading face, and did what most other men would have done-forgave her. He less rudely said:</p> 
               <p>"So fair an advocate, Madam, must needs prevail. I hope that I shall find my unknown daughter as lovely and attractive as the fair woman who has had the training of her. If so, I shall be quite satisfied with her, even if she should not prove quite as submissive as the one I have had under my own eye. She will be broken in time, and learn that <emph>my</emph> will is to be her law."</p> 
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6346-00000044"/> 
               <p>"I fervently hope it may prove so, in one thing at least," thought Mrs. Ashley, though she could not repress a shudder when he called Bessie his daughter and claimed the authority of a parent over her future fate.</p> 
               <p>She was at last permitted to exchange a few words with the two ladies, who meekly awaited the good pleasure of their autocrat, and gladly followed his lead into the house; for the unruliness of Maitland and the ill-temper of Ashley during their drive from the station had completely exhausted them.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley was amply rewarded for all the trouble she had taken to have the house in proper order by the praise which was freely lavished on the improvements she had made. Both husband and wife seemed charmed with every arrangement, and before tea was brought in she began to feel as if the ground beneath her feet was growing less slippery with every passing moment.</p> 
               <p>With her quick perception of character, she measured this man who had rendered himself so great a terror to every one nearly connected with him, and she serenely triumphed in the thought that a few weeks of daily intercourse would give her as perfect control over him as she had once held over his father.</p> 
               <p>She saw at once that Augusta had ceased to flatter him, which, with such a man as Ashley, was a fatal mistake; for that, she felt assured, was the surest road to success with a weak, vain, and selfish being, such as he evidently was. With the subtle power she possessed to wind herself into the confidence of all who approached her intimately, Mrs. Ashley never for one instant doubted her perfect success, and her spirits rose with the consciousness of power that filled her mind.</p> 
               <p>Attracted by her soft voice and engaging manner, Evelyn had drawn near her, and sat drinking in her words as those of an oracle. She suddenly turned toward the young girl, and laying her hand upon her dusky locks, smilingly said:</p> 
               <p>"<emph>This</emph> daughter is a true scion of the Ashley race, for she possesses the dark charm of their most lovely women. But when you see Bessie, you will think that an oreole has been introduced into a raven's nest, for she has radiant auburn hair, and a complexion even fairer than mine."</p> 
               <p>A change that was inexplicable to her came over Ashley's face, and he hastened to say:</p> 
               <p>"Ah! say you so! I am glad to hear that Bessie is a fair woman, for blondes are my adoration. Her mother was fair, though where she gets the auburn tinge in her hair I am sure I cannot tell. Every Ashley I have seen was dark, and often fierce-looking, as the old pictures at Ashurst will prove."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>This one</emph> is soft and lovely enough in her lineaments to satisfy the most fastidious taste," replied Mrs. Ashley, again referring to Evelyn, in the hope that the singular expression which had just now startled her would again flit over his face. But she was baffled-by this time Ashley had controlled himself, though she detected a furtive, half-scared glance darted by Augusta toward her husband, which still further puzzled her.</p> 
               <p>"I will watch, and find out what that means," she thought; but by this time twilight began to gather, and she arose and asked to have her horse brought around, as she must return to Ashurst before nightfall. Frank declared his intention to accompany her, and went out to see that the horses were ready.</p> 
               <p>With charming courtesy Mrs. Ashley made her parting adieux, and ended by saying:</p> 
               <p>"I will give you two days to recover from your fatigue, but on the third one I shall expect you all to dine at Ashurst,<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6346-00000045"/> and by that time I hope my dear truant will be there to help me entertain you. You must not think of taking Bessie from me, Mr. Ashley, for my life would be too dreary to be borne without her bright presence at Ashurst."</p> 
               <p>He graciously replied:</p> 
               <p>"I will think of it, Madam, and perhaps I may accede to your request. I find <emph>one</emph> daughter trouble enough to manage, and I may find two too much for me altogether. You shall in time know my decision."</p> 
               <p>With this vague promise Mrs. Ashley was compelled to content herself, and she set out for Ashurst with Frank.</p> 
               <p>They had scarcely gained the open road before he impetuously asked:</p> 
               <p>"Were you not charmed with the appearance of Evelyn? Oh, Minny, the poor girl needs a friend so much, that I do hope you will be one to her. Of late her father has treated her with such harshness that-that at times I scarcely know how to keep on decent terms with him."</p> 
               <p>She turned her piercing eyes on him, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"What has Evelyn lately done to exasperate him? You hinted nothing of this in your letter?"</p> 
               <p>"He never was a good father to her, but I said little of it because one does not care to write such things about their relations."</p> 
               <p>"But you said that of late he has treated her with less consideration than usual."</p> 
               <p>"Yes-he begins to suspect that Evelyn may wish to have some one to protect her from his outbreaks of temper, and he has become perfectly savage to her."</p> 
               <p>"Of course, such a man as Leon Ashley will be capable of any species of brutality toward this poor girl if she betrays the least inclination to give another the power to wrest from him the control of her fortune. <emph>That</emph> is all he values her for, and it is my conviction that he will never permit Evelyn to marry at all."</p> 
               <p>"But he shall-he must," exclaimed Frank, in an excited manner. "What! shall a being so sensitive, so delicately organized as my poor Evelyn, be condemned to endure the coarse abuse her father often pours upon her, without the hope of rescue from his tyranny. If so, her span of life will be shortened, and she will sink into a premature grave."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley coolly replied:</p> 
               <p>"If she survives the age at which she can legally make a will, I imagine her father will not grieve much. It evidently chafes him to feel that he is not absolute master of the estate. Did you mark how angrily he spoke to Maitland, when he called the place Evelyn's home?"</p> 
               <p>"Minny, your acuteness is as trenchant as that of the most experienced detective," said Wentworth, with surprise. "This feeling on the part of my uncle was gradually forced on my notice, but you have fathomed it in the first hour of your acquaintance with him."</p> 
               <p>"I have always been a keen analyzer of character," she carelessly replied, "and I think it does not take very clear eyes to comprehend that of Mr. Ashley. I trust that I shall be able to influence him to milder measures toward Evelyn than he seems of late to have pursued. But understand me, Frank, and believe me when I tell you that if <emph>you</emph> are the protector to whom you just now referred, I shall do nothing to soften Mr. Ashley's prejudices against a marriage which would set at naught the wishes of your grandfather. I am bound to consider them before everything else, and, if possible, carry them into effect."</p> 
               <p>A cold chill fell on the impetuous heart of the young man, and he indignantly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Would you do this at the sacrifice of every hope in<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6346-00000046"/> life both to Bessie and myself? Minny, I believed you to be a just and tender-hearted woman, but if you talk in this strain I shall lose my faith in you. I <emph>know</emph> that Bessie never loved me; her life was almost sacrificed in the struggle which took place before I went away, and do you think that I have only returned here to bind upon her the odious shackles forged by others? No-Heaven forbid! We are both free to choose, and we have done so. I <emph>am</emph> the person referred to as the lover of Evelyn, and I have good reason to believe that Bessie has found the arbiter of her destiny during this summer tour."</p> 
               <p>"My dear Frank," said the dulcet voice, "don't talk nonsense. You know that neither of you is free to choose. Should you and Bessie mutually renounce the provisions of Judge Ashley's will, what is to prevent the heir at law from claiming and gaining it? Think what use he will make of it-how soon it will be scattered to the winds-and listen to the voice of reason and conscience, which tells you that you owe it to the memory of the man who rescued you from poverty, and made you what you are, to fulfil the wish that lay nearest his heart."</p> 
               <p>Frank listened impatiently to this appeal, and he hastily said:</p> 
               <p>"I have the deepest respect for the memory of my grandfather, Minny, but I have something to tell you about this. On that last night of his life, when we talked together on family matters, he expressed regret that he had bound Bessie and myself to any such compact, and it is my belief that if he had lived longer, he would have altered his will in that respect. Convinced of this in my own mind, I am not disposed to give undue weight to his wishes. Under any circumstances, I consider it wrong to sacrifice the happiness of the living to a whim of the dead."</p> 
               <p>"My dear Frank, I beg that you will not be irreverent in speaking of him who can no longer defend his own wishes. <emph>I</emph> have no right to insist that the contract between yourself and Bessie shall be fulfilled, but Mr. Ashley <emph>has,</emph> and he will no more consent to give you one daughter, than he will agree to your deserting the other. If Bessie has any other fancy, it is a mere passing dream, which will soon lose all its charm. Sentimentally as you both talk of poverty, neither she nor you could endure it with equanimity for a single month. Yet such must be your portion if you give up this fine estate for a mere chimera. Why, Frank, half the people that marry for what they call love, in less than six months heartily wish they had never seen each other; and if such a giddy-brain as Bessie were allowed to fix her own destiny in poverty and obscurity, she would blame me throughout all her life for not even coercing her will."</p> 
               <p>The young man rode gloomily beside her for some distance without replying, and Mrs. Ashley at length asked:</p> 
               <p>"Has anything passed between Mr. Ashley and yourself with reference to Evelyn? I thought you seemed rather cool toward each other, and his daughter appeared to be afraid to look toward you, though I saw her turn her head involuntarily whenever you spoke."</p> 
               <p>"You see everything, Minny," he bitterly replied, "but you seem to look on as coolly as if you were an uninterested spectator. I will answer you candidly: a great deal has passed between Mr. Ashley and myself on this subject. That odious little marplot, Maitland, quizzed his sister about me in the presence of his mother. That set Aunt Augusta on the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">qui vive;</foreign> she watched us stealthily, and conveyed her discoveries to her husband. When we were thrown daily together upon the ship, I was not so guarded as I should have been, and-and-in short, we both betrayed<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6346-00000047"/> trayed ourselves, and such a scene as ensued you can never imagine. It makes my blood boil and then turn to ice when I even think of it."</p> 
               <p>He paused, and Mrs. Ashley said:</p> 
               <p>"Can you not give me an idea of what happened?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes-that is easily attempted. My uncle sent for me and taxed me with trying to turn the head of his daughter by flatteries I had now no right to address to any other woman than Bessie. I at once replied to him that all was over between her and myself, and told him that the strongest desire of my heart was to win Evelyn to become my wife. I gave him an account of what happened before I left Ashurst, and assured him that Bessie would no more consent to ratify the contract that bound us to each other than I would."</p> 
               <p>"And what did he say to that?" she asked, with vivid interest.</p> 
               <p>"You may well ask me that. He became so furious with passion that he was near never saying anything again. For some time after I finished speaking he was livid and speechless with the rage that filled him. But when he <emph>did</emph> recover, such a torrent of abusive wrath as he poured out on Evelyn and myself you never could suppose would be uttered by any man claiming to be a gentleman. He sent for her to come to him, that he might join us together in his anathemas.</p> 
               <p>"My uncle vowed that if she took her sister's betrothed from her, he would never forgive her-never see her again, and he frightened the poor girl into giving him a promise that she would never marry any one without his consent. He then tried to exact a pledge from me; he affected to believe that I am in honor bound to Bessie; but I refused to give him any such hold on me.</p> 
               <p>"Since that day, he and his wife have set themselves as spies on Evelyn and myself, and I have scarcely been able to exchange a word with her. She is persecuted, Minny, and made miserable on my account, yet I am not permitted to speak a word of hope or consolation to her. If this state of affairs continues much longer, I believe that I shall grow wild."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley saw that the poor fellow was terribly in earnest; that he was suffering deeply in mind; and she soothingly said:</p> 
               <p>"If I could help you, Frank, I certainly should make the attempt, much as it would militate against your true interests; but I am powerless. Mr. Ashley has absolute control over his daughter, and if he has set his mind against her marrying, he will be sure to keep her single. After the promise she gave, I can see no hope for the poor thing, for she will be held as a hostage for the enjoyment of her fortune."</p> 
               <p>Frank groaned, gnashed his teeth at such consolation as this, and striking his spurs in his horse's flanks, dashed up the avenue toward Ashurst at a break-neck pace.</p> 
               <p>By the time Mrs. Ashley gained the door she found him dismounted, and the centre of a group of servants who were expressing their delight at seeing him again in their demonstrative manner. He had scarcely finished the innumerable questions they had to ask, before a messenger came over from the Oaks to say that the travellers were expected on the night train, and if Mrs. Ashley would send her carriage to the depot, she would have her darling with her by eleven o'clock.</p> 
               <p>The carriage was at once ordered, and Mrs. Ashley would have gone herself to meet Bessie, but Wentworth insisted that she should not fatigue herself by a night drive; he would go alone, and enjoy a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tte--tte</foreign> with Bessie on their return to Ashurst.</p> 
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6346-00000048"/> 
               <p>Hoping that some good might arise from such a communion, Mrs. Ashley submitted to remain at home, while Frank went to meet her daughter.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">FRANK AND BESSIE.</head> 
               <p>IT was six miles to the station, and the time consumed in going over the ground was spent by Frank in gloomy anticipations of the future. His uncle had proved so utterly unmanageable, that he almost despaired of winning his consent to give him Evelyn at the expense of any sacrifice he might be willing to make.</p> 
               <p>He plainly saw that, if necessary, even force would be used to link Bessie's fate with his own; since Evelyn was placed beyond his reach, Frank felt almost indifferent as to what might happen to himself; but with the high spirit and vigorous will of Bessie, he felt sure that a struggle between his uncle and herself must ensue, and he was doubtful which would conquer in the end; the one with passion and power on his side, the other with right and justice on hers.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Ashley had already crushed one child into abject submission to his will, and he feared that it would only be a question of time as to the ultimate subjection of the other.</p> 
               <p>The carriage reached the station just as the train was leaving, and a group of travellers were standing on the platform among whom Frank recognized Bessie. The moon was shining brightly, and her eager glance fell on him as he mounted the steps. She sprang forward, exclaiming:</p> 
                
               <p>"Frank! is it possible that you are here before me? Of course, my pa-all the rest have come with you?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes-all are safe at Arden Place, and Minny sent me over to take you to her. We only arrived here a few hours before you, and there was much disappointment that you were not at home to welcome us."</p> 
               <p>"I had no idea that you would be at Ashurst so soon, or I would have been here. Was-was my father hurt or offended at my absence, Frank?"</p> 
               <p>"I cannot answer questions now, Bessie. Wait till we are together in the carriage, and then I will tell you everything you may wish to know."</p> 
               <p>The Welby family now gathered around him with questions as to his tour, and congratulations on his safe return, and for the next ten minutes Frank was oblivious of his own troubles while listening to the gay and buoyant account Kate gave him of her northern sojourn.</p> 
               <p>When they parted Mr. Welby said:</p> 
               <p>"Tell your uncle that I shall call on him in a few days, Frank, and say to Mrs. Leon Ashley that Mrs. Welby and my daughter will also make the acquaintance of herself and Miss Evelyn Ashley as soon as possible."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you sir; I will be sure to tell them."</p> 
               <p>"And, Frank, I say," cried out Rufus-"inform that pretty dark-eyed fairy who calls herself your cousin, that <emph>I</emph> am coming to throw myself at her feet. I think we shall make a charming miniature couple, from the description I have had of her."</p> 
               <p>"I thought people preferred their opposites. You should fall in love with a giantess, Rufus."</p> 
               <p>"While <emph>you</emph> run off with the fairy, I suppose."</p> 
               <p>The carriages drew up and the war of words ceased; the two girls promised to see each other every day on which it was possible to do so, and they parted.</p> 
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6346-00000049"/> 
               <p>When Bessie found herself seated beside Frank and on her way to Ashurst, a sudden feeling of shyness came over her. She sat silent, thinking over what had happened on the day of their last parting, until Frank roused himself to say:</p> 
               <p>"I hope you had a pleasant trip, Bessie."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, charming-delightful! I am afraid I shall never be so happy again," and she ended with a little sigh.</p> 
               <p>Wentworth paused a few moments, and then gained courage to ask:</p> 
               <p>"Am I wrong in my suspicions, Bessie? From the tone of your last letters I inferred that-that you have met with one on whom you would more willingly bestow your hand than on me. Is it not so?"</p> 
               <p>She evasively replied:</p> 
               <p>"I never professed to love you except as a brother, you know, Frank; and if I am not mistaken, you have discovered that my sister is far more to your taste than I am."</p> 
               <p>"I will be more candid with you, Bessie, than you appear willing to be with me. I love Evelyn, but your father declares that he will never consent to give her to me. His heart seems to be set on the marriage my grandfather desired. I begin almost to feel as if we are puppets in his hands, and my uncle will fashion the fate of all of us to suit himself."</p> 
               <p>Bessie impetuously replied:</p> 
               <p>"Then you are more of a craven than I ever dreamed you could be, Frank Wentworth! I tell you that <emph>no one,</emph> not even my own father, shall decide for me the most important transaction of my life. I <emph>have</emph> found one to whom I have pledged the life of my life-my heart, my spirit-all within my soul that thrills to the noble and the true, and it shall be torn from me by violence sooner than I will myself consent to outrage it by giving Ernest a rival. Oh, Frank! if you knew what it is to love as I do, you would not dare to speak as you did just now."</p> 
               <p>Wentworth could not see her face, but the thrilling tones of her voice, the impassioned utterance, told their own tale. The listener knew that Bessie was as impulsive as in days of yore, and her love for another had only intensified her repugnance to the union of interests on which Mrs. Ashley so strongly insisted. He warmly said:</p> 
               <p>"I am glad that you have come with unworn energies and unbroken courage to confront your father's will. It is of iron, Bessie, and I much fear that he will yet find means to bend you to his purpose. He has crushed Evelyn's resistance; has separated her from me as effectually as if an ocean rolled between us, and you will yet see what he will accomplish toward bringing you into subjection."</p> 
               <p>"He may try, but he will find that when he and I meet on this battle-field, it will be as Greek encounters Greek. I owe him nothing; he has done nothing for me; given me nothing-then why shall he assume authority over me? I will resist it from the very first, and continue to do so to the end. Oh, Frank! I dread this man, even if he is my father. I have no filial feeling toward him, and some instinct tells me that he is my bitter foe. Your words only confirm the presentiments that have haunted me since I heard he was coming hither. The spirit of my poor, deserted mother must rise up within me and bid me close my heart against him."</p> 
               <p>"You know that sad story then, Bessie. But are you aware that more than one cause led to the expatriation of my uncle?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes-I know how my mother was treated; I have heard of the duel and its consequences. When I once obtained a clue to it, I dragged the whole story out of Minny by my importunities. When they wished to send<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6346-00000050"/> me to Europe with you, they told me of my exiled father to induce me to go with you to visit him. Oh, Frank! we should thank God every hour of our lives that we did not bind ourselves irrevocably together on that day. You love Evelyn, and if you are the same being you once were, you will never give up the hope of calling her your own while youth and energy last. I declare to you that no amount of persecution shall finally sever me from him to whom I have pledged my troth."</p> 
               <p>For the first time since the moment of meeting, Went-worth took her hand in his own and fervently pressing it, said:</p> 
               <p>"You give me new life, Bessie; new powers of resistance to the tyranny that has acted as a blighting incubus upon me. But let me advise you on one point:-do not too soon show your repugnance to comply with your father's wishes. He admires your style of beauty, and rude as he is, you may chance to win the power to soften him a little in our favor. I have already offered every pecuniary inducement that I believed might influence him, but he spurns them all. Since he has discovered the attachment of Evelyn and myself, he refuses to listen to any compromise from me."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Frank, for furnishing me with the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">carte du pays</foreign> before I encounter this formidable papa of mine. 'Forewarned is forearmed,' you know, and I intend to crush down my native impetuosity and become as wary as the fox, as subtle as the serpent, in my intercourse with him."</p> 
               <p>"As if you <emph>could</emph> do that! I should as soon expect the leopard to change his spots, as such an outspoken virago as you are to be circumspect and prudent with your exacting father," said Frank, with a touch of his old playfulness. "Heigho! there are the lights from Ashurst, and I must tell you before you meet Minny that she has gone over to the enemy. She is as keen to drive us in each other's arms as she was before I went away."</p> 
               <p>"Never fear, Frank; I can manage Minny, and I will make her help me to manage papa. See if I don't. You and Evelyn shall yet walk hand in hand through life, and I will lead my will-o'-the-wisp existence with my painter laddie, helping him to bear the narrow fortune fate has allotted him."</p> 
               <p>The cheerful tones of her fresh young voice found an echo in the desponding heart of Wentworth, and by the time the carriage drew up in front of Ashurst, he had brightened up so much that Mrs. Ashley drew a good augury from the glimpse she obtained of his face as he sprang from the vehicle.</p> 
               <p>The sound of wheels had brought her out, and in another moment the darling of her heart was clasped in her arms. She murmured:</p> 
               <p>"Oh! my precious one, do I hold you to my breast again-safe, well, and happy as I would wish you always to be? My Bessie-my darling-I never knew how dear you are to me till we were separated. I have looked forward to this hour of reunion with a yearning wistfulness that words may never express."</p> 
               <p>"I am as happy as a queen, Minny, and glad to get back to you again; oh! so glad; for I have missed you every day, though I had so much that was novel to amuse and interest me."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley unwound her clinging arms, and holding Bessie off, looked at her charming face with a fulness of joy she rarely felt. In this first moment of meeting it was happiness enough to have that radiant creature near her-to hear the sound of her voice-to watch the light of her lovely eyes. She murmured:</p> 
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6346-00000051"/> 
               <p>"You are more charming than ever, Bessie. But oh! my love, do not fascinate Mr. Ashley so much as to induce him to take you from me. I could not bear that."</p> 
               <p>The mention of Ashley brought a cloud over the bright face, and Bessie decisively replied:</p> 
               <p>"There is no danger of that, Minny. I do not intend to be separated from my best friend, not even by my father. But here comes Uncle Jupe to assure himself that I have actually returned, and not abjured the home of my infancy as Aunt Ellinor did. I am glad to see you looking so well, Uncle Jupe."</p> 
               <p>"I is only so-so, Miss Bessie; I 'gins to feel mighty painful now de summer's gone. I clar' dat I is real glad to see dat you an' Marse Frank is a makin' up to each other agin, an' I hopes de ole house 'll soon be merry wi' de weddin'. 'Scuse me, Missy, but I allers did say what I thought, an' my ole marster never 'fused me dat much lib'ty."</p> 
               <p>Frank spoke more sharply to the old negro than he ever had done before in his life:</p> 
               <p>"There are some liberties which the freest man has no right to take, Uncle Jupe, and one of them is to bring a painful flush to a lady's cheeks. Come, Bessie, let us go in."</p> 
               <p>Wentworth would have drawn her forward, but she saw the crestfallen expression of the old man, and paused to say:</p> 
               <p>"Never mind Frank's reproof, uncle. You did not offend me; and if you will come to the house to-morrow after my trunks are unpacked, you will find that I have not forgotten the tobacco I promised to bring you."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Miss Bessie. You is a real lady, though you don't look a bit like de old stock," said the negro, as he hobbled away, making the assertion with which he invariably ended every encomium on Bessie.</p> 
                
               <p>A group of eager black faces were waiting in the hall, and Mrs. Ashley was compelled to surrender the young traveller for a few moments to receive the welcome of the servants who had known and loved her from her infancy.</p> 
               <p>Flushed, radiant and joyful, Bessie at length sat down to the late supper which had been prepared for her, but she was too much excited to eat, and after drinking a cup of coffee, she sat till a late hour with Frank and Mrs. Ashley, who seemed never sated with gazing on her sparkling face, never weary of listening to her beloved voice.</p> 
               <p>She had many incidents to relate-some burlesque, others sentimental, but she never once referred to the subject of her last letter to Mrs. Ashley, nor to the recent conversation held between Frank and herself.</p> 
               <p>Bessie was silently gathering her energies to defeat every effort made to alter the destiny to which she had sacredly pledged herself, and she did not care to argue on a subject on which her mind was already made up.</p> 
               <p>For so young a girl she had remarkable force and decision of character, and had Mrs. Ashley understood the resolute yet generous nature with which she had to deal, she would at once have changed her tactics and accepted the alternative offered her, painful as it was-much as it might compromise her own interests in the future.</p> 
               <p>They parted at a late hour of the night, and Bessie slept as soundly as youth and fatigue usually do. It was late the next morning when she awoke, and after making a graceful toilet, she descended, to find Mrs. Ashley and Wentworth waiting breakfast for her.</p> 
               <p>The latter looked up from his paper, and exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"I declare, you are greatly improved, Bessie. I wonder if the effect is due to your stylish morning dress, or if you have really found the elixir of beauty in your northern tour."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, coz; I fancy that I have only rubbed off<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6346-00000052"/> the rust of my country breeding, and gained a fashionable air; that is all."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley smiled and kissed her, though there was earnestness in the tone with which she said:</p> 
               <p>"If you have lost nothing good, and gained no evil in your absence, Bessie, I shall be more than satisfied. Externally you have certainly improved, and I think Mr. Ashley can do no less than approve of your appearance. I have dispatched a messenger to Arden Place, to announce your arrival, and to say that we will go over there immediately after breakfast. I have already ordered the carriage."</p> 
               <p>A slight shade passed over the fair face, and Bessie assumed her place at the table without reply. The smoking coffee, light muffins, and fresh shad from the Potomac were scarcely tasted, and when Frank finished the substantial breakfast he had made, he looked up at Bessie and asked:</p> 
               <p>"Do you live on air, cousin? You seem to eat nothing."</p> 
               <p>She laughed, and with a meaning glance, said:</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps I am practising for the time to come. The less I consume the less I shall cost in the days of poverty that loom before me."</p> 
               <p>A slight frown disfigured the smooth brow of Mrs. Ashley, and she motioned to the servant to leave the room. She then said:</p> 
               <p>"You speak lightly enough of what you do not understand. <emph>I</emph> have borne the yoke of poverty, Bessie, and I tell you that to those who have known better days, nothing is so depressing, so heart-sickening. I was not reared in luxury as <emph>you</emph> have been, but I felt its goad, and to escape from it I married a man old enough to have been my grandfather. I was happy with him-made him happy, as you both know, and if you will accept my experience, you will both escape the misery in the future which you are preparing for yourselves."</p> 
               <p>She spoke in an excited manner, and Wentworth looked at Bessie to see what reply she would make. She slightly changed color, but presently spoke with infinite sweetness:</p> 
               <p>"Dear Minny, both Frank and I know what a tender, self-sacrificing wife you were to your aged husband; but you should also know that no human being is satisfied with the experience of another. My cousin and I have agreed that any fate will be preferable to a union which would only join two antagonistic natures together. As husband and wife we could never harmonize, and, in the domestic sphere, lack of fortune can be better borne than an ever increasing discord. We refuse to fulfil the contract which was made for us, and with the best grounds for so doing, for we have both learned the lesson of love from other lips, from other eyes."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley uttered a faint cry, and covered her face with her handkerchief, that the emotions which swept over it should not be read by her companions. When she removed it, she was pale as marble, and apparently as firm in the resolution she had taken. She asked:</p> 
               <p>"Do you fully understand your true position, if you and Frank persist in this renunciation? Your father, prodigal, wasteful, and careless of others, will strip you of everything as heir-at-law; that is, unless a paper confided to me by Judge Ashley a few weeks before his death provides for such a contingency, and saves the estate from the clutches of his son."</p> 
               <p>"What paper do you allude to, Minny?" asked Frank, in great surprise. "How is it that its existence has never before been made known?"</p> 
               <p>"I have maintained silence about it because it was<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6346-00000053"/> given into my hands with an injunction of profound secrecy as to its existence. Only in the event of the refusal of Bessie and yourself to obey Judge Ashley's wishes, was it ever to be produced."</p> 
               <p>"That seems very singular, especially after what my grandfather said to me on this subject," said Frank thoughtfully.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley calmly replied:</p> 
               <p>"It was through Judge Ashley's great anxiety to prevent his son from inheriting his estate, that he executed this paper, which, he assured me, would effectually prevent him from claiming any portion of it. I am ignorant of its contents, and unless you and Bessie prove so wilful as to cast prosperity from you, they are never to become known. On the day of your marriage, the Judge commanded me to burn it unopened."</p> 
               <p>Wentworth dryly replied:</p> 
               <p>"The curiosity of those interested in its contents will certainly be gratified, for I assure you that after what has passed between Bessie and myself, our union is impossible. Even if Evelyn is forever severed from me by the will of a tyrannical father and her own weak submission, I would refuse to bind Bessie to me in bonds which would gall her rebellious heart till it broke, even if she consented to assume them."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley looked from one to the other in a sort of helpless dismay. She burst in tears, and wept so bitterly that Bessie was deeply moved. She knelt before her and penitently said:</p> 
               <p>"Minny, I have always known that you love me very dearly, but I scarcely thought the renunciation of fortune on my part could so bitterly distress you. Console yourself with the certainly that I shall gain happiness in exchange. Nor do I fear actual poverty. My lover has some fortune; he possesses genius and perseverance, and he must ultimately become distinguished in his art. Ernest has a small annual income, to which my three hundred a year will make a respectable addition in so cheap a country as Italy, for there we intend to live."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley regarded her almost with an expression of horror, as she gasped:</p> 
               <p>"Has it gone so far as that? Have you been calculating ways and means, and actually settled on your future place of residence without consulting me-<emph>me</emph> who-"</p> 
               <p>Her voice failed her, and hurt and offended by her gaze, Bessie arose and proudly said:</p> 
               <p>"I owe you much for the tender care you have bestowed on me from infancy, Mrs. Ashley, but it does not give you the right to settle my destiny, nor to reproach me in such a manner as you have seen fit to assume. If I have to answer for my contumacy, it must be to my father alone."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Father in Heaven, this is too much!" groaned the unhappy schemer. "<emph>Defied,</emph> and by <emph>her!</emph> but she does not know-she cannot know-how bitterly she wounds me!"</p> 
               <p>Though Bessie did not comprehend the bearing of her words, she keenly felt the reproach they implied, and she passionately said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Minny, why will you torture me thus? If I am satisfied with the lot I have chosen, why should you so strangely insist that I shall render myself miserable by becoming the torment of poor Frank's life? If you persist in so unreasonable a course you will alienate my heart from you forever."</p> 
               <p>This threat, uttered by those lips, went as a barbed arrow to the guilty heart of the mother, and for a few moments she was incapable of speaking. In a faint voice she at length said:</p> 
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6346-00000054"/> 
               <p>"God forgive you for speaking thus to me, Bessie. Some day you may recall your words, and feel remorse for having uttered them. If I do not claim a parent's authority over you, I certainly feel for you the affection of one. But I forgive you for wounding me so deeply, and I promise never to press this subject upon you again."</p> 
               <p>"Now, you are my own dear Minny again!" joyfully exclaimed Bessie, "and I beg ten thousand pardons for the idle threat I uttered. Under no circumstances could I ever cease to love my own darling Minny, though I foolishly said so."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley permitted the ruby lips to touch her cheek, but she avoided the loving eyes that sought forgiveness for their owner's outbreak of temper, and she arose and left the room without another word.</p> 
               <p>Frank and Bessie looked at each other a moment in silence. Then he shook his head and sagely said:</p> 
               <p>"She will withdraw from the contest, Bessie, but she will slyly set your father on; see if she don't. I begin to understand Minny's tactics better than she thinks I do."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Frank, how can you-how dare you suspect our dear Minny of such deceit as that? Fie on you! I would as soon believe myself capable of double dealing as think it of her."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps I wrong her, but we shall soon see. When a storm lowers over your father's horizon, it seldom takes long to burst.</p> 
               <p>Bessie made an ineffectual effort to smile, as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"You have made Mr. Ashley as great a <emph>bugaboo</emph> to me as Minny used to threaten me with when I was a little child; but I won't be scared at him; I won't tremble in his presence; and above all, I won't marry Mr. Francis Wentworth at his command."</p> 
                
               <p>"For which resolution Mr. Frank Wentworth returns you his most earnest thanks," he replied, bowing with mock reverence before her. "Only stick to your colors, Bessie, and maybe that little sensitive plant, your sister, will pluck up courage to think that her soul is her own, and not permit it to be shrivelled into a nutshell under the tyrannical yoke she bears. Oh, Bessie, be a true friend to my poor Evelyn, and I shall love you better than I ever did in my life."</p> 
               <p>"I will try my best, Frank; but here is the carriage, and I must run up stairs for my nubia, and put on my prettiest looks to disarm the fierceness of the terrible ogre I am going to meet. I must be a strange piece of humanity, Frank, for I feel more as if arming for conflict with a ruthless foe than making myself ready to meet and embrace a father I have never known."</p> 
               <p>With these characteristic words, she dashed from the room, but presently returned, accompanied by Mrs. Ashley, looking grave and dignified enough to have won the approbation of the fastidious and travelled Leon Ashley himself.</p> 
               <p>The white nubia, bound in soft folds around her head, was infinitely becoming, and with one of her arch smiles, she asked:</p> 
               <p>"Will I bear inspection, Minny? Are you not afraid that my father will be grievously disappointed in me?"</p> 
               <p>In spite of her annoyance, Mrs. Ashley could only reply, with a glance of pride:</p> 
               <p>"If he is, he must be very hard to please, my dear."</p> 
               <p>"'Pretty is as pretty does,' I used to be told when I was a child; but I am afraid that if Mr. Ashley judges me by that standard, he will not find me very attractive. I tell you, Minny, I am going to be naughty from the very beginning."</p> 
               <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6346-00000055"/> 
               <p>"Well, my dear," replied Mrs. Ashley, with a resigned air, "you must do as you please. I have no control over you, and you will have to bear the consequences of your own recklessness."</p> 
               <p>"I can bear them, and will bear them."</p> 
               <p>"Then we have said enough, my love; you will fight your own battle with your father, and I shall not interfere."</p> 
               <p>"So much the better, Minny; only be perfectly neutral, and you will see on whose banner victory will perch."</p> 
               <p>"I am glad that you can be so gay about it, my dear; but if you understood your position as well as I do, you would feel very different, I assure you."</p> 
               <p>Bessie was a little puzzled, but she saw how much distressed Mrs. Ashley really was, and she forbore to speak further on the subject.</p> 
               <p>The drive to Arden Place was rather a silent one, though the two young people managed to keep up some sort of communication by means of signs practised by them from their childhood. Mrs. Ashley was grave and pre-occupied, as she well might be in this crisis of her affairs.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER X.</head> 
               <head type="sub">BESSIE TRIUMPHANT.</head> 
               <p>MR. ASHLEY was lounging over the latest newspaper when the messenger from Ashurst came over to announce the speedy advent of Mrs. Ashley, accompanied by the young traveller, whose absence from home on his own return had given him so much offence on the previous day.</p> 
                
               <p>He threw the daintily-worded note his step-mother had written over to his wife, and growled:</p> 
               <p>"My daughter has come at last, but it would have been more respectful if she had been brought home in time to meet me. I shall soon let her see that I am a person of too much importance in <emph>her</emph> world to be treated with neglect or indifference."</p> 
               <p>Augusta silently glanced over the note, and Evelyn timidly said:</p> 
               <p>"I am so glad that my sister will soon be with us. I am sure I shall love her, for Frank has told me so many things of her that prove her to be most lovable."</p> 
               <p>"I scarcely believed that Master Frank would admit so much as that," sneered her father. "If Bessie is so charming, pray why did he leave her to wear the willow, while he made himself a fool about you."</p> 
               <p>The poor girl bowed her burning face, but did not venture to give a reply, which she knew would only bring on herself some further taunt, barbed with all the bitterness Ashley so well knew how to infuse into his words."</p> 
               <p>He smiled grimly at her confusion, and went on:</p> 
               <p>"I wish you to understand that I will have no confidences between you and Bessie. You are not to show her that you are dying for a man who has been her plighted bridegroom for years, for she shall have no such excuse for refusing to obey me when I insist that she shall give her hand to him to whom my father willed it. I choose that <emph>she</emph> shall marry, and you shall remain single; and you shall both obey me, or I will find means to crush you into submission. Do you understand me, Evelyn? Put off that air of broken-hearted resignation before Bessie comes hither, and do not permit her to suspect that you are that contemptible creature, a love-lorn and deserted maiden."</p> 
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6346-00000056"/> 
               <p>Evelyn bowed her head in outward submission, but she comforted herself with the thought:</p> 
               <p>"Not deserted-no, no-not that, for Frank loves <emph>me,</emph> and my sister cares not for him as I do."</p> 
               <p>With this spring of consolation brightening her desolate life, Evelyn moved away, and sat down beside a window commanding a view of the approach to the house. The time seemed very long to her before the carriage from Ashurst arrived, and she speculated as to whether Frank would come over to witness the meeting between the long severed father and child.</p> 
               <p>Her doubts were soon set at rest, for Frank sprang from the carriage as soon as it drew up, and handed the two ladies out. The noise of the arrival brought all the family to the portico except Mr. Ashley, who seated himself in a large hall chair to await in state the appearance of Bessie.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley presented her to Augusta and her step-daughter; the first lightly touched her lips to the velvet cheek, muttering some words of welcome which were nearly inaudible.</p> 
               <p>Evelyn's lips said nothing, but her large black eyes spoke volumes, and Bessie clasped her fairy form in her arms as she whispered:</p> 
               <p>"You dear, darling little sister, I know that I shall love you very much, and you may look on me as your fast friend from this moment."</p> 
               <p>Evelyn pressed her lips warmly to those of the speaker, but before she could reply, Maitland tugged at her arm with such force that she was compelled to yield her place to him. He cried out:</p> 
               <p>"Look here, Bessie, I am your brother, and I want you to kiss me right away. My! ain't it jolly to have two such pretty sisters to coddle a fellow?"</p> 
                
               <p>Bessie stooped, and tenderly kissed the lad; she then said:</p> 
               <p>"I am glad to have a brother, Maitland, and I hope you will prove a good one to me."</p> 
               <p>Frightened at this long delay on the portico, Augusta nervously said:</p> 
               <p>"Get out of the way, Maty, and let Miss Ashley pass on to her papa. He awaits your appearance in the hall, my dear, and I am afraid he will be annoyed that you did not go to him at once."</p> 
               <p>With stately step and graceful mien, the young girl walked forward, entered the house, and cast her eyes on the bloated yet singularly pallid face dissipation had given the once handsome Leon Ashley.</p> 
               <p>In spite of all her efforts to feel kindly toward him, Bessie's first emotion was one of repulsion, and she felt that it would be an effort on her part to meet him with even a slight show of affection.</p> 
               <p>On the contrary, he was struck and attracted by the radiant style of her beauty, and he delightedly exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"I looked for my daughter, but I scarcely expected to see a young goddess descend to greet her earthly father."</p> 
               <p>The goddess smiled, knelt before him, and quietly said:</p> 
               <p>"I ask your blessing, father, as I believe that is the orthodox fashion in novels."</p> 
               <p>"And you would burlesque it!" said Ashley, in sudden anger. "Get up from there this moment; who told you that I had a blessing to give you; or that one from me would be worth receiving? I do not deal in such coin, neither do I choose to be placed in a ridiculous position to please the whim of a young girl. I am not one of the patriarchs yet."</p> 
               <p>Bessie arose at these rude words, stood proudly before him, and with a slight curl of her red lip, said:</p> 
               <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6346-00000057"/> 
               <p>"As you please, Mr. Ashley. If you set so small a value on your blessing, it can be of little worth to me. My mother's daughter knows how to maintain her own dignity; and in this first moment of meeting she dares to tell you that she is neither to be browbeaten nor scolded with impunity."</p> 
               <p>The submissive wife pressed forward, trembling with excitement as to what might follow this audacious defiance; she expected a most terrific explosion of temper, but to her intense astonishment Ashley laughed, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Come kiss me, Bessie. I recognize my own spirit in you, and in the first moment of meeting I ask for a truce. You are the first girl I ever saw that had pluck enough to speak up for herself, and I like you for it. Come, give me a kiss with those ruby lips of yours, which look as if made to quaff the nectar of the gods."</p> 
               <p>With a thrill almost of horror, Mrs. Ashley saw her beautiful daughter stoop forward to obey him; but, for all that was at stake for her herself, she would have plucked her back, and then and there proclaimed the wrong of which she had been guilty; have declared that Bessie was no child of his; and this bloated Silenus claimed no right divine to be caressed by the innocent girl, who withdrew from his embrace, blushing and shrinking with feelings the origin of which she could not divine.</p> 
               <p>The invisible threads woven by her own acts which held Mrs. Ashley in bonds of steel, withheld her, and she drew a deep breath as Bessie retreated to her side, with the instinctive feeling that she would there find protection from the demonstrations of her father's affection, as well as from the outbreaks of his temper, both of which she intuitively shrank from.</p> 
               <p>Ashley said, in an irritated tone:</p> 
               <p>"Eh, my dear, you need not be in such a hurry to run away. Considering that I have been defrauded of your kisses for so many years, I think you are very sparing of them. Where is Frank Wentworth? He must be a precious goose, to run away from such a girl as you are, and pretend to have found metal more attractive."</p> 
               <p>Frank had seized the opportunity to detain Evelyn a moment on the portico, but he had lost little of what was passing in the hall. He now entered and respectfully inquired:</p> 
               <p>"Did you ask for me, sir?"</p> 
               <p>"Umph-if I did, it was not because I cared particularly to see you. What has become of Evelyn?"</p> 
               <p>His brow darkened portentously as his eyes fell upon her gliding in behind Wentworth.</p> 
               <p>"What treason have you two been plotting? Have a care, Miss Evelyn; my eye is upon you, and I understand all your manuvres."</p> 
               <p>The faint rose-tint her lover's whispered words had called into Evelyn's cheeks faded suddenly away, and she involuntarily cast an appealing look toward Bessie. She understood and immediately answered it by moving to Evelyn's side and throwing her arm around her slight form; turning toward Ashley, she said:</p> 
               <p>"My sister seems a delicate, little sensitive plant, papa, and I intend to take her under my especial protection. She evidently needs some one to keep up her courage and sustain her under your harshness."</p> 
               <p>This was going further than Ashley had supposed the most daring spirit would venture with himself; but when he unclosed his lips to utter the angry feelings that were rising within him at her cool audacity, her clear eyes met his, and their dauntless expression had the effect which the steady gaze of a sane person has on a lunatic. He cowered before it, as all cowards do before the spirit that dares to resist them, and pacifically said:</p> 
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6346-00000058"/> 
               <p>"You abuse the privileges of a newly-found daughter, Bessie, but for the time being something must be conceded to you, I suppose. Evelyn is a poor sentimental fool, and you will soon find that there is little in common between you. <emph>You</emph> are a dashing, brilliant creature, that any man would be proud to claim as his child, but <emph>she</emph> is a poor insignificant little mite, with not a particle of pride or spirit in her. Well-take her under your magnificent protection, if you choose, but you will find her a weary bargain, I can tell you."</p> 
               <p>"For shame, sir," said Bessie, indignantly. "How can you speak to the child you know nothing of in such a manner of the one you have yourself reared? You have made my sister <emph>afraid</emph> of you, and now you taunt her with trembling in your presence."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley was alarmed at this retort, and hastily interposed by saying:</p> 
               <p>"My dear Bessie, you are going too far. Do not forget the respect that is due to your father."</p> 
               <p>"Don't trouble yourself to interfere, Madam," said Ashley, with sarcastic bitterness. "My daughter has doubtless had her lesson before she came hither, and was taught that to beard the lion in his den would be the safest policy."</p> 
               <p>"My dear Mr. Ashley, I hope you do not suppose that I could have done such a thing as that. I assure you-"</p> 
               <p>He broke in on her defence without scruple.</p> 
               <p>"It is of little consequence to you, Madam, what I suppose, and I am tired of this scene. Augusta, help me to a sofa, for I feel the need of repose after so agitating an interview as Miss Ashley has compelled me to pass through."</p> 
               <p>His wife, who had listened in appalled silence to the strange dialogue in which her husband had borne so unusual a part, advanced with trepidation to offer the assistance sistance he required, but Bessie stepped before her, offered her arm to Ashley, and quietly said:</p> 
               <p>"Let me atone for the excitement I have caused you, sir, by placing you myself where you can be at rest. I did not mean to irritate you, papa, but I am a very blunt person, and I always speak the truth. As to Minny, believe me that she has taught me nothing but lessons of gentleness and forbearance toward others. I beg that you will not blame her for my freedom of speech."</p> 
               <p>Ashley accepted her assistance and her apology; as he sunk on the luxurious sofa to which she led him, he more graciously said:</p> 
               <p>"I can refuse nothing to such a pleader as you are, Bessie. You have some magic power about you which I find it impossible to resist, and the cause you advocate you can hardly fail to win."</p> 
               <p>She joyfully replied:</p> 
               <p>"Dear papa, that is the most charming assurance I could possibly have from your lips. Only love me well enough to give me some influence with you, and I promise you that I will not abuse it."</p> 
               <p>"Love you!" he repeated; "I am already in love with you, piquante, bewitching, rebellious creature that you are!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley had followed them closely, and she shuddered as she caught the meaning of his words, and saw the glance of admiration that rested on the fair face of her daughter.</p> 
               <p>Bessie, quite unconscious of her disturbance, stooped forward, kissed his brow, and playfully said:</p> 
               <p>"Now sleep, papa mine, and dream the truth as to your rebel, which is this: I am loving, gentle, and submissive with those who are affectionate and kind with me; defiant and independent when an effort is made to crush me into submission. I have furnished you with the key to my<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6346-00000059"/> character, and you may use it to your own benefit, if you care to win my respect and affection."</p> 
               <p>He grasped her hand and made an effort to retain it, but she gently disengaged herself, and after arranging the pillows that supported his head, disappeared from the room.</p> 
               <p>Ashley closed his eyes as if to retain within them as long as possible the bright image of youth and energy which had just passed before him. He was as deeply fascinated by this spirited creature as he had ever been by any woman in his youngest days, and he had always been prone to fall in love at first sight with every beautiful woman with whom he was thrown in contact, passions as evanescent as they were annoying to his wife.</p> 
               <p>Augusta glided into the room behind Mrs. Ashley, and noiselessly sat down to perform her daily task of watching over his repose. She whispered to that lady:</p> 
               <p>"I will remain here while you join the young people. Pray tell them to go on the other side of the house, and close the doors that their voices may not be heard here. Mr. Ashley always sleeps at this hour, and he has already borne as much excitement as is good for him."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley gladly went out to perform this commission, for she began to feel that Leon Ashley was even more odious to her than she had feared he might prove, and she asked herself how much longer she could bear the burden that was laid upon her, and not betray her well-kept secret.</p> 
               <p>To her chagrin, Mrs. Ashley found that the young party had all disappeared, and on inquiring for them, she learned that they had walked out in the grounds, accompanied by Maitland.</p> 
               <p>Vexed and annoyed, she would have followed them if she had possessed any clue to the direction they had taken; but the servants could none of them enlighten her, and as the grounds around Arden Place were quite extensive, she came to the wise conclusion to watch for their return with such equanimity as she could command.</p> 
               <p>She comforted herself with the thought that as Maitland was with them, they would have no opportunity to plot treason against her plans. If she could have divined what was really passing, she would have endured any degree of fatigue sooner than have left the youthful conspirators a moment free from observation.</p> 
               <p>The party had taken the direction of the pond, and after they were out of sight from the house, Bessie took the hand of the boy, and ran forward with him, leaving Frank and Evelyn to confer privately together.</p> 
               <p>Maitland, delighted with his new companion, showed her the favorite haunts he had already discovered, descanted on the delights of hunting and fishing, to which amusements he declared he meant to devote his life, under the tuition of an elderly negro who was skilled in woodcraft, and had already taught him how to angle successfully.</p> 
               <p>Bessie listened good-humoredly, laughed at his prattle, and replied to him in such a strain that Maitland declared she was a jolly girl, and worth two of Evelyn, who was angry with him because he had got her and Frank in a scrape with the governor. He had not meant to do any mischief, and he thought it was deuced hard that his sister should think he could be mean enough to tell tales on her.</p> 
               <p>Bessie consoled him by promising to place the affair in its right light before Evelyn, and when they gained the edge of the pond she sat down on the embankment, and assisted him to arrange some fishing tackle which had been left there the day before. While she was thus employed, Maitland ran off a few yards, and presently returned with a paper filled with ground-worms, to be used as bait.</p> 
               <p>Declaring that he would catch a mess of fish for her<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6346-00000060"/> dinner, he allowed her to select a place for him as far as possible from the nook she intended to seat herself in, in council with Frank and Evelyn, when they made their appearance.</p> 
               <p>Glad to give the lad any employment that would keep him quiet, she sat and watched the bobbing of the cork upon the water, indulging her own thoughts on all that had lately transpired. Maitland soon became so absorbed in his efforts so secure a fish which nibbled at his bait, that he ceased to interrupt her by any exclamation.</p> 
               <p>Nearly half an hour elapsed before the lovers joined them. When they appeared Bessie arose, and said to her young companion:</p> 
               <p>"Frank and Evelyn are coming, and we shall be sure to talk, and prevent the fish from bitting, little brother. I will take them to the other side of the pond, where you can see, but not hear us."</p> 
               <p>He nodded his head and briefly replied.</p> 
               <p>"All right. You're a trump, Bessie, for you know what to do all at once."</p> 
               <p>Accepting the compliment with one of her beaming smiles, Bessie wound her arm around Evelyn, and led her to a shaded nook near the spot on which that fatal duel had been fought so long ago. Neither of the girls was aware that this was the scene of the sad event which had so long made Ashley an exile from his native land. Frank was better informed, but he wisely kept his own counsel, and the three sat down beneath the shade of some golden willows, Bessie and Evelyn on the terrace which surrounded the pond, and Frank at their feet.</p> 
               <p>"I believe that I am president of this council," said Bessie, laughing. "As our ship of state threatens to be wrecked by the breakers ahead, we must agree on some measures by which a life preserver at least may be made available. Evelyn understands everything by this time, Frank?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes-she knows that in you she has found a fast friend and a courageous defender. She is quite willing to trust to you to extricate us from the miserable slough into which we seem to have fallen."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, dear sister, Frank has expressed my feelings exactly. I love you and I trust you."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, ye of little faith, why did ye not stand up for yourselves, and fight your own battle as fiercely as I must wage it for you?" she smilingly asked. "Do you not know that the surest way to conquer such a man as Mr. Ashley is to show him that you will not be trampled on? Here are you, Evelyn, with almost the dower of a princess, submitting to be treated as a serf; you are actually supporting my father and all his dependants on your mother's property, yet you are afraid to say a word for yourself in the presence of your tyrant."</p> 
               <p>Frank replied with some excitement:</p> 
               <p>"Don't be so hard on Evelyn, Bessie. She has spoken many words, and so, too, have I, but we were both met by insult and reviling. By what magic art you passed scathe-less, I cannot imagine."</p> 
               <p>"I think I can enlighten you. My father saw at once that he could not intimidate me, so he adopted a milder method of treatment. From me he will not be a whit the less exacting when it becomes a question of obedience to his commands, but he will seek to gain his ends by less harsh means than he has used with Evelyn."</p> 
               <p>"I believe you are right in that. But how are we to evade his despotic will? That is the question to settle now."</p> 
               <p>"Of course; we have seized the only chance we shall be likely to obtain to speak freely together on this subject,<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6346-00000061"/> and we must make the most of our time. Speak, Evelyn, and tell me if you can screw your courage to the point even of an elopement, should such extreme measures become necessary?"</p> 
               <p>A flood of crimson rushed over the young girl's face, which was succeeded by deadly paleness. She faintly said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Bessie, how shall I dare do such a thing as that? My father has threatened me with his undying curse if I give my hand to Frank."</p> 
               <p>"The French proverb says that 'curses come home to roost,' and if Mr. Ashley should prove wicked enough to hurl his on such a trembling little dove as you are, the truth of it would be proved. Put aside the fear of that threat, Evelyn, for when you become of age, you can buy a reversal of his anathemas, and even get them turned into blessings."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Bessie, how can you speak thus of our father?" asked Evelyn reproachfully.</p> 
               <p>"My dear, you forget that until a very few months ago, I was not aware that I had a living father. When the revelation came to me, it was necessarily coupled with the history of my mother's wrongs, and of course I cannot be expected to feel or express for Mr. Ashley the respect and affection you have been taught was his due. I will freely own to you that my heart has never warmed toward him with one emotion of softness, and thus far, I have seen nothing to inspire me with any feeling for him save disgust at his tyranny and want of consideration for others. I hope you will not love me less, Evelyn, because I resent his harshness to you."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no, no, my darling sister; I can only regret that such feelings toward our father have been elicited by his own conduct. Alas! that it should be so."</p> 
               <p>"But it is so, and we are met in solemn conclave to find the means of evading the authority which has been so painfully fully abused. An elopement without good cause is a shameful thing, but in this case there seems to be no other road to freedom open to you. Again I ask you, Evelyn, if you will consent to leave this place under the protection of Frank, when you find it no longer possible to remain near our father in peace?"</p> 
               <p>"If I pledged my word to that, Bessie, I should go at once, for you can have no idea of what I am daily made to endure. Such bitterness of invective, such abusive vituperation, you could never imagine, unless you had been made the victim of it, as I have. <emph>Peace!</emph> it is a thing unknown in the house we inhabit."</p> 
               <p>There was a degree of pathetic bitterness in her tones that deeply touched the listeners, and Bessie tenderly said:</p> 
               <p>"My poor darling, how much you must have suffered to bring yourself to speak thus. But how am I to help you to escape from all this misery, if you refuse to accept the protection of a husband? Nothing else can rescue you from the hourly explosions of our father's wrath."</p> 
               <p>"If I consent to elope with Frank, I bring ruin on him. He will then get nothing from my grandfather's estate, and my father will be sure to find means to retain the control of mine."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Ashley cannot do that after you are twenty-one. You will have enough of your own to repay Frank for the sacrifice he makes for your sake, and also to give your father a good slice out of your ample inheritance. As to Frank's marriage with <emph>me,</emph> I assure you that I would not have him if he were in love with me, which, thank heaven, he is not. Besides, you are bound to consider his happiness as well as your own, for he is devotedly attached to you."</p> 
               <p>Frank clasped her hand in both his own, and, with love-lit eyes, said:</p> 
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6346-00000062"/> 
               <p>"Bessie speaks like an oracle, Evelyn, and you must be convinced by her reasoning. We shall not starve while waiting for your majority, for I know that I can find the means of living for us both till that time rolls around."</p> 
               <p>"But, Frank, you forget my promise to my father. How can I break that-how can you ask me to perjure myself!"</p> 
               <p>"The pledge was wrung from you under most painful circumstances, and you could not have known what you were doing when you gave it. 'Tis not binding on you, my love-if it were, our happiness would be forever wrecked. Speak, my angel, and say that you will fly with me from persecution and ill usage. Let my Uncle curse; God will never listen to the impious ravings of such a blasphemer as he is. Oh! Evelyn, consent to escape from his cruel tyranny, and take shelter in the loving heart that yearns to protect you from his violence."</p> 
               <p>Many conflicting emotions swept over the face of the young girl while Frank thus appealed to her, and both her companions waited with intense interest for her reply. In a tremulous voice, she at length said:</p> 
               <p>"I will pledge myself to your wishes thus far; let us use every effort for two more months to bring my father over to our views. Bessie seems to have gained great influence over him already, and we cannot tell what concessions she may gain from him. It is our duty to try every means to obtain his consent to our union before adopting extreme measures. Should they eventually prove necessary, I will not recoil from them when the time to act arrives."</p> 
               <p>Wentworth looked disappointed, but Bessie said:</p> 
               <p>"That is as much as you should reasonably expect, Frank, and I am satisfied with it. I have two months, then, in which to use such spells as may chance to soften a selfish and flinty heart. <emph>My</emph> adorer will not appear here as a marplot till December, for I have prohibited him from making his pretensions known till he comes to the wedding at the Oaks. In this brief interval we must do or die in the thraldom which has already broken your spirit, Evelyn, and so changed Frank that I scarcely know him for the same being."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Bessie, 'you may jest who never felt a wound,' but Evelyn and I have writhed beneath the infliction of your father's tongue, and you have yet to find out how it can sting and embitter those on whom his anger falls. But for the sake of Evelyn, I should long since have cut his acquaintance, and removed myself beyond the reach of his vituperation."</p> 
               <p>"Please, Frank, don't speak so harshly of him; he is my father, you know," pleaded Evelyn, "and, in spite of all, I love him."</p> 
               <p>They were suddenly electrified by the voice of Maitland, shouting just behind them:</p> 
               <p>"So Frank's been giving it to the governor, has he? Hooray for him! I say; and you're a spoony, Evelyn, to talk about loving such a hard case as he is to you."</p> 
               <p>Engrossed in their conversation, they had utterly forgotten the lad; he had soon wearied of his unprofitable employment, for the bait of the unskilful angler was nibbled away without hooking the expected prey, and Maitland put aside his rod, and moved around through the woods that he might give them what he called a proper scare. He glanced at the faces before him, and again shouted:</p> 
               <p>"Hooray! aint that jolly! Why, you two girls have gone as white as paper, and Frank looks as if he could choke the breath out of me! What have you been doing here putting your heads together so long? The old man<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6346-00000063"/> will be after some of you with a sharp stick if you don't look mighty sharp for yourselves-mind if he don't!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, you intolerable scamp!" exclaimed the irate Frank. "How dare you come upon your sisters with a yell like that? I only wish I had Gretel here to keep you in order."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>That</emph> for Gretel!" said the boy, snapping his fingers. "If he hadn't been so much stronger than I, he would never have got the better of me anyhow. I tell you what it is, Frank: you had better speak me fair, or I'll tell on you and Evy again. If I didn't like my new sister so much, I'd go now and tell ma how you three have been making up some famous plan among you to humbug the elders. I vow I would."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no, you would not, Maitland, for you know how sorry you said you were for what you did before, to get Evelyn in trouble," said Bessie, with her bewitching smile. "You are only joking when you make such a threat as that. Come with me now, and I will help you to catch some fish, for I am a famous angler."</p> 
               <p>The boy suffered himself to be persuaded, and Bessie led him away in triumph; but he cast a backward glance at Frank and his companion, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Wouldn't those two catch it if the governor only saw them! They say Frank is to marry you, Bessie; but if he is, you're mighty easy on him, for I tell you he's soft about Evy."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I'm not the least jealous. Come on, Maitland, for we have no time to lose if you wish to catch a fish in time for dinner."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I'm bound to do that; so let us go on and leave them to fix a plan to jilt you if <emph>you</emph> choose-it's none of my business, you know; but catching fish is."</p> 
               <p>In the next half hour Bessie landed three good-sized trout, cajoled from Maitland a promise to say nothing of the committee of three he had so unceremoniously broken in upon; and made him think her a greater trump than ever.</p> 
               <p>She plaited for him a basket of the long grass that grew near the margin of the pond, and lined it with leaves, on which to lay his finny spoils; and as the sun began to dip toward the west, the young party again sought the house.</p> 
               <p>They all appeared at the same time; and Maitland was so full of his morning's sport, and his sister Bessie's kindness to him, that Mrs. Ashley's uneasiness was somewhat allayed. With a sly glance at Bessie, he managed to refer so naturally to Frank and Evelyn, that it was supposed they all remained together, and even the suspicions of Mr. Ashley and his wife were for the present set at rest, though their greatest dread was that Evelyn should yet elude their authority, and marry Frank.</p> 
               <p>The day passed over more harmoniously than might have been expected from the discordant elements thus brought together. A fine dinner, and a larger portion of wine than usual, kept the master of the house in tolerable humor, and the sunshine of Bessie's gayety cast its brightness over the whole party.</p> 
               <p>Travelling reminiscences were exchanged, and even Augusta, cold and stolid as she had become, brightened up into something like interest. Luckily for the quiet of the others, Maitland betook himself to his fishing rod soon after dinner was over, and his father actually retained his good humor till the hour for the departure of his guests arrived.</p> 
               <p>It was arranged that on the following day the family from Arden Place were to dine at Ashurst, and at Mrs. Ashley's earnest entreaty, Bessie was permitted to accompany her home, though Mr. Ashley reluctantly consented to part from her.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A STARTLING RESEMBLANCE.</head> 
               <p>THE next morning Bessie walked out after breakfast was over. Frank had gone over to the Oaks to consult with Rufus Welby concerning his arrangements for the elopement which he felt sure must eventually take place.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley was unusually attentive to the programme of her dinner, for she wished to show her step-son that he was important enough to tax her utmost skill in catering for his fastidious palate. Bessie left her in deep consultation with the black housekeeper, and sought the freedom of the woodland to read over again a letter which had arrived on the previous evening.</p> 
               <p>It was from Delancey, and was filled with tender and beautiful thoughts which set her to dreaming of that enchanting time when all in all to each other they should go hand in hand upon their pilgrimage of life, doubling the joys of existence, aiding each other to bear its inevitable crosses and sorrows.</p> 
               <p>She strolled nearly half a mile from the house, and a grove of cedars mingled with weeping willows suddenly loomed before her. A white paling gleamed from its dusky shadows, and with a start the young dreamer became conscious that she was approaching the graveyard.</p> 
               <p>As such a spot was little in unison with the bright pictures of life which were floating through her fancy, Bessie was turning away, when the sound of something struck sharply and continuously, coming from the direction of the cemetery aroused her curiosity, and she moved quickly toward the enclosure.</p> 
               <p>She had so often visited the spot in her childhood that she had no superstitious fears to contend with, but she became a little startled as she heard the sound of a chisel evidently driven with force into the farther side of the marble shaft, broken off at the top, which had been placed there as a memorial of Leon Ashley's supposed untimely death.</p> 
               <p>The gate was open, and Bessie passed the stately monument erected over Judge Ashley, and lifting the long branches of a willow which swept almost to the ground, she saw old Jupiter seated on the base of the broken column industriously chiselling away the false inscription.</p> 
               <p>"Uncle Jupe!" she exclaimed-"I thought that Old Mortality was making a visit to the graveyard to renew the letters on the tombstones, but your purpose seems entirely different. What on earth set you to work on such a job as that, and what will papa say when he hears what you have done?"</p> 
               <p>The old man looked up at her with a bewildered expression; he shook his head and said:</p> 
               <p>"Never <emph>you</emph> mind, Miss Bessie. I's doin' what I knows is right. It went mightily agin the grain to see this 'ere whited sepilker, as the preachers call it, put up here, wi' a mighty black lie a-starin' from its face, but de ole marster had his own notions, an' he would do it-'caze he thought de worl' wouldn't b'lieve Marse Leon was dead widout he had a monerment put over him."</p> 
               <p>He stopped to wipe the perspiration from his face, and Bessie said:</p> 
               <p>"I think you should have asked permission before you<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6346-00000065"/> defaced the shaft, even if it does bear a falsehood. I am afraid your mistress will be very much displeased when she learns what you have done."</p> 
               <p>"Nobody aint <emph>my</emph> mistiss, Miss Bessie. I's a free man, an' I has my 'nuity what my marster lef' me, an' my house as long as I live. Mrs. Ashley aint a gwine to say much to <emph>me,</emph> 'specially 'bout dis here consarn, 'caze she knows it's a lie as well as de res' o' de worl' does-and I didn't want my young marster to come home to de ole place, an' fine his name in the graveyard. It would bring bad luck on him <emph>sho'.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>Something in the tone of the old man's voice struck her, and she more gently said:</p> 
               <p>"You were with my grandfather in those days, Uncle Jupe, and you knew all about those terrible times. My father asked about you yesterday, and seemed glad to hear that you were living still."</p> 
               <p>"Did he, chile? was he raally glad to know dat de ole darkie would meet him agin an' welcome him to his-I was agoin' to say to his own, but de ole place aint his'n an' de heir is cut off wid a 'nuity like ole Jupe, while de youngsters gits de 'state. My marster was a good man, but I carnt think dat he did right 'bout dat."</p> 
               <p>"So you think Frank and I should give up our claims in favor of papa? It would not do him much good, I'm afraid, Uncle Jupe, for there is another paper in Minny's possession which tells what shall be done with the property if Frank and myself do not marry each other."</p> 
               <p>"What's de use o' papers when common sense an' justice tells people what dey ought to do. White folks has so much foolishness 'bout dere doin's, dat a darkie's clean beat out tryin' to comperhend what dey would be arter. I hearn tell dat you an' Marse Frank don't mean to mind what de Judge said; ef dat's de case, Marse Leon ought to have de 'state out o' han', in spite o' all de papers that ever was writ."</p> 
               <p>"Hurrah for you, Jupiter; you express exactly my own sentiments," said a voice from the other side of the monument, and Mr. Ashley emerged from the temporary concealment it had afforded him.</p> 
               <p>The carriage road wound within a few hundred yards of the graveyard, though it was concealed from view by a belt of young trees, and on arriving at this point Mr. Ashley insisted on descending from the carriage and visiting his own monument. He ordered his wife and daughter to go on to the house and send the vehicle to the graveyard for him. He came in hearing just as Jupiter was uttering his last reply to Bessie, and broke in on them in the unceremonious manner we have recorded.</p> 
               <p>"Papa! I did not believe you could walk so far without assistance. How on earth did you get here?"</p> 
               <p>"On my feet, to be sure, my beautiful Armida. I am getting on famously and feel almost well to-day. Well, Jupiter, how is it with <emph>you,</emph> old fellow? The snows of time have whitened your poll, I see, and you have come to a crutch and the lean and slippered pantaloon."</p> 
               <p>The old negro seemed scarcely to hear this flippant address. He had slipped from his uncomfortable perch and was grovelling in the dust at the feet of the man whose life he had saved in that terrible night when the father's outraged heart would have given doom to his only child.</p> 
               <p>He clasped Ashley's knees, and large tears rolled down his wrinkled cheeks as he said:</p> 
               <p>"You is back agin, Marse Leon, an' now I's ready to lie down in my grave. I has only bin waitin' for you to come back dat I might look on you onct more afore I goes to de blessed Lord. My work's done on yeth now, an' de<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6346-00000066"/> shinin' angel wi' de sword may cut me down as soon as he pleases."</p> 
               <p>Ashley seemed a little touched at the great emotion manifested by the old man, but he lightly said:</p> 
               <p>"You have hardly looked at me yet, Jupiter. I am afraid if Bessie had not called me papa, you would never have known me again. You can see but few traces of the gay young master you once knew in this changed and broken-down frame of mine."</p> 
               <p>While he thus spoke the negro fixed his dimming eyes upon his face, and an expression of surprise mingled with pity came to his face; he muttered:</p> 
               <p>"You is changed, lad; an' not for the better, but how could that be arter so many years? Folks will git older, an' you has had sickness too. Oh, Marse Leon, I has prayed for you, I has wrestled wid de Lord for your sake, but I is feared he aint listened to my pra'rs, for you looks like a chile o' sin yit."</p> 
               <p>"Did you ever indulge the hope that I should become a saint through your powerful intercessions, Jupe?" asked Ashley, with levity. "I am sorry to tell you that I am still in the bonds of iniquity and likely to stay there, I am afraid, unless you can get some one more gifted in prayer than yourself to ask that I may be released from them."</p> 
               <p>With an humbled expression, the old man replied:</p> 
               <p>"I done de bes' I could, Marse Leon, an' ef de Good Man wouldn't listen to me, 'twas becaze I'm sich a sinner myself. De promise is to de righteous, an' I'm 'feared dat I's not worthy to ax a blessing for myself nor for nobody else."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I dare say you're good enough, but I am not in the humor to be bored with a sermon now. What have you been doing here? I expected to find the place deserted."</p> 
                
               <p>Jupiter pointed to the scarred face of the column and solemnly said:</p> 
               <p>"I has tuck your name off dat 'ere stone, 'caze I thought it mought give you a shock to find yerself put down among de dead men. Miss Bessie thought I done wrong, but I knows <emph>you</emph> won't think dat."</p> 
               <p>A slight shiver passed over Ashley's frame, but he laughed nervously as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"You were quite right, Jupiter. It never occurred to me that my father would go so far as to put a record of my death above an empty grave, but he believed in finishing up things thoroughly. He had no idea that all his pains would be set at naught, some day, eh Jupiter?"</p> 
               <p>"I s'pose he didn't, sir; but de ole marster was a good man, an' he allers tried to do what he thought was right."</p> 
               <p>"Why did you circumvent him on <emph>that</emph> night then?" asked Ashley, sharply. "You are getting in your dotage, or you would not speak of my father in such tones to me. Here I stand upon my own inheritance, an alien, with barely a maintenance allowed me from what should be my own. Don't talk to me about Judge Ashley's justice, old man, if you wish to remain on good terms with me."</p> 
               <p>He turned abruptly away, faced the monument erected to his father's memory, and with frowning brow and writhing lips, read the simple inscription which, in a few well chosen words, conveyed a just idea of the well spent life of the man who lay beneath.</p> 
               <p>Every line seemed a tacit reproach to himself, and he impatiently looked around for Bessie, who had stood silently listening to the conversation which had just passed. She was now stooping over Jupiter and speaking in low soothing tones to him, for the old man was silently weeping over the last words of his young master.</p> 
               <p>In reply to her words he said:</p> 
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6346-00000067"/> 
               <p>"I has been tole dat he didn't care for nobody's feelin's, but I did think he'd 'member suffin dat he an' I knows an' not be so hard on <emph>me.</emph> My time's mos' out, Miss Bessie, an' after I has seen de other chillen dat claims de Ashley blood, I is ready to go to glory. Dere-your pappy is lookin' roun' wi' de dark look on his face, an' you'd better leave de ole man to finish the job he's undertuck."</p> 
               <p>The sound of Ashley's voice calling to her to join him left her no alternative, and Bessie moved unwillingly from the side of the old man and offered her arm to sustain the faltering steps of Ashley, who began by this time to feel the extent of his own imprudence in walking so far.</p> 
               <p>"Let us get away from this place," he said. "It oppresses me with a vague dread that is terrible to me. I do not know what impelled me to come here, for, of all places, a graveyard is the last one I should voluntarily wish to visit."</p> 
               <p>He leaned heavily upon her arm, as they drew near the gate, and Bessie began to fear that he would soon become quite helpless, when the welcome sound of wheels was heard approaching. Luckily the driver had lost no time in returning for his master, and seeing his condition, he dismounted and lifted him into the vehicle.</p> 
               <p>Bessie took her place opposite to him, but he imperiously said:</p> 
               <p>"Come over here and sit beside me. You seem to shrink away from me in a manner that is inexplicable to me unless-unless they have told you what you should never have heard. Has Jupiter betrayed anything to you that-that has prejudiced you against me?"</p> 
               <p>She hastened to change her seat at his command, and then replied.</p> 
               <p>"If Uncle Jupiter has anything to reveal, sir, he has never confided it to me. I know of the duel that compelled you to leave this country, but Minny was obliged to tell me that when she revealed to me that I had a father still living."</p> 
               <p>"And she told you that I maltreated your mother; that was why you defied me yesterday. Oh, Bessie, I loved poor Eva with the first passion of my life, and if she could rise from her early grave, she would tell you that I made her happy during the brief months of our union. I was summoned home by my father. In spite of all you may have been taught to the contrary, he was a hard and wilful man. He had made the arrangement for my marriage with Grace Arden, and he hurried it on in spite of every appeal I could make to him. My child, I was weak, I was dependent on him, and I feared to tell him that I was already the husband of another. It was a terrible time, Bessie, but if I could tell you all, you would think that I was treated worse that ever son was treated before. I <emph>cannot</emph> tell you, so let this explanation suffice, and give me at least the pity and sympathy I deserve from my own daughter."</p> 
               <p>Bessie listened with eager interest to this lame and impotent excuse; but anxious as she was to find something in her supposed father to love and respect, she could not trust his word when he assured her that so good a man as she knew Judge Ashley to have been would have treated him unjustly. She said:</p> 
               <p>"You have my sympathy, sir, for your sufferings, but I trust they are all over now, and if you choose, you can pass the rest of your life in peace and comfort."</p> 
               <p>"How can I have either when Frank and Evelyn torment me as they do? There they are now, standing together on the steps. I do wonder where Augusta is, that she permits them to talk together so intimately."</p> 
               <p>As the carriage drew up at the door, he saw that Mrs. Ashley and Augusta were standing just within the hall,<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6346-00000068"/> where they could hear all that passed between the two young people. Somewhat mollified by this, Ashley smoothed his brow a little and stood on the steps several minutes looking over the well-remembered scene.</p> 
               <p>The place was as well kept as in days of yore, and he could detect few changes during the long series of years since he had last beheld it. A resentful pang swelled his heart as he thought that this fair heritage was lost to him and to his son after him, through what he considered the harshness of his father.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley came forward to welcome him, and a luxurious chair was brought near the door at his request, that he might, at his ease, survey the scene without.</p> 
               <p>The hall ran through the whole length of the house, and was nearly twenty feet wide. The walls were finished with dark oaken panels, quaintly carved, and in every compartment hung a family portrait. Some of them, representing the early settlers in America, were rude enough, but the later ones were fine paintings by the best artists of the day in which they were executed.</p> 
               <p>Among them was the sister of Judge Ashley, painted by Stuart, an exquisite picture of a most beautiful woman, who had died in the first bloom of youth.</p> 
               <p>On this picture the gaze of Augusta was fastened with a half-frightened, half-bewildered expression, which soon attracted the attention of her husband. He followed the direction of her eyes, and seemed startled himself as he looked from the portrait to Evelyn, who was standing aside speaking in low tones with Bessie. He thought:</p> 
               <p>"I had forgotten how Aunt Imogene looked, but it is very strange that Evelyn should so exactly resemble her. Who can the child be, I wonder? She has every mark of the Ashley family, and her very ways often remind me of my sister Ellinor, though she has little of her fire. I have quenched that out of her, though, by my management. I sometimes wish that I knew who the girl really belongs to; but why should I trouble myself about <emph>that,</emph> when she represents fortune to me."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley also remarked the interest with which Augusta compared the portrait with her step-daughter, and she said:</p> 
               <p>"Miss Evelyn Ashley shows her descent plainly enough, though Bessie bears no resemblance to her father's family. The portrait of her great aunt might pass for hers."</p> 
               <p>"It is wonderful," replied Augusta, absently; "I am bewildered by the likeness. It is the strangest thing I-"</p> 
               <p>"What is so strange about it, Madam?" broke in Ashley, in his sharpest tones. "Is there anything extraordinary in <emph>my daughter</emph> bearing a resemblance to my family? I beg, Mrs. Ashley, that you will act as if you are not quite demented."</p> 
               <p>Augusta cast a frightened glance at him, and the severe one he gave her in return puzzled the keen observer who had once before noticed that there was something singular connected with Evelyn. That she was an Ashley she never for one moment doubted, but from that hour she began to think that Evelyn might not be the daughter of Grace Arden. Bessie drew Evelyn forward and gayly said:</p> 
               <p>"If my grandfather had ever seen my sister, he would have recognized <emph>her</emph> as his true descendant, and have given her at least Aunt Imogene's portion of the inheritance; for she <emph>is</emph> wonderfully like her."</p> 
               <p>Evelyn gazed upon the dark beauty of the picture, and with a pleased smile recognized the resemblance to herself. She said:</p> 
               <p>"Frank has often told me of this portrait, and expressed the hope that my fate would not be as sad as that of<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6346-00000069"/> the original. But I am not half so beautiful as she is, Bessie."</p> 
               <p>Frank had drawn near enough to whisper:</p> 
               <p>"In my eyes, you are even lovelier, my dark-eyed fairy."</p> 
               <p>The faint flush that arose to Evelyn's cheek was detected by Ashley, and suspecting its cause, he cried out:</p> 
               <p>"Come here to me, you abominable little flirt, and I will tell you what the fate of your kinswoman was. Her lover was thrown from his horse almost at her feet, and killed by the fall. The shock threw her into convulsions, and she died before the night was over. Had she lived, she would never have had another lover. Such are the women of my race, Miss Ashley, but I am afraid you are a poor specimen of them. A girl who has so little respect for herself as to listen to love-speeches from her sister's betrothed, can have little in common with the brokenhearted Imogene Ashley."</p> 
               <p>Evelyn involuntarily cast an appealling glance at Mrs. Ashley, who was touched with compassion for her when she saw her quivering lips and tearful eyes. With some asperity she said:</p> 
               <p>"My dear Mr. Ashley, I hoped that on the occasion of your first visit to your old home, you would find nothing to annoy you. I entreat that for this day at least, the doors of the temple of Janus shall be shut, and peace reign in our little world."</p> 
               <p>He replied with some stiffness:</p> 
               <p>"Excuse me, madam; I have no right to become the spirit of discord in a house in which I know I no longer possess any right. I forgot that I was not under my own roof-tree, but after your reminder, I shall not become oblivious again of that fact."</p> 
               <p>She looked annoyed, but did not venture to utter the reply that arose to her lips.</p> 
                
               <p>Wentworth, to save Evelyn from any further rebuke, sauntered from the house, and did not reappear until dinner was on the table.</p> 
               <p>To divert their irritable guest until that time arrived, Bessie had a fine stereoscope brought into the hall, and placed in an advantageous position. She then arranged in it a series of European views, and declared she was going on a tour with her father.</p> 
               <p>Together they examined the views, many of which were familiar to Mr. Ashley, and he became really entertaining as he described portions of his foreign travels. The two elder ladies, with their crotchet work, sat within the sound of his voice, and each one congratulated herself that her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bte noir</foreign> was at least quiet.</p> 
               <p>Evelyn seated herself on an ottoman in the doorway, and watched the distant figure of Wentworth walking to and fro in the grove, as if wrapped in troubled thought.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly a strange cry came to her ears, and a hoarse voice said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, lor' gorra mighty! has de dead come back to life agin? Miss Im'gin, is you here to speak to de ole man agin, an' is you come to warn me dat dey're waitin' for me up yonder, whar de king o' glory reigns?"</p> 
               <p>Startled by this singular address, Evelyn arose to her feet, and looked apprehensively at the grey-haired old negro who had hobbled toward her, and was now leaning on his crutch with an expression of blended awe and reverence on his wrinkled face.</p> 
               <p>Maitland, who had been exploring the place ever since his arrival, at this moment came dashing up to the door, and he almost overturned the old man as he ran full tilt against him.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, bother, old blackamoor, what are you standing in the way for? If you aint firm on your pins, you ought<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6346-00000070"/> to stay in your own house and not be coming round when there's company. If I had bowled you down I might have broken some of your old bones."</p> 
               <p>"An' ef you had, I reckin you wouldn't ha' cared much," was Jupiter's indignant reply. "I mistuk dis here pretty angel for Miss Im'gin, but I see now dat she's de <emph>other</emph> darter, an' <emph>you</emph>'re de son-de las' o' de ole name; but I is sorry to say dat you aint worthy to b'ar it, an' I'm glad you don't git de ole place. Dis young lady is de one dat ought to have it, for <emph>she</emph> 's a true Ashley, ef dere ever was one."</p> 
               <p>Maitland made a face at him and carelessly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Who said I wanted the old trap? I don't care for anybody's money, for I mean to make my own fortune-so there!"</p> 
               <p>By this time Evelyn found voice to say:</p> 
               <p>"I am glad to make your acquaintance, Uncle Jupiter, for it must be you. I have often heard my cousin Frank speak of you as the most faithful of servants to my grandfather."</p> 
               <p>"Did Marse Frank say <emph>dat,</emph> honey? I feels mightily set up dat he should ha' tole you o' de ole man. Yes-I is Jupiter at your sarvice, Miss Ashley, an' I jes' wish dat de Judge had lived to see what a picter of his sister you is. He were mighty fond o' Miss Im'gin, an' he tuk her death awful hard-awful. I 'members your ma too, but dere aint nothin' 'bout you dat 'minds me o' her. Miss Grace were white an' pale lookin', but you is a Ashley every inch on you, wi' de black eyes an' rosy lips o' de han'somest on 'em."</p> 
               <p>By this time Ashley had become aware of what was passing at the door, and he abruptly arose and spoke to Jupiter.</p> 
               <p>"Don't turn the silly head of Evelyn with your nonsense, Jupiter. Of course she is like my family; who else should she resemble? I believe I hurt your feelings this morning, and here is a dollar to pay you for my quickness of speech. I thank you for what you were doing down yonder, and I will find some means of rewarding you."</p> 
               <p>The negro drew back, and respectfully said:</p> 
               <p>"I has enuff o' my own, thank you all de same, Marse Leon. Your pappy lef' me plenty to git all I wants, an' de mistis sen's my vittles from her own table. I is glad to ha' seen de chillun afore I dies, but now I aint got much mo' to do on dis yeth, an' I s'pecs my ole marster wants me up yonder whar he's gone to."</p> 
               <p>A flush of anger crossed Ashley's face at this refusal to accept his gift, and he sharply bade Evelyn go in, while he did the same himself.</p> 
               <p>Jupiter hobbled away, shaking his head and muttering:</p> 
               <p>"A hard-hearted man-a bad man, I is feared. I carn't do nothin' but pray for him; an', bless de Lor', he carn't keep me from doin' dat nohow."</p> 
               <p>The remainder of the day passed more pleasantly than might have been expected, for Mrs. Ashley and Bessie exerted themselves to remove every cause of vexation from their irritable guest, and he condescended to be amused by the united efforts of the whole party except Frank, who again disappeared as soon as dinner was over. In the evening he insisted that Bessie should return to Arden Place and spend several days, to which Mrs. Ashley consented with extreme reluctance.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">LEON IS INFLEXIBLE.</head> 
               <p>LEON ASHLEY assumed his place in the society of his native country without question or audible comment.</p> 
               <p>Those who remembered the circumstances which had occurred so many years before, were impressed with the belief that a fair duel had ended fatally for one party; and after so great a lapse of time, it would be useless and unfriendly to take any legal steps against the survivor.</p> 
               <p>The social prestige of his family sustained him, and in a short time the most prominent people within visiting distance called at Arden Place to make the acquaintance of the family, and congratulate Mr. Ashley on his return to his native land.</p> 
               <p>As the heiress of so magnificent an inheritance, Evelyn attracted much attention; but the visitors observed the coldness with which her father listened to praises of her, and the subdued petulance with which he treated her before strangers. The supposition was that he hated her because he was in a measure dependent on her, and much sympathy was felt and expressed for her unhappy position in the house every one believed to be her own, except, perhaps, Mrs. Ashley.</p> 
               <p>Whatever suspicions she entertained, she kept them to herself, for she felt that the ground on which she herself stood was too insecure to venture on attempting to expose Mr. Ashley's fraud, if fraud there were.</p> 
                
               <p>She beheld with dread the singular fancy her step-son had taken to her daughter. Never before had she so fully realized the false position in which she had placed her child, and she writhed in spirit over the necessity of continued concealment.</p> 
               <p>Day after day Bessie was sent for to visit Arden Place, and sometimes, at the imperious command of Ashley, detained from her a week at a time; yet she was powerless to set forth her higher claim to the society of her daughter.</p> 
               <p>Ashley seemed fascinated, enthralled by Bessie's mere presence, and the lovers began to hope everything from the influence she seemed to be acquiring over him. With gentle despotism she refused to listen to him when he spoke of her future union with Wentworth, and she insisted that she should be left free to know and appreciate her newly found father before she was called on to accept any one as her husband.</p> 
               <p>Such sweet flattery as this lulled the evil spirit with which she had to deal to temporary rest, and Ashley almost ceased to torment poor Evelyn with his incessant watchfulness.</p> 
               <p>But she was fully conscious that a Cerberus not less keenly interested in keeping her out of Wentworth's reach never relaxed her vigilance.</p> 
               <p>Augusta assumed the office of spy on her step-daughter, and assiduously kept herself informed of every movement she made; but she performed her office quietly, and the poor girl was thankful for the respite from the harsh language she was accustomed to receive from her father, though she knew she was under strict espionage every hour of her life.</p> 
               <p>In spite of the diversion made in her favor by Bessie, she dared not attempt to write to Frank, for she knew that her portfolio was daily examined, and when she had<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6346-00000072"/> once supposed herself free from surveillance, and availed herself of the opportunity to dash off a line to Frank, the head of her step-mother was suddenly thrust over her shoulder, and her voice asked:</p> 
               <p>"To whom are you writing, love? You can have no correspondents in this country, and your father will be displeased if you attempt to communicate with a certain person. Don't annoy him, Evelyn, for his health is still in a very precarious state, and the result may be fatal if he is thrown into one of his violent paroxysms of passion."</p> 
               <p>From that day Evelyn forbore to make an effort to address the lover she was never permitted to see except in her father's presence; for Frank's home was at Ashurst, and the cavalier treatment he received from his uncle caused him to present himself in his house as seldom as possible.</p> 
               <p>Bessie was the only channel of communication between the lovers, and she sustained the spirits of both by carrying constant messages between them, even while Mr. Ashley supposed she was gradually making up her mind to accept the destiny which had been prepared for her.</p> 
               <p>No mention of another lover was made, for Bessie had exacted from Mrs. Ashley a promise that she would keep her secret till Delancey appeared on the scene to plead his own cause. Her mother would never have consented to such an arrangement if she had not seen in the marine intelligence an account of severe gales, in one of which it was stated that the United States ship Osprey, commanded by Captain Martin, had been so severely injured, that on her arrival in Liverpool, it was found necessary to place her in dock for repairs.</p> 
               <p>So Mrs. Ashley had more time in which to breathe, and Bessie gained her point. Mr. Ashley remained in blissful ignorance that the imperious charmer who had taken his heart by storm was actually betrothed to one she loved with all the passionate fervor of her nature.</p> 
               <p>When Bessie was at Arden Place she relieved Evelyn, in a great measure, of her onerous duties. She read aloud to Mr. Ashley in her turn, and was always ready to sing to him, accompanying herself on the guitar, which was the only instrument on which she could perform.</p> 
               <p>Her voice was a delicious soprano, and she played skilfully enough to enchant all who listened to her strains, though she made no pretensions to much musical knowledge. Bessie had been entirely educated by Mrs. Ashley, and the Judge had been so well satisfied with her attainments that he had not considered it necessary to send her to a finishing school.</p> 
               <p>The days rolled on, and even Bessie's heart quaked a little when the end of the stipulated two months drew near without any apparent change in the lovers' favor. She clearly saw that the time approached in which she must strike a decisive blow, and ascertain definitely what the fate of Wentworth and Evelyn was to be, before she could ask from the latter the fulfilment of her pledge.</p> 
               <p>Frank had already chafed and murmured at the delay, declaring it to be useless, but Bessie represented to him that just now it would be impossible for Evelyn to escape from the espionage in which she was held, and unless some skilful diversion were made in her favor, she did not know how an elopement could be eventually managed.</p> 
               <p>To this he testily replied:</p> 
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> can manage that as you do everything else, Bessie; for you twist us all around your fingers just as you please."</p> 
               <p>She smiled faintly, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Don't be unjust to me, Frank. If you only knew how tired I am of playing the part that is forced on me,<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6346-00000073"/> you would not speak as you do. I sometimes think that I am a treacherous and undutiful child, to wheedle my father as I daily do, to gain some end of my own; but some-how I have never felt as if I owe him the obedience of a daughter; fond as he is of me, I have never experienced for him any emotion stronger than compassion. He is so violent, that I tremble as the time approaches to unveil my heart before him, and show him that he has been resting on treacherous hope in believing that I would hold you to your troth with me."</p> 
               <p>Wentworth saw that she was wounded by his late words, and he penitently said:</p> 
               <p>"Forgive me, Bessie; but I am so unhappy-so uncertain of what a day may bring forth, that I am kept in a continued state of wretched expectation. If I could see Evelyn alone-could receive the assurance that her promise will be kept if we can succeed in releasing her from the captivity in which she is held, I could bear this suspense better; but she is so timid, so fearful of her father's malediction, that I have little faith in the fulfilment of her pledge. She will be sure to shrink back at the last moment."</p> 
               <p>"I have done all that I can to reassure you on that point, Frank. I cannot answer for Evelyn's courage at the last; but I know that she loves you with all her heart, and you must content yourself with that certainty till the time arrives to test her fortitude in violating her father's commands."</p> 
               <p>"Well, she has not much longer to debate the question," he gloomily replied, "for in another week the time agreed on expires, and two weeks from to-day the wedding at the Oaks takes place. Mr. Delancey will then appear on the scene, and formally make known his pretensions to your hand. Oh, Bessie, what an explosion there will be!"</p> 
                
               <p>"The first explosion, caused by your elopement with Evelyn, will blow us up so effectually, that what there is left will be prepared for anything," she replied, with a sparkle of her old humor. "When Ernest comes to pick me out of the ruins, I think my father will be too much subdued to say no to his proposal."</p> 
               <p>Frank shook his head dubiously, but he was somewhat comforted, and he sent innumerable messages to Evelyn when she returned to Arden Place.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley during all these weeks was in a state of wretched indecision. She often accompanied her daughter on her visits to her step-son, and frequently tendered her services as reader, for he had weak eyes and never read a line himself.</p> 
               <p>To her extreme annoyance, she found that the influence she hoped to gain over the irritable sensualist was entirely superseded by that of Bessie. In her presence he scarcely seemed to notice any one else, and although he was studiously polite to Mrs. Ashley, he manifested no pleasure in her society; in fact, it seemed rather a restraint to him.</p> 
               <p>The youth, the freshness, the fire of Bessie possessed an inexpressible charm to the worn-out man of pleasure, and as she sat on a low ottoman reading to him, he would amuse himself for hours playing with a tress of her hair, unwinding it from the shell-like ear, and twisting its golden length around his fingers.</p> 
               <p>He declared that Berenice's hair, which has given name to one of the constellations, was never more beautiful than hers, and lavished on her the flatteries which, in his youth, had made him irresistible to most women.</p> 
               <p>If Bessie did not love him she was not insensible to the homage he offered her charms, and she received it in such a manner as to fill her mother with shrinking pain.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley often felt as if it would be impossible to<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6346-00000074"/> keep her disgraceful secret much longer. Her child must be all her own, and not be called on to render filial attentions to a man who had no claims on her, and especially to such a man as she knew Leon Ashley to be.</p> 
               <p>Many times she felt tempted to draw Bessie forcibly from his side, proclaim aloud the sin of which she had been guilty, and bid him find the long lost daughter of Eva Weston and restore her to her rightful position.</p> 
               <p>But the dread scorn of the world, the fearful rage of this human tiger, should her evil deed be disclosed to him, deterred her, and heart-sick she turned away with the feeling that her sin had found her out, and its results would yet bring her to the dust with shame and abasement.</p> 
               <p>Bessie saw that she was depressed and annoyed, and by attention and tenderness when they were together, she endeavored to raise her failing spirits. Poor child! at this time she had both hands and heart full herself without attempting to give comfort to another; and her time was so fully occupied by Mr. Ashley's exactions, that she could scarcely command an hour to reply to her lover's letters, which came to her regularly under cover to Kate Welby. In her turn she sent them over by Wentworth, who, at this uncomfortable time, was almost a daily visitor at the Oaks.</p> 
               <p>When Delancey first asked Bessie to be his wife, she had fully explained to him the peculiar position in which she was placed, and he understood why some diplomacy was necessary before he could make known his pretensions to her hand with any prospect of success.</p> 
               <p>In two more weeks the brilliant wedding of Miss Welby was to be celebrated; the invitations had been sent far and wide to the friends of both families, and Bessie had promised to lay aside her mourning for that evening and act as bridesmaid to her friend. She had succeeded in obtaining from Mr. Ashley a promise that Evelyn should also be present on that occasion, and with much trepidation, courageous as she was, she decided that she must approach the dreaded subject of her own position toward Frank, and ascertain if Mr. Ashley could be induced, on any reasonable terms, to sanction the union of the lovers.</p> 
               <p>On the afternoon of the day on which she held the foregoing conversation with Wentworth, she sat beside him with the guitar on which she had been playing thrown on the floor near her. He seemed in an unusually good humor, and laughed and jested with her in the most agreeable manner.</p> 
               <p>Augusta listened to the playful badinage with feelings that were far from agreeable, and she at length said:</p> 
               <p>"If you were not Leon's daughter, I should be desperately jealous of you, Bessie. You have completely rivalled me, and you are the only creature who, for years, has had power to save yourself from constant reproof in his presence."</p> 
               <p>Her husband turned a frowning brow toward her and angrily said:</p> 
               <p>"Madam, since I have made myself such a bugbear to you, I wonder that you should linger near me. I can dispense with your presence now, as the only one who cares to understand me is near me to minister to my wants. Evelyn has been absent some time, and you had best look after her at once."</p> 
               <p>With a crestfallen air Augusta left the room and Bessie said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, papa, how can you treat Mrs. Ashley so cavalierly? She loves you, and would be glad to be everything to you if you would only permit her."</p> 
               <p>He curled his lip and indifferently replied:</p> 
               <p>"She does not <emph>amuse</emph> me, and that is of more consequence to me now than being loved. I was infatuated about that woman once, but after the first bloom of her<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6346-00000075"/> beauty passed away, there was nothing left to care about. Poor Augusta only bores me now. If she possessed a tithe of your brightness, of your wit and fun, I should still have some pleasure in her ministrations, but she is dull as the 'fat weed that rots on Lethe's brink.' Do you know, Bessie, that you are the most bewitching of women, and I do not know what I should do without you."</p> 
               <p>She smiled and asked:</p> 
               <p>"If I am so necessary to you, how will you consent to give me up to Frank? You insist that I shall hold him to his troth, yet you would be unwilling to see me go with him."</p> 
               <p>He impatiently replied:</p> 
               <p>"Frank is a nuisance to me. He is not worthy of you, for the simpleton actually prefers that little nobody Evelyn to you, my bright Peri. I almost wish that my father had not made such a will. It is too bad that you must eventually accept him; but such a gem as you are, Bessie, must have a magnificent setting, and <emph>I</emph> shall have nothing to give you."</p> 
               <p>"Then let Frank repudiate the bond himself, and give the estate up to me. He is perfectly willing to do this, and accept Evelyn's hand and fortune in lieu of those he relinquishes. I, on my part, pledge myself to settle on you the half of the income which Frank gives up, and-"</p> 
               <p>She had thus far spoken so eagerly that Ashley could not interrupt her, but he now burst forth with the first imprecations he had ever used in her presence. After exhausting the first violence of his wrath in a volley of curses, he savagely went on:</p> 
               <p>"So <emph>you,</emph> who I believed true to me, are in league with Frank and Evelyn. You ask me to let the impression go abroad that you have been refused, jilted, forced to wear the willow for my nephew. Don't anger me with you, Bessie, for I begin to find it pleasant to have something to love and forbear with. Hear my ultimatum-Evelyn shall <emph>never</emph> marry Frank Wentworth, nor any other man. She is too delicate to live many years, and she probably inherits the taint of insanity which is in the Arden blood. Is not that a sufficient reason for keeping her always under my own eye? I know that she cherishes a sentimental attachment for my nephew, and I do not regret it, for when you and he find that you <emph>must</emph> marry each other, Evelyn will gradually make up her mind that her destiny is that of single blessedness. It is the only safe one for her, as you will see if you reflect upon the antecedents of her mother's family."</p> 
               <p>Bessie summoned courage to remonstrate:</p> 
               <p>"Dear papa, believe me, Evelyn is in no more danger of losing her reason than I am, that is, unless you thwart her passion for Frank. In that case, the evil you dread might be brought on by the sufferings of her mind. They love each other too well for me to be willing to step between them, and I entreat that you will listen to my prayer in their behalf without manifesting such violent anger."</p> 
               <p>"Bessie Ashley," he said, with a stern emphasis, "from no other person would I listen to such words at all, and you abuse the influence you have gained over me, when you dare to bring forward a petition I have sworn I will not grant. It is my unalterable determination that your union with Frank shall take place at some future day. We need be in no hurry about the time; you are young enough to wait, and as you are both silly enough to think love of more value than worldly prosperity, I will give you time to come to your sober senses."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, papa," she passionately cried, "after what has passed between Frank and Evelyn, I can never marry him. It would be shameful for me to do such a thing; it would break my sister's heart, and make Frank hate me."</p> 
               <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6346-00000076"/> 
               <p>"What right had your sister to attempt to rival you. She knew the compact that binds you and Frank to choose each other; knew that it would be ruin to one or both to repudiate it. Let her silly heart break; and as to my nephew, there is little fear that he will not, in time, adore such a woman as you are. I have no doubt on that score."</p> 
               <p>"Then your will is immutable?" she asked, with a strange glitter in her eyes.</p> 
               <p>"Immutable as fate itself. I shall take good care that Evelyn has no chance to play me false; a constant watch shall be kept over her. I will command Augusta not to lose sight of her while Frank remains in the neighborhood. Why don't he go on his travels? He has seen nothing of his own country, and there is as much worth seeing on this side of the water as on the other."</p> 
               <p>"The winter season is not the usual time selected for a tour of pleasure," replied Bessie, with a peculiar smile, "but I believe that Frank intends to set out on his travels very soon. But he does not wish to go alone, and perhaps he may ask you for a companion."</p> 
               <p>"He need not ask for <emph>you</emph> yet awhile, and as to Evelyn, she is quite out of the question. Come, sing to me again; my nerves are all unstrung from discussing this unwelcome topic."</p> 
               <p>Bessie took up her guitar, struck the chords in a discordant manner, and rising, said:</p> 
               <p>"I beg that you will excuse me, papa, for I am too much disturbed in mind to sing at present. Besides, I promised Minny to return to Ashurst before night, and I must set out at once to reach there before dark."</p> 
               <p>"Confound Minny! I believe she is jealous of your stay near me. I have seen her look at us when we are together in way I did not half like. She thinks, because she has had charge of you from your infancy, that her claims on you are superior to mine."</p> 
               <p>"Her claims are indeed great, sir, for she has been more than a mother to me. I owe to her all that I am. She educated me, formed my principles, and from her I must have caught the charm of manner you so often compliment."</p> 
               <p>"You are a zealous advocate, Miss Ashley, but I wish you would not speak of my step-mother as if she is entitled to more of your affection than you bestow on me. Since you must go, give me a kiss, and be sure to come back in the morning."</p> 
               <p>"I shall be certain to do that, sir," she significantly replied, and stooping over, she lightly touched her lips to his forehead.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! bah! that is no caress at all! You are wonderfully chary of your lips, you gay coquette, but when I am stronger, and able to move about by myself, I will take my revenge for your coyness."</p> 
               <p>An inexplicable feeling of dread seized on her at this threat, but she made no reply, and effected her escape from the room.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE EAVESDROPPER.</head> 
               <p>FLYING into the apartment in which Evelyn sat with her fancy work, guarded by her step-mother, Bessie said:</p> 
               <p>"Papa wishes you to go to him, I believe, Mrs. Ashley. I am compelled to go back to Ashurst to-night, so I cannot remain any longer with him."</p> 
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6346-00000077"/> 
               <p>With a dark look, Augusta arose at once, and said, with an accent of pique:</p> 
               <p>"I suppose he can tolerate me when you are not within reach. Bessie Ashley, the time will come to you, as it has to myself, when that icy-hearted man will cast you off as unfeelingly as he does me. I love him-you know that I do-yet-yet-you come between him and me every day, every hour."</p> 
               <p>Bessie's forbearance was almost worn out, and she felt as if she must burst in tears, but she controlled herself, and quietly said:</p> 
               <p>"Do not blame me, mamma, for what I cannot help. I would willingly give place to you if I were permitted to do so."</p> 
               <p>"Don't tell me that-I know better," was the passionate response. "Can I not see for myself that your head is as much turned by his flatteries as my own once was-alas! so much the worse for me! But if you were fifty times his daughter I would not stand-"</p> 
               <p>What further she might have said was cut short by a violent ring from the bell Ashley usually kept beside him, and Augusta hurried away to obey the summons so peremptorily given.</p> 
               <p>Bessie looked after her with an expression of painful surprise, but she had no sooner disappeared than she turned to Evelyn, who was anxiously regarding her face, and said:</p> 
               <p>"We have not a moment to lose, Evelyn, for some one will be sent hither to overhear what I have to say to you."</p> 
               <p>She paused, as if uncertain how to go on, and Evelyn grew white as she whispered:</p> 
               <p>"What is it, Bessie? Something painful, I can very well see."</p> 
               <p>"Only this: that there is no hope save in your own energy and Frank's devotion. <emph>He</emph> insists that I shall eventually become the wife of Frank, and openly declares his determination to prevent you from marrying at all. Oh, Evelyn, if you fail Frank now, in his desperation, I am afraid he will be capable of giving you up and consenting to fulfil the contract out of spite."</p> 
               <p>"How can you say such a thing of so noble a man as Frank," replied Evelyn, almost angrily. I <emph>will not</emph> fail him. I am made so wretched here, that any change must be for the better. I place my fate in his hands and yours, and bid you act for me. What you think right, I will do."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Now</emph> I know you for my true sister," exclaimed Bessie, delightedly, "and I promise you that you shall be rescued from your slavery. I am going home to consult with Frank to-night. He shall write out our plans in detail, and I will find means to give you the letter without any one being aware of it."</p> 
               <p>"Yes-I understand; but mamma is coming back; I hear her stealthy step approaching," whispered Evelyn, in great agitation, and the next moment Augusta opened the door, and commanded Evelyn to go to her father immediately. Without daring to glance toward Bessie, she gathered up her work and left the room accompanied by her step-mother.</p> 
               <p>"Poor slave!" sighed the young girl. "She never knows what it is to draw a free breath. She lives in constant dread of that fearful man it is our misfortune to claim for our father. I am an unnatural wretch, I suppose, for I have no soft feeling for him which can excuse his conduct toward poor Evelyn."</p> 
               <p>She sighed as she donned her riding skirt and hat, for the afternoon was so mild that she had rode over on horseback. But when she found herself mounted on her high-mettled steed, flying over the ground that lay between Arden Place and Ashurst, her spirits revived, and she felt her courage rising to meet and conquer the difficulties that arose before her thick and fast.</p> 
               <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6346-00000078"/> 
               <p>Twilight was gathering when she dismounted at the door of Ashurst, and mild as the weather was, she felt chilled through with her rapid ride through the sunless woods. She found a bright fire burning, and tea ready to be served as soon as she made her appearance. The affectionate welcome she received both from Mrs. Ashley and Wentworth brought back brightness to her brow and smiles to her lips, for to be loved and petted made the happiness of Bessie's life.</p> 
               <p>Her gay spirits throughout the evening almost convinced Frank that nothing had occurred during her absence to depress her, but as they were separating for the night she found an opportunity to whisper to him as she believed unnoticed by Mrs. Ashley:</p> 
               <p>"Come back here in an hour, Frank. I have something important to communicate to you."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley's ears were exceedingly keen, and more acute than Wentworth, she had seen that in spite of Bessie's gayety, something was lying heavy at her heart. She caught the drift of the low-breathed words, careful as Bessie believed she had been to evade her notice, and she vainly asked herself what her daughter could possibly have to say to Frank which required such secrecy; and why was it so pressing that it must be told that very night.</p> 
               <p>Torturing her mind with vain conjectures, Mrs. Ashley hastened her night toilette and dismissed her servant, that she might be free to act as she might deem best.</p> 
               <p>Wrapped in her heavy dressing robe, she sat gazing in the fire and thinking over the words she had overheard. Repulsive as such a course would once have been to her, she now determined to be present at that mysterious interview, and stealthily learn what confidence her daughter had to make to Frank.</p> 
               <p>If she could only gain the sitting-room without being detected, she could easily conceal herself in one of the deep recesses in front of the windows, over which heavy curtains fell. Once securely ensconced behind the folds of drapery, she could hear all that passed between the two, and take her own measures accordingly.</p> 
               <p>She set her door ajar, and eagerly listened for Frank's step as he retired to his own apartment. It was so long before she heard any movement from that direction, that she began to fear he would defeat her intentions by awaiting Bessie's return without going to his room.</p> 
               <p>But he at length came out, and no sooner had the glimmer of the light he carried in his hand been shut from the hall by the closing of his door, than the excited watcher flitted noiselessly from her room, descended the thickly carpeted stairs without an audible footfall, and as silently entered the lower apartment.</p> 
               <p>The ruddy glow of the hickory fire cast its warm gleams on the crimson covered furniture and flickered over the pictures on the walls. The air of luxury and comfort which pervaded the room caused her to mutter:</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Can</emph> those two young simpletons be plotting to throw away such a home as this? Madness such as that must be circumvented at any cost to myself. No-I am not wrong in doing <emph>anything</emph> that will save my child from ruin."</p> 
               <p>Fearing that Wentworth might speedily return, Mrs. Ashley, after a hurried glance around, ensconced herself on an ottoman behind the curtain nearest the fire. She had taken the precaution to wrap herself in a large shawl before coming down, and she proceeded to make herself comfortable in her place of concealment.</p> 
               <p>Immediately in front of the recess a large arm-chair usually stood, and she arranged this with the folds of the curtain in such a manner that she could easily see all that passed in the room. With little fear of being detected,<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6346-00000079"/> she then waited in breathless impatience for the return of the two on whose confidence she was about to intrude in so unjustifiable a manner.</p> 
               <p>The house was buried in that deep silence which comes with night in the country in the cold season of the year, and with ears sharpened to painful acuteness, Mrs. Ashley could detect no sound of approaching footsteps.</p> 
               <p>Five-ten minutes, and then the door was opened without the slightest premonitory warning, and Wentworth came in, wearing a pair of soft slippers, and bearing in one hand his portfolio and in the other his lamp.</p> 
               <p>He drew the table near the fire, placed them upon it, and then sat down with his head resting upon his hand, his eyes fixed upon the glowing coals with a dreamy and very sad expression.</p> 
               <p>He had not sat thus many moments, when his thoughts were interrupted by the appearance of Bessie. She came in with a frightened expression, and said with a shiver:</p> 
               <p>"I was afraid to bring a light past Minny's door, lest she should see it, and I am all in a tremor at having to come down that dark staircase into the black-looking hall alone. Oh, Frank! I do not know that I am doing right to meet you in this clandestine manner, but there was no other chance to inform you of the result of my conversation with my father before I return to him to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>"Don't be nervous about that, Bessie. You and I have been reared together as brother and sister, and there is no more harm in your meeting me here to-night than if we really stood in that relation to each other. I am in a tremor of anxiety to hear what passed between you and my uncle. From your manner to-night I augured favorably."</p> 
               <p>"Then my spirits wofully deceived you, poor Frank. I was happy to escape from the depressing atmosphere of Arden Place, and the sight of Minny's affectionate face brightened me up a little; but in reality my heart was very sad and apprehensive."</p> 
               <p>"On what grounds, Bessie? Don't torture me by circumlocution, for I cannot bear much more than I have already endured. A more miserable, poor wretch than I have been for the last two months it would be hard to find. How did you introduce the subject to your father, and what did he say?"</p> 
               <p>"I believe he introduced it himself, and I took advantage of the opening to speak out. It is of no use, Frank; we shall never gain his consent to violate the conditions of grandpa's will, and he vows that Evelyn shall never marry. Do not feel hurt when I tell you what he said of her, for it is necessary that you should know it."</p> 
               <p>"What was it? I promise not to feel annoyed at you for repeating it, Bessie."</p> 
               <p>"He insists that she has no constitution, and must die early; and-and he said that she is liable to mental derangement. You know that her mother died in a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">maison de sante,</foreign> but I do not believe that my sister has any taint of madness, in spite of papa's assertion."</p> 
               <p>Wentworth uttered an exclamation of rage.</p> 
               <p>"I tell you what my uncle means to do, Bessie; he will tortune my poor darling till he drives her to madness; but he will first get some settlement from her which will enable him to retain her fortune, and at his death give it to Maitland."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Frank, Frank, how can you suspect my father of such turpitude as that. If I could believe it, the little affection I have tried to cherish for him would die out at once."</p> 
               <p>"Bessie, I cannot help speaking the truth, even if it does destroy your respect for my uncle. He is a base and heartless man; and I tell you he only hopes that such a<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6346-00000080"/> fate may come to my poor Evelyn. She is in no more danger of losing her reason than I am, if I can rescue her from the infernal power of the man she is so unfortunate as to call father before he has time to carry out the infamous programme I believe he has laid out."</p> 
               <p>"Don't forget that Mr. Ashley is my father, too," pleaded Bessie. "You have much to bear, but I cannot hear him spoken of with such bitterness without extreme pain. You know that his will is indomitable, and he has vowed to me to-day that I shall hold you in honor bound to me. I saw Evelyn a few moments before I left, and warned her on what she must decide."</p> 
               <p>"And what did she say?" he eagerly asked. "She is wearied out with the life they lead her, and she told me that any escape from it will be welcome. She leaves her fate in our hands."</p> 
               <p>Frank sprang up, exclaiming:</p> 
               <p>"Eureka! then we shall baffle my uncle yet. Oh, Bessie, you are the dearest girl and the best of friends, to bring me such news as this."</p> 
               <p>Bessie apprehensively said:</p> 
               <p>"Hu-ush, Frank. You forget that this interview must be kept a profound secret from every one; and if you go on so, Minny may overhear you, and come down to see who is making such a noise. We should be in a pretty scrape if she were to do such a thing."</p> 
               <p>"Oh bother about Minny! Tell me all about my angel, and the ways and means to evade the Argus eyes set to watch her."</p> 
               <p>"Well, sit down quietly, and listen to my plan. On this day week Kate's wedding takes place, and I have wrung from papa a reluctant consent that Evelyn shall go to it with me. Mrs. Ashley is to accompany her as a sort of body-guard, but when we are once in the crowd that will be there, it will be easy enough to find some one to occupy her attention a few moments in which which Evelyn can be spirited away. She must seize that opportunity to join you, and before my father could hear of her evasion, you might take a night train and be far beyond pursuit."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," assented Frank. "So far, so good, if we can only carry your idea out. The difficulty will be to throw Aunt Augusta off guard."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, we shall manage that some way. But it will be best for you to go away for a season, and give the impression that you intend to be absent some time. You can leave Rufus Welby to make such arrangements for you as will ensure success to our elopement. He has entered heart and soul into your interests, and he told me, the last time I saw him, that he would do all that is in his power to serve you and Evelyn. He seems deeply interested in all that concerns my sister."</p> 
               <p>"Yes; he pities her, as every one else does who has had an opportunity of seeing how she is treated. I shall call on Rufus in the morning and ensure his assistance."</p> 
               <p>"You must go away to-morrow, Frank, but I will communicate with you through Rufus. You can remain in the neighborhood incognito, and make your appearance at the Oaks on the night of the wedding, at the hour agreed on for the elopement."</p> 
               <p>"Nothing could be better, Bessie, and I consent to your entire programme. I can trust you to spirit Evelyn away from that detestable step-dame of hers. I really don't know but I could find it in my heart to twist her neck a little if she undertakes to circumvent us. But you are too clever to be outwitted by such a woman as Aunt Augusta."</p> 
               <p>"I will do my best to bring the affair to a happy termination, and I do hope that your disappearance will put<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6346-00000081"/> an end to the necessity for so much deception on my part. I sometimes feel as though I am a domestic Guy Fawkes, though I trust that <emph>our</emph> plot will not meet the fate of his."</p> 
               <p>"Only keep Evelyn's courage up, and I have no fears for the result, for there is no traitor to betray <emph>us.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>The concealed listener winced, and made and involuntary movement, which Wentworth detected, and he turned his eyes to the spot from which it proceeded with an expression of eager inquiry which caused Mrs. Ashley's heart to die within her. If he should draw aside the curtain, and discover her in the contemptible character of an eavesdropper, what could she say in her own defence that would restore to her the respect of the young plotters-save her from the contempt of her own child?</p> 
               <p>Frank hurriedly said:</p> 
               <p>"I surely heard a movement in that recess, Bessie. I will go and see if any one is there. It would be terrible to have our plans overheard, and exposed hereafter."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, nonsense, it is only the wind-it is beginning to rise-don't you hear it moaning through the trees? No one can be there, so sit still and listen to me. Let us complete the details of our enterprise, for this is the last opportunity we shall have for doing so. There can be no one in the house at this time of the night but those who belong here. The servants have gone to their houses, and Minny is safe in her own room."</p> 
               <p>"I suppose you are right, Bessie, and we are the only night owls about just now. In the first place, I must write to Evelyn, and give her an account of what we have agreed on. I brought down my portfolio for that purpose."</p> 
               <p>"That is exactly what I was going to propose. I will find the means of transferring your letter to her without suspicion, though I know that we are constantly watched when we are together. You must have it in readiness by morning, as I promised papa to return to Arden immediately after breakfast."</p> 
               <p>"You left my uncle to believe that you may eventually yield to the fate they all seem bent on forcing on us. Minny is as bad as he is on that point."</p> 
               <p>"Don't say anything against Minny, for you know she loves us both, and thinks she is acting for the best, though she takes a wrong view of what will make us happy. What could I do, Frank, but continue to act a part to my father? He has not the faintest suspicion that I have a lover of my own; that I am as anxious to escape the shackles they would impose on us as you can be, and I dread the hour in which that revelation is made to him."</p> 
               <p>"And well you may. I know something of my uncle's white rages, and I shrink from the thought of what you may have to bear. If he proves unmanageable, what will you and Delancey do?"</p> 
               <p>She sighed heavily, then half smiled and said:</p> 
               <p>"We may be forced to follow your example, but that shall be the last resource with me. It will be enough for me to help one child to desert him, without running away from my father myself."</p> 
               <p>An hour was spent in arranging the minutest details of the proposed elopement, to which Mrs. Ashley listened with suppressed breathing, treasuring each particular in her memory for future use.</p> 
               <p>At length Bessie arose and said:</p> 
               <p>"I have spoken of everything I could think of that can be necessary, and now I will retire and leave you to write your letter to Evelyn."</p> 
               <p>Wentworth bade her good-night and went with her to the foot of the staircase, holding the light till she descended and had time to take refuge in her room. He then came in, closed the door carefully and sat down to his task.</p> 
               <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6346-00000082"/> 
               <p>Page after page was filled, and the weary watcher thought he would never end the outpourings of his love. She was afraid to make the slightest movement lest his quick ears should detect it, and she sat chilled and wretched; wondering if he would ever cease. By this time the fire had died down, and the room was beginning to grow cold, the rising wind forced a passage for itself around the old-fashioned window and filled the recess in which she crouched with the cold outside air.</p> 
               <p>Frank himself at length became conscious that he was growing chilly, and he threw the brands together, hastened to a conclusion, and to the intense relief of Mrs. Ashley, he gathered up his writing-materials, and passed from the room without casting a glance behind him.</p> 
               <p>After waiting a few moments to assure herself that there was no danger of his return, she crept from her hiding-place and stood a few moments before the dying fire. A sudden blaze that flashed up from an expiring fire-brand revealed her face, wearing a pale, set expression, and her locked lips unclosed to mutter:</p> 
               <p>"Who would have believed that their rebellion could have reached such a climax as this! There will be more than one visitor at Arden to-morrow, Miss Bessie; and for once I shall try my powers of persuasion against yours with success. There is now but one step between myself and ruin, and I must take it, cost what it will to others."</p> 
               <p>She glided up the darkened stairway, gained her own room, and was soon in her luxurious bed. But there was little sleep for the guilty lady of Ashurst that night.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">MRS. ASHLEY DISCLOSES HER SECRET.</head> 
               <p>THE next morning, when Mrs. Ashley made her appearance at breakfast, she looked so wretched and depressed that Bessie inquired after her health with much concern.</p> 
               <p>She wearily said:</p> 
               <p>"Nothing is the matter with me but want of exercise. I have scarcely left the house for the last week, and I think some change will do me good. I will drive over to Arden with you this morning, Bessie. It is too cold for you to go on horseback, and I have ordered the pony carriage. You can drive me there, my dear?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes, with the greatest pleasure, Minny. I dearly love to drive those spirited little animals, and the fresh morning air will revive you. I wish you would make a diversion in my favor to-day, and release me from papa's exactions for a while. I wish to brighten up poor Evelyn by talking with her a little."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, my love. The poor child does lead a wretched life, and I see little prospect of its becoming better as long as Mr. Ashley lives. It is a pity that he will make himself a terror to his family."</p> 
               <p>"You have seen nothing yet," said Wentworth, significantly. "I have borne the brunt of his fury more than once, and I assure you that the petty outbreaks of temper of which my uncle is daily guilty, are mere child's play<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6346-00000083"/> compared to the tornado of wrath that bursts on all around him when he is fairly aroused."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley shivered and changed color. All the worst passions of this fearful man she was about to arouse, not only against the defenceless Evelyn, but possibly against her own daughter, and what the result might be, who could foretell?</p> 
               <p>To protect Bessie from Ashley's insane wrath, she might even be compelled to avow the secret of her life, and claim the right of herself controlling her fate.</p> 
               <p>In that contingency, what should she gain by betraying the lovers, and leaving poor Evelyn to the unrestrained fury of her father? Such doubts assailed Mrs. Ashley while the morning meal lasted, but when she was once in the carriage, and on her way to Arden Place, the fresh morning air restored firmness to her nerves, and gave strength to her will. It was now a question of self-preservation, and she must act promptly, or see the fabric she had reared with such infinite pains crumble into ruins at her feet.</p> 
               <p>The morning was brilliantly clear; the sun had tempered the frosty keenness of the atmosphere, and its exhilarating influence acted on Bessie as a stimulating elixir. As her glossy steeds flew through the sinuosities of the road, guided by her skilful hand, she regained her usual confidence and joyous spirits. Under less painful circumstances, Mrs. Ashley must have caught the infection of her gayety, but just now a weight so leaden pressed upon her heart, that she felt as if all buoyant feeling was forever banished from it.</p> 
               <p>When they drew up in front of the house, she felt as if sentence of death were about to be pronounced upon herself, and she almost recoiled from the purpose which had brought her there. But she cast away the last doubt as to the necessity of immediate action, when she witnessed the meeting between the two girls, and saw the letter Frank had sent adroitly passed into the possession of Evelyn.</p> 
               <p>On entering Mr. Ashley's sanctum, they found him apparently in better health and spirits than usual. He had spread before him a pack of cards, with which he was playing solitaire, an amusement he never sought unless he was in what, for him, might be called a good humor.</p> 
               <p>When the two ladies entered, he threw aside the cards and greeted them very cordially.</p> 
               <p>"I am glad to see you with Bessie, Mrs. Ashley, for of late you do not often favor us with your company. Do you know, I begin to fancy that you are jealous of the attention my daughter gives me? I told her as much last evening."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley tried to laugh, and parry this attack with her usual tact, but she found it more and more difficult to play the part assigned her in the strange domestic drama passing around her.</p> 
               <p>She forced herself to say:</p> 
               <p>"I am afraid that it is you who are jealous, Mr. Ashley. I am certainly entitled to a very large share of Bessie's love, for she has been the chief object of my life for eighteen years. After devoting myself to her as I have done, I, of course, claim as deep an interest in her as the father who has known her but a few months."</p> 
               <p>A slight frown knit his brows, and he testily replied:</p> 
               <p>"You make out a pretty case, Mrs. Ashley, but no tie can be so strong as that between parent and child, so I wish you to make up your mind that Bessie belongs more to me than to you. I think I have conceded a great deal in permitting her still to reside at Ashurst with you."</p> 
               <p>"It is the home her grandfather left her, and he expressed<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6346-00000084"/> pressed the hope that she would never leave its shelter," replied Mrs. Ashley, gently, but decidedly. "Since it is your wish that the provisions of his will shall be carried out in <emph>other</emph> respects, I suppose, of course, you will abide by this one."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps-I can't say, for it's a great bore to have Bessie away from me half the time. I have been looking over the copy of my father's will that Frank brought with him to Vienna, and if it were not for one consideration I would follow my first impulse, and take measures to have it set aside."</p> 
               <p>A slight spasm of pain passed over Mrs. Ashley's features, and she grew deadly pale; but after a slight pause, she calmly said:</p> 
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> would gain nothing by that, Mr. Ashley. I came over this morning to ask a private conference with you on this very subject, and I shall be glad if you will accord it to me as soon as possible."</p> 
               <p>"Nothing could suit my humor better, Madam. Since I am a fixture in this room, with the infernal swelling of my limbs which makes it difficult for me to move when I am once placed in my chair, we will remain here. The outsiders can be sent away, and you can develope this mystery to me at your leisure. Bessie, my rose of Provence, go with Augusta and Evelyn into the next room. Come and kiss me before you leave me, for you look as fresh and bright as the morning itself."</p> 
               <p>She laughed and saucily replied:</p> 
               <p>"If you will be on your good behavior with Minny, I will give you a kiss before I go home, but not now," and she escaped from the room before he could remonstrate, holding Evelyn by the hand.</p> 
               <p>Augusta followed them closely, but Maitland made a diversion in their favor by calling loudly on his mother to inspect a contusion he had just received in attempting to climb a tall persimmon tree. He had fallen and hurt himself quite severely, and the fond mother rushed to him to ascertain that he had sustained no mortal injury.</p> 
               <p>A servant assured the two girls that the lad, who was rarely seen within doors except at meal times, had received no serious damage, and they closed the door of the room, and availed themselves of Augusta's brief absence to consult eagerly together. Bessie said:</p> 
               <p>"You must not attempt to look at Frank's letter here, Evelyn. Your mother might come in at any moment and surprise you. I can tell you our plans in ten words, though Frank has taken nearly as many pages to set them forth. Have you no friend in the house who can, at the last pinch, help you to get away what you will need to take with you?"</p> 
               <p>"There is not a soul I can rely on. My nurse, the English woman who came over with us, would stand by me to the last if she was able to do so, but she is ill in bed, and has scarcely been able to sit up since we came here. The climate does not seem to agree with her, but she is affected by it more singularly than any one I ever saw. She possesses some power over papa, I am convinced, and if she had not been unable to leave her room, I scarcely think that I should have been treated so harshly as I have lately been. Oh, Bessie, if my father loved me only half as well as he does you, I could almost find it in my heart to cling to him in preference to Frank, much as I am attached to him."</p> 
               <p>"Poor little outraged darling!" said Bessie, pitifully, "your father cares little for you, as I have good reason to know, and you have no refuge but in Frank's stead-fast devotion. On the night of Kate Welby's wedding you must be ready to go with him. Once on the train no one<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6346-00000085"/> can overtake and bring you back before you have gained another State, and found a minister to marry you."</p> 
               <p>"And you, Bessie? Oh, my father's anger will be fearful, and you must be left to bear the brunt of it alone."</p> 
               <p>"Do not fear for me, Evelyn. Have you not borne the wildest outburst of his wrath, and do you not daily writhe under the scathing bitterness of his evil temper; bearing it with the patience of an angel? Why shall I not have my turn, too, little sister? But Mr. Ashley will never revile me as he does you, because he knows very well that I would not submit to it."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, he loves <emph>you,</emph> and he will forbear toward you," murmured the poor girl, whose tender heart yearned toward the tyrant who daily trampled on her, and lacerated her feelings in every manner that his fiendish temper could suggest.</p> 
               <p>Bessie had barely time to give a succinct account of what had been agreed on between herself and Wentworth, when Augusta came in leading Maitland by the hand, with his head bound up with brown paper dipped in vinegar, and a patch of sticking plaster on the end of his nose.</p> 
               <p>Bessie involuntary smiled at the quizzical appearance he made, and he doubled his fists and resentfully said:</p> 
               <p>"If I am a guy you needn't laugh, Bessie; you and Evelyn had better mind your P's and Q's, or I'll tell what happened at the pond that first day I ever saw you. You know all your plots would come to nothing if I told pa about Frank and-"</p> 
               <p>He paused abruptly when he caught the dismayed expression of Bessie's face, and awkwardly added:</p> 
               <p>"I dare say it meant nothing at all, so you needn't look as if you are going to faint, Evy. <emph>I</emph> sha'n't tell on you."</p> 
               <p>His mother glanced suspiciously from one to the other, and at once made up her mind to what she had not before suspected-that Bessie was doing everything in her power to promote the marriage of Frank and Evelyn.</p> 
               <p>If Augusta had dared to do so, she would have instantly carried her discovery to her husband, but she feared to interrupt his interview with Mrs. Ashley even for so important a communication as this was. She was, however, soon to learn that a much more appalling state of affairs than she dreamed of was even now being revealed to him.</p> 
               <p>No sooner had the rest of the party left the room, than Mrs. Ashley drew her chair near the one occupied by her step-son, and said:</p> 
               <p>"I have a painful communication to make to you, but I will defer it till we have discussed some business affairs connected with what I have to tell you."</p> 
               <p>"I am all attention, Madam."</p> 
               <p>"You just now spoke of Judge Ashley's will as if you believed you would be benefited yourself by setting it aside. It becomes my duty to inform you that I have in my possession a codicil to that instrument confided to me by your father, a few days before his death, with strict injunctions never to produce it unless there was a prospect that the union between Frank and Bessie would be deferred beyond six months from the time of his decease. It lacks but a few weeks of that time, and Bessie informs me that it is your wish that her marriage shall be indefinitely postponed."</p> 
               <p>"Why has not this been told to me before, Mrs. Ashley?-and what are the contents of this codicil? Are you aware of them?"</p> 
               <p>"A copy of it was given to me by my husband, with permission to open it, if I deemed such a course necessary to carry out his last intentions. Last night a startling revelation was made to me, which you shall presently hear.<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6346-00000086"/> I then determined to break the seal of my copy of the codicil; I did so, and I have brought it for you to examine yourself."</p> 
               <p>She offered him a folded paper. He opened and hastily glanced over it, and in a tone of mingled rage and alarm said:</p> 
               <p>"This positively states that unless Judge Ashley's grandchildren are united within six months after his death, the estate shall be left in trust to be applied to charitable purposes. Would you produce such a document as this in court, Mrs. Ashley, and beggar the girl you profess to love so dearly? What! was my father mad that he left the ancient family estate to feed paupers! A pretty destiny truly for the wealth, the wisdom, and industry of my ancestors has accumulated. Those two contumacious children shall be married out of hand. I will not listen to a petition or another week of delay."</p> 
               <p>"That is the only course now open to you, Mr. Ashley, for I shall feel bound to produce the original codicil if the six months pass away without the conditions being fulfilled. Painful as it would be to me to deprive these two young people of the inheritance, I should have no alternative left me."</p> 
               <p>Ashley restrained his rising wrath, and in a constrained tone said:</p> 
               <p>"And now, Madam, will you be so good as to inform me of the circumstance that moved you to examine this paper? If I understood your hint aright, it has an important bearing on the case."</p> 
               <p>She sighed heavily and deprecatingly said:</p> 
               <p>"Promise me to restrain your anger toward <emph>both</emph> your daughters, Mr. Ashley-especially toward Evelyn, for I am afraid that you do not show much lenity to her when she is in fault."</p> 
                
               <p>"Oh ho! Evelyn is mixed up in it, is she-and of course Frank Wentworth is the hero of your story. I only wish I was the autocrat of Russia and had that young gentleman in my power. I would send him to Siberia, and plunge him into the deepest mine that could be found to hide him from the light of day. Well, Madam, I am waiting to hear of the discovery you seem to have made; and anxious to learn its nature."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley believed she had strung her courage to the requisite point to complete her treachery, but the savage fire which flashed from the black eyes that eagerly scanned her face, caused her heart to faint within her, and she trembled at what lay before her.</p> 
               <p>Then she remembered the crumbling precipice on which she herself stood, and nerved herself anew for the task she had undertaken. With tolerable firmness she said:</p> 
               <p>"I came over this morning to warn you that if Evelyn is permitted to attend Miss Welby's wedding, she will evade her step-mother and elope with her cousin."</p> 
               <p>A savage oath escaped his lips:</p> 
               <p>"Are you <emph>sure</emph> of this, Madam?"</p> 
               <p>"Perfectly sure. I overheard all the details of the plan agreed on by Frank and Bessie, and she now has a letter in her pocket which explains them to her."</p> 
               <p>"Bessie! plotting to give her betrothed to another! I did not believe the child had so much treachery in her. Why should she ruin her fortune in this absurd manner?"</p> 
               <p>"She has gone over to their side because she has a lover of her own whose acquaintance she made during her summer tour. As soon as Frank and Evelyn are safely disposed of, he will come forward to ask your consent to bestow her hand on him."</p> 
               <p>While she thus spoke the face of Ashley would have<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6346-00000087"/> made a study for a painter who wished to express every degree of fury which the human countenance is capable of portraying. For many moments he was incapable of speaking, but at length he gasped:</p> 
               <p>"Who-who is this man who will dare to come hither on such an errand as that?"</p> 
               <p>"He is a young artist of some ability, but no fortune. Under any circumstances, he would be no match for Bessie."</p> 
               <p>"His name Madam-<emph>his name!</emph>" he raved.</p> 
               <p>"It is Delancey-Ernest Delancey."</p> 
               <p>Ashley fell back as if a shot had pierced his heart, and the purple flush which anger had called to his face faded suddenly away. He sat staring at the speaker as if unable to realize what she had said.</p> 
               <p>Alarmed at his appearance, Mrs. Ashley arose and held a glass of water to his lips. After swallowing a small portion, the power of speech came back to him, and in a voice of concentrated resolution he said:</p> 
               <p>"Bessie shall never give her hand to any other than Frank. I do not like him, but she must consult her interests in marrying him. Even if he were out of the question, this-this Delancey is the last man on earth that I should be willing to give her to."</p> 
               <p>"Do you know anything against him, Mr. Ashley?"</p> 
               <p>"It matters not. I know who he is, and that is sufficient to induce me to crush his pretensions under foot. He need not come here to make them known, for they will meet with a contemptuous refusal. The son of George Delancey shall never wed a daughter of mine."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley made no reply, and after a pause he thoughtfully said:</p> 
               <p>"I wish I had before been aware of the existence of this codicil. If I had known that my father desired this marriage to take place within a given time, I would have resisted sisted the charm Bessie has thrown around me, and in spite of her entreaties for delay, I would at once have given her to my nephew. Now I dread parting from her; but since another lover, even more distasteful to me than Frank, is in the field, I will lay my commands on them to be married immediately."</p> 
               <p>"But how are you to ensure obedience, Mr. Ashley? Frank is not under your control, and he seems bent on running off with Evelyn."</p> 
               <p>An expression of savage triumph crossed his face, and he viciously said:</p> 
               <p>"I will rule him through <emph>her.</emph> She belongs to me; nobody has any right to interfere between her and myself, and if Frank refuses to yield to my will, I will lock Evelyn up and keep her on bread and water till I can send her back to the convent in which she was educated, and have her shut up there for life."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley regarded him in silent terror, for she felt that he was quite capable of doing what he threatened. She was filled with remorse for the part she believed she had been compelled to play to save herself, and she trembled at the thought of the suffering she had brought on poor Evelyn in the first flush of youth and hope, to ensure the accomplishment of her own wishes.</p> 
               <p>Self-condemned as she felt, the next movement of Ashley's was not calculated to reassure her. He sharply rang the bell that stood on the table beside him, and when she asked him what he required, the reply was:</p> 
               <p>"I require the immediate presence of those young criminals, madam. I will arraign them before a tribunal from which they shall soon learn there is no appeal."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Ashley, I entreat that you will not expose the part I have played before Bessie. She will never forgive me for having spied on and then betrayed her."</p> 
               <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6346-00000088"/> 
               <p>"Madam," was the stern reply, "you chose your own course of action, and you must abide the consequences. If Miss Ashley appeals to you to know how you obtained your information, it rests with yourself to enlighten her. <emph>I</emph> have not asked you in what manner it was gained, and I leave it to yourself to inform her or not, as you may see fit."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley saw that he had no pity for her extreme agitation; she believed he would be well pleased if Bessie discovered the whole extent of her treachery, and as a natural result, recoiled from her who had proved herself capable of practicing it.</p> 
               <p>The bell was answered by the appearance of Augusta at the door. She came forward with a mysterious air, and spoke to her husband in a low tone.</p> 
               <p>"I have been impatiently listening for your summons, Leon, for I have something very important to say to you."</p> 
               <p>"Never mind it now; I have no time to attend to you. Bring hither those two young traitors, and shut and lock the doors when they come in."</p> 
               <p>His angry face and stern tones caused his wife to tremble, for she knew by the signs that a formidable tempest was about to burst, and she also knew that whoever might be to blame, she would be sure to come in for a large share of vituperation before the paroxysm was over.</p> 
               <p>When she again entered the apartment in which she had left the two girls trying to console Maitland for his bruises, she was so pale that Evelyn apprehensively asked:</p> 
               <p>"What is it, mamma? What has happened to discompose you so much?"</p> 
               <p>"Not much, as yet. I only dread what is to come. Your father is in one of his white rages, and he has ordered you and Bessie to come to him at once. Mrs. Ashley has told him something which seems almost to have set him beside himself."</p> 
                
               <p>"Minny? Impossible!" exclaimed Bessie. "<emph>She</emph> would never do anything to arouse his anger against Evelyn or myself. Come, sister, let us go at once and confront the ogre in his den."</p> 
               <p>"Phew!" whistled Maitland; "I shall be off before he sends for <emph>me.</emph> I have no fancy for being drowned in scalding water. When you have been flayed alive once, Bessie, you'll know what it is to see the governor in his high trantrums. Good-bye. I hope something will be left of you and Evy."</p> 
               <p>He darted from the room and was soon out of the house.</p> 
               <p>Like a culprit going to execution, Augusta followed the lead of Bessie, who was compelled almost to carry the frightened Evelyn in her arms.</p> 
               <p>Her own heart was beating painfully, but her spirit rose to meet the emergency; and when she confronted the angry face of Ashley, her eyes did not quail beneath the baleful glare of his as he bent them on her with an expression that he believed would make her shrink within herself.</p> 
               <p>But she stood calm and, outwardly, self-possessed, and he saw that there was little hope of reducing her to the slavish submission of the other serfs of his household.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">ASHLEY AS JUDGE, JURY AND JAILOR.</head> 
               <p>A SINGLE glance at Mrs. Ashley's face showed Bessie that she was suffering from intense emotion, but of what nature she could not divine.</p> 
               <p>"Stand there, just in front of me, and answer to the<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6346-00000089"/> charges that I am about to bring against you," thundered the self-appointed judge; "and know from the beginning that you are already found guilty, and your punishment decided on."</p> 
               <p>Bessie pleadingly said:</p> 
               <p>"I must place Evelyn on a seat, papa, for she is not able to stand. See to what a condition her dread of your anger has already brought her."</p> 
               <p>"If she so deeply fears it, why has she so recklessly incurred it?" he sneered, without glancing at the white face and trembling form of the young girl. "Put her on a chair, then, and if you choose to do so, sit down beside her."</p> 
               <p>"No, I thank you; I will stand till I hear why I am arraigned before you in this shameful manner, as if I were the basest of criminals. The chief of a savage tribe could hardly show less consideration for his daughters than you are showing for yours."</p> 
               <p>A grim smile flitted over Ashley's lips at this retort, and he muttered:</p> 
               <p>"Pluck to the last; the girl has not a cowardly drop of blood in her veins."</p> 
               <p>He then spoke aloud:</p> 
               <p>"You may assume a high tone and fight your own battle to the last, Bessie, but you will find yourself conquered in the end. Augusta, advance, if you please, and examine the pocket of Evelyn's dress. Bring me whatever you may find there that is suspicious."</p> 
               <p>Poor Evelyn instinctively cluched at the precious missive she had not yet even had an opportunity to unseal; but at a flash from her father's eyes her hand fell nervously by her side, and Frank's letter was drawn forth and handed over to her terrible accuser.</p> 
               <p>With great show of deliberation, Ashley drew out his eye-glass, carefully adjusted it, and read the superscription.</p> 
                
               <p>"Hum-things begin to wear an ominous aspect. This is my nephew's writing, and by what right he dares to address you, Evelyn Ashley, I have yet to learn. Speak-tell me how this letter was conveyed to your hands!"</p> 
               <p>The white lips of Evelyn moved, but no audible sound issued from them, and after glancing compassionately at her agitated face, Bessie recklessly said:</p> 
               <p>"Let Evelyn alone, and ask an explanation of me. She is in no state to be tortured by you. <emph>I</emph> brought that letter to her, and I am ready to bear the consequences. I see that all is discovered, and I don't care much what you may say or do!"</p> 
               <p>Ashley turned his inflamed eyes slowly upon her and sardonically said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, ho! we are very independent-very; but suppose I should say to you that I hold <emph>your</emph> fate as much under my control as that of Evelyn, what would you say then? And in addition to that, if I assure you that the lover who, it seems, has so long been kept in the background, may forever keep himself there, for all chance he has of winning you, what will you reply to that, my pretty piece of impudence?"</p> 
               <p>Bessie cast a reproachful glance toward Mrs. Ashley, and cried out in anguish:</p> 
               <p>"Oh! Minny-Minny, have you betrayed the confidence I reposed in you? Did you not pledge your word to me that it should be sacred till Ernest came? Oh, this is the most cruel blow of all!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley wiped away the tears that were rapidly falling from her eyes, and faintly said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, my darling, do not think hardly of me for doing what my duty to you forced on me. I pain you now, to save you from worse suffering in the future, Bessie."</p> 
               <p>Bessie shook her head incredulously, and Ashley, with<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6346-00000090"/> a laugh that seemed the very concentration of sneering triumph, unfolded the letter of Wentworth and said:</p> 
               <p>"Listen, ladies all, to the confessions of Mr. Francis Wentworth, addressed to his beloved cousin, Evelyn Ashley. It is no doubt a most romantic and charming expos of his sufferings, through the cruelty of the damsel's father, in not permitting her to ruin her sister's fortunes by running off with her affianced lover. <emph>Attention-attention,</emph> while I give voice to the complaints of the sentimental Strephon."</p> 
               <p>Regardless of his poor victim's tears and broken entreaties, Ashley went on to read aloud the contents of Frank's epistle, making bitter comments as he proceeded.</p> 
               <p>It revealed everything, and when he had completed his task, he folded the paper, carefully returned it to the envelope, and then turning toward the two girls, he fiercely asked:</p> 
               <p>"And now what have you two to say for yourselves to prevent immediate sentence from being pronounced on you? I hold in my hand the incontestible proof of the high crime and misdemeanor of which you have both been guilty, and I have already proclaimed myself as your judge."</p> 
               <p>Evelyn murmured some inaudible words; but Bessie retained sufficient self-control to speak calmly in reply. All the antagonistic elements in her nature were aroused, and she defiantly replied:</p> 
               <p>"We are not criminals, that you should assume such power over us. We exercised the inalienable right of every human creature, to seek happiness in our own way; at least the Declaration of Independence says as much, and, if we <emph>are</emph> women, we have as much interest in that as you possess."</p> 
               <p>"Eh? what's that? are you going to class yourself among the strong minded? It is high time that a curb should be put on you, Miss Ashley, if such are your views. Now listen to my words, and give them the weight to which, I assure you, they are entitled:</p> 
               <p>"I command Evelyn to be removed to the tower room, and kept there in strict confinement till Frank releases her by bestowing his hand on you. Her detention will not be very long, since the codicil to my father's will gives yourself and my nephew but six months in which to choose between affluence together, or poverty apart. In three more weeks the time will expire, and I appoint Thursday, the eighth of December, as the wedding day. In the interim, I shall bring such potent arguments to bear on Frank, that he will be bent to my will; as to yourself, Miss Bessie Ashley, I allow you no choice. You belong to me, and I have the right to control your destiny. I swear to you that you shall <emph>never</emph> become the wife of Ernest Delancey! Of all men living, he is the last one to whom I would willingly give you."</p> 
               <p>Bessie bowed her head in silence; she saw the intense passion that was, in a measure, repressed by the speaker; she feared its explosion in all its ruthless violence, more on Evelyn's account than her own; but bitter rebellion was in her heart, and she mentally resolved that no amount of persecution should crush her beneath his iron rule.</p> 
               <p>Finding that she would not speak, Ashley grimly asked:</p> 
               <p>"How is it that you have no reply ready for me-no defiance on your lips, Miss Ashley? Has your high spirit succumbed beneath the first attack?"</p> 
               <p>Her bright eyes flashed a single glance upon him, and she firmly said:</p> 
               <p>"You will find, sir, that both in Frank and myself you have toughter material to work on than you imagine. I shall not give him my hand at your command, nor will he perjure himself by faithlessness to the only woman he has ever loved."</p> 
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6346-00000091"/> 
               <p>Ashley furiously replied:</p> 
               <p>"Then, by Heaven! Evelyn shall never issue from her prison except to be sent back to Europe and immured for life in her convent. You may assure Frank that such will be her fate, should he prove unmanageable. As to <emph>your</emph> lover, I shall write him at once, and forbid him to approach you again. On the day I have named, I shall come to Ashurst accompanied by a clergyman, and if you refuse to ratify the contract to which you once bound yourself, I will forcibly hold you up on the floor, and compel you to obey me."</p> 
               <p>"You may abuse your power over me in so unjustifiable a manner," she tearfully replied-for her courage began to give way in a hysterical passion of emotion-"but, thank Heaven! you have no authority over Frank, and he will never lend himself to such cruelty as that."</p> 
               <p>"I shall find means to bring him to reason. Unless Frank marries you he is a beggar, and when he is once convinced that the girl he is silly enough to prefer to you is a prisoner at my mercy, he will bid me release her at any cost to you or to himself. Tell him that I will inflict mental torture on Evelyn every day-that I will seek every means of rendering her life odious to her-till he bends his proud neck to the yoke I mean to put on it. I shall find other means to reach <emph>you,</emph> but you will see that they will be quite as effectual."</p> 
               <p>Poor Evelyn shivered and sobbed at this brutal reference to herself, and Bessie's fire was exhausted in the contest. She felt faint and weak, and sinking on a chair, said:</p> 
               <p>"Let me get away from here. If I am to be victimized I must have time to prepare myself for the sacrifice, far away from him who can so cruelly use me. Take me home, Minny, and let me stay there till I have time to think and choose my own fate."</p> 
                
               <p>Mrs. Ashley drew near her, and would have passed her arm around her, but she slipped from her clasp, and stooping toward Evelyn, whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Keep up your courage, sister, for neither Frank nor I will ever give up to him."</p> 
               <p>Ashley thundered:</p> 
               <p>"How dare you speak to Evelyn, to encourage her to brave my authority as <emph>you</emph> have done? But you will find that, rebellious as you are, and unyielding as you may consider yourself, I will yet break your will, or break your heart."</p> 
               <p>"In doing the first, you would certainly accomplish the last," she replied, in tremulous tones.</p> 
               <p>And he laughed, as he said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, ho! so the little beauty has quenched her fire in tears. So much the better; after a good cry, women generally come to their right senses. Now I have finished with you, I will deal with the other, and far more guilty, culprit."</p> 
               <p>Throughout this scene Evelyn had sat, white and cold, feeling her utter inability to cope with the harsh and unfeeling man who possessed the entire control of her fate. Even Bessie, with all her spirit, seemed to have succumbed before his furious temper, and the little courage she possessed entirely deserted her.</p> 
               <p>Her head was drooping on her breast, her hands were clasped hopelessly before her; and he cried out:</p> 
               <p>"Hold up your head, and look me in the face, you disobedient and ungrateful creature! No wonder you are ashamed to do so, after the disgraceful conduct of which you have been guilty."</p> 
               <p>"Oh! papa, don't speak to me so-I cannot bear it," pleaded the poor girl, in a faint tone.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps you will find it easier to bear the punishment I shall award you, than to listen to the reproaches you so richly deserve. This is your sentence:</p> 
               <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6346-00000092"/> 
               <p>"You will be locked up in the tower room, and kept there, on the plainest food, till you have repented of your attempt to run counter to my wishes. I will never permit you to leave that place till you take a solemn oath to renounce all thoughts of ever marrying at all. The malady that is hereditary in your family renders this course imperative on me, for you may at any time be attacked with insanity. Your mother was mad years before she died, and the time will come when you will be thankful for my present action toward you."</p> 
               <p>Augusta ventured to say:</p> 
               <p>"The tower is already occupied by Jane, and it may be best to lock Evelyn up in her own room."</p> 
               <p>"To risk her being communicated with from without? No; the tower stands alone, and to that she shall go. If her nurse is there, it is another reason for sending her to her. The woman is helpless and imbecile, and it will not hurt my dainty young lady to give some attention to one who has given her so much. I shall hold <emph>you</emph> personally responsible for her safety, Madam, so you had better look after her carefully."</p> 
               <p>Augusta bowed, but ventured no further remonstrance; and he turned to Evelyn, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Get up from there, you crying simpleton, and go to your prison with your mother. If any attempt is made to escape from it, it will be the worse for you."</p> 
               <p>Evelyn arose, and threw herself on her knees before him.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! papa, have mercy on me. Pray do not shut me up in so narrow a place as the tower. I shall die there for want of exercise."</p> 
               <p>"You hear her?" he jeered, turning to Bessie. "Tell her adorer that she already shrinks from the ordeal she has brought on herself. After a few days of confinement, she will be quite ready to take any oath that will release her from prison, and free Frank from the silly pledges he may have given her. As soon as you recover from your anger, Bessie, come back to me, for I shall miss you sadly."</p> 
               <p>As she was leaving the room, she turned back, and, with all her natural fire, replied:</p> 
               <p>"I will never return to you as your daughter as long as you treat my sister in so shameful a manner. The slight tie that bound me to you is almost broken by your conduct to me to-day; and if I could be forced to become the wife of Frank, I would prove to you, that in giving me to him, you would forfeit all claim on me, even that of nature."</p> 
               <p>Before he could utter the angry reply that arose to his lips, the door closed on her retreating form, and in a few more moments the sound of the carriage wheels rolling away was heard.</p> 
               <p>Ashley sunk back, exhausted by the almost superhuman effort he had made to keep within decent bounds while Mrs. Ashley and Bessie were in hearing. But he soon revived, and arrested Evelyn's departure, that he might pour on her unresisting head the effervescing wrath which now boiled over.</p> 
               <p>Such a torrent of bitter abuse as fell from his tongue, no pen could do justice to, even if the attempt were made to record anything so base and unfeeling. Augusta, as usual, came in for her share of objurgation, though in the present instance she was entirely guiltless of deserving it, for she was as eager to prevent poor Evelyn from escaping from the thraldom of Ashley as he himself could have been.</p> 
               <p>Glad to escape even to the shelter of the tower occupied by Jane, Evelyn was at length permitted to leave him and take refuge by the side of her nurse.</p> 
               <p>The tower was an octagon building, separated from the house by a small enclosure planted with shrubbery. The<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6346-00000093"/> lower room had once been fitted up as a library, and a circular staircase ascended from it to the room in which Jane lay; in the days of Grace Arden's father, this had been used as an observatory; but after the strange marriage of the heiress, and her abandonment of her native land, the place had been suffered to fall to decay.</p> 
               <p>The books and astronomical instruments had been removed to the main building, and a miscellaneous collection of old lumber had usurped their place. When Jane was first attacked with the symptoms of her singular malady, she refused to be placed in one of the negro cabins, and the ruined tower was the only place Augusta was willing to appropriate to her use.</p> 
               <p>The lumber from the upper apartment was removed, and a small stove put up as the weather grew cold. Hagar, the personal attendant of Grace Arden, now a very old woman, was appointed to wait on her, and she was so nearly imbecile that she obeyed the orders of her new master without question or comment.</p> 
               <p>The drugs which Ashley had procured while in Marseilles soon paralyzed both body and mind, and the active and energetic woman lay from day to day in a state of semi-consciousness, incapable of reasoning, as she was of moving.</p> 
               <p>Evelyn had visited her every day, and ministered to her wants as far as she was able, but she had lost all hope of ever seeing Jane restored to soundness either of mind or body.</p> 
               <p>The thought that she must be shut up constantly with this woman slowly perishing before her, filled her with dread, for Evelyn's nervous system was easily shocked, and the dreary hopelessness of poor Jane's condition thrilled her with inexpressible horror.</p> 
               <p>Yet such was the doom awarded her by her own father, she thought, and for the first time a feeling of resentment mingled with her strong affection for him.</p> 
               <p>Augusta went with her to the door of the room, but she did not attempt to look into it. The nurse had long been an object of fear and aversion to her; and although she was not aware of the means by which she had been reduced to her present condition, she was glad that Jane was unable to stand up in defence of her helpless young lady.</p> 
               <p>As she parted from her charge, she said:</p> 
               <p>"I hope it will not be necessary to keep you here long, my dear. You must see how useless it is to hold out against your father. Since he makes <emph>me</emph> responsible for you, Evelyn, I trust that you will have consideration enough for me not to make any attempt to escape. You would be sure to be brought back, and then things would be worse for you than ever. Try and submit to what is inevitable."</p> 
               <p>With these coldly uttered words, Augusta resigned her to Hagar, with injunctions to be sure and keep her locked in whenever she left the room. Soon afterward Ashley himself sent for the old woman, and gave her his orders concerning her prisoner, and he so effectually frightened her, that Hagar resolved to use every precaution to prevent her captive's escape.</p> 
               <p>The tower contained a narrow bed, on which Jane was lying with her eyes half closed, and her hands clasped over her breast. Her breathing was labored, and her appearance was that of an aged woman. She evidently suffered, though there was no apparent consciousness of pain in the deathly calm of the face.</p> 
               <p>The entrance of her young lady did not arouse her, nor did the preparations made for Evelyn's stay cause her to observe what was passing around her. A couch was<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6346-00000094"/> brought in, and a trunk containing such articles of clothing as were absolutely necessary was sent up. She found her Bible in the trunk, but her portfolio and writing materials she was not permitted to have, lest she might use them in communicating with Frank.</p> 
               <p>What rendered this room peculiarly depressing was that it was lighted from above. The staircase had been removed which communicated with the cupola, and the outside world was entirely shut out from view, save a strip of sky overhead. To an impressible temperament like Evelyn's, no abode could have been selected which would so soon break down the small portion of courage which had been awarded her.</p> 
               <p>Loving, tender and gentle, she could not endure much, and this her tormentor knew, so he calculated with certainty on a speedy submission to his will.</p> 
               <p>The door was finally locked on the unhappy girl, and she sat down beside the bed of the only friend who could effectually have aided her in this crisis of her life, and tried to reconcile herself to the loss of the hope which of late had become so precious to her.</p> 
               <p>That her father would accomplish all he wished she did not for a moment doubt. She had been so accustomed to see everything yield before his despotic will, that she could not believe Bessie or Frank would ever have strength to brave his authority.</p> 
               <p>She had no hope left that the efforts of either could rescue her from the wretched slavery under which she writhed in helpless anguish.</p> 
               <p>Old Hagar replenished the fire, and then sat and watched her with a strange expression of face. She at length said:</p> 
               <p>"Ef you's de darter o' <emph>my</emph> young lady, what's de reason you aint got nothin' 'bout you dat b'longs to de Ardens? You aint one mite like 'em, an' I don' b'lieve dat a black-eyed gal like you can be any kin to 'em. I has had a strange dream 'bout you; three times suffin come to me when I was asleep, an' tole me dat you wasn't one o' de ole stock."</p> 
               <p>Evelyn's attention was gradually attracted by the maunderings of the old woman, and with a faint attempt to conciliate her, she said:</p> 
               <p>"Dreams go by contraries, they say, Hagar, and it must be so with yours. I am like my father, but there is no doubt that my mother was your young mistress."</p> 
               <p>"Who's dat calls me <emph>Hagar?</emph>" she indignantly asked. "Ef you was a Arden, you'd call de nuss o' yer ma, Mammy Hagar. Dat's what <emph>she</emph> called me; but my pore chile was tuck away to forrin parts, whar <emph>he</emph> broke her heart, an' I hearn tell, put her in de madhouse. Why couldn't he ha' brought her back, an' let her own people take care o' her? I wonder, now, ef she <emph>is</emph> dead, or ef dis flauntin' madam have tuck her place caze she can't speak up an' defen' her own rights? I has hearn tell o' sich things, an' your pappy's none too good to do anything. De blood o' Marse Erny is on his han'-I <emph>know</emph> it is-ef Miss Grace did 'fuse to b'lieve he killed him, an' chose to go off wi' him after de insult he put on her, a marryin' of her afore de fust woman was safe in her grave. Oh, chile, I'm 'feard o' dis man what says he's my master, for he don't care what he does, an' he'd kill me <emph>sho</emph> if he s'pected me o' doin' what he tole me not ter do."</p> 
               <p>Evelyn listened to the mumbling talk of the old woman with a chilled heart; the revelations she made were entirely new to her, for the past history of her father had been carefully concealed from her. She faintly asked:</p> 
               <p>"What do you mean about blood being on my father's hand, Mammy Hagar?"</p> 
               <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6346-00000095"/> 
               <p>"Ah-<emph>now</emph> you has manners-you calls me by de title dat b'longs to me by rights. I'll answer yer question, since yer axes so civilly. My young master fell out wi your pappy because he thought he hadn't treated Miss Grace right, an' dere was a juel by de pon', an Marse Erny was foun' drownded wi' a hole in his side. As sho's I'm born, I b'lieves dat Mr. Ashley <emph>let</emph> him drown to get rid on him, dat he might coax de sister to go 'long of him to furrin parts."</p> 
               <p>Evelyn shudderingly said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, don't-don't tell me such things of my father. It must be wrong for me to hear them, and it makes me even more wretched to know of the wrongs he has committed in other days. My mother <emph>is</emph> dead, and I will believe, as she must have believed, that he was innocent of her brother's blood."</p> 
               <p>The negro saw how much she was distressed, and with a puzzled look, said:</p> 
               <p>"I won' talk 'bout ole times no mo', ef it makes yer feel so bad, but arter what de master done to-day, I thought mebbe you'd as lief hear 'bout his doin's as not. Ef I wa'n't mortal 'feared on him, I'd let you out o' dis place, what aint fit for <emph>my</emph> young lady's darter to stay in. But I darsn't-it would be as much as my life would be wurf."</p> 
               <p>Evelyn attempted to turn her attention from the subject that seemed to engross it, by asking after the condition of Jane. The negress shook her head and replied:</p> 
               <p>"She goes on from bad to wuss. Mr. Ashley gave me some doctor's stuff dat he said would do her good, an' I gives it to her reg'lar; but she's past helpin', I'm 'feared."</p> 
               <p>"Will you let me see the medicine?" asked Evelyn. "I have been with papa so much in sickness, that I am a pretty good judge of what is good for a sick person."</p> 
               <p>Hagar went to a basket, and after a little, returned with a paper half filled with a grayish powder which was perfectly scentless. In reply to a question from the young lady, she said:</p> 
               <p>"I gives her every day as much o' that as I can take up on de pint o' a penknife dat Mr. Ashley give me to measure it wi'. She takes it easy 'nuff, but it don't seem to do her a mite o' good."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps we may increase the quantity," said Evelyn, "and if you will let me mix it for her, I will venture to do so."</p> 
               <p>"Well, ef you choose; you knows more 'bout it den I do, so you'd best keep de paper in your trunk."</p> 
               <p>At that moment a shrill summons for Hagar came from below, and hurriedly locking the door behind her, she descended, leaving Evelyn alone in the room with her nurse. She went to the bedside, carefully examined the condition of Jane, and then sat down apparently irresolute. After a long time she arose, muttering:</p> 
               <p>"I will throw it away. If she has taken this medicine regularly only to remain in this passive state, it can be of no benefit to her, and may be injurious. I will put up some ashes in the paper, and Hagar will never know the difference."</p> 
               <p>She threw the powder into the fire; it sparkled up an instant, and then the coals on which it fell seemed to die out more quickly than the others. Filling the paper with ashes of the same color, Evelyn sat down again with the determination that nature should at least have fair play in the case of her nurse.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly she remembered the homopathic remedies which Dr. Blomberg has given her father for the partial paralysis of his limbs when he first went to Baden. She had been called on to administer them, and she distinctly recollected what they were. By great good fortune, a<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6346-00000096"/> small case of the medicine, which she was allowed to keep by her, was in her trunk, and she at once proceeded to search for it, find the bottles containing what she needed, and try its power on her nurse.</p> 
               <p>Jane lay with her mouth half unclosed, and it was easy enough to place the tiny globules on her tongue, and Evelyn had the satisfaction of seeing that she swallowed them.</p> 
               <p>She then sat down to think over the wretched ending of her love dream, and to wonder if her life was to become a sacrifice to the tyranny of her cruel father.</p> 
               <p>Hagar, attended by a small boy, brought up her dinner, which was limited to potatoes, bread, and a glass of milk. Its scantiness did not annoy her, for she had no appetite, and she turned away almost with loathing from the food.</p> 
               <p>Such was not the case with Jane, however-she sat up, ate ravenously of the viands Hagar had brought for her, and for the first time noticed the presence of her young lady. She said to her in a husky voice:</p> 
               <p>"I am very glad to see you, Miss Evelyn, and if I could ever get my head clear enough to think, I have something to tell you that has been kept from you too long. But I can't remember what it is, and I am afraid that I shall die before it comes back to me."</p> 
               <p>"I hope not, Jane. I have come here to nurse you now, and I mean to make you quite well before long."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> have come to nurse me? Indeed I sha'n't stand that, for you're not strong enough to do any such thing. Neither is it your business."</p> 
               <p>"But suppose I choose to make it my business," she replied-"you would not refuse me then, I hope."</p> 
               <p>The faint flash of intelligence thus shown faded suddenly away, and Jane sank back muttering disconnectedly. Evelyn attributed this temporary revival to the medicine she had given her, and at the first opportunity she administered tered a second portion. It served to interest and occupy her, even if her nurse derived no benefit from it; but toward night even the old negress remarked that there was a change for the better in Jane's complexion and her breathing was less heavy.</p> 
               <p>Relying on Jane's utter imbecility, Ashley had placed Evelyn in the tower with her, because from that he believed it impossible for her to escape, and he thought there could be no danger from one in the woman's prostrate condition both of mind and body.</p> 
               <p>Had he dreamed of what was passing in the dreary den in which he had imprisoned Evelyn, he would at once have taken measures to have Jane removed far from her.</p> 
               <p>The short autumn day soon darkened over the narrow room, and Hagar came up bearing a tallow candle in one hand and the supper of her young lady in the other. This consisted of a cup of tea and a slice of buttered bread, both of which Evelyn was, by this time, glad to accept.</p> 
               <p>When Jane had finished her supper, Hagar retired, taking with her the light, which she informed Evelyn her master had forbidden her to leave. The door was locked, and she listened to the retiring steps of the old woman with a feeling of utter desolation-almost of despair.</p> 
               <p>The heavy breathing of Jane filled the room, and she thought, with terror, of the possibility that she might die there alone with her, and for long hours she might be left with no company save that of the dead woman.</p> 
               <p>The night was clear, and a bright moon had risen above the level of the surrounding trees. Its rays suddenly fell upon Jane's bed, and flickered over her face, and Evelyn comforted herself with the thought that it looked more natural, even by that cold white light, than it had done in the early part of the day.</p> 
               <p>She threw herself beside the bed, and with clasped<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6346-00000097"/> hands, and streaming eyes, looked up to the eternal Heavens, clad in all their regal beauty, and poured out her heart in prayer to Him whose ear is ever open to the cry of the desolate and oppressed.</p> 
               <p>Calmed and strengthened, she at length arose, prepared for her nightly rest, and exhausted by the many and varied emotions of the day, fell into the sweet sleep of innocence and faith.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">BESSIE UNMANAGEABLE.</head> 
               <p>WHEN Mrs. Ashley and her young companion were seated in the carriage, she would have drawn the head of Bessie to her bosom, and soothed her deep distress, as she had been accustomed to do in her childish days; but Bessie shrank away from her with a shudder, and said:</p> 
               <p>"No, no, Minny-don't touch me, if you please. If any one had told me that you could be guilty of the treachery by which you have this day broken more hearts than one, I would indignantly have repelled the possibility. But you accused yourself; you formed a league with that bad man it is my most bitter misfortune to claim for a father; you betrayed to him the confidence I have reposed in you, and you have ruined the happiness of my life as well as that of poor Evelyn."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley burst in tears, and wept so bitterly, that the heart which had so long loved and believed in her, was touched with remorse, and Bessie humbly said:</p> 
               <p>"Pardon me, Minny, if I have been unjust to you; but Mrs. Ashley explicitly said that something you had told papa had put him in a fearful rage."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley dried her eyes, and faltered:</p> 
               <p>"My dear, I only showed him a copy of the codicil to your grandfather's will, which gives the estate to charity i you and Frank are not united within six months after his decease. That excited him very much, and if I could have stopped there I would have done so. Yet I felt compelled to inform him of your engagement, and my suspicions that Frank and Evelyn are plotting to evade him. What less could I do, Bessie, when the interests of your whole life are at stake?"</p> 
               <p>"<emph>My interests!</emph> You harp forever on that string, Minny, and I am tired of it. My <emph>true</emph> interests are not bound up in a union with Frank, for we should soon learn to hate each other in a forced union, and I know that I should become that most odious of all things, a domestic tryant. It is in the blood, as we have had sufficient evidence to-day; and it may come out as strongly in a woman as in one of the opposite sex."</p> 
               <p>There was a degree of reckless hardness in her tones, which assured Mrs. Ashley that if she really hoped, either by persuasion or force, to bend the resolute spirit of this young creature to her will, she had a very difficult task before her.</p> 
               <p>She sunk back discouraged and said:</p> 
               <p>"You are too much excited just now to talk reasonably, Bessie. I will wait till you have had time to overcome your natural irritation at the position in which you find yourself placed."</p> 
               <p>"Do not fancy that my opposition to your cruel plans will subside with time, Minny. I declare to you, that the longer I reflect on the evil you have wrought to me, and those I love, the more I shall resent it. It was a cruel,<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6346-00000098"/> cruel act, to arouse my father's furious temper against one so defenceless, and so completely in his power, as Evelyn is."</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Ashley keenly felt the justice of this reproach and she had no reply to make to it. She buried her face in her veil, and wept silently throughout the remainder of the drive.</p> 
               <p>When they reached Ashurst Frank was not there. In the belief that the two ladies had gone over to spend the day at Arden Place, he had ridden over to the Oaks to consult with Rufus Welby, and make the preliminary arrangements for the proposed elopement.</p> 
               <p>Bessie went at once to her own room, and locked herself in. She turned a deaf ear to every application for admittance till toward nightfall, when she rang for Winny and ordered a cup of tea to be brought up to her.</p> 
               <p>When the woman came with it she asked:</p> 
               <p>"Has my cousin returned yet?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Miss Bessie, he aint come yet, but I 'specs he won't stay till it's quite dark. I hopes you aint sick nor nothin' dat you aint eat any dinner to-day."</p> 
               <p>"Only sick at heart, Winny, but I can't explain why. Watch for Frank, and when he comes in, give him this note. It has a message on it from Arden Place, which I do not feel like delivering in person."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my pretty," responded the attached Winny, who would have performed any errand given her by her young lady without a question as to its propriety.</p> 
               <p>In a few moments after she left the room, Bessie heard the tramp of Frank's horse as he rode around the house, and she felt certain that her missive would soon be in his possession. She had written to him:</p> 
               <q>
                  <p>"All is lost. Minny has turned against us, and informed my father of everything concerning E. D. You may imagine how furious he was.</p>
                  
                  <p>"He has locked Evelyn up in the tower with her sick nurse, and declares she shall remain there till you and I consent to make each other miserable. Meet me as you did last night as soon as the house is quiet, that we may consult on what is to be done."</p>
               </q> 
               <p>The sheet of note paper on which these lines were traced was delivered to Wentworth as he entered the hall door flushed with hope and expectation. In some surprise he asked:</p> 
               <p>"Who is this from, and where are the ladies?"</p> 
               <p>In a mysterious tone Winny replied:</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Dat's</emph> from Miss Bessie, Marse Frank, an' she's bin shut up in her room de blessed day sence she come over from de Place. Suffin's happen'd <emph>sho,</emph> but what it is dis darkey carnt tell to save her life."</p> 
               <p>The bright color faded perceptibly on the young lovers' cheek, and he abruptly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Where shall I find Mrs. Ashley?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, <emph>she's</emph> in her room too, an' she seems in a wuss way den Miss Bessie, for she aint done nothin' but walk up an' down de flo' dis whole day, a wringing o' her han's an' mutterin' to herself. I s'pects Marse Leon done suffin' dreffle dis mornin'."</p> 
               <p>Struck with sudden dismay, Frank hurried into the room in which he found the table set for himself alone, and by the light of the lamp he read the warning Bessie had sent him.</p> 
               <p>As he read all the fire faded out of his eager face, and he sunk down upon a chair utterly unnerved by this unexpected blow.</p> 
               <p>"Fate is against us," he muttered, "and Bessie and I may as well succumb at once, and end the wretched suspense in which we live by doing what they would have us do. My poor Evelyn-my precious darling, I must save you even at the sacrifice of myself."</p> 
               <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6346-00000099"/> 
               <p>He paced the floor in moody thought till supper was brought in. At first he thought it would be impossible for him to eat a morsel, but the scent of the broiled birds and fragrant tea caused him to come to the humiliating conclusion that, unhappy as he was, the exercise of the day had given him a keen appetite, the cravings of which must be satisfied before he could be fit to decide on what was to be done in this miserable crisis of his destiny.</p> 
               <p>So he devoured his supper in gloomy silence, and as soon as the table was cleared, dismissed the servant for the night. Again he read the words written by Bessie, and with an ireful glance toward the window in the recess of which Mrs. Ashley had been concealed on the previous night, he muttered:</p> 
               <p>"Minny <emph>was</emph> there last night, and I now wish that I had followed my impulse to draw back the curtain when I heard that noise. If I had unmasked her then, she would have been so completely in our power that she would not have dared to betray us to my uncle. Oh, Evelyn-my precious, sensitive plant, if I could only rescue you from the tyranny of your cruel father, I believe I could willingly sacrifice my own hopes-my own happiness."</p> 
               <p>Strong and hopeful man as he naturally was, Frank bowed his head upon his hands and wept such bitter tears as youth alone may shed; scalding, bitter drops that scathe the heart from which they are wrung!</p> 
               <p>The room became too close for him to breathe in, and starting up, he rushed out into the frosty air, leaving the hall door partly unclosed behind him. His rapid steps, as he paced to and fro on the narrow strip of pavement in front of the house, were heard by two eager watchers, and a few moments after they commenced, a dark figure, wrapped in a heavy black shawl, glided down the staircase, and entered the room he had left.</p> 
                
               <p>As the light fell on Mrs. Ashley's face, it revealed the effects of the bitter struggle through which she had that day passed. She was pallid as death, and her eyelids were swollen with weeping.</p> 
               <p>Too wary to choose the same place of concealment a second time, she turned toward a window on the opposite side of the room, in front of which an ottoman was placed. She crouched down behind this, and arranged the heavy curtain in so careless a manner that even if Wentworth happened to glance toward it, he would never imagine that any one was concealed behind its folds.</p> 
               <p>There she lay in a dark heap, resolved to await the return of Frank, and if Bessie again sought an interview with him, to hear all that was said on the present position of their affairs.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley had taken the precaution to dismiss her maid and lock her door, so there was little danger that her absence from her room would be detected.</p> 
               <p>An hour passed heavily enough to her. She heard Wentworth send away the servant whose business it was to lock up the house at nights, with the assurance that he would fasten the hall door himself, and soon afterward he and Bessie entered the room together.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley saw the change in both those young faces, and her heart wept tears of blood over the suffering she had been instrumental in inflicting upon them. Yet she never for one moment faltered in her resolution to drive them into the toils her skill had prepared for them.</p> 
               <p>Frank hoarsely asked:</p> 
               <p>"What is this, Bessie? Are our plans really betrayed to my uncle, and poor Evelyn still in his ruthless power? Oh! how can I bear the thought of what I have brought on her?</p> 
               <p>Bessie strove to keep back her tears as she pitifully said:</p> 
               <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6346-00000100"/> 
               <p>"Poor Frank-poor cousin, you are even more unhappy than I am, for the one you love is held in durance vile, and you are powerless to help her."</p> 
               <p>"But I <emph>will</emph> help her! I will rescue her at all hazards," he furiously cried. "I will brave my uncle and conquer him. I will get an order from a magistrate for Evelyn's release from that wretched den in which he has incarcerated her. How dare he treat her as if she were his slave?"</p> 
               <p>"Dear Frank, don't talk so wildly. You can do nothing against my father by violence, for the law gives him unlimited authority over Evelyn till she is of age. Come, sit down quietly, and let me tell you what happened this morning."</p> 
               <p>Frank submitted to sit down, and Bessie laid her hand on his to keep him in his place till she related the occurrences of the day. When she had finished, he said, in a tone of bitter conviction:</p> 
               <p>"Minny was in this room last night, Bessie, and to her we owe what we are now suffering. She must have overheard us, or she would never have taken the part she did against us."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Frank, don't insinuate such a thing as that against Minny. She is so anxious for us to secure material prosperity by the sacrifice of what should be far more precious to us, that she will do anything that is fair to insure it; but she would never be capable of such dishonor as that."</p> 
               <p>The listener winced at this generous defence, and Frank obstinately insisted:</p> 
               <p>"I believe she <emph>would.</emph> She has some reason that neither you nor I can fathom, for urging on our union, repulsive as she knows it is to both of us. What is it to her whether we choose poverty or affluence? It is <emph>we</emph> who have to bear the ills of the first-not she. What I have heard about this codicil fills my mind with vague suspicions which I do not like to entertain of her, above all women. Why was the knowledge of its existence so long withheld from us, who were so vitally interested in it? and why did she not inform us of the copy in her possession at the time she told us of the codicil? The conviction is forced on my mind that Mrs. Ashley is a schemer, and a most dangerous one, for I am afraid that she will stop at nothing to insure success to her own plans. With two such adversaries to deal with as your father and Minny, I begin almost to despair of evading the bond in which they are so anxious to join us."</p> 
               <p>Bessie's expressive face underwent many changes while Wentworth thus spoke, but she controlled her emotion, and replied:</p> 
               <p>"I will never believe Minny capable of committing an unprincipled action, Frank; and as to the combined power of which you speak, if you will be as true to yourself as I will prove to myself, it can never prevail. My mind is irrevocably made up never to give my hand to you, while my heart is devoted to another. I cannot marry Ernest till I am twenty-one, but I will hold myself free till then in spite of every persecution that may be brought to bear against me."</p> 
               <p>"And so would I," he gloomily responded, "if my own welfare only were at stake; but oh! Bessie, the helpless and sensitive being whose life, or reason, may be sacrificed in this cruel struggle, must be considered by me before myself. If I consent to sacrifice both you and myself to save <emph>her,</emph> you can hardly blame me."</p> 
               <p>She regarded his agitated face with compassion, and, after a pause, replied:</p> 
               <p>"I agree with you that something must be done for Evelyn as speedily as possible, for it will be death to her to be shut up in that gloomy tower with a dying woman<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6346-00000101"/> for her only companion. If all other means of softening my father fail, I give you leave to try submission. You may do so with impunity, for I declare to you that no power on earth shall ever force me to become your wife. If you can propitiate my father in any way, so as to gain freedom for Evelyn, do not hesitate to do so."</p> 
               <p>"Bessie I am a selfish and hard-hearted wretch to speak as I did just now. I must think of you, too, for you do not seem to think of yourself. I will reflect on all this to-night, and by morning, perhaps some plan of action may suggest itself, which will enable us to overcome the difficulties in our way."</p> 
               <p>"I trust so, Frank; but I am afraid it will be a hopeless undertaking. I must bid you good-night now, for I feel faint and ill with all I have gone through to-day."</p> 
               <p>She flitted from the room, and Wentworth almost immediately followed her; but before doing so, he tore aside the curtain from the recess in which Mrs. Ashley had lain perdu on the previous night, and savagely muttered:</p> 
               <p>"Not there to-night, Mrs. Ashley; but I am certain you <emph>were</emph> there last night. I also believe that you have some deep motive for pushing us to the verge of desperation, which is only known to yourself. God, who in his own good time brings all things to light, will yet unveil yours, Minny, and bring you to account for it, let it be what it may."</p> 
               <p>This idle menace, uttered in a moment of intense exasperation, struck home to the listener's heart and it was many moments before she could regain her scattered senses so far as to rise and leave her place of concealment.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley had gained but two things by her long watch. Frank already considered the case as hopeless, and seemed ready to purchase forgiveness for Evelyn by consenting to anything Mr. Ashley might dictate; but Bessie, with her uncurbed spirit and fiery independence, was still unmanageable, nor could she find any further reasons to urge on her to convince her of the necessity of obedience to her father's will.</p> 
               <p>Sick at heart, she retired to her room, and remained many hours wrapped in deep and bitter thought before she sought her sleepless pillow. Her final resolution was to use all her art during the next week to bring the rebellious girl over. If she utterly failed, as a last and most terrible resource, she must throw herself upon the mercy of her daughter, avow the relationship in which they stood to each other, and ask, as the price of her own safety, that Bessie should bestow her hand on the heir of Judge Ashley, and thus legitimate her claim to the position she held in his family.</p> 
               <p>The unhappy woman trembled in the presence of this necessity, and blanched with dread at the thought of the bitter humiliation she must undergo in the presence of her daughter; yet, as the days passed on, it seemed that no other alternative would be left her.</p> 
               <p>To her passionate appeals-her most forcible reasonings-Bessie was apparently as unmoved as if made of marble. To her tender entreaties she turned a deaf ear, and when patience was exhausted, she would only say:</p> 
               <p>"I could not once have believed that you would ask me to do so shameful a thing as this, Minny."</p> 
               <p>Further she would not speak, and in despair Mrs. Ashley was ready to give up the contest.</p> 
               <p>During this time, Frank held many interviews with his uncle, and the threats uttered by Mr. Ashley against Evelyn, the close imprisonment in which she was held, together with the fear which had seized on his imagination that her father meant to drive her mad, all acted on him, and he formally consented to accept the hand of Bessie, provided<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6346-00000102"/> Evelyn should be released, and nothing more said to her on the subject of the elopement they had planned.</p> 
               <p>After the assurance with which Bessie closed her last interview with himself, Wentworth knew that there was little danger that he should be called on to ratify, at the altar, the consent thus wrung from him. So, in compliance with Bessie's repeated commands, he left the onus of final refusal to fall on her, fully assured that she would never yield, and confident that the independent position she held with reference to Mr. Ashley, would give her an advantage which Evelyn did not possess.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Ashley required from his nephew a written agreement to this effect, and he sent it over to Ashurst to be exhibited to the contumacious girl, in hope that it would prove to her how small a chance remained to her to maintain a successful opposition to his wishes.</p> 
               <p>Bessie read it, smiled bitterly, and said, in reply to Mrs. Ashley's renewed importunities:</p> 
               <p>"I insisted that Frank should make such terms as would deliver Evelyn from the persecutions of my father. He has obeyed me, and in so doing, gained all that we hoped for; but <emph>his</emph> consent to obey my father, only strengthens and confirms my own opposition. Had Frank believed that I could be induced to waver, he would never have yielded himself."</p> 
               <p>"He is ungenerous to place you in so painful a position," replied Mrs. Ashley, with emotion. "Oh, Bessie! will <emph>nothing</emph> move you to save yourself, and-"</p> 
               <p>The words died away on her white lips, and Bessie regarded her with compassionate surprise as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"To save my sister, Frank had no other course left. I bade him take it myself. I have already said all that I could to convince you that I will not be crushed into submission, Minny, and I now most solemnly declare that no power on earth shall force me to give the hand that is pledged to another to Frank Wentworth. This is <emph>my</emph> ultimatum. Mr. Ashley may, as he threatened, force me upon the floor, but he cannot compel me to take false vows on my lips. I am in dire earnest about this, Minny, though it seems difficult to convince you that a girl like me can set herself so firmly in opposition to the wishes of her friends. If I had been reared in habits of submission to my father, it might have been different, and I might have bent before his will, as poor Evelyn does; but he has so slight a claim on me that I scarcely feel as if it invests him with paternal authority over me."</p> 
               <p>"Instinct-instinct," murmured Mrs. Ashley in a wild manner, as she passed to and fro in front of her daughter, wringing her hands and weeping violently.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE MOTHER'S CONFESSION, AND ITS EFFECT.</head> 
               <p>BESSIE sat in a large arm-chair on one side of the fire, and she gazed with dilated eyes and changing complexion on the overwhelming distress of Mrs. Ashley.</p> 
               <p>She had retired to her room for the night when her mother came up on this mission. Mrs. Ashley had gradually been working up her courage to the point she intuitively felt it must reach if she eventually succeeded with her daughter, and she now paced the floor in such perturbation that Bessie felt the deepest alarm.</p> 
               <p>The young girl deprecatingly said:</p> 
               <p>"Dear Minny, I am sorry to make you so miserable, but indeed, indeed I feel that it is <emph>impossible</emph> for me to marry<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6346-00000103"/> Frank, and I feel that you are unkind and unreasonable in pressing so unwelcome a fate upon me."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Unreasonable!</emph>" repeated her mother, in a hollow tone, as she paused suddenly in front of her-"unreasonable, when I ask of my own child my very life?" and she sunk an abject petitioner at the feet of the appalled girl.</p> 
               <p>Bessie shrank away from her, believing that she had suddenly lost her reason, but with passionate vehemence Mrs. Ashley went on with the confession she had commenced:</p> 
               <p>"Bessie, you are my own-own daughter. Flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone, and you live in my heart to the exclusion of every other image. You are the child of my lover husband, Frank Wilde, and I cling to you with such passionate affection, as all that remained to me of <emph>him,</emph> that I could not-could not give you up."</p> 
               <p>She paused, too much excited to go on, and Bessie sat still, mute, white as marble, and nearly as cold. If her life had depended on it she could not have uttered a word, but the silent eloquence of her startled gaze spoke volumes to the wretched mother.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Bessie, do not look at me with that reproachful expression-it kills me to see contempt and shrinking in your eyes. I swear to you that if Judge Ashley would have permitted both children to come hither, I would never have been tempted to commit this sin; but the only terms on which I could be received was the relinquishment of my own babe. A rich woman coveted my child, and to <emph>her</emph> I gave the strange infant as my own. Bessie, I would never have done such a thing, had I not been almost on the verge of starvation before I was employed as Evelyn Ashley's nurse. I had no home in which to shelter myself, or I could never have committed such an act of wickedness. Its punishment has come home to me this night, in the bitter humiliation of this confession to my own daughter Oh, Bessie, pity and forgive the crime that was committed on your account; I might have borne poverty for myself, but when I looked forward to it for <emph>you</emph> I shrank from the thought that you must endure what I had gone through, and feel the pitiless storm beating on your head even in infancy."</p> 
               <p>She bowed her head and concealed her agitated face in the folds of Bessie's dress, who sat rigid and upright, listening with a vague doubt in her mind as to the reality of the scene passing before her. She <emph>could not</emph> believe the accusation Mrs. Ashley thus brought against herself, and she passed her hand over her eyes and sunk helplessly back as she said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Minny, don't take away my faith in you. It cannot be-cannot be as you say."</p> 
               <p>"Would to God it were not," groaned the unhappy woman, "but it is the truth, Bessie-the fearful truth, which has been wrung from me by your resistance to my wishes. Unless you become the wife of Frank Wentworth, you have no claim here. I took him from his dying mother that he might, at a proper time, be united to you. I used my influence with the Judge to induce him to receive him here, and make him joint heir to the estate. I caused the will to be made which binds you to accept each other, for in your union with Frank alone could I find safety for myself, or atone for the wrong I had committed. By his baseness Leon Ashley had forfeited the claim to his portion of the inheritance, and I did not believe I did so very wrong when I gave his child to a woman who had wealth at her command, and who pledged her word that the little girl should be handsomely provided for."</p> 
               <p>By this time Bessie had quite recovered the use of her faculties. She saw clearly that the truth, bitter as it was, had been told her; and much as she condemned the unhappy<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6346-00000104"/> happy woman before her, she pitied her more; and all the clinging affection she had so long cherished for her, came to excuse and palliate the crime of which she had been guilty.</p> 
               <p>She leaned forward, lifted her mother from her grovelling position, and with deep emotion said:</p> 
               <p>"Since it was your love for <emph>me</emph> that placed you in this painful position, I have no right to sit up in judgment upon you, Minny. Do not kneel to me, I entreat you. Calm yourself, and give me all the details of this sad, sad story, for I must thoroughly understand my own position before I can reply to you.</p> 
               <p>"Bessie, there can be but one answer to the prayer which entreats you to spare me the possibility of public disgrace; to legalize what I have done by taking Frank at his word, and becoming his wife. Only to obtain that end would I have so humiliated myself before you."</p> 
               <p>Bessie placed her mother on a chair, for she saw that she was in too great a tremor of emotion to stand in the position she had assumed before her. She then gently said:</p> 
               <p>"We will discuss that afterward, if you please, Minny. Now tell me of your early life-of my <emph>own</emph> father. Even in such a moment as this, I almost feel a sensation of gladness that I am not the daughter of so fearful a man as Mr. Ashley. Some instinct that was incomprehensible to me, caused me to shrink from him from the first; but now I understand it. Oh, Minny, tell me again that you are <emph>really</emph> my mother!"</p> 
               <p>The burst of hysterical emotion that followed the doubt thus expressed, alarmed Mrs. Ashley, and she soothingly said:</p> 
               <p>"There, my darling, calm yourself, and I will give you all the particulars of my sad history. I will conceal nothing ing from you, Bessie; and you will see how bitterly I have been punished for my aberration from the right path."</p> 
               <p>Bessie leaned back in her chair, pale and tremulous, but she was seemingly calm enough to listen to the promised revelation. Mrs. Ashley seemed to be collecting her thoughts, and recalling the long-buried past, but she at length began in a voice she forced to be steady.</p> 
               <p>"My father was a seafaring man, and when he was on shore, his home was in a small village on the coast of Massachusetts. Like most New Englanders, he was well educated. I was his only child, and my mother died when I was in my tenth year.</p> 
               <p>"Previous to that event, two youths, the sons of brother sailors who had perished at sea, had been adopted by my father as his sons, and they were both taught to love the occupation in which he delighted himself. We had an old housekeeper who attended to our wants, and we all received such instruction as the village school afforded.</p> 
               <p>"At an early age the boys chose the calling of their fathers, and left me to prosecute my studies alone. Both of them were at that time on my father's ship, for he owned the half of a merchantman of which he was captain.</p> 
               <p>"All his savings had been invested in this vessel, and he assured me that she was well insured in New York, should any accident happen to her. But when she was lost, the insurance was never paid to me.</p> 
               <p>"But I am going too fast. At the close of every voyage the two adopted sons came home with him, and as time past on, Frank Wilde and myself became ardently attached to each other. No opposition was made to our union, and when I was eighteen, it was settled that we were to be united when he returned from his next voyage.</p> 
               <p>"When John Martin heard this he abruptly left our cottage, and the next news we heard from him was, that<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6346-00000105"/> he had by some means obtained the position of midshipman in the United States Navy, and had sailed away on a long cruise.</p> 
               <p>"I had not before suspected that he cared for me except as a sister, but I then knew that he did. Well, Frank and I were married, and six weeks of as perfect happiness as human beings can ever enjoy flitted over our heads. I cannot dwell on that time, for it was the one glimpse of heaven I have had in my pilgrimage through life.</p> 
               <p>"We parted, never again to meet on this earth. The ship sailed away with my father and my husband on board, and never came to land again."</p> 
               <p>Her voice sunk away into a husky whisper, and after several moments of silence, she excitedly went on:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Bessie, spare me the details of those miserable days. I do not know how I existed through them, and it was long before I could be made to believe that all had perished in that fatal wreck. I passed months in a species of monotonous despair that was almost insanity. Until you were born I scarcely noticed anything; and how I clung to you-how passionately I loved you-no other mother can ever know; for no other mother was ever so desolate-so utterly bereaved as I was before you were given to me.</p> 
               <p>"When I recovered sufficiently to look into my affairs, I found that I was nearly penniless. Such slender resources as my father left me were exhausted during those months of darkness and suffering, and owing to some informality in the insurance, I could not recover the money that was due me.</p> 
               <p>"I sold the furniture in the cottage, relinquished the lease I held on it, and after paying every debt I owed, took the small sum that remained, and travelled to New York in the faint hope that by making a personal application tion I might recover a small portion of the sum the insurance company owed me.</p> 
               <p>"My last dollar was expended in fruitless efforts to regain what I believed was justly mine, and when my money was exhausted, I took refuge at Hoboken with a laboring man who had once sailed a voyage on my father's ship. Hinton's wife was a very hard woman, and to reconcile her to my stay beneath his roof, he told her that I was his niece. I cannot tell you how wretched my life was there. I sewed for that woman-helped her with such house-work as I was able to do; but nothing could satisfy her, and I was daily made to feel that my presence was only tolerated in her house.</p> 
               <p>"In this dependent condition, burdened with a young child, which prevented me from obtaining employment, with no hope for the future, I sat one day utterly despondent. 'In the darkest hour the clouds break,' says the adage, and it was illustrated in my case. One of the neighbors with whom I had a passing acquaintance, came in and asked for me. She proposed to me to take charge of a young infant whose mother had died in her house a few days before.</p> 
               <p>"I accepted the situation as eagerly as a drowning man grasps at a straw, and I went home with Mrs. Sims to see the gentleman who had sent her for me. The terms were soon settled, for Mr. Hunter was most liberal, and he seemed touched with my forlorn condition."</p> 
               <p>There was another pause, and Bessie faintly said:</p> 
               <p>"Go on, Minny-pray go on."</p> 
               <p>"I am coming to the temptation, Bessie. I meant to act fairly-I swear to you that I did;-and I never thought of really changing the children till Judge Ashley refused to permit me to bring my own infant thither. When the alternative was offered me of separating from my own<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6346-00000106"/> baby, or giving up the only prospect of winning my bread that was open to me, I yielded to the double temptation of securing a support for myself, and future position and wealth for you. I brought you hither, and you have been reared as the heiress of half this estate. Do not, I entreat you, give up what I have sacrificed so much to attain."</p> 
               <p>Again she paused, and Bessie briefly asked:</p> 
               <p>"And the other child-what of her fate?"</p> 
               <p>"I gave her to a very wealthy woman, who had heard of my destitute situation while I remained in New York, and she sent to me to induce me to give up my infant to her. I gave her Judge Ashley's granddaughter; but I would never have parted from her except to those who could rear her in as good a position as the one to which she was born."</p> 
               <p>"What was the name of those people?" persisted Bessie.</p> 
               <p>Unconscious that she had any object in inquiring, Mrs. Ashley went on:</p> 
               <p>"I gave her to Mrs. George Allen, a lady who at that time lived on Fifth Avenue in a magnificent house. I think it probable that she still lives in the same place, and she pledged her word to me that Evelyn Ashley should be reared as her own daughter. She will eventually become the heiress to as great wealth as she was born to."</p> 
               <p>After a few moments of painful thought, Bessie said:</p> 
               <p>"And I have no right here-never have had any. I have usurped the place of another, and until you married my grandfather, we had no claim even to the shelter of his roof. Oh, Minny, this is bitter! bitter!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley again threw herself before her, and whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Pity me and pardon me, Bessie. Oh, if I had loved <emph>you</emph> less, I had never committed this crime."</p> 
               <p>Bessie tearfully replied:</p> 
                
               <p>"I <emph>do</emph> pity you, mother, and I have no right to withhold my pardon from you. But why do you persist in asking me to consummate this wrong against another? I have no right to the money which was bequeathed to Judge Ashley's <emph>granddaughter,</emph> nor will I secure it by the sacrifice of my happiness. You have enough; we can go far away; Italy is my land of promise, and you can live there with Ernest and myself. Let us fly from this place, Minny, leaving behind us such proofs as must convince Mr. Ashley that he has no authority over me. He will keep your secret for the sake of the name you bear."</p> 
               <p>Bessie attempted to take her mother's hand, but she shrank away, and in a tone of anguish said:</p> 
               <p>"I have not yet shown you the most terrible phase of my wrecked life, Bessie, but I must do so to convince you of the impossibility of acting as you wish. Do you suppose that if I could have held that wealth without question, I would so persistently have urged the union with Frank upon you? No; it is the dread that poverty may overtake us both that makes me so anxious to give him your hand."</p> 
               <p>Bessie cast a frightened glance at her, and faltered:</p> 
               <p>"Speak on-let me hear the worst you have to unfold."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley endeavored to steady her voice, but it was so low and tremulous that her daughter was compelled to bend her head toward her to comprehend the meaning of the words she rapidly uttered:</p> 
               <p>"The saddest part of my story is yet untold. I came hither; for months I lived in solitude, for the Judge held himself entirely aloof from the nurse of his supposed grandchild, nor did he ask to see the infant.</p> 
               <p>"At length, wearied with the monotony of my life, yearning for some cultivated being to speak to occasionally,<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6346-00000107"/> I thrust myself on the notice of Judge Ashley, intending to show him that I was superior to the position I occupied in his family. I gained what I sought-occasional companionship with one who could understand and appreciate me at my just value.</p> 
               <p>"I at first had no wish to attract him, for my heart was still with the husband of my choice, but he conceived for me one of those infatuated passions which often lead old men to commit the most inconceivable follies, and in spite of the pride which was his ruling passion, he asked me to become his wife.</p> 
               <p>"My heart was dead to love, but my ambition and taste for luxury would be gratified in such a marriage, and I also had the highest respect for my ancient wooer. I believed that I could make him happy in return for the benefits he could confer on me and on the darling of my heart, and I consented to give him my hand.</p> 
               <p>"A few weeks before our marriage, a northern paper accidentally fell into my hands, in which I read a paragraph which stated that two of the sailors from the wreck of the Albatross, the name of my father's ship, had been picked up by an outward bound English vessel, and taken to China.</p> 
               <p>"The tortures I endured from that hour were inexpressible. I was on the point of confessing all, and leaving Ashurst forever, taking you with me, but I had no home to go to, no resources of my own, and I tried to convince myself that the report was false, and even if true, Frank could scarcely be one of the men saved, as they were spoken of as common sailors, and he held the position of first mate.</p> 
               <p>"I tried to convince myself that poor Frank could not have been rescued-that he, with my father, had gone down with his ship. As if to aid this delusion, another paper came with fuller details. In that it was stated that one of the men died soon after being taken on board the Indiaman, and the other lay in a hopeless condition.</p> 
               <p>"During this time of doubt and wretchedness, my capricious conduct toward Judge Ashley seemed to alienate him, and I began to tremble for the stability of my foothold in this house. In a fit of sudden desperation I married him, and fainted in his arms when the ceremony ended.</p> 
               <p>"Wishing to secure your position in the future, I induced Judge Ashley to forgive the daughter whose marriage had offended him, and we went together to Baltimore to see her die and bring her son hither.</p> 
               <p>"While at the hotel in that city I overheard the voice of John Martin speaking in the corridor on which my room opened; he had obtained a glimpse of me, and he contended with his companion that he knew me. I listened eagerly, for I feared to be recognized by him, and-Oh, Bessie, the words he uttered went to my heart like a barbed arrow, for they assured me that my Frank-my adored husband-was still living!"</p> 
               <p>Bessie started forward with dilating eyes and white lips, exclaiming:</p> 
               <p>"My father living when you-you had given yourself to another! Oh, Minny! did you dare stay with-"</p> 
               <p>Her voice died away in a husky whisper, and in a broken voice Mrs. Ashley went on:</p> 
               <p>"What could I do, Bessie? I had innocently become the wife of the trusting old man whose life would be made desolate if I left him. Before I married him I had convinced myself that Frank had perished, and I argued that I had no right to make him feel the burden of my wrong doing.</p> 
               <p>"Besides-Frank might refuse to receive me again; might tear his child from me and leave me to disgrace and wretchedness. Self-preservation is the first law of nature<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6346-00000108"/> and although I was inexpressibly miserable for many, many months afterward, I still clung to him who had generously lifted me from poverty and abasement to share his life and fortune."</p> 
               <p>She paused, and Bessie faltered:</p> 
               <p>"And my father, Minny? Did he never learn what you had done? Is he yet living to bless his child?"</p> 
               <p>"He is dead, Bessie; has been dead many years. He wrote to me once, and when we get through with this painful revelation, I will give you his last letter to me. It was written from his dying bed, and will prove to you what a noble and true man your father was. Alas! far too good for me!</p> 
               <p>"I came back to Ashurst, but I was so wretched that my health failed me; I dreaded that Frank would follow me to my seclusion; reproach me with the wrong I had done him, and leave me to the contempt of every one who heard my painful story. But I sadly misjudged his generous nature. The woman he had loved he would not trample in the dust; he left her to the retribution of her own acts.</p> 
               <p>"As time rolled on, and I heard nothing from Frank, my tranquillity returned. When John Martin came back from the cruise which had taken him from his native land before he could follow up the clue he had gained, he came hither to seek me. I met him in the woodland, and prevented him from coming to the house to betray me; after that meeting I had no fears on Frank's account, though I suffered from the terrible necessity that held me bound to Judge Ashley, while the man I had so tenderly loved lived, perhaps, to scorn and despise me.</p> 
               <p>"Time dulled my regrets, and I can truly say that I failed in none of the duties I had undertaken toward him to whom I had so recklessly given myself. When you were six years old a letter came to me which I have carried in my pocket for the last two days, in the belief that a crisis would arise in which I should be compelled to exhibit it to you. Here it is-and now you know why my dower in this estate, the money willed to me by Judge Ashley as his widow, may be taken from me; and I conjure you to save me from all chance of such disgrace by giving your hand to Frank Wentworth."</p> 
               <p>Bessie made no other reply than to hold out her hand for the letter. The mother placed in it a yellow, timeworn envelope, addressed to Mrs. Margaret Wilde Ashley. With eager, trembling hands she unclosed it, and read the following lines.</p>

                           <p>"MARGARET:-I have lived in a foreign land since I learned that an impassable barrier had arisen between the two who were once all in all to each other, but I have come home to die: home do I call it, when I am still among strangers, though they are very kind to me.</p> 
                           <p>"When I returned from the East as one risen from the dead, how bitter was my anguish when John Martin assured me that you had not waited to be <emph>certain</emph> of my death before giving yourself to an another, words would fail to express.</p> 
                           <p>"The good ship went down in a tornado, carrying to destruction every soul on board, save one seaman and myself. We were lashed to the same spar, and floated at the mercy of the waves for many days before we were picked up by an outward bound Indiaman.</p> 
                           <p>"We were in a state of utter exhaustion, and every effort to save my companion proved fruitless. I struggled back to life, was landed at Cape Town, from which place I worked my way back to my own country, after tedious and heart-breaking delays, but to learn there that no traces of my wife, and the child I was told had been born to me, existed.</p> 
                           <p>"I spent a weary time in endeavoring to discover what had become of you, but met with no success. In New<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6346-00000109"/> York I encountered John Martin, and he gave me the crushing information that you had married a rich Southern man, to whose granddaughter you had been governess; that my own child was no more, and your strongest wish was to be left to the enjoyment of the position you had secured for yourself."</p>

               <p>Bessie here looked up, and asked, with emotion:</p> 
               <p>"Did you willingly give him that grief, Minny?"</p> 
               <p>"No-as Heaven is my judge, I did not; but I feared he might claim you, and I told John Martin that my child was dead. In such falsehood lay my only chance of safety."</p> 
               <p>The young girl sighed heavily, and resumed the letter:</p>

                           <p>"I complied with your wishes, Margaret, for what benefit could accrue to me from claiming a woman who preferred the enjoyment of wealth with the aged protector she had chosen; to love and hardship with me? or how could I have made myself happier by exposing to the world the fact that you were the wife of two living men?</p> 
                           <p>"I left you to such peace as you could find, with this bitter wrong to both him and me resting on your conscience; and my non-appearance has, ere this, legalized the union you have formed, innocently, I am willing to believe.</p> 
                           <p>"I am dying; my physician says that in forty-eight hours my earthly course will be run, and the last effort I make is to write to you forgiveness for the past, and release you from all fears from me in the future. Even if I had survived Judge Ashley, I should never again have claimed her who gave herself away for wealth within a year of her supposed widowhood.</p> 
                           <p>"If my child had lived I should have claimed her at your hands; but her death severed the last tie between us, and it was better so. I have saved nothing, for I had no object in doing so; and all I possess will barely suffice to pay the expenses of my illness, and bury me respectably.</p>

               <p>Bessie closed the letter in deep emotion. She saw that on the envelope was written-</p> 
                
               <p>"The writer of this died three days ago, and was decently interred."</p> 
               <p>She faintly asked.</p> 
               <p>"And this was all, Minny?"</p> 
               <p>"All; nothing came to me-no memorial that I could now transfer to you. The record was closed, and I bitterly felt what a wretch I had been; but it was too late to grieve or repent. I thrust the memory of the past sedulously from me, and looked to <emph>your</emph> future prosperity as the compensation for all I had suffered-for the wrongs I had been guilty of toward others under such temptations as rarely assail one human being. Speak, my darling; tell me that <emph>you</emph> have forgiven me; that you will not permit this humiliating confession to be made in vain. You will accept the heir of Ashurst, and retain the position I won for you so long ago."</p> 
               <p>With a wailing tremor in her voice, Bessie replied:</p> 
               <p>"I do forgive you, Minny; but you have thrown a blight over my heart by this painful revelation. Pure-hearted, noble, and self-sustained I believed you to be, and you have yourself destroyed my ideal. But you are my mother still; you have been a most tender one to me throughout my life, and I must continue to love you as a gentle, long-suffering, though guilty woman, who has on me the high claim of maternity. Give me time to reflect on all that has passed between us to-night, before you press for a decision on this momentous question. I am weary, my head aches, and my heart feels as if a cord were tightening around it, and I must seek such repose as I can find to-night."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley took her hand in both her own, looked searchingly in her face, and whispered:</p> 
               <p>"You cannot crush me-you will not ruin me, Bessie? Oh! do not break my heart by refusing my prayer! I<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6346-00000110"/> have staked everything upon a single throw, and I entreat that you will be merciful-be merciful! Think over all I have suffered-on the heavy burden I have so long borne-and do not be the first to cast a stone at the wailing sinner"</p> 
               <p>Bessie raised the hands that held her own to her lips, and replied:</p> 
               <p>"I will do my best, mother. I will try to be just-yes, just to all concerned."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley turned away with a heavy sigh, and faintly bidding her daughter good-night, left the room.</p> 
               <p>The door had no sooner closed on her than Bessie sprang to it, shot the bolt, and then, with a bitter, wailing cry, sunk upon her knees beside her chair.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! God help me and direct me what to do, for my brain is wild-my heart crushed by the wretched, wretched story I have this night heard. An impostor!-filling the place of one who may at this hour be a wanderer on the face of the earth, how can I ever lift my head in the light of day again?</p> 
               <p>"No, no, Minny, even to save you, I can never be so base as to retain a position to which I have no right. I must learn what has become of that poor child before I can rest. Even if I loved Frank, I could not marry him <emph>now;</emph> but thank Heaven I was saved from that wretchedness. I am free to go, and go I will on this sacred mission."</p> 
               <p>After praying fervently for help and guidance in the enterprise she was about to undertake, Bessie arose, and arrayed herself in a dark travelling dress. She took from her dressing-stand a porte-monnaie tolerably well filled, and then proceeded to put in a carpet bag such articles as would be indispensable on a journey.</p> 
               <p>She laid out her furs and bonnet ready to put on when day began to dawn. After writing several letters, she threw herself back in a large cushioned chair, and snatched such fitful slumbers as would come to her weary heart and tortured mind.</p> 
               <p>She started from these every few moments with the painful consciousness that something dreadful had happened, and with the first dawn of light she put on her wrappings, took up her trifling luggage, and cautiously made her way down stairs, and went out from the home which had sheltered her from her infancy.</p>

               <head type="sub">EVELYN'S NURSE MAKES A REVELATION.</head> 
               <p>FOR a week Mrs. Ashley had scarcely slept; but on this night a heavy, dreamless slumber, the offspring of utter exhaustion both of mind and body, fell upon her, and lasted till a late hour on the following morning.</p> 
               <p>The heaviest portion of the load she had so long borne was lifted; the dire confession was made; and her daughter had not shrunk away from her with reproaches, as she feared she might. She trusted to the strong affection which bound Bessie to her to shield her from the contumely her crime merited, and she thrust aside the bitter repugnance of her daughter to the union which, she believed, could alone save her from falling over the precipice on which she stood.</p> 
               <p>Like the criminal who sleeps soundly on the eve of execution, the guilty woman lay motionless and dreamless during those important hours in which the decision of her fate was made by her child.</p> 
               <p>When she awoke, the sun was high in the heavens, and when Winny appeared in answer to her bell, she eagerly inquired:</p> 
               <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6346-00000111"/> 
               <p>"Has Miss Bessie gone down stairs yet, Winny? I must have sadly overslept myself."</p> 
               <p>"I should think you <emph>has,</emph>" replied the woman, with emphasis, "for it's ten o'clock by de big hall clock. But Miss Bessie ain't bin down stairs nuther, dis blessed mornin.' When breakfas' was ready for Marse Frank, I knocked at her do' an' tole her he wanted to see her. I s'pose she wer sleepin' as soun' as a <emph>doormouse,</emph> for she never answered me at all."</p> 
               <p>"Did you go into her chamber?" asked Mrs. Ashley, nervously. "It is very unusual for Bessie to lie in bed so late. Perhaps she may be ill."</p> 
               <p>"I didn't go in. I jest peeped in, an' saw dat de curtains was drawed roun' de bed, an' as I s'posed she was sleepin' nicely, I let her alone. Dere was a good fire on de harf, an' I saw she didn't want for nottin'."</p> 
               <p>"You did quite right, and I am glad you did not interrupt her slumbers. The poor child has not seemed in good spirits of late, and I am afraid she slept badly. Mr. Frank has had his breakfast, then?"</p> 
               <p>"O, yes'm-hours ago. I heard him say dat he was off to de Oaks to meet some o' de weddin' party as was a comin' to-day. In fac', he tole me to tell Miss Bessie whar he was gone to."</p> 
               <p>"This will make a new complication," reflected Mrs. Ashley. "Delancey may be the person Frank was anxious to meet, and in spite of Mr. Ashley's prohibition, he may come here to-day to see Bessie. I know he was written to and forbidden to make his appearance at this house, but no answer was vouchsafed, and the young man will doubtless carry out his own intentions regardless of the letter. Oh, Bessie-Bessie! why did I ever permit you to make that fatal northern tour!"</p> 
               <p>While these thoughts flitted through Mrs. Ashley's mind, she hurriedly made her morning toilette, and went herself to the chamber of her daughter, to claim from her a greeting in her new character.</p> 
               <p>The lock yielded to her touch. A bright fire was burning behind the high fender, but there was an air of disorder in the appearance of the room which at once struck the visitor. She knew that Bessie was fastidiously neat in the arrangement of her apartment; but now the bureau drawers were partly open, and garments hung over the edges; the wardrobe doors stood wide apart, and Mrs. Ashley saw at once that the travelling dress, bonnet and wrappings had all disappeared.</p> 
               <p>In wild alarm she tore open the curtains of the bed to find that it had not been slept in on the previous night, and she realized the fear which had struck dismay to her heart. She sank down, moaning:</p> 
               <p>"Gone-gone-lost to me forever! Oh, God! why will not my hard heart break at once? I have nothing left now-<emph>nothing!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>Winny had followed her to her young lady's chamber, and she lifted her mistress and placed her on a chair, with indignant commiseration, which found utterance in mingled reproaches and consolations.</p> 
               <p>"I jest knowed you'd all drive my young missis to suffin dreffle afore you was done, an' you <emph>has</emph> done it now. De pore thing's runned away to get out'n de eberlasting hot water dat was kep' bilin' 'round her. Thar, mistis, don't look so white and flimsy like, caze we'll be <emph>sho</emph> to find her, an' bring her back as good as ever. Oh, my blessed Marster, what <emph>can</emph> de matter be, dat you set up a scritch like dat!"</p> 
               <p>On the table lay Bessie's open portfolio, and a folded paper rested on the leaves, on which was written, in large letters, "For Minny."</p> 
               <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6346-00000112"/> 
               <p>Trembling, and scarcely able to hold herself up, Mrs. Ashley grasped the note, glanced at the words traced within, and uttered the cry which had so alarmed Winny.</p>

               </q> 
               <p>Unable longer to control herself, Mrs. Ashley burst into such wild, hysteric cries as soon brought the whole household round her, and the flight of Bessie at once became known to the servants.</p> 
               <p>The unanimous opinion among them was, that their young lady had eloped to avoid the persecutions they all knew she had endured on account of her refusal to marry Frank, and the deepest sympathy was felt and expressed for her. It was agreed among them that no messenger should be sent to Arden Place to inform Mr. Ashley of what had occurred, till their mistress was in a condition to give orders to that effect.</p> 
               <p>Sambo was told to saddle the pony, and go over to the Oaks to warn Mr. Wentworth of Bessie's disappearance; but that young renegade thought it best to loiter in the woods till he saw Frank galloping toward Ashurst at full speed.</p> 
               <p>The boy plucked up courage to ride across the road in front of him, at the same time making a sign to him to stop and speak with him. Frank drew up and eagerly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Has anything been heard from her, Sambo, that you were sent to meet me?"</p> 
               <p>"Please, sir, 'taint dat what brung me here. I were sent arter you, but I were 'feared to go <emph>thar</emph> agin to-day, caze I's bin to de Oaks once dis mornin' long o' Miss Bessie's sie's orders. She's done gone clean off, please, sir, an' I went wi' her to the train; but I aint tole nobody but you, sir, caze she tole me not ter."</p> 
               <p>Frank turned his excited face toward the speaker, and said:</p> 
               <p>"It is true, then, that your young mistress is gone, and <emph>you</emph> helped her off? Tell me every particular, that I may know where to follow her."</p> 
               <p>After much circumlocution, Wentworth gathered from the lad that soon after daylight, Bessie had come to the stable where he was feeding the pony, and ordered him to saddle that and her own riding horse. She gave him some silver to ride with her whither she meant to go, and say nothing of it to any one until questioned by Mr. Wentworth himself. By that time she would be beyond pursuit, and he might tell all he knew.</p> 
               <p>Bessie had also given him a letter with orders to take it to the Oaks and place it in the hands of Miss Welby herself, but not to say a word on the subject of her departure from Ashurst. To the unbounded amazement of the lad, she rode to the station, caught the northern train, and was out of sight before he fully comprehended that she was actually going away.</p> 
               <p>Sambo then made his way to the Oaks, greatly exercised in mind by the burdensome secret confided to his keeping; but he was true to his promise, and said nothing of his young lady's departure when he was admitted to Miss Welby's presence for the purpose of delivering the letter confided to his care. He returned home, heard the affair discussed among the servants, but still held his peace as to the share he had had in getting his young mistress safely off.</p> 
               <p>After an early breakfast Wentworth had also gone over to the Oaks in the hope that he should find Delancey<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6346-00000113"/> there, and between them they could concert some course of action that would end in triumphing over his uncle. But he was not among the guests who had arrived, and the bride elect was not visible.</p> 
               <p>Frank spent a few hours with Rufus, who informed him that Bessie had that morning very mysteriously sent a letter to Delancey under cover to his sister. No suspicion of what had actually taken place arose till one of the servants came in to say that the news had gone through the neighborhood that Miss Ashley had disappeared from her home on the previous night.</p> 
               <p>Wentworth mounted his horse in hot haste, and set out on his return to Ashurst. Bewildered more than ever by Sambo's account of Bessie's evasion, he again put spurs to his horse, and never drew rein till he reached the house.</p> 
               <p>By this time Mrs. Ashley had become more composed, and when Frank's return was made known to her, she sent for him to come to her room. When he entered, he found her lying on her bed, her features so white and drawn that she looked twenty years older to him than on the previous night. When he saw her thus, all Frank's anger at her late conduct vanished, and he took her hand and tenderly said:</p> 
               <p>"I already have some trace of Bessie, Minny, and I will follow her at once, and bring her back to you. Don't give up so; she has not gone off with Delancey, if that is your fear."</p> 
               <p>"I am aware of that," she faintly replied. "I know whither she has gone, and for what purpose, but I am too weak to make explanations now-they can be given later. She will be found in New York, I have every reason to believe; what she seeks there you will know soon enough. But she is unprotected, her money may be exhausted, and I tremble for what may happen to a young and inexperienced girl alone in a city like that. Follow her, Frank, and inquire for her at the house of George Allen, Fifth Street. I believe she will assume my former name, so you had better inquire if Miss Wilde has been there, and where she is to be found."</p> 
               <p>"Did she leave any writing by which you gained this information?" asked Frank, much puzzled.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes-a note was left for me. She did not absolutely tell me whither she had gone, but from something that passed between us last night, I am led to conjecture that if any one can guide you to her, it will be Mr. Allen. Oh, Frank! spare me now, for you see how I suffer; only do my bidding, and when you meet Bessie, tell her she may reveal all to you. I shall not live to bear the-"</p> 
               <p>Her voice sunk away in a faint moan, and Frank, touched by her evident anguish, hastened to say:</p> 
               <p>"I will obey you, Minny, and I go now to make my preparations for leaving on the next train that passes north. Good-bye; keep up your spirits, for I shall be sure to bring Bessie back to you in safety. Has any one been sent to inform my uncle of what has happened? Oh! his rage will be fearful."</p> 
               <p>It was soon ascertained that no one had undertaken the task of conveying such unwelcome information to Arden Place, and Wentworth said, as he had ample time to see Mr. Ashley before the hour for his departure arrived, he would go over himself and apprise him of Bessie's flight.</p> 
               <p>In half an hour he was on his way to his uncle, with many misgivings as to the effect the news he carried with him might have on his treatment of Evelyn. Only the day before she had been released from her confinement, and the glimpse the lover had obtained of her assured him that<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6346-00000114"/> she was suffering already from its effects. She had lost all her bright color, and her eyes looked dim with weeping.</p> 
               <p>But all Wentworth's anticipations of what might happen fell far short of the violence shown by Mr. Ashley when he was assured that Bessie had actually braved his authority so far as to escape from him clandestinely.</p> 
               <p>He raved, he abused Mrs. Ashley as an inefficient guardian, accused Wentworth of having helped Bessie off, and finally ordered poor Evelyn into instant confinement, to remain there till the runaway was recaptured, and brought back to Ashurst to undergo the sentence already pronounced upon her.</p> 
               <p>Frank made no attempt at self-defence, for he saw it would be quite useless. He saw his beloved returned to her dreary prison, without the power to defend or assist her in any way, but he was resolved that it should not long be so. On his return, he would find means to release Evelyn, or perish in the attempt.</p> 
               <p>His uncle angrily said, as he saw him about to take his leave:</p> 
               <p>"And what do you mean to do to recover your betrothed wife? It is more important to you to bring her back safe than it even is to me."</p> 
               <p>"I am going in pursuit of her, sir. She is known to have taken the northern train, and Minny thinks that she has gone to New York."</p> 
               <p>"New York, where that fellow, Delancey, lives! Yes, I see now that you and Mrs. Ashley have been playing into each other's hands, and while you hypocritically pretended to be making up your mind to do what is right, you were slyly urging Bessie to her ruin. If she joins Delancey and becomes his wife, I will never forgive nor see her again, and I will double my vigilance over Evelyn. Don't flatter yourself that <emph>she</emph> will ever have the chance to elope with you."</p> 
               <p>"Bessie has not gone to Delancey, nor is he in New York at this time. I do not know what has taken her away in this mysterious manner, but I <emph>shall</emph> know when I find her again, for Minny bids her tell me all, which means, I suppose, that there is some cause for her leaving with which she is acquainted."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, ha! So Mrs. Ashley <emph>is</emph> implicated in this disgraceful transaction. I shall go to Ashurst myself, and insist on knowing why my daughter was permitted to make herself the talk of the county by going off in this scandalous manner. I will order the carriage at once."</p> 
               <p>"I think you will have your ride for nothing, sir, for Minny is too ill to receive you; she is not in a condition to bear the agitation of meeting you, and hearing your reproaches."</p> 
               <p>"I will write to her, then, and give her my opinion of her guardianship. I was a fool to suffer Bessie to remain with her a day after I came here. A pretty end has she come to, through Mrs. Ashley's culpable negligence and my own indulgence."</p> 
               <p>The last word caused a faint smile to curl Frank's lip, at which his uncle burst forth again in a furious tirade of abuse, in the midst of which he left him. As he was crossing the lawn to mount his horse, he encountered Maitland, with a savage frown on his young brow. The lad looked thoroughly enraged and disgusted as he addressed his cousin with both hands defiantly clenched:</p> 
               <p>"He's gone and locked Evy up in that den again, Frank, and if you had the spirit of a man in you, in place of running off after Bessie, who can always take care of herself, you would stop here and batter down that old rat-hole, if you couldn't get Evy out any other way."</p> 
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6346-00000115"/> 
               <p>"Would you help me, youngster, if I undertook such a thing?" asked Frank with interest.</p> 
               <p>"Of course I would. Hasn't Evy always stood by me, and I wouldn't be so mean as not to stand by her in such trouble as <emph>you</emph>'ve brought on her, and are now running away from."</p> 
               <p>"Don't accuse me of wrong-doing before you know all, Maitland. Suppose your father should find out that you had leagued against him, what do you think he would do to you?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, he'd blow me sky high, I suppose; but I'm like a cat, and I should be sure to come down safe. I ain't much afraid of him, because I can run away, and his old swelled feet keep him from running after me. If poor Evy could run as fast as I can, she'd be a deal better off."</p> 
               <p>"Evelyn loves you, Maitland, and she does everything she can to make you happy. I am glad to find that you have some gratitude to her for her kindness to you, and I am going to test it now. I am going to New York, but I shall be back in a few days. Find means to give her this note, which I wrote before leaving home, in the hope that I could give it to her myself. If you will place it safely in her hands, I promise to bring you whatever you may ask as your reward."</p> 
               <p>"Will you now, Frank? That is jolly! for I haven't a gun that is fit to shoot with, and I want one bad enough. I asked the governor for one, but he raved at me for wanting anything that will cost so much money. How much will it cost now? Do you think it would break him to get me one, Frank?"</p> 
               <p>"Never mind about the cost; it will not break me to buy one, and you shall have it when I come back if you will do my errand faithfully."</p> 
               <p>"There's my hand on it, Frank. Before the sun goes down Evy shall have this paper. Since Bessie stopped coming here, the old fellow yonder is crosser than ever, and the way he flies up at ma is a sin. I wonder how she stands it. But I'll be even with him for all that, for I mean to help you get Evelyn out of her prison; and if he breaks his heart storming, I sha'n't care much."</p> 
               <p>The two parted with a good understanding, and Wentworth went on his way with a lighter heart for the faint gleam of hope he had been able to impart to his beloved.</p> 
               <p>Keeping out of his father's sight, Maitland watched his opportunity, and made his way unobserved to the room beneath the tower. The key was left in the lock on the door of the lower apartment, though it was turned. The one which closed Evelyn's door was removed by old Hagar, and taken away with her; but this was allowed to remain, as the room was frequently resorted to for old lumber, and such odds and ends as are often in demand on a plantation.</p> 
               <p>Maitland had first assured himself that Hagar was in her own cabin, and not likely to visit her prisoner till supper time; so he made his way to the foot of the staircase, and was soon standing on the little platform in front of the door.</p> 
               <p>Evelyn was weeping bitterly when the sound of Maitland's voice speaking through the key-hole aroused her from the indulgence of her grief. She arose with alacrity, and went to the door to hear what he had to say.</p> 
               <p>He hissed through the narrow aperture:</p> 
               <p>"This is the meanest thing the gov'nor's been and done yet! After all Frank promised, he's gone and put you in this horrid old den again, just because Bessie's run off. I like her spirit, <emph>I</emph> do; and if you want to get away too, I am ready to help you."</p> 
               <p>"Don't talk in that way, Maty dear. Some one might<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6346-00000116"/> overhear you, and get you in a scrape with papa. I saw Frank a moment, but could not speak to him. Did-did he leave anything with you for me?"</p> 
               <p>"Of course he did, or I shouldn't be here now. He and I mean to get you out o' this, but we haven't yet quite fixed on a plan. I'll push his note under the door, and if you want to answer it, I'll bring you some paper and a pencil, and give your letter to Frank when he comes back."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Maty, you are a good boy in spite of all your wildness. Make haste and give me the note before any one comes; and be sure to come here every day and speak to me."</p> 
               <p>"Yes-I'll do that much for you anyhow, Evy. Look out now; here goes for a circumbendibus way of getting a love-letter. It's prime fun to get ahead of the governor in this manner."</p> 
               <p>He stooped and thrust the paper Wentworth had given him through the wide crevice beneath the door, and then made good his retreat without being observed by any one.</p> 
               <p>Jane was lying upon her bed in a state of semi-consciousness. She had heard and understood what was passing between the brother and sister, though her brain was still bewildered, and she could not account for the presence of her young lady as a prisoner in her room.</p> 
               <p>Evelyn snatched up the precious missive, and by the light of the fire eagerly read the lines her lover had addressed to her. They ran as follows:</p> 
               <q>
                  <floatingText xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">

                           <p>"MY DARLING-Keep up your spirits, and hope for the best, for I now see my way clearly before me. Since Bessie has thus openly defied her father, she will never return unless perfect freedom of action is granted her.</p> 
                           <p>"I cannot tell what led to her flight, but I shall soon know. From Mrs. Ashley's extreme agitation, when I saw her this morning, I think that something passed between them last night which led to this escapade.</p> 
                            
                           <p>"At all events, it places me where I was before; and when I get back, I will rescue you at all hazards.</p>

                              <salute>"Your devoted</salute>

               </q> 
               <p>Evelyn pressed the lines to her lips and heart, and in the sweet assurance that her lover was faithful to her she almost forgot the dreary prison room and the half dead woman who lay in helpless immobility near her. Jane had again sunk into a heavy sleep, from which she was aroused by the appearance of Hagar with her supper.</p> 
               <p>This woman came up regularly three times each day, to perform such services as were necessary for the invalid, and to bring her young lady such food as her father permitted to be sent her. He did not absolutely put her on bread and water, as he had at one time threatened, but no delicacies were sent up to her, and her food was quite as plain as that of the sick woman.</p> 
               <p>Evelyn did not repine at this, for she had little appetite, and, deprived of exercise, she knew she would fall ill if she were supplied with luxurious food.</p> 
               <p>She petitioned to have some books sent her, and Augusta so far relented as to send them to her without her husband's knowledge. Every day Maitland managed to visit her door a few moments without being discovered; but, in spite of all, the time passed heavily enough to her who seemed stripped of all the joys of youth and life by the arbitrary thraldom in which she was held.</p> 
               <p>Evelyn watched over her nurse with extreme solicitude, and she sometimes thought that Jane knew what was passing around her, though she pretended to be quite helpless and stolid whenever Hagar was in the room. The old woman had delegated to Evelyn the duty of administering Jane's medicine; thus she was entirely ignorant of the change of remedies, and dreamed not that she was undoing what her master had striven to accomplish for months past.</p> 
               <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6346-00000117"/> 
               <p>When Mr. Ashley's first violence against the lovers broke forth on the ship when he discovered their attachment to each other, a sharp interview had taken place between himself and Jane. What she then said to him convinced Mr. Ashley that if the interests of her nursling would not be compromised by a union with Wentworth, she willed it to take place. If he opposed the marriage, she threatened to reveal her secret, and give Evelyn freedom to choose her own fate, without asking his consent.</p> 
               <p>Jane consented to defer action till their arrival at Arden Place, and her crafty and unscrupulous adversary prepared to use the means he had provided for this very contingency. Unluckily for the nurse, she ate something that disagreed with her, and the opportunity Ashley wanted was found. He would not take her life, he thought, but he would cast the strong woman into imbecility of mind and partial paralysis of body by the use of the powerful drug he had obtained in Marseilles.</p> 
               <p>With his activity of mind, Ashley had dabbled in nearly every science, and in that of medicine he had acquired considerable skill. The minute quantity of his powder that he at first caused to be administered to her, caused a drowsiness that could not be shaken off-a larger dose produced a species of coma, and in that state she was conveyed to the tower, and left to the mercy of old Hagar. He pretended to change the medicine, but under various disguises, the same drug was given in sufficient quantities to keep both the body and the mind of the unfortunate woman in a prostrate condition.</p> 
               <p>Eventually she must have passed from this state into death, but for the observations made by Evelyn, and her resolution to torment her no more with potions that evidently produced no beneficial result.</p> 
               <p>On the second evening after her return to her prison, Evelyn was sitting by the fire listening to the rising wind which heralded a storm, and casting anxious glances upward to the clouds that drifted rapidly over the sky, occasionally permitting a glimpse of the stars and then veiling all in obscurity.</p> 
               <p>There was no light in the room save that from the stove, which fortunately had an open front which allowed the glare of the fire to shine fitfully throughout the room.</p> 
               <p>At length the storm burst with wild fury. The wind shook the tower to its foundation and rattled the dome till the lonely watcher began to fear that it might be blown away. The pattering of the rain upon the glass was inexpressibly dreary, and the helpless girl sat pale and shivering listening with dread to the wild blast that roared without.</p> 
               <p>The wind at last died away, and Evelyn was about to arise to prepare for her nightly rest, when she was startled by a voice from the bed saying quite distinctly:</p> 
               <p>"Miss Evelyn, is that you?"</p> 
               <p>She sprang to Jane's side and was surprised to see that her eyes were wide open, with an expression of intelligence in them; she joyfully said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma bonne,</foreign> you are better. You know me once more! Thank God that I have been able to help you."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I know you, and I have seen you here for several days, but I wouldn't speak till I knew I could talk rationally. Why are <emph>you</emph> put here to look after an old hulk like me? Has Mr. Ashley shut us up together, now that he has got possession of the property he came to claim in your name?"</p> 
               <p>"Don't talk so wildly, Jane. Your mind cannot be quite right yet."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it is," persisted the woman. "<emph>His</emph> infernal doses made me sick, but when I struggled against taking them<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6346-00000118"/> they were forced on me. As long as I knew anything, I knew that <emph>they</emph> were keeping me on my back, a demented old fool who could do nothing but sleep, even when I knew you were in danger. I have been getting better for several days, but I waited till I was strong and sensible enough to speak with you about what concerns you. Is it true that we are put off here together, Miss Evelyn?"</p> 
               <p>The young girl changed color and reluctantly said:</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Jane, it is true. My father is offended with me, and he sent me-"</p> 
               <p>The woman here sat up in her bed and wrathfully interrupted her:</p> 
               <p>"And where is Mr. Wentworth? What is he doing that he does not get you out of such a disgraceful place as this for <emph>you</emph> to stay in?"</p> 
               <p>"Frank is not to blame, Jane. He has done all he can for me, but I cannot seek his protection without the consent of my father."</p> 
               <p>"Consent of fiddlesticks!" exclaimed the irate woman, who now fully understood how and why she had been circumvented and deprived of all power to assist her young lady. "Listen to me, Miss Evelyn, for I am telling you the solemn truth. Mr. Ashley is no more your father than I am your mother, and if you want to run off with this fine young man you needn't stop to ask <emph>his</emph> consent."</p> 
               <p>Evelyn burst in tears.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Jane, your mind still wanders, or you would not talk in such a manner as this. Harsh and cruel as my father has been to me, I love him too dearly to seek my own happiness without his approbation."</p> 
               <p>The nurse raised herself by a sudden effort and earnestly said:</p> 
               <p>"I am as sound in mind as you are, and I repeat that Mr. Ashley is not your father. <emph>His</emph> daughter died in my sister-in-law's house in France, and <emph>you</emph> were adopted in her place because she was the heiress of great wealth."</p> 
               <p>"Who then am I?" asked Evelyn, with a frightened expression, for Jane spoke so calmly now, that she was constrained to believe that she fully understood the purport of her words.</p> 
               <p>"You had been left with Madeline, who took in children to nurse, by an American gentleman, who paid liberally at first, but he never came back again, nor ever sent any one to inquire after you. You looked like the dead child, and Mr. Ashley at once made a bargain with Maddy to take you in her place. She was naturally glad to rid herself of a strange child that had no claims on her, but she was a soft-hearted creature, and I don't think she would have agreed to give you up if I had not been employed to go with you as your nurse. That is why I refused to leave you when Mr. Ashley offered me a large sum of money if I would stay in Europe when you were coming here. I might as well have done so, for all the use I've been to you since I've been here; but I'll be even with him now as sure as my name is Jane Tompkins."</p> 
               <p>She might have talked on much longer without interruption, for Evelyn sat staring at her with an expression of utter bewilderment, and it was several moments before she gasped:</p> 
               <p>"This is terrible-terrible!-who can I be, Jane? to whom can I belong?"</p> 
               <p>"God knows, but I don't. The man that left you said you were not his own, but had been adopted by his wife."</p> 
               <p>"What was his name? What part of the United States was he from?"</p> 
               <p>"There you're too hard for me. Mr. Ashley got the name from Maddy, but I have no memory for names. Get out of this dreadful place as soon as you can, Miss Evelyn,<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6346-00000119"/> and go with Mr. Wentworth to church. When you come back man and wife, go before the swindling rascal that treats you as if you was nobody, while he is living in clover on the money he pretends is yours, and tell him that <emph>I</emph> told you this story and you know it to be true."</p> 
               <p>"But suppose I find it impossible to do that, Jane? Besides, you have aided in the swindle of which you accuse Mr. Ashley, and if it comes to light you will be equally liable to punishment with him."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I don't care about that much if <emph>he</emph> comes in for his share too. Only you marry Mr. Wentworth and make yourself happy, and it don't matter much what becomes of me."</p> 
               <p>Evelyn was touched with this proof of her affection for herself, and she pressed the hand of Jane to her lips and said:</p> 
               <p>"You have always been my best friend, Jane, and now I can understand why you were my only one in this family. If Frank will agree to marry a nameless wanderer, who has so long been imposed on the world as a great heiress, I promise to do as you bid me. With the certainty that I am not Mr. Ashley's daughter, all my scruples vanish, and although I have a strong attachment for him I have so long looked on as my father, I will effect my escape at the earliest possible moment after Frank returns."</p> 
               <p>"Where has he gone, and left you to pine away in this windy old rattletrap?"</p> 
               <p>"He has gone to open the way to our future union," she evasively replied.</p> 
               <p>After a few moments' silence Evelyn again addressed her nurse, and drew from her a minute relation of everything that had occurred at the time she was removed from her sister's house. After questioning her again and again, she came to the conclusion that Jane's mind was perfectly clear, and her memory on the important points in question unimpaired.</p> 
               <p>The conclusion slowly dawned on her mind that she was indeed an orphan, without name or station, and in it she found courage to resolve to write to Wentworth the history of the fraud which had been perpetrated, and if he still asked her to be his wife, she would no longer scruple to leave clandestinely the home in which she had suffered so much, in which she really possessed no more right than any other stranger.</p> 
               <p>Her supposed wealth had brought her nothing but suffering, and she was even happy in the thought that with its renunciation she gained the right to consult only her own happiness and that of her chosen one. Of Frank's willingness to take her for herself alone, she never for one moment doubted, and a serene calm which had not rested on her brow for months, now settled there.</p> 
               <p>She counselled her nurse to conceal the improvement in her condition from old Hagar till Frank returned, and some measures had been concerted for their deliverance from captivity. To this Jane readily consented, and several days passed over in alternate hope and expectation.</p> 
               <p>Day after day Maitland managed to get to her door, and communicate such news to her as he thought could interest her. Nothing had been heard from Wentworth or Bessie, and his father still raged over her escape from his tyranny.</p> 
               <p>He brought with him the paper and pencil he had promised, and Evelyn wrote a long letter, in which she detailed the extraordinary revelation her nurse had made to her, and expressed her determination to leave the tower with the first opportunity offered, leaving behind her an explanation of her reasons for repudiating the authority of Mr. Ashley.</p> 
               <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6346-00000120"/> 
               <p>This done, her sad heart awaited the return of her lover as the signal of freedom, and grew sick with hope deferred.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">BESSIE IN NEW YORK.</head> 
               <p>BESSIE set out on her northern journey like one in a dream. She had a defined purpose before her, but she did not, as yet, see very clearly how it was to be attained. On the way she would decide on the course she would pursue when she reached New York.</p> 
               <p>The cars were crowded, but she succeeded in finding a seat, and sank down on it, holding her thick veil closely over her face-not only to escape recognition, but to conceal her youthfulness from her fellow travellers.</p> 
               <p>Her summer tour had given her self-possession and a knowledge of what was necessary to be done; and although her mind was still in a confused whirl from the startling and humiliating revelation which had been made to her on the previous night, she understood her present position, and had the nerve to bear up under the difficulties before her.</p> 
               <p>When the conductor came around to collect the fare, she told him her destination, and requested a ticket to New York, adding that as she was alone, she would be obliged to him if he would inform her when it became necessary to change cars, and show her what train to get on when they came to a stopping place.</p> 
               <p>The sweet toned voice and courteous address won on the man at once. He saw that she was young, and from a glimpse of her features through her thick veil, he decided that she must be pretty. With a respectful bow, he replied:</p> 
               <p>"I will come to you myself, Miss, when you have to change, but it will be some time first. If you wish it, I will put you in charge of the conductor on the next train, and tell him to pass you on to New York."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you-I shall be very glad if you will do so, for I have never travelled alone before."</p> 
               <p>"Have you a check for your trunk, Miss?"</p> 
               <p>For an instant she hesitated, but her native truthfulness prevailed, and she said:</p> 
               <p>"It was left behind. I have nothing with me but this carpet bag, and that I can take care of myself."</p> 
               <p>The man gave her a keen glance, and passed on without saying anything more.</p> 
               <p>This conversation had been furtively listened to by a sallow-looking individual, with gray whiskers and a heavy looking eye, who sat on the same seat with Bessie, and he now turned and deliberately surveyed her.</p> 
               <p>He wore a rusty black suit and overcoat to match, a white choker, and a napless hat; his features were shining with the unctuous food with which he had evidently gorged himself, and Bessie mentally said:</p> 
               <p>"Chadband <foreign xml:lang="LAT">redivivus.</foreign>"</p> 
               <p>After a pause, the stranger spoke in a solemn voice:</p> 
               <p>"Young woman, it becomes my duty to offer you some advice. You seem a goodly brand to pluck from the burning, and I must speak a word in season even to the solitary wayfarer cast upon my path."</p> 
               <p>At this address, Bessie stared at him and asked:</p> 
               <p>"Did you speak to me, sir?"</p> 
               <p>"Of course I did. I see no other young woman anywhere near me, and when I find a-a-"</p> 
               <p>He hesitated; and although her heart was beating painfully<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6346-00000121"/> fully, Bessie's native spirit came to her assistance, and she quickly said:</p> 
               <p>"I will not trouble you to find a comparison for me, sir, and as to your advice, I have no use for it, and you will oblige me by refraining to give it."</p> 
               <p>"Caught a snapping-turtle, in place of a turtle-dove, eh, old fellow?" asked a youngster, sitting on the seat in front of them. "I like your spirit, Miss, and if you will accept of me as an escort, I will protect you from annoyance, and see you safe to New York, where my uncle lives."</p> 
               <p>The speaker was about sixteen, and the frank face, clear eyes and smiling lips turned toward her, favorably impressed the young traveller.</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, sir," she demurely replied, "but I believe I shall do very well with the conductor's assistance."</p> 
               <p>The youth nodded, and good-humoredly replied:</p> 
               <p>"Very well, Miss, but if he shouldn't come, I shall be on hand to help you along."</p> 
               <p>She thanked him, and hoped she would have no further annoyance from her elderly companion; but in a few moments he burst forth in a soliloquy on the depravity of the human heart, and the especial intractibility of the young, which was evidently meant for her; but Bessie turned a deaf ear to him, and resolutely compressed her lips to repress the replies that occasionally suggested themselves.</p> 
               <p>When the train stopped for breakfast, she was compelled to lift her veil on entering the saloon, and the two who had already spoken to her were on the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">qui vive</foreign> to obtain a view of her features. The young man walked by her side, while the elder one followed directly in her footsteps.</p> 
               <p>When they reached the table, the latter officiously placed a seat for her, but she turned away from him and addressed her young companion:</p> 
               <p>"I thank you for the offer you made me not long ago, and I accept it. Protect me from being annoyed by this man, and I shall remember you with gratitude."</p> 
               <p>"I'll do it with pleasure; but you need not be afraid of him, for there's no harm in him. He is only one of those fellows that walk about the world, telling everybody else that they are meaner than dirt, and deserve nothing but being roasted through all eternity. I know something of him, and I am sure he does not mean half of what he says. Take this seat-think I am your brother for the time being-and we shall get along famously."</p> 
               <p>Bessie laughed, threw up her veil, and rather enjoyed the look of pleased surprise that came into the face of the youth as he looked into her own. He naively said:</p> 
               <p>"From the sound of your voice, I thought you must be pretty, but you are as handsome as a princess."</p> 
               <p>"A good deal handsomer than most princesses, therefore there is all the more danger for her, poor thing," groaned the cynic. "Young lady, had you no friend, no brother to come with you on such a long journey as you are going to make? You are much too young and too fair to be permitted to travel alone."</p> 
               <p>His interest in her seemed so genuine that Bessie more gently replied to him:</p> 
               <p>"I was suddenly called away on business of importance, which my mother, who is a widow, could not herself attend to. If you will permit me, sir, I shall get along very well with the assistance this young gentleman has tendered me."</p> 
               <p>With a deep sigh, her would be Mentor applied himself to the voluminous breakfast with which he intended to repair his energies, and mindful of the limited time allowed for meals on a railroad journey, he uttered no sound save a contented grunt over a steak that was particularly juicy and tender.</p> 
               <p>Bessie escaped from the table with her new friend long<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6346-00000122"/> before the sound of the whistle called her annoyer from his repast, and when her seedy-looking monitor returned to his place, he was chagrined to find that a change of seats had been effected by the young couple, and a fat, pompous-looking man occupied the one beside himself, while Bessie and her boy admirer sat together and chatted on all that was passing before them in a manner that caused him to believe that all his admonitions had been thrown away upon them.</p> 
               <p>Deeply seated as the pain at her heart was-gnawing as was the sense of degradation in her mother's crime-Bessie maintained the outward show of cheerfulness; for she was not one to lay bare her wounded heart to the gaze of every passer by. With the courage of the Spartan boy, she could clutch to her side the creature that was tearing it, sooner than betray her sufferings to those on whose sympathy she had no claim; so she smiled and talked with her intelligent companion till the conductor came to warn her that at the next stopping place they would change cars.</p> 
               <p>The youth at once said:</p> 
               <p>"You need not trouble yourself, Mr. Walker, this young lady has accepted my escort to New York, and you know me well enough to assure her that I will take as good care of her as if she were my sister."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly-you are entirely reliable, George-I can answer for that," and the speaker was lost in the crowd that rushed toward the door. Bessie was glad to cling to the arm of her companion till they made their way upon the train that was awaiting them.</p> 
               <p>On-on they whirled through the remainder of the day-through twilight, through darkness shrieked the engine, scattering a train of fire in its wake; but fatigued as she was, Bessie could not sleep. The uncertainty of all that lay before her-the novelty of her own position, and the heavy pain at her young heart, effectually murdered rest, and she reached New York without having lost her consciousness in slumber for a single moment.</p> 
               <p>When the cars thundered into the dpt the young man roused himself and said:</p> 
               <p>"Here we are, safe and sound. When I get safe to the end of a railroad journey, I always feel as if I must say, Thank God for all his mercies."</p> 
               <p>"Hem!" said the voice of the Mentor, who had made his way to their side, "I am glad to find that you have some sense of what is due to the Ruler of the earth, young man. I had not given you as much credit for piety as that. Pray, if I may ask, whither are you going to take this young girl?"</p> 
               <p>"Wherever she wants to go, sir, so you had better move on, and leave the way clear for us to get out."</p> 
               <p>"You are impertinent, youngster; but that is the way of the young generation in this country. I feel a deep interest in this young pilgrim, and it is my wish to protect her to the extent of my humble ability from the snares of this wicked city. I have a sister who would take her in, if she has no near friends to whom she is going."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I dare say," was the sarcastic response. "She'd be sure to be finely <emph>taken in</emph> if she went to Mrs. Radway's to board. I presume she has friends, and I can take her to them without any assistance from you."</p> 
               <p>Although this colloquy was intended as an aside, Bessie heard every word they uttered, and she felt thankful even to the repulsive-looking stranger for the interest he manifested in her. Now that she was in this great city <emph>alone</emph>-thrown absolutely on her own resources, she trembled at her unprotected position, and after a slight pause she faltered:</p> 
               <p>"I-I have no friends to whom I can go. I came to<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6346-00000123"/> New York on especial business that did not admit of delay; and I thought of going to the St. Nicholas, for I have stopped there twice while travelling with friends. But if this gentleman's sister keeps a boarding house, as he seems to be a minister, I-I believe it will be best for me to go to her house-that is, if she will consent to receive an utter stranger for a few days."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, she will do that on my recommendation, Miss. My name is also Radway, and the lady I refer to is my brother's widow. I am the Reverend Jeremiah Radway, and if I can be instrumental in saving a young creature like you from the dangers of a great city like this, I shall feel as if I am performing my Master's duty."</p> 
               <p>Bessie gave her proud head a toss and quickly replied:</p> 
               <p>"The danger to me is entirely imaginary on your side, sir, but I shall be glad to be saved from the annoyance of going alone to a large hotel. As this young gentleman seems to know something of you and your sister, I believe I will go to her house for the few days I shall remain here."</p> 
               <p>"You'll be sure to repent it," whispered the youth, "for old Rad is an extortioner; she keeps a boarding-house for saints, but fleeces sinners most unmercifully. But if you can afford to stay at the St. Nick, you won't mind that, I suppose."</p> 
               <p>"For the short stay I shall make in New York it will not matter much where I stay, so that I am in a quiet and safe place. Mrs. Radway's house will at least be more private than a hotel, so I believe I will go there."</p> 
               <p>Then turning to the Reverend Jeremiah she gracefully said:</p> 
               <p>"I am very grateful to you, sir, for saving me from the necessity of going to a hotel alone, and I shall be much obliged if you can secure me a room in your sister's house for a few days."</p> 
                
               <p>The face of Radway shone even more than before, and he said:</p> 
               <p>"It is settled then that you go with me. You will find it much more agreeable to stay in a private boarding-house. I will get a carriage, and you and your young friend here can go with me to my sister's."</p> 
               <p>Much as she had shrunk from this coarse, shabby-looking man at first, Bessie now comprehended that in his uncouth way he meant to befriend her, and she turned with a smile to her young protector and said:</p> 
               <p>"I will trouble you no more, since Mr. Radway has kindly undertaken to see me safe under a respectable shelter. But before we part, tell me the name of the young friend to whom I have been so much indebted on this journey."</p> 
               <p>"My name is George Heath. But I am not going to give you up till I see you safe with Mrs. Rad. She lives only a few squares from my uncle's, so I shall not go out of my way at all. Since you know my name now, will you think it impertinent if I ask you to give me yours?"</p> 
               <p>At this question a painful pang darted through Bessie's heart, but she bravely repressed it and replied:</p> 
               <p>"Of course you are entitled to know it. My name is Bessie Wilde."</p> 
               <p>"Wilde-Wilde," repeated Mr. Radway, thoughtfully-"I knew a young sailor of that name once; he was a true-hearted man, and I believe a good Christian. And now I think of it, you look very much like him too; you might be his daughter, only he never had but one, and she died in her infancy."</p> 
               <p>Bessie's self-command almost failed her at this evident allusion to her father, and she was now as anxious to go with Mr. Radway as she had before been to avoid his officious attentions. She was about to inquire impulsively<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6346-00000124"/> into the history of the person he referred to, when she remembered how important it was to conceal from the outside world the part her mother had played. So she only said:</p> 
               <p>"It is not an uncommon name, I believe, sir, but some other time I shall be glad to hear all you can tell me of this namesake of mine."</p> 
               <p>By this time they had gained the floor of the dpt, and delighted with the fair waif he had saved from temptation, Mr. Radway soon engaged a carriage which drove them toward the central part of the city, and set them down at the door of a handsome house on Bleecker Street. In days gone by, this had been the aristocratic portion of the city, but the stately dwellings, once the abodes of the wealthy, had been converted into boarding-houses, and in one of them Mrs. Radway had set up her household gods.</p> 
               <p>At her door Bessie parted from young Heath, who promised to call on her the next day, and if she desired it, he would show her some of the lions of the city.</p> 
               <p>"Thank you," she replied, "but I have already seen them, though I shall be glad to see you again, and hope you will be sure to call."</p> 
               <p>"I should hardly like to miss doing so," he laughingly replied, and so they parted.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Radway conducted her into the house, and left her in a prim, faded-looking room, while he went in search of the mistress of the establishment. Some time elapsed before a thin, sallow-faced woman appeared, who surveyed poor Bessie with a pair of keen black eyes, and her thin lips unclosed to say:</p> 
               <p>"My brother is a simple-hearted man, Miss, and he often brings strange customers to me when he comes off a journey. It seems to me that you are very young to be running about the world by yourself, and I wonder your friends don't take better care of you."</p> 
                
               <p>By this time Bessie was wearied out, and her high spirit succumbed before these hard words. Tears sprang to her eyes as she said:</p> 
               <p>"I was compelled by very painful circumstances to undertake this journey alone, madam, but you will have no trouble with me. I only ask shelter here for a few days, and I am quite able to pay for all I may have. In less than a week I hope to be safe again in my own home in Maryland."</p> 
               <p>"Well, if you're able to pay your way, it makes a difference, of course; but you have no trunk, my brother tells me, and such people are always looked sharply after by boarding-house keepers."</p> 
               <p>In reply to this, Bessie took out her porte-monnaie, and inquired the price of board with a comfortable room. Mrs. Radway more respectfully said:</p> 
               <p>"I always charge a dollar and a half a day to them that's not regular boarders, but since you have money, you need not be in a hurry about paying."</p> 
               <p>To this Bessie replied by giving her a ten dollar note and half a dollar in silver, as she said:</p> 
               <p>"I may remain with you a week, and if I should leave before the end of that time, I shall not call on you to refund."</p> 
               <p>"Very well, Miss. I see that you are a lady, and understand how to get along, even if you are young. Your room shall be ready directly, for you must be tired if you have come all the way from Maryland on the railroad."</p> 
               <p>She left the room, and after a weary half hour returned for her new lodger, who gladly followed her up two flights of stairs to a small room in the wing of the building. Everything in it looked worn and hardly used, but it was scrupulously clean, and a bright anthracite fire burned in the grate.</p> 
               <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6346-00000125"/> 
               <p>In no mood to be critical, Bessie gladly threw off her wrappings, and declaring that she needed nothing but sleep, she requested that she might not be disturbed till the next morning. As soon as Mrs. Radway left her alone, she bolted her door, prepared for bed, and was soon wrapped in the sound sleep which follows long-continued excitement and fatigue.</p> 
               <p>When Mrs. Radway rejoined her brother in the dining-room below, where he was taking some refection, she replied to his inquiring look by sharply saying:</p> 
               <p>"It's all right so far as the money is concerned, for she's paid me a week in advance, but I do wish, Miah, that you wouldn't be always bringing doubtful sort of people to me to take in. My regular boarders have complained more than once, and with good cause, of the strange people you have brought among them."</p> 
               <p>"Umph! an ungodly set they are, to blame me for doing what is my duty. Christ himself said, 'Inasmuch as ye do it unto one of these, ye do it unto me.' They can't complain of this young girl at all events, for the class she evidently belongs to is far superior to that of any of <emph>your</emph> boarders. I had a reason for not losing sight of her, connected with my journey South, but I can't explain it now. I'll tell you all about it when Captain Martin comes back, and I'm looking for his ship every hour."</p> 
               <p>"You're very mysterious, but it's no use trying to comprehend such a man as you are," said Mrs. Radway, with contemptuous resignation, which her brother-in-law thought it best to ignore, as the cold lunch she had set before him was very abundant and palatable; but she only restrained her curiosity to have it gratified at a better opportunity, and she was resolved to have the whole story out of him before she slept, which she accordingly did.</p> 
               <p>When Bessie was awakened on the following morning by the sharp ring of a bell at her door, she left dreamland, where she had been wandering with Delancey, sat up in bed, looked around her dingy room, and, for a few moments, was unable to remember how she came to be in such a place. Then the rush of recollection came back, and she moaned:</p> 
               <p>"I am in this great Babel, without a friend to help me, bound on a quest, the result of which will, in all probability, bring disgrace upon my own mother; it may also cause unhappiness among those who have reared the true Miss Ashley as their own daughter. But I must on-on; I dare not pause till I have done justice to that defrauded girl."</p> 
               <p>She arose, made a careful toilette, and descended to find that breakfast was over, and the other boarders gone. Mrs. Radway seemed to have thawed toward her a little, and she said with a smile as faded as her furniture:</p> 
               <p>"You are late, Miss Wilde, but your recent fatigue is sufficient excuse for you. I have kept some coffee hot till you came down, and you will find the baker's rolls delicious. I always get the best of bread, and it's lucky for the tardy ones, for I never give hot cakes to them that are not in time."</p> 
               <p>Bessie assured her that she required nothing more than a cup of coffee and some bread and butter, and the lady smilingly went on:</p> 
               <p>"My brother was rather disappointed at not seeing you before he went out, but he saw in the morning paper that the ship of an old friend had arrived in port, and he has gone down to the Astor to see the captain, who usually puts up there when in the city. He bade me say to you that he would be sure to see you at dinner."</p> 
               <p>Internally thankful for anything that removed Mr. Radway from spying on her movements, Bessie ate her breakfast, and then inquired if a city directory was in the house.</p> 
               <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6346-00000126"/> 
               <p>After some search one was produced, and she eagerly looked for the name of George Allen, and the number of his residence. Many Allens were found, but not one bearing the name she sought. There was a George T. Allen who lived up on Twenty-fourth Street, and this gentleman she concluded must be the person she sought.</p> 
               <p>Bessie remarked that Mrs. Radway followed her movements inquisitively, and scanned her features with an expression she could not understand, and she determined to ask no further assistance from her. She returned to her own room, put on her furs and bonnet, and after taking the precaution to note down the number of the house, she sallied forth, got into the first omnibus that passed toward Broadway, and went on till she saw a bookstore.</p> 
               <p>Bessie stopped there, and purchasing a map of the city, she sat down by a bookstand and studied the topography of the upper portion of the city till she thought she understood it.</p> 
               <p>One of the clerks, at her request, then stopped a Fifth Avenue omnibus, and with a beating heart she was driven toward the bourne she was so anxiously seeking. She alighted near the entrance of Twenty-fourth Street, and went on her way on foot.</p> 
               <p>She found the number she sought; with much trepidation ascended the marble steps, and rung at the door. It was immediately opened by a servant in livery, and as she was handing him her card to take in to his master, a voice from the back part of the hall cried out:</p> 
               <p>"Bless my soul, Miss Wilde, is that you? If I had only known that you came to the city to see my uncle, I could have brought you here at once, in place of letting old Rad bear you off in triumph to that frumpy old boarding-house of his sister's."</p> 
               <p>While uttering this voluble address, young Heath came forward, and Bessie grew scarlet, and then pale, as she recognized him. She faintly said:</p> 
               <p>"I-I have some business with a Mr. Allen, but I am not quite sure that your uncle is the gentleman I am in search of. When I see him, I shall soon be able to ascertain."</p> 
               <p>"My uncle will be most happy to serve you in any way, I am sure. Walk into this room, and sit down, while I go to him and tell him that Venus has come down to this lower world to make him a visit."</p> 
               <p>He ushered her into a spacious drawing-room, richly and tastefully furnished, and left her alone a few moments.</p> 
               <p>He presently came back with a cheerful air, and said:</p> 
               <p>"You are to come at once into my uncle's sanctum, Miss Wilde. He is an invalid, and rarely leaves one room. Here we are."</p> 
               <p>He threw back a folding-door, the upper part of which was of ground glass, and ushered the trembling girl into the presence of a white-haired man of delicate appearance and benevolent expression. He laid aside the morning paper, and regarded her with a look of interest, as his nephew said:</p> 
               <p>"This, sir, is Miss Wilde-the young lady I told you about last night. She tells me that she thinks she has some business with you, but is not quite sure whether you are the real Simon Pure or not."</p> 
               <p>"Pray be seated, Miss Wilde," said the bland voice of Mr. Allen; "and if I can be of any service to you, pray command me."</p> 
               <p>Heath left the room, and closed the door behind him. Bessie recovered from her momentary perturbation, and without betraying her agitation, said:</p> 
               <p>"I have come to you, sir, to inquire if you ever knew a person calling herself Margaret Wilde, from whom a<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6346-00000127"/> young child was taken, and adopted by a Mr. George Allen, of this city, many years ago."</p> 
               <p>Without a moment's hesitation, Mr. Allen replied:</p> 
               <p>"I have certainly never known Mrs. Wilde, nor, to my knowledge, ever heard of her before."</p> 
               <p>She grew very pale, as she exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, sir, I hoped you might prove to be the person I seek, though he is known to me only as Mr. George Allen, and you have a middle letter in your name. I <emph>must</emph> find the one I came hither to seek, and if you can help me I shall ever thank you. The gentleman I refer to lived on Fifth Avenue eighteen years ago; he was childless, and an infant was given to his wife under particular and most painful circumstances. The family of that child are now most anxious to reclaim her; by a singular chance, the clue to her whereabouts came into my possession, and circumstances I cannot explain compel me to follow it up."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Allen listened with evident interest, and after a pause he said:</p> 
               <p>"It is a singular story, and you are a young detective to set out on such an errand. But I think your visit to me will not be altogether useless. At the time you mention a distant cousin of mine lived on Fifth Avenue, and his name was simply George Allen. I have a faint recollection that his first wife adopted a little girl, but I am under the impression that she died when she was quite young-in fact, only a short time after the death of her protectress. My cousin George married again, and has quite a houseful of children of his own; he is now living on the Hudson, above this place, and it will be easy to communicate with him by letter."</p> 
               <p>Bessie listened with breathless interest, and she eagerly said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh! I thank you so much, sir-so much for this information mation. Will you be so kind as to give me Mr. Allen's address?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly-but I am sure you will only hear the confirmation of what I have told you. Now that I recall the circumstances, I distinctly remember that my cousin's adopted daughter died in Europe, while he was travelling with his first wife for the benefit of her health."</p> 
               <p>"Give me the address, if you please, even if I should have no occasion to use it."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Allen drew a sheet of paper toward him, and with a pencil wrote-"George Allen, Beaconfield, near West Point; his post office there."</p> 
               <p>"This is all I can do for you, Miss Wilde, but my nephew, George Heath, is an active, bright young fellow, and he will take pleasure in finding out for you something about the child you refer to. In fact, he may be able to tell you a great deal about her, for he visited Beaconfield not long ago."</p> 
               <p>He rang the bell, and sent a message to his nephew desiring his presence, but when Heath came he could throw little light on the subject. He only knew that no other young person was in the house with Mr. Allen's own children, and they all claimed his present wife as their mother.</p> 
               <p>Bessie took her leave of the elder gentleman after gracefully thanking him, and went forth with the younger one by her side. It was agreed between them that he should write immediately to his kinsman, making the inquiry Bessie wished to have answered, and he left her at Mrs. Radway's door with the assurance that he would bring the reply of his kinsman to her as soon as it reached him.</p> 
               <p>Compelled to be contented with this, Bessie went in to find that dinner was over, but her landlady was considerate enough to send up to her a cup of tea and some cold viands, which she was very glad to get, for exercise in the frosty<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6346-00000128"/> air had given her a good appetite, in spite of the turmoil going on forever in her mind.</p> 
               <p>What the end was to be-what the consequences to herself and her mother, which were to flow from any discovery she might make, she dared not pause to inquire. A plain duty lay before her, and she felt that she must perform it, even at the risk of everything she valued in life.</p> 
               <p>A severe headache confined her to her room in the evening, and Mrs. Radway came up with her tea herself, seemingly not in the best of humors on account of the trouble she was giving her. She sharply said:</p> 
               <p>"You seem to be a most irregular person, Miss Wilde, for you haven't been at a single meal to-day. Since you are sick this evening, I must excuse you, I suppose, but I hope you will be more punctual in the future. My brother was anxious to see you to-night, for he has somehow got a crotchet in his brain that you're related to a young man we knew many years ago. Dear knows, I always heard that Frank Wilde's child died when she was a baby, but Miah all at once insists that you are his daughter."</p> 
               <p>The suddenness of this attack unnerved Bessie, and she became deadly pale as she asked:</p> 
               <p>"Why should Mr. Radway think such a thing as that? He spoke to me of Mr. Wilde before, but he did not hint that he believed I could be related to him in any way."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, he's got a new light on the subject, it seems. Captain Martin, who was an intimate friend of Mr. Wilde, has just come in from sea with a most curious story, which he means to prove by following up a fraud to which he has found a clue. There is a gentleman with him named Hunter, and they both declared that although poor Wilde was made to believe that his daughter died in her infancy, she is still living. Captain Martin says that he saw a miniature of her painted by a young friend of his last summer, and he knew her by her wonderful likeness to her father. He is on his way to Maryland now, to expose the woman who gave away a great heiress as her own child, and kept <emph>her</emph> daughter in her place. Have you ever heard of such a thing before Miss Wilde? Miah will have it that you are the child that was brought up to think yourself rich, when you were nobody but poor Frank Wilde's little one."</p> 
               <p>While Mrs. Radway thus spoke, Bessie felt her senses gradually receding from her, and at the close of her pitiless harangue she faintly gasped:</p> 
               <p>"They cannot be so cruel as to expose her," and fainted dead away, thus revealing to the hard woman before her that she had not only heard the story before, but was vitally interested in it.</p>

               <p>"IS she better?" asked the voice of Mr. Radway at the door of Bessie's room on the following morning. If Mrs. Wilde is calm enough now to see me, I shall be glad to come in and speak with her."</p> 
               <p>Bessie heard him, and a very different expression from that with which she had received his first advances toward an acquaintance, flashed into her face. With eager interest and expectation, she turned toward the door and said:</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I am quite well now, and strong enough to hear all that your brother has to communicate to me, Mrs. Radway. Pray let him come in."</p> 
               <p>Bessie was up and dressed, but she was pale and ill-looking, for she had passed a most wretched night after<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6346-00000129"/> the inconsiderate revelation made to her by her hostess. When she recovered sufficiently to think and act for herself, she insisted on seeing Mr. Radway immediately; but she was informed that, on hearing of her indisposition, he had again gone down town to join his friend at the Astor; so there was no resource but to wait till the next morning, though in the new dread that assailed her on her mother's account, Bessie, with a trembling hand, traced a few lines to Mr. Radway, and paid the servant who was sent up to wait on her a dollar to get them sent at once to the Astor House.</p> 
               <p>Her note contained the following words:</p> 
               <q>

                        <div type="letter"> 
                           <p>"MR. RADWAY-Through your sister I have learned your suspicions as to my indentity with the child of Mr. Frank Wilde, so long supposed dead, and also the hostile intentions of your friends toward my unfortunate mother. I write this to conjure them, through you, to pause until I can communicate with them. I <emph>am</emph> the daughter of Mr. Wilde, but until within a few days past I was not aware of the deception which had so long deprived the true heiress of the Ashley's of her birthright.</p> 
                           <p>"So soon as I became aware of the false position I occupy, I came hither to trace her and restore to her what I have innocently deprived her of. My poor mother is penitent, and she at last revealed to me the fraud she had practiced under a degree of temptation which forms some excuse for her conduct.</p> 
                           <p>"Captain Martin was once a friend to her. He owes a debt of gratitude to my grandfather, and from him I claim mercy and forbearance toward his erring daughter. When he learns under what painful circumstances the crime was committed, he will condemn her less. I entreat him, for my sake, to spare her as far as possible, and at least to wait till I have seen and talked with him myself.</p>

               </q> 
               <p>The note had been forwarded to its destination, and Mr. Radway was now waiting admission to its unhappy writer to inform her of the effect it had produced.</p> 
               <p>When he entered the room, Bessie smiled and held out her hand, as she said:</p> 
               <p>"Pardon me for the way I treated you when you first addressed me on the train. I had no idea then that I was thrusting away from me my father's friend."</p> 
               <p>"You are very excusable, my dear Miss Wilde, for I am aware that I am not a very attractive person at first sight; and-well, perhaps I do sometimes thrust my calling unreasonably on strangers; but it's my Master's work, you know, child, and I must do it while it is yet day. But I see you are impatient to know the result of your appeal to Captain Martin, and I will no longer keep you in suspense. He is yet in the city, and Mr. Hunter remains until he is ready to leave. I may as well tell you that they have decided not to go to Maryland till you are well enough to accompany them. They will both be here this evening to see you, if you think you will be able to receive them."</p> 
               <p>Bessie clasped her hands in thankfulness, and after a pause, said:</p> 
               <p>"I thank you for your intercession in my poor mother's favor more than words can express. I certainly will receive them this evening. And now tell me all that you know of my father, Mr. Radway, and how you came to take such interest in a stranger as to induce you to bring me to your sister's house."</p> 
               <p>"Well, as to the last, I overheard what you said to the conductor on the train, and I concluded you had run off from your home, or you would not have left your trunk behind you. That made me anxious to save you from some snare into which I was afraid you were rushing. But I had another motive, too, which I will explain.</p> 
               <p>"Several weeks ago I had a letter from Captain Martin,<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6346-00000130"/> dated from Liverpool, telling me that he wished me to go down to Maryland to the neighborhood of a place called Ashurst in the county you came from, and quietly make inquiries into the affairs of the Ashley family. After gathering all the information I could concerning them, I was to come back to New York in time to meet him on the arrival of his ship.</p> 
               <p>"I stopped at the Jolly Angler, which, you know, is only a few miles from Ashurst, and used my time to the best advantage. I learned some very curious gossip from the old woman that keeps the house, but it was chiefly about Mr. Leon Ashley, who lately came back to this country, and I could learn very little about the widow of the Judge and the young lady who lived with her.</p> 
               <p>"I had just taken my seat in the car when you came in, and as you were from the same part of the country, by securing you I thought I could learn something more about the people I was interested in. You know how badly we got along together; but I persevered till I succeeded in bringing you here, intending to question you about what I wished to know on the first opportunity that presented itself.</p> 
               <p>"Until you took your bonnet off after coming in, I did not suspect that you were related to Frank Wilde, but the moment I saw you fairly I said to myself:</p> 
               <p>"I don't believe Frank's daughter died at all, for this girl is his living image, and I begin to see now why Jack Martin sent me down to Maryland. He was just hunting his child up.'</p> 
               <p>"Full of this idea, I went down to the Astor to hear the strangest tale from Martin. I found with him a gentleman named Hunter, who many years ago employed Wilde's wife to go south as nurse to an infant whose mother had just died. <emph>That</emph> child was Judge Ashley's granddaughter, and the captain now insists that Mrs. Wilde made way with the heiress that she might put her own child in her place."</p> 
               <p>At this last statement Bessie became very much agitated. She cried:</p> 
               <p>"Surely the man who once knew and loved my mother, cannot really believe that she would do a greater wrong to the heiress than to deprive her of her birthright? He wrongs her cruelly by such a suspicion; for, badly as she acted, she believed she placed the child in as good a position as that of which she deprived her. The wife of a wealthy merchant in this city adopted the little girl, and pledged her word to rear her and provide for her as if she were her own. My purpose in coming hither as I have done, is to discover where Mr. Allen lives, and reveal to Miss Ashley her true name."</p> 
               <p>Radway stared at her in surprise.</p> 
               <p>"Was <emph>that</emph> what you ran away for? for I am sure you did run away. If so, I may spare my lectures, for you are already one of the elect. If a young girl like you could leave her luxurious home clandestinely to come on such an errand as this, she must always have a good angel near her. Did you realize that you must give place to the true Miss Ashley if she was found?"</p> 
               <p>"I beg that you will not praise me, sir, for what I did; for I could not have been honest and have acted otherwise. Miss Ashley is welcome to the estate I give up to her, and more than welcome to the father I was almost glad to learn was not my own. Since Mrs. Samson has told you of Mr. Ashley's doings, I need not hesitate to speak thus of him. The old lady is not apt to be sparing of her information on such topics as she is familiar with, and unhappily there is too much to be told that is not creditable to that gentleman."</p> 
               <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6346-00000131"/> 
               <p>The old man wiped the unctuous moisture from his face, and in a kind tone, replied:</p> 
               <p>"She did not spare him, certainly, and I know enough to understand your feelings on this subject. Miss Bessie, you are a precious lamb of the true flock, and are worthy to be the daughter of noble Frank Wilde, for he was one of nature's noblemen. I will now tell you all that I know of him, if you wish me to do so."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! do, Mr. Radway, for I am anxious to learn all that I can of my poor father."</p> 
               <p>After a pause, during which Mr. Radway seemed to be collecting his thoughts, he began:</p> 
               <p>"I never knew your father till after that fearful shipwreck in which he so nearly perished. He came back to this country, hoping to gain the insurance on his father-in-law's ship, but he never succeeded. He had married just before he sailed on his last voyage, and he learned on his return home that a daughter had been born to him during his absence, but all clue to both wife and child was lost. He traced them to this city, and it was then I made his acquaintance. Mrs. Radway has kept boarders in New York for the last twenty years, and Mr. Wilde was taken sick in her house. He sent for me to visit him. I found him a true-hearted Christian, and I formed a strong attachment to him.</p> 
               <p>"He recovered, but he still lingered here, hoping to find some trace of his lost treasures. One day he came back from a visit he had made to an old friend on a national ship that had just come into port; what Captain Martin then told him I never knew till last night.</p> 
               <p>"Poor Frank packed up his things with that white look of despair which only a death-blow to hope can bring to a man's face. Martin came to the house several times before Wilde left us, and they had long private conversations with each other.</p> 
                
               <p>"At last Martin told my sister and myself that Wilde's wife and child were both dead; that he had made the discovery himself, and brought him the news. That accounted for his state, poor fellow; and although we pitied him with our whole hearts, he would not listen to any attempt at consolation even from me.</p> 
               <p>"He went away to England on another voyage after this, and was absent several years; but he came back to us to die, and we took the best care of him during his illness, and sent to its destination the letter he left with us for Mrs. Margaret Wilde Ashley, as soon as the funeral was over. I wondered then who she could be, but I never for one moment suspected that she was the wife poor Frank had broken his heart about, when she had been so faithless as to marry another man before she was sure that he had really perished. This is all I have to tell you concerning as good and true a man as any girl may be proud to claim for her father."</p> 
               <p>Tears were raining down Bessie's cheeks; she held out her hand and faltered:</p> 
               <p>"How shall I thank you, sir, for your kindness to him and to myself. I have still another favor to ask of you; bring hither the two gentlemen who are here to expose my mother, that I may endeavor to turn them from their purpose. I must save her from what I am sure would kill her; and when they learn that she has voluntarily confessed her wrong to me; that I have come hither to make such reparation as is now possible, they will surely have pity on her for my sake, if not for her own."</p> 
               <p>"My dear child, you need have no apprehensions on your mother's account. Captain Martin is inclined to be most lenient, and if you can furnish a clue to where Miss Ashley is to be found, I am certain that Mr. Hunter will not push matters to extremity."</p> 
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6346-00000132"/> 
               <p>"I can do that, for my mother furnished me with the name and address of the gentleman who adopted the infant. I came on here to learn if he is still living, and I have already seen a relative of Mr. Allen's and learned from him that a gentleman who lives on the Hudson above the city is probably the person I am in search of. His nephew has promised to write and gain the information I wish as soon as possible. This afternoon I shall probably hear something from Mr. Allen which will be satisfactory."</p> 
               <p>"Miss Wilde, I hardly know which to admire most-your noble resignation of fortune and station so soon as you learned that they are not legitimately your own, or the acuteness and nerve with which you have prosecuted your inquiries since you came to the city. Let me spare you all further trouble by writing down the address of Mr. Allen, and giving it to Mr. Hunter, whose business it now is to seek out his kinswoman's daughter, and see that justice is done to her."</p> 
               <p>Bessie gladly assented to this, and the address given her by Mr. Allen was transferred to him. She earnestly said:</p> 
               <p>"I hope Mr. Hunter will take no further steps in the affair till I hear from George Heath. The youth who was so attentive to me on the cars turns out to be a nephew of the gentleman to whom I first applied, and on going to his house I met him there. He has written to Mr. George Allen, who is also a relative of his, and I am sure he will bring the reply to his letter to me as soon as it reaches him."</p> 
               <p>"I think I can also answer for Mr. Hunter on that score. There seems to be no disposition on the part of either gentleman to be harsh toward your mother, and Captain Martin distinctly stated that he had strong reasons to protect her from the consequences of her crime on your account."</p> 
                
               <p>"I am very much obliged to him, I am sure; but I cannot imagine how or where he could have learned anything concerning me, except from the note I sent you last evening."</p> 
               <p>"Were you not at Niagara last summer, and did you not there make the acquaintance of a young artist?"</p> 
               <p>She blushed vividly as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"You refer to Mr. Delancey, I presume?"</p> 
               <p>"I do-you may remember that he was called to this city to visit a sick friend. That friend was Captain Martin. Mr. Delancey showed him a miniature of yourself he had painted from memory; Martin at once recognized the striking resemblance it bore to his old friend, Wilde; he had become aware of your mother's second marriage, and as soon as he heard the name of Ashley as belonging to you he understood at once the fraud which had been perpetrated:</p> 
               <p>"Did he-did he betray his suspicions to Mr. Delancey?" she faltered.</p> 
               <p>"He may have done so-I did not inquire into that; I was too deeply interested in the remainder of his story. Martin was too ill to follow up his discovery at that time, and when he had recovered sufficiently to do so he was ordered to take command of his ship. But he wrote to Mrs. Ashley, and as the price of his forbearance toward herself he demanded that she should restore the heiress of the Ashley's to her true position, and give her consent to the marriage of her own daughter with young Delancey. No reply came, and he went on his way determined to unmask her on his return.</p> 
               <p>"Captain Martin was detained in Liverpool by some necessary repairs to his ship, and he seized the opportunity to run over to Paris in search of Hunter, whom he had accidentally met many years before; at that time he learned<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6346-00000133"/> from him that Mrs. Wilde had been employed by him as nurse to Judge Ashley's granddaughter. Martin knew that Hunter lived chiefly at Paris and Baden, and as the season at the latter place was over, he hoped to find him in the city.</p> 
               <p>"After some trouble he came up with him sure enough, and when Hunter heard what he had to tell him he determined to return to this country with him, find his young relation and restore her to her family. The ship arrived yesterday morning, and the note you sent to me last night delayed the journey they were about to undertake. They agreed to see you first, and decide afterward on their future proceedings."</p> 
               <p>"How thankful I am that I came hither," said Bessie. "By doing so I have saved my poor Minny from disgrace that would have been worse than death. Yes, Mr. Radway, I ran away from my home when I learned that I had no right there, but it was to find her to whom it really belongs and restore her to her own. Believe me, my mother has been more unfortunate than wicked; her adoring love for her own child induced her to make the exchange, and if she had been permitted to take both children with her to Ashurst, the crime had never been committed. I do not defend it, Mr. Radway, but I must use every effort to shield the perpetrator of it, and love her tenderly in spite of all."</p> 
               <p>"Your mother seems to have repented, my dear young lady, or she would never have confessed to you. You are quite right to stand by her, remembering that the repentant sinner is of more worth in the eyes of Omniscience than the ninety and nine just men. You look wearied now, and I will leave you to the repose you evidently need. This evening, if your headache does not return, I will bring my friends to visit you."</p> 
                
               <p>"Thank you; I shall be-I <emph>must</emph> be well enough to receive them when they come on such an errand as theirs."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Radway passed from the room and left her to reflect on the story he had related. How the intervening hours passed Bessie could scarcely have told. Her frame was weakened by the attack of the previous night, and her mind was a chaos of doubts and fears as to the result of the approaching interview.</p> 
               <p>Save her mother she must, at the cost of any humiliation to herself, and she inexpressibly dreaded the meeting with her accusers which must take place in a few hours. Even the certainty that one of them was the friend of her lover-that he had already endeavored to win her mother over to her union with Delancey, could not reassure her sinking heart.</p> 
               <p>In the letter Bessie had left with Kate Welby for her betrothed, she had revealed to him as much as she dared of her anomalous position, and freed him from all ties to herself. If Delancey ever sought her again, it must be as the daughter of a woman who had occupied a false position for so many years; who had made her the innocent sharer of the fraud, and Bessie, with an almost morbid sense of honor, felt that she could not blame him if he recoiled from allying himself with her under such humiliating and degrading circumstances. She had understood from Heath that he could get a reply from Mr. Allen by the afternoon mail, and she waited in intense suspense for his appearance. At five o'clock he sent up his card, and she went down to the parlor to receive him. With boyish glee he held up a letter and exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"You've hit the right nail on the head this time, Miss Wilde. My cousin George was the man, sure enough, but you can read, and see what he says for himself. I have not<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6346-00000134"/> a moment to stay now, but I will call in to-morrow and see you again."</p> 
               <p>Thankful to be left alone while she perused what was so important to her, Bessie hurried up to her own room in a tumult of feeling it would be impossible to depict, and after bolting herself in, sat down to read the important letter Heath had given her.</p> 
               <p>In the envelope with it was a discolored paper bearing a strange-looking seal, but scarcely glancing at it, she put it aside till she had read what so deeply concerned her. The letter ran thus:</p>

                              <dateline>"BEACONFIELD, November 24th, 18-.</dateline>
                           </opener> 
                           <p>"MY DEAR BOY:-Your letter, inquiring into events that happened long, long ago, came safely to hand, and I am happy to give you the information you seek. I have no reason to deny that I am the Mr. Allen your friend is in pursuit of, for I have done nothing that I consider reprehensible in the affair. Eighteen years ago my first wife, who was rich in her own right, took it in her head to adopt a child belonging to a respectable young woman whose name was Margaret Wilde. I indulged the whim of my poor Anna, for her health was too delicate for me to cross her in anything she had set her heart on.</p> 
                           <p>"Mrs. Allen became so fond of the infant, that when we set out on a tour to Europe, undertaken for her benefit, she insisted that the child should accompany us. I consented, as I always did to whatever she asked, though I felt assured in my own mind that my wife would never return to her own home alive.</p> 
                           <p>"To cut the story short, my poor angel died in Versailles. A woman named Jane Tompkins nursed her through her last illness, and at her suggestion I placed the little girl with a sister-in-law of hers, who took in children to nurse. She lived out on the road to St. cloud, and I left the child with Madame Tompkins, paying her charges for six months in advance.</p> 
                           <p>"I intended to console myself for the loss of my dear Anna by making an extensive tour, but before it was scarcely ly begun, my plans were set at naught by a summons from home which could not be neglected. The mercantile house in which the chief part of my wealth was invested was declared to be on the brink of failure, and there was no time to be lost in returning, if I would be in time to save my hardly earned fortune.</p> 
                           <p>"In the hurry and perplexity of my mind I <emph>forgot</emph> the child, but I meant at some future time to write and have her brought over to me, for as my lost wife had adopted her, I did not wish her to be thrown on the world after she was gone.</p> 
                           <p>"The next few years were spent in such a turmoil that I had no time to attend to anything but my own affairs. Just as I had come out of the wreck with half my fortune gone, I heard that the little girl I had left with Madame Tompkins was dead.</p> 
                           <p>"The priest of the parish in which she died sent me the enclosed notice, which you will see, certifies that in the year 18-, Ida Allen, daughter of George and Anna Allen, died in France, and was buried there.</p> 
                           <p>"I married again, as you know, have children of my own, and for years I have scarcely thought of the poor little waif Anna adopted. Since she has friends to claim her, I am sorry Ida did not live to become a solace to them. She was a charming child, and would undoubtedly have developed into a lovely woman.</p>

               <p>Bessie breathed a sigh of relief as she lifted the certificate, and glanced over it.</p> 
               <p>"So, she is dead," she murmured, "and Minny will escape exposure. Mr. Hunter cannot be so cruel as to persecute her when no good can come of it."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">HUNTER FINDS ANOTHER CLUE.</head> 
               <p>BESSIE calmed her emotions as far as was possible in the prospect of the agitating interview that awaited her.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Radway, at the request of her brother, sent up her tea, and managed to keep the back parlor clear of her other boarders till the expected visitors arrived.</p> 
               <p>Bessie went down to receive them with great inward tremor, but she grasped the letter of Mr. Allen in her hand as the warrant of her mother's safety, and nerved her heart for the meeting she dreaded so much.</p> 
               <p>When she entered the room, Captain Martin stepped forward to meet her, and taking her hand in his own, impulsively said:</p> 
               <p>"I require no introduction to the daughter of Frank Wilde, nor yet to her who claims Margaret Brandon as her mother. Reassure yourself, my dear Miss Wilde, for we have come hither with only the most friendly intentions. Both Mr. Hunter and myself earnestly desire to screen your mother, as far as possible, from the consequences of what she has done."</p> 
               <p>"How shall I thank you for your forbearance?" murmured the overwrought girl, bursting in tears. "Here, Mr. Hunter, is a letter concerning your young relative which was brought to me this evening. It will inform you that all interference on her behalf is now useless."</p> 
                
               <p>Hunter took the paper from her trembling hand, and after placing her in a chair near the fire, he retired toward the gaslight to read the letter she had given him.</p> 
               <p>While he was thus occupied, Captain Martin seated himself beside Bessie, and said everything he could think of to console and sustain the poor girl, toward whom his heart warmed, not only as the daughter of his early friend, but as the betrothed of one he loved as sincerely as he did Delancey.</p> 
               <p>She presently wiped away her tears, stifled her agitation, and tried to believe that all would yet be well.</p> 
               <p>Hunter read over the certificate twice, after perusing Mr. Allen's letter, and stood many moments absorbed in thought before he remembered her who awaited his decision in such painful suspense. When he at length turned toward her, she was at a loss to interpret the singular expression his face wore. He took her hand in his own, and vaguely spoke:</p> 
               <p>"Pardon me the pain I have unintentionally given you, my dear Miss Wilde. I remember your mother as a most fascinating creature, in spite of the cloud that rested over her at the time I made her acquaintance. I was scarcely surprised when I heard that her employer had made her his wife, for so fair a temptation is rarely thrown in a man's way. This paper assures me that I can spare her, and I rejoice that it is so, for I have every inclination to be lenient toward her for the sake of the daughter who so promptly endeavored to repair the wrong inflicted by her mother as soon as it became known to her."</p> 
               <p>"How shall I thank you for such kindness? all words fail me in such a crisis as this, Mr. Hunter," said the excited girl. "But oh, believe that at the last my poor mother clung to her own child with such passionate fondness, that she <emph>could not</emph> give her up, and in a moment of dire temptation<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6346-00000136"/> she committed the wrong for which, I am sure, she has bitterly repented."</p> 
               <p>"I trust so, Miss Wilde, and your presence here on such an errand as brought you hither, at least assures me that you had no part in the deception which has been so long successfully sustained. I will now, with your permission, explain to you the manner in which I was led to suspect that my cousin's child had never been received in the house of her grandfather."</p> 
               <p>Bessie bowed, and Hunter went on to state the confidences on this subject which, at long intervals, had been exchanged between himself and Captain Martin. She listened with absorbing interest, but her fluctuating color, and the tremulous motion of her lips, showed him that she was suffering from extreme agitation. When the recital was ended, he arose, and courteously said:</p> 
               <p>"You will need a good night's rest, Miss Wilde, to prepare you for your journey back to Maryland, which Captain Martin and myself wish you to undertake to-morrow in company with us, if you are strong enough to do so. I must see Mr. Leon Ashley before I return to Europe, and my friend is equally desirous of having an interview with your mother."</p> 
               <p>"I shall hold myself in readiness, sir; and I am very thankful that the wild chase I undertook in an hour of extreme excitement, has met with so speedy and satisfactory a conclusion."</p> 
               <p>"The end is not yet," thought Hunter; but he said nothing more; and Captain Martin took leave of Bessie with the assurance that in the meeting he sought with her mother he had no intention of reproaching her with what she had done, but simply to use such power over her as he possessed to serve the cause of a young friend of his who should be nameless.</p> 
                
               <p>At this evident allusion to Delancey the quick blood leaped to her cheek, and her dewy eyes were for an instant raised to his with an expression of gratitude which repaid him for the forbearance he had exercised through his great desire to spare her pain.</p> 
               <p>When the two friends gained the street, Martin said to his companion:</p> 
               <p>"Is she not charming? If her mother had even been more guilty, I should have been inclined to spare her not only for the sake of her noble child, but for that of the youngster who loves her."</p> 
               <p>"She is indeed very lovely," replied Hunter, still speaking as one in a dream. "I have seldom seen a fairer woman. What a singular complication. Strange-strange!"</p> 
               <p>Martin turned toward him, and looked curiously in his face.</p> 
               <p>"What is so strange? I am curious to know."</p> 
               <p>"Martin, I hold the clue to a most singular drama, nearly all the complications of which arise from the conduct of one unprincipled man, whose baseness I will expose before I rest. Tell me one thing: "Is not the young Delancey of whom I have heard you speak the next heir to the Arden estate in failure of a child of Leon Ashley's second wife?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes. His father was cousin-german to Grace Arden, and bore the same name; but he took that of Delancey to gain a small estate left him by a maternal uncle on those terms. But poor Ernest will never be benefited by his heirship, for Mrs. Ashley left a daughter, who now lives with her father at Arden Place. I am told that she is very charming. Young Wentworth fell in love with her when they met in Europe last summer, but her wretch of a father declares she shall never marry him."</p> 
               <p>"I know this young man. I met with him at Baden<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6346-00000137"/> last summer; and I am also aware that he and Evelyn Ashley are attached to each other. But I am <emph>certain</emph> that she is not the daughter of Leon Ashley's second wife, though he has imposed her on the world as such that he might retain possession of the Arden estate."</p> 
               <p>Martin dropped his arm, and stared at him as if he was doubtful of his sanity; but Hunter calmly proceeded with his explanation:</p> 
               <p>"I will give you my grounds for this belief as briefly as possible: This fall I had a severe attack of illness in Paris, and I called in a physician who had many years ago attened the family of Leon Ashley. Wishing to make himself agreeable to me, Dr. Ledru talked to me of my countrymen whom he had known. Among them he spoke of Ashley, whose name, for many reasons, possessed vivid interest for me. I led him to talk on about him, and Ledru described the illness of the infant daughter on whose life such important interests hung. The doctor declared that he believed no skill could save her when he advised her removal from Paris as her only chance. Yet a miracle was performed in her favor, for after an absence of two years, Ashley came back to Paris, bringing with him the little girl in perfect health, and as vigorous as if she had never known an hour's sickness.</p> 
               <p>"Ledru went on to add, that after such a resurrection as that he had recommended Madame Tompkins's house, and the air of the country around St. Cloud, as the most salubrious he knew anything of, for it had brought life out of apparent death."</p> 
               <p>"Well, what does that lead to?" asked the puzzled captain.</p> 
               <p>"I will soon show you. This certificate proves that a child was buried from the house of the woman named; the date proves that it was the same year in which Ashley's child was supposed to be in extremity; he went thither, no doubt, at the instigation of the woman's sister, Jane Tompkins, who was the child's sick-nurse, and found there the little girl abandoned by George Allen. She was, doubtless, substituted for the deceased one, and, by the Providence of God, the daughter of my cousin Eva fell into the hands of her own father, and <emph>she</emph> is the young girl Bessie Wilde came hither to seek. I shall seek such evidence as will confirm my conjectures; and it is my purpose to go to Maryland, charge Ashley with this crime, and, if possible, force a confession from him."</p> 
               <p>"Good Heavens, what a villain he must be! From what Radway gathered down in Maryland, Ashley is the terror of his whole family; and the young girl of whom you speak is treated by him with a degree of brutal harshness that is shameful."</p> 
               <p>"I shall take measures to deliver her from that," said Hunter, decisively. "I am convinced in my own mind that this young lady is my cousin, and I shall protect her from her father's wrath in future by forcing him to give her to the man she loves."</p> 
               <p>"I only hope you will succeed."</p> 
               <p>They walked some distance in silence, when Hunter said:</p> 
               <p>"What a singular man Mr. Radway is."</p> 
               <p>Martin smiled, and replied:</p> 
               <p>"He always was an eccentric. He was educated for the ministry, and I believe was ordained; but owing to his ungainliness, and his lack of oratorical skill, he never could please an audience sufficiently to obtain a permanent location. He gave up his vocation in disgust, and has since roamed about the world, admonishing all that fall in his way, and often doing deeds of mercy which prove how good a man he is. Rad is true as steel, and would stand by a friend to the last."</p> 
               <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6346-00000138"/> 
               <p>"Then I must respect him in spite of his repulsiveness; but here we are at the Astor."</p> 
               <p>When the two friends entered the brilliantly-lighted public room, Hunter walked straight forward to the gentleman's parlor, too much absorbed in his own thoughts to notice what was passing around him. But Captain Martin paused to give a second look to a young man of pleasing appearance, who was looking over the register with a most anxious expression.</p> 
               <p>He called the clerk to his side, and made several inquiries in a low tone, but the replies given seemed only to deepen the cloud upon his brow. With a sigh he turned away and said:</p> 
               <p>"I am worn out with my unsuccessful quest, and I must have a good night's rest before resuming it. I will take a room here, and retire at once."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, sir; better do that, I should say, and to-morrow be fresh for your work. Here, Jo, show this gentleman to No.-. Want a fire lighted, sir?"</p> 
               <p>"No, not to-night; I shall be asleep in ten minutes;" and he walked off, attended by the waiter.</p> 
               <p>Martin listened with vivid interest to this colloquy, for it struck him that he had an interest in finding out who the young stranger was. As he disappeared, the captain turned to the clerk and asked:</p> 
               <p>"What is the matter with that young chap? He looks dreadfully worried about something."</p> 
               <p>The clerk smiled knowingly as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"He is looking for a young girl who has left her home clandestinely. He was mighty close as to her name, and would examine the register himself, after inquiring if a young lady came here alone two days ago."</p> 
               <p>"Can you point the gentleman's name out to me on the register?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Certainly, for I have just placed the number of his room opposite it. Here it is."</p> 
               <p>Captain Martin glanced at the page, read Frank Wentworth, Maryland, and exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Bless my soul, I thought so. Hunter-where is the gentleman that came in with me?"</p> 
               <p>"In the next room, I believe, sir."</p> 
               <p>Martin dashed into the apartment indicated, found Hunter near the entrance, and after exchanging a rapid whisper with him, the two returned to the public room just as Jo came back from showing Mr. Wentworth to his chamber.</p> 
               <p>The two gentlemen sent up their cards, with a request to see Mr. Wentworth on important business, and closely followed on the steps of their messenger. They paused in the corridor while the man went in, and in a few moments Frank came out, in the act of putting on his coat again.</p> 
               <p>On seeing the strangers advance toward him he said:</p> 
               <p>"Excuse me, gentlemen, I was not aware that you had come up to my room, or I should at once have invited you in. Pray come in, and if, as I hope, you have anything to tell me of the person I came hither to seek, I entreat that you will relieve my anxiety on her account at once.</p> 
               <p>"We can assure you of her safety, replied Hunter, stepping forward; we have so much to tell you that you had better come to my room, where we shall find a good fire. Do you not remember me, Mr. Wentworth? I did not observe you when I came in to-night, or I should have recognized you at once."</p> 
               <p>Frank glanced keenly at him, and said:</p> 
               <p>"I recollect you now, sir; you are the gentleman I met at Baden last summer, under rather peculiar circumstances. Pardon me, Mr. Hunter, for not at once recognizing you, but I have seen so many strangers within the last year,<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6346-00000139"/> that I have grown careless about remarking faces. I am quite ready to accompany you where you can give me such information as will lead me to the person I seek."</p> 
               <p>The three walked down the corridor till Hunter came to the door of his own apartment. A bright fire was burning in the grate, and the gas was lighted. The door was no sooner closed on them than Wentworth impetuously asked:</p> 
               <p>"Can you indeed tell me where shall I find a young girl who has assumed the name of Wilde? Bessie Ashley is her true name, and she is my cousin. I have come hither to find and carry her back to her home."</p> 
               <p>"I am glad that we can relieve your anxiety concerning this young lady, Mr. Wentworth. Captain Martin and myself have just come from an interview with her, and I assure you we left her in the hands of those who will take the best care of her. I may as well tell you that the business which brought her hither is nearly settled, and to-morrow she has consented to return to Maryland under the escort of Martin and myself, to which I presume yours will now be added."</p> 
               <p>Wentworth looked perplexed; he said:</p> 
               <p>"I am at a loss to know what could have taken Bessie away in such a manner. I feared that she had fled from her home to escape the persecutions of her friends on my account, but <emph>you</emph> know, Mr. Hunter, that my affections are elsewhere bestowed, and I thought Bessie understood that I would never permit my uncle to carry his despotic authority to the extremity he threatened."</p> 
               <p>"I do not think that any such fear prompted Miss Wilde's flight. Pray be seated, Mr. Wentworth, for I have a long story to tell you, to which you must patiently listen. You will learn much that will astonish and, perhaps, displease you; but the end will prove to you that the hand you really covet may yet be yours. But first tell me how long you have been in New York."</p> 
               <p>"I followed Bessie on the first northward train after her evasion was discovered; and since my arrival in this place, I have spent my time in going from one hotel to another, hoping to find some trace of her."</p> 
               <p>"You failed in doing so because she found a friend on the train who took her to a private boarding-house kept by his sister. We left her at Mrs. Radway's not more than an hour ago, and she has promised to return with us to Maryland to-morrow, as I have already told you."</p> 
               <p>"I am glad to hear that she is safe; and now, if you please, I will hear the mystery you hint at made clear."</p> 
               <p>"Of course. Dispose yourself to listen quietly, while I explain to you how we came to know anything of Miss Wilde."</p> 
               <p>Wentworth shaded his face with his hand, and with many varied emotions hearkened to the long story which the narrator endeavored to abridge as much as possible. He could scarcely bring himself to believe that Mrs. Ashley had really committed so daring a fraud and had sustained it so successfully for so long a series of years.</p> 
               <p>Wentworth now comprehended her anxiety to force himself and Bessie into an uncongenial marriage; he understood her motives for the kindness which had brought him to his grandfather's notice and eventually made him an equal sharer in his estate, provided he made Bessie his wife.</p> 
               <p>Hunter felt tempted to reveal to him what he suspected with reference to Evelyn, but until he had seen Ashley himself, and brought home to him such proofs as he trusted would wring a confession from him, he thought it best to refrain from accusing him.</p> 
               <p>At the close of his narration Frank said:</p> 
               <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6346-00000140"/> 
               <p>"It is a sad story, sir, and I must pity Minny almost as much as I blame her. I have often wondered at her passionate devotion to Bessie, but this revelation explains it all. Since the true Miss Ashley is dead, you will do nothing against her, Mr. Hunter?"</p> 
               <p>"I have already pledged my word to Mrs. Ashley's daughter to be as lenient toward her as possible. My business in Maryland is with her step-son, and not with her. I have obtained a hold over him which may enable me to serve you, and the pretty gypsy I saw with you at Baden last summer, and you may feel assured that I shall use it in your favor."</p> 
               <p>"I heartily thank you, sir; if you can help me in any manner to remove Evelyn from my uncle's tyranny, I shall think you the best friend either of us has ever had."</p> 
               <p>"We will see what can be done when we reach the end of our journey."</p> 
               <p>Frank arose, and shaking hands with both of his new friends, said:</p> 
               <p>"That reminds me that I must sleep a few hours before setting out, for I have scarcely rested a moment since I learned of Bessie's flight. In spite of the exciting narrative I have just heard, I shall sleep soundly to-night, for I am worn out both physically and mentally."</p> 
               <p>The two gentlemen he left remained long in consultation together, but they finally sought their pillows after settling the course of action which they believed would be most effective in their campaign against Leon Ashley.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE RETURN TO ASHURST.</head> 
               <p>ON the following morning Frank was conducted to the presence of Bessie. She was scarcely surprised to see him, for she had felt certain that her mother would send him in pursuit of her as soon as her flight was discovered.</p> 
               <p>Before going to Mrs. Radway's, Wentworth dispatched two telegrams-one to Ashurst and the other to the Oaks, where he knew Delancey to be by this time. The one to Mrs. Ashley informed her of Bessie's safety and immediate return; the other was sent in Captain Martin's name, warning Delancey of his arrival, and his speedy advent at the Oaks, as he meant to trespass on the hospitality of his friends there for a few hours, until he could make an important communication to him.</p> 
               <p>Bessie took leave of the Reverend Jeremiah and his sister with many thanks for their kindness to her. At the moment of parting, Radway solemnly placed his hand upon her head, gave her his blessing, and pronounced her one of that "angelic aristocracy" who are sure of Heaven. George Heath also called in the course of the morning, and was quite delighted to find that his fair friend had an escort back to her own home, though he insisted that the time spent in New York was too brief to enable her to enjoy anything.</p> 
               <p>They parted with mutual good wishes, and in a few<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6346-00000141"/> moments afterward the carriage which was to take her to the dpt drove to the door.</p> 
               <p>On their way home, Frank and Bessie agreed that it would be best to leave Mr. Hunter and Captain Martin to make known to Ashley the painful facts they had lately learned, for they felt assured that from their lips they would meet with no credence from him. Hopeful, though saddened, the two journeyed on till they were safely set down on the platform of the station from which Bessie had so mysteriously fled less than a week before.</p> 
               <p>The carriage from Ashurst was awaiting their arrival and near it stood a chaise containing a single gentleman, who had driven up just as the train stopped. The moon was shining with cloudless brilliancy, and Captain Martin recognized Delancey as he stepped from the vehicle and threw the reins to a lad standing near.</p> 
               <p>Bessie had also seen him, and she drew her veil more closely over her face, while Captain Martin sprang down the steps to greet him. It was a chilly night, and after the train whirled away, the carriage drew up as near the steps as possible for Bessie to enter it. As soon as Delancey caught a glimpse of Bessie's figure, he started forward and asked:</p> 
               <p>"Who is the lady that accompanies you? I believe that is the carriage from Ashurst, but it cannot be Bessie."</p> 
               <p>"You are mistaken, my dear boy, for it <emph>is</emph> Bessie, returned safe and sound-but I am afraid that she is in some doubt as to the sentiments of a certain young gentleman since she has informed him that she is not really Miss Ashley-"</p> 
               <p>"Then she has taken you into her confidence-but how can she believe that anything can change me?" he rapidly asked. "It is her own sweet self I seek, and it matters not to me what her name may be. I will follow your advice, and take her from the evil to come; I will console her for her present sufferings by lavishing on her the entire wealth of my heart. Unluckily <emph>that</emph> is all the wealth I shall have to endow her with."</p> 
               <p>"How do you know that, youngster? But never mind; speak to Bessie now, and by a word assure her that you are true as steel, and not to be classed among those summer friends who fall away from one at the first touch of adversity."</p> 
               <p>This conversation had been carried on in low and rapid tones, and Delancey, at its close, strode forward, drew Bessie's arm under his own as though he possessed the undisputed right to do so, and gently said:</p> 
               <p>"We have met again, Bessie, after a long and weary separation, and in this first moment of reunion I claim you for a brief season. You will give Captain Martin your seat in the carriage, and ride with me to the point from which the road to the Oaks diverges from that which takes you to Ashurst. I have much to say to you that cannot well be delayed. I received your letter only this morning, and if my old friend's dispatch had not arrived before the next northern train was due, I should have been off in pursuit of you."</p> 
               <p>After a moment's hesitation she tremulously replied:</p> 
               <p>"If you will promise to keep up with the carriage there can be no impropriety in doing as you wish. We have much to say to each other, and, perhaps, some impediment may be thrown in the way of our early meeting to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>"'Take time by the forelock,' is my motto," said Delancey, laughing; "and now you have conceded this much, I feel sure of the rest."</p> 
               <p>Turning to Captain Martin, he went on.</p> 
               <p>"Explain to those gentlemen, if you please, why I take their fair companion from them for a season and impose you upon them in her place."</p> 
               <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6346-00000142"/> 
               <p>Bessie had been too much agitated by this unexpected meeting to think of the requirements of etiquette, and Captain Martin now performed the ceremony of introduction between Delancey and the other gentlemen. They shook hands very cordially, and Wentworth himself placed Bessie in the chaise, drew the leopard skin over her feet, and smilingly said to Delancey:</p> 
               <p>"I shall order Cato to drive more slowly than usual, that you two may have an opportunity to explain all the strange complications we have got to settle. It is three miles to the crossing, and in that time you should understand each other, if you ever will."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you-but there is a perfect understanding on the most important point at issue, Mr. Wentworth," replied Delancey, as he took the reins in his hand and with some difficulty held in his spirited steed till the carriage had started.</p> 
               <p>Bessie sat quiet, but thrilling with happiness, as the certainty dawned on her that disgraced as she considered herself, her lover had not for one moment thought of giving her up.</p> 
               <p>When they had fairly started, and Delancey had satisfied himself that she was thoroughly defended from the cold, he turned his head toward her and asked:</p> 
               <p>"Bessie, what did you mean by that strange letter you left with Miss Welby for me? How could you so mistrust me as to suppose that anything done by another could induce me to give you up."</p> 
               <p>Bessie murmured something in reply that was not very intelligible, and Delancey went on:</p> 
               <p>"I reached the Oaks this morning, and was stunned by the news of your disappearance from Ashurst. Kate hastened to get my letter, in the hope that its contents might throw some light on your motives for so strange a proceed ing; but its contents only added to my wretchedness and perplexity. Oh, Bessie, such a day as I have passed, I hope will never come to me again. How could you doubt me? how suppose that I would prove untrue to my heart's desire, because another had committed a wrong for which she now endeavors to atone? Such treason against true love is almost unpardonable."</p> 
               <p>"But you have forgiven me," she tearfully replied. "Oh, Ernest, I-I was so wretched-so crushed, when this thing first became known to me, that I could see no honorable course for me but to release you from your pledge. But I will confess the truth: I hoped and believed that you would not give me up, and that hope sustained me through the painful days I have spent in doing what I believe to be my sacred duty. Since you love me well enough to overlook this blot on my escutcheon, I again renew our old relations to each other."</p> 
               <p>"My precious darling," cried the enraptured lover, "I cannot thank you as I would, for if I slacken the rein of this confounded horse an instant he will run off, and perhaps break our necks. But you may count on several kisses for that sweet assurance when we stand on terra firma again."</p> 
               <p>"You need not excuse yourself for the non-performance of a feat like that," replied Bessie, demurely. "You had better not suffer your attention to be distracted from the horse, for he seems inclined to have his own head."</p> 
               <p>"Which, at this moment, is almost as good as mine," laughed Delancey, "for I am so happy I scarcely know how to hold him in hand. Bessie, I was so glad to hear that you are not the daughter of that odious tyrant, that I forgave everything else. <emph>Now</emph> Mr. Ashley has no authority over you, and he cannot withhold you from me. But half a mile is passed over, and you have not yet commenced<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6346-00000143"/> your explanation. Tell me what took you to New York, and how you made the acquaintance of Captain Martin, my true and fast friend."</p> 
               <p>Bessie knew that with her future husband perfect frankness was the rule by which she should guide herself, and painful as it was to her, she commenced with the avowal of her mother, and gave a clear though concise account of all she had done, together with her motives for the course she had pursued.</p> 
               <p>Her lover lavished praises and approval upon her, and declared that she had acted in the best manner possible under the painful circumstances of the case. He used his time to such good purpose, that before they reached the cross-roads, Delancey had won from his betrothed a promise to give him her hand before another month rolled away.</p> 
               <p>The carriage stopped at the appointed spot, and Delancey drew up in time to snatch a kiss from the lips of his companion before Captain Martin issued from the larger vehicle. Bessie took the place he had vacated, and bidding the two friends good-night, sank back upon the seat and gave up her heart to the blissful dreams she had hitherto feared to indulge.</p> 
               <p>After promising to be at Ashurst at an early hour on the following morning, Delancey turned his horse's head toward the Oaks, and hastened to confide his happiness to his old friend, who charmed him by his rapturous praises of the girl of his choice.</p> 
               <p>The carriage rolled on its way to Ashurst, and in a short time Bessie was again at the door of her old home; but no flying footsteps came to greet her now-no eager arms were opened to clasp her in their fond embrace.</p> 
               <p>Chilled and alarmed, she anxiously inquired for Mrs. Ashley, and the servant replied that his mistress had not risen from her bed since her own departure.</p> 
                
               <p>Leaving Wentworth to do the honors of the house to the strange guest, Bessie flitted up the staircase, and noiselessly entered the room of her mother.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley had fallen into a disturbed slumber, and by the subdued light in the apartment, Bessie could distinctly see the ravages the sufferings of her mind had made within the past week of her life. She lay before her, pale and wasted, with an expression of hopelessness around the colorless lips that went to the heart of her loving child; for the deep affection Bessie felt for her had cast out all reproach-all bitterness for the part she had played.</p> 
               <p>The young traveller at length threw off her wrappings and drew near the glowing fire to bask a few moments in its grateful warmth. While she stood looking down into the coals, musing on the best manner of communicating to her mother the news of which she was the bearer, a feeble voice reached her ear, asking:</p> 
               <p>"Is that my darling-my own Bessie?-or is it a delusive phantom, such as has often haunted my dreams since she left me?"</p> 
               <p>Bessie sprang toward the bed, threw herself upon her knees beside it, and cried:</p> 
               <p>"I am here again, safe and well, Minny, and I bring you good news-good news!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley passed her hand caressingly over the bright hair of her darling, and wistfully said:</p> 
               <p>"To see you back is happiness enough for the present, but no news can be good to me now, Bessie. The one hope of my life is broken, and I had better go to my grave before the disgrace of avowing what I have done overtakes me."</p> 
               <p>"But, mother dear, you need have no dread of that. Only to those nearest to you-to those interested in keeping your secret-need it be known; for she of whom I went in search of died in her infancy."</p> 
               <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6346-00000144"/> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley started up, with a red flush mounting to her cheek, and hurriedly exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Then the world need never know that I have rendered myself infamous. Oh, Bessie, you have proved my guardian angel, and you will complete the good work you have begun: you will marry Frank, and save my conscience from the sting of having induced the Judge to leave you so large a portion of his fortune."</p> 
               <p>Bessie arose and gently, though firmly, said:</p> 
               <p>"Mother, it is best that we understand each other at once. I shall never accept that money; neither will I give my hand to Frank. It is scarcely an hour since I pledged myself anew to Mr. Delancey, who knows my whole history, yet shrinks from neither you nor me. We have settled that we will be united in a few weeks, and take you to Italy with us. Ernest thinks that you should relinquish all you have derived from Judge Ashley's estate; and he insists that in so cheap a country as Italy, he will have quite enough to support us in as good style as we live in here."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley's face underwent many changes while her daughter thus spoke, and she faintly gasped:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Bessie, you betrayed me to your lover. You abased me in his eyes."</p> 
               <p>"Mother, what was left me but to tell him all? He is my lover-to be my husband in a few weeks, and I dared not deceive him. Besides, if I had not told him another would-had I not gone to New York as I did, Captain Martin and Mr. Hunter would have been here before this time to tell you this story in a less gentle manner than I have done. I will presently explain how I met with them, and disarmed their intentions against you."</p> 
               <p>At the mention of those two names, so deeply dreaded by her, Mrs. Ashley sunk back upon her pillows completely pletely unnerved. After a long and agitated pause she murmured:</p> 
               <p>"My sin has indeed found me out, and but for the goodness of my peerless child, God would have permitted its consequences to fall on me and crush me to the earth. Bessie, kneel down, and pray that my hard heart may be softened. I have so long lived in sin that I dare not pray for myself."</p> 
               <p>Humbly was the fair head bowed, and earnest was the petition that arose to heaven for the penitent woman; angels might have bent over the scene, and cast their blessings on the pure-hearted child who asked forgiveness for her erring parent.</p> 
               <p>When she arose, Mrs. Ashley clasped her hand and tremulously said:</p> 
               <p>"You have done me good, my darling; I can now give up the hope to which I have so tenaciously clung, and with it, the provision made for me by him who loved and trusted me in spite of the falsehoods I daily acted before him. Frank may take all, as a compensation for losing you, and I will do penance by consenting to be dependent on my unknown son-in-law. I give you to the noble man, Bessie who knows how to appreciate you, and who will save you from the blight my double treachery might have brought upon you. There, darling, I, in this hour, renounce the love of luxury which has been the bane of my life, and I will henceforth seek to walk in the straight and narrow path of perfect rectitude; my sin has been great, but my repentance shall be sincere and lasting."</p> 
               <p>Bessie took the beloved head in her arms, kissed the colorless lips, and mingled consolation and caresses till Mrs. Ashley became calmer; then, in low tones she related all that had occurred during her absence. Her mother listened with eager interest, and wept bitterly during the recital.<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6346-00000145"/> Bessie saw that some means must be used to tranquillize her, or she would sleep no more that night, and with the powerful magnetism with which nature had endowed her perfect organization, she passed her hands gently over the aching brow, and had the satisfaction of seeing the look of pain melt from the fair face, the sorrowful lips relax into a gentle smile, and the sweet blessing of sound sleep came to the weary eyes which had so bitterly wept over her flight-which had so eagerly watched for her return.</p> 
               <p>During this scene, Winny had been snoring in the dressing-room which opened from Mrs. Ashley's apartment, and when Bessie went in and aroused her, she seemed bewildered at finding her young lady so near her.</p> 
               <p>Bessie placed her finger on her lip, and made a motion toward her mother's bed, to impose silence on her, and the woman obeyed her whispered directions to follow her to her own room.</p> 
               <p>By the orders of her mother, a fire had been made, and everything arranged for her as usual, and the negress, with the garrulity of her race, seemed never tired of uttering exclamations at her unexpected journey and speedy return. But every effort she made to learn the cause was quietly evaded by her young lady, and after performing the services for which she had been summoned, Winny was dismissed no wiser than when she entered Bessie's apartment, though she left it with the impression that its occupant was gentler and more lovable than ever.</p> 
               <p>In spite of her fatigue, the thrilling excitement of all that had passed that night drove sleep from her pillow till nearly dawn. When slumber at last sealed her eyelids, a blissful vision of peace and happiness in that far land to which she had promised to go, arose before her dreaming fancy, where the sweet content of loving hearts made her home a paradise on earth.</p> 
                
               <p>Then a cloud came over the fair scene, and Ashley, with furious mien, came to tear her from Delancey. In the struggle she awoke, and found Winny looking down on her, and calling her name.</p> 
               <p>"It's time to git up, Miss Bessie, for Marse Frank have bin axin' arter you an hour ago, an' two strange gentlemen is come over from de Oaks, 'sides de one what stayed here las' night. He tole me to come up an' tell you."</p> 
               <p>"Is it so late as that? I must really have overslept myself. I hope that Frank and Mr. Hunter have had their breakfast?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes'm; Marse Frank said dey had business to attend to, an' dey mus' be ready to be off when de others come; but he wouldn't let me wake you den; he said you was tired out, an' had better sleep."</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry he did not have me called; but I shall not keep them long now. Ring for my breakfast to be brought up here; I must drink my coffee before I go down."</p> 
               <p>Bessie made a hurried, but very becoming toilet, dispatched her breakfast by taking a few morsels of toast, and swallowing the whole of the strong cup of coffee brought up to her, and she then flitted into her mother's room to warn her that Captain Martin was below, and he would probably insist on having an interview with her.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley shivered, and covered her face a few moments; at length she looked up, and tremulously said:</p> 
               <p>"I am too ill to be troubled with a visit from any one now; convince Captain Martin of this, Bessie, and entreat him to write what he has to say to me. You can convey my reply to him."</p> 
               <p>Bessie saw plainly that, in the shaken state of her nervous system, the excitement of meeting Martin might prove highly injurious, if not fatal to her, and she gently replied:</p> 
               <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6346-00000146"/> 
               <p>"When I tell Captain Martin how ill you are, I do not think he will insist on seeing you. I will explain to him how much such an interview must make you suffer, and I am sure he will consent to what you propose. I will go down at once, and repeat to him what you have said."</p> 
               <p>"Do, my darling; save me from this painful ordeal, and exacting as I feel inclined to be on this first day of your return, I will put aside my selfish desire to have you near me, and give you perfect freedom to enjoy the society of your lover."</p> 
               <p>Bessie leaned forward, and tenderly kissed her, as she murmured:</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, dearest and kindest. I accept the freedom you grant me, and will make the best use of it, I assure you."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Bessie, only save me from the cruel humiliation that threatens me in a meeting with this man! You are young and strong, and you can bear the burden I am selfish enough to put on you better than I can, with my shattered nerves, and the sense of utter degradation that overwhelms me. At moments I feel as if I can never survive it."</p> 
               <p>"You have repented the sin, dear mother; you would have atoned for it had it been in your power; and if God can forgive it, your fellow-creatures can at least overlook it. As for myself, my affection for you is as strong as it has ever been during any portion of my life, and Frank expresses the deepest sympathy for you. In the foreign land to which we are bound no one will be acquainted with your history, save the two who, through much love for you, will cast out all reproach, even in thought."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashley pressed her hand, burst in tears, and again covered her face. Bessie stood a few moments beside her, but finding that she would not again speak, she smoothed the faint cloud from her own brow, and descended to the library, in which the gentlemen were sitting.</p> 
               <p>Her appearance was greeted with pleasure, and the programme of the day was soon settled. Hunter, Martin and Frank were to go over in the carriage to Arden Place to gain an interview with its master; and Delancey was to await their return in the charming society of his betrothed.</p> 
               <p>Before they set out, Bessie drew the Captain aside, and explained to him the condition of her mother, the concessions she had already made, and her natural aversion to a meeting with himself.</p> 
               <p>To this he at once replied that he had no desire to force an interview on Mrs. Ashley which he knew must be bitterly painful to her. What he had to say to her could as well be written as spoken, and since her consent to the union of her daughter with Delancey had been given, he had no motive for desiring to meet her again.</p> 
               <p>The three gentlemen set out for Arden Place, and the long-parted lovers had the quiet library to themselves, with an uninterrupted morning in which to arrange their future plans.</p> 
               <p>It was definitely settled that in three weeks from that day they were to be united, and, accompanied by Mrs. Ashley, proceed at once to Baltimore to take a steamer for Europe.</p> 
               <p>Delancey explained to Bessie that his resources were derived from a small estate situated in New York, which descended to his father through a maternal uncle, who made the assumption of his own name a condition of the inheritance. He derived from it about twelve hundred dollars a year, which, in Italy, he declared would suffice for every comfort.</p> 
               <p>He went on, with a smile:</p> 
               <p>"If the estates my father at one time believed almost<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6346-00000147"/> within his grasp, had fallen to me, I should have resumed my family name on taking possession of them; but there is so little chance of that now, that I have not hitherto thought it worth mentioning to you."</p> 
               <p>"So, you had great expectations, too, it seems, which have never been realized. Pray tell me what name I might have borne had fortune been propitious to you."</p> 
               <p>"That of Arden. If Mr. Ashley's daughter had died, as at one time it was thought she certainly must, my father would have been heir-at-law to the estate, and there would have been no one to dispute his claim."</p> 
               <p>Bessie looked as much astonished as she felt, and she presently said:</p> 
               <p>"That explains Mr. Ashley's extreme anger when he heard of your pretensions to my hand. He then declared that of all the men in the world, you were the very last to whom he would consent to give me."</p> 
               <p>Delancey laughed.</p> 
               <p>"I do not know why I should be such a bugbear to him, for his daughter is likely to live as long as I shall. Thank Heaven, that he has no further control over you, Bessie, for such a man would be sure to abuse it. I pity the poor girl who is compelled to live under his tyrannical rule."</p> 
               <p>"Have you heard that Evelyn is a prisoner in an old dilapidated tower, that stands in the yard at Arden? Poor Frank made such concessions as obtained her release before I went away, but as soon as her father heard of my escapade, he shut her up again. Frank must find means to release her; he has been baffled once, but he will succeed the next time, I am sure."</p> 
               <p>"I trust he may, and win as great happiness as you and I have secured. I will help him with heart and hand to free my fair cousin, and make her his own."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">ANOTHER REVELATION.</head> 
               <p>FRANK had bought a small, beautifully mounted gun, together with a game-bag and shot-pouch, as a present for Maitland, and as the carriage drove through the grounds around Arden Place, he anxiously watched for the boy, intending to join him, and leave his two companions to seek the interview with Ashley, which they had intimated must be private.</p> 
               <p>Just before the windings of the road brought the house in sight, a whoop resounded through the woodland as wild and shrill as an Indian yell, and the next moment Maitland sprang from the shelter of a clump of young trees, crying out:</p> 
               <p>"Frank, Frank, is that you? Have you brought my gun, and is it a regular beauty?"</p> 
               <p>The carriage was stopped, and the young man stepped out with the coveted prize in his hand, after saying to his companions:</p> 
               <p>"I shall join you in time to return to Ashurst; at present, my appearance would only exasperate my uncle."</p> 
               <p>The vehicle drove on, and the ecstatic rapture of the lad in his new possessions for a few moments held Frank silent, but the impatience of the lover soon found words.</p> 
               <p>"There, my little man, that will do for the present; and now, if you really prize my gift so much, repay me for it<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6346-00000148"/> by telling me all about Evelyn. What has happened to her since I left?"</p> 
               <p>"Not much. You know she was sent back to her lockup, but I found a way to get to her and give her your note. I steal up to her door every day when nobody's about, and she seems to be in better spirits, though she is very anxious about your return. Yesterday she poked a letter under the door that she said I must give you the minute I saw you after you came back."</p> 
               <p>"Quick, quick-give it to me this instant."</p> 
               <p>Maitland thrust his hand in his pocket, and then said, with a crestfallen expression:</p> 
               <p>"I'm blessed if I don't believe I've lost it!"</p> 
               <p>"You careless little wretch! If you have, I will take the gun from you at once, and you shall not have it back for a month. Find that letter instantly, you unfaithful messenger."</p> 
               <p>In the prospect of losing his highly-prized gun, Maitland bestirred himself, and hastened to examine every pocket in his clothing, but without any satisfactory result. The letter was in none of them, and he lugubriously said:</p> 
               <p>"You won't take the little kill-deer from me, Frank; that would be too hard on a fellow. Besides, if you do, I'll never help you to another word with <emph>your</emph> dear, so there!"</p> 
               <p>Curbing his desire to take him in hand and administer a good shaking to him, Frank said:</p> 
               <p>"Where have you been since the letter came into your possession? You must have dropped it."</p> 
               <p>"I've been everywhere, for the pesky thing was given to me yesterday. Let me see-oh, yes, I remember now; I was afraid I might lose it, and I put it under the lining of my cap."</p> 
               <p>Frank snatched the battered, ill-used chapeau from his head, and nearly tore the lining out in his eager search for the promised missive.</p> 
               <p>Crushed and soiled, but still most precious, Frank at last drew it forth, and was turning away to read it in solitude, when Maitland said:</p> 
               <p>"The things are mine now, Frank, and I may do as I please with them?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes, you have bravely won them, but don't go far from me, and, above all, don't shoot any person with your new gun."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I'll stay here till you come back. I'll only load the pretty little shiner, but I promise not to fire till you show me how to manage it."</p> 
               <p>Satisfied with this assurance, Frank leaned against a large tree just out of sight of the lad, and hurriedly opened Evelyn's letter. It ran thus:</p>

                  <floatingText xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">

                        <div type="letter"> 
                           <p>"I have persuaded Maitland to bring me pencil and paper, that I may write to you what is so strange to myself, that if Jane had not again and again reiterated the story, I could not have given credence to it.</p> 
                           <p>"Frank, I am absolved from all duty to Mr. Ashley in a most extraordinary manner, for Jane most solemnly asseverates that <emph>he is not my father.</emph> This is the story she tells.</p> 
                           <p>"The daughter of Mr. Ashley's wife, who, you know, was the heiress of this estate, died in her infancy, and I was taken in her place from the house of Jane's sister, where I had been left to be taken care of.</p> 
                           <p>"From the account of my nurse, it seems that I had been adopted by an American lady who died in France; after that event, her husband placed me with Madame Tompkins, and never returned to claim me again.</p> 
                           <p>"It is singular that I should bear the Ashley mark upon my arm if I am not of that race; but I can no longer doubt that I have no claim on the name and fortune hitherto considered mine.</p> 
                           <p>Nameless, homeless, fortuneless, I do not expect you to<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6346-00000149"/> marry me now, Frank; but you must be my friend, and rescue me and the poor creature who is shut up with me from this dreadful captivity, and enable us to tell our story where it will be believed and acted on.</p> 
                           <p>"Come to me as soon as you can, or if that is impossible, send a reply by Maitland, that I may know what can be done.</p> 
                           <closer>
                              <signed>EVELYN."</signed>

               </q> 
               <p>Frank read these lines over and over in a state of complete bewilderment, but he could make nothing more out of them than the plain facts stated, and at length, thrusting them in his pocket and returning to Maitland, abruptly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Can you bring me within speech of Evelyn, youngster?"</p> 
               <p>The boy shook his head.</p> 
               <p>"If you will, I will give you the pony you liked so much at Ashurst."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, that will be as jolly as the gun! Let me see-old Hagar goes to the tower three times every day, but she ain't fond of staying there long, and I manage to get up between times. I <emph>might</emph> get you in speaking distance of Evy, if I wasn't afraid of after-claps. If the governor found me out, he'd be mad enough to shut me up, too, in some old dog-hole about the place, and you know that would kill me outright."</p> 
               <p>"If he shut's you up I will get you out, and take you to Ashurst to live with Evelyn and me after we are married."</p> 
               <p>"So that's the ticket is it? Well, you're a man of your word, Frank, and I don't mind risking something for you and Evy. We <emph>may</emph> get in without being seen, at all events, there's nothing like trying. Come on."</p> 
               <p>The tower stood at the northern angle of the building, and the family apartments were on the southern side. A thick shrubbery of evergreens grew close to its walls, and under their friendly cover Wentworth and his young companion gained the dilapidated structure without observation.</p> 
               <p>The key, as usual, stood in the outer door, and they made their way into the lower room in which was stowed away broken furniture, dilapidated spinning-wheels, and an old loom, which filled up nearly the whole space, leaving a narrow pathway on one side to the foot of the staircase.</p> 
               <p>The two intruders lightly ascended the creaking stairs, and when they reached the narrow platform at which they terminated, Maitland applied his mouth to the key-hole, and in a shrill whisper said:</p> 
               <p>"Come here, Evy; I've got something jolly to tell you, and so has somebody else."</p> 
               <p>In the next instant Evelyn's voice was heard speaking on the other side of the door:</p> 
               <p>"How did you get here at this hour, Maitland? and what have you to tell me? Oh! if any one should have seen you!"</p> 
               <p>"There's no danger of that, for nobody comes here but old Hagar, and she's hovering over the fire in her cabin this cold day. I say, Evy, don't you go and squall out, nor do anything else foolish if I tell you that I aint here by myself. Somebody else <emph>would</emph> come with me, and he's trying to push me away now that he may speak to you."</p> 
               <p>"Frank-dear Frank, are you indeed so near me!" she asked, in trembling tones.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Evelyn, darling, I am here in <foreign xml:lang="LAT">propria persona,</foreign> and I have come back to rescue you even at the risk of my life. Now, Maitland, if you will only go down and keep watch half an hour at the lower door that no one may surprise us, I will give you a saddle and bridle with your pony."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Frank, you're worth all the trumps in the pack,"<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6346-00000150"/> exclaimed the delighted lad, preparing to dash down the staircase. "If I see old Hagar coming, I'll give a whistle inside the door, and she's so lame, you'll have time enough to get down stairs and hide yourself among the traps there before she comes in. I'm in for it now, and I mean to see you and Evy out of this scrape."</p> 
               <p>When he was fairly gone, Wentworth spoke to his imprisoned love.</p> 
               <p>"I have read your letter, Evelyn, and I do not know what to make of it. Is Jane prepared to swear before a magistrate that you are not the daughter of my uncle?"</p> 
               <p>"She is, and anxious to do so; but-I do not wish her to proclaim what he did in such a manner as to injure him. Oh, Frank, in spite of all his harshness toward me, I have a tender feeling of regard for him, and I cannot willingly become the means of bringing punishment on the man I have been taught to regard as my father."</p> 
               <p>"My dear love, I expected nothing less from your tender heart. I also wish to save the name of my uncle from disgrace, but in what way are we to do this, Evelyn, unless we take our fate into our own hands and carry out our original intention to elope with the first opportunity? We will not wait for the train, but go at once to the magistrate across the line who will unite us in a few hours after we leave this place. Speak, my love, shall it not be so?"</p> 
               <p>"Dear Frank, have you reflected that I am now a nameless outcast, with little hope of ever discovering to whom I belong? Release me from this dreadful imprisonment, I entreat you; but beyond that I have no right to tax your generosity, nor can I consent to accept the sacrifice you would made for my sake."</p> 
               <p>"I shall make none, Evelyn, believe me. Bessie is betrothed to Delancey with the full consent of those most deeply interested in her, and I am consequently the heir of my grandfather. That codicil Minny produced I know is worthless, and the estate is mine. But it will be valueless to me unless you consent to share it with me. Do you think that I could see you cast upon the cold world, with no means of living-no shelter for yourself and the old woman who has been faithful to you from your infancy?"</p> 
               <p>Jane, who seemed to have drawn near the door, here broke in:</p> 
               <p>"You are very right, Mr. Wentworth, and my young lady is full of romantic notions that she'll soon find she must give up. You only find the way to get us out of this den, and I promise that she shall agree to whatever you think best, when the right time comes."</p> 
               <p>"That is talking sensibly, Jane, and I leave my cause in your hands. I shall lose no time in rescuing you, you may be sure. After nightfall I will come hither in a carriage, which I will conceal in the woodland. I will get here about the time the old woman comes with your supper, seize, gag and lock her up in your place. It will be easy enough then to effect our escape."</p> 
               <p>"I understand, Mr. Frank, and I am quite ready to go with my young lady. I am stronger than I have been, and I am sure I should be no hindrance to you."</p> 
               <p>"That is well. Do you consent to this arrangement, Evelyn? Remember, you owe nothing to Mr. Ashley, and to me you have plighted your troth."</p> 
               <p>"Speak the truth, Miss Evelyn, for you know your heart is with him," insisted Jane.</p> 
               <p>"Yes-I know-that-and-and-I suppose I must follow it. If you succeed in your plan, Frank, I shall be ready to go with you; but pray leave me now; I tremble every moment lest you may be discovered."</p> 
               <p>"Farewell then till night. Before another day dawns<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6346-00000151"/> I will rescue you and bear you away to happiness, my own precious one."</p> 
               <p>A shrill whistle sounded below, and Wentworth rushed down the stairs to encounter Maitland at the foot laughing in great glee.</p> 
               <p>"Time's up-thought you'd never come if I left you alone, so I whistled, but old Hage aint coming yet as I know of."</p> 
               <p>"I am too happy to scold you for giving Evelyn such a fright, and I was just leaving when you summoned me. Be sure and be silent as the dead about my visit to this place, Maitland."</p> 
               <p>"Do you think this child is a born idiot, Frank, to go and tell on himself what would be sure to bring him in a scrape? Oh no, I thank you, Mr. Emerald Green."</p> 
               <p>Wentworth smiled, and rewarded his sharpness by taking him into his confidence and enlisting him in his service for the evening.</p> 
               <p>"It's very well you told me about it," he replied, "for Hagar takes her grandson with her every night to watch at the door while she goes in; I can take care of him for you, so <emph>he</emph> sha'n't be in the way."</p> 
               <p>"So much the better; I shall rely on you."</p> 
               <p>They skirted the main building and separated before they came in sight of the entrance. When Wentworth entered he saw his aunt standing near the door of the room in which Mr. Ashley usually sat; her face was white and scared, and he at once comprehended that she had been listening to what was passing within.</p> 
               <p>She turned to him as she heard his step, and gasped:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Frank! something dreadful is going on in there. I heard Leon's voice raised to such a furious pitch that I ran in to him, but he ordered me out before those strangers, and commanded me not to come near him while his visitors stayed. What can it be-what can it be that excites him to such a degree!"</p> 
               <p>"I do not think those gentlemen had anything to tell my uncle that can seriously affect <emph>you,</emph> Aunt Augusta, so you may compose yourself on that score. I knew that the revelation they came to make concerning Bessie would excite my uncle fearfully, so I kept out of the way till it was made."</p> 
               <p>"What of Bessie? Has she returned home?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh yes-<emph>I</emph> brought her back last night. I cannot explain now, but Bessie has declared and gained her independence. Neither you nor Mr. Ashley will be troubled much more with her affairs."</p> 
               <p>Augusta looked bewildered, but at that moment the door near which they stood was thrown open with a crash, and Mr. Ashley came rushing out with unwonted speed for him; suddenly confronting his nephew, he turned his angry face toward him and cried out:</p> 
               <p>"So-o-<emph>you</emph> have come hither with the bearers of this pretty story, which I shall take pains to prove utterly false! Come in, sir, and tell me if <emph>you</emph> credit the infamy they would fix upon me."</p> 
               <p>As Wentworth stepped forward to enter the room, Augusta did the same; but he furiously turned on her:</p> 
               <p>"Go away, madam! What are you prowling around here for, I should like to know. Go back where you belong."</p> 
               <p>Without venturing to reply, his wife retreated at once, though she was evidently in a state of feverish excitement as to what was passing so near her.</p> 
               <p>So soon as Wentworth entered the apartment in which Hunter and Martin were, his uncle slammed the door violently behind him, and threw himself panting upon his chair.</p> 
               <pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6346-00000152"/> 
               <p>Hunter hastened to say:</p> 
               <p>"I have not yet revealed my convictions on this affair to your nephew, Mr. Ashley. I considered it but justice to you to refrain from doing so till I had gained a confirmation of them from yourself."</p> 
               <p>Ashley uttered a tremendous oath, and thundered:</p> 
               <p>"That confirmation you will never get from me, but you are welcome to tell him if you see fit to do so! Or perhaps you will permit <emph>me</emph> to state the case to him in my own way."</p> 
               <p>"If such is your wish, of course I consent," was the courteous reply.</p> 
               <p>With a sarcastic smile, Ashley turned to the expectant young man, and said:</p> 
               <p>"These gentlemen have kindly come hither to smooth away all obstacles, in the way of your union with your cousin Evelyn. In order to do that, they are prepared to show that she is not the heiress of Arden, but the daughter of my first wife. By what sort of hocus-pocus they expect to prove this, I am at a loss to imagine."</p> 
               <p>Frank looked from one to another in perplexity, and Hunter quietly said:</p> 
               <p>"It may cost me a journey to Europe to prove that the young girl known as Evelyn Ashley is the daughter of my cousin; but I shall make it as expeditiously as possible, seek out the woman with whom she was left, and return here with such proofs of the facts I have stated as must convince the most skeptical."</p> 
               <p>Ashley glared on him, and with a curling lip replied:</p> 
               <p>"Go, then, upon your fruitless errand. I deny the crime of which you would accuse me. Evelyn is the heiress to the Arden estate, and I shall maintain her right to her inheritance."</p> 
               <p>A new light began to dawn on Wentworth, and almost trembling with excitement, he turned to Hunter and said:</p> 
               <p>"For Heaven's sake, explain what you both mean; for I seem trembling on the verge of a discovery which is of the last importance to me."</p> 
               <p>Hunter rapidly gave him an outline of the facts, and the suspicions arising from them, which he had just laid before his uncle with so disappointing a result.</p> 
               <p>Combining these with what Evelyn's letter revealed to him, Frank had not a doubt in his own mind that she was the child referred to; but his experience of his uncle's violent and unreasonable temper had taught him caution in his dealings with him, and he resisted the first impulse to draw forth the letter and place it in Hunter's hands.</p> 
               <p>By thus conclusively proving what that gentleman sought to establish, he would again place Evelyn in the position she held before, and possibly cause her to shrink at the last moment from keeping her word to himself.</p> 
               <p>Frank also felt convinced that if Ashley became aware of what Evelyn knew with regard to herself, he would place her in more stringent confinement, and render it impossible for him to gain access to her.</p> 
               <p>He reflected a few moments, and then asked:</p> 
               <p>"Uncle, will it not be best to place my cousin Evelyn in her true position, and carry out the will of my grandfather by uniting the two heirs to his estate? Since Bessie is now out of the question as my wife, for she is betrothed to Delancey, the best thing you can do is to consent to give Evelyn to me."</p> 
               <p>While Wentworth thus spoke, the changes in Ashley's face were frightful, and the lookers on were apprehensive that he would fall down in a fit. Struggling to articulate, he shrieked:</p> 
               <p>"How dare you refer to that beggarly Delancey in my<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6346-00000153"/> presence? Regardless of truth, you three have come here to cajole me with the story you have so cleverly concocted among you. If you expect me to believe such trash you are greatly mistaken. Mrs. Ashley claims Bessie for <emph>her</emph> daughter, forsooth, that she may give her to the next heir to the Arden estate, when Evelyn's claims are once set aside. Then you come in, affecting to believe the tale so cleverly devised among you, and coolly ask me to confirm the will of my father by giving you the hand of the grandchild you assert to be his lawful heir. I-I'll see you both in the Inferno first!"</p> 
               <p>Having uttered this defiance, he threw himself back upon his chair, and poured out a glass of brandy, which of late he would have constantly on a table near him, and drank it off without diluting it with a drop of water.</p> 
               <p>The three gentlemen exchanged glances, and Hunter arose, as he said:</p> 
               <p>"I had a faint hope that this interview would end differently, Ashley. I recalled our early intimacy, and the recollection of some good impulses which as a young man you possessed, induced me to believe that all sense of justice and humanity were not dead within you. Your conduct this morning has convinced me of the contrary, and I now declare war to the knife against you. I will not only strip you of the wealth you illegally enjoy, but I will <emph>prove</emph> your villanous actions before the world, and men shall know all your baseness."</p> 
               <p>The black eyes of Ashley flashed a look of hatred and defiance upon the speaker, and he recklessly replied:</p> 
               <p>"Do your worst. By the time you get back from your Quixotic voyage, I shall be where all the accusations that can be brought against me will have no power to harm me, even if you could prove them; but that I defy you to do."</p> 
               <p>"We shall see," replied Hunter, bowing haughtily. "If you refer to your speedy appearance before a higher tribunal to answer for the deeds done in the flesh, I think the best preparation you can make for the great change will be to right the wrong you have been guilty of, when the power to do so is placed in your hands."</p> 
               <p>"I have often heard it said that the d-l can quote Scripture to serve his own purposes, and I see it now illustrated. I can dispense with any further lecturing from you, Mr. Hunter."</p> 
               <p>The visitors, finding that nothing was to be gained by prolonging the interview, moved toward the door. As Frank passed him, Ashley called out after him:</p> 
               <p>"I advise you not to show your face here again, Mr. Francis Wentworth. From this day you are to consider my doors closed against you. As to Evelyn, I will lay her in her grave sooner than give her to you for your wife."</p> 
               <p>Wentworth made no reply, but he congratulated himself on the prudence with which he had acted in withholding what he knew from his uncle. When they were again in the carriage and on the way to Ashurst, Captain Martin said:</p> 
               <p>"The hard-hearted obstinacy of that man is beyond belief; but no one will be troubled with his opposition long. Death is in his face now, and the deep draughts of liquid fire he constantly imbibes will take a very little while to do <emph>his</emph> business effectually."</p> 
               <p>"The sooner the better for all connected with him," replied Hunter; "for if death does not come to the rescue, Ashley's violence will compel me to bring public disgrace upon him. I once liked him-sought his company; but now I can feel only loathing and contempt toward him. It will be a long journey to Europe; but I will make it without delay, and return here to see justice done on such a miscreant as Ashley has proved himself in every relation of life."</p> 
               <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6346-00000154"/> 
               <p>Wentworth had by this time regained composure enough to reflect on the best course for him to pursue. He now spoke:</p> 
               <p>What will you say, Mr. Hunter, when I tell you that I have the proof you seek in my pocket now?-that so long a journey will be quite unnecessary."</p> 
               <p>His companions stared at him in surprise, and Hunter asked:</p> 
               <p>"Why, in Heaven's name, did you not produce it just now? We might then have dictated terms to Leon Ashley."</p> 
               <p>Frank shook his head.</p> 
               <p>"You do not know my uncle as well as I do, or you would be more wary than that. He never listens to anything that conflicts with his own arbitrary will, and if I had betrayed to him that I have opened a communication with Evelyn, he would have resorted to such severe measures with her that I should even have trembled for her safety. Besides, I do not wish her to suspect that she is really Mr. Ashley's daughter till her fate is beyond question, and she is bound irrevocably to me. She has such high ideas of duty, and in spite of his cruel treatment, so strong an attachment to my uncle, that she would be capable of refusing to go with me if it were proved to her that she stood in that relation to him."</p> 
               <p>"Then the young lady herself has made some discovery affecting her position? Excuse me, Mr. Wentworth, but I do not consider you very lucid in your explanations."</p> 
               <p>"My head is not as clear as it might be; the astounding revelations I have heard to-day have slightly bewildered it. But pray read this letter sent to me by Miss Ashley, and you will comprehend my meaning. Her nurse, Jane, can furnish all the evidence necessary to prove that Evelyn is the child left with her sister by Mr. Allen."</p> 
                
               <p>After glancing over the letter, Hunter passed it to Martin and said:</p> 
               <p>"I inquired for this woman, and asked to have her confronted with me this morning; but Ashley declared that she was in a dying condition, and had not spoken a rational word for weeks. I did not then insist on seeing her and judging of her condition myself, because I had no authority to do so; but I was resolved to return there with a warrant demanding the person of the woman, and ascertain what her condition actually is."</p> 
               <p>"We can manage better than that. Jane has been ill, I know, ever since she came to Arden, but since Evelyn has been shut up in the same room with her, her good nursing must have restored her, for she spoke to me to-day when I made my way to the door of the tower, and declared herself strong enough to effect her escape with her young mistress. With Maitland's assistance, I am certain that I can release them. I will make arrangements to send the old woman on to Ashurst, while I get out of the State with Evelyn before her absence is discovered. Till she is actually my wife, I shall leave her in ignorance of what you have told me to-day."</p> 
               <p>"Bravo! my lad; you are good at planning," said Martin, "if you only prove as good at executing, all will be well; but if that madcap boy who saluted us with such a yell this morning is your ally, I am afraid he will prove rather a dangerous one."</p> 
               <p>"Oh! I have bought up Maitland, and he has too little love for his father to betray me. I must marry Evelyn within the next few weeks or the estate of my grandfather may pass into other hands to be devoted to charitable purposes."</p> 
               <p>"Eh, what's that? Could so sensible a man as Judge Ashley have made such a provision as that? There is no<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6346-00000155"/> time to be lost, sure enough, and the young lady must be kept in the dark for her own good till it is too late to give weight to her father's claims upon her."</p> 
               <p>"Such is my view, and that is one reason why I withheld the proof of Mr. Hunter's accusation from my uncle."</p> 
               <p>Hunter now spoke:</p> 
               <p>"You have acted with discretion, Mr. Wentworth, and I feel the certainty that in you poor Eva's child will find the protector she so greatly needs. In your union with her, and that of Miss Wilde with the heir of the Arden estate, all necessity for a public exposure of the double crime which has been committed may be avoided. Furious as Ashley is in the prospect of such a denouement, it is the only one in which he can find safety."</p> 
               <p>"Then Delancey is really the heir whose existence my uncle has tried to ignore. How is it that the estate goes to another name?"</p> 
               <p>"His father took that of Delancey for money bequeathed on that condition, but my young friend will resume his family name when he takes possession of his inheritance," explained Captain Martin.</p> 
               <p>The remainder of the drive was taken up in arranging the details of the proposed elopement. It was settled that Hunter should accompany Wentworth, and remain in charge of the carriage, while Frank went on foot to the tower, and brought the rescued captives to the place of rendezvous.</p> 
               <p>When they gained the cross-roads, Bessie would meet them there, and taking the place of Jane in the carriage, send the woman on to recruit her exhausted strength in the quiet and repose of Ashurst, while Bessie accompanied the lovers in their flight.</p> 
               <p>When the result of the drive to Arden Place was made known to Bessie, she eagerly entered into the plan proposed posed, and Delancey so earnestly requested to be included in the party that he gained his point.</p> 
               <p>The State line was but twelve miles from Ashurst, and the old man who officiated there as Hymen's delegate, was known always to be in readiness at the shortest notice, and at any hour, to perform his devoir.</p> 
               <p>Frank insisted that they could reach their destination by ten o'clock, and be again at Ashurst by midnight. There, in her own home, protected by her husband, Evelyn should learn who she really was, and on the following day make such overtures of reconciliation to her father as she deemed most likely to succeed.</p> 
               <p>Bessie seized an opportunity to go up to her mother, and explain to her what had that morning happened. When Mrs. Ashley learned how providentially things had turned out, she wept bitterly, and with deep emotion said:</p> 
               <p>"God has been far better to me than I deserved. Bessie, I must prove to you that my penitence is sincere, by confessing to you a sin that I might now conceal with impunity. Open my desk and give me the two folded papers you will find there."</p> 
               <p>Bessie obeyed, and her mother held them up and said:</p> 
               <p>"This is the codicil and its copy. <emph>They are forgeries,</emph> Bessie, made by me in my mad desire to force you into Frank's arms. Thank God that I did not succeed, for I now know that you would both have been miserable. Burn them; let me see them consumed to ashes as soon as may be."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Minny!" exclaimed the appalled girl, "how dared you do such a thing as this?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, child, child, I would have done anything to save you from the fate I dreaded for you; but God has mercifully brought good out of evil. The sin is bitterly repented of, Bessie, and Christ himself has said, 'though your<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6346-00000156"/> sins be as scarlet, they shall be made white as snow.' I have atoned for my evil actions as far as lies in my power, and now, my pure darling, pray for me that I may be made whole."</p> 
               <p>Bessie was too much overcome by this unexpected confession to return very soon to her guests. She shut herself up in her own room till dinner was announced, and then, with some effort, smoothed from her brow the cloud of humiliation that rested on it through her mother's wrong-doing. "Deliver us from temptation" was the prayer upon her lips when she again went in to Mrs. Ashley, and gave her the kiss of reconciliation and forgiveness.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE ELOPEMENT.</head> 
               <p>AS the day wore on, it became slightly overcast, and there were signs of an approaching snow-storm, which filled Wentworth with anxiety.</p> 
               <p>But Captain Martin declared it would not fall that night; he insisted that he was too much accustomed to watching the signs of the weather to be deceived, and Frank gladly accepted his prognostics as infallible.</p> 
               <p>The short winter day closed so early, that it was but little after four when the carriage set out on its important errand. Bessie had taken the precaution to send a hood of her own, and her mother's cloak and furs, to Evelyn, for she felt sure she would need them in her nocturnal journey.</p> 
               <p>For Jane she did not consider it necessary to provide, as her clothing would of course be in her own room; but she was aware that Evelyn was permitted to have nothing more sent to her than she actually required for daily use in her prison.</p> 
               <p>The close carriage was ordered out, the driver bribed to secrecy by his young master, and in his zeal for the comfort of the runaways, the man placed in it a bear skin and a leopard skin, buttoned up every aperture, and ascertained that his horses were in good condition for the proposed escapade.</p> 
               <p>In the mean time, Wentworth and his companion, in the pony carriage, drove through a private road leading toward the point they wished to gain.</p> 
               <p>The autumn weather had been uncommonly fine, and the roads were still in excellent order; they made very good time to Arden Place, and drew up near the pond just as the moon was rising.</p> 
               <p>A thick woodland lay between them and the house, and there was little danger that on so cold a night any one would stray in that direction.</p> 
               <p>Hunter cheerfully said:</p> 
               <p>"We are in good time, Mr. Wentworth, and we shall have a clear light for our enterprise. I will drive behind the shelter of yonder clump of trees, and wait your return. If you prove successful, we should be on our way back in less than an hour."</p> 
               <p>"Don't intimate a doubt as to success," said Frank, feverishly. "If my hopes are dashed now, I believe I shall be ready to shoot myself. If I fail to rescue Evelyn tonight, and make her my own before another day dawns, something tells me that I shall never do so-never!"</p> 
               <p>"My dear boy, don't give way to fancies. Collect all your nerve, act with prudence, and I see nothing to defeat you."</p> 
               <p>"Evelyn may have been removed to some other place of durance. Her father may cause her to be more strictly<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6346-00000157"/> guarded. A thousand fears, unthought of before, assail me as I draw near the scene of action."</p> 
               <p>Hunter said everything he could think of to reassure him, and Wentworth soon plunged into the thick grove of pines which screened the old mansion from the northern blasts. The wind sighed among them with the melancholy wail only heard in perfection in a pine forest, but Wentworth heeded it not-his mind was too full of other thoughts and other fears.</p> 
               <p>There was but one point of danger before him. Where the woodland ended, a strip of open ground, about fifty feet in length, lay between it and the evergreens which grew around the tower. This once passed without observation, and he was safe for the present.</p> 
               <p>Just as he reached this point, a friendly cloud sailed over the moon, and he passed the low fence with a cautious tread. Lights were gleaming from several windows, and the stone-colored mansion arose cold and wintry-looking through the shivering branches of the trees.</p> 
               <p>Wentworth crouched down as one of the servants came into the yard. The man gathered up an armful of wood, and again went in, and Frank dashed across the open space as the door closed behind him. As he drew near the tower he moved with extreme caution, and his heart beat high with hope when he stood in the lower room, amid the wreck of matter that was shut in there.</p> 
               <p>Wentworth listened intently; he heard no sound of approaching footsteps, and he ventured to allow a gleam of light from the dark lantern he carried to penetrate the gloom around him. Just as he did so, he heard the upper door open, and the voice of old Hagar, at the head of the stairs, exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Miss Ev'lyn, de debbil's down stars, <emph>sho!</emph> for I saw de flash o' his eyes in de dark. Oh, Lor'! I is a missable sable nigga. What <emph>have</emph> become o' dat little rapscallion, dat he aint here to see what's goin' on down dar!"</p> 
               <p>The sounds were suddenly shut out by the closing of the tower door, and in another moment Wentworth had cleared the obstacles that lay in his way, and bounded up the stairs. He stood outside of the door, and listened to the sobbing of the superstitious old negro, mingled with the soothings of Evelyn, wondering how long the woman would detain him there. He passed his hand carefully over the lock, and found that the key had been removed; on gently trying the door, he satisfied himself that Hagar's fright had not caused her to neglect the safety of her prisoner, for she had evidently locked the door from within.</p> 
               <p>He had no resource but to await her appearance; and depositing his lantern, and the wrappings he had brought for Evelyn, in a corner of the platform, he awaited the appearance of Hagar with such patience as he could command.</p> 
               <p>At last her courage seemed to revive, and he heard her say:</p> 
               <p>"You's berry good, Miss Ev'lyn, an' I is a poor ole willan to keep you locked up here; but you knows dat ef I was to let you out, honey, de marster 'd kill me outright. But I 'spec' de debbil will catch me sho for what I's done to you."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Hagar; I know that you cannot do otherwise than obey my father. But how is it that your grandson is not below, as usual?"</p> 
               <p>"He's run off a huntin' wi' Marse Maitland, and I jes' thought I'd come up for once by myself. I wouldn't tell you dis, ef I hadn't my han' on de do', 'cause you mought try to git me in a fix by gittin' away from me."</p> 
               <p>As Hagar finished speaking, she suddenly opened the door wide enough to allow her to pass out alone, threw it too again with a crash, and with a rapid hand thrust in the<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6346-00000158"/> key and turned it in the lock. She carried a small lamp in her left hand, which was suddenly dashed away; a strong grip was laid on her throat, and a resolute voice hissed in her ear:</p> 
               <p>"Cry out, and a worse demon than I will prove, you will never meet in this world or the next. Where is the key? Did you leave it in the door?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, lud a massy," spluttered the old woman, "quit a diggin' yer claws inter my neck, you vernermous sarpint, an' I-I'll not make a noise. I'll be as quiet as a lamb."</p> 
               <p>"You had better, or I will choke the power of speech out of you before any one can get here to help you. Where is the key, I say?"</p> 
               <p>"Whar should it be but in de do', Marse Frank; for I knows yer voice now, an' I can guess what's brung you here, I reckon. Thar! 'taint no use; de marster can only kill me, an' I don't care much if he do."</p> 
               <p>Frank loosened one of his hands from the handkerchief around her throat, and with the other turned the key, pushed the door in, and saw Evelyn standing, pale and excited, in the centre of the floor, while Jane had risen from her bed, and was evidently preparing to assist him in his struggle with the negro.</p> 
               <p>"<emph>I'll</emph> fix you, madam," she resentfully said, as she advanced to the prostrate Hagar. "<emph>You've</emph> had your way long enough, but now my turn has come, and if I don't pay you back for making me drink all that pisen stuff your master sent me, my name aint Jane Tompkins. Don't trust her, Master Frank, but put a gag in her old mouth at once and let me tie her fast. I warrant she'll not get away then before somebody comes here to help her."</p> 
               <p>Before Hagar could utter a remonstrance, Jane had bound a silk handkerchief over her mouth in such a manner as effectually to stifle her cries; she then lifted her, without apparent effort, and threw her on the bed she had just vacated.</p> 
               <p>Wentworth had brought a strong cord with him, and this the nurse used in the most artistic manner, binding her captive hand and foot, so that escape was impossible without assistance from another.</p> 
               <p>Jane then turned to her young lady and said:</p> 
               <p>"Come, Miss Evelyn, we must be getting out of this place, for some of the people may miss this old hag, and be coming here to look after her. I'll not let her freeze though she did try to pizen me, so I'll just cover her up before we go away."</p> 
               <p>While Jane had been thus occupied, Wentworth had brought in the things Bessie had sent, and Evelyn tremblingly said:</p> 
               <p>"Dear Frank, how thoughtful you are. But for these I must have wrapped myself in the bed-clothes, or taken from Jane what she will need for herself."</p> 
               <p>"Bessie sent them to you. She will meet us on the way, and go with you-you know where."</p> 
               <p>She blushed vividly and hastened to fasten the coquettish little hood and throw the veil over it, while Frank, with eager hands, wrapped the cloak about her, and secured the furs around the charming throat; all the time explaining in a low voice what he had arranged to accomplish that night.</p> 
               <p>By the time Evelyn was ready, Jane had also donned her bonnet and a heavy tartan shawl; and, turning to the bound woman, Wentworth gravely said:</p> 
               <p>"You will be quite comfortable there till morning, Hagar, and if you make no attempt to inform any one of your situation, I will hereafter reward you and protect you from the anger of my uncle. Mr. Ashley is not your lawful master, and a new man will soon rule here, so you had better take heed to what you do."</p> 
               <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6346-00000159"/> 
               <p>Hagar made no effort to reply, for she felt how useless it would be, and the two passed out, taking the lantern with them; the door was locked; the key thrown among the rubbish below; and the three descended the stairs in breathless joy at the success of this first act in the drama of the night.</p> 
               <p>As they drew near the outer door, steps were heard approaching, and shrinking back, the refugees listened in alarm. A childish voice arose and cried out:</p> 
               <p>"Granny-granny, is dat you a comin'? I's 'feard to come in by myself."</p> 
               <p>"It is Tom, old Hagar's grandson," whispered Evelyn, "what are we to do now?"</p> 
               <p>"Be quiet, and he will soon get tired of crying there in the cold. He cannot be easily heard from the house, so there is little danger of any one coming to his assistance. Besides, Maitland promised to take care of him, and he will come to the rescue."</p> 
               <p>In trembling silence she awaited the result; but after a few more calls, the boy retreated, and after satisfying himself that he was actually gone, Wentworth led forth the two rescued captives.</p> 
               <p>The three made their way through the dense shrubbery and approached the open space before mentioned. Again Wentworth reconnoitred, and seeing no one in the yard, he bade his companions pass over the space as rapidly as possible, while he covered their retreat.</p> 
               <p>Evelyn flitted over the frozen ground with light steps, but Jane, with limbs stiffened by her long confinement, stumbled and fell.</p> 
               <p>The door of an outhouse suddenly opened, and a voice from within cried out:</p> 
               <p>"Is dat you, Aunt Hagar? Missis is a waitin' for you to comb her har. She says I pull it so dat I sha'n't tetch it ag'in.</p> 
                
               <p>Evelyn recognized the voice of the girl her step-mother had taken for her maid, and her heart died within her lest Ailsie had also seen and recognized her. But Jane's presence of mind did not fail her, and imitating the voice and pronunciation of the old negro, she said:</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it's me, Ailsie. I is stumbled down, but I aint hurt. Git back's quick as you kin, and tell missis I'll be thar in a minnit."</p> 
               <p>The door was slammed to, and Jane sprang up and passed over the intervening space with rapid steps, followed closely by Frank. As he joined them in the woodland, he whispered:</p> 
               <p>"There is no time to lose now. In half an hour at most the house will be alarmed and a pursuit undertaken. Let us hasten to the carriage as quickly as possible."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I shall die if I am captured now," exclaimed Evelyn. "Let us fly from this dreadful spot before it is too late to evade pursuit."</p> 
               <p>"My darling, do not become excited. We have the start, and ten minutes will now place us in safety. Once in the carriage with my friend and myself to guard you, I defy any one to tear you from me."</p> 
               <p>He passed his arm around her as he thus spoke, and almost carried her through the pine grove. As they drew near the pond, Maitland suddenly darted from the shelter of a tree, and cried out:</p> 
               <p>"So you've gone and done it, sure enough. Hooray! You are safe, Evy, and I've won the pony, saddle and bridle."</p> 
               <p>"Make less noise, Maitland, or you may undo all we have accomplished," remonstrated Wentworth. "You have bravely helped us so far, and carried out the plan I laid down for you this morning pretty well, but why did you let the boy come to the tower at last? I was afraid he would spoil all."</p> 
               <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6346-00000160"/> 
               <p>"He slipped away from me because he was afraid old Hagar would whip him for not being at the tower when she came down. I caught him again, and I think after tonight he will think my orders as well worth obeying as his granny's."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Maty, suppose your papa finds out that you have helped us off, what will he do to you?" asked Evelyn, apprehensively. The lad snapped his fingers contemptuously, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Do you suppose he'd try it on me as he did on a poor little bird like you? The gov'nor is only hard on them that can't turn on him, and let him know that they an't to be trampled on. <emph>I'm</emph> one of that spirited class, and he respects my courage, you see."</p> 
               <p>Agitated as she was, Evelyn could not restrain a smile at this braggadocio, but she kissed the utterer of it with many commendations for his goodness in aiding them.</p> 
               <p>"They presently came in sight of the carriage, and Maitland begged to go with them; but this Frank refused, as his absence, if continued much later, would be sure to be discovered, and perhaps lead to a premature pursuit. He reluctantly took leave of them, with the assurance that he would come over to Ashurst early the next morning to see that they had returned safely, and to claim the pony with its accoutrements.</p> 
               <p>The carriage was driven off, and Hunter displayed his skill as a charioteer, as the spirited ponies moved with flying feet over the distance that lay between Arden Place and the cross-roads.</p> 
               <p>At that point they found the carriage from Ashurst, which had drawn up to await their arrival only a few moments before.</p> 
               <p>Jane took her young lady in her arms, kissed and fervently blessed her, and then permitted Frank to remove her to the larger vehicle. She was received in the embrace of Bessie, who tenderly said:</p> 
               <p>"You dear, darling Evelyn, I am so glad you have effected your escape. I have so much to tell you that will astonish you, but we must save all revelations for to-morrow. This is Mr. Delancey, of whom you have before heard; he and I have volunteered to act as attendants to you and Frank."</p> 
               <p>Evelyn murmured some inaudible words as she sunk back on the seat beside her friend, and Delancey said:</p> 
               <p>"I think we shall have a pleasant and successful trip, Miss Ashley, for the clouds have floated away, and the night is as clear and bright as I hope your destiny, and that of my friend Wentworth, will be."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you," said Frank; "I feared very much, at one time to-day, that the weather would be malicious enough to prevent our return to Ashurst to-night."</p> 
               <p>"That would indeed be a vexation," said Bessie, "for I have ordered a bridal feast to be prepared, and Captain Martin and Mr. Hunter have promised to sit up till we get back."</p> 
               <p>After a few moments of silence, Evelyn spoke:</p> 
               <p>"You said that you have revelations to make to me, Bessie. Of what nature are they?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I did not mean to-night, my dear. We shall have you all to ourselves to-morrow, and both Frank and I have a wonderful story to relate, so prepare your ears to be astonished."</p> 
               <p>"I have that to say, too, which will surprise you as much as anything you can have to tell me, that is, unless Frank has already informed you of the singular position I occupy."</p> 
               <p>"He has told me enough to enlighten me as to your perfect right to take the step you have done to-night. But let us not talk of those things now; we are a happy bridal party, and must find something merry to say."</p> 
               <pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6346-00000161"/> 
               <p>At this hint, Wentworth and Delancey roused themselves to find such entertainment for their fair companions as made the time fly on wings of mirth. They sang, bandied repartees, and by the time they had passed over the ground lying between Ashurst and the small village in which Mr. Jones, the accommodating magistrate lived, the young party, with the blessed privilege of their years, had almost forgotten that such things as grief or sadness exist in the world.</p> 
               <p>Rufus Welby, to whom a note had been sent by Delancey warning him of what was to happen that night, was already on the spot, and late as the hour was, the magistrate was up waiting for them, with lights burning on the table in his office, and a bright fire on the hearth.</p> 
               <p>As Welby assisted Bessie from the carriage, he said:</p> 
               <p>"Eh, Miss Bessie, I had no idea that a wedding would come off in the neighborhood before Kate's, but I am very happy to assist at this one."</p> 
               <p>"And we are very grateful for your forethought in having everything ready for us here."</p> 
               <p>They entered the dingy room used an office, and gathered a few moments around the fire, which gave brightness and warmth to the bachelor's den. Mr. Jones's domicile boasted but two rooms; they sufficed for him in his state of single blessedness, though everything around demonstrated the want of feminine supervision.</p> 
               <p>But our youthful party were not inclined to be critical, and Evelyn presently laid aside her wrappings and smoothed her hair preparatory to the important ceremony.</p> 
               <p>Although she was pale from emotion, she looked very charming in her neat gray dress and plain collar.</p> 
               <p>Delancey and Bessie stood up with her, and Rufus Welby gave her away. Mr. Jones, a raw-boned, gray-haired haired man, dressed in homespun, placed himself in front of the bridal pair, and spoke in a sententious manner:</p> 
               <p>"My young friends, I hope sincerely that you are not running into misery in coming off to me to make you one. 'Marry in haste, and repent at leisure,' says the proverb; but if such proves your fate, I absolve myself from all blame for putting shackles on you which I have declined to wear myself. You know your own business best, and mine is to join people together for better or for worse. With you I hope it will be all for the better, and no worse in the bargain."</p> 
               <p>After this quaint address, he at once went on with the brief ceremony, which was as original as the address which preceded it. At its close, the young couple received the congratulations of all present, and Welby went to a table in one corner, removed a newspaper carelessly thrown over it, and revealed two champagne bottles, with half a dozen glasses, which he had brought with him to drink the health of the newly wedded pair.</p> 
               <p>After a few moments of lively conversation, Wentworth drew Mr. Jones aside, and astonished him by presenting him with three double eagles, a much larger fee than he was in the habit receiving.</p> 
               <p>It was settled that Welby should return with the bridal party to Ashurst, and he insisted that Delancey should ride in the chaise with him. In accordance with this arrangement, Wentworth, with the ladies, took possession of the carriage.</p> 
               <p>Bessie refused to separate the two so recently united, and she took possession of the front seat, leaving Frank and his bride to whisper the thousand and one things that lovers have to say when they have been so long kept apart as these two had been.</p> 
               <p>In dreamy reverie, half bright, half painful, the hours<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6346-00000162"/> passed away, while Bessie pretended to sleep that her companions might find her presence no restraint upon the confidence they had to repose in each other.</p> 
               <p>At two o'clock the carriage drew up before the future home of the newly wedded pair, and the two friends, who had anxiously watched for their return, came out to meet them with congratulations and wishes for their future prosperity.</p> 
               <p>When they were all safe in the warm and brilliantly lighted room, in which an exquisite supper was set out, Hunter anxiously asked:</p> 
               <p>"Did you meet any one as you were returning hither?"</p> 
               <p>"No-not a creature," Wentworth quickly replied. "Has any one been sent here in pursuit of us?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes-a message came from Mrs. Ashley, inquiring if her step-daughter or her nnrse had taken refuge here, as they had both disappeared from Arden Place. It seems that you were missed, Mrs. Wentworth, very shortly after you effected your escape."</p> 
               <p>At the sound of her new name Evelyn blushed vividly, and eagerly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Did-did Mr. Ashley know that I had fled, or did his wife only send to inquire about me?"</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Ashley was not made aware of what had happened; he had retired before the discovery was made, and in the precarious state of his health it was thought best not to disturb him. The overseer came here with two white laborers, and he said he had orders to pursue and overtake you if possible and bring Miss Ashley back to her home."</p> 
               <p>Frank laughed and said:</p> 
               <p>"They evidently thought 'discretion the better part of valor,' for they took good care to avoid coming in contact with us. Aunt Augusta must have thought me a poor knight indeed to yield up the treasure I had won at the command of such emissaries as those."</p> 
               <p>"Poor lady! I fancy she was in such a distracted condition at the thought of what her husband's rage will be when he awakes to-morrow and hears of the event of the night, that she scarcely knew what she had best do."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Frank!" said Evelyn, impulsively, "we must go over immediately after breakfast to-morrow morning, and help her to bear his rage. Though she is not to blame, he will treat her as if she is."</p> 
               <p>"Very well, my love, I will not deny you the first request you have made of me, though I could have wished to spare you any more of my uncle's violence. We must stand between him and my poor aunt, I suppose, as it would not be just to compel <emph>her</emph> to bear the burden of our escapade."</p> 
               <p>The party gathered around the table, and for the next hour cast away all thought of care. When they at length arose, Hunter took the hand of Evelyn in his own and impressively said:</p> 
               <p>"To-morrow morning I ask a brief interview with you, Mrs. Wentworth, before you set out for Arden Place. I have that to communicate which is of vital interest to you."</p> 
               <p>She regarded him earnestly and asked:</p> 
               <p>"Can you tell me who I am, Mr. Hunter? from whom I am descended, and on what part of this wide continent I was born? If you can do that, I shall indeed be grateful to you and look on you as one of my best friends."</p> 
               <p>"I have known for several days that I have the right to stand in that relation to you; but I cannot reveal my story to you to-night. It is long and exciting, and you need repose after all you have lately gone through. In the morning you shall learn all I have to tell you."</p> 
               <pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6346-00000163"/> 
               <p>Evelyn would have remonstrated against this suspense, but Frank laughed and said:</p> 
               <p>"It is best so, Evelyn. Show your conjugal submission by taking my word for it and submitting to the delay Mr. Hunter asks."</p> 
               <p>With a smile and a blush she at once yielded, and soon afterward she and Bessie disappeared.</p> 
               <p>Late as it was, Evelyn found her nurse in the room that had been prepared for her, and she was clasped in the arms which had always been her refuge in grief or joy. Jane poured over her such a torrent of blessings and prayers for her future happiness and prosperity that she drew tears from the gentle eyes hidden on her bosom.</p> 
               <p>"My darling," she concluded, "I always knew that you were born to something great, and you'll yet find out that you belong to grand people, and you'll have everything that heart can desire. Your old nurse can die now, for her work is done."</p> 
               <p>"You are not to die, but to live with me, and be my dear old <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bonne</foreign> as you always have been," replied Evelyn, with a little laugh that the old woman knew came from a happy heart.</p> 
               <p>In the mean time Bessie went into her mother's room and gave her an account of the adventures of the night. When she finished, Mrs. Ashley said with a sigh:</p> 
               <p>"So they are married, and you are safe from all persecutions on Frank's account now. I wonder what that dreadful man will do when he hears of Evelyn's marriage? Does she yet know that she is really his daughter?"</p> 
               <p>"Not yet. Frank thought it best to agitate her no further to-night. To-morrow morning Mr. Hunter will reveal to her all the facts which prove that Mr. Ashley adopted his own daughter without being aware of it. I wonder the Ashley mark upon her arm did not lead him to inquire into her origin. <emph>That</emph> was the only thing about me that could have induced him to believe that an auburn-haired descendant could belong to his dark race. Tell me, how did I come by it, mother?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Bessie, that is another of my sins; I produced it artificially. It was necessary to do so, or I could never have imposed you on Judge Ashley as the daughter of his son. There-I have told you all now, and I wish never to speak of or allude to these things again. I am nervous and restless; pray leave me alone, for I must try and sleep. Captain Martin sent a note up to me, which I have exerted myself to answer, and I have been in a state of great excitement ever since."</p> 
               <p>"Let me give you some composing drops," was the quiet reply; and after administering them, Bessie kissed her tenderly, whispered a few soothing words in her ear, and left the apartment.</p>

               <head type="sub">RETRIBUTION TO A BAD MAN.</head> 
               <p>TOWARD morning the clouds again gathered, there was less chill in the atmosphere, and a light snow fell. At daybreak a white shroud covered the earth and clothed the forest with feathery tracery which glittered a few moments in the sunshine when that luminary broke forth, and then, as a fairy vision, melted away.</p> 
               <p>The dreaded storm proved a mere snow flurry, and by ten o'clock, when the inmates of Ashurst gathered around the late breakfast, all traces of it had nearly disappeared.</p> 
               <p>As soon as the morning meal was over, Hunter led<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6346-00000164"/> Evelyn into the library, followed by Frank, there to give her the information he had promised. As gently and concisely as possible he informed her of her true position, and when she heard that she was indeed the daughter of Leon Ashley, she burst in tears and said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Frank, why did you keep me in the dark as to the truth! When convinced that Mr. Hunter's statement is undeniable, my father could no longer have refused his consent to our union, and I should have escaped the malediction he will be sure to hurl upon me now."</p> 
               <p>"I kept it from you, my darling, precisely because I feared you would reason in this way, and refuse to accept the chance of escape I offered you. I look upon my uncle as a man made mad by the indulgence of his evil passions, and you might have become a victim to his cruelty before he could have been convinced of the necessity of giving you to me. Besides, it was necessary to make you mine within six months after our grandfather's death; so you see, my love, that I acted for the best for all concerned. You and Bessie only make an exchange-you take possession as mistress here, and she will become the lady of Arden Place. Delancey, you already know, is the heir-at-law."</p> 
               <p>"But what is to become of my father's family?" she apprehensively asked.</p> 
               <p>"My uncle enjoys a liberal annuity from this estate, to which I will add as much more, provided he will give us his blessing. He will doubtless find a home to suit himself."</p> 
               <p>She sighed, then looked up at the handsome face of her husband, and a tender smile broke over her lips as she murmured:</p> 
               <p>"After all, I am so happy in finding myself safe with you, Frank, that I cannot blame you for the part you have played."</p> 
               <p>Then turning to Mr. Hunter, she gracefully said:</p> 
                
               <p>"You are my only maternal relative, I believe, Mr. Hunter, and I first use my privilege as mistress here to ask you to make your visit to Ashurst as long as possible."</p> 
               <p>"Many thanks, my fair cousin; but I fear that I must return forthwith to New York and complete my arrangements for sailing to Europe. I have lived so long there that I feel like a stranger in the land of my birth."</p> 
               <p>"Some day, perhaps, you will feel a longing to return to your fatherland," she gently replied. "When time or sickness have laid their hand upon you, then come back to us, and we will welcome and cheer you to the best of our ability. The friend of my poor deserted mother possesses the strongest claims upon her child."</p> 
               <p>Hunter lifted her hand to his lips in deep emotion, and when Wentworth pressed on him the invitation his bride had given, he gratefully replied:</p> 
               <p>"I shall be glad to have a haven of repose to look forward to in my old age, for I have been a wanderer nearly all the days of my life. In the time to come, my fair cousin, you may have a grey-haired patriarch to take care of."</p> 
               <p>"Do not defer coming to us so long as that. Return as soon as it suits you to do so, and you may be assured that you will always meet with a warm welcome."</p> 
               <p>A few moments later the carriage was announced as waiting at the door, and Evelyn ran up to her room, to get ready for the visit she so much dreaded. Bessie prepared to go with her, bearing with her a confession written by her mother at Captain Martin's command, which must set at rest every doubt as to the truth of what Ashley had refused to believe on the previous day.</p> 
               <p>The two ladies, with Martin and Wentworth, occupied the close carriage, while Hunter, at his own request, drove over the pony phaeton, with Jane for his companion. He<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6346-00000165"/> wished again to cross question her as to her share in the deception she had been so long induced to conceal from a regard for the interests of the child whose prosperity she intended to share.</p> 
               <p>Her statements were so clear and straightforward that her interrogator believed it would be impossible for Ashley still to deny the crime of which he had been guilty. When his coadjutor was brought face to face with him, he must confess the fraud.</p> 
               <p>When the carriage drew up in front of Arden Place, Evelyn became so much agitated that Bessie feared that she would faint. She whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Bessie! my father will be so furious! He will use such fearful language to me that I shrink from the thought of meeting him. If he should die in his anger, I should forever blame myself as the cause of his death."</p> 
               <p>Frank took her in his arms, and lifting her from the vehicle, cheerfully said:</p> 
               <p>"You have <emph>me</emph> to defend you now, my darling; and Bessie to speak up for both of us, if your father becomes too violent."</p> 
               <p>There was an air of ominous calm about the house, and they were wondering why the door was not at once opened, when it slowly unclosed and the tear-stained face of poor Augusta became visible.</p> 
               <p>She hurriedly said in a guarded tone:</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Ashley knows nothing yet; he has just come out of his room and taken his breakfast. Please come in here with me, girls, and stay with me till the gentlemen go in and break to Leon what has happened. I am glad you have come to help me to bear the burden of his wrath."</p> 
               <p>As this was clearly the only course to be pursued in this contingency, the two ladies followed her into the apartment she usually occupied. Hunter had left Jane in the phaeton till her presence was needed, and the three gentlemen paused a few moments in the hall to consult together as to what was to be done in this crisis.</p> 
               <p>No sooner had the door closed on Evelyn than Augusta turned toward her and reproachfully asked:</p> 
               <p>"How could you act as you have done, Evelyn? You know that by such a disobedient step you risk ending your father's life in a fit of passion, yet you have dared to take it. Besides, runaway matches rarely turn out well, and I suppose you have been into Virginia and got married to Frank in spite of your father's opposition?"</p> 
               <p>Seeing that Evelyn was too much agitated to speak, Bessie took up her defense.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Madam; Frank and Evelyn are married, and such an elopement as theirs I am sure both God and man will approve. I am not apprehensive that any evil will result from a union so suitable in every respect as this one is. Should Mr. Ashley die of an explosion of wrath, I shall hold his ungovernable temper responsible for the catastrophe, and not throw the blame of it on anything Evelyn has done."</p> 
               <p>Augusta sighed heavily, and complainingly went on:</p> 
               <p>"I shall lead a worse life than ever now, for Leon will have no one else on whom to vent his wrath. Last night old Hagar could not be found when I needed her services, and when she was at last discovered tied up in the room you left, I thought I should have died of fright. Luckily Leon was asleep, and I would not let any one wake him to tell him what had happened. Though I did all I could to get you back, and sent three men in pursuit of you, I know that he will never believe that I was not in league with you and helped you to get off. Oh, dear! oh, dear! I do not know what is to become of me!"</p> 
               <pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6346-00000166"/> 
               <p>To this lament, coming, as her listeners knew, from the depths of her heart, Bessie replied:</p> 
               <p>"If Mr. Ashley makes your life so wretched, why do you not leave him? There is no law by which a man can compel his wife to remain with him merely to make her the bearer of his brutal harshness."</p> 
               <p>"If I did such a thing, I should have nothing to live on," was the dejected reply. "My small fortune has been spent long ago, and I am entirely dependent on Leon."</p> 
               <p>Bessie compassionately replied:</p> 
               <p>"If you find it impossible to bear the additional burden the event of last night may place upon you, Evelyn and Frank will doubtless see that you have enough to live on in comfort away from Mr. Ashley. I may also say to you that my mother intends to relinquish, in favor of yourself and your son, the large sum bequeathed to her by Judge Ashley. I will say no more now, but leave Frank to explain her wishes and intentions more fully to you."</p> 
               <p>At this unexpected assurance, Augusta visibly brightened, and they conversed amicably together till they were summoned to the next room.</p> 
               <p>In the mean time, the three gentlemen had made their way unannounced into Mr. Ashley's sanctum. He was absorbed in the contents of the last newspaper, but the sound of approaching feet caused him to lower the sheet from before his inflamed visage. The leaden pallor of his complexion had lately given place to the deep, purple flush of the confirmed inebriate, and his bloodshot eyes glared out of his disfigured face with an expression of wrathful astonishment as he thundered to Frank:</p> 
               <p>"How dare you again appear in my house after what I said to you yesterday? Get out of my sight, you odious reptile!" and a volley of curses followed. These were interrupted by the advance of Hunter, who sternly said:</p> 
                
               <p>"Silence, if you please, Mr. Ashley. I have come hither to arraign you as a criminal, and such violence is unbecoming one in your position."</p> 
               <p>"This-<emph>this</emph> to me in my own house! What do you mean by such unheard-of insolence? Hillo! Tom, Jack, Jerry, come hither, and put these intruders out of my doors."</p> 
               <p>Captain Martin quietly locked the door, and put the key in his pocket. He then turned to the enraged man and coolly said:</p> 
               <p>"My friend, I wish you to understand that you are a prisoner in this house, which I came hither to inform you is no longer yours, even by courtesy. It is the property of my young friend, Ernest Delancey, and he intends to take possession of his estate immediately."</p> 
               <p>The very intensity of Ashley's rage and astonishment gave him outward calmness; he replied with an affectation of courtesy very unlike his usual manner:</p> 
               <p>"I am much indebted to you for this information, sir: and pray when does this new claimant to my daughter's estate make his appearance here? What shall be done to welcome him?"</p> 
               <p>"As to that, he will make his own welcome, and he is not very far off. I am happy to inform you that he was one of the bridal party last night, when your daughter Evelyn effected her escape and went into Virginia, where she was united to Mr. Wentworth."</p> 
               <p>The purple flush suddenly faded from the face of the listener, and he faintly gasped:</p> 
               <p>"What is that you dare assert? It is another falsehood, told to drive me wild. Have you taken it on yourself to torture me?"</p> 
               <p>"That would be a superfluous undertaking," retorted the Captain dryly. "Speak for yourself, Mr. Wentworth, and bear witness to the truth of what I have stated."</p> 
               <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6346-00000167"/> 
               <p>Frank said in a clear voice:</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Uncle, you may believe Captain Martin. I gained access to the tower last night, released Evelyn, and also the woman, Jane Tompkins. She came hither with us this morning, and is waiting to be admitted to you. Evelyn and I were married before midnight, and returned to Ashurst. The only course left you now is to accept the truth of the statements made to you by these gentlemen yesterday, and agree to what we propose. I have with me the written confession of Mrs. Ashley, given to me by Bessie on my way hither, and that must remove the last doubt from your mind as to what she has done."</p> 
               <p>When Wentworth ceased speaking, Hunter commenced:</p> 
               <p>"The proofs are clear as day, Ashley, and it is useless for you to attempt to deny their validity. To bring them into a court of justice will be to bring ruin and disgrace upon yourself. Wentworth and my young cousin have secured the Ashley estate by being united within the stipulated six months, and you should feel thankful that such a settlement can now be made as will not compromise you."</p> 
               <p>Ashley's head sunk forward, and for a few moments he seemed struggling for breath; but he presently rallied, and faintly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Am I, then, to be thrust out of the asylum in which I hoped to end my days? But why should I give up thus? It is but a well-concocted lie that you are trying to impose on me. What is Jane's evidence worth, when she has been imbecile for weeks past? Nothing-nothing-and I again defy you."</p> 
               <p>His voice regained its volume and all its harsh power as he ended. Hunter approached the window and raised his hand, thus making the signal agreed on between Jane and himself; he then turned toward Ashley, and coolly said:</p> 
                
               <p>"We shall soon convince you to the contrary, sir. Jane is sound in mind as I am, as you will soon see for yourself."</p> 
               <p>In a few more moments the nurse entered the apartment, and boldly confronted her former employer. Her eyes blazed when they fell upon him, and she defiantly said:</p> 
               <p>"I have always been told that this is a free country, Mr. Ashley, and I mean to take the liberty of telling you what I think of you and your doings. You have kept me for weeks almost at death's door with your pizen physic, because you were afraid that I should speak out and tell Miss Evelyn to go along with her handsome lover, for you had no authority to keep her from him. You know that she was the child left with my sister-in-law by the New York man whose name I could never remember, but when I heard it I knew it again. Mr. George Allen left her there, I can swear, and <emph>you</emph> took her from there in place of your dead child, in less than a year afterward. There, I've said all I have to say, but it's to the purpose, I believe."</p> 
               <p>The wild expression with which Ashley had listened to this voluble address, and the rapid fluctuations of his complexion, excited some alarm in the visitors, and Hunter hastened to place a glass of water to his lips. He presently seemed more composed, and with all his anger revived, he furiously demanded:</p> 
               <p>"Woman, what do you mean by asserting that <emph>I</emph> have caused you to be poisoned?"</p> 
               <p>"I mean just what I say, Mr. Ashley. You may not have meant to kill me, but the medicine Hagar forced on me by your orders, kept me down, and made me foolish. <emph>You</emph> knew it would have that effect when you ordered her to make me take it."</p> 
               <p>"Wretch! how dare you accuse me of such a thing as that?"</p> 
               <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6346-00000168"/> 
               <p>"Because it's God's truth, and you know it is, Mr. Ashley. I am ready to swear to it in any court in Christendom. I'd ha' done that anyhow, if this gentleman had not proved to me that Miss Evelyn is really your daughter. If you want to save yourself from the consequences of your bad life, you'd better accept the terms Mr. Frank is ready to offer you, and deal gently with the poor child that has been treated worse than a dog since she came to this country."</p> 
               <p>"Stop her! for Heaven's sake, stop her!" exclaimed Ashley, who had vainly attempted to interrupt the rapid flow of words by which he was assailed. "Gentlemen, I can stand anything but the tongue of a virago of that stamp. I succumb; fate is stronger than I am, and I give up sooner than have a Niagara of proof poured upon me by that unfeminine creature."</p> 
               <p>Jane tossed her head contemptuously.</p> 
               <p>"I suppose it's feminine to sit still and take your hard words in silence, as Mrs. Ashley and my young lady have done; but after they hear how I've put you down to-day, maybe they'll change their tactics. Since you confess that I have told the truth, I am satisfied, and I can leave the rest to Mr. Hunter and to Miss Evelyn's husband. Thank the blessed Lord that she's out of your merciless clutches at last, and has got somebody to take care of her, and try to make up to her for all you've made her suffer."</p> 
               <p>"Will you leave this room, you impertinent jade? How dare you talk to me thus?"</p> 
               <p>"Dare, indeed! I reckon I'll do worse than that if you don't do the fair thing by Mr. Wentworth, and treat Miss Evelyn as your daughter ought to be treated."</p> 
               <p>"There, that will do, Mrs. Tompkins," said Hunter, quietly, leading her toward the door. "Since Mr. Ashley is reasonable, we can deal with him without any further assistance from you."</p> 
                
               <p>"I am glad to hear that, sir; for I am sure I never want to look in his disgusting, swelled up face again as long as I live. Who'd ha' thought that such a looking creetur as <emph>he</emph> is could ever have come the sentimental over women; but they do say he was what they call a fascinator once. Umph! so is a snake, I've heard say."</p> 
               <p>With this parting thrust, Jane swept from the room, and after an interval of sulky silence, Ashley said:</p> 
               <p>"It seems that I must go to the wall, but I sha'n't submit to be put out of this house till I know where I am to go, and what I have to depend on."</p> 
               <p>Wentworth here spoke:</p> 
               <p>"I am authorized by Delancey to say to you that it is his intention to leave this country immediately after his marriage, to spend several years in Europe. During his absence, in consideration of the tie so long supposed to exist between you and Bessie, he wishes you to occupy this place as your home. For myself, I promise, if you will receive Evelyn kindly, to double the annuity you now draw from my grandfather's estate. Furthermore, Mrs. Ashley desired me to say to you that the personal property which Judge Ashley bequeathed to her, she designs to settle on Maitland, to become his when he is twenty-one."</p> 
               <p>"Upon my word, she is very liberal, to give to my son what should have been mine had justice been done," sneered Ashley; "but I suppose I must be grateful for the crumbs, if I am shut out from the feast. You offer to pay high, Mr. Francis, for a few soft words to your pretty doll; but if she is poor Eva's child, I owe them to her, I suppose. Call her in, and consider the affair as settled. I swallow the whole romance for-a consideration."</p> 
               <p>Wentworth smiled at this characteristic acceptance of benefits his uncle so little deserved, and gladly went on the errand assigned him.</p> 
               <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6346-00000169"/> 
               <p>Evelyn was led in with tears in her beautiful eyes, and timid smiles breaking over her rosy mouth. She impulsively rushed toward her father, and throwing herself before him, cried out:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, papa-my own papa! I did not know till this morning that I am really your daughter. Jane told me that story of my adoption, and I believed myself free to go with Frank without asking your consent. Dear father, pardon and bless us, or my heart will break."</p> 
               <p>A touch of emotion swept over the face that leaned above her. In that moment Ashley remembered the bright young creature who loved him so wildly that she had broken her troth to another to fly with him, only to be rewarded by desertion and death, and his cold heart softened for one brief moment to her child. He held forth his hand, and gently said:</p> 
               <p>"Rise, my daughter-known as such at last. I acknowledge the tie that binds you to me, and forgive you for the part you have played. It is well, perhaps, that you and Frank were united without my knowledge, for I might have tried to prevent a marriage which I sincerely believe will prove fortunate for you both. Here is my hand, Frank; take Evelyn and make her happy, and you will have my blessing."</p> 
               <p>Wentworth gladly accepted the offered amnesty, and grasped the hand extended to him.</p> 
               <p>Ashley then sank back in his chair, and said:</p> 
               <p>"I am not well, gentlemen and ladies, and I have had more excitement than is good for me. I beg that you will all leave me except my wife and Bessie. I wish to speak a few words with Miss <emph>Wilde.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>Evelyn pressed his hand to her lips, and suffered herself to be conducted into the adjoining room by Frank, followed by Hunter and Martin.</p> 
                
               <p>No sooner was the door closed upon them than the old vindictive expression came back to Ashley's face, and with bitter sarcasm he addressed Bessie:</p> 
               <p>"So-<emph>you</emph> are to be Mrs. Delancey. You will turn me out on the world while you revel here as mistress. You are a base, undermining plotter, Bessie Wilde, and I believe all you have done was only to make that beggar you are going to marry a rich man at my expense."</p> 
               <p>He paused; but she made no reply to so absurd an accusation, and he went on:</p> 
               <p>"Tell your precious mother that it is well for her that I am in a scrape myself, or I would make her rue the day she ever brought you to Ashurst as an impostor, and-"</p> 
               <p>Bessie raised her hand, and spoke in a tone of command that silenced him:</p> 
               <p>"Remember, sir, in that imposition lies your own safety. What would be your position now, if the child you imposed on the world as the heiress of this estate, were not really your own daughter? Since you only detained me to insult me, I shall leave the room at once."</p> 
               <p>"Aye, do; and tell this liberal lover of yours that I would perish on the highway sooner than be indebted to him for a shelter. I shall leave this place before the week is out, and seek a home in Baltimore. After so long a fast my old taste for pleasure begins to revive, and a short and merry life is better than to rot in dulness as the weeds that cumber the earth. I shall hasten to bury the memory of my defeat here in the excitement of my old pursuits."</p> 
               <p>The door closed on the indignant Bessie, and Mrs. Ashley ventured to say:</p> 
               <p>"Oh! Leon, after the way you received Evelyn just now, I began to hope better things of you."</p> 
               <p>He turned on her a look of bitter disdain, and went on in his old manner:</p> 
               <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6346-00000170"/> 
               <p>"Are you such a fool, Augusta, as not to understand that my <emph>interests</emph> were at stake in that? Frank offered a heavy bribe for a few soft words to Evelyn, and of course, I gave them. Perhaps I felt a little for her, too, when I was convinced that she is the child of my first love. Yes, I was more infatuated by her mother than by any <emph>other</emph> woman I have ever known; but that nonsense is all past and gone. It is only in the verdant days of youth that a man makes himself a fool about women. If you think that I have been turned from what the parsons would call 'the evil of my ways,' you have made a great mistake. I am what I am, and I intend to act out my true nature to the end."</p> 
               <p>Deeply depressed by this assurance, Augusta could not restrain her tears. He turned on her and harshly cried:</p> 
               <p>"Tears-tears forever! One would think you had a perfect fountain. Your dulness has long led me to believe that you have a weight of water on your brain, and now I am convinced of it. Where is that wretched boy of mine? I have neither seen nor heard of him to-day; and as Mrs. Ashley means to endow him with a snug fortune, he has become of some importance to me."</p> 
               <p>"He said something about a pony Frank had given him and he went over to Ashurst early this morning to claim it."</p> 
               <p>"The little wretch! I see now how Frank communicated with Evelyn, and I-I'll pay Master Maitland for joining with my enemies against me; bought up-the mercenary little villain! Just let him come within my reach again, that is all!"</p> 
               <p>Augusta trembled as she saw that he was working himself into one of his white rages; and like the lioness roused to fury in defence of her young, she gained courage to say:</p> 
                
               <p>"So long as <emph>I</emph> live, I will stand between you and my son at the risk of my own life."</p> 
               <p>Before Ashley could utter the furious reply that arose to his lips, a commotion was heard in the house, the door of the room was thrown wide open, and two negroes came in, bearing between them the apparently lifeless body of Maitland, dripping with water.</p> 
               <p>Laying him at the feet of his appalled parents, one of the men hastened to give the particulars of the disaster.</p> 
               <p>Maitland had obtained the pony, and gone out shooting mounted upon him; in defiance of the warning of the negro who usually accompanied him. While near the embankment that surrounded the pond, he fired his gun, into which he had put too large a load; the weapon recoiled, and frightened the pony, which plunged, and threw the lad over the terrace.</p> 
               <p>A thin surface of ice had formed on the pond, and Maitland went through it into the water; though an expert swimmer, the ice obstructed the motions of his rescuer to such a degree, that when he finally succeeded in drawing his young master from the pond, he was quite lifeless.</p> 
               <p>With his hair rising on his head, and eyes distended with horror, Ashley listened to this explanation. He cried out, in a wild tone:</p> 
               <p>"Retribution! retribution! Ernest Arden, in this hour you are avenged. I left you to perish when unable to help yourself from the wound my hand had given you, and my evil deed comes home to me in the fate of my son! Dead, dead, <emph>dead!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>And with the last words he fell forward in a fit.</p> 
               <p>Augusta was wildly shrieking over her son, but Hunter gently raised her, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Calm your anguish, Mrs. Ashley, for I am sure that I can save him for you. I am familiar with the treatment of<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6346-00000171"/> the drowned, and I am certain that the lad is only unconscious. A little effort will bring him round. You had better look to the condition of your husband."</p> 
               <p>The servants raised Ashley, whose livid face and labored breathing showed that he was attacked by apoplexy. He was removed to his bed, and a messenger dispatched for the family physician.</p> 
               <p>Hunter lost no time in commencing restorative measures with Maitland, and in an hour he was quite sensible; but his father never betrayed signs of consciousness again. He breathed for many hours, but that was all; and in spite of the medical skill brought to his assistance, Leon Ashley breathed his last on the next morning, followed to the land of shadows by not a single regret, unless the tender heart of his ill-treated daughter harbored one.</p> 
               <p>Evelyn remained beside him, and ministered to him to the last; when all was over, Wentworth took her in his arms, and bore her from the scene of death.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CONCLUSION.</head> 
               <p>But little more remains to be told.</p> 
               <p>Bessie did not act as bridesmaid to Miss Welby, nor did her own marriage take place quite so soon as was anticipated. Delancey was detained in Maryland by legal proceedings which were necessary on taking possession of the Arden estate, and resuming his family name.</p> 
               <p>When these were completed, and every preparation for immediate departure made, the wedding took place. Before that event, Mrs. Ashley had summoned courage to appear once more in her own family circle, and make the acquaintance of her intended son-in-law.</p> 
               <p>After many long conferences with Frank, who positively tively refused to reclaim the dower she enjoyed as the widow of Judge Ashley, it was settled that she should retain it. The personal property was settled on Augusta and her son, as a provision for them both. When Maitland went to a northern college his mother found a home near him; and his sister hopes that in time he will sow his wild oats and become a respectable and estimable member of society.</p> 
               <p>After placing his property under the care of a responsible agent, Ernest Delancey Arden, as he now styled himself, bore his bride and her mother to that beautiful southern land in which the ideal visions of beauty and art which floated through his mind were to find their realization and reward. Though endowed with fortune, the true artist did not give up his beloved profession, but pursued it with zest and success.</p> 
               <p>Wentworth and Evelyn took possession of Ashurst, where the quiet of perfect happiness compensates the young wife for the turbulent life she had passed beneath her father's roof. In a few years Hunter came back to end his days at Ashurst, and in petting the fair children that clustre around the hearth of the happy homestead he finds some consolation for his own joyless and wasted life.</p>
