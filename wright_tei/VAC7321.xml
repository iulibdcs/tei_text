RANDOLPH: 121 MAIN STREET, RICHMOND, VA. 1855.  &#xD;<pb n="0" xml:id="VAC7321-00000002"/> ENTERED ACCORDING TO ACT OF CONGRESS IN THE YEAR 1855, BY J. W. RANDOLPH, IN THE CLERK S OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES IN AND FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA. WYNNE, PRINTER,  No. 04 Main Street, "Gordon's Corner," Biochmond   EDITH ALLEN. C- apter     R eu NEARLY fifty years ago, a young man bade adieu to old "William and Mary College," at Williamsburg. A good- natured, ardent, generous boy, he had been popular with his school-fellows to a dangerous extent. He had been unequalled for gayety, open-heartedness and liberality-nay, prodigality; and even while yet a school boy, being wild and reckless, ex- citable and eager, trusting and unsuspicious, he was already marked as a prize by the harpies, who fleece, prey and batten upon the substance of foolish prodigals. College follies and extravagances are but too readily over- looked and forgiven, where there has been nothing disgraceful leaving a deeper stain. But the continued thoughtless wild- ness and fool-hardy dissipation of Briscoe Letar, soon gave much uneasiness to those who were disposed to feel an,interest in the young man's fate, and won for him an unenviable repu- tation in his native county. In old letters and papers, which we have had the opportunity of consulting, we find the name variously written: Le Tr^s, Le Tree, Lettray, and otherwise. It is manifestly of French origin; but his ancestors, as far back as was known, had resided in England, until his grand- father had sought to mend his fortunes in this country, and   &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7321-00000003"/> 4         EDITH ALLEN; OR, purchased land in the then colony of Virginia, and "settled" upon the property, which, with his name, had been handed down to Briscoe, his now sole surviving descendant. It was Briscoe Letar's "heritage of woe" to have been left at an early age "lord of himself,"-though as regards his other heritage, an honest and careful guardian had judiciously attended to the interests of his ward; exerting too, while he lived, a salutary restraint upon him. But, unfortunately, this good old friend had suddenly died while Briscoe was yet at college, and the young scape-grace was left to himself. Horse-racing, cock-fighting, -and other species of gambling then fashionable, with fox-hunting, convivial gatherings and carousals, were the chief occupations of his time, even before he had put off the semblance of mourning for this lamented friend. It was told him once, at length, that a Presbyterian divine- in private conversation however-had alluded to him, and others of his stripe, as "poor, godless youths, whose folly cried aloud," and as "vessels of wrath fitted todestruction." On thd next Sabbath, the young Lothario, with some of his fellows, attended church, for the purpose of finding something to sneer at and ridicule. But while standing at the church door, he saw a lovely young lady pass by him and enter, who appeared to him verily "a form of life and light,"-a being he had dreamed of-or rather, seemed to have dreamed of- but never beheld before. Let it suffice, that he did not con- duct himself amiss during the sermon, otherwise than by gazing too constantly at this beautiful young girl. "Who is she?" "Who! Mary Stacey!" What! was it possible? It seemed incredible, that the lit- tle sun-burnt school girl, whom he had known some five years before-had scarcely noticed indeed, as he then had thought her an ugly, unpromising little thing-had grown to be so lovely a creature. Yet, after gazing awhile, it was sufficiently evident. There was in her bewitching features a likeness to her father, Colonel Stacey, and to her mother-both of whom   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA. he knew-and, indeed, to her little brother, who was seated not far from him. He presently wondered too, how he could, long ago, have been so blind, as not to have seen that little Mary Stacey had under her sun-bonnet, whenever she could be made to wear it, and above her pinaofre, which was clean and tidy only at intervals, a face in which were all the unde- veloped elements of singular beauty. It is, indeed, surprising how, in the course of a lustrum, a miserably homely, gawky creature is sometimes refined and expanded into-what shall we say?-a lovely enchantress,--such as "the sons of God," in olden times, looked upon and saw to be fair. The gawki- ness, sun-burnt skin, with or without freckles-the blowsy, broken hair, are thrown aside, as the shell of the chrysalis or the hibernacle of the blossom. A miraculous metamorphosis is wrought, and the beautiful young thing, with her long silken, modest, down-cast eyelashes-few are without these- wins us to gaze, to admire, and to adore. Female beauty is a relic of old Eden. Long before a sermon not remarkable for its brevity, though it seemed short to Briscoe Letar, was concluded, he felt in his very heart that he had seen "her who was his des- tiny." Others, it may be, did not notice how frequently his eye was turned towards her, but Mary Stacey herself more than once caught his admiring glance. She remembered him very well, and were the truth known, we imagine, though of this we cannot be confident, she did not think him very im- pertinent in so gazing at her. It was not an unusual circum- stance for herself to be gazed at, and his glance was evidently indicative of earnest, respectful admiration. The sermon was at length over, the doxology sung, the benediction said. He watched her while she left the house, attended by a handsome young stranger; he saw her depart; he gazed after the carriage which bore her away, as long as it could be seen; he looked back where she had been; glanced along the ground over which she had passed, and at length, as a heavy feeling of utter loneliness came over him, he hastened homewards alone, sad and reflective. As with the ,/ /],}  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7321-00000004"/> 6  -       EDITH ALLEN; OK,           ,  eye, when a glaring light is suddenly removed, so with his heart. The light which had dazzled it, pierced into its hidden depths, was gone, and all was gloom. But these feelings are known far better than they can be told. We presume that there be few who do not at some time or other, to a greater or a less extent, experience them. With sight of her, a new phase of life broke at once upon him, and love took full possession of all young Letar's powers. He shut himself up from his late boisterous com- panions. He took long and solitary rambles, shunning obser- vation like a thief. On mossy banks he sate him down, and f;under greenwood trees, indulging in crowding visions of de- lightful circumstances, in which he defended, and otherwise rendered service to fair Mary Stacey; in which- he shone res- plendent before her in superhuman superiority-won her  admiration-became a hero in her eyes. At one time, he was the chief of mighty armies, leading conquering hosts  over desperate fields, doing marvelous deeds of personal valor, winning laurel-crowned' fame, and world-wide renown-only to lay his chaplets and his glory at her feet, and say, "Sweet Mary, all this have I achieved for you!"At another time, with hitherto unheard-of eloquence, he was commanding the eager ears of rapt multitudes, swaying men's hearts as the tempest sways the forests, electrifying nations, with his vivid thoughts. Again, the untold "wealth of Ormus and of Ind." was his, and Mary Stacey was bedecked with jewels which far outshone the gems of Golconda; while dearer to her than gems, or riches, or power, or fame, was the love of Briscoe Letar. Oh! very rare are the freaks of a young lover's fancy. The wildest imaginative vagaries of moon-struck poet, frenzied " past a remead," are, compared with them, probable, feasible and reasonable. At other times, the love dreams of young Letare were more moderate and less pretending in their character. What were wealth and fame, or worldly cares and worldly men, to him or to her whom he loved?    She was all to him-he would be all to her. What more could be desired?    For   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA,       7 him, he felt, that the desert were a paradise, if she were there. A hut in the wilderness, far from men and men's dwellings, (and he had a distaste for all other society than hers,) were enough for him--were all he could ask.  He began to count the hours which, would intervene before he might see her again. Eagerly did he long for the next Sab- bath; and bitter was his disappointment, when it dawned a rainy, tempestuous day. Dreams, like these we have men- tioned, took possession of him; but soon there arose the reflection that they were only dreams. Life was worthless which was unconnected with her; nay, intolerable. Thoughts were wearisome, blank and dull, which did not point to her. What was he to do?  Could he win her?  What were his chances? And now most bitterly did he begin to regret all his wildness, when he reflected that Mary Stacey belonged to a rigidly moral and religious family. Perhaps, indeed, he thought, it might not be so great a matter with her, Mary; for he had found that his reputation for gaiety, had sometimes rather stood him in good stead, than otherwise, with the young girls with whom he had for the most part been thrown; but he had doubts as to how her parents might look upon him. He had not seen much of the Colonel, or Mrs. Stacey, for a good while.  They had been especial friends of his father, and feeling that his wild courses were wholly opposed to all their notions of propriety, he had hitherto rather avoided intercourse with them. If he feared themn as his father's old friends, how much more as the parents of Mary. He was much accustomed to exercise on horse-back. It is worthy of notice that his horse's head was now invariably directed towards the north, and as this was the direction in which Col. Stacey resided, it is not surprising that, though the distance was six good miles, he frequently in his excursions caught sight of the grove of fine old trees which grew around Stacey Home. Another week passed by of as fine, pretty weather as man could wish, and another Sabbath came; but, alas! worse, if possible, than the preceding.       l  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7321-00000005"/> 8         EDITH ALLEN j OR, "What confounded luck," he muttered, when he first awak- ened. "It is always sure to rain on the very day when one especially wishes fair weather. Butthis is no more than my accustomed luck! When I was a schoolboy it used ever to rain on holidays!"-If we may believe schoolboys, St. Swithin is still unfriendly in this respect, frowning frequently on their pleasures. But if fortune seemed adverse on this, she nevertheless relented on the next day. As he rode musingly along, he came suddenly at a turn of the road upon Col. Stacey. "Well, Briscoe, my boy," cried out the friendly old man, "How are you? I am glad to meet with you, and here by ourselves; H-I have for a long time wished to have a friendly chat with you. Your father was one of the best friends I ever had, Briscoe; and it has grieved me, my dear boy, to hear that you continue so wild, and are, as some say --forgive me Briscoe!--they do say that you are-ruined. Now turn in, my dear boy-turn in, I ask you, as your father's old friend, and prove these croakers to be false! Won't your now?"-and Col. Stacey took his hand affec- tionately. The young man's eyes were wet with tears of shame and gratitude. He was choked; he could scarcely speak. Col. Stacey," he said in a broken voice,---"I have been thinking of all this-and--and have resolved to alter my course.' "God bless you, my dear fellow! and strengthen your resolves! I was glad to see you at church the other Sunday. It did my heart good, and you may be sure that you have my best wishes, and those of all good men, for your welfare. I was a little afraid to speak to you, for I fancied that you seemed to shun me, and it hurt me, and I feared it might do harm rather than good for me to speak to you about this; but I am so glad now that I did. My heart told me that the son of Bernard Letare ought to take my admonition in good part." "I thank you--thank you from my heart, Col. Stacey, for   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA,       9 this interest in me, and I will endeavor to deserve it on my own account. If I seemed to shun you, sir, it was-it was on account of-of-" "Oh, yes, yes, I understand: you will not do so again. By the by, Briscoe, some of the young folks will be at my house on Wednesday-no party-only a little gathering in a social way. I love to see the young folkstogether. Won't you ride over and dine with us then? There's no one at home to-day, and I am hastening on to Blankville, to give some directions about the sale of- my tobacco. So good-bye!" And the kind old man, feeling the interview a little embar- rassing, took leave. Letar returned home in vaulting spirits. He vowed, more than once, that Col. Stacey was a capital old fellow. After an unusual degree of care and pains as to the suita- ble adornment of his person, Letar appeared, on Wednesday, at Stacey Home, a well dressed, fine looking young man. He there met with nearly all the youth of the neighborhood be- longing to the intelligent families; in all some half dozen girls, and as many young gentlemen, with one or two others, whom he knew. 'There were there, too, young Miss Allen and her brother, the same whom he had seen with Mary on the Sunday before commemorated, connections of Mrs. Stacey, from an adjoining county, strangers to him. As for Mary, he found her, if possible, yet more lovely than his fond fancy had painted her; and she had already cast on him a spell which would not have been easily broken. Love, in its incipient stages, is frequently checked by the observance of some little gaucherie, which, but for its timely detection, would have become, when discovered in a more ad- vanced progress of the disease, but another winning beauty to the lover's spell-bound eye. In Mary Stacey, however, even a critical eye could have detected nothing to carp or sneer at. In her deportment she was free and easy, yet exceedingly lady-like. In manners, affable and winning, with, perhaps, a soupqon of coquetry in the play of her merry, mischief-working eye. At least, a  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7321-00000006"/> 10         EDITH ALLEN; OR, good many dangerous glances did she cast upon Letare, quick, sly and effective, in the course of their further acquaintance. On this immediate occasion, however, most of her attention was bestowed upon young Allen and his sister, who, a visit of some weeks' continuance being over, expected to leave Stacey Home on the morrow. Her attention to them was quite natu- ral, and to be expected, as they were strangers in the county, as well as relatives of her mother. She was on very familiar terms with them, having lived at, their father's for the last two years, where she had been at school. Nevertheless, she found time to meet Letare's advances to an acquaintanceship, in a manner which this young gentleman flattered himself was particularly friendly. "When I saw you at Spring Hill," (the name of the church,) "a few Sabbaths since," Letare said to Maryi during the after- noon, as for a moment he found himself by her side in a cor- ner of the room, where she was turning over some music, "will you believe that I did not recognize you at all?" He conceived that there was a slight, an almost impercepti- ble flush on her cheek.  She replied with a mischievous smile: "But I do not apprehend that you will soon forget me again, Mr. Letare." He started.  'I understand you, Miss Stacey," he said, coloring. "You had grown, changed so much since I had seen you before.  At least, if I gazed at you, the fault was your own; for-Oh, no   indeed, I shall never' forget you again." , She looked up at him with something of a pleased surprise, as his words, intended to be expressed in gaiety, were, in spite of himself, uttered with a peculiar earnestness. It was after this that she began to turn on him those quick, sly, mischief- working glances. There was present a pensive, retiring young lady, Miss El- len Transmere, who sat apart from the rest, amusing herself with some engravings. No one appeared to notice her much, nor did she seem to wish to attract attention, as although she   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      " replied civilly whenever any remark was addressed to her, yet she was instantly absorbed again in the engravings. Conse- quently, though quite a pretty girl, she was left a good deal to herself. In the course of the afternoon, a stroll upon the lawnvbeing proposed, was instantly acceded to by every one, though Miss Transmere seemed to leave her engravings with some reluc- tance. They moved along over the smooth lawn, associated in groups, as the number of ladies exceeded .'that of the gentle- men. It was the rare loveliness of the day which had tempted them out. Indeed, Nature, seemed to have put on her holiday robes, while a balmy, blue atmosphere hung dreamily over all, like a diaphanous gossamer overskirt. We believe that our meaning will be apprehended, though we own to consummate ignorance as regards feminine paraphernalia, except that we pique ourselves upon detecting at a glance anything like false taste in the adjustment. On the present occasion, though we risk the disinterment of an old figure, Nature's habiliments were tastefully donned, and gracefully worn. Never any where else, than in Old Virginia, was there ever an evening more pleasant, benign and lovely, than the one in question. Our company of young people /had wandered on beyond where "the lawn" was succeeded by cultivated fields. They had crossed the highway, and pursuing a firm, smooth, graveled ' caft-road," around the hills, colme to a point where, in a clump of young wild growthl, three ways met. It was a lovely spot, and numbers of wild flowers were growing all around about. Here they had paused for awhile, and then pursued their way homeward by a different route, which was pointed out by Mary Stacey as one of her favorite walks. The contemplative Miss Transmere lingered for a moment be- 1hind with the wild flowers. She was leaning over a cluster of drooping harq-bells, thinking: but who can tell what were her maiden meditations, while she scanned the delicately tinted little monopetalous campaniform flowers? Suddenly she was startled by a discordant hallooing and shouts, in an opposite direction from that in which her companions had gone; and  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7321-00000007"/> 12     '   EDITH ALLEN  OR, as she arose to her feet the fearful cry, "mad dog!"' mad dog!" met her ear, and close upon her she saw a large yellow cur, tottering along in a broken gallop directly towards her, his mouth and head all covered with foam and blood, and his large, glaring eyes looking like balls of fire. The pursuers of the dog had descried her companions, though they could not see her, and were shouting to warn them. Letari with young Allen and Mary Stacey, were the very hindermost of the party. They were in high glee, at some humorous remark of hers, when shriek upon shriek, near them, mingled with this frightful cry in the distance, met their ears. Letar bounded back towards the shrieking girl. He stopped. There was a tall new fence just on their left. "The fence!" he cried to Mary. "To the fence!"   Again he flew towards Miss Trans- mere. That poor girl, escaping as best she might from the dread danger which threatened her, no sooner saw him near her, than her feeble powers utterly failed, and she sank down fainting. The terrible animal was actually snapping at her dress, when Letard reached her, and kicked him  to the dis- ta:nce of a dozen paces. He seized the lifeless girl in his arms, and was flying with her, when young Allen came to his assistance. The dog, weakened by disease, and several gun- shot wounds, had tottered and rolled over by the force of the blow. But he had once more gained his feet, and was blindly staggering after them, when the keen report of a rifle was heard, and with a mournful howl he tumbled down. The ball had entered his shoulder. His pursuers soon came up and dispatched him. In the meantime our affrighted company, who had for the most part sought refuge on the fence, now collected. Allen 'had said to iary, "Let me aid you," as she sought the fence, but she cried out, "No, no! go to her! I shall be safe;" and with all the speed of which he was master, he hurried after Letar, gathering up a bludgeon as he went. Miss Transmere, after a time, was recovered from her swoon, but a goodly quantity of yellow ditch water had been first ap- plied to her fair face, and was streaming down her bedraggled   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      13 tresses, as she was borne to the house upon the arms of two gentlemen. Night was now fast approaching. Many of the young la- dies Who had come to Stacey Home, thinking only to spend the day, were now, a mad dog panic having seized them, making arrangements to pass the night there. Indeed, few were bold enough to venture out just yet, even shut up in carriages; and doubly and trebly escorted; as they could not but conceive that a mad animal infested each lane and turn, and was concealed under every bush. The boys had fair op- portunity to shew their gallantry; but Letar, thinking, per- -haps, that he had exhibited enough for one day, rode home alone, although hints were not wanting that his escort would be acceptable. He was pressed, too, to remain at Stacey Home. He reserved to himself, however, the pleasure of calling on the next day. When he did so, he found that the Allens and all other visitors were gone, save the fair object of his rescue, Miss Ellen Transmere; who, indeed, was quite at home at Col. Stacey's. This modest young lady received hint very gratefully, overwhelming him with thanks. These he gallantly warded off, or received as best he might. It was certainly an awful peril from which he had rescued her, and she could not be otherwise than thankful. In the fullness of her gratitude she forgot her books, with which she, had been engaged when he arrived-she was, as he found, a constant reader, in season and out of season-and also the fascinating engravings of yesterday, and devoted herself to the best of her abilities to his entertainment. During his stay, which was short, he did not see Mary. Upon his exit, however, he by chance met her in the passage; and even to his partial eye she did not appear to great advantage. He paused for a few moments with her, but she seemed thoughtful and abstracted; her eyes were red, and her smile feeble; in short, she was complaining of headache, and told him that she had been suffering during the whole preceding night. This he had learned before, from the timid Miss Transmere. When he next met with Mary, however, she was as bright  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7321-00000008"/> "  -EDITH -ALLEN; OR, and beautiful as ever; even more attractive, Letar thought,  for he had now better opportunity than before of gaining her undivided attention; and with a light playfulness of spirit, and with a quick apprehension, which charmed him, she joined in and listened to the half-humorous, half-serious strain of conversation, which characterized their intercourse in the earlier progress of their acquaintance. Gayety seemed to be his predominant trait; but in his communings with her, it soon came to be a gayety touched with sentiment. Some- times, in his lively sallies, his piquant humor, even while her clear laugh, which it elicited, was yet ringing, would: merge at once into something so like tenderness as to excite a blush. But, on the other hand, too, a poetical sentiment would some- times, by a word, be converted into droll farce. He had nothing of the forward pertness which, in would-be wits, is so contemptible and disgusting; on the contrary, his manner was ever modest and respectful in a pleasing degree. Despite of the fright with the mad dog, the gathering at Stacey Home had proved so pleasant and agreeable, that it was soon followed by others, and "gatherings" became quite popular and fashionable; and as they afforded only a little in- nocent amusement, and especially as the "old folks" enjoyed these meetings fully as much as the young, no objection was 'raised against them, and they became quite frequent in the neighborhood. Letare and Mary Stacey were much together. He ever sought her- side, or when circumstances prevented this, he was usually to be found in the corner, where Miss Trahsmere sat with her book. The book was closed and laid aside whenever he approached, as it was not at -the approach of any other in- dividual. She was, as we have said, civil to every one who addressed -her in conversation; but in general, shewed that, she endured, rather than enjoyed their advances. But she evidently seemed to desire to please Letare, and while he was with her, would converse freely. When he would leave her, however, the book was at once resumed; nor would she look after him.   SKETCIIES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      -1. 5 On one occasion, at the house of a Mr. Evans Letare was with Mary. He had sought her as usual upon his entry. The two were now become quite familiar; though many a lit- tle sign, and many a tender sentiment, edged in when none others could hear, had, before this, plainly enough indicated his partiality for her. On this occasion they were rather apart to themselves, and he had been with her for some time. '"Go, now," she said- to him, "I have detained you long enouogh. I know you are pining to spealk to Ellen." "And you are tired of me?" "Yes. That is-indeed-we are too much together. It does not look well, you know; and there's Mr. Fitzgerald, too, who is wishing to speak to me." "Ah, 4hat alters the case. But, is Fitzgerald not as often with you, and as much as I?" "No; and if so, what?" "Oh, nothing. But may I comeback soon?" "Yes-after awhile." Letare did not yield his place very willingly to Fitzgerald, who was evidently a warm admirer of the fair Mary; but he now left her side and moved along, speaking'to every one as he passed in a gay, good-natured way, until he reached Miss Transmere, who was sitting near a table with a book in her hand, as usual. "Ah, Miss Ellen, that eternal book! I am sorry to interrupt you, but do so advisedly. Surely it iS well to lay it aside some- times, even if you,do so ruefully, for your health's sake, and for the sake of those bright eyes, which 'twere a pity to dim." "You are mistaken, sir." "In what particular?" In much that you have said." - "Said'! Pray, when?" "When? Why, just at this moment, of course. You surely cannot imagine that I should treasure up your old mistakes?" "Mercy! Now, Miss Ellen, one would think that I had been entertaining you for ever so long, whereas, I had only uttered one sentence. Mistaken in much that I said?"  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7321-00000009"/> 16        EDITH ALLEN; OR, "Yes. In the first place, this is not the Bible, the only book which can be called eternal." "Corrected, I am," bowing.  "And, secondly, if you please." "Well, secondly--nay, I will be mercifuland say finally- it is not ruefully laid aside. I say this in return for your kind regard for my health." "And bright eyes-why forget them?" "And eyes," said Miss Transmere, coloring slightly. Something across the room attracted their attention for a moment. "Miss Ellen," he presently said, i"I wish to ask you as a friend," (she looked up) "whether---I mean, do you think that I am-am very much with Miss Mary Stacey?" She started surprised. "As a friend: Yes, too much-too much, if you only knew-- " "Too much-too much, if I only knew-what?" asked Letare, who had been struck with the earnest manner in which she had commenced replying to this query. "Oh, if you only knew what was for your good," she said in a gay tone.  Young gentlemen little think what risks they run by such temerity." "And was that what you at first intended saying?" "Surely, what else could I say?-But what led you, sir, to ask my opinion?" "Why, simply the fact that Miss Mary drove me from her awhile since, saying that she was tired of me," answered he laughing. "Ah, indeed!-and I am   excessively obliged to her for your -agreeable company"---looking at the book which she had laid aside. "Nay, nay, Miss Ellen; she gave as one reason for doing so, that she saw that I was pining to come over to you." "Mr. Letar!" "Fact-upon honor-ask her." a Well, not in doubt of your word, yet we will refer it to her, as here she is."   SKETCHES OF' LIFE IN VIKGINIA.      17 "What is it?" asked Mary. "Miss Ellen thinks, and intimates, that I seek her side only for the reason that I can go no where else. Now, were you not saying just before I left you, that I was pining to come to her?" "Certainly. It was too evident to be questioned. I beg your pardon. Miss Transmere-Mr. Fitzgerald. But does she think that you are welcome no where else? Poor fellow! I pity you!" "And 'Pity' has a relative, 'is akin '-you know." "Ah! but it is surprising how relatives sometimes differ." "^ Well, for my part, I am partial to this whole connection." That afternoon, as Mary Stacey's carriage, which she occu- pied alone, rolled off, Letar's steed was prancing along beside it. They had not gone far, however, when the clatter of a horse's hoofs was heard. "Here comes that Fitzgerald!" he said. 'Confound the the man! does he wish to be with you all the time?" Hush! you must not say naughty words. He exhibits good taste, does he. not?" "I certainly can say nothing against taste so much like my own," he replied, as Fitzgerald reined up at the other carriage window. Mary was exceedingly agreeable, being in a fine flow of spirits this evening; and she smiled now on this side, now on that, bestowing her favors very impartially upon the rivals. Fitzgerald had taken it into his head--indeed, it was a gen- eral impression-that Letare was a lover of Miss Transmere; and one might have conceived that Mary Stacey thought so too, from the manner in Which she now and then during this evening "teased" him about that young lady. "You do well, Mr. Letarg, to remain silent. It would be utterly needless for you to make denial:--or for her either, for that matter."-  This last was said with something like a sneer. "Now, I do not understand you, Miss Mary. Mqy I ask your meaning?"  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7321-00000010"/> 18         EDITH ALLEN ; OR, "I mean-well, for one -instance of exemplification: you wore a locket of hers." "Admitted. . But what of that? She did not give it to me                    ' "Only permitted you to take it--I am aware." "Well, I certainly see no great harm in that?" "Oh, certainly not. No harm. Who said that there was? But no gentleman should wear a locket of mine," looking at a miniature of her father which hung from her neck,--" unless -unless- ' "What?-unless he had your heart with it?" "I meant something of that sort." "Oh, Miss Transmere is less scrupulous. She- knows very well that I have no pretensions to her; and, indeed, so does Aliss Mary." "Oh, every one knows what a plea of "not guilty"' is worth in Cupid's Court." This was after they had arrived at Stacey Home. They had there found, on a business visit, a Mr. Brandt, a lawyer- a good-natured, pleasant gentleman of forty-five or fifty years of age. He heard Slary's last remark, and coming over to where they sat: "What is it," he asked, "that you are saying of Not' Guilty, and Love's Court You speak of pleas and courts; -professional curiosity must be my excuse, if I intrude. I hope I do not." "Oh, not at all," said Mary, making room for him. "Not at all, sir. I am glad that you have joined us," said Letare.  A short time since, sir, in this very room, and on that table, I saw lying a little trinket, the property of a young lady, a friend of mine. With playful impudence. I appropriated it. She permitted me to retain it, until I met with her again, to-wit: for the space of two whole days. Now, not only is my impudence construed into an evidence of partiality for her; but. her kind forbearance, in permitting me to retain the locked for a time, is made the ground of an imputation, which I feel called upon to defend. Have I stated the case fairly and truly, Miss Mary??"   SKETCUiES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       19 "Yes. Not quite fully, perhaps. It should be said, that this young lady is no other than Miss Ellen Transmere. Every one has heard of her whilom   rescue from extreme peril, by Mr. Letar's gallant interposition; and every one, since that time, naturally conceives that gentleman's place to be at her side, where, indeed, he is usually to be found. With these general corroborative facts, I think, sir, that you, have the case before you." Every one was struck with the half-knowing, half-quizzical look of the old lawyer, as he listened to this story of the locket and Miss Transmere. When called on for his opinion, however, he playfully excused himself, on the plea of being an old bachelor, and knowing nothing of such matters; but he watched, with a keen eye, Letart's defence of Miss Trans- mcre's whole conduct, since the time when he had first be- come acquainted with her; which, he maintained, had only been lady-like and modest in the extreme. Nor could the fact, said he, that she treated him with particular considera- tion, be construed, except by an ungenerous contortion, of which he knew that Miss Mary could not be guilty, into any thing more than a sense of obligation. It becomes us to tell, that Mr. Brandt had, a few days before this, found, under very peculiar circumstances, some unfinished verses, addressed to a locket-we are sorry not to be able to furnish a copy-in which the writer, with poetical conceit, inquires of the trinket, what were the secrets of the manly breast over which it had lately been suspended?--im- ploring the dumb thing to tell, provided said secrets were such as maiden's ear might greet, nor give her pain to hear, etc. The peculiar circumstances under which he had found these verses, were as follows: The great-the interesting case of the term of court, which was just past, was that of "Peter- son vs. Quillet," in which Mr. Brandt was sole counsel for the defendant. It had been laid over from  the preceding term  by consent, with the express understanding that it should be tried at this. Owing to the interesting character  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7321-00000011"/> 20        :EDITH AiLEN; OR, of this suit, and the large amount of property depending upon its decision, Mr Brandt had felt himself called- upon to make unusual exertions, in studying the case and preparing for its trial. It was supposed that he would make the great speech of his life, in the trial of this suit. When the great case had at length been called; when most of the preliminaries were gone through with; while the jurymen were seating themselves, Mr. Brandt laid open his budget of papers, notes, etc., labelled "Quillet and Peterson ;" when, the first among them which caught his eye, to his utter surprise, was a blotched and scarcely legible copy of verses, addressed to a locket, in an unknown hand-writing. We will mention, incidentally, that after the trial had gone on, much evidence been taken, weighed and stowed away, in notes, etc., and when " powerful and effective speeches " had been made on both sides, much whispering ensued, and by a proposition from the plaintiff's counsel, a juryman was, by permission, withdrawn, and the case compromised. Of course the defendant's counsel would not have acceded to this, but for the very satisfactory nature of the terms proposed. The copy of verses had, at the time of their discovery, been hastily thrust aside. Mr. Brandt kept the circumstance quietly to himself, for he saw at a glance what a handle for jest and raillery it would afford to his brethren of the bar- ever, from time immemorial, it has been so, a jocose set- were it to be divulged, that such a paper was found among his notes. But where, in the name of sense, had the thing come from? was a question he had asked himself a hundred times. He had now, however, found a clue to this mystery. ,, Mr. Blundell was a connection, and the guardian of Miss Transmere. Mr. Brandt had spent the night before court at his house, having some business with him. ' But he had retired early to his room, wishing to make some preparation in his cases, particularly in the interesting case of Peterson vs. Quillet. Late in the night, it struck him that a passage, which he but half remembered, from Shakspeare, would serve him aptly as a quotation; and he went forthwith to the parlor, 1   '%*        SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      21 where he had seen a copy of his plays. As he entered at one door, he caught a glimpse of something white, retreating by the other. On the table was Shakspeare, and by the volume, he now recollected that he had seen an open standish of ink, and a pen, moist with the black fluid, lying beside it. He copied that night more 'than one quotation from the immortal bard, and feeling at length sleepy, gathered up his papers, hurriedly labelled them, and betook himself to bed. The next morning, he was struck with Ellen's manner; but she had ever been a singular girl, and he thought no more of it; now, however, it was recalled to him. The lines were evi- dently Ws. Hearing him coming, she had slipped them into the copy of Shakspeare, and retreated. He had taken the book off to his own room, and, poor girl! she thought that he had discovered her lines. It was not to be wondered at-her confused manner of meeting him in the morning.  Now, had Mr. Brandt seen the lines at the time, he would have felt it indelicate to read them; .but as they had, by a strange mis- chance, gotten into the case of Peterson vs. Quillet, it is not to be supposed that he afterwards felt any such scruples. It was a strange mischance, that by which the midnight scrib- blings of a young girl thus fell into an old lawyer's hands.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7321-00000012"/> 22         EDITII ALLEN; OR, WE now turn to Miss Ellen Transmere. She had ever been a still, retiring little thing, even in early childhood. Her first recollections were of the sick room of her- mother. She was not quite three years old, nor could she at all remem- ber the circumstance, when her father was brought home on a litter, one bright summer morning, to die at the threshold of his house, one of the many victims of a "code of honor" by which a ruffian, by first insulting a gentleman, obtains a war- rant to shoot at him. Her mother never recovered from the shock. She lingered on, indeed, until Ellen's ninth year, a nervous, helpless, broken-spirited, poor invalid, dying for six weary years. It was solely for Ellen's sake that she - at all clung to life; and she died, committing her child, with her last breath, to her sister-in-law, Mrs. Blundell. The ground color was stamped upon Ellen's life in that nervous invalid's chamber. It was of a sombre hue. . Her aunt was as kind to her as it was possible to be'; but her tenderness was of the indulgent sort, which allowed the staid, quiet little orphan, when the first terrible outhreak of grief was past, to do just what she pleased. - Mr. Blundell himself did not at all un- derstand the child. He neither liked, nor disliked her, though, as his wife's pet, the silent child had his favor, and, as the heiress of "a comfortable little fortune," to use his own expression, his respect. Ellen glided about the house like a noiseless spirit--had little to say, and, young as she was, was never so well satisfied as when off to herself.' Her mother had taught her to read--had praised her taste   SKETCHES OF LIFE  IN VIRGINIA. '     23 for books. Many an hour had the child spent in reading to that sick mother. It had been with her a love offering. And now, when that mother was gone, with the little orphan reading was a duty--her religion. When she was twelve years of age, another great grief befell her. Her aunt was smitten down by a malignant dis- ease, which pervaded the community, and which left a gap in many a family. This loss was almost too much for little Ellen. Her grief was overwhelming. It seemed as if she belonged to an. ill-fated race. Her grand-father had been killed in war; two uncles had perished at sea. Her father had been murdered; dragging her mother after him, through a long course of suffering, to the grave. And now her aunt was gone! Deep gloom came over the child's spirits. Sihe would sit for hours, motionless, gazing into vacancy. But we hurry over this period. She was removed from Mr. Blundell's to Col. Stacey's, by the kind interposition of Mrs. Stacey. Here, her grief was respected, and she was left much to her will; but the genial influence of social compan- ionship was brought to bear upon her, and in time its effects were felt. She learned with surprising celerity.  In house- hold matters, at this time considered of great importance in female education, she shewed not much interest, doing, how- ever, whatever was allotted her. - Her gloominess by degrees left her, and she became cheerful and happy, and was with all her school-fellows a favorite, though every one pronounced her to be an odd girl. She had resided at Col. Stacey's until Mary was sent to Mr. Allen's, in another county. . She very much wished Ellen to go with her:! but Mr. Blundell would not hear of it. He insisted that Ellen was sufficiently well educated; or if not, that she could teach herself. He. de- clared that she had learned more when by herself, than she had since done at school. Besides, it would be a pity to spend the money. Her money was now safely invested, so as to yield a good per centage-- Mr. Brandt and he had arranged this; and every dollar spent now was a dead loss, which would be felt when she came of age, or was married.  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7321-00000013"/> 24  /       EDITH ALLEN; OR, She must come back to his house--her home. She had her own rooms there, and could do just as she chose-study, or not. Blundell and his wife-he had married again, for the third time-'were both very kind to her; and Ellen, in truth, did not much wish to go to Mr. Allen's, an entire stranger; although she was unwilling .to part with Mary Stacey. So she was once more installed in her own rooms, at Mr. Blundell's, where she led, for the most part, a quiet, happy life, doing, indeed, just as she chose. Though she was an odd girl, she was, as we have said, a favorite with, all her companions. They had first known her when she was an object of pity. They were accustomed to her ways, and, by a geheral consent, these were, for the most part, tacitly allowed. She was good-natured, gentle and kind; though she had, too, with all her unobtrusive quiet- ness, a firmness of character, which commanded their respect. As to her reading, she herself said, that it was only a habit. It seemed necessary to her to have something in her hands, and before her eyes; and as it was a habit, the indulgence in which cost her nothing, with those who knew her, and whose esteem she desired, she saw no necessity for overcoming it. Reading was no worse, surelyi than knitting, sewing, embroid- ery, and the like, and might be borne with, as they were. Others would say, "Oh, it's only Ellen's way; she was always a singular girl:" and no one seemed to object to the habit, except Mr. Blundell's daughter, Mrs. Jones, whom she did not see often, as she resided at a considerable distance. We have seen, with Mr. Brandt, that Ellen was sometimes guilty of penning verses. This was a folly, however, which she did not very often indulge in. Yet she did what was, perhaps,- as silly: she kept a private journal. From that period, however, a very perceptible change began to be manifested. It was very natural that she should make- some record of her terrible fright, and of her timely rescue from the raving dog; and that her gratitude to God, and thanks to her gallant preserver, should have, found a place for their free and full expression on the pages, which she thought   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       25 no eye but hers would ever trace. In glancing over this jour- nal, we find that in the next entry after this, it is mentioned, that she had-again met with this "gallant preserver;" and she expresses her fear that she had not been sufficiently warm in the exhibition of-her thanks to him. In the next, she says, that she had once more seen him; and then follows a record of what he said on this occasion. And this time she hints a fear that she had been unlady-like in the profuseness of her thanks, for what he evidently regarded as a mere per- formance of duty, and did not remember as a personal service; and she closes with the reflection, that it would be indelicate to refer to it again. In one place, she wonders if her grati- tude is not leading her to exhibit unwarrantable familiarity with him.  In another, she fears she is constrained and cold in her manner towards him.   But, ah! she- is an odd, poor girl!-how she wishes that she was not! "He is a great deal more free and familiar in his intercourse with Mary Stacey. I wonder if he thinks that I am ungrateful? He must not think so." And as the months go on, other things are at length entirely forgotten, and there is in this journal a constant reference to Letar --the places where she meets with him-how he looks, etc. She records whatever he says to her, and her replies; with sharp strictures sometimes upon these last. How could she be so silly!  What would he think of her! She notices that, soon after some remark which she thus stigmatized, he had left her and gone over to Mary Stacey. She believes that he likes Mary better than herself. Ah, she was a poor, odd girl! Mary was so beautiful, too. She wonders if others think him handsome?' Mary Stacey pretends to think  that he is not. She believes it's all pretence. Indeed, she does not think that Mary has improved much at Mr. Allen's. She does not please her so well as she used to do. However, Mary is a dear, good girl--her best, her dearest friend, and she will not find fault with her.

I pity him! Is it possible that he can  be so careless about his affairs?--a man of his unques- tionable sense, in many respects? And his father left him such a  fine estate-Uncle Blundell says.

During the six months, of which we have thus only caught passing glimpses, Briscoe Letar had improved his acquaint- ance with Mary Stacey, as we have seen, to intimacy. He was with her constantly, whenever he could be, both at her father's house, and elsewhere; avoiding, however, as far as he could, the appearance of seeking to cultivate any particular intimacy with her, or of shewing for her any especial partial- ity. He was the more guarded in this, as he was aware that his footing in society-for which he had hitherto cared not at all-was somewhat precarious, owing to the wild courses in which he had, during his collegiate career at William and Mary, and since his return, openly and recklessly indulged. Diodorus tells of a mode of judgment at Syracuse, by which citizens were banished-a system of political black-balling- the name being written upon a leaf. Letare knew very well that social petaisnm threatened him. -Col. Stacey's counte- nance, however, was a main-prop to his tottering claims. His timely rescue of Miss Transmuere, too, stood him in good stead; and his altered habits had been at once observed and allowed. He soon became popular, and a prime favorite; and men began to declare that they had always felt an assurance that his father's son would shake from him his wretched asso ciates--the heartless parasites who clung upon him. He sav plainly enough, however, the necessity of caution in' his ad vances. He felt that he must be guarded; that the promise which his present conduct and behavior gave, Vf reformation must be strengthened into certainty. He had seen much o   if1::,        SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       31 the world; that is to say, had seen human nature in its worst semblances; and he knew that, with many, little reliance is reposed in any change for the better. How was he to recon- cile a caution which, in his case, was no more than prudence, with the ardor of his affection, which would lead him con- stantly to the side of the beloved one-to pay those attentions which love renders delightful to its votaries, and ever seems to demand of them? Accident threw him at once upon the plan of dividing his attentions between Mary and her friend, Ellen Transmere. The possible consequence of such a course with Ellen, he did not once think of. He counted not at all upon the stock of gratitude which she already felt towards him. Nor did his vanity for a moment lead him to suppose that his polite civilities could be by her construed into any thing more than friendly feelings on his part, or by possibility lead to any other on hers. All society is divided into cliques, and these again into minuter subdivisions. In every community, it matters not what general friendly relations may exist; what connecting sentiments may, as a whole, pervade it, these subdivisions, occasioned by similarity of taste and circumstances, and a thousand unmentionable social congruities and necessities, will ever be found. Letar attached himself particularly to that clique, if so it can be called, consisting of two or three girls, of which Mary Stacey seemed to be the leader; and was regarded, from the first, as a sort of prot6g6 of hers. In his intercourse with her, he soon began to exhibit marks of res- pectful diffidence, and want of self-confidence. But her easy behaviour with him would quickly re-assure him. She was indebted to her own unconstrained manners, for those lively sallies of wit, and out-bursts of piquant humor, which so often excited her admiration, and which, upon the least show of reserve on her part, would have been at once hushed into uneasy diffidence. From the first, she showed that she was pleased with him. As their acquaintance deepened, he began to indulge the fancy that there was something of an under- standing between them,  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7321-00000017"/> 32        EDITH ALLEN  OR, Mary Stacey had not lived to the age of eighteen, and not known that her fine eyes were very effective. Lids whose silken fringe Kissed her soft cheek's blooming tinge- saying what? Now this was a query which very much both- ered the brain of Briscoe Letar. He spent many an hour cal- culating what it was those beloved eyes did say; and her con- duct, too, open, free, and apparently artless, gave him room for much fond speculation. Was there not some partiality to- wards him?-almost imperceptible, it was true, and not to be taken hold of, yet evident to his hoping fancy. He might be deceived, but he thought that there was, though her evident ease troubled him. "I have as yet," he muttered to himself, while walking one day in his own yard at Longstowe, "I have as yet only pleased her, can I do more? Can I touch her feelings? Shelikes me; and none the less, for showing my love for her. Will she learn to love me? I do believe she is a little jealous of Ellen Transmere. Apropos; plague on that Fitzgerald!--If he was not such a likely fellow-con- found his cleverness!-I would not care for him; though being openly her lover, he has the advantage of me; She knows, however, that I love her, and she certainly does not discourage me." A young hound came bounding towards him, yelping, and whining, and fiisking about with demonstrations of great pleasure; and some half dozen others, following his example, came instantly gamboling, and stretching themselves around him. "Get down, Swift!"--"Down, Dash!-curse the dogs! Ned!" he called to a young house -servant whom he saw passing. "Ned, take these dogs, every hound of them, over to Mr. Woodson. Give 'them to him, with my compliments, and tell him I have sworn never to chase another fox!" The servant appeared astonished. "'Them's the best dogs,-Marce Briscoe, in all the country, sir," he presently said. "You gwine give 'em 'way?" "Yes, I know they are, Ned; and Woolson would give his   I          SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      33 best horse for them. Tell him  that I give them to him because I know that he will value and care for them." Ned seemed to doubt yet, if he had heard aright. "And Ned!" "Yes, sir.' "Tell Peter to take Tempest and The Screamer" (these were two favorite game cocks) "over to Mr. Price, with my compliments, and say that I have sworn never to attend another cock fight." "Racing, too, I am done with," he continued, as he en- tered his house. "Gaming, of every sort, I abjure forever! All these have become hateful to me.   With what low pleasures I have been satisfied-fascinated! Pity, alas! that , I have been so late in awakening!--that I was ever so infatu- ated! Mary Stacey! this is your influence! What might you not do? But, at all events, these things I have done with! I wash my hands of them! and were I never to see you again, these, and such as these, can charm me no more." At college, Briscoe Letare had fallen, to say the least, into very extravagant habits, and gotten himself involved in pe- cuniary difficulties, which he was unable to meet. Tempor rary, but very expensive accommodations were, however, easily enough effected, by a young man of property, and one who had the reputation of being worth much more than he really wag; and who was willing to buy time at a rate which should certainly have impressed him with a high opinion of its value, He hoped, like many another has done, and will do, that he would soon have a run of luck, which would free him from his embarassments: in other words, that something would "turn up" to relieve him.  What this indefinite something might be, he neither knew, nor chose to consider.  Never- theless, his hopes were high, amounting to confidence. The thisellers of time however began to grow importunate before this great good luck had as yet come to him; and it seemed that he was like to be driven to an immediate settlement, which, perhaps, had been well for him. But just now a cer- tain character formerly well known  about Richmond,-one  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7321-00000018"/> 34        EDITH ALLEN; OR, Hawk, chanced to make a visit to Williamsburg. To be as ex- plicit as possible, this Gideon Hawk, by some means, became aware of Letar's difficulties, and singularly enough, seemed to take great interest in them. Mr. Letare, he knew, was owner of a fine property. He himself had a small farm in the same county. 'Twas a pity-it really hurt him, to see a set of har- pies preying upon the little indiscretions and natural extrav- agances, if he might use such an expression, of a free-hearted, liberal young man. He himself had some money at his com- mand, for which he had not much present use: and, really, he had become so interested in the case, that if Mr. Letare would only secure himn, in case of accident, he knew nothing would give him more satisfaction, more real pleasure and gratifica- tion, than to free him from these blood-suckers. Letar, he said, could pay him whenever it might be convenient. He was not in need of the money, nor likely to be soon. All that he wished, was good, tangible security. Letare gladly accepted of this timely offer; and thus another temporary accommoda- tion was effected. Letare returned home, confident as ever in that expected good luck which was to free him at once of all troublesome claims. Indeed, he looked upon Hawk's unex- pected kindness as a sort of earnest of fortune's favors. The world lay before him, holding out many promises. Men had been known to win lottery prizes; large sums changed hands sometimes upon the race-field. Faro banks had been bro- ken, and dealers at Roulette-tables been forced to disgorge enormously. Why might he not do something at one or all of these? But, if the truth be told, he did not enter upon these quick-sands with any very definite end in view. His embarrassments over for the time, he drove them from his thoughts; and, in the meantime, rushed on in the whirl ofi dissipation into which he had fallen. But it is not our pur- pose, to dwell upon his habits at this period. It is enough barely to hint at them. Present pleasure was his only aim; and it was sought, only the more eagerly and recklessly, every day. But he saw Mary Stacey, and a new and a brighter life burst upon him, and he turned at once, disgusted, from the'   !IlW      SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      35 b"   low, coarse pleasures, the excitement of which he had hitherto so eagerly sought, to forget every thing in loving her. We spoke of him as ardent, generous, kind and unselfish- traits of character which appear, at the first glance, almost irreconcilable with the habits at which we have above hinted. But there are, perhaps, few persons who cannot, by a refer- ence to some living example, satisfy themselves in an instant that this incompatibility is only apparent. He was once known to ride many miles, in the bleak air of a December night, shivering and suffering himself, having, in pity, wrap- ped and protected a sick stage-driver in his warm overcoat. Many like acts of kindness might be related of him. What becomes of all the warm devotion and self-sacrificing impulses of boyhood, youth and early manhood? The history of Bris- coe Letare is an extreme example; yet, perhaps it is possible, that from it might be gathered some hints for the solution of this very interesting question, in cases occurring constantly before us; in which, frequently, other feelings than a mere psychological curiosity lead us to wonder where are gone the bright promises and hopes, which, like spring flowers, clus- tered around and beautified the boyhood of some one near and dear to us. This, and the highly interesting reflections to which such an enquiry leads, are, however, merely incidental; and we hurry on to facts connected with our story. Fitzgerald had left Mary Stacey, with bounding hopes and exulting happiness, wearing, not upon his finger, but near his heart, the little circlet of gold, which Miss Transmere had seen him, with a gentle violence, not much resisted, however, abstract from Mary's fair hand; and thrilling upon his lip, and tingling in his heart and every fibre, the kiss which he had daringly impressed upon that ravished member. His satisfaction might have been greater, but his confidence could scarcely have been more assured, had she, in express words, confirmed the acceptance of his love, which doubtless she would have done, but for the untimely presence of Miss Ellen Transmere. But had not Mary's very explicit remarks about that young lady's condescension to Letard, given satisfactory  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7321-00000019"/> 36.        EDITH ALLEN; OR, assurance that no gentleman should take or retain a trinket of hers, unless her heart went with it? And could any words have been more expressive, or any confession sweeter, than her down-cast look, and the flitting blush which had played over her beautiful features, as she withdrew her hand? That he considered himself accepted, his mAttered thoughts, as he rode happily along, will show. "And- that little farm," he soliloquized, speaking of one which adjoined the lands of Stacey Home, "which she admires so much, and says that she has always coveted: Hawk writes to me, that he expects to own other lands in this neighborhood soon-I wonder what other?-and that he cannot part with this, but for what may be thought-an exorbitant price. Five thousand dollars is an exorbitant price for such a small tract. How, I wonder, did he ever become possessed of it?-the old home of the Red- forths. But that poor Dick Redforth! Ah, well!-it is a pretty, sweet place, as Mary says; and I must purchase it, if possible. It will-be such a pleasant surprise to her-dear Mary!-and would I not do any thing to please her?-and of course, she will so love to be near her parents. Yes, I must buy it. I will write to Hawk at once, and offer him four thousand five hundred dollars; and if he will not take that-. why, he must have his price." He had not been long gone from Stacey Home, where Miss Transmere's presence had very much incommoded him, when Mr. Blundell sent for that young lady; and she was scarcely out of sight, when Briscoe Letar made his appearance there. He had scarcely uttered his greetings, when Mary cried out, with a mock sympathy: "Too late-too late! She has gone! Ellen has gone. Poor fellow! you should have come earlier. The true-love prescience which directed you hither should have hurried you-should have told you that she would leave this morning." "Certainly, I am unfortunate in not meeting Miss Ellen; but -" "Nay, nay; you need not express your regrets. We are very well aware of them, and sympathize with you. Doubt-'   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     37 less, however, some of her' gentle influences still pervade the room, as she has not been long gone." "Mary delights in teasing every one," said her mother. "Now, I'll be bound"-the old lady went on-" that she would not have thought to tell you that Ellen is not the only person who has left us this morning. Mr. - "Ah, yes I would, ma, have presently told him, that Mr. Fitzgerald spent the night with us," said Mary, coloring slightly. "Ah!" ejaculated Letare. " You need not be jealous of him," said she, casting on him one of those peculiar, indescribable glances. "As you lay claim to him yourself, I suppose?" asked her mother. "No, ma. I mean any thing else than that," she replied emphatically. "And I was going on to tell Mr. Letarg that Mr. Fitzgerald did not accompany Ellen home, as your remark might have led him to suppose, and as his countenance plainly enough indicated that he feared." "Thank you," said he; "no one knows better than you, whether or not I have cause to be jealous; and if you say that I have not, of course any such fears are at once removed." "And when I say that you have .none, as I do "-another glance and slight blush-"Ma, who cannot bear that people should be teased, accuses me of claiming him." ' Ah, well, you, who so delight in joking other folks, ought to bear a little raillery better yourself." "'It is rather a favor to some people to tease them, ma: for instance, I think Mr. Letare bears it very well." "If he does not, he might," said Mrs. Stacey, "when he is joked about Ellen. Were I a young gentleman, I should consider it1 a compliment to be teased about her. She is such a fine girl." The conversation here turned upon Miss Transmere, her early history and misfortunes; and she being a prime favorite with Mrs. Stacey, that good lady dilated at large upon her  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7321-00000020"/> I        EDITH ALLEN; OR, O R excellencies and attractive traits, excusing any thing like, uniqueness, by pleading the early disadvantages under which Ellen had labored. This was a chosen topic with the good old lady, who felt almost a motherly interest in Miss Trans- mere. "Well, ma, if you have not teased Mr. Letare, you have been doing what is perhaps fully as pleasing to a lover- speaking in high commendation of the absent fair one." "And why do you tease me about her?" he asked, when they were alone. "Oh, how should I know? It's pleasant, I suppose, to tease people." "And you wish others to believe that I am partial to Miss Ellen?" "Perhaps so." "You know very well yourself that I am not." "No, indeed, that do I not. How should I? What more probable, than that you are?  e How should you? and what more probable?-Nay, rather, how should you not? and what more improbable? for you know-you know very well, that I love you-and only you." Mrs. Stacey's voice was heard in the passage. When she -entered, Mary was bending .over a little basket of shell work, which she held in her lap, searching for something which she never found; and Letare was at the mantel, examining some mineralogical specimens which lay upon it. The good old lady was in a highly loquacious mood to-day. Mary was more silent than usual; and Letare had not much to say; but Mrs. Stacey had the world and all to talk about, as they say.. She told them old time stories:-of Tarlton's irruption into Vir- ginia-of La Fayette, whom she had seen.  She described Letare's father-spoke of how he looked when a young man; told of his mother, how beautiful she had been, and how kind and good.  Letare was charmed with her: he even forgave her for interrupting him in his first open declaration of love for Mary. The old lady was pleased herself, and seemed as if she would never have done with her garrulity. When din-   ner was concluded, she resumed. She described old fashions to them; she told them old love stories, of the parents of persons whom they knew; and even sang for them some old time songs. Mary's eyes, which were abashed at his bold avowal of the morning, and confined, at first, to the light work with which she employed herself, began again, during all this time, their bewildering play of coquetry. The afternoon was considerably advanced before the old lady again left them. As she did so, Mary said: "And now I will give you some music, if you like," laying down her work and moving to the piano. "But first tell me," he said, following her; "as I rarely have an opportunity of speaking to you alone, I must not- cannot lose this--first tell me, that-that you do not reject my love." He stood precisely where Fitzgerald had stood on that very morning, when he took Mary's ring, and kissed her hand. "There!" she cried, "see what you've made me do," as the little chain, which held her father's miniature, coming un- clasped, dropped from around her neck. "You should not confuse one so." "Ah" said he, "that is easily remedied," as he drew the trinket from the folds of her dress, and reclasping the chain, hung it upon his own neck.  "See!" he said. She looked "Do you remember," he continued, c what you said of Miss Transmere's locket?" - She made no reply, but looked down blushing. He took her hand.   She resisted slightly; but he still retained it. "Dear-dear Mary!" he exclaimed.   The temptation, as she there stood, blushing, beside him, was too great to forbear, and with a sudden impulse be bowed himself, and kissed-not the fair hand he held; the samie which Fitz- gerald had that morning kissed-but her lips. "Oh! you!-How   dare you, sir!-you saucy boy!" she exclaimed, jerking her hand from him. "Give me my min- iature." Now, you   are not angry With me, sweet Mary, are you?" "Ha-ha-ha!'-Who would have thought it?   You are a  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7321-00000021"/> to        EDITH ALLEN; OR,  saucy fellow, Briscoe Letare, and a bold'!--But give me my miniature." "I referred to what you said in connection with Miss Trans- mere's locket, and you will not -let me take this? Is it be- cause of that reference that you will not?" "You did take it." "Aye, but you recall it at once." "Oh, you know I could not permit you to keep it; it would be missed. Pa wguld miss it at a glance; he loves for me to wear it." "I return it at once." And he handed it to her, as she drew back, smiling, when he sought to place it himself on her' neck. "But, sweet Mary! it were just and kind in you to give something in stead. Tell me, that though you recall the locket, I may retain the heart." "Kind, said youea--kind? I love to be kind. Let me see. Oh, here!" drawing from her wrist a plaited bracelet of hair, "As I cannot spare you the locket, you may have the lock. It is my own hair, and you ought to be proud of it." "Thank you-oh, thank you!" pressing it to his lips. "Ha-ha-ha! I cannot but laugh, to think what a saucy fel- low you are." "Now, dearest, if such sauciness pleases you-----" "No, no, sir. No, sir!-no more of that! I disapprove of such liberties, and should have been angry at you before; but you took me so much by surprise; and--but I shall not forgive you, if you attempt such a thing again." "And this dear little braided lock, which I shall prize as my life, does it say all the locket would'? The heart was to be given with the locket. You see I wish to wring a confes- sion from you. Is this as significant?" I--that is-I suppose so. It ought to be more so, as it is my own hair; ought it not?' "Now, Heaven bless you, my sweet Mary!" "Hush! Pa's coming!" She turned to the piano; awheavy step was heard in the entry; and the piano rung with a then popular march.

Mutual saluta- ':!! tions being through, he continued: "I rode on briskly, my !t  dear; I came through the fields, the near way, to tell you that your aunt Allen and cousins would be here directly." A burning blush was spread over Mary's face, and she imme- diately left the room. Letare was afraid that the Colonel would perceive her confusion; but he appeared not to do so and talked away volubly about the news at Blankville, whither he had been. Letare soon asked for his horse. "Wont you stay, Briscoe?" "No, I thank you! I could not remain many minutes longer, and as you expect company, I had best leave at once.' "Well, I should be pleased if you could spend the night Letare was in hopes to catch one more glimpse of Mary; and, while mounting his horse, gazed back at the house. But in this he was disappointed, and he rode away, wishing that the Aliens had chosen some other time for their visit. "And there's no telling how long they may stay!" he muttered. But, then, they were Mary's relations and friends, and he was disposed to feel kindly toward all in the most remote degree connected with her. "  Oh!  how beautiful she is!--how dear! and how blessed am I!   This day, at its close, may more than offset a whole life of misery!" The little plaited lock of hair was more than once drawn   from his bosom and pressed to his lips.  The evening star as it arose over the western  horizon was apostrophized as the star of Love. Though late in November, it was a lovely, mild evening, and all the poetry of his soul was blended with the soft beauty of that twilight hour, as he rode along, dreaming of "Mary," the   "queen of his soul."  Byron was not the first one who had " a passion for the name of Mary." aA chosen name in Scripture; a name living in the bounding heart of many a lover-lingering  among the Sweet and secret memories of lany a stern, rough man; a name, blessed and beautiful as  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7321-00000022"/> EDITH ALLEN; OR,              . it is! which has been, is, and to the latest ages of time shall be, "a magic sound" to many. And to none was the sweet name ever dearer than to Briscoe Letare. He loved with all the energies of his soul. These had hitherto been dormant- latent. None knew of their existence; he himself knew not, until love, with a potent spell, awaked them from their secret slumbers. He had thought himself impulsive and yielding. He had not at all dreamed that there were in his character the elements of fixed and durable determination. But it is pretty much an idle thing to speak of the intensity of pas- sion-we mean of love. Almost every man conceives that he loves as never a man has loved before; and the effects of all emotions are as varied as the various circumstances in which men are placed. Letare's happiness was extreme. Happi- ness is usually highly promotive of health: but before he re- tired that night, at a late hour, he began to experience symp- toms of being unwell. For several days he continued quite feeble; and Nelly, an old negro woman, whom he called "mammy," who had nursed him when a child, and who loved him as though he were her own son, insisted that he should send for a physician. His impatience was great, and not many days elapsed before, feeling a good deal better, he was once more wending his way to Stacey Home. If others, strangers, were there; if he might be withheld from the sweet commu- nings, the tender interchange of sentiment, with her he loved, which seemed to him, now, the chief business of life-yet, he might see her; be in her dear presence; listen to the melo- dious tones of her voice, which so thrilled the chords of his heart. As he approached, he saw another horseman advancing from an opposite direction. They met at the gate. "Fitzgerald!" he muttered-"Confound the man! what is he wanting here?" Though he did not now acknowledge as much, even to himself, yet as he had ever done, he still felt some jealousy of this young gentleman. Why should he hang around Mary so?  At best, he was pertinacious and- troublesome. Fitzgerald, perhaps, was not very well pleased to see him; though he did not look upon him as a rival.   But the two met courteously, and entered together. They found here Mrs. and Miss Allen, the latter of whom Letar had seen here before, as also he had her brother, Mr. Clement Allen, both of whom greeted him as an acquaintance; the former with some playful allusion to hydrophobia. There was present, too, a young Mr. Lennox, whom they soon discovered to be an admirer of this young lady. Mary Stacey seemed, at first, somewhat embarrassed at their en- trance, but soon recovered her equanimity.  Letare was charmed with the modest dignity of manner, which she assumed to-day, which was new to him, and which, he thought, became her more, if possible, than her usual light gayety. Fitzgerald noticed it also, and was pleased. Each of these young gentlemen flattered himself that he had something to do with this change of manner; though there was, too, a cautious reserve about her, which neither liked so well. This, how- ever, was readily enough accounted for by the presence of company. Each sought in vain for an opportunity to whisper to her, if only a word, in private. :But, upon the whole, the day was spent as agreeably as could be under the circum- stances. When Letare left, Fitzgerald did also, saying, that as they had arrived together, so they would depart. "And may I hope, sir, that you will do me the honor to visit my bachelor den?" "Thank you. It would give me much pleasure: but as I have some business with Mr. Brandt I must go on to Blankville." And as their roads were different, they parted as they had met, at the gate. As they turned away, each cast a parting glance at the house. Fitzgerald's hat was instantly raised, and gracefully waved in the air, while Letare bowed low to his horse's mane, as a white scarf fluttered for a moment from an upper window.  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7321-00000023"/> "-        EDITH AILLEN; OR, &amp;.-, pgttg r   mou. "ETARE had not ridden very far on his way homeward, when he began to feel a peculiar dizziness and confusion of mind, which startled him. This was soon followed by nausea, and a general and momentarily increasing languor, and dart- ing pains in his head and joints. He spurred forward with increased speed. He had not gotten more than half way, however, before he had become so feeble that it was with ex- treme difficulty he could retain his seat upon his spirited horse. At length, he reached the bounds of his own farm; but a dreadful sickness was upon him. He endeavored to open the gate-was unable to do so; and presently, in at- tempting it, fell from his horse. He clung, however, to the bridle and to the gate. With great difficulty he at length opened it, and staggering, led his horse through. But he felt himself utterly unable to go on. The last act which reason dictated, was to draw the rein through the stirrup, and around it, so that his horse, being let loose, might go. directly on, and serve, perhaps, as a messenger for help. As he did this, a stunning dizziness overpowered him, and he fell prostrate. The horse started, and dashing off, galloped toward home. Oh! that night of agony! Oh! the 'awful hours! It was late in the night, when some of his negroes found him, raving in delirium, and bore him home in their arms. Letard had drawn the bridle rein through the stirrup, in order that his horse might hasten on home--not stop .to browse on the way. This circumstance, while it insured his arrival, prevented an immediate search for his master.

We thought Marce Briscoe must 'a had 'casion to go some- whar, and didn't want the horse, and so had 'eluded to send him home by his self, you see, sir." "And so, poor fellow! he laid there nearly the whole night through, and a more rabid case of fever I never saw." "And how is he, you thinks, sir?" "Why, of course, he is barely alive; and I wonder that he - is alive,", said the doctor, cutting and spreading out a blister, which he soon applied to the back of Letare's head. For a couple of weeks his case was extremely doubtful. During the third, however, the fever began gradually to abate. The doctor declared that he must have had an extraordinary constitution, to have withstood its ravages so long. A month had elapsed before he was able to sit up, even for a few moments, in bed. It was on the night of the third of Decem- ber, that he was taken ill.

The doctor had left him in her care, and that of Ned, who was little less devoted to " 4arce Briscoe," saying that he had nothing to do now but to get well as fast as he could. He charged them, however, that he should be quiet, eat spar-. ingly, and neither read nor think much. "Especially, he must not converse on excitable subjects. You understand me, Nelly; you know how he raved. There are things he must not hear of, and persons whom you must not talk about, until I give you leave." The bracelet of hair, which Mary Stacey had given him, had been taken from him during his ravings; but as soon as he became lucidj he had demanded it so peremptorily that it was hastily restored to him. As he grew well, he became very eager to hear something of Mary. He hinted, in every way, and asked leading questions, in endeavoring to make his faithful nurses talk of her; but he could not succeed. He asked'of his neighbors. Every query was answered. "And Col.

Indeed, from Letare's raving, she was fully persuaded that Mary had something to do with his illness. "And why, Ned, do none of the neighbors come to see me?" he asked one day. "Why, to tell you the fact, Marce Briscoe, I b'lieve the doctor is stopped 'erm. He says you bad better not see com- pany." Letare poured such an imprecation on the old Doctor's head as made Ned " wonder how Marce Briscoe ken cuss so; and he jest gittin' out o' sech a vi'lent spell o' fever?"Now the Doctor had forbidden all visitors from seeing Letar, until he should grow stronger, for this reason, among others; he knew that there were those of a very troublesome and unwel- come sort, who were only waiting, and impatiently waiting, until decency should no longer postpone their calls. Quiet was needful for his patient, and importunate creditors would'l only worry and harass him. Letar continued to improve in health very slowly. He sat up more, ate more, and moved about more than Nelly approved of. But he was not to be restrained. He not only left his room, but actually went out once or twice in the air, and spoke stoutly of being soon well enough to ride out; consulted his appearance very frequently in the mirror, and spoke of paying a visit. It was now the twentieth of February. Letar was lonely, and he sought the back porch, where Ned was busy in some household work. The, weather was fine for the season. Its mildness only made Letare the more impatient. "Ned," he said, "it is out of the question for a poor fellow to be cooped up, as I am, such lovely weather. Suppose you were in love, Ned, and had not seen your sweet-heart for more than two months-two weary months, which seem as long as a half dozen years-don't you' think that such confinement would go very hard with you?"

"Then every body is a fool. Miss Transmere, indeed!" "Well, Marce Briscoe, every body says so, sir; and I didn't know." Letar walked across the passage. When he returned, he said: "And you enquired about Miss Transmere, did you, Ned?" "Yes, sir. That is, sir, in a sort of roundabout way. I didn't let no one know what my objec' was., Mr. Blundell's Sam is got a wife, you know, sir,.at Squire Kinney's, and I talked 'bout the family to him, jest in a friendly way, you see, sir, whenever he was passin'."

Is it any great wonder that she should be my sweet-heart?"   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      49 "And that's the reason they wouldn't tell you, sir." "Tell me what, Ned?" asked Letare alarmed.

Letare had seated himself, or rather dropped upon the bench, expecting to hear that she was dead. He sprang up with a galvanized jerk, "Married! you lie, you villain! Married! To whom?" Ned was terribly frightened, at the dreadful aspect of his master's features.  "Oh, Marce Briscoc; I ought not to 'a told you, sir! They told me not to!" "Married! you lying scoundrel! Mary Stacey!

The moon was at the full, and by her ample effulgence dimmed the radiance of the stars which, in unnumbered multitudes, glittered in the clear sky. A light frost had fallen, and on every blade of the crisp grass, and on every twig and bough her silver light was reflected back from ten thousand little icy spangles.  Stacey Home was lighted up, and festivity reigned there on this, the wedding night of Mary Stacey. At first she had objected, but afterwards, yielded to private reasons, which hastened the fulfillment of her union with Clement Allen. Not a very large company was present, though the rooms were sufficiently full for com- fort. The folding doors of the sitting room and parlor were thrown. open, and these were given up to the young folks: while most of the elder, who remained after supper, which had been the principal cause of attraction with them, were cosily gathered in a room opposite. Among those who had left the company were the Rev. Mr. Arthur, a friend of the Allens, who had performed the ceremony, and the Rev. Mr. L---, Col. Stacey's old pastor, who had prayed for and blessed the young couple. But we will not linger longer with the elderly people. When we enter the rooms opposite, the first persons of our acquaintance whom our dazzled eyes fall upon, are Miss Allen, rattling away with and entertaining a half-dozen beaux, who are gathered around her, delighted with her animated prattle, and Mr. Lennox, who, not far from her, seems but little to relish the admiration which she is exciting and seem- ing to enjoy. As we pass along, confused and deafened with the chatteringo on every side, which reminds one of a flock of black-birds, we next come upon Miss Ellen Transmere. Her white dress is new to us. We have never seen her in white -before. Yes, we acknowledge that she is a pretty, sweet girl; and this is more than if we were to say that she is fine- looking and beautiful; for while it involves, perhaps, less of admiration, it breathes more of esteem. With her, is a young Mr. Bramham, who was one of the bridesmen, and her part- ner. There is with her, too, our acquaintance, Mr. Fitz- A1ik  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7321-00000027"/> 52         EDITH ALLEN; OR, gerald. This latter gentleman she had been observing with some interest, and was struck with his apparent good humor and cheerfulness. He certainly showed a disposition to bear his disappointment with as good a grace as possible. In the course of the evening, she alluded to this, in a playful, yet delicate manner. a Yes," he replied, in a mock serious tone; " not to do so would be folly. jEsop's Fables, Miss Transmere, embody a world of incomparable philosophy. In particular reference: Happy are we, if grapes hang too high, when we can coldly pronounce them sour." "Nevertheless," said Mr. Bramham, "it is mortifying to see another grasp the prize to which we have looked. I speak from experience, sir, and feelingly." "Allow me, then, sir, to recommend to your consideration the practical philosophy which I myself am studying; which teaches not only that the prizes for which we toil are of very questionable worth, but further, that the mortification of per- sonal vanity, if not a positive good, is, at the worst, only a trifling evil." "I congratulate you, sir, upon the happy character of your studies. By the way, I chanced to be near, when, among others, you tendered your well-wishes and congratulations to the bride." "Ah! and do you not think that I acquitted myself well?- went through that rich scene admirably?--rather shone, in fact? I enjoyed her confusion and blushes amazingly. H-"  "Oh, mercy! who is that?" was the frightened cry of a young lady near them. Looking quickly round, they saw, stalking through the room, a gaunt, skeleton figure, with grim and pallid features, who looked as if hea might have just arisen from the dead, and whose lustrous, fiery eyes seemed burning in their cavern- pus sockets. "Good heavens!-M r. Letare!"  "Briscoe Letare!" ;Letare!" was the astonished exclama- tion, as the way was hurriedly cleared before this frightful   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       53 figure. They saw him stalk along to where the happy, blush- ing bride was smiling, at the far end of the apartment. Here he paused, and drawing something from his bosom, held it before her eyes. "See, Mary Stacey, see!" He then dashed it to the floor, and with a frightful, maniacal laugh, ground it beneath his heel; and, having uttered no other word, stalked out as he had come. His ghastly features, the more promi- nent, as his hair was scarce an inch long; his determined, ghost-like stride; but, above all, the terrible brilliance of his eye, had made each one recoil from him as he passed along; and the scene was over before any one could think to in- terfere. Fitzgerald noticed that Letare reeled and tottered at the door, as he made his exit, and hurried after him. Fright- ful confusion reigned behind. The bride was fainting, as was also Miss Transmere. The doctor, who was called vocife- rously, from every side, had them at once borne from the crowded rooms, and followed after. "What is all this?" he asked, coming back.  a What is the matter?" "Letare!"--"Briscoe Letare!"-"That madman!" was the reply from every side. "And Where is he?" "Gone out." The doctor rushed out. "Where is he?" he asked of Fitzgerald, whom he met. "Gone." "Gone! gone where?" "Home, I presume. I saw him to his britzcha." "Home! And why did you let him go?" '"Why?  I could never have detained him; and this is, surely, no place for him. He's a raving madman, doctor!" "Madman, indeed!" said the doctor, as they re-entered the house. He soon found that his services would not be required here; that the shocked and frightened ladies were reviving; and thinking it his duty to see after Briscoe Letar, he or- dered his horse. Some time elapsed before his order was attended to; and although he sought a near bridle-way, and  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7321-00000028"/> 54        :EDITH ALLEN; OR, hastened on rapidly, he was unable to overtake him. The frenzied energy, which had nerved Letar4 to the execution of the task which he had achieved, had, as soon as his purpose was accomplished, deserted him; and the poor, delirious inva- lid, lay in -the britzcha, utterly prostrated. Ned, who drove him, and who was now frightened nearly out of his wits, at the sudden and complete exhaustion of his master--even more than he had been previously, by his excited determnination and lunatic energy-supported his yielding and unnerved body as well as he might, on the pillows upon which he was reclining, at the same time that he dashed along at a fearful rate, for home. Indeed, he thought that his master was dying; and there seemed to him to be an imperative necessity for the utmost haste. The night was light as day, almost; the roads smooth; and the britzcha flew along. When, having left the public road, he drew up at the gate leading to Longstowe, Ned cried: "Marster!"-no answer--"Marster!"-a deep groan. "Cheer up now, my dear. marster, and do the best you ken! We're at the gate now, and will soon be home?' That groan had cheered Ned from, a sudden fright into which he had fallen. It was lying at this gate, that he had found his master, on that December night, when he was first taken ill. When he called upon him, just now, and heard no answer, the poor fellow was seized with a frightful impression that he was dead. Ned had been forced upon this expedition, very much against his judgment and inclination; but when he sought to raise some objection, the terrible glare of Le- tar's eyes had at once silenced him, and enforced instant obedience to his wishes. Letare had kept his purpose to him- self-if, indeed, it was not a sudden impulse of fevered ex- citement-until the very last moment. Then, old Nelly had urged every means of dissuasion, entreaties, prayers and tears, in vain. When she found that her master would go, she almost enveloped him in pillows, and hung the britzcha with blankets. And he had no sooner gone, than she posted off a messenger, in search of Dr. Claiborne, to tell him that her master was worse-" in the fever again," she said-and that   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       55 he had gone, in spite of all she could do, to the wedding. By the time that this messenger, having gone first to Dr. Clai- borne's residence, reached Stacey Home, the doctor, himself, was far on his way to Longstowe. "Your master has got home, has he?" was his hurried question, when he arrived. "Yes, sir." "And how is he?" !"He seem like he b-are-ly alive, and that's all." ' And how dared you all to permit a man, in his condition, go out on such a mad expedition?" he asked, as he hastened in. "Law bless your soul! doctor, how was we to keep him-?" Early in the morning other physicians were sent for. "How you thinks he is this morning, doctor?" asked Ned. "As ill as he can be! And you--you villain!--if your master dies, may take his death on yourself." "Sir!" said the astounded Ned. "I charged you, and warned you, over and over, not on any account to let him hear of this wedding; and if I had thought you would have told him, I'd have sent you to Jericho--you disobedient rascal."  "Why, doctor, Marce Briscoe was 'bleeged to know it; he was 'bleeged to. find it out some how or nuther, sir." "Yes, but not until he was stronger; at least, until it was over, and I had prepared him for it." This talk made a very profound impression upon Ned-poor fellow. He told the doctor how it had come about, that he had informed his master; and how he was "'bleeged to tell him, sir, or told a 'bundance of lies, one; and Marce Briscoe would 'a been sure to 'a cotch me in 'em." If the strictest attention and the tenderest nursing could, however, save his master, this faithful sqrvant would not let him die.  A brother could- not have been more devoted. He seemed ready to sacrifice his own life, if it might do any good, for his master.

The disease comes back with an increased virulence, upon an already shaken constitution; and the re- laxed and enfeebled energies are unfitted to bear up against its attacks. Especially was it thus in this case, where not only the body was prostrated, but the mind was crushed under, perhaps, one of the severest disappointments to which it can be subjected. It was very long before Dr. Claiborne began to speak of Letar's recovery with assurance. It was the latter end of May, and he was still closely confined. The doctor con- tinued to be extremely attentive to him. "I am afraid that I left him rather sooner before than I should have done," said he. Besides, Dr. Claiborne felt a peculiar interest in his case. The consultation with his med- ical brethren had been unsatisfactory. The physicians differed in opinion; and Dr. Claiborne had seen no reason to alter his own; and, adhering to it; he boldly pursued his own course. Doing so, it was natural that he should feel an increased de- gree of responsibility. He had, too, fears of another shock and outhreak; so he remained with his patient almost con- stantly. One morning, his countenance would have indicated to an observer, that he had something upon his mind. He looked like a person who wishes to make a communication, but is fearful, or at a loss how to do so. "Mr. Letari," he at length began, "you have now been confined for a long time, sir; and I think it probable that your &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7321-00000030"/> 58         EDITH ALLEN; OR, business matters have gotten into some disarrangement.' Letard turned himself on his couch. "Ah! doctor, I know nothing about business matters," he feebly said. "Such things must, nevertheless, be attended to. Every man must look into the state of his affairs occasionally. Now, perhaps-that is--you know whether or not you are in debt?" "Oh yes, doctor, very much in debt!" "Ahem!-Old debts, Mr. Letare?" "Yes, old, and very heavy debts!" Well, my dear sir, you know your creditors may be ex- pected to become impatient after awhile?" "Heigh ho!-I wonder that they have waited so long. But, for my sickness, they would have been pressing me before now." "Who are your principal creditors?-That is, if I may be permitted to ask." "Oh, to be sure--certainly!- A man named Hawk is my chief creditor; though, to tell the truth, I owe so much, that, in short, I know nothing about these matters. Like a fool, I would not attend to them when I was well, and I am not able to do so now." "I know that you are not, my dear sir.

I have kept them from you, so far, on my authority, as your physician,-forbidding that you should be disturbed; and, in truth, denying you to. every one. They are now, however, becoming so importunate and clamorous, that I can do no more with them. I regret very much that you should be troubled with such things; but thought it best that I should mention the matter to you. An agent of Hawk is very urgent in his claitns; and the de- puty- sheriff has called twice, on business of Scorfield-for a paltry sum, I believe. Now, sir, I think it would be better, in your debilitated state of health, for you just to hand over all your business to some lawyer. You are not able to attend to business yourself; and, indeed, I think it, quite important that you should trouble yourself with it as little as possible."   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       59 "Ah, doctor, I am -glad that you have proposed this. It is what I must do. Please just send for Mr. Brandt. I'll place my life and person, doctor, in your hands, and my property in Mr. Brandt's; and between you two, I shall just have no trouble .at all," he said, with a sickly smile. "Certainly--Brandt is the very man. You could not be in better hands than his." "And yours, doctor?" -  Ah, well, I am glad to find that you take these troubles so easily. I was a little fearful about communicating them." "Ah, doctor, I am too weak now, for anything to trouble me, except those foolish-foolish dreams. I know them to be dreams, and yet they worry me more than realities could do." "Well, you will get over them soon now, I hope. There-J  you had better not tallk any more now. I see that you are getting fatigued." "Heigh ho!"  The invalid turned himself feebly over, and the doctor, linging for Ned, gave this functionary, upon his entry, some powders to prepare.

All Letare's papers were placed in his hands; and his affairs, altogether, entrusted to him, as agent, with full powers "to do the best he could." According to Letare's own expos6, these were in a very embarrassed con- dition, and his debts heavy. But Mr. Brandt soon found that their actual state was far worse than Letare had any concep- tion of. Dr. Claiborne had told him, at first, that his patient's mind was not in a condition to grapple with difficulties; and i that it was very desirable that he should be troubled and ha- rassed as little as was possible, until he should grow stronger.

But I fear it. In fact, I know, that unless some accommodation can be effected, he is swept, sir-gone! lock, stock and barrel!" "Why, dear me! He told me nothing of this." "I suppose that he is ignorant of it himself, sir: yet, really, I do not see how 1e could be. His principal creditor is the notorious Gideon Hawk--the only one to be feared, in fact. But besides the lien upon the Longstowe property, I find that he has been for years buying up claims against Le- tare. Passing by his agent, Burser, and applying directly to Hawk himself, telling him of Letare's present state of health, I have gained a respite of some months, which Burser was little disposed to allow. But, sir, I wish to talk with Letare himself, as soon as I can, safely and satisfactorily--to know what his wishes and views are. In the mean time, I must beg of you, to inform him, in the best way you can, of the utterly ruinous condition of his affairs.

"No; on the contrary, there is every reason to fear a still further depreciation; and I cannot but think, that it was this which induced Hawk so readily to grant us time. With any likelihood of a rise, he would pounce upon us in a twinkle. I know the man, sir.' "Well, well! I knew that Letare was embarrassed, but had no idea of the extent of his indebtedness.

While a foolish college boy, ashamed to apply to his guardian, he got into the hands of a set of sharpers, who bandied him about among them, like a shuttlecock. Hawk, who has his under-strappers among this set, hearing, perhaps, that he was a proper sub- ject, took him in hand himself, after a time. And where is the young man, my dear sir, who, once in his clutches, has ever escaped him? Look at poor Dick Redforth! I was quite uneasy, a short time since, lest young Fitzgerald should get into his meshes. I have not seen so much of the young man, yet I took a fancy to Jhim. Fortunately, he abruptly broke off his dealings with Hawk. I hear, however, that young Clement Allen has bought this old Redforth property."

A small debt transferred from usurer to usurer increases at the like rate. Besides, you know that he has been gaming, and horse-racing, and cock-fighting, and what not? for several years past. Money was wanting for these expensive sports. Hawk's understrappers were ready to advance it, for a consideration; and Hawk himself, by after- wards advancing money to liquidate these claims, clears the usury and becomes a bona fide creditor. This is the way, at least, in which I have good reason to believe, that he has acted toward others; and I presume that the same game has been played here." "Well, it is a very great pity! That is a fine estate-that of Longstowe--to fall into a usurer's hands." Hurrying over a few months, and being careful not to dwell ipon disagreeable details, more than necessary, we will merely say that Letare gradually grew better in health, and at length, in common phraseology, "got about again." He also became, by degrees, as it seemed, awake to the embar- rassed posture of his affairs. As he slowly recovered, his blighted, disappointed love-his desolation of heart-the de- struction of all its sweet hopes, worth more than life itself-  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7321-00000032"/> 62     -   EDITH ALLEN; OR, first came before him, to the exclusion of every thing else. He appeared insensible to aught that could happen to him after this. But his difficulties were more and more impressed upon him, by Dr. Claiborne and Mr. Brandt. Grim ruin was before him. How was he, weak in health, crushed in heart, to meet it? The exceedingly low price of property, reduced more than a fourth within the year, was almost unprece- dented, while the stringent pressure in the money market was ominous. A slight relaxation, which proved temporary, how-. ever, had, as Mr. Brandt had augured, induced Hawk to urge his claims. Upon this, Mr. Brandt sought an interview with Letar. "And so," said the young man, in a sad voice, "the dreaded day has come at last, and no more can be done!" "Mr. Letar" said Brandt, after a moment, "I need not seek, sir, to express my deep sympathy with you, in all your sorrows and troubles. By one means or another, I could keep Hawk off -for six or eight months to come; but it will be too expensive a game to play, simply for the playing. Besides, the property will bring more just now, than it probably would do six months hence; or I should be for fighting it out any way. We must be as saving as possible. It will be little enough, I am afraid, that will be left you, sir." "Well, I trust all to you, sir; and I suppose that the sooner it is over, the better." A few days after this, Mr. Brandt called to let him know that the tenth of November had been fixed as the day of sale. Letare told him that there was only one particular in which he felt called upon to interfere. "Old Nelly-my mammy! and Ned-poor-fellow!" "Rest easy about them; Dr. Claiborne and I have arranged between us, that they shall not be separated from you. For my part, Mr. Letare, I have no claims against you; nor will I have, unless I find that all your property will be swept by that greedy blood-sucker, Hawk.. In which case, sir, I shall bring. forward my claim, for fees. Dr. Claiborne says the same; and between us, we will save your old nurse and  j   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRtGINIA.      63 the faithful Ned from him. I shall draw at once, and get you to sign, bills of sale for the two. But Dr. Claiborne tells me that old Nelly is quite ill." , {( Oh, yes; the poorl; affectionate creature is nearly broken- hearted!" "In the present scarcity of money, and with the prospect of a war before the country, your property, fMr. Letare, cannot bring much. I wish tq prepare you, sir, for the worst." 4"Oh, I am  aware of it, Mr. Brandt. I expect to save nothing, sir; or almost nothing." "When will you go over to Elvy's Hill?" "I do not know. The sooner the better, I suppose." "Do you think that you can save Elvy's Hill?" "I cannot say, at all. I shall do my best. At any rate, it will be held back for the present.  I hope that Longstowe and -the negroes will more than clear you; or, if not, that Hawk will be satisfied for the time. He thinks so, I know; for he has bought up Schrfield's and all other of your acknowl- edged debts, which he can lay his hands on-shaving them, I suppose. - There is no telling yet, what we can make of him; for when men of his stamp find that they can make no more, they usually press on to the uttermost farthing." "Elvy's Hill" was a  small tract of land, containing fifty or sixty acres, which Letare had inherited from a maternal uncle and  which adjoined the lands of Longstowe. It was not con- sidered valuable. The open lands were worn, and the wood- land, twenty acres or thereabout, was principally marsh. The dwelling was small, but comfortable. Thither Letare re- moved, early in November, not wishing to be present to wit- ness the sale of his property. One of his last acts at Long- stowe, There he had remained longer than he would otherwise have done, on her account, was to follow old Nelly Ito the grave. Her. death was one more cruel shock to his spirits. She had nursed him in infancy, watched over him in boyhood, loving him ever with the devoted affection and pride of a pa- rent. It was a   stunning blow to him to lose her! But he was losing all, poor fellow!  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7321-00000033"/> "        EDITH ALLEN; OR,               }  The low price at which Longstowe was sold, was almost unprecedented; two thousand acres of fine land going for little over five dollars per acre. The negroes were selling at little better rates, although there was some competition for these, when Mr. Brandt' stopped the. sale, declaring that it was outrageous, and that such a sacrifice should go no farther. Hawk, as every one knew that he would, became the owner of Longstowe. He was heard to say that he had foreseen this event five years before, when he had come up from Richmond, and takena view of the property. Letar, poor fellow, was at Elvy's Hill, with what was left him of the wreck of his estate, and with a number of debts still impending over him, for which suits had been at once instituted against him. For a time, every body talked about him, and pitied, and blamed him. But in the retirement to which he now betook himself, few persons saw any thing of him. These few were struck with the very great change which had taken place in him.  Deep dejection was to be looked for. A few brief years of troubled pleasure, and the prodigal had been struck down! 'Tis a common tale. But there was more than dejection here. Towards all except Dr. Claiborne and Mr. -Brandt, there was a sternness in his manner, which reached almost to rudeness; an Ishmaelite spirit exhibited itself, which those who had known him before, could not at all understand. Brooding over his follies, his disappointments, and misfortunes, his nature was becoming hardened. The crushed insect will sting. Briscoe Letare was preparing for a war with the world. His former pleas- ures and follies were despicable in his eyes; his trusting and devoted love, deceived and slighted, was hateful to him, with all connected with it. The leaves and flowers were rudely torn and shaken: from his character and heart; thorns only remained. He was crushed, wronged, deceived, ruined. A stern desire to avenge himself on the world; a wish to crush in his turn, began to arise within him, and to grow upon him, as the months rolled on.  But he was powerless, and his adversaries were still pressing upon him.  Another sacri-     sKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       65 fice, by a sheriff's sale, would soon await him. Should he be crushed to death, tamely submitting?  Should he be utterly ruined by the relentless usurer? There was, perhaps, in his character, hitherto deemed sh soft, the elements of that frenzied energy, which led him to throw at Mary Stacey's feet that before so treasured bracelet, and grind it under his heel. It was winter, but one of those mild, lovely days which make one feel that it is a joy to live, a pleasure to breathe the air;. when the curse weighs less heavily on earth, and the skies are serene; when the south wind plays lightly, and insects creep out, wondering if indeed winter be past. Briscoe Letare, musing moodily, had climbed a woodland bluff at Elvy's Hill. Owing to the broken nature of the ground the growth was thin, and the view scarcely interrupted. Raising his eyes suddenly, there lay extended before him the greater portion of the Longstowe lands, his paternal property. There was the home of his father, and his father's father, lately his own-but a stranger's now!   He sate him down upon a large loose stone and gazed upon it. We will not attempt to pene- trate his thoughts. Presently he arose, and with a look which declared all the determination which the countenance of man is capable of expressing; with his hat removed, and his arm extended, while his hand was clenched with a force which made his whole frame tremble-alone, upon that bluff hill-side, before heaven, and with the rocks and trees for wit- nesses, he vowed to devote himself, body and  soul, to the recovery of all which he had lost. That should henceforth be the aim, and the only aim of his life.  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7321-00000034"/> g66        EDITH ALLEN; OR, r,          ,  *  &amp; ghter  it'l EIGHTEEN months had elapsed since Miss Transmere had seen Letare, except on that frightful occasion, when he had so unexpectedly intruded upon and disturbed the festivities of Stacey Home, and so shocked her, by his ghastly appearance and maniacal conduct. It was long before she entirely recov- ered from this; for her secret love for him had been terribly shocked. For many months his gaunt form, his skeleton fea- tures and gleaming eyes haunted her thoughts. Thatfearful scene was constantly before her. It was a death-blow to all the romantic sentiment, sweet yet melancholy, which in her heart she had twined and linked about the form and name of Letar. And then followed his long sickness, his bankruptcy and ruin. He was driven from his paternal home-a stranger owned Longstowe! She had passed by the fine old place, and, remembered it well. Oh, those debts, those shocking debts! And now every one said that he was so changed; that he was become a morose, disappointed ascetic. He had cut himself off from the world. He was lost! In fact, all her later thoughts of him, as well as all which she heard of him, was unpleasant. She, too, was changed. She was more sedate in manners, if possible, than ever; was certainly much more serious in temper. A passion, as a storm, is succeeded by a calm. And had she, like a summer friend-she, who loved him so--forgotten poor Letare, now in the winter of his for- tunes? Yes, it seemed so; and Miss Transmere, as the months passed on, felt herself that her love for Letare was past too. She did not cherish it;, why should she.? It had :   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      67 come upon her unawares, and brought with it no token of promise. She had nothing to nourish the flame, no sweet memories to cherish. He loved another. It was her duty to forget him. She had striven to do so, and thought that she had succeeded. Her journal was laid aside; and she had turned to the ordinary avocations of life, and sought and found amusement and entertainment. In the mean time, the months had rolled on. Fitzgerald, all this time, had been frequently in the county, and had occa- sionally called upon Miss Transmere. He had not been led, by Mary Stacey's falsehood, to distrust the whole sex. He charged her coquetry only on herself; blaming himself, how- ever, that he had been so easily deceived; and wondering how it came to pass that he had so admired her. He was sur- prised, too, as his acquaintance with Ellen grew, that so sweet a girl as he now found her to be, and so pleasant a companion, calm and quiet as she was, had been hitherto so entirely thrown in the shade and overlooked. It is true, that he regarded Ellen only as a friend; but the more he saw of her, and .the better he became acquainted with her, the more was he pleased. Mr. Blundell, who had a very sound and prudent regard for wealth, was gratified that his ward should have such a visitor as young Fitzgerald, whom he pronounced to be "a fine, sen- sible young man, and well to do." Indeed, Ellen out of the question, Mr. Blundell liked such a young man to visit his house. He liked a good name, too. He was thankful that his o'n was one he had no cause to be ashaimed of. It had been altered, by the elision of a letter, it was true, having been originally Bloundell; but his grand-father, he would punningly observe, had by striking a cipher from his name, been enabled to add several to the figure which represented his before somewhat narrow fortune-an eccentric relative, who had quarrelled with his family, having made him his heir on this'condition. Mr. Blundell was rather fond, than other- wise, of speaking of "his family; " upon what ground, how- ever, we are ignorant. In so far as we know, he may have belonged to the family, and been a near relative of, Bloundell  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7321-00000035"/> EDITE ALLEN; OR, Btoundell, Esquire, of Bloundell Hall, Bloundellshire. While speaking of him, we will state that, whatever we may say, hereafter of his love of money, nevertheless he was, in his  own house, a very hospitable man, and took pride in living well. "Fitzgerald's same," he said, "was a good one; and a good name," he would go on to say,  he     e a good fortune to back it." In fact he esteemed Ellen the  more for having formed such an acquaintance as young Mr.  Fitzgerald; -: C Easy as she looks," he would say, nodding his head sagaciously, "the lassie has her eyes open; and I shrewdly suspect that she will never lack for butter with her bannocks." Whether his hospitable complaisance contributed  anything to make the-visits of the young gentleman in ques- tion any more frequent or not, it is certain that they, after a time, became so; and as they grew more frequent, Fitzgerald found them mlore and more pleasant. He and Ellen were becoming quite intimate; and friendship, with him, began by degrees to ripen into a warmer partiality. Ellen, for her part, liked him very well. Since lIary Stacey's marriage, and that of some others of her friends, she saw much less company than she had formerly done. Fitzgerald was the young com- panion whom she met with most frequently. He waspleasant and agreeable. His visits broke in upon her monotonous life. He procured books for her, and conversed interestingly about them. Nor was it by any means disagreeable to have a hand- some young cavalier to attend her at church and elsewhere. Her sensitiveness, for she had always felt herself an odd girl, was flattered by his friendly preference; and gratitude, differ- ent from that which formed the basis of her previous admira- tion for Letar, mingled with her feelings towards Fitzgerald. The transition, on his part, from friendaship, with its freedom, to the constraint and formality incident to a tenderer feeling, was, as we have intimated, very gradual, almost imperceptible. Ellen herself did not perceive it. In her ownscontinued ease in his presence, she did not notice that there was less and less of ease in his manners, increasing deference to her opinions, and tenderness of attention; or she only charged it to the   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      69 distinguished politeness which had ever marked his behavior. So that, when at length he delicately hinted his partiality, she was, at first, slow to comprehend him; and when she did, was overwhelmed with surprise. We have seen that with Mary Stacey he was rather a bold lover; with Ellen he was timid. It is said that women inspire essentially different emotions in a lover. An individual whom we knew, was fond of compar- ing the heart to a musical instrument, every player upon which has a touch peculiarly her own. For our own part, we take love to be very much a matter of accident and circum- stance. Our opinion is founded chiefly upon what we've "Ken'd frae mony a friend's tale." Fitzgerald bore, with a proper and cheerful fortitude, his previous disappointment. He was, in the space of a little more than twelve months, kneeling again to a gentler, if not a fairer maiden, with a purer, more refined and tender devo- tion, than he had ever known for the deceitful Mary Stacey. When Ellen understood, at length, what he was saying, and that he was pleading love, her surprise was extreme. Her calmness deserted her for a moment, and she felt herself almost overcome with an agitation, which our lady readers will be able justly to appreciate, by reference to their own tremulous perturbations, while listening to the first love-claim ever pressed on them. When, confused and scarcely knowing what she was saying, she had made many expressions of sur- prise, and was beginning to say something about being l"sorry, and regretting this discovery," he interrupted her, and begged that she would not answer him then, but would please take time to reflect. "I see," he said, " that I have been precipitate. The pro- posal is new to you. I have thought of little else for many a day. Think of its importance to me, and do not answer hurriedly." "Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald, I thought-I hoped that you were my friend."    {' And so I am, Miss Ellen!-dear Miss Ellen!-so mhtch I                         X  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7321-00000036"/> 70       , EDITH- ALLEN; OR, your friend, that I would fain seek to be more.

Please regard me  and my proposal as kindly as you can; and wait-do not de- cide now-say a week hence-a fortnight-three weeks-that   I is, I am asking you to wait until you can give me a favorable : answer. You perceive that I do not know what I am saying; yet, dear Miss Ellen, there is this that I do know-that I love : you as I never thought to love!" And Fitzgerald, seeing that she listened with more composure, and no longer sought ^? to interrupt him with regrets, leading on, as he feared, to an immediate refusal, became more assured, and plead his love with an earnest fluency and a touching eloquence which was ii almost irresistible. As he advanced, his timidity more. and IX more disappeared, and he was calling her "Ellen," and "'dear Ellen!" and at length had actually caught one of her hands in his.   "This is a new subject to me altogether, Mr. Fitzgerald," she said, withdrawing her hand. "I have heretofore only ' looked upon you as a friend; as such I esteemed you very highly; I liked you very much. I have not yet .learned to regard you as-as-in this new light; and, as you said, I had ' better not reply at once. I would rather wait--yes, I must X ask time for reflection." d "Then, let it be as short a time as possible, dear Ellen!" ! "You named three weeks; now, that is--"         !^ "Three weeks!,--dear Ellen-three weeks is an age!" Ad You named that time yourself, and I was going on to say that it would be a very short time for so important a decision." ' But consider my suspense, in all this time; say, at the longest, say a fortnight."    ,  "Well, then, a fortnight."  There was something in her look and in her tone which   : cheered him.            . "And, in the mean time, I may hope, dearest?"--seizing her small, white hand, and pressing it to his lips.    . The act was an unfortunate one; for, as she drew away, she   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     71 thought of Mary Stacey. A cloud gathered on her features, and the consent which, but for this, she was probably about to give, was withheld. "No, Mr. Fitzgerald, I will not bid you hope." "Now, dear Ellen, I have offended you with my eagerness and freedom. Forgive me-please forgive me! My feelings towards you are only those of the very highest respect; and I would not offend you for the world." "No, sir, I am not offended. You only reminded me that I was permitting you to entertain hopes which I should not, by any act of mine, encourage." "Now, my dear liss Ellen, do not look and talk so coldly. If you think that I am precipitate in urging my love, let me postpone my proposal; let it remain in abeyance for months, or years-only-only do not look and speak so coldly, "You make me smile at you, Mr. Fitzgerald.  A moment since, three weeks seemed an age to you; and now, you speak of months and years." "Ah, I  speak as my hopes or fears dictate." "Then I was correct in my apprehension, and I was giving rise, by my bearing with you, to hopes which I have no right to encourage. Ham odd, perhaps, in this as in many other respects, in my opinions; but I think it prudent, and in every way best, to be particularly cautious in affairs of this kind." ecWell, in a  fortnight, Miss Ellen, I shall expect your  kind decision." "I shall, sir, endeavor to do justice both to you and to myself; and shall be as kind as is consistent with such an attempt. And. now, sir, let us converse upon other topics." Just then the door-bell rang; steps were heard in the etry, and 'the servant, opening the door, ushered in Briscoe 5etard. "Oh, Mr. Letare!" exclaimed Ellen, wondering that he, of "persons, should have come in at such a time; and her face ushed for a  moment. He was pale, and thinner than he used  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7321-00000037"/> 72        EDITH ALLEN; OR, to be, and there was a stern melancholy in his countenance, and especially in his eye, that the smile with which he greeted her could scarcely overcome. The fresh look of boyhood, which had before distinguished him, was gone. He appeared ten years older than he did when she first knew him, two years before. His eye, which had been so expressive of gayety and ardor, now, so soon as the smile which had partially lighted it up was passed, seemed hard and cold. There was something about the mouth, too, a firmness, perhaps, which had not once been expressed there. Ellen was much struck with the change in his appearance; so also was Fitzgerald, who had greeted him in a friendly manner. Fitzgerald had felt great sympathy for him in his misfortunes; the. more, that he had discovered, on the night of Mary Stacey's wedding, that Letare, too, had loved and been deceived by the false coquette. He had called upon him, more than once, during his subsequent illness; but had been refused admittance, as were all others. He noticed the change in him, but after observing him for a moment, doubted if it really was for the worse. He was grown manly in his appearance, almost to stateliness. His misfortunes, too, made him an object of interest, and his smile was almost pa- thetic. Mrs. Blundell, who came in for a few moments, during his stay, was quite touched with him. He conversed cheer- fully and agreeably, but without levity. He did not remain  long; for while Fitzgerald, whose visit had been prolonged  from the previous day, having, ordered his horse, was donning his overcoat and spurs, Letare arose too. "Why, really, Mr. Letar, you are not going to leave us so soon; and I have not seen you for so long?" asked Ellen. "Miss Ellen, yours is the only fair face graven on my me- mory, which I can contemplate with pleasure. I could not  resist the temptation to gaze upon the original again, though  I came to see' you with many fears. I had a dread .lest you should be changed. Those fears removed, I must now be ab- stemious, like one long starved." While he was uttering this, Ellen doubted whether she understood what he was say-  ing. As his last words seemed in answer to hers, she replied: ?   :! j   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.   ,  73 "Well, if the famished must eat little, they are allowed to eat frequently, are they not?" "At any rate, if they do not, the fault is not generally theirs, I believe. It shall not be mine, certainly." "Changed-oh, so changed!"-muttered Ellen, when they were gone. "What did you say, love?" asked Mrs. Blundell. Ellen started. / She had thought herself alone. "I was observing that Mr. Letar was so much changed." "Yes, poor fellow! he has had enough to change him. But then," she presently went on, "I do not think that he's al- tered for the worse. He used to be a pretty boy; now, he looks like the hero of some sorrowful romance. He is deci- dedly the most interesting person in his appearance I have ever seen. He is not, perhaps, so handsome a gentleman as Mr. Fitzgerald; but then he is so strikingly interesting with that melancholy smile. I declare, it reminded me of sunlight playing on dark clouds." "Why, really, aunt Martha, you are growing poetical." When Fitzgerald was so earnestly pleading his love to-day, Ellen had more than once been on the point of accepting him. As has before been said, she had a very high regard for him; she liked him; and when he had thus made known his love for her, and her first surprise was over, while he so earnestly and so tenderly pressed his suit, it seemed to her, indeed, that her esteem amounted almost to love. When she herself asked for the time for reflection, which he had at first pressed her to take, the words were in her heart, and almost on her lips, which would have made him a happy man. But her remem- brance of Mary Stacey was unfortunate for him in more respects than one; for she not only recollected that he had kissed Mary's hand, and loved her; but her own former feel- ings were recalled, and the softening influence of present per- suasion gave place in comparison with these. The fact is, that her love for Fitzgerald, or, we should rather say, her deep and kindly interest in him, though warmed and colored for the moment with the tender sympathy of his own love, was only of 4  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7321-00000038"/> 74         EDITH ALLEN; OR, the nature of that a sister feels for a handsome brother. And this wooing scene, where she had so nearly' yielded, was scarcely ended, when Letar--of all persons the one she least expected to see-made his appearance. Despite of the un- happy and disagreeable thoughts which had for so many months past clung around her remembrance of him, there was, as Mrs. Blundell said, something extremely interesting about him. She did not, perhaps, so much feel this at first. She was then struck with the remarkable change which had bean wrought in him. She did not fully identify him with the Briscoe Letare whom she had known and loved. His parting words made an impression upon her, in which he had, fore the first time, made any allusion to his altered circumstances and misfortunes, more, perhaps, from his peculiar manner than from anything in the words themselves; which, indeed, she had not at the- time precisely comprehended. In a few days he called again. During his stay, which was short, Mr. and Mrs. Blundell were both present, and the conversation was general, and, as it appeared to her, a little constrained; though Mr. Blundell had treated him -with more consideration than she expected, and exhibited an interest in him which rather sur- prised her. This was explained soon after Letare's departure. "Yes,"--Mr. Blundell replied to some remark of his wife- "Yes, he is changed, and more in character, Brandt tells me, than in person. Brandt says his folly is all gone, like so much chaff; and, insists upon it, that if Briscoe Letare lives to be twenty years older, he will be the wealthiest man in the county. But Brandt, somehow, is very partial to the young man. After this visit especially, Ellen thought a great deal more of Briscoe Letare and his pale, melancholy face, than of Fitz- gerald and his suit. Where the flame has lately burned, it is easily rekindled. There is a French proverb, that the heart readily reverts to a former love. But though Letare occupied her thoughts very frequently, Ellen had not found this out, when early on the ensuing week he paid a third visit. "You see, Miss Ellen, I avail myself of your permission to come to see you frequently,"   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA,       75 On this occasion, Mr. Blundell was from home, and Mrs. Blundell soon left them to themselves. During their conver- sation, which, by some chance, turned upon the vicissitudes of human life, he adverted to his own life, speaking in uncon- strained condemnation of his thoughtless follies, and criminal prodigality. His remarks, as he went on, seemed more a soliloquy, than addressed to another. She looked up inte- rested, both by what he said-for he alluded to passages of his life which she had never dreamed of, sneering at his own thoughtless generosity, and boyish trustfulness-as also by his manner, which was singularly impressive. "A fit apprenticeship all this," he went on, "and a need- ful, perhaps, to one of my disposition, for the stern, and harsh, and unfeeling struggle of life which is to follow. But I beg your pardon-I have been wearying you?" "Oh, no; on the contrary, I have been much interested." "Well, my egotism is one proof that the lessons have not been lost on me; and that I have become selfish. I have desired to see you .alone, Miss Ellen. I wish to ask some questions of you--one in particular-if I dared." "Well, I am all attention, and ready to reply, if I can." "It is only selfishness which prompts me to wish to know- that is, lo feel interested in the matter. There is a common report, Miss Ellen, that Mr. Fitzgerald, whom I met with here last week-----" At his name Ellen looked down em- barrassed. "I am not merely wishing to pry into secrets, as such; for, of all persons, I have no idle curiosity. But there is a report that he is a lover, and like to become an accepted lover, of Miss Ellen Transmere. Now, Miss Ellen, I do hope that this is not true." "Mr. Letare might know," she interrupted him, "the worth of common reports, I should think." "If my hopes may answer for this one, it is as false as most of them are. For, Miss Ellen, while Mr. Fitzgerald is a gentleman of worth, yet you are all that is left to me of the beautiful, the pure, the good, and the lovely! There is in life n0 person, or thing, but you, to which my heart can 1  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7321-00000039"/> 76        EDITH ALLEN; OR, turn, Miss Ellen! and how can I spare you to him, or to any one? You -see thai it is selfishness, as I said, which has prompted my allusibn to this matter," he continued, with a sad smile, "and I beg pardon for it; although I can offer no other excuse, or plea, for my rudeness, but what this jealous selfishness is of itself; for I have not been hurried into it, at the moment, but sought you with this very purpose in view. It appears to me, that the whole world lies open to others, while for me, waking from a false enchantment-struggling in the ruins where I've been stunned and stupefied-I can see none but you. You are the sole representative of all that ren- ders life desirable, or tolerable!" His manner and tone were earnest, yet peculiarly respectful. Ellen was so much con- fused and embarrassed at this very singular address, that she knew not at all what to say. "I suppose," she stammered, "that I am obliged to you, Mr. Letare-if what you are saying is intended to be com- plimentary-but, really, I do not at all understand you;" and she was very glad- that a servant entered just now, with refreshments, and was followed immediately by Mrs. Blundell. When Mr. Brandt heard of Letare's first visit to Ellen, he exclaimed: "Now, why could'nt the blockhead have gone at first, and saved that fine old Longstowe? And now he will stand but little chance for Fitzgerald's in the field."  Meeting, soon after, with Mr. Blundell, he miade the remarks about Letare which have already been attributed to him,!say-  ing to himself, when again alone: "Now, that will put him on a better footing with Blundell, at least, and may do him some good."  He judged correctly, it appears; for we have seen how Mr. Blundell was influenced by these remarks: that he was, at least, sufficiently interested in Letare to enjoy his next visit; during which he had curiously endeavored to sift his character, for the purpose of ascertaining whether he could discover in him what he considered the elements of success in life. This, with him, was synonymous with making money;   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      " and he valued a man's talents only according to his capacity for thrift. Mr. Blundell's conscience had but little to do in his estimate of others. He himself was accused by some of being a "paper-shaver," id est, bill and bond broker- though this was never proved on him. Yet, with him, money, and still more, if possible, the making of money, was the great end and object of life. Apart from this, and the effect which it had upon his views and actions, and besides the fact that he was a man of very violent passions, but little can be said against Mr. Blundell. A month had elapsed, since the interview mentioned last between Letare and Ellen. ," I wonder what can have become of Fitzgerald of late, Ellen?" asked Mr. Blundell. "You, surely, cannot have given him cause to discontinue his visits-such a man as he is-the very first, the pick and choice of all whom I know?" "No one can have a higher opinion of Mr. Fitzgerald than I have, sir," answered Ellen, busy with some little scrap of lace work. "And Letar," he presently went on, "he seems to be with you almost constantly, now-a-days. Now, Ellen, I would warn you, my dear, that Letare is not the man for you to think of, except -as an occasional acquaintance; and I should have forbidden even this, long ago, but for your obligations to him." Ellen's face was scarlet-then, almost instantly, as pale as death. "'.What is the matter, my dear?" "Mr. Letar," began Ellen, trembling with emotion, "Mr. Letar and I, sir, arc " She choked, and could go no further. "Are what?" he asked fiercely. But Ellen could say no more. Bursting into a flood of tears, she ran off to her room. "Ah!-then it is so-is it?i But Briscoc Letar shall never marry you with my consent, young lady!" he screamed after her.  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7321-00000040"/> 78         EDITH ALLEN; OR, "I aum sorry to hear you say so, Mr. Blundell," said a voiwc at his elbow, "as my chief business this .morning, sir, was to ask that-consent." Mr. Blundell started, in surprise. "You here! What are you doing here, sir?" "I have just informed you of my business, sir," said Le- tare, bowing. "Then you've come on a fool's erran'd, and need say no more about it! You heard what I said, did you not?" "I did, sir," replied Letare, in a calm tone. "Then, sir, what more do you want? You shall not have her!-Do you hear?-You shall not!" he almost shouted. "Your refusal was anticipated, Mr. Blundell, and I do not now even deprecate it. I have only to inform you, sir, that Mr. Brandt and Dr. Claiborne have agreed, in such a case, to act as Miss Transmere's guardians. You will please let her know that one of these gentlemen will call on her to-morrow, perhaps this evening.' , Good morning, sir!" said Letare, smil- ing, and bowing, as he left the apartment. For a moment, Mr. Blundell stood as if he had not com- prehended him. He sunk into a seat, trembling. It was a short calm, however; for he bounded up, in a storm of anger. He paced the room rapidly and unconsciously. He rushed ,out, crying, "I tell you-you shcall not have her!" But Le- tare was gone. "Bring out my horse instantly!" he called to a servant. "No-you need not-let it alone," he contin- ued, as the servant turned to obey. He hurried back into the house, went to Ellen's door. It was locked. He called to her. There was no answer. Letar had arrived at home, for only a short time, when a note was handed him. He read: ' If Briscoe Letard, or any emissary of his, approaches my house, or enters upon my grounds, he will do so at his peril. "( CALEB BLUNDELL." Warnings of similar import were received by Dr. Claiborne and Mr. Brandt, in the course of the evening. Such threats,   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       79 however, were idle. Mr. Blundell had no claims upon Ellen to prevent her from marrying -whom she chose. At the next sitting of the court, which took place in a short time, Dr. Claiborne was chosen as her guardian by Miss Transmerc; and very soon afterwards, she became the wife of Briscoe Letare. s  , ii  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7321-00000041"/> 80         EDITH ALLEN  OR, THE effects of matrimony upon the character are various. For Letar, however, we have seen, that his marriage with Ellen Transmere was an affair of calculation.  1Ho had devoted himself, body and soul, to a purpose, viz: the regain- ing his lost estate. His marriage was but a first step to- wards this. Doubtless, he had always felt a friendly par- tiality for her. "As love generally produces matrimony," says the Spectator, "so it often happens, that matrimony pro- duces love." Letare certainly had a very high respect for his wife; and he probably loved her, as well as he could now love any one. But his feelings towards her were, from the first, wholly subservient to the great aim of his life; and much of his regard for her was, perhaps, due to the material aid which she gave him in its promotion. Men of strong minds are, for the most part, devoted to some particular object-having ever some leading and ruling motive. One will give himself up entirely to the pursuit of pleasure. This unsatisfactory chase, however, is very soon abandoned, as absurdly idle and falla- cious;. gaming hells and the racefield most frequently offering the subsequent arena for fiercer and more obdurate passions, into an indulgence of which, by a natural transition, the dis- appointed votary of pleasure passes. Another will hearken to the eagle call of Ambition, perched upon "The steep, where Fame's proud temple shines afar:" and days, and nights, time and eternity, friends, kindred and country, home-ties, health and happiness, save as these serve   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      .1 to elevate him to power and fame, are all naught-thrown aside-disregarded. Another-and here is a case to which every one will readily find a parallel-with a hawk's eye to his own interest, will devote all the powers, which God has given him for better purposes, to the acquisition and accumulation of wealth. It is no unusual circumstance, that a spendthrift youth is metamorphosed into a grasping man; and an avari- cious, niggardly dotard. Letar had devoted himself, it was shid, to the re-acquisition of his lost estate, and Ellen soon found that his ruling passion was gain. But it is not with Letare's married life we have to do. Passing over a long flight of years, our narrative opens upon a winter evening, in the year 1830; when Briscoe Letar is standing by the bedside of his dying wife, listening to her last request. To understand this request, however, and for other reasons, we must glance over these years. Immediately after his marriage, Letar commenced a life of constant and earnest activity. It was not long before even Mr. Blundell pronounced him " a real man of business; and forgetting his own quarrel with him, after a time, actually proposed and entered with him into a general "'speculating partnership," as he called it; he sharing the profits, while Letare bore the odium, whenever, from the nature of their transactions, any attached. With a large supply of ready money on hand, during the pressing season of the embargo which preceded the last war with England, when capital was worth three times its usual value, a free field of speculation, offering almost incredible profits, was opened to them. When the declaration of war, long foreseen, was made, they suc- ceeded in obtaining a lucrative contract from Government, by which, it was said, that they made heavy profits. About a year after their marriage, Ellen presented her hus- band with a little, tiny son, from the first a sickly, unpromis- ing child. In this little boy, whom he called Bernard, his own father's name, Letare's heart was, from the first, most singularly wrapped. Whatever of affection there was left in his nature, centered upon this sickly child. Little Bernard  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7321-00000042"/> EDITH ALLEN; OR,  seemed to have a share in his every thought. When he would enter the house, his first inquiry was for the child; when he left) his parting kiss was impressed upon its pallid brow. He would sit or walk whole nights with the babe in his arms, when it was ill. Little Bernard died. With him was buried all the tenderness of the father. With a stern carefulness, Le- tare placed, with his own hands, the costly marble slab over his grave, and turned, harder and colder than ever, to his business. Two years afterwards, a daughter was born. This last was a bright little cherub, resembling mother and father. Ellen fondly hoped that her husband's paternal love would be re- vived. But for this daughter he 'seemed to care nothing- never bestowing upon her a caress. About the close of the war, Hawk, from some mismanage- ment and false speculations, found himself very much embar- rassed. There' existed a number of suits soon after, of the style of " Letare vs. Hawk."  They were instituted by Bris- coe Letar, assignee, &amp;c., plaintiff, against Gideon Hawk, de- fendant. They were, for the most part, for small claims; but in the aggregate amounted to a large sum. Soon Longstowe was again in the market. Letar6 was present when it was sold, but did not bid for it. - He said " more advantageous speculations were daily offered."  Thus we learn that Gideon Hawk had been probably ruined at his own game, and that Letar6 was so much absorbed in speculation, as to forget the prime motive, which impelled him to devote himself to the acquisition of wealth. Hawk, in his distress, and in his ef- forts to save himself, swept manii of his debtors before him- among others, Clement Allen;, 1l. Stacey's son-in-law. Old Col. Stacey himself, it was said, was in exceedingly straight- ened circumstances. Soon there appeared in the "Family Visitor," a religious newspaper published in Richmond, an obituary notice of "Mrs. Mary, consort of Clement Allen, Esq., and only daughter of Col. Stacey." To turn to Letar6 and his wife. It is probable that no two persons, who did not absolutely quarrel, ever enjoyed less so-    cial communion. He treated her with constant, undeviating respect; but Ellen soon found that she had given herself to a man, whose affections were more and more concentrated upon gain.  Money-money, was his all-engrossing thought. He dreamed of bonds, mortgages and strong boxes.- There was little companionship between them; and but for her child, the little Edith, whom she had named after her own mother, Ellen would have been a recluse. But she dearly loved her child; and in the isolation in which, as a usurer's wife, she lived, Edith was almost her only companion. She loved her with all a mother's love-and more; for the heart, once so full of romantic attachment to the ideal hero, whom she had named Briscoe Letar6, had, as she by degrees awaked to the fact that she was wedded to a very Demas, and that her hero was a dream-a myth, of her own creating-at length poured all its stores of tenderness and devotion upon the clear- skinned, brown-haired little nursling, who prattled lwe back to her in so many sweet ways. Nor did this love at all abate as the little girl grew older; nor was it the less manifest be- cause the father so evidently cared so little for Edith. Among other means of increasing his wealth, Lctar6, soon after the conclusion of the war, engaged, by means of agents, in the traffic of slaves.  This has ever been treated as a disreputable pursuit in Virginia; and is invariably discoun- tenanced. But Letare had grown somewhat careless of men's opinions. It appears strange that a tender, generous boy, as he once was, .should have become so notorious an usurer, as we afterwards find him, and a negro-trader; but if there be a vice which, more than all others, hardens the soul, and grows upon its votary, it isI avarice; and Letar6 had given himself up to its worship. Some very severely felt losses, in the years 1820-21, made him draw in all his available means, and people began, after this, smilingly to say, that money which once found its way into his hands, was no longer a circulating medium. In 1824, he made his last experiment in negro-trading: an agent, in whom he placed much con- fidence, having suddenly lecamped to "parts unknown," with  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7321-00000043"/> 84         EDITH ALLEN; OR, whatever sums he had been able to collect. The loss was not very large from this; as Letar had ever been very careful to make such arrangements as would place as little temptation as possible before his agents. It was sifficient, nevertheless, to give both him and Mr. Blundell considerable disturbance. His own personal business-that which he entrusted to no one-led him, very frequently, to Richmond, about this time. He had neglected to purchase Longstowe, as we have seen, when he might have done so; and nothing would have seemed now more foreign to his character, than an exhibition of the feelings which had formerly distinguished him. But a deep and bitter hatred towards Hawk and his underlings abode with him, as is shown by a little anecdote, which Mr. Blundell used to tell, of this time. "We were passing down-Letare and I "-said he, "from the old Bell Tavern, in Richmond, conversing. on business  matters, when we came suddenly upon as miserable a looking wretch as ever I saw in my life. He turned away from us, and I should never have known him; but Letar recognized him at a glance: 'Ah, Burser, he said, 'glad to see you- most happy-in your present plight-and hope to see your old master, Hawk, in like circumstances some day. Should  he ever come to such a pass, bid him seek Briscoe Letar; and may be I will aid him, as I will you. You have lent me many a dollar, Burser, when I was hard up.' He took from his pocket a purse, and extracted from it a handful of Spanish gold pieces. 'Goodness,' says I to myself, 'what is the man  about to do?' Burser seemed no less surprised. Letare went ;- on: 'I have, Burser, at my command, some thousands of such as these, for which, I believe that I have no very press- ing use; and, sir,' assuming a whining tone, 'it will afford me great satisfaction, infinite gratification, and heartfelt pleas- ure to help a friend, if you, or your old master, Hawk, will only give me goody responsible security.' If there ever was triumph and hate expressed in a mortal's  eye, it shone in Letare's at that moment. At the mention of  Hawk's name, Burser began to curse bitterly. 'Let's go on,'    SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      85 said Letare to me hastily, 'for fear that I may presently give him a four-penny-bit for cursing Hawk so.'  Letare was at this time a man " whose name "-to use the admiring Mr. Blundell's expression-" made a'bit of a note to which it was attached, just as good as gold." He made many visits to Ohio, and some of the other Western States, he and Blundell having, in their "speculating partnership," bought up a good many "Revolutionary land claims," which, in the swift progress of emigration and civilization, were like to prove valuable. On these, and on other occasions, when he was absent from home, he left Ellen and Edith in the care of our old friend, Ned. He had long ago married Theresa, Ellen's maid-known in the family as "Tea," for short. She had, perhaps, had much to do with Ned's belief, that Miss Transmere was his master's sweetheart, while Letar was yet desperately smitten with Mary Stacey. Their chil- dren were Zelia-a name of Ned's own fancying, and which, he insisted upon it, belonged to his, the "Buckletree family," (he called himself "Mr. Edward Buckletree ;" to use his own expression, "Buckletree was his entitle,")-and young Ned: the former a fine, sprightly girl of sixteen, and the latter- who was called Edward, for distinction's sake-a brisk lad of fourteen, or thereabout. These, with a cook, and one "out- hand," were the only servants whom Letar kept. Ned was a sort of major-domo, or man of all work; and his wife, Tea, was, for her part, a sort of woman of all work. Ned was as faithful and as trust-worthy as ever. He was considerably more sedate and dignified than he had been, as became him, "being a man of fambly," as he said, in speaking of his con- jugal and paternal relations. He was remarkable for his punctilious politeness and respect, both to his mistress and Miss Edith. "Be 'spectful-be perlite-be ready and wil- lin'-show your manners and your raisin'-and folks will like you, and you'll always do well"-were his frequent admoni- tions to young Ned. Under his care, Ellen and Edith felt as safe, and as contented, during Letar's absence, as when he was with them. They spent much of their time, too, at Mr.  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7321-00000044"/> 86'        EDITH ALLEN  OR, Blundell's. Mrs. Letare's health, however, since soon after Edith's birth, had been quite delicate; and it cost her some inconvenience to change her place of abode. With the mo- ther's known tastes, one may easily guess that the two, whether at Elvy's Hill, or at Mr. Blundell's-which was, indeed, only another home for them-spent nkuch of their time with books. As Edith grew up, literature, of another cast and order from that which Ellen had known in her younger days, was intro- duced from the mother country; and books had become acces- sible here, and, in fact, were in everybody's hands. The wild and irregular, but beautiful and bewitching poems of Sir Wal- ter Scott, had found their way hither, and thousands of hearts were throbbing to the music of that "Harp of the North," which, erstwhile, had , Mouldering, hung, By the witch elm which shades St. Fillan's spring." Byron's deeply emotional and soul-stirring poetry, too, was striking hitherto untouched chords in every heart, and the Pilgrimage of his sad "Childe" had made the far occidentals of this hemisphere start to find words capable of being woven into such strains. In prose, too, volume after volume of  those unrivalled romances, written by the then "great un- known"-the "author of Waverley"-were coming in quick, and, it seemed, in never-ending succession, consigning at once the hitherto cherished Sir Charles Grandison, Pamela, and the like, to condign oblivion. It was in these, and the writings, prose and poetical, of other authors of the period, that Mrs. Letar and her fair daughter, though cut off in the main from general social intercourse, had many ideal friends; very dear friends, too, they were, whose companionship af- forded them infinite delight. If the husband and father had only been what he should have been, and could he have shared with them in these gentle, peaceful pleasures-satisfied with such-and had no stain upon his fame, it is difficult to  conceive how the little family could have been happier, or  their quiet enjoyments greater. But he had no share in these    SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      87 gentler pleasures; and during the years in which they thus found so much to delight and amuse them, he had evidently been growing more and more sordid. He did not interfere, however, with their innocent pleasure. The cost of all these books, he vowed, was sufficient to clothe the whole family; but then they Were purchased with Ellen's own money-a small sum reserved to her by Dr. Claiborne. He kept his grumblings and his thoughts to himself. There was one great draw-back to the quiet enjoyments of Ellen and Edith. Mrs. Letar's health, for so many years extremely delicate, was apparently growing gradually more and more so. Like a flower, it seemed that she was fading away. A quiet, unobtrusive flower she had ever been; but her sweetness had not been wholly wasted, for her daughter was devoted to her, with an- unbounded, an almost idolizing attachment; and with such a girl as Edith, the influence of her mother's character could never be lost. In the quiet life which these two led, they had one especial friend: the Reverend Mr. Arthur, formerly mentioned, who visited them occasionally, and manifested a deep interest in them. This intercourse, and a mutually warm friendship with the good old minister, led to Ellen's conversion to Christianity. Little influence could she expect to have, and, indeed, it was little that she had, upon her close, worldly-minded husband. He never derided religion. On the contrary, he always men- tioned the subject with respect. "It was a good thing, he had no doubt. Everybody said so. He knew nothing about it himself;' and, in fact, he cared as little as he knew. "If there are any church expenses, Mrs. Letar must pay them herself." "Missis could'nt be no better, caze she was good as she could be before; but I mighty glad as how she got 'ligion- God bless her!-for she zarves whatsomever is good, I don't care what 'tis," was Ned's conclusion. Speaking of Ellen, and her daughter, as we vere, it would have been strange if Edith, under her gentle tutelage, had not been as charming and sweet in mind and character, as in per-  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7321-00000045"/> 88        EDITH ALLEN; OR, son. In manners, she was shy and timid; the result of her retired and secluded life, as well as of her natural disposition; but her's was a modest timidity, which accorded well with her peculiar style of beauty. Elderly people pronounced her al- most the exact counterpart of what her mother had been, at the same age. Younger observers, while admitting that Mrs. Letare was a very lovely, sweet-looking lady, for one of her age and ill health, were, nevertheless, at a loss to conceive how she could ever have been so beautiful as her daughter, the fair Edith. There was, doubtless, a very striking resemblance between the two; for once, in the church-yard, during her father's absence upon his last western trip, and when her mo- ther was not with her, an elderly, good-looking gentleman had stood before and stared at Edith very earnestly. Coloring, she turned away; when he approached and apologized for his rudeness. "I once knew your mother," he said; "she was a valued friend of mine; and you are very like her. My name is Fitzgerald." When Edith, upon her return home, told her mother of this, Mrs. Letare was lost, for a time, in the recollection of the past.                           !  "Yes," she said, "he was a very dear friend of mine; I should like well to see him." There was a pause, for a moment or two, while she seemed to be wrapt in thought. "He was dressed in deep mourning," said Edith. "Ah!-I hope he has not lost his wife. He married his cousin, and moved off to-I forget where he went. She was said to be a very fine, and a very lovely woman." He was with old Mr. Brandt-and "--'Edith stammered and blushed a little-" and young Mr. Allen." "Ah!--How singular!" "What, ma?" Why, that young Allen should be there too."  Edith colored still more, and looked up at her enquiringly.  Her mother, it was evident was not thinking of her.    i ,s   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      89 "Why, ma, was this so singular?" "Why?-Oh, to be sure, because Mr. Fitzgerald was once a lover of his mother, Mary Stacey." "And was he not a lover of my mother too?"Edith pre- sently asked. "Yes, my dear, afterwards." A slight flush passed over Mrs. Letare's pale features, as she acknowledged it. "He ad- dressed me at the same time that your father did. But I had loved your father for a long time-ever since he saved me from the mad dog that I have so often told you about." "Well, it was singular. How he must have felt at seeing us both there together! And he loved Mrs. Allen! She was very beautiful, I think I have heard you say?" "Yes, very. But she was a coquettish girl, and deceived him, and your father too, who also loved her, very cruelly." And Mrs. Letare now told her attentive daughter the story of her husband's love for Mary Stacey; with which the reader is acquainted. "And that is the reason, my dear," she went on, "why your father dislikes the Aliens so; and will account to you for his rude treatment of young Clem. Allen on that even- ing when he came home with us from your uncle Blundell's. It frets him sometimes only to hear the names, Stacey and Allen." "Oh, I am so sorry'!-ma!"-and Edith, bursting into tears, leaned her head upon her mother's shoulder. "What, my dear; what is the matter?" "Oh, ma!" "Well, what?-darling, tell mie!" "Clement Allen loves me!" Mrs. Letare started, though young Allen's attention to her daughter had not escaped her notice. "And you, my daughter?" "Yes-ma." "Love him?" "Yes." "Hush, Edith!-you must not say so.

"My poor child !-And does he know that you love him ?" Yes-that is, I have given him no promise-but I told him that I would tell you. And I have tried to tell you ever since; but did not know how."                 I And the mother and daughter had a long cry together; and all the mother's sympathies were aroused; and she promised to think over the matter, and do what she could. For all her own old feelings were at once revived, in these troubles of her darling child. And they both did think over the matter a great deal; and devised plans between them for overcoming Mr. Letare's op- position. Edith was full of hope in the efficacy of her mo- ther's interposition; but Mrs. Letar6 knew better. Besides her husband's long-cherished sense of injury, she thought of the fact, that young Allen was poor; and her heart misgave her. She sought to encourage Edith as little as, with all her tender and expressed sympathy with her, she was able to do; and warned her of the frailty of any hopes founded upon her interference. For her own part, she liked young Allen; and, when all circumstances were considered, nothing, indeed, could have afforded her more satisfaction, than -to see her beloved daughter united to an affectionate and good husband, whom she could love. It was true, that Edith was very young; but  .then her own health was rapidly failing, and the future wel- fare of Edith had been long a matter of her most earnest so- licitude. "It is, darling," she said one day, while speaking on this subject, "my chief worldly concern. As- you and Mr. Allen love each other, it would give me great satisfaction to see you united before I go-to leave you, dear Edith." "XWhat, mother?   Oh, do not talk so!" she answered, grasping her hand and pressing it affectionately to her lips, Yes, Edith, it is right that I should talk thus. It is very evident, dear, that I cannot long be with you; and  " "Oh, hush, mother, hush! you must not." And the weep- ing girl, who had just now, for the first time, observed the   SKETCIHES OF LIFE IN viLGINlA.       91   extreme attenuation of that hand which she held, and now looked through her streaming tears upon the thin, the very thin, and pallid features of that beloved face, and marked the singular lustre of those large, gentle eyes, could say no more. After this very painful awakening to her dear mother's ac- tual feebleness, it was observable that Edith Letare seemed to think a great deal less of young Allen than she had hitherto done.  They were at Mr. Blundell's when this conversation took place. Here, young Mr. Allen frequently called upon them. He never did so, however, when they were at home, at Elvy's Hill, since Mr. Letare had almost insulted him. In her behavior towards him, Edith was kind, at the same time that she was very guarded; avoiding, with an adroitness which every woman understands, anything which could be construed into a committal on her part. But he knew that she was not indifferent to his love; and a confession, at length, to Mrs. Letar6, when Edith would no longer permit him to talk to her about such matters, of his love for her daughter, led to an ex- planation from this lady, of the peculiar circumstances in which they were placed. Like Edith, he counted miuch on Mrs. Letare's interposition, and was exceedingly grateful to this good lady for her interest in him. When, after rather more than six months' absence from home, Mr. Letare returned from his trip to the West, Mr. Blundell was the first to inform him of his suspicions, that young Allep was in love with his daughter-a bitter, scornful laugh was the only reply. He had never seemed to have- certainly had never-exhibited, any feelings of affection for his daughter; but he ever treated her with consideration and respect-the same sort of behavior which marked his deport- ment and conduct towards his wife.    He now, however, informed her, in a harsh tone, that he wished her to cultivate no beggarly acquaintances, such as he heard had been hanging around her during his absence. "She understood him," he continued, as he turned away, "and had better look to it that his wishes were attended to." Any hopes, which Edith might have still clung to, founded &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7321-00000047"/> 92         EDITH ALLEN; OR, upon her mother's intercession, were soon crushed; for when Mrs. Letare had, after a time, mentioned, casually, that they had found, while he was gone, a very pleasant acquaintance in young Mr. Allen, whom they had occasionally seen at Mr. Blundell's, he at once broke out into a storm of rage, such as he had never before exhibited in her presence; cursing the whole race of Allens, the Staceys, and whoever was, or sought to be, connected with them. He wanted no such acquaint- ance -in his family-would admit none. Excepting in this matter, however, Mr. Letar was, for a time, after his return, in a remarkably fine humor; and his keen eye glittered with even more brightness than usual-that peculiar lustre which the eye of the usurer, and none other, almost invariably wears; for he had succeeded in disposing of his Western lands to very great advantage. Not very long after his return, he made a- visit, on business, to Richmond, accompanied by Mr. Blundell--though this latter gentleman was now grown somewhat infirm and decrepid. Edith had nothing left her, but to inform Clement Allen of her father's deep, fixed and insuperable opposition to even an acquaintanceship between them; of the utter frailty of all their hopes; to give him her good wishes, and to bid him adieu. These sad mes- sages did not reach him at once. At least, several days, inter- vened before she heard from him; when he most earnestly sought an interview with her, This, she of her own choice declined, not even consulting her mother about it; as Mrs. Letare had, with' the -cold weather, grown much more feeble, and Edith did not wish to give her trouble. In the mean time, Mr. Letar had unexpectedly returned. By an abrupt entrance, on the day after his arrival, into her room, where he scarcely ever intruded, and had come on this occasion only; for the purpose of making some enquiry of her, he saw Edith reading over, for the fiftieth time, Clement Allen's note. She endeavored to conceal it. He marked the attempt, took it from her, and read it. "And you have answered this?" looking to the date. "I have, sir."   SKETCHES OF LIFE TN VIRGINIA.       93 "And, of course, have denied his request?" he asked, sternly. "I have, sir." "You did well ;" and he tossed the note back to her. "I did not wish to trouble your mother, and so came to ask you where she keeps the file of newspapers, which I requested her' to have put away." Edith told him, and he left her. That. night, she sat gazing, sadly enough, upon the fitful fire-light, as it played upon her floor, vieing with her untrim- med lamp. All out was dark and still. The young moon was long since down, and the stars were dimmed by a hazy atmosphere.  The weather was somewhat cold, too; and it was certainly not a suitable night for a serenade. But its stillness was presently broken by a distinct voice beneath her window. Oh, that voice! She recognized its first intonation. And oh, her father'! She knew that he was awake; for she had heard him moving in the room above her only a moment before. Her lover sang one or two stanzas of a tender madri- gal, and each syllable struck distinctly on her ear, terrified as she was. But the singer was suddenly interrupted, as an upper window was thrown open, and a fierce voice demanded: "Who is there?"  {'Who is there?--I say!" ,  "Well, I guess I'll make you tell!" as the muzzle of a blunderbuss was protruded from the window, and immediately afterwards the whole house was shaken with the report. "There! you see what awaits errant minstrels here; and had, in future, best take your dolorous ditties elsewhere." Mrs. Letarp, who had been all day confined to her couch by feebleness, was frightened almost beside herself. Poor Edith ran shrieking to the window. She saw, by the dim starlight, some one moving easily away. "Thank God!" she exclaimed, "he is not hurt!" 'Oh! 'tis nothing to go into fits about," said Letar to his wife. "I only wished to give the young villain a little hint. He was not worth the load-the loss is the only thing to be - regretted." In the morning Mrs. Lctare was much worse. She could  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7321-00000048"/> "        EDITH ALLEN; OR,.  not recover from the shock and alarm of the night; and had, besides, taken fresh cold. Doctor Claiborne, who had been attending her for some time, was sent for. He was now quite  an old man, and had many years since retired from the prac- tice of his profession, except among a few particular friends.  He had long ago lost all personal regard for Letar; but he felt a deep, a sort of paternal interest in Ellen and Edith. Perhaps he felt that he had been forward in promoting the marriage of Letar with the former. He had kindly informed  Edith, some time before, that her mother was in a very preca- rious state of health; indeed, confirmed what Mrs. Letare herself had told her, that she was gradually passing away. "And how is she to-day, Doctor?" asked the anxious girl, as he left the sick room, and she met him in the passage, where she had been waiting to make the enquiry.  "She appears to be. very feeble-very." He said no more, but his tone and solemn manner alarmed her. She was, her-  I self, sick to-day--poor girl-hardly able to hold her head up.  We have before hinted, that when she first became aware of  her mother's delicate state of health, her previous troubles  were merged in this greater one, which seemed to threaten her. On this morning, all her other cares than those for her  mother, were thrown aside. Oh, what were her love-griefs to  the sufferings and impending loss of this dear, dear mother!  Her burning, throbbing brow-her last night's alarm-her weariness, which had oppressed her almost to inability to move-her hopeless love, which had sunk her into despond- ency-were nothing-were disregarded, when she heard that her mother was worse. But the contemplation of that sweet, i but frail and dying mother, with her beautiful and devoted !, daughter hanging around, and gently tending her with the watchful care of a guardian spirit, awakens emotions which  must not be lightly inscribed in these rambling pages. /    SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      95 A FORTNIGPT had elapsed. Mrs. Letare was constantly dc- clining-was now dying. When her husband perceived that he was about to lose her-that she would be soon taken from him-from him who so little deserved her-she, the devoted, gentle and true-who, had he only allowed her, would have been such a wife as only the very best men deserve-his better nature was aroused, and he felt a remorseful pang. The wealth of worlds could never have purchased the priceless love which he had left uncherished. He could not regard her otherwise than as a meek and uncomplaining victim; the ten- derest hopes and feelings of whose life he had blasted. In her last hours, even avarice was subdued for the time; and the miser approached his wife with a tenderness which he had never exhibited before. A joy thrilled the feeble frame of the dying woman-a sweet echo of past hopes. "Oh, my husband-my dear husband! Lord! I thank thee for this!" She lay for a long time with his hand clasped to her bosom, seemingly free from pain, and happy; for a serene smile trembled and settled on her pallid counte- nance. "My husband, I am leaving you now. My prayers have ever been for you, and I pray for you still. May God, in His mercy, draw you to Him!" "Mr. Letare, I have one dying request to make of you, and you must grant it." "Ask what you will, my dearest; it is granted already, if it be in my power," stammered Letar, with emotion." "Doctor Claiborne-where is he?"  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7321-00000049"/> 96        EDITH ALLEN; OR, "I am here, my dear madam," said-the old doctor. "Ah! I wished you to be present." There was a pause for a few moments. "I beg of you, Mr. Letar," she presently  went on, " that you will lay aside and forego your enmity and dislike to the Staceys and the Allens, and that you will con- sent to the union of Clement Allen with our dear Edith." Letar started, when these names were mentioned, and he drew back at her last request.               This is my dying request, my dear husband! You will not deny me-will you?"                  : "No, Ellen-my poor, dear wife ---I can refuse you nothing."                         : "Then, you promise me?-you consent?"  Yes, I do."  "Thank you, Briscoe!-thank you! You have removed a  load of care from my mind!" She again closed her eyes with i the same quiet smile. "Draw nearer, Briscoe!-nearer Edith, : love!-nearer to me, dear, dear ones-I am going. God bless  these!-and accept me!"  She said no more; but sank into a light slumber, appa-  rently, from which she never awoke, though she continued  some time longer to breathe. After a while, however, all was still. None could tell the exact moment when she died; she had no struggle, and had passed away as it was meet that  such a gentle being should pass from earth  And where was Edith all this while? Of course, she was  there, near to her mother, touching her, ministering to her wants-endeavoring, for her sake, to restrain the wild grief  which almost choked her. But, in speaking of this painful  trial, we have wished to present only what was necessary for  the purposes of our narrative, drawing a curtain over all the rest.  - The Rev. Mr. Arthur had been sent for, at Mrs. Letare's request; but owing to accident he did not arrive until an hour, at least, after she had breathed her last. To him we leave the grief-stricken Edith; and to good old Doctor Clai- borne, and old Mrs. Blundell, who was present, as was also * *                 U   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      97 Miss Jemima Brandt, a sister of our old acquaintance-an elderly, but very efficient lady-who had been with Mrs. Le- tare for sometime past as assistant nurse and attendant. There were many of the neighbors present, too, of both sexes, ready to assist in anything. Death hath its claims; and among plain country folk, these are rarely withheld; and friendly attentions are usually extended, whatever be the char- acter and standing of the bereaved. We have said, that Mr. Letare, perhaps, loved his wife at the time of their marriage, as well as it was possible for him to love any one. Such a character as her's he could not but respect. :Hei unpretending truthfulness, her meek uprightness, quiet dignity, and inoffen- sive integrity; with her cultivated taste, and modest, yet graceful, and winning behavior, could not fail to make an im- pression on any one who was thrown into her society. We have said, that he was touched with remorse when he saw her dying before him. Avarice was, for the-time, subdued; with a tenderness, never manifested before, he approached her side. Yet, when she was actually dead and the momentary excite- ment over, the pain, which the loss of some one, to whom we are accustomned, whether loved or not, ever gives, was, perhaps, in his case, quickly succeeded by a feeling of relief. Her presence had ever beena constraint upon him. Her virtues and good qualities were ever accusing him; the contrast was constantly felt. His selfishness and sordidness were rebuked before her. It is'contrary to man's fallen nature to enjoy in- tercourse with any one who makes him feel his own unworthi- ness. Nor can he look with more satisfaction on one whom he has wronged and deceived. Of his promise to-that dying wife, he thought not, until, at the grave, he saw young Allen, among the other neighbors who had assembled there to pay their last respects to the departed. As the sight of blood affects some animals, the sight of an Allen affected him; and the old hate rankled in his heart, even there, and at that solemn moment, when the last rites were performed over the remains of his wife, and her coffin was consigned to the grave. For Edith -poor- Edith!-but we would not, if we could, 5  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7321-00000050"/> 98         EDITH ALLEN; OR, and we could not, if we would, depict her wild grief at the loss of her, mother. Doctor- Claiborne endeavored to induce her to go to his house, and spjend some time with his family; but she declined. Mrs. Blundell-or her aunt Blundell, as she called her--wished to take her home with her for the present; but Edith refused. In her utter desolation of heart, these kind attentions were painful to her. She shunned them. All company was disagreeable, and she sought solitude, that she might indulge her grief uninterruptedly. A common, a mutual bereavement, would seem to draw those who suffer under it -nearer together. This, however, is only an after effect.. Deep grief is essentially selfish. It is unwilling to be disturbed, or distracted; and all attempts 'to console it are hateful. Edith had never loved her father. She had been taught, it is true, to pay him respect and obedi- ence. But he. had never won her to love him. She, in fact, rather feared him; at least, any natural attachment which she may have entertained for him, was very much mixed with other feelings. Had he shared her heart and love, with her mother, she would perhaps have sooner sought hilM to partake of her grief too. - As it was, sometime elapsed before it even occurred to her memory that she had a father; and it was then rather the remembrance of her mother's admonitions, and en- deavors to teach her to love that father, than aught else, which at-length impelled her to seek him. She found him in his own room, with pencil and paper in hand, at a table, on which was a heap of gold, silver and bank-notes, which, upon her entrance, he at first tried to conceal. She paused-taken all aback; for she had forgotten to knock, and was in the room before she thought of it; but she was immediately shocked at his em- ployment. It seemed to her a profanation. As she stood still, he spoke: What do you want? Come in. What are you standing     I there for?" "I was not aware that you were engaged, sir," she stam- mered, scarcely able to command her voice. "Oh, well--come in, and say what you have got to say * **  '  * i   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      99 That money is not mine-at least, you need not look at it so hard. Not a cent of it will you or your beggar lover ever get. I suppose that you've come to remind me of my promise. You are somewhat quick. Ah, well, Edith-there!-there!"-as a look of profound distress and horror met his eye, and re- called him to a sense of his injustice. "You need not look so, child. I beg your pardon--I was not thinking-you see I was busy. Better go to your room, dear--you will be better there. (I cannot see why upon earth she would not go to Dr. Claiborne's, when he pressed her so.) There, go to your room, child." And as she obeyed, and went out, he locked the door behind her. And this was the first meeting between parent and child, after the other parent had been laid in the grave, only the day before. Mr. Letare, after the death of his wife, reduced his estab- lishment, which, he said, was unnecessarily large. The cook and field hand mentioned before were dispensed with. Tea, Ned's wife, being looked to for supplying the, place of the former, while aNed and his son had thrown upon them the labors of the latter. It was not long before Mr. Blundell called upon them. He came to renew the invitation, which his wife had pressed upon Edith, to spend some time with them. He and Mr. Lctar6 had not agreed so well of late as they had formerly done. There were some occasional differ- ences between them, in the settlement of their monetary con- nections. Each was close, sharp and suspicious. The differ- ence of a few cents would make a great matter with either. Circumstances had led Mr. Blundell to trust much to Letar; but the latter was growing more and more close and hard in his dealings, and some little advantages, which had for- merly been allowed to Mr. Blundell, had now, for a good while, been withheld. Thus, Letare claimed a small per cdtage for collecting their moneys, which it went much against his partner's grain to allow. Some slight losses which they had recently sustained, in a shipment of tobacco, were felt keenly by both of them. They disagreed about their shares in these, and came almost to an open rupture in con-   &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7321-00000051"/> 100       o EDITH ALLEN; OR, nection with some insurance charges. They were each grow- ing constantly more and more sensitive as to such matters. Nevertheless, both Blundell and his wife, especially the latter, felt kindly towards Edith. Mrs. Blundell was a simple-   hearted, affectionate old lady. She had ever loved Edith, as she had also loved her mother; and Edith liked her now, perhaps,. more than ever, for that mother's sake. Like many old persons, who, having no children of their own, grow fond of those of other people, Mrs. Blundell was very partial to the company of the young, and, of course, was with such a prime favorite. It was owing to this circumstance, that Edith had frequently met and become acquainted with Clement Allen, who, whenever he was in the neighborhood, at his grandfather's-and for several years past he had spent much of his time at Stacey Home-invariably paid the old lady some attentions. Mrs. Blundell was an especial crony with a grand-child of her husband, Caleb Blundell Jones, or, ac- cording to his own pronunciation, "Calap Bwundaow Jonth," whose mother, being a nervous invalid, was very willing that the noisy brat should be a favorite at "ole gwanther's," (old grand-sire's,) where, indeed, he was a very important char- acter. Edith had not long been at Mr. Blundell's, whither she went in a few days, when Clement Allen called upon her. He deeply and tenderly lamented with her the loss of their dear mother and friend. Of course, their love was not men- tioned. Dr. Claiborne and Mrs. Blundell had both told him of the promise which Mr. Letar had made to her when she was dying; and if young Allen had not before loved Edith's mother, this would have made him almost worship her mem- ory. But he had loved her before, and Edith knew that he had; and the knowledge made her feel yet more bound to him, and rendered their intercourse less constrained. This  partition of her grief rendered it less poignant, and this ten-  der sympathy gave much relief to Edith. The Rev. Mr. Arthur, too, to whom she looked, and on whom she leaned with a filial trust, was very attentive to her. There was com-   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      101 fort for Edith in his very presence. Nor was his serious but kind conversation at all ungrateful to her in her present des- pondency. She remained for many weeks at Mr. Blundell's. A visit to old Dr. Claiborne's, which she had purposed, was from time to time deferred, chiefly because there were young people there; and she felt herself wholly unequal to the task of quieting her feelings sufficiently to enter into general so- ciety. The old Doctor called to see her frequently. Miss Ellie Claiborne, his daughter, also called upon her, with Miss Henshaw, her cousin, a niece of Mrs. Claiborne, who resided at the doctor's. Among them, they extorted a promise from Edith that she would soon pay them a good long visit. Ex- cept a desire to go to her mother's grave, Edith did not much wish to be at Elvy's Hill. It no longer appeared as a home to her. When she did return, her father did not come to meet her. He was busy at the time; and when they pre- sently met, his greeting seemed to be mechanical; for he was making a calculation, in which he was again instantly en- grossed. Thus it appeared to her; but the fact was, that Letare felt a little ashamed at her presence; for she directly found that a considerable change had been effected in her absence. A good deal of the furniture, to which she had been accustomed, was missing; almost all, indeed, which was really valuable. Where upon earth were the chairs, and tables, and the books, and Abureaus-almost everything? "Done sole, Miss Edith-done sole!" "Sold! How sold? Who sold them?" "Marster, marm. He sell 'em to-rectly." Sold!" "Yes, Miss Edith, putty nighly every thing-Mistiss' pe- anner (piano) and all i" This was too much. "Marster say," continued Theresa, who was her indignant informer of this sacrilege, as it seemed to her, which had been committed in her absence-"Marster say, we's all been livin' so 'stravagant here, 'tell he's all but ruined. He talk, he couldn't 'ford to keep sech trumpery no longer; and he b  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7321-00000052"/> 102       ' EDITH ALLEN; OR, took and sole most all your books too; and he say he 'spec' he'll have to sell us next." All these latter words, however, were uttered to heedless ears. A torpor seemed, for the moment, to have seized on  i Edith's faculties; while her features, too, assumed a pale  rigidity.  "Oh, he has not, Tea-he has not?" she presently ex- claimed, as the blood came back to her face, and tears of in- dignation burst from her eyes. "Yes, he has, Miss Edith-that he has! and everybody talking, too, 'bout how rich he is!" And those dear, familiar objects-each one connected with some cherished recollection-yes, they were gone! Edith threw herself upon her bed, in an agony of grief. "Oh, my mother!" She hastily arose, and seizing upon a shawl and bonnet, which lay near, hurried out. Beside the purely white and glittering marble slab, which marked her little brother's grave, there was a longer mound of red earth. No costly sculptured monument was here, to tell where her mother lay. A common, rude stone was at the head; another at the foot of the grave. There were plenty of such all around. Red-oh, so red, and cold-covered, as it was, with the stained hoar-frost-and rude was this grave-the last resting-place of that sweet, gentle mother. At its head, Edith knelt, leaning over the rude stone-"My mother!- oh! my mother!" That is a heart-touching cry, whenever heard. Uponj the Rio GrandB, at the camp below Mier, we once heard it break upon the stillness of the night, from a tent near that in  which we lay, as a dying soldier called upon his mother, far away-"My mother!-oh, my mother!"   We became after- wards very callous, by familiarity with sights and sounds of suffering; but never while we live will we forget that heart- i i thrilling, midnight cry of the dying soldier. Edith soon found that her father had established a parsimo- nious economy in his .household management. He said that the family had gotten into very wasteful habits, and he chose '    SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      103 to keep house himself. She did not complain of the hardness of their fare. But the negroes complained loudly. "He whomsoever don't eat, neither shall he wuk (work)," Ned declared, "was Scriptur'." "And, besides, Miss Edith," said Theresa, "you knows, yourself, how. we aint had no winter clothes this winter. Mistis warn't able to 'tend to this, and marster 'clara if we say clothes to him again he'll sell every one on us; and, for my part, I don't see what difference it makes how soon he do." "Ef white folks ken live 'pon nothing, nigger can't,'" in- sisted Ned; "nigger 'bleeged to eat. He aint no manner of account 'pon the face of the uth (earth), epcepin' he got something to go 'pon; and that's a fact." Mr. Letar did, indeed, soon become so parsimonious and close, as to stint both his family and himself, even in the com- mon necessaries of life; and his constant complaint was, that every thing was going to ruin through wastefulness-that his was the most extravagant family that he ever heard of. They all, at Elvy's Hill, carried on, he said, as if he was worth millions; whereas, he was, in truth, just upon the brink of ruin. Several days had elapsed since Edith's return from Mr. Blundell's, when one day her father tossed over to her a note: "There," he said, "there's a note from a friend of yours," in a sarcastic tone. Edith had known the hand-writing at a glance, while he yet held it. Indeed, she and Clement Allen had agreed, while she was at Mr. Blundell's, that he should, after a while, write to Mr. Letare. "Young Mr. Allen," her father went on, with a sneering utterance of the name, "requests permission to pay his re- spects-his respects, forsooth!-to you, Miss. But you can read his note for yourself. What I wish to tell you of, is my reply. I told him that I promised to consent to his marriage with you. It was an extorted promise, made when I was ex- cited, and knew not what I said; but-nay, you need not start or look so frightened-I told him that I should keep it;  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7321-00000053"/> 104        EDITH ALLEN; OR,  and that I would give my consent to this union whenever it shall be wished. But, mark me! 1 told him further, and I tell you, that my conseit is all that I will give-not one cent will I give you. I have not toiled to make a fortune for an  Allen, I can assure you; nor, indeed, for any other silly young  jackanapes, who may think to gain wealth by winning your  ! foolish heart. And the moment that you marry him, you are a beggar. Understand me! this is no idle threat. It is true as gospel; I swear it to you! I gave him, and I now give you, leave to marry just as soon as you please. I guess, however, that he will scarcely trouble you again; for there is some difference between a portionless bride and an heiress, as .  he and other fools, doubtless, think you."  Edith knew not what to say, and she said nothing. She endeavored to look over Mr. Allen's note; but she could neither make out its meaning, nor, indeed, see it at all, she was so bewildered. And yet, it was a plain, simple, respect-  ful note, asking leave, as her father had told her, to pay his respects toher-making no allusion whatever to Mr. Letare's promise to his dying wife; only saying, that this request would not take him by surprise, as he was aware of the attachment i which existed between the writer and Edith; and that it would have been made sooner, but that the writer hesitated to intrude upon the privacy of grief.  Her father having left it with her, however, Edith had full opportunity to study it at leisure. In the course of the day,  she offered to return it. "Nay, nay," said her father, "you may keep the precious epistle yourself. His autograph is worthless with me. His  name attached to a piece of paper, whatever might precede it, would, in my opinion, not add much to its value." And with this hit at young Allen's poverty, he was turning away, when "Zely" handed another billet, in the same hand-writing. "Colonel Stacey's man brought this, sir." "Ah! He addresses himself to you this time, I see," said Letar6, handing the letter, or rather tossing it, to Edith. He   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       105 left the room muttering, "The fellow keeps up a somewhat quick correspondence, at all events." Yes, it was the well-known hand-writing: "To Miss Edith Letare." Edith hurried off to her own room, where, by Zely's kind industry, she had a small fire of dry, dead sticks: an unnecessary consumption of fuel having latterly been discovered by her father, to be one of the many quick ways by which his family was bringing him to ruin. Before breaking the seal, she paused to examine it. How we do sometimes linger over a letter before opening it! and yet, the uncertainty is far from pleasant. Tearing the enclosure open, she read: "DEAR-VERY DEAR EDITH: "To a note, which I this morning addressed to your father, in accordance with our agreement, requesting permission to visit you, and in which you will not doubt but that I made use of only the most respectful terms, I have received a most cruel reply. Passing by my request, he said, that he had promised to consent to our union; and that this promise he was ready to comply with at any time; but in the same sentence, dear Edith, he goes on to tell me-I shall not repeat to you the harsh expressions which he used in doing so-that, from the moment which sees us united, you are no longer his daugh- ter; but that he'will discard and disinherit you at once. Ho sneer- ingly hints his presumption, that this information will be a quietus to my pretensions, insinuating that it was for your wealth that I 'sought you. You, dear Edith, know better than this. You know, that it is for your own dear self I love you. That very wealth has, in truth, been the chief obstacle in my way in making advances to you. I never felt the curse of poverty until now. Had I worlds of wealth, I would lay it all, dear girl, at your feet. I love you. I love but you alone. I love you with my whole heart, Edith! But have I the right, for the sake of that love, to seek to drag you down to-my pov- erty? That is the question. I will see you to-morrow. I write now, that you may think, in the- meantime, of these matters, and determine what we are to do. "With the deepest respect, and Ale truest affection, "CLEMENT ALLEN." When Edith had perused this, she reflected for a moment She rang a little hand bell, which summoned Zely. "Has the servant who brought this letter gone?"  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7321-00000054"/> 106        EDITH ALLEN; OR, "He's just starting now, marm." ' "Ask him to wait a minute."  She opened a little escritoir ' and hastily wrote: "MR. ALLEN: "DEAR CLEMENT, I should say. I have no right to ask you to take a portionless bride. You are free, and I have no claims upon you, if you wish it to be so. But if you want me, Clement, you have-but you know what it is I would say. Thus, you see, the de-  cision is thrown all upon yourself. "  In very great haste, "EDITH LETARE." There is a tone about this hasty little billet, which some might censure as unmaidenly, if it be not kept in mind that Clement Allen was Edith's almost only young companion; that they had been much together, and were very intimate; and that he had the full approval of her dear mother; in short, that Edith was a simple, trusting, loving girl, who, en- tertaining the fullest confidence in her lover, answered him unhesitatingly, according to the unrestrained dictates of her own heart. We pass over the meeting of the lovers. Mr. Letar chose, when he saw young Allen approaching, to absent himself; that is, he shut himself closely in his room. We pass over young Allen's unwillingness to bring her whom he loved down to his poverty; his protestations of unfailing devotion' to her; and his inability to give her up-all expressed in the same breath. We pass over Edith's delicate intimations, with a care for her father's fame, which 'Mr. Letare himself little felt-that she could not well be poorer elsewhere, than she was likely to become at home; after which, young Allen first observed the niggardly economy which pervaded the apart- ment, though Edith had done her very best, in this one room,  to preserve appearances. Three weeks more had gone by,  during which Clement Allen several times called upon Edith.  On the last occasion, he had brought to her father a letter from an old acquaintance of ours. Before laying this, and the reply which was made to it, before the reader, we will pre- a     ,    .    t ti   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       107 mise, that when Dr. Claiborne first communicated to Mr. Allen the fact that Letar, in consequence of his dying wife's re- quest, had promised to consent to his union with Edith, there had very naturally arisen between the two a confidence in con- nection with this matter; the old doctor expressing a kind interest in his success, and the young lover being grateful for the information conveyed, as well as flattered by his good wishes. This confidence had been kept up, and young Allen, after the reception of Mr. Letar's letter to him, in his per- plexity, had freely laid his embarrassments before his old friend. Dr. Claiborne's contempt and indignation was aroused by such a letter, which he considered as a virtual abnegation, on Le- tare's part, of his solemn promise; nor did he hesitate to speak out his opinion to Mr. Brandt and other friends with whom he met. The letter was as follows: "To BRISCOE LETARE, EsQ: "Sir,--When you cast your eye to the foot of this sheet, and see whose name is there; and when memory flies back to the period which the sight of that name will naturally recall to you, I make no doubt that you will be, at least, disposed to give your attention to the proposition which I am about to lay before you. I am seeking to give ry nephew, Stephen Powell-a sister's son in whom I am much interested-a start in life. He is a young man of good habits, and fine promise. From his very childhood, almost, he has been in the counting-room of a dry goods' merchant; and will thus be prepared with much practical experience, to follow the business with reference to which he has been thus educated. I do not pretend to be able to start him as I could wish. I am, therefore, seeking for him a part- ner, who, in conjunction with him, may take a stand in the business world, more respectable, by a combination of capital, at the same time, that it will be much more likely to prove successful. I have found, sir, just such a partner as I could wish for my nephew, in young Ir. Allen, through whom this comes to you, but who knows nothing of the proposal contained in it; whose inclinations, and whose earlier habits, lead him, I find, to engage in mercantile pur- suits; and between whom, and your daughter, I have heard, you may well believe with no little interest, that there exists a mutual attach- ment. Now, sir, I propose to place in my nephew's hands--I mean to lend him free of interest--any sum from say six (for less will not  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7321-00000055"/> 108         EDITH ALLEN ; OR,  well do) to ten thousand dollars, as we may think advisable; provided that you will entrust the like amount to Mr. Allen, for the purpose of opening a mercantile establishment in Richmond; thus giving the young folks a start in life, and the means of subsistence. This pro- posal, in itself, shews you my confidence in my nephew-in his char- acter, habits, and abilities. It is hastily laid before you, for your consideration, in this general-way; for, if the plan at all pleases you, we can afterwards, you know, make any amendments, restrictive or otherwise, which may seem to us advisable. I will, at present, only say further, that if you think me too partial to my nephew, and too confident in him, I have only to refer you to Messrs. --- &amp; --, with whose highly respectable and well known house he has for some years past been connected. "Your very obedient servant, "STEPHEN FITZGERALD." "P. S.-I am at Mr. Brandt's, where I expect to remain for some days, and where I should be pleased to see you, should this proposal find favor with you; or where a letter directed to his care will reach me at once.                     S. F." Letare's reply, which we promised to give, was short. It ran as follows: "To Mr. STEPHEN FITZGERALD: "Dear Sir,-Yours of yesterday came to hand immediately. Had it-come from any other individual than yourself, it would have, perhaps, remained unanswered. To you I have to reply, that I have no interest whatever in Mr. Clement Allen; and further, that if Edith Letard marries him, she is no longer a daughter of mine, and will be no more to me, than any other woman. For yourself, sir, and for your nephew, whom I remember .to have seen in Richmond, accept my good wishes.     I "I remain, yours, &amp;c. "BRISCOE LETARE." Miss 'Semima Brandt, who resided with her brother, had been unwell for several days past; and Dr. Claiborne chanced to be present when this note of Letaro's was received. Mr. Fitzgerald, after glancing at it himself, handed it over to the doctor and to Mr. Brandt. "I told you so," said the latter. "I knew it. Money from Letare! My dear sir, he does not, and he never did, care one g    SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.   109   straw for his daughter. What he loves, and all he loves, is his money. Besides, he heartily hates the Allens, one and all. I think it highly probable, for his daughter's part, that he would like well enough to be quietly, and without expense, rid of her. But money from him-and for Clem. Allen!-Bless you, no. He is a miser, sir-growing more and more so daily. You appear surprised at my remark, in connection with his daugh- ter. Well, sir, no such man can bear the sight of an heir, or -of any one who has, or seems to have, a claim upon the much loved hoards. Yours was a kind scheme, sir, but I knew it would fail." "I feel much interest," said Mr. Fitzgerald, " in both the young people. Young Allen seems to be a fine fellow--and, especially, in her: she is a sweet looking girl. Poor thing! I pity her." S "She is as fine a girl as ever lived, sir," said Dr. Claiborne. "Her mother's own daughter, and deserving a better father than she has-as her mother deserved a better husband." "And you say that Allen has little or nothing?" "( His father died a bankrupt, or little better; and his grand- father, old Colonel Stacey, is hard pressed to 'make both ends meet.' Most of the property which the old man holds, be- longs to his grand-son, Edward Stacey, having been secured to his mother by the acute management of her father, old Barrington." "Col. Stacey was once well off, to say the least, I believe?" asked Mr. Fitzgerald. "Yes," Mr. Brandt replied. "Had quite a pretty property once.  Married a poor girl, in the first place. His great fault, however, has ever been his inability to say, no. Would go security for any one who asked him-couldn't refuse. Ruined, of course." "He has done all that he could do for young Alien-'has educated him,"-said the Doctor. "It had been better for him, perhaps, had he permitted him to remain in the counting-room, where he was for a while, since he seems to prefer a merchant's life."  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7321-00000056"/> "O        EDITH ALLEN  OR, "The old Colonel is very much in' his dotage, is he not?"' "Oh, yes-you may say, completely so." "And what is Letare worth?"  "No one knows," replied Mr. Brandt. "He is generally  supposed to be very wealthy. Every one thinks so; though  he has himself, for several years past, declared that he is very hard run."                         : C He declares that he has spent the prime of his life work-  ing for Blundell," said the Doctor.  "And Blundell," asked Mr. Fitzgerald, "what does he say?" "Oh, Blundell says, that Letar is well enough, in his way; but a keen-sighted man to his own interest, and rather close." "His daughter will probably be quite wealthy, some day or other, I suppose?" Yes-perhaps so-if she outlives him. But miserly men are usually long lived. By the way, Brandt, Letar is grow- ing so close that he stints his servants dreadfully. Our old friend Ned-Ned Buckletree, as he calls himself-you remem- ber-" "Oh, very well." "Well, he has been trying to persuade me to purchase his wife and children. He says that he relies on you, or me, to do this; that he knows Letar will sell them soon-if he does not first starve them to death. And yourself, Ned?-I asked him-for if it was yourself, whom you wished me to buy, I do not know what I might be led to do for old-times' sake. 'Ah, doctor,' he replied, 'I'll come, after a while, may be; but I'll stand it as long as I can. When I can do no more, I'll apply to you, or Marce Brandt one. But these tothers didn't know marster when he was young, and can't be expected to have the same affection for him.' We promised Ned, you'll remember, a great while ago, that you, or I, would buy him, if  he was to be sold; and it seems that he considers the promise  still binding; and to apply, not only to .himself, but to his wife and children also. He says, that his wife is as fine a woman, for a colored woman, as ever was; and I know myself, that as xi   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     1" a nurse, she is second only to Ned himself. I couldn't help promising the faithful fellow at last, that, if I could make out the money, I would try to purchase them. He told a piteous tale, of Letare's closeness in the matter of food and clothes; and declared, that if he had not, by good luck, laid up a little money himself, both he, and his wife, and children, would not only be naked, but would have starved before this." "I doubt if he treats his daughter, or himself, much bet- ter," said Mr. Brandt. "I asked Ned of this; but his family pride became alarmed. He said, that he had mentioned such matters to me as were necessary, and he was obliged to tell, in connection with the request he had to make of me; but intimated that he had been better' raised than to tell tales out of the family. But he could not help saying, that he pitied his young mistress, there by herself, as she is. He had been sent to my house, with a note from Edith to my daughter, promising us a long expected visit." In his younger days, Mr. Fitzgerald had fallen heir to one or more chancery suits. He was a claimant, too, to some pro- perty in remainder, the life-estate in which had recently ex- pired. In attending to these business affairs, which were placed in Mr. Brandt's hands, he had been now, for sometime with the old lawyer, whom he highly respected, and who was quite fond of him. It was while here, that he had become acquainted with the troubles of Clement Allen and Edith Le- tare; and had kindly thought to aid them by the proposal which he had made to her father. He had been for many years a widower; though it was now whispered among his familiar friends, that he was soon to be married a second time. Mr. Fitzgerald met with Edith a few days after the receipt of her father's note in reply to his proposal. Edith knew nothing of this friendly effort, on his part, in behalf of her lover and herself; but he was very attentive to her; he ap- peared to wish to please her; and he did please her. There were many reasons why he should be an interesting personage in her eyes. But she thought him very friendly, pleasant and  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7321-00000057"/> L12        EDITH ALLEN; OR,  agreeable, apart from all adventitious circumstances. Every hing about him-dress, language, action-proclaimed him a gentleman. And his sympathizing glances, and his friendly %ddress, made Edith feel sure that he was a. very kind one. He appeared to be no less pleased with her. Though, in truth, she was much more beautiful, yet to him she seemed an almost exact picture of what her mother had been, when he irst knew her. His feelings, while looking on her, were like re-awakened echoes of some old heart-known melody. The past, through the misty years, mellowed and- softened by their haze, rose dimly before him. Of course, he felt kindly to- wards Edith, and spoke kindly to her. She had, all her life, known, and rather liked, Ellie Clai- ?  borne; though circumstances had prevented anything like intimacy between them. Miss Henshaw, or "Little Susie Henshaw,"' as she was commonly called, she had never seen until within the last two years. These two girls were as dif- ferent in their characters, as in their persons. -Elhe was a tall, graceful4 and very fair girl, somewhat stately in demeanor --queenly, the beaux said. Susie was a little, black-eyed bru- nette, full of life and mischief, scarcely less admired than her more dignified cousin. Edith found them both full of kind- ness, and very attentive to her; and, after spending a week with them, could not well have said which of the two she liked most--Ellie's gentle, but dignified companionship, or little Susie's assumed, but continually forgotten, demureness. She had intended to have remained much longer with them; but Mrs. Blundell became unwell, and sent for her. She left them very much to their regret, promising, however, to return  as soon as she could.                    A "Tell that good old lady to make haste and get well, and send you back to us," said Susie. "The Bentleys are coming  here soon, and you'll see another phase of this stately young lady's character," nodding towards Ellie Claiborne. "Look! The lily is changing to the scarlet peony,' simply at the men- tion of them. What their presence will do, I leave you to guess. But you will like thern, I know-all but cousin Henry,   ,L-tV1iJVUL Us ,JXi JIN VRtGINIA.  113 who is, between us-though I almost fear to say it, in this presence,"--nodding again--"only a tame, milk and water sort of a character." "I have a cousin, too, whom you may some day meet," Ellie began. ' Shoo!-oo!-oo!" interrupted Susie, shaking her hands over her ears--"Don't mention that tiresome boy! They try their best to tease me, Edith, dear, and I would not mind it a bit- -but that Willie Davidson! However, he is Ellie's cousin, and I forbear. But you must come back soon as ever you can, like a good girl. I know Mrs. Blundell is not much unwell; for I asked the servant myself; and he only said, that she was complaining. Edith found the good old lady " complaining" no little. She had observed Edith's tender and affectionate nursing of her mother; and conceived a fancy to have her now with her. For some days nothing could please her which was not done, at least, by Edith's direction. She would take her medicine and food unwillingly from any other hand than hers. It gave Edith, who was much attached to the good old lady, pleasure to be able to gratify her whims and fancies. She soon began to recover, however; and Edith, in a short time, hearing that her father was again absent from home, returned to Doctor Claiborne's.  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7321-00000058"/> "4        EDITH ALLEN; Olt,  THE Bentleys had just arrived here--that is to say, Miss Helen and Miss Lucy Bentley, cousins of Miss Henshaw, and relatives of Mrs. Claiborne. Mr. Henry, their brother, had been unable to accompany them, although they had waited several days for him-being detained by business. Susie de- clared, that Ellie Claiborne was quite dejected, insisting, con- stantly, that she seemed pale and thoughtful; thereby causing Ellie, who knew to what she alluded, to blush in spite of her- self. Susie was frequently humming at her, too, very signifi- cantly, the refrain of an old lullaby: "' Hush, my darling, don't- you cry, Your sweet-heart will come by-and-by." Though the allusion was evidently 'to her brother, yet Lucy Bentley was constrained, very often, to join in the laugh against E!lie. She was a gay, lively young lady; rather more so than her sister, Miss Helen. They were wealthy, and, very much admired:' both cordial in their manners,- with- out pretension, and Edith was soon very well pleased with them. She had not seen Clement Allen for some time. She had heard from him, however, while at Mr. Blundell's, and knew that he had gone to Richmond in company with Mr, Fitzgerald, who had promised him whatever interest he could command in his efforts to get into business. It was not long before Susie Henshaw began to tease her, too. "What- are you thinking of, off here by yourself, dear?"   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      115 she asked of Edith, who had some time before left the sitting- room, where were several visitors, young gentlemen of the neighborhood. "'Oh, nothing, much," answered Edith, awaking from a reverie. "Well, then, while I am gone to the pantry, where aunt has sent'-me, study out this conundrum :-How can you, by the alteration of a letter, convert a foreigner into a very dear friend?" and off she ran. When she presently returned-"Well," she asked, 1" have you made it out?" "Not I, indeed; I am but a poor hand at unravelling riddles."  "Well, I will enlighten you at once. Take a foreigner, and, as we wish to make a friend of him, let us conceive him, of course, to be a mild, amiable Allen. Now, by altering a little letter, cannot you convert him into a very dear friend?" and away she went, laughing. The constant succession of gay and cheerful company here, was sometimes a little ungrateful to Edith's feelings-sad and subdued since her mother's death. In disposition, however, she was naturally sociable and happy; and upon coming here, at first, she had resolved that her sorrows should be kept to herself, and not be permitted to check or restrain the joyous- ness of others. It was, doubtless, very well for her to have such pleasant and cheerful company. Whenever she felt peculiarly sad, she would retire to her chamber. Here she was, for the most part, free from interruption. Susie Henshaw, how- ever, who, after the coming of the Misses Bentley, had " ad- dicted herself," to use her own expression, "particularly to Edith," and who was determined to draw her out from   her griefs, as much as possible, and conceived that the surest way to do so was not to permit their indulgence, would follow her thither. As an expedient to shield herself from her kind in- trusion-and it was kind, both in intention and manner, for Susie Henshaw was, herself, an orphan girl-Edith would be- take herself to her Bible. When she did so, Susie would on no account interrupt her.   &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7321-00000059"/> 16        EDITH ATLJLEN; OK,  We used almost too strong an expression, when we spoke of Edith as seeking to shield herself from Miss Henshaw; for she quickly grew very fond of Susie. There was some- thing interesting in the society of this young lady. She was, as we have said, an orphan herself; but her sorrows were far away in the back-ground. All in front was brightness, and playfulness, and life. Her very sighs were not sad; and her most serious look might aptly be likened to the shadow of a fleeting cloud passing over a landscape. Nor was her liveli- ness the mere gaiety of a school-girl-trifling, tiresome and annoying to the more seriously disposed. Not the incessant prattling of the streamlet-wearisome, however bright. It was rather like the surface-brightness of deep waters, and one was all the while wondering what pearls and other precious things might lie beneath. And, indeed, Miss Susie was not now a mere girl. The bud was bursting into flower, and was shedding an atmosphere of sweetness all around. She was no elfin sprite, with pale face, dark, tangled- hair, and dreamy black eyes. No; she was as plump and rosy as a peach, and quite careful, withal, of her person, having perfect knowledge of the fact that Miss Henshaw was an uncommonly lovely little body. "Guess who done come, Miss Susie!" said a servant girl, entering the room, to which Miss Henshaw had, a few min- utes before, followed Edith. Cousin Henry!-is it?" cried she, with animation.  No, marm; 'taint Marce Henry." { Who then?" "Marce Will Davidson," said the-girl. "Pshaw! That boy?" Edith noticed, however, that the young lady started at his name. "Ellie's cousin, is he not?" she asked. "Yes; uncle Claiborne's nephew. A great favorite with him, too; though, for my part, I cannot see why he should be; for, oh, Edith, he's a great, awkward, lubberly fellow, whose hands and feet seem to have been made expressly to be   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      117 in their owner's way; who seats himself upon the side of his chair, and is constantly slipping off and on; who never knows what to say, nor when to say it." Despite of all this, however, Edith found Mr. Davidson a handsome, well-dressed, gentlemanly-seeming young man. Clement Allen called on her this evening, accompanied by his young cousin, Edward Stacey. And we may here mention that Edith liked Mr. Davidson still better, when she found that he and Clement had been college mates, and close friends. There was a happy cheerfulness in Mr. Allen's countenance, which made Edithaugur, at first sight, that he had been suc- cessful in his late visit; or, at least, that there was something of good news which he had to communicate. Before all these strangers-and there were a number of young gentlemen pres- ent, as was almost constantly the case since the Misses Bent- ley's arrival-Edith felt considerably confused in his presence; and it was but little private conversation that he enjoyed with her. He found an opportunity to tell her, however, that a situation was promised him, with the likelihood of a salary which would-justify him in thinking of pressing, soon, a dear claim. This likelihood, he said, was almost a certainty; for he had Mr. Fitgserald's very warm recommendation, which went, at once, a great way; and he would certainly exert him- self to his very utmost, when he thought of what success might now be worth to him.   "A thousand dollars is prom- ised me, provided it is found, upon trial, that I shall be able to please; and I doubt it not at all. This, with what little I have--and it is little enough, truly--will enable us to make a start, and we will b%  dearest, the happiest pair in' all the "Hush!    some one will hear you -" and, indeed, there was one of those awful pauses which sometimes occur in mixed company; and Clement seemed to have entirely forgotten that there were a number of other persons present in the room.

This is, however, mere matter of hearsay. Man is said to be less careful on such occasions; and to think only on the dear  creature beside him.  Edith, by way of covering. the exclusiveness of this little  tAte-h-tAte, addressed some remark to Susie; who was not far from them, begging young Stacey to sing for her; and imme-  diately afterwards, they were joined by Willie Davidson, who had been for some time vainly endeavoring to attract the per- verse Miss Henshaw into a connected conversation with him. That young lady would reply to him when he directly addressed a remark to her; though she shewed a carelessness even about this, as it appeared to him, and would turn again, at once, to Ned Stacey.  He was a boy of twelve or thirteen years of  age; a good-natured, good-humored lad, who had already given indications of that rare talent for which he afterwards became much noted, and which, alas,! poor fellow! led, ultimately, to  his ruin.     "  "My chief object, Miss Susie," he presently said, "in corn- ing over to-day, was to hear some music myself; and you  ; ought not to--"          :  "Oh," she interrupted him, "I had foolishy thought that !- you had come to see us; as you did not," she went on, heed-  less of his attempts at explanation, "and as you are so dis- obliging and as I have some work to do, I will leave you."  And nodding her head in adieu to him, she left the room.  There were at Doctor Claiborne's to-day, several of his  neighbors-sturdy old farmers-who, with their pipes, were  "the adjoining, or what was called for distinction sake, "the sitting room." Susie turned in here for a moment; but politics i and farming operations being the burden of their discourse, she passed on to "the chamber," a private sitting room, so called, used as a retiring room for ladies, where their good wives were discussing sundry receipts for dishes, mcdes of rearing poultry, curing hams, preserving butter, and the un- numbered topics of conversation which such old ladies ever   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     119 have ready at hand; about which we have a thousand times wondered how they find so much to say. Here, with a little bit of stitch-work of some sort, which, in its turn, gave rise to remarks without number, being particularly examined and commented on by each one present, Susie sat, seemingly highly entertained by their chit-chat. "And so, Susie, you leave the young folks?" at length asked a good old lady, turning to her. "Yes, Mrs. Hill; they do talk so much nonsense; and be- aides" she continued, "I can work so much better in bore." We suppose that the work with which she was engaged wfas somethingof very much importance. Be this as it might, she kept at it until the old ladies took their departure, and then ran off up stairs to her own room. She was absentfrom "the parlor," where the "young folks" were, for a time, which Willie Davidson thought dreadfullylong. At length remembering, perhaps, that some attention was due, by this time, to her visitors, she was returning thither, when she met. in the entry, two new comers-young gentlemen, beaux of the Misses Bentley. She greeted them gayly, with some jesting allusion to these young ladies, as she invited them in. "Shall be pleased,. of course, to see any of your friends; but we wish you to understand, Miss Susie, that our visit is paid expressly to yourself," replied one. Oh, thank you, Mr. Ilopewell, thank you! you make me rroud, indeed; so much so, that 1 shall not fail to let Helen and Lucy now that you have no claimon their presence this evening; that your visit is to me.

Two other young gentle- men were with Lucy, looking over Mrs. Wirt's Floral Dic- tionary, then very popular. Clement Allen and Edith were  Li entertaining each other, 'not far from the piano, at which was Ellie, playing waltzes and marches, one after another, to tile exquisite deligoht of young Stacey, who, songster as he was himself, invariably aslked for, and seemed much to prefers, music of this character; while Willie Davidson was leaning  over the instrument by her, listlessly turning, piece by piece,  a heap of loose music lying there.

Susie attached herself particularly to Mr.  Hopewell, not far from whcre Edith and Clement Allen were seated. Her presence awaked Willie Davidson t a senseof of embarrassment.

When he had listened for awhile to these, he turned to where Susie and Hopewell had been chatting away in high glee, ith much fun afloat between them. As there was a momentary pause in their talk, he approached them. A remark of a general cha racter was on his tongue's end, when Susie naughty Susie as if purposely, turned her back, and spoke to Hopewell. Willie Davidson was a youth of nice feelings; moreover he was  devoted lover, and where Susie was concerned, those feelings were as sensitive as the delicate gold leaf of the electrometer. keen pang shot through his heart; a deadly paleness, for a  second's time; pervaded his features.

It was long before he returned. -When he did so, he found that the only young gentlemein now present were Alston, Edgar, and Hopewell; the others, whose names were unmentioned, as well as Clement Allen and Edward Stacey, were gone. Old Doctor Claiborn e and his wife were now both present.. Susie, herself, had gone out. But she soon returned: "See!" 'she exclaimed, " what beauties I have gathered, though it is as dark as pitch in the conservatory;" and she held up to view three rose-buds. "Mr. Alston,' she said, "for your learned lecture on floral language," (they had, in Davidson's absence, been overhauling Mrs. Wirt's Dictionary, and Alston had broken out into quite an enthusiastic strain, while speaking of what he called "the poetry of vegetation,") "Mr. Alston, for your learned lecture, I feel bound to award you the choice. This one is, I think, the prettiest," presenting to him a very sweet, half-blown bgU:. '"They are all of the same kind, perpetuals; we have none others in bloom, just now." "It is, indeed, very beautiful," said Alston, bowing; '"and is, permit me to say, an apt emblem of the giver, who reminds one constantly of just such a bud." "Oh, I have not come compliment-hunting, I assure you. And now, gentlemen, one for each of you two," looking to Hopewell and Edgar, "provided-having been scared by Mr. Alston, I must say-provided you each receive it in grateful silence," as she handed them the buds, one to each. "Bound to silence, we may think only the more," said Hopewell, bending over the flower. "Oh, certainly, I cannot forbid your thinking." "Then, I think," Edgar started to say hastily- "Oh, no, not aloud." "I am mute on the subject. But the loss is yours; for, it strikes me that I was going to say something very good." "wVell, do let us hear it, for once," said Mi;s Helen, play- fully.

"It is the doom of the gifted, sir, to be unappreciated, you know; and the doom of another, an infatuated class, to con- ceive themselves gifted, and you-" "A complimentary remark," said he, interrupting her, "for which I thank you kindly. In fact, it almost, if not fully, atones for that unfortunate expression 'for once.'" ' Why, Sue," interrupted the old doctor, "you are, partial in your favors; you have slighted Willie." "'Oh, Mr. Davidson was out when I went for them," she replied coldly. Another heart-pang! poor Willie! So much for yielding your love to such a little ingrate as Susie Henshaw! The parlor and sitting room were connected by folding doors. These had been left partially open. Edith was sitting in the far end of the latter room, watching the stars through the window, and thinking of very many things. The company had gone, and time had slipped by much more rapidly than she had suspected. She heard Doctor Claiborne say: "Good night, Willie; I'll send a servant to show you the way to your quarters," and was just coming forward toward the light, when Susie came tripping and blushing back into the parlor: "My basket," she said; "I left my basket." Edith was still advancing, when she went on-(Willie having told her that her basket was not there)-"I meant to have rewarded you, had you found it. As it is, I will do so, for your wil- lingness to find it for me;" and Susie took from her own bosom, where she had worn it, a rose-geranium leaf, and quickly pinned it on his breast. "'And now, good night!" she said, bounding off, as a servant entered to light him to his bed-room. Edith was highly amused at this little scene, and felt very   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     123 much disposed to tease Susie about her search for her basket; but concluded that, perhaps, she had better not do so; for she was kindly interested in the success of Mr. Davidson-the more, perhaps, on account of his friendship to Clemnent Allen; and she was loth to do anything which might, by possibility, marl or at all impede it. So she kept silent as to what she had witnessed. When alone with her, however, in their room, she could not avoid giving her a little rally. "Susie," she said, "I have a conundrum for you, this time." Miss Henshaw  started. "A conundrum! Well, what is it?" f"n what will you, some day or other, resemble the wisest of men?" Miss Henshaw puzzled herself for a moment with the ques- tion, blushed confusedly, and made some inquiry of the ser- vant girl relative to the night. "I am glad that it is a bright, pretty night," she said, "for the sake of those silly boys, who would go. They were per- verse not to stay. It were a pity however, if any harm befell them, for Helen's and Lucy's sake." On the next morning, Edith was amused at Mr. Willie's happy-looking face. He wore on his breast the little geranium leaf. Ellie noticed it. "Why, cousin Willie! I thought to have gathered a boquet for you this morning, myself; but I see that you are already favored with a floral token-an emblematic one, too. How comes it?" :'Ah, poor bachelors were badly off, indeed, could we devise no means, when ladies slight us, to shew our independence." And do you mean to say-poor fellow!-that you had to gather it yourself?" "Nay, now, cousin Ellie, you should not press one too closely, who is evidently striving to put the best appearance he can on the face of circumstances." "You see, Susie, your beau is growing independent," said Lucy Bentley, in a half whisper, when Dr. Claiborne had  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7321-00000063"/> hailed-Willie to the other end of the room, to find for him some place on a'map which he was examining. "Ugh !"--(making a mouth)--" He might wear a whole botanical garden, for what I care !" replied Miss Henshaw, with a sneer. Edith was highly amused. Clement Allen came over frequently, during his brief stay in the neighborhood. Young Stacey once again accompanied him; and this time, by dint of ninch persuasion, and chiefly by refusing to play for him unless he did, he was induced to sing for them. " If you will accompany me ?" he said to Ellie. "Yes, in this first one. Here is an old song, which I taught you myself. I know we could once sing it together." And she did commence with him; no more than this; for she afterwards only struck a low accompaniment on the piano. I thought of a gay and gallant ride, Adown a glittering stream, Where pleasure's bark might carelessly glide-- But brief was the silly dream.  , I thought of a friendship, warm and pure , As the sun's unsullied beam; As patience firm-and as virtue sure-- But friendship proved a dream. And I dreamed-oh,' I dreamed of woman's faith-  A chosen, darling theme; But was wakened to find it a passing breath-- - The shadow of a dream!  Oh, what is pleasure-friendship-love? Each idle, and light, I deem, As the floating mist, which winds remove-- A false and fleeting dream. Yet they come to all, and ever bring, So truthful do they seem, A hope that they are not perishing; But, ah! this hope's a dream!   After having broken through his bashfulness, the boy sang for them a number of old Scotch  ongs--(they were his favor- ites)-with a touching pathos. Lucy Bentley declared, after- wards, that, "while he was singing 'Wandering Willie,' it was as much as she could do to restrain herself from jumping up and kissing him." And while he sang "Logie o' Bu- chan," Edith owned to weeping. The effect produced by his singing, and the praise which was ever elicited, was, doubt- less, very flattering, and with as little doubt, we say, very injurious to him. Indeed, we cannot but think, that musical talent of a high order is, for many reasons, not to be desired. It usually proves anything but a blessing, to the possessor. This reflection is particularly impressed upon us in Connection with poor, Ned Stacey. He who could sing with such effect, and who was, besides, an exceedingly companionable lad, had a thousand temptations forced upon hin, from which an ordi- nary boy might have escaped unassailed.  Poor fellow! when we knew him; , The Cruiskeen Lawn" was his favorite song; for he had early caught "the infection of bar-rooms and mint juleps." Willie Davidson did not apparently make much progress with Miss Susie. She continued coy and cold; and no one from merely seeing them together, could have thought other- wise than that she" entertained decided dislike  and aversion for the young gentleman. She was certainly quite sharp in her remarks about him-usually   designating him as "That tiresome  boy !" or,    ironically, as o"The interesting  young gentleman!" Edith, who had her suspicions aroused could not but be somewhat curious about Miss   Ienshaw's love affairs.  Yet although this young lady was often particularly cruel to Willie during the day, and' though he was, consequently, frequently looking especially downcast and low-hearted, Edith never dis- covered that Susie ever again ran back for her " basket," or on any other pretence or that the young gentleman received again any particular favor to cheer him, or repay the constant, daily vexation, which his cruel ladylove caused him.   fatters   &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7321-00000064"/> continued thus, or, indeed, rather seemed to grow worse, as his visit drew near to a close; for Susie appeared more and more to avoid intercourse with him. On the day preceding that one on which he had announced that he must leave them, Edith took Susie to task, as they say. "You know, Susie, that Mr. Davidson leaves to-morrow. Now, dear, you should relent to-day, for once, and behave to him with courtesy and civility, if you cannot with real kindness." ' You think so, do you?  Well, for my part, I cannot con- ceive why he should have tarried so long." "Give him an opportunity, and perhaps he will tell you." " Oh, bless you, now !-I feel no interest in the matter- none whatever. He may stay, or go, just as it suits him, for me." Edith said no more on the subject.   She presently, how- ever, remarked: "It is a lovely day! Suppose you and I"- (the (ther young ladies were busy)--"Suppose you and I take a good long stroll over the hills?" "Agreed !" cried Susie; " with all my heart." As they were passing out, Edith called to Willie: e Mr. Davidson ! we are going to take a walk; will you not accom- pany us ?" " Now; Edith !-I do declare-that is'too bad !" muttered Susie, as Willie joined them with an alacrity which showed, plainly enough, that he came  with all his heart." During their advance, Edith sought to give the willing lover an opportunity to improve his suit with his coy mis- tress; but the perverse Susie had no notion'of permitting this. When Edith would stop to examine a little flower, or in pretended admiration of the view, Susie did the like, and would not advance a step farther until she came on. Susie had laid aside, however, as Edith had before observed that she was apt to do when only she was present with them, the peculiar tartness of reply and coldness of manner toward Mr. Davidson, which she usually thought proper to assume in the presence of others; and if she was not really kind, yet she was good-humored, mischievous, and playful.    ISuddenly, a horseman Was seen coming towards them. Be- fore Edith had distinctly recognized him, Susie exclaimed: "Aha !--Mr. Allen !--It is all explained now, dear ! A ren- dezvous-a tryste! Mr. Davidson, we have been made use of by this cunning damsel} to cover a tryste ! Now, sir, shall we lend our countenance to such proceedings ? Tell us, Edith, dear, what part Mr. Allen has had in this arrangement--this meeting ?--that we may know how to regulate our behavior. You cannot have the assurance to say that it is purely acci- "Yes indeed, but I do," said Edith, with some confusion as Mr. Allen came up to them with a countenance beaming with delight. "Quite an unexpected pleasure--Fortune is propitious," he said, alighting from his horse, and seeking where he might fasten him. Willie saw    a servant boy at some distance.   He was called, and the animal delivered into his care. Had we not better return, Edith ?" asked usie. "Oh no, Miss Susie!  Not for my coming, I trust ?" ex- claimed Allen. "This is too lovely a day to pass indoors; and I was just congratulating myself upon having met you And they walked   on, altogether at first; but by degrees a little space was allowed to intervene, which, as they advanced, gradually increased; and if Mr. Davidson did not improve the opportunity thus offered, to say anything which he might wish, thefultas hison. Once, or twice, when Edith glanced back, she fancied that Susie's face was rather more flushed than the slow pace at which they were progressing would war- rant. But this might be mere fancy, Or the distance between them might deceive her. She observed, however, that there was a constant conversation kept up between the two, chiefly on Willie's part. On their return, as they very naturally drew    together on approaching the house, after an  hour or rmore-although they had not gone far--she could not bu t smile to notice that Susie sided off from D avidson and   joined her. When Edith and Susie had reached their own  room ,   &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7321-00000065"/> 128        EDITH AT TLEN; ORK whither they immediately betook themselves, the latter cried out: "Oh, Edith, girl, you have no idea how much you are in- debted to me-how much I have endured this morning, for your sake. Oh, that wearisome man! I shall not recover myself for a whole fortnight." Edith turned to her suddenly, and taking both hands in hers said: Tell me now, darling, is he not a handsome, no- ble fellow? And did you not promise to love him in return?" Susie was taken so by surprise that she could not say a word. She colored to the very roots of her hair, and, loosing her, hands, threw her arms around Edith's neck, and kissing her, hid her blushing face in her bosom. "You will not tell any one, dear Edith, will you?" "Not I, indeed, love." "Not even Mr. Allen-will you? Oh, Edith, you must not tell him." "I give you my word that I will not. But I suspect that Mr. Davidson will probably give his friend some hint of his happiness." "If he does!-Oh me!-why did I not think to charge him?"  "Why, if he does-you silly girl-- iat harm will be done? C4ement Allen, you may rest assured,will keep his friend's secret." "Oh! but I did not wish any one to Iknow-not even myself." "As he is going away so soon, I suppose that I must try to be a little more civil to him," said Susie, to Helen and Lucy, that evening, in excuse for rather more kindness of manner toward Mr. Davidson than she had before exhibited. Willie did leave on the next day, with no little reluctance, it may well be believed. And after two days more, Clement Allen, too, departed for Richmond.                  .   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     129 ^ttr     tLn, IN a short time after this, Mr. Henry Bentley arrived, bring- ing with him a young relative, Mr. Alfred Dier, a Georgian, who was paying a visit to his friends in this State, and who intended accompanying the Bentleys upon a Northern tour, which they had in contemplation. Mr. Dier was a gay, lively, laughing young gentleman a great favorite with his cousins Helen and Lucy, with whom he had become intimately ac- quainted several years before, when he had been a student at the University of Virginia. Mr. Henry was more stately, and Susie had been only seeking to tease Ellie, when she had des- ignated him as ' a we, milk-and-water sort of character;" for Susie really had," high regard for her cousin Henry. Hie had, at an ear :e, devoted himself to politics; and. though too young to  rve there had several years previously been "?thrown  ' upon him quite a large vote, in the last Congressional  on in his own county, where neither of the regular candid  for the district had been very popular. Having fallen very much in love with Ellie Claiborne, how- ever, and discovering that his political aspirations presented an insuperable baroier to his hopes, not only with her family, but with Ellie herself, he at once abandoned them. His own family had been highly gratified at this, and his father had sent his express thanks to Ellie, for her kindly influence. Mr. Henry Bentley was now, as rapidly as he could, retiring from the practice of law, upo6r which he had entered merely as a stepping )stone to political advancement. Being very wealthy, he coild afford to follow his own inclinations in with-  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7321-00000066"/> Irawing from a profession for which he had no partiality; and the life now before him was that of a gentleman farmer. From what has been said, it will be readily conceived, that he was Ellie Claiborne's accepted lover. Edithhad learned all this from Susie, long before his arrival; and she had suspected   the Northern tour sometimes spoken of by the Bentleys, had some connection with Mr. Henry's union with the fair Ellie. Miss Claiboine's management of her love affairs was very different from Miss Henshaw's. She received her lover very   courteously, with some blushing it is true, and very kindly-  appeared to be fond of his society, and listened with defer- ence to whatever he said. From the very first, the young southerner appeared to be very much pleased with Edith. He so frequently expressed his regret that so fine and beautiful a girl should be engaged, that his cousins were soon laughing at him about his partiality : for her. That partiality assumed an air of almost brotherly tenderness, when he became acquainted with all the circum-   i stances connected with her. Nor was Mr, Bentley less kind; and Edith was enjoying herself in. their friendly attentions and efforts to render her happy, as  ch as was possible. We do not say distinctly, that Mr.   fell in love" with Edith. That young gentleman w     habit ofdeclaring, that he liked all the sex too well to lowe ny one individually. But he was known to lament, as a pity, t t that the only girl, whom he could have loved, was' bled to another before he chanced to meet with her. This  said in a jocu- lar, light way to his cousin Lucy, while she as teasing him about Edith, and, of course, meant nothing.. A new phase seemed to have presentdL itself in Susie's character. She had become quite thoughtful, and betook herself, very industriously, to needle:work, with which she was-engaged from morning until nighti-vowing "that she had no time for fun; that she was tired of teasing Ellie and l cousin Henry. There was no amusement in it. They didn't care a fig for it-either of them. In short, that she was busy." Mr. Dier would sometimes draw her out; and as he   wasa full match for her, in persiflage, they would now and then have some very spirited passages.     One w  ould have thought that he would probably have been taken with her; from some similarity in their dispositions; but he was usually to be found at Edith's side. Susie said, that MIr. Allen had better look to his elaims, as there wa a dire rival in the field. Edith knew that he was aware of her betrothal to another; so she made herself very affable and friendly with him; and, as was intimated, the time was passing as happily as she could hope for. A letter came one morning, fromn Clement Allen. Susie brought  it in to her: "I took it from the servant at the door, and let no one else see it, dear; for it has the Richmond post-mark; and I though    to spare you Uncle Claibornes knowing looks, and any number of innocent blushes.      The letter ran: -   "               Of   nocent blushes.

JI leavb it to your own good judgment, however, whether circumstances do not justify me in pressing upon you this hasty union. But I defer all this until next week; and only beg now, that you will not make any too strong resolves against my wishes in this matter, before I can see you. ,With the tenderest and most inexpressible affection, "CLEMENT ALLEN." It will be readily conceived that this letter surprised Edith no little.              : -  "(Oh, dear, no--she couldn't think of being married so soon." And her first impulse was, to write to Mr. Allen and tell him so; and forbid his coming. Her'perturbation was plainly discernible, and Susie, who, having kindly given her a good long time to read her letter by herself, had now come back to her, was at once struck with her troubled look. Ready to give her sympathy, whatever might disturb her friend, she knelt down by Edith, and, by little after little,drew out from her the facts of the case. "Pshaw! said she; "you will write no such thing! When people are determined to be married--and I suppose that you intend to marry Clem.

And what is the use of troubling him, and having a great turmoil,    G.... v lnulala.    133 when you will be sure to consent, finally, and be sorry for it all?

"But you love him a great deal." "Why, bless my life! I thought you were in a sea of troubles; and here you are teasing me!" "Oh! and I am in trouble, Susie! What shall I do?"

I have not at all collected my thoughts yet. I would not know how to speak to him- what to say."   i "I'll tell you. Place one finger between your teeth--so- and say-if you whimper a little, it will do no harm-say: 'Dr. Claiborne, Clem. Allen wishes to marry me, and I wish to marry Clem. Allen. But he wishes to marry me week after next, and I wish to gratify him; yet, at the same time, I do not wish to seem in any haste about the matter.' Now, is not that just the amount of what you will tell him; and pretty much after the manner, too, though you should first take ever so long a time to collect your thoughts?" While they were yet talking, the maid-servant entered, and informed Edith that Dr. Claiborne desired to see her, if she pleased, in the chamber. "There, now!" exclaimed Susie; " you see the silly boy has forestalled us!" Edith obeyed this summons with a good deal of nervous agitation. She knew that there had existed a sort of confi- dence between the old doctor and her lover,- and, like Susie, she had at once concluded that Mr. Allen had written to his old friend, and that it-was in connection with him that Dr. Claiborne wished now to speak to her. But she was mistaken in this. It was on an entirely different subject that he thought proper to communicate with her. In as delicate a manner as he could, and with a long preparatory introduction -the longer on account of his having observed her unwonted excitement-he informed her, that he had purchased, from her father, Theresa, the wife of our old friend, Ned, and her two children, Zelia and young Ned. It shocked Edith's feel- ings-the knowledge that these friends should pass from the family, even to Dr. Claiborne. Very dear friends they were! Tea, her mother's maid, and, for a long time, her own nurse; Zelia, her play-mate and maid, and Edward, Uncle Ned's son, and Tea's, to say no more about him. Yes, they were very dear friends! Oh, her father! How could he part with them! She had often heard Theresa speak of- being sold.   SKETCIIES OP'LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     135 She had often heard her complaints of the hard fare which she, and all, endured; of want of clothes, and other comforts. It becomes us here, for Edith's sakl, to tell that she had endeavored, as far as she was able, to relove these hardships, which her father's miserable parsimony imposed upon his ser- vants. She was determined that these should no longer con- tinue, when she found that the money--a yearly allowance-- which had been fortunately reserved by Dr. Claiborne to her mother, was her own. Her father, by the way, had disputed this point that is, while he admitted her right, demanded, nevertheless, that this sum should be paid over into his hands, as her natural and lawful guardian; and had almost grown angry with Dr. Claiborne, when he positively refused to yield to him in this, referring him to the express terms of the con- tract by which this annuity was reserved. We presume that the doctor was in the right in this, as Letare at length sul- lenly yielded the point. Edith however, knew not a word of all this. To return. She had never, for a moment, thought that there was, really,- a probability that Tea and her children would be sold; and the fact that they were, took her wholly by suprirse. Upon a little reflection, however, though very sorry, on her own account, to part with them, she was rejoiced, for their sake that they had fallen into the hands of so good a master. "I knew," he aid to her, "that it would distress you, dear Edith, to hear that they are sold; yet I felt it my duty to tell you of it; as also to promise you, that they shall be well and kindly (cared for. There is a friendship of long standing between Ned and myself; and it was through his interference that I was led to purchase them.

You mentioned Mr. Allen, sir-" "Well, dear, what would you say of him?"-seeing her pause hesitatingly.  "I have just received a letter from him, sir; and when you sent for me was purposing to consult you-as to--as to a request which he makes-some proposals of his--that is, some arrangements, which he has proposed. I beg your opin- ion and advice." "Well, my dear, I will advise you as well as I know how-- as readily, and as sincerely, as if you were my own child, Edith." "I had best give you his letter to read; for, sir, I find some difficulty in expressing myself." And she handed the letter to him, having brought it with her. When he had perused it, he said: "The question rests alone with you, dear Edith, as to what you are to do. For my part, I own,that, perhaps, I had some influence in inducing 'Mr. Fitzgerald to give the advice to which Clement refers. Let me speak plainly to you, my dear girl. If I mention what is unpleasant, you know that I do so in kindness, and with no other design- than to give you my best, most friendly advice.

You have, you know, your beloved mother's sanction. So, as I said, the question rests with you. My advice to you, dear Edith, is to consult your own heart. If you love Clement well enough to marry him, I think you had better do so at once. If you do not love him; of course there is an end to the whole matter."        i "My chief difficulty, sir, is the very short time which he has allowed me--the early day he has named." "Psha! psha! Just conceive that it was fixed on a year ago; and it will be the same-just as well, as if it had been." Edith had not been long returned to her room when, to her surprise, Theresa, followed by Zelia, entered. "Why, Tea!-you here already?-Doctor Claiborne did not tell me that you had come." "He say I mout come in to see you now, marm; for he had done told you all about his buying on us." 1 I' Yes, he did; and while I am very sorry to part with you, yet I am much pleased that you ]ave so good a home as he I  gives you."

Theresa had ever looked upon Edith rather as her own nurs- ling than otherwise; and had never exercised any restraint upon her volubility in her presence; beings in the habit of speaking to her, and before her) with nearly, the same freedom  .^^^^^^^^^^   SKETCHES  OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.    139 as when addressing persons of her own class and color. But we would do her injustice were we, by this remark, or other- wise, to create the impression, that she was at all forward, or impertinent, in her general behavior. It had been her tender nursing of Edith's mother, and her proper, respectful deport- ment generally, which, joined to the fact, that she was Ned Buckletree's wife, had first attracted Doctor Claiborne's atten- tion to her, and won his liking. She had regarded Edith's mother as being unquestionably, and incomparably, the first and best lady in the land. She had been-besides the fact, that she was a Transmere--her own   young mistress, whose dresses, and other finery, she had worn, second hand, in her own budding days; whose manners she had taken much pains to imitate, and whose language she had endeavored to catch; though she had long ago, now, laid aside all such idle preten- sions. But in Edith, though she everoshewed a careful regard for her wishes, she felt a sort of property of another kind. And as her young lady grew up under her eye, she had never sought, or thought, at all, to curb the freedom with which she had treated her as a child. But withDthis, we pass all such remarks by, which might arise, having bestowed quite enough attention upon Mrs. Buckletree and hers.  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7321-00000071"/> "O       EDITH ALLEN ; OR, &amp;g^ter Uleren, Es have often been-led to wonder, when it has happened, that any of our young lady friends have thought fit to give themselves away in marriage, how upon earth they iad con- trived to get along beforehand; there is always so much fixing and preparation now found to be necessary. For ourpart,we never could discover why a married lady, should need so many more clothes than a single one. But as far as our observation and information extends, this preparation seems to be invaria- bly thought necessary; and it is considered, ever, a sort of infringement upon feminine rights, when some months time, at least, has not been allowed them to prepare; and this, too: even with those, who, to appearances, have, for years pre viously, been thinking of little else than of getting married The most we can make of the fashion is, that it affords a pla) sible, and an accepted excuse, for getting a good deal of wor doneby sympathizing friends; and in many instances, for mal ing one last, heavy draft upon ppa'Spocket. Consequentl; we confess-charging it to our own ignorance of what is pe haps manifest enough to others-that we cannot at all undo stand why it was, that Edith should have made so mnu bother in assenting to her lover's arrangements. Certain it that it was late in the night, as she and Susie were talki the matter over, before she at last agreed that these arran ments were at all practicable, and gave her consent that Su might in the morning inform the other girls of them, commence upon these preparations. Men, women and children, as a general rule, are ever    SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      l ready to lend a helping hand when there is, a wedding in ex- pectancy; and all will admit, that a marriage is a matter of some interest, even when we know little or nothing, person- ally, of the'parties concerned. On the present occasion, Dr. Claiborne at once proposed to give Edith a party, saying that, of course, she would be married at his house; and in this he was seconded by Mrs. Claiborne and the girls. Edith was very thankful, but declined the compliment. She was, she said, still fresh in mourning; and this, and all other cir- cumstances, would render it proper that her wedding should be as private as possible. As to the place, she was under an implied, if not an express promise to accept her aunt Blun- dell's invitation to have the ceremony performed at her house. Besides, Edith thought that Mr. Blundell's was the most pro- per place, having been her mother's own home, and, in some sort, her own. "Well, my dear, Mrs. Claiborne will accompany you to Blankville this evening; or, perhaps, you had better wait until Monday, as there will be plenty of time, and, in the mean-   while, you knowing ones in such matters can be thinking of what you will need." Early on Monday morning, Mr. Brandt sent over a couple of boxes, directed to "Miss Edith Letard, care of A. Sydney Brandt."   "In haste"  was inserted underneath. They had arrived by the night coach from Richmond. The one con- tained a band-box within it, which held, very securely pro- tected from injury by any quantity of snow-white bats, which were dim and yellow, however, to its pure white, a silk bonnet which they enveloped. Of the bonnets worn at this time, the IVless that is said of their shape and fashion the better; for they would be considered "horrors" at the present day. But the white French flowers with which\ Edith's was ornamented, were beautiful and the veil of blonde which accompanied it, so rich, and yet so light and airy, was indescribably exquisite. Ah, those blonde veils were beautiful; and even a plain face looked well shaded by them. And spygking of those bonnets, droll as their shape was, they were thought to be becoming.  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7321-00000072"/> "2         EDITI ALLEN; OR,       l The other box contained, no less carefully put up, a most beau- tiful bridal dress. There was a little billet attached: "Erom S. Fitzgerald:" and, in pencil mark, this addition: "Sent in haste, that there may be time for any alterations which may be necessary.                         j "Oh, what a dear man he is!' cried Susie. "Come, Edith, come! let us see if it fits. What a beautiful dress!-and bon- net!-and oh, what an-ethereal veil!" The bonnet fitted elegantly. It could not have been better, had the milliner had Edith's head to choose it by, and her face before- her while dressing it. The dress needed a little alteration, which the girls, however, agreed might be easily effected. Mr. Fitzgerald had described Edith to the fair widow of his love, of whose kind offices he had 'made use in selecting these presents, as well as he could otherwise have done, by comparing her with herself, in point of complexion and general appearance; and in point of size and form, com- paring Edith with a niece of hers, who was with her. He was sure the height was the same, to within a fraction.. We doubt whether there are many gentlemen who could have done as well; but circumstances had led him to observe Edith very narrowly.' The dress in question was a rich, thick white satin, having the full skirt, falling in graceful folds; the corsage made after the fashion which was called surplice; that is, hav- ing plaits, or rather folds, coming from the shoulder to the waist on each side, leaving room for a richly worked lace che- mnisette in front, and a quilling of thread lace around the top of the dress, and continuing to edge the satin to the waist. A sash of broad satin ribbon, tied in front, the long ends of which hung nearly to the bottom of the skirt. The very full, short sleeves, edged also with a quilting of lace, by their size, enhanced the beauty of Edith's slender waist. Indeed, those old-fashioned large sleeves made quite a stout waist appear small. :-There came along, enclosed in the other articles, a skillfully worked guard of pure white beads, to hang around her fair neck, a dainty pair of white satin slippers, and a pair of long kid gloves. When the busy, highly interested girls   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      143 had dressed Edith, many were the exclamations of admiration which broke from them; in which the expression "rich sim- plicity" was common to almost all. When Dr. Claiborne heard of these presents, he declared that it was a pity that Fitzgerald had thus forestalled him in his design; though, doubtless, he had done much better than he could have beenable to do, off in tle country. The dress was talken to Blankville, and Mrs. Mark, the village mantua- maker, undertook to effect the necessary alterations. As Lucy Bentley and Edith wore precisely the same dresses, a little deceit was practiced on this industrious personage, at Susic's suggestion, lwhich Lucy enjoyed very ipuch at the time, but by which she had the annoyance, if such it was, of having it -reported all over the country side, that she was to be married immediately to Mr. Alfred Dier.   This report was confirmed by the.movements of this gentleman'-all unwittingly, on his part, however. The girls were very private in all their con- sultations and doings; keeping every thing strictly and safely secret, as they thought, from  the young gentlemen; and were as mysterious in their hints and movements, as if very much depended on this.  The gentlemen themselves    exhibited no improper knowledge of what was going on during Monday and Tuesday; but on Wednesday evening, upon their return from a ride, to Edith's great surprise a  couple of little parcels were handed in to her, labeled "A. Dier" and "t.  Bentley," con- taining, the one a pair of jet and gold bracelets, the other, a handkerchief, bordered with open work-a very nice one, by the way. They declared afterwards, that these ar e the most appropriate articles for the occasion which they had been able to procure in the village. Edith felt her delicacy put to . the blush. These were small but costly presents; and she neither knew how to receive, nor decline them. It was while search- iing for these, that Mr. Dier, accompanied, as he was, by Htenry Bentley, had, by his inquiries and remarks, confirmed the report which had been first whispered from M rs. Mark's establishm ent, and, by her "young ladies," spread abroad on the winds, relative to the   unsuspecting young gentleman and &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7321-00000073"/> "        EDITH ALLEN; OR, his fair cousin. This report, when he heard of it, amused him exceedingly. "And so, my fair cousin," he said, 'it appears that I am more fortunate than I had thought. ' I had my suspicions that there was a marriage brewing, but had not dreamed that I was so nearly interested myself." "And what led you and brother to suspect that there was a marriage brewing, as you say?" "What?     Your very attempt to conceal the fact; your wise looks, and evident commotion, let us see, plainly enough, that there was some very exciting subject on the tapis. A- nd I chanced to hear Dr. Claiborne express his regrets that she thought of going off to Mr. Blundell's to be married, remark- ing, t.hat the relationship to the Blundells was only nominal. Now, to whom could he allude, but to Miss Letard ?  This at once laid the whole affair before us; though I may as well own, too, that I fished some further particulars, as to dates, etc., and made the grand discovery that it was a secret to be kept specially from us-from the servant boy." " What! Well, now, just to think of it! Two grown gentlemen, with no better amusement than pumping secrets from a negro boy !" , Nay, Lucy, I utterly deny having had any share in this. .I disclaim  all participation in the pumping scrape," cried Henry Bentley, with a deprecatory air. "You were willing enough to listen, however," said Dier; and for you, Cousin Lucy, I reply: Just to think of a bevy of fair ladies trying to keep two poor fellows, dependant, as we are, upon you for entertainment and amusement, a week behind even the foot-boys in such an interesting piece of news-enjoying their secret with such a relish, too, in the meanwhile !" " 0, what a lame excuse ! But as no great harm is done, we will let it pass "--she was saying, whei Susie, who had met him in the passage, ushered in Mr. Allen. "And so, Clemient, my boy, you have, arrived, have you ? How do you do?" cried Dr. Claiborne, following them in     immediately, while Mr. Allen was introduced to Mr. Dier Henry Bentley he had long known. "I was thinking of stigmatizing you as a tardy lover," the old Doctor continued. "You would certainly not have thought of it, sir, could you have seen my haste to leave the city. The young gentle- man whom I have gotten to supply my place in my absence was not at leisure to do so until yesterday, in the evening, and to-day, sir, I am here."  "Without food or rest ?" "Not much rest, sir, certainly. The coach was crowded for the greater part of the way. Besides, we s ct with an ac- cident. Iwas fortunate enough, owing to my impatience, to get an inside seat, and was trying my best to get asleep- was, indeed, almost dozing-when, suddenly, over we went, with a crash, and everybody was thrown against everybody else, it seemed; and females were  aming, and n strug- gling and cursing in the dark, for some moments, at a fright. ful rate. I, fortunately, escaped uninjured; as also saving some bruises,  did every one, except an intoxicated young man, named Hawk, who was the cause of the accident. He sat with the driver, who, by the way, was not much more sober than himself, and would insist upon taking the reins. By snatching them suddenly-so the driver said-while pass- ing through a dark wood's bottom, the coach was turned upon an embankment, and overset. The horses were, happily, per - fectly gentle, and stopped at once.  The unfortunate young man had his arm broken and his collar-bone dislocated by the fall. With some difficulty, we got under weigh again in an hour or two, and subsequently came on very safely; though, as you may suppose, after such an accident, there was but little hope for sleep." "And what became of the poor young man ?" Susie, we forgot to state, had, upon conducting Mr. Allen in, immediately ran off to inform Edith of his arrival. "We   were not far from -- Courthouse," this gentleman went on to say, in answer to Lucy's query, c when the acei-  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7321-00000074"/> "6        EDITH ATLUN; OR, dent occurred. The young man was very carefully brought on thither, and left in the care of a good Samaritan, who had been one of the outside passengers."  A good Samaritan! How?" asked Lucy. "I call him thus, because this person, though an entire stranger to Hawk, as his questions relative to him indicated, yet behaved towards him, after his misfortune, with all the tenderness of a friend or a brother; even delaying his journey to see that he should be cared for.  So I called him a good Samaritan, though I learned that his proper name was Richland.'" "Richland! Charley Richland, for a wager!" exclaimed Henry Bentley. "It could be no other."  "I did not learn his Christian name," answered Allen. "A tall man, with a fair face, high, open forehead, large grey eyes, and smooth brown hair; with large hands and feet, if you chanced to observe these?"  "As far as I could judge of him by lamp-light, you have, described him accurately. I neither observed his hands nor feet; yet, the peculiar benevolence of his countenance struck me, especially in contrast with that of the object of his care, which, wrung with pain, and contorted in its features, as it was, I conceived to be one of- the most disagreeable counte- nances which I ever beheld." "'It must have been Charley Richlarnd-I am sure of it!- of whom it, used to be said, at school, that he was 'all feet, hands, and heart,' said Mr. Bentley. "f Who was this Hawk?" asked Dr. Claiborne; "I wonder if he,is a relation of old Gideon Hawk?" "I only heard him spoken of as a rowdy young man, who was, a session or two since, dismissed from the University on account of his disorderly conduct." In the course of the evening, Mr. Bentley again reverted to Richland.  They had been schoolmates many years before, when he was quite a small boy, and lived at his uncle Hen- shaw's-Susie's father's. He said, that no one had ever known Richland to do an unkind, deed, of which he did not   very speedily repent, seeking the earliest possible opportunity to repay it by some act of kindness. That kindness--benevo- lence, was the ruling feature in his character. "When I last saw him," he went on to say, " he was himself overwhelmed in grief, at the death of an only sister, to whom he was de- votedly attached. His distress was so excessive, that it was thought his intellect was somewhat shaken. I heard after- wards, that he had undertaken and gone upon a mission to some of the Indian tribes." Clement Allen spent the evening and night at Dr. Clai- borne's.   He did not see very much of Edith, and had only a few moments of conversation with her alone. But he had a deal of private chat with Miss Eenshaw; and we think    it probable that this young lady lent herself, as a sort of medium between him and his now very reserved lady-love.  The two certainly appeared to have much to say to each other, and of a highly interesting character. But we will only mention particularly, that, after having described to her, at her request, the rooms    which he had. engaged in Richmond, he informed her that Dr. Claiborne had promised to accompany him, on the next morning, on a visit to Mr. Letar6, for the purpose of obtaining his consent to the proposed union between him and her fair friend. He said, that as to the place where the ceremony was performed, that was to him, of course, a matter of the utmost indifference; but that, as Edithl chose that it should be Mr. Blundell's, he would punctually meet them there, on Wednesday morning, at nine o'clock precisely-the hour being fixed upon by Dr. Claiborne, who had written to Mr. Blundell to inform him of the arrangement; and who insisted that when the ceremony was over they should 'return at once to his house, as he intended to have a "jollification." He further informed her, with a mischievous glance of the eye, that he had begged a certain young friend of his to be with him, and hoped that he would be, although he had not heard from him. But, to delay no longer with these intermediate matters,- thinking, with Miss Henshaw, "that when people are deter-  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7321-00000075"/> "8        EDITH ALLEN; OR, mined to be married, the sooner they have it over the bet- ter,"-we will state, that Mr. Letar, when applied to, readily enough gave his consent, and wrote a note to the clerk of the county signifying as much, so that Clement Allen found no difficulty in procuring a license "to contract a marriage with Edith Letar&amp;." Further, that, on Tuesday evening, the young ladies, one and all, went over to Mr. Blundell's, where they were very cordially received, and hospitably entertained by the old gentleman and -lady. That, on Wednesday morning, they were joined by Dr. Claiborne and the two young gentle- men, Mr. Bentley and Mr. Dier; and that, a few minutes before nine, Clement Allen made his appearance, accompanied by the Rev. Mr. Arthur, Edward Stacey, and Willie David- son, who had reached Stacey Home late on the preceding afternoon. Little delay was made after their arrival. A brief but solemn ceremony was performed, and Edith was startled as she, a moment after it was over, was assisted into the car- riage, to hear the cheerful voice of Mr. Dier calling her "Mrs. Allen." Old Dr. Claiborne was as merry an a boy; and almost immediately, on their return, they met Mr. Brandt "coming with all his might," he said, to witness the cere- mony. After perpetrating some friendly jests at their haste, he turned about with them. Old Mr. Blundell had been pressed by Dr. Claiborne to accompany them; but he declared that he was "too old and poorly to be gadding about with the wild young folks/' Mrs. Blundell, while bidding Edith fare- well, slipped a little billet into her hand, whispering as she did so, "Let nobody see it!" To Edith's surprise, upon opening it, she found a fifty dollar note enclosed. The billet ran: "To buy you a dress, or anything you may need. "From your affectionate and indebted, aunt, "M. BLUNDELI, P. S. Be careful, if you please, to say nothing of this, my dear, I beg of you. M. B."   ,     SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      149 Edith felt very grateful to the old lady, and was particularly careful to obey the injunction conveyed in the postscript, which, knowing Mr. Blundell's weak point, as she did, she understood very well. -Willie Davidson had driven to Mr. Blundell's in a barouche, a clumsy sort of buggy, then much used in Virginia, with the happy Clement Allen, to whom now, however, by a general vote, a seat had been given, by his lovely bride, in the -carriage. When this arrangement was proposed, a sun-lit gleam of hope flashed across Mr. Davidson's heart, that Susie might, by a happy fortune, be his companion on their return. It was scarcely formed before it was justified; for, by a hastily concerted movement on the part of Helen and Lucy, executed purely in mischief, when Miss Henshaw reached the carriage, which she was rather tardy in doing, having lingered on the way to have one more jest with old Mr. Arthur, she found it occupied. Ellie, too, she saw, was already on her horse, and moving off with Mr. Bentley. "Did I ever!" she exclaimed, in an undertone, at the carriage door. Helen and Lucy laughed aloud with glee; and Mr. Allen and Edith, too, seemed to be amused at her apparent discomfiture. "I pity you, Miss Susie," said Clement, "but I cannot do any more. I am a married man now, and I cannot be expected to give up a good seat so readily as I have hitherto done." With a show of reluctance which would have deceived any one who did not know as much as Edith, and, perhaps, Clem- ent Allen too, Miss Henshaw took her seat beside the man to whom, even from her own admission, she had given leave to love her, and had promised to love in return "a little." "Oh, I was so much afraid that I might not have this pleasure," he said, when Mr\Dier, having handed her into the barouche, galloped on after the carriage. "You ought to be very much obliged to me for being so amused with ghod old Mr. Arthur." "My pleasure has but one alloy-your seeming repugnance to ride with me. Please tell me that it was only apparent, and I will be the happiest of mortals!"  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7321-00000076"/> 150        EDITH ALLEN ; OB, HiAh! you ought to be happy enough to have me with you at all, ought you not?" But a dense of politeness forbids us to intrude farther on this couple; and, like Mr. Dier, we will gallop on. The party soon reached Dr. Claiborne's. They had been here but a short time, when the neighbors began to pour in- young and old, rich and poor, one and all. "This young lady," said the old doctor, thought it her duty to go off silently. But I was resolved to have a general jollification; and so, neighbors, welcome all!-and pray make yourselves at home!" His own hearty glee anl liveliness, supported, too, as he weas, by Mr. Brandt and the good old Mr. Arthur-one glance at either of whom was enough to incite good humor-seconded well his invitations; and the still of diffidence was of short duration; and although those present were on their very, best behavior, there was quickly one "universal, miscellaneous hubbub," while, prominent among thejoyous ones, and louder than the rest, might here and there be seen sonme florid, over-dressed beau, with flowing, sunburnt ,'love-locks," and with many a bow and jesture% perpetrating broad jokes for the amusement of some giggling, red-faced miss, laughing immoderately, occasionally, at his own wit. Clement Alien, who knew them all, and who passed about among them, greeting every one in a friendly manner, mis- chievously introduced Mr. )ier to a Miss Arabella Evelina Seraphina Fox; a rery showy young lady, dressed as one would suppose that a girl with such a nam would be dressed, on such an occasion. But if he thought to tease Mr. Dier, he was egregiously mistaken. That young gentleman '"was in his element; " and when Clement Allen and Lucy Bentley, between whom there was, perhaps, some collusion in this attempt upon him, looked over to where he was, they saw him enjoying himself amazingly. Miss Fox, herself, was delighted with the young Georgian; she could not conceal her satis- faction.

"Now, you didn't hear me, did you?--Miss Bradly!-Mr. Dier!"--introducing her friend, "You didn't hear what I said to Betty, did you? Oh! I wouldn't 'a had you to 'a heerd for the world!"-half hiding her eyes with her hand- kerchief. "I only heard you say something about a 'creter;' and supposed that you were wondering if your horse had been attended to." "Now, you didn't--you mischief! Oh, Betty! did you ever hear tell!" "Willie, my boy!" said the old doctor to Mr. Davidson-- "you are at home here, and must make every body enjoy themselves as much as possible." "There's no need of trouble about that, my dear sir; for I never saw a set of people happier, or who seemed to enjoy themselves more." "Well, there is one of your old acquaintances, Cleo. Hill, (Cleopatra,) who seems to be left alone. Go and cheer her; she is looking serious." She had -been left alone for only a moment, however; for a couple of beaux, whom she had sent upon some errand, returned before Willie reached her; and this young gentleman not deeming his attentions necessary, wended his way to another part of the room, where, a moment before, he had seen the bright face of Miss Susie Henshaw. This young lady, however, was by no meanit stationary. She was passing about, amusing herself wherever opportunity offered. With an older daughter of Dr. Claiborne-Mrs. Holmes, who did not reside at her father's-Miss Susie took upon herself the duties of hostess, and availed herself of the privilege which this character allowed her, of lingering only so long at any particular point as suited her inclination.

Most of these, and of those with whom J we are acquainted, were somewhat exclusive, and held them-  t selves, without any presumptuous show, however, of course,  rather aloof from the promiscuous crowd. Not so, however, Mr. Dier. He made himself excessively agreeable-not to the charming Miss Fox only, but to many others. It is true, that he devoted much time and attention to her, perhaps, because he found this young lady and her friend, Miss Betty Bradly, peculiarly original in conversation and manners; or, perhaps, because he had an inkling suspicion, that Lucy Bentley, Clement Allen, and others, had some mischievous designs in first bringing him acquainted with her. But he, nevertheless, made himself, generally, very agreeable; and Georgia rose, that day, much above par, as a beau-rearing State, in the estimation of the young ladies whom he so pleasantly entertained. Among others, he was introduced to a Miss Furley. He conversed with her for a while and then moved on. In the course of the day, however, he again chanced to pass near her, with Miss Bradly clinging .to one   ,arranl o U'O LlFEs IN VIRGINIA.    153 arm, while the gaudy Miss Fox hung pendant upon the other. "I'll leave it to Mr. Dier, Mr. McGlasson--I'll leave it to Mr. Dier, there"-said Miss Furley. "I regret that you do, Miss, for your own sake; as in all disputes between ladies and gentlemen, left to my arbitra- ment, a fellow-feeling invariably leads me-laying aside all gallantry-to give my decision in favor of the gentleman, whatever be the question of difference." "Give us your hand, old fellow !-Give us your hand!" said the delighted McGlasson, whom I had never seen be- fore; and regardless of the pendent Miss Bradley, he gave me a gripe and a shake--said Dier--"which I never can forget! Nor did his.gratitude end here,"--he went on to say/, to Lucy and Susie, to whom he was detailing his adventures of the day--"nor did his gratitude end here; for, some half-hour afterwards, as I was standing alone, in the porch, where I had gone for a moment's rest, some one touched my arm--I say, stranger! you aint a lawyer ar' you ?' " ' Yes'--I answered-- I am something of a lawyer, when I am at home, that is to say.' " ' Well, stranger, if you ever settles any whar' in these parts, by zounds !'-hitting me a stunning slap on the back--- 'you gits all of Sam McGlasson's business !'" We will not vouch for the truth of this anecdote; for, as Lucy Bentley declared, he told so many rare stories of the occurrences of this day, that it was hard to believe that so much of what was ludicrous and outre could have transpired in the time. In fact, Mr. Dier had, at any rate, during the day, gotten into a high flow  of spirits; and when Lucy's remark somewhat checked his odd stories of the events of this day, he reverted at once to the past. "Ah, well, it was ever my luck to bear a hand in rare and unusual scenes. I remember having once 'rung in,' as they say, upon a party." He stopped as Edith came up to them,   &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7321-00000078"/> 154        EDITH ALLEN; OR, followed immediately by Ellie, Helen, Mr. Allen and Mr. Bentley.  "Well, go on," .said Susie-" tell us about it." "Yes, do not let my approach stop you."          i a I was just telling these young ladies of my once 'ringing in' upon a party. That is, I was not uninvited; but the awkwardness was the same. It was in Richmond, during my first visit to Virginia. I had-just finished my course at -- College, and was in some doubt-although I had come hither for the very purpose-whether Iwould go on, at once, to the University, as' a student, or not. My health was a little feeble, and I thought of taking a, Northern tour, instead of-- that is, previouslyto matriculating at the University. As I was strolling along the streets one evening, not dreaming that I had an acquaintance within fifty miles, who should come right up on me, at a corner, face to face but Dr. X--? I hadknown him some years before, in' Georgia. Indeed, my father had, during his life, shown him a good deal of attention; though I, myself, had not very much acquaint- ance with him. But he now recognized me at once, and seemed wonderfully pleased to see me. I found that he resided in Richmond, where he told me that he was getting as large a practice as he could attend to. He was now hu'- few moments. But he told me that he would be at home this evening, and insisted that I should call and take tea with him; saying that he had one of the finest wives in the world, whom he would-be pleased that I should become acquainted with. He gave me his address and hurried on. When night came, as I was a little lonely, I concluded that I would call and spend a short time with him. Being too tired and lazy to overhaul my trunks and expecting to see no one but the doctor and Mrs: X---- , I made no particular prepa- rations in my dress. In fact, I remember very well, that I was rather in traveling, than in visiting trim. At the door a servant met me. "'Is Dr. X--- at home?' I asked.   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRG INIA.     155 "' No, sir; walk in, sir. The doctor has stepped out- he'll be in soon--walk i, sir!' " He was so pressing, that I entered,--not doubting but that the doctor had informed his good lady of his invitation to me, and that I was expected. I had observed that the house was lighted up, but thought nothing of it until now, when I, all at once, heard the clatter of many voices. I was just turning to the servant to demand the meaning--for the doctor had said not a word of my meeting with company- when a showily dressed and fine looking lady, crossing the passage, met me. "' Mrs. X-L -, I presume '-making my obeisance. "'Yes, sir,' curtseying rather stiffly, as she scanned me from head to foot, with an inquiring glance. '  I introduced myself as 'Mr. Dier, from Georgia;' told her that I had met with the doctor that evening, and that he had invited me. The rest of my speechwas lost. I intended bowing myself out, as I had not been led to expect to see company, with the promise to call again; but she cut me short at once, greeting me most cordially. "Very much pleased to see you, sir; pray, walk in. The doctor will soon be in. We have a few friends with us to- night. Pray, walk in-much pleased to see you, sir.' And before I could edge in a word-even if I had now had the spirit to withdraw---she had opened a door to the right, and led the way into a room where there were ten or a dozen young ladies, and a few gentlemen.  Some fresh arrivals, immediately behind me, required her attention, I suppose. She turned to a young lady on the right, who was seated by herself, examining something upon a table--quite a pretty little girl, by the way, but apparently very young--'My young friend, Miss Arcliff, allow me to present to you, Mr. a-a,' (she mumbled something, certainly not my name,) ' from Georgia,' very distinctly said Mrs. X--. All eyes were bent on me; and I recollect perfectly, that I never in my life felt so shabbily dressed, as I did just at that moment. I took a chair near the blushing Miss Arcliff, and set in assiduously  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7321-00000079"/> 1 6     .   EDITH ALLEN; OR, to entertain her. I discovered, pretty soon, that she was quite 'A young thing, Just come frae her mammy.' Indeed, I suppose that this was probably the first time that she was ever out. Monosyllables and blushes were all that I could get from her. As I said, however, she was :a very pretty, modest little thing, and I could not but feel kindly towards her; so, though quite a diffident young man, I used my best endeavors to draw her out.  It was, nevertheless, rather a difficult enterprise. Soon running through all the little loose chat which I had at command, being almost wholly unaided by her, though I truly believe that the little girl did her very best, I took to asking of her the names of the other young ladies in the room, and all about them. She readily told me all she knew. I had observed that Mrs X--. had failed to give my name in introducing me, and so, after having asked the names of every other person in the room, I said: "'And now, Miss Arcliff, if you please, I would beg of you to tell me my own name?' "'Really, sir, I was so unfortunate as not to catch your name from Mrs. X--.' "'It would have surprised me much if you had, as she did not call it at all.' "The little girl looked expectant, but as I did not tell it, she took courage to ask: " 'And it is?'- "'Excuse me, Miss Arcliff; I was just thinking what a singular advantage I have of every person present--knowing all their names, and being myself incog.-you surely would not deprive me of this pleasure?' The few gentlemen who had yet arrived-for it was quite early-were gathered around a young lady, standing on the far side of the room from where I sat, whose face I had not yet been able to see, but who Miss Arcliff had informed me, was a Miss Strander from--I forget where, now--a stranger   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN, VIRGINIA.     157 in town, on a visit to Mrs. X---; who seemed to be enter- taining them all. She was one of those ladies we sometimes meet with, who can converse, at the same time, with a dozen gentlemen, as easily as with one. All the other girls were somewhat off to our right. One of these came just now to where we sat, and asked some question of Miss Arcliff about her sister, I think. 'Will you take this seat, Miss Walker,' I asked, rising and bowing. She looked at me a little sur- prised, thanked me, but declined it. I was just awakening to a sense of the remarkable peculiarity of my situation. I never could, in my life, resist the inclination to follow up the impul- sive whims suggested by surrounding circumstances. At the present time, I could feel fun and mischief creeping into my very bones. Miss Walker was   just turning away, when I addressed her: 'I really do believe, Miss Lydia, that you have forgotten "She looked at me, and answered quickly: "'Oh, no, I have not. That is,' she went on, 'I must con- fess, that I am unable, just now, to recall your name; but your face is perfectly familiar to me; yes, and your name, too-but, somehow, it very strangely escapes my  memory at this moment. Let me  see!'-and she took the seat which I had offered her. 'Perhaps, you have even forgotten where we last met!' I said, with a touch of sadness in my manner. "Oh, nO, sir; not at all,' evidently very much puzzled. "'In Norfolk, was it not?' with an inquiring glance. "'In Norfolk! I see, Miss Walker, that I was unhappily correct, and that you have completely forgotten me.' "'Who is he?' she whispered, behind her handkerchief, to Miss Arcliff. 'I don't know,' answered that young lady. - Perhaps, this will remind you,' I said, taking from  the satin lining of a neat little pearl-cased pocket-book, which a friend had given me, a withered rose-bud, which I had myself,  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7321-00000080"/> 158        EDITH ALLEN; OR, some six months before, gathered, in a sentimental mood, and thus preserved. This rather-alarmed her. "' No, sir,' she said despairingly, that does not either. ' She caught my eye; and, despite my attempt to retain my countenance, detected a twinkle of mischief, perhaps, for she went on: I do not believe that I know you at all! Who are you?'  '"As familiar as you acknowledge that my features are to you, Miss Walker?' "'No, I don't know you at all! Who are you?' "'My modesty forbids that I should go trumpeting my name abroad. Since your memory is so treacherous as not to recall it, we will let it pass, if you please, and turn to some other subject,' I said; and, as I had gotten into a high good humor, I did entertain her, and the pretty little Miss Arcliff, extensively on A11 manner of subjects. I had just been read- ing some book of 'Travels in the East,' especially sone inter- esting accounts of Egypt; and was pretty well posted up. I remember that, among other things, I dilated largely upon Eastern scenery, customs, manners, and habits; gave minute descriptions of scenes; discoursed learnedly of pyramids, of theNile, and what not; spoke of my feelings as I had stood alone, in the evening, upon the plains of Baccarah; described an imaginary approach to El Wah, the Grapd Oasis; and, of course, made my hearers stare. "But who are you, now? I really am anxious to know.' c'I beg your pardon, but I was endeavoring to turn from personal matters, and hoped that I was entertaining you i' ; 'Oh, so you have been-wonderfully!' she was saying, when a young gentleman coming up, I bowed myself off. "There was one young lady present, a Miss Julia Graham, whose name was very familiar to me, as it was a name which t my quondam room-mate, Charlie Alison, adored. Perhaps, this might be the identical Miss Julia, about whom he so frequently wrote -to me. She was by the piano, looking at a scrap of music. I approached her and addressed her by name-' Miss Graham!' She stared at me, and was drawing   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      159 back very haughtily, when, by good chance, she dropped her handkerchief. I recovered it instantly, remarking as I did so:' My friend, Dr. X--, did not inform me that I should have the pleasure of, seeing you this evening.' This remark was hastily uttered, as a sort of desperate catch; for I noticed that the glance of her eye was fearfully haughty. She ac- knowledged my courtesy with a killingly proud air; but my remark created an instant diversion. ' So he is a friend of the X--- 's, and entitled to respectful treatment.' I could see this in her countenance as plainly as if she had spoken it aloud. After a moment's consideration, she unbent a little. My remark had been fortunate in another respect, as I found from her reply: " 'No, sir; Dr. X--  did not expect me himself. I had declined his invitation, thinking that I should have been in the country this evening.' "'Unlooked-for pleasures,' I slowly said, (are far the best, as my friend, Charlie Alison, says.' I saw her little start of surprise at the mention of his name, and knew at once that all was right with me, as far as she was concerned. "' Oh, pride!' I said to myself, 'thou art mighty; but there is a little blind boy mightier still.' "' I agree with your friend,' she presently said; I unex- pected pleasures are the best, perhaps, though-' "' Though?  I asked. ' I was puzzling to find why they are,' she replied. "'Because, if you will allow me, we feel as though we had some right to such a pleasure as we expect. Besides which, imagination exaggerates these, and they become, consequently, stale and flat, falling short of our anticipations; while an unlooked-for pleasure is perfectly fresh, and we regard it as so much clear gain. I cannot but feel that. my meeting with you to-night is such, Miss Julia.' "' May I hint to you, sir, that you have the advantage of me, in knowing my name, while--' "' While mine has escaped your memory,' I interposed. o  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7321-00000081"/> 60        EDITH ALLEN; OR, (u No,.sir, looking at me very hard; 'I am perfectly sure hat we have never met before; I never forget faces.' "'Bless me, now, Miss Graham; and are you going to leny my acquaintance? I had best leave you at once'-- )owing, and moving away to the side of another young lady, whom I astonished in her turn. And I went the rounds, and 3poke to every girl in the room, with the exception of Miss Strande, who, still standing, kept a crowd of gentlemen around her. .There was one girl, a Miss Hallet, who was fully a match for me; and I cried quits with her pretty soon. As I approached her, bowing and smiling, and accosted her: "' Good evening, Miss. Hallet!'  "' Good evening, Mr. Smith!' she answered, dryly. "'I beg you pardon--but you are mistaken in the person who addresses you.' "'-Oh, no, I guess not. I know you, sir, fully as well as you do me!' she said, in the same dry, quick tone. She staggered my audacity considerably. "By this time no little curiosity was excited at that end of i the room, as to who I could be. ' I Who is he?'-' Who can he be?'-' Does nobody know him?' and the like questions, were heard on every side; and various expedients resorted to, for discovering my mame. "'Oh, Mr. Jones!'-' Mr. Smith!'-I looked the other way, as if I did not hear them.;  'Mr. Smith!'--' Mr. Jones!-I took no notice.  'Who can he be?' V  What did Mrs. X--   call him?'  'Mr.-you Mr. a-a-, firom Georgia!  "C Madam!' I replied, very promptly, and went at once over to where Miss Walker, who had made this last effort, was sitting. "'I am at your service, Miss Lydia, and quite happy that you have, at length, been able to recall my name." "If Miss Strande was the reigning star on the other side of the house, I certainly was becoming no less attractive on this.' The girls followed me around from one to the other. I was 'the great unknown.' I had endeavored to assume a   different character with almost every one of them--had made myself a very Proteus. As they all now, however, collected around me, listening very intently to every word that I said; and, as my spirits had risen beyond control, I made them a set speech, which I had not long before composed for our (Laughing Club,' at college, upon 'the sweet, sticky, and interesting subjects of love and molasses.' This speech was too much for Miss Strande's attractive qualities. She, with her whole posse of admirers, came over to hear; and I was the acknowledged lion of the evening.  A number of fresh arrivals had taken place; but I was introduced to the new comers as 'Mr. a-a-, from   Georgia.' I had hardly concluded my little speech -which, of course, I made very short-when I saw    Mrs. X--   enter. It was the first time I  had seen her since my    introduction to   Miss Arcliff.  I   feared much that   she  might, perhaps, remember my    name.  A     half- dozen young ladies at once beset her.  'Oh, Mrs. X---, please try to recollect it.' 'He  answers to 3ir. a-a-, from Georgia.' A     glance at her perplexed countenance, and I  felt safe in my incognito. Presently, rs. X--- approached I me. She apologized for having somewhat neglected me; hoped that I was enjoying myself, and, after awhile} proposed to introduce mne to her young friend, Miss Strande.  I  saw at once that it was a   ruse to learn my  name.  I  thanked her kindly. Should be very happy to know any friend of hers-- particularly Miss Strande. Aswe approached this young lady, DMrs. X--  turned to me: " 'I--I beg your pardon, sir, but your name has entirely escaped me in the bustle of the evening ?' " 'Oh, no harm done at all, madam. That seems to make but little difference in this  community, so far as my slight acquaintance serves.' She looked a little nonplussed. "(But how shall I    introduce you, sir?' "'Oh, as you did to Miss Arcliff.' By this time we were just before Miss Strande--within a   few feet of her-and she was looking up expectant. Once more, I was introduced as 'Mr. (mumble--mumble), from        Georgia.' Oh, it was fine  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7321-00000082"/> JLU6        YAJJl ll' ALUA^JlT 3I j Jil  fun! But just in the midst of my enjoyment, who should come in'- but Dr. X--. I was exactly before the door, and he came straight -to me :--'Ah, Mr. Dier, my dear sir, very happy that I find you here.' Dier '-' Mr. Dier!-' Mr. Dier!'-I could hear all over the room. 'Mr. Dier!-aha! Have we found you out at last?' exclaimed several. "'Why, what upon earth is the matter?' asked the Doctor.' "' Ah! my dear sir, you have ruined me utterly, spoilt all my sport, robbed me of my glory! Just now, I was the great unknzown-a host in myself--a curiosity-a wonder- a marvel! Now, alas! I am, once more, simply, Mr. Dier.' But my glory was gone. Who, from the pitch to which I had arisen, could descend to the tame courtesies of society? I was caught--after having been a traveler in Egypt; after be- ing the lion of the evening, making a speech to an admiring audience, on Love and Treacle,'--caught and proved to be an impostor, in that I was, simply, Mr. Alfred Dier. I made apologies to Dr, and Mrs. X---, for the liberties which I had, yielding to the impulses of the occasion, taken with their. guests, and pleading the 'fatigue of a traveler, very shortly afterwards, made my exit. I may as well finish my story by saying, that about two months afterwards, as I was passing down one of the most frequented streets of Phila- delphia, a female voice screamed out from a hack which was flying past me: 'Bless my life!-Mr. a-a-, of Georgia!' I could never distinctly decide whether it was Miss Strande who thus greeted me, or my friend, 1Miss Walker, the hack had passed so suddenly ;, though I felt sure it was one or the other of the ,two." Doctor Claiborne, with- old lr. Arthur and Mr. Brandt, whom he had prevailed upon to spend the night with him, had just joined the young folks, when Mr. Dier discovered-- or rather, Susie noticed, that he held in his hand a handker- chief, marked distinctly, "A. E. S. Fox." Upon searching for his own, it was missing. By what unaccoiuntable means the exchange had happened, he vowed that he could never discover. There .was, of course, much merriment at the   ...  .  .... .JAVO young gentleman's expense. He bore it very well, declaring that this accident was only a proof, if one was needed, of the peculiar eccentricity of his luck.  But many a day passed -before he heard the last of "that pleasant young lady, with the divine name, whose handkerchief you keep as a souvenir cousin Alfred "-for Lucy Bentley delighted in having somec- thing so good to tease him about. Doctor Claiborne in speaking to his particular guests of the promiscuous character of the assembly at his house, on this occasion, remarked, that he had been all his life practicing medicine among these people, in their families; that he had lived among them in a sociable, neighborly way, experiencing many acts of kindness and civility at their hands; and that he had no thought to take it upon himself to draw invidious dis- tinctions. He said that lie had felt like having a little fun; and that neither Edith- though she had refused to let him give her a party--nor any one, had a right to object to his inviting  his neighbors to spend  the day with him. He declared that he had felt quite youngjand happy, on the occa- sion-had enjoyed himself wonderfully; and only hoped that others had been as well pleased. , The three old men, after the uproar and  'fun" was over, gathered themselves to a cosy chat; which we presume they really enjoyed much more than the noisier merriment of the day; telling their anecdotes, for which, each of them, especially the old minister, was some- what noted. There is nothing in the companionship of the elderly so fascipating  to the young, as a  happy manner of relating an anecdote. This is a talent which exhibits itself to peculiar advantage in men of age; inasmuch as we     listen with     infinitely more complacency and  willing credulity to them, than to more youthful narrators. Perhaps, a rude wood cut, printed indelibly upon our memory, of an aged man recountln'g'pleasing stories to a group of interested juveniles, to which we were wont often to turn in our younger days, when     " Peter Parley's" narratives, admired as they were,  gave us no    little trouble in their perusal, may exert its influence upon us; for, we certainly do suppose, that there is no talent  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7321-00000083"/> 164        EDITH ALLEN; (OR, better suited to render an old man popular, than this of which we are speaking. On the present occasion, the lively prattle of our young friends was hushed in pleased attention to the three old gentlemen, who, seeing this, felt called upon, each in his turn, to exert himself especially;.and anecdote after anecdote was related, in quick succession, until a late hour, of the night, each one eliciting another to the infinite amusement of their hearers.    SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      165 CLEMENT ALLN went courageously to work after his mar- riage, as many a' brave heart had done before him, and as many another shall do; looking to Providence for health and opportunity, confidently defiant of poverty and its frowns. We know no more interesting character than that of a young husband, thus entering upon life, who with a brave heart is ready, by the honest exertion of his utmost powers, to compel favors from- fortune. It matters little who he is, or where an adverse fate may have placed him, that man is a hero, who, with a free and dauntless spirit, is ready to put his shoulder to the wheel and honestly push his fortune in the world. His independence is noble, and ever commands respect. But there is a peculiarly touching degree of interest added, when he has been able to persuade some gentle being of the weaker sex to unite her fate with his; and to cast her love, her hopes, her all, upon the strength of that arm--the courage and energy of that spirit to which he trusts himself. Let it not, however, for a moment, be supposed, that we are advocating imprudent matrimonial connections.  Heartily opposed to these, we invariably advise our friends of the rougher sex against entering upon them. We would' tender the same wholesome advice to the ladies. A crust, with con- tentment, is doubtless sweet; but without contentment-and a most necessary and savory sauce it is-the crust will prove dry and ungrateful; and we know of no more stern and uncompromising enemy to love, and all its delightful ad- juncts, contentment among the rest, than poverty.  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7321-00000084"/> 166        EDITH ALLEN; OR, It needs hardly be told that Edith comported herself admi- rably, in her new circumstances, doing credit to her husband's taste, and to herself, by her graceful, lady-like behavior, and agreeable, pleasing manners. Her mother's daughter could not have done otherwise. Indeed, a pure-minded, true-hearted woman, as she was, must appear to advantage any where. She had never been much in company, it is true; but she was possessed of good native taste, and had, with a quickness which approached almost to intuition, availed herself of all the opportunities which were offered her. Her gentle dig- nity, her retiring modesty, her highly cultivated mind, good temper, and easy cheerfulness, soon made her quite a favorite in the quiet, pleasant boarding house to which her husband took her. With all our partiality for Edith, and, of necessity, our friendly feelings towards him whom she loved, and to whom she gave herself, with all the trusting affection of woman, we have bestowed little attention upon Clement Allen. His character, thus indistinctly drawn out, appears, neverthe- less, to have been a noble one; and we have given Edith to him with as little reluctance as we could have felt in giving her to any one, with whom we were not better acquainted. We have now come upon another interval of several years in our narrative, relative to which, close search, and most dil- igent inquiries have only enabled us to gather a few facts. These we shall presently disclose. As some of them, however, are of a sad character, we approach them with reluctance. We thought here of comparing Briscoe Letar to a stream, whose general course we were pursuing from the hill country, : where we came upon it-approaching it now-now diverging from it; admiring the flowers which grow along our way, and enjoying each agreeable scene and prospect which, either nearer upon its brink, or farther off, rises to view. But a moment's reflection made us aware how unapt, in very many respects, such a comparison would be. Five years had elapsed since the occurrence of the events related in the last chapter. "I do believe marster is poor; 'spite of all folks says 'bout   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      167 it. I can't help 'spectin' it must be so; 'case 'taint my 'pin- ion any body would live like he do 'seppin' he was poor, sure 'nuff, I don't care how stingy he mout be;" said our old friend Ned, who had stuck to Letar through thick and thin. To judge from Ned's appearance, the servant fared not much better than his master; for his habiliments were no more than a continuous piece of patch-work, from ankle to neck; and his tattered old hat hung in slouches, about his head and face, and his countenance had a care-worn expression. "I lives better, howsomever, 'an any one would expec'; for marster's forever a gwine from home; and when he's dar, he's 'bleege to trust me. I'se a honest nigger, dat's a fact; but, den, thar's many little shifts and contrivances white folks knows nothin' un. An' in case at any time I gits mighty hard pushed, ken always git a good supper, by steppin' over to see Tea and the chillun, at Marce Holmes's." This remark leads us to inform the reader, that in this gap of years, over which we have passed, our good old friend, Doctor Claiborne, had, in the figurative phrase of Scripture, been gathered to his fathers. "Peace to the memory of a man of worth." Theresa, and her children, had been given to his eldest daughter, Mrs. Holmes; that is, of course, to her husband- with the express stipulation, that should Clement Allen and Edith ever wish to re-purchase them, they should be allowed to do so at fair valuation. Mr. and Mrs. Holmes now resided with her mother, at the old homestead, which would belong to them after the old lady's death. Elhe had, long ago, married Mr. Bentley, and Susie, too-yes, three years ago, she had narried "that tiresome boy." Nor was good old Doctor Jlaiborne the only one of! our acquaintances, whom "the pruning-knife of Time" had cut down. In fact, this sad lus-   "; rum might well have been illustrated by a death's head and ross bones. Mr. and Mrs. Blundell were both dead.

Stacey, Clement Alle's grand- father, who had been for many years in his dotage, died very so;n after Edith's marriage. Mrs. Blundell survived a year or two longer. Master "Calap Bwundaow Jonth," that used to be, was now a good stout boy, and heir to a fine estate, left him by his grandfather. In these five years, the old neighbor- hood had undergone many changes. Of our old friends, there remained Mr. Brandt-now grown to be an unhealthy, fretful old man-whom his sister, Miss Jemima, as kind and indus- trious as ever, waited upon with great affection and tender- ness. She had always thought her brother Sydney one of the greatest men who evei liivd.' Mr. Arthur, the good old minister, was still living; but in another county. Edward Stacey was gone off to college. He was said to be very popular; but, surrounded by a set of wild, frolicksome fellows, likely to do very little credit to himself as a student. Briscoe Letare, as we heretefore intimated, had long since lost the good opinion and friendship of every one but his faithful Ned. He was still a usurer, carrying on his dealings privately, and, for the most part, among the merchants of Petersburg and Richmond; lending sums for sixty, and ninety days, "for a consideration." He was now, however, grown almost too miserly to indulge his avarice. The hope of gain was hardly equal to the pain which a venture cost him. Dollars were drawn from him with many throes. Moreover, his fears were become excessive; and he required an amount of security which borrowers of money usually find it inconvenient to afford. All this was said of him. People are prone to say such things of such a man. Clement Allen had, once or twice, met him in Richmond; but Letar turned away from him, refusing to speak to him. Mr. Letar, from a short time before his marriage, had, for many years, been a not very healthy man; but hard fare, and hard usage, seemed to agree well with him. Separated from his daughter, during these years, did he never think of her? Yes, he thought of her, and often; but with displeasure and dislike. He knew that he had wronged her; and he sought to persuade himself   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     169 that it was she who had wronged him. He thought of Edith, in connection with his money-that treasured, worshipped money-and felt a jealous hatred of her.  This was her grand offence. Moreover, she had married an Allen-of the Stacey blood. The jealousy of which we spoke made him, however, rather rejoice in this, than otherwise, as it gave him such an excuse for cutting her off from all claims upon him. Consequently, he kept this offence constantly before him, and magnified it. When at home, most of his conversation, held with Ned, his only friend and associate, was in connection with the hardness of his lot; his deplorable and increasing poverty. Did he really mean that he was poor? Every one thought him to be very wealthy. This was mere matter of conjecture, however. Few could say anything of his wealth. Few ever saw him with money: Ned very rarely ever did, himself; and when this occurred, the sums were small; and Ned was assured that the money was not his own-only passed through his hands, in the way of business; and had to be paid over directly to some "firm," which he would men- tion. Living as they did, Ned made enough on the little farm to support them; and more; which surplus was eagerly sold, the proceeds going to pay some of Letar's pressing debts. Ned was too respectful ever to hint a doubt of the ex- istence of these debts, so often mentioned. His efforts were exerted in endeavoring to prevail on his master to retain enough to supply their actual necessities; and this he usually did, by hinting that they might, afterwards, have to buy at higher rates. Once, when Letard was urging his oppressive poverty, Ned asked: "And how come den, Maree Briscoe, every body says you's so rich, sir?" "Every body that says so is a fool, Ned. They speak of what they know nothing. The fact is, that a good deal of money has passed through my hands, in the way of business. I- lend money for other folks; but they get all the profits, almost. What little I can make, does not begin to pay my debts. I was, for many years, an agent for Mr. Blundell, *8I  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7321-00000086"/> 170        EDITH AWFTiN; OR, you know. Well, how much did I make by it? And the fools think the money is mine. The greater fools they, for doing so; and you, too, if you believe their idle stories- you who might know better; seeing as you do, how hard it is for me to get along." Some new and strange stories, about this time, got adrift, relative to Letar. This was their origin: A young Mr. Mc- Glasson, a brother of Mr. Dier's friend, having taken a crop of tobacco to Richmond to sell, wished, like many young countrymen, to "see the town." Among other places, a young acquaintance took him, late one night, to a noted gaming establishment. There was, as they found, only one visitor present. He was counting out money to one of the proprietors of the place. What was McGlasson's surprise, when he turned to recognize Mr. Letar! He appeared vexed at being caught in such a place.  "There! he exclaimed to the gamester: "It's all right!"-and hurried out, leaving this individual counting over and examining a roll of notes; though, as it seemed, in no very good humor. His annoyance was increased, when he found that McGlasson and his friend were not the persons whom he expected; and still more, when informed that they had come merely to see. He was, in fact, almost uncivil to them; and they quickly left the premises. When McGlasson told this story in the country, people opened their eyes in astonishment. It was at once recollected, that Letar had, in his youth, dissipated a fine fortune, by horse racing, gaming, etc. But for a long time now, he had been the last man who would have been suspected of such practices. Every one was ready to believe any evil reported of the "old miser." W:hile speaking of Letare, we may as well mention, that his bid enemy, Hawk, was dead. He had left a son-though of this Letar neither knew, nor cared-a worthless, poor vag- abond; the youth mentioned in a former chapter by Clement Allen, through whose drunken intermeddling the stage coach had been overturned, and his own arm and collar-bone broken, and dislocated.   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      171 We return to old Mr. Arthur. Old he was, and somewhat infirm, of course. But a bright old age was his; and he was still faithfully, and with a brave heart, doing his Master's business. We can almost see before us his benignant counte- nance, with his mild, yet undimmed eye, beaming with ear- nest kindness; his somewhat wrinkled, but broad and reverend brow, and his long, thin locks hanging in silvery curls about his neck. We cannot divest ourselves of the fancy-if it be only a fancy-that the mere sight of a countenance so serene and placid, is calculated to make the beholder a better man. But we have reverted to him for the purpose of advancing our narrative, not to remark upon the serenity of his counte- nance, or character. He had ever felt a deep interest both in Edith's mother and herself, since he had known them. This interest had not been at all diminished by her union with Clement Allen, as he had been for many years very warmly attached to the Allen family. An occasional correspondence had been kept up between him on the one part, and Clement Allen and Edith on the other. At the time to which we refer particularly, he was sitting in a small, but comfortable room, facing to the east, which he used as a study, on account of its retired situation; where were his books and papers; where he composed his sermons, and performed his private devotions. When he had' retired to this room, it was a family rule, of long observance, that he was not to de disturbed on any slight or trivial account. There was now a large Bible commentary lying open on a table, beside which he sat, weighing the ques- tion whether,- for the next Sabbath, he should prepare an entirely new sermon, or only dress over an old one. A light step is heard, and a tap at the door which shut him off from the rest of the building. "Pa!" called a gentle voice, "a letter for you, from Rich- mond, with a black seal!" "Ha! what!"-meeting her in haste-" a black seal? yes, from Edith! What can be the matter?" As he seated himself-for a sudden weakness had invaded the old man's limbs-he broke the seal and read; while his  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7321-00000087"/> '2        EDITH A4TLEN; tOR, daughter, (his only living'child, a widow lady, who resided with him,) interested and curious, lingered to hear.   His hands presently' dropped upon his lap, and he bowed his head, while a deep groan escaped him. " What is the matter, Pa i" a Clement Allen-is-dead !" i Oh, me !-dead !" " Yes! Edith--poor thing !-writes to me that he died on Monday morning-yesterday morning-after an illness of forty-eight hours." "Dear me! How distressing ! And what will she do ?- poor thing I" Mr. Arthur resumed the perusal of the letter. His dimmed eyes, his heaving chest, and quivering lip, testified his deep emotion. When he had concluded it, and was alone again, the old man "leaned his bowed head on his hands."    "Oh, Lord i" he cried, " unsearchable are thy judgments, and thy ways past finding out. But blessed be thy name ! I know that thou art faithful, when thou judgest; kind, when thou smitest; and that thy mercy hath no end!"       And the old preacher sank upon his knees, and long and fervently he prayed. Poor Edith! Her letter ran as follows: " March 26th, 1836. "REVEREND AND DEAR SIR : " How shall I make known to you what will so shock you-so grieve your kind heart! You were like a parent to my dear Clem- ent. Oh ! Mr. Arthur, last week I was a happy wife !

Why do the good die ? Ought they to be taken ? Ought the young and the stately, and the noble and true-hearted, to be singled out for destruction? Pray for me, Mr. Arthur! My reason almost deserts me. May God forgive me. I would not murmur at His will; but, oh, this is too much for    -.....o udV A JUlN' 1N VIRGINIA.    173 me! It does seem as though God had forsaken mel and I have more than I can bear! He bade me write to you, at once--he bade me do it-and shall I not? Yes, if the lines were to be traced with my heart's blood. To the very letter, will I write what he said. These arethis very words: "' Write at once to Mr. Arthur, Edith. Tell him how you are cir- cumstanced. Tell him that a dying man commits you, and little Amy, to his kind care. To him, and to God, I commit you! Beg him, in my name, to endeavor to reconcile you and your father-to engage Mr. Brandt with him in this. Were Mr. Fitzgerald in this country, I should name him likewise; but, alas! he is away. Remember me affectionately to Mr. Arthur, and Mrs. Rutherford. Tell him, that in my dying hour I thank him for all that he has done for me: that it is owing to his instrumentality, under Providence, that I can now say: Thanks be to God, who giveth me the victory. I prayfor him. May God reward him!' "These were his very words; and, now that I have told them, I can do no more; for, oh! Mr. Arthur, I am a stricken vine, whose prop and stay has been torn from its embrace. He bade me bear up--and I try-but, oh, how can I! "EDITH ALLEN." "Now  may the   God of the  widow look down in mercy upon this poor, stricken vine, and shed upon her the dews of heavenly comfort!" cried the old preacher, in earnest suppli- cation. He humbly begged of his Heavenly Father to heal the broken heart; to calm her anguish; to remember in ten- derness this poor, smitten child, and to aid and direct him in his efforts to assist and solace her. This was in the morning.  He   sent Edith's letter, enclosed in a note, to Mr. Brandt. For himself, when night came on, he was far on the way to Richmond. Thither we will precede him, at once, although he did not arrive there until the next morning. It is a  misty, foggy evening; a dense cloud of anthracitic and other vapor hangs upon the town. The cellar-doors are wet; the sidewalks are wet; and the fronts of the tall build- ings on either hand, brick or granite, though yesterday, in the clear, blue, sun-tinted atmosphere, they stood out boldly and proudly enough, with an aristocratic air, as if, inanimate  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7321-00000088"/> 174         DiTH. AtTiXN; OR, though they were, they would have said: ' We are the pride of the city!" now, still stood out, but with a bald prom- inence, proving that granite fronts, like the bipeds and quad- rupeds, are dependent upon circumstances for their pride and beauty. Few would have gone out without drawing their pro- tective garments more closely about them ere venturing to encounter the vaporous atmosphere which lay heavily, piled in heaps on the streets, pavements and cellar-doors, and wound in cloudy columns up the sides of the brick and granite walls. It was a piteous sight, to see the brave pride of the city thus dimmed; and the countryman, who was yesterday enrap- tured and dazzled, might now seriously question whether the weather-boarded gable-end of his own unpretending country dwelling, was not a fairer sight than these, bald as they were in the damp. Night was fast approaching. But on this dull and dripping evening, throughout the whole- length of a by no means unfrequented street-among the many who, with buttoned coats, and not a few of the cautious with umbrellas, were moodily traversing it-only one individual seemed to be par- ticularly curious or careful of the hour. With a hasty stride, he had just emerged from a cross street, and, pausing, stood with an air of some perplexity at the corner; when, with an indistinct peal, some mighty chronometer rung the hour, and lesser horologues in his immediate neighborhood began to emulate each other in catching up and prolonging the dull stroke. Unbuttoning a heavy and much faded and yellow overcoat, which had originally been gray, and which was fashioned somewhat upon the plan of our military watch-coats, with straight, quilted collar and broad capes, he revealed an inner person plainly but decently and respectably attired. Feeling about his right waisthand, this individual drew, by means of a steel chain, from under his vest, a huge, double- cased silver watch, which, to say the least, was a fair match for his overcoat. He was a tall, and, in the main, a well- formed man, apparently between thirty and forty years of age. His white hat, almost encased in crape, was worn far back on   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      176 his head, revealing an ample brow, and his large, mild, blue eye beamed with an overflowing benevolence. His was a countenance to attract attention; and a particular friend had likened it to a gleam of sunlight in a dark world. This was, of course, the exaggerated praise of partial friendship; but ifl his face spoke charity and good will to all mankind, it did only shew forth the feelings of his heart. He rejoiced that it was thus with him, as his face often won for him attention and respect, where the simple charity of his manner merely might have served him little. This man conceived that he had a mission. He certainly had a fixed purpose and constant aim, to which every thing else was rendered subservient. A small traveling-bag, which he held in a large, bony hand, betokened the wayfarer. He appeared to be satisfied as to the rectitude of his watch, and the massive instrument was returned to its place. But the shade of perplexity again gathered on his countenance. '"Ah!" he muttered, "the city is not the place for me. Guns of large calibre are needed here. The small weapon of the sharp-shooter avails little." Just then, with a leisurely step, for such an evening, he saw a fine-looking youth advancing towards him down the pavement. He was a noble-looking fellow, gentlemanly in ap- pearance and movement. You might search a long summer's day, and not find his equal. As he was passing, our stranger raised his hand to his hat. The youth looked up, and in a slight, but by no means supercilious manner, returned the salutation. "I am a stranger in your city, sir; will you please be good enough to direct me to  ?" "You are not far off, sir. Pass on by that block of build- ings,"-pointing-"cross two streets, pass a little way up the third, and you will be at the place." "Thank you, kindly, sir.' . He looked as though he wished to say more, and the young gentleman, who was about passing, glanced at him enquiringly. "You have done me a   favor, and I would fain return it." /  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7321-00000089"/> 176        EDITH ALLEN; OR, From the pocket of the overcoat he drew a printed tract. "Will you-?" The youth, seeing what it was, drew back. "It is the offering of an humble individual whom you have obliged. Will you not accept it?" While this was going on, a band of boys, for the most part dirty and mischievous looking, had come up, by the cross street. Two of them, however, were better looking and better dressed than their fellows. "Hey, boys," said one of these, "there's long-tailed gray!" "Oh, crikey, what a coat!" cried another. Hold on, boys," said the first, " and I'll just finish it off. I don't think it has quite enough tail;" and he advanced, with a torn play-bill, towards the stranger. "Stop, George!" cried the other well dressed little fellow, ' stop! he's a preacher?" "He aint," said a dirty little urchin; "he's nothing but a tract-man!"!  "I'll do one favor for him, any how," said George; and creeping up behind the stranger, he hastily pinned the play- bill to his coat, just while this personage was offering his tract to the handsome young man. The great bony hand was suddenly inserted in the overcoat pocket, and drawn out again with a fine, large, red and yellow- streaked apple. The stranger turned about just as George, having attached the paper to his coat, was making off. "-Here, my little man!" he said, in a mild voice. George looked back. "Here is a peace-offering. Will- you not take it?" "George was about to apply his thumb to his nose; but he saw the apple. It was a luscious looking apple. "Will you not take it?" "Hwould like to have the apple--but-" "But what, my little man? You are not afraid of me, are you? I won't hurt you." George looked him in the face.   j SKETCIIES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.    - 1" "I don't think you would hurt me, "he said at length, and I'm not afraid to take it-if-- " "What?" asked the stranger. "If you'll let me take the paper off?" "Oh, certainly. That shall not be a hindrance between us.? George hastily and very cautiously took off the appended play-bill. The stranger thanked him, and, with an air of free sincerity, gave him the apple. During this little scene, the handsome young man's countenance .underwent a change. His face was very red, as he touched the sleeve of the old grey overcoat. The stranger turned. a I beg your pardon, sir-I will take the tract which you offered me, thankfully." The kindling benevolence of the stranger's countenance was indeed like sunlight, as he instantly handed forward the tract. "And will read it, I trust, with pleasure and profit," he said. "With care and attention, sir, at least, for your sake, what- ever it may be." The unexpected acquisition of such an apple was too much for George. His face likewise grew very red, as he said: "I beg your pardon, too, sir. I did not know you were such a good man, or I wouldn't have pinned it on." "Oh, never mind that, my little fellow. Boys will be mis- chievous; and you did not hurt me in the least. But you may learn a lesson from it. As for me, you can repay me, if you think that you have wronged me." George looked inquiringly at him. He, after a little search, drew forth another tract. "Take this, and read it-will you?" "Yes, sir."        'x, "You will be sure to read it? Will you promise me?" "Yes, sir." "Well!" exclaimed the stranger, as he rubbed his hands with satisfaction, "the apple was given me for a tract; and I have bestowed it well, I hope." Suddenly and -fiercely the wind began to blow, and the  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7321-00000090"/> 178        EDITH ALLEN ; OR,              1 columns and wreaths of fog and vapor were instantaneously swept away. But a gloomy and a stormy night seemed to be gathering. The great-coated stranger passed on his way. Just about this time, Edith Allen, worn out with watching, excitement and grief, had leaned over upon the couch where her little daughter, a beautiful, brown-haired, fair-skinned girl of about three years of age, lay slumbering. Edith herself had slept almost none since Saturday; and it was now Wed- nesday. She leaned over by her fair child, clasping to her breast a small pocket Bible, which had been her mother's, and which, during this murky evening, she had been endeavoring to consult. The proprietors of the boarding-house, and par- ticularly her landlady, the good Mrs. Reft, had ever been kind and attentive to her. Edith was a pleasant boarder, and Mrs. Reft had become much attached to her. She had exhibited this attachment in earnest sympathy with her in her bereave- ment, and in tender, almost motherly, care of her and her child. She had, by every means endeavored to prevail upon her to take some repose; especially since the burial, which had that morning taken place; but vainly. Poor Edith! her heart was well-nigh broken, and sleep fled her eyes. Now, however, nature sunk under exhaustion. Mrs. Reft, with a light step, entered. Mother and child both slept. Over the former, the kind-hearted landlady, gently and tenderly spread a shawl, and a loose blanket which lay near. She noiselessly stirred the fire in the grate, and withdrew. Edith slept profoundly, the heavy, oblivious sleep of utter exhaustion; in which even fancy's voice is hushed, or, at least, memory takes no cognizance of her light whisper- ings. She was awakened by a most frightful crash! She bounded to her feet. Her door was burst open. "Haste, lady, haste! we've not a second to lose! The roof is already falling in!" A glare from the windows, revealed to her a tall man, in a straight-collared overcoat, with a white hat, almost encased in crape. (I Oh. haste, lady!" and he proceeded to wrap the blanket   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      179 about her. The room was already filled with smoke, almost to stifling. This, and the glare from the windows, rather than his words, made her aware of the dreadful circumstances in which she was placed. "My child!"-she screamed--"Oh, my child!" Seizing little Amy from the couch, the stranger placed her in her mother's arms, and wrapping the blanket hastily around them both, took them up together in his own. "And now, God help us!" he said, as he rushed with themn through the door, in which the stifling smoke was pour- ing in a stream. As heo turned down a flight of stairs, a ter- rible crash is heard behind him, and he with his burden, is enveloped in fragments of rubbish and splinters of blazing and burning wood. As he reached the second story the smoke was absolutely blinding, and a sheet of flame, which streamed and flickered up through the staircase from the first story, for a second curled around him, as, groping along by the wall, he reached a door. He threw this open, and entered a bed room. At a window here, which had been stove in, there was a ladder, and there were a couple of firemen entering. They relieved him of his burden, and in a few moments more Edith and her child, and her gallant preserver, were safe in the street, where the rain was pouring briskly--very grateful and refreshing, after the suffocation which they had endured. With a sense of preservation, came also a sense of the terrible fate from which she had so narrowly escaped; and it was in a swooning state that Edith was borne, she knew not where. The fire had broken out simultaneously in several parts of the building, and was, evidently, the work of an incendiary. The gallant firemep, deservedly noted for their intrepidity and efficiency, rushed 'to the rescue. It was impossible to save the house, and their whole attention was drawn to adjacent a  buildings. It was believed that every person had escaped a  from the burning edifice. Our man of the overcoat had hur- ried to the scene, at the cry of "fire!  He was inquiring if every one had escaped, when Mrs. Reft first thought of Edith.  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7321-00000091"/> 80        EDITH ALLEN; OR, "Mrs. Allen!-oh, Mrs. Allen!" "Where is she ? In what part of the house ?" "Third story, left hand." Off he hasted. A ladder was at a window of the second story, where some efforts were being made to save the furni- ture. He reached Edith's room just as the roof was falling in. A moment more, and he had been too late. Poor Edith had nothing left of the little she possessed, save the clothes which she had on-her child--and her mother's Bible, with which she had fallen asleep, and to which, in her fright, she had still clung. She was borne to a neighboring house, whose inmates knew her-knew of her recent afflictions, and who took charge of her with the utmost tenderness and attention. Her fright was gently soothed, a mild anodyne given her, and the little Amy placed in her arms. The poor child was nearly as much worn down as her mother, having been weeping almost incessantly for the last few days, through sympathy. In a short time they were both once more soundly asleep. On the next day, which was Thursday, 29th of March, the weather was raw and blustering. When old Mr. Arthur reached Richmond, he was much startled to hear of this recent accident. When he found out where Edith had been taken, he- hastened thither. Asking for Mrs. Allen, he was at once ushered into her presence.  "My dear, dear child!" as she leaned her head on his shoulder; and the old minister wept.  " Oh ! sir, he whom you gave me is taken away ! " "I did not give him to you, my daughter! The Lord gave him to you. He gave him, and He hath taken him away; blessed be His name!" "Amen !" said a deep voice near. "Why, Mr. Richland! Is it possible!" exclaimed Mr. Arthur. "How do you do, sir?"    And there' stood Edith's preserver of the night before. "I have just called to ask after Mrs. Allen's health this morning; and: to inquire if I can render any further service    SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      181 to her," said this individual, after cordially greeting them both. There, before Edith, was that same mild countenance which had beamed upon her in the frightful scene which burst upon her benumbed senses, when, last night, she had so suddenly, yet solate, awakened.  Again she gave him her hand: "Oh, sir, how shall I thank you ?" "Mention it not. Thank me not at all.t You know who He is to whom    your thanks are due---to whom I, also, am humbly thagod ful as bing instrumental, in His hands, in doing good." Mr. Arthur now learned the circumstances of Edith's rescue. " I was not aware, my dear sir"--Mr. Richland went on- "that you were in Richmond; nor, indeed, that you  were a friend, or even an acquaintance of Mrs. Allen. Hoping, sir, to meet you again -for I always love to see you-I withdraw, asking pardon for my unintentional intrusion upon this your first meeting. I called, as I said, to offer my further ser- vices--and they are offered  however needless they may now be, as Mrs. Allen is in such good hands. But I leave her to you."' "Yes; she is, in one sense, my daughter; and I have come for her. But we are both thankful to you." Richland had, naturally, made some inquiries relative to Edith, and had come to offer his aid and assistance, in her present difficulties. Like Mr. Arthur, who had preceded him only a few seconds, he had been ushered into her presence. He had learned more of her circumstances than Mr. Arthur was as yet cognizant of. He gathered from  Mr. Reft-from the com munlcative Mrs. Reft--and others, the facts, that but a few Weeks before Clement Allen's death, the house in which he had for so long been employed, had failed; that w  hat little he had laid by in the last  five years, had been left in the. hands of his employers, and, consequently, was lost that of this and his past year's salary, he had been able to obtain only a   small sumn, which he had paid over to Mr.  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7321-00000092"/> i2        EDITH ALLEN; OR, Reft and others; and, further, that for board, room-rent, etc., he had died indebted to that gentleman to the amount of nearly an hundred dollars. Hearing all this, and believing, from everything which he could gather, that Edith and her child were not only bereaved of husband and father, their only stay, but that they were, even now, penniless, and,' since last night's loss by fire, in circumstances of destitution, he had hastened to call upon her, stranger though he was, to offer any assistance which he might, and to aid her in en- quiring for and communicating with her friends, if she had such. The old minister had heard something of the failure of Clement Allen's employers; but he had thought that the only way in which this could affect his young friend would, possi- bly, be by throwing him out of present employment--a slight matter in itself, as he knew very well that Mr. Allen's good conduct and business habits had won for him the favorable notice of many other men of business, some of whom had, before this, made overtures to him. When he heard of his losses and indebtedness, and of Edith's absolute poverty, he was much grieved. She, in her deep and bitter distress at the loss of her husband, thought little of such things. When they were brought before her, she knew not what to do, and was completely at a loss. Mr. Holmes, who, since Dr. Clai- borne's death, as his executor, managed, along with Mr. Brandt, in the matter of her yearly allowance, had already paid over the sum for the year-two hundred and forty dol- lars-which, at her earnesit entreaty, her husband had used in the payment of his debts. To pay Mr. Reft, at present, was utterly impossible; nor did he expect it. When the old minister mentioned it to him, he only expressed sympathy for Mrs. Allen. He declared that he did not at all blame Mr. Allen; that he had hitherto been very punctual in the pay- ment of his bills; that it was no fault of his if he had been less punctual for the last twelve months; or that he had not paid him every cent. Several days passed before Edith was considered strong    , ,- a , SLY v 1ffiuIN 1A. 100 enough to travel. In the meantime, her old friend was careful in seeing that she and her child, the little Amy, were comfortably provided with suitable clothes. He need not have troubled himself about this, however; for the ladies-- those who knew Mrs. Allen, and others who became inter- ested in her misfortunes-in a very short time made comfort- able and ample provision, in this respect, for the mother and her child. Edith had not at all begun to bear up under her affliction. Before the coming of her good old friend, she had been most completely unnerved; and since his coming, she only leaned implicitly upon him, like a bowed and wilted vine indeed exerting no strength or thought of her own. In connection with their further stay in Richmond, we shall only mention, that old Mr. Arthur was invited to preach on Sabbath.    Unlike most of the country clergymen, when called upon to address a city audience, he purposely made his discourse as plain and -as simple as possible; without at all, however, laying aside the earnestness of persuasion for which his preaching was remarkable.    Some   of his hearers after- wards declared, that they were impressed, during his sermon, with the fancy, that it might be good old John     ]Bunyan himself, or Richard Baxter, who was addressing them. Of Mr. Richland, Edith saw no more. He had left the town    for the country on the second day after the fire.  A little incident connected with him we may here relate. It occurred  immediately after he had called upon her.  We mentioned. that it was a raw, blustering day. As he passed down  the  street, a  sudden flaw  of wind whipped the old crape-bound hat, now in no slight degree scorched and singed, from his head. A shout arose from a group of boys over the way. It was instantly hushed, however, and one of them, a well dressed, handsome little fellow, bounded forward and caught the tumbling hat, as it hung for a moment against a post near him,  and  politely brought it to the owner.  It was his acquaintance George. Mr. Richland smiled as he recognized him.   &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7321-00000093"/> 181        EDITIT ALLEN; OR, at Mother told me to thank you, in her name, if I saw you again, sir, for the good tract which you gave me last evening." "Ah! and who is it thanks me, if I may ask?"  "Sir?" "I wished to know your name." "Oh! I am named George Glengyle." Mr. Richland started. The smile passed from his face, and he turned, for a moment, deadly pale.  "And your mother's name was lmrnma Seaward?" George seemed surprised. "Yes, sir! That was her name before she was married." ' Mr. Richland appeared much agitated. He bade George good morning, hurriedly, and somewhat coldly, and started on. But he turned again. "Say to your mother, that I knew her once. My name is Charles Richland." And again he hastened on his way. "Ah!" he muttered, "Will Hcan I never forget?" There is many a name, the utterance of which will cause some hearer to ,start.. There is many a man and many a woman who has often occasion to mutter, bitterly: ,'Can I NEVER forget?"Who has not wished that, among the won- ders of science and art, some kind nepenthe might be discov- ered-some forgetful draught concocted?  But the boon would be abused. Besides, it were superfluous. There is a balm in Gilead! A worldly poet has sung: "Come, ye disconsolate, where'er you languish, Come, at the shrine of God fervently kneel; Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish; Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot heal!" The verse was suggested as we turned to Edith, It was a pretty, bright morning, when a carriage was driven slowly up the hill, upon whose summnit is situated the burying-ground. Three persons alighted from it when this sacred spot was reached: an aged gentleman first, who handed out a lady, closely veiled, and in the deepest mourning, and a little girl,   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      185 dressed also in black. The carriage was left in waiting for, perhaps, half an hour; when the gentleman almost bore the lady, who was weeping bitterly, back to it, and assisted her in; handed the little girl, who was sobbing violently, too, to her side, and followed himself. At night, this carriage with its sorrowful inmates, was far away in the country; and on the next day, Edith, and her child, and old Mr. Arthur, reached the modest, but comfortable, home of the latter, where he most kindly and affectionately welcomed her. Of their conversation during this ride, we will detail only a scrap: "And how are Amy and I to live?" asked Mrs. Allen. "'It will be my first business," replied Mr. Arthur, " to see Mr. Brandt, and consult with him as th what we can do for you. Until we can do something, of course, my dear, my house is your home," "Oh, sir, you are so kind! I have no right to give you so much trouble; and we have no claims upon you, that--" "Now; you must not talk in this way, Edith, nor think thus, or you will give me great pain; which I know that you are not willing to do. You are my daughter in the Lord; com- mitted, many and many a time, to my care and to my prayers, by your mother--committed to me by your husband. All of his family have many claims on me--real claims; for I have been befriended by the Aliens in very many ways, and at times when I should otherwise have suffered for the ordinary necessaries of life. You must neither talk nor think thus." "But, sir, if my father--you know my father, sir-if he refuses and denies us, what are we to do?" "Trust yourself, my daughter, in His hands, 'who heareth the young ravens when they cry.' Prudence and forethought, where they can be of any avail, are well. Mere anticipations of evil, however, are not good; nay, indeed, they are wrong; sinful. d 'Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed."' They reached the old minister's safely, where Mrs. Ruther- ford and Mrs. Hardy-a neighbor, who had stayed with her  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7321-00000094"/> 186      J  EDITH ALLEN; OR, during her father's absence-had been expecting them for several days. An apartment was ready for the reception of Mrs. Allen and her little girl. Mrs. Rutherford was exceed- ingly kind and affectionate to Edith. Little Rose Rutherford, her daughter, a sweet little girl, soon grew acquainted with Amy. The two were very nearly of the same age. All Rose's playthings-toys, dolls, boxes and scraps-were at once shared with the little stranger; for Mrs. Rutherford promised to pay her back for whatever she permitted Amy to have. She had also excited her compassion, by telling her of poor little Amy's sorrows; and the little stranger was soon made to feel at home. Old Mr. Arthur was fatigued and much worn out with the unusual excitement which he had lately undergone.  He waited not many days, however, before he went to see old Mr. Brandt. He found this old friend of ours much ailing. Mr. Brandt had been, for years past, subject to occasional attacks of something like vertigo. These had latterly become more frequent; so much so, indeed, as to alarm him and give very much uneasiness to the attentive Miss Jemima. Old Mr. Ar- thur, judging of others by tKe warm feelings of his own heart, could not conceive how Mr. Letar could do otherwise than fly, with open arms, to his daughter, when he should hear of her destitute and forlorn circumstances. For himself, he had received his own child, Mrs. Rutherford, back to his home, upon the death of her husband, with joy for her coming; though he sympathized deeply with her in her loss. It is true, that the cases were very different; that she had married with his consent and approbation; that he had ever loved, very tenderly loved his daughter. But he conceived, that her reception back to the paternal roof would have been fully as warm and welcome, if she had left it and married against his will. He could not conceive of a parent who had no love for his child. If it was Edith's marriage with Clement Allen which had estranged her from her father, the cause- of that breach was now removed. Surely, the father's heart would be easily won to forget the offence, and to overflow with ten-   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      187 derness towards his returning child. Mr. Arthur knew that Letare's character was harder than ever. He knew his miserly disposition; but thought that even a miser's heart would be moved, under the circumstances. He had sanguine hopes, that he and'Mr. Brandt would find but little difficulty in effecting a reconciliation between Mrs. Allen and her father. Mr. Brandt, however, quickly assured him of the utter falsity of any such hopes. He knew Letare much better than Mr. Arthur, who resided in another county, and at some distance. "We can make the application to him. I am perfectly willing to make any endeavor. But, sir, I have not the re- motest hope of success. I suppose, that there is probably not another man in the county who would not do more for her than Briscoe Letare-her own father! She is nothing to him. Nobody is anything to him. lHe is nothing to himself. His whole soul, his every thought and care, is for money. He grudges himself the crust which is necessary to support his own life, and almost starves himself, I am told. Is it to be supposed, that such a man will open-heart he has none- will open his purse to his daughter, or to any one? I tell you, no!" Mr. Arthur spent the day with the old lawyer. Mrs. Al- len's affairs were discussed, at full length, between them. It was their conclusion, that Mr. Arthur should, in the first place, write to Letare, laying his daughter's case before him: her misfortunes, her present circumstances, and place of abode. It was debated, whether he should do this, or Edith herself. Mr. Brandt thought it best that the old preacher should, for reasons which it is needless to detail. Mr. Arthur should write to him at once. And Mr. Brandt promised, that in a few days, allowing Mr. Letare a little time to reflect upon the matter, and when he himself grew a little better in health- for he had been more unwell for several days past-he would ride over to Elvy's Hill, and follow up, as well as he might, any favorable impressions which his old friend's letter might create, and do whatever he could for Mrs. Allen, with her father.  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7321-00000095"/> 188        EDITH ATTFN j O0R Mr. Brandt's house fronted upon the street of the little village. There was a long, covered porch, a sort of veranda, wtich extended the whole length of the building. At one end of this, there was a platform or landing, leading, by a side door, into his office, which opened, by an end door, di- rectly upon the street. Just while the old minister was preparing to leave, a servant announced that some one-"a man"--wished to see- Mr. Brandt. By his orders, this per- sonage was asked into the office, with the request to wait for a few moments, when Mr. Brandt would attend him. As the two old friends were somewhat long in their leave-taking- Miss Jemima, too, having a world of affectionate messages, to send to Mrs. Rutherford and Mrs. Allen-we will accompany this stranger into the office. The servant boy, by a standing -order, whenever a stranger was admitted in his master's ab- sence, remained with him. The individual upon whose pre- sence he now attended, was a doubtful looking character, dressed in a "Cshabby-genteel" style, and with one of the worst countenances which the sable functionary of the man of law, who had seen all sorts of people, ever beheld. In stature, he was of less than a medium height, and quite thin, and sparely formed. He appeared to be from twenty-five to thirty years of age. He wore long locks of very black hair, on either side, with beard, somewhat long, of the same color. His complexion was dark; his cheek-bones remarkably high and prominent; his forehead retreating--peculiarly so; and his eye-brows thick, and meeting over eyes originally black and piercing, but now somewhat dimmed and filmy, and very red. . His nose was an irregular mass, also very red and sleek-so much so. as to lead one to suppose, that a drop of rain falling upon it, would be thrown off as from a hot iron- somewhat swollen, perhaps; in hue, a very Bardolphian nose, indeed. His upper jaw prominent, and far over-lapping, was covered by a long, thick lip-sunken a little, just in front, where a couple of teeth were missing--which it appeared difficult for the nether lip to come well up to. His chin was indistinct and retreating, like his forehead. He seated him-   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      189 self in a chair, placed for him by the boy-an intelligent, but saucy looking lad. "I say, boy, you couldn't get me a drink of real cold water, could you? I am as dry as the Great Sahara." The boy handed a pitcher and tumbler, which sat behind the door; the latter of which, he filled twice for the thirsty stranger. "Was she mighty dry?" he asked, as he set away the utensils, when the stranger declined taking any more. "Who?" "Sarah." "Blast your white eyes! You had better make yourself scarce, you impertinent scoundrel!" said the stranger, turning upon him with an angry glance. The boy, who was named Peter, edged off towards the door, not liking too well a close proximity to one who looked so fiercely, and who met his ad- vances so gruffly. The stranger scanned the apartment. He took up a law book which was lying on a table near him, and listlessly turned the leaves for some minutes. "I say, boy-confound it!-is your master never coming?" "Oh, yes, I spose-"Peter began with an impudent air; but he caught the stranger's eye, and  instantly answered respectfully:, t He'll be here torectly, sir." "Well, I wish that he would come along." Several minutes more elapsed, and Peter, also growing wea- ried, commenced whistling. The indignant stranger straight- ened himself in ire. "I say, boy! Perhaps you do not apprehend who it is you are whistling to? What do you take me for? May be, you think I  am not a gentleman-do you?" "  Oh, no, sir! Seed what you was the minit I sot eyes on you.- Know'd you was a   gent'man, sir. Ken alway tell a gent'man soon as I sees him." "Why, then, did you dare to whistle at me?" "I  wa'nt a whistlin' at you, sir." "You were not, ha?" "No, sir. I thought may be as how the boss mout hear  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7321-00000096"/> 190       - EDITH ALLEN; OR, me, and 'twould call him to mind that you was a waitin' fur him ." "Ha! and he's forgetful of his visitors, is he?" "Oh, the boss is gittin' ole and pretty stiff; and he don't care not a crack of my finger---" Whether Peter's varied tones and manner, now exceedingly impertinent, now insultingly humble, led the stranger to seek a singular revenge, or whether it was only his impatience to see Mr. Brandt, we cannot tell. He interrupted Peter, by crying out: "Well, whistle, then, if that will call him,; whistle, I say." But Peter, finding it inconvenient to whistle upon compul- sion, made no effort. "Will you whistle, you white-eyed villain?"--bounding forward and catching him by the collar before he was aware of the movement. "Whistle, sir!"And he gave him a shake so determined as to make the frightened varlet quite doubtful as to what might come next. So, seeing the stranger resolved upon having him whistle, he began to make ineffectual endeavors to obey him; the more readily, as he saw the hilt of a bowie, knife projecting from his left breast. ' Louder, sir; and distinctly!" said the stranger, who, having let loose his collar, was standing before him. "Dis- tinctly, I say." The impudent Peter was really frightened, and did his best. If he paused, even to take breath, the irate stranger, with a movement of impatience, would 'hiss at him, through his broken teeth, "Will you whistle, I say?" It was a ludicrous scene, that of Peter (whistling to " call to his master's'mind" that an impatient- visitor was waiting for him. He used afterwards to declare, that the hardest thing he ever undertook to do, was to whistle for that man ;  ^for all he could do, he couldn't make his mouth stay puckered." The stranger at length appeared satisfied, and turning away, again scrutinized each portion of the little office. He was   a,  SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     191 still looking around intently, when Mr. Brandt, who had accompanied Mr. Arthur out to his carriage, called out, "Peter!--Peter!"  This individual hastened to obey the call. "I do believe the black villain was put here to watch," muttered the stranger, when Peter was gone. "Yet, why? Is it possible the old fool keeps his money in here? What is this?" and he opened the door of a small desk or case, cut up into pigeon holes, which were, for the most part, filledc with papers; By accident, his hand fell on one of these, and he drew forth a paper. He started, as he saw on the outside the name, a  Letare." He curiously turned up one corner of I the folded yellow document. Here he saw the name, "Bris- coe Letare," followed by a circular flourish surrounding the letters I' L S." "Aha!-May be, now, this is worth something." Just then he heard approaching footsteps. He gently and quickly closed the door of the press; and, pocketing the paper in question, resumed his seat. He was scarcely fixed in it, when Mr. Brandt entered. - The stranger introduced himself as "Mr. Vincent Hawk," and referred at once to a letter, which Mr. Brandt acknowledged that he had recently received. But, as his business is wholly unconnected with our narrative, we will leave them.  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7321-00000097"/> 192         EDITH ALLEN; OR, IT is with some reluctance that we speak of Briscoe Letare, as he now had become. The once gay and cheerful, warm- hearted and free-handed boy; the owner of old Longstowe; the ardent, yet light-spirited lover of Mary Stacey; the hus- band of Ellen Transmere, and the parent of Edith; it would pain us to speak of him as he had now become. Let a char- itable silence be spread over the faults and frailties of our fellow-men. About three days subsequently to the visit of Mr. Arthur to the old lawyer, Letar received at once, three different written communications, which we will severally peruse. From one, which bore the Richmond post-mark, there drop- ped, when he opened it, a scrap of. paper, laid off with red and black lines. Upon this scrap, Letare read the follow- ing: "CLEMENT ALLEN,       In account with JNO. R. REFT. To 73 weeks board, room rent, etc., @ $12 per week, $90 00." The enclosing communication ran as follows: "BItlSCOE LETARE, ESQ.: "Dear Sir,-I take the liberty of presenting the account of your late son-in-law, Mr. Allen. Hoping, sir, that it may suit your convenience to assume the payment of this little bill, which I can ill afford to lose, "I remain, yours, &amp;c. "ARNO. R. REFT. ' Richmond, A4pril 4th, 1836."   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       193 This billet dropped from Letare' s hand, and he turned very pale. "Dead!" he muttered.   "Dead?--Late son-in-law? Son-in-law!" he repeated, with a sneering tone, and his eyes flashed fire. "Ha!" and he stamped upon the billet, and spat upon it, belching out a fearful oath. "Pay-pay mo- ney?-me?-I pay money?-Ha!"       He appeared scarcely able to breathe; and Mr. Reft's communication was ground into bits, in the filth and grime of the floor. Some time elapsed before Letare began to recover his composure. " Pay money!-I pay money!-Ha!"    he continued to ejaculate at intervals. The next letter which he opened was from the old minister. It ran: "MR. LETARE: s"Sir, - It becomes my sad duty to announce to you the sud- den and unexpected death of Mr. Clement Allen. He was taken ill on Saturday, the 24th ult., and ceased to breathe on the next Mon- day morning, after a brief, but violent illness. I am at a loss as to how to address you, sir; nor would I do so at all, but that I regard it as a duty. That admirable woman, your wife, often during her lifetime, committed your no less admirable daughter to my care. Her husband, on his dying bed, did the same, with the request, that I would endeavor to heal the unnatural breach which exists between her and yourself, on account of her marriage with him. Shall I bid you, sir, recall to memory your own young feelings, when I request you to forgive her for marrying one whom she loved, though he belonged to a family which her father felt prejudiced against? Shall I plead all the peculiar circumstances which led her to this step; which, in your prejudice, you have not allowed to exert their due influence with you? Shall I delicately refer to your past domestic relations, and tell you that the daughter of such, a woman as your wife was, deserves much- at your hands? Shall I then, as I may with truth, go on to tell you, that this daughter is in every respect worthy of her mother? - No, sir. Could pleading be necessary in such a case, I should fear that it would not avail. But, surely, none other is necessary than your own heart will urge. I presume that I need not inform you, that you have a grand-daughter. She is a most beautiful little girl, just fitted to charm a grand-father; to enliven and animate the darkness and monotony of his life, by the bright- ness of hers. I have, myself, a little grand-child, of about the same 9   X  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7321-00000098"/> 194         EDITH ALLEN; OR, age; and I assure you, that her society is to me an inestimable boon. But, sir, what is necessary for me to do, is only to tell you, briefly, of the circumstances in which I found your daughter, and that find- ing her thus, I have aided and protected her, and brought her to my own house, from among strangers, kind and attentive, it. is true, but upon whom she had no claims. It is only necessary for me to do this, sir-is it not?-to lead you to fly, with all the haste of parental solicitude, to the poor bereaved one, to offer a father's love and care; to forget differences and prejudices; and to solace and comfort her. It is-said, sir, that you have disowned your daughter. Surely, you will hasten to reclaim her now, in this time of her calamity." Here the letter went on to give a detailed account of much that the reader knows, relative to Clement Allen's losses, by the failure of the house with which he was connected; the writer's visit to Richmond; and to the circumstances in which he had found Edith. The old minister touched, also, upon the social duties of man, with peculiar reference to the ties of consanguinity. 4'I have stood," he went on, "by many a death-bed. I never yet witnessed a happy death, where there existed quarrels, and differ- ences, and hard feelings, between the departing and any near rela- tive. I do not pretend to be a prophet, Mr. Letar; yet I dare predict, that your own dying hour will be much happier, if you shall have first been reconciled to your daughter. I trust, sir, that you will take no offence at my free manner of communicating with you. I am a gospel minister, and my habits lead me to speak plainly at all times. There was once a time, when the ministers of God came to a man with the declaration, 'Thus saith the Lord.' With as much solemnity as if I bore an express commandment, I would refer you to-the Bible, and your own conscience, in this matter. Your daugh- ter will not ask much at your hands; for, as you know, she already has, with her inexpensive habits, almost a sufficient support.* "In conclusion, I would again say to you, that your grand-daugh- ter is one of the most beautiful little girls I ever beheld. Come and see her, sir. One look at her sweet face will do your heart good. I remember your honored father. I fancy that I can trace in her some resemblance to him. Come and see whether I am correct. Come, and solace your lovely, but now sadly afflicted daughter; and take your beautiful grand-child to your heart. Whom else have you to love?-whom else have you to cherish, but these? Who else wilU so   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       195 care for you?-wait on you so attentively and kindly?--nurse you so tenderly, if need be?-so lighten, and cheer, and brighten your life? But for such relations, what is life? Believe an old man, who has his own experience, and that of many others, to sustain him, when he tells you, that these afford the only satisfaction to those craving demands of the heart, common to all, for something to love--some- thing to cherish; which, silenced, or unsatisfied, render life a weari- some existence. To exclude such from the heart, is to do a violence to nature, which of necessity brings its own evil reward. Perhaps you never allowed your daughter a place in your affections; perhaps you never sought to win her love. If not-if you have not loved her, nor sought her love-I beg you to do so now. I beg you, as one who feels an interest in you, on account of that inestimable woman who was your wife; on account of your daughter; on your own account, as a fellow-man, I beg you to seek her now, while her heart is wrung with grief; while any unhoped for tenderness on your part, will make a quick and deep impression; and deny yourself no longer the blest interchange of filial and paternal love. For, sir, you have never been a friend to yourself; and you have done your child much wrong." We need extract no more from     this letter. Indeed, we have given nearly the whole of it. It was dated, 7th of April. One would have thought that Briscoe Letar would hardly have perused this epistle, further than to discover its purport. But he did read it through; and looked a second time to those passages which alluded particularly to his grand-child. This appeared, however, to be the extent of the effect which it had upon him; for he quickly flung it aside, and turned to his third letter. This was penned upon a rumpled and dirty sheet; and the hand-writing seemed straggling and careless. Its contents very soon absorbed Letar's attention. It ran as follows: -"April 8th, 1836. "OLD GRIPES: "I say, I have a bone for you to pick-a rich marrow bone. It is not because I fancy you at all, that I come -to you.

I write this on the way, but will be in my den before it reaches you. So, call when it suits you. I had rather you would not write about the matter. "V. H. B." From a muttered oath of Letare, while, a second time, he peruses this epistle, we are informed, that his correspondent is a gambler of Richmond. The reader will readily identify him as the personage who, on a visit to Mr. Brandt, men- tioned before, had introduced himself to that gentleman as Vincent Hawk. Letar, however, only knew him as one of the second-rate gamesters who usually hung around the faro and roulette tables in Richmond; where he was known as "Vincent Bluff." Letare appeared to be very much interested in his commu- nication.- He read it over, perhaps, fifty times, on this and on the ensuing day. Early on the third day after its recep- tion, he walked, some seven or eight miles, to the county seat, to the clerk's office. This walk was a slight matter to him. He frequently walked to Richmond. At the clerk's office, he spent a great portion of the day in looking over the old re- cords. He returned, apparently in more perplexity than he had been; and more than once again, though he already knew it'by memory, referred to the gambler's note. He sat Jong in thought. "Does he know that the agreement was not recorded? How, by any means, can he have come by it?" , r d    SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     197 This last was a question which had often enough recurred to him, in connection with the contents of Bluff's, or Hawk's letter. He had, soon after first reading it, taken from a desk where it had been deposited, a yellow old document, very sim- ilar in appearance to the one which we have seen that Hawk purloined from Mr. Brandt's office, which he examined. He went on now to mutter: "Old Claiborne had the thing; and I always felt sure that it had been recorded. Holmes is' his executor. Is it possible that he can be at the bottom of this? Impossible! Bluff says, too: 'And nobody the wiser.' But he would say anything. He is a poor, unscrupulous wretch, without having, however, wit enough to profit much by his villainy. So, I may manage him easily." He seemed busy in thought. He tore from an old letter a blank page. Upon this, with pale and often diluted ink, he wrote: "Received, real, and at once returned, by "BRISCOE LETARE." In this half sheet he enclosed and sealed Bluff's letter, and directed to "V. H. Bluff, Richmond." He had the whole night to cogitate upon, and weigh the matter in his mind; but the more he thought, the better he appeared satisfied with the plan which he had adopted; and on the morrow the pack- age was forwarded. Three weeks, it perhaps was, after this, Letare was in Rich- mond. Though he did not seem to do so, he purposely threw himself in Bluff's way. "And so, Mr. Letare," said this individual, about half in- toxicated, as he usually was, "And so, you have thought better of my letter and proposal, have you? Come to see what you can do with me-ha!" "I have come to town on business. Your letter and pro- posal were nothing to me. What can have led you to suppose that I would care for the copy of a witnessed and recorded deed?" What! Recorded, is it? Well, well-bless my life!---I had not thought of that. I knew that the thing was wit- ,                  q      &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7321-00000100"/> 198        EDITH ALLEN; OR, nested by old Brandt; but had no idea that it was recorded. I knew, too, that old Brandt was almost gone. He was so sick when I was there that he could not attend to business. But plague take it!-and so, you don't care for it?" "Not a fig! I had rather that it should not be lost; though it makes little difference any way. , But, by the way, Bluff, how did you get hold of it?" "Me?-Oh, that's no concern of yours-that is-I haven't got it. I was only trying to hoax you." "Ah!--And you saw it, I suppose, at Brandt's office?" "Yes, I saw it there-that is-no, I never saw it in my life. Only heard that there was such a paper." "Oh, well," said Letar, " it makes no difference whatever. The thing. is perfectly worthless to me. I would not give a glass of brandy for it. Yes, I would give a glass of brandy rather than it should be lost; for some day I might have to pay-the clerk for a copy; at least, might have the trouble of looking up the old record--you know." "Well, by dads! I'm dry now. I say, treat to brandy punch, and you shall have it."

SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     199 "No, I don't care so much for the liquor, in fact. What I wish is, that you shall pay for it." "Oh, well, come along." But we will leave Letare and his companion for a time. The reference of the latter to Mr. Brandt's ill health calls our attention to- him. Even now, while Hawk is thus speak- ing of the precarious state of his health, the old lawyer was lying on his death-bed. There had been no return of vertigo; but on the occasion on which we saw him last he had, while Hawk was with him, been taken with a singular numbness and chilliness of his extremities; followed, almost immedi- ately, by excessive languor and nausea, so oppressive that his conference with Hawk, relative to some superannuated and originally doubtful claims of his father, old Gideon, was ab- ruptly concluded. As his visitor, having been politely, but hastily gotten rid of, moved on his way along the street, his late acquaintance, Peter, came running, almost breathless, past him. "Where to, now? Where are you going, I say, flunkey?" "Going arter the doctor, sir." "Well, trot, you villain! or your master will die before you get him. Or, may be-stop boy, I say!--May be you would prefer whistling for the doctor, would you? Trot along, I say." When the physician, late that night, left Mr. Brandt, he was a good deal better. So he continued, although very fee- ble, for more than two wkeks, when he was stricken with that direst of all diseases to which humanity is liable, paralysis; of which 'he died, in a few days, the happy death of an hon- est man and a devout Christian. Miss Jemima, who had, by a tremendous effort, borne up until now-for it had been her brother's request that she should do so-and who had with gentle fingers closed his eyes, now sank down in overwhelming grief and wretch- edness. From Mrs. Rutherford, Edith met with all the sympathy and tenderness of a sister. She had drunk of the same cup.  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7321-00000101"/> 200        EDITH ALLEN; OR, She could speak and advise as one who knew. Edith's grief, as we know, was very deep. "No more i" would break from her lips. Not only is this "No more!" the " language of the solemn sea," as a distinguished poet has said; but it is an incessant and a common cry in this poor world; and our sad hearts, like -tuned viols, ring responsive to the pathetic wail. It is nature's continual moan, greeting us from ten thousand points, and the sad, monotonous voice will still be heard, until all nature shall be changed, and time itself shall be no more. Never more! in all the reach of countless ages can every- thing again be just as it now is. Even while we endeavor to seize the thought, infinite change hath taken place; and what was just now the present, has with a mournful dirge-"no more"--swept into the past. It was the lament which the widow's sad heart echoed. "True love/' said a gentle voice; "True, no more hiere- no more now; but there-oh, yes!-there it will be evermore." "Do you think that, after death, we will recognize and be known by our friends who have gone before?" "Oh, doubt it not! Does not the Saviour say that Dives, even from hell, lifted up his eyes and saw Lazarus in Abra- ham's bosom? And shall we not recognize those whom we love? ' "But with the great change which is wrought in them, and will be in us, think you that they will love us?" "Oh, surely. Not, indeed, with the poor, flickering flame of earthly love, certainly; mingled and alloyed as it is with the cares, and frailties, and sorrows of the flesh; but with the pure, ethereal love of angels, of which our souls cannot con- ceive, and which, owing to our earthly blindness, we cannot at all appreciate, or sympathize with, or understand. But, without doubt, all that is good of love, as of everything else, will be found in heaven. 'Love one another' is a reiterated command to the saints on earth. Surely, love will be per- fected in the resurrection. There, it will not be poor mortal's love, but angel's love; for there they {are as the angels of God in heaven.'"   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      201 The, kindness and attention, and, more than all, the sym- pathy of Mrs. Rutherford, could not fail to have an effect upon Edith.   It was, perhaps, however, through her child, the little Amy, that this friend found the most direct way to her heart. The first stunning torpor of her grief being past, Edith very naturally clung closer than ever to her child. Mrs. Rutherford had quickly won this little darling by her kind- ness; and Amy was soon telling her mother, in her broken language, about "Dood Mrs. Wuderfood."   In the genial company of Ros'e, she soon grew as playful as a kitten; con- stantly in motion-almost as constantly prattling in her sweet, childish dialect, which had an irresistible charm about it. There is something marvellously sweet in the "Lisp of children, and their earliest words." Oh, yes, there is a charm in their innocent prattle, both in matter and manner fresh, poetical and touching, at the same time that it is highly amusing, Old Mr. Arthur was the vowed friend of little Amy. Like Rose, she called him "Dwanpa," and, like Rose, she was very familiar with him. With one of them  on either knee, it would have been impossible for an observer to have told which of the two little darlings was his real grandchild. But we were speaking of Mrs. Rutherford. She and her father were ever ready. to associate with Mrs. Allen; to con- verse with her on any topic which seemed most agreeable to her; and they appeared to enjoy her society, though they were both careful not to intrude upon her. Of the old minister's kindness, we are aware. Mrs. Rutherford was his only living child. He had lost two children in infancy, at long intervals between them. Mrs. Rutherford, or Sarah, as she was called at the manse, was the daughter of his old age-born not many years previous to the death of a beloved wife; of whom, it is as well for us to say, that she was a fit partner for him. In character, in kindness of heart, in readiness and constant de- sire to do good, Mrs. Rutherford was much like her father.  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7321-00000102"/> 202        EDITH ALLEN; OR, She was several years older than Edith, being twenty-six or seven years of age; but just in the full ripeness of woman- hood, healthy and fine looking. In personal appearance, it is probable, that she resembled her mother. Old Mr. Arthur, her father, had a fair complexion, and light blue or grey eyes. His daughter was a decided brunette, with very bright black eyes. These last were large and tender, however, in their expression, rather than piercing. She had become a widow very soon after the birth of her little daughter, Rose; who was now a little more than three years old. Personally, and from a direct intercourse with her, she had formerly known very little of Edith. But she had heard a great deal of her. It frequently happens, that we feel as if we were acquainted with some particular persons, whom we have never even seen; and if, by chance, we are brought into close communications and relations with them, we are at once, from the first, ready to yield them all that is due to an established friendship. It was thus that Mrs. Rutherford felt toward Edith.   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     203 itaghtr fourteen. EDITH ALLEN, awaking, as she soon began to do, to a sense of the peculiar circumstances of her situation, found herself, not friendless-and for this she was extremely thankful-but penniless, for the time, and involved in debt. With two hun- dred and forty dollars per annum, she and her child could live, certainly; but this allowance reached not beyond her own life; and if she was to die, what would become of poor little Amy? Casting about in her mind, seeking to devise some means, some plan for provision for the future, some em- ployment-for )she felt that she must do, must act-there arose the question, What could she do? She might teach a small school, perhaps. She knew of nothing else which she could do. She thought a great deal over this matter; but her thoughts were all general, and rather vague, until after the death of Mr. Brandt. She thought of Miss Jemima; she thought of the place-which she remembered. If it might be agreeable t -Miss Brandt, the old office could be converted into a school-room. There was no child's school in the vil- lage. Here was a good situation. Perhaps she might be able to make enough to support herself and child; at the same time that she could educate the latter, as she grew older. Something she must do. She felt this continually; and the feeling increased from day to day. Old Mr. Arthur and his daughter insisted that she should remain with them at the manse; that this should be her home. But she felt that she could not do so, in justice either to them or to herself. It very rarely happens that preachers are wealthy. They are,  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7321-00000103"/> 204        EDITH ALLEN; OR, generally, quite the opposite. Mr. Arthur was not an excep- tion in this respect. With his salary, which was good, though not large, when his various labors are considered, he could get along very well; and, indeed, by prudent management and ecomniy, lay up some little for his daughter and grandchild. Old as he was, it could not be calculated that he would be very long spared to them. His son-in-law, Mr. Rutherford, had been a poor young clergyman, who had spent his all in getting an education. He had only just been settled comfortably when he died; of course, leaving nothing for his wife. Upon their charity, Edith felt that she had no claims; and while she was none the less grateful for their kindness, could not think to burden' it farther than was absolutely necessary. Moreover, she felt that she must, if possible, be making some- thing. In the meanwhile, however, while indistinctly weigh-- ing in her mind the plans which arose before her, she still remained with them.  Old Mr. Arthur had expected, and expected but in vain, some reply to his communication to Letare. At length, he resolved to make another application to him. Having some business in his county, he determined to go to Elvy's Hill and see him. But the good old man had his labor for his pains, as they say; for, when he arrived, Letar was not at home; nor could Ned, whom he saw, and who declared that it did him good to see his face there once more, inform him when his master would return. So he rode on to Mr. Holmes', where he intended to spend the night. When^h'e had ad- vanced some distance, he saw before him, and iapproaching him, a man on foot, whom he took to be the person for whom he had been seeking. But Letar, if he it was, suddenly turned off, over a fence, through the wood; nor though he hallooed after him, could he make him hear, or, at least, attend. It struck the old minister from his movements, that Letar purposely avoided him. A conversation with Mr. Holmes led him to the conviction, that it would be perfectly useless for him to trouble himself any further, in endeavoring to gain any aid from Letar for his -^.      '         '     ' s*,   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      205 daughter. Nevertheless, he resolved to hear, if possible, di- rectly from this individual himself. "The very fact that he avoided me, as I cannot but think that he did, shews that the subject on which I wish to speak with him is one which he is afraid of. If he was as decided in disowning his daughter as he once was, would he not, as I hear that he then did, rather have sought an opportunity of declaring his determination?" He thereupon wrote a short note to Letar, asking what he had decided upon relative to the subject of his letter, written and forwarded to him about a month previous? He stated, that he was anxious to know, and had called on him the day before, but was disappointed in not finding him at home. In the course of the succeeding week, he received the following reply, written upon a scrimp and dirty scrap of paper: "DEAKR SIR:         ^"10ay 10th, 1836. "]DEAR SIR: "In reply to yours of the 3d inst., as also of the 7th ult., I have only to say, that, in this last mentioned, you wrote of matters which I do not choose to understand. Sir, I have no daughter! I have no granddaughter! and I intend to have none! Mrs. Allen and her child are strangers to me! nothing more; nor can they be anything more, I assure you. Where they are, and what may be their circum- stances, are facts of the utmost indifference to me. "Yours, respectfully, "BRISCOE LETARE." Here then, indeed, was an end of the matter; such an end as Mr. Brandt and, afterwards, Mr. Holmes, had led him to look for; such an end as he had gradually been forced to an- ticipate, as day after day had passed, and Letard had taken no notice of his letter. Well, it could do no harm to know the worst. For Edith, he knew very well that she, from the very first, had never expected anything better than this. She had never known anything like kindness from her father; and the dreary period of wretchedness which she had spent at Elvy's Hill, with him, after her mother's death, she remembered with a sort of horror, and little wished to have such a time renewed. What could she look or hope for from a father  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7321-00000104"/> 206        EDITH ALLEN; OR, who, from her earliest infancy, had never done her a greater kindness than to leave her alone with her mother? But for her husband's wishes in regard to the matter, no application to him at all would, with her consent, have been made. No. ,It was upon other resources that she must depend; and it was to find, or devise these, that she was endeavoring, whenever- which was almost constantly, now-her future, and that of her beloved child, occupied her thoughts. Even if her father had received her and her littly Amy, and taken them with him to Elvy's Hill, what a life would have been offered to them there I She turned with a shudder from the thought. Upon the very day on which old Mr. Arthur went to call on Letare, this individual had been consulting with a lawyer. It was, perhaps, a sense of shame, on account of the nature of the business in which he had been engaged, as much as anything else, which, as on his return homeward, he recog- nized the reverend old man approaching him, had led him to turn off from the road abruptly; and, when he heard the old preacher actually calling upon him by name, to fly from him, as from an avenger, and conceal himself in the wood. His business will be readily surmised, when it is told, that in the course of a few weeks there was a bill in chancery filed against Mr. Holmes, executor of Leonard Claiborne, deceased, in which Briscoe Letar, complainant, sues for the sum of four thousand dollars, unjustly withheld from him, since the death of his wife; the same being a sum which he, the com- plainant, avers that he, many years since, to wit: on the----- day of--, in the year of our Lord 1809, deposited with the said Leonard Claiborne, paying and delivering it into his hands, as a fund for the maintenance and proper support of Ellen Letar, his, the said plaintiff's, wife. But picking phrases here and there from the bill, would be like to prove a not much shorter process, than to copy the whole plea, for which the reader would probably be by no means thankful. Let it suffice, that Letar states, that the defendant will not deny but that this sum is in his; possession, as executor of Doctor Claiborne; and prays that rendition be made him of   j SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      207 this sum, with interest thereupon, with many complaints of the wrong and injury done him by its detention, both by Dr. Claiborne, and, since his death, by Mr. IIolmes. This bill took Mr. Holmes all-aback, to use a nautical phrase. He at once applied to Mr. Fenley, a lawyer into whose hands all Mr. Brandt's papers, by his request, had been placed. With him, all these were overlooked; the old county records consulted, from 1808-12; Doctor Claiborne's papers searched; as also Mr. Blundell's. All this was done, at Mr. Fenley's suggestion. He supposed that there had been a contract--a written agreement of some sort. "Surely, there must have been-was there not?" Mr. Holmes, however, could not answer this; and the reader need not be informed that all their searching was in vain. Mr. Holmes onlylknew that Doctor Claiborne had been one of the most careless of men, in business matters; and thought it very probable that he had, simply upon a verbal agreement, kept back this sum, upon Letar's marriage with his newly made ward. lie knew that the money was kept back; that it was in the hands of several merchants in Rich- mond, whose bonds for the same he had found among Doctor Claiborne's papers. He knew that Doctor Claiborne had paid over the interest to Edith, since the death of her mother; and he, himself, had, after his death, done the same. "And thus, sir," he concluded, to Mr. Fenley, "the whole affair is in this loose- condition." "And thus, in consequence, my dear sir, you will have to pay some thousand and more dollars of interest, unless some- thing turns'up," answered the lawyer. "One thing is certain. Whether this agreement was ver- bal, or not, the benefit of this allowance extended to Mrs. Al- len; for Doctor Claiborne paid it over to her, and he directed me to do the like. He said nothing to me of a contract, which makes me still more doubtful if there was one. Mrs. Claiborne remembers hearing him say that, Letar objected to its continuance, for his daughter's benefit, or something of the sort; though she does not recollect having heard him say  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7321-00000105"/> !08        EDITH ALLEN; OR, rnything of a contract. Mr. Brandt had something to do with it; and I know that it was he who lent the money to, those gentlemen in whose hands it is."         ' "And I cannot believe, however careless Doctor Claiborne nay have been, that Mr. Brandt would have permitted this matter to have stood merely upon a verbal agreement. The very fact that this suit is thus brought immediately, almost, after his death, has something suspicious about it. And you say that Letare never applied to you for this money until this was brought?" "Never." "I cannot but think that there is some foul play here. My suspicions are aroused; but, then, I cannot see what we are to do, unless, as I said, something shall turn up. The fact that such a man as-Letare brings this suit. However, it is needless to talk of such things, unless we have some better grounds than suspicion to proceed upon." A renewed search was made among Mr. Brandt's papers, in his old office, among his private papers, with the hope of finding something-some memorandum, or entry, or some- thing-which might serve them; but in vain. There was nothing of the sort to be found. In the meantime, while this false and iniquitous claim is thus suddenly set up and progressing, Edith, whose determi- nation to do something for a livelihood it only quickened, had proposed her plan of undertaking a child's school, to Miss Jemima Brandt. The good old lady was startled at the pro- posal. She answered, after some consideration, " that, as far as the house was concerned, it should be at Edith's service." She had thought something of letting the office out to rent; but, owing to its locality and structure, there were serious objections to this. She was not sure that it could be put to a better use than a school-room, provided certain restrictions were imposed.  The principal of these was, that, under no pretences, were the pupils, if Edith could find any, to enter the lot, or cross the landing which led into the house,+ except by express permission. The wood-yard, she said, and the   oZrl-nMrin uF LFJ'E IN VIRGINIA.    209 cow-yard, which lay, the one alongside of, and the other behind, the office, would be ample play ground for the chil- dren; or, if not, why, they must go out upon the common. She said that she liked children well enough; but, then, she liked them in their place. Upon the whole, she was pleased with Edith's plan; and, in fact, the more she thought of it, the better she liked it; and she told old Mr. Arthur, who communicated it to her, at Edith's request, before he went away, that she did not know but, perhaps, she might even be pleased to have a class herself, if the children were good, and Edith had a larger number sent to her than she could well attend to. It was with very much reluctance that the old minister and his daughter entertained the thought of parting with Edith. The knowledge that it would be good for her to have, some constant regular employment, tended, however, in some mea- sure, to reconcile them to the separation, which would, at the worst, be only for a short distance. Old Mr. Arthur inte- rested himself very much for Mrs. Allen, as regarded her school. So, also, did Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, many others. In a short time, a greater number of scholars were engaged for her, and on better terms, than she had at all hoped for. Prepartions were at once made for fitting the lawyer's office for a school-room; that is, benches were procured for seats for the pupils, and tables and desks constructed. Mrs. Allen, and her little daughter, removed to their new home.   It was a comfortable, though by no means a showy building, situated almost within the  heart of Blankville, fronting, as we before said, upon the street. With Miss Jemima   Brandt, whom  Edith, from her very infancy, had known, and loved, and who loved her well, she was like to have an agreeable home. There were pleasant and kind neighbors on every hand. The very next door was Mr. Mercer's. This gentleman had a large family, which, reared thus hard by Miss Brandt, felt, every member of it, almost the interest of relationship in her. It was to his particular care that Mr. Brandt had been in the  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7321-00000106"/> 210        EDITH ALLEN; OR, habit of committing his establishment, and his sister, when he would have to go off to lis courts; and it was to him, with Mr. Johnston, that he had appealed, on his death-bed, to afford her their protection and care. This latter gentleman lived just across the street; was very friendly, and very attentive. During the period of her mother's last illness, and on pre- vious occasions, long ago, when Mrs. Letare's health had been unusually delicate, Miss Jemima, who was very much attached to her, had spent much time at Elvy's Hill. So that she and Edith were perfectly well acquainted with each other. Nor were they much like to disagree. Miss Brandt's forte, next after her talent for nursing the sick, lay in house-keeping. As has been before hinted, her industry was somewhat re- markable; but she was not one of the fussy sort; for, although almost ever moving, she was only intent upon her own business, and meddled very little with others'. Nor did she permit others to interfere with her. Not even her brother, whom she almost worshiped, could venture, with impunity, to busy himself with her affairs. We haye heard of a little circumstance in connection with this, which he used to relate of himself, and which we will repeat: "Upon one occasion, in walking about the lot," said he, "I entered the kitchen. While here, I began to give some directions about matters of which, by the way, I knew very little. I observed that Jemima seemed not the best pleased in the world, with my meddling. Some half hour afterwards, upon going into my office, who should I see there but Je- mima? and with a great heap of law books lying beside her, and one opened in her lap, which she appeared to be study- ing very intently. 'Why, bless my life! I Mima, are you studying law?' I asked her. 'Yes, brother; you seemed dis- posed to take to house-keeping, and I did not know what better I could do.' I never interfered in her department after this; and I never had occasion to do so; for if there was ever anything which did not exactly please me, I had only to men- tion it to her, and it was attended to at once."   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     2" Mrs. Allen knew that Miss Jemima was neat and cleanly, almost to a foible; and. she had many fears as to how little Amy and this lady might be able to accommodate their diverse tastes and habits to each other. But Miss Brandt fell in love with the child at first sight. Old Mr. Arthur declared, that she had done so before, from his description. She called Amy "a little beauty;" and made a pet of her at once. Before the second day was past, after their arrival, the little thing was screaming all through the house, at the top of her voice, for "A' Mima!"-her contraction for "Aunt Je- mima," as Miss Brandt had chosen that she should call her. As to Edith's school-teaching, we do not intend to dwell upon it. Of course, she found it a wearisome, vexatious em- ployment; not nearly so much so, however, as she had feared. Having gotten her comfortably housed, and busily employed, we will turn to inquire into the progress of the wicked law- suit whichPis gathering before us. And here we find ourselves ready to exclaim against Lctar6, the unnatural father, and dishonest man, whose heart the miserable love of money had hardened; whose conscience it had seared. There seemed, indeed, for a time, to be a war going on in his inward man-the last hopeless struggle per- haps; not of paternal love-for of this he was ignorant-but of a sense of justice and honesty. It was of short duration however; and we are by no means sure that we are not grant- ing more than he deserved, in attributing his temporary hesitation to any such motive. It might have been guilty fear alone, which weighed with him for the time, and made him hesitate to prosecute so unjust and fiaudulent a claim. But his hesitation was short-lived; and the more he thought upon the matter, the more eager he grew; and not having so much to occupy him now as formerly, his whole soul fixed upon the prosecution of this iniquitous suit. As the case advanced, and among its papers were depositions filed, and interrogatories, and pleas, founded chiefly upon the probabili- ties of circumstances, and reasoning therefrom; and finally, as a last resort, a bill of interrogatories, which led at once to  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7321-00000107"/> Zil,        EDITH ALLTtN; OR, what the lawyers call {'a craving of oyer," that is, a demand to hear the reading of a certain contract mentioned; which, of course, the defendant was unable to produce-as the case thus advanced, Briscoe Letar felt, perhaps, as a lean and hungry spider does while gloating upon an entangled insect. His actual hatred of Edith grew intense, and a long cherished spite against Doctor Claiborne, which had been, during his life, mingled with fear of him, whetted his inordinate greedi- ness for money. And there was very little doiibt of his success. His legal adviser assured him that there was none; and his opponents had no hope.   They were satisfied that this claim, however unjust it might be, was one which he had, the power to enforce. But the man "who prospereth in his way, and who bringeth wicked devices to pass," doth not do thus without often and many perplexities, and embarrass- ments, and fears.  Letar, in his gloating expectancy, just now, when he had become confident, was shocktl and con- founded by receiving the following communication: "Richmond, August 2nd, 1836. 'And so, Old Gripes, you thought you had done me, did you.? You are a pretty keen hand, that's a fact; and I cannot but admire your game, though played against myself.

"In brotherly love, "V. H. B." Rude as was the style of his letter, Mr. Vincent Hawk wrote a beautiful hand, and his pennmanship was notable. Early in life he had exhibited an extraordinary talent in the use of a pen; and especially in imitating and copying any writing which might be placed before him. This talent, all through his youth, had remained uncultivated; but, of later years, he had practiced it with considerable assiduity, and, certainly, very successfully; for there were few hand-writings which he could not imitate exactly.    It was an art, however, of which he did not care to boast; and, from what we know of him, we doubt whether his motives for cultivating it could bear a very close scrutiny. When he had feloniously pos- sessed himself of the contract bearing Letare's signature, his first business, upon discovering its character, was to take an exact copy of it. His thought was, after imposing the spuri- ouscopy upon Letare-that is, after making      him  pay some little for it, as he hoped from his knowledge of him that he might be able to do--to have still a hold upon this individual, by means of which he might possibly extort money from     himn from time to time.   The whole scheme was arranged before he first wrote to Letare; and he had waited with some anxiety for the result. But Letar6 had, as we have seen, played so shy, and exhibited such k carelessness about the matter, as effectually to deceive Hawk. It was by sheer accident that, being rather more than usually intoxicated, he had given  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7321-00000108"/> 214        EDITH ALLEN; OR, Letare the spurious copy. This person, in receiving the yel- low, and stained, and dimmed document, bearing his well- known signature, and that of Mr. Brandt and Dr. Claiborne, did not dream of doubting its genuineness. He thought that he recognized it at once as the counterpart, or duplicate of one which he himself held; and to which he had looked par- ticularly since the reception of Bluff's letter. And Hawk, himself, at the time, was not aware that he had not given him the original document. We may relate here, incidentally, that as soon as Letar had received the copy, he placed it securely in an inner pocket, and turned at once on his companion: "And now, Mr. Bluff, I wish to know, if you please, sir, how this deed, for which you made me pay, came into your possession?  "But, I say, I don't please, old fell'! It's none of your business." "Well, sir, you were facetious enough to make me pay to get it. Now, allow me to tell you, that if you do not imme- diately refund, I'll take the writing back to old Brandt, let- ting him know in whose possession I found it, as also the particulars of your proposition to me." "Well, do. Take it to him, old fell'! and much good may it do you!" "I shall do so," said Letare, going out. "Stop!-I say, old fell'-stop! I am not afraid of your taking it to Brandt at all; for it's nothing to me what you do with the infernal thing. I didn't know you'd mind paying for the liquor so much. Here's your cursed two bits back, you old scrimp! and may it burn your fingers!" handing him a quarter of a dollar.   '         ?, Hawk purposed destroying that which he believed to be the spurious, copied deed, which was left with him. The pride of art induced him to glance at it. In a twinkling, upon this closer inspection, he perceived that it was the original. Upon making this discovery, he carefully put it away again. Hawk was led to make some inquiries about  t     1,            SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      215 Letare, now and then, as opportunity offered; and to ask sometimes about his daughter. Under the name of Vincent Bluff, he was a sort of decoy to the gaming houses about Richmond; for, unprepossessing as was his personal appear- ance, he had a good many acquaintances among young gentle- men of the country. He avowed that his change of name was owing to a quarrel with his father. He said that the old man had not done very well before he died. He had added Bluff to his name, because he was something of a bluf fel- low, and in honor of his favorite game, which was "bluff." And by this means he would introduce the subject of gaming, as to which he had a number of anecdotes, which he related at discretion, concluding, generally, with a propositibn to walk around to some of the "sporting establishments," and see what luck might do. It chanced that about this time there went to Richmond some young man from the vicinity of Blankville, to whom Mr. Vincent Hawk found means to attach himself, and in company with whom he was, for some days, hanging around the bowling alleys and gaming houses. From him  Hawk learned,in answer to his enquiries, that Letar was said to have brought a suit for the recovery of some money left in trust for his wife. The young man did not knowlthe nature of the claim at all; but Hawk understood it in a moment. It was in consequence of this information, that he now wrote to Letar the letter which we have seen. He waited impa- tiently for an answer; for he now thought that he had gotten him so completely entrapped that it would be utterly out oi his power to escape him. But he waited in vain. Several weeks passed by, and not a word from Letare. Hawk grew out of patience. He wrote to him again. This time he sent him a copy of his former letter, with this addition: "DEARLY BELOVED: "Above I send you the copy of a letter forwarded to your address on the 2nd inst. It is now the 24th of August, three weeks and a day since that time. Sometimes it is very well not to answer letters.

"Yours, finally, 'V. H. B." This missive appeared to have no more effect than the pre- vious one. Three weeks more elapsed, and still nothing from Letar. Mr. Vincent Hawk began to grow quite ireful.  On Saturday night, 15th September, he made his appearance in Blankville, stopping at the same tavern where he had stayed during his previous visit to this place. The next morning the rain was pouring down in torrents. The gambler, having tried in vain to get up "a little game of long cards," had no other resource left him, for beguiling the tedium of the morn- ing, but that of smoking cigars, a full supply of which he seemed to have brought along with him, for he was puffing at   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      217 them continually, and of drinking whiskey and water, a very large quantity of Wvhich he consumed during the morning. He -made it a rule," he told the bar-keeper, "to get about half corned whenever it set in to raining. It was out of the question," he facetiously went on, "when all creation was wet, that he should be dry." With the bar-keeper, who was at first rather annoyed, but, after a time, seemed to be highly pleased with his jocular, free and easy way, and whom he frequently prevailed upon to join him " in a pull at the stuff"-which circumstance, perhaps, had something to do with his change of temper-,--Mr. Hawk held a good deal of conversation. He talked also with many others, who sought the shelter of the public room, and were lounging about the bar. Among these, there was a well-digger--a poor, but hon- est and respectable citizen of the county-who chanced, in passing through the village, to call in here to shelter himself from the rain. Hawk amused himself considerably at this individual's expense; playing upon his name, which was Mouldy; wondering why a well-digger should fear a little water; calling him "' spring lizard," "cold water man," "tee-to-taller," and such other names as his facetious fancy suggested. Mouldy bore his jokes and raillery for sometime very well; but no one likes to have a continual laugh at his expense; and he, after a time, grew angry. This tickled Hawk but the more, until Mouldy, in his wrath, called him a "Richmond rowdy," and threatened, if he said another word to him, " to knock out a few more of his grinders." Hawk upon this flew into a rage. He drew a bowie knife from his breast, and a pistol from his pocket, and made at him. By the interposition of the bar-keeper, however, and others who were present, they were kept apart; and after a little talk, with some explanations from each, peace was concluded; the belligerents shook hands, and, to settle the difference entirely, took a drink together, tipping glasses, and drinking each other's very good health; each being somewhat pleased at the readiness which he had exhibited to enter upon a broil. So this disturbance soon passed over, and Hawk grew even more 10      '  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7321-00000110"/> 218      I  EDITH ALLEN; OR, lively and pleased than he had been before. Among other things, he asked very particularly after Letare; made inqui- ries as to his suit against the executor of his wife's trustee;  whether he was thought likely to succeed, &amp;c. He, himself, spoke in very disparaging terms of Letare; called him "a villainous old scape-gallows," and many other hard names; indeed, he multiplied his epithets of abuse, more especially, when some one hinted at the report, that Letare still gambled secretly. "He game!-he didn't have the spunk to play cross pins on a hat." And as he grew warmtwith the exciting topic, as well as with the very frequent potations which he imbibed, declared, that he knew Letar well; knew him to be an un- scrupulous old wretch; worse than the world took him for. a Yes," he went on, " and the old blood-sucker knows me, too. I am the only man about town who can bridle him. I have got a hold on the old villain. I can bridle him, and ride him, too; and I mean to do it. I say, my visit out here to the country is for that very purpose. I'll ride him 'till his back is sore!"' A good many other like expressions he used. The fact is, that it was a miserably wet, disagreeable day; and Mr. Hawk seemed likely, as it advanced, to carry out his rule, if not to exceed it. But we have nothing to do with his excesses and habits, further than they are connected with our narative. During the afternoon the rain ceased; and the wind blew the clouds in scudding and rolling, sun-tinted and many- colored masses, far away to the east. A little before sunset, Hawk, with the stub end of a cigar, which had been long since extinguished, but at which he, from time to time, sucked vigorously, stuck in the left corner of his mouth, walked, with a somewhat unsteady and doubtful step, down the pavement "to take a little air."  In his progress he, by chance, passed in front of Mr. Brandt's old dwelling, just as his sable acquaintance, Peter, who had been feeding the cow, passed in at the gate. "Hallo! I say, boat-swain!" beckoning with his finger,   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      219 i' You couldn't give us a specimen of your call this evening, could you?-a whistle, you know?"  A sudden thought seemed to strike him, as he was passing on.

Do you hear, you angel of light?" The astonished Peter, who, at his first address, had stood grinning, at a respectful distance, now, as he saw Hawk "tacking," to use a sea phrase, for the gate, instantly disap- peared around the house. lie entered, however, by the back door; and informed Miss Brandt that "somebody" was at the gate wishing to see "somebody, on'business, he say, marm." "Who is he?-and what does he want?" "I b'lieves he's drunk, marm. He say, he want to see somebody on 'tic'lar business." "A drunken man! Dear me! Well, go tell him, quickly, that we cannot admit him-that we cannot see visitors on Sunday; and take care that you are polite to him-do you mind?-and if he does not go away, run through to Mr. Mercer's, and tell him to come here immediately." Peter obeyed her, passing out at the front door, which was immediately bolted behind him, with no little reluctance; which was increased by his mistress' evident trepidation. Hawk was still at the gate, sucking, with loudc smacking lips, at his cigar. "Can't see company! I say, boy-my respects-and I ain't a caring!" as, letting go the gate, he passed reeling on his way, with many muttered curses hissing out beside his cigar. "Who can he be, Peter?" asked Miss Jemima, after he had passed on down the street. "I den know, marm. Mighty funny man! Come to see Marsher onct." "C(ome. to see him! an old client, perhaps!

As the most convenient method of making known the events of the next day, we copy from one of the Richmond newspapers of the next week the following: "HORRIBLE OUTRAGE!-DOUBLE HOMICIDE!!-We extract the sub- joined from the Blankville-Recorder of last Wednesday: "'Double Murder! Shocking Enormity!-On Saturday last, by the Richmond mail-coach, there came to our village a young man, calling himself Hawk-Vincent Hawk. We have reason to believe, how- ever, this is an assumed name, and that this demon in human shape is no other than a certain Vincent Bluff, well known among the blacklegs and lower class rowdies and gamblers about Richmond. He spent the Sabbath in drinking and quarreling, at the Eagle Tavern. His behavior here was so obstreperous, that Mr. Rellys, the barkeeper, in the absence of Mr. Klinwell, the proprietor, thought more than once of ordering him off from the establishment. Among other misdemeanors, he chose to pick a quarrel with a cer- tain David Mouldy, a poor, but honest and industrious county-man, who chanced to enter the hotel, in seeking shelter from the rain. Upon some slight reply, by Mouldy, to many insulting expressions which Hawk, or Bluff, heaped upon him, evidently with a desire to pick a quarrel with him, the monster rushed upon him with bowie- knife and pistols; and it was with great difficulty that he could be restrained from murdering the inoffensive poor man upon the spot. By the timely interposition of Mr. Rellys, and others who were present, they were kept apart; and after awhile the difficulty was apparently made up. Not so, however, for on the morning of the next day, near noon, a surveying party, among whom were Messrs. Lumley, Warden, Edmondston, Glen, Wm. Grafton, Geo. Willard, and Sydney Cook, chanced to cross a plantation road leading from Mr.   SKETCHE OP LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       221 Lumley's residence, 'Lohgstowe, through the lands of Briscoe Letare, to the public highway, when a pistol shot attracted their attention, and looling, they baw a man rushing upon another with a raised weapon, which they supposed to be a bowie-knife, with which, before their shouts could arrest his purpose, he struck him down. Upon their approach, the villain took to his heels through the woods. When they reached the spot, they discovered that the V  person whom they had seen fall was David Mouldy, while, horribile dictu! close beside him was lying the lifeless but still warm body -of Briscoe Letar! Mouldy had been shot in the right shoulder, and his left arm was broken and cut nearly off, while endeavoring to ward off the knife, which, passing by had entered his body just below the ribs, cutting its way, diagonally, almost through it, inflict- ing a most ghastly, horrible wound. He was also stabbed through the chest. Hie only lived long enough to name his murderer dis- tinctly, in reply to the queries which were made to him. Letare it was afterwards discovered, had been shot through the chest, doubt- less, by the same hand. Neither he nor Mouldy was armed. Cook, Willard, and Grafton, accompanied by Mr. Warden and Mr. Henry Lumley, who had come up with them since the occurrence, instantly went off in pursuit of the murderer. A son of Mr. Woodson, who was with the party, happily had with him his gun, and hounds. These were immediately set on the villain's track, and soon brought him to bay, in a marsh near the base of a hill upon which Letar'8s house is situated. He wounded several of the dogs, and seemed disposed to fight it out to the last. Young Mr. Lumley, however, having leveled the gun at him, ordered him to lay aside his arms, which, after a moment's consideration, he did; giving himself up. He was quickly secured.  Concerning the murder, or murders, he doggedly refuses to say a word. Mr. John Lumley and Mr. Ed- mondston had remained upon the spot where these bloody deeds were committed. A servant was dispatched, upon the horse of the latter, to-coroner Baily, who, with a large number of our townsmen, hur- ried to the scene. Tracks were discovered behind a cedar thicket, a close, natural hedge, at the head of a ravine or gully, within a few feet of where Letare lay, which corresponded exactly with Hawk's; and it is supposed, from appearances, that he here lay in wait for his victims. More in our next.' "Our friend of the Recorder," (the Richmond paper goes on to say,) "is correct in identifying Hawk with Bluff. This latter is, however, the assumed name-the former the real.

We learn from private authority, that expres- sions were made use of by Hawk, at the hotel, on Sunday, which led to the belief that a quarrel, or at least bad feeling, has existed between himself and Letare; and that no doubt is entertained but that this latter fell by his hand, as well as AMouldy. The villain must have waylaid them, or taken some singular advantage, or two men would not have thus fallen by his hand, one after the other; more especially, as he is said to-have hald only one pistol, the other being left in his trunk at the hotel." In a later number of the same paper, we find the following: "We learn from the Blankville Recorder, that the villain Hawk, alias Bluff, has been before an examining court, and sent on for further trial. Beyond his plea of 'Not Guilty,' he still sullenly refuses to say a wordl relative to the murder of his two victims." If the inhabitants of Blankvillle, and all in its vicinity, as is easily conceivable, were shocked and horrified by the bloody circumstances detailed in these extracts, what must have been Edith Allen's feelings when she was ifformed of this sudden end of her father! It was dreadful to think that any fellow creature should thus be cut off.  How horrid the thought that it was her father who had thus perished! It is true that he had never cherished her as a parent.    It is true, that she had never felt toward him as a daughter.   But such reflections rather tended to add to and aggravate, than to alle- viate, or abate her dreadful feelings.  We will not dwell upon these, however, further than to remark, that they were simply feelings of unmixed horror, unconnected with any speculations as to the probable advantages   which might accrue to her by his death; and we mention this, because it was the first thought of every one else, as far as regarded her, in connection with the matter. Exaggerated accounts of Letare's wealth had been so long bandied about, that every one believed that it must be enormous.   There was infinite speculation and intense excitement upon the subject. The   ) - SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      223 extent of a well known miser's hoardings; ithe gold which the Gnome has been heretofore secretly and devotedly watch- ing, is calculated, as powerfully as almost anything which can be conceived of, to excite public curiosity; and there is no subject in connection with which so many various and exagge- rated reports are apt to get into circulation. As to Letar, it is true that stories of his having been seen in a gamine house were popular and widely circulated, and had, for a time per- haps, shaken the belief in his wealth; but this was when there was but little prospect that his hoards would, at any time soon, be laid open, or brought into use and circulation; for, as we before hinted, hard fare and a scant diet agreed well with the miser; and he was, from all appearances, like to out-live most of his contemporaries. He was buried beside his wife and child. It was long, very long, since Edith had been at her mother's grave. Often had she thought of visiting the spot, since her sad return from Richmond.  She was here now, with a few friends, to see de- posited in its place, by that mother's grave, the coffin which held the remains of her murdered father.  The pendent branches of willows, planted here when little Bernard was buried, mingled with wild shrubbery, which had now grown around, sassafras, vines and brambles, alone marked the spot; except, upon a near approach, when the snowy white marble slab over her little brother's grave, showed where he had been laid. Every vestige of the enclosure which had once sur- rounded this spot, so sacred in her eyes, was gone. Being upon one of the crowning points of the hill on which the house, at some distance off, was situated, the place, in itself, was a suitable one for a burying ground. Letare had chosen it himself, when his little son died; although, in the sale of Longstowe, the old family burial-place had been reserved. If her father had disowned Edith, our old friend, Ned, had not done so. Hle had been to see Edith many times since she had been residing in Blankville. For her child, the little Amy, he had, from the first, conceived a very great affection. We do not know if Edith considered it a great compliment;  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7321-00000113"/> 224-        EDITH ALLEN ; OR, but Ned certainly-did, when he "clar'd the child was a rale Letar!"  From a remark in- Mrl. Arthur's letter, it seemed  that he had fancied the same thing. But we should mention, on the other hand, that Tea's first exclamation upon seeing her was, that she was a genuine Transmere; and one of the old Stacey negroes insisted, fully as positively, that she was a true Stacey. Years afterwards, when some of her Allen kin saw her, they at once pronounced her to be decidedly an Allen. So much for opinion; but Ned had told his master, that his little grandchild "was a reg'lar beauty! and taint no wonder, for she takes arter the Letare's." Whenever an op- portunity had occurred, Ned had been all along sure to say something to Letare in praise of "Miss Edith."  He had generally been curtly enough rebuffed. But it had seemed to him that this remark about "Miss Edith's child" had been more favorably received; and he frequently repeated it. He usually visited Blankville every Sunday, and was sure to call to see Miss Edith. "Little missis," as he called Amy, had met his friendly advances in a way very gratifying to his feel- ings. A cheap doll, which he had bought for her, made at once a most favorable impression upon her; besides, "Untie Ned" had a very intimate connection, in her mind, with the cherries, strawherries, wild raspberries, whortleberries, etc., which he occasionally gathered and brought her. For Edith, she could not but feel very grateful to this kind old servitor, for his attachment and attention to her and her child. We have been led to speak of this faithful fellow, in this place, because, of all those who had known Letare, Ned was the only one who, to use his own expression, had stuck to him "through thick and thin." He had played' with him as a child, and as a boy; had frolicked with him- in his wild youth; had been at his side in sickness and misfortune; and had, through every change of circumstances and character, been with him, faithful in all. Marster's been a mighty misfortunate man;" was ever his ready excuse, when Letare's miserly propensities were sneered at in his hearing; "' and there ain't no tellin' what misfortunes   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       225 will bring a man to. I knows when Marce Briscoe was jest as free as water. Ax him fur a quarter, and he give you a dollar. Money, sir?  Money wan't no objec' wid him, in them days. It fiewed jest same like chaff do when de win' blows." It was her friend, old Mr. Arthur, who chanced to be at Mr. Holmes' when he heard of Letare's murder, who had has- tened to Edith, and, as gently as he could, broke the news to her. To those now gathered there, at!Elvy's Hill, to the burial, more through curiosity than any thing else, he preached a short, impressive sermon. He alluded not at all to the character of the deceased, and spoke of his sudden death only as one to which every descendant of Adam is liable, whether he fall by the violence of man, or be stricken by dis- ease. It is not our purpose to dwell upon this scene, nor to linger at the grave-yard grown into a wilderness. We were speaking of Ned. He, poor fellow! had been immeasurably and indescribably shocked at the news of his master's death. He had watched by his body during the whole night, and now aided in committing it to the grave. The depth and sincerity of his grief none could doubt. He was truly attached to his master. Was it that he dwelt upon the past; on those wild young years, when Letare "was free as water?"   Or was there, possibly, something behind, hidden from view, in Le- tare's character, under his miserly stinginess; something under his hardness and falseness of heart, which the world knew not of, and that we have been unable to discover, that made this faithful friend still cling to him, and love him, even to the grave; -and thus sadly and silently, but none the less deeply, mourn his loss? It may have been-as we have now followed him -down to the grave, we say it-that there was something about Letar--dim relics of the past, hardly dis- cernible-that the world knew nothing of. One thing is cer- tain, that he was always comparatively kind to Ned; that he treated him as well as he did himself, in most respects; and that Ned could approach him always, and speak to him as no other person could do.  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7321-00000114"/> 226        EDITH ALLEN; OR, And now, our Edith promises to become a wealthy young widow. But let us first consider her person. Edith Allen looked younger than she really was. From her appearance one might have taken her to be not more than eighteen. Since her husband's death, she was much too pale, and rather thin. Her health, however, was good; and since the com- mencement of her school, she was rapidly improving in comeliness.' Not to attempt a description of her surpassing loveliness, we may say she was very fair; her skin being of porcelain transparency and contexture. She was-tall, and not stately, but graceful in form, and graceful in every movement. We have mentioned that her natural disposition was gay and cheerful; and this had formerly shone in her countenance. But peculiar circumstances had, all her life, been tending to subdue her natural spirits; and a shade of melancholy was now settled on her sweet-face. Yet, there was no morbid dis- tress in her countenance; nothing that would impress the beholder with pain. Her's was rather a softened sorrow, a twilight gloom, which awakened gentle and tender sympathy. Her beauty, doubtless, had much to do with this. Grief, under all circumstances, deserves and commands respect; beauty in grief does more-it inspires with tenderness. Of her wealth, our narrative will show what answer we have to this part of the question. Mr. Holmes, Mr. Warden, and Mr. Henry Lumley, with others of the neighbors who had hurried to Elvy's Hill as the report spread that its owner was murdered, sat up during the night with Letare's body. Mouldy's remains had been con- signed to some of his relatives, who lived not far from Blank- ville. By Mr. Holmes' advice, Mr. Fenley, on Edith's part, and Mr. Jeningston, Letare's lawyer, on the evening of the next day, when the burial was over, commenced an examina- tion into the condition of the affairs of the deceased. Mr. Holmes, to whom, as Dr. Claiborne's representative, Edith looked as her protector and friend, in loco tutoris, aided and assisted them. 'The condition of these affairs was-ttterly un- known, and there was no little curiosity manifested to find out   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      227 how much Letar', in a course of earnest, and, as was generally supposed, very successful toil, and long years of scantiness and parsimony, had been able to accumulate. Surmises as to the probable amount had long ranged, about Blankville and its vicinity, at sums from fifty or seventy-five thousand, to one hundred and fifty and two hundred thousand dollars; the width of which range will give a very good idea of the little that was known about the matter. It was well known that old Blundell had left a large amount of property to the Jones' and their children; and he had always insisted that Letar had made much more in their speculations than himself. Blundell, however, was a wealthy man before they had en- tered into partnership. When Letare's corpse was brought home, the house had been found locked. The key was upon his person. Since this time, only one room had been occu- pied. Indeed, as there were many persons passing about, all the others had been kept closely locked. Upon the present occasion, these scantily furnished apartments were explored. A broken chair, or two, or a cranked, worm-eaten table, or some other articles equally valueless, were the most they were found to contain, except masses of dust and the broken plas- ter from the walls and ceiling, which covered the floor. One of the rooms upon the first floor had been long used as a sort of store-room, where Ned preserved the products of the little farm; for all the usual offices of a farm-yard were here dilap- idated and decayed. The house itself consisted of two parts. In the one were two enormous stacks of chimneyi, jutting into the rooms and almost filling them, each containing suffi- cient material to construct a half dozen modern chimneys of the same height. In this portion of the house there were four rooms besides the cellars, and a passage opening through it. This passage led into the entry of the other house, which was lighter and of later construction, consisting of only two rooms, the one over the other, with an end chimney. The lower of these two rooms had formerly been Edith's chamber. The upper, to which a flight of stairs in the entry led, was the one in which her father at that day spent most of his  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7321-00000115"/> 228        EDITH ALLEN; OR, time, when at home. He had, however, long since gone over to the old house, as it was called; fixing his quarters still in an upper room-the room over the one which had been con- verted into a store-room. We make these remarks while the lawyers and examining party are going over the house. A At length, having looked into the other rooms, more for -form's sake than any other motive, they came to his bed chamber, where they expected to find his hoards and stores of treasure. The door of this apartment was locked; nor could they any where discover the key. After much fruitless search for it, it was concluded at last that the door should be forced. This was easily effected, as the hinges were old and decayed with rust and long usage. The furniture of this room, as described to us by one who was present during the search, consisted of one stout, old split-bottomed chair; a rickety pine-wood table, with a drawer; an old desk containing a set of drawers, over which had once been a case for books, which now, however, was wanting; an open box; a common flour barrel, likewise open; and a large old hair trunk. The trunk and barrel were close beside, and the box was partly under, a very rough and coarse slat bedstead, on which was a miserable straw bed, with many nondescript slips -and scraps of covering. The box con- tained, under one or two, bundles of dusty leaf tobacco, only a few worthless old garden-seeds. The trunk was filled with old, entirely worn-out, and cgst-off clothes. In the barrel were found many old worthless papers of every sort, receipts, old letters, some files of newspapers with marks of particular ad- vertisements. The table drawer was locked. As no key could be found, it was broken into. It contained the old let- ter from Mr. Fitzgerald, which the reader,has seen, and the commencement of a will, or testament, bearing date January 12th, 1812, in which the writer bequeathed all his property to his son, Bernard Letar; but the specification of this pro- perty, together with the signature, was torn off. "Where did your master keep all his money, old horse?" asked some one of Ned, who accompanied them in their search.   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       229 "I den know, sir. I 'spects he kep' it in the bank, ef he had any." "If he had any! Why, don't every body know that he was rich as cream?" "Folks always said so, sir; but marstcr always 'clar'd, hceself, how he was poor as Job's tuckey." "Oh, yes; but who believed him?" This passed while they were opening the desk, which was locked, and, for want of a key, had to be forced. In it they found, neatly tied together, some three or four bonds for small amounts, of from twenty to fifty dollars, recently assigned to Briscoe Letare by a house in Richmond, on different country gentlemen; a list of notes negotiable and payable at the Farmers Bank, all but two of which were marked "taken up." These two would become due in about a week's time- the one for eighty, the other for a hundred and twenty dol- lars-from mercantile houses in Richmond. In a small pigeon hole of the desk there was also found, wrapped in two differ- ent papers vel!y carefully, a note of the "Farmers Bank" for five dollars. 'The drawers under the desk, each closely locked, were opened. And here was something to make the curi- ous marvel. These drawers, which were six in number, four large and two of them smaller, contained nothing but curious little bits of wood, very thin, and very smooth, with letters upon them. All of the same character, or denomination; that is, all which had the same letter, were together in a separate drawer. These singular little bits of wood were very' thin and small, and there was an immense number of them. The letters were the. first six of the alphabet. In the smaller drawers, these little chips of polished wood had yet other marks upon them. Besides their appropriate, or denomina- tional letters, there were, on the reverse sides, various hiero- glyphics. Most of these little bits, and especially these last, in the smaller drawers, had the appearance of having been much handled. Some were, however, evidently much newer than others. The searchers for the miser's treasures began to stare upon this discovery.  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7321-00000116"/> 230   i     EDITH ALLEN; OR, "Now, what in the name of sense is all this?" "'These singular little chips must be representatives of money," some one presently suggested. "Of money? Well, where is it?" Oh, of course, it must be hidden some where," said one. "We all know, well enough, that the old scrimp had money. There's no saying how much.' A renewed search was eagerly commenced. The apartment was entirely overhauled, and every thing in it. Even the old bed was laid open; secret drawers were looked for; the walls of the room searched; the flooring closely scrutinized; other rooms were searched; garrets, closets, and cuddies; indeed, the house was ransacked from cope to cellar.- In one of the cellar rooms Ned had lived for a long time now. Through the other was his usual way of entrance and exit.  He was closely examined. 'But, after this search, in- which it was' evident that he felt much interest, his impression seemed- to be confirmed, that if his ihaster had money any where, ikt must be in the bank. He hoped, he said, that there was some, for Miss Edith's sake, 'And what are those little chips with letters on them, do you know?" "No, sir. P'se been a studyin' ever sence I seed em, to try and make out what they ken be; but I can't make nuthin un 'em." There were not wanting those uncharitable enough to sus- pect that this poor faithful fellow knew more of his late master's hidden treasures than he chose to reveal.   Mr. Holmes and other gentlemen, however, knew Ned too well to permit this foolish and unjust suspicion to be for a moment entertained. But Ned was closely questioned as to what had been his master's habits; where he usually spent his time; where he walked, and when; for every one now supposed that his money was concealed. On Letars person, in an inner vest pocket, in a leathern purse with a clasp, had been found one English sovereign, and a few bits of silver coin; each, the sovereign especially, wrapped, carefully and separately, in   231 SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA. scraps of paper. Ned replied to their inquiries, that he had spent most of his time in the house, when he was at home; that he walked about the house and yard-sometilues, not often, out to where he was at work in the field. '"But he was always busy a cok'lating" (calculating) "'somethin', and he hardly ever lef' the house fur, 'ccpen' 'twas when he was gwine away somewhar." Some slight search was made around the premises, as Le- tare's tracks were looked for-if, perhaps, he had made any to his "nmoney den"-- we need hardly say, without success. The whole that was found in money, and its equivalent, bonds and notes, amounted to four hundred and thirty four dollars and some eents. Mr. Holmes, in communicating this fact to Edith, asltked whether she knew anything of her father's habits which might possibly lead to the discovery of his money; if he, as some were disposed to suspect, had concealed it. She knew nothing. "Did she know the meaning of those little lettered chips? "No. She had never seen her father with money but upon one sad occasion-soon after her mother's deatl. That, she believed, had just been taken from an iron box, which he used to keep in his own room."e No such box had been discovered. Mr. Holmes asked Ned of this money safe. "Lor! bless you, Marco Holmes, I aint seed it sence ever so long ago. 'Taint been here sence soon artcr Miss Ellen deceasted: not sence marster sole all t'uther furnishurc." "Did he sell it, too?" "I den know, sir.  'spects so, howsomdever, case I aint seed it sence. The man whar bought all the things was in the house a long time, a bargaining and a traffickin'; and next day they was all tooken away, while I was gone to mill. I 'spects Tea, or Zely one, could tell you more 'bout it, sir. They was at home when the things was took away." But neither Tea nor Zelia knew anything about it. The former declared that she "was so distressed when the folks come arter the things, and when they tuck, even down to mis-  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7321-00000117"/> 232        EDITH ALLEN; OR, sis's pianer, and all," that she couldn't tell what they had taken, and what not. Nor did Zelia's memory serve her any better. The belief that Letare had accumulated a large sum of money was so firmly impressed upon the minds of every one, that Mr. RIolmes,;with a party of young men, made a particular and close search of the premises, and of all spots and places around about, where it was thought possible that money could be concealed. The house, too, at Elvy's Hill, was once more searched from cellar to garret. The floors were ripped up in various places; the hearths removed, and every place where it was thought possible that treasure could be concealed was closely examined. There was one young man with this party who believed in the efficacy of a forked hazel wand for discov- ering the locality of the precious metals.  His divinations were soon turned to ridicule, however, when his wand, having led to-no little profitless digging out of doors, thereby shaking any grains of faith which natural superstition might have led his companions to entertain, in 'the virtue of his rod, began, upon entering the house, first to bow at one spot and, when that had been searched, at another; at each place, in short, where this young diviner, himself, suspected that it' was pro- bable the unfound treasure lay. His own credulity or faith in the divining rod remained unshaken. He insisted that his failure here was to be attributed to deep underground currents of water. For the sake of any who may chance to be curious as to the form and use- of this little implement, we will mention, in few words, that the virgula, divinatoria, or divining rod, is simply a small two-pronged branch, or a couple of young branches of a  fruit-bearing tree-the peach dr the hazel, especially the latter is preferred-tied together at one end; the two prongs of which, as nearly of the same size and elasticity as possible, are held firmly, but not too tightly, grasped in the hands, one in each hand, the palms being turned up, while the stub-end of the rod is held in a contrary direction from that in which it originally grew. The hands are separated so as to bring into play the elasticity of the branches, more or less, according   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      233 to their size. Moving steadily along, with this rod thus held before them, diviners declare that, upon passing over a spring or vein of water, or over deposits of metals, the rod is, of it- self, by some secret sympathy or attraction, reversed; the stub or tied end turning and pointing like the hand of a dial. It need scarcely be added, that it is only in the hands of a favored few that this wonderful rod is said to perform its divi- nations. We, ourselves, have never witnessed a successful' experiment; and do not at all vouch for the virtues of the divining rod. The search of this party, though very strict and particular, and though continued for several days, was unavailing. Among Letar.'s papers there was not found either of the letters from Hawk, nor the contract, either the genuine or spurious copy, which we have spoken of. After this regular set search of Mr. Holmes and his party, doubts began to be entertained as to whether Letare had been so rich, after all. It was certain that he had at one time made a great deal of money. It was no less certain that he had been for many years most minutely saving. What, then, had become of his money?  Men knew not what to think. Once more McGlas- son's account of having seen him, late in the night, in a gaming house, paying over a large amount, it was said, was set in motion, with various emendations and amplifications. The wise ones, putting together Hawk's knowledge of Letare, his abuse of him, and his subsequent murder, along with this account of McGlasson, tried to make something of that-and they did make no little-conjuring up many wonderful proba- bilities, which we need not record. It had ever been a sub- ject of much curiosity among his neighbors, as to what it could be which so frequently called Letar off to Richmond. The distance was considerable; and he certainly was too "close-fisted," even had the trouble been nothing, to pay his expenses, however much these, by one shift or another, might be reduced, unless there was some urgent motive impelling him to incur them. There had been many vain conjectures and speculations as to the curious little labeled bits of wood.  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7321-00000118"/> 28:34       EDIT"ALLEN; Olt It was at first taken for granted that these little symbols must represent money. Synthetical ingenuity went further. It was reasoned, that as a miser would certainly prefer looking at and handling his coin itself, rather than anything which merely represented it, it was fair to infer that -his money was stowed away in some secret place, where it was inconvenient for him to have access to it. It was some such reasoning as this which led to the ripping up of hearths, floors, etc., at Elvy's Hill. Failing in this, speculation took another fact into calculation, overlooked before, and went on still another step; assuming that these little symbols stood for money, which was not yet doubted, the circumstance was taken into consideration, that some of these .chips of wood were old, while others were, new, and fresh. It was argued from this, that while his money was placed so as to be beyond his 'reach-that is, not easy of access-yet, it must be concealed where he could and did make additions to it; as these newer and fresher bits of wood indicated. Upon this, dry wells and the like were thought of. ]But there were none such in the vicinity of Elvy's Hill. Acute and keen searchers for hidden treasure turned their attention to hollow trees; and by this searching party, of which we have been speaking, not a few of the old oaks, whose doated and hollow trunks bristled the bluffa around, were felled." These are given as samples of the many speculations indulged in and vainly followed up. But at length, all such efforts failing, and' ingenuity being com- pletely baffled, doubts, as we have said before, began to arise, as to whether Letare really was possessed of any more than the small amount of money which had been found. Some , individual, laughing at the fruitless speculations of others, declared that these little bits of wood, about which so much fuss had been made, and so much excited curiosity indulged in, were nothing more than,a gamester's counters. 'Others struck upon the idea that Letar was a cracked man-" money marnia"--and that these lifttle mysterious symbols repre- sented the fancied treasure of one who had no actual money to hoard. "And what was become of all the money which, (    SKETCI  ES O1' LIFE IN VVIlGINIA.     5 beyond all doubt, he did once make? 'W here were his gains of lon g years?" ,Where? Gone to look for Longstowe, it is probable; and all the money which his father left hilm." And many now wisely asserted that he  had only nade money while in partnership with old ]3lundell; had done nothing since; and had, probably, long ago, gambled away all which he then gathered.  .Iany months elapsed, however, and in truth, mlany years, before there ceased to be some dim impres- sion that Letare had hoarded and effectually concealed a large amount of money    . For Edith  , poor thing! the shock caused by this horrid murder made her quite ill; and though in the course of a fortnight's time, she once more resumed her duties, yet she was in poor health, nervous, pale and sad. For months she ontinued so. All that the good and affectionate Miss Jc- mima. could do, she did for her; actually aiding her in her classes sometimes, when Edith was more than usually feeble. She did more. She prevailed upon Mrs. Iutherford to come and spend some weeks with her; old  Air. Arthur willingly agreeing to make his abode with some of his neighbors in her absence; though he was, himself, very frequently in   i Blankville. It utAhrfort hard benf from the  first, ery much into- rested in Edith's school. Teaching was an occupation in cheered her upon her success; and aided her in every way. which all of Edith's scholars regarded her. ^ How is it, dear Edith, that every body, young and old, loves you so? My chief objection to teaching has ever been a feeling of unwillingness to have a set of poor, innocent lit- tle urchins trembling at my glance; accommodating them- selves to my mood; in other words, making a tyrant of me,  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7321-00000119"/> 236        EDITH ALLEN; onR and looking upon me with fear and dread. How have you won your pupils to love you so? But they are the best children I ever saw; every one of them  good. I little dreamed that such a school could have been gotten up about Blankville. And they do seem to love 'Mrs. Allen' very much; though, as I was saying, every one with whom you have anything to do seems to become attached to you. There must be a charm about it. For my own part, I loved you, even before I ever knew you; and I had not been with you a half hour before I felt as if you whre an old acquaintance." But we must not dwell upon Mrs. Rutherford's affectionate expressions; nor, indeed, need we say more of her visit than that, while it cheered Edith very much, and pleased Miss Je- mima, who loved her both for her father's sake and her own, she was herself so much pleased, that she resolved, as fre- quently as she could, to repeat it. Edith's affairs were placed in the hands of Mr. Holmes. This gentleman was as kind and as attentive to her as Dr. 'Claiborne himself could have been.  At  her request he promised at once to pay off Mr. Reft's account. She was by no means wealthy; but she felt as if she had a right to gratify a  desire which was very near to her heart. It was that her husband's remains should no longer rest among strangers. Mr.,Holmes attended also to this wish. It is enough to say, that there was one more grave added to the three which were already in the now enclosed and newly turfed little burial ground at Elvy's Hill. It was determined that Ned should still reside here. The place would rent for little or nothing--would sell for almost nothing-while in Ned's hands, its produce would be worth as much as he could be hired for. Ned's character was well known; and there were good neighbors on every side who would see that none molested him in his duties. Mr. Holmes proposed, that as Tea was a   seamstress, and employed all her time in making clothes for his other negroes, she should live here with her husband, and thus they could take care of the premises and of each other. Of course Edith was highly pleased with such   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     237 an arrangement. She, herself, wished to go out frequently to Elvy's Hill, and she would like well to have Ned and Tea there. Besides a small pecuniary income (there was more due to her, but she found it very difficult to have it collected,) Miss Jemima had to depend upon the daily hire of the boy Peter, and what Peter's father, old uncle Sam, besides his work at home, was3 able to make in job-work about town. This last was by no means inconsiderable, as he kept a dray and pair of horses. By having Edith with her, however, she was enabled to live much better and far more comfortably than she could have done alone. And now they were relieved from a consid- erable expense, as old uncle Sam laid in an abundant supply of fuel for the winter, from the waste wood, of which theye was plenty for all of their purposes at Elvy's Hill. Ned was preparing, too, to fix up the, old garden, and promised that they should have "'bundance of vegetables and fowls next spring." And we may mention that, as an earnest of what he would do, he brought over to them, at Christmas, a fine, fat young pig, well butchered. "Marce Holmes," he said, "had set him up to it. He gin me three pigs; and as two was as many as I could well raise thar, he tole me I could have one ready for you by now; and sure 'nough, here he--as fine a shote, as any body'll have for their Christmas-dinner!'" Hawk's trial had been continued until the spring, by the urgent plea of his counsel. They had summoned witnesses from Richmond to prove his character, who were not present. Of course, this was only a ruse to gain time, and so known to be. But, as is usual in such cases--and for many reasons wd say not a word against such delay--"a rule" was entered against these negligent witnesses, and the trial continued. It was understood that his plea would be one of "self-defence." HeI asserted that a quarrel had arisen between him and Letare relative to a suit, which the latter had instituted for the recovery of an allowance to his late wife. A contract, or covenant under seal, to which Letare's name was attached, as  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7321-00000120"/> 238        EDITH Al]LEN; OR, also was Mr. Brandt's and that of some other person, whom he did not know--Mrs. Letar's guardian--had, upon 'a visit to Mr. Brandt's office some months before, gotten into his pos- session, instead of a letter of business which he had written to that gentleman, and had, for, private reasons, wished returned. Mr. Brandt had been taken suddenly ill while he was con- sulting with him, and in the confusion thus creted, the papers had been exchanged, he supposed. That is, the letter in question was not among his papers. This contract was; and he could account for the fact in no other way. He had only discovered this very lately; whereupon he had come again to Blankville, for the purpose of getting his own paper and of returning this; for which he could possibly have no sort of use. He had called upon, Miss Brandt for this pur- pose on Sabbath evening; but was denied admittance. He had heard of Letare's suit, and had thus been led to make harsh remarks about him on that' day at the hotel. He had determined, after thinking the matter over that 'night, to exhibit-not give-the contract to Letare, and thus induce him quietly to withdraw the suit. He said, that he had shewed it to him; and that Letare( not only pronounced it to be a forgery, but, rushing upon him, had violently assaulted him; and that Mouldy, against whom he certainly had naugh't-their little fracas of the day before having only been an idle, drunken broil, which he had forgotten-coming up at this juncture, had immediately joined in the assault upon him. He had thought that they were armed; and as they rushed upon him, when he warned them off, he had first shot Letare. When he fell, and while Mouldy was supporting him, he him- self had run off. He had, fortunately, thought to re-load his pistol; for when, after a moment's thought, he returned to to see if he had hurt Letare imuch, Mouldy immediately arose and made at him more furiously than ever. He fired at him, but imagined that he had missed him, as he still advanced, when he drew his bowie-knife and struck him down. In the terror of the moment, and without reflection, upon hearing a sudden shouting behind him, he had sought to make his   239 SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.        28 escape by flight. Indeed, in the confusion of his mind at the time, he did not knQw but that these were fresh assailants coming against him. Why should he have sought to kill Letare, or Mouldy either?. He would willingly have fled from them, had he been able to do so. Indeed, after firing at. Letare he had sprang over the bushes and run off; but thinlk- ing that Mouldy would not attack him again; or, rather, not thinking at all of anything but the fact that he had shot Letare, he had come back to see if he could render any assist- ance, when, as stated, Mouldy at once renewed his attack. -It was asked where this paper was, of which he had spoken. He did not know. He had lost it in the fight, or afterwards in his flight. Search was made and, sure enough, this con- tract was found not far from the spot where he had been apprehended.  The indignation which was at first excited against Hawk was, as we have seen from the extract from the Blankville Recorder, very great; and public feeling con- demned him utterly. We do not purpose giving an account of his trial. This statement of his gave the first check to the indignation felt against him. It seemed to have a show of plausibility. It was very industriously circulated by his coun- sel. Before the spring came on a re-action in public sentiment took place in his favor. His leading counsel was a skillful old "jury-lawyer;" and upon his trial, Hawk, though found guilty in the indictments, was sentenced to confinement-in the penitentiary for a term of only five years. Hiis lawyer did not appear satisfied even with this; but pleaded earnestly for a new trial; which was refused. \:  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7321-00000121"/> 240        EDITH ALLEN; OR, f Bagter bittit . THE winter had passed by; nothing worthy of particular commemoration having occurred in the external and work-day world of Blankville. Edith was still constantly and pleas. antly engaged with her school. When we -say pleasantly, we mean that she experienced the satisfaction which ever flows from duty earnestly and faithfully discharged; a satisfaction the more enjoyed, inasmuch as it is self-earned, and has the sanction of an approving conscience. This is the best, indeed the only safe antidote to that tandem vit--that wearisome dullness of spirit-that languor of the soul, which' so op- presses our ordinary every-day existence. Win this satisfac- tion-and to win it, one has only to deserve it--and you may bid defiance to ennui. Real sorrow, too, is mitigated by it, and gradually soothed and cheered. It is an unfailing, uni- versal spirit-tonic; and many bodily diseases, also,- yield readily to its happy influences.  But Edith Allen did her duty because it was duty. A train of circumstances which she, herself, could hardly trace back, had been for many years, now leading, now forcing her, to cast her eyes continually " up to the hills from whence help cometh."  Years ago-some   time before her marriage-she had indulged the hope that she was a Christian, though'often- times the fear intruded upon her, that this hope was not well founded. As time passed along, it seemed strange to her that she made no more progress in holiness, situated as she was, with a kind husband, under regular gospel ministrations, in a quiet, happy home, and with ample leisure for reading   SKETCHES -OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     241 and reflection. Why could she not improve these opportuni- ties? Often was it her conclusion, that hers was, perhaps, the hardest heart, the most unimpressible, upon which the grace of God had ever shed its light; that she was truly among the very " uttermost" of those who called upon His name through a crucified Saviour. In a mere metaphysical point of view, it seems strange that one so gentle in disposition, so kind, and, as far as the worldly meaning of the word reaches, so pure in heart and in thought as she was, should long have to think thus of herself; for one would conceive that it would be but a short step with her from conviction to conversion. But human reason, unaided, vainly strives to discern these things. They are a mystery to us. WFe cannot understand the work- ings of the Holy Leaven.  Edith could not understand why it was that, her strivings after God, with her "whole heart," should have only brought her occasional and quickly vanish- ing comfort. At night, for .instance, she would feel "peace, and joy, and the. blessed consolations;" while, in the morn- ing, again, she would awaken cold, immovable, worldly, and full of worldly things. To the world it would seem bthat such a disposition and character as Edith's was naturally nearer to the kingdom of Heaven than the publicans and sinners, who, nevertheless, outstripped her, and were singing the '"songs of Zion."  But He 'who knoweth the heart and tryeth the reins," knoweth through what probation and discipline it is proper that he should call his people; and He had brought her through " the flood of deep waters ;" and gradually, and almost imperceptibly, had " planted her feet upon a rock." That is, she had caught firmly, though humbly, upon the "many exceeding great and precious promises;" especially upon that parting promnise of the blessed Saviour, "And loI I am with you always, even unto the end of the world." Looking up to God through Him who was thus with her ever, she was humbly and zealously striving, not only to be " dili- gent in business," but to "do all to the glory of God;" and with an earnestness of purpose which brought its own reward. During the winter, old Mr. Arthur had preached the fu-  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7321-00000122"/> 242         EDITH ALLEN; OR, neral sermon of an aged Christian of the Blankville congre- gation,.who had died expressing his "trust in God."  This sermon had peculiarly struck Edith, and wrought much in bringing her to the happy trust in Him   from whom all good cometh, of which we have been speaking. The ser- mon was able and eloquent. The old preacher's feelings were unusually aroused. His text was chosen from Ps. xxxvii. 5, 6: "Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass. And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noon-day." During his discourse he had presented in a light somewhat new to Edith, at least they struck with a hitherto unknown force upon her heart, "those exceeding great and precious promises," and dwelt long upon the wonderful love of God for his people, especially exemplified in the death of the Re- deemer. "And for our part, 'Who,' he cried, in the language of Paul, 'Who shall separate us from the love of Christ, who so loved us, and gave himself for us? I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor anigels, nor principalities, nor pow- ers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be abl to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord!' 'I saw," he went on, with his lip quivering, and his raised hand trembling with excitement, 'I saw a vision in my sleep, That gave my spirit strength to sweep A Adown the gulf of time! I saw the last of human mould, - That shall creation's death behold, As Adam saw her prime I The sun's eye had a sickly glare, The earth with age was wan, The skeletons of nations were Around that lonely man! * * * Yet, prophet-like, that lone one stood, r ' "' With dauntless words and high, Which shook the sere leaves from the wood, As if a storm pass'd by! + * *   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       243 I saw him on earth's trembling sod, The darkening universe defy To quench his immortality, Or shake his trust in God!" He paused for a moment, as if gathering back his thoughts with some difficulty.  "And some of you saw, a few days ago, an aged Christian, whose body was already benumbed in death, and whose spirit was just launching upon that dim -gulf between time and eternity, with his latest gasp express his unshaken trust in God."*                . This sermon made a very deep impression upon Edith; not particularly the portion which we have chosen to repeat, but I  the whole tenor of the discourse. As he spoke of the Chris- tian's continual comfort and confidence in God, the words of the old hymn arose before her: ," This is the way I long have sought, And mourned because I found it not." But she did find it at length; she did find this peace and comfort, this abiding faith and trust; and having found it, like Queen Candace's treasurer, she went on her way re- joicing. Edith and Miss Jemima got along admirably together. This good lady, as we said, fell in love with little Amy at first sight. She and this interesting young personage were soon the greatest friends in the world. Indeed, there was but one of two courses left to Miss Brandt. That is, either to quarrel and fall out with this little girl, who followed her about so closely; who would take her keys, and would have a hand i  everything she did, asking all manner of questions, and importunately repeating them until she got an answer, -We once heard the eloquent and distinguished President of Hampden Sydney College, while speaking of "the immortality of the soul," repeat most happily the above lines, culled, and a little altered, from Campbell's "Last Man."  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7321-00000123"/> 244        EDITH ALLEN; OR, which, of course, led to another question; or. she must give up to her, make a complete pet of the little thing, and love her beyond measure, as she did. We have spoken of Miss Jemima as being always indus. trious. But sometimes she went beyond this, and had "busy fits," as the: cook called them. During these, she moved swiftly about, silently, for the most part, or only indistinctly gmuttering to herself, having "no time to talk;" brushing everything that was dusty to make it clean, and everything that was clean to make it cleaner; moving every table a little, and every chair, if only a hair's breadth; wiping the windows and mirrors; touching up and turning her hand to everything. The cook, on such occasions, whether cateeing her mistress' spirit or not we cannot undertake to say, was careful to put the kitchen in "apple-pie order," as .she said; while 'Dilsy," a little house-girl, busied herself as best she could; and Peter, when he was at home, and old uncle Sam, betook them to the wood-yard, or stable, or cow-house, keeping 'as busy and as much out of the way as possible. Now it seemed that upon these particular occasions--and they were not, as we must say, of frequent occurrence; happening only when matters were not managed in the kitchen and offices in a style which met Miss Jemima's approval-little Amy grew more restless and playful, and more curious than at any other time. She clung about Miss Jemima's knees, and   hung to her dress more closely. "Oh, A' Mima-A' Mima! what you do dat for, A' Mima? , Where you dwyne, A' Mima?   Dim me   de teys," (keys;) "lem  me  teep house for you. A' Mima, aint you dood?" Or, if parted from her, the little thing was sure to be making pens and houses with the very chairs which Miss Brandt had just been arranging; or, worse than all, would, perhaps, be found out at the pump, busy as a bee, making mud cakes. The good old lady's patience-and we have seen that, with her peculiarities, she had an admirable command of her temper, at least, as far as its expression in words went-- would sometimes fail her, and, despite her efforts, she would be thrown into a  passion; while "How dare you, you little   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     245 wretch, how dare you do so!" or some other equally hasty and harsh words would break from her lips. Such an expression} with the tone in which it would be uttered, and the accompa- nying look, would startle the little offender. Her face would turn pale, then very red; and the fountain of her tears would be opened. For, joyous as was her general disposition, her tears lay not very deep, and flowed easily if her feelings were hurt. She had a manner of her own of saying between her sobs: CIA' Mimxaaiin't dood!"  "A' Mima ain't doo!" louder and louder each time that it was repeated. "Hush!"Miss Brandt would say. "O, A' Mima ain't dood!" 4"Hush! hush! There, dear-hush!" more and more kindly.  "A' M-ima will be good.  There then! come to me, darling!"-tenderly-"A' Mima will be good. Hush-a-bye! A' Mima's sweet little pet!" Such scenes as this did not occur often, and for the most part the " little pet" did only what Miss Jemima, her con- stant companion, wished; or, at least, readily permitted her to to do. Mrs. Allen kept as close a watch upon Amy as, under the circumstances, she could do; for she saw that the child, though generally easily enough persuaded into measures, was likely to become the mistress of the establishment; the strong minded old lady, to whom even her brother had to succumb, showing an increasing disposition to yield to the -child. It must be acknowledged, however, that Amy was a very good little girl, and though she had a decided "will of her own;" yet, being very affectionate, she readily gave up her pleasures to gratify "dear, dood A'Mima! She rarely exhibited a bad temper. Sometimes, however, she would get into a fret, or "the sulks," when Miss Brandt would not permit Dilsy to play with her, as long as she wished. Miss Jemima usually laughed her out of these. "There, now! she would exclaim, as Amy sat sulky, or crying. "There now! I haven't got any little pet! And Amy hasn't got any A' Mima!" \, \   &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7321-00000124"/> 246        j:bxti ArJBN; OR, "I have!-I will now!- I have!" "Oh, no; I can not be A' Mima for a bad girl; and I won't have a bad girl for my pet, I know! Are you bad.? Let me see. Why, no, indeed! Why, where has that bad girl gone, who was here just now?" "Dun daun 'way! . "Gone away! yes, that she has!" "Amy dood now-ain't she, A' Mima?   Amy ain't bad now. Bad dal done daun!" So much of Miss Jemima and little Amy. About this time, Mrs. Allen, or Edith, as we like better to call her, was one evening much surprised when Dilsy handed in to her a card bearing the name, "Alfred Dier." "The servant from the tavern brought it, marm." In pencil was written the following: "An old friend begs leave to pay his respects to Mrs. Allen this evening, if it will suit her convenience to see him." /. "Mr. Dier!" exclaimed Edith, in surprise.' "Who would have thought it!" An answer was, of course, returned, that Mrs. Allen would be much pleased to see Mr. Dier. It had been long since she had heard of him. Ellie and Helen and Lucy Bentley who had between them, for a good while after Edith's marriage, kept up an irregular correspon- dence with her, which had long ceased, however-had some-' times mentioned him. The last news which she had heard of him, about eighteen months after her marriage, was a melan- choly story, of his having met with a beautiful young lady from the North--Miss Arbuthnot was her name; or some- thing like it-who had gone to Georgia for her health. He had made his addresses to her; and as, under the genial influ- ences of the climate, she had improved wonderfully, and she and others thought 'her health was restored, she had' at length engaged herself to the young Southerner, who from the first had made an agreeable impression upon her, and * peso       upo   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      247 eventually won her heart. She was preparing to return to her Northern home, whither he was soon to follow her, when, in a sudden change of the weather, she contracted a cold. A hemorrhage succeeded; and in a short time, the beautiful Northern girl was laid in a Southern grave. It was said that the blow almost killed her lover; and that he soon after left his native State for Florida, or Texas, or some where. Not only was this mournful story recalled to her now, at the thought of meeting with him; but her own sad loss recurred to her with renewed intensity. Her acquaintance with him had been formed just before her marriage. Indeed, he was the very first person who had ever called her "Mrs. Allen." The words of an old song rushed upon her thought: "Many the changes since last we met! Blushes have brightened-cheeks have been wet; Friends have been scattered, like roses in bloom, Some at the bridal-some at the tomb!" A crowd of many-hued thoughts were teeming upon her memory. Among these there was no consideration as to how soon he might arrive. She remembered how gay and lively he used to be. How might he be now? She remembered how happy she had been during their brief acquaintance. She thought of old Dr. Claiborne; dear, good old friend! of Susie Henshaw, so kind-hearted, and so deeply smitten with "that tiresome boy," at the same time that she was so coquettish and mischievous; of Willie Davidson, her husband's friend. She was thinking of his having accompanied them to Richmond; and the tears were all this time streaming down her cheeks, when a knock at the door first recalled her to the fact that she had made little fitting preparation to'receive a visitor. She heard the door opened; and little Amy, who had been playing in the passage all this while, and who had opened it, asked: "Who you be?" "A good friend of your's, my little lady! Bless me! what a striking likeness! My name is Alfred--Alfred Dier. Now will you tell' me yours?"  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7321-00000125"/> 248        EDITI ATTEN; OR, Amy was answering him, when Edith, who had been wiping her eyes -as fast as she could, came forward to meet him. There stood Mr. Dier. She would at once have recognized him any .where, though he had become more stout and lost entirely the boyish look which had suited so 'well with his playful style of conversation, and light manners, when she had known him before. He appeared taller and much more manly; and if there could not now be said to be some dignity, there was, at least, a fixed look of sobriety and sin- cerity which, while it suited him very well, Edith-her ex- pectations being founded chiefly upon her own personal recol- lections of him-had not looked for. He 'met her with the air of subdued and respectful empressment which we expect in the meeting of old friends, under such circumstances. Perceiving at a glance the probable state of her feelings, he at once assumed a tone of cheerfulness which he, perhaps, little felt himself. After the first usual compliments were over, he told her that he had "arrived on the day before, at Mr. Holmes', where some other of her old friends had made an appointment to meet him : Mr. and Mrs. Henry Bentley, and Mrs. Lucy /Haywood-Lucy Bentley that used to be.   That they had not yet arrived, although more than a week had passed since they had promised to be there; and that he thought of going on to see what had :become of them.  He could not think, however, of leaving the neighborhood without calling upon her, and renewing an acquaintance which had given him so much pleasure during the time which he had once spent with her.  The Bentleys had led him to hope to meet, too, with her old friend, Mrs. Davidson. With her, Edith had, for some years after her marriage, kept up a  very regular correspondence. It had, for a long time, however, been suspended; until within the last year, when   Susie had renewed it; since which ti*e occasional letters had passed between them. Susie had said nothing to her of a probable visit to the neighborhood. On the con- traryr, she had told Edith in her last letter, that she thought of making a tramontane tour this summer.   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA. I     249 Edith, as might well be expected, was somewhat embar- rassed at first, by the peculiar circumstances under which Mr. Dier had come in upon her; having her cheeks all wet, and her eyes red and swollen with weeping. Besides which, although she was dressed neatly-for so she always dressed- yet she had on only her every-day, school-room habiliments, which, of course, were very plain and simple. On this occa- sion she had not had opportunity even to smooth her hair. Now, it is not to be supposed that a young woman, even were she twice a widow, would feel entirely easy in receiving a visitor under such circumstances. As he spoke of these old friends, however, she forgot her embarrassment. She told him that, despite his kind announcement of his visit, he had taken her by surprise; as she had fallen into a train of recol- lections of old friends and old times. But she was none the less pleased to see him. He did not remain long; although Edith pressed him to take tea with them. He stayed long enough, however, to form an acquaintance with little Amy, who had followed him into the sitting room. She happened to have in her hands one of her dolls, with which she had been playing; and he won her affections at once, by promising to send "Miss Dollie" a present. And he fulfilled his promise; for he had not long been gone, when the tavern-boy again made his appearance, having a little painted basket for "Miss Amy Allen, from her friend, A. Dier."  This contained a small roll of muslin--4 nice Swiss muslin;" plenty for several dresses for Miss Dolly. There were also several little blocks of ribbon, of different kinds and colors; and, to crow;0ll, there was a beautiful miniature tea-service. The little girl almost went into ecstasy over her nice presents. From what Mr. Dier had told her, Edith expected that the Bentleys would soon be in the neighborhood.   But Mrs. Holmes, when she met with this lady, informed her that they had changed their plans, postponing their visit, and were now gone, one and all, Mrs. Davidson with them, over the mountains.  They had, she said, written previously to Mr.  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7321-00000126"/> 250         EDITH ALLEN; OR, Dier, to inform him of their new arrangements; but their letter had failed to reach him. That gentleman himself was, probably, with them, wherever they were. He had left Mr. Holmes' to go in search of them on the next day after he had called upon her. Old Mr: Arthur, too, with Mrs. Rutherford and little Rose, had gone "to take a jaunt of a few weeks," over in " the Valley;" where he had relations. Mr. Dier's visit had recalled very vividly to Edith's remem. brance her friends of a happier day.   After Mrs. Holmes had informed her of their tramontane expedition, and when her friends from the manse had gone off thitherward too, she found herself continually thinking of Helen, and Lucy; of Ellie, and Susie; of the old minister, and Mrs. Rutherford wondering if they were enjoying themselves, and fancying to herself, especially when confined in that hot school-room, how pleasant it must be "to snuff the. mountain breeze " of which she had heard and read so much. On- a  very warm evening, some weeks afterwards, when school hours were over, as she sat looking over some periodi- cal whichfMrs. Mercer, who was exceedingly kind to her, had lent her, a letter was brought her with the Charlottesville post- mark. She knew at a glance that it was from Mrs. Ruther- ford, and opened it eagerly. After making   some reference to a former letter, which Edith did not receive until many weeks afterwards, the writer went on to tell her that nothing had occurred worthy of notice until, o'their return, they were once more upon the summit O fithe.:  Ridge.  "The sun was not far above the horizon; the atmosphere was smoky; thus, in some measure, obstructing the vision, but softening down and mellowing the view. The scenery from this point, Rock- fish Gap, I attempted to describe to you before. I shall not attempt it again.  We had stopped upon the highest point. I was gazing with feelings of unutterable and intense admiration upon the deep blue and seemingly level face of.'Old Virginia.' 'An expression of pain from Pa, who was near me, aroused me, and drew my attention.   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.        251 He was gazing back intently, westward, where the broken scenery was much paler; the various mountain chains, whether nearer or farther off, looking almost white in the slanting rays of the red sun. He 'noticed my start, and remarked calmly, though the tears were streaming down his cheeks: 'I am bidding adieu, Sarah, to that beautiful valley! In all human probability, I shall never cross this mountain ridge again.'                  it , For many reasons, as you know, he has loved this 'valley' well. Entering at once into his feelings, I was immediately weeping myself, lost in a complication of emotions, when Rose-who had been more taken with the dwarfed and stunted chestnut trees and black gums, with their variegated leaves, than with the scenery; and, more than all, was delighted with the figure of a horse, which graced the swing- ing sign of the 'Mountain House Tavern,' which stands not far from the very summit of the gap-pulled me by the skirt, crying, 'A car- riage, ma!-two carriages!-and a buggy. Two carriages, and two buggies, ma!' as these vehicles slowly came into sight, winding up the pass from the west. This interruption broke in unpleasantly upon my emotions, which were, at the same time, painful and incom- prehensibly absorbing. Not wishing that strangers should observe them, I turned me away, and was gazing again upon my native East, where, spread before me, was a scene as 'deeply, darkly, beautifully blue,' and as majestic as the ocean itself-for the view was only bounded by the sky--when a familiar voice cried out: 'Why, Mr. Arthur! '-and as I turned--'And Mrs. Rutherford!' Springing from one of the carriages the best way she could, who should I see but Susie Davidson, followed by Ellie Bentley and Mrs. Haywood, your old acquaintances. Mr. Bentley was in one of the buggies, and Mr. Dier, from Georgia, another of your old acquaintances, in the other. A happy meeting you may be sure we had, here upon the mountain top. "The party had been on a visit to the Springs. They were return- ing thus early, because they declared themselves wearied out with the immense crowd of visitors, and because they intended to pay a promised visit to Mr. Holmes this summer and autumn. So you will see them yourself. "It had been several years since I had seen Susie Davidson; and a long time since I had met with Ellie Bentley. They are both look- ing remarkable well; Susie especially, who, to use her own expres- sion, is as plump as a partridge.' You know that Ellie has a little son. Rather a sickly looking little fellow he is, though a pretty boy. Susie's two children--a son, Willie, junior, and her little Mary-are beautiful children, both.

How shall I go on to tell you of what occurred afterwards? Upon our arrival, as some of our party were a little fatigued, we postponed a contemplated visit to the University, and to Monticello, until the next day; and I commenced writing to you as above. Pa interrupted me with a proposal to walk, as the weather was so fine. Susie, with her little boy, as also Rose, who was on her head to see the place, went along. Mr. Bentley and Mr. Dier joined us, and we strolled about sometime. S"Charlottesville is a sweet looking place, whose pride and glory at this time seems to be the 'Square,' which is a sort of plaza in front of the Court-house, facing upon which is a line or block of buildings, at the extremity of which is the hotel where we are staying. A great many persons were out on this lovely evening. We were con- stantly passing companies of ladies, and groups of students from the University, although it is now vacation, distinguishable by their dark grey uniform. Seen from the Court-house, over to which we strolled, these groups of students, and of gayly dressed ladies, presented to a country-woman like myself a very picturesque appearance. Just as we approached our hotel, having crossed the square obliquely, Rose, silly child, lingered behind. She is usually very careful, and I did not now observe her absence from my side, as we were entering a porch filled with strangers. A stage coach came furiously around the corner of the building, which, as I said, is the last of the block the driver blowing a flourish upon his horn. 'Oh, the child! '--'The child!' exclaimed many voices. I looked around. Oh! Edith, dear, can you at all conceive of my  feelings, or could any one, when I turned and saw my little darling down, and almost under the feet of the foremost horses? I can only just remember seeing a tall man standing astride her, who, as it seemed, with a blow, or a push, threw the horses back on their haunches; and that I rushed-towards my child. Indeed, I do not know whether I remember this much myself, or relate it upon the authority of others. The first thing that I  do distinctly remember is, that I was lying in my own room, while Susie, and Ellie, and Lucy, were around me, fanning me and bathing my temples, while my precious little Rose was lying by me, weeping, and my father standing at the foot of the couch gazing most earnestly upon me. When I remembered what was the matter, I clasped my child convulsively to my heart; and no one can tell how fervently thankful I  was that she was spared to me unhurt, though very much frightened; and fully as much, it seemed, at my fainting fit, as at the danger which she had herself incurred. 'And this gentleman who rescued her?  Great will be your surprise, as it was mine, to learn that he is no other than Mr. Richland!

I could not help suspecting, however, that grat- itude had led you into an exaggeration in this; but, really, I do not now think that you said half enough. We hear, in old times, of the gods sometimes taking upon them the human form, anl ih Scripture, of angels taking the similitude of men. This man seems to be a good angel! May Heaven bless and prosper, and may kind angels ever guard him! He and Mr. Bentley were old school- mates and friends. You said there was an air of melancholy about him. No one can be long with him without perceiving this. Mr. Bentley says it is chargeable to the death of an only sister, whom he loved almost to idolizing, and to an unfortunate love affair of his earlier years; the particulars of which I will tell you when we meet. Mr. Bentley and Pa both say that he is, and has been a religious en- thusiast for many years; but both agree that his enthusiasm is of the gentle sort; which has for its object the glory of God and the good of his fellow-men, wholly unmixed with bigotry and fanaticism. He is not a sectarian; feeling a brotherly love to all 'who name the name of Jesus.' Pa says that he has done infinite good in distribu- ting the 'Pilgrim's Progress,' 'Baxter's Call to the Unconverted,' and the various tracts of the American Tract Society. This has been his occupation for some years past. To this he has devoted himself and his fortune, which, Mr. Bentley says, is large. Pa tells me that he is educating a couple of young men for the ministry, who are here at the University--one a Presbyterian, the other a Methodist. "I should, perhaps, have saved all this prattle until I meet with you; which I hope will be in a short time now.

IT was not very long before old Mr. Arthur returned home; and soon afterwards, having some business near Blankville, he brought Mrs. Rutherford along, and left her with Edith and Miss Jemima. "And what is that which you hinted at in your letter of an unfortunate love affair of Mr. Richland," inquired Miss Jemima--in the midst of a world of prattle about the Bent- leys and the mountain trip--who was as much interested in what related to this good man as the others. "irell, a  good many years ago, a poor, but very beautiful girl, a distant connection of Mr. Richland's father, was sud- denly left an orphan, in very needy circumstances. Old Mr. Richland, who was, they say, as kind-hearted as his son, has- tened to her relief. He brought -her home to his house, and bestowed upon her all the kindness of a parent. The present Mr. Richland-Mr. Charles Richland, his son -was, at the time, off at school. When he returned home, he was already prepared, from the accounts which he had received from his sister, Miss Louisa Richland, to bestow upon this new and beautiful inmate of his father's house a brother's love. Struck with her singular beauty, and pitying her forlorn condition he devoted himself to please her-to soothe her sorrows, and render her new home pleasant to her in every way. As may be readily guessed, his love for this' young lady--Emma Sea- ward was her name-soon differed exceedingly from that of a brother. Well, he went back to school, and to college, seeing her only occasionally for the next year or two; yet his heart   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      255 was full of love for this adopted sister. By his father's death, i he was brought home, at length. As he and his sister were now her only relations, who received her as such-though they were not blood-relations; only connections by affinity, and very far removed-she was wholly dependent upon them. "Mr. Bentley says that, though Mr. Richland loved her beyond measure, yet, he was withheld from making his love known to her, by a chivalrous fear of seeming to take advantage of her situation and dependence. His sister, Miss Louisa, accidentally discovered it, however. Miss Louisa her- self had been, for some time, affianced to a young Mr. George Glengyle. She hinted to Emma Seaward of her brother's love for her; and Emma blushingly, but eagerly, received the story; after which, not much time elapsed before she and Mr. Richland were betrothed. "But now, it happened that a distant relative of Miss Sea- ward, who had never shewed her any attention or, heretofore, owned his relationship with her, died and, very unexpectedly to herself and every one, left her his whole property. The hitherto poor girl found herself suddenly the heiress of a fine fortune. "Her love for Charles Richland from this time seemed to abate. He began soon to notice, too, that his dear sister's cheek was growing pale and, thin, and that a care-worn expres- sion was now ever on her countenance. In the bitter heart- burnings which the wavering Emma cost him, he did not perceive that his sister was suffering upon the same rack, until one morning he was awakened with the astounding intelligence, that the faithless, light-of-love Emma had eloped with George Glengyle, his sister's false lover! "Miss Louisa Richland never recovered from the shock which this occasioned her, though she had for sometime fore- seen it. She died, somewhere off in the far South, with con- sumption, it was said, not long afterwards.

When his old friends next heard of him, he had become a religious devotee, and engaged in a private mission among some of the Indian tribes. Isn't it a sorrowful story?" She had scarcely concluded this account of Mr. Richland's unhappy love, when they were surprised by the unannounced entrance of a young man, who introduced himself as Edith's cousin, Edward Stacey. Edith's surprise was soon changed into sorrow; for it was very manifest that he had been keep- ing hours with "boon companions." e informed her tha he had left college, and thought of going to the University the next -session. "The fact was," he said, "that theyhad had a slight blow up at college, and that he and some half dozen others-all good fellows-had been politely invited to leave.  Several of these friends were with him now; he-had left them up town, and they were going to spend some time with him at Stacey Home, until they could hear from their respective governors, or make favor to get back to college." He told Edith that he knew that she was happily fixed here, in her present home; but, as he was her only relative in this part of the country, that he knew of, he had called to offer her a home at the old place. Edith was truly sorry for this poor boy, for she knew him to be naturally a noble fellow, and her husband had felt an unusual degree of interest in him. Both she and the other ladies made some endeavors to persuade him off from his gay companions; at least, to prevail upon him to spend this one night with them-of course without success, for how could he desert his guests? They thought that he was considerably intoxicated. Young Stacey himself, however, had no idea that he was at all affected by what he had drank. He had smoked a cigar and chewed a: bit of orange peeling by way of preparation, before his visit, and did not imagine that any one could possibly suspect that he had been drinking. Indeed, he conceived that, for his part he had conducted himself admi- rably. "  In fact," he said to himself, " they were rather taken with me. It was as much as I  could do to get away from  them.  "   /                  '   SKETCHES OF' LIFE IN VIRlINIA.     257 In about an hour and a half after his departure, old Mr. Arthur came. He had a surprise for them, he said. He had met that poor boy, Ned Stacey, and three or four other youths with him, as foolish as himself; all tipsy, and singing, and huzzaing, and shouting along the road like mad- men; 'and whom," he went on, " do you suppose was with them?" They were utterly at a loss to guess. "Why, no other than our good friend, Mr. Richland!" An exclamation of surprise broke from the ladies. a Mr. Richland!" exclaimed Mrs. Rutherford; u I thought that before this he was in Carolina." "My heart sunk within me," her father went on, " when I saw the condition of these poor, foolish boys; and that Ed- ward Stacey was one of them. Great was my surprise when I saw that Mr. Richland was with them--and my thankful- ness, I may say, and my hope-for if any one can do any thing for them, it is he. Singular being! I wished to speak with him, but young Stacey absolutely overwhelmed me with his maudlin joy at seeing me, and his tipsy politeness. Poor boy! poor boy!--my heart bleeds for him! I invited Mr. Richland to come with me; but he pleaded an engagement with Mr. Stacey. As we parted, he gave me a significant glance. I do hope that he may have some influence with that poor, foolish, foolish boy! He has evidently undertaken it." From Mr. Richland, the conversation turned to the Bent- leys and Mrs. Davidson, and their now daily expected arrival at Mr. Holmes'. " These good friends may very well count upon a warm welcome. But I suppose that they have not a suspicion of the number of hearts they will make glad by their coming. Looking forward to their visit, I have been urging my school- children on, with the promise of a vacation when they come, if their previous progress would justify me in it; and they have been doing remarkably well," Edith said.

As Mr. Richland was in the neighborhood, Edith for some- time expected a visit from him. But he did not call. The faot was, that he had met with Mr. Arthur and Mrs. Ruth- erford at church, and accompanied them home to the manse; where he remained for nearly a week, as they afterwards heard. When Miss Jemima--who was quite anxious to see this wonderful man, about whom she had heard so much- heard of this visit, the bright conjecture at once struck her, that Mr. Richland was, perhaps, smitten with the charms of the lovely Mrs. Rutherford. "Oh, I reckon not!" said Edith. "I cannot see why not. She is a very estimable, and a very handsome lady; and it is certainly no matter of surprise that a gentleman should be pleased with her. "Oh, none whatever. I was not speaking of that. No one admires her more, or thinks more highly of her, than I do. But what I meant wasp that, of course, she has no thought of marrying."      '   , "Not now, perhaps; but there's no saying what she may think, when the matter is proposed to her."s Oh no!   don't suppose that she would think of marry- ing again.                I "Why not?  She is quite young enough, and very sociable in disposition; and, if she has a good offer, I cannot see why She should decline it." Edith was busy with some little scrap of work for Amy's "ccMiss Iollie" and she said nothing. But if Miss Brandt had observed 'er, she would have seen that her face was flushed, and that tears were in her eyes. But Miss Jemima was herself at work, and did not obsere. She pesently went on:          nt      She presently I don't know whether this Mr. Richland would suit Sa- rah or not." A good, long pause, while she bit a thread and threaded her needle. "But, now I think of it, she does seem to love to talk about him very well; which shows that he has made a very good impression." .   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGIN1A.      259 "Her gratitude-nothing else, of course-my dear Miss Jemima!" with considerable emphasis. "Oh, of course; nothing else, yet awhile. I only meant, that she liked him very well-was very grateful to him; and what I thought was, that this good impression, which he has already made, may, perhaps, open a way for him to excite tenderer feelings when she comes to know that he is pleased with her." "But, my dear madam, you are assuming the fact of his being pleased with her, without the slightest ground for doing so," said Edith, much more peremptorily than was common with her. The truth is, that, by very intimate communion with Mrs. Rutherford, during the period of her own extreme affliction, she had, somehow, gotten the idea of this lady's widowhood mingled and connected with her own; and the first mention of the possibility of her marrying again seemed to Edith something like sacrilege. "Without any other grounds, my dear," Miss Brandt replied, " than the fact that he met with her in Charlottes- ville, followed her home, and stayed a week with her." "Say, rather, with her father, whom he has long known and loved, and with whom he has very many feelings in common."  "Well; it may be so, dear. It was only a conjecture on my part, and could do no harm." "It might do harm, were it known that you suspected such a thing."  "But I would never hint it to any other than you; and I mentioned it to you, only as a conjecture. I certainly have no disposition to be raising reports about Sarah, or any one." The subject was dropped. A fortnight more passed by, and the summer was far advanced. Edith found that her pupils had begun to regard that promised vacation as a happy time, which might, possibly, come after a while; but that they had ceased to believe in Mrs. Davidson's visit as an event which was at all probable, and that it was vain to allude to it any longer as a stimulus to unusual exertion.  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7321-00000131"/> 260        E DlITH ALLEN; O,             i But Mrs. Davidson and her cousins, Ellie and Lucy, came at last. When Edith arrived at Mr. Holmes', they all ran out to meet her, and she was completely overwhelmed with kisses and kind greeting. Tears of joy-unmarked by her, however, for her own eyes and heart were full--were stream- ing down Susie's cheeks. "And so, this is the little darling, is it?" seizing little Amy in her arms, and kissing her tenderly, yet warmly. "Come to Aunt Susie, dear-you sweet little thing! You must,call me Aunt Susie; and you must love me, too; do you hear?  And here's your little cousin Willie. Come here Willie, and tell her 'howd'ye.' And you halve another little cousin in the house, named Mary.  And so, Edith, dear, I see you once more! It seemed as though we never were to meet again." The greetings of Ellie and Lucy were hardly less warm; so that Mr. Bentley and Mr. Dier-to say nothing of Mr. and Mrs. Holmes-were thrown almost entirely in the shade. Once more here at this dear old place; once more with these good friends!  This place was more like a home to Edith than any other.  She had been here several times since her return from Richmond;   but now she was with these dear friends once again; and it seemed a  great deal more like home   when Ellie and Susic-not to speak of the others, who, in the heart-pictures which memory frequently drew, were not much less closely connected with it--were present. Some, alas! were missing here. The warm-hearted, good, friendly old .Doctor Claiborne! His hearty laugh, and kind, warm welcome, and his cheerful words, would be heard here no more. Old Mrs. Claiborne, however, was still here; and Mr. Holmes supplied the dear, good old doctor's place as ' well as any one could do. But he, for whose coming she used to look with a blushing expectancy, the lover of her girlhood, alas! who could supply his place! These loved ones, the dear departed, were more missed than on her previous visits to Mr. and Mrs. Holmes. How often are we forced to feel that old times will not come   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      261 back! We may prepare for them, and conjure them; but they will not come. Even when-and very rarely is this the case-but even when there are no missing ones to mourn, we vainly strive, "with all appliances and means to boot," to re- new the joys of old days. Our efforts are futile. Something is wanting; something which can never come again. New pleasures may await us; new joys may arise; and these, in their turn, we may- catch and embalm in our hearts. But we ,do so sadly; with a fond eye to the past; and with a feeling that there is nothing now, and that there is nothing in the coming years, like "Auld Lang Syne." But we will not in- dulge in such reflections. Nor did Edith Allen, except at times when they would rush upon her with a mournful violence. The period of this visit to Mr. Holmes' was a very inte- resting one in her life; though it was chiefly marked by events of ordinary and every-day occurrence. "And so, Helen has not come?"   She was one of the missing ones, who still lived. "No," Lucy answered, "her 'old man' persuaded her that he could not spare her." "And Mr. Davidson, Susie; I hoped to meet with him." "And so you will, dear, soon: That is, I hope so. There is a special court in one of his counties, which he was obliged to attend. But for this, I am by no means sure that you would have seen me quite so soon; for, really, I thought that I had been from home long enough for one while. However, it was Mr. Davidson's fault, and that of these other good -folks, that I was not here in the early part of the summer. Nothing would do but that I must go jostling and jolting over those rough mountain roads, when I had much rather have come here. Not that I did not enjoy my trip very much; for I did-wonderfully." "And will I see Mr. Haywood, too, Lucy?" "Oh, I am in precisely like case with Susie. Mr. Hay- wood practices in the same courts with Mr. Davidson. The abominable; or, I should say, the interminable courts! for  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7321-00000132"/> 262        EDITH Al;EN; OR,               one must not speak too harshy of that by which the "bairnie's bread" comes, I suppose. I hope that you will see him soon." . Little Amy found several play-fellows here: Ellie Holmes, Leonard Bentley, little Willie Davidson, and Nannie Hay- wood. There was a little Mark Haywood,.and, as has been said, a little Mary Davidson; but they were very young. Among her play-fellows, perhaps, we should mention Mr. Dier; for he soon became her favorite and almost constant companion.  She recognized him upon her first arrival; but it was not until the next day that she took courage to tell him, "that Miss Dolhe was very much obliged to him for his beautiful presents to her."  After this, she made herself  I quite free with him, and he appeared to be very much pleased at her familiarity. It happened that on the second day of Edith's visit here at Mr. Holmes', Mr. Henry Lumley called.   So, also, later in the day, did Mr. George Hendrd, a wealthy young gentleman of the county. The first of these gentlemen, in the morning, and the latter in the evening, made the discovery that Mrs. Allen was a marvelously lovely young woman. Now, Edith was certainly looking very well at this time, for she was enjoying very highly her friends' society; but she was not looking so well as she many times did; at least, not so pretty as she did after a  few more days ofrest. Nor was her lovely face by any means a new one to either of these gentlemen; for they had both seen her often enough before. The probability is, that they had heretofore looked upon her as "the     miser's daughter," or, at best, simply as a  poor vil- lage school mistress.  Now, however, they saw her in another light: associating on equal and  easy terms, and  very inti- mately, with those whose acquaintanceship they themselves were proud to claim. Certain it is, that both these gentlemen were wonderfully impressed by her. As they chanced to be intimate, the appreciation of her loveliness by the one, wag soon known to the other; and a very eager and earnest con- test was at once commenced between them for the fair Edith's favor.    SKETCIIES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     263 Soon after her father's death, the possibility of her being very wealthy had, for a time, brought her very much into notice. But as the probability of discovering Let'ar's hidden treasures, if any were in existence, died away, men who had been very fond.of talking of the "lovely young widow," gradually concluded that she was "very pretty, but very poor."  Now, however, when it began to berknown that the wealthy Mr. Hendr6, and the no less wealthy and proud heir of Longstowe, Mr. Henry Lumley, who was a squire among the country youths, were both in love with her, " the widow Allen" at once became a belle.  Numbers of silly men, who had before passed her lightly enough by, as "pretty, but poor," were now ready to run crazy about "the fair school mistress."  There are not a few such block-heads in the, world, who, like some other bipeds, think only "to follow the leader." But we have run on too rapidly. Edith had not been very long at Mr. Holmes', when some mention was made of Mr. Richland. "Oh, the dear, good man!" Susie exclaimed. " You should have seen him, Edith, when he turned those frightful horses! No, you should not; for the sight of little Rose lying there, almost under their feet, has haunted me ever since. And then, to find out who he was, and that it was he who had rescued you and your sweet little girl! Oh, Edith, I wonder that I did not kiss him-the dear, good man !" Edith  mentioned that he was a short time since in the neighborhood; that she did not have the pleasure of meeting with him; but that he had spent some time with old Mr. Arthur, she had heard. Exclamations of surprise broke from all present. Edith, who chanced to be looking at Mr. Bentley when she told this, fancied that she noticed a peculiar expres- sion-a sort of significant smile about his countenance-when he heard it. He saw that she observed him. "Perhaps, as you are the intimate friend of Mrs. Ruther- ford, I should not say a word, or even utter a hint before you, Mrs. Allen; but, then, I believe that you are a friend of  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7321-00000133"/> 261        EDITH ALLEN; OR, Richland, too; and I was smiling at a fancy which-had struck me in Charlottesville. , While there, I thought that friend Charhe was evidently very much pleased with Mrs. Rutherford, and fancied that he would, probably, soon be heard of in this part of the world." When Miss Jemima had expressed this conjecture, Edith had somehow felt shocked at it; she knew not why. And on the present occasion she could not help remarking, with a peculiar emphasis, that she did not think Mrs. Rutherford a person who would marry a second time. Mr. Dier was making squirrels with his handkerchief for the children at the time. As she said this, he stopped sud- denly, listening intently. She was looking another way; but Mrs. Davidson saw him, and caught his eye. Was there something extraordinary in the expression of his countenance? or was there something particular in his thought? He co- lored, and turned away. A bright fancy flashed across Mrs. Susie's mind, and her dark eyes lightened up with a pleased surprise. She met Mr. Dier some hours afterwards in the porch, and remarked, while her countenance beamed with mischief: "Oh, isn't she a jewel, Mr. Dier?" ' Of whom do you speak?" he asked, with surprise. "Of whom do you think?" Mr. Dier looked a little confused, but replied: "Of course, I cannot tell." 'dWell, I will help you. While others are conjecturing about Mr. Richlanid and the pretty Mrs. Rutherford, I am making my own surmises relative to another gentleman and a certain fair friend of mine. Have you any notion, now, of whom I am speaking, Mr. Dier?" He did not appear too well pleased; and, after a moment's thought, replied in a serious tone: "Mrs. Davidson, I will not pretend to misunderstand you. And I will assure you, that I do not, generally, at all mind a little raillery. I believe-I trust--that you are a friend of mine, Mrs. Davidson?  "Certainly, Mr. Dier; certainly, I am. I could not be  i otherwise,"   265 SKETCHES OF LIFE IN -VIRGINIA. ",Well, then, madam, as such, I most earnestly beg and entreat of you, that you will not, by word, hint, look, or any other token, make your suspicions known to any other individual." "In other words, sir, you wish me to relinquish my right to meddle in-in other people's matters. But, sir, I must inform you, that every free-born citizen has dn inalienable right to meddle in love matters; more especially, every female.' , I know your propensity, Mrs. Davidson, to tease others; and I wish, in this case, to extort a restraining promise from you; not, as I intimated, but that I myself could very well bear with your raillery." "You are very candid, indeed, Mr. Dier. I will be as much so, sir. I have no thought of giving you such a promise." "Then, madam, I must at once terminate my visit at this place; for I have no thought to mar the pleasure of Mrs. Allen; and I am sure that, upon the first hint of such a suspicion being made to her, though we are at present on very friendly terms, she will lose her kindly feelings towards me; and-"      C "Don't you believe a word of it, Mr. Dier--don't you believe it, sir. There never was the woman yet, who was offended at the respectful admiration of a gentleman. I mean, of course, provided that circumstances warrant his ad- miration; and that this is not intrusive." "But, as I was going to say, madam, there is one effect which such a suspicion would, in the present case, bring about, namely: a cessation of free, friendly and pleasant intercourse between Mrs. Allen and myself." "Well, Mr. Dier, I will promise this much: that I will neither say nor do anything which will make Edith think at all the less of you. I will go so far, too, as to say to you, that nothing would give me more pleasure than to see a match made up between you; and, as I believe that meddling in match-making invariably does harm, you need fear no inter- 12  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7321-00000134"/> 266        EDITH ALLEN; OR, ference on my part." And, without waiting for a reply, she left him. The next day after this, Susie entered the room where Edith was sitting alone. "Here, love," she said, "I have gathered a couple of boquets; one for you, and one for your old beau, Mr. Dier. It is fitting that you should have choice." "My old beau, indeed! Oh, they are so pretty!" The flowers were chiefly roses; in the collection' and cul- ture of which Mrs. Holmes, as had been her father before her, was very curious and skillful. But the two boquets were made up of very different kinds; though they were nearly equally pretty. It was some time before Edith,who was very fond of flowers, could decide between the two, or, rather, before she ceased to hold them both, admiring first one, then the other. When they together entered the parlor, where Mr. Dier was sitting with Mrs. Holmes, Susie approached the former:  "Here, Mr. Dier, is a bunch of flowers which I gathered for you. Nay, you need not be so thankful"-as he was expressing his sense of her kindness-" some half hour since it was more worthy of your thanks; but Edith has been handling, and looking at, and smelling it, until its freshness is in some degree gone; although I gave her one at the same time, fully as pretty." Mrs. Allen denied that she had at all injured its beauty, though she said that she admired it very much, and had no doubt but that Mr. Dier did the same. Certainly, he admired it extremely-and none the less, we rather suspect, for what Mrs. Susie had told him. After this, when they were alone, Mrs. Davidson constantly spoke of Mr. Dier as Edith's "old beau," or her "admirer." Thus, she would say: "Here, love, is a scrap of poetry which your old beau, Mr. Dier, ad- mires very much; what do you think of it?" or, "Your admirer, Mr. Dier, says so and so." And though Edith would sometimes color up, and make a disclaimer, yet she did not generally appear to pay any attention to the insinuation. When she did, Susie would answer: "Oh, well, love, you ,o   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     267 know that he does admire you. Indeed, it would be strange if he did not; and besides, it is only ourselves who are talk- ing. I would not say so before any one else; and it makes no difference what we say to one another. He's a good fellow,/gnd I always liked him-and none the less for his liking you." If Edith blushed at the name of "beau," and was shocked at the thought that her friend, Mrs. Rutherford might marry again, how must she have felt when Mr. Lumley, or "Mr. Lumley of Longstowe," as 'twas thought that he liked to hear himself called-and Mr. Hendr6; or, to give him equal con- sideration, "Mr. Hendr6 of Rollingdale," as he did not at all object to being styled-began to make demonstrations of attention to her, as they soon did? We say as they soon did, for each of these two gentlemen was afraid of the other, and each sought to gain whatever advantage precedence might afford him in making his admiration evident to the fair object of it. They both grew exceedingly attentive to Mr. Holmes' guests. Strangers visiting the neighborhood should, of course, have respect and courteous civilities paid them by resident gentlemen. They became wonderfully fond of Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, too.  "Ah, madam, your house is so very pleasant a place to visit at, that it is no wonder that one finds himself frequently here. I have come over to-day to bring a little book on Sheep-Rearing, which Mr. Holmes mentioned the other day that he would be pleased to see." So Mr. Lumley would bow himself in. Nor was Mr. Hen- dr6 behind him. With a speech fully as flattering, he had come to show Mrs. Holmes a flower of the wild lily, of the Chandelier species, which he had found growing on the Roll- ingdale lainds, and of which he was speaking to her when last here. The real object of their attraction was, however, very soon manifest enough. "A well matched pair!"Susie would say; "Lumley of Longstowe! (alliteration does something for him;) and Hen- dr6 of Rollingdale! (a very respectable, well-sounding name,  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7321-00000135"/> 208     EDITH ALLEN; OR, as no one can deny.) Huzza for the race! What chance love, would a third stand? Some 'Mr. a-, from Georgia,' for instance?" But Edith did not fancy being teased, even by Susie. Her two suitors, if such they were--and she was slower than every one else to believe it--were not, apparently, likely to find much favor with her.  They were both, however, young gen- tlemen of high standing in society, belonging to respectable families, and of irreproachable character; well educated, and generally considered agreeable; eagerly desirous of ren:dering themselves so to her, which, indeed, saving a little aristocratic pretension, that the world at the same time laughed at and allowed, was the chief, if not only objection which she had towards, them. So she was, of course, obliged to behave civ- illy to them, and, to a certain extent, bear with and receive their attentions. There was one circumstance which would have annoyed Edith somewhat, had she known of it-but she did not- namely: that all the little world of Blankville and its neigh- borhood, were talking of little else than of " the great 'eatch which the widow had made."  Conjecture ran high as to which of the two she would prefer; for it was settled, beyond a doubt, that she would accept one of them; but to decide between the two was the difficulty.   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      269 "'6  aghtr  (igltehn. To turn to Mr. Dier. He had always shown a very decided partiality for Edith, from the moment of his first meeting with her, long ago. He now paid her much attention. This seemed, however, no more than it was natural for him to do. He had always done so.  And there was nothing of that urgent, ^impressive particularity in his attentions, which marked, more or less, every advance of Messrs. Lumley and Hendre.  Mr. Dier, we have said, was changed a good deal from what he used to be; but now and then he would break out into his old spirit of playfulness - especially while he was amusing himself with the children, as he very frequently did. They were all extremely fond of him, especially little Amy. He was, as it appeared, no less pleased with her. He played with her a great deal, and interested and amused her wonder- fully with his numerous stories of what he had seen and heard. It will be seen-when we come, as we presently will, to mention one of those, for the most part, unaccountable coincidences which occur in common life-that he did not do this with a cunning hope to please the mother through her child, but because he was really very much attached to the little girl herself. It is true, that he, perhaps, liked her none the less that she was Edith's child, and bore such a striking resemblance to her. During Edith's stay at, Mr. Holmes', Miss Jemima Brandt came over several times to spend the day. Mr. Dier paid her i very particular attention, being, no doubt, desirous to find out something about her, as she was Edith's constant companion,  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7321-00000136"/> and  the  A' .Mirea" about whom his little friend had so nmuch to say. Miss Brandt had not the remotest suspicion of his partiality for Edith; nor, indeed, had any one, except Mrs. Dtvidson ; or, if they had, they kept it to themselves . But the good old lady was wonderfully pleased with him. The little Amy, doubtless, was a connecting link between them. But perhaps, too, Miss Jemima was not very much accustomed to the particular and polite attention of such an agreeable gentleman. Be this as it may, she was taken with him extremely; and was afterwards heard to declare, that she did not think that she had ever in her life before met with a more pleasant gentleman. When we speak of his being par- ticularly attentive to her, as well as to Edith, we by no means intend to say that, in his conduct towards either, he was for- ward or pretensions, making his attentions conspicuous to themselves or others,  He simply exhibited a modest and respectful, yet earnest wish to please; listened attentively to whatever they said, and allowed himself to be guided readily into the course of their thoughts. Indeed, he had much of this in his behavior toward every one; which is only saying, that he was naturally courteous and obliging. Pompous and showy politeness-that of manner, merely-is certainly better than none at all ;' but Mlr. Dier's was that native suavity of deportment, the politeness of the heart, which finds a real de- light in pleasing and obliging others. This, joined with his natural gayety, and an extensive observation of men and things, made him, of necessity, an agreeable companion. That gayety was now, however, as we before remarked, much sobered down. He had been joked occasionally about Miss Fox.  That 4" young -lady with the divine name "   had, how- ever, long ago, married and  gone off to the Great West, whither so many of Virginia's sons and daughters of every class have wandered. Mr. Dier was a wealthy gentleman, of fine family, amiable and sociable, and in every respect a com- panionable sort of man; very partial to Virginia, where, in- deed, all his "kith and kin"  now lived; and Susie Davidson knew that it would require but little persuasion to induce him    to fix himself here, So it is no wonder that she looked upon him as a suitable partner for her friend Edith. The whole company were one evening in the porch. The sun was set, and Edith and Susie were just returned from the garden, where, they had been 'a to take a run," as the latter said. Susie was now fastening a white rose in the hair of her fiiend, while she cast a mischievous glance on Mr. Dicr, which said, as plainly as words could have done, "now what would you give, sir, to be permitted to take a like liberty with these 'bonnie brown' tresses?"    Indeed, she had a way-a very tantalizing way it was-of fondling       about Edith, and making her mischievous dark eyes say such things to him; for Mrs. Susie had no inconsiderable share of coquetry in her disposition; by which she used, long ago, to,give infinite trouble to that "tiresome boy;" and which she now brought into practice on her friend's account. But some one now exclaimed: "There are two gentlemen coming !" Susie looked up, uttered a cry of joy: "Oh, Mr. David- son !" and flew off to meet her husband, who was alighting from his horse at the gate; taking Edith's comb with her and leaving .her long brown hair to tumble down     in masses over her shoulders and arms, and around her person, a la Mal- abran. "Oh, you are a dear, good fellow, for coming to see me- that you are ! " cried Susie. Mrs. Haywood was not very far behind her; for it was her husband who was with Mr. Davidson. Edith had nothing left her but to retreat to her room. When Susie at length brought her comb to her, she berated her for leaving her so. '" Oh, now, dear, how could I help it ? Mr. Davidson-the dear, good fellow !--took me so by surprise. Besides, I guess it was all for the best. I dare say the sight was worth twenty dollars at least to Mr. Dier. You have no notion, love, how pretty you do look with your hair down so. But fix it up now, dear, and come, let's go and see Willie." It is not to be supposed that Edith could meet with, Mr.  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7321-00000137"/> i . iEDITH ALLEN; O,  Davidson without some emotion. He had been chief brides. man at her wedding; he had been the intimate friend -of her husband; and had gone with them on their happy trip to Richmond. She had calculated upon meeting with him, however, for some time; and though he now took them by surprise, coming unexpectedly, yet she had prepared herself for the meeting. Indeed, much of its pain was past in meeting with his wife and these other friends. But her face flushed and her lips quivered. "Come, darling!" said Susie, kissing her; "I'll call Willie to the passage to meet you."   And she did. Mr. Davidson met her in an exceedingly friendly and affec- tionate manner.   He was considerably changed in appearance; and was now a stout, somewhat florid, yet very fine looking man.     She was soon afterwards introduced to Mr. Haywood, who, with his wife by his side, and his little daughter between his knees, and his little son in his arms, was sitting in the parlor when she entered.   He met. her kindly, declaring that he felt as though   she; were, an old acquaintance; he had heard Mrs. Haywood, -and other friends, speak of her so fre- quently. "Mrs. Davidson," this gentleman      after a  while said addressing Susie; "you were bestowing upon Davidson thanks and praise which I am not disposed to allow that he entirely deserves. In short, I am claiming some of your thanks for bringing him to see you." "Ah, Haywood, my good fellow, yov will find it difficult to make Susie believe such a claim admissible, or well founded. I had delicately concluded to say nothing about the matter; but since you make an unprovoked charge, I    cannot forbear hinting to Mrs. Haywood how  hard I    found it to persuade you that our visit was at all practicable." Susie had herself started to reply to Mr. Haywood's remark;     but as her Willie answered, she stopped, gazing up fondly on his cheerful, manly face. Edith was struck with the deference which she paid him. She friquently had occasion to notice the attention with which    SKiJtC'H'J S O F LiF'tt IN V1U IS1A.  A I A Susie hung upon his words, as if they were the very best that could be used; seeming to think that whatever he did was exactly right; and appearing to be perfectly satisfied and happy when she was by his side. "And this," thought Edith " is the manhood of that 'tiresome boy;'--and this the' happy dependent love of that mischievous coquettish girl." If there ever was a woman who was perfectly certain that she had the very best husband in the world, that woman was Mrs. Susie Davidson. And he, for his part, looked with no less pride upon his happy, merry-hearted, loving wife. We would very willingly see more of Mrs Susie, as a mar- ried woman; but it was while in the company of others, with her dear husband, that she exhibited fewer distinguishing, idiosyncratic points of character. This might not have been the case, perhaps, under other circumstances; that is to say, at her own home, and in her common life: but she had been parted from her husband during most of the summer; and now he had only come on a flying visit, to spend a few days with her, which intervened between two of his courts. During this time, her peculiarities of character were very much merged in the high admiration and .trusting fond- ness which she shewed towards him.  It was observable, however, thiat this was based upon an easy, happy inclination to take things as they happened, and a very evident satisfac- tion with her own lot. The coming of theqe too gentlemen necessarily threw Edith and Mr. Dier Toore exclusively into each other's society. They ;vere on very intimate and friendly terms; they had ever been so; and this did not seem at all disagree- able to either of them. We cannot, however, take it on ourselves to enter much into the particulars of their friendly intercourse; and we must not dwell longer on this visit to Mr. Holmes'. Edith's short holiday was drawing to a close. Mr. David- son and Mr. Haywood had been gone for several days. Their wives expected to follow soon. It was the last day of Edith's stay with these dear friends. She, and Susie, and Mr. Dier  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7321-00000138"/> EDITH ALLEN; OR, were together in the north porch. Susie had her little Mary with her, who was just beginning to walk a little. She was playing with the child, while her nurse was .gone upon an errand, clapping her hands together, and crying out: "Clatch her, catch her, catch her l" while the little thing was toddling along, cackling in high glee. A withered rose-bud hung dangling from Edith's hair where Susie had that morning placed it. Edith loosed it from her hair, and was about to throw it away, when Mr. I)ier reached forward, and taking it from her, pressed it to lips, and placed it in his: bosom. Susie was chasing little Mary across the floor, crying "Catch her, catch her, catch her!" and saw nothing of this little movement. Edith's face turned red as sear!et; and Mr. Dier blushed no little himself.  This was the first actual demonstration which he had ever ventured upon; nor would he naw have dared so nuch--but she was going away this evening. "Catch her, catch hery catch--Oh, mercy! my poor child ! What makes her fall so--to hurt her poor little self?"  It was surprising how both Edith and Mr. Dier were inter. ested about the child, who was not hurt at all--only fright- ened a little. During    the day, Mr. Dier had no further opportunity offered him-even had he wished for it; which it is most probable that he did not--for advancing beyond this step. But he watched very closely to see what effect this liberty which he had taken would have upon Edith's conduct. He fineied, although there was no perceptible diminution of kindness, yet that there was an air of sadness in her manner during the remainder of the day. No doubt, he laid much more stress upon little things, than there was any good occa- sion for; as it is probable that any sadness which she felt was attributable to the fact, that she was so soon to part from these good fiiends, to whom she was so much attached.  But love is always more acute than  wise in finding cause for its hopes and fears in matters which, to other eyes, have no pecu- liar significance.    SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      275 Susie had promised to go home with her friend, and spend the night with her; and Mr. Dier very readily, it will be believed, consented to accompany her. Miss Jemima was very happy at Edith's return; very much pleased to see Susie, and to meet again with Mr Dier. For little Amy, i"How did she reckon, 'A' Mima,' had been doing all this time without her little pet?"  The pet had her own hands full in enter- taining little Mary, whom Susie had brought with her, hav- ing left master Willie, however, with his " aunt Ellie." Their coming had been expected by Miss Jemima; and, to use the cook's expression, everything was " in apple-pie order." There were the cleanest floors, and the whitest hearths; the lightest bread, and the nicest cakes. Indeed, such an air of neat cleanliness pervaded the whole establishment, and such a show of careful housewifery, as must have struck any one. And..this was Edith's home! Mr. Dier thought it one of the sweetest places that he had ever seen. Susie had that day expressed her self-gratulations, that in these last hours which they would have to spend together, neither "Hendre, of Rollingdale,"  nor "Lumley, of Long- stowe," had thought proper to intrude upon them. They had now, however, not been long arrived here at Miss Jemima's- that is, at Edith's own home-when the first named of these gentlemen made his appearance. He," as he told them, "happening to be in the village, and hearing of their arrival, had not been able to resist the inclination to do himself the pleasure of calling upon them at once." His call was untimely and quite unwelcome; but he seemed disposed to lengthen it out. Edith, who was out of patience at his coming and stay, was colder in her hospi- tality and manner than he could have wished her, perhaps. But he still sat, talking away volubly, and appearing to enjoy himself. Among other matters, he at length spoke of Mr. Richland and Mrs. Rutherford.  He told Mrs. Allen that " her friend was about--at least, so report ran-setting a good example to the ladies of her acquaintance; an example which was really needed; for marriages had become of ominously unusual occurrence."  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7321-00000139"/> 276        EDITH ALLEN; ORB Edith replied, that she was under inexpressible obligations to Mr. Richland; that of course she entertained the most friendly feelings and the kindest wishes towards him; but that, really, in this matter, if there was any truth in what was said of his pretensions, she did not, could not, wish him suc- cess. She went on to say with emphasis) and very pointedly: "I have, I am aware, somewhat peculiar notions upon this subject; but I cannot help feeling that there is something like sacrilege in the 'idea of martjryinf a Seco)d tWime. Was Sarah Rutherford an entire stranger to me, or one in whom I had no interest, it is possible that I might feel differently; but, as it is, I cannot bear with patience the thought of her marrying again--even Mr. Richland." She spoke with energy and decision, and directly at Mr. Hendre. That gentleman was,taken considerably by surprise. He was nonplussed; completely silenced. IHe ran his hand through his hair, he twirled his watch-key between his finger and thumb;. looked at his watch. "Really ! upon his word ! time had flown much more rapidly than he had thought;" and he bowed himself out. Susie laughed heartily at his discomfiture.  "A regular repulse! but deserved. By no other' means would we have gotten rid of him to-night."   HIer eye fell on Mr. Dier.  His countenance was indicative of any thing else rather than mer- riment. He was, as we before hinted, weigbing.and watching Edith's every act and word to-day, nicely and narrowly, as bearing   upon and   connected with his pantomimical love- making of the morning; and he now fancied that her very decided remarks had been as much intended for him as for Mr. Hendre: perhaps, more especially, in fact; though she had, for friend-ships salke,  hosen to rebuke his impulsive boldness thus indirectly.  Her words gave a  death-blow to the gentle hopes which had of late beeq swelling in his heart. Susie no sooner noticed his pain and disappointment, which was evident enough, than she kindly came to the rescue. "Heigh-ho ! A    happy riddance of Mr. George Hendr-- which was, doubtless, what was intended by your emphatic speech    ?" .    SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      2" Edith blushingly acknowledged that she had, perhaps, expected that the expression of her sentiments might have some effect. "Your sentiments, dear! But you certainly do not mean to say that such are your real sentiments?") "Indeed, I do; or I would not have uttered them." "Well, you shall admit, at least, that they were highly colored up and exaggerated for a particular purpose?" and she quoted St. Paul, and alluded to the words of the Saviour. "Oh, I know, very well, that there is no actual wrong in marrying a second time; that it is not forbidden. I only spoke of my own feelings on the subject; and I owned that they were peculiar." Mrs. Susie had failed to mend matters, and Mr. Dier could not but feel- that his love was rebuked. Early on the next morning, before the day grew warm, he and- Mrs. Davidson returned to Mr. Holmes'. After a few days more, Edith's good friends left the neighborhood. About a month after this, a tall, plainly but neatly dressed gentleman presented himself to Miss Jemima one day while Edith was in her school-room. From his looks, at a glance, before he introduced himself, she was sure that he was no other than Mr. Richland. Of course, Edith hurried out to see him. She was pleased to meet with him again, and under pleasant circumstances; for hitherto her memory of his benig- nant countenance was connected with a time of bitter grief and terrible fright. She knew him at once; she would, we mean, have known him any where. The mild, earnest expres- sion of his eyes; his high, broad forehead; his calm smile, were not to be forgotten. We have already said more of his personal appearance than we should have done but for the fact that word pictures fall so far short of the original. Now that Edith knew his history, she could better understand his coun- tenance; seeing in its lines, plain enough, traces of those sor- rows of which she had heard. He conversed pleasantly and agreeably, chiefly about their mutual friends, who had been recently in the neighborhood. He had hoped to have met  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7321-00000140"/> 278        M EDITH ALLEN; OR, with them; had gone to Mr. Holmes' with that hope. He took little Amy up on his. knee. She had been all her life accustomed to receive notice from gentlemen, -and was not often shy of such as showed a disposition to pay attention "Do you remember me, little lady?" "No, sir." "Well, I am not sorry that you do not. You will remem- ber me the next time you see me, will you not?" t, Yes, sir." "I brought you something to make you remember me. I expected that by this time you were learning to read pretty books; and, as I came by the book-store, I bought a book for you, which some little girls think is wonderfully pretty. It is in four volumes," he continued, taking from his pocket a little parcel, and untying the paper, in which was wrapped Miss Hannah More's "Cheap Repository."   "It was made by a good lady, and it contains a great many very pretty and very good stories. Can you read them?"  Now, this was a question which bothered little Amy a good deal. She did not wish to refuse to answer a gentleman who was so kind as to bring her such a present; and yet she did not wish to answer, either, here where her mother was. She looked to Miss Jemina in her perplexity. 1" That is a, question," said this good lady, smiling,  " which I must beg     you not to ask, as it is connected with a great secret; the only one which she has, I suppose."' " Oh, I certainly withdraw it, at once. I have no thought- to pry into your secrets, and will not ask you hard questions." Mr. ?  Richland did not remain long, as he was aware that he had called Edith from her school-duties. When he was about to leave, he told her that he expected to go directly to her old friend's, Mr. Arthur's, and should be pleased to fulfill any commands with which she chose to commission him. Little Amy followed him out to the gate. "I  am mightily obliged to you for those pretty books; and I can read."   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      27,' "Ah!" "I can read all but' the long, hard words; but A' Mima and I don't want marmy to know any thing about it until I can read them, 'too." a Oh! what pretty books; and what good, pretty stories; if my little girl only knew how to read them!" cried her mother, ' smiling. Little Amy had kept her secret resolutely for a long time; but there was something in this remark of her mother's which overcame her. "A' Mima, I will tell marmy--I am obliged to-I can't help it!" "Well, tell her, then, dear." "Tell me what? What is it?" "Tell you-that I can read." "What! you read?" "Yes, that I can!" "Oh, you sweet little darling!" cried Edith, clasping her to her heart, and kissing her fondly. "Ma is so glad that she has such a good little daughter! You must let me hear you read some in these pretty books, just as soon as school- hours are over." And thus Edith had begun, once more, her daily duties; at first, with some repugnance at the thought of again enter- ing, and confining herself for long and weary months to that narrow little school-room. The time of rest and enjoyment which she had recently spent, however, had done her service. She 'had acquired a cheerfulness of spirit, and a freshness of health, neither of which she had before known for a long time. Friendship had shed its oil upon her heart, and the rose was blooming upon her cheek again. But her old tasks had been resumed, and she was now settled, unmurmuring, into her accustomed habits. Before this visit of Mr. Richland, she had received one let- ter from her friend, Susie. Very soon after, she received another. We will examine its contents, presently. We have  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7321-00000141"/> 280         EDITH ALLEN; OR, mentioned the coincidence of two neighborhood swains falling in love with Edith at the same time. Little Amy was not less fortunate. During Edith's visit to Mr. Holmes', Miss Brandt being left alone, had much time for reflection. She, of course, in this time, thought much of her little "pet," whom she missed beyond expression. In connection with the little girl, and in her almost maternal anxiety for her welfare, reflections arose upon the uncertainty of the continuance of her own life. She had no near relatives. There were some far off kinsfolk of hers-not very, reputable, by the by-whom she neither knew nor cared for; and who, of course, cared naught for her; who would probably remember the relationship, how- ever, were she to die intestate. So, after much thought, and after postponing it for some time-for Miss Jemima, like many other good people, had some superstitious objections to making her will-she applied to Mr. Fenley to draw up such an instrument for her; in which she bequeathed everything which she possessed to Amy. She said nothing of this, how- ever, to Edith, or to any one. Mrs. Davidson's letter, after telling some other things, sud- denly broke off: "Of, EDITH, dear!-of Mr. Dier-what now do ryou think? You couldn't guess foryour life! I have just heard, as a great secret, from Ellie, that he has gone off on a trip to Europe. No, that is not the secret; but that before he went, he made his will, which he has left with Mr. Bentley; in which he gives all his property-now to whom do you suppose?-Why-to your dear little daughter! Hear- ing of this, dear Edith, and thinking now of it, I cannot help telling yn flatly, that you ought to have married this man. Truly he loves you; and he would most kindly have supplied a father's place to the dear little girl whom he evidently cares so much for. I know that he loves you; and that he would most probably have told you so him- self before leaving the neighborhood, but for SOme remarks of yours- too strong remarks they were, dear Edith; and I regretted them very much at the time; and still regret them-which you made in connec- tion with your friend Mrs. Rutherford. And now this poor fellow has gone off, hopeless and despondent, with all his love for you. Alas  Edith, dear, this is a sad world.   \ SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     281 "Be sure, now, to remember, love, that this is a very great secret. It was not intended that any body but Mr. Bentley and he should know it; so you must not, for any thing, say a word about it. Mr. Bentley might be vexed with Ellie and me, you know, if he was to find out that it had been told; but for my life I could not help tell- ing you of it." This news .took Edith very much by surprise. She knew that Mr. Dier had grown very fond of her little girl- that he had made a great favorite of her. But she had no notion that his favoritism reached so far. The allu- sion of Susie to herself did not offend her; did not shock, or surprise her. When she thought of it, she was surprised that it did not. Mr. Dier's partiality for her-his love for her, if he did love her-was something which she had not at all examined. Indeed, she had resolutely kept her thoughts from it; refused to consider it; endeavoring to deceive herself into the belief that she knew nothing of it; for she rated his friend- ship at tod high a price to be willing to have it sacrificed, or at best chilled, as she fancied that her duty would require that it should be, if she ever admitted th herself that he was any- thing more than a friend. The portion of Susie's letter which we have transcribed gave rise, both at the time of its reception and often enough afterwards during those long, wearisome school-hours, to much reflection. She agreed with the melan- choly conclusion of her friend: "Alas! this is a sad world!" She thought. much of Mr. Dier.  She thought of his lost love, Mary Arbuthnot.  And did he now love her?   To be unhappy in love, was not the fate which she would, long ago, have thought awaited that gay, sprightly young Southerner; who had ever held a bright place in her memory. Nor was it a fitting fate for that still cheerful, kind-hearted, agreeable, and very attentive criend, with whom she bad lately been associating; and who, she could not but agree with Miss Jemima, was one of the pleasantest personages with whom she had ever met-that friend, who had ever sought her side when there was room for him; and ever, with a quiet, unobtrusive admiration, shewn that he was pleased  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7321-00000142"/> - E-mDrI' ALLEN; OR,           with whatever she said or did. The admiration of such a man was certainly very flattering, now that she suffered her. self to think of it. But we will not follow her reflections. It was about this time that she was in the ascendant, as the ' particular star" of Blankville. Not only had Mr. Hen- dre taken heart again, and pressed on with his rival, Mr. Lumley; but others were following their example. None, however, seemed to find favor with her; for they gradually  i withdrew their attentions; first one, then another. And now there was no little tattling among the busy-bodies and news- mongers-those-green-flies of society. Some, envious at the admiration  which she had excited, conceived that she was "highly set up " to refuse such offers as she had. Among other things, a report was current that she had pledged her word to her husband, on his death-bed, that she would not marry again.  That but for this, she would not have refused Mr. Lumley, to whom she was very partial. That it went very hard with her to do so. We do not like to speak ill of any one; but we have reason to believe that this gentleman rather countenanced such a report. We know that when it was mentioned in his presence, he colored a good deal; stam. mered out a   half denial; grew generously angry that the world should trouble itself with Mrs. Allen's secrets, and begged that people would not couple his name with any such reports. For our part, we have only to say--that, in matters of this sort, it is a shocking bad world, this of ours; and that there are many-good people too, in the general acceptation of the word-who are prone to know an infinite deal more of )ther people's matters than they should do; busying them- selves in a manner not at all accordant with the teaching of ;he gospel; in which it seems never to have been noticed that :'busy-bodies" are ranked among " thieves and murderers." By the way, we have seen those who acknowledged themselves o  be "thieves and murderers; ' but we never yet met with he individual who did not think that he, or she, was the very ast person under the sun, who could be charged with being a 'busy-body."   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      283 From all which we have been able to gather, we believe that Miss Jemima was rather gratified at the admiration ex- cited by Edith. The old lady was very proud of her beautiful friend and companion, in whom it is probable that she felt a sort of maternal interest. For Edith, herseif, these suitors and admirers annoyed her. We do not think that she felt very grateful for their admira- tion. It certainly had no effect upon her behavior and pur- suits. In her quiet school-life there' was very little variety, and very little of which an account would be at all inter- esting. 'And so, your preacher friend has gone off without a wife at last?" remarked old Klinwell, the proprietor of the Eagle Tavern, in Blankville, to Edward Stacey, who had arrived here just as Mr. Richland was leaving. " Yes," he replied, "he is gone; gone for good and all, I guess; for he told me he didn't know     when, if ever, he should return to Virginia. He's gone off to Florida; and I'm sorry for it; for he is a capital fellow, if he is a sort of a preacher .'  "Well, I phought it was a settled thing that he was to marry old parson Arthur's daughter. I didn't know anything about it; but everybody said. so." I know nothing about it either. I suppose that there was no truth in the report; for, as you see, he has gone." We presume that the good man of whom they spoke had in no slight degree won upon young Stacey's regard; for he spoke of his departure in a tone quite unusual to him; and his attentions to him had led Klinwell to designate him as his "friend."  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7321-00000143"/> ED1t1'H ALLEN; OIB ;  a jter    hetee  ni JUDGE DIER, when a lad of fourteen or fifteen years of age, received-a severe hurt from the overturning of a ruinous old building, within which, With some of his school-fellows, he had sought shelter during a violent thunder-storm. Before this accident, he had been as hardy and healthy a boy as could be found. The dreadful injuries which he had received, or rather, perhaps, the long confinement consequent upon this accident, brought on symptoms of pulmonary disease. His injured health at length drove him from Virginia, his native State, to Georgia; whither he went hoping that a more Southern climate would benefit him. This hope was realized to some extent; and he arose to an eminence in his profession here which in Virginia he had despaired of ever being sufi- ciently robust to pursue. He married Miss Lucy Bentley, the aunt of the young lady of that name   whom we have k nown, whom      he had loved   from his boyhood; who, however, did not long survive the birth of their only child.  The name    of Judge Alfred Dier is still familiar in his adopted State. Much care was bestowed upon his son, in both his phys- ical and intellectual education. Judge Dier died suddenly, soon after he was entered at---    College.  At   this insti- tution, Alfred graduated with some distinction, and cameon the next year after, as the reader will have gathered from what has been before said, to the  University of Virginia. His third and fourth sessions here, as also a  session spent at the Cambridge Law School, were devoted principally to the study of common and municipal law.   It was not long after  SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      285 this that we met with him at Doctor Claiborne's; whither he came with Henry Bentley, just before Edith's marriage. By a strange, unaccountable secret sympathy, he was drawn to Edith from  the very first moment in which he saw her. It would be too much to say that, at this time, Mr. Dier really loved Edith. One of the first things which he heard in con- nection with her was, that she was betrothed to another, to whom she would be     married soon. HIe, himself, did not think that he loved her.   His own idea was one which we have alluded to in speaking of that time: that he felt for her a brotherly tenderness and care. We have seen that he was the first one to greet her as the bride of another, and in a kind, gay tone. He,did not think that he loved her; and yet, some six or eight months after, when he saw Mary Ar- buthnot, the first thing which attracted him to her was a fancied resemblance to Edith. He very soon, however, loved the beautiful Mary for her own sake. He became extremely devoted to her. Her death was a shock which he could hardly bear. His heart was widowed. He soon gave up a profession .which he had never much liked, and became a wanderer. Want did not oppress him; he was wealthy. He had no ill-feeling against his race to sour his temper; for all were kind and friendly to him. When we next saw him, on his visit to Edith, at Miss Jemima's, though his grief for Mary Arbuthnot had lost its poignancy, yet he was very much softened since we first be- came acquainted with him in his gay youth. No sooner did he meet with Edith-or rather with little Amy, who was playing in the passage-than a feeling swept over his heart, like a breath of the past; the memory of a dream. Edith's flushed, moist cheeks, and tearful eyes, strengthened this feel- ing. He was touched; he could sympathize with her. We have seen that he spoke cheerfully. It was with an effort that he did so. It seemed as if he had a part in her grief; and when that beautiful little child came playing around him with her doll, it seemed as if he had, somehow, a part in the child. He left Blankville; but while he was roaming among &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7321-00000144"/> 286        EDITH ATT.,N; OR, the mountains with the Bentleys, his thoughts were wander- ing back; and it was with the feeling of one who is led along willingly to his destiny, that he returned with them. Visions of a happier fate than he had yet known, and beams of hope, were beginning to dawn upon and arise before him, when a remark of Edith, and especially the peculiar tone in which it was uttered, at' once clouded the prospect, and at the same time revealed to the good-humored, but mischievous Susie Davidson, a secret of which he, himself, had only just begun to grow conscious. During this visit at Mr. Holmes', Mr. Dier-grew very much in love with his fair friend. Friend-and it Was much, that she was thus. He soon became convinced that she would consent to be nothing more; or if any, it was the very faint- est hope that he cherished. Her speech to Mr. :Hendr6 satisfied him that it was utterly vain. He regarded her remark to this gentleman as an indirect, but decided repulse to his own pretensions. He left the neighborhood sad-hearted and sorrowful. We must say something of his peculiar feelings towards her child, little Amy; although it is very difficult to define them.  From the first he felt as though he had a sort of pro- perty in the little girl. This was founded upon her very striking resemblance to her mother; and, still more, perhaps, to his lost-love, Mary Arbuthnot. This feeling-as if she, somehow, belonged to him-increased as he became acquainted with her, and when the little girl began, as she very soon did, to manifest a very decided preference for him. His pre- sents to "Miss Dollie" had won her completely; and, what- ever might have been Edith's feelings towards him, little Amy soon loved him, dearly; and she seemed never so well satisfied as when romping with him, or listening to his amus- ing stories. Edith was well aware of the singular attachment existing between her friend and her child; but, as has been said, she never dreamed of Mr. Dier's suffering it to carry him so far as to make Amy his heiress. And the fact that he did so, was a circumstance which he himself thought to have kept entirely a secret.   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     287 He wandered off, on a trip to Europe, as Mrs. Davidson's letter ha, informed us.- We have no thought to follow him in his travels. After a great while, very many months, when he was in Rome, (that once imperial city; now, if report speaks true, no more, at best, than a poor old dowager, all whose glory is in the past;) when here, amid mouldering relics of by-gone glory, a foolish notion, as he afterwards conceived it, took possession of him. It was the thought, suggested by some story which he heard, founded on the adage, "Faint heart never won fair lady," that, perhaps, he hal yielded too readily; been too easily disheartened. Per- haps he should have told Edith explicitly of his love, and pressed it on her acceptance. He would do so now. He would write to her, and tell her all. He did write to her. He did tell her all his heart's fond history. His letter was forwarded with some government dispatches; so he was'almost sure that it would reach her. He requested of her that, in reply, she would send her answer to the care of his banker in New York. He waited for many months, hoping for a reply. None came. Edith never received his letter. The Charge d'Affaires, through whose kind attention it had been for- warded, received acknowledgments of his dispatches from home. Mr. Dier wrote to his banker. No letter had been directed to his care. He felt hurt that Edith would not reply. Upon reflection he supposed, however, that she in- tended kindness by her silence. And now he strove more earnestly to forget-no, not to forget; that he could never do; but to drill his feelings into restraint-to remember her as he had once regarded her-as a sister-if he could.; at least, as one who was not for him. He thought of her often enough. It was his sweetest dream to recall her looks. It was his fondest occupation to recall her words, and to dwell upon them. He returned to this country in the autumn of 1840. In the summer following, he made a visit to the Northern cities, and thought of returning through Virginia. He was hurried hack to the South, however, by some urgent business. He  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7321-00000145"/> Z88         EDITH ALLEN; ORB  had lent a considerable sum of money to a young man, of whom  news reached him  that he had suddenly removed to Texas. Happily for him, the suspicions, which his friend who informed him of this, indulged were groundless; for he found his own secured, and at his command; but his visit to Vir- ginia was interfered with, and he decided to postpone it until the next summer. He corresponded regularly with his cousin, Lucy Haywood.    In May, 1842, while at Savannah, he re- ceived a letter from her, written at Mr. Davidson's, where she was on a visit.  Within this letter was enclosed a little slip of paper, which contained the following:   "DEAR MR. DIER: "Lucy is writing to you, and I take the liberty of enclosing this scrap. I am intending to pay a visit to cousin Mary Holmes, in about three weeks from  this time. I hope that I may yet prevail upon Lucy to accompany me, though she declares that she cannot leave home  again. Suppose you meet me there?  I do wish to see you very much. I have almost forgotten you, and suspect that you are quite an old man by this time. I have been earnestly on the look-out for 'Dier's Travels,' ever since your return.

I am not, by any means, sure that there is not a little bright spot in her heart, where your name stands as it is first above written, which might be found, if you, like to search for it. Of course, you are to, take this merely as a surmise of mine; and I will frankly own, that I would say almost anything to you which might induce you to meet me as above proposed. "Your friend, CL SUE DAVIDSON." Lucy's letter bore date May 4th, 1842, and was directed to Greensboro'. From this place it had been' forwarded to Au-   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      289 gusta, and from here, once more to Savannah, where he received it on the 22d. Mr. Dier was a gentleman of thirty-two or three years old: an age at which, in this "fast" country of ours, gentlemen begin to rejoice in having that pleasant appellative, "old bach- elor," attached to their names. But he was not one to be left unassailed by the daughters of Eve; and there were a num- ber of his fair acquaintances who looked. upon him as "an eligible," and occasionally, as circumstances permitted, brought their most winning attractions to bear upon, him. Just at this time it happened that a pleasure ploy to Tallulah was in agita- tion; and more than one fair damsel, perhaps, had been more than pleased when it was told that Mr. Alfred Dier had agreed to make one of the party. On the evening of the 22d, Mr. Dier wrote, however, the following:  ' DEAR TRENELLI; "I am suddenly called off to Virginia. I regret much that you are absent from town. .....,,. As I leave immediately, I rely upon you, my dear fellow, to make my excuses, regrets, etc, to our fair ladies of the atouztaiat expedition. "In very much haste, Your friend, &amp;c. A. DlsB." Mrs. Davidson  aad arrived at Mr. Holmnes' a week earlier than she kad expected. She had been here more than a week, and her friend, Edith, had, for a day or so, been with her. They were sitting, on the morning of the 30St     together in the parlor. Mr, Holmes had ridden out; Mrs. Holmes was busy attending to her domestic matters; and old Mrs. Clai- borne who was still alive and ia very good health, had gone to her chamber. Suasie's ittle Willle had mot been brought with his mnother on this visit, but was left with his 'Aunt jLucy," as he called Mrm     Haywood.     Amy Allen, Ellie Holmes, and little Mary Davidson were off by themselves, stringing flowers in a bower ia the flower-garden, whither they had sto- 13   &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7321-00000146"/> 290        EDITH ALLEN; OR, len away from a 1Master Leonard Davidson, whom we have never seen before, and who is now sprawling, at full length, upon the parlor floor, not far from his mother and Edith. 'Plump" is a descriptive word, which suits Mrs. Davidson well. She is fully as much so as when we saw her last. In fact, it strikes us that the "little Susie Henshaw," whom we once knew, is like some day to be quite a fleshy old lady. But the tendency of her person to embonpoint was not at all unbe- coming. "Playful, plump, and pretty," Mr. Davidson called her; and the alliterative phrase was just in each respect. She was scarcely less playful than she had been as a girl; and she was certainly a very pretty woman. Susie and Edith were both at work arranging some caps, collars, etc., for old Mrs. Claiborne. They had been speaking of Ellie--who had recently presented her husband with a little i' Susie Henshaw Bentley" her third child-and of Lucy Haywood; of dress, fashions, etc. Mr. Haywood had re- cently fallen heir to a considerable fortune, and Lucy was becoming- "very stylish," Susie said. From her, she reverted to Mr. Dier-: "Lucy wrote to him while she was with me, about the first of the month.  I sent him word of my expected visit to this neighborhood, but, poor fellow, there's no telling if the letter will ever reach him. Lucy was quite uncertain as to where he might be.  He had written last to her from some little town--I forget which--where he was stopping for a day or two. He's a complete wanderer.  What is that, love, which runs: 'And I must from this land begone, Because I cannot love but one,? or somehow so?   Ah, I can never remember poetry. There is something about 'loving niot wisely, but too well,' which suits the case too, I believe. Well-well, you need not blush so; I am not going to tease you about a man who may be- Bless my life!f" as some one rang the door-bell; "who caft be Soming at this time of day? Get up-you, Leonard-   / SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      291 instantly, sir!" And gathering up her work in one hand, while she caught the recumbent boy by the arm with the other, she made for the next room in all haste, followed by Edith. Here they had to seek shelter until the passage, which bisected the house, might be cleared. The servant girl who answered the bell was saying "Walk in, sir," to some one, just as Mrs. Holmes entered the passage from the back porch. An exclamation broke from her: "Mr. Dier! Really, sir, is it possible!" "Oh! Edith, girl, do you hear? Mr. Dier!" and Susie's face was radiant with surprise and pleasure. Edith's was scarcely less so.       I Mr. Dior appeared really younger than he had done when in Virginia before. He was now a Christian gentleman, the noblest character upon earth; cheerful and happy, as there is no reason why every Christian should not be; for, with such, the "cark and care" of life is properly estimated-rid of its undue importance;. and the calm peace of the inner life was manifested in his, countenance. It need hardly be said, that he was as welcome at Mr.. Holmes' as though he had been a near relative. From the first, his behavior towards Edith seemed to be upon a different footing from that of other days. There was a sort of indescribable restraint in their intercourse which all their efforts to assume and maintain the old freedom of friend- ship could not entirely overcome. We only mention this as a fact, without undertaking to account for it. Mr. Dier was a man of quick parts, who had seen, and heard, and read a great deal. He was good-tempered, sociable, communicative, yet very modest. Modesty disarms envy. Vanity, forwardness, and effrontery awaken not only envy, wherever there may be grounds for it, but ridicule and contempt. He was not inqui- sitive-rather acquisitive, being ever ready to learn from any one, of almost anything. In short, he was a very companion- able gentleman. Amy, who was now about ten years old, had rather dim and indistinct recollections of this, her old playmate and  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7321-00000147"/> 292        EDITH AUTI, N; OR, friend.' But after some little shyness and hesitation on her part, which soon wore away, the old intimacy was renewed; and, in a day or two, she became almost as fond of him as ever. Mrs. Susie was perfectly free and' unconstrained with him. She could not have been more so, had he been her brother. She frequently joked of her feeling towards him as if he were a kinsman: "Though she did not know how she could start up or bring about a relationship, as Edith was no kin to her either." What did she mean? The remark made Edith blush no little; and caused Mr. Dier to feel queer, though he thanked her for her kind sentiments towards him. Mr. Holmes had always, since Doctor's {daiborne's death, looked upon Edith with the feelings of a protector and guar- dian. Of course, she ever met with as warm a welcome at his house as could be given. Susie was as much at home here as any where; and if Mr. Diert had not felt very much so too, the fault would have been his own; for, as we inti- mated, he was beloved by both. host and hostess.   Mr. Holmes, a true "Virginia gentleman"-a name, by the way, of no little significance; and may it never cease to be so!- considered it one of the first aims of hospitality, to make the guest feel that he is not at .all in the way. His attentions went no farther than to show pleasure in the society of his friends, with nothing like punctiliousness in his behavior. ';Really, Mr. Dier, in listening to you, sir, I had like to have forgotten that I have some business which must be at- tended to. I have not the face to ask you to leave the ladies and ride with me to Blankville this morning. I cannot help saying, however, that I have an idle, and a very fine riding horse., at your service."  Or, as he asked, on arising from the breakfast table on the third morning of his visit, "A ride over the farm with me this morning, sir, or-" "Or a walk with us?" interrupted Susie. "Edith and I have proposed a stroll out. This pretty weather is so tempting."   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      293 "Oh, I withdraw my proposal at once, if that be the case. Of course, you will all excuse me. The farmer who does' not often look to his crops, will soon have none to look to." And Mr. Dier strolled out with the ladies; the little girls accompanying them,tq their great delight. And this was the beginning of daily walks, morning and evening.  But he rode out, more than once, with Mr. Holmes, and conversed with him upon agricultural subjects, displaying much more knowledge of such things than one would .have looked for. Peculiar circumstances had led him to turn his attention a good deal to the subject of agriculture, in the different coun- tries which he had visited in Europe-. Mr. Holmes, however, could not fail to discover that his guest had a particular par- tiality for the ladies' company, and these rides were made considerately short; and ample opportunity was offered Mr. Dier for enjoying himself with his fair friends. The ten days of Mrs. Susie's stay here, after his arrival, were happy, white days in his life; each one of which, with its little, but interesting social occurrences; the gentle pas- sages, and advances, and diffident parries, and withdrawals, between him and his kind, but'shy and timid mistress; along with Mrs. Susie's playful mischief, and tantalizing coquetry; and with his own --  - hopes and fears, which kindle hope An undistinguishable throng! And gentle wishes long subdued, Subdued-but cherished long!" might well furnish a lengthened chapter. Edith was now nearly twenty-eight years of age. But she seemed no older than when we saw her last; looked younger, indeed, as she was now in fine health, and not so thin as she then was. For the last six months, she had given up her school; determined, if she ever commenced teaching again, that she would, at least, first take a good- loag, long rest. And she was cheerful and happy; and, as Mr. Dier thought, very, A.,  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7321-00000148"/> 294        EDITH ALLEN; Ot, very beautiful. There was a remarkable contrast between her and her friend, Mrs. Davidson, in appearance-a contrast which suited them both very well-which fact, perhaps, among the unseen eddies which influence mortals-unseen, unacknowledged, and often unknown, but very effective- might have originally had something to do with the formation of their close and intimate friendship with each other; for it had long ago been observed and commented on by them- selves and others. Mr. Dier, who spoke of going on to see the Haywoods, had arranged with her that he would accompany Mrs. Davidson - when she went home. It was the evening of the eighth day of his visit. Little Mary Davidson had just brought to her mother, to put away for her, a piece of ribband, which Ellie Holmes had given her. Edith, Susie, and Mr. Dier were near the parlor window. It was a lovely evening. The sun was nearly down, and there were masses of many-tinted clouds slowly moving in the sky. Edith was gazing at them from the open window. "And to think," suddenly remarked Susie, "that I have but two more days to stay here; and this silly creature won't consent to go with us! Mr. Dier, cannot you help me to per- suade her? You surely have not seen enough of her yet?" as she held Edith's hand in hers. Mr. Dier professed his readiness to do all that he could; but how might he hope to have any influence, if Mrs. David- son's persuasion had been unavailing? Certainly, he felt that he had not seen enough of her. Indeed, the days last past had flitted by like some morning dream with Mr. Dier. He was intimating as much, and in a tone which made Edith watch the clouds still more intently, when a mischievous thought struck Susie. She hastily made a loop and noose with the little ribband, and flirting it over Mr. Dier's hand, drew it up, and, quick as thought, placing Edith's 'in it, tied them fast together. ' There! I've' bound you two in silken bonds. Don't let her   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     295 loose, Mr. Dier, until she consents to go with us." And off Mrs. Susie went, humming- cCome, haste to the wedding," and calling to little Leonard, whom she saw in the porch, to go with her to see "-Grand-ma Claiborne." It was nearly an hour after, when Edith followed her to the old lady's room. "You naughty creature! You deserve beating-you do! How could you do so! What upon earth will you get to next?" "To calling you Edith Dier, instead of Edith, dear, per- haps," whispered Susie, so that the old lady could not hear. "Hush!"-slapping at her-"do not speak to me; you are too bad!" But Edith did not look as if she was really vexed; and we presume that Mrs. Davidson was sure that she would not be, or she would hardly have ventured upon what looked so like rudeness. "I only wished to give the good fellow a chance, love, to tell what he could no-longer keep to himself," she afterwards said; " and I thought that it would be kind to give him so nice a text to discourse upon as that pretty little hand, which, you know was to be his some day, any how."  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7321-00000149"/> 296        EDITH ALLEN; OR, Two days afterwards Mrs. Davidson set off, according to appointment, and Mr. Dier with her. Perhaps they might have stayed longer-for it seemed to afflict both of them to depart-but Mr. Davidson expected to meet Susie at the end of her first day's journey, and it would not be right to cause him to feel uneasiness, and to take so long a ride, when he could illy spare the time; for Susie had purposely chosen to pay her visit at a season when he was very busy with his courts. Mr. Dier expected to be absent for only a short time. Of course, he would soon return to the neighborhood of Blankville. It was about a week after their departure, that Edith, as she had frequently done, got. old uncle Sam, who was still living, to drive her over to Elvy's Hill. She wished to see the old place; to visit her mother's grave, and her husband's. There, too, was her little brother's resting place; who, al- though he had died before she was born, she had ever loved and regretted; and her father's-for he was her father, and she perhaps felt more filial tenderness for him than she had ever done during his life. In that little burial-ground a crowd of emotions overwhelmed her. There was the grave of her husband, and she was the betrothed of another! But we will not dwell upon her feelings. They were painful, perhaps; for when she returned to the old house her eyes were red, and her cheeks swollen. Theresa was very busy preparing a snack for her. She   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      297 would never hear of Edith's coming here, and not eating something. It was " out of the question; she must eat some, appetite or no appetite." And very nice little lunches would she fix for her--new-laid eggs, fresh butter, hot corn-cakes, and a cup of coffee, in making which she pTided herself. Edith was off in her mother's old chamber, while Tea was making these preparations. Old uncle Sam had gone out into the field to where Ned, after paying his respects to Edith, had returned, and was at work. Tea had just gotten her coffee to boil to suit her, and had placed fresh coals under her hoe- cakes, when a strange lan suddenly entered. "I say, my woman, you couldn't fix a little bite of some- thing for a fellow to eat, could you?" Tea was very much startled at his unexpected appearance. This stranger, too, wore one of the most unprepossessing countenances which she had ever beheld.  She knew not what to reply. "I den know, sir. I must ax Miss Edith." "'Ask whom?" "Miss Edith- Mrs. Allen, sir." "What!-is she here?" "Yes, sir.", "Well, well; stay-you had better not trouble her. I did not know that any white person lived here." "So she don't, sir. But she come here to-day." "Oh, well-you musn't trouble her. I say, I'll come some other time. I thought that, perhaps, she wished to sell the place, and I came to look at it; but, of course, wouldn't like to intrude upon her. I wonder what she would ask for it?" "She don't want to sell it, sir. I'se heard her say so many a time." "But, may be, if it suits me, I might give her a better price than she expects. At least, it will do no harm to look at it. But, I say, you had as well not say anything about my coming. You know it might worry her; and I may not wish to buy the place after seeing it. Here's a quarter for you," tossing her a piece of money. "I'll come and look at the  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7321-00000150"/> 298        EDITH ALLEN; OR, house after your mistress has left; and I will pay you well if you will provide a little snack, almost anything, for me to eat. I missed my breakfast this morning."  The stranger chanced to glance through a window which commanded the approach to the house from the north. There were some half dozen or more persons approaching. He started--took an eager look. A sudden tremor seemed to seize him. He was hastily passing out on the other side, He bounded back. Full in view was another party coming up in this direction. He turned deadly pale, and his knees, shook so that he could scarcely stand. "I say, my woman, quick!-Hide me from these folks, and I'll give you five dollars." "Sir!" "I'll give you ten-I'll give you twenty. Here's the mo- ney. Only shew me where I may hide, and tell them that I'm not here--will you? Quick!-for mercy's sake!-tell me wtlere to hide, and tell them that I am not here-will you?" ",Bless me!-what is you done, make you feard of folks?" "Nothing at all--only they may think that I have." "Well, make 'ems prove it den," said Tea, who, very much alarmed, was siding off towards the door which led up into the house. "Oh-I say, my woman--I'll give you fifty dollars! if you'll tell them that I'm not here?" "I must ax Miss Edith. I can't do nothing fur you, 'thout she say so." "Oh, now, my good woman-you won't betray a poor fel- low-will you?" "I don't know nuthin' 'bout you. I don't know what you's done, makes you so feard of folks." "I've done' nothing, I assure you! Please send them on, won't you?-and here's fifty dollars for you." But Tea, having passed rather around him, reached the door, and flew off to look for Edith; for she was frightened terribly.        i "Blast the luck!-curse the nigger! They've surrounded  I   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      299 the house! Thunder and lightning! I must do something;" and he followed on after Tea. Edith had heard a trampling of feet around the house, and, looking out, saw armed men surrounding it. Terrified lest something dreadful was the matter, she was hastening toward the basement room, where she had left Tea when she met her. "What upon earth is the matter!" "A man, marm, and folks arter him!" "A. man!-what man?-who?" "Don' know, marm. Here he come now!" as the stran- ger, running to wherel they were, cried out. "Oh, lady, save me!" Edith almost shrieked at his sudden appearance. But his cry arrested her. "For mercy's sake, save me!I "Save you! How? and from what?" ( From these people. Tell them that I am not here; arid hide me from them. Oh! save me--please, lady!" "But you are here and---' "You can tell them that I am not; and they will believe you."2 But persons had now entered the house, and were heard approaching. The fugitive rushed past Edith, up stairs, beseeching her as he went' ' sLady, for mercy's sake! tell them that I am not here!" There came up from the cellar a number of men. "You here, Mrs. Allen!   Beg your pardon, madam- Did't know that you were here. We've traced a horse thief here, who stole this gentleman's horse," said Mr. McGlasson, who, with several others, whose faces Edith knew, was among the number. "Yes, madam,"-said a respectable looking stranger, bow- ing: "My horse was stolen from me, in broad, daylight, yes- terday evening, and ridden nearly to death. We have fol- lowed the thief -here; and have come in very good time, I suppose; for if you are here alone, he might have frightened you, as he is concealed somewhere about the house."  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7321-00000151"/> 300        EDITH ALLEN; ORB, Ned, our old friend, had entered while, he was speaking. "Yes, mistiss. I seed him come in the cellar myself, from where I was at work; and I come on torectly to see who he was, and what he wanted." "The person you look for, gentlemen, has just passed up stairs. He frightened me by his sudden entry and be- havior." The pursuers now rushed up stairs; and the fugitive was soon found; though he had-sought to conceal himself by climbing through the ceiling, which had been broken in the former searches for Letare's money. As-he was dragged from 'his hiding place into the light, Ned exclaimed: "Lawk a marcy! ef he aint the very man what kilt marster!" And, true enough, as many now recog- nized him, this individual was no other than Vincent Hawk. He was taken before a magistrate, and committed to jail, upon a charge of horse-stealing, preferred by Mr. Issachar Wool- dridge. The circumstances were these: Mr. Wooldridge had tied his horse by the roadside, and walked over into a field where his laborers were at work, intending to send a boy to let down the fence and bring the animal within the field. He did so. The boy soon came back, saying that some one had ridden the horse off. Mr. Wooldridge at once suspected an indifferent looking person, whom he had passed in the public road, on his way hither. Other horses were procured 'as quickly as possible, and chase made by Mr. Wooldridge, his son, and manager. The horse was well known, and several persons had seen Hawk riding him rapidly. The chase, was kept up without difficulty at first. About dark, a boy told them, that he had seen him pass about an hour before. At eleven o'clock, he had stopped at a tavern, ordered meal and water for the horse, and some refreshments for himself. They were still an hour or more behind. Fresh horses were pro- cured, and the chase renewed. At four in the morning, a ne- gro informed Mr. Wooldridge, that a man riding a jaded horse, had met him about two miles back. After light, several per- sons had seen him. At half past six, they lost ground by   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     301 taking the wrong road. They turned across the country, to save time, but could hear nothing of the thief. About nine o'clock, they reached a smith's-shop, where chanced to be sev- eral of the gentlemen who had afterwards aided them. The thief had not passed here. They were debating as to what step they should next take, when Mr. Price coming up, informed them that he had - but a short time before found just such a horse as they described, very much exhausted, with bridle and saddle on him, in his field. He had ordered him to be taken to his stable and fed. In hopes of catching the thief, the whole party had proceeded to Mr. Price's field. They saw where the fence had been let down, and the animal turned in; but could discover no further traces of his late rider. Mr. Price's hounds were tried, but they were young, and could not be made to "strike" the trail. The thief had probably taken to the woods, as no foot-prints could be discovered anywhere near. Young Mr. Jones--Caleb, or "Nimrod Jones," as he was called-about half past ten o'clock, came up with them, and informed them that he had met just such a man, who had inquired of him particularly the way to Mr. Letar's old place. Soon afterwards, a negro man of Mr. Kinney's told the same. He described Hawk; said that he had questioned him particularly about Elvy's Hill; who lived there, etc; and that he had gone on that way-was not far before them. Their company here divided, one party making a circuit around by the Blankville road, for the purpose of meeting him and hemming him in. Hawk, in wandering among the woods, had lost time, and they reached Elvy's Hill in a very short time after he did. Indeed, they had caught sight of him as they approached the house. It seemed like fatality, that he should have sought shelter, and been apprehended, in the house of the man whom he had murdered. Hawk had but a few days before been discharged from the penitentiary of the State. Feeling that Richmond was no longer a fit theatre for his operations, he had at once gath- ered- up whatever he could, and sought to try his fortunes  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7321-00000152"/> 302        EDITH ALLEN; OR, elsewhere. Wearied with the unaccustomed exercise of walk- ing, he had been unable to resist the temptation offered, when he saw a fine horse standing tied, just in his way, and the owner at a considerable distance. Breaking the branch to which he was fastened, as if the horse himself had gotten loose, he had availed himself of his services, thinking that he could do so with safety.  Hawk at first utterly denied the theft; said that Mr. Wool- dridge was mistaken in thinking him the individual he had passed in the road; that he himself had been several days in reaching the neighborhood. Some one having asked why he came. hither, he said, that Letare and Mouldy haunted him continually; and he had felt as though he was compelled to come and see again the spot where he had killed them, before going off, as he thought to do, to the South, or West. He had not, indeed, dreamed of being pursued; but when he had glanced through the window at Elvy's Hill, one of the first persons whom he saw approaching was the gentleman whose horse he had on the evening before taken possession of; for Mr. Wooldridge had ridden up, and paused, not far off, until the others should come up. Hawk was the only tenant of the jail at this time. He had been confined here before. He knew the room well. It was a rude, but very secure inner apartment. His meals were brought to him by a gruff-looking negro belonging to the jailer. On the third morning of his confinement, two days before that appointed for holding the examining court before which he was to be tried, Hawk remarked to this personage, as he placed his coarse, and somewhat scanty, breakfast before him: "I say, John-" "I aint named John-my name is Jaspar." "Well, Jaspar--old fellow-I say, it's a cruel, hard case for a fellow to be cooped up here for nothing, and to have such fare as that. "Cooped up for stealin' a horse, and you ken have better grub, ef you ken pay for it."   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGIIA.     303 "To be sure, I can pay for it." '"Well, 'money made the mare run,' and money ken make the victuals come." ' Well, stay, Jaspar; I wish to talk about it." "Got no time to talk-'sides, it's gin the rules to talk to criminals." "Well, bring me something that is fit to eat, and I will pay you for it." "Money fust. Don't go 'pon tick here." "Well, there's a quarter-can you do anything for that?" "'Twill help your dinner smartly. A can't come back 'tell dinner time. It's gin the rules." "Well, stay, Jaspar. I've a little bruise on my knee."' "A what?" "A little bruise-the skin chafed-that's all." "Well, what ken I do for that?" "I wish to know what you think it is worth, or would be worth, if it was-say on my head instead of my knee?" "Sir?" "Suppose I had the skin a little frayed upon my forehead, not to hurt badly-only a little place about the size of that quarter--what would it be worth?" "Wuth? how wuth?" "What would you have such a place on your head for?" '"Oh, 'twould 'pend 'pon circumstances." "Suppose, I say, that it was a small place, and didn't hurt, much?" "Well, I den know. I'm blest ef I knows what you's a talking about." { Well, think about it, Jaspar, and tell me when you bring my dinner." Jaspar brought him a dinner much improved both in qual- ity and quantity.

"I suppose that you would make such a place for five dollars?" "Certain I would, for less than that.". "Well, you can make a great deal more than that, by having such a place on your forehead, according to my directions." "How I gwine nmke it?" "Why, a slightly chafed place, with a little brick-dust rubbed on it, looks as if a stout blow had been struck. And a moderately hard blow about the head will sometimes stun a man for a considerable time. You understand- me?" "No, I can't say as I does." "With such a place on your forehead, you might lie there, by the door, as if, you were stunned, for twenty minutes or half an hour, or so; and have in your pocket, not five dollars, Jaspar, but twenty--four five dollar ntcs! You understand me now?" "Twenty dollars?" "Yes; made pretty easily, ha?" "Blessed life! they'd kill me." "Oh, no they wouldn't.

Twenty dollars are not to be picked up so easily every day." "Dat's a fact. But den, I'm feard." "Pshaw  'pshaw! Afraid of what?" "Well, I mustn't stan' here so."   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.     305 Think about it, old fell', will you?" The evening had set in rainy. Night came on rapidly. Hawk regretted that he had not advanced more in his negotia- tions vPith Jaspar, as this would have been so favorable a sea- son for carrying out his plans. It was quite dark within that gloomy tenement, when Jaspar entered with his evening meal. "Well, old fell', what about my proposition? This would be a most capital night for operations." "Oh, I'm feard!  'Twould be too dang'ous-too dan- g'ous!" "Not at all so for you. May be it would be safer to have the hurt on the back of your head. A little brick-dust will do for the forehead. You could make it in any way you choose, and your hat would hide it until you came here, you know. There is a place on the head where it takes quite a slight blow to hurt one dreadfully, and you had better make it there. It is just here where-that is-not far back of the ear. Here, let me show you. Just lean your head a little;" and Hawk dealt him a tremendous blow on the occiput, and, as he dropped on his knee, another and another, with a frag- ment of stone which he had, by some means, wrenched out from the fire-place. Jaspar fell prostrate-utterly senseless, if not lifeless. "Lie there, you black villain!" muttered Hawk; and taking the key, he locked the negro in his place. "And now, for the first time, it occurred to his memory that he had still another door to pass, and he did not know who might be there. He crept along, as noiselessly as pos- sible, towards the great iron-studded portal, which had closed upon many a hapless wretch. It was as dark as pitch, how- ever, all along this passage, and just before reaching this door, he stumbled and fell with his hands against it. The key instantly turned, and a female voice said petulantly: "Make haste, Jaspar, make haste! You look like you was a gwine to stay all night, and I'm all but drownded!" as a servant girl from the tavern, holding' an umbria over her, opened the door. * s          e         P  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7321-00000154"/> 306        EDITH ALLEN; OR, Hawk jerked her past him, struck her a blow which threw her far within the passage, shut to the door, locked it, pock- eted the key, and with the umbrella, which she 'had dropped, held over him, walked-for an escaped prisoner-very leisurely away. A considerable time elapsed before the cries of the servant girl atracted attention. When they did, she told a very con- fused story of Jaspar having knocked her down, and locked her within. Jaspar, however, was not to be found; and the jailer's suspicions were aroused. Going around fo the window of the cell in which Hawk had been confined, he called upon that individual. The call elicited no answer; The bit of candle in Jaspar's lantern had long since burnt out, andL he could not see within. Feeling sure that something was wrong, he procured aid, and proceeded to break into the cell through the window, as the door resisted all their efforts. They be- came the more earnest in their attempts to effect an entrance, as they fancied that an occasional groan was heard within. It took not much acuteness to guess at the truth of the case; and sure enough, upon at length forcing the. bars of the win- dow, and opening a way, they found the nearly lifeless Jaspar the sole occupant of the room.' Fortunately for the terrified girl, Hawk had left the key of this room in the lock; so that through it, and through the window, she found a means of exit. The next morning dawned fair, after a very rainy night. The-fields were too wet to work; and while Tea had gone out to milk the cow, our old friend Ned, having prepared some fowls and vegetables to take to market, sat very complacently contemplating his own physiognomy in a little looking-glass, before which he had been shaving. He sat at the open door. In turning about, the better to scan his features, the little glass caught the reflection of a window which was behind him, just as a human head was cautiously raised above the sill., To his horror and amazement, there was, for a brief moment, distinctly before him in the glass, the countenance, the most hideous to him of any upon earth, of his master's   SKETCHES O' LIFE IN VIRtGINIA.     307 murderer, Vincent Hawk! For a moment only was it there; for when Ned turned about, as he instantly did, to look at the window, it was vacant. He was frightened almost out of his wits. That man! There was nothing upon earth-no living being, certainly, of whom Ned was so superlatively afraid. And had he seen a ghost-an "' Evil," that great bug-bear of negroes-it would, perhaps, not have scared him so much, as this reflection in the glass of Hawk's face, as he cautiously peeped in at the window. He uttered some exclamation of fright, and instanter dashed off, as fast as his feet could carry him, out beyond the stable and cow-house, to where Tea was milking the cow. We have no time to dwell tupon his confused explanations of the cause of his fright; nor upon Tea's alarm, which was no less excessive. They consulted here very long before they ventured to return to the house. With all their alarm, they displayed no little sagacity in their conclusions and determinations. "Make haste! 'oman, will you? I 'on't get my things to market to-day, ef you don't. And ef you want to ride wid me, on your way, you better bundle up in a hurry, I tell you!" said Ned, in a tone loud enough to be heard all around, as they approached the house, with as little show of disturb- ance as they could assume; though Ned bore in his hand, as a defensive weapon, in case of difficulty, a swingle-tree, which he had detached from a plow. His vegetables and fowls were already stowed away in baskets, and Tea hurriedly prepared a bundle, which she inti- mated, pretty loudly, ought to have been carried to Mr. Holmes' yesterday, but that she had waited to ride with Ned in the wagon. "Come, 'oman! We must eat when we get back; no time to eat now;" and, fastening the door, they proceeded with their baskets and bundles to the stable, from whence the little one-horse wagon soon hurried off with them on the road towards Blankville.               \\ Much excitement had been caused by the news of Hawk's  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7321-00000155"/> 308        EDITH ALLEN; OR, escape. "Hue and cry' had been made, and the jailer had at once offered a considerable reward for his apprehension. But it was generally concluded that, as he had a whole night's start, and as there was no means of ascertaining what route he might have taken, any attempt to pursue him would be useless. The uneasy jailer was consulting as to when and, how he had better communicate the news of his escape to the Governor, when Ned brought the surprising, but welcome intelligence, that the late prisoner was still lurking in the neighborhood. A large party-quickly hastened to Elvy's Hill in pursuit of him. "Why, the fool must be cracked--bewitched, or some- thing-to be lingering about here after making his escape," said young "Nimrod Jones," who, with his rifle, from which he was rarely ever parted, on his arm, was one of the party. Most of them, indeed, went armed; for Hawk's desperate character was duly impressed upon all in the neighborhood; and they knew not what might be his resources. They cau- tiously and hurriedly surrounded the house, so as to allow him no opportunity of escape, if he was here still. The house was securely locked. In looking around for his tracks, however, there were evident indications of an entrance having been effected through one of the back windows. While they were noticing these, some little noise was heard in the house. "Oh, he's here!" cried one. "We have him!" "Watch the windows and doors!" cried another. A man named Grafton had just trned the corner of the house-the old building-when Hawk leaped from an upper window, Grafton raised a shout, and rushed upon him. The reportof a pistol was heard; and as some of his companions joined him, Grafton staggered and fell in their arms; while Hawk, clearing the palings at a bound, flew through Ned's little garden, sprang over them again at .the back of the sta- ble, and made a desperate flight down the steep hill. Every one thought that Grafton was killed. He was only stunned, however; for the ball, although the pistol had been filed within a few feet of him, had failed to penetrate his clothes; striking a button, probably.   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.      809 Horrified, they all gathered around him for the moment; while Hawk, with all his speed, was seeking the covert of the swamp growth near the foot of the hill. Only for a moment, however, did they pause, ere several dashed after him. Two or three mounted their horses, and galloped in pursuit down the steep at a frightful pace. Foremost were the jailer and young Mr. Jones. The former was armed with an ordinary fowling-piece, which, as Hawk neared the marshy ground, he fired, but without visible effect. Hawk disappeared among the alders and willows of the swamp. They soon -reached the spot where they had lost sight of him.  Here they had to abandon their horses. Dashing through the marsh, they saw Hawk ascending a hill which was crowned with thick undergrowth, about fifty yards from them. "Shoot him, Nimrod!" bawled the jailer. "Take him in the legs, if you can." The unerring rifle was raised. Hawk was an individual possessed of much cunning. It *did not desert him in this extremity; though, as it happened, it cost him very dear. He heard the cry: "Shoot him!"The jailer's shot had stung him severely, and his pursuers were now a good deal nearer. Glancing back as he ran, he saw the weapon raised. In the nick of time, as he judged, he thought to fall, and let the load pass over him. The rifle, in Caleb Jones' hands, was an effective weapon. He had brought it to bear, as well as he could, upon one of Hawk's legs, and touched the delicate trigger just as Hawk crouched down. The ball penetrated his back a little above the hips, and passed aslant through the lumbar regions. The wound was mortal, though he lived for many hours. He. was borne back to the house. What upon .earth had brought him here, after escaping from prison? Mortally wounded, as he was, he at first lied about this; declaring that he had come back here for his pis- tols, and some other thin/s which he had thrown aside when he was apprehended here before.  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7321-00000156"/> 310       EDITH ALLEN; OR, It was from the window of the room which had been Le- tar6's bed-chamber that he had leaped when he took to his flight. Several persons went to this room. A strange sight awaited them here. The back of the fireplace had been removed, and an opening made to another, just behind it, which had been closed when the house was built. And upon the floor was such a heap of gold as it would do even a Cali- fornian's heart good to see-of the coins of different countries, principally of English sovereigns and United States ten-dollar pieces. When Hawk heard that this had been discovered, a tena- cious energy, which had nerved him until now, seemed at once to desert him. How had he found out Letare's secret? We will give a brief synopsis of what he told Mr. Holmes privately. He had not thought of murdering Letar, he said. He told him of the forged contract. On exhibiting to that individual the original deed, Letare seized upon it; and when he resisted, struck him. In a sudden gust of passion, he said that he shot him. When Letar cried out that he was killed, he ran off. But, not knowing whether the wound which he had inflicted was really mortal, he had crept back to see. While he was peeping through the cedar thicket, Mouldy came up, suddenly. The dyin man told Mouldy who was his murderer. In his last gasp, too, he made him understand that something about this particular fireplace-a false back- had a connection with his gold, though he spoke so indistinctly that he could not understand what he said precisely. Of his silver, he said something, but died before he could make him- self understood. His last words, Hawk said, had been the name of his wife-"Poor Ellen!"-and the .Almighty's. All this made it incumbent upon him to kill Mouldy also. Hawk died in a frightful agony himself, cursing Letar and Mouldy, the former especially, and beseeching them to let him alone. The amount of Letar's gold was a little more than ninety- two thousand dollars, with a handful of Spanish doubloons   SKETCHES OF LIFE IN VIRGINIA.       3" and other larger coins, which Hawk acknowledged that he had pocketed before leaping from the window. It was remarkable that these pieces corresponded exactly with the little labeled and figured bits of wood in the two upper drawers of Letare's desk, which had been carefully preserved. The chips in the other drawers, doubtless, represented his silver coin; which, however, though, as may be supposed, very much search has been made for it, has never yet been discovered. And here we had conceived that our humble narrative might well be ended.  But the following extract of a hasty letter from Mrs. Davidson, written soon after her departure from Mr. Holmes', and before the news of these events last above detailed had reached her, hints at so much, in few words, that we submit it to the reader. She wrote: "DEAR EDITH: "Your friend, who accompanied me home, has paid us a most delightful little visit. He has just left us to go to see Ellie Bentley. Mr. Davidson and Mr. Haywood-neither of whom knew him very well heretofore-were charmed with him; the latter so completely enraptured, that he has left all and followed him off to Mr. Bentley's. "But I write this hasst note, dear Edith, because I have the great- est news in the world to tell you! We are to be neighbors, love! Oh, how shall I tell you! Mr. Davidson-the dear, good man!-has written to Ned Stacey-poor fellow!-agreeing to buy Stacey Home, which he has been advertising for sale. What do you think of that? "You remember that Mr. Holmes was constantly hinting and hint- ing of something before we left? Well, it turns out to be-this is yet something of a secret, love, you inust remember-but it turns out to be, that a certain gentleman, ' then and there,' as the lawyers say, with us, had empowered him to purchase old Longstowe, the old home of your forefathers, which Mr. Lumley wished to sell, and which Mr. Holmes had been urging him to buy. Now, isn't this of some worth? Mr. Haywood vows that he will not be parted from us, and declares that he intends to look up a place for himself some- where thereabout; and I really think that he is in earnest. Oh, Edith, dear, wont we be happy?" And now, actor-like, with hand on heart, expressive of gratitude, we make a parting bow; and the curtain falls.  &#xD;<pb n="312-313 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7321-00000157"/>   121 Main   Street, Richmond, Va.       iii Uncle Robin in his Cabin in Virginia., and Tom without one in Boston, by J.

"The essays of no man of this day in Virginia, upon the subject of Agriculture, can command the attention that will be paid to those from the pen of the venerable farmer, Edmund Ruffin; a man whose long experience, whose close observation and incessant efforts to im- prove the system of Agriculture, have placed him at the head of that noble profession-Tiller of the Soil."-Richmond Dispatch. "In a country like ours,the pursuits of Agriculture are the foun- dation of prosperity, and their improvement is connected with every step of its advancement. Its study is, therefore, of prime importance, and every contributor is a benefactor. It is one of the blessings of the age, that this department of industry has commenced a new epoch, from the applications of science and the systematized results of obser- vation and experience. For this latter class of improvements, Mr. Ruffin stands pre-eminent. He is deeply and enthusiastically versed in all the questions of practical farming, and with a generosity which entitles him to the highest credit, gives the benefit of his enlightened views to the world. The volume, before us, comprises his most ma- tured convictions on a variety of agricultural topics of acknowledged importance to all who cultivate the soil. It is a treasury of that kind of information of which thousands in the country stand in need, and for want of which their actual labor does not receive half of its re- ward. Buy Mr. Ruffin's book, gentlemen, and the earth herself will return the compliment with a smile."-Quarterly Review. Published by           J. W.

A large proportion of this publication consists of new matter not embraced in the preceding editions. The new additions or amend- ments serve to present all the new and important lights on the gen- eral subject of the work, derived from the author's later observation of facts, personal experience, and reasoning founded on these prem- ises. By such new additions the present edition is increased more than one-third in size, notwithstanding the exclusion of much of the least important matter of the preceding edition, and of all portions before included, that were not deemed essential to the argument, and necessary to the utility of the work. Prof. JOHNSON, of London, author of "Agricultural Chemistry," "Chemistry of Common Life,' and many other valuable Works, speaking of the influence of man upon the productions of the Soil and the application of Marl to worn-out Lands, says, "for examples of both the results, see Essay on Calcareous Manures, by Edmund Ruffin, the publication of which in Virginia, marks an epoch in the Agricultural history of the Slave States of North America." "Mr. Ruffin with an ingenuity, tn energy and a logic, which be- long only to the order of great intellects, has demonstrated, botheby analysis and synthesis, the disease and the cure; the disease, the want of Carbonate of Lime in our soils, and their consequent acidity and sterility; the cure, the application of this necessary element of all good lands, in the form of marl, which is. generally diffused throughout the tide-water section of this State and the adjacant States."- Richmond Whig.

Istruction, Regulation, Record, Inve- torg and Account Book, for the use of Managers of Estates and for the better ordering and management of plantation and farm   busines- in every particular. By a Southern Planter.  "Order is Heaven's first law.'* 4to. hf. roan, $2. This Book is by one of the best and most systematic farmers in Virginia, and experienced farmers have expressed the opinion that those who use it will save hundreds of dollars.  This is a most admirable work, one which everyplanter and far- mer should not only possess, but carry out its objects and aims, both in the letter and in the spirit, for they all tend to the introduction of system in the managment of landed estates. The Book purports to have been gotten up as a guide to overseers and managers; but is so ' filled, so arranged, that the proprietors of such estates would thems  selves be equally benefited by personally carrying out its- numerous plans, hints and suggestions; for after carefully looking through and studying its details, we most conscientiously say, that they are ounded in wisdom, and, if practiced'upon, would be. promotive alike : of economy and humanity--economy in the management of the farm or plantation--and humanity in providing for the comfort and health of slaves, as well as stock. It contains a  chapter explanatory of the manager's duty--shows i how hs journal or daily record should be kept. Upon this hed, a   I tell as upon the employment and treatment of negroes and manage-  ment of the plantation, the remarks are alike copious and judicious;  o  also are those upon the manner in which the stock of all kinds are Dbe cared for. Its observations upon the saving and application of manure, the cultivation of the plantation or farm, as well as upon the proper rotation of crops, are sensible, and show an acquaintance with the several subjects on the part of the author. The tables, illus- trative of the three, four and five field system of rotation, are full of instruction, and may be studied with decided advantage.  It also contains many useful 'tables,' showing the number of spaces contained in an acre of land at various given distances, which will be  found useful in fixing the proper distances to place marl, lime or  her manure, so as to give any desired quantity to the acre," &amp;c. besides -which; there are ruled blanks for recording all the details of  ,m and plantation duties, from the beginning to the end of the r, so arranged as to make the labor so plain and easy, that if anything can induce farmers and planters to record the operations of their estates, this work will lure them to it, That it may find a Ldy sale we most fervently wish, as it is pregnant with muche -d.-American Parmer.

His recent re-publication of Jefferson's Notes, with the author's latest autograph corrections, was not more gratifying to the author'S latt autograph or r  110.8'he-xuicio of this the Virginia scholar and statesman, than the republication of this rare volume-as precious in Virginia history as any genuine old painting of Raphael or Rembrandt in Art-will prove to the Virginia historian and student.

While we cannot raccord with all the views lie has expressed in regard to the colonization movement, we yet think the facts he arrays, and the principles he urges, aro entitled to the gravest consideration, as the results of unwearied labor , and of a mind well balanced and well trained.

The M1Emoir and Sermons of the Rev. William    Duval,  (ify Missionary. By the Rev. C. WATRR      with  a portrait. 12mo. muslin, $1. "We noticed the Memoir of the Rev. Afr. Duval, at the time of its publication, but we are induced again to refer to it, from the inter- est which a more careful perusal than we are generally able to give to the favors of publishing houses, has afforded us. We had feared, upon first opening it, that it might prode one of those common-place, stereotyped religious eulogies, with which the world is so often bored, when good men die, and with which the shades of the good men themselves, if they are aware of what is going on in their old haunts, must be purgatorially afflicted. But having glanced at a few hauntsp- ters in this memoir of young Mr. Duval, and having known the man, we were tempted to read farther, and found in the simple and unam- bitious record of a simple and unambitious life, and in the extracts from the diary of the subject of the memoir, a delineation of char- acter which is well culculated to awaken more interest in the mind than the most eloquent formal eulogy."--Rchmond Dispatch. "For the subject of this memoir we entertained a high personal regard--esteeming him  a  zealous and faithful herald of the cross. His connection was with the Episcopal church; and at one time he was the Editor of a Temperance paper in this city. He had been in the Ministry only a few years when called to his rest; but these were years of unceasing activity. As to the mechanical e xecution of the work, we can say it is well done, and when we say well done; we mean as well as similar works are usually gotten up at the North." [ Watchman and Observer. Wi m. Duval, one of the most efficient, as well as devoted among the younger clergy of our own day, graduated at the Alexandria The- ologica Seminary in 1845 .......... In the beginning ol 1849, he died, in the full assurance of Christian hope, and the friuition of Chris- tian exertion. And if his life teaches no other lesson, it teaches this: the immense influence which even four years entire devotion to the Christian cause Can bring to bear. In point of literary merit, the biography with which Mr. Walker has presented us, stands very high, both for grace of style, for loveliness of spirit,  and for discrim- ination of thought.',--Eiscopal Recorder. The subject of this Memoir   was a most excellent man, a devoted self-sacrificing christian and an ardent and zealous philanthropist. The records of a  life, such as are here related of Mr. Duval, cannot fail to be interesting to every one who has a  symp athy for the poor and the frailties which are often attendant  upo poverty."

PAGE.,  Second edition, with plates. 12mo. muslin, $1 00. ,'Its object appears to be to disprove statements made in Northern romances, touching the evils of Slavery, as well as to show that what- ever ills attend the life of a Southern Negro, their ills are produced by the imprudent sympathy of self-styled philanthropists like Garri- son, Pillsbury, Abby Kelly, and Beecher Stowe. We have examined the volume, but cursorily, and are inclined to think it well worth a perusal. It is written in a plain, substantial style, and with an earn- estness, though in the shape of a colloquy among the characters introduced, which is strongly marked."-Church's Bizarre, Phila. "The author is a pious and intelligent layman of the Church of Virginia, who, for many years has sustained the relation of master with Christian fidelity and benevolence. His opportunities of observ- ing the actual condition of slaves in Virginia, have extended through a long life and over a large portion of the State. The book is called forth, as many similar productions have been, by that clever, but false and pernicious work, Uncle Tom's Cabin. Unlike some others, however, it presents the subject with great calmness and moderation, presenting slavery as it is known really to exist in the Southern States. Its evils, and even its horrors, are faithfully portrayed; whilst the institution is successfully defended against the calumnious reproaches with which Northern abolitionists have assailed it. The principal negro characters are such as we occasionally meet with among slaves, whilst the diversity of conduct on the part of masters, faithfully and truly represent that much vilified class of Southern men. The style of the book is very modest and unpretending, and perhaps would suffer under the! criticism of a severe reviewer. It is, nevertheless, neat and perspicuous, conveying much sound argument and truthful history."-Southern Churchman. ("I have looked over Mr. Page's book lately. It is an excellent little work. Too much cannot be said of its true and correct picture of the slave holders of Virginia. The design and influence of such a book are good; and it is worthy a place on every book-shelf in the State. The appetite of the age seems to require something marvel- lous and exciting, not to say a vivid and indelicate exhibition of - crime, and books of an opposite character seem flat and stale. But I trust a new era has commenced, when wholesome truth will be received in place of the highly spiced and inflammatory nonsense which has for years poured like a flood upon us."--Winchester Virg.

"'Steel Pens.--The best article of this kind that we have yet seen was furnished us by Mr. J. W. Randolph, No. 121 Main Street. He has had- a quantity of them manufactured to his order, from whom clerks and others should call at once and procure a supply. Unlike most of the steel pens offered for -sale in our market, they possess a sufficiency of elasticity to make them glide smoothly over the paper, while they are perfectly free from the spattering and blustering that usually attend quill pens.-Richmond Republican.   121 Main Street, Richmond, Va.        xxiii BA1RTLEY'S POEMS.

The Penny Post, speaking of the Virginia State Fair, says: "At the same place we saw specimens of exquisite binding, done by Mr. J. W. Randolph. It consisted of a Merchants' Day Book, in pannel work, and a Journal in Russia leather. They are the most superb specimens of the art we have yet seen; and as we know not how to describe them, we call attention to them most particularly. The work was also done here by Mr. R.'s employees, without any extraneous Assistance."  &#xD;<pb n="334 (Advertisement) -335" xml:id="VAC7321-00000168"/> A QUARTERLY LAW JOURNAL. Edited by A. B.

JOYNES, author of "Essay on Limitations;"J. M. MATTHEWS, author of "Guide to Commissioners in Chancery," and "Digest of the Laws oT Virginia; "A. H. SANDS, author of "1 History of Suit in Equity," and other professional gentlemen of well-known ability and learning, have agreed to contribute to the columns of the Journal. The undersigned will commence, on the 1st of January, 1856, the' publication of a Law Journal. It is designed to furnish reports of decisions made by the Federal Courts held in this City--by the District and Circuit Courts of the State, and reports of decisions made by the Special Court of Appeals, and by the Supreme Court of Appeals in cases of interest and impor- tance. The earlier numbers will contain also a complete digested index of the reports of Grattan. Tate's Index of the cases decided in the Court of Appeals of Va., reaches the 2d volume of Grattan, and since that time nine volumes have already been published, which the lawyer must burrow through when searching for any of the decis- ions contained in them. This supplement to Tate's Analytical Index will relieve the professional man of this labor, and this part of the contents of the Journal will be so printed and paged that it may be bound up in a separate form. Each number of the Journal will contain a chapter or more of the Revisors' Reports, with their notes, and, such alterations of the Code of Va. as have been made by statutory enactments since the year 1849. This companion to the Code will also be so paged and printed that it may be bound up uniform with the Code. The importance of these Reports is well known by members of the profession who have had occasion to consult them, as shedding light upon the provisions of the Code.         I There will be occasionally introduced forms, of utility to practi- tioners, Clerks of Courts, Conveyancers and others. For the rest, the Journal will contain the usual matter of such pub- " lications:-the latest reports of new and important decisions in other States, (especially the Southern and Western,) essays on interesting legal subjects, and occasional biographies of those distinguished members of the bar, now deceased,. who, in their day and generation, won for it merited distinction and honor, and whose memories, cul- pably neglected by their descendants, live only in tradition. The work will be published qUARTEvRYX qn good white paper, each number containing over 125 pages, 8vo. All who are disposed to favor this enterprise, will please forward their names immediately.  New books, when forwarded to the Publisher, will be noticed ac- cording to their merits. TERMS-$5 per year; six copies for $25. Liberal commission allowed to all who will act as agents.
