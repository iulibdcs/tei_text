                  <p>THE sun was rising in the foot-hills. But for an hour the black mass of Sierra
                     eastward of Angel's had been outlined with fire, and the conventional morning
                     had come two hours before with the down coach from Placerville. The dry, cold,
                     dewless California night still lingered in the long cañons and folded skirts of
                     Table Mountain. Even on the mountain road the air was still sharp, and that
                     urgent necessity for something to keep out the chill, which sent the barkeeper
                     sleepily among his bottles and wineglasses at the station, obtained all along
                     the road.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it might be said that the first stir of life was in the bar-rooms. A
                     few birds twittered in the sycamores at the roadside, but long before that
                     glasses had clicked and bottles gurgled in the saloon of the Mansion House.
                     This was still lit by a dissipated-looking hanging-lamp, which was evidently
                     the worse for having been up all night, and bore a singular resemblance to a
                     faded reveller of Angel's, who even then sputtered and flickered in
                        <emph>his</emph> socket in an arm-chair below it,—a resemblance<pb n="4-5"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000004"/> blance so plain that when the first level
                     sunbeam pierced the window-pane, the barkeeper, moved by a sentiment of
                     consistency and compassion, put them both out together.</p>
                  <p>Then the sun came up haughtily. When it had passed the eastern ridge it began,
                     after its habit, to lord it over Angel's, sending the thermometer up twenty
                     degrees in as many minutes, driving the mules to the sparse shade of corrals
                     and fences, making the red dust incandescent, and renewing its old imperious
                     aggression on the spiked bosses of the convex shield of pines that defended
                     Table Mountain. Thither by nine o'clock all coolness had retreated, and the
                     "outsides" of the up stage plunged their hot faces in its aromatic shadows as
                     in water.</p>
                  <p>It was the custom of the driver of the Wingdam coach to whip up his horses and
                     enter Angel's at that remarkable pace which the woodcuts in the hotel bar-room
                     represented to credulous humanity as the usual rate of speed of that
                     conveyance. At such times the habitual expression of disdainful reticence and
                     lazy official severity which he wore on the box became intensified as the
                     loungers gathered about the vehicle, and only the boldest ventured to address
                     him. It was the Hon. Judge Beeswinger, Member of Assembly, who to-day presumed,
                     perhaps rashly, on the strength of his official position.</p>
                  <p>"Any political news from below, Bill?" he asked, as the latter slowly descended
                     from his lofty perch, without, however, any perceptible coming down of mien or
                     manner.</p>
                  <p>"Not much," said Bill, with deliberate gravity. "The President o' the United
                     States hez n't bin hisself sens you refoosed that seat in the Cabinet. The
                     ginral feelin' in perlitical circles is one o' regret."</p>
                  <p>Irony, even of this outrageous quality, was too common in Angel's to excite
                     either a smile or a frown. Bill slowly entered the bar-room during a dry, dead
                     silence, in which only a faint spirit of emulation survived.</p>
                  <p>"Ye did n't bring up that agint o' Rothschild's this trip?" asked the
                     barkeeper, slowly, by way of vague contribution to the prevailing tone of
                     conversation.</p>
                  <p>"No," responded Bill, with thoughtful exactitude. "He said he could n't look
                     inter that claim o' Johnson's without first consultin' the Bank o'
                     England."</p>
                  <p>The Mr. Johnson here alluded to being present as the faded reveller the
                     barkeeper had lately put out, and as the alleged claim notoriously possessed no
                     attractions whatever to capitalists, expectation naturally looked to him for
                     some response to this evident challenge. He did so by simply stating that he
                     would "take sugar" in his, and by walking unsteadily<pb n="6-7"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000005"/> steadily toward the bar, as if accepting a
                     festive invitation. To the credit of Bill be it recorded that he did not
                     attempt to correct the mistake, but gravely touched glasses with him, and after
                     saying "Here's another nail in your coffin,"—a cheerful sentiment, to which
                     "And the hair all off your head," was playfully added by the others,—he threw
                     off his liquor with a single dexterous movement of head and elbow, and stood
                     refreshed.</p>
                  <p>"Hello, old major!" said Bill, suddenly setting down his glass. "Are
                        <emph>you</emph> there?"</p>
                  <p>It was a boy, who, becoming bashfully conscious that this epithet was addressed
                     to him, retreated sideways to the doorway, where he stood beating his hat
                     against the door-post with an assumption of indifference that his downcast but
                     mirthful dark eyes and reddening cheek scarcely bore out. Perhaps it was owing
                     to his size, perhaps it was to a certain cherubic outline of face and figure,
                     perhaps to a peculiar trustfulness of expression, that he did not look half his
                     age, which was really fourteen.</p>
                  <p>Everybody in Angel's knew the boy. Either under the venerable title bestowed by
                     Bill, or as "Tom Islington," after his adopted father, his was a familiar
                     presence in the settlement, and the theme of much local criticism and comment.
                     His waywardness, indolence, and unaccountable amiability—a quality at once
                     suspicious and gratuitous tous in a pioneer community like Angel's—had often
                     been the subject of fierce discussion. A large and reputable majority believed
                     him destined for the gallows; a minority not quite so reputable enjoyed his
                     presence without troubling themselves much about his future; to one or two the
                     evil predictions of the majority possessed neither novelty nor terror.</p>
                  <p>"Anything for me, Bill?" asked the boy, half mechanically, with the air of
                     repeating some jocular formulary perfectly understood by Bill.</p>
                  <p>"Anythin' for you!" echoed Bill, with an overacted severity equally well
                     understood by Tommy,—"anythin' for you? No! And it's my opinion there won't be
                     anythin' for you ez long ez you hang around bar-rooms and spend your valooable
                     time with loafers and bummers. Git!"</p>
                  <p>The reproof was accompanied by a suitable exaggeration of gesture (Bill had
                     seized a decanter), before which the boy retreated still good-humoredly. Bill
                     followed him to the door. "Dern my skin, if he hez n't gone off with that
                     bummer Johnson," he added, as he looked down the road.</p>
                  <p>"What's he expectin', Bill?" asked the barkeeper.</p>
                  <p>"A letter from his aunt. Reckon he'll hev to take it out in expectin'. Likely
                     they're glad to get shut o' him."</p>
                  <p>"He's leadin' a shiftless, idle life here," interposed the Member of
                     Assembly.</p>
                  <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6646-00000006"/>
                  <p>"Well," said Bill, who never allowed any one but himself to abuse his <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">protégé</foreign>, "seein' he ain't expectin' no offis from
                     the hands of an enlightened constitooency, it <emph>is</emph> rayther a
                     shiftless life." After delivering this Parthian arrow with a gratuitous
                     twanging of the bow to indicate its offensive personality, Bill winked at the
                     barkeeper, slowly resumed a pair of immense, bulgy buckskin gloves, which gave
                     his fingers the appearance of being painfully sore and bandaged, strode to the
                     door without looking at anybody, called out, "All aboard," with a perfunctory
                     air of supreme indifference whether the invitation was heeded, remounted his
                     box, and drove stolidly away.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it was well that he did so, for the conversation at once assumed a
                     disrespectful attitude toward Tom and his relatives. It was more than intimated
                     that Tom's alleged aunt was none other than Tom's real mother, while it was
                     also asserted that Tom's alleged uncle did not himself participate in this
                     intimate relationship to the boy to an extent which the fastidious taste of
                     Angel's deemed moral and necessary. Popular opinion also believed that
                     Islington, the adopted father, who received a certain stipend ostensibly for
                     the boy's support, retained it as a reward for his reticence regarding these
                     facts. "He ain't ruinin' hisself by wastin' it on Tom," said the barkeeper, who
                     possibly possessed positive knowledge of much of Islington's disbursements. But
                     at this point exhausted nature languished among some of the debaters, and he
                     turned from the frivolity of conversation to his severer professional
                     duties.</p>
                  <p>It was also well that Bill's momentary attitude of didactic propriety was not
                     further excited by the subsequent conduct of his <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >protégé</foreign>. For by this time Tom, half supporting the unstable
                     Johnson, who developed a tendency to occasionally dash across the glaring road,
                     but checked himself midway each time, reached the corral which adjoined the
                     Mansion House. At its farther extremity was a pump and horse-trough. Here,
                     without a word being spoken, but evidently in obedience to some habitual
                     custom, Tom led his companion. With the boy's assistance, Johnson removed his
                     coat and neckcloth, turned back the collar of his shirt, and gravely placed his
                     head beneath the pump-spout. With equal gravity and deliberation, Tom took his
                     place at the handle. For a few moments only the splashing of water and regular
                     strokes of the pump broke the solemnly ludicrous silence. Then there was a
                     pause in which Johnson put his hands to his dripping head, felt of it
                     critically as if it belonged to somebody else, and raised his eyes to his
                     companion. "That ought to fetch <emph>it</emph>," said Tom, in answer to the
                     look. "Ef it don't," replied Johnson, doggedly, with an air of relieving
                     himself of<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6646-00000007"/> all further responsibility
                     in the matter, "it's got to, thet's all!"</p>
                  <p>If "it" referred to some change in the physiognomy of Johnson, "it" had
                     probably been "fetched" by the process just indicated. The head that went under
                     the pump was large, and clothed with bushy, uncertain-colored hair; the face
                     was flushed, puffy, and expressionless, the eyes injected and full. The head
                     that came out from under the pump was of smaller size and different shape, the
                     hair straight, dark, and sleek, the face pale and hollow-cheeked, the eyes
                     bright and restless. In the haggard, nervous ascetic that rose from the
                     horse-trough there was very little trace of the Bacchus that had bowed there a
                     moment before. Familiar as Tom must have been with the spectacle, he could not
                     help looking inquiringly at the trough, as if expecting to see some traces of
                     the previous Johnson in its shallow depths.</p>
                  <p>A narrow strip of willow, alder, and buckeye—a mere dusty, ravelled fringe of
                     the green mantle that swept the high shoulders of Table Mountain—lapped the
                     edge of the corral. The silent pair were quick to avail themselves of even its
                     scant shelter from the overpowering sun. They had not proceeded far, before
                     Johnson, who was walking quite rapidly in advance, suddenly brought himself up,
                     and turned to his companion with an interrogative "Eh?"</p>
                  <p>"I did n't speak," said Tommy, quietly.</p>
                  <p>"Who said you spoke?" said Johnson, with a quick look of cunning. "In course
                     you did n't speak, and I did n't speak, neither. Nobody spoke. Wot makes you
                     think you spoke?" he continued, peering curiously into Tommy's eyes.</p>
                  <p>The smile which habitually shone there quickly vanished as the boy stepped
                     quietly to his companion's side, and took his arm without a word.</p>
                  <p>"In course you did n't speak, Tommy," said Johnson, deprecatingly. "You ain't a
                     boy to go for to play an ole soaker like me. That's wot I like you for. Thet's
                     wot I seed in you from the first. I sez, 'Thet 'ere boy ain't goin' to play
                     you, Johnson! You can go your whole pile on him, when you can't trust even a
                     bar-keep.' Thet's wot I said. Eh?"</p>
                  <p>This time Tommy prudently took no notice of the interrogation, and Johnson went
                     on: "Ef I was to ask you another question, you would n't go to play me
                     neither,—would you, Tommy?"</p>
                  <p>"No," said the boy.</p>
                  <p>"Ef I was to ask you," continued Johnson, with out heeding the reply, but with
                     a growing anxiety of eye and a nervous twitching of his lips,—"ef I was to ask
                     you, fur instance, ef that was a jackass rabbit thet jest passed,—eh?—you'd say
                     it was or was not, ez the case may be. You would n't play the ole man on
                     thet?"</p>
                  <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6646-00000008"/>
                  <p>"No," said Tommy, quietly, "it <emph>was</emph> a jackass rabbit."</p>
                  <p>"Ef I was to ask you," continued Johnson, "ef it wore, say, fur instance, a
                     green hat with yaller ribbons, you would n't play me, and say it did,
                     onless,"—he added, with intensified cunning,—"onless it <emph>did?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"No," said Tommy, "of course I would n't; but then, you see, <emph>it
                        did</emph>."</p>
                  <p>"It did?"</p>
                  <p>"It did!" repeated Tommy, stoutly; "a green hat with yellow ribbons—and—and—a
                     red rosette."</p>
                  <p>"I did n't get to see the ros-ette," said Johnson, with slow and conscientious
                     deliberation, yet with an evident sense of relief; "but that ain't sayin' it
                     warn't there, you know. Eh?"</p>
                  <p>Tommy glanced quietly at his companion. There were great beads of perspiration
                     on his ashen-gray forehead and on the ends of his lank hair; the hand which
                     twitched spasmodically in his was cold and clammy, the other, which was free,
                     had a vague, purposeless, jerky activity, as if attached to some deranged
                     mechanism. Without any apparent concern in these phenomena, Tommy halted, and,
                     seating himself on a log, motioned his companion to a place beside him. Johnson
                     obeyed without a word. Slight as was the act, perhaps no other incident of
                     their singular companionship indicated as completely the dominance of this
                     careless, half-effeminate, but self-possessed boy over this doggedly
                     self-willed, abnormally excited man.</p>
                  <p>"It ain't the square thing," said Johnson, after a pause, with a laugh that was
                     neither mirthful nor musical, and frightened away a lizard that had been
                     regarding the pair with breathless suspense,—"it ain't the square thing for
                     jackass rabbits to wear hats, Tommy,—is it, eh?"</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Tommy, with unmoved composure, "sometimes they do and sometimes
                     they don't. Animals are mighty queer." And here Tommy went off in an animated,
                     but, I regret to say, utterly untruthful and untrustworthy account of the
                     habits of California fauna, until he was interrupted by Johnson.</p>
                  <p>"And snakes, eh, Tommy?" said the man, with an abstracted air, gazing intently
                     on the ground before him.</p>
                  <p>"And snakes," said Tommy; "but they don't bite,—at least not that kind you see.
                     There!—don't move, Uncle Ben, don't move; they're gone now. And it's about time
                     you took your dose."</p>
                  <p>Johnson had hurriedly risen as if to leap upon the log, but Tommy had as
                     quickly caught his arm with one hand while he drew a bottle from his pocket
                     with the other. Johnson paused, and eyed the bottle. "Ef you say so, my boy,"
                        he<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6646-00000009"/> faltered, as his fingers closed
                     nervously around it; "say 'when,' then." He raised the bottle to his lips and
                     took a long draught, the boy regarding him critically. "When," said Tommy,
                     suddenly. Johnson started, flushed, and returned the bottle quickly. But the
                     color that had risen to his cheek stayed there, his eye grew less restless, and
                     as they moved away again, the hand that rested on Tommy's shoulder was
                     steadier.</p>
                  <p>Their way lay along the flank of Table Mountain,—a wandering trail through a
                     tangled solitude that might have seemed virgin and unbroken but for a few
                     oyster-cans, yeast-powder tins, and empty bottles that had been apparently
                     stranded by the "first low wash" of pioneer waves. On the ragged trunk of an
                     enormous pine hung a few tufts of gray hair caught from a passing grizzly, but
                     in strange juxtaposition at its foot lay an empty bottle of incomparable
                     bitters,—the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chef d'oeuvre</foreign> of a hygienic
                     civilization, and blazoned with the arms of an all-healing republic. The head
                     of a rattlesnake peered from a case that had contained tobacco, which was still
                     brightly placarded with the high-colored effigy of a popular <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">danseuse</foreign>. And a little beyond this the soil was
                     broken and fissured, there was a confused mass of roughly hewn timber, a
                     straggling line of sluicing, a heap of gravel and dirt, a rude cabin, and the
                     claim of Johnson.</p>
                  <p>Except for the rudest purposes of shelter from rain and cold, the cabin
                     possessed but little advantage over the simple savagery of surrounding nature.
                     It had all the practical directness of the habitation of some animal, without
                     its comfort or picturesque quality; the very birds that haunted it for food
                     must have felt their own superiority as architects. It was inconceivably dirty,
                     even with its scant capacity for accretion; it was singularly stale, even in
                     its newness and freshness of material. Unspeakably dreary as it was in shadow,
                     the sunlight visited it in a blind, aching, purposeless way, as if despairing
                     of mellowing its outlines or of even tanning it into color.</p>
                  <p>The claim worked by Johnson in his intervals of sobriety was represented by
                     half a dozen rude openings in the mountain-side, with the heaped-up <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">débris</foreign> of rock and gravel before the mouth of each.
                     They gave very little evidence of engineering skill or constructive purpose, or
                     indeed showed anything but the vague, successively abandoned essays of their
                     projector. To-day they served another purpose, for as the sun had heated the
                     little cabin almost to the point of combustion, curling up the long dry
                     shingles, and starting aromatic tears from the green pine beams, Tommy led
                     Johnson into one of the larger openings, and with a sense of satisfaction threw
                     himself panting upon its rocky floor. Here and there the grateful dampness<pb
                        n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6646-00000010"/> ness was condensed in quiet pools of
                     water, or in a monotonous and soothing drip from the rocks above. Without lay
                     the staring sunlight,—colorless, clarified, intense.</p>
                  <p>For a few moments they lay resting on their elbows in blissful contemplation of
                     the heat they had escaped. "Wot do you say," said Johnson, slowly, without
                     looking at his companion, but abstractly addressing himself to the landscape
                     beyond,—"wot do you say to two straight games fur one thousand dollars?"</p>
                  <p>"Make it five thousand," replied Tommy, reflectively, also to the landscape,
                     "and I'm in."</p>
                  <p>"Wot do I owe you now?" said Johnson, after a lengthened silence.</p>
                  <p>"One hundred and seventy-five thousand two hundred and fifty dollars," replied
                     Tommy, with business-like gravity.</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Johnson, after a deliberation commensurate with the magnitude of
                     the transaction, "ef you win, call it a hundred and eighty thousand, round.
                     War's the keerds?"</p>
                  <p>They were in an old tin box in a crevice of a rock above his head. They were
                     greasy and worn with service. Johnson dealt, albeit his right hand was still
                     uncertain,—hovering, after dropping the cards, aimlessly about Tommy, and being
                     only recalled by a strong nervous effort. Yet, notwithstanding this incapacity
                     for even honest manipulation lation, Mr. Johnson covertly turned a knave from
                     the bottom of the pack with such shameless inefficiency and gratuitous
                     unskilfulness, that even Tommy was obliged to cough and look elsewhere to hide
                     his embarrassment. Possibly for this reason the young gentleman was himself
                     constrained, by way of correction, to add a valuable card to his own hand, over
                     and above the number he legitimately held.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, the game was unexciting, and dragged listlessly. Johnson won. He
                     recorded the fact and the amount with a stub of pencil and shaking fingers in
                     wandering hieroglyphics all over a pocket diary. Then there was a long pause,
                     when Johnson slowly drew something from his pocket, and held it up before his
                     companion. It was apparently a dull red stone.</p>
                  <p>"Ef," said Johnson, slowly, with his old look of simple cunning,—"ef you
                     happened to pick up sich a rock ez that, Tommy, what might you say it was?"</p>
                  <p>"Don't know," said Tommy.</p>
                  <p>"Might n't you say," continued Johnson, cautiously, "that it was gold, or
                     silver?"</p>
                  <p>"Neither," said Tommy, promptly.</p>
                  <p>"Might n't you say it was quicksilver? Might n't you say that ef thar was a
                     friend o' yourn ez knew war to go and turn out ten ton of it a day, and every
                     ton worth two thousand dollars, that he<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6646-00000011"
                     /> had a soft thing, a very soft thing,—allowin', Tommy, that you used sich
                     language, which you don't?"</p>
                  <p>"But," said the boy, coming to the point with great directness,
                        "<emph>do</emph> you know where to get it? have you struck it, Uncle
                     Ben?"</p>
                  <p>Johnson looked carefully around. "I hev, Tommy. Listen. I know whar thar's
                     cartloads of it. But thar's only one other specimen—the mate to this yer—thet's
                     above ground, and thet's in 'Frisco. Thar's an agint comin' up in a day or two
                     to look into it. I sent for him. Eh?"</p>
                  <p>His bright, restless eyes were concentrated on Tommy's face now, but the boy
                     showed neither surprise nor interest. Least of all did he betray any
                     recollection of Bill's ironical and gratuitous corroboration of this part of
                     the story.</p>
                  <p>"Nobody knows it," continued Johnson, in a nervous whisper,—"nobody knows it
                     but you and the agint in 'Frisco. The boys workin' round yar passes by and sees
                     the old man grubbin' away, and no signs o' color, not even rotten quartz; the
                     boys loafin' round the Mansion House sees the old man lyin' round free in
                     bar-rooms, and they laughs and sez, 'Played out,' and spects nothin'. Maybe ye
                     think they spects suthin now, eh?" queried Johnson, suddenly, with a sharp look
                     of suspicion.</p>
                  <p>Tommy looked up, shook his head, threw a stone at a passing rabbit, but did not
                     reply.</p>
                  <p>"When I fust set eyes on you, Tommy," continued ued Johnson, apparently
                     reassured, "the fust day you kem and pumped for me, an entire stranger, and
                     hevin no call to do it, I sez, 'Johnson, Johnson,' sez I, 'yer's a boy you kin
                     trust. Yer's a boy that won't play you; yer's a chap that's white and
                     square,'—white and square, Tommy: them's the very words I used."</p>
                  <p>He paused for a moment, and then went on in a confidential whisper, "'You want
                     capital, Johnson,' sez I, 'to develop your resources, and you want a pardner.
                     Capital you can send for, but your pardner, Johnson,—your pardner is right yer.
                     And his name, it is Tommy Islington.' Them's the very words I used."</p>
                  <p>He stopped and chafed his clammy hands upon his knees. "It's six months ago
                     sens I made you my pardner. Thar ain't a lick I've struck sens then, Tommy,
                     thar ain't a han'ful o' yearth I've washed, thar ain't a shovelful o' rock I've
                     turned over, but I tho't o' you. 'Share, and share alike,' sez I. When I wrote
                     to my agint, I wrote ekal for my pardner, Tommy Islington, he hevin no call to
                     know ef the same was man or boy."</p>
                  <p>He had moved nearer the boy, and would perhaps have laid his hand caressingly
                     upon him, but even in his manifest affection there was a singular element of
                     awed restraint and even fear,—a suggestion of something withheld even his
                     fullest confidences, a hopeless perception of some vague barrier<pb n="20-21"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000012"/> rier that never could be surmounted. He may have
                     been at times dimly conscious that, in the eyes which Tommy raised to his,
                     there was thorough intellectual appreciation, critical good-humor, even
                     feminine softness, but nothing more. His nervousness somewhat heightened by his
                     embarrassment, he went on with an attempt at calmness which his twitching white
                     lips and unsteady fingers made pathetically grotesque. "Thar's a bill o' sale
                     in my bunk, made out accordin' to law, of an ekal ondivided half of the claim,
                     and the consideration is two hundred and fifty thousand dollars,—gambling
                     debts,—gambling debts from me to you, Tommy,—you understand?"—nothing could
                     exceed the intense cunning of his eye at this moment,—"and then thar's a
                     will."</p>
                  <p>"A will?" said Tommy, in amused surprise.</p>
                  <p>Johnson looked frightened.</p>
                  <p>"Eh?" he said, hurriedly, "wot will? Who said anythin' 'bout a will,
                     Tommy?"</p>
                  <p>"Nobody," replied Tommy, with unblushing calm.</p>
                  <p>Johnson passed his hand over his cold forehead, wrung the damp ends of his hair
                     with his fingers, and went on: "Times when I'm took bad ez I was to-day, the
                     boys about yer sez—you sez, maybe, Tommy—it's whiskey. It ain't, Tommy. It's
                     pizen,—quicksilver pizen. That's what's the matter with me. I'm salviated!
                     Salviated with merkery.</p>
                  <p>"I've heerd o' it before," continued Johnson, appealing to the boy, "and ez a
                     boy o' permiskus reading, I reckon you hev too. Them men as works in cinnabar
                     sooner or later gets salviated. It's bound to fetch 'em some time. Salviated by
                     merkery."</p>
                  <p>"What are you goin' to do for it?" asked Tommy.</p>
                  <p>"When the agint comes up, and I begins to realize on this yer mine," said
                     Johnson, contemplatively, "I goes to New York. I sez to the barkeep' o' the
                     hotel, 'Show me the biggest doctor here.' He shows me. I sez to him, 'Salviated
                     by merkery,—a year's standin',—how much?' He sez, 'Five thousand dollars, and
                     take two o' these pills at bedtime, and an ekil number o' powders at meals, and
                     come back in a week.' And I goes back in a week, cured, and signs a certifikit
                     to that effect."</p>
                  <p>Encouraged by a look of interest in Tommy's eye, he went on.</p>
                  <p>"So I gets cured. I goes to the barkeep', and I sez, 'Show me the biggest,
                     fashionblest house thet's for sale yer.' And he sez, 'The biggest, nat'rally
                     b'longs to John Jacob Astor.' And I sez, 'Show him,' and he shows him. And I
                     sez, 'Wot might you ask for this yer house?' And he looks at me scornful, and
                     sez, 'Go 'way, old man; you must be sick.' And I fetches him one over<pb
                        n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6646-00000013"/> the left eye, and he apologizes, and I
                     gives him his own price for the house. I stocks that house with mohogany
                     furniture and pervisions, and thar we lives,—you and me, Tommy, you and
                     me!"</p>
                  <p>The sun no longer shone upon the hillside. The shadows of the pines were
                     beginning to creep over Johnson's claim, and the air within the cavern was
                     growing chill. In the gathering darkness his eyes shone brightly as he went on:
                     "Then thar comes a day when we gives a big spread. We invites govners, members
                     o' Congress, gentlemen o' fashion, and the like. And among 'em I invites a Man
                     as holds his head very high, a Man I once knew; but he does n't know I knows
                     him, and he does n't remember me. And he comes and he sits opposite me, and I
                     watches him. And he's very airy, this Man, and very chipper, and he wipes his
                     mouth with a white hankercher, and he smiles, and he ketches my eye. And he
                     sez, 'A glass o' wine with you, Mr. Johnson'; and he fills his glass and I
                     fills mine, and we rises. And I heaves that wine, glass and all, right into his
                     damned grinnin' face: And he jumps for me,—for he is very game, this Man, very
                     game,—but some on 'em grabs him, and he sez, 'Who be you?' And I sez, 'Skaggs!
                     damn you, Skaggs! Look at me! Gimme back my wife and child, gimme back the
                     money you stole, gimme back the good name you took away, gimme back the health
                     you ruined, gimme back the last twelve years! Give 'em to me, damn you, quick,
                     before I cuts your heart out!' And naterally, Tommy, he can't do it. And so I
                     cuts his heart out, my boy; I cuts his heart out."</p>
                  <p>The purely animal fury of his eye suddenly changed again to cunning. "You think
                     they hangs me for it, Tommy, but they don't. Not much, Tommy. I goes to the
                     biggest lawyer there, and I says to him, 'Salviated by merkery,—you hear
                     me,—salviated by merkery.' And he winks at me, and he goes to the judge, and he
                     sez, 'This yer unfortnet man is n't responsible,—he's been salviated by
                     merkery.' And he brings witnesses; you comes, Tommy, and you sez ez how you've
                     seen me took bad afore; and the doctor, he comes, and he sez as how he's seen
                     me frightful; and the jury, without leavin' their seats, brings in a verdict o'
                     justifiable insanity,—salviated by merkery."</p>
                  <p>In the excitement of his climax he had risen to his feet, but would have fallen
                     had not Tommy caught him and led him into the open air. In this sharper light
                     there was an odd change visible in his yellow-white face,—a change which caused
                     Tommy to hurriedly support him, half leading, half dragging him toward the
                     little cabin. When they had reached it, Tommy placed him on a rude "bunk," or
                     shelf, and stood for a moment in anxious<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6646-00000014"
                     /> ious contemplation of the tremor-stricken man before him. Then he said
                     rapidly: "Listen, Uncle Ben. I'm goin' to town—to town, you understand—for the
                     doctor. You 're not to get up or move on any account until I return. Do you
                     hear?" Johnson nodded violently. "I'll be back in two hours." In another moment
                     he was gone.</p>
                  <p>For an hour Johnson kept his word. Then he suddenly sat up, and began to gaze
                     fixedly at a corner of the cabin. From gazing at it he began to smile, from
                     smiling at it he began to talk, from talking at it he began to scream, from
                     screaming he passed to cursing and sobbing wildly. Then he lay quiet again.</p>
                  <p>He was so still that to merely human eyes he might have seemed asleep or dead.
                     But a squirrel, that, emboldened by the stillness, had entered from the roof,
                     stopped short upon a beam above the bunk, for he saw that the man's foot was
                     slowly and cautiously moving toward the floor, and that the man's eyes were as
                     intent and watchful as his own. Presently, still without a sound, both feet
                     were upon the floor. And then the bunk creaked, and the squirrel whisked into
                     the eaves of the roof. When he peered forth again, everything was quiet, and
                     the man was gone.</p>
                  <p>An hour later two muleteers on the Placerville Road passed a man with
                     dishevelled hair, glaring, bloodshot eyes, and clothes torn with bramble and
                     stained with the red dust of the mountain. They pursued him, when he turned
                     fiercely on the foremost, wrested a pistol from his grasp, and broke away.
                     Later still, when the sun had dropped behind Payne's Ridge, the underbrush on
                     Deadwood Slope crackled with a stealthy but continuous tread. It must have been
                     an animal whose dimly outlined bulk, in the gathering darkness, showed here and
                     there in vague but incessant motion; it could be nothing but an animal whose
                     utterance was at once so incoherent, monotonous, and unremitting. Yet, when the
                     sound came nearer, and the chaparral was parted, it seemed to be a man, and
                     that man Johnson.</p>
                  <p>Above the baying of phantasmal hounds that pressed him hard and drove him on,
                     with never rest or mercy; above the lashing of a spectral whip that curled
                     about his limbs, sang in his ears, and continually stung him forward; above the
                     outcries of the unclean shapes that thronged about him,—he could still
                     distinguish one real sound,—the rush and sweep of hurrying waters. The
                     Stanislaus River! A thousand feet below him drove its yellowing current.
                     Through all the vacillations of his unseated mind he had clung to one idea,—to
                     reach the river, to lave in it, to swim it if need be, but to put it forever
                     between him and the harrying shapes, to drown forever in its turbid depths the
                     thronging spectres, to wash away in its yellow<pb n="26-27"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000015"/> low flood all stains and color of the past. And
                     now he was leaping from boulder to boulder, from blackened stump to stump, from
                     gnarled bush to bush, caught for a moment and withheld by clinging vines, or
                     plunging downward into dusty hollows, until, rolling, dropping, sliding, and
                     stumbling, he reached the river-bank, whereon he fell, rose, staggered forward,
                     and fell again with outstretched arms upon a rock that breasted the swift
                     current. And there he lay as dead.</p>
                  <p>A few stars came out hesitatingly above Deadwood Slope. A cold wind that had
                     sprung up with the going down of the sun fanned them into momentary brightness,
                     swept the heated flanks of the mountain, and ruffled the river. Where the
                     fallen man lay there was a sharp curve in the stream, so that in the gathering
                     shadows the rushing water seemed to leap out of the darkness and to vanish
                     again. Decayed drift-wood, trunks of trees, fragments of broken sluicing,—the
                     wash and waste of many a mile,—swept into sight a moment, and were gone. All of
                     decay, wreck, and foulness gathered in the long circuit of mining camp and
                     settlement, all the dregs and refuse of a crude and wanton civilization,
                     reappeared for an instant, and then were hurried away in the darkness and lost.
                     No wonder, that as the wind ruffled the yellow waters the waves seemed to lift
                     their unclean hands toward the rock whereon the fallen man lay, as if eager to
                     snatch him from it, too, and hurry him toward the sea.</p>
                  <p>It was very still. In the clear air a horn blown a mile away was heard
                     distinctly. The jingling of a spur and a laugh on the highway over Payne's
                     Ridge sounded clearly across the river. The rattling of harness and hoofs
                     foretold for many minutes the approach of the Wingdam coach, that at last, with
                     flashing lights, passed within a few feet of the rock. Then for an hour all
                     again was quiet. Presently the moon, round and full, lifted herself above the
                     serried ridge and looked down upon the river. At first the bared peak of
                     Deadwood Hill gleamed white and skull-like. Then the shadows of Payne's Ridge
                     cast on the slope slowly sank away, leaving the unshapely stumps, the dusty
                     fissures, and clinging outcrop of Deadwood Slope to stand out in black and
                     silver. Still stealing softly downward, the moonlight touched the bank and the
                     rock and then glittered brightly on the river. The rock was bare and the man
                     was gone, but the river still hurried swiftly to the sea.</p>
                  <p>"Is there anything for me?" asked Tommy Islington, as, a week after, the stage
                     drew up at the Mansion House, and Bill slowly entered the barroom. Bill did not
                     reply, but, turning to a stranger who had entered with him, indicated with a
                     jerk of his finger the boy. The stranger turned<pb n="28-29"

                     and looked critically at Tommy. "Is there anything for me?" repeated Tommy, a
                     little confused at the silence and scrutiny. Bill walked deliberately to the
                     bar, and, placing his back against it, faced Tommy with a look of demure
                     enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>"Ef," he remarked slowly,—"ef a hundred thousand dollars down and half a

                  <head>PART II.—EAST.</head>
                  <p>IT was characteristic of Angel's that the disappearance of Johnson, and the
                     fact that he had left his entire property to Tommy, thrilled the community but
                     slightly in comparison with the astounding discovery that he had anything to
                     leave. The finding of a cinnabar lode at Angel's absorbed all collateral facts
                     or subsequent details. Prospectors from adjoining camps thronged the
                     settlement; the hillside for a mile on either side of Johnson's claim was
                     staked out and pre-empted; trade received a sudden stimulus; and, in the
                     excited rhetoric of the "Weekly Record," "a new era had broken upon Angel's."
                     "On Thursday last," added that paper, "over five hundred dollars was taken in
                     over the bar of the Mansion House."</p>
                  <p>Of the fate of Johnson there was little doubt. He had been last seen lying on a
                     boulder on the river-bank by outside passengers of the Wingdam night coach, and
                     when Finn of Robinson's Ferry admitted to have fired three shots from a
                     revolver at a dark object struggling in the water near the ferry, which he
                     "suspicioned" to be a bear, the<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6646-00000017"/>
                     question seemed to be settled. Whatever might have been the fallibility of his
                     judgment, of the accuracy of his aim there could be no doubt. The general
                     belief that Johnson, after possessing himself of the muleteer's pistol, could
                     have run amuck, gave a certain retributive justice to this story, which
                     rendered it acceptable to the camp.</p>
                  <p>It was also characteristic of Angel's that no feeling of envy or opposition to
                     the good fortune of Tommy Islington prevailed there. That he was thoroughly
                     cognizant, from the first, of Johnson's discovery, that his attentions to him
                     were interested, calculating, and speculative was, however, the general belief
                     of the majority,—a belief that, singularly enough, awakened the first feelings
                     of genuine respect for Tommy ever shown by the camp. "He ain't no fool; Yuba
                     Bill seed thet from the first," said the barkeeper. It was Yuba Bill who
                     applied for the guardianship of Tommy after his accession to Johnson's claim,
                     and on whose bonds the richest men of Calaveras were represented. It was Yuba
                     Bill, also, when Tommy was sent East to finish his education, accompanied him
                     to San Francisco, and, before parting with his charge on the steamer's deck,
                     drew him aside, and said, "Ef at enny time you want enny money, Tommy, over and
                     'bove your 'lowance, you kin write; but ef you'll take my advice," he added,
                     with a sudden huskiness mitigating the severity of his voice, "you'll forget
                     every derned ole spavined, string-halted bummer as you ever met or knew at
                     Angel's,—ev'ry one, Tommy,—ev'ry one! And so—boy—take care of
                     yourself—and—and—God bless ye, and pertikerly d—n me for a first-class A 1
                     fool." It was Yuba Bill, also, after this speech, glared savagely around,
                     walked down the crowded gang-plank with a rigid and aggressive shoulder, picked
                     a quarrel with his cabman, and, after bundling that functionary into his own
                     vehicle, took the reins himself, and drove furiously to his hotel. "It cost
                     me," said Bill, recounting the occurrence somewhat later at Angel's,—"it cost
                     me a matter o' twenty dollars afore the jedge the next mornin'; but you kin bet
                     high thet I taught them 'Frisco chaps suthin new about drivin'. I did n't make
                     it lively in Montgomery Street for about ten minutes,—O no!"</p>
                  <p>And so by degrees the two original locaters of the great Cinnabar Lode faded
                     from the memory of Angel's, and Calaveras knew them no more. In five years
                     their very names had been forgotten; in seven the name of the town was changed;
                     in ten the town itself was transported bodily to the hillside, and the chimney
                     of the Union Smelting Works by night flickered like a corpse-light over the
                     site of Johnson's cabin, and by day poisoned the pure spices of the pines. Even
                     the Mansion House was dismantled, and the Wingdam stage<pb n="32-33"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000018"/> deserted the highway for a shorter cut by
                     Quicksilver City. Only the bared crest of Deadwood Hill, as of old, sharply cut
                     the clear blue sky, and at its base, as of old, the Stanislaus River, unwearied
                     and unresting, babbled, whispered, and hurried away to the sea.</p>
                  <p>A midsummer's day was breaking lazily on the Atlantic. There was not wind
                     enough to move the vapors in the foggy offing, but where the vague distance
                     heaved against a violet sky there were dull red streaks that, growing brighter,
                     presently painted out the stars. Soon the brown rocks of Greyport appeared
                     faintly suffused, and then the whole ashen line of dead coast was kindled, and
                     the lighthouse beacons went out one by one. And then a hundred sail, before
                     invisible, started out of the vapory horizon, and pressed toward the shore. It
                     was morning, indeed, and some of the best society in Greyport, having been up
                     all night, were thinking it was time to go to bed.</p>
                  <p>For as the sky flashed brighter it fired the clustering red roofs of a
                     picturesque house by the sands that had all that night, from open lattice and
                     illuminated balcony, given light and music to the shore. It glittered on the
                     broad crystal spaces of a great conservatory that looked upon an exquisite
                     lawn, where all night long the blended odors of sea and shore had swooned under
                     the summer moon. But it wrought confusion among the colored lamps on the long
                     veranda, and startled a group of ladies and gentlemen who had stepped from the
                     drawing-room window to gaze upon it. It was so searching and sincere in its
                     way, that, as the carriage of the fairest Miss Gillyflower rolled away, that
                     peerless young woman, catching sight of her face in the oval mirror, instantly
                     pulled down the blinds, and, nestling the whitest shoulders in Greyport against
                     the crimson cushions, went to sleep.</p>
                  <p>"How haggard everybody is! Rose, dear, you look almost intellectual," said
                     Blanche Masterman.</p>
                  <p>"I hope not," said Rose, simply. "Sunrises are very trying. Look how that pink
                     regularly puts out Mrs. Brown-Robinson, hair and all!"</p>
                  <p>"The angels," said the Count de Nugat, with a polite gesture toward the sky,
                     "must have find these celestial combinations very bad for the <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">toilette</foreign>."</p>
                  <p>"They're safe in white,—except when they sit for their pictures in Venice,"
                     said Blanche. "How fresh Mr. Islington looks! It's really uncomplimentary to
                     us."</p>
                  <p>"I suppose the sun recognizes in me no rival," said the young man, demurely.
                     "But," he added, "I have lived much in the open air, and require very little
                     sleep."</p>
                  <p>"How delightful!" said Mrs. Brown-Robinson,<pb n="34-35"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000019"/> in a low, enthusiastic voice, and a manner that
                     held the glowing sentiment of sixteen and the practical experiences of
                     thirty-two in dangerous combination;—"how perfectly delightful! What sunrises
                     you must have seen, and in such wild, romantic places! How I envy you! My
                     nephew was a classmate of yours, and has often repeated to me those charming
                     stories you tell of your adventures. Won't you tell some now? Do! How you must
                     tire of us and this artificial life here, so frightfully artificial, you know"
                     (in a confidential whisper); "and then to think of the days when you roamed the
                     great West with the Indians, and the bisons, and the grizzly bears! Of course,
                     you have seen grizzly bears and bisons?"</p>
                  <p>"Of course he has, dear," said Blanche, a little pettishly, throwing a cloak
                     over her shoulders, and seizing her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chaperon</foreign>
                     by the arm; "his earliest infancy was soothed by bisons, and he proudly points
                     to the grizzly bear as the playmate of his youth. Come with me, and I'll tell
                     you all about it. How good it is of you," she added, <foreign xml:lang="ITA"
                        >sotto voce</foreign>, to Islington, as he stood by the carriage,—"how
                     perfectly good it is of you to be like those animals you tell us of, and not
                     know your full power. Think, with your experiences and our credulity, what
                     stories you <emph>might</emph> tell! And you are going to walk? Good night,
                     then." A slim, gloved hand was frankly extended from the window, and the next
                     moment the carriage rolled away.</p>
                  <p>"Is n't Islington throwing away a chance there?" said Captain Merwin, on the
                     veranda.</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps he could n't stand my lovely aunt's superadded presence. But then,
                     he's the guest of Blanche's father, and I dare say they see enough of each
                     other as it is."</p>
                  <p>"But is n't it a rather dangerous situation?"</p>
                  <p>"For him, perhaps; although he's awfully old, and very queer. For her, with an
                     experience that takes in all the available men in both hemispheres, ending with
                     Nugat over there, I should say a man more or less would n't affect her much,
                     anyway. Of course," he laughed, "these are the accents of bitterness. But that
                     was last year."</p>
                  <p>Perhaps Islington did not overhear the speaker; perhaps, if he did, the
                     criticism was not new. He turned carelessly away, and sauntered out on the road
                     to the sea. Thence he strolled along the sands toward the cliffs, where,
                     meeting an impediment in the shape of a garden wall, he leaped it with a
                     certain agile, boyish ease and experience, and struck across an open lawn
                     toward the rocks again. The best society of Greyport were not early risers, and
                     the spectacle of a trespasser in an evening dress excited only the criticism of
                     grooms hanging about the stables, or cleanly housemaids on the broad verandas
                     that in Greyport architecture dutifully gave upon the sea. Only once, as he
                     entered the boundaries of Cliffwood Lodge, the famous seat of<pb n="36-37"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000020"/> Renwyck Masterman, was he aware of suspicious
                     scrutiny; but a slouching figure that vanished quickly in the lodge offered no
                     opposition to his progress. Avoiding the pathway to the lodge, Islington kept
                     along the rocks until, reaching a little promontory and rustic pavilion, he sat
                     down and gazed upon the sea.</p>
                  <p>And presently an infinite peace stole upon him. Except where the waves lapped
                     lazily the crags below, the vast expanse beyond seemed unbroken by ripple,
                     heaving only in broad ponderable sheets, and rhythmically, as if still in
                     sleep. The air was filled with a luminous haze that caught and held the direct
                     sunbeams. In the deep calm that lay upon the sea, it seemed to Islington that
                     all the tenderness of culture, magic of wealth, and spell of refinement that
                     for years had wrought upon that favored shore had extended its gracious
                     influence even here. What a pampered and caressed old ocean it was; cajoled,
                     flattered, and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fêted</foreign> where it lay! An odd
                     recollection of the turbid Stanislaus hurrying by the ascetic pines, of the
                     grim outlines of Deadwood Hill, swam before his eyes, and made the yellow green
                     of the velvet lawn and graceful foliage seem almost tropical by contrast. And,
                     looking up, a few yards distant he beheld a tall slip of a girl gazing upon the
                     sea,—Blanche Masterman.</p>
                  <p>She had plucked somewhere a large fan-shaped leaf, which she held parasol-wise,
                     shading the blond masses of her hair, and hiding her gray eyes. She had changed
                     her festal dress, with its amplitude of flounce and train, for a closely
                     fitting half-antique habit whose scant outlines would have been trying to limbs
                     less shapely, but which prettily accented the graceful curves and sweeping
                     lines of this Greyport goddess. As Islington rose, she came toward him with a
                     frankly outstretched hand and unconstrained manner. Had she observed him first?
                     I don't know.</p>
                  <p>They sat down together on a rustic seat, Miss Blanche facing the sea, and
                     shading her eyes with the leaf.</p>
                  <p>"I don't really know how long I have been sitting here," said Islington, "or
                     whether I have not been actually asleep and dreaming. It seemed too lovely a
                     morning to go to bed. But you?"</p>
                  <p>From behind the leaf, it appeared that Miss Blanche, on retiring, had been
                     pursued by a hideous winged bug which defied the efforts of herself and maid to
                     dislodge. Odin, the Spitz dog, had insisted upon scratching at the door. And it
                     made her eyes red to sleep in the morning. And she had an early call to make.
                     And the sea looked lovely.</p>
                  <p>"I'm glad to find you here, whatever be the cause," said Islington, with his
                     old directness. "To-day, as you know, is my last day in Greyport,<pb n="38-39"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000021"/> and it is much pleasanter to say good by under
                     this blue sky than even beneath your father's wonderful frescos yonder. I want
                     to remember you, too, as part of this pleasant prospect which belongs to us
                     all, rather than recall you in anybody's particular setting."</p>
                  <p>"I know," said Blanche, with equal directness, "that houses are one of the
                     defects of our civilization; but I don't think I ever heard the idea as
                     elegantly expressed before. Where do you go?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know yet. I have several plans. I may go to South America and become
                     president of one of the republics,—I am not particular which. I am rich, but in
                     that part of America which lies outside of Greyport it is necessary for every
                     man to have some work. My friends think I should have some great aim in life,
                     with a capital A. But I was born a vagabond, and a vagabond I shall probably
                     die."</p>
                  <p>"I don't know anybody in South America," said Blanche, languidly. "There were
                     two girls here last season, but they did n't wear stays in the house, and their
                     white frocks never were properly done up. If you go to South America, you must
                     write to me."</p>
                  <p>"I will. Can you tell me the name of this flower which I found in your
                     greenhouse. It looks much like a California blossom."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps it is. Father bought it of a half-crazy old man who came here one day.
                     Do you know him?"</p>
                  <p>Islington laughed. "I am afraid not. But let me present this in a less
                     business-like fashion."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you. Remind me to give you one in return before you go,—or will you
                     choose yourself?"</p>
                  <p>They had both risen as by a common instinct.</p>
                  <p>"Good by."</p>
                  <p>The cool flower-like hand lay in his for an instant.</p>
                  <p>"Will you oblige me by putting aside that leaf a moment before I go?"</p>
                  <p>"But my eyes are red, and I look like a perfect fright."</p>
                  <p>Yet, after a long pause, the leaf fluttered down, and a pair of very beautiful
                     but withal very clear and critical eyes met his. Islington was constrained to
                     look away. When he turned again, she was gone.</p>
                  <p>"Mister Hislington,—sir!"</p>
                  <p>It was Chalker, the English groom, out of breath with running.</p>
                  <p>"Seein' you alone, sir,—beg your pardon, sir,—but there's a person—"</p>
                  <p>"A person! what the devil do you mean? Speak English—no, damn it, I mean
                     don't," said Islington, snappishly.</p>
                  <p>"I sed a person, sir. Beg pardon—no offence—but not a gent, sir. In the
                     lib'ry."</p>
                  <p>A little amused even through the utter dissatisfaction<pb n="40-41"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000022"/> isfaction with himself and vague loneliness that
                     had suddenly come upon him, Islington, as he walked toward the lodge, asked,
                     "Why is n't he a gent?</p>
                  <p>"No gent—beggin' your pardin, sir—'ud guy a man in, sarvis, sir. Takes me 'ands
                     so, sir, as I sits in the rumble at the gate, and puts 'em downd so, sir, and
                     sez, 'Put 'em in your pocket, young man,—or is it a road agint you expects to
                     see, that you 'olds hup your 'ands, hand crosses 'em like to that,' sez he.
                     'Old 'ard,' sez he, 'on the short curves, or you'll bust your precious crust,'
                     sez he. And hasks for you, sir. This way, sir."</p>
                  <p>They entered the lodge. Islington hurried down the long Gothic hall, and opened
                     the library door.</p>
                  <p>In an arm-chair, in the centre of the room, a man sat apparently contemplating
                     a large, stiff, yellow hat with an enormous brim, that was placed on the floor
                     before him. His hands rested lightly between his knees, but one foot was drawn
                     up at the side of his chair in a peculiar manner. In the first glance that
                     Islington gave, the attitude in some odd, irreconcilable way suggested a brake.
                     In another moment he dashed across the room, and, holding out both hands,
                     cried, "Yuba Bill!"</p>
                  <p>The man rose, caught Islington by the shoulders, wheeled him round, hugged him,
                     felt of his ribs like a good-natured ogre, shook his hands violently, laughed,
                     and then said, somewhat ruefully, "And how ever did you know me?"</p>
                  <p>Seeing that Yuba Bill evidently regarded himself as in some elaborate disguise,
                     Islington laughed, and suggested that it must have been instinct.</p>
                  <p>"And you?" said Bill, holding him at arm's length, and surveying him
                     critically,—"you!—toe think—toe think—a little cuss no higher nor a trace, a
                     boy as I've flicked outer the road with a whip time in agin, a boy ez never hed
                     much clothes to speak of, turned into a sport!"</p>
                  <p>Islington remembered, with a thrill of ludicrous terror, that he still wore his
                     evening dress.</p>
                  <p>"Turned," continued Yuba Bill, severely,—"turned into a restyourant waiter,—a
                     garsong! Eh, Alfonse, bring me a patty de foy grass and an omelette,
                     demme!"</p>
                  <p>"Dear old chap!" said Islington, laughing, and trying to put his hand over
                     Bill's bearded mouth, "but you—<emph>you</emph> don't look exactly like
                     yourself! You're not well, Bill." And indeed, as he turned toward the light,
                     Bill's eyes appeared cavernous, and his hair and beard thickly streaked with
                     gray.</p>
                  <p>"Maybe it's this yer harness," said Bill, a little anxiously. "When I hitches
                     on this yer curb" (he indicated a massive gold watch-chain with enormous
                     links), "and mounts this 'morning star,'" (he pointed to a very large solitaire
                     pin which had the appearance of blistering his whole shirt-front), "it kinder
                     weighs heavy on me, Tommy. Otherwise<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6646-00000023"/>
                     wise I'm all right, my boy,—all right." But he evaded Islington's keen eye, and
                     turned from the light.</p>
                  <p>"You have something to tell me, Bill," said Islington, suddenly, and with
                     almost brusque directness; "out with it."</p>
                  <p>Bill did not speak, but moved uneasily toward his hat.</p>
                  <p>"You did n't come three thousand miles, without a word of warning, to talk to
                     me of old times," said Islington, more kindly, "glad as I would have been to
                     see you. It is n't your way, Bill, and you know it. We shall not be disturbed
                     here," he added, in reply to an inquiring glance that Bill directed to the
                     door, "and I am ready to hear you."</p>
                  <p>"Firstly, then," said Bill, drawing his chair nearer Islington, "answer me one
                     question, Tommy, fair and square, and up and down."</p>
                  <p>"Go on," said Islington, with a slight smile.</p>
                  <p>"Ef I should say to you, Tommy,—say to you to-day, right here, you must come
                     with me,—you must leave this place for a month, a year, two years maybe,
                     perhaps forever,—is there anything that'ud keep you,—anything, my boy, ez you
                     could n't leave?"</p>
                  <p>"No," said Tommy, quietly; "I am only visiting here. I thought of leaving
                     Greyport to-day."</p>
                  <p>"But if I should say to you, Tommy, come with me on a <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                        >pasear</foreign> to Chiny, to Japan, to South Ameriky, p'r'aps, could you
                     go?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Islington, after a slight pause.</p>
                  <p>"Thar is n't ennything," said Bill, drawing a little closer, and lowering his
                     voice confidentially,—"ennything in the way of a young woman—you understand,
                     Tommy—ez would keep you? They're mighty sweet about here; and whether a man is
                     young or old, Tommy, there's always some woman as is brake or whip to him!"</p>
                  <p>In a certain excited bitterness that characterized the delivery of this
                     abstract truth, Bill did not see that the young man's face flushed slightly as
                     he answered "No."</p>
                  <p>"Then listen. It's seven years ago, Tommy, thet I was working one o' the
                     Pioneer coaches over from Gold Hill. Ez I stood in front o' the stage-office,
                     the sheriff o' the county comes to me, and he sez, 'Bill,' sez he, 'I've got a
                     looney chap, as I'm in charge of, taking 'im down to the 'sylum in Stockton.
                     He'z quiet and peaceable, but the insides don't like to ride with him. Hev you
                     enny objection to give him a lift on the box beside you?' I sez, 'No; put him
                     up.' When I came to go and get up on that box beside him, that man, Tommy,—that
                     man sittin' there, quiet and peaceable, was—Johnson!</p>
                  <p>"He did n't know me, my boy," Yuba Bill continued, rising and putting his hands
                     on Tommy's shoulders,—"he did n't know me. He did n't know nothing about you,
                     nor Angel's, nor the quicksilver<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6646-00000024"/> lode,
                     nor even his own name. He said his name was Skaggs, but I knowd it was Johnson.
                     Thar was times, Tommy, you might have knocked me off that box with a feather;
                     thar was times when if the twenty-seven passengers o' that stage hed found
                     theirselves swimming in the American River five hundred feet below the road, I
                     never could have explained it satisfactorily to the company,—never.</p>
                  <p>"The sheriff said," Bill continued hastily, as if to preclude any interruption
                     from the young man,—"the sheriff said he had been brought into Murphy's Camp
                     three years before, dripping with water, and sufferin' from perkussion of the
                     brain, and had been cared for generally by the boys 'round. When I told the
                     sheriff I knowed 'im, I got him to leave him in my care; and I took him to
                     'Frisco, Tommy, to 'Frisco, and I put him in charge o' the best doctors there,
                     and paid his board myself. There was nothin' he did n't have ez he wanted.
                     Don't look that way, my dear boy, for God's sake, don't!"</p>
                  <p>"O Bill," said Islington, rising and staggering to the window, "why did you
                     keep this from me?"</p>
                  <p>"Why?" said Bill, turning on him savagely,—"why? because I warn't a fool. Thar
                     was you, winnin' your way in college; thar was <emph>you</emph>, risin' in the
                     world, and of some account to it; Yer was an old bummer, ez good ez dead to
                     it,—a man ez oughter been dead afore! a man ez never denied it! But you allus
                     liked him better nor me," said Bill, bitterly.</p>
                  <p>"Forgive me, Bill," said the young man, seizing both his hands. "I know you did
                     it for the best; but go on."</p>
                  <p>"Thar ain't much more to tell, nor much use to tell it, as I can see," said
                     Bill, moodily. "He never could be cured, the doctors said, for he had what they
                     called monomania,—was always talking about his wife and darter that somebody
                     had stole away years ago, and plannin' revenge on that somebody. And six months
                     ago he was missed. I tracked him to Carson, to Salt Lake City, to Omaha, to
                     Chicago, to New York,—and here!"</p>
                  <p>"Here!" echoed Islington.</p>
                  <p>"Here! And that's what brings me here to-day. Whethers he's crazy or well,
                     whethers he's huntin' you or lookin' up that other man, you must get away from
                     here. You must n't see him. You and me, Tommy, will go away on a cruise. In
                     three or four years he'll be dead or missing, and then we'll come back. Come."
                     And he rose to his feet.</p>
                  <p>"Bill," said Islington, rising also, and taking the hand of his friend, with
                     the same quiet obstinacy that in the old days had endeared him to Bill,
                     "wherever he is, here or elsewhere, sane or crazy, I shall seek and find him.
                     Every dollar that I have shall be his, every dollar that I have<pb n="46-47"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000025"/> spent shall be returned to him. I am young yet,
                     thank God, and can work; and if there is a way out of this miserable business,
                     I shall find it."</p>
                  <p>"I knew," said Bill, with a surliness that ill concealed his evident admiration
                     of the calm figure before him—"I knew the partikler style of d—n fool that you
                     was, and expected no better. Good by, then—God Almighty! who's that?"</p>
                  <p>He was on his way to the open French window, but had started back, his face
                     quite white and bloodless, and his eyes staring. Islington ran to the window,
                     and looked out. A white skirt vanished around the corner of the veranda. When
                     he returned, Bill had dropped into a chair.</p>
                  <p>"It must have been Miss Masterman, I think; but what's the matter?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing," said Bill, faintly; "have you got any whiskey handy?"</p>
                  <p>Islington brought a decanter, and, pouring out some spirits, handed the glass
                     to Bill. Bill drained it, and then said, "Who is Miss Masterman?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Masterman's daughter; that is, an adopted daughter, I believe."</p>
                  <p>"Wot name?"</p>
                  <p>"I really don't know," said Islington, pettishly, more vexed than he cared to
                     own at this questioning.</p>
                  <p>Yuba Bill rose and walked to the window, closed it, walked back again to the
                     door, glanced at Islington, hesitated, and then returned to his chair.</p>
                  <p>"I did n't tell you I was married,—did I?" he said suddenly, looking up in
                     Islington's face with an unsuccessful attempt at a reckless laugh.</p>
                  <p>"No," said Islington, more pained at the manner than the words.</p>
                  <p>"Fact," said Yuba Bill. "Three years ago it was, Tommy,—three years ago!"</p>
                  <p>He looked so hard at Islington, that, feeling he was expected to say something,
                     he asked vaguely, "Who did you marry?"</p>
                  <p>"Thet's it!" said Yuba Bill; "I can't ezactly say; partikly, though, a she
                     devil! generally, the wife of half a dozen other men."</p>
                  <p>Accustomed, apparently, to have his conjugal infelicities a theme of mirth
                     among men, and seeing no trace of amusement on Islington's grave face, his
                     dogged, reckless manner softened, and, drawing his chair closer to Islington,
                     he went on: "It all began outer this: we was coming down Watson's grade one
                     night pretty free, when the expressman turns to me and sez, 'There's a row
                     inside, and you'd better pull up!' I pulls up, and out hops, first a woman, and
                     then two or three chaps swearing and cursin', and tryin' to drag some one arter
                     them. Then it 'pear'd, Tommy, thet it was this woman's drunken husband they was
                        going<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6646-00000026"/> ing to put out for abusin'
                     her, and strikin' her in the coach; and if it had n't been for me, my boy,
                     they'd hev left that chap thar in the road. But I fixes matters up by putting
                     her alongside o' me on the box, and we drove on. She was very white, Tommy,—for
                     the matter o' that, she was always one o' these very white women, that never
                     got red in the face,—but she never cried a whimper. Most wimin would have
                     cried. It was queer, but she never cried. I thought so at the time.</p>
                  <p>"She was very tall, with a lot o' light hair meandering down the back of her
                     head, as long as a deer-skin whip-lash, and about the color. She hed eyes
                     thet'd bore you through at fifty yards, and pooty hands and feet. And when she
                     kinder got out o' that stiff, narvous state she was in, and warmed up a little,
                     and got chipper, by G—d, sir, she was handsome,—she was that!"</p>
                  <p>A little flushed and embarrassed at his own enthusiasm, he stopped, and then
                     said, carelessly, "They got off at Murphy's."</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Islington.</p>
                  <p>"Well, I used to see her often arter thet, and when she was alone she allus
                     took the box-seat. She kinder confided her troubles to me, how her husband got
                     drunk and abused her; and I did n't see much o' him, for he was away in 'Frisco
                     arter thet. But it was all square, Tommy,—all square 'twixt me and her.</p>
                  <p>"I got a going there a good deal, and then one day I sez to myself, 'Bill, this
                     won't do,' and I got changed to another route. Did you ever know Jackson
                     Filltree, Tommy?" said Bill, breaking off suddenly.</p>
                  <p>"No."</p>
                  <p>"Might have heerd of him, p'r'aps?"</p>
                  <p>"No," said Islington, impatiently.</p>
                  <p>"Jackson Filltree ran the express from White's out to Summit, 'cross the North
                     Fork of the Yuba. One day he sez to me, 'Bill, that's a mighty bad ford at the
                     North Fork.' I sez, 'I believe you, Jackson.' 'It'll git me some day, Bill,
                     sure,' sez he. I sez, 'Why don't you take the lower ford?' 'I don't know,' sez
                     he, 'but I can't.' So ever after, when I met him, he sez, 'That North Fork
                     ain't got me yet.' One day I was in Sacramento, and up comes Filltree. He sez,
                     'I've sold out the express business on account of the North Fork, but it's
                     bound to get me yet, Bill, sure'; and he laughs. Two weeks after they finds his
                     body below the ford, whar he tried to cross, comin' down from the Summit way.
                     Folks said it was foolishness: Tommy, I sez it was Fate! The second day arter I
                     was changed to the Placerville route, thet woman comes outer the hotel above
                     the stage-office. Her husband, she said, was lying sick in Placerville; that's
                     what she said; but it was Fate, Tommy, Fate. Three months afterward, her
                     husband takes<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6646-00000027"/> an overdose of morphine
                     for delirium tremens, and dies. There's folks ez sez she gave it to him, but
                     it's Fate. A year after that I married her,—Fate, Tommy, Fate!</p>
                  <p>"I lived with her jest three months," he went on, after a long breath,—"three
                     months! It ain't much time for a happy man. I've seen a good deal o' hard life
                     in my day, but there was days in that three months longer than any day in my
                     life,—days, Tommy, when it was a toss-up whether I should kill her or she me.
                     But thar, I'm done. You are a young man, Tommy, and I ain't goin' to tell
                     things thet, old as I am, three years ago I could n't have believed."</p>
                  <p>When at last, with his grim face turned toward the window, he sat silently with
                     his clinched hands on his knees before him, Islington asked where his wife was
                     now.</p>
                  <p>"Ask me no more, my boy,—no more. I've said my say." With a gesture as of
                     throwing down a pair of reins before him, he rose, and walked to the
                     window.</p>
                  <p>"You kin understand, Tommy, why a little trip around the world 'ud do me good.
                     Ef you can't go with me, well and good. But go I must."</p>
                  <p>"Not before luncheon, I hope," said a very sweet voice, as Blanche Masterman
                     suddenly stood before them. "Father would never forgive me if in his absence I
                     permitted one of Mr. Islington's friends to go in this way. You will stay,
                     won't you? Do! And you will give me your arm now; and when Mr. Islington has
                     done staring, he will follow us into the dining-room and introduce you."</p>
                  <p>"I have quite fallen in love with your friend," said Miss Blanche, as they
                     stood in the drawing-room looking at the figure of Bill, strolling, with his
                     short pipe in his mouth, through the distant shrubbery. "He asks very queer
                     questions, though. He wanted to know my mother's maiden name."</p>
                  <p>"He is an honest fellow," said Islington, gravely.</p>
                  <p>"You are very much subdued. You don't thank me, I dare say, for keeping you and
                     your friend here; but you could n't go, you know, until father returned."</p>
                  <p>Islington smiled, but not very gayly.</p>
                  <p>"And then I think it much better for us to part here under these frescos, don't
                     you? Good by."</p>
                  <p>She extended her long, slim hand.</p>
                  <p>"Out in the sunlight there, when my eyes were red, you were very anxious to
                     look at me," she added, in a dangerous voice.</p>
                  <p>Islington raised his sad eyes to hers. Something glittering upon her own sweet
                     lashes trembled and fell.</p>
                  <p>"Blanche!"</p>
                  <p>She was rosy enough now, and would have withdrawn her hand, but Islington
                     detained it. She was not quite certain but that her waist was also<pb n="52-53"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000028"/> in jeopardy. Yet she could not help saying, "Are
                     you sure that there is n't anything in the way of a young woman that would keep
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>"Blanche!" said Islington in reproachful horror.</p>
                  <p>"If gentlemen will roar out their secrets before an open window, with a young
                     woman lying on a sofa on the veranda, reading a stupid French novel, they must
                     not be surprised if she gives more attention to them than her book."</p>
                  <p>"Then you know all, Blanche?"</p>
                  <p>"I know," said Blanche, "let's see—I know the partiklar style of—ahem!—fool you
                     was, and expected no better. Good by." And, gliding like a lovely and innocent
                     milk snake out of his grasp, she slipped away.</p>
                  <p>To the pleasant ripple of waves, the sound of music and light voices, the
                     yellow midsummer moon again rose over Greyport. It looked upon formless masses
                     of rock and shrubbery, wide spaces of lawn and beach, and a shimmering expanse
                     of water. It singled out particular objects,—a white sail in shore, a crystal
                     globe upon the lawn, and flashed upon something held between the teeth of a
                     crouching figure scaling the low wall of Cliffwood Lodge. Then, as a man and
                     woman passed out from under the shadows of the foliage into the open moonlight
                     of the garden path, the figure leaped from the wall, and stood erect and
                     waiting in the shadow.</p>
                  <p>It was the figure of an old man, with rolling eyes, his trembling hand grasping
                     a long, keen knife,—a figure more pitiable than pitiless, more pathetic than
                     terrible. But the next moment the knife was stricken from his hand, and he
                     struggled in the firm grasp of another figure that apparently sprang from the
                     wall beside him.</p>
                  <p>"D—n you, Masterman!" cried the old man, hoarsely; "give me fair play, and I'll
                     kill you yet!"</p>
                  <p>"Which my name is Yuba Bill," said Bill, quietly, "and it's time this d—n
                     fooling was stopped."</p>
                  <p>The old man glared in Bill's face savagely. "I know you. You're one of
                     Masterman's friends,—d—n you,—let me go till I cut his heart out,—let me go!
                     Where is my Mary?—where is my wife?—there she is! there!—there!—there! Mary!"
                     He would have screamed, but Bill placed his powerful hand upon his mouth, as he
                     turned in the direction of the old man's glance. Distinct in the moonlight the
                     figures of Islington and Blanche, arm in arm, stood out upon the garden
                     path.</p>
                  <p>"Give me my wife!" muttered the old man hoarsely, between Bill's fingers.
                     "Where is she?"</p>
                  <p>A sudden fury passed over Yuba Bill's face.</p>
                  <p>"Where is your wife?" he echoed, pressing the old man back against the garden
                     wall, and holding him<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6646-00000029"/> there as in a
                     vice. "Where is your wife?" he repeated, thrusting his grim sardonic jaw and
                     savage eyes into the old man's frightened face. "Where is Jack Adam's wife?
                     Where is MY wife? Where is the she-devil that drove one man mad, that sent
                     another to hell by his own hand, that eternally broke and ruined me? Where!
                     Where! Do you ask where? In jail in Sacramento,—in jail, do you hear?—in jail
                     for murder, Johnson,—murder!"</p>
                  <p>The old man gasped, stiffened, and then, relaxing, suddenly slipped, a mere
                     inanimate mass, at Yuba Bill's feet. With a sudden revulsion of feeling, Yuba
                     Bill dropped at his side, and, lifting him tenderly in his arms, whispered,
                     "Look up, old man, Johnson! look up, for God's sake!—it's me,—Yuba Bill! and
                     yonder is your daughter, and—Tommy!—don't you know—Tommy, little Tommy
                     Islington?"</p>
                  <p>Johnson's eyes slowly opened. He whispered, "Tommy! yes, Tommy! Sit by me,
                     Tommy. But don't sit so near the bank. Don't you see how the river is rising
                     and beckoning to me,—hissing, and boilin' over the rocks? It's gittin
                     higher!—hold me, Tommy,—hold me, and don't let me go yet. We'll live to cut his
                     heart out, Tommy,—we'll live—we'll—" His head sank, and the rushing river,
                     invisible to all eyes save his, leaped toward him out of the darkness, and bore
                     him away, no longer to the darkness, but through it to the distant, peaceful,
                     shining sea.</p>

               <head>HOW SANTA CLAUS CAME TO SIMPSON'S BAR</head>
               <p>IT had been raining in the valley of the Sacramento. The North Fork had overflowed
                  its banks and Rattlesnake Creek was impassable. The few boulders that had marked
                  the summer ford at Simpson's Crossing were obliterated by a vast sheet of water
                  stretching to the foothills. The up stage was stopped at Grangers; the last mail
                  had been abandoned in the <hi rend="i"/>tules, the rider swimming for his life.
                  "An area," remarked the "Sierra Avalanche," with pensive local pride, "as large as
                  the State of Massachusetts is now under water."</p>
               <p>Nor was the weather any better in the foothills. The mud lay deep on the mountain
                  road; wagons that neither physical force nor moral objurgation could move from the
                  evil ways into which they had fallen, encumbered the track, and the way to
                  Simpson's Bar was indicated by broken-down teams and hard swearing. And farther
                  on, cut off and inaccessible, rained upon and bedraggled, smitten by high winds
                  and threatened by high water, Simpson's Bar, on the eve of Christmas day, 1862,
                  clung like a swallow's nest to the rocky<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6646-00000030"/>
                  entablature and splintered capitals of Table Mountain, and shook in the blast.</p>
               <p>As night shut down on the settlement, a few lights gleamed through the mist from
                  the windows of cabins on either side of the highway now crossed and gullied by
                  lawless streams and swept by marauding winds. Happily most of the population were
                  gathered at Thompson's store, clustered around a red-hot stove, at which they
                  silently spat in some accepted sense of social communion that perhaps rendered
                  conversation unnecessary. Indeed, most methods of diversion had long since been
                  exhausted on Simpson's Bar; high water had suspended the regular occupations on
                  gulch and on river, and a consequent lack of money and whiskey had taken the zest
                  from most illegitimate recreation. Even Mr. Hamlin was fain to leave the Bar with
                  fifty dollars in his pocket,—the only amount actually realized of the large sums
                  won by him in the successful exercise of his arduous profession. "Ef I was asked,"
                  he remarked somewhat later,—"ef I was asked to pint out a purty little village
                  where a retired sport as did n't care for money could exercise hisself, frequent
                  and lively, I'd say Simpson's Bar; but for a young man with a large family
                  depending on his exertions, it don't pay." As Mr. Hamlin's family consisted mainly
                  of female adults, this remark is quoted rather to show the breadth of his humor
                  than the exact extent of his responsibilities.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, the unconscious objects of this satire sat that evening in the listless
                  apathy begotten of idleness and lack of excitement. Even the sudden splashing of
                  hoofs before the door did not arouse them. Dick Bullen alone paused in the act of
                  scraping out his pipe, and lifted his head, but no other one of the group
                  indicated any interest in, or recognition of, the man who entered.</p>
               <p>It was a figure familiar enough to the company, and known in Simpson's Bar as "The
                  Old Man." A man of perhaps fifty years; grizzled and scant of hair, but still
                  fresh and youthful of complexion. A face full of ready, but not very powerful
                  sympathy, with a chameleon-like aptitude for taking on the shade and color of
                  contiguous moods and feelings. He had evidently just left some hilarious
                  companions, and did not at first notice the gravity of the group, but clapped the
                  shoulder of the nearest man jocularly, and threw himself into a vacant chair.</p>
               <p>"Jest heard the best thing out, boys! Ye know Smiley, over yar,—Jim
                  Smiley,—funniest man in the Bar? Well, Jim was jest telling the richest yarn
                  about—"</p>
               <p>"Smiley's a —— fool," interrupted a gloomy voice.</p>
               <p>"A particular —— skunk," added another in sepulchral accents.</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6646-00000031"/>
               <p>A silence followed these positive statements. The Old Man glanced quickly around
                  the group. Then his face slowly changed. "That's so," he said reflectively, after
                  a pause, "certingly a sort of a skunk and suthin of a fool. In course." He was
                  silent for a moment as in painful contemplation of the unsavoriness and folly of
                  the unpopular Smiley. "Dismal weather, ain't it?" he added, now fully embarked on
                  the current of prevailing sentiment. "Mighty rough papers on the boys, and no show
                  for money this season. And tomorrow's Christmas."</p>
               <p>There was a movement among the men at this announcement, but whether of
                  satisfaction or disgust was not plain. "Yes," continued the Old Man in the
                  lugubrious tone he had, within the last few moments, unconsciously adopted,—"yes,
                  Christmas, and to-night's Christmas eve. Ye see, boys, I kinder thought—that is, I
                  sorter had an idee, jest passin' like, you know—that may be ye'd all like to come
                  over to my house to-night and have a sort of tear round. But I suppose, now, you
                  would n't? Don't feel like it, may be?" he added with anxious sympathy, peering
                  into the faces of his companions.</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't know," responded Tom Flynn with some cheerfulness. "P'r'aps we may.
                  But how about your wife, Old Man? What does <emph>she</emph> say to it?"</p>
               <p>The Old Man hesitated. His conjugal experience had not been a happy one, and the
                  fact was known to Simpson's Bar. His first wife, a delicate, pretty little woman,
                  had suffered keenly and secretly from the jealous suspicions of her husband, until
                  one day he invited the whole Bar to his house to expose her infidelity. On
                  arriving, the party found the shy, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">petite</foreign>
                  creature quietly engaged in her household duties, and retired abashed and
                  discomfited. But the sensitive woman did not easily recover from the shock of this
                  extraordinary outrage. It was with difficulty she regained her equanimity
                  sufficiently to release her lover from the closet in which he was concealed and
                  escape with him. She left a boy of three years to comfort her bereaved husband.
                  The Old Man's present wife had been his cook. She was large, loyal, and
                  aggressive.</p>
               <p>Before he could reply, Joe Dimmick suggested with great directness that it was the
                  "Old Man's house," and that, invoking the Divine Power, if the case were his own,
                  he would invite whom he pleased, even if in so doing he imperilled his salvation.
                  The Powers of Evil, he further remarked, should contend against him vainly. All
                  this delivered with a terseness and vigor lost in this necessary translation.</p>
               <p>"In course. Certainly. Thet's it," said the Old Man with a sympathetic frown.
                  "Thar's no<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6646-00000032"/> trouble about
                     <emph>thet</emph>. It's my own house, built every stick on it myself. Don't you
                  be afeard o' her, boys. She <emph>may</emph> cut up a trifle rough,—ez wimmin
                  do,—but she'll come round." Secretly the Old Man trusted to the exaltation of
                  liquor and the power of courageous example to sustain him in such an
                  emergency.</p>
               <p>As yet, Dick Bullen, the oracle and leader of Simpson's Bar, had not spoken. He
                  now took his pipe from his lips. "Old Man, how's that yer Johnny gettin' on? Seems
                  to me he did n't look so peart last time I seed him on the bluff heavin' rocks at
                  Chinamen. Did n't seem to take much interest in it. Thar was a gang of 'em by yar
                  yesterday,—drownded out up the river,—and I kinder thought o' Johnny, and how he'd
                  miss 'em! May be now, we'd be in the way ef he wus sick?"</p>
               <p>The father, evidently touched not only by this pathetic picture of Johnny's
                  deprivation, but by the considerate delicacy of the speaker, hastened to assure
                  him that Johnny was better and that a "little fun might 'liven him up." Whereupon
                  Dick arose, shook himself, and saying, "I'm ready. Lead the way, Old Man: here
                  goes," himself led the way with a leap, a characteristic howl, and darted out into
                  the night. As he passed through the outer room he caught up a blazing brand from
                  the hearth. The action was repeated by the rest of the party, closely following
                  and elbowing each other, and before the astonished proprietor of Thompson's
                  grocery was aware of the intention of his guests, the room was deserted.</p>
               <p>The night was pitchy dark. In the first gust of wind their temporary torches were
                  extinguished, and only the red brands dancing and flitting in the gloom like
                  drunken will-o'-the-wisps indicated their whereabouts. Their way led up Pine-Tree
                  Canon, at the head of which a broad, low, bark-thatched cabin burrowed in the
                  mountain-side. It was the home of the Old Man, and the entrance to the tunnel in
                  which he worked when he worked at all. Here the crowd paused for a moment, out of
                  delicate deference to their host, who came up panting in the rear.</p>
               <p>"P'r'aps ye'd better hold on a second out yer, whilst I go in and see thet things
                  is all right," said the Old Man, with an indifference he was far from feeling. The
                  suggestion was graciously accepted, the door opened and closed on the host, and
                  the crowd, leaning their backs against the wall and cowering under the eaves,
                  waited and listened.</p>
               <p>For a few moments there was no sound but the dripping of water from the eaves, and
                  the stir and rustle of wrestling boughs above them. Then the men became uneasy,
                  and whispered suggestion and suspicion passed from the one to the other. "Reckon
                  she's caved in his head the first lick!" "Decoyed him inter the tunnel and barred
                     him<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6646-00000033"/> up, likely." "Got him down and
                  sittin' on him."</p>
               <p>"Prob'ly bilin suthin to heave on us: stand clear the door, boys!" For just then
                  the latch clicked, the door slowly opened, and a voice said, "Come in out o' the
                  wet."</p>
               <p>The voice was neither that of the Old Man nor of his wife. It was the voice of a
                  small boy, its weak treble broken by that preternatural hoarseness which only
                  vagabondage and the habit of premature self-assertion can give. It was the face of
                  a small boy that looked up at theirs,—a face that might have been pretty and even
                  refined but that it was darkened by evil knowledge from within, and dirt and hard
                  experience from without. He had a blanket around his shoulders and had evidently
                  just risen from his bed. "Come in," he repeated, "and don't make no noise. The Old
                  Man's in there talking to mar," he continued, pointing to an adjacent room which
                  seemed to be a kitchen, from which the Old Man's voice came in deprecating
                  accents. "Let me be," he added, querulously, to Dick Bullen, who had caught him
                  up, blanket and all, and was affecting to toss him into the fire, "let go o' me,
                  you d—d old fool, d'ye hear?"</p>
               <p>Thus adjured, Dick Bullen lowered Johnny to the ground with a smothered laugh,
                  while the men, entering quietly, ranged themselves around a long table of rough
                  boards which occupied the centre of the room. Johnny then gravely proceeded ceeded
                  to a cupboard and brought out several articles which he deposited on the table.
                  "Thar's whiskey. And crackers. And red herons. And cheese." He took a bite of the
                  latter on his way to the table. "And sugar." He scooped up a mouthful <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> with a small and very dirty hand. "And
                  terbacker. Thar's dried appils too on the shelf, but I don't admire 'em. Appils is
                  swellin'. Thar," he concluded, "now wade in, and don't be afeard. <emph>I</emph>
                  don't mind the old woman. She don't b'long to <emph>me</emph>. S'long."</p>
               <p>He had stepped to the threshold of a small room, scarcely larger than a closet,
                  partitioned off from the main apartment, and holding in its dim recess a small
                  bed. He stood there a moment looking at the company, his bare feet peeping from
                  the blanket, and nodded.</p>
               <p>"Hello, Johnny! You ain't goin' to turn in agin, are ye?" said Dick.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I are," responded Johnny, decidedly.</p>
               <p>"Why, wot's up, old fellow?"</p>
               <p>"I'm sick."</p>
               <p>"How sick?"</p>
               <p>"I've got a fevier. And childblains. And roomatiz," returned Johnny, and vanished
                  within. After a moment's pause, he added in the dark, apparently from under the
                  bedclothes,—"And biles!"</p>
               <p>There was an embarrassing silence. The men<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6646-00000034"
                  /> looked at each other, and at the fire. Even with the appetizing banquet before
                  them, it seemed as if they might again fall into the despondency of Thompson's
                  grocery, when the voice of the Old Man, incautiously lifted, came deprecatingly
                  from the kitchen.</p>
               <p>"Certainly! Thet's so. In course they is. A gang o' lazy drunken loafers, and that
                  ar Dick Bullen's the ornariest of all. Did n't hev no more <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >sabe</foreign> than to come round yar with sickness in the house and no
                  provision. Thet's what I said: 'Bullen,' sez I, 'it's crazy drunk you are, or a
                  fool,' sez I, 'to think o' such a thing.' 'Staples,' I sez, 'be you a man,
                  Staples, and 'spect to raise h—ll under my roof and invalids lyin' round?' But
                  they would come,—they would. Thet's wot you must 'spect o' such trash as lays
                  round the Bar."</p>
               <p>A burst of laughter from the men followed this unfortunate exposure. Whether it
                  was overheard in the kitchen, or whether the Old Man's irate companion had just
                  then exhausted all other modes of expressing her contemptuous indignation, I
                  cannot say, but a back door was suddenly slammed with great violence. A moment
                  later and the Old Man reappeared, haply unconscious of the cause of the late
                  hilarious outburst, and smiled blandly.</p>
               <p>"The old woman thought she'd jest run over to Mrs McFadden's for a sociable call,"
                  he explained, with jaunty indifference, as he took a seat at the board.</p>
               <p>Oddly enough it needed this untoward incident to relieve the embarrassment that
                  was beginning to be felt by the party, and their natural audacity returned with
                  their host. I do not propose to record the convivialities of that evening. The
                  inquisitive reader will accept the statement that the conversation was
                  characterized by the same intellectual exaltation, the same cautious reverence,
                  the same fastidious delicacy, the same rhetorical precision, and the same logical
                  and coherent discourse somewhat later in the evening, which distinguish similar
                  gatherings of the masculine sex in more civilized localities and under more
                  favorable auspices. No glasses were broken in the absence of any; no liquor was
                  uselessly spilt on floor or table in the scarcity of that article.</p>
               <p>It was nearly midnight when the festivities were interrupted. "Hush," said Dick
                  Bullen, holding up his hand. It was the querulous voice of Johnny from his
                  adjacent closet: "O dad!"</p>
               <p>The Old Man arose hurriedly and disappeared in the closet. Presently he
                  reappeared. "His rheumatiz is coming on agin bad," he explained, "and he wants
                  rubbin'." He lifted the demijohn of whiskey from the table and shook it. It was
                  empty. Dick Bullen put down his tin cup with an embarrassed laugh. So did the
                  others. The<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6646-00000035"/> Old Man examined their
                  contents and said hopefully, "I reckon that's enough; he don't need much. You hold
                  on all o' you for a spell, and I'll be back"; and vanished in the closet with an
                  old flannel shirt and the whiskey. The door closed but imperfectly, and the
                  following dialogue was distinctly audible:—</p>
               <p>"Now, sonny, whar does she ache worst?"</p>
               <p>"Sometimes over yar and sometimes under yer; but it's most powerful from yer to
                  yer. Rub yer, dad."</p>
               <p>A silence seemed to indicate a brisk rubbing. Then Johnny:</p>
               <p>"Hevin' a good time out yer, dad?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sonny."</p>
               <p>"To-morrer's Chrismiss,—ain't it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sonny. How does she feel now?"</p>
               <p>"Better. Rub a little furder down. Wot's Chrismiss, anyway? Wot's it all
                  about?"</p>
               <p>"O, it's a day."</p>
               <p>This exhaustive definition was apparently satisfactory, for there was a silent
                  interval of rubbing. Presently Johnny again:</p>
               <p>"Mar sez that everywhere else but yer everybody gives things to everybody
                  Chrismiss, and then she jist waded inter you. She sez thar's a man they call Sandy
                  Claws, not a white man, you know, but a kind o' Chinemin, comes down the chimbley
                  night afore Chrismiss and gives things to chillern,—boys like me. Puts 'em in
                  their butes! Thet's what she tried to play upon me. Easy now, pop, whar are you
                  rubbin' to,—thet's a mile from the place. She jest made that up, did n't she, jest
                  to aggrewate me and you? Don't rub thar. Why, dad!"</p>
               <p>In the great quiet that seemed to have fallen upon the house the sigh of the near
                  pines and the drip of leaves without was very distinct. Johnny's voice, too, was
                  lowered as he went on, "Don't you take on now, fur I'm gettin' all right fast.
                  Wot's the boys doin' out thar?"</p>
               <p>The Old Man partly opened the door and peered through. His guests were sitting
                  there sociably enough, and there were a few silver coins and a lean buckskin purse
                  on the table. "Bettin' on suthin,—some little game or 'nother. They're all right,"
                  he replied to Johnny, and recommenced his rubbing.</p>
               <p>"I'd like to take a hand and win some money," said Johnny, reflectively, after a
                  pause.</p>
               <p>The Old Man glibly repeated what was evidently a familiar formula, that if Johnny
                  would wait until he struck it rich in the tunnel he'd have lots of money, etc.,
                  etc.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Johnny, "but you don't. And whether you strike it or I win it, it's
                  about the same. It's all luck. But it's mighty cur'o's about Chrismiss,—ain't it?
                  Why do they call it Chrismiss?"</p>
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6646-00000036"/>
               <p>Perhaps from some instinctive deference to the overhearing of his guests, or from
                  some vague sense of incongruity, the Old Man's reply was so low as to be inaudible
                  beyond the room.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Johnny, with some slight abatement of interest, "I've heerd o'
                     <emph>him</emph> before. Thar, that'll do, dad. I don't ache near so bad as I
                  did. Now wrap me tight in this yer blanket. So. Now," he added in a muffled
                  whisper, "sit down yer by me till I go asleep." To assure himself of obedience, he
                  disengaged one hand from the blanket and, grasping his father's sleeve, again
                  composed himself to rest.</p>
               <p>For some moments the Old Man waited patiently. Then the unwonted stillness of the
                  house excited his curiosity, and without moving from the bed, he cautiously opened
                  the door with his disengaged hand, and looked into the main room. To his infinite
                  surprise it was dark and deserted. But even then a smouldering log on the hearth
                  broke, and by the upspringing blaze he saw the figure of Dick Bullen sitting by
                  the dying embers.</p>
               <p>"Hello!"</p>
               <p>Dick started, rose, and came somewhat unsteadily toward him.</p>
               <p>"Whar's the boys?" said the Old Man.</p>
               <p>"Gone up the cañon on a little <foreign xml:lang="SPA">pasear</foreign>. They're
                  coming back for me in a minit. I'm waitin' round for 'em. What are you starin' at,
                  Old Man?" he added with a forced laugh; "do you think I'm drunk?"</p>
               <p>The Old Man might have been pardoned the supposition, for Dick's eyes were humid
                  and his face flushed. He loitered and lounged back to the chimney, yawned, shook
                  himself, buttoned up his coat and laughed. "Liquor ain't so plenty as that, Old
                  Man. Now don't you git up," he continued, as the Old Man made a movement to
                  release his sleeve from Johnny's hand. "Don't you mind manners. Sit jest whar you
                  be; I'm goin' in a jiffy. Thar, that's them now."</p>
               <p>There was a low tap at the door. Dick Bullen opened it quickly, nodded "Good
                  night" to his host, and disappeared. The Old Man would have followed him but for
                  the hand that still unconsciously grasped his sleeve. He could have easily
                  disengaged it: it was small, weak, and emaciated, But perhaps because it
                     <emph>was</emph> small, weak, and emaciated, he changed his mind, and, drawing
                  his chair closer to the bed, rested his head upon it. In this defenceless attitude
                  the potency of his earlier potations surprised him. The room flickered and faded
                  before his eyes, reappeared, faded again, went out, and left him—asleep.</p>
               <p>Meantime Dick Bullen, closing the door, confronted his companions. "Are you
                  ready?" said Staples. "Ready," said Dick; "what's the time?" "Past twelve," was
                  the reply; "can you make it?<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6646-00000037"/> —it's nigh
                  on fifty miles, the round trip hither and yon." "I reckon," returned Dick,
                  shortly. "Whar's the mare?" "Bill and Jack's holdin' her at the crossin'." "Let
                  'em hold on a minit longer," said Dick.</p>
               <p>He turned and re-entered the house softly. By the light of the guttering candle
                  and dying fire he saw that the door of the little room was open. He stepped toward
                  it on tiptoe and looked in. The Old Man had fallen back in his chair, snoring, his
                  helpless feet thrust out in a line with his collapsed shoulders, and his hat
                  pulled over his eyes. Beside him, on a narrow wooden bedstead, lay Johnny, muffled
                  tightly in a blanket that hid all save a strip of forehead and a few curls damp
                  with perspiration. Dick Bullen made a step forward, hesitated, and glanced over
                  his shoulder into the deserted room. Everything was quiet. With a sudden
                  resolution he parted his huge mustaches with both hands and stooped over the
                  sleeping boy. But even as he did so a mischievous blast, lying in wait, swooped
                  down the chimney, rekindled the hearth, and lit up the room with a shameless glow
                  from which Dick fled in bashful terror.</p>
               <p>His companions were already waiting for him at the crossing. Two of them were
                  struggling in the darkness with some strange misshapen bulk, which as Dick came
                  nearer took the semblance of a great yellow horse.</p>
               <p>It was the mare. She was not a pretty picture. From her Roman nose to her rising
                  haunches, from her arched spine hidden by the stiff <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >machillas</foreign> of a Mexican saddle, to her thick, straight, bony legs,
                  there was not a line of equine grace. In her half-blind but wholly vicious white
                  eyes, in her protruding under lip, in her monstrous color, there was nothing but
                  ugliness and vice.</p>
               <p>"Now then," said Staples, "stand cl'ar of her heels, boys, and up with you. Don't
                  miss your first holt of her mane, and mind ye get your off stirrup
                     <emph>quick</emph>. Ready!"</p>
               <p>There was a leap, a scrambling struggle, a bound, a wild retreat of the crowd, a
                  circle of flying hoofs, two springless leaps that jarred the earth, a rapid play
                  and jingle of spurs, a plunge, and then the voice of Dick somewhere in the
                  darkness, "All right!"</p>
               <p>"Don't take the lower road back onless you're hard pushed for time! Don't hold her
                  in down hill! We'll be at the ford at five. G' lang! Hoopa! Mula! GO!"</p>
               <p>A splash, a spark struck from the ledge in the road, a clatter in the rocky cut
                  beyond, and Dick was gone.</p>

                  Thrice had she stumbled. Twice had she thrown up her Roman nose in a straight line
                  with the reins, and, resisting bit and spur, struck out madly across country.
                  Twice had she reared, and, rearing, fallen backward; and twice had the agile Dick,
                  unharmed, regained his seat before she found her vicious legs again. And a mile
                  beyond them, at the foot of a long hill, was Rattlesnake Creek. Dick knew that
                  here was the crucial test of his ability to perform his enterprise, set his teeth
                  grimly, put his knees well into her flanks, and changed his defensive tactics to
                  brisk aggression. Bullied and maddened, Jovita began the descent of the hill. Here
                  the artful Richard pretended to hold her in with ostentatious objurgation and
                  well-feigned cries of alarm. It is unnecessary to add that Jovita instantly ran
                  away. Nor need I state the time made in the descent; it is written in the
                  chronicles of Simpson's Bar. Enough that in another moment, as it seemed to Dick,
                  she was splashing on the overflowed banks of Rattlesnake Creek. As Dick expected,
                  the momentum she had acquired carried her beyond the point of balking, and,
                  holding her well together for a mighty leap, they dashed into the middle of the
                  swiftly flowing current. A few moments of kicking, wading, and swimming, and Dick
                  drew a long breath on the opposite bank.</p>
               <p>The road from Rattlesnake Creek to Red Mountain was tolerably level. Either the
                  plunge in Rattlesnake Creek had dampened her baleful fire, or the art which led to
                  it had shown her the superior wickedness of her rider, for Jovita no longer wasted
                  her surplus energy in wanton conceits. Once she bucked, but it was from force of
                  habit; once she shied, but it was from a new freshly painted meeting-house at the
                  crossing of the county road. Hollows, ditches, gravelly deposits, patches of
                  freshly springing grasses, flew from beneath her rattling hoofs. She began to
                  smell unpleasantly, once or twice she coughed slightly, but there was no abatement
                  of her strength or speed. By two o'clock he had passed Red Mountain and begun the
                  descent to the plain. Ten minutes later the driver of the fast Pioneer coach was
                  overtaken and passed by a "man on a Pinto hoss,"—an event sufficiently notable for
                  remark. At half past two Dick rose in his stirrups with a great shout. Stars were
                  glittering through the rifted clouds, and beyond him, out of the plain, rose two
                  spires, a<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6646-00000039"/> flagstaff, and a straggling
                  line of black objects. Dick jingled his spurs and swung his <foreign
                     xml:lang="SPA">riata</foreign>, Jovita bounded forward, and in another moment
                  they swept into Tuttleville and drew up before the wooden piazza of "The Hotel of
                  All Nations."</p>
               <p>What transpired that night at Tuttleville is not strictly a part of this record.
                  Briefly. I may state, however, that after Jovita had been handed over to a sleepy
                  ostler, whom she at once kicked into unpleasant consciousness, Dick sallied out
                  with the bar-keeper for a tour of the sleeping town. Lights still gleamed from a
                  few saloons and gambling-houses; but, avoiding these, they stopped before several
                  closed shops, and by persistent tapping and judicious outcry roused the
                  proprietors from their beds, and made them unbar the doors of their magazines and
                  expose their wares. Sometimes they were met by curses, but oftener by interest and
                  some concern in their needs, and the interview was invariably concluded by a
                  drink. It was three o'clock before this pleasantry was given over, and with a
                  small waterproof bag of india-rubber strapped on his shoulders Dick returned to
                  the hotel. But here he was waylaid by Beauty,—Beauty opulent in charms, affluent
                  in dress, persuasive in speech, and Spanish in accent! In vain she repeated the
                  invitation in "Excelsior," happily scorned by all Alpine-climbing youth, and
                  rejected by this child of the Sierras,—a rejection softened in this instance by a
                  laugh and his last gold coin. And then he sprang to the saddle and dashed down the
                  lonely street and out into the lonelier plain, where presently the lights, the
                  black line of houses, the spires, and the flagstaff sank into the earth behind him
                  again and were lost in the distance.</p>
               <p>The storm had cleared away, the air was brisk and cold, the outlines of adjacent
                  landmarks were distinct, but it was half past four before Dick reached the
                  meeting-house and the crossing of the county road. To avoid the rising grade he
                  had taken a longer and more circuitous road, in whose viscid mud Jovita sank
                  fetlock deep at every bound. It was a poor preparation for a steady ascent of five
                  miles more; but Jovita, gathering her legs under her, took it with her usual
                  blind, unreasoning fury, and a half-hour later reached the long level that led to
                  Rattlesnake Creek. Another half-hour would bring him to the creek. He threw the
                  reins lightly upon the neck of the mare, chirruped to her, and began to sing.</p>
               <p>Suddenly Jovita shied with a bound that would have unseated a less practised
                  rider. Hanging to her rein was a figure that had leaped from the bank, and at the
                  same time from the road before her arose a shadowy horse and rider. "Throw up your
                  hands," commanded this second apparition, with an oath.</p>
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6646-00000040"/>
               <p>Dick felt the mare tremble, quiver, and apparently sink under him. He knew what it
                  meant and was prepared.</p>
               <p>"Stand aside, Jack Simpson, I know you, you d—d thief. Let me pass or—"</p>
               <p>He did not finish the sentence. Jovita rose straight in the air with a terrific
                  bound, throwing the figure from her bit with a single shake of her vicious head,
                  and charged with deadly malevolence down on the impediment before her. An oath, a
                  pistol-shot, horse and highwayman rolled over in the road, and the next moment
                  Jovita was a hundred yards away. But the good right arm of her rider, shattered by
                  a bullet, dropped helplessly at his side.</p>
               <p>Without slacking his speed he shifted the reins to his left hand. But a few
                  moments later he was obliged to halt and tighten the saddle-girths that had
                  slipped in the onset. This in his crippled condition took some time. He had no
                  fear of pursuit, but looking up he saw that the eastern stars were already paling,
                  and that the distant peaks had lost their ghostly whiteness, and now stood out
                  blackly against a lighter sky. Day was upon him. Then completely absorbed in a
                  single idea, he forgot the pain of his wound, and mounting again dashed on toward
                  Rattlesnake Creek. But now Jovita's breath came broken by gasps, Dick reeled in
                  his saddle, and brighter and brighter grew the sky.</p>
               <p>Ride, Richard; run, Jovita; linger, O day!</p>
               <p>For the last few rods there was a roaring in his ears. Was it exhaustion from loss
                  of blood, or what? He was dazed and giddy as he swept down the hill, and did not
                  recognize his surroundings. Had he taken the wrong road, or was this Rattlesnake
                  Creek?</p>
               <p>It was. But the brawling creek he had swam a few hours before had risen, more than
                  doubled its volume, and now rolled a swift and resistless river between him and
                  Rattlesnake Hill. For the first time that night Richard's heart sank within him.
                  The river, the mountain, the quickening east, swam before his eyes. He shut them
                  to recover his self-control. In that brief interval, by some fantastic mental
                  process, the little room at Simpson's Bar and the figures of the sleeping father
                  and son rose upon him. He opened his eyes wildly, cast off his coat, pistol,
                  boots, and saddle, bound his precious pack tightly to his shoulders, grasped the
                  bare flanks of Jovita with his bared knees, and with a shout dashed into the
                  yellow water. A cry rose from the opposite bank as the head of a man and horse
                  struggled for a few moments against the battling current, and then were swept away
                  amidst uprooted trees and whirling drift-wood.</p>
               <milestone n=".   .   .   .   ." unit="typography"/>
               <p>The Old Man started and woke. The fire on<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6646-00000041"/>
                  the hearth was dead, the candle in the outer room flickering in its socket, and
                  somebody was rapping at the door. He opened it, but fell back with a cry before
                  the dripping, half-naked figure that reeled against the doorpost.</p>
               <p>"Dick?"</p>
               <p>"Hush! Is he awake yet?"</p>
               <p>"No,—but, Dick?—"</p>
               <p>"Dry up, you old fool! Get me some whiskey <emph>quick!</emph>" The Old Man flew
                  and returned with—an empty bottle! Dick would have sworn, but his strength was not
                  equal to the occasion. He staggered, caught at the handle of the door, and
                  motioned to the Old Man.</p>
               <p>"Thar's suthin' in my pack yer for Johnny Take it off. I can't."</p>
               <p>The Old Man unstrapped the pack and laid it before the exhausted man.</p>
               <p>"Open it, quick!"</p>
               <p>He did so with trembling fingers. It contained only a few poor toys,—cheap and
                  barbaric enough, goodness knows, but bright with paint and tinsel. One of them was
                  broken; another, I fear, was irretrievably ruined by water; and on the third—ah
                  me! there was a cruel spot.</p>
               <p>"It don't look like much, that's a fact," said Dick, ruefully..... "But it's the
                  best we could do.... Take 'em, Old Man, and put 'em in his stocking, and tell
                  him—tell him, you know— hold me, Old Man—" The Old Man caught at his sinking
                  figure. "Tell him," said Dick, with a weak little laugh,—"tell him Sandy Claus has
                  come."</p>
               <p>And even so, bedraggled, ragged, unshaven, and unshorn, with one arm hanging
                  helplessly at his side, Santa Claus came to Simpson's Bar and fell fainting on the
                  first threshold. The Christmas dawn came slowly after, touching the remoter peaks
                  with the rosy warmth of ineffable love. And it looked so tenderly on Simpson's Bar
                  that the whole mountain, as if caught in a generous action, blushed to the
                  skies.</p>

               <head>THE PRINCESS BOB AND HER FRIENDS.</head>
               <p>SHE was a Klamath Indian. Her title was, I think, a compromise between her claim
                  as daughter of a chief, and gratitude to her earliest white protector, whose name,
                  after the Indian fashion, she had adopted. "Bob" Walker had taken her from the
                  breast of her dead mother at a time when the sincere volunteer soldiery of the
                  California frontier were impressed with the belief that extermination was the
                  manifest destiny of the Indian race. He had with difficulty restrained the noble
                  zeal of his compatriots long enough to convince them that the exemption of one
                  Indian baby would not invalidate this theory. And he took her to his home,—a
                  pastoral clearing on the banks of the Salmon River,—where she was cared for after
                  a frontier fashion.</p>
               <p>Before she was nine years old, she had exhausted the scant kindliness of the thin,
                  overworked Mrs. Walker. As a playfellow of the young Walkers she was unreliable;
                  as a nurse for the baby she was inefficient. She lost the former in the trackless
                  depths of a redwood forest; she basely abandoned the latter in an extemporized
                  cradle, hanging ing like a chrysalis to a convenient bough. She lied and she
                  stole,—two unpardonable sins in a frontier community, where truth was a necessity
                  and provisions were the only property. Worse than this, the outskirts of the
                  clearing were sometimes haunted by blanketed tatterdemalions with whom she had
                  mysterious confidences. Mr. Walker more than once regretted his indiscreet
                  humanity; but she presently relieved him of responsibility, and possibly of
                  bloodguiltiness, by disappearing entirely.</p>
               <p>When she reappeared, it was at the adjacent village of Logport, in the capacity of
                  housemaid to a trader's wife, who, joining some little culture to considerable
                  conscientiousness, attempted to instruct her charge. But the Princess proved an
                  unsatisfactory pupil to even so liberal a teacher. She accepted the alphabet with
                  great good-humor, but always as a pleasing and recurring novelty, in which all
                  interest expired at the completion of each lesson. She found a thousand uses for
                  her books and writing materials other than those known to civilized children. She
                  made a curious necklace of bits of slate-pencil, she constructed a miniature canoe
                  from the pasteboard covers of her primer, she bent her pens into fish-hooks, and
                  tattooed the faces of her younger companions with blue ink. Religious instruction
                  she received as good-humoredly, and learned to pronounce the<pb n="82-83"
                     xml:id="VAC6646-00000043"/> name of the Deity with a cheerful familiarity that
                  shocked her preceptress. Nor could her reverence be reached through analogy; she
                  knew nothing of the Great Spirit, and professed entire ignorance of the Happy
                  Hunting-Grounds. Yet she attended divine service regularly, and as regularly asked
                  for a hymn-book; and it was only through the discovery that she had collected
                  twenty-five of these volumes and had hidden them behind the woodpile, that her
                  connection with the First Baptist Church of Logport ceased. She would occasionally
                  abandon these civilized and Christian privileges, and disappear from her home,
                  returning after several days of absence with an odor of bark and fish, and a
                  peace-offering to her mistress in the shape of venison or game.</p>
               <p>To add to her troubles, she was now fourteen, and, according to the laws of her
                  race, a woman. I do not think the most romantic fancy would have called her
                  pretty. Her complexion defied most of those ambiguous similes through which poets
                  unconsciously apologize for any deviation from the Caucasian standard. It was not
                  wine nor amber colored; if anything, it was smoky. Her face was tattooed with red
                  and white lines on one cheek, as if a fine-toothed comb had been drawn from
                  cheek-bone to jaw, and, but for the good-humor that beamed from her small
                  berry-like eyes and shone in her white teeth, would have been repulsive. She was
                  short and stout. In her scant drapery and unrestrained freedom she was hardly
                  statuesque, and her more unstudied attitudes were marred by a simian habit of
                  softly scratching her left ankle with the toes of her right foot, in moments of
                  contemplation.</p>
               <p>I think I have already shown enough to indicate the incongruity of her existence
                  with even the low standard of civilization that obtained at Logport in the year
                  1860. It needed but one more fact to prove the far-sighted political sagacity and
                  prophetic ethics of those sincere advocates of extermination, to whose virtues I
                  have done but scant justice in the beginning of this article. This fact was
                  presently furnished by the Princess. After one of her periodical
                  disappearances,—this time unusually prolonged,—she astonished Logport by returning
                  with a half-breed baby of a week old in her arms. That night a meeting of the
                  hard-featured serious matrons of Logport was held at Mrs. Brown's. The immediate
                  banishment of the Princess was demanded. Soft-hearted Mrs. Brown endeavored vainly
                  to get a mitigation or suspension of the sentence. But, as on a former occasion,
                  the Princess took matters into her own hands. A few mornings afterwards, a wicker
                  cradle containing an Indian baby was found hanging on the handle of the door of
                  the First Baptist Church. It was the Parthian arrow of the flying<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC6646-00000044"/> Princess. From that day Logport knew her no
                  more.</p>
               <p>It had been a bright clear day on the upland, so clear that the ramparts of Fort
                  Jackson and the flagstaff were plainly visible twelve miles away from the long
                  curving peninsula that stretched a bared white arm around the peaceful waters of
                  Logport Bay. It had been a clear day upon the sea-shore, albeit the air was filled
                  with the flying spume and shifting sand of a straggling beach whose low dunes were
                  dragged down by the long surges of the Pacific and thrown up again by the
                  tumultuous trade-winds. But the sun had gone down in a bank of fleecy fog that was
                  beginning to roll in upon the beach. Gradually the headland at the entrance of the
                  harbor and the lighthouse disappeared, then the willow fringe that marked the line
                  of Salmon River vanished, and the ocean was gone. A few sails still gleamed on the
                  waters of the bay; but the advancing fog wiped them out one by one, crept across
                  the steel-blue expanse, swallowed up the white mills and single spire of Logport,
                  and, joining with reinforcements from the marshes, moved solemnly upon the hills.
                  Ten minutes more and the landscape was utterly blotted out; simultaneously the
                  wind died away, and a death-like silence stole over sea and shore. The faint
                  clang, high overhead, of unseen seen brent, the nearer call of invisible plover,
                  the lap and wash of undistinguishable waters, and the monotonous roll of the
                  vanished ocean, were the only sounds. As night deepened, the far-off booming of
                  the fog-bell on the headland at intervals stirred the thick air.</p>
               <p>Hard by the shore of the bay, and half hidden by a drifting sand-hill, stood a low
                  nondescript structure, to whose composition sea and shore had equally contributed.
                  It was built partly of logs and partly of driftwood and tarred canvas. Joined to
                  one end of the main building—the ordinary log-cabin of the settler—was the
                  half-round pilothouse of some wrecked steamer, while the other gable terminated in
                  half of a broken whale-boat. Nailed against the boat were the dried skins of wild
                  animals, and scattered about lay the flotsam and jetsam of many years'
                  gathering,—bamboo crates, casks, hatches, blocks, oars, boxes, part of a whale's
                  vertebrae, and the blades of sword-fish. Drawn up on the beach of a little cove
                  before the house lay a canoe. As the night thickened and the fog grew more dense,
                  these details grew imperceptible, and only the windows of the pilot-house, lit up
                  by a roaring fire within the hut, gleamed redly through the mist.</p>
               <p>By this fire, beneath a ship's lamp that swung from the roof, two figures were
                  seated, a man and a woman. The man, broad-shouldered and heavily<pb n="86-87"
                     xml:id="VAC6646-00000045"/> ily bearded, stretched his listless powerful length
                  beyond a broken bamboo chair, with his eyes fixed on the fire. The woman crouched
                  cross-legged upon the broad earthen hearth, with her eyes blinkingly fixed on her
                  companion. They were small, black, round, berry-like eyes, and as the firelight
                  shone upon her smoky face, with its one striped cheek of gorgeous brilliancy, it
                  was plainly the Princess Bob and no other.</p>
               <p>Not a word was spoken. They had been sitting thus for more than an hour, and there
                  was about their attitude a suggestion that silence was habitual. Once or twice the
                  man rose and walked up and down the narrow room, or gazed absently from the
                  windows of the pilot-house, but never by look or sign betrayed the slightest
                  consciousness of his companion. At such times the Princess from her nest by the
                  fire followed him with eyes of canine expectancy and wistfulness. But he would as
                  inevitably return to his contemplation of the fire, and the Princess to her
                  blinking watchfulness of his face.</p>
               <p>They had sat there silent and undisturbed for many an evening in fair weather and
                  foul. They had spent many a day in sunshine and storm, gathering the unclaimed
                  spoil of sea and shore. They had kept these mute relations, varied only by the
                  incidents of the hunt or meagre household duties, for three years, ever since the
                  man, wandering dering moodily over the lonely sands, had fallen upon the
                  half-starved woman lying in the little hollow where she had crawled to die. It had
                  seemed as if they would never be disturbed, until now, when the Princess started,
                  and, with the instinct of her race, bent her ear to the ground.</p>
               <p>The wind had risen and was rattling the tarred canvas. But in another moment there
                  plainly came from without the hut the sound of voices. Then followed a rap at the
                  door; then another rap; and then, before they could rise to their feet, the door
                  was flung briskly open.</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon," said a pleasant but somewhat decided contralto voice, "but I
                  don't think you heard me knock. Ah, I see you did not. May I come in?"</p>
               <p>There was no reply. Had the battered figurehead of the Goddess of Liberty, which
                  lay deeply embedded in the sand on the beach, suddenly appeared at the door
                  demanding admittance, the occupants of the cabin could not have been more
                  speechlessly and hopelessly astonished than at the form which stood in the open
                  doorway.</p>
               <p>It was that of a slim, shapely, elegantly dressed young woman. A scarlet-lined
                  silken hood was half thrown back from the shining mass of the black hair that
                  covered her small head; from her pretty shoulders dropped a fur cloak, only
                     restrained<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6646-00000046"/> strained by a cord and
                  tassel in her small gloved hand. Around her full throat was a double necklace of
                  large white beads, that by some cunning feminine trick relieved with its infantile
                  suggestion the strong decision of her lower face.</p>
               <p>"Did you say yes? Ah, thank you. We may come in, Barker." (Here a shadow in a blue
                  army overcoat followed her into the cabin, touched its cap respectfully, and then
                  stood silent and erect against the wall.) "Don't disturb yourself in the least, I
                  beg. What a distressingly unpleasant night! Is this your usual climate?"</p>
               <p>Half graciously, half absently overlooking the still embarrassed silence of the
                  group, she went on: "We started from the fort over three hours ago,—three hours
                  ago, wasn't it, Barker?" (the erect Barker touched his cap,)—"to go to Captain
                  Emmons's quarters on Indian Island,—I think you call it Indian Island, don't you?"
                  (she was appealing to the awe-stricken Princess,)—"and we got into the fog and
                  lost our way; that is, Barker lost his way," (Barker touched his cap
                  deprecatingly,) "and goodness knows where we didn't wander to 'until we mistook
                  your light for the lighthouse and pulled up here. No, no, pray keep your seat, do!
                  Really I must insist."</p>
               <p>Nothing could exceed the languid grace of the latter part of this speech,—nothing
                  except the easy unconsciousness with which she glided by the offered chair of her
                  stammering, embarrassed host and stood beside the open hearth.</p>
               <p>"Barker will tell you," she continued, warming her feet by the fire, "that I am
                  Miss Portfire, daughter of Major Portfire, commanding the post. Ah, excuse me,
                  child!" (She had accidentally trodden upon the bare yellow toes of the Princess.)
                  "Really, I did not know you were there. I am very near-sighted." (In confirmation
                  of her statement, she put to her eyes a dainty double eyeglass that dangled from
                  her neck.) "It's a shocking thing to be near-sighted, is n't it?"</p>
               <p>If the shamefaced uneasy man to whom this remark was addressed could have found
                  words to utter the thought that even in his confusion struggled uppermost in his
                  mind, he would, looking at the bold, dark eyes that questioned him, have denied
                  the fact. But he only stammered, "Yes." The next moment, however, Miss Portfire
                  had apparently forgotten him and was examining the Princess through her glass.</p>
               <p>"And what is your name, child?"</p>
               <p>The Princess, beatified by the eyes and eyeglass, showed all her white teeth at
                  once, and softly scratched her leg.</p>
               <p>"Bob."</p>
               <p>"Bob? What a singular name!"</p>
               <p>Miss Portfire's host here hastened to explain the origin of the Princess's
                  title.</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6646-00000047"/>
               <p>"Then <emph>you</emph> are Bob." (Eye-glass.)</p>
               <p>"No, my name is Grey,—John Grey." And he actually achieved a bow where awkwardness
                  was rather the air of imperfectly recalling a forgotten habit.</p>
               <p>"Grey?—ah, let me see. Yes, certainly. You are Mr. Grey the recluse, the hermit,
                  the philosopher, and all that sort of thing. Why, certainly; Dr. Jones, our
                  surgeon, has told me all about you. Dear me, how interesting a rencontre! Lived
                  all alone here for seven—was it seven years?—yes, I remember now. Existed quite
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au naturel</foreign>, one might say. How odd! Not that
                  I know anything about that sort of thing, you know. I've lived always among
                  people, and am really quite a stranger, I assure you. But honestly, Mr.—I beg your
                  pardon—Mr. Grey, how do you like it?"</p>
               <p>She had quietly taken his chair and thrown her cloak and hood over its back, and
                  was now thoughtfully removing her gloves. Whatever were the arguments,—and they
                  were doubtless many and profound,—whatever the experience,—and it was doubtless
                  hard and satisfying enough,—by which this unfortunate man had justified his life
                  for the last seven years, somehow they suddenly became trivial and terribly
                  ridiculous before this simple but practical question.</p>
               <p>"Well, you shall tell me all about it after you have given me something to eat. We
                  will have time enough; Barker cannot find his way back in this fog to-night. Now
                  don't put yourselves to any trouble on my account. Barker will assist."</p>
               <p>Barker came forward. Glad to escape the scrutiny of his guest, the hermit gave a
                  few rapid directions to the Princess in her native tongue, and disappeared in the
                  shed. Left a moment alone, Miss Portfire took a quick, half-audible, feminine
                  inventory of the cabin. "Books, guns, skins, <emph>one</emph> chair,
                     <emph>one</emph> bed, no pictures, and no looking-glass!" She took a book from
                  the swinging shelf and resumed her seat by the fire as the Princess re-entered
                  with fresh fuel. But while kneeling on the hearth the Princess chanced to look up
                  and met Miss Portfire's dark eyes over the edge of her book.</p>
               <p>"Bob!"</p>
               <p>The Princess showed her teeth.</p>
               <p>"Listen. Would you like to have fine clothes, rings, and beads like these, to have
                  your hair nicely combed and put up so? Would you?"</p>
               <p>The Princess nodded violently.</p>
               <p>"Would you like to live with me and have them? Answer quickly. Don't look round
                  for <emph>him</emph>. Speak for yourself. Would you? Hush; never mind now."</p>
               <p>The hermit re-entered, and the Princess, blinking<pb n="92-93"
                     xml:id="VAC6646-00000048"/> ing, retreated into the shadow of the whale-boat
                  shed, from which she did not emerge even when the homely repast of cold venison,
                  ship biscuit, and tea was served. Miss Portfire noticed her absence: "You really
                  must not let me interfere with your usual simple ways. Do you know this is
                  exceedingly interesting to me, so pastoral and patriarchal and all that sort of
                  thing. I must insist upon the Princess coming back; really, I must."</p>
               <p>But the Princess was not to be found in the shed, and Miss Portfire, who the next
                  minute seemed to have forgotten all about her, took her place in the single chair
                  before an extemporized table. Barker stood behind her, and the hermit leaned
                  against the fireplace. Miss Portfire's appetite did not come up to her
                  protestations. For the first time in seven years it occurred to the hermit that
                  his ordinary victual might be improved. He stammered out something to that
                  effect.</p>
               <p>"I have eaten better, and worse," said Miss Portfire, quietly.</p>
               <p>"But I thought you—that is, you said—"</p>
               <p>"I spent a year in the hospitals, when father was on the Potomac," returned Miss
                  Portfire, composedly: After a pause she continued: "You remember after the second
                  Bull Run—But, dear me! I beg your pardon; of course, you know nothing about the
                  war and all that sort of thing, and don't care." (She put up her eye-glass and
                  quietly surveyed his broad muscular figure against the chimney.) "Or, perhaps,
                  your prejudices—But then, as a hermit you know you have no politics, of course.
                  Please don't let me bore you."</p>
               <p>To have been strictly consistent, the hermit should have exhibited no interest in
                  this topic. Perhaps it was owing to some quality in the narrator, but he was
                  constrained to beg her to continue in such phrases as his unfamiliar lips could
                  command. So that, little by little, Miss Portfire yielded up incident and personal
                  observation of the contest then raging; with the same half-abstracted,
                  half-unconcerned air that seemed habitual to her, she told the stories of
                  privation, of suffering, of endurance, and of sacrifice. With the same assumption
                  of timid deference that concealed her great self-control, she talked of principles
                  and rights. Apparently without enthusiasm and without effort, of which his morbid
                  nature would have been suspicious, she sang the great American Iliad in a way that
                  stirred the depths of her solitary auditor to its massive foundations. Then she
                  stopped and asked quietly, "Where is Bob?"</p>
               <p>The hermit started. He would look for her. But Bob, for some reason, was not
                  forthcoming. Search was made within and without the hut, but in vain. For the
                  first time that evening Miss<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6646-00000049"/> Portfire
                  showed some anxiety. "Go," she said to Barker, "and find her. She
                     <emph>must</emph> be found; stay, give me your overcoat, I'll go myself." She
                  threw the overcoat over her shoulders and stepped out into the night. In the thick
                  veil of fog that seemed suddenly to inwrap her, she stood for a moment irresolute,
                  and then walked toward the beach, guided by the low wash of waters on the sand.
                  She had not taken many steps before she stumbled over some dark crouching object.
                  Reaching down her hand she felt the coarse wiry mane of the Princess.</p>
               <p>"Bob!"</p>
               <p>There was no reply.</p>
               <p>"Bob. I've been looking for you, come."</p>
               <p>"Go 'way."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Bob. I want you to stay with me to-night, come."</p>
               <p>"Injin squaw no good for waugee woman. Go 'way."</p>
               <p>"Listen, Bob. You are daughter of a chief: so am I. Your father had many warriors:
                  so has mine. It is good that you stay with me. Come."</p>
               <p>The Princess chuckled and suffered herself to be lifted up. A few moments later
                  and they reentered the hut, hand in hand.</p>
               <p>With the first red streaks of dawn the next day the erect Barker touched his cap
                  at the door of the hut. Beside him stood the hermit, also just risen from his
                  blanketed nest in the sand. Forth from the hut, fresh as the morning air, stepped
                  Miss Portfire, leading the Princess by the hand. Hand in hand also they walked to
                  the shore, and when the Princess had been safely bestowed in the stern sheets,
                  Miss Portfire turned and held out her own to her late host.</p>
               <p>"I shall take the best of care of her, of course. You will come and see her often.
                  I should ask you to come and see me, but you are a hermit, you know, and all that
                  sort of thing. But if it's the correct anchorite thing, and can be done, my father
                  will be glad to requite you for this night's hospitality. But don't do anything on
                  my account that interferes with your simple habits. Good by."</p>
               <p>She handed him a card, which he took mechanically.</p>
               <p>"Good by."</p>
               <p>The sail was hoisted, and the boat shoved off. As the fresh morning breeze caught
                  the white canvas it seemed to bow a parting salutation. There was a rosy flush of
                  promise on the water, and as the light craft darted forward toward the ascending
                  sun, it seemed for a moment uplifted in its glory.</p>
               <p>Miss Portfire kept her word. If thoughtful care and intelligent kindness could
                  regenerate the<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6646-00000050"/> Princess, her future was
                  secure. And it really seemed as if she were for the first time inclined to heed
                  the lessons of civilization and profit by her new condition. An agreeable change
                  was first noticed in her appearance. Her lawless hair was caught in a net, and no
                  longer strayed over her low forehead. Her unstable bust was stayed and upheld by
                  French corsets; her plantigrade shuffle was limited by heeled boots. Her dresses
                  were neat and clean, and she wore a double necklace of glass beads. With this
                  physical improvement there also seemed some moral awakening. She no longer stole
                  nor lied. With the possession of personal property came a respect for that of
                  others. With increased dependence on the word of those about her came a thoughtful
                  consideration of her own. Intellectually she was still feeble, although she
                  grappled sturdily with the simple lessons which Miss Portfire set before her. But
                  her zeal and simple vanity outran her discretion, and she would often sit for
                  hours with an open book before her, which she could not read. She was a favorite
                  with the officers at the fort, from the Major, who shared his daughter's
                  prejudices and often yielded to her powerful self-will, to the subalterns, who
                  liked her none the less that their natural enemies, the frontier volunteers, had
                  declared war against her helpless sisterhood. The only restraint put upon her was
                  the limitation of her liberty erty to the enclosure of the fort and parade; and
                  only once did she break this parole, and was stopped by the sentry as she stepped
                  into a boat at the landing.</p>
               <p>The recluse did not avail himself of Miss Portfire's invitation. But after the
                  departure of the Princess he spent less of his time in the hut, and was more
                  frequently seen in the distant marshes of Eel River and on the upland hills. A
                  feverish restlessness, quite opposed to his usual phlegm, led him into singular
                  freaks strangely inconsistent with his usual habits and reputation. The purser of
                  the occasional steamer which stopped at Logport with the mails reported to have
                  been boarded, just inside the bar, by a strange bearded man, who asked for a
                  newspaper containing the last war telegrams. He tore his red shirt into narrow
                  strips, and spent two days with his needle over the pieces and the tattered
                  remnant of his only white garment; and a few days afterward the fishermen on the
                  bay were surprised to see what, on nearer approach, proved to be a rude imitation
                  of the national flag floating from a spar above the hut.</p>
               <p>One evening, as the fog began to drift over the sand-hills, the recluse sat alone
                  in his hut. The fire was dying unheeded on the hearth, for he had been sitting
                  there for a long time, completely absorbed in the blurred pages of an old
                     newspaper.<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6646-00000051"/> Presently he arose, and,
                  refolding it,—an operation of great care and delicacy in its tattered
                  condition,—placed it under the blankets of his bed. He resumed his seat by the
                  fire, but soon began drumming with his fingers on the arm of his chair. Eventually
                  this assumed the time and accent of some air. Then he began to whistle softly and
                  hesitatingly, as if trying to recall a forgotten tune. Finally this took shape in
                  a rude resemblance, not unlike that which his flag bore to the national standard,
                  to Yankee Doodle. Suddenly he stopped.</p>
               <p>There was an unmistakable rapping at the door. The blood which had at first rushed
                  to his face now forsook it and settled slowly around his heart. He tried to rise,
                  but could not. Then the door was flung open, and a figure with a scarlet-lined
                  hood and fur mantle stood on the threshold. With a mighty effort he took one
                  stride to the door. The next moment he saw the wide mouth and white teeth of the
                  Princess, and was greeted by a kiss that felt like a baptism.</p>
               <p>To tear the hood and mantle from her figure in the sudden fury that seized him,
                  and to fiercely demand the reason of this masquerade, was his only return to her
                  greeting. "Why are you here? did you steal these garments?" he again demanded in
                  her guttural language, as he shook her roughly by the arm. The Princess hung her
                  head. "Did you?" he screamed, as he reached wildly for his rifle.</p>
               <p>"I did."</p>
               <p>His hold relaxed, and he staggered back against the wall. The Princess began to
                  whimper. Between her sobs, she was trying to explain that the Major and his
                  daughter were going away, and that they wanted to send her to the Reservation; but
                  he cut her short. "Take off those things!" The Princess tremblingly obeyed. He
                  rolled them up, placed them in the canoe she had just left, and then leaped into
                  the frail craft. She would have followed, but with a great oath he threw her from
                  him, and with one stroke of his paddle swept out into the fog, and was gone.</p>
               <p>"Jessamy," said the Major, a few days after, as he sat at dinner with his
                  daughter, "I think I can tell you something to match the mysterious disappearance
                  and return of your wardrobe. Your crazy friend, the recluse, has enlisted this
                  morning in the Fourth Artillery. He's a splendid-looking animal, and there's the
                  right stuff for a soldier in him, if I'm not mistaken. He's in earnest too, for he
                  enlists in the regiment ordered back to Washington. Bless me, child, another
                  goblet broken; you'll ruin the mess in glassware, at this rate!"</p>
               <p>"Have you heard anything more of the Princess, papa?"</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6646-00000052"/>
               <p>"Nothing, but perhaps it's as well that she has gone. These cursed settlers are at
                  their old complaints again about what they call 'Indian depredations,' and I have
                  just received orders from head-quarters to keep the settlement clear of all
                  vagabond aborigines. I am afraid, my dear, that a strict construction of the term
                  would include your <foreign xml:lang="FRA">protégeé</foreign>."</p>
               <p>The time for the departure of the Fourth Artillery had come. The night before was
                  thick and foggy. At one o'clock, a shot on the ramparts called out the guard and
                  roused the sleeping garrison. The new sentry, Private Grey, had challenged a dusky
                  figure creeping on the glacis, and, receiving no answer, had fired. The guard sent
                  out presently returned, bearing a lifeless figure in their arms. The new sentry's
                  zeal, joined with an ex-frontiersman's aim, was fatal.</p>
               <p>They laid the helpless, ragged form before the guard-house door, and then saw for
                  the first time that it was the Princess. Presently she opened her eyes. They fell
                  upon the agonized face of her innocent slayer, but haply without intelligence or
                  reproach.</p>
               <p>"Georgy!" she whispered.</p>
               <p>"Bob!"</p>
               <p>"All's same now. Me get plenty well soon. Me make no more fuss. Me go to
                  Reservation."</p>
               <p>Then she stopped, a tremor ran through her limbs, and she lay still. She had gone
                  to the Reservation. Not that devised by the wisdom of man, but that one set apart
                  from the foundation of the world for the wisest as well as the meanest of His
                  creatures.</p>

               <head>THE ILIAD OF SANDY BAR.</head>
               <p>BEFORE nine o'clock it was pretty well known all along the river that the two
                  partners of the "Amity Claim" had quarrelled and separated at daybreak. At that
                  time the attention of their nearest neighbor had been attracted by the sounds of
                  altercations and two consecutive pistol-shots. Running out, he had seen, dimly, in
                  the gray mist that rose from the river, the tall form of Scott, one of the
                  partners, descending the hill toward the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">cañon;</foreign>
                  a moment later, York, the other partner, had appeared from the cabin, and walked
                  in an opposite direction toward the river, passing within a few feet of the
                  curious watcher. Later it was discovered that a serious Chinaman, cutting wood
                  before the cabin, had witnessed part of the quarrel. But John was stolid,
                  indifferent, and reticent. "Me choppee wood, me no fightee," was his serene
                  response to all anxious queries. "But what did they <emph>say</emph>, John?" John
                  did not <foreign xml:lang="SPA">sabe</foreign>. Colonel Starbottle deftly ran over
                  the various popular epithets which a generous public sentiment might accept as
                  reasonable provocation for an assault. But John did not recognize them. "And this
                  yer's the cattle tle," said the Colonel, with some severity, "that some thinks
                  oughter be allowed to testify ag'in' a White Man! Git—you heathen!"</p>
               <p>Still the quarrel remained inexplicable. That two men, whose amiability and grave
                  tact had earned for them the title of "The Peacemakers," in a community not
                  greatly given to the passive virtues,—that these men, singularly devoted to each
                  other, should suddenly and violently quarrel, might well excite the curiosity of
                  the camp. A few of the more inquisitive visited the late scene of conflict, now
                  deserted by its former occupants. There was no trace of disorder or confusion in
                  the neat cabin. The rude table was arranged as if for breakfast; the pan of yellow
                  biscuit still sat upon that hearth whose dead embers might have typified the evil
                  passions that had raged there but an hour before. But Colonel Starbottle's
                  eye—albeit somewhat bloodshot and rheumy—was more intent on practical details. On
                  examination, a bullet-hole was found in the doorpost, and another, nearly
                  opposite, in the casing of the window. The Colonel called attention to the fact
                  that the one "agreed with" the bore of Scott's revolver, and the other with that
                  of York's derringer. "They must hev stood about yer," said the Colonel, taking
                  position; "not mor'n three feet apart, and—missed!" There was a fine touch of
                  pathos in the falling inflection of the Colonel's voice,<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC6646-00000054"/> which was not without effect. A delicate perception
                  of wasted opportunity thrilled his auditors.</p>
               <p>But the Bar was destined to experience a greater disappointment. The two
                  antagonists had not met since the quarrel, and it was vaguely rumored that, on the
                  occasion of a second meeting, each had determined to kill the other "on sight."
                  There was, consequently, some excitement—and, it is to be feared, no little
                  gratification—when, at ten o'clock, York stepped from the Magnolia Saloon into the
                  one long straggling street of the camp, at the same moment that Scott left the
                  blacksmith's shop at the forks of the road. It was evident, at a glance, that a
                  meeting could only be avoided by the actual retreat of one or the other.</p>
               <p>In an instant the doors and windows of the adjacent saloons were filled with
                  faces. Heads unaccountably appeared above the river-banks and from behind
                  bowlders. An empty wagon at the cross-road was suddenly crowded with people, who
                  seemed to have sprung from the earth. There was much running and confusion on the
                  hillside. On the mountain-road, Mr. Jack Hamlin had reined up his horse, and was
                  standing upright on the seat of his buggy. And the two objects of this absorbing
                  attention approached each other.</p>
               <p>"York's got the sun," "Scott 'll line him on that tree," "He's waitin' to draw his
                  fire," came from the cart; and then it was silent. But above this human
                  breathlessness the river rushed and sang, and the wind rustled the tree-tops with
                  an indifference that seemed obtrusive. Colonel Starbottle felt it, and in a moment
                  of sublime preoccupation, without looking around, waved his cane behind him,
                  warningly to all nature, and said, "Shu!"</p>
               <p>The men were now within a few feet of each other. A hen ran across the road before
                  one of them. A feathery seed-vessel, wafted from a wayside tree, fell at the feet
                  of the other. And, unheeding this irony of nature, the two opponents came nearer,
                  erect and rigid, looked in each other's eyes, and—passed!</p>
               <p>Colonel Starbottle had to be lifted from the cart. "This yer camp is played out,"
                  he said, gloomily, as he affected to be supported into the Magnolia. With what
                  further expression he might have indicated his feelings it was impossible to say,
                  for at that moment Scott joined the group. "Did you speak to me?" he asked of the
                  Colonel, dropping his hand, as if with accidental familiarity, on that gentleman's
                  shoulder. The Colonel, recognizing some occult quality in the touch, and some
                  unknown quantity in the glance of his questioner, contented himself by replying,
                  "No, sir," with dignity. A few rods away, York's conduct was as<pb n="106-107"
                     xml:id="VAC6646-00000055"/> characteristic and peculiar. "You had a mighty fine
                  chance; why did n't you plump him?" said Jack Hamlin, as York drew near the buggy.
                  "Because I hate him," was the reply, heard only by Jack. Contrary to popular
                  belief, this reply was not hissed between the lips of the speaker, but was said in
                  an ordinary tone. But Jack Hamlin. who was an observer of mankind, noticed that
                  the speaker's hands were cold, and his lips dry, as he helped him into the buggy,
                  and accepted the seeming paradox with a smile.</p>
               <p>When Sandy Bar became convinced that the quarrel between York and Scott could not
                  be settled after the usual local methods, it gave no further concern thereto. But
                  presently it was rumored that the "Amity Claim" was in litigation, and that its
                  possession would be expensively disputed by each of the partners. As it was well
                  known that the claim in question was "worked out" and worthless, and that the
                  partners, whom it had already enriched, had talked of abandoning it but a day or
                  two before the quarrel, this proceeding could only be accounted for as gratuitous
                  spite. Later, two San Francisco lawyers made their appearance in this guileless
                  Arcadia, and were eventually taken into the saloons, and—what was pretty much the
                  same thing—the confidences of the inhabitants. The results of this unhallowed
                  intimacy were many subpoenas; and, indeed, when the "Amity Claim" came to trial,
                  all of Sandy Bar that was not in compulsory attendance at the county seat came
                  there from curiosity. The gulches and ditches for miles around were deserted. I do
                  not propose to describe that already famous trial. Enough that, in the language of
                  the plaintiff's counsel, "it was one of no ordinary significance, involving the
                  inherent rights of that untiring industry which had developed the Pactolian
                  resources of this golden land"; and, in the homelier phrase of Colonel Starbottle,
                  "A fuss that gentlemen might hev settled in ten minutes over a social glass, ef
                  they meant business; or in ten seconds with a revolver, ef they meant fun." Scott
                  got a verdict, from which York instantly appealed. It was said that he had sworn
                  to spend his last dollar in the struggle.</p>
               <p>In this way Sandy Bar began to accept the enmity of the former partners as a
                  lifelong feud, and the fact that they had ever been friends was forgotten. The few
                  who expected to learn from the trial the origin of the quarrel were disappointed.
                  Among the various conjectures, that which ascribed some occult feminine influence
                  as the cause was naturally popular, in a camp given to dubious compliment of the
                  sex. "My word for it, gentlemen," said Colonel Starbottle, who had been known in
                  Sacramento as a Gentleman of the<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6646-00000056"/> Old
                  School, "there's some lovely creature at the bottom of this." The gallant Colonel
                  then proceeded to illustrate his theory, by divers sprightly stories, such as
                  Gentlemen of the Old School are in the habit of repeating, but which, from
                  deference to the prejudices of gentlemen of a more recent school, I refrain from
                  transcribing here. But it would appear that even the Colonel's theory was
                  fallacious. The only woman who personally might have exercised any influence over
                  the partners was the pretty daughter of "old man Folinsbee," of Poverty Flat, at
                  whose hospitable house—which exhibited some comforts and refinements rare in that
                  crude civilization—both York and Scott were frequent visitors. Yet into this
                  charming retreat York strode one evening, a month after the quarrel, and,
                  beholding Scott sitting there, turned to the fair hostess with the abrupt query,
                  "Do you love this man?" The young woman thus addressed returned that answer—at
                  once spirited and evasive—which would occur to most of my fair readers in such an
                  exigency. Without another word, York left the house. "Miss Jo" heaved the least
                  possible sigh as the door closed on York's curls and square shoulders, and then,
                  like a good girl, turned to her insulted guest. "But would you believe it, dear?"
                  she afterward related to an intimate friend, "the other creature, after glowering
                  at me for a moment, got upon its hind legs, took its hat, and left, too; and
                  that's the last I've seen of either."</p>
               <p>The same hard disregard of all other interests or feelings in the gratification of
                  their blind rancor characterized all their actions. When York purchased the land
                  below Scott's new claim, and obliged the latter, at a great expense, to make a
                  long detour to carry a "tail-race" around it, Scott retaliated by building a dam
                  that overflowed York's claim on the river. It was Scott, who, in conjunction with
                  Colonel Starbottle, first organized that active opposition to the Chinamen, which
                  resulted in the driving off of York's Mongolian laborers; it was York who built
                  the wagon-road and established the express which rendered Scott's mules and
                  pack-trains obsolete; it was Scott who called into life the Vigilance Committee
                  which expatriated York's friend, Jack Hamlin; it was York who created the "Sandy
                  Bar Herald," which characterized the act as "a lawless outrage," and Scott as a
                  "Border Ruffian"; it was Scott, at the head of twenty masked men, who, one
                  moonlight night, threw the offending "forms" into the yellow river, and scattered
                  the types in the dusty road. These proceedings were received in the distant and
                  more civilized outlying towns as vague indications of progress and vitality. I
                  have before me a copy of the "Poverty Flat Pioneer," for the week ending August
                  12, 1856, in which the editor,<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6646-00000057"/> under
                  the head of "County Improvements," says: "The new Presbyterian Church on C Street,
                  at Sandy Bar, is completed. It stands upon the lot formerly occupied by the
                  Magnolia Saloon, which was so mysteriously burnt last month. The temple, which now
                  rises like a Phoenix from the ashes of the Magnolia, is virtually the free gift of
                  H. J. York, Esq., of Sandy Bar, who purchased the lot and donated the lumber.
                  Other buildings are going up in the vicinity, but the most noticeable is the
                  'Sunny South Saloon,' erected by Captain Mat. Scott, nearly opposite the church.
                  Captain Scott has spared no expense in the furnishing of this saloon, which
                  promises to be one of the most agreeable places of resort in old Tuolumne. He has
                  recently imported two new, first-class billiard-tables, with cork cushions. Our
                  old friend, 'Mountain Jimmy,' will dispense liquors at the bar. We refer our
                  readers to the advertisement in another column. Visitors to Sandy Bar cannot do
                  better than give 'Jimmy' a call." Among the local items occurred the following:
                  "H. J. York, Esq., of Sandy Bar, has offered a reward of $100 for the detection of
                  the parties who hauled away the steps of the new Presbyterian Church, C Street,
                  Sandy Bar, during divine service on Sabbath evening last. Captain Scott adds
                  another hundred for the capture of the miscreants who broke the magnificent
                  plate-glass windows of the new saloon on the following evening. There is some talk
                  of reorganizing the old Vigilance Committee at Sandy Bar."</p>
               <p>When, for many months of cloudless weather, the hard, unwinking sun of Sandy Bar
                  had regularly gone down on the unpacified wrath of these men, there was some talk
                  of mediation. In particular, the pastor of the church to which I have just
                  referred—a sincere, fearless, but perhaps not fully enlightened man—seized gladly
                  upon the occasion of York's liberality to attempt to reunite the former partners.
                  He preached an earnest sermon on the abstract sinfulness of discord and rancor.
                  But the excellent sermons of the Rev. Mr. Daws were directed to an ideal
                  congregation that did not exist at Sandy Bar,—a congregation of beings of unmixed
                  vices and virtues, of single impulses, and perfectly logical motives, of
                  preternatural simplicity, of childlike faith, and grown-up responsibilities. As,
                  unfortunately, the people who actually attended Mr. Daws's church were mainly very
                  human, somewhat artful, more self-excusing than self-accusing, rather
                  good-natured, and decidedly weak, they quietly shed that portion of the sermon
                  which referred to themselves, and, accepting York and Scott—who were both in
                  defiant attendance—as curious examples of those ideal beings above referred to,
                  felt a certain satisfaction—which, I fear, was not altogether Christian-like<pb
                     n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6646-00000058"/> —in their "raking-down." If Mr. Daws
                  expected York and Scott to shake hands after the sermon, he was disappointed. But
                  he did not relax his purpose. With that quiet fearlessness and determination which
                  had won for him the respect of men who were too apt to regard piety as synonymous
                  with effeminacy, he attacked Scott in his own house. What he said has not been
                  recorded, but it is to be feared that it was part of his sermon. When he had
                  concluded, Scott looked at him, not unkindly, over the glasses of his bar, and
                  said, less irreverently than the words might convey, "Young man, I rather like
                  your style; but when you know York and me as well as you do God Almighty, it 'll
                  be time to talk."</p>
               <p>And so the feud progressed; and so, as in more illustrious examples, the private
                  and personal enmity of two representative men led gradually to the evolution of
                  some crude, half-expressed principle or belief. It was not long before it was made
                  evident that those beliefs were identical with certain broad principles laid down
                  by the founders of the American Constitution, as expounded by the statesmanlike
                  A.; or were the fatal quicksands, on which the ship of state might be wrecked,
                  warningly pointed out by the eloquent B. The practical result of all which was the
                  nomination of York and Scott to represent the opposite factions of Sandy Bar in
                  legislative councils.</p>
               <p>For some weeks past, the voters of Sandy Bar and the adjacent camps had been
                  called upon, in large type, to "RALLY!" In vain the great pines at the
                  cross-roads—whose trunks were compelled to bear this and other legends—moaned and
                  protested from their windy watch-towers. But one day, with fife and drum, and
                  flaming transparency, a procession filed into the triangular grove at the head of
                  the gulch. The meeting was called to order by Colonel Starbottle, who, having once
                  enjoyed legislative functions, and being vaguely known as a "war-horse," was
                  considered to be a valuable partisan of York. He concluded an appeal for his
                  friend, with an enunciation of principles, interspersed with one or two anecdotes
                  so gratuitously coarse that the very pines might have been moved to pelt him with
                  their cast-off cones, as he stood there. But he created a laugh, on which his
                  candidate rode into popular notice; and when York rose to speak, he was greeted
                  with cheers. But, to the general astonishment, the new speaker at once launched
                  into bitter denunciation of his rival. He not only dwelt upon Scott's deeds and
                  example, as known to Sandy Bar, but spoke of facts connected with his previous
                  career, hitherto unknown to his auditors. To great precision of epithet and
                  directness of statement, the speaker added the fascination of revelation and
                  exposure. The crowd cheered, yelled, and were delighted,<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC6646-00000059"/> but when this astounding philippic was concluded,
                  there was a unanimous call for "Scott!" Colonel Starbottle would have resisted
                  this manifest impropriety, but in vain. Partly from a crude sense of justice,
                  partly from a meaner craving for excitement, the assemblage was inflexible; and
                  Scott was dragged, pushed, and pulled upon the platform.</p>
               <p>As his frowsy head and unkempt beard appeared above the railing, it was evident
                  that he was drunk. But it was also evident, before he opened his lips, that the
                  orator of Sandy Bar—the one man who could touch their vagabond sympathies (perhaps
                  because he was not above appealing to them)—stood before them. A consciousness of
                  this power lent a certain dignity to his figure, and I am not sure but that his
                  very physical condition impressed them as a kind of regal unbending and large
                  condescension. Howbeit, when this unexpected Hector arose from the ditch, York's
                  myrmidons trembled.</p>
               <p>"There's naught, gentlemen," said Scott, leaning forward on the railing,—"there's
                  naught as that man hez said as isn't true. I was run outer Cairo; I did belong to
                  the Regulators; I did desert from the army; I did leave a wife in Kansas. But
                  thar's one thing he didn't charge me with, and, maybe, he's forgotten. For three
                  years, gentlemen, I was that man's pardner!—" Whether he intended to say more, I
                  cannot tell; a burst of applause artistically rounded and enforced the climax, and
                  virtually elected the speaker. That fall he went to Sacramento, York went abroad;
                  and for the first time in many years, distance and a new atmosphere isolated the
                  old antagonists.</p>
               <p>With little of change in the green wood, gray rock, and yellow river, but with
                  much shifting of human landmarks, and new faces in its habitations, three years
                  passed over Sandy Bar. The two men, once so identified with its character, seemed
                  to have been quite forgotten. "You will never return to Sandy Bar," said Miss
                  Folinsbee, the "Lily of Poverty Flat," on meeting York in Paris, "for Sandy Bar is
                  no more. They call it Riverside now; and the new town is built higher up on the
                  river-bank. By the by, 'Jo' says that Scott has won his suit about the 'Amity
                  Claim,' and that he lives in the old cabin, and is drunk half his time. O, I beg
                  your pardon," added the lively lady, as a flush crossed York's sallow cheek; "but,
                  bless me, I really thought that old grudge was made up. I'm sure it ought to
                  be."</p>
               <p>It was three months after this conversation, and a pleasant summer evening, that
                  the Poverty Flat coach drew up before the veranda of the Union Hotel at Sandy Bar.
                  Among its passengers was one, apparently a stranger, in the local distinction<pb
                     n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6646-00000060"/> of well-fitting clothes and closely
                  shaven face, who demanded a private room and retired early to rest. But before
                  sunrise next morning he arose, and, drawing some clothes from his carpet-bag,
                  proceeded to array himself in a pair of white duck trousers, a white duck
                  overshirt, and straw hat. When his toilet was completed, he tied a red bandanna
                  handkerchief in a loop and threw it loosely over his shoulders. The transformation
                  was complete. As he crept softly down the stairs and stepped into the road, no one
                  would have detected in him the elegant stranger of the previous night, and but few
                  have recognized the face and figure of Henry York of Sandy Bar.</p>
               <p>In the uncertain light of that early hour, and in the change that had come over
                  the settlement, he had to pause for a moment to recall where he stood. The Sandy
                  Bar of his recollection lay below him, nearer the river; the buildings around him
                  were of later date and newer fashion. As he strode toward the river, he noticed
                  here a schoolhouse and there a church. A little farther on, "The Sunny South" came
                  in view, transformed into a restaurant, its gilding faded and its paint rubbed
                  off. He now knew where he was; and, running briskly down a declivity, crossed a
                  ditch, and stood upon the lower boundary of the Amity Claim.</p>
               <p>The gray mist was rising slowly from the river, clinging to the tree-tops and
                  drifting up the mountain-side, until it was caught among those rocky altars, and
                  held a sacrifice to the ascending sun. At his feet the earth, cruelly gashed and
                  scarred by his forgotten engines, had, since the old days, put on a show of
                  greenness here and there, and now smiled forgivingly up at him, as if things were
                  not so bad after all. A few birds were bathing in the ditch with a pleasant
                  suggestion of its being a new and special provision of nature, and a hare ran into
                  an inverted sluice-box, as he approached, as if it were put there for that
                  purpose.</p>
               <p>He had not yet dared to look in a certain direction. But the sun was now high
                  enough to paint the little eminence on which the cabin stood. In spite of his
                  self-control, his heart beat faster as he raised his eyes toward it. Its window
                  and door were closed, no smoke came from its <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >adobe</foreign> chimney, but it was else unchanged. When within a few yards of
                  it, he picked up a broken shovel, and, shouldering it with a smile, strode toward
                  the door and knocked. There was no sound from within. The smile died upon his lips
                  as he nervously pushed the door open.</p>
               <p>A figure started up angrily and came toward him,—a figure whose bloodshot eyes
                  suddenly fixed into a vacant stare, whose arms were at first outstretched and then
                  thrown up in warning gesticulation<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6646-00000061"/>
                  ticulation,—a figure that suddenly gasped, choked, and then fell forward in a
                  fit.</p>
               <p>But before he touched the ground, York had him out into the open air and sunshine.
                  In the struggle, both fell and rolled over on the ground. But the next moment York
                  was sitting up, holding the convulsed frame of his former partner on his knee, and
                  wiping the foam from his inarticulate lips. Gradually the tremor became less
                  frequent, and then ceased; and the strong man lay unconscious in his arms.</p>
               <p>For some moments York held him quietly thus, looking in his face. Afar, the stroke
                  of a woodman's axe—a mere phantom of sound—was all that broke the stillness. High
                  up the mountain, a wheeling hawk hung breathlessly above them. And then came
                  voices, and two men joined them.</p>
               <p>"A fight?" No, a fit; and would they help him bring the sick man to the hotel?</p>
               <p>And there, for a week, the stricken partner lay, unconscious of aught but the
                  visions wrought by disease and fear. On the eighth day, at sunrise, he rallied,
                  and, opening his eyes, looked upon York, and pressed his hand; then he spoke:—</p>
               <p>"And it's you. I thought it was only whiskey."</p>
               <p>York replied by taking both of his hands, boyishly working them backward and
                  forward, as his elbow rested on the bed, with a pleasant smile.</p>
               <p>"And you've been abroad. How did you like Paris?"</p>
               <p>"So, so. How did <emph>you</emph> like Sacramento?"</p>
               <p>"Bully."</p>
               <p>And that was all they could think to say. Presently Scott opened his eyes
                  again.</p>
               <p>"I'm mighty weak."</p>
               <p>"You 'II get better soon."</p>
               <p>"Not much."</p>
               <p>A long silence followed, in which they could hear the sounds of wood-chopping, and
                  that Sandy Bar was already astir for the coming day. Then Scott slowly and with
                  difficulty turned his face to York, and said,—</p>
               <p>"I might hev killed you once."</p>
               <p>"I wish you had."</p>
               <p>They pressed each other's hands again, but Scott's grasp was evidently failing. He
                  seemed to summon his energies for a special effort.</p>
               <p>"Old man!"</p>
               <p>"Old chap."</p>
               <p>"Closer!"</p>
               <p>York bent his head toward the slowly fading face.</p>
               <p>"Do ye mind that morning?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>A gleam of fun slid into the corner of Scott's blue eye, as he whispered,—</p>
               <p>"Old man, thar <emph>was</emph> too much saleratus in that bread."</p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6646-00000062"/>
               <p>It is said that these were his last words. For when the sun, which had so often
                  gone down upon the idle wrath of these foolish men, looked again upon them
                  reunited, it saw the hand of Scott fall cold and irresponsive from the yearning
                  clasp of his former partner, and it knew that the feud of Sandy Bar was at an
                  end.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>MR. THOMPSON'S PRODIGAL</head>
               <p>WE all knew that Mr. Thompson was looking for his son, and a pretty bad one at
                  that. That he was coming to California for this sole object was no secret to his
                  fellow-passengers; and the physical peculiarities, as well as the moral
                  weaknesses, of the missing prodigal were made equally plain to us through the
                  frank volubility of the parent. "You was speaking of a young man which was hung at
                  Red Dog for sluice-robbing," said Mr. Thompson to a steerage passenger, one day;
                  "be you aware of the color of his eyes?" "Black," responded the passenger. "Ah,"
                  said Mr. Thompson, referring to some mental memoranda, "Char-les's eyes was blue."
                  He then walked away. Perhaps it was from this unsympathetic mode of inquiry,
                  perhaps it was from that Western predilection to take a humorous view of any
                  principle or sentiment persistently brought before them, that Mr. Thompson's quest
                  was the subject of some satire among the passengers. A gratuitous advertisement of
                  the missing Charles, addressed to "Jailers and Guardians," circulated privately
                  among them; everybody remembered to have met<pb n="122-123"
                     xml:id="VAC6646-00000063"/> Charles under distressing circumstances. Yet it is
                  but due to my countrymen to state that when it was known that Thompson had
                  embarked some wealth in this visionary project, but little of this satire found
                  its way to his ears, and nothing was uttered in his hearing that might bring a
                  pang to a father's heart, or imperil a possible pecuniary advantage of the
                  satirist. Indeed, Mr. Bracy Tibbets's jocular proposition to form a joint-stock
                  company to "prospect" for the missing youth received at one time quite serious
                  entertainment.</p>
               <p>Perhaps to superficial criticism Mr. Thompson's nature was not picturesque nor
                  lovable. His history, as imparted at dinner, one day, by himself, was practical
                  even in its singularity. After a hard and wilful youth and maturity,—in which he
                  had buried a broken-spirited wife, and driven his son to sea,—he suddenly
                  experienced religion. "I got it in New Orleans in '59," said Mr. Thompson, with
                  the general suggestion of referring to an epidemic. "Enter ye the narrer gate.
                  Parse me the beans." Perhaps this practical quality upheld him in his apparently
                  hopeless search. He had no clew to the whereabouts of his runaway son; indeed,
                  scarcely a proof of his present existence. From his indifferent recollection of
                  the boy of twelve, he now expected to identify the man of twenty-five.</p>
               <p>It would seem that he was successful. How he succeeded was one of the few things
                  he did not tell. There are, I believe, two versions of the story. One, that Mr.
                  Thompson, visiting a hospital, discovered his son by reason of a peculiar hymn,
                  chanted by the sufferer, in a delirious dream of his boyhood. This version, giving
                  as it did wide range to the finer feelings of the heart, was quite popular; and as
                  told by the Rev. Mr. Gushington, on his return from his California tour, never
                  failed to satisfy an audience. The other was less simple, and, as I shall adopt it
                  here, deserves more elaboration.</p>
               <p>It was after Mr. Thompson had given up searching for his son among the living, and
                  had taken to the examination of cemeteries, and a careful inspection of the "cold
                     <foreign xml:lang="SPA">hic jacets</foreign> of the dead." At this time he was
                  a frequent visitor of "Lone Mountain,"—a dreary hill-top, bleak enough in its
                  original isolation, and bleaker for the white-faced marbles by which San Francisco
                  anchored her departed citizens, and kept them down in a shifting sand that refused
                  to cover them, and against a fierce and persistent wind that strove to blow them
                  utterly away. Against this wind the old man opposed a will quite as persistent,—a
                  grizzled, hard face, and a tall, crape-bound hat drawn tightly over his eyes,—and
                  so spent days in reading the mortuary inscriptions audibly to himself. The
                  frequency of Scriptural quotation<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6646-00000064"/>
                  pleased him, and he was fond of corroborating them by a pocket Bible. "That's from
                  Psalms," he said, one day, to an adjacent grave-digger. The man made no reply. Not
                  at all rebuffed, Mr. Thompson at once slid down into the open grave, with a more
                  practical inquiry, "Did you ever, in your profession, come across Char-les
                  Thompson?" "Thompson be d—d!" said the grave-digger, with great directness.
                  "Which, if he hadn't religion, I think he is," responded the old man, as he
                  clambered out of the grave.</p>
               <p>It was, perhaps, on this occasion that Mr. Thompson stayed later than usual. As he
                  turned his face toward the city, lights were beginning to twinkle ahead, and a
                  fierce wind, made visible by fog, drove him forward, or, lying in wait, charged
                  him angrily from the corners of deserted suburban streets. It was on one of these
                  corners that something else, quite as indistinct and malevolent, leaped upon him
                  with an oath, a presented pistol, and a demand for money. But it was met by a will
                  of iron and a grip of steel. The assailant and assailed rolled together on the
                  ground. But the next moment the old man was erect; one hand grasping the captured
                  pistol, the other clutching at arm's length the throat of a figure, surly,
                  youthful, and savage.</p>
               <p>"Young man," said Mr. Thompson, setting his thin lips together, "what might be
                  your name?"</p>
               <p>"Thompson!"</p>
               <p>The old man's hand slid from the throat to the arm of his prisoner, without
                  relaxing its firmness.</p>
               <p>"Char-les Thompson, come with me," he said, presently, and marched his captive to
                  the hotel. What took place there has not transpired, but it was known the next
                  morning that Mr. Thompson had found his son.</p>
               <p>It is proper to add to the above improbable story, that there was nothing in the
                  young man's appearance or manners to justify it. Grave, reticent, and handsome,
                  devoted to his newly found parent, he assumed the emoluments and responsibilities
                  of his new condition with a certain serious ease that more nearly approached that
                  which San Francisco society lacked, and—rejected. Some chose to despise this
                  quality as a tendency to "psalm-singing"; others saw in it the inherited qualities
                  of the parent, and were ready to prophesy for the son the same hard old age. But
                  all agreed that it was not inconsistent with the habits of money-getting, for
                  which father and son were respected.</p>
               <p>And yet, the old man did not seem to be happy. Perhaps it was that the
                  consummation of his wishes left him without a practical mission; perhaps—and it is
                  the more probable—he had little love for the son he had regained. The obedience<pb
                     n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6646-00000065"/> he exacted was freely given, the reform
                  he had set his heart upon was complete; and yet, somehow, it did not seem to
                  please him. In reclaiming his son, he had fulfilled all the requirements that his
                  religious duty required of him, and yet the act seemed to lack sanctification. In
                  this perplexity, he read again the parable of the Prodigal Son,—which he had long
                  ago adopted for his guidance,—and found that he had omitted the final feast of
                  reconciliation. This seemed to offer the proper quality of ceremoniousness in the
                  sacrament between himself and his son; and so, a year after the appearance of
                  Charles, he set about giving him a party. "Invite everybody, Char-les," he said,
                  dryly; "everybody who knows that I brought you out of the wine-husks of iniquity,
                  and the company of harlots; and bid them eat, drink, and be merry."</p>
               <p>Perhaps the old man had another reason, not yet clearly analyzed. The fine house
                  he had built on the sand-hills sometimes seemed lonely and bare. He often found
                  himself trying to reconstruct, from the grave features of Charles, the little boy
                  whom he but dimly remembered in the past, and of whom lately he had been thinking
                  a great deal. He believed this to be a sign of impending old age and childishness;
                  but coming, one day, in his formal drawing-room, upon a child of one of the
                  servants, who had strayed therein, he would have taken him in his arms, but the
                  child fled from before his grizzled face. So that it seemed eminently proper to
                  invite a number of people to his house, and, from the array of San Francisco
                  maidenhood, to select a daughter-in-law. And then there would be a child—a boy,
                  whom he could "rare up" from the beginning, and—love—as he did not love
                  Charles.</p>
               <p>We were all at the party. The Smiths, Joneses, Browns, and Robinsons also came, in
                  that fine flow of animal spirits, unchecked by any respect for the entertainer,
                  which most of us are apt to find so fascinating. The proceedings would have been
                  somewhat riotous, but for the social position of the actors. In fact, Mr. Bracy
                  Tibbets, having naturally a fine appreciation of a humorous situation, but further
                  impelled by the bright eyes of the Jones girls, conducted himself so remarkably as
                  to attract the serious regard of Mr. Charles Thompson, who approached him, saying
                  quietly: "You look ill, Mr. Tibbets; let me conduct you to your carriage. Resist,
                  you hound, and I'll throw you through that window. This way, please; the room is
                  close and distressing." It is hardly necessary to say that but a part of this
                  speech was audible to the company, and that the rest was not divulged by Mr.
                  Tibbets, who afterward regretted the sudden illness which kept him from witnessing
                  a certain amusing incident, which the fastest Miss Jones<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC6646-00000066"/> characterized as the "richest part of the
                  blow-out," and which I hasten to record.</p>
               <p>It was at supper. It was evident that Mr. Thompson had overlooked much lawlessness
                  in the conduct of the younger people, in his abstract contemplation of some
                  impending event. When the cloth was removed, he rose to his feet, and grimly
                  tapped upon the table. A titter, that broke out among the Jones girls, became
                  epidemic on one side of the board. Charles Thompson, from the foot of the table,
                  looked up in tender perplexity. "He's going to sing a Doxology," "He's going to
                  pray," "Silence for a speech," ran round the room.</p>
               <p>"It's one year to-day, Christian brothers and sisters," said Mr. Thompson, with
                  grim deliberation,—"one year to-day since my son came home from eating of
                  wine-husks and spending of his substance on harlots." (The tittering suddenly
                  ceased.) "Look at him now. Char-les Thompson, stand up." (Charles Thompson stood
                  up.) "One year ago to-day,—and look at him now."</p>
               <p>He was certainly a handsome prodigal, standing there in his cheerful
                  evening-dress,—a repentant prodigal, with sad, obedient eyes turned upon the harsh
                  and unsympathetic glance of his father. The youngest Miss Smith, from the pure
                  depths of her foolish little heart, moved unconsciously toward him.</p>
               <p>"It's fifteen years ago since he left my house," said Mr. Thompson, "a rovier and
                  a prodigal. I was myself a man of sin, O Christian friends,—a man of wrath and
                  bitterness" ("Amen," from the eldest Miss Smith),—"but praise be God, I've fled
                  the wrath to come. It's five years ago since I got the peace that passeth
                  understanding. Have you got it, friends?" (A general sub-chorus of "No, no," from
                  the girls, and, "Pass the word for it," from Midshipman Coxe, of the U. S. sloop
                  Wethersfield.) "Knock, and it shall be opened to you.</p>
               <p>"And when I found the error of my ways, and the preciousness of grace," continued
                  Mr. Thompson, "I came to give it to my son. By sea and land I sought him far, and
                  fainted not. I did not wait for him to come to me, which the same I might have
                  done, and justified myself by the Book of books, but I sought him out among his
                  husks, and—"(the rest of the sentence was lost in the rustling withdrawal of the
                  ladies). "Works, Christian friends, is my motto. By their works shall ye know
                  them, and there is mine."</p>
               <p>The particular and accepted work to which Mr. Thompson was alluding had turned
                  quite pale, and was looking fixedly toward an open door leading to the veranda,
                  lately filled by gaping servants, and now the scene of some vague tumult. As the
                  noise continued, a man, shabbily dressed, and evidently<pb n="130-131"
                     xml:id="VAC6646-00000067"/> dently in liquor, broke through the opposing
                  guardians, and staggered into the room. The transition from the fog and darkness
                  without to the glare and heat within evidently dazzled and stupefied him. He
                  removed his battered hat, and passed it once or twice before his eyes, as he
                  steadied himself, but unsuccessfully, by the back of a chair. Suddenly, his
                  wandering glance fell upon the pale face of Charles Thompson; and with a gleam of
                  childlike recognition, and a weak, falsetto laugh, he darted forward, caught at
                  the table, upset the glasses, and literally fell upon the prodigal's breast.</p>
               <p>"Sha'ly! yo'd—d ol' scoun'rel, hoo rar ye!"</p>
               <p>"Hush!—sit down!—hush!" said Charles Thompson, hurriedly endeavoring to extricate
                  himself from the embrace of his unexpected guest.</p>
               <p>"Look at'm!" continued the stranger, unheeding the admonition, but suddenly
                  holding the unfortunate Charles at arm's length, in loving and undisguised
                  admiration of his festive appearance. "Look at'm! Ain't he nasty? Sha'ls, I'm prow
                  of yer!"</p>
               <p>"Leave the house!" said Mr. Thompson, rising, with a dangerous look in his cold,
                  gray eye. "Char-les, how dare you?"</p>
               <p>"Simmer down, ole man! Sha'ls, who's th' ol' bloat? Eh?"</p>
               <p>"Hush, man; here, take this!" With nervous hands, Charles Thompson filled a glass
                  with liquor. "Drink it and go—until to-morrow—any time, but—leave us!—go now!" But
                  even then, ere the miserable wretch could drink, the old man, pale with passion,
                  was upon him. Half carrying him in his powerful arms, half dragging him through
                  the circling crowd of frightened guests, he had reached the door, swung open by
                  the waiting servants, when Charles Thompson started from a seeming stupor,
                  crying,—</p>
               <p>"Stop!"</p>
               <p>The old man stopped. Through the open door the fog and wind drove chilly. "What
                  does this mean?" he asked, turning a baleful face on Charles.</p>
               <p>"Nothing—but stop—for God's sake. Wait till to-morrow, but not to-night. Do not—I
                  implore you—do this thing."</p>
               <p>There was something in the tone of the young man's voice, something, perhaps, in
                  the contact of the struggling wretch he held in his powerful arms; but a dim,
                  indefinite fear took possession of the old man's heart. "Who," he whispered,
                  hoarsely, "is this man?"</p>
               <p>Charles did not answer.</p>
               <p>"Stand back, there, all of you," thundered Mr. Thompson, to the crowding guests
                  around him. "Char-les—come here! I command you—I—I—I—beg you—tell me
                     <emph>who</emph> is this man?"</p>
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6646-00000068"/>
               <p>Only two persons heard the answer that came faintly from the lips of Charles
                  Thompson,—</p>
               <p>"YOUR SON."</p>
               <p>When day broke over the bleak sand-hills, the guests had departed from Mr.
                  Thompson's banquet-halls. The lights still burned dimly and coldly in the deserted
                  rooms,—deserted by all but three figures, that huddled together in the chill
                  drawing-room, as if for warmth. One lay in drunken slumber on a couch; at his feet
                  sat he who had been known as Charles Thompson; and beside them, haggard and
                  shrunken to half his size, bowed the figure of Mr. Thompson, his gray eye fixed,
                  his elbows upon his knees, and his hands clasped over his ears, as if to shut out
                  the sad, entreating voice that seemed to fill the room.</p>
               <p>"God knows I did not set about to wilfully deceive. The name I gave that night was
                  the first that came into my thought,—the name of one whom I thought dead,—the
                  dissolute companion of my shame. And when you questioned further, I used the
                  knowledge that I gained from him to touch your heart to set me free; only, I
                  swear, for that! But when you told me who you were, and I first saw the opening of
                  another life before me—then—then—O, sir, if I was hungry, homeless, and reckless,
                  when I would have robbed you of your gold, I was heart-sick, helpless, and
                  desperate, when I would have robbed you of your love!"</p>
               <p>The old man stirred not. From his luxurious couch the newly found prodigal snored
                  peacefully.</p>
               <p>"I had no father I could claim. I never knew a home but this. I was tempted. I
                  have been happy,—very happy."</p>
               <p>He rose and stood before the old man.</p>
               <p>"Do not fear that I shall come between your son and his inheritance. To-day I
                  leave this place, never to return. The world is large, sir, and, thanks to your
                  kindness, I now see the way by which an honest livelihood is gained. Good by. You
                  will not take my hand? Well, well. Good by."</p>
               <p>He turned to go. But when he had reached the door he suddenly came back, and,
                  raising with both hands the grizzled head, he kissed it once and twice.</p>
               <p>"Char-les."</p>
               <p>There was no reply.</p>
               <p>"Char-les!"</p>
               <p>The old man rose with a frightened air, and tottered feebly to the door. It was
                  open. There came to him the awakened tumult of a great city, in which the
                  prodigal's footsteps were lost forever.</p>

               <head>THE ROMANCE OF MADROÑO HOLLOW.</head>
               <p>THE latch on the garden gate of the Folinsbee Ranch clicked twice. The gate itself
                  was so much in shadow that lovely night, that "old man Folinsbee," sitting on his
                  porch, could distinguish nothing but a tall white hat and beside it a few
                  fluttering ribbons, under the pines that marked the entrance. Whether because of
                  this fact, or that he considered a sufficient time had elapsed since the clicking
                  of the latch for more positive disclosure, I do not know; but after a few moments'
                  hesitation he quietly laid aside his pipe and walked slowly down the winding path
                  toward the gate. At the Ceanothus hedge he stopped and listened.</p>
               <p>There was not much to hear. The hat was saying to the ribbons that it was a fine
                  night, and remarking generally upon the clear outline of the Sierras against the
                  blue-black sky. The ribbons, it so appeared, had admired this all the way home,
                  and asked the hat if it had ever seen anything half so lovely as the moonlight on
                  the summit. The hat never had; it recalled some lovely nights in the South in
                  Alabama ("in the South in Ahlabahm bahm" was the way the old man heard it), but
                  then there were other things that made this night seem so pleasant. The ribbons
                  could not possibly conceive what the hat could be thinking about. At this point
                  there was a pause, of which Mr. Folinsbee availed himself to walk very grimly and
                  craunchingly down the gravel-walk toward the gate. Then the hat was lifted, and
                  disappeared in the shadow, and Mr. Folinsbee confronted only the half-foolish,
                  half-mischievous, but wholly pretty face of his daughter.</p>
               <p>It was afterward known to Madroño Hollow that sharp words passed between "Miss Jo"
                  and the old man, and that the latter coupled the names of one Culpepper Starbottle
                  and his uncle, Colonel Starbottle, with certain uncomplimentary epithets, and that
                  Miss Jo retaliated sharply. "Her father's blood before her father's face boiled up
                  and proved her truly of his race," quoted the blacksmith, who leaned toward the
                  noble verse of Byron. "She saw the old man's bluff and raised him," was the
                  directer comment of the college-bred Masters.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the subject of these animadversions proceeded slowly along the road to a
                  point where the Folinsbee mansion came in view,—a long, narrow, white building,
                  unpretentious, yet superior to its neighbors, and bearing some evidences of taste
                  and refinement in the vines that clambered over its porch, in its French windows,
                  and the<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6646-00000070"/> white muslin curtains that kept
                  out the fierce California sun by day, and were now touched with silver in the
                  gracious moonlight. Culpepper leaned against the low fence, and gazed long and
                  earnestly at the building. Then the moonlight vanished ghostlike from one of the
                  windows, a material glow took its place, and a girlish figure, holding a candle,
                  drew the white curtains together. To Culpepper it was a vestal virgin standing
                  before a hallowed shrine; to the prosaic observer I fear it was only a fair-haired
                  young woman, whose wicked black eyes still shone with unfilial warmth. Howbeit,
                  when the figure had disappeared he stepped out briskly into the moonlight of the
                  high-road. Here he took off his distinguishing hat to wipe his forehead, and the
                  moon shone full upon his face.</p>
               <p>It was not an unprepossessing one, albeit a trifle too thin and lank and bilious
                  to be altogether pleasant. The cheek-bones were prominent, and the black eyes
                  sunken in their orbits. Straight black hair fell slantwise off a high but narrow
                  forehead, and swept part of a hollow cheek. A long black mustache followed the
                  perpendicular curves of his mouth. It was on the whole a serious, even Quixotic
                  face, but at times it was relieved by a rare smile of such tender and even
                  pathetic sweetness, that Miss Jo is reported to have said that, if it would only
                  last through the ceremony, she would have married its possessor on the spot. "I
                  once told him so," added that shameless young woman; "but the man instantly fell
                  into a settled melancholy, and has n't smiled since."</p>
               <p>A half-mile below the Folinsbee Ranch the white road dipped and was crossed by a
                  trail that ran through Madroño Hollow. Perhaps because it was a near cut-off to
                  the settlement, perhaps from some less practical reason, Culpepper took this
                  trail, and in a few moments stood among the rarely beautiful trees that gave their
                  name to the valley. Even in that uncertain light the weird beauty of these
                  harlequin masqueraders was apparent; their red trunks—a blush in the moonlight, a
                  deep blood-stain in the shadow—stood out against the silvery green foliage. It was
                  as if Nature in some gracious moment had here caught and crystallized the gypsy
                  memories of the transplanted Spaniard, to cheer him in his lonely exile.</p>
               <p>As Culpepper entered the grove he heard loud voices. As he turned toward a clump
                  of trees, a figure so <emph>bizarre</emph> and characteristic that it might have
                  been a resident Daphne—a figure overdressed in crimson silk and lace, with bare
                  brown arms and shoulders, and a wreath of honeysuckle—stepped out of the shadow.
                  It was followed by a man. Culpepper started. To come to the point briefly, he
                  recognized in the man the features of his respected uncle, Colonel Starbottle; in
                  the female, a lady who may be briefly described as one<pb n="138-139"
                     xml:id="VAC6646-00000071"/> possessing absolutely no claim to an introduction
                  to the polite reader. To hurry over equally unpleasant details, both were
                  evidently under the influence of liquor.</p>
               <p>From the excited conversation that ensued, Culpepper gathered that some insult had
                  been put upon the lady at a public ball which she had attended that evening; that
                  the Colonel, her escort, had failed to resent it with the sanguinary completeness
                  that she desired. I regret that, even in a liberal age, I may not record the exact
                  and even picturesque language in which this was conveyed to her hearers. Enough
                  that at the close of a fiery peroration, with feminine inconsistency she flew at
                  the gallant Colonel, and would have visited her delayed vengeance upon his
                  luckless head, but for the prompt interference of Culpepper. Thwarted in this, she
                  threw herself upon the ground, and then into unpicturesque hysterics. There was a
                  fine moral lesson, not only in this grotesque performance of a sex which cannot
                  afford to be grotesque, but in the ludicrous concern with which it inspired the
                  two men. Culpepper, to whom woman was more or less angelic, was pained and
                  sympathetic; the Colonel, to whom she was more or less improper, was exceedingly
                  terrified and embarrassed. Howbeit the storm was soon over, and after Mistress
                  Dolores had returned a little dagger to its sheath (her garter), she quietly took
                  herself out of Madroño Hollow, and happily out of these pages forever. The two
                  men, left to themselves, conversed in low tones. Dawn stole upon them before they
                  separated: the Colonel quite sobered and in full possession of his usual jaunty
                  self-assertion; Culpepper with a baleful glow in his hollow cheek, and in his dark
                  eyes a rising fire.</p>
               <p>The next morning the general ear of Madroño Hollow was filled with rumors of the
                  Colonel's mishap. It was asserted that he had been invited to withdraw his female
                  companion from the floor of the Assembly Ball at the Independence Hotel, and that,
                  failing to do this, both were expelled. It is to be regretted that in 1854 public
                  opinion was divided in regard to the propriety of this step, and that there was
                  some discussion as to the comparative virtue of the ladies who were not expelled;
                  but it was generally conceded that the real <foreign xml:lang="SPA">casus
                     belli</foreign> was political. "Is this a dashed Puritan meeting?" had asked
                  the Colonel, savagely. "It's no Pike County shindig," had responded the
                  floor-manager, cheerfully. "You're a Yank!" had screamed the Colonel, profanely
                  qualifying the noun. "Get! you border ruffian," was the reply. Such at least was
                  the substance of the reports. As, at that sincere epoch, expressions like the
                  above were usually followed by prompt action, a fracas was confidently looked
                  for.</p>
               <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6646-00000072"/>
               <p>Nothing, however, occurred. Colonel Starbottle made his appearance next day upon
                  the streets with somewhat of his usual pomposity, a little restrained by the
                  presence of his nephew, who accompanied him, and who, as a universal favorite,
                  also exercised some restraint upon the curious and impertinent. But Culpepper's
                  face wore a look of anxiety quite at variance with his usual grave repose. "The
                  Don don't seem to take the old man's set-back kindly," observed the sympathizing
                  blacksmith. "P'r'aps he was sweet on Dolores himself," suggested the sceptical
                  expressman.</p>
               <p>It was a bright morning, a week after this occurrence, that Miss Jo Folinsbee
                  stepped from her garden into the road. This time the latch did not click as she
                  cautiously closed the gate behind her. After a moment's irresolution, which would
                  have been awkward but that it was charmingly employed, after the manner of her
                  sex, in adjusting a bow under a dimpled but rather prominent chin, and in pulling
                  down the fingers of a neatly fitting glove, she tripped toward the settlement.
                  Small wonder that a passing teamster drove his six mules into the wayside ditch
                  and imperilled his load, to keep the dust from her spotless garments; small wonder
                  that the "Lightning Express" withheld its speed and flash to let her pass, and
                  that the expressman, who had never been known to exchange more than rapid
                  monosyllables with his fellow-man, gazed after her with breathless admiration. For
                  she was certainly attractive. In a country where the ornamental sex followed the
                  example of youthful Nature, and were prone to overdress and glaring efflorescence,
                  Miss Jo's simple and tasteful raiment added much to the physical charm of, if it
                  did not actually suggest a sentiment to, her presence. It is said that Euchre-deck
                  Billy, working in the gulch at the crossing, never saw Miss Folinsbee pass but
                  that he always remarked apologetically to his partner, that "he believed he
                     <emph>must</emph> write a letter home." Even Bill Masters, who saw her in Paris
                  presented to the favorable criticism of that most fastidious man, the late
                  Emperor, said that she was stunning, but a big discount on what she was at Madroño
                  Hollow.</p>
               <p>It was still early morning, but the sun, with California extravagance, had already
                  begun to beat hotly on the little chip hat and blue ribbons, and Miss Jo was
                  obliged to seek the shade of a bypath. Here she received the timid advances of a
                  vagabond yellow dog graciously, until, emboldened by his success, he insisted upon
                  accompanying her, and, becoming slobberingly demonstrative, threatened her
                  spotless skirt with his dusty paws, when she drove him from her with some slight
                  acerbity, and a stone which haply fell within fifty feet of its destined mark.
                  Having thus proved her<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6646-00000073"/> ability to
                  defend herself, with characteristic inconsistency she took a small panic, and,
                  gathering her white skirts in one hand, and holding the brim of her hat over her
                  eyes with the other, she ran swiftly at least a hundred yards before she stopped.
                  Then she began picking some ferns and a few wild-flowers still spared to the
                  withered fields, and then a sudden distrust of her small ankles seized her, and
                  she inspected them narrowly for those burrs and bugs and snakes which are supposed
                  to lie in wait for helpless womanhood. Then she plucked some golden heads of wild
                  oats, and with a sudden inspiration placed them in her black hair, and then came
                  quite unconsciously upon the trail leading to Madroño Hollow.</p>
               <p>Here she hesitated. Before her ran the little trail, vanishing at last into the
                  bosky depths below. The sun was very hot. She must be very far from home. Why
                  should she not rest a while under the shade of a madroño?</p>
               <p>She answered these questions by going there at once. After thoroughly exploring
                  the grove, and satisfying herself that it contained no other living human
                  creature, she sat down under one of the largest trees, with a satisfactory little
                  sigh. Miss Jo loved the madroño. It was a cleanly tree; no dust ever lay upon its
                  varnished leaves; its immaculate shade never was known to harbor grub or
                  insect.</p>
               <p>She looked up at the rosy arms interlocked and arched above her head. She looked
                  down at the delicate ferns and cryptogams at her feet. Something glittered at the
                  root of the tree. She picked it up; it was a bracelet. She examined it carefully
                  for cipher or inscription; there was none. She could not resist a natural desire
                  to clasp it on her arm, and to survey it from that advantageous view-point. This
                  absorbed her attention for some moments; and when she looked up again she beheld
                  at a little distance Culpepper Starbottle.</p>
               <p>He was standing where he had halted, with instinctive delicacy, on first
                  discovering her. Indeed, he had even deliberated whether he ought not to go away
                  without disturbing her. But some fascination held him to the spot. Wonderful power
                  of humanity! Far beyond jutted an outlying spur of the Sierra, vast, compact, and
                  silent. Scarcely a hundred yards away, a league-long chasm dropped its sheer walls
                  of granite a thousand feet. On every side rose up the serried ranks of pine-trees,
                  in whose close-set files centuries of storm and change had wrought no breach. Yet
                  all this seemed to Culpepper to have been planned by an all-wise Providence as the
                  natural background to the figure of a pretty girl in a yellow dress.</p>
               <p>Although Miss Jo had confidently expected to meet Culpepper somewhere in her
                  ramble, now<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6646-00000074"/> that he came upon her
                  suddenly, she felt disappointed and embarrassed. His manner, too, was more than
                  usually grave and serious, and more than ever seemed to jar upon that audacious
                  levity which was this giddy girl's power and security in a society where all
                  feeling was dangerous. As he approached her she rose to her feet, but almost
                  before she knew it he had taken her hand and drawn her to a seat beside him. This
                  was not what Miss Jo had expected, but nothing is so difficult to predicate as the
                  exact preliminaries of a declaration of love.</p>
               <p>What did Culpepper say? Nothing, I fear, that will add anything to the wisdom of
                  the reader; nothing, I fear, that Miss Jo had not heard substantially from other
                  lips before. But there was a certain conviction, fire-speed, and fury in the
                  manner that was deliciously novel to the young lady. It was certainly something to
                  be courted in the nineteenth century with all the passion and extravagance of the
                  sixteenth; it was something to hear, amid the slang of a frontier society, the
                  language of knight-errantry poured into her ear by this lantern-jawed, dark-browed
                  descendant of the Cavaliers.</p>
               <p>I do not know that there was anything more in it. The facts, however, go to show
                  that at a certain point Miss Jo dropped her glove, and that in recovering it
                  Culpepper possessed himself first of her hand and then her lips. When they stood
                  up to go Culpepper had his arm around her waist, and her black hair, with its
                  sheaf of golden, oats, rested against the breast pocket of his coat. But even then
                  I do not think her fancy was entirely captive. She took a certain satisfaction in
                  this demonstration of Culpepper's splendid height, and mentally compared it with a
                  former flame, one Lieutenant McMirk, an active, but under-sized Hector, who
                  subsequently fell a victim to the incautiously composed and monotonous beverages
                  of a frontier garrison. Nor was she so much preoccupied but that her quick eyes,
                  even while absorbing Culpepper's glances, were yet able to detect, at a distance,
                  the figure of a man approaching. In an instant she slipped out of Culpepper's arm,
                  and, whipping her hands behind her, said, "There's that horrid man!"</p>
               <p>Culpepper looked up and beheld his respected uncle panting and blowing over the
                  hill. His brow contracted as he turned to Miss Jo: "You don't like my uncle!"</p>
               <p>"I hate him!" Miss Jo was recovering her ready tongue.</p>
               <p>Culpepper blushed. He would have liked to enter upon some details of the Colonel's
                  pedigree and exploits, but there was not time. He only smiled sadly. The smile
                  melted Miss Jo. She held out her hand quickly, and said with even<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC6646-00000075"/> more than her usual effrontery, "Don't let that man
                  get you into any trouble. Take care of yourself, dear, and don't let anything
                  happen to you."</p>
               <p>Miss Jo intended this speech to be pathetic; the tenure of life among her lovers
                  had hitherto been very uncertain. Culpepper turned toward her, but she had already
                  vanished in the thicket.</p>
               <p>The Colonel came up panting. "I've looked all over town for you, and be dashed to
                  you, sir. Who was that with you?"</p>
               <p>"A lady." (Culpepper never lied, but he was discreet.)</p>
               <p>"D—m 'em all! Look yar, Culp, I've spotted the man who gave the order to put me
                  off the floor" ("flo" was what the Colonel said) "the other night!"</p>
               <p>"Who was it?" asked Culpepper, listlessly.</p>
               <p>"Jack Folinsbee."</p>
               <p>"Who?"</p>
               <p>"Why, the son of that dashed nigger-worshipping psalm-singing Puritan Yankee.
                  What's the matter, now? Look yar, Culp, you ain't goin' back on your blood, ar'
                  ye? You ain't goin' back on your word? Ye ain't going down at the feet of this
                  trash, like a whipped hound?"</p>
               <p>Culpepper was silent. He was very white. Presently he looked up and said quietly,
                  "No."</p>
               <p>Culpepper Starbottle had challenged Jack Folinsbee insbee, and the challenge was
                  accepted. The cause alleged was the expelling of Culpepper's uncle from the floor
                  of the Assembly Ball by the order of Folinsbee. This much Madroño Hollow knew and
                  could swear to; but there were other strange rumors afloat, of which the
                  blacksmith was an able expounder. "You see, gentlemen," he said to the crowd
                  gathered around his anvil, "I ain't got no theory of this affair, I only give a
                  few facts as have come to my knowledge. Culpepper and Jack meets quite accidental
                  like in Bob's saloon. Jack goes up to Culpepper and says,' A word with you.'
                  Culpepper bows and steps aside in this way, Jack standing about
                  <emph>here</emph>." (The blacksmith demonstrates the position of the parties with
                  two old horseshoes on the anvil.) "Jack pulls a bracelet from his pocket and says,
                  'Do you know that bracelet?' Culpepper says, 'I do not,' quite cool-like and easy.
                  Jack says, 'You gave it to my sister.' Culpepper says, still cool as you please,'
                  I did not.' Jack says, 'You lie, G—d d—mn you,' and draws his derringer. Culpepper
                  jumps forward about here" (reference is made to the diagram) "and Jack fires.
                  Nobody hit. It's a mighty cur'o's thing, gentlemen," continued the blacksmith,
                  dropping suddenly into the abstract, and leaning meditatively on his anvil,—"it's
                  a mighty cur'o's thing that nobody gets hit so often. You and me empties our
                  revolvers sociably at each other over a<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6646-00000076"/>
                  little game, and the room full and nobody gets hit! That's what gets me."</p>
               <p>"Never mind, Thompson," chimed in Bill Masters, "there's another and a better
                  world where we shall know all that and—become better shots. Go on with your
                  story."</p>
               <p>"Well, some grabs Culpepper and some grabs Jack, and so separates them. Then Jack
                  tells 'em as how he had seen his sister wear a bracelet which he knew was one that
                  had been given to Dolores by Colonel Starbottle. That Miss Jo wouldn't say where
                  she got it, but owned up to having seen Culpepper that day. Then the most cur'o's
                  thing of it yet, what does Culpepper do but rise up and takes all back that he
                  said, and allows that he <emph>did</emph> give her the bracelet. Now my opinion,
                  gentlemen, is that he lied; it ain't like that man to give a gal that he respects
                  anything off of that piece, Dolores. But it's all the same now, and there's but
                  one thing to be done."</p>
               <p>The way this one thing was done belongs to the record of Madroño Hollow. The
                  morning was bright and clear; the air was slightly chill, but that was from the
                  mist which arose along the banks of the river. As early as six o'clock the
                  designated ground—a little opening in the madroño grove—was occupied by Culpepper
                  Starbottle, Colonel Starbottle, his second, and the surgeon. The Colonel was
                  exalted and excited, albeit in a rather imposing, dignified way, and pointed out
                  to the surgeon the excellence of the ground, which at that hour was wholly shaded
                  from the sun, whose steady stare is more or less discomposing to your duellist.
                  The surgeon threw himself on the grass and smoked his cigar. Culpepper, quiet and
                  thoughtful, leaned against a tree and gazed up the river. There was a strange
                  suggestion of a picnic about the group, which was heightened when the Colonel drew
                  a bottle from his coat-tails, and, taking a preliminary draught, offered it to the
                  others. "Cocktails, sir," he explained with dignified precision. "A gentleman,
                  sir, should never go out without 'em. Keeps off the morning chill. I remember
                  going out in '53 with Hank Boompirater. Good ged, sir, the man had to put on his
                  overcoat, and was shot in it. Fact."</p>
               <p>But the noise of wheels drowned the Colonel's reminiscences, and a rapidly driven
                  buggy, containing Jack Folinsbee, Calhoun Bungstarter, his second, and Bill
                  Masters, drew up on the ground. Jack Folinsbee leaped out gayly. "I had the
                  jolliest work to get away without the governor's hearing," he began, addressing
                  the group before him with the greatest volubility. Calhoun Bungstarter touched his
                  arm, and the young man blushed. It was his first duel.</p>
               <p>"If you are ready, gentlemen," said Mr. Bungstarter, "we had better proceed to
                  business. I<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6646-00000077"/> believe it is understood
                  that no apology will be offered or accepted. We may as well settle preliminaries
                  at once, or I fear we shall be interrupted. There is a rumor in town that the
                  Vigilance Committee are seeking our friends the Starbottles, and I believe, as
                  their fellow-countryman, I have the honor to be included in their warrant."</p>
               <p>At this probability of interruption, that gravity which had hitherto been wanting
                  fell upon the group. The preliminaries were soon arranged and the principals
                  placed in position. Then there was a silence.</p>
               <p>To a spectator from the hill, impressed with the picnic suggestion, what might
                  have been the popping of two champagne corks broke the stillness.</p>
               <p>Culpepper had fired in the air. Colonel Starbottle uttered a low curse. Jack
                  Folinsbee sulkily demanded another shot.</p>
               <p>Again the parties stood opposed to each other. Again the word was given, and what
                  seemed to be the simultaneous report of both pistols rose upon the air. But after
                  an interval of a few seconds all were surprised to see Culpepper slowly raise his
                  unexploded weapon and fire it harmlessly above his head. Then, throwing the pistol
                  upon the ground, he walked to a tree and leaned silently against it.</p>
               <p>Jack Folinsbee flew into a paroxysm of fury. Colonel Starbottle raved and swore.
                  Mr. Bungstarter starter was properly shocked at their conduct. "Really, gentlemen,
                  if Mr. Culpepper Starbottle declines another shot, I do not see how we can
                  proceed."</p>
               <p>But the Colonel's blood was up, and Jack Folinsbee was equally implacable. A
                  hurried consultation ensued, which ended by Colonel Starbottle taking his nephew's
                  place as principal, Bill Masters acting as second, <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >vice</foreign> Mr. Bungstarter, who declined all further connection with the
                  affair.</p>
               <p>Two distinct reports rang through the Hollow. Jack Folinsbee dropped his smoking
                  pistol, took a step forward, and then dropped heavily upon his face.</p>
               <p>In a moment the surgeon was at his side. The confusion was heightened by the
                  trampling of hoofs, and the voice of the blacksmith bidding them flee for their
                  lives before the coming storm. A moment more and the ground was cleared, and the
                  surgeon, looking up, beheld only the white face of Culpepper bending over him.</p>
               <p>"Can you save him?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot say. Hold up his head a moment, while I run to the buggy."</p>
               <p>Culpepper passed his arm tenderly around the neck of the insensible man. Presently
                  the surgeon returned with some stimulants.</p>
               <p>"There, that will do, Mr. Starbottle, thank you: Now my advice is to get away from
                  here while<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6646-00000078"/> you can. I'll look after
                  Folinsbee. Do you hear?"</p>
               <p>Culpepper's arm was still round the neck of his late foe, but his head had drooped
                  and fallen on the wounded man's shoulder. The surgeon looked down, and, catching
                  sight of his face, stooped and lifted him gently in his arms. He opened his coat
                  and waistcoat. There was blood upon his shirt, and a bullet-hole in his breast. He
                  had been shot unto death at the first fire.</p>

               <head>THE POET OF SIERRA FLAT.</head>
               <p>AS the enterprising editor of the "Sierra Flat Record" stood at his case setting
                  type for his next week's paper, he could not help hearing the woodpeckers who were
                  busy on the roof above his head. It occurred to him that possibly the birds had
                  not yet learned to recognize in the rude structure any improvement on nature, and
                  this idea pleased him so much that he incorporated it in the editorial article
                  which he was then doubly composing. For the editor was also printer of the
                  "Record"; and although that remarkable journal was reputed to exert a power felt
                  through all Calaveras and a greater part of Tuolumne County, strict economy was
                  one of the conditions of its beneficent existence.</p>
               <p>Thus preoccupied, he was startled by the sudden irruption of a small roll of
                  manuscript, which was thrown through the open door and fell at his feet. He walked
                  quickly to the threshold and looked down the tangled trail which led to the
                  high-road. But there was nothing to suggest the presence of his mysterious
                  contributor. A hare limped slowly away, a green-and-gold lizard paused upon a
                     pine<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6646-00000079"/> stump, the woodpeckers ceased
                  their work. So complete had been his sylvan seclusion, that he found it difficult
                  to connect any human agency with the act; rather the hare seemed to have an
                  inexpressibly guilty look, the woodpeckers to maintain a significant silence, and
                  the lizard to be conscience-stricken into stone.</p>
               <p>An examination of the manuscript, however, corrected this injustice to defenceless
                  nature. It was evidently of human origin,—being verse, and of exceeding bad
                  quality. The editor laid it aside. As he did so he thought he saw a face at the
                  window. Sallying out in some indignation, he penetrated the surrounding thicket in
                  every direction, but his search was as fruitless as before. The poet, if it were
                  he, was gone.</p>
               <p>A few days after this the editorial seclusion was invaded by voices of alternate
                  expostulation and entreaty. Stepping to the door, the editor was amazed at
                  beholding Mr. Morgan McCorkle, a well-known citizen of Angelo, and a subscriber to
                  the "Record," in the act of urging, partly by force and partly by argument, an
                  awkward young man toward the building. When he had finally effected his object,
                  and, as it were, safely landed his prize in a chair, Mr. McCorkle took off his
                  hat, carefully wiped the narrow isthmus of forehead which divided his black brows
                  from his stubby hair, and, with an explanatory wave of his hand toward his
                  reluctant companion, said, "A borned poet, and the cussedest fool you ever
                  seed!"</p>
               <p>Accepting the editor's smile as a recognition of the introduction, Mr. McCorkle
                  panted and went on: "Didn't want to come! 'Mister Editor don't want to see me,
                  Morg,' sez he. 'Milt,' sez I, 'he do; a borned poet like you and a gifted genius
                  like he oughter come together sociable!' And I fetched him. Ah, will yer?" The
                  born poet had, after exhibiting signs of great distress, started to run. But Mr.
                  McCorkle was down upon him instantly, seizing him by his long linen coat, and
                  settled him back in his chair. "'Tain't no use stampeding. Yer ye are and yer ye
                  stays. For yer a borned poet,—ef ye are as shy as a jackass rabbit. Look at 'im
                  now!"</p>
               <p>He certainly was not an attractive picture. There was hardly a notable feature in
                  his weak face, except his eyes, which were moist and shy and not unlike the animal
                  to which Mr. McCorkle had compared him. It was the face that the editor had seen
                  at the window.</p>
               <p>"Knowed him for fower year,—since he war a boy," continued Mr. McCorkle in a loud
                  whisper. "Allers the same, bless you! Can jerk a rhyme as easy as turnin' jack.
                  Never had any eddication; lived out in Missooray all his life. But he's chock full
                  o' poetry. On'y this mornin' sez I to him,—he camps along o' me,—'Milt!' sez I,
                  'are breakfast<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6646-00000080"/> fast ready?' and he up
                  and answers back quite peart and chipper, 'The breakfast it is ready, and the
                  birds is singing free, and it's risin' in the dawn-in' light is happiness to me!'
                  When a man," said Mr. McCorkle, dropping his voice with deep solemnity, "gets off
                  things like them, without any call to do it, and handlin' flapjacks over a
                  cookstove at the same time,—that man's a borned poet."</p>
               <p>There was an awkward pause. Mr. McCorkle beamed patronizingly on his <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">protégé</foreign>. The born poet looked as if he were meditating
                  another flight,—not a metaphorical one. The editor asked if he could do anything
                  for them.</p>
               <p>"In course you can," responded Mr. McCorkle, "that's jest it. Milt, where's that
                  poetry?"</p>
               <p>The editor's countenance fell as the poet produced from his pocket a roll of
                  manuscript. He, however, took it mechanically and glanced over it. It was
                  evidently a duplicate of the former mysterious contribution.</p>
               <p>The editor then spoke briefly but earnestly. I regret that I cannot recall his
                  exact words, but it appeared that never before, in the history of the "Record,"
                  had the pressure been so great upon its columns. Matters of paramount importance,
                  deeply affecting the material progress of Sierra, questions touching the absolute
                  integrity of Calaveras and Tuolumne as social communities, were even now waiting
                  expression. Weeks, nay, months, must elapse before that pressure would be removed,
                  and the "Record" could grapple with any but the sternest of topics. Again, the
                  editor had noticed with pain the absolute decline of poetry in the foot-hills of
                  the Sierras. Even the works of Byron and Moore attracted no attention in Dutch
                  Flat, and a prejudice seemed to exist against Tennyson in Grass Valley. But the
                  editor was not without hope for the future. In the course of four or five years,
                  when the country was settled,—</p>
               <p>"What would be the cost to print this yer?" interrupted Mr. McCorkle, quietly.</p>
               <p>"About fifty dollars, as an advertisement," responded the editor with cheerful
                  alacrity.</p>
               <p>Mr. McCorkle placed the sum in the editor's hand. "Yer see thet's what I sez to
                  Milt, 'Milt,' sez I, 'pay as you go, for you are a borned poet. Hevin no call to
                  write, but doin' it free and spontaneous like, in course you pays. Thet's why Mr.
                  Editor never printed your poetry.'"</p>
               <p>"What name shall I put to it?" asked the editor.</p>
               <p>"Milton."</p>
               <p>It was the first word that the born poet had spoken during the interview, and his
                  voice was so very sweet and musical that the editor looked at him curiously, and
                  wondered if he had a sister.</p>
               <p>"Milton; is that all?"</p>
               <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6646-00000081"/>
               <p>"Thet's his furst name," exclaimed Mr. McCorkle.</p>
               <p>The editor here suggested that as there had been another poet of that name—</p>
               <p>"Milt might be took for him! Thet's bad," reflected Mr. McCorkle with simple
                  gravity. "Well, put down his hull name,—Milton Chubbuck."</p>
               <p>The editor made a note of the fact. "I'll set it up now," he said. This was also a
                  hint that the interview was ended. The poet and patron, arm in arm, drew towards
                  the door. "In next week's paper," said the editor, smilingly, in answer to the
                  childlike look of inquiry in the eyes of the poet, and in another moment they were
                  gone.</p>
               <p>The editor was as good as his word. He straightway betook himself to his case,
                  and, unrolling the manuscript, began his task. The woodpeckers on the roof
                  recommenced theirs, and in a few moments the former sylvan seclusion was restored.
                  There was no sound in the barren, barn-like room but the birds above, and below
                  the click of the composing-rule as the editor marshalled the types into lines in
                  his stick, and arrayed them in solid column on the galley. Whatever might have
                  been his opinion of the copy before him, there was no indication of it in his
                  face, which wore the stolid indifference of his craft. Perhaps this was
                  unfortunate, for as the day wore on and the level rays of the sun began to pierce
                  the adjacent thicket, they sought out and discovered an anxious ambushed figure
                  drawn up beside the editor's window,—a figure that had sat there motionless for
                  hours. Within, the editor worked on as steadily and impassively as Fate. And
                  without, the born poet of Sierra Flat sat and watched him as waiting its
                  decree.</p>
               <p>The effect of the poem on Sierra Flat was remarkable and unprecedented. The
                  absolute vileness of its doggerel, the gratuitous imbecility of its thought, and
                  above all the crowning audacity of the fact that it was the work of a citizen and
                  published in the county paper, brought it instantly into popularity. For many
                  months Calaveras had languished for a sensation; since the last vigilance
                  committee nothing had transpired to dispel the listless <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >ennui</foreign> begotten of stagnant business and growing civilization. In
                  more prosperous moments the office of the "Record" would have been simply gutted
                  and the editor deported; at present the paper was in such demand that the edition
                  was speedily exhausted. In brief, the poem of Mr. Milton Chubbuck came like a
                  special providence to Sierra Flat. It was read by camp-fires, in lonely cabins, in
                  flaring bar-rooms and noisy saloons, and declaimed from the boxes of stagecoaches.
                  It was sung in Poker Flat with the addition of a local chorus, and danced as an
                     unhallowed<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6646-00000082"/> lowed rhythmic dance by
                  the Pyrrhic phalanx of One Horse Gulch, known as "The Festive Stags of Calaveras."
                  Some unhappy ambiguities of expression gave rise to many new readings, notes, and
                  commentaries, which, I regret to state, were more often marked by ingenuity than
                  delicacy of thought or expression.</p>
               <p>Never before did poet acquire such sudden local reputation. From the seclusion of
                  McCorkle's cabin and the obscurity of culinary labors, he was haled forth into the
                  glowing sunshine of Fame. The name of Chubbuck was written in letters of chalk on
                  unpainted walls, and carved with a pick on the sides of tunnels. A drink known
                  variously as "The Chubbuck Tranquillizer," or "The Chubbuck Exalter," was
                  dispensed at the bars. For some weeks a rude design for a Chubbuck statue, made up
                  of illustrations from circus and melodeon posters, representing the genius of
                  Calaveras in brief skirts on a flying steed in the act of crowning the poet
                  Chubbuck, was visible at Keeler's Ferry. The poet himself was overborne with
                  invitations to drink and extravagant congratulations. The meeting between Colonel
                  Starbottle of Siskyion and Chubbuck, as previously arranged by our "Boston," late
                  of Roaring Camp, is said to have been indescribably affecting. The Colonel
                  embraced him unsteadily. "I could not return to my constituents at Siskyion, sir,
                  if this hand, which has grasped that of the gifted Prentice and the lamented Poe,
                  should not have been honored by the touch of the godlike Chubbuck. Gentlemen,
                  American literature is looking up. Thank you, I will take sugar in mine." It was
                  "Boston" who indited letters of congratulations from H. W. Longfellow, Tennyson,
                  and Browning, to Mr. Chubbuck, deposited them in the Sierra Flat post-office, and
                  obligingly consented to dictate the replies.</p>
               <p>The simple faith and unaffected delight with which these manifestations were
                  received by the poet and his patron might have touched the hearts of these grim
                  masters of irony, but for the sudden and equal development in both of the variety
                  of weak natures. Mr. McCorkle basked in the popularity of his <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">protégé</foreign>, and became alternately supercilious or
                  patronizing toward the dwellers of Sierra Flat; while the poet, with hair
                  carefully oiled and curled, and bedecked with cheap jewelry and flaunting
                  neck-handkerchief, paraded himself before the single hotel. As may be imagined,
                  this new disclosure of weakness afforded intense satisfaction to Sierra Flat, gave
                  another lease of popularity to the poet, and suggested another idea to the
                  facetious "Boston."</p>
               <p>At that time a young lady popularly and professionally known as the "California
                  Pet" was performing to enthusiastic audiences in the interior. Her specialty lay
                  in the personation of youthful<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6646-00000083"/>
                  masculine character; as a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">gamin</foreign> of the street
                  she was irresistible, as a negro-dancer she carried the honest miner's heart by
                  storm. A saucy, pretty brunette, she had preserved a wonderful moral reputation
                  even under the Jove-like advances of showers of gold that greeted her appearance
                  on the stage at Sierra Flat. A prominent and delighted member of that audience was
                  Milton Chubbuck. He attended every night. Every day he lingered at the door of the
                  Union Hotel for a glimpse of the "California Pet." It was not long before he
                  received a note from her,—in "Boston's" most popular and approved female
                  hand,—acknowledging his admiration. It was not long before "Boston" was called
                  upon to indite a suitable reply. At last, in furtherance of his facetious design,
                  it became necessary for "Boston" to call upon the young actress herself and secure
                  her personal participation. To her he unfolded a plan, the successful carrying out
                  of which he felt would secure his fame to posterity as a practical humorist. The
                  "California Pet's" black eyes sparkled approvingly and mischievously. She only
                  stipulated that she should see the man first,—a concession to her feminine
                  weakness which years of dancing Juba and wearing trousers and boots had not wholly
                  eradicated from her wilful breast. By all means, it should be done. And the
                  interview was arranged for the next week.</p>
               <p>It must not be supposed that during this interval of popularity Mr. Chubbuck had
                  been unmindful of his poetic qualities. A certain portion of each day he was
                  absent from town,—"a communin' with natur'," as Mr. McCorkle expressed it,—and
                  actually wandering in the mountain trails, or lying on his back under the trees,
                  or gathering fragrant herbs and the bright-colored berries of the Marzanita. These
                  and his company he generally brought to the editor's office, late in the
                  afternoon, often to that enterprising journalist's infinite weariness. Quiet and
                  uncommunicative, he would sit there patiently watching him at his work until the
                  hour for closing the office arrived, when he would as quietly depart. There was
                  something so humble and unobtrusive in these visits, that the editor could not
                  find it in his heart to deny them, and accepting them, like the woodpeckers, as a
                  part of his sylvan surroundings, often forgot even his presence. Once or twice,
                  moved by some beauty of expression in the moist, shy eyes, he felt like seriously
                  admonishing his visitor of his idle folly; but his glance falling upon the oiled
                  hair and the gorgeous necktie, he invariably thought better of it. The case was
                  evidently hopeless.</p>
               <p>The interview between Mr. Chubbuck and the "California Pet" took place in a
                  private room of the Union Hotel; propriety being respected by<pb n="164-165"
                     xml:id="VAC6646-00000084"/> the presence of that arch-humorist, "Boston." To
                  this gentleman we are indebted for the only true account of the meeting. However
                  reticent Mr. Chubbuck might have been in the presence of his own sex, toward the
                  fairer portion of humanity he was, like most poets, exceedingly voluble.
                  Accustomed as the "California Pet" had been to excessive compliment, she was
                  fairly embarrassed by the extravagant praises of her visitor. Her personation of
                  boy characters, her dancing of the "champion jig," were particularly dwelt upon
                  with fervid but unmistakable admiration. At last, recovering her audacity and
                  emboldened by the presence of "Boston," the "California Pet" electrified her
                  hearers by demanding, half jestingly, half viciously, if it were as a boy or a
                  girl that she was the subject of his flattering admiration.</p>
               <p>"That knocked him out o' time," said the delighted "Boston," in his subsequent
                  account of the interview. "But do you believe the d—d fool actually asked her to
                  take him with her; wanted to engage in the company."</p>
               <p>The plan, as briefly unfolded by "Boston," was to prevail upon Mr. Chubbuck to
                  make his appearance in costume (already designed and prepared by the inventor)
                  before a Sierra Flat audience, and recite an original poem at the Hall immediately
                  on the conclusion of the "California Pet's" performance. At a given signal the
                  audience were to rise and deliver a volley of unsavory articles (previously
                  provided by the originator of the scheme); then a select few were to rush on the
                  stage, seize the poet, and, after marching him in triumphal procession through
                  town, were to deposit him beyond its uttermost limits, with strict injunctions
                  never to enter it again. To the first part of the plan the poet was committed, for
                  the latter portion it was easy enough to find participants.</p>
               <p>The eventful night came, and with it an audience that packed the long narrow room
                  with one dense mass of human beings. The "California Pet" never had been so
                  joyous, so reckless, so fascinating and audacious before. But the applause was
                  tame and weak compared to the ironical outburst that greeted the second rising of
                  the curtain and the entrance of the born poet of Sierra Flat. Then there was a
                  hush of expectancy, and the poet stepped to the foot-lights and stood with his
                  manuscript in his hand.</p>
               <p>His face was deadly pale. Either there was some suggestion of his fate in the
                  faces of his audience, or some mysterious instinct told him of his danger. He
                  attempted to speak, but faltered, tottered, and staggered to the wings.</p>
               <p>Fearful of losing his prey, "Boston" gave the signal and leaped upon the stage.
                  But at the same moment a light figure darted from behind the scenes, and
                  delivering a kick that sent the discomfited<pb n="166-167"
                     xml:id="VAC6646-00000085"/> comfited humorist back among the musicians, cut a
                  pigeon-wing, executed a double-shuffle, and then advancing to the foot-lights with
                  that inimitable look, that audacious swagger and utter <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >abandon</foreign> which had so thrilled and fascinated them a moment before,
                  uttered the characteristic speech: "Wot are you goin' to hit a man fur, when he's
                  down, s-a-a-y?"</p>
               <p>The look, the drawl, the action, the readiness, and above all the downright
                  courage of the little woman, had its effect. A roar of sympathetic applause
                  followed the act. "Cut and run while you can," she whispered hurriedly over her
                  one shoulder, without altering the other's attitude of pert and saucy defiance
                  toward the audience. But even as she spoke the poet tottered and sank fainting
                  upon the stage. Then she threw a despairing whisper behind the scenes, "Ring down
                  the curtain."</p>
               <p>There was a slight movement of opposition in the audience, but among them rose the
                  burly shoulders of Yuba Bill, the tall, erect figure of Henry York of Sandy Bar,
                  and the colorless, determined face of John Oakhurst. The curtain came down.</p>
               <p>Behind it knelt the "California Pet" beside the prostrate poet. "Bring me some
                  water. Run for a doctor. Stop!! CLEAR OUT, ALL OF YOU!"</p>
               <p>She had unloosed the gaudy cravat and opened the shirt-collar of the insensible
                  figure before her. Then she burst into an hysterical laugh.</p>
               <p>"Manuela!"</p>
               <p>Her tiring-woman, a Mexican half-breed, came toward her.</p>
               <p>"Help me with him to my dressing-room, quick; then stand outside and wait. If any
                  one questions you, tell them he's gone. Do you hear? HE'S gone."</p>
               <p>The old woman did as she was bade. In a few moments the audience had departed.
                  Before morning so also had the "California Pet," Manuela, and—the poet of Sierra
                  Flat.</p>
               <p>But, alas! with them also had departed the fair fame of the "California Pet." Only
                  a few, and these it is to be feared of not the best moral character themselves,
                  still had faith in the stainless honor of their favorite actress. "It was a mighty
                  foolish thing to do, but it'll all come out right yet." On the other hand, a
                  majority gave her full credit and approbation for her undoubted pluck and
                  gallantry, but deplored that she should have thrown it away upon a worthless
                  object. To elect for a lover the despised and ridiculed vagrant of Sierra Flat,
                  who had not even the manliness to stand up in his own defence, was not only
                  evidence of inherent moral depravity, but was an insult to the community. Colonel
                  Starbottle saw in it only another instance of the extreme frailty of the sex;<pb
                     n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6646-00000086"/> he had known similar cases; and
                  remembered distinctly, sir, how a well-known Philadelphia heiress, one of the
                  finest women that ever rode in her kerridge, that, gad, sir! had thrown over a
                  Southern member of Congress to consort with a d—d nigger. The Colonel had also
                  noticed a singular look in the dog's eye which he did not entirely fancy. He would
                  not say anything against the lady, sir, but he had noticed—And here haply the
                  Colonel became so mysterious and darkly confidential as to be unintelligible and
                  inaudible to the bystanders.</p>
               <p>A few days after the disappearance of Mr. Chubbuck a singular report reached
                  Sierra Flat, and it was noticed that "Boston," who since the failure of his
                  elaborate joke had been even more depressed in spirits than is habitual with great
                  humorists, suddenly found that his presence was required in San Francisco. But as
                  yet nothing but the vaguest surmises were afloat, and nothing definite was
                  known.</p>
               <p>It was a pleasant afternoon when the editor of the "Sierra Flat Record" looked up
                  from his case and beheld the figure of Mr. Morgan McCorkle standing in the
                  doorway. There was a distressed look on the face of that worthy gentleman that at
                  once enlisted the editor's sympathizing attention. He held an open letter in his
                  hand, as he advanced toward the middle of the room.</p>
               <p>"As a man as has allers borne a fair reputation," began Mr. McCorkle slowly, "I
                  should like, if so be as I could, Mister Editor, to make a correction in the
                  columns of your valooable paper."</p>
               <p>Mr. Editor begged him to proceed.</p>
               <p>"Ye may not disremember that about a month ago I fetched here what so be as we'll
                  call a young man whose name might be as it were Milton—Milton Chubbuck."</p>
               <p>Mr. Editor remembered perfectly.</p>
               <p>"Thet same party I'd knowed better nor fower year, two on 'em campin' out
                  together. Not that I'd known him all the time, fur he war shy and strange at
                  spells and had odd ways that I took war nat'ral to a borned poet. Ye may remember
                  that I said he was a borned poet?"</p>
               <p>The editor distinctly did.</p>
               <p>"I picked this same party up in St. Jo., takin' a fancy to his face, and kinder
                  calklating he'd runn'd away from home,—for I'm a married man, Mr. Editor, and hev
                  children of my own,—and thinkin' belike he was a borned poet."</p>
               <p>"Well?" said the editor.</p>
               <p>"And as I said before, I should like now to make a correction in the columns of
                  your valooable paper."</p>
               <p>"What correction?" asked the editor.</p>
               <p>"I said, ef you remember my words, as how he was a borned poet."</p>
               <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6646-00000087"/>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"From statements in this yer letter it seems as how I war wrong."</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"She war a woman."</p>

               <head>THE CHRISTMAS GIFT THAT CAME TO RUPERT.</head>
               <head type="sub">A STORY FOR LITTLE SOLDIERS.</head>
               <p>IT was the Christmas season in California,—a season of falling rain and springing
                  grasses. There were intervals when, through driving clouds and flying scud, the
                  sun visited the haggard hills with a miracle, and death and resurrection were as
                  one, and out of the very throes of decay a joyous life struggled outward and
                  upward. Even the storms that swept down the dead leaves nurtured the tender buds
                  that took their places. There were no episodes of snowy silence; over the
                  quickening fields the farmer's ploughshare hard followed the furrows left by the
                  latest rains. Perhaps it was for this reason that the Christmas evergreens which
                  decorated the drawing-room took upon themselves a foreign aspect, and offered a
                  weird contrast to the roses, seen dimly through the windows, as the southwest wind
                  beat their soft faces against the panes.</p>
               <p>"Now," said the Doctor, drawing his chair closer to the fire, and looking mildly
                  but firmly at<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6646-00000088"/> the semicircle of flaxen
                  heads around him, "I want it distinctly understood before I begin my story, that I
                  am not to be interrupted by any ridiculous questions. At the first one I shall
                  stop. At the second, I shall feel it my duty to administer a dose of castor-oil,
                  all around. The boy that moves his legs or arms will be understood to invite
                  amputation. I have brought my instruments with me, and never allow pleasure to
                  interfere with my business. Do you promise?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said six small voices, simultaneously. The volley was, however,
                  followed by half a dozen dropping questions.</p>
               <p>"Silence! Bob, put your feet down, and stop rattling that sword. Flora shall sit
                  by my side, like a little lady, and be an example to the rest. Fung Tang shall
                  stay, too, if he likes. Now, turn down the gas a little; there, that will do,—just
                  enough to make the fire look brighter, and to show off the Christmas candles.
                  Silence, everybody! The boy who cracks an almond, or breathes too loud over his
                  raisins, will be put out of the room."</p>
               <p>There was a profound silence. Bob laid his sword tenderly aside, and nursed his
                  leg thoughtfully. Flora, after coquettishly adjusting the pocket of her little
                  apron, put her arm upon the Doctor's shoulder, and permitted herself to be drawn
                  beside him. Fung Tang, the little heathen page, who was permitted, on this rare
                  occasion, to share the Christian revels in the drawing-room, surveyed the group
                  with a smile that was at once sweet and philosophical. The light ticking of a
                  French clock on the mantel, supported by a young shepherdess of bronze complexion
                  and great symmetry of limb, was the only sound that disturbed the Christmas-like
                  peace of the apartment,—a peace which held the odors of evergreens, new toys,
                  cedar-boxes, glue, and varnish in an harmonious combination that passed all
                  understanding.</p>
               <p>"About four years ago at this time," began the Doctor, "I attended a course of
                  lectures in a certain city. One of the professors, who was a sociable, kindly
                  man,—though somewhat practical and hard-headed,—invited me to his house on
                  Christmas night. I was very glad to go, as I was anxious to see one of his sons,
                  who, though only twelve years old, was said to be very clever. I dare not tell you
                  how many Latin verses this little fellow could recite, or how many English ones he
                  had composed. In the first place, you'd want me to repeat them; secondly, I'm not
                  a judge of poetry, Latin or English. But there were judges who said they were
                  wonderful for a boy, and everybody predicted a splendid future for him. Everybody
                  but his father. He shook his head doubtingly, whenever it was mentioned, for, as I
                  have told you, he was a practical, matter-of-fact man.</p>
               <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6646-00000089"/>
               <p>"There was a pleasant party at the Professor's that night. All the children of the
                  neighborhood were there, and among them the Professor's clever son, Rupert, as
                  they called him,—a thin little chap, about as tall as Bobby there, and as fair and
                  delicate as Flora by my side. His health was feeble, his father said; he seldom
                  ran about and played with other boys, preferring to stay at home and brood over
                  his books, and compose what he called his verses.</p>
               <p>"Well, we had a Christmas-tree just like this, and we had been laughing and
                  talking, calling off the names of the children who had presents on the tree, and
                  everybody was very happy and joyous, when one of the children suddenly uttered a
                  cry of mingled surprise and hilarity, and said, 'Here's something for Rupert; and
                  what do you think it is?'</p>
               <p>"We all guessed. 'A desk'; 'A copy of Milton'; 'A gold pen'; 'A rhyming
                  dictionary.' 'No? what then?'</p>
               <p>"'A drum!'</p>
               <p>"'A what?' asked everybody.</p>
               <p>"'A drum! with Rupert's name on it.'</p>
               <p>"Sure enough there it was. A good-sized, bright, new, brass-bound drum, with a
                  slip of paper on it, with the inscription, 'FOR RUPERT.'</p>
               <p>"Of course we all laughed, and thought it a good joke. 'You see you're to make a
                  noise in the world, Rupert!' said one. 'Here's parchment for the poet,' said
                  another. 'Rupert's last work in sheepskin covers,' said a third. 'Give us a
                  classical tune, Rupert,' said a fourth; and so on. But Rupert seemed too mortified
                  to speak; he changed color, bit his lips, and finally burst into a passionate fit
                  of crying, and left the room. Then those who had joked him felt ashamed, and
                  everybody began to ask who had put the drum there. But no one knew, or if they
                  did, the unexpected sympathy awakened for the sensitive boy kept them silent. Even
                  the servants were called up and questioned, but no one could give any idea where
                  it came from. And, what was still more singular, everybody declared that up to the
                  moment it was produced, no one had seen it hanging on the tree. What do I think?
                  Well, I have my own opinion. But no questions! Enough for you to know that Rupert
                  did not come down stairs again that night, and the party soon after broke up.</p>
               <p>"I had almost forgotten those things, for the war of the Rebellion broke out the
                  next spring, and I was appointed surgeon in one of the new regiments, and was on
                  my way to the seat of war. But I had to pass through the city where the Professor
                  lived, and there I met him. My first question was about Rupert. The Professor
                  shook his head sadly. 'He's not so well,' he said; 'he has<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC6646-00000090"/> been declining since last Christmas, when you saw
                  him. A very strange case,' he added, giving it a long Latin name,—'a very singular
                  case. But go and see him yourself,' he urged; 'it may distract his mind and do him
                  good.'</p>
               <p>"I went accordingly to the Professor's house, and found Rupert lying on a sofa,
                  propped up with pillows. Around him were scattered his books, and, what seemed in
                  singular contrast, that drum I told you about was hanging on a nail, just above
                  his head. His face was thin and wasted; there was a red spot on either cheek, and
                  his eyes were very bright and widely opened. He was glad to see me, and when I
                  told him where I was going, he asked a thousand questions about the war. I thought
                  I had thoroughly diverted his mind from its sick and languid fancies, when he
                  suddenly grasped my hand and drew me toward him.</p>
               <p>"'Doctor,' said he, in a low whisper, 'you won't laugh at me if I tell you
                  something?'</p>
               <p>"'No, certainly not,' I said.</p>
               <p>"'You remember that drum?' he said, pointing to the glittering toy that hung
                  against the wall. 'You know, too, how it came to me. A few weeks after Christmas,
                  I was lying half asleep here, and the drum was hanging on the wall, when suddenly
                  I heard it beaten; at first, low and slowly, then faster and louder, until its
                  rolling filled the house. In the middle of the night, I heard it again. I did not
                  dare to tell anybody about it, but I have heard it every night ever since.'</p>
               <p>"He paused and looked anxiously in my face. 'Sometimes,' he continued, 'it is
                  played softly, sometimes loudly, but always quickening to a long-roll, so loud and
                  alarming that I have looked to see people coming into my room to ask what was the
                  matter. But I think, Doctor,—I think,' he repeated slowly, looking up with painful
                  interest into my face, 'that no one hears it but myself.'</p>
               <p>"I thought so, too, but I asked him if he had heard it at any other time.</p>
               <p>"'Once or twice in the daytime,' he replied, 'when I have been reading or writing;
                  then very loudly, as though it were angry, and tried in that way to attract my
                  attention away from my books.'</p>
               <p>"I looked into his face, and placed my hand upon his pulse. His eyes were very
                  bright, and his pulse a little flurried and quick. I then tried to explain to him
                  that he was very weak, and that his senses were very acute, as most weak people's
                  are; and how that when he read, or grew interested and excited, or when he was
                  tired at night, the throbbing of a big artery made the beating sound he heard. He
                  listened to me with a sad smile of unbelief, but thanked me, and in a little while
                  I went away. But as I was going down stairs, I met the Professor. I gave him my
                  opinion of the case,—well, no matter what it was.</p>
               <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6646-00000091"/>
               <p>"'He wants fresh air and exercise,' said the Professor, 'and some practical
                  experience of life, sir.' The Professor was not a bad man, but he was a little
                  worried and impatient, and thought—as clever people are apt to think—that things
                  which he did n't understand were either silly or improper.</p>
               <p>"I left the city that very day, and in the excitement of battle-fields and
                  hospitals, I forgot all about little Rupert, nor did I hear of him again, until
                  one day, meeting an old classmate in the army, who had known the Professor, he
                  told me that Rupert had become quite insane, and that in one of his paroxysms he
                  had escaped from the house, and as he had never been found, it was feared that he
                  had fallen in the river and was drowned. I was terribly shocked for the moment, as
                  you may imagine; but, dear me, I was living just then among scenes as terrible and
                  shocking, and I had little time to spare to mourn over poor Rupert.</p>
               <p>"It was not long after receiving this intelligence that we had a terrible battle,
                  in which a portion of our army was surprised and driven back with great slaughter.
                  I was detached from my brigade to ride over to the battle-field and assist the
                  surgeons of the beaten division, who had more on their hands than they could
                  attend to. When I reached the barn that served for a temporary hospital, I went at
                  once to work. Ah, Bob," said the Doctor, thoughtfully taking the bright sword from
                  the hands of the half-frightened Bob, and holding it gravely before him, "these
                  pretty playthings are symbols of cruel, ugly realities.</p>
               <p>"I turned to a tall, stout Vermonter," he continued very slowly, tracing a pattern
                  on the rug with the point of the scabbard, "who was badly wounded in both thighs,
                  but he held up his hands and begged me to help others first who needed it more
                  than he. I did not at first heed his request, for this kind of unselfishness was
                  very common in the army; but he went on, 'For God's sake, Doctor, leave me here;
                  there is a drummer-boy of our regiment—a mere child—dying, if he is n't dead now.
                  Go, and see him first. He lies over there. He saved more than one life. He was at
                  his post in the panic this morning, and saved the honor of the regiment.' I was so
                  much more impressed by the man's manner than by the substance of his speech, which
                  was, however, corroborated by the other poor fellows stretched around me, that I
                  passed over to where the drummer lay, with his drum beside him. I gave one glance
                  at his face—and—yes, Bob—yes, my children—it <emph>was</emph> Rupert.</p>
               <p>"Well! well! it needed not the chalked cross which my brother-surgeons had left
                  upon the rough board whereon he lay to show how urgent was the relief he sought;
                  it needed not the prophetic words<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6646-00000092"/> of
                  the Vermonter, nor the damp that mingled with the brown curls that clung to his
                  pale forehead, to show how hopeless it was now. I called him by name. He opened
                  his eyes—larger, I thought, in the new vision that was beginning to dawn upon
                  him—and recognized me. He whispered, 'I'm glad you are come, but I don't think you
                  can do me any good.'</p>
               <p>"I could not tell him a lie. I could not say anything. I only pressed his hand in
                  mine, as he went on.</p>
               <p>"'But you will see father, and ask him to forgive me. Nobody is to blame but
                  myself. It was a long time before I understood why the drum came to me that
                  Christmas night, and why it kept calling to me every night, and what it said. I
                  know it now. The work is done, and I am content. Tell father it is better as it
                  is. I should have lived only to worry and perplex him, and something in me tells
                  me this is right.'</p>
               <p>"He lay still for a moment, and then, grasping my hand, said,—</p>
               <p>"'Hark!'</p>
               <p>"I listened, but heard nothing but the suppressed moans of the wounded men around
                  me. 'The drum,' he said faintly; 'don't you hear it? The drum is calling me.'</p>
               <p>"He reached" out his arm to where it lay, as though he would embrace it.</p>
               <p>"'Listen,' he went on, 'it's the reveille. There are the ranks drawn up in review.
                  Don't you see the sunlight flash down the long line of bayonets? Their faces are
                  shining,—they present arms,—there comes the General; but his face I cannot look
                  at, for the glory round his head. He sees me; he smiles, it is—' And with a name
                  upon his lips that he had learned long ago, he stretched himself wearily upon the
                  planks, and lay quite still.</p>
               <p>"That's all. No questions now; never mind what became of the drum. Who's that
                  snivelling? Bless my soul, where's my pill-box?"</p>

                  <head>A VENERABLE IMPOSTOR.</head>
                  <p>AS I glance across my table, I am somewhat distracted by the spectacle of a
                     venerable head whose crown occasionally appears beyond, at about its level. The
                     apparition of a very small hand—whose fingers are bunchy and have the
                     appearance of being slightly webbed—which is frequently lifted above the table
                     in a vain and impotent attempt to reach the inkstand, always affects me as a
                     novelty at each recurrence of the phenomenon. Yet both the venerable head and
                     bunchy fingers belong to an individual with whom I am familiar, and to whom,
                     for certain reasons hereafter described, I choose to apply the epithet written
                     above this article.</p>
                  <p>His advent in the family was attended with peculiar circumstances. He was
                     received with some concern—the number of retainers having been increased by one
                     in honor of his arrival. He appeared to be weary,—his pretence was that he had
                     come from a long journey,—so that for days, weeks, and even months, he did not
                     leave his bed except when he was carried. But it was remarkable that his
                     appetite was invariably regular<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6646-00000095"/> lar
                     and healthy, and that his meals, which he required should be brought to him,
                     were seldom rejected. During this time he had little conversation with the
                     family, his knowledge of our vernacular being limited, but occasionally spoke
                     to himself in his own language,—a foreign tongue. The difficulties attending
                     this eccentricity were obviated by the young woman who had from the first taken
                     him under her protection,—being, like the rest of her sex, peculiarly open to
                     impositions,—and who at once disorganized her own tongue to suit his. This was
                     affected by the contraction of the syllables of some words, the addition of
                     syllables to others, and an ingenious disregard for tenses and the governing
                     powers of the verb. The same singular law which impels people in conversation
                     with foreigners to imitate their broken English governed the family in their
                     communications with him. He received these evidences of his power with an
                     indifference not wholly free from scorn. The expression of his eye would
                     occasionally denote that his higher nature revolted from them. I have no doubt
                     myself that his wants were frequently misinterpreted; that the stretching forth
                     of his hands toward the moon and stars might have been the performance of some
                     religious rite peculiar to his own country, which was in ours misconstrued into
                     a desire for physical nourishment. His repetition of the word "goo-goo
                     goo,"—which was subject to a variety of opposite interpretations,—when taken in
                     conjunction with his size, in my mind seemed to indicate his aboriginal or
                     Aztec origin.</p>
                  <p>I incline to this belief, as it sustains the impression I have already hinted
                     at, that his extreme youth is a simulation and deceit; that he is really older
                     and has lived before at some remote period, and that his conduct fully
                     justifies his title as A Venerable Impostor. A variety of circumstances
                     corroborate this impression: His tottering walk, which is a senile as well as a
                     juvenile condition; his venerable head, thatched with such imperceptible hair
                     that, at a distance, it looks like a mild aureola, and his imperfect dental
                     exhibition. But beside these physical peculiarities may be observed certain
                     moral symptoms, which go to disprove his assumed youth. He is in the habit of
                     falling into reveries, caused, I have no doubt, by some circumstance which
                     suggests a comparison with his experience in his remoter boyhood, or by some
                     serious retrospection of the past years. He has been detected lying awake, at
                     times when he should have been asleep, engaged in curiously comparing the
                     bed-clothes, walls, and furniture with some recollection of his youth. At such
                     moments he has been heard to sing softly to himself fragments of some
                     unintelligible composition, which probably still linger in his memory as the
                     echoes of a music<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6646-00000096"/> he has long
                     outgrown. He has the habit of receiving strangers with the familiarity of one
                     who had met them before, and to whom their antecedents and peculiarities were
                     matters of old acquaintance, and so unerring is his judgment of their previous
                     character that when he withholds his confidence I am apt to withhold mine. It
                     is somewhat remarkable that while the maturity of his years and the respect due
                     to them is denied by man, his superiority and venerable age is never questioned
                     by the brute creation. The dog treats him with a respect and consideration
                     accorded to none others, and the cat permits a familiarity which I should
                     shudder to attempt. It may be considered an evidence of some Pantheistic
                     quality in his previous education, that he seems to recognize a fellowship even
                     in inarticulate objects; he has been known to verbally address plants, flowers,
                     and fruit, and to extend his confidence to such inanimate objects as chairs and
                     tables. There can be little doubt that, in the remote period of his youth,
                     these objects were endowed with not only sentient natures, but moral
                     capabilities, and he is still in the habit of beating them when they collide
                     with him, and of pardoning them with a kiss.</p>
                  <p>As he has grown older—rather let me say, as we have approximated to his
                     years—he has, in spite of the apparent paradox, lost much of his senile
                     gravity. It must be confessed that some of his actions of late appear to our
                     imperfect comprehension inconsistent with his extreme age. A habit of marching
                     up and down with a string tied to a soda-water bottle, a disposition to ride
                     anything that could by any exercise of the liveliest fancy be made to assume
                     equine proportions, a propensity to blacken his venerable white hair with ink
                     and coal dust, and an omnivorous appetite which did not stop at chalk, clay, or
                     cinders, were peculiarities not calculated to excite respect. In fact, he would
                     seem to have become demoralized, and when, after a prolonged absence the other
                     day, he was finally discovered standing upon the front steps addressing a group
                     of delighted children out of his limited vocabulary, the circumstance could
                     only be accounted for as the garrulity of age.</p>
                  <p>But I lay aside my pen amidst an ominous silence and the disappearance of the
                     venerable head from my plane of vision. As I step to the other side of the
                     table, I find that sleep has overtaken him in an overt act of hoary wickedness.
                     The very pages I have devoted to an exposition of his deceit he has quietly
                     abstracted, and I find them covered with cabalistic figures and wild-looking
                     hieroglyphs traced with his forefinger dipped in ink, which doubtless in his
                     own language conveys a scathing commentary on my composition. But he sleeps
                     peacefully, and there is something in his face which tells me that he has
                     already wandered<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6646-00000097"/> away to that dim
                     region of his youth where I cannot follow him. And as there comes a strange
                     stirring at my heart when I contemplate the immeasurable gulf which lies
                     between us, and how slight and feeble as yet is his grasp on this world and its
                     strange realities, I find, too late, that I also am a willing victim of the
                     Venerable Impostor.</p>

                  <head>FROM A BALCONY.</head>
                  <p>THE little stone balcony, which, by a popular fallacy, is supposed to be a
                     necessary appurtenance of my window, has long been to me a source of curious
                     interest. The fact that the asperities of our summer weather will not permit me
                     to use it but once or twice in six months does not alter my concern for this
                     incongruous ornament. It affects me as I suppose the conscious possession of a
                     linen coat or a nankeen trousers might affect a sojourner here who has not
                     entirely outgrown his memory of Eastern summer heat and its glorious
                     compensations,—a luxurious providence against a possible but by no means
                     probable contingency. I do no longer wonder at the persistency with which San
                     Franciscans adhere to this architectural superfluity in the face of climatical
                     impossibilities. The balconies in which no one sits, the piazzas on which no
                     one lounges, are timid advances made to a climate whose churlishness we are
                     trying to temper by an ostentation of confidence. Ridiculous as this spectacle
                     is at all seasons, it is never more so than in that bleak interval between
                     sunset and dark, when the shrill scream<pb n="192-193"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000098"/> of the factory whistle seems to have
                     concentrated all the hard, unsympathetic quality of the climate into one vocal
                     expression. Add to this the appearance of one or two pedestrians, manifestly
                     too late for their dinners, and tasting in the shrewish air a bitter
                     premonition of the welcome that awaits them at home, and you have one of those
                     ordinary views from my balcony which makes the balcony itself ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>But as I lean over its balustrade to-night—a night rare in its kindness and
                     beauty—and watch the fiery ashes of my cigar drop into the abysmal darkness
                     below, I am inclined to take back the whole of that preceding paragraph,
                     although it cost me some labor to elaborate its polite malevolence. I can even
                     recognize some melody in the music which comes irregularly and fitfully from
                     the balcony of the Museum on Market Street, although it may be broadly stated
                     that, as a general thing, the music of all museums, menageries, and circuses
                     becomes greatly demoralized,—possibly through associations with the beasts. So
                     soft and courteous is this atmosphere that I have detected the flutter of one
                     or two light dresses on the adjacent balconies and piazzas, and the front
                     parlor windows of a certain aristocratic mansion in the vicinity, which have
                     always maintained a studious reserve in regard to the interior, to-night are
                     suddenly thrown into the attitude of familiar disclosure closure. A few young
                     people are strolling up the street with a lounging step which is quite a relief
                     to that usual brisk, business-like pace which the chilly nights impose upon
                     even the most sentimental lovers. The genial influences of the air are not
                     restricted to the opening of shutters and front doors; other and more gentle
                     disclosures are made, no doubt, beneath this moonlight. The bonnet and hat
                     which passed beneath my balcony a few moments ago were suspiciously close
                     together. I argued from this that my friend the editor will probably receive
                     any quantity of verses for his next issue, containing allusions to "Luna," in
                     which the original epithet of "silver" will be applied to this planet, and that
                     a "boon" will be asked for the evident purpose of rhyming with "moon," and for
                     no other. Should neither of the parties be equal to this expression, the
                     pent-up feelings of the heart will probably find vent later in the evening over
                     the piano, in "I wandered by the Brookside," or "When the Moon on the Lake is
                     Beaming." But it has been permitted me to hear the fulfilment of my prophecy
                     even as it was uttered. From the window of number Twelve Hundred and Seven
                     gushes upon the slumberous misty air the maddening ballad, "Ever of Thee,"
                     while at Twelve Hundred and Eleven the "Star of the Evening" rises with a
                     chorus. I am inclined to think that there is something in the utter vacuity<pb
                        n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6646-00000099"/> of the refrain in this song which
                     especially commends itself to the young. The simple statement, "Star of the
                     evening," is again and again repeated with an imbecile relish; while the
                     adjective "beautiful" recurs with a steady persistency, too exasperating to
                     dwell upon here. At occasional intervals, a base voice enunciates "Star-r!
                     Star-r!" as a solitary and independent effort. Sitting here in my balcony, I
                     picture the possessor of that voice as a small, stout young man, standing a
                     little apart from the other singers, with his hands behind him, under his
                     coat-tail, and a severe expression of countenance. He sometimes leans forward,
                     with a futile attempt to read the music over somebody else's shoulder, but
                     always resumes his old severity of attitude before singing his part. Meanwhile
                     the celestial subjects of this choral adoration look down upon the scene with a
                     tranquillity and patience which can only result from the security with which
                     their immeasurable remoteness invests them. I would remark that the stars are
                     not the only topics subject to this "damnable iteration." A certain popular
                     song, which contains the statement, "I will not forget you, mother," apparently
                     reposes all its popularity on the constant and dreary repetition of this
                     unimportant information, which at least produces the desired result among the
                     audience. If the best operatic choruses are not above this weakness, the
                     unfamiliar language in which they are sung offers less violation to common
                     sense.</p>
                  <p>It may be parenthetically stated here that the songs alluded to above may be
                     found in sheet music on the top of the piano of any young lady who has just
                     come from boarding-school. "The Old Arm-Chair," or "Woodman, spare that Tree,"
                     will be also found in easy juxtaposition. The latter songs are usually brought
                     into service at the instance of an uncle or bachelor brother, whose request is
                     generally prefaced by a remark deprecatory of the opera, and the gratuitous
                     observation that "we are retrograding, sir,—retrograding," and that "there is
                     no music like the old songs." He sometimes condescends to accompany "Marie" in
                     a tremulous barytone, and is particularly forcible in those passages where the
                     word "repeat" is written, for reasons stated above. When the song is over, to
                     the success of which he feels he has materially contributed, he will inform you
                     that you may talk of your "arias," and your "romanzas," "but for music,
                     sir,—music—" at which point he becomes incoherent and unintelligible. It is
                     this gentleman who suggests "China," or "Brattle Street," as a suitable and
                     cheerful exercise for the social circle. There are certain amatory songs, of an
                     arch and coquettish character, familiar to these localities, which the young
                     lady, being called upon to sing, declines with a bashful and tantalizing
                     hesitation. Prominent among these may be mentioned an erotic effusion entitled
                        "I'm<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6646-00000100"/> talking in my Sleep," which,
                     when sung by a young person vivaciously and with appropriate glances, can be
                     made to drive languishing swains to the verge of madness. Ballads of this
                     quality afford splendid opportunities for bold young men, who, by ejaculating
                     "Oh!" and "Ah!" at the affecting passages, frequently gain a fascinating
                     reputation for wildness and scepticism.</p>
                  <p>But the music which called up these parenthetical reflections has died away,
                     and with it the slight animosities it inspired. The last song has been sung,
                     the piano closed, the lights are withdrawn from the windows, and the white
                     skirts flutter away from stoops and balconies. The silence is broken only by
                     the rattle and rumble of carriages coming from theatre and opera. I fancy that
                     this sound—which, seeming to be more distinct at this hour than at any other
                     time, might be called one of the civic voices of the night—has certain urbane
                     suggestions, not unpleasant to those born and bred in large cities. The moon,
                     round and full, gradually usurps the twinkling lights of the city, that one by
                     one seem to fade away and be absorbed in her superior lustre. The distant
                     Mission hills are outlined against the sky, but through one gap the outlying
                     fog which has stealthily invested us seems to have effected a breach, and only
                     waits the co-operation of the laggard sea-breezes to sweep down and take the
                     beleaguered city by assault. An ineffable calm sinks over the landscape. In the
                     magical moonlight the shot-tower loses its angular outline and practical
                     relations, and becomes a minaret from whose balcony an invisible muezzin calls
                     the Faithful to prayer. "Prayer is better than sleep." But what is this? A
                     shuffle of feet on the pavement, a low hum of voices, a twang of some
                     diabolical instrument, a preliminary hem and cough. Heavens! it cannot be! Ah,
                     yes—it is—it is—SERENADERS!</p>
                  <p>Anathema Maranatha! May purgatorial pains seize you, William, Count of Poitou,
                     Girard de Boreuil, Arnaud de Marveil, Bertrand de Born, mischievous progenitors

                     modern descendants, the "metre ballad-mongers," who carry the shamelessness of
                     the Middle Ages into the nineteenth century, and awake a sleeping neighborhood
                     to the brazen knowledge of their loves and wanton fancies! Destruction and
                     demoralization pursue these pitiable imitators of a barbarous age, when ladies'
                     names and charms were shouted through the land, and modest maiden never lent
                     presence to tilt or tourney without hearing a chronicle of her virtues go round
                     the lists, shouted by wheezy heralds and taken up by roaring swashbucklers!
                     Perdition overpower such ostentatious wooers! Marry! Shall<pb n="198-199"

                     me service, and, barring a looseness of the heel, an ominous yawning at the
                     side, 't is in good case! Na'theless, 't will serve. So! so! What! dispersed!
                     Nay, then, I too will retire.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>MELONS.</head>
                  <p>AS I do not suppose the most gentle of readers will believe that anybody's
                     sponsors in baptism ever wilfully assumed the responsibility of such a name, I
                     may as well state that I have reason to infer that Melons was simply the
                     nickname of a small boy I once knew. If he had any other, I never knew it.</p>
                  <p>Various theories were often projected by me to account for this strange
                     cognomen. His head, which was covered with a transparent down, like that which
                     clothes very small chickens, plainly permitting the scalp to show through, to
                     an imaginative mind might have suggested that succulent vegetable. That his
                     parents, recognizing some poetical significance in the fruits of the season,
                     might have given this name to an August child, was an Oriental explanation.
                     That from his infancy, he was fond of indulging in melons, seemed on the whole
                     the most likely, particularly as Fancy was not bred in McGinnis's Court. He
                     dawned upon me as Melons. His proximity was indicated by shrill, youthful
                     voices, as "Ah, Melons!" or playfully, "Hi, Melons!" or authoritatively, "You,
                     Melons!"</p>
                  <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6646-00000102"/>
                  <p>McGinnis's Court was a democratic expression of some obstinate and radical
                     property-holder. Occupying a limited space between two fashionable
                     thoroughfares, it refused to conform to circumstances, but sturdily paraded its
                     unkempt glories, and frequently asserted itself in ungrammatical language. My
                     window—a rear room on the ground floor—in this way derived blended light and
                     shadow from the court. So low was the window-sill, that had I been the least
                     predisposed to somnambulism, it would have broken out under such favorable
                     auspices, and I should have haunted McGinnis's Court. My speculations as to the
                     origin of the court were not altogether gratuitous, for by means of this window
                     I once saw the Past, as through a glass darkly. It was a Celtic shadow that
                     early one morning obstructed my ancient lights. It seemed to belong to an
                     individual with a pea-coat, a stubby pipe, and bristling beard. He was gazing
                     intently at the court, resting on a heavy cane, somewhat in the way that heroes
                     dramatically visit the scenes of their boyhood. As there was little of
                     architectural beauty in the court, I came to the conclusion that it was
                     McGinnis looking after his property. The fact that he carefully kicked a broken
                     bottle out of the road somewhat strengthened me in the opinion. But he
                     presently walked away, and the court knew him no more. He probably collected
                     his rents by proxy—if he collected them at all.</p>
                  <p>Beyond Melons, of whom all this is purely introductory, there was little to
                     interest the most sanguine and hopeful nature. In common with all such
                     localities, a great deal of washing was done, in comparison with the visible
                     results. There was always something whisking on the line, and always something
                     whisking through the court, that looked as if it ought to be there. A
                     fish-geranium—of all plants kept for the recreation of mankind, certainly the
                     greatest illusion—straggled under the window. Through its dusty leaves I caught
                     the first glance of Melons.</p>
                  <p>His age was about seven. He looked older, from the venerable whiteness of his
                     head, and it was impossible to conjecture his size, as he always wore clothes
                     apparently belonging to some shapely youth of nineteen. A pair of pantaloons,
                     that, when sustained by a single suspender, completely equipped him, formed his
                     every-day suit. How, with this lavish superfluity of clothing, he managed to
                     perform the surprising gymnastic feats it has been my privilege to witness, I
                     have never been able to tell. His "turning the crab," and other minor
                     dislocations, were always attended with success. It was not an unusual sight at
                     any hour of the day to find Melons suspended on a line, or to see his venerable
                     head appearing above the roofs of the outhouses. Melons knew the exact height
                     of every fence in the vicinity, its<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6646-00000103"/>
                     facilities for scaling, and the possibility of seizure on the other side. His
                     more peaceful and quieter amusements consisted in dragging a disused boiler by
                     a large string, with hideous outcries, to imaginary fires.</p>
                  <p>Melons was not gregarious in his habits. A few youth of his own age sometimes
                     called upon him, but they eventually became abusive, and their visits were more
                     strictly predatory incursions for old bottles and junk which formed the staple
                     of McGinnis's Court. Overcome by loneliness one day, Melons inveigled a blind
                     harper into the court. For two hours did that wretched man prosecute his
                     unhallowed calling, unrecompensed, and going round and round the court,
                     apparently under the impression that it was some other place, while Melons
                     surveyed him from an adjoining fence with calm satisfaction. It was this
                     absence of conscientious motives that brought Melons into disrepute with his
                     aristocratic neighbors. Orders were issued that no child of wealthy and pious
                     parentage should play with him. This mandate, as a matter of course, invested
                     Melons with a fascinating interest to them. Admiring glances were cast at
                     Melons from nursery windows. Baby fingers beckoned to him. Invitations to tea
                     (on wood and pewter) were lisped to him from aristocratic back-yards. It was
                     evident he was looked upon as a pure and noble being, untrammelled by the
                     conventionalities of parentage, and physically as well as mentally exalted
                     above them. One afternoon an unusual commotion prevailed in the vicinity of
                     McGinnis's Court. Looking from my window I saw Melons perched on the roof of a
                     stable, pulling up a rope by which one "Tommy," an infant scion of an adjacent
                     and wealthy house, was suspended in mid-air. In vain the female relatives of
                     Tommy congregated in the back-yard, expostulated with Melons; in vain the
                     unhappy father shook his fist at him. Secure in his position, Melons redoubled
                     his exertions and at last landed Tommy on the roof. Then it was that the
                     humiliating fact was disclosed that Tommy had been acting in collusion with
                     Melons. He grinned delightedly back at his parents, as if "by merit raised to
                     that bad eminence." Long before the ladder arrived that was to succor him, he
                     became the sworn ally of Melons, and, I regret to say, incited by the same
                     audacious boy, "chaffed" his own flesh and blood below him. He was eventually
                     taken, though, of course, Melons escaped. But Tommy was restricted to the
                     window after that, and the companionship was limited to "Hi, Melons!" and "You,
                     Tommy!" and Melons, to all practical purposes, lost him forever. I looked
                     afterward to see some signs of sorrow on Melons's part, but in vain; he buried
                     his grief, if he had any, somewhere in his one voluminous garment.</p>
                  <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6646-00000104"/>
                  <p>At about this time my opportunities of knowing Melons became more extended. I
                     was engaged in filling a void in the Literature of the Pacific Coast. As this
                     void was a pretty large one, and as I was informed that the Pacific Coast
                     languished under it, I set apart two hours each day to this work of filling in.
                     It was necessary that I should adopt a methodical system, so I retired from the
                     world and locked myself in my room at a certain hour each day, after coming
                     from my office. I then carefully drew out my portfolio and read what I had
                     written the day before. This would suggest some alteration, and I would
                     carefully rewrite it. During this operation I would turn to consult a book of
                     reference, which invariably proved extremely interesting and attractive. It
                     would generally suggest another and better method of "filling in." Turning this
                     method over reflectively in my mind, I would finally commence the new method
                     which I eventually abandoned for the original plan. At this time I would become
                     convinced that my exhausted faculties demanded a cigar. The operation of
                     lighting a cigar usually suggested that a little quiet reflection and
                     meditation would be of service to me, and I always allowed myself to be guided
                     by prudential instincts. Eventually, seated by my window, as before stated,
                     Melons asserted himself, Though our conversation rarely went further than
                     "Hello, Mister!" and "Ah, Melons!" a vagabond instinct we felt in common
                     implied a communion deeper than words. In this spiritual commingling the time
                     passed, often beguiled by gymnastics on the fence or line (always with an eye
                     to my window) until dinner was announced and I found a more practical void
                     required my attention. An unlooked for incident drew us in closer relation.</p>
                  <p>A sea-faring friend just from a tropical voyage had presented me with a bunch
                     of bananas. They were not quite ripe, and I hung them before my window to
                     mature in the sun of McGinnis's Court, whose forcing qualities were remarkable.
                     In the mysteriously mingled odors of ship and shore which they diffused
                     throughout my room, there was a lingering reminiscence of low latitudes. But
                     even that joy was fleeting and evanescent: they never reached maturity.</p>
                  <p>Coming home one day, as I turned the corner of that fashionable thoroughfare
                     before alluded to, I met a small boy eating a banana. There was nothing
                     remarkable in that, but as I neared McGinnis's Court I presently met another
                     small boy, also eating a banana. A third small boy engaged in a like occupation
                     obtruded a painful coincidence upon my mind. I leave the psychological reader
                     to determine the exact co-relation between this circumstance and the sickening
                     sense of loss that overcame me on witnessing it. I reached my room—and found
                     the bunch of bananas was gone.</p>
                  <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6646-00000105"/>
                  <p>There was but one who knew of their existence, but one who frequented my
                     window, but one capable of the gymnastic effort to procure them, and that was—I
                     blush to say it—Melons. Melons the depredator—Melons, despoiled by larger boys
                     of his ill-gotten booty, or reckless and indiscreetly liberal; Melons—now a
                     fugitive on some neighboring house-top. I lit a cigar, and, drawing my chair to
                     the window, sought surcease of sorrow in the contemplation of the
                     fish-geranium. In a few moments something white passed my window at about the
                     level of the edge. There was no mistaking that hoary head, which now
                     represented to me only aged iniquity. It was Melons, that venerable, juvenile
                     hypocrite.</p>
                  <p>He affected not to observe me, and would have withdrawn quietly, but that
                     horrible fascination which causes the murderer to revisit the scene of his
                     crime, impelled him toward my window. I smoked calmly and gazed at him without
                     speaking. He walked several times up and down the court with a half-rigid,
                     half-belligerent expression of eye and shoulder, intended to represent the
                     carelessness of innocence.</p>
                  <p>Once of twice he stopped, and putting his arms their whole length into his
                     capacious trousers, gazed with some interest at the additional width they thus
                     acquired. Then he whistled. The singular conflicting conditions of John Brown's
                     body and soul were at that time beginning to attract the attention of youth,
                     and Melons's performance of that melody was always remarkable. But to-day he
                     whistled falsely and shrilly between his teeth. At last he met my eye. He
                     winced slightly, but recovered himself, and going to the fence, stood for a few
                     moments on his hands, with his bare feet quivering in the air. Then he turned
                     toward me and threw out a conversational preliminary.</p>
                  <p>"They is a cirkis"—said Melons gravely, hanging with his back to the fence and
                     his arms twisted around the palings—"a cirkis over yonder!"—indicating the
                     locality with his foot—"with hosses, and hossback riders. They is a man wot
                     rides six hosses to onct—six hosses to onct—and nary saddle"—and he paused in
                     expectation.</p>
                  <p>Even this equestrian novelty did not affect me. I still kept a fixed gaze on
                     Melons's eye, and he began to tremble and visibly shrink in his capacious
                     garment. Some other desperate means—conversation with Melons was always a
                     desperate means—must be resorted to. He recommenced more artfully.</p>
                  <p>"Do you know Carrots?"</p>
                  <p>I had a faint remembrance of a boy of that euphonious name, with scarlet hair,
                     who was a playmate and persecutor of Melons. But I said nothing.</p>
                  <p>"Carrots is a bad boy. Killed a policeman onct.<pb n="208-209"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000106"/> Wears a dirk knife in his boots, saw him to-day
                     looking in your windy."</p>
                  <p>I felt that this must end here. I rose sternly and addressed Melons.</p>
                  <p>"Melons, this is all irrelevant and impertinent to the case. <emph>You</emph>
                     took those bananas. Your proposition regarding Carrots, even if I were inclined
                     to accept it as credible information, does not alter the material issue. You
                     took those bananas. The offence under the statutes of California is felony. How
                     far Carrots may have been accessory to the fact either before or after, is not
                     my intention at present to discuss. The act is complete. Your present conduct
                     shows the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">animo furandi</foreign> to have been equally
                     clear."</p>
                  <p>By the time I had finished this exordium, Melons had disappeared, as I fully
                     expected.</p>
                  <p>He never reappeared. The remorse that I have experienced for the part I had
                     taken in what I fear may have resulted in his utter and complete extermination,
                     alas, he may not know, except through these pages. For I have never seen him
                     since. Whether he ran away and went to sea to reappear at some future day as
                     the most ancient of mariners, or whether he buried himself completely in his
                     trousers, I never shall know. I have read the papers anxiously for accounts of
                     him. I have gone to the Police Office in the vain attempt of identifying him as
                     a lost child. But I never saw him or heard of him since. Strange fears have
                     sometimes crossed my mind that his venerable appearance may have been actually
                     the result of senility, and that he may have been gathered peacefully to his
                     fathers in a green old age. I have even had doubts of his existence, and have
                     sometimes thought that he was providentially and mysteriously offered to fill
                     the void I have before alluded to. In that hope I have written these pages.</p>

                  <head>SURPRISING ADVENTURES OF MASTER CHARLES SUMMERTON.</head>
                  <p>AT exactly half past nine o'clock on the morning of Saturday, August 26, 1865,
                     Master Charles Summerton, aged five years, disappeared mysteriously from his
                     paternal residence on Folsom Street, San Francisco. At twenty-five minutes past
                     nine he had been observed, by the butcher, amusing himself by going through
                     that popular youthful exercise known as "turning the crab," a feat in which he
                     was singularly proficient. At a court of inquiry summarily held in the back
                     parlor at 10.15, Bridget, cook, deposed to have detected him at twenty minutes
                     past nine, in the felonious abstraction of sugar from the pantry, which, by the
                     same token, had she known what was a-comin', she'd have never previnted.
                     Patsey, a shrill-voiced youth from a neighboring alley, testified to have seen
                     "Chowley" at half past nine, in front of the butcher's shop round the corner,
                     but as this young gentleman chose to throw out the gratuitous belief that the
                     missing child had been converted into sausages by the butcher, his testimony
                     was received with some caution by the female portion of the court, and with
                     downright scorn and contumely by its masculine members. But whatever might have
                     been the hour of his departure, it was certain that from half past ten A.M.
                     until nine P.M., when he was brought home by a policeman, Charles Summerton was
                     missing. Being naturally of a reticent disposition, he has since resisted, with
                     but one exception, any attempt to wrest from him a statement of his whereabouts
                     during that period. That exception has been myself. He has related to me the
                     following in the strictest confidence.</p>
                  <p>His intention on leaving the door-steps of his dwelling was to proceed without
                     delay to Van Die-man's Land, by way of Second and Market streets. This project
                     was subsequently modified so far as to permit a visit to Otaheite, where
                     Captain Cook was killed. The outfit for his voyage consisted of two
                     car-tickets, five cents in silver, a fishing-line, the brass capping of a spool
                     of cotton, which, in his eyes, bore some resemblance to metallic currency, and
                     a Sunday-school library ticket. His garments, admirably adapted to the
                     exigencies of any climate, were severally a straw hat with a pink ribbon, a
                     striped shirt, over which a pair of trousers, uncommonly wide in comparison to
                     their length, were buttoned, striped balmoral stockings, which gave his
                     youthful legs something of the appearance of wintergreen candy, and copper-toed
                     shoes with iron heels, capable of striking fire from any flagstone<pb
                        n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6646-00000108"/> stone. This latter quality, Master
                     Charley could not help feeling, would be of infinite service to him in the
                     wilds of Van Dieman's Land, which, as pictorially represented in his geography,
                     seemed to be deficient in corner groceries and matches.</p>
                  <p>Exactly as the clock struck the half-hour, the short legs and straw hat of
                     Master Charles Summerton disappeared around the corner. He ran rapidly, partly
                     by way of inuring himself to the fatigues of the journey before him, and partly
                     by way of testing his speed with that of a North Beach car which was proceeding
                     in his direction. The conductor, not being aware of this generous and lofty
                     emulation, and being somewhat concerned at the spectacle of a pair of very
                     short, twinkling legs so far in the rear, stopped his car and generously
                     assisted the youthful Summerton upon the platform. From this point a hiatus of
                     several hours' duration occurs in Charles's narrative. He is under the
                     impression that he "rode out" not only his two tickets, but that he became
                     subsequently indebted to the company for several trips to and from the opposite
                     termini, and that at last, resolutely refusing to give any explanation of his
                     conduct, he was finally ejected, much to his relief, on a street corner.
                     Although, as he informs us, he felt perfectly satisfied with this arrangement,
                     he was impelled under the circumstances to hurl after the conductor an
                     opprobrious appellation which he had ascertained from Patsey was the correct
                     thing in such emergencies, and possessed peculiarly exasperating
                     properties.</p>
                  <p>We now approach a thrilling part of the narrative, before which most of the
                     adventures of the "Boy's Own Book" pale into insignificance. There are times
                     when the recollection of this adventure causes Master Charles to break out in a
                     cold sweat, and he has several times since its occurrence been awakened by
                     lamentations and outcries in the night season by merely dreaming of it. On the
                     corner of the street lay several large empty sugar hogsheads. A few young
                     gentlemen disported themselves therein, armed with sticks, with which they
                     removed the sugar which still adhered to the joints of the staves, and conveyed
                     it to their mouths. Finding a cask not yet preëmpted, Master Charles set to
                     work, and for a few moments revelled in a wild saccharine dream, whence he was
                     finally roused by an angry voice and the rapidly retreating footsteps of his
                     comrades. An ominous sound smote his ear, and the next moment he felt the cask
                     wherein he lay uplifted and set upright against the wall. He was a prisoner,
                     but as yet undiscovered. Being satisfied in his mind that hanging was the
                     systematic and legalized penalty for the outrage he had committed, he kept down
                     manfully the cry that rose to his lips.</p>
                  <p>In a few moments he felt the cask again lifted<pb n="214-215"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000109"/> by a powerful hand, which appeared above him at
                     the edge of his prison, and which he concluded belonged to the ferocious giant
                     Blunderbore, whose features and limbs he had frequently met in colored
                     pictures. Before he could recover from his astonishment, his cask was placed
                     with several others on a cart, and rapidly driven away. The ride which ensued
                     he describes as being fearful in the extreme. Rolled around like a pill in a
                     box, the agonies which he suffered may be hinted at, not spoken. Evidences of
                     that protracted struggle were visible in his garments, which were of the
                     consistency of syrup, and his hair, which for several hours, under the
                     treatment of hot water, yielded a thin treacle. At length the cart stopped on
                     one of the wharves, and the cartman began to unload. As he tilted over the cask
                     in which Charles lay, an exclamation broke from his lips, and the edge of the
                     cask fell from his hands, sliding its late occupant upon the wharf. To regain
                     his short legs, and to put the greatest possible distance between himself and
                     the cartman, were his first movements on regaining his liberty. He did not stop
                     until he reached the corner of Front Street.</p>
                  <p>Another blank succeeds in this veracious history. He cannot remember how or
                     when he found himself in front of the circus tent. He has an indistinct
                     recollection of having passed through a long street of stores which were all
                     closed, and which made him fear that it was Sunday, and that he had spent a
                     miserable night in the sugar cask. But he remembers hearing the sound of music
                     within the tent, and of creeping on his hands and knees, when no one was
                     looking, until he passed under the canvas. His description of the wonders
                     contained within that circle; of the terrific feats which were performed by a
                     man on a pole, since practised by him in the back yard; of the horses, one of
                     which was spotted and resembled an animal in his Noah's Ark, hitherto
                     unrecognized and undefined; of the female equestrians, whose dresses could only
                     be equalled in magnificence by the frocks of his sister's doll; of the painted
                     clown, whose jokes excited a merriment, somewhat tinged by an undefined fear,
                     was an effort of language which this pen could but weakly transcribe, and which
                     no quantity of exclamation points could sufficiently illustrate. He is not
                     quite certain what followed. He remembers that almost immediately on leaving
                     the circus it became dark, and that he fell asleep, waking up at intervals on
                     the corners of the streets, on front steps, in somebody's arms, and finally in
                     his own bed. He was not aware of experiencing any regret for his conduct; he
                     does not recall feeling at any time a disposition to go home; he remembers
                     distinctly that he felt hungry.</p>
                  <p>He has made this disclosure in confidence. He wishes it to be respected. He
                     wants to know if you have five cents about you.</p>

                  <head>SIDEWALKINGS.</head>
                  <p>THE time occupied in walking to and from my business I have always found to
                     yield me a certain mental enjoyment which no other part of the twenty-four
                     hours could give. Perhaps the physical exercise may have acted as a gentle
                     stimulant of the brain, but more probably the comfortable consciousness that I
                     could not reasonably be expected to be doing anything else—to be studying or
                     improving my mind, for instance—always gave a joyous liberty to my fancy. I
                     once thought it necessary to employ this interval in doing sums in
                     arithmetic,—in which useful study I was and still am lamentably deficient,—but
                     after one or two attempts at peripatetic computation, I gave it up. I am
                     satisfied that much enjoyment is lost to the world by this nervous anxiety to
                     improve our leisure moments, which, like the "shining hours" of Dr. Watts,
                     unfortunately offer the greatest facilities for idle pleasure. I feel a
                     profound pity for those misguided beings who are still impelled to carry
                     text-books with them in cars, omnibuses, and ferryboats, and who generally
                     manage to defraud themselves of those intervals of rest they most require.
                     Nature must have her fallow moments, when she covers her exhausted fields with
                     flowers instead of grain. Deny her this, and the next crop suffers for it. I
                     offer this axiom as some apology for obtruding upon the reader a few of the
                     speculations which have engaged my mind during these daily perambulations.</p>
                  <p>Few Californians know how to lounge gracefully. Business habits, and a
                     deference to the custom, even with those who have no business, give an air of
                     restless anxiety to every pedestrian. The exceptions to this rule are apt to go
                     to the other extreme, and wear a defiant, obtrusive kind of indolence which
                     suggests quite as much inward disquiet and unrest. The shiftless lassitude of a
                     gambler can never be mistaken for the lounge of a gentleman. Even the brokers
                     who loiter upon Montgomery Street at high noon are not loungers. Look at them
                     closely and you will see a feverishness and anxiety under the mask of
                     listlessness. They do not lounge—they lie in wait. No surer sign, I imagine, of
                     our peculiar civilization can be found than this lack of repose in its
                     constituent elements. You cannot keep Californians quiet even in their
                     amusements. They dodge in and out of the theatre, opera, and lecture-room; they
                     prefer the street cars to walking because they think they get along faster. The
                     difference of locomotion between Broadway, New York, and Montgomery Street, San
                     Francisco, is a<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6646-00000111"/> comparative view of
                     Eastern and Western civilization.</p>
                  <p>There is a habit peculiar to many walkers, which Punch, some years ago, touched
                     upon satirically, but which seems to have survived the jester's ridicule. It is
                     that custom of stopping friends in the street, to whom we have nothing whatever
                     to communicate, but whom we embarrass for no other purpose than simply to show
                     our friendship. Jones meets his friend Smith, whom he has met in nearly the
                     same locality but a few hours before. During that interval, it is highly
                     probable that no event of any importance to Smith, nor indeed to Jones, which
                     by a friendly construction Jones could imagine Smith to be interested in, has
                     occurred, or is likely to occur. Yet both gentlemen stop and shake hands
                     earnestly. "Well, how goes it?" remarks Smith with a vague hope that something
                     may have happened. "So so," replies the eloquent Jones, feeling intuitively the
                     deep vacuity of his friend answering to his own. A pause ensues, in which both
                     gentlemen regard each other with an imbecile smile and a fervent pressure of
                     the hand. Smith draws a long breath and, looks up the street; Jones sighs
                     heavily and gazes down the street. Another pause, in which both gentlemen
                     disengage their respective hands and glance anxiously around for some
                     conventional avenue of escape. Finally, Smith (with a sudden assumption of
                     having forgotten gotten an important engagement) ejaculates, "Well, I must be
                     off,"—a remark instantly echoed by the voluble Jones, and these gentlemen
                     separate, only to repeat their miserable formula the next day. In the above
                     example I have compassionately shortened the usual leave-taking, which, in
                     skilful hands, may be protracted to a length which I shudder to recall. I have
                     sometimes, when an active participant in these atrocious transactions, lingered
                     in the hope of saying something natural to my friend (feeling that he, too, was
                     groping in the mazy labyrinths of his mind for a like expression), until I have
                     felt that we ought to have been separated by a policeman. It is astonishing how
                     far the most wretched joke will go in these emergencies, and how it will, as it
                     were, convulsively detach the two cohering particles. I have laughed (albeit
                     hysterically) at some witticism under cover of which I escaped, that five
                     minutes afterward I could not perceive possessed a grain of humor. I would
                     advise any person who may fall into this pitiable strait, that, next to getting
                     in the way of a passing dray and being forcibly disconnected, a joke is the
                     most efficacious. A foreign phrase often may be tried with success; I have
                     sometimes known <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Au revoir</foreign> pronounced
                     "O-reveer," to have the effect (as it ought) of severing friends.</p>
                  <p>But this is a harmless habit compared to a certain reprehensible practice in
                     which sundry feeble-minded<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6646-00000112"/> minded
                     young men indulge. I have been stopped in the street and enthusiastically
                     accosted by some fashionable young man, who has engaged me in animated
                     conversation, until (quite accidentally) a certain young belle would pass, whom
                     my friend, of course, saluted. As, by a strange coincidence, this occurred
                     several times in the course of the week, and as my young friend's
                     conversational powers invariably flagged after the lady had passed, I am forced
                     to believe that the deceitful young wretch actually used me as a conventional
                     background to display the graces of his figure to the passing fair. When I
                     detected the trick, of course I made a point of keeping my friend, by strategic
                     movements, with his back toward the young lady, while I bowed to her myself.
                     Since then, I understand that it is a regular custom of these callow youths to
                     encounter each other, with simulated cordiality, some paces in front of the
                     young lady they wish to recognize, so that she cannot possibly cut them. The
                     corner of California and Montgomery streets is their favorite haunt. They may
                     be easily detected by their furtive expression of eye, which betrays them even
                     in the height of their apparent enthusiasm.</p>
                  <p>Speaking of eyes, you can generally settle the average gentility and good
                     breeding of the people you meet in the street by the manner in which they
                     return or evade your glance. "A gentleman," as the Autocrat has wisely said, is
                     always "calm-eyed." There is just enough abstraction in his look to denote his
                     individual power and the capacity for self-contemplation, while he is,
                     nevertheless, quietly and unobtrusively observant. He does not seek, neither
                     does he evade your observation. Snobs and prigs do the first; bashful and mean
                     people do the second. There are some men who, on meeting your eye, immediately
                     assume an expression quite different from the one which they previously wore,
                     which, whether an improvement or not, suggests a disagreeable
                     self-consciousness. Perhaps they fancy they are betraying something. There are
                     others who return your look with unnecessary defiance, which suggests a like
                     concealment. The symptoms of the eye are generally borne out in the figure. A
                     man is very apt to betray his character by the manner in which he appropriates
                     his part of the sidewalk. The man, who resolutely keeps the middle of the
                     pavement, and deliberately brushes against you, you may be certain would take
                     the last piece of pie at the hotel table, and empty the cream-jug on its way to
                     your cup. The man who sidles by you, keeping close to the houses, and selecting
                     the easiest planks, manages to slip through life in some such way, and to evade
                     its sternest duties. The awkward man, who gets in your way, and throws you back
                     upon the man behind you, and so manages to derange the<pb n="222-223"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000113"/> harmonious procession of an entire block, is
                     very apt to do the same thing in political and social economy. The inquisitive
                     man, who deliberately shortens his pace, so that he may participate in the
                     confidence you impart to your companion, has an eye not unfamiliar to keyholes,
                     and probably opens his wife's letters. The loud man, who talks with the
                     intention of being overheard, is the same egotist elsewhere. If there was any
                     justice in Iago's sneer, that there were some "so weak of soul that in their
                     sleep they mutter their affairs," what shall be said of the walking
                     revery-babblers? I have met men who were evidently rolling over, "like a sweet
                     morsel under the tongue," some speech they were about to make, and others who
                     were framing curses. I remember once that, while walking behind an apparently
                     respectable old gentleman, he suddenly uttered the exclamation, "Well, I'm
                     d—d!" and then quietly resumed his usual manner. Whether he had at that moment
                     become impressed with a truly orthodox disbelief in his ultimate salvation, or
                     whether he was simply indignant, I never could tell.</p>
                  <p>I have been hesitating for some time to speak—or if indeed to speak at all—of
                     that lovely and critic-defying sex, whose bright eyes and voluble prattle have
                     not been without effect in tempering the austerities of my peripatetic musing.
                     I have been humbly thankful that I have been permitted to view their bright
                     dresses and those charming bonnets which seem to have brought the birds and
                     flowers of spring within the dreary limits of the town, and—I trust I shall not
                     be deemed unkind in saying it—my pleasure was not lessened by the reflection
                     that the display, to me at least, was inexpensive. I have walked in—and I fear
                     occasionally on—the train of the loveliest of her sex who has preceded me. If I
                     have sometimes wondered why two young ladies always began to talk vivaciously
                     on the approach of any good-looking fellow; if I have wondered whether the
                     mirror-like qualities of all large show-windows at all influenced their
                     curiosity regarding silks and calicoes; if I have ever entertained the same
                     ungentlemanly thought concerning daguerreotype show-cases; if I have ever
                     misinterpreted the eye-shot which has passed between two pretty women—more
                     searching, exhaustive and sincere than any of our feeble ogles; if I have ever
                     committed these or any other impertinences, it was only to retire beaten and
                     discomfited, and to confess that masculine philosophy, while it soars beyond
                     Sirius and the ring of Saturn, stops short at the steel periphery which
                     encompasses the simplest school-girl.</p>

                  <head>A BOYS' DOG.</head>
                  <p>AS I lift my eyes from the paper, I observe a dog lying on the steps of the
                     opposite house. His attitude might induce passers-by and casual observers to
                     believe him to belong to the people who live there, and to accord to him a
                     certain standing position. I have seen visitors pat him, under the impression
                     that they were doing an act of courtesy to his master, he lending himself to
                     the fraud by hypocritical contortions of the body. But his attitude is one of
                     deceit and simulation. He has neither master nor habitation. He is a very
                     Pariah and outcast; in brief, "A Boys' Dog."</p>
                  <p>There is a degree of hopeless and irreclaimable vagabondage expressed in this
                     epithet, which may not be generally understood. Only those who are familiar
                     with the roving nature and predatory instincts of boys in large cities will
                     appreciate its strength. It is the lowest step in the social scale to which a
                     respectable canine can descend. A blind man's dog, or the companion of a
                     knife-grinder, is comparatively elevated. He at least owes allegiance to but
                     one master. But the Boys' Dog is the thrall of an entire juvenile community,
                     obedient to the beck and call of the smallest imp in the neighborhood, attached
                     to and serving not the individual boy so much as the boy element and principle.
                     In their active sports, in small thefts, raids into back-yards,
                     window-breaking, and other minor juvenile recreations, he is a full
                     participant. In this way he is the reflection of the wickedness of many
                     masters, without possessing the virtues or peculiarities of any particular
                     one.</p>
                  <p>If leading a "dog's life" be considered a peculiar phase of human misery, the
                     life of a Boys' Dog is still more infelicitous. He is associated in all schemes
                     of wrong-doing, and unless he be a dog of experience is always the scapegoat.
                     He never shares the booty of his associates. In absence of legitimate
                     amusement, he is considered fair game for his companions; and I have seen him
                     reduced to the ignominy of having a tin kettle tied to his tail. His ears and
                     tail have generally been docked to suit the caprice of the unholy band of which
                     he is a member; and if he has any spunk, he is invariably pitted against larger
                     dogs in mortal combat. He is poorly fed and hourly abused; the reputation of
                     his associates debars him from outside sympathies; and once a Boys' Dog, he
                     cannot change his condition. He is not unfrequently sold into slavery by his
                     inhuman companions. I remember once to have been accosted on my own doorsteps
                     by a couple of precocious youths, who<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6646-00000115"
                     /> offered to sell me a dog which they were then leading by a rope. The price
                     was extremely moderate, being, if I remember rightly, but fifty cents.
                     Imagining the unfortunate animal to have lately fallen into their wicked hands,
                     and anxious to reclaim him from the degradation of becoming a Boys' Dog, I was
                     about to conclude the bargain, when I saw a look of intelligence pass between
                     the dog and his two masters. I promptly stopped all negotiation, and drove the
                     youthful swindlers and their four-footed accomplice from my presence. The whole
                     thing was perfectly plain. The dog was an old, experienced, and hardened Boys'
                     Dog, and I was perfectly satisfied that he would run away and rejoin his old
                     companions at the first opportunity. This I afterwards learned he did, on the
                     occasion of a kind-hearted but unsophisticated neighbor buying him; and a few
                     days ago I saw him exposed for sale by those two Arcadians, in another
                     neighborhood, having been bought and paid for half a dozen times in this.</p>
                  <p>But, it will be asked, if the life of a Boys' Dog is so unhappy, why do they
                     enter upon such an unenviable situation, and why do they not dissolve the
                     partnership when it becomes unpleasant? I will confess that I have been often
                     puzzled by this question. For some time I could not make up my mind whether
                     their unholy alliance was the result of the influence of the dog on the boy, or
                        <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vice versa</foreign>, and which was the weakest and
                     most impressible nature. I am satisfied now that, at first, the dog is
                     undoubtedly influenced by the boy, and, as it were, is led, while yet a puppy,
                     from the paths of canine rectitude by artful and designing boys. As he grows
                     older and more experienced in the ways of his Bohemian friends, he becomes a
                     willing decoy, and takes delight in leading boyish innocence astray, in
                     beguiling children to play truant, and thus revenges his own degradation on the
                     boy nature generally. It is in this relation, and in regard to certain
                     unhallowed practices I have detected him in, that I deem it proper to expose to
                     parents and guardians the danger to which their offspring is exposed by the
                     Boys' Dog.</p>
                  <p>The Boys' Dog lays his plans artfully. He begins to influence the youthful mind
                     by suggestions of unrestrained freedom and frolic which he offers in his own
                     person. He will lie in wait at the garden gate for a very small boy, and
                     endeavor to lure him outside its sacred precincts, by gambolling and jumping a
                     little beyond the inclosure. He will set off on an imaginary chase and run
                     around the block in a perfectly frantic manner, and then return, breathless, to
                     his former position, with a look as of one who would say, "There, you see how
                     perfectly easy it's done!" Should the unhappy infant find it difficult to
                     resist the effect which this glimpse of the area of freedom produces<pb
                        n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6646-00000116"/> duces, and step beyond the gate,
                     from that moment he is utterly demoralized. The Boys' Dog owns him body and
                     soul. Straightway he is led by the deceitful brute into the unhallowed circle
                     of his Bohemian masters. Sometimes the unfortunate boy, if he be very small,
                     turns up eventually at the station-house as a lost child. Whenever I meet a
                     stray boy in the street looking utterly bewildered and astonished, I generally
                     find a Boys' Dog lurking on the corner. When I read the advertisements of lost
                     children, I always add mentally to the description, "was last seen in company
                     with a Boys' Dog." Nor is his influence wholly confined to small boys. I have
                     seen him waiting patiently for larger boys on the way to school, and by artful
                     and sophistical practices inducing them to play truant. I have seen him lying
                     at the school-house door, with the intention of enticing the children on their
                     way home to distant and remote localities. He has led many an unsuspecting boy
                     to the wharves and quays by assuming the character of a water-dog, which he was
                     not, and again has induced others to go with him on a gunning excursion by
                     pretending to be a sporting dog, in which quality he was knowingly deficient.
                     Unscrupulous, hypocritical, and deceitful, he has won many children's hearts by
                     answering to any name they might call him, attaching himself to their persons
                     until they got into trouble, and deserting them at the very moment they most
                     needed his assistance. I have seen him rob small school-boys of their dinners
                     by pretending to knock them down by accident; and have seen larger boys in turn
                     dispossess him of his ill-gotten booty for their own private gratification.
                     From being a tool, he has grown to be an accomplice; through much imposition,
                     he has learned to impose on others; in his best character, he is simply a
                     vagabond's vagabond.</p>
                  <p>I could find it in my heart to pity him, as he lies there through the long
                     summer afternoon, enjoying brief intervals of tranquillity and rest which he
                     surreptitiously snatches from a stranger's door-step. For a shrill whistle is
                     heard in the streets, the boys are coming home from school, and he is startled
                     from his dreams by a deftly thrown potato, which hits him on the head, and
                     awakens him to the stern reality that he is now and forever—a Boys' Dog.</p>

                  <head>CHARITABLE REMINISCENCES.</head>
                  <p>AS the new Benevolent Association has had the effect of withdrawing beggars
                     from the streets, and as Professional Mendicancy bids fair to be presently
                     ranked with the Lost Arts, to preserve some records of this noble branch of
                     industry, I have endeavored to recall certain traits and peculiarities of
                     individual members of the order whom I have known, and whose forms I now miss
                     from their accustomed haunts. In so doing, I confess to feeling a certain
                     regret at this decay of Professional Begging, for I hold the theory that
                     mankind are bettered by the occasional spectacle of misery, whether simulated
                     or not, on the same principle that our sympathies are enlarged by the
                     fictitious woes of the Drama, though we know that the actors are insincere.
                     Perhaps I am indiscreet in saying that I have rewarded the artfully dressed and
                     well-acted performance of the begging impostor through the same impulse that
                     impelled me to expend a dollar in witnessing the counterfeited sorrows of poor
                     "Triplet," as represented by Charles Wheatleigh. I did not quarrel with deceit
                     in either case. My coin was given in recognition of the sentiment; the moral
                     responsibility rested with the performer.</p>
                  <p>The principal figure that I now mourn over as lost forever is one that may have
                     been familiar to many of my readers. It was that of a dark-complexioned,
                     black-eyed, foreign-looking woman, who supported in her arms a sickly baby. As
                     a pathological phenomenon the baby was especially interesting, having presented
                     the Hippocratic face and other symptoms of immediate dissolution, without
                     change, for the past three years. The woman never verbally solicited alms. Her
                     appearance was always mute, mysterious, and sudden. She made no other appeal
                     than that which the dramatic tableau of herself and baby suggested, with an
                     outstretched hand and deprecating eye sometimes superadded. She usually stood
                     in my doorway, silent and patient, intimating her presence, if my attention
                     were preoccupied, by a slight cough from her baby, whom I shall always believe
                     had its part to play in this little pantomime, and generally obeyed a secret
                     signal from the maternal hand. It was useless for me to refuse alms, to plead
                     business, or affect inattention. She never moved; her position was always taken
                     with an appearance of latent capabilities of endurance and experience in
                     waiting which never failed to impress me with awe and the futility of any hope
                     of escape. There was also something in the reproachful expression of her eye
                        which<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6646-00000118"/> plainly said to me, as I
                     bent over my paper, "Go on with your mock sentimentalities and simulated
                     pathos; portray the imaginary sufferings of your bodiless creations, spread
                     your thin web of philosophy, but look you, sir, here is real misery! Here is
                     genuine suffering!" I confess that this artful suggestion usually brought me
                     down. In three minutes after she had thus invested the citadel I usually
                     surrendered at discretion, without a gun having been fired on either side. She
                     received my offering and retired as mutely and mysteriously as she had
                     appeared. Perhaps it was well for me that she did not know her strength. I
                     might have been forced, had this terrible woman been conscious of her real
                     power, to have borrowed money which I could not pay, or have forged a check to
                     purchase immunity from her awful presence. I hardly know if I make myself
                     understood, and yet I am unable to define my meaning more clearly when I say
                     that there was something in her glance which suggested to the person appealed
                     to, when in the presence of others, a certain idea of some individual
                     responsibility for her sufferings, which, while it never failed to affect him
                     with a mingled sense of ludicrousness and terror, always made an impression of
                     unqualified gravity on the minds of the bystanders. As she has disappeared
                     within the last month, I imagine that she has found a home at the San Francisco
                     Benevolent Association. —at least, I cannot conceive of any charity, however
                     guarded by wholesome checks or sharp-eyed almoners, that could resist that mute
                     apparition. I should like to go there and inquire about her, and also learn if
                     the baby was convalescent or dead, but I am satisfied that she would rise up, a
                     mute and reproachful appeal, so personal in its artful suggestions, that it
                     would end in the Association instantly transferring her to my hands.</p>
                  <p>My next familiar mendicant was a vender of printed ballads. These effusions
                     were so stale, atrocious, and unsalable in their character, that it was easy to
                     detect that hypocrisy, which—in imitation of more ambitious beggary—veiled the
                     real eleemosynary appeal under the thin pretext of offering an equivalent. This
                     beggar—an aged female in a rusty bonnet—I unconsciously precipitated upon
                     myself in an evil moment. On our first meeting, while distractedly turning over
                     the ballads, I came upon a certain production entitled, I think, "The Fire
                     Zouave," and was struck with the truly patriotic and American manner in which
                     "Zouave" was made to rhyme in different stanzas with "grave, brave, save, and
                     glaive." As I purchased it at once, with a gratified expression of countenance,
                     it soon became evident that the act was misconstrued by my poor friend, who
                     from that moment never ceased to haunt me. Perhaps in the whole course of her
                     precarious existence<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6646-00000119"/> she had never
                     before sold a ballad. My solitary purchase evidently made me, in her eyes, a
                     customer, and in a measure exalted her vocation; so thereafter she regularly
                     used to look in at my door, with a chirping, confident air, and the question,
                     "Any more songs to-day?" as though it were some necessary article of daily
                     consumption. I never took any more of her songs, although that circumstance did
                     not shake her faith in my literary taste; my abstinence from this exciting
                     mental pabulum being probably ascribed to charitable motives. She was finally
                     absorbed by the S. F. B. A., who have probably made a proper disposition of her
                     effects. She was a little old woman, of Celtic origin, predisposed to
                     melancholy, and looking as if she had read most of her ballads.</p>
                  <p>My next reminiscence takes the shape of a very seedy individual, who had, for
                     three or four years, been vainly attempting to get back to his relatives in
                     Illinois, where sympathizing friends and a comfortable almshouse awaited him.
                     Only a few dollars, he informed me,—the uncontributed remainder of the amount
                     necessary to purchase a steerage ticket,—stood in his way. These last few
                     dollars seem to have been most difficult to get, and he had wandered about, a
                     sort of antithetical Flying Dutchman, forever putting to sea, yet never getting
                     away from shore. He was a "49-er," and had recently been blown up in a tunnel,
                     or had fallen down a shaft, I forget which. This sad accident obliged him to
                     use large quantities of whiskey as a liniment, which, he informed me,
                     occasioned the mild fragrance which his garments exhaled. Though belonging to
                     the same class, he was not to be confounded with the unfortunate miner who
                     could not get back to his claim without pecuniary assistance, or the desolate
                     Italian, who hopelessly handed you a document in a foreign language, very much
                     bethumbed and illegible,—which, in your ignorance of the tongue, you could n't
                     help suspiciously feeling might have been a price current, but which you could
                     see was proffered as an excuse for alms. Indeed, whenever any stranger handed
                     me, without speaking, an open document, which bore the marks of having been
                     carried in the greasy lining of a hat, I always felt safe in giving him a
                     quarter and dismissing him without further questioning. I always noticed that
                     these circular letters, when written in the vernacular, were remarkable for
                     their beautiful caligraphy and grammatical inaccuracy, and that they all seem
                     to have been written by the same hand. Perhaps indigence exercises a peculiar
                     and equal effect upon the handwriting.</p>
                  <p>I recall a few occasional mendicants whose faces were less familiar. One
                     afternoon a most extraordinary Irishman, with a black eye, a bruised hat, and
                     other traces of past enjoyment, waited upon<pb n="236-237"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000120"/> me with a pitiful story of destitution and want,
                     and concluded by requesting the usual trifle. I replied, with some severity,
                     that if I gave him a dime he would probably spend it for drink. "Be Gorra! but
                     you 're roight—I wad that!" he answered promptly. I was so much taken aback by
                     this unexpected exhibition of frankness that I instantly handed over the dime.
                     It seems that Truth had survived the wreck of his other virtues; he did get
                     drunk, and, impelled by a like conscientious sense of duty, exhibited himself
                     to me in that state a few hours after, to show that my bounty had not been
                     misapplied.</p>
                  <p>In spite of the peculiar characters of these reminiscences, I cannot help
                     feeling a certain regret at the decay of Professional Mendicancy. Perhaps it
                     may be owing to a lingering trace of that youthful superstition which saw in
                     all beggars a possible prince or fairy, and invested their calling with a
                     mysterious awe. Perhaps it may be from a belief that there is something in the
                     old-fashioned alms-givings and actual contact with misery that is wholesome for
                     both donor and recipient, and that any system which interposes a third party
                     between them is only putting on a thick glove, which, while it preserves us
                     from contagion, absorbs and deadens the kindly pressure of our hand. It is a
                     very pleasant thing to purchase relief from the annoyance and trouble of having
                     to weigh the claims of an afflicted neighbor. As I turn over these printed
                     tickets, which the courtesy of the San Francisco Benevolent Association has—by
                     a slight stretch of the imagination in supposing that any sane unfortunate
                     might rashly seek relief from a newspaper office—conveyed to these editorial
                     hands, I cannot help wondering whether, when in our last extremity we come to
                     draw upon the Immeasurable Bounty, it will be necessary to present a
                     ticket.</p>

                  <head>"SEEING THE STEAMER OFF."</head>
                  <p>I HAVE sometimes thought, while watching the departure of an Eastern steamer,
                     that the act of parting from friends—so generally one of bitterness and
                     despondency—is made by an ingenious Californian custom to yield a pleasurable
                     excitement. This luxury of leave-taking, in which most Californians indulge, is
                     often protracted to the hauling in of the gang-plank. Those last words,
                     injunctions, promises, and embraces, which are mournful and depressing perhaps
                     in that privacy demanded on other occasions, are here, by reason of their very
                     publicity, of an edifying and exhilarating character. A parting kiss, blown
                     from the deck of a steamer into a miscellaneous crowd, of course loses much of
                     that sacred solemnity with which foolish superstition is apt to invest it. A
                     broadside of endearing epithets, even when properly aimed and apparently raking
                     the whole wharf, is apt to be impotent and harmless. A husband who prefers to
                     embrace his wife for the last time at the door of her stateroom, and finds
                     himself the centre of an admiring group of unconcerned spectators, of course
                     feels himself lifted above any feeling save that of ludicrousness which the
                     situation suggests. The mother, parting from her offspring, should become a
                     Roman matron under the like influences; the lover who takes leave of his
                     sweet-heart is not apt to mar the general hilarity by any emotional folly. In
                     fact, this system of delaying our parting sentiments until the last moment—this
                     removal of domestic scenery and incident to a public theatre—may be said to be
                     worthy of a stoical and democratic people, and is an event in our lives which
                     may be shared with the humblest coal-passer or itinerant vender of oranges. It
                     is a return to that classic out-of-door experience and mingling of public and
                     domestic economy which so ennobled the straight-nosed Athenian.</p>
                  <p>So universal is this desire to be present at the departure of any steamer that,
                     aside from the regular crowd of loungers who make their appearance confessedly
                     only to look on, there are others who take advantage of the slightest intimacy
                     to go through the leave-taking formula. People whom you have quite forgotten,
                     people to whom you have been lately introduced, suddenly and unexpectedly make
                     their appearance and wring your hands with fervor. The friend, long estranged,
                     forgives you nobly at the last moment, to take advantage of this glorious
                     opportunity of "seeing you off." Your bootmaker, tailor, and hatter—haply with
                     no ulterior motives and unaccompanied by official friends—visit you<pb
                        n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6646-00000122"/> with enthusiasm. You find great
                     difficulty in detaching your relatives and acquaintances from the trunks on
                     which they resolutely seat themselves, up to the moment when the paddles are
                     moving, and you are haunted continually by an ill-defined idea that they may be
                     carried off, and foisted on you—with the payment of their passage, which, under
                     the circumstances, you could not refuse—for the rest of the voyage. Your
                     friends will make their appearance at the most inopportune moments, and from
                     the most unexpected places,—dangling from hawsers, climbing up paddle-boxes,
                     and crawling through cabin windows at the imminent peril of their lives. You
                     are nervous and crushed by this added weight of responsibility. Should you be a
                     stranger, you will find any number of people on board, who will cheerfully and
                     at a venture take leave of you on the slightest advances made on your part. A
                     friend of mine assures me that he once parted, with great enthusiasm and
                     cordiality, from a party of gentlemen, to him personally unknown, who had
                     apparently mistaken his state-room. This party,—evidently connected with some
                     fire company,—on comparing notes on the wharf, being somewhat dissatisfied with
                     the result of their performances, afterward rendered my friend's position on
                     the hurricane deck one of extreme peril and inconvenience, by reason of
                     skilfully projected oranges and apples, accompanied with some invective. Yet
                     there is certainly something to interest us in the examination of that
                     cheerless damp closet, whose painted wooden walls no furniture or company can
                     make habitable, wherein our friend is to spend so many vapid days and restless
                     nights. The sight of these apartments, yclept <emph>state-rooms</emph>,—Heaven
                     knows why, except it be from their want of cosiness,—is full of keen
                     reminiscences to most Californians who have not outgrown the memories of that
                     dreary interval when, in obedience to nature's wise compensations, homesickness
                     was blotted out by sea-sickness, and both at last resolved into a chaotic and
                     distempered dream, whose details we now recognize. The steamer chair that we
                     used to drag out upon the narrow strip of deck and doze in, over the pages of a
                     well-thumbed novel; the deck itself, of afternoons, redolent with the skins of
                     oranges and bananas, of mornings, damp with salt-water and mopping; the netted
                     bulwark, smelling of tar in the tropics, and fretted on the weather side with
                     little saline crystals; the villanously compounded odors of victuals from the
                     pantry, and oil from the machinery; the young lady that we used to flirt with,
                     and with whom we shared our last novel, adorned with marginal annotations; our
                     own chum; our own bore; the man who was never sea-sick; the two events of the
                     day, breakfast and dinner, and the dreary interval<pb n="242-243"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000123"/> terval between; the tremendous importance giver,
                     to trifling events and trifling people; the young lady who kept a journal; the
                     newspaper, published on board, filled with mild pleasantries and impertinences,
                     elsewhere unendurable; the young lady who sang; the wealthy passenger; the
                     popular passenger; the—</p>
                  <p>[Let us sit down for a moment until this qualmishness, which these associations
                     and some infectious quality of the atmosphere seem to produce, has passed away.
                     What becomes of our steamer friends? Why are we now so apathetic about them?
                     Why is it that we drift away from them so unconcernedly, forgetting even their
                     names and faces? Why, when we do remember them, do we look at them so
                     suspiciously, with an undefined idea that, in the unrestrained freedom of the
                     voyage, they became possessed of some confidence and knowledge of our
                     weaknesses that we never should have imparted? Did we make any such
                     confessions? Perish the thought. The popular man, however, is not now so
                     popular. We have heard finer voices than that of the young lady who sang so
                     sweetly. Our chum's fascinating qualities, somehow, have deteriorated on land;
                     so have those of the fair young novel-reader, now the wife of an honest miner
                     in Virginia City.]</p>
                  <p>—The passenger who made so many trips, and exhibited a reckless familiarity
                     with the officers; the officers themselves, now so modest and undemonstrative,
                     a few hours later so all-powerful and important,—these are among the
                     reminiscences of most Californians, and these are to be remembered among the
                     experiences of our friend. Yet he feels, as we all do, that his past experience
                     will be of profit to him, and has already the confident air of an old
                     voyager.</p>
                  <p>As you stand on the wharf again, and listen to the cries of itinerant fruit
                     venders, you wonder why it is that grief at parting and the unpleasant
                     novelties of travel are supposed to be assuaged by oranges and apples, even at
                     ruinously low prices. Perhaps it may be, figuratively, the last offering of the
                     fruitful earth, as the passenger commits himself to the bosom of the sterile
                     and unproductive ocean. Even while the wheels are moving and the lines are cast
                     off, some hardy apple merchant, mounted on the top of a pile, concludes a trade
                     with a steerage passenger,—twenty feet interposing between buyer and
                     seller,—and achieves, under these difficulties, the delivery of his wares.
                     Handkerchiefs wave, hurried orders mingle with parting blessings, and the
                     steamer is "off". As you turn your face cityward, and glance hurriedly around
                     at the retreating crowd, you will see a reflection of your own wistful face in
                     theirs, and read the solution of one of the problems which perplex the
                     California enthusiast. Before you lies<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6646-00000124"

                     breezes, her bright, but unsympathetic sunshine, her restless and energetic
                     population; behind you fades the recollection of changeful, but honest skies;
                     of extremes of heat and cold, modified and made enjoyable through social and
                     physical laws, of pastoral landscapes, of accessible Nature in her kindliest
                     forms, of inherited virtues, of long-tested customs and habits, of old friends
                     and old faces,—in a word—of HOME!</p>

                     <p>A BAY-WINDOW once settled the choice of my house and compensated for many of
                        its inconveniences. When the chimney smoked, or the doors alternately shrunk
                        and swelled, resisting any forcible attempt to open them, or opening of
                        themselves with ghostly deliberation, or when suspicious blotches appeared
                        on the ceiling in rainy weather, there was always the bay-window to turn to
                        for comfort. And the view was a fine one. Alcatraz, Lime Point, Fort Point,
                        and Saucelito were plainly visible over a restless expanse of water that
                        changed continually, glittering in the sunlight, darkening in rocky shadow,
                        or sweeping in mimic waves on a miniature beach below.</p>
                     <p>Although at first the bay-window was supposed to be sacred to myself and my
                        writing materials, in obedience to some organic law, it by and by became a
                        general lounging-place. A rocking-chair and crochet basket one day found
                        their way there. Then the baby invaded its recesses, fortifying himself
                        behind intrenchments of colored worsteds and spools of cotton, from which he
                        was only dislodged<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6646-00000125"/> by concerted
                        assault, and carried lamenting into captivity. A subtle glamour crept over
                        all who came within its influence. To apply one's self to serious work there
                        was an absurdity. An incoming ship, a gleam on the water, a cloud lingering
                        about Tamalpais, were enough to distract the attention. Reading or writing,
                        the bay-window was always showing something to be looked at. Unfortunately,
                        these views were not always pleasant, but the window gave equal prominence
                        and importance to all, without respect to quality.</p>
                     <p>The landscape in the vicinity was unimproved, but not rural. The adjacent
                        lots had apparently just given up bearing scrub-oaks, but had not seriously
                        taken to bricks and mortar. In one direction the vista was closed by the
                        Home of the Inebriates, not in itself a cheerful-looking building, and, as
                        the apparent terminus of a ramble in a certain direction, having all the
                        effect of a moral lesson. To a certain extent, however, this building was an
                        imposition. The enthusiastic members of my family, who confidently expected
                        to see its inmates hilariously disporting themselves at its windows in the
                        different stages of inebriation portrayed by the late W. E. Burton, were
                        much disappointed. The Home was reticent of its secrets. The Country
                        Hospital, also in range of the bay-window, showed much more animation. At
                        certain hours of the day convalescents passed in review before the window on
                        their way to an airing. This spectacle was the still more depressing from a
                        singular lack of sociability that appeared to prevail among them. Each man
                        was encompassed by the impenetrable atmosphere of his own peculiar
                        suffering. They did not talk or walk together. From the window I have seen
                        half a dozen sunning themselves against a wall within a few feet of each
                        other, to all appearance utterly oblivious of the fact. Had they but
                        quarrelled or fought,—anything would have been better than this horrible
                        apathy.</p>
                     <p>The lower end of the street on which the bay window was situate, opened
                        invitingly from a popular thoroughfare; and after beckoning the unwary
                        stranger into its recesses, ended unexpectedly at a frightful precipice. On
                        Sundays, when the travel North-Beachwards was considerable, the bay-window
                        delighted in the spectacle afforded by unhappy pedestrians who were seduced
                        into taking this street as a short-cut somewhere else. It was amusing to
                        notice how these people invariably, on coming to the precipice, glanced
                        upward to the bay-window and endeavored to assume a careless air before they
                        retraced their steps, whistling ostentatiously, as if they had previously
                        known all about it. One high-spirited young man in particular, being incited
                        thereto by a pair of mischievous bright eyes in an opposite window,<pb
                           n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6646-00000126"/> actually descended this fearful
                        precipice rather than return, to the great peril of life and limb, and
                        manifest injury to his Sunday clothes.</p>
                     <p>Dogs, goats, and horses constituted the <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                           >fauna</foreign> of our neighborhood. Possessing the lawless freedom of
                        their normal condition, they still evinced a tender attachment to man and
                        his habitations. Spirited steeds got up <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                           >extempore</foreign> races on the sidewalks, turning the street into a
                        miniature <hi rend="i"/>Corso; dogs wrangled in the areas; while from the
                        hill beside the house a goat browsed peacefully upon my wife's geraniums in
                        the flower-pots of the second-story window. "We had a fine hail-storm last
                        night," remarked a newly arrived neighbor, who had just moved into the
                        adjoining house. It would have been a pity to set him right, as he was quite
                        enthusiastic about the view and the general sanitary qualifications of the
                        locality. So I did n't tell him anything about the goats who were in the
                        habit of using his house as a stepping-stone to the adjoining hill.</p>
                     <p>But the locality was remarkably healthy. People who fell down the
                        embankments found their wounds heal rapidly in the steady sea-breeze.
                        Ventilation was complete and thorough. The opening of the bay-window
                        produced a current of wholesome air which effectually removed all noxious
                        exhalations, together with the curtains, the hinges of the back door, and
                        the window-shutters. Owing to this peculiarity, some of my writings acquired
                        an extensive circulation and publicity in the neighborhood, which years in
                        another locality might not have produced. Several articles of wearing
                        apparel, which were mysteriously transposed from our clothes-line to that of
                        an humble though honest neighbor, was undoubtedly the result of these
                        sanitary winds. Yet in spite of these advantages I found it convenient in a
                        few months to move. And the result whereof I shall communicate in other
                        papers.</p>

                     <p>"A HOUSE with a fine garden and extensive shrubbery, in a genteel
                        neighborhood," were, if I remember rightly, the general terms of an
                        advertisement which once decided my choice of a dwelling. I should add that
                        this occurred at an early stage of my household experience, when I placed a
                        trustful reliance in advertisements. I have since learned that the most
                        truthful people are apt to indulge a slight vein of exaggeration in
                        describing their own possessions, as though the mere circumstance of going
                        into print were an excuse for a certain kind of mendacity. But I did not
                        fully awaken to this fact until a much later period, when, in answering an
                        advertisement which described a highly advantageous tenement, I was<pb
                           n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6646-00000127"/> referred to the house I then
                        occupied, and from which a thousand inconveniences were impelling me to
                        move.</p>
                     <p>The "fine garden" alluded to was not large, but contained several peculiarly
                        shaped flower-beds. I was at first struck with the singular resemblance
                        which they bore to the mutton-chops that are usually brought on the table at
                        hotels and restaurants,—a resemblance the more striking from the sprigs of
                        parsley which they produced freely. One plat in particular reminded me, not
                        unpleasantly, of a peculiar cake, known to my boyhood as "a bolivar." The
                        owner of the property, however, who seemed to be a man of original æsthetic
                        ideas, had banked up one of these beds with bright-colored sea-shells, so
                        that in rainy weather it suggested an aquarium, and offered the elements of
                        botanical and conchological study in pleasing juxtaposition. I have since
                        thought that the fish-geraniums, which it also bore to a surprising extent,
                        were introduced originally from some such idea of consistency. But it was
                        very pleasant, after dinner, to ramble up and down the gravelly paths (whose
                        occasional boulders reminded me of the dry bed of a somewhat circuitous
                        mining stream), smoking a cigar, or inhaling the rich aroma of fennel, or
                        occasionally stopping to pluck one of the hollyhocks with which the garden
                        abounded. The prolific qualities of this plant alarmed us greatly, for
                        although, in the first transport of enthusiasm, my wife planted several
                        different kinds of flower-seeds, nothing ever came up but hollyhocks; and
                        although, impelled by the same laudable impulse, I procured a copy of
                        "Downing's Landscape Gardening," and a few gardening tools, and worked for
                        several hours in the garden, my efforts were equally futile.</p>
                     <p>The "extensive shrubbery" consisted of several dwarfed trees. One was a very
                        weak young weeping willow, so very limp and maudlin, and so evidently bent
                        on establishing its reputation, that it had to be tied up against the house
                        for support. The dampness of that portion of the house was usually
                        attributed to the presence of this lachrymose shrub. And to these a couple
                        of highly objectionable trees, known, I think, by the name of <hi rend="i"
                        />Malva, which made an inordinate show of cheap blossoms that they were
                        continually shedding, and one or two dwarf oaks, with scaly leaves and a
                        generally spiteful exterior, and you have what was not inaptly termed by our
                        Milesian handmaid "the scrubbery."</p>
                     <p>The gentility of our neighbor suffered a blight from the unwholesome
                        vicinity of McGinnis Court. This court was a kind of <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                           >cul de sac</foreign> that, on being penetrated, discovered a primitive
                        people living in a state of barbarous freedom, and apparently spending the
                        greater portion of their lives on their own<pb n="252-253"
                           xml:id="VAC6646-00000128"/> door-steps. Many of those details of the
                        toilet which a popular prejudice restricts to the dressing-room in other
                        localities, were here performed in the open court without fear and without
                        reproach. Early in the week the court was hid in a choking, soapy mist,
                        which arose from innumerable washtubs. This was followed in a day or two
                        later by an extraordinary exhibition of wearing apparel of divers colors,
                        fluttering on lines like a display of bunting on ship-board, and whose
                        flapping in the breeze was like irregular discharges of musketry. It was
                        evident also that the court exercised a demoralizing influence over the
                        whole neighborhood. A sanguine property-owner once put up a handsome
                        dwelling on the corner of our street, and lived therein; but although he
                        appeared frequently on his balcony, clad in a bright crimson dressing-gown,
                        which made him look like a tropical bird of some rare and gorgeous species,
                        he failed to woo any kindred dressing-gown to the vicinity, and only
                        provoked opprobrious epithets from the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                           >gamins</foreign> of the court. He moved away shortly after, and on going
                        by the house one day, I noticed a bill of "Rooms to let, with board," posted
                        conspicuously on the Corinthian columns of the porch. McGinnis Court had
                        triumphed. An interchange of civilities at once took place between the court
                        and the servants' area of the palatial mansion, and some of the young men
                        boarders exchange playful slang with the adolescent members of the court.
                        From that moment we felt that our claims to gentility were forever
                        abandoned.</p>
                     <p>Yet, we enjoyed intervals of unalloyed contentment. When the twilight toned
                        down the hard outlines of the oaks, and made shadowy clumps and formless
                        masses of other bushes, it was quite romantic to sit by the window and
                        inhale the faint, sad odor of the fennel in the walks below. Perhaps this
                        economical pleasure was much enhanced by a picture in my memory, whose faded
                        colors the odor of this humble plant never failed to restore. So I often sat
                        there of evenings and closed my eyes until the forms and benches of a
                        country school-room came back to me, redolent with the incense of fennel
                        covertly stowed away in my desk, and gazed again in silent rapture on the
                        round, red cheeks and long black braids of that peerless creature whose
                        glance had often caused my cheeks to glow over the preternatural collar,
                        which at that period of my boyhood it was my pride and privilege to wear. As
                        I fear I may be often thought hypercritical and censorious in these
                        articles, I am willing to record this as one of the advantages of our new
                        house, not mentioned in the advertisement, nor chargeable in the rent. May
                        the present tenant, who is a stock-broker, and who impresses me with the
                        idea of having always been called "Mr." from his cradle up, enjoy this
                        advantage, and try sometimes to remember he was a boy!</p>

                     <p>SOON after I moved into Happy Valley I was struck with the remarkable
                        infelicity of its title. Generous as Californians are in the use of
                        adjectives, this passed into the domain of irony. But I was inclined to
                        think it sincere,—the production of a weak but gushing mind, just as the
                        feminine nomenclature of streets in the vicinity was evidently bestowed by
                        one in habitual communion with "Friendship's Gifts" and "Affection's
                        Offerings."</p>
                     <p>Our house on Laura Matilda Street looked somewhat like a toy Swiss
                        Cottage,—a style of architecture so prevalent, that in walking down the
                        block it was quite difficult to resist an impression of fresh glue and pine
                        shavings. The few shade-trees might have belonged originally to those oval
                        Christmas boxes which contain toy villages; and even the people who sat by
                        the windows had a stiffness that made them appear surprisingly unreal and
                        artificial. A little dog belonging to a neighbor was known to the members of
                        my household by the name of "Glass," from the general suggestion he gave of
                        having been spun of that article. Perhaps I have somewhat exaggerated these
                        illustrations of the dapper nicety of our neighborhood,—a neatness and
                        conciseness which I think have a general tendency to belittle, dwarf, and
                        contract their objects. For we gradually fell into small ways and narrow
                        ideas, and to some extent squared the round world outside to the correct
                        angles of Laura Matilda Street.</p>
                     <p>One reason for this insincere quality may have been the fact that the very
                        foundations of our neighborhood were artificial. Laura Matilda Street was
                        "made ground." The land, not yet quite reclaimed, was continually struggling
                        with its old enemy. We had not been long in our new home before we found an
                        older tenant, not yet wholly divested of his rights, who sometimes showed
                        himself in clammy perspiration on the basement walls, whose damp breath
                        chilled our dining-room, and in the night struck a mortal chilliness through
                        the house. There were no patent fastenings that could keep him out,—no writ
                        of unlawful detainer that could eject him. In the winter his presence was
                        quite palpable; he sapped the roots of the trees, he gurgled under the
                        kitchen floor, he wrought an unwholesome greenness on the side of the
                        veranda. In summer he became invisible, but still exercised a familiar
                        influence over the locality. He planted little stitches in the small of the
                        back, sought out old aches and weak joints, and sportively punched the
                        tenants of the Swiss Cottage under the ribs. He inveigled little children to
                        play with him, but his plays generally ended in scarlet fever, diphtheria,
                        whooping-cough, and measles<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6646-00000130"/> sles.
                        He sometimes followed strong men about until they sickened suddenly and took
                        to their beds. But he kept the green-plants in good order, and was very fond
                        of verdure, bestowing it even upon lath and plaster and soulless stone. He
                        was generally invisible, as I have said; but some time after I had moved, I
                        saw him one morning from the hill stretching his gray wings over the valley,
                        like some fabulous vampire, who had spent the night sucking the wholesome
                        juices of the sleepers below, and was sluggish from the effects of his
                        repast. It was then that I recognized him as Malaria, and knew his abode to
                        be the dread Valley of the shadow of Miasma,—miscalled the Happy Valley!</p>
                     <p>On week days there was a pleasant melody of boiler-making from the
                        foundries, and the gas works in the vicinity sometimes lent a mild perfume
                        to the breeze. Our street was usually quiet, however,—a footfall being
                        sufficient to draw the inhabitants to their front windows, and to oblige an
                        incautious trespasser to run the gauntlet of batteries of blue and black
                        eyes on either side of the way. A carriage passing through it communicated a
                        singular thrill to the floors, and caused the china on the dining-table to
                        rattle. Although we were comparatively free from the prevailing winds,
                        wandering gusts sometimes got bewildered and strayed unconsciously into our
                        street, and finding an unencumbered field, incontinently set up a shriek of
                        joy, and went gleefully to work on the clothes-lines and chimney-pots, and
                        had a good time generally until they were quite exhausted. I have a very
                        vivid picture in my memory of an organ-grinder who was at one time blown
                        into the end of our street, and actually blown through it in spite of
                        several ineffectual efforts to come to a stand before the different
                        dwellings, but who was finally whirled out of the other extremity, still
                        playing and vainly endeavoring to pursue his unhallowed calling. But these
                        were noteworthy exceptions to the calm and even tenor of our life.</p>
                     <p>There was contiguity but not much sociability in our neighborhood. From my
                        bedroom window I could plainly distinguish the peculiar kind of victuals
                        spread on my neighbor's dining-table; while, on the other hand, he obtained
                        an equally uninterrupted view of the mysteries of my toilet. Still, that
                        "low vice, curiosity," was regulated by certain laws, and a kind of rude
                        chivalry invested our observation. A pretty girl, whose bedroom window was
                        the cynosure of neighboring eyes, was once brought under the focus of an
                        opera-glass in the hands of one of our ingenuous youth; but this act met
                        such prompt and universal condemnation, as an unmanly advantage, from the
                        lips of married men and bachelors who did n't own opera-glasses, that it was
                        never repeated.</p>
                     <p>With this brief sketch I conclude my record of<pb n="258-259"
                           xml:id="VAC6646-00000131"/> the neighborhoods I have moved from. I have
                        moved from many others since then, but they have generally presented
                        features not dissimilar to the three I have endeavored to describe in these
                        pages. I offer them as types containing the salient peculiarities of all.
                        Let no inconsiderate reader rashly move on account of them. My experience
                        has not been cheaply bought. From the nettle Change I have tried to pluck
                        the flower Security. Draymen have grown rich at my expense. House-agents
                        have known me and were glad, and landlords have risen up to meet me from
                        afar. The force of habit impels me still to consult all the bills I see in
                        the streets, nor can the war telegrams divert my first attention from the
                        advertising columns of the daily papers. I repeat, let no man think I have
                        disclosed the weaknesses of the neighborhood, nor rashly open that closet
                        which contains the secret skeleton of his dwelling. My carpets have been
                        altered to fit all sized odd-shaped apartments from parallelopiped to
                        hexagons. Much of my furniture has been distributed among my former
                        dwellings. These limbs have stretched upon uncarpeted floors, or have been
                        let down suddenly from imperfectly established bed-steads. I have dined in
                        the parlor and slept in the back kitchen. Yet the result of these sacrifices
                        and trials may be briefly summed up in the statement that I am now on the
                        eve of removal from my PRESENT NEIGHBORHOOD.</p>

                  <head>MY SUBURBAN RESIDENCE.</head>
                  <p>I LIVE in the suburbs. My residence, to quote the pleasing fiction of the
                     advertisement, "is within fifteen minutes' walk of the City Hall." Why the City
                     Hall should be considered as an eligible terminus of anybody's walk, under any
                     circumstances, I have not been able to determine. Never having walked from my
                     residence to that place, I am unable to verify the assertion, though I may
                     state as a purely abstract and separate proposition, that it takes me the
                     better part of an hour to reach Montgomery Street.</p>
                  <p>My selection of locality was a compromise between my wife's desire to go into
                     the country, and my own predilections for civic habitation. Like most
                     compromises, it ended in retaining the objectionable features of both
                     propositions; I procured the inconveniences of the country without losing the
                     discomforts of the city. I increased my distance from the butcher and
                     green-grocer, without approximating to herds and kitchen-gardens. But I
                     anticipate.</p>
                  <p>Fresh air was to be the principal thing sought for. That there might be too
                     much of this did<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6646-00000132"/> not enter into my
                     calculations. The first day I entered my residence, it blew; the second day was
                     windy; the third, fresh, with a strong breeze stirring; on the fourth, it blew;
                     on the fifth, there was a gale, which has continued to the present writing.</p>
                  <p>That the air is fresh, the above statement sufficiently establishes. That it is
                     bracing, I argue from the fact that I find it impossible to open the shutters
                     on the windward side of the house. That it is healthy, I am also convinced,
                     believing that there is no other force in Nature that could so buffet and
                     ill-use a person without serious injury to him. Let me offer an instance. The
                     path to my door crosses a slight eminence. The unconscious visitor, a little
                     exhausted by the ascent and the general effects of the gentle gales which he
                     has faced in approaching my hospitable mansion, relaxes his efforts, smooths
                     his brow, and approaches with a fascinating smile. Rash and too confident man!
                     The wind delivers a succession of rapid blows, and he is thrown back. He
                     staggers up again, in the language of the P. R., "smiling and confident." The
                     wind now makes for a vulnerable point, and gets his hat in chancery. All
                     ceremony is now thrown away; the luckless wretch seizes his hat with both
                     hands, and charges madly at the front door. Inch by inch, the wind contests the
                     ground; another struggle, and he stands upon the veranda. On such occasions I
                     make it a point to open the door myself, with a calmness and serenity that
                     shall offer a marked contrast to his feverish and excited air, and shall throw
                     suspicion of inebriety upon him. If he be inclined to timidity and bashfulness,
                     during the best of the evening he is all too conscious of the disarrangement of
                     his hair and cravat. If he is less sensitive, the result is often more
                     distressing. A valued elderly friend once called upon me after undergoing a
                     twofold struggle with the wind and a large Newfoundland dog (which I keep for
                     reasons hereinafter stated), and not only his hat, but his wig, had suffered.
                     He spent the evening with me, totally unconscious of the fact that his hair
                     presented the singular spectacle of having been parted diagonally from the
                     right temple to the left ear. When ladies called, my wife preferred to receive
                     them. They were generally hysterical, and often in tears. I remember, one
                     Sunday, to have been startled by what appeared to be the balloon from Hayes
                     Valley drifting rapidly past my conservatory, closely followed by the
                     Newfoundland dog. I rushed to the front door, but was anticipated by my wife. A
                     strange lady appeared at lunch, but the phenomenon remained otherwise
                     unaccounted for. Egress from my residence is much more easy. My guests seldom
                     "stand upon the order of their going, but go at once"; the Newfoundland dog<pb
                        n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6646-00000133"/> playfully harassing their rear. I
                     was standing one day, with my hand on the open hall door, in serious
                     conversation with the minister of the parish, when the back door was cautiously
                     opened. The watchful breeze seized the opportunity, and charged through the
                     defenceless passage. The front door closed violently in the middle of a
                     sentence, precipitating the reverend gentleman into the garden. The
                     Newfoundland dog, with that sagacity for which his race is so distinguished, at
                     once concluded that a personal collision had taken place between myself and
                     visitor, and flew to my defence. The reverend gentleman never called again.</p>
                  <p>The Newfoundland dog above alluded to was part of a system of protection which
                     my suburban home once required. Robberies were frequent in the neighborhood,
                     and my only fowl fell a victim to the spoiler's art. One night I awoke, and
                     found a man in my room. With singular delicacy and respect for the feelings of
                     others, he had been careful not to awaken any of the sleepers, and retired upon
                     my rising, without waiting for any suggestion. Touched by his delicacy, I
                     forbore giving the alarm until after he had made good his retreat. I then
                     wanted to go after a policeman, but my wife remonstrated, as this would leave
                     the house exposed. Remembering the gentlemanly conduct of the burglar, I
                     suggested the plan of following him and requesting him to give the alarm as he
                     went in town. But this proposition was received with equal disfavor. The next
                     day I procured a dog and a revolver. The former went off, but the latter would
                     n't. I then got a new dog and chained him, and a duelling pistol, with a
                     hair-trigger. The result was so far satisfactory that neither could be
                     approached with safety, and for some time I left them out, indifferently,
                     during the night. But the chain one day gave way, and the dog, evidently having
                     no other attachment to the house, took the opportunity to leave. His place was
                     soon filled by the Newfoundland, whose fidelity and sagacity I have just
                     recorded.</p>
                  <p>Space is one of the desirable features of my suburban residence. I do not know
                     the number of acres the grounds contain except from the inordinate quantity of
                     hose required for irrigating. I perform daily, like some gentle shepherd, upon
                     a quarter-inch pipe without any visible result, and have had serious thoughts
                     of contracting with some disbanded fire company for their hose and equipments.
                     It is quite a walk to the wood-house. Every day some new feature of the grounds
                     is discovered. My youngest boy was one day missing for several hours. His
                     head—a peculiarly venerable and striking object—was at last discovered just
                     above the grass at some distance from the house. On examination he was found
                     comfortably seated in a disused drain, in company with a silver spoon and<pb
                        n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6646-00000134"/> a dead rat. On being removed from
                     this locality he howled dismally and refused to be comforted.</p>
                  <p>The view from my suburban residence is fine. Lone Mountain, with its white
                     obelisks, is a suggestive if not cheering termination of the vista in one
                     direction, while the old receiving vault of Yerba Buena Cemetery limits the
                     view in another. Most of the funerals which take place pass my house. My
                     children, with the charming imitativeness that belongs to youth, have caught
                     the spirit of these passing corteges, and reproduce in the backyard, with
                     creditable skill, the salient features of the lugubrious procession. A doll,
                     from whose features all traces of vitality and expression have been removed,
                     represents the deceased. Yet unfortunately I have been obliged to promise them
                     more active participation in this ceremony at some future time, and I fear that
                     they look anxiously forward with the glowing impatience of youth to the speedy
                     removal of some one of my circle of friends. I am told that the eldest, with
                     the unsophisticated frankness that belongs to his age, made a personal request
                     to that effect to one of my acquaintances. One singular result of the frequency
                     of these funerals is the development of a critical and fastidious taste in such
                     matters on the part of myself and family. If I may so express myself, without
                     irreverence, we seldom turn out for anything less than six carriages. Any
                     number over this is usually breathlessly announced by Bridget as, "Here's
                     another, mum,—and a good long one."</p>
                  <p>With these slight drawbacks my suburban residence is charming. To the serious
                     poet, and writer of elegiac verses, the aspect of Nature, viewed from my
                     veranda, is suggestive. I myself have experienced moments when the "sad
                     mechanic exercise" of verse would have been of infinite relief. The following
                     stanzas, by a young friend who has been stopping with me for the benefit of his
                     health, addressed to a duck that frequented a small pond in the vicinity of my
                     mansion, may be worthy of perusal. I think I have met the idea conveyed in the
                     first verse in some of Hood's prose, but as my friend assures me that Hood was
                     too conscientious to appropriate anything not his own, I conclude I am
                     mistaken.</p>

                  <head>ON A VULGAR LITTLE BOY.</head>
                  <p>THE subject of this article is at present leaning against a tree directly
                     opposite to my window. He wears his cap with the wrong side before, apparently
                     for no other object than that which seems the most obvious,—of showing more
                     than the average quantity of very dirty face. His clothes, which are worn with
                     a certain buttonless ease and freedom, display, in the different quality of
                     their fruit-stains, a pleasing indication of the progress of the seasons. The
                     nose of this vulgar little boy turns up at the end. I have noticed this in
                     several other vulgar little boys, although it is by no means improbable that
                     youthful vulgarity may be present without this facial peculiarity. Indeed, I am
                     inclined to the belief that it is rather the result of early inquisitiveness—of
                     furtive pressures against window-panes, and of looking over fences, or of the
                     habit of biting large apples hastily—than an indication of scorn or juvenile
                     superciliousness. The vulgar little boy is more remarkable for his obtrusive
                     familiarity. It is my experience of his predisposition to this quality which
                     has induced me to write this article.</p>
                  <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6646-00000136"/>
                  <p>My acquaintance with him began in a moment of weakness. I have an unfortunate
                     predilection to cultivate originality in people, even when accompanied by
                     objectionable character. But, as I lack the firmness and skilfulness which
                     usually accompany this taste in others, and enable them to drop acquaintances
                     when troublesome, I have surrounded myself with divers unprofitable friends,
                     among whom I count the vulgar little boy. The manner in which he first
                     attracted my attention was purely accidental. He was playing in the street, and
                     the driver of a passing vehicle cut at him, sportively, with his whip. The
                     vulgar little boy rose to his feet and hurled after his tormentor a single
                     sentence of invective. I refrain from repeating it, for I feel that I could not
                     do justice to it here. If I remember rightly, it conveyed, in a very few words,
                     a reflection on the legitimacy of the driver's birth; it hinted a suspicion of
                     his father's integrity, and impugned the fair fame of his mother; it suggested
                     incompetency in his present position, personal uncleanliness, and evinced a
                     sceptical doubt of his future salvation. As his youthful lips closed over the
                     last syllable, the eyes of the vulgar little boy met mine. Something in my look
                     emboldened him to wink. I did not repel the action nor the complicity it
                     implied. From that moment I fell into the power of the vulgar little boy, and
                     he has never left me since.</p>
                  <p>He haunts me in the streets and by-ways. He accosts me, when in the company of
                     friends, with repulsive freedom. He lingers about the gate of my dwelling to
                     waylay me as I issue forth to business. Distance he overcomes by main strength
                     of lungs, and he hails me from the next street. He met me at the theatre the
                     other evening, and demanded my check with the air of a young footpad. I
                     foolishly gave it to him, but re-entering some time after, and comfortably
                     seating myself in the parquet, I was electrified by hearing my name called from
                     the gallery with the addition of a playful adjective. It was the vulgar little
                     boy. During the performance he projected spirally-twisted playbills in my
                     direction, and indulged in a running commentary on the supernumeraries as they
                     entered.</p>
                  <p>To-day has evidently been a dull one with him. I observe he whistles the
                     popular airs of the period with less shrillness and intensity. Providence,
                     however, looks not unkindly on him, and delivers into his hands as it were two
                     nice little boys who have at this moment innocently strayed into our street.
                     They are pink and white children, and are dressed alike, and exhibit a certain
                     air of neatness and refinement which is alone sufficient to awaken the
                     antagonism of the vulgar little boy. A sigh of satisfaction breaks from his
                     breast. What does he do? Any other boy would content himself<pb n="270-271"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000137"/> with simply knocking the hats off their
                     respective heads, and so vent his superfluous vitality in a single act, besides
                     precipitating the flight of the enemy. But there are æsthetic considerations
                     not to be overlooked; insult is to be added to the injury inflicted, and in the
                     struggles of the victim some justification is to be sought for extreme
                     measures. The two nice little boys perceive their danger and draw closer to
                     each other. The vulgar little boy begins by irony. He affects to be overpowered
                     by the magnificence of their costume. He addresses me (across the street and
                     through the closed window), and requests information if there haply be a circus
                     in the vicinity. He makes affectionate inquiries after the health of their
                     parents. He expresses a fear of maternal anxiety in regard to their welfare. He
                     offers to conduct them home. One nice little boy feebly retorts; but alas! his
                     correct pronunciation, his grammatical exactitude, and his moderate epithets
                     only provoke a scream of derision from the vulgar little boy, who now rapidly
                     changes his tactics. Staggering under the weight of his vituperation, they fall
                     easy victims to what he would call his "dexter mawley." A wail of lamentation
                     goes up from our street. But as the subject of this article seems to require a
                     more vigorous handling than I had purposed to give it, I find it necessary to
                     abandon my present dignified position, seize my hat, open the front door, and
                     try a stronger method.</p>

                  <head>WAITING FOR THE SHIP.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A FORT POINT IDYL.</head>
                  <p>ABOUT an hour's ride from the Plaza there is a high bluff with the ocean
                     breaking uninterruptedly along its rocky beach. There are several cottages on
                     the sands, which look as if they had recently been cast up by a heavy sea. The
                     cultivated patch behind each tenement is fenced in by bamboos, broken spars,
                     and driftwood. With its few green cabbages and turnip-tops, each garden looks
                     something like an aquarium with the water turned off. In fact you would not be
                     surprised to meet a merman digging among the potatoes, or a mermaid milking a
                     sea cow hard by.</p>
                  <p>Near this place formerly arose a great semaphoric telegraph with its gaunt arms
                     tossed up against the horizon. It has been replaced by an observatory,
                     connected with an electric nerve to the heart of the great commercial city.
                     From this point the incoming ships are signalled, and again checked off at the
                     City Exchange. And while we are here looking for the expected steamer, let me
                     tell you a story.</p>
                  <p>Not long ago, a simple, hard-working mechanic<pb n="272-273"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000138"/> had amassed sufficient by diligent labor in the
                     mines to send home for his wife and two children. He arrived in San Francisco a
                     month before the time the ship was due, for he was a western man, and had made
                     the overland journey and knew little of ships or seas or gales. He procured
                     work in the city, but as the time approached he would go to the shipping office
                     regularly every day. The month passed, but the ship came not; then a month and
                     a week, two weeks, three weeks, two months, and then a year.</p>
                  <p>The rough, patient face, with soft lines overlying its hard features, which had
                     become a daily apparition at the shipping agent's, then disappeared. It turned
                     up one afternoon at the observatory as the setting sun relieved the operator
                     from his duties. There was something so childlike and simple in the few
                     questions asked by this stranger, touching his business, that the operator
                     spent some time to explain. When the mystery of signals and telegraphs was
                     unfolded, the stranger had one more question to ask. "How long might a vessel
                     be absent before they would give up expecting her?" The operator could n't
                     tell; it would depend on circumstances. Would it be a year? Yes, it might be a
                     year, and vessels had been given up for lost after two years and had come home.
                     The stranger put his rough hand on the operator's, and thanked him for his
                     "troubil," and went away.</p>
                  <p>Still the ship came not. Stately clippers swept into the Gate, and merchantmen
                     went by with colors flying, and the welcoming gun of the steamer often
                     reverberated among the hills. Then the patient face, with the old resigned
                     expression, but a brighter, wistful look in the eye, was regularly met on the
                     crowded decks of the steamer as she disembarked her living freight. He may have
                     had a dimly defined hope that the missing ones might yet come this way, as only
                     another road over that strange unknown expanse. But he talked with ship
                     captains and sailors, and even this last hope seemed to fail. When the careworn
                     face and bright eyes were presented again at the observatory, the operator,
                     busily engaged, could not spare time to answer foolish interrogatories, so he
                     went away. But as night fell, he was seen sitting on the rocks with his face
                     turned seaward, and was seated there all that night.</p>
                  <p>When he became hopelessly insane, for that was what the physicians said made
                     his eyes so bright and wistful, he was cared for by a fellow-craftsman who had
                     known his troubles. He was allowed to indulge his fancy of going out to watch
                     for the ship, in which she "and the children" were, at night when no one else
                     was watching. He had made up his mind that the ship would come in at night.
                     This, and the idea that he would relieve the operator, who would be tired with
                     watching all<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6646-00000139"/> day, seemed to please
                     him. So he went out and relieved the operator every night!</p>
                  <p>For two years the ships came and went. He was there to see the outward-bound
                     clipper, and greet her on her return. He was known only by a few who frequented
                     the place. When he was missed at last from his accustomed spot, a day or two
                     elapsed before any alarm was felt. One Sunday, a party of pleasure-seekers
                     clambering over the rocks were attracted by the barking of a dog that had run
                     on before them. When they came up they found a plainly dressed man lying there
                     dead. There were a few papers in his pocket,—chiefly slips cut from different
                     journals of old marine memoranda,—and his face was turned towards the distant
                     sea.</p>

                  <head>THE LEGEND OF MONTE DEL DIABLO.</head>
                  <p>THE cautious reader will detect a lack of authenticity in the following pages.
                     I am not a cautious reader myself, yet I confess with some concern to the
                     absence of much documentary evidence in support of the singular incident I am
                     about to relate. Disjointed memoranda, the proceedings of <foreign
                        xml:lang="SPA">ayuntamientos</foreign> and early departmental <foreign
                        xml:lang="SPA">juntas</foreign>, with other records of a primitive and
                     superstitious people, have been my inadequate authorities. It is but just to
                     state, however, that though this particular story lacks corroboration, in
                     ransacking the Spanish archives of Upper California I have met with many more
                     surprising and incredible stories, attested and supported to a degree that
                     would have placed this legend beyond a cavil or doubt. I have, also, never lost
                     faith in the legend myself, and in so doing have profited much from the
                     examples of divers grant-claimants, who have often jostled me in their more
                     practical researches, and who have my sincere sympathy at the scepticism of a
                     modern hard-headed and practical world.</p>
                  <p>For many years after Father Junipero Serro first<pb n="278-279"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000141"/> rang his bell in the wilderness of Upper
                     California, the spirit which animated that adventurous priest did not wane. The
                     conversion of the heathen went on rapidly in the establishment of Missions
                     throughout the land. So sedulously did the good Fathers set about their work,
                     that around their isolated chapels there presently arose <foreign
                        xml:lang="SPA">adobe</foreign> huts, whose mud-plastered and savage tenants
                     partook regularly of the provisions, and occasionally of the Sacrament, of
                     their pious hosts. Nay, so great was their progress, that one zealous Padre is
                     reported to have administered the Lord's Supper one Sabbath morning to "over
                     three hundred heathen Salvages." It was not to be wondered that the Enemy of
                     Souls, being greatly incensed thereat, and alarmed at his decreasing
                     popularity, should have grievously tempted and embarrassed these Holy Fathers,
                     as we shall presently see.</p>
                  <p>Yet they were happy, peaceful days for California. The vagrant keels of prying
                     Commerce had not as yet ruffled the lordly gravity of her bays. No torn and
                     ragged gulch betrayed the suspicion of golden treasure. The wild oats drooped
                     idly in the morning heat, or wrestled with the afternoon breezes. Deer and
                     antelope dotted the plain. The watercourses brawled in their familiar channels,
                     nor dreamed of ever shifting their regular tide. The wonders of the Yosemite
                     and Calaveras were as yet unrecorded. The Holy Fathers noted little of the
                     landscape beyond the barbaric prodigality with which the quick soil repaid the
                     sowing. A new conversion, the advent of a Saint's day, or the baptism of an
                     Indian baby, was at once the chronicle and marvel of their day.</p>
                  <p>At this blissful epoch there lived at the Mission of San Pablo Father José
                     Antonio Haro, a worthy brother of the Society of Jesus. He was of tall and
                     cadaverous aspect. A somewhat romantic history had given a poetic interest to
                     his lugubrious visage. While a youth, pursuing his studies at famous Salamanca,
                     he had become enamored of the charms of Doña Cármen de Torrencevara, as that
                     lady passed to her matutinal devotions. Untoward circumstances, hastened,
                     perhaps, by a wealthier suitor, brought this amour to a disastrous issue; and
                     Father José entered a monastery, taking upon himself the vows of celibacy. It
                     was here that his natural fervor and poetic enthusiasm conceived expression as
                     a missionary. A longing to convert the uncivilized heathen succeeded his
                     frivolous earthly passion, and a desire to explore and develop unknown
                     fastnesses continually possessed him. In his flashing eye and sombre exterior
                     was detected a singular commingling of the discreet Las Casas and the impetuous
                     Balboa.</p>
                  <p>Fired by this pious zeal, Father José went forward in the van of Christian
                     pioneers. On reaching Mexico, he obtained authority to establish the<pb
                        n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6646-00000142"/> Mission of San Pablo. Like the good
                     Junipero, accompanied only by an acolyte and muleteer, he unsaddled his mules
                     in a dusky <foreign xml:lang="SPA">cañon,</foreign> and rang his bell in the
                     wilderness. The savages—a peaceful, inoffensive, and inferior race—presently
                     flocked around him. The nearest military post was far away, which contributed
                     much to the security of these pious pilgrims, who found their open trustfulness
                     and amiability better fitted to repress hostility than the presence of an
                     armed, suspicious, and brawling soldiery. So the good Father José said matins
                     and prime, mass and vespers, in the heart of Sin and Heathenism, taking no heed
                     to himself, but looking only to the welfare of the Holy Church. Conversions
                     soon followed, and, on the 7th of July, 1760, the first Indian baby was
                     baptized,—an event which, as Father José piously records, "exceeds the
                     richnesse of gold or precious jewels or the chancing upon the Ophir of
                     Solomon." I quote this incident as best suited to show the ingenious blending
                     of poetry and piety which distinguished Father José's record.</p>
                  <p>The Mission of San Pablo progressed and prospered until the pious founder
                     thereof, like the infidel Alexander, might have wept that there were no more
                     heathen worlds to conquer. But his ardent and enthusiastic spirit could not
                     long brook an idleness that seemed begotten of sin; and one pleasant August
                     morning, in the year of grace 1770, Father José issued from the outer court of
                     the Mission building, equipped to explore the field for new missionary
                     labors.</p>
                  <p>Nothing could exceed the quiet gravity and unpretentiousness of the little
                     cavalcade. First rode a stout muleteer, leading a pack-mule laden with the
                     provisions of the party, together with a few cheap crucifixes and hawks' bells.
                     After him came the devout Padre José, bearing his breviary and cross, with a
                     black <foreign xml:lang="SPA">serapa</foreign> thrown around his shoulders;
                     while on either side trotted a dusky convert, anxious to show a proper sense of
                     their regeneration by acting as guides into the wilds of their heathen
                     brethren. Their new condition was agreeably shown by the absence of the usual
                     mud-plaster, which in their unconverted state they assumed to keep away vermin
                     and cold. The morning was bright and propitious. Before their departure, mass
                     had been said in the chapel, and the protection of St. Ignatius invoked against
                     all contingent evils, but especially against bears, which, like the fiery
                     dragons of old, seemed to cherish unconquerable hostility to the Holy
                     Church.</p>
                  <p>As they wound through the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">cañon,</foreign> charming
                     birds disported upon boughs and sprays, and sober quails piped from the alders;
                     the willowy watercourses gave a musical utterance, and the long grass whispered
                     on the hillside. On entering the deeper defiles, above them towered dark
                        green<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6646-00000143"/> masses of pine, and
                     occasionally the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">madroño</foreign> shook its bright
                     scarlet berries. As they toiled up many a steep ascent, Father José sometimes
                     picked up fragments of scoria, which spake to his imagination of direful
                     volcanoes and impending earthquakes. To the less scientific mind of the
                     muleteer Ignacio they had even a more terrifying significance; and he once or
                     twice snuffed the air suspiciously, and declared that it smelt of sulphur. So
                     the first day of their journey wore away, and at night they encamped without
                     having met a single heathen face.</p>
                  <p>It was on this night that the Enemy of Souls appeared to Ignacio in an
                     appalling form. He had retired to a secluded part of the camp and had sunk upon
                     his knees in prayerful meditation, when he looked up and perceived the
                     Arch-Fiend in the likeness of a monstrous bear. The Evil One was seated on his
                     hind legs immediately before him, with his fore paws joined together just below
                     his black muzzle. Wisely conceiving this remarkable attitude to be in mockery
                     and derision of his devotions, the worthy muleteer was transported with fury.
                     Seizing an arquebuse, he instantly closed his eyes and fired. When he had
                     recovered from the effects of the terrific discharge, the apparition had
                     disappeared. Father José awakened by the report, reached the spot only in time
                     to chide the muleteer for wasting powder and ball in a contest with one whom a
                     single <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ave</foreign> would have been sufficient to
                     utterly discomfit. What further reliance he placed on Ignacio's story is not
                     known; but, in commemoration of a worthy Californian custom, the place was
                     called <foreign xml:lang="SPA">La Cañada de la Tentacion del Pio
                        Muletero,</foreign> or "The Glen of the Temptation of the Pious Muleteer," a
                     name which it retains to this day.</p>
                  <p>The next morning the party, issuing from a narrow gorge, came upon a long
                     valley, sear and burnt with the shadeless heat. Its lower extremity was lost in
                     a fading line of low hills, which, gathering might and volume toward the upper
                     end of the valley, upheaved a stupendous bulwark against the breezy North. The
                     peak of this awful spur was just touched by a fleecy cloud that shifted to and
                     fro like a banneret. Father José gazed at it with mingled awe and admiration.
                     By a singular coincidence, the muleteer Ignacio uttered the simple ejaculation
                        "<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Diablo!</foreign>"</p>
                  <p>As they penetrated the valley, they soon began to miss the agreeable life and
                     companionable echoes of the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">cañon</foreign> they had
                     quitted. Huge fissures in the parched soil seemed to gape as with thirsty
                     mouths. A few squirrels darted from the earth, and disappeared as mysteriously
                     before the jingling mules. A gray wolf trotted leisurely along just ahead. But
                     whichever way Father José turned, the mountain always asserted itself and<pb
                        n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6646-00000144"/> arrested his wandering eye. Out of
                     the dry and arid valley, it seemed to spring into cooler and bracing life. Deep
                     cavernous shadows dwelt along its base; rocky fastnesses appeared midway of its
                     elevation; and on either side huge black hills diverged like massy roots from a
                     central trunk. His lively fancy pictured these hills peopled with a majestic
                     and intelligent race of savages; and looking into futurity, he already saw a
                     monstrous cross crowning the dome-like summit. Far different were the
                     sensations of the muleteer, who saw in those awful solitudes only fiery
                     dragons, colossal bears and break-neck trails. The converts, Concepcion and
                     Incarnacion, trotting modestly beside the Padre, recognized, perhaps, some
                     manifestation of their former weird mythology.</p>
                  <p>At nightfall they reached the base of the mountain. Here Father José unpacked
                     his mules, said vespers, and, formally ringing his bell, called upon the
                     Gentiles within hearing to come and accept the Holy Faith. The echoes of the
                     black frowning hills around him caught up the pious invitation, and repeated it
                     at intervals; but no Gentiles appeared that night. Nor were the devotions of
                     the muleteer again disturbed, although he afterward asserted, that, when the
                     Father's exhortation was ended, a mocking peal of laughter came from the
                     mountain. Nothing daunted by these intimations of the near hostility of the
                     Evil One, Father José declared his intention to ascend the mountain at early
                     dawn; and before the sun rose the next morning he was leading the way.</p>
                  <p>The ascent was in many places difficult and dangerous. Huge fragments of rock
                     often lay across the trail, and after a few hours' climbing they were forced to
                     leave their mules in a little gully, and continue the ascent afoot.
                     Unaccustomed to such exertion, Father José often stopped to wipe the
                     perspiration from his thin cheeks. As the day wore on, a strange silence
                     oppressed them. Except the occasional pattering of a squirrel, or a rustling in
                     the <hi rend="i"/>chimisal bushes, there were no signs of life. The half-human
                     print of a bear's foot sometimes appeared before them, at which Ignacio always
                     crossed himself piously. The eye was sometimes cheated by a dripping from the
                     rocks, which on closer inspection proved to be a resinous oily liquid with an
                     abominable sulphurous smell. When they were within a short distance of the
                     summit, the discreet Ignacio, selecting a sheltered nook for the camp, slipped
                     aside and busied himself in preparations for the evening, leaving the Holy
                     Father to continue the ascent alone. Never was there a more thoughtless act of
                     prudence, never a more imprudent piece of caution. Without noticing the
                     desertion, buried in pious reflection, Father José pushed mechanically on, and,
                     reaching the summit, cast himself down and gazed upon the prospect.</p>
                  <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6646-00000145"/>
                  <p>Below him lay a succession of valleys opening into each other like gentle
                     lakes, until they were lost to the southward. Westerly the distant range hid
                     the bosky <foreign xml:lang="SPA">cañada</foreign> which sheltered the mission
                     of San Pablo. In the farther distance the Pacific Ocean stretched away, bearing
                     a cloud of fog upon its bosom, which crept through the entrance of the bay, and
                     rolled thickly between him and the northeastward; the same fog hid the base of
                     mountain and the view beyond. Still, from time to time the fleecy veil parted,
                     and timidly disclosed charming glimpses of mighty rivers, mountain defiles, and
                     rolling plains, sear with ripened oats, and bathed in the glow of the setting
                     sun. As Father José gazed, he was penetrated with a pious longing. Already his
                     imagination, filled with enthusiastic conceptions, beheld all that vast expanse
                     gathered under the mild sway of the Holy Faith, and peopled with zealous
                     converts. Each little knoll in fancy became crowned with a chapel; from each
                     dark <foreign xml:lang="SPA">cañon</foreign> gleamed the white walls of a
                     mission building. Growing bolder in his enthusiasm, and looking farther into
                     futurity, he beheld a new Spain rising on these savage shores. He already saw
                     the spires of stately cathedrals, the domes of palaces, vineyards, gardens, and
                     groves. Convents, half hid among the hills, peeping from plantations of
                     branching limes; and long processions of chanting nuns wound through the
                     defiles. So completely pletely was the good Father's conception of the future
                     confounded with the past, that even in their choral strain the well-remembered
                     accents of Cármen struck his ear. He was busied in these fanciful imaginings,
                     when suddenly over that extended prospect the faint, distant tolling of a bell
                     rang sadly out and died. It was the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Angelus</foreign>.
                     Father José listened with superstitious exaltation. The mission of San Pablo
                     was far away, and the sound must have been some miraculous omen. But never
                     before, to his enthusiastic sense, did the sweet seriousness of this angelic
                     symbol come with such strange significance. With the last faint peal, his
                     glowing fancy seemed to cool; the fog closed in below him, and the good Father
                     remembered he had not had his supper. He had risen and was wrapping his
                        <foreign xml:lang="SPA">serapa</foreign> around him, when he perceived for
                     the first time that he was not alone.</p>
                  <p>Nearly opposite, and where should have been the faithless Ignacio, a grave and
                     decorous figure was seated. His appearance was that of an elderly <foreign
                        xml:lang="SPA">hidalgo</foreign>, dressed in mourning, with mustaches of
                     iron-gray carefully waxed and twisted around a pair of lantern-jaws. The
                     monstrous hat and prodigious feather, the enormous ruff and exaggerated
                     trunk-hose, contrasted with a frame shrivelled and wizened, all belonged to a
                     century previous. Yet Father José was not astonished. His adventurous life and
                     poetic imagination, continually on the<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6646-00000146"
                     /> lookout for the marvellous, gave him a certain advantage over the practical
                     and material minded. He instantly detected the diabolical quality of his
                     visitant, and was prepared. With equal coolness and courtesy he met the
                     cavalier's obeisance.</p>
                  <p>"I ask your pardon, Sir Priest," said the stranger, "for disturbing your
                     meditations. Pleasant they must have been, and right fanciful, I imagine, when
                     occasioned by so fair a prospect."</p>
                  <p>"Worldly, perhaps, Sir Devil,—for such I take you to be," said the Holy Father,
                     as the stranger bowed his black plumes to the ground; "worldly, perhaps; for it
                     hath pleased Heaven to retain even in our regenerated state much that
                     pertaineth to the flesh, yet still, I trust, not without some speculation for
                     the welfare of the Holy Church. In dwelling upon yon fair expanse, mine eyes
                     have been graciously opened with prophetic inspiration, and the promise of the
                     heathen as an inheritance hath marvellously recurred to me. For there can be
                     none lack such diligence in the True Faith, but may see that even the
                     conversion of these pitiful salvages hath a meaning. As the blessed St.
                     Ignatius discreetly observes," continued Father José, clearing his throat and
                     slightly elevating his voice, "'the heathen is given to the warriors of Christ,
                     even as the pearls of rare discovery which gladden the hearts of shipmen.' Nay,
                     I might say—"</p>
                  <p>But here the stranger, who had been wrinkling his brows and twisting his
                     mustaches with well-bred patience, took advantage of an oratorical pause:—</p>
                  <p>"It grieves me, Sir Priest, to interrupt the current of your eloquence as
                     discourteously as I have already broken your meditations; but the day already
                     waneth to night. I have a matter of serious import to make with you, could I
                     entreat your cautious consideration a few moments."</p>
                  <p>Father José hesitated. The temptation was great, and the prospect of acquiring
                     some knowledge of the Great Enemy's plans not the least trifling object. And if
                     the truth must be told, there was a certain decorum about the stranger that
                     interested the Padre. Though well aware of the Protean shapes the Arch-Fiend
                     could assume, and though free from the weaknesses of the flesh, Father José was
                     not above the temptations of the spirit. Had the Devil appeared, as in the case
                     of the pious St: Anthony, in the likeness of a comely damsel, the good Father,
                     with his certain experience of the deceitful sex, would have whisked her away
                     in the saying of a paternoster. But there was, added to the security of age, a
                     grave sadness about the stranger,—a thoughtful consciousness as of being at a
                     great moral disadvantage,—which at once decided him on a magnanimous course of
                     conduct.</p>
                  <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6646-00000147"/>
                  <p>The stranger then proceeded to inform him, that he had been diligently
                     observing the Holy Father's triumphs in the valley. That, far from being
                     greatly exercised thereat, he had been only grieved to see so enthusiastic and
                     chivalrous an antagonist wasting his zeal in a hopeless work. For, he observed,
                     the issue of the great battle of Good and Evil had been otherwise settled, as
                     he would presently show him. "It wants but a few moments of night," he
                     continued, "and over this interval of twilight, as you know, I have been given
                     complete control. Look to the West."</p>
                  <p>As the Padre turned, the stranger took his enormous hat from his head, and
                     waved it three times before him. At each sweep of the prodigious feather, the
                     fog grew thinner, until it melted impalpably away, and the former landscape
                     returned, yet warm with the glowing sun. As Father José gazed, a strain of
                     martial music arose from the valley, and issuing from a deep <foreign
                        xml:lang="SPA">cañon</foreign>, the good Father beheld a long cavalcade of
                     gallant cavaliers, habited like his companion. As they swept down the plain,
                     they were joined by like processions, that slowly defiled from every ravine and
                        <foreign xml:lang="SPA">cañon</foreign> of the mysterious mountain. From
                     time to time the peal of a trumpet swelled fitfully upon the breeze; the cross
                     of Santiago glittered, and the royal banners of Castile and Aragon waved over
                     the moving column. So they moved on solemnly toward the sea, where, in the
                     distance, Father José saw stately caravels, bearing the same familiar banner,
                     awaiting them. The good Padre gazed with conflicting emotions, and the serious
                     voice of the stranger broke the silence.</p>
                  <p>"Thou hast beheld, Sir Priest, the fading foot-prints of adventurous Castile.
                     Thou hast seen the declining glory of old Spain,—declining as yonder brilliant
                     sun. The sceptre she hath wrested from the heathen is fast dropping from her
                     decrepit and fleshless grasp. The children she hath fostered shall know her no
                     longer. The soil she hath acquired shall be lost to her as irrevocably as she
                     herself hath thrust the Moor from her own Granada."</p>
                  <p>The stranger paused, and his voice seemed broken by emotion; at the same time,
                     Father José whose sympathizing heart yearned toward the departing banners,
                     cried in poignant accents,—</p>
                  <p>"Farewell, ye gallant cavaliers and Christian soldiers! Farewell, thou, Nuñes
                     de Balboa! thou, Alonzo de Ojeda! and thou, most venerable Las Casas! Farewell,
                     and may Heaven prosper still the seed ye left behind!"</p>
                  <p>Then turning to the stranger, Father José beheld him gravely draw his
                     pocket-handkerchief from the basket-hilt of his rapier, and apply it decorously
                     to his eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Pardon this weakness, Sir Priest," said the<pb n="292-293"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000148"/> cavalier, apologetically; "but these worthy
                     gentlemen were ancient friends of mine, and have done me many a delicate
                     service,—much more, perchance, than these poor sables may signify," he added,
                     with a grim gesture toward the mourning suit he wore.</p>
                  <p>Father José was too much preoccupied in reflection to notice the equivocal
                     nature of this tribute, and, after a few moments' silence, said, as if
                     continuing his thought,—</p>
                  <p>"But the seed they have planted shall thrive and prosper on this fruitful
                     soil."</p>
                  <p>As if answering the interrogatory, the stranger turned to the opposite
                     direction, and, again waving his hat, said, in the same serious tone,—</p>
                  <p>"Look to the East!"</p>
                  <p>The Father turned, and, as the fog broke away before the waving plume, he saw
                     that the sun was rising. Issuing with its bright beams through the passes of
                     the snowy mountains beyond, appeared a strange and motley crew. Instead of the
                     dark and romantic visages of his last phantom train, the Father beheld with
                     strange concern the blue eyes and flaxen hair of a Saxon race. In place of
                     martial airs and musical utterance, there rose upon the ear a strange din of
                     harsh gutturals and singular sibilation. Instead of the decorous tread and
                     stately mien of the cavaliers of the former vision, they came pushing,
                     bustling, panting, and swaggering. And as they passed, the good Father noticed
                     that giant trees were prostrated as with the breath of a tornado, and the
                     bowels of the earth were torn and rent as with a convulsion. And Father José
                     looked in vain for holy cross or Christian symbol; there was but one that
                     seemed an ensign, and he crossed himself with holy horror as he perceived it
                     bore the effigy of a bear.</p>
                  <p>"Who are these swaggering Ishmaelites?" he asked, with something of asperity in
                     his tone.</p>
                  <p>The stranger was gravely silent.</p>
                  <p>"What do they here, with neither cross nor holy symbol?" he again demanded.</p>
                  <p>"Have you the courage to see, Sir Priest?" responded the stranger, quietly.</p>
                  <p>Father José felt his crucifix, as a lonely traveller might his rapier, and
                     assented.</p>
                  <p>"Step under the shadow of my plume," said the stranger.</p>
                  <p>Father José stepped beside him, and they instantly sank through the earth.</p>
                  <p>When he opened his eyes, which had remained closed in prayerful meditation
                     during his rapid descent, he found himself in a vast vault, bespangled overhead
                     with luminous points like the starred firmament. It was also lighted by a
                     yellow glow that seemed to proceed from a mighty sea or lake that occupied the
                     centre of the chamber. Around this subterranean sea dusky figures flitted,
                        bearing<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6646-00000149"/> ladles filled with the
                     yellow fluid, which they had replenished from its depths. From this lake
                     diverging streams of the same mysterious flood penetrated like mighty rivers
                     the cavernous distance. As they walked by the banks of this glittering Styx,
                     Father José perceived how the liquid stream at certain places became solid. The
                     ground was strewn with glittering flakes. One of these the Padre picked up and
                     curiously examined. It was virgin gold.</p>
                  <p>An expression of discomfiture overcast the good Father's face at this
                     discovery; but there was trace neither of malice nor satisfaction in the
                     stranger's air, which was still of serious and fateful contemplation. When
                     Father José recovered his equanimity, he said, bitterly,—</p>
                  <p>"This, then, Sir Devil, is your work! This is your deceitful lure for the weak
                     souls of sinful nations! So would you replace the Christian grace of holy
                     Spain!"</p>
                  <p>"This is what must be," returned the stranger, gloomily. "But listen, Sir
                     Priest. It lies with you to avert the issue for a time. Leave me here in peace.
                     Go back to Castile, and take with you your bells, your images, and your
                     missions. Continue here, and you only precipitate results. Stay! promise me you
                     will do this, and you shall not lack that which will render your old age an
                     ornament and a blessing"; and the stranger motioned significantly to the
                     lake.</p>
                  <p>It was here, the legend discreetly relates, that the Devil showed—as he always
                     shows sooner or later—his cloven hoof. The worthy Padre, sorely perplexed by
                     his threefold vision, and, if the truth must be told, a little nettled at this
                     wresting away of the glory of holy Spanish discovery, had shown some
                     hesitation. But the unlucky bribe of the Enemy of Souls touched his Castilian
                     spirit. Starting back in deep disgust, he brandished his crucifix in the face
                     of the unmasked Fiend, and in a voice that made the dusky vault resound,
                     cried,—</p>
                  <p>"Avaunt thee, Sathanas! Diabolus, I defy thee! What! wouldst thou bribe me,—me,
                     a brother of the Sacred Society of the Holy Jesus, Licentiate of Cordova and
                     Inquisitor of Guadalaxara? Thinkest thou to buy me with thy sordid treasure?
                     Avaunt!"</p>
                  <p>What might have been the issue of this rupture, and how complete might have
                     been the triumph of the Holy Father over the Arch-Fiend, who was recoiling
                     aghast at these sacred titles and the flourishing symbol, we can never know,
                     for at that moment the crucifix slipped through his fingers.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely had it touched the ground before Devil and Holy Father simultaneously
                     cast themselves toward it. In the struggle they clinched, and the pious José,
                     who was as much the superior of his antagonist in bodily as in spiritual
                     strength, was<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6646-00000150"/> about to treat the
                     Great Adversary to a back somersault, when he suddenly felt the long nails of
                     the stranger piercing his flesh. A new fear seized his heart, a numbing
                     chillness crept through his body, and he struggled to free himself, but in
                     vain. A strange roaring was in his ears; the lake and cavern danced before his
                     eyes and vanished; and with a loud cry he sank senseless to the ground.</p>
                  <p>When he recovered his consciousness he was aware of a gentle swaying motion of
                     his body. He opened his eyes, and saw it was high noon, and that he was being
                     carried in a litter through the valley. He felt stiff, and, looking down,
                     perceived that his arm was tightly bandaged to his side.</p>
                  <p>He closed his eyes and after a few words of thankful prayer, thought how
                     miraculously he had been preserved, and made a vow of candlesticks to the
                     blessed Saint José. He then called in a faint voice, and presently the penitent
                     Ignacio stood beside him.</p>
                  <p>The joy the poor fellow felt at his patron's returning consciousness for some
                     time choked his utterance. He could only ejaculate, "A miracle! Blessed Saint
                     José, he lives!" and kiss the Padre's bandaged hand. Father José, more intent
                     on his last night's experience, waited for his emotion to subside, and asked
                     where he had been found.</p>
                  <p>"On the mountain, your Reverence, but a few <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                        >varas</foreign> from where he attacked you."</p>
                  <p>"How?—you saw him then?" asked the Padre, in unfeigned astonishment.</p>
                  <p>"Saw him, your Reverence! Mother of God, I should think I did! And your
                     Reverence shall see him too, if he ever comes again within range of Ignacio's
                     arquebuse."</p>
                  <p>"What mean you, Ignacio?" said the Padre, sitting bolt-upright in his
                     litter.</p>
                  <p>"Why, the bear, your Reverence,—the bear, Holy Father, who attacked your
                     worshipful person while you were meditating on the top of yonder mountain."</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" said the Holy Father, lying down again. "Chut, child! I would be at
                     peace."</p>
                  <p>When he reached the Mission, he was tenderly cared for, and in a few weeks was
                     enabled to resume those duties from which, as will be seen, not even the
                     machinations of the Evil One could divert him. The news of his physical
                     disaster spread over the country; and a letter to the Bishop of Guadalaxara
                     contained a confidential and detailed account of the good Father's spiritual
                     temptation. But in some way the story leaked out; and long after José was
                     gathered to his fathers, his mysterious encounter formed the theme of thrilling
                     and whispered narrative. The mountain was generally shunned. It is true that
                     Señor Joaquin Pedrillo afterward located a grant near the base of the mountain;
                     but as Señora Pedrillo was known to be<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6646-00000151"
                     /> a termagant half-breed, the Señor was not supposed to be
                     over-fastidious.</p>
                  <p>Such is the Legend of Monte del Diablo. As I said before, it may seem to lack
                     essential corroboration. The discrepancy between the Father's narrative and the
                     actual climax has given rise to some scepticism on the part of ingenious
                     quibblers. All such I would simply refer to that part of the report of Señor
                     Julio Serro, Sub-Prefect of San Pablo, before whom attest of the above was
                     made. Touching this matter, the worthy Prefect observes, "That although the
                     body of Father José doth show evidence of grievous conflict in the flesh, yet
                     that is no proof that the Enemy of Souls, who could assume the figure of a
                     decorous elderly <foreign xml:lang="SPA">caballero</foreign>, could not at the
                     same time transform himself into a bear for his own vile purposes."</p>

                  <head>THE ADVENTURE OF PADRE VICENTIO.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A LEGEND OF SAN FRANCISCO.</head>
                  <p>ONE pleasant New Year's Eve, about forty years ago, Padre Vicentio was slowly
                     picking his way across the sand-hills from the Mission Dolores. As he climbed
                     the crest of the ridge beside Mission Creek, his broad, shining face might have
                     been easily mistaken for the beneficent image of the rising moon, so bland was
                     its smile and so indefinite its features. For the Padre was a man of notable
                     reputation and character; his ministration at the mission of San José had been
                     marked with cordiality and unction; he was adored by the simple-minded savages,
                     and had succeeded in impressing his individuality so strongly upon them that
                     the very children were said to have miraculously resembled him in feature.</p>
                  <p>As the holy man reached the loneliest portion of the road, he naturally put
                     spurs to his mule as if to quicken that decorous pace which the obedient animal
                     had acquired through long experience of its master's habits. The locality had
                     an unfavorable reputation. Sailors—deserters from whaleships—had been seen
                     lurking about the<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6646-00000152"/> outskirts of the
                     town, and low scrub oaks which everywhere beset the trail might have easily
                     concealed some desperate runaway. Besides these material obstructions, the
                     devil, whose hostility to the church was well known, was said to sometimes
                     haunt the vicinity in the likeness of a spectral whaler, who had met his death
                     in a drunken bout, from a harpoon in the hands of a companion. The ghost of
                     this unfortunate mariner was frequently observed sitting on the hill toward the
                     dusk of evening, armed with his favorite weapon and a tub containing a coil of
                     line, looking out for some belated traveller on whom to exercise his
                     professional skill. It is related that the good Father José Maria of the
                     Mission Dolores had been twice attacked by this phantom sportsman; that once,
                     on returning from San Francisco, and panting with exertion from climbing the
                     hill, he was startled by a stentorian cry of "There she blows!" quickly
                     followed by a hurtling harpoon, which buried itself in the sand beside him;
                     that on another occasion he narrowly escaped destruction, his serapa having
                     been transfixed by the diabolical harpoon and dragged away in triumph. Popular
                     opinion seems to have been divided as to the reason for the devil's particular
                     attention to Father José, some asserting that the extreme piety of the Padre
                     excited the Evil One's animosity, and others that his adipose tendency simply
                     rendered him, from a professional view-point, a profitable capture.</p>
                  <p>Had Father Vicentio been inclined to scoff at this apparition as a heretical
                     innovation, there was still the story of Concepcion, the Demon Vaquero, whose
                     terrible <foreign xml:lang="SPA">riata</foreign> was fully as potent as the
                     whaler's harpoon. Concepcion, when in the flesh, had been a celebrated herder
                     of cattle and wild horses, and was reported to have chased the devil in the
                     shape of a fleet <foreign xml:lang="SPA">pinto</foreign> colt all the way from
                     San Luis Obispo to San Francisco, vowing not to give up the chase until he had
                     overtaken the disguised Arch-Enemy. This the devil prevented by resuming his
                     own shape, but kept the unfortunate vaquero to the fulfilment of his rash vow;
                     and Concepcion still scoured the coast on a phantom steed, beguiling the
                     monotony of his eternal pursuit by lassoing travellers, dragging them at the
                     heels of his unbroken mustang until they were eventually picked up,
                     half-strangled, by the road-side. The Padre listened attentively for the tramp
                     of this terrible rider. But no footfall broke the stillness of the night; even
                     the hoofs of his own mule sank noiselessly in the shifting sand. Now and then a
                     rabbit bounded lightly by him, or a quail ran into the bushes. The melancholy
                     call of plover from the adjoining marshes of Mission Creek came to him so
                     faintly and fitfully that it seemed almost a recollection of the past rather
                     than a reality of the present.</p>
                  <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6646-00000153"/>
                  <p>To add to his discomposure one of those heavy sea-fogs peculiar to the locality
                     began to drift across the hills and presently encompassed him. While
                     endeavoring to evade its cold embraces, Padre Vicentio incautiously drove his
                     heavy spurs into the flanks of his mule as that puzzled animal was hesitating
                     on the brink of a steep declivity. Whether the poor beast was indignant at this
                     novel outrage, or had been for some time reflecting on the evils of being
                     priest-ridden, has not transpired; enough that he suddenly threw up his heels,
                     pitching the reverend man over his head, and, having accomplished this feat,
                     coolly dropped on his knees and tumbled after his rider.</p>
                  <p>Over and over went the Padre, closely followed by his faithless mule. Luckily
                     the little hollow which received the pair was of sand that yielded to the
                     superincumbent weight, half burying them without further injury. For some
                     moments the poor man lay motionless, vainly endeavoring to collect his
                     scattered senses. A hand irreverently laid upon his collar, and a rough shake,
                     assisted to recall his consciousness. As the Padre staggered to his feet he
                     found himself confronted by a stranger.</p>
                  <p>Seen dimly through the fog, and under circumstances that to say the least were
                     not prepossessing, the new-comer had an inexpressibly mysterious and
                     brigand-like aspect. A long boat-cloak concealed cealed his figure, and a
                     slouched hat hid his features, permitting only his eyes to glisten in the
                     depths. With a deep groan the Padre slipped from the stranger's grasp and
                     subsided into the soft sand again.</p>
                  <p>"Gad's life!" said the stranger, pettishly, "hast no more bones in thy fat
                     carcass than a jellyfish? Lend a hand, here! Yo, heave ho!" and he dragged the
                     Padre into an upright position. "Now, then, who and what art thou?"</p>
                  <p>The Padre could not help thinking that the question might have more properly
                     been asked by himself; but with an odd mixture of dignity and trepidation he
                     began enumerating his different titles, which were by no means brief, and would
                     have been alone sufficient to strike awe in the bosom of an ordinary adversary.
                     The stranger irreverently broke in upon his formal phrases, and assuring him
                     that a priest was the very person he was looking for, coolly replaced the old
                     man's hat, which had tumbled off, and bade him accompany him at once on an
                     errand of spiritual counsel to one who was even then lying in extremity. "To
                     think," said the stranger, "that I should stumble upon the very man I was
                     seeking! Body of Bacchus! but this is lucky! Follow me quickly, for there is no
                     time to lose."</p>
                  <p>Like most easy natures the positive assertion of the stranger, and withal a
                     certain authoritative air<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6646-00000154"/> of
                     command, overcame what slight objections the Padre might have feebly nurtured
                     during this remarkable interview. The spiritual invitation was one, also, that
                     he dared not refuse; not only that; but it tended somewhat to remove the
                     superstitious dread with which he had begun to regard the mysterious stranger.
                     But, following at a respectful distance, the Padre could not help observing
                     with a thrill of horror that the stranger's footsteps made no impression on the
                     sand, and his figure seemed at times to blend and incorporate itself with the
                     fog, until the holy man was obliged to wait for its reappearance. In one of
                     these intervals of embarrassment he heard the ringing of the far-off Mission
                     bell, proclaiming the hour of midnight. Scarcely had the last stroke died away
                     before the announcement was taken up and repeated by a multitude of bells of
                     all sizes, and the air was filled with the sound of striking clocks and the
                     pealing of steeple chimes. The old man uttered a cry of alarm. The stranger
                     sharply demanded the cause. "The bells! did you not hear them?" gasped Padre
                     Vicentio. "Tush! tush!" answered the stranger, "thy fall hath set triple
                     bob-majors ringing in thine ears. Come on!"</p>
                  <p>The Padre was only too glad to accept the explanation conveyed in this
                     discourteous answer. But he was destined for another singular experience. When
                     they had reached the summit of the eminence now known as Russian Hill, an
                     exclamation again burst from the Padre. The stranger turned to his companion
                     with an impatient gesture; but the Padre heeded him not. The view that burst
                     upon his sight was such as might well have engrossed the attention of a more
                     enthusiastic temperament. The fog had not yet reached the hill, and the long
                     valleys and hillsides of the embarcadero below were glittering with the light
                     of a populous city. "Look!" said the Padre, stretching his hand over the
                     spreading landscape. "Look, dost thou not see the stately squares and
                     brilliantly lighted avenues of a mighty metropolis. Dost thou not see, as it
                     were, another firmament below?"</p>
                  <p>"Avast heaving, reverend man, and quit this folly," said the stranger, dragging
                     the bewildered Padre after him. "Behold rather the stars knocked out of thy
                     hollow noddle by the fall thou hast had. Prithee, get over thy visions and
                     rhapsodies, for the time is wearing apace."</p>
                  <p>The Padre humbly followed without another word. Descending the hill toward the
                     north, the stranger leading the way, in a few moments the Padre detected the
                     wash of waves, and presently his feet struck the firmer sand of the beach. Here
                     the stranger paused, and the Padre perceived a boat lying in readiness hard by.
                     As he stepped into the stern sheets, in obedience to the command<pb n="306-307"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000155"/> of his companion, he noticed that the rowers
                     seemed to partake of the misty incorporeal texture of his companion, a
                     similarity that became the more distressing when he perceived also that their
                     oars in pulling together made no noise. The stranger, assuming the helm, guided
                     the boat on quietly, while the fog, settling over the face of the water and
                     closing around them, seemed to interpose a muffled wall between themselves and
                     the rude jarring of the outer world. As they pushed further into this
                     penetralia, the Padre listened anxiously for the sound of creaking blocks and
                     the rattling of cordage, but no vibration broke the veiled stillness or
                     disturbed the warm breath of the fleecy fog. Only one incident occurred to
                     break the monotony of their mysterious journey. A one-eyed rower, who sat in
                     front of the Padre, catching the devout father's eye, immediately grinned such
                     a ghastly smile, and winked his remaining eye with such diabolical intensity of
                     meaning that the Padre was constrained to utter a pious ejaculation, which had
                     the disastrous effect of causing the marine Cocles to "catch a crab," throwing
                     his heels in the air and his head into the bottom of the boat. But even this
                     accident did not disturb the gravity of the rest of the ghastly boat's
                     crew.</p>
                  <p>When, as it seemed to the Padre, ten minutes had elapsed, the outline of a
                     large ship loomed up directly across their bow. Before he could utter the cry
                     of warning that rose to his lips, or brace himself against the expected shock,
                     the boat passed gently and noiselessly through the sides of the vessel, and the
                     holy man found himself standing on the berth deck of what seemed to be an
                     ancient caravel. The boat and boat's crew had vanished. Only his mysterious
                     friend, the stranger, remained. By the light of a swinging lamp the Padre
                     beheld him standing beside a hammock, whereon, apparently, lay the dying man to
                     whom he had been so mysteriously summoned. As the Padre, in obedience to a sign
                     from his companion, stepped to the side of the sufferer, he feebly opened his
                     eyes and thus addressed him:—</p>
                  <p>"Thou seest before thee, reverend father, a helpless mortal, struggling not
                     only with the last agonies of the flesh, but beaten down and tossed with sore
                     anguish of the spirit. It matters little when or how I became what thou now
                     seest me. Enough that my life has been ungodly and sinful, and that my only
                     hope of absolution lies in my imparting to thee a secret which is of vast
                     importance to the holy Church, and affects greatly her power, wealth, and
                     dominion on these shores. But the terms of this secret and the conditions of my
                     absolution are peculiar. I have but five minutes to live. In that time I must
                     receive the extreme unction of the Church."</p>
                  <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6646-00000156"/>
                  <p>"And thy secret?" said the holy father.</p>
                  <p>"Shall be told afterwards," answered the dying man. "Come, my time is short.
                     Shrive me quickly."</p>
                  <p>The Padre hesitated. "Couldst thou not tell this secret first?"</p>
                  <p>"Impossible!" said the dying man, with what seemed to the Padre a momentary
                     gleam of triumph. Then, as his breath grew feebler, he called impatiently,
                     "Shrive me! shrive me!"</p>
                  <p>"Let me know at least what this secret concerns?" suggested the Padre,
                     insinuatingly.</p>
                  <p>"Shrive me first," said the dying man.</p>
                  <p>But the priest still hesitated, parleying with the sufferer until the ship's
                     bell struck, when, with a triumphant, mocking laugh from the stranger, the
                     vessel suddenly fell to pieces, amid the rushing of waters which at once
                     involved the dying man, the priest, and the mysterious stranger.</p>
                  <p>The Padre did not recover his consciousness until high noon the next day, when
                     he found himself lying in a little hollow between the Mission Hills, and his
                     faithful mule a few paces from him, cropping the sparse herbage. The Padre made
                     the best of his way home, but wisely abstained from narrating the facts
                     mentioned above, until after the discovery of gold, when the whole of this
                     veracious incident was related, with the assertion of the padre that the secret
                     which was thus mysteriously teriously snatched from his possession was nothing
                     more than the discovery of gold, years since, by the runaway sailors from the
                     expedition of Sir Francis Drake.</p>

                  <head>THE LEGEND OF DEVIL'S POINT.</head>
                  <p>ON the northerly shore of San Francisco Bay, at a point where the Golden Gate
                     broadens into the Pacific stands a bluff promontory. It affords shelter from
                     the prevailing winds to a semicircular bay on the east. Around this bay the
                     hillside is bleak and barren, but there are traces of former habitation in a
                     weather-beaten cabin and deserted corral. It is said that these were originally
                     built by an enterprising squatter, who for some unaccountable reason abandoned
                     them shortly after. The "Jumper" who succeeded him disappeared one day, quite
                     as mysteriously. The third tenant, who seemed to be a man of sanguine, hopeful
                     temperament, divided the property into building lots, staked off the hillside,
                     and projected the map of a new metropolis. Failing, however, to convince the
                     citizens of San Francisco that they had mistaken the site of their city, he
                     presently fell into dissipation and despondency. He was frequently observed
                     haunting the narrow strip of beach at low tide, or perched upon the cliff at
                     high water. In the latter position a sheep-tender one day found him, cold and
                     pulseless, with a map of his property in his hand, and his face turned toward
                     the distant sea.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps these circumstances gave the locality its infelicitous reputation.
                     Vague rumors were bruited of a supernatural influence that had been exercised
                     on the tenants. Strange stories were circulated of the origin of the diabolical
                     title by which the promontory was known. By some it was believed to be haunted
                     by the spirit of one of Sir Francis Drake's sailors who had deserted his ship
                     in consequence of stories told by the Indians of gold discoveries, but who had
                     perished by starvation on the rocks. A <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                        >vaquero</foreign> who had once passed a night in the ruined cabin, related
                     how a strangely dressed and emaciated figure had knocked at the door at
                     midnight and demanded food. Other story-tellers, of more historical accuracy,
                     roundly asserted that Sir Francis himself had been little better than a pirate,
                     and had chosen this spot to conceal quantities of ill-gotten booty, taken from
                     neutral bottoms, and had protected his hiding-place by the orthodox means of
                     hellish incantation and diabolic agencies. On moonlight nights a shadowy ship
                     was sometimes seen standing off-and-on, or when fogs encompassed sea and shore
                     the noise of oars rising and falling in their row-locks could be heard muffled
                     and indistinctly during the night. Whatever foundation there might have been
                     for these stories, it was certain that a more<pb n="312-313"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000158"/> weird and desolate-looking spot could not have
                     been selected for their theatre. High hills, verdureless and enfiladed with
                     dark cañadas, cast their gaunt shadows on the tide. During a greater portion of
                     the day the wind, which blew furiously and incessantly, seemed possessed with a
                     spirit of fierce disquiet and unrest. Toward nightfall the sea-fog crept with
                     soft step through the portals of the Golden Gate, or stole in noiseless marches
                     down the hillside, tenderly soothing the wind-buffeted face of the cliff, until
                     sea and sky were hid together. At such times the populous city beyond and the
                     nearer settlement seemed removed to an infinite distance. An immeasurable
                     loneliness settled upon the cliff. The creaking of a windlass, or the
                     monotonous chant of sailors on some unseen, outlying ship, came faint and far,
                     and full of mystic suggestion.</p>
                  <p>About a year ago a well-to-do middle-aged broker of San Francisco found himself
                     at nightfall the sole occupant of a "plunger," encompassed in a dense fog, and
                     drifting toward the Golden Gate. This unexpected termination of an afternoon's
                     sail was partly attributable to his want of nautical skill, and partly to the
                     effect of his usually sanguine nature. Having given up the guidance of his boat
                     to the wind and tide, he had trusted too implicitly for that reaction which his
                     business experience assured him was certain to occur in all affairs, aquatic as
                     well as terrestrial. "The tide will turn soon," said the broker, confidently,
                     "or something will happen." He had scarcely settled himself back again in the
                     stern-sheets, before the bow of the plunger, obeying some mysterious impulse,
                     veered slowly around and a dark object loomed up before him. A gentle eddy
                     carried the boat further in shore, until at last it was completely embayed
                     under the lee of a rocky point now faintly discernible through the fog. He
                     looked around him in the vain hope of recognizing some familiar headland. The
                     tops of the high hills which rose on either side were hidden in the fog. As the
                     boat swung around, he succeeded in fastening a line to the rocks, and sat down
                     again with a feeling of renewed confidence and security.</p>
                  <p>It was very cold. The insidious fog penetrated his tightly buttoned coat, and
                     set his teeth to chattering in spite of the aid he sometimes drew from a
                     pocket-flask. His clothes were wet and the stern-sheets were covered with
                     spray. The comforts of fire and shelter continually rose before his fancy as he
                     gazed wistfully on the rocks. In sheer despair he finally drew the boat toward
                     the most accessible part of the cliff and essayed to ascend. This was less
                     difficult than it appeared, and in a few moments he had gained the hill above.
                     A dark object at a little distance attracted his attention, and on approaching
                     it proved to be a deserted<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6646-00000159"/> cabin.
                     The story goes on to say, that having built a roaring fire of stakes pulled
                     from the adjoining corral, with the aid of a flask of excellent brandy, he
                     managed to pass the early part of the evening with comparative comfort.</p>
                  <p>There was no door in the cabin, and the windows were simply square openings,
                     which freely admitted the searching fog. But in spite of these
                     discomforts,—being a man of cheerful, sanguine temperament,—he amused himself
                     by poking the fire, and watching the ruddy glow which the flames threw on the
                     fog from the open door. In this innocent occupation a great weariness overcame
                     him, and he fell asleep.</p>
                  <p>He was awakened at midnight by a loud "halloo," which seemed to proceed
                     directly from the sea. Thinking it might be the cry of some boatman lost in the
                     fog, he walked to the edge of the cliff, but the thick veil that covered sea
                     and land rendered all objects at the distance of a few feet indistinguishable.
                     He heard, however, the regular strokes of oars rising and falling on the water.
                     The halloo was repeated. He was clearing his throat to reply, when to his
                     surprise an answer came apparently from the very cabin he had quitted. Hastily
                     retracing his steps, he was the more amazed, on reaching the open door, to find
                     a stranger warming himself by the fire. Stepping back far enough to conceal his
                     own person, he took a good look at the intruder.</p>
                  <p>He was a man of about forty, with a cadaverous face. But the oddity of his
                     dress attracted the broker's attention more than his lugubrious physiognomy.
                     His legs were hid in enormously wide trousers descending to his knee, where
                     they met long boots of sealskin. A pea-jacket with exaggerated cuffs, almost as
                     large as the breeches, covered his chest, and around his waist a monstrous
                     belt, with a buckle like a dentist's sign, supported two trumpet-mouthed
                     pistols and a curved hanger. He wore a long queue, which depended half-way down
                     his back. As the firelight fell on his ingenuous countenance the broker
                     observed with some concern that this queue was formed entirely of a kind of
                     tobacco, known as pigtail or twist. Its effect, the broker remarked, was much
                     heightened when in a moment of thoughtful abstraction the apparition bit off a
                     portion of it, and rolled it as a quid into the cavernous recesses of his
                     jaws.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, the nearer splash of oars indicated the approach of the unseen boat.
                     The broker had barely time to conceal himself behind the cabin before a number
                     of uncouth-looking figures clambered up the hill toward the ruined rendezvous.
                     They were dressed like the previous comer, who, as they passed through the open
                     door, exchanged greetings with each in antique phraseology, bestowing at the
                     same time some familiar nickname. Flash-in-the-Pan, Spitter-of-Frogs, Malmsey
                        Butt,<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6646-00000160"/> Latheyard-Will, and
                     Mark-the-Pinker, were the few <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sobriquets</foreign> the
                     broker remembered. Whether these titles were given to express some peculiarity
                     of their owner he could not tell, for a silence followed as they slowly ranged
                     themselves upon the floor of the cabin in a semicircle around their cadaverous
                     host.</p>
                  <p>At length Malmsey Butt, a spherical-bodied man-of-war's-man, with a rubicund
                     nose, got on his legs somewhat unsteadily, and addressed himself to the
                     company. They had met that evening, said the speaker, in accordance with a
                     time-honored custom. This was simply to relieve that one of their number who
                     for fifty years had kept watch and ward over the locality where certain
                     treasures had been buried. At this point the broker pricked up his ears. "If so
                     be, camarados and brothers all," he continued, "ye are ready to receive the
                     report of our excellent and well-beloved brother, Master Slit-the-Weazand,
                     touching his search for this treasure, why, marry, to 't and begin."</p>
                  <p>A murmur of assent went around the circle as the speaker resumed his seat.
                     Master Slit-the-Weazand slowly opened his lantern jaws, and began. He had spent
                     much of his time in determining the exact location of the <choice>
                        <sic>teasure</sic>
                        <corr>treasure</corr>
                     </choice>. He believed—nay, he could state positively—that its position was now
                     settled. It was true he had done some trifling little business outside. Modesty
                     ty forbade his mentioning the particulars, but he would simply state that of
                     the three tenants who had occupied the cabin during the past ten years, none
                     were now alive. [Applause, and cries of "Go to! thou wast always a tall
                     fellow!" and the like.]</p>
                  <p>Mark-the-Pinker next arose. Before proceeding to business he had a duty to
                     perform in the sacred name of Friendship. It ill became him to pass an eulogy
                     upon the qualities of the speaker who had preceded him, for he had known him
                     from "boy-hood's hour." Side by side they had wrought together in the Spanish
                     war. For a neat hand with a toledo he challenged his equal, while how nobly and
                     beautifully he had won his present title of Slit-the-Weazand, all could
                     testify. The speaker, with some show of emotion, asked to be pardoned if he
                     dwelt too freely on passages of their early companionship; he then detailed,
                     with a fine touch of humor, his comrade's peculiar manner of slitting the ears
                     and lips of a refractory Jew, who had been captured in one of their previous
                     voyages. He would not weary the patience of his hearers, but would briefly
                     propose that the report of Slit-the-Weazand be accepted, and that the thanks of
                     the company be tendered him.</p>
                  <p>A beaker of strong spirits was then rolled into the hut, and cans of grog were
                     circulated freely from hand to hand. The health of Slit-the-Weazand<pb
                        n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6646-00000161"/> and was proposed in a neat speech by
                     Mark-the-Pinker, and responded to by the former gentleman in a manner that drew
                     tears to the eyes of all present. To the broker, in his concealment, this
                     momentary diversion from the real business of the meeting occasioned much
                     anxiety. As yet nothing had been said to indicate the exact locality of the
                     treasure to which they had mysteriously alluded. Fear restrained him from open
                     inquiry, and curiosity kept him from making good his escape during the orgies
                     which followed.</p>
                  <p>But his situation was beginning to become critical. Flash-in-the-Pan, who
                     seemed to have been a man of choleric humor, taking fire during some hotly
                     contested argument, discharged both his pistols at the breast of his opponent.
                     The balls passed through on each side immediately below his arm-pits, making a
                     clean hole, through which the horrified broker could see the firelight behind
                     him. The wounded man, without betraying any concern, excited the laughter of
                     the company, by jocosely putting his arms akimbo, and inserting his thumbs into
                     the orifices of the wounds, as if they had been arm-holes. This having in a
                     measure restored good-humor, the party joined hands and formed a circle
                     preparatory to dancing. The dance was commenced by some monotonous stanzas
                     hummed in a very high key by one of the party, the rest joining in the
                     following chorus, which seemed to present a familiar sound to the broker's ear.<q>

                  <p>At the regular recurrence of the last line, the party discharged their loaded

                  <p>When the tumult had partially subsided, Flash-in-the-Pan called the meeting to
                     order, and most of the revellers returned to their places, Malmsey Butt,
                     however, insisting upon another chorus, and singing at the top of his voice:— <q>

                  <p>Flash-in-the-Pan drew a pistol from his belt, and bidding some one gag Malmsey
                     Butt with the stock of it, proceeded to read from a portentous roll of
                     parchment that he held in his hand. It was a semi-legal document, clothed in
                     the quaint phraseology of a bygone period. After a long preamble, asserting
                     their loyalty as lieges of Her most bountiful Majesty and Sovereign Lady the
                     Queen, the document declared that they then and there took possession of the
                     promontory, and all the treasure trove therein contained, formerly buried by
                     Her Majesty's most faithful and devoted<pb n="320-321"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000162"/> Admiral Sir Francis Drake, with the right to
                     search, discover, and appropriate the same; and for the purpose thereof they
                     did then and there form a guild or corporation to so discover, search for, and
                     disclose said treasures, and by virtue thereof they solemnly subscribed their
                     names. But at this moment the reading of the parchment was arrested by an
                     exclamation from the assembly, and the broker was seen frantically struggling
                     at the door in the strong arms of Mark-the-Pinker.</p>
                  <p>"Let me go!" he cried, as he made a desperate attempt to reach the side of
                     Master Flash-in-the Pan. "Let me go! I tell you, gentlemen, that document is
                     not worth the parchment it is written on. The laws of the State, the customs of
                     the country, the mining ordinances, are all against it. Don't, by all that's
                     sacred, throw away such a capital investment through ignorance and informality.
                     Let me go! I assure you, gentlemen, professionally, that you have a big
                     thing,—a remarkably big thing, and even if I ain't in it, I'm not going to see
                     it fall through. Don't, for God's sake, gentlemen, I implore you, put your
                     names to such a ridiculous paper. There is n't a notary—"</p>
                  <p>He ceased. The figures around him, which were beginning to grow fainter and
                     more indistinct, as he went on, swam before his eyes, flickered, reappeared
                     again, and finally went out. He rubbed his eyes and gazed around him. The cabin
                     was deserted. On the hearth the red embers of his fire were fading away in the
                     bright beams of the morning sun, that looked aslant through the open window. He
                     ran out to the cliff. The sturdy sea-breeze fanned his feverish cheeks, and
                     tossed the white caps of waves that beat in pleasant music on the beach below.
                     A stately merchantman with snowy canvas was entering the Gate. The voices of
                     sailors came cheerfully from a bark at anchor below the point. The muskets of
                     the sentries gleamed brightly on Alcatraz, and the rolling of drums swelled on
                     the breeze. Farther on, the hills of San Francisco, cottage-crowned and
                     bordered with wharves and warehouses, met his longing eye.</p>
                  <p>Such is the Legend of Devil's Point. Any objections to its reliability may be
                     met with the statement, that the broker who tells the story has since
                     incorporated a company under the title of "Flash-in-the-Pan Gold and Silver
                     Treasure Mining Company," and that its shares are already held at a stiff
                     figure. A copy of the original document is said to be on record in the office
                     of the company, and on any clear day the locality of the claim may be
                     distinctly seen from the hills of San Francisco.</p>

                  <head>THE DEVIL AND THE BROKER.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND.</head>
                  <p>THE church clocks in San Francisco were striking ten. The Devil, who had been
                     flying over the city that evening, just then alighted on the roof of a church
                     near the corner of Bush and Montgomery Streets. It will be perceived that the
                     popular belief that the Devil avoids holy edifices, and vanishes at the sound
                     of a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Credo</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                        >Pater-noster</foreign>, is long since exploded. Indeed, modern scepticism
                     asserts that he is not averse to these orthodox discourses, which particularly
                     bear reference to himself, and in a measure recognize his power and
                     importance.</p>
                  <p>I am inclined to think, however, that his choice of a resting-place was a good
                     deal influenced by its contiguity to a populous thoroughfare. When he was
                     comfortably seated, he began pulling out the joints of a small rod which he
                     held in his hand, and which presently proved to be an extraordinary
                     fishing-pole, with a telescopic adjustment that permitted its protraction to a
                     marvellous extent. Affixing a line thereto, he selected a fly of a particular
                     pattern from a small box which he carried with him, and, making a skilful cast,
                     threw his line into the very centre of that living stream which ebbed and
                     flowed through Montgomery Street.</p>
                  <p>Either the people were very virtuous that evening or the bait was not a taking
                     one. In vain the Devil whipped the stream at an eddy in front of the
                     Occidental, or trolled his line into the shadows of the Cosmopolitan; five
                     minutes passed without even a nibble. "Dear me!" quoth the Devil, "that's very
                     singular; one of my most popular flies, too! Why, they'd have risen by shoals
                     in Broadway or Beacon Street for that. Well, here goes another." And, fitting a
                     new fly from his well-filled box, he gracefully recast his line.</p>
                  <p>For a few moments there was every prospect of sport. The line was continually
                     bobbing and the nibbles were distinct and gratifying. Once or twice the bait
                     was apparently gorged and carried off in the upper stories of the hotels to be
                     digested at leisure. At such times the professional manner in which the Devil
                     played out his line would have thrilled the heart of Izaak Walton. But his
                     efforts were unsuccessful; the bait was invariably carried off without hooking
                     the victim, and the Devil finally lost his temper. "I've heard of these
                     San-Franciscans before," he muttered; "wait till I get hold of one,—that's
                     all!" he added malevolently, as he rebaited his hook. A sharp tug and a wriggle
                     foiled his next trial, and<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6646-00000164"/> finally,
                     with considerable effort, he landed a portly two-hundred-pound broker upon the
                     church roof.</p>
                  <p>As the victim lay there gasping, it was evident that the Devil was in no hurry
                     to remove the hook from his gills; nor did he exhibit in this delicate
                     operation that courtesy of manner and graceful manipulation which usually
                     distinguished him.</p>
                  <p>"Come," he said, gruffly, as he grasped the broker by the waistband, "quit that
                     whining and grunting. Don't flatter yourself that you 're a prize either. I was
                     certain to have had you. It was only a question of time."</p>
                  <p>"It is not that, my lord, which troubles me," whined the unfortunate wretch, as
                     he painfully wriggled his head, "but that I should have been fooled by such a
                     paltry bait. What will they say of me down there? To have let bigger things' go
                     by, and to be taken in by this cheap trick," he added, as he groaned and
                     glanced at the fly which the Devil was carefully rearranging, "is what,—pardon
                     me, my lord,—is what gets me!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said the Devil, philosophically, "I never caught anybody yet who did n't
                     say that; but tell me, ain't you getting somewhat fastidious down there? Here
                     is one of my most popular flies, the greenback," he continued, exhibiting an
                     emerald-looking insect, which he drew from his box. "This, so generally
                     considered excellent in election season, has not even been nibbled at. Perhaps
                     your sagacity, which, in spite of this unfortunate <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >contretemps</foreign>, no one can doubt," added the Devil, with a graceful
                     return to his usual courtesy, "may explain the reason or suggest a
                     substitute."</p>
                  <p>The broker glanced at the contents of the box with a supercilious smile. "Too
                     old-fashioned, my lord,—long ago played out. Yet," he added, with a gleam of
                     interest, "for a consideration I might offer something—ahem!—that would make a
                     taking substitute for these trifles. Give me," he continued, in a brisk,
                     business-like way, "a slight percentage and a bonus down, and I 'm your
                     man."</p>
                  <p>"Name your terms," said the Devil, earnestly.</p>
                  <p>"My liberty and a percentage on all you take, and the thing's done."</p>
                  <p>The Devil caressed his tail thoughtfully, for a few moments. He was certain of
                     the broker any way, and the risk was slight. "Done!" he said.</p>
                  <p>"Stay a moment," said the artful broker. "There are certain contingencies. Give
                     me your fishing-rod and let me apply the bait myself. It requires a skilful
                     hand, my lord; even your well-known experience might fail. Leave me alone for
                     half an hour, and if you have reason to complain of my success I will forfeit
                     my deposit,—I mean my liberty."</p>
                  <p>The Devil acceded to his request, bowed, and withdrew. Alighting gracefully in
                     Montgomery Street, he dropped into Meade &amp; Co.'s clothing<pb n="326-327"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000165"/> store, where, having completely equipped himself
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">à la mode</foreign>, he sallied forth intent on his
                     personal enjoyment. Determining to sink his professional character, he mingled
                     with the current of human life, and enjoyed, with that immense capacity for
                     excitement peculiar to his nature, the whirl, bustle, and feverishness of the
                     people, as a purely æsthetic gratification unalloyed by the cares of business.
                     What he did that evening does not belong to our story. We return to the broker,
                     whom we left on the roof.</p>
                  <p>When he made sure that the Devil had retired, he carefully drew from his
                     pocket-book a slip of paper and affixed it on the hook. The line had scarcely
                     reached the current before he felt a bite. The hook was swallowed. To bring up
                     his victim rapidly, disengage him from the hook, and reset his line, was the
                     work of a moment. Another bite and the same result. Another, and another. In a
                     very few minutes the roof was covered with his panting spoil. The broker could
                     himself distinguish that many of them were personal friends; nay, some of them
                     were familiar frequenters of the building on which they were now miserably
                     stranded. That the broker felt a certain satisfaction in being instrumental in
                     thus misleading his fellow-brokers no one acquainted with human nature will for
                     a moment doubt. But a stronger pull on his line caused him to put forth all his
                     strength and skill. The magic pole bent like a coach-whip. The broker held
                     firm, assisted by the battlements of the church. Again and again it was almost
                     wrested from his hand, and again and again he slowly reeled in a portion of the
                     tightening line. At last, with one mighty effort, he lifted to the level of the
                     roof a struggling object. A howl like Pandemonium rang through the air as the
                     broker successfully landed at his feet—the Devil himself!</p>
                  <p>The two glared fiercely at each other. The broker, perhaps mindful of his
                     former treatment, evinced no haste to remove the hook from his antagonist's
                     jaw. When it was finally accomplished, he asked quietly if the Devil was
                     satisfied. That gentleman seemed absorbed in the contemplation of the bait
                     which he had just taken from his mouth. "I am," he said, finally, "and forgive
                     you; but what do you call this?"</p>
                  <p>"Bend low," replied the broker, as he buttoned up his coat ready to depart. The
                     Devil inclined his ear. "I call it WILD CAT!"</p>

                  <head>THE OGRESS OF SILVER LAND;</head>
                  <head type="sub">OR, THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF PRINCE BADFELLAH AND PRINCE
                     BULLEBOYE.</head>
                  <p>IN the second year of the reign of the renowned Caliph Lo there dwelt in SILVER
                     LAND, adjoining his territory, a certain terrible ogress. She lived in the
                     bowels of a dismal mountain, where she was in the habit of confining such
                     unfortunate travellers as ventured within her domain. The country for miles
                     around was sterile and barren. In some places it was covered with a white
                     powder, which was called in the language of the country AL KA LI, and was
                     supposed to be the pulverized bones of those who had perished miserably in her
                     service.</p>
                  <p>In spite of this, every year, great numbers of young men devoted themselves to
                     the service of the ogress, hoping to become her godsons, and to enjoy the good
                     fortune which belonged to that privileged class. For these godsons had no work
                     to perform, neither at the mountain nor elsewhere, but roamed about the world
                     with credentials of their relationship in their pockets, which they called
                     STOKH, which was stamped with the stamp and sealed with the seal of the ogress,
                     and which enabled them at the end of each moon to draw large quantities of gold
                     and silver from her treasury. And the wisest and most favored of those godsons
                     were the Princes BADFELLAH and BULLEBOYE. They knew all the secrets of the
                     ogress, and how to wheedle and coax her. They were also the favorites of SOOPAH
                     INTENDENT, who was her Lord High Chamberlain and Prime Minister, and who dwelt
                     in SILVER LAND.</p>
                  <p>One day, SOOPAH INTENDENT said to his servants, "What is that which travels the
                     most surely, the most secretly, and the most swiftly?"</p>
                  <p>And they all answered as one man, "LIGHTNING, my lord, travels the most surely,
                     the most swiftly, and the most secretly!"</p>
                  <p>Then said SOOPAH INTENDENT, "Let Lightning carry this message secretly,
                     swiftly, and surely to my beloved friends the Princes BADFELLAH and BULLEBOYE,
                     and tell them that their godmother is dying, and bid them seek some other
                     godmother or sell their STOKH ere it becomes <hi rend="i"
                     />badjee,—worthless."</p>
                  <p>"Bekhesm! On our heads be it!" answered the servants; and they ran to Lightning
                     with the message, who flew with it to the City by the Sea, and delivered it,
                     even at that moment, into the hands of the Princes BADFELLAH and BULLEBOYE.</p>
                  <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6646-00000167"/>
                  <p>Now the Prince BADFELLAH was a wicked young man; and when he had received this
                     message he tore his beard and rent his garment and reviled his godmother, and
                     his friend SOOPAH INTENDENT. But presently he arose, and dressed himself in his
                     finest stuffs, and went forth into the bazaars and among the merchants,
                     capering and dancing as he walked, and crying in a loud voice, "O, happy day!
                     O, day worthy to be marked with a white stone!"</p>
                  <p>This he said cunningly, thinking the merchants and men of the bazaars would
                     gather about him, which they presently did, and began to question him: "What
                     news, O most worthy and serene Highness? Tell us, that we make merry too!"</p>
                  <p>Then replied the cunning prince, "Good news, O my brothers, for I have heard
                     this day that my godmother in SILVER LAND is well." The merchants, who were not
                     aware of the substance of the real message, envied him greatly, and said one to
                     another: "Surely our brother the Prince BADFELLAH is favored by Allah above all
                     men"; and they were about to retire, when the prince checked them, saying:
                     "Tarry for a moment. Here are my credentials, or STOKH. The same I will sell
                     you for fifty thousand sequins, for I have to give a feast to-day, and need
                     much gold. Who will give fifty thousand?" And he again fell to capering and
                     dancing. But this time the merchants drew a little apart, and some of the
                     oldest and wisest said: "What dirt is this which the prince would have us
                     swallow? If his godmother were well, why should he sell his STOKH? Bismillah!
                     The olives are old and the jar is broken!" When Prince BADFELLAH perceived them
                     whispering, his countenance fell, and his knees smote against each other
                     through fear; but, dissembling again, he said: "Well, so be it! Lo, I have much
                     more than shall abide with me, for my days are many and my wants are few. Say
                     forty thousand sequins for my STOKH and let me depart in Allah's name. Who will
                     give forty thousand sequins to become the godson of such a healthy mother?" And
                     he again fell to capering and dancing, but not as gayly as before, for his
                     heart was troubled. The merchants, however, only moved farther away. "Thirty
                     thousand sequins," cried Prince BADFELLAH; but even as he spoke they fled
                     before his face, crying: "His godmother is dead. Lo, the jackals are defiling
                     her grave. Mashalla! he has no godmother." And they sought out PANIK, the
                     swift-footed messenger, and bade him shout through the bazaars that the
                     godmother of Prince BADFELLAH was dead. When he heard this, the prince fell
                     upon his face, and rent his garments, and covered himself with the dust of the
                     market-place. As he was sitting thus, a porter passed him with jars of wine on
                     his shoulders, and the prince begged him to give him a jar,<pb n="332-333"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000168"/> for he was exceeding thirsty and faint. But the
                     porter said, "What will my lord give me first?" And the prince, in very
                     bitterness of spirit, said, "Take this," and handed him his STOKH, and so
                     exchanged it for a jar of wine.</p>
                  <p>Now the Prince BULLEBOYE was of a very different disposition. When he received
                     the message of SOOPAH INTENDENT he bowed his head, and said, "It is the will of
                     God." Then he rose, and without speaking a word entered the gates of his
                     palace. But his wife, the peerless MAREE JAHANN, perceiving the gravity of his
                     countenance, said, "Why is my lord cast down and silent? Why are those rare and
                     priceless pearls, his words, shut up so tightly between those gorgeous
                     oyster-shells, his lips?" But to this he made no reply. Thinking further to
                     divert him, she brought her lute into the chamber and stood before him, and
                     sang the song and danced the dance of BEN KOTTON, which is called IBRAHIM'S
                     DAUGHTER, but she could not lift the veil of sadness from his brow.</p>
                  <p>When she had ceased, the Prince BULLEBOYE arose and said, "Allah is great, and
                     what am I, his servant, but the dust of the earth! Lo, this day has my
                     godmother sickened unto death, and my STOKH become as a withered palm-leaf.
                     Call hither my servants and camel-drivers, and the merchants that have
                     furnished me with stuffs, and the beggars who have feasted at my table, and bid
                     them take all that is here, for it is mine no longer!" With these words he
                     buried his face in his mantle and wept aloud.</p>
                  <p>But MAREE JAHANN, his wife, plucked him by the sleeve. "Prithee, my lord," said
                     she, "bethink thee of the BROKAH or scrivener, who besought thee but yesterday
                     to share thy STOKH with him and gave thee his bond for fifty thousand sequins."
                     But the noble Prince BULLEBOYE, raising his head, said: "Shall I sell to him
                     for fifty thousand sequins that which I know is not worth a SOO MARKEE? For is
                     not all the BROKAH'S wealth, even his wife and children, pledged on that bond?
                     Shall I ruin him to save myself? Allah forbid! Rather let me eat the salt fish
                     of honest penury, than the kibobs of dishonorable affluence; rather let me
                     wallow in the mire of virtuous oblivion, than repose on the divan of luxurious
                     wickedness."</p>
                  <p>When the prince had given utterance to this beautiful and edifying sentiment, a
                     strain of gentle music was heard, and the rear wall of the apartment, which had
                     been ingeniously constructed like a flat, opened and discovered the Ogress of
                     SILVER LAND in the glare of blue fire, seated on a triumphal car attached to
                     two ropes which were connected with the flies, in the very act of blessing the
                     unconscious prince. When the walls closed again without attracting his
                     attention, Prince BULLEBOYE<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6646-00000169"/> arose,
                     dressed himself in his coarsest and cheapest stuffs, and sprinkled ashes on his
                     head, and in this guise, having embraced his wife, went forth into the bazaars.
                     In this it will be perceived how differently the good Prince BULLEBOYE acted
                     from the wicked Prince BADFELLAH, who put on his gayest garments to simulate
                     and deceive.</p>
                  <p>Now when Prince BULLEBOYE entered the chief bazaar, where the merchants of the
                     city were gathered in council, he stood up in his accustomed place, and all
                     that were there held their breath, for the noble Prince BULLEBOYE was much
                     respected. "Let the BROKAH, whose bond I hold for fifty thousand sequins, stand
                     forth!" said the prince. And the BROKAH stood forth from among the merchants.
                     Then said the prince: "Here is thy bond for fifty thousand sequins, for which I
                     was to deliver unto thee one half of my STOKH. Know, then, O my brother,—and
                     thou, too, O Aga of the BROKAHS,—that this my STOKH which I pledged to thee is
                     worthless. For my godmother, the Ogress of SILVER LAND, is dying. Thus do I
                     release thee from thy bond, and from the poverty which might overtake thee as
                     it has even me, thy brother, the Prince BULLEBOYE." And with that the noble
                     Prince BULLEBOYE tore the bond of the BROKAH into pieces and scattered it to
                     the four winds.</p>
                  <p>Now when the prince tore up the bond there was a great commotion, and some
                     said, "Surely the Prince BULLEBOYE is drunken with wine"; and others, "He is
                     possessed of an evil spirit"; and his friends expostulated with him, saying,
                     "What thou hast done is not the custom of the bazaars,—behold, it is not BIZ!"
                     But to all the prince answered gravely, "It is right; on my own head be
                     it!"</p>
                  <p>But the oldest and wisest of the merchants, they who had talked with Prince
                     BADFELLAH the same morning, whispered together, and gathered around the BROKAH
                     whose bond the Prince BULLEBOYE had torn up. "Hark ye," said they, "our brother
                     the Prince BULLEBOYE is cunning as a jackal. What bosh is this about ruining
                     himself to save thee? Such a thing was never heard before in the bazaars. It is
                     a trick, O thou mooncalf of a BROKAH! Dost thou not see that he has heard good
                     news from his godmother, the same that was even now told us by the Prince
                     BADFELLAH, his confederate, and that he would destroy thy bond for fifty
                     thousand sequins because his STOKH is worth a hundred thousand! Be not
                     deceived, O too credulous BROKAH! for this what our brother the prince doeth is
                     not in the name of ALLAH, but of BIZ, the only god known in the bazaars of the
                     city."</p>
                  <p>When the foolish BROKAH heard these things he cried, "Justice, O Aga of the
                     BROKAHS,—justice and the fulfilment of my bond! Let the prince deliver unto me
                     the STOKH. Here are my fifty<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6646-00000170"/>
                     thousand sequins." But the prince said, "Have I not told that my godmother is
                     dying, and that my STOKH is valueless?" At this the BROKAH only clamored the
                     more for justice and the fulfilment of his bond. Then the Aga of the BROKAHS
                     said, "Since the bond is destroyed, behold thou hast no claim. Go thy ways!"
                     But the BROKAH again cried, "Justice, my lord Aga! Behold, I offer the prince
                     seventy thousand sequins for his STOKH!" But the prince said, "It is not worth
                     one sequin!" Then the Aga said, "Bismillah! I cannot understand this. Whether
                     thy godmother be dead, or dying, or immortal, does not seem to signify.
                     Therefore, O prince, by the laws of BIZ and of ALLAH, thou art released. Give
                     the BROKAH thy STOKH for seventy thousand sequins, and bid him depart in peace.
                     On his own head be it!" When the prince heard this command, he handed his STOKH
                     to the BROKAH, who counted out to him seventy thousand sequins. But the heart
                     of the virtuous prince did not rejoice, nor did the BROKAH, when he found his
                     STOKH was valueless; but the merchants lifted their hands in wonder at the
                     sagacity and wisdom of the famous Prince BULLEBOYE. For none would believe that
                     it was the law of ALLAH that the prince followed, and not the rules of BIZ.</p>

                  <head>THE RUINS OF SAN FRANCISCO.</head>
                  <p>TOWARDS the close of the nineteenth century the city of San Francisco was
                     totally ingulfed by an earthquake. Although the whole coast-line must have been
                     much shaken, the accident seems to have been purely local, and even the city of
                     Oakland escaped. Schwappelfurt, the celebrated German geologist, has endeavored
                     to explain this singular fact by suggesting that there are some things the
                     earth cannot swallow,—a statement that should be received with some caution, as
                     exceeding the latitude of ordinary geological speculation.</p>
                  <p>Historians disagree in the exact date of the calamity. Tulu Krish, the
                     well-known New-Zealander, whose admirable speculations on the ruins of St. Paul
                     as seen from London Bridge have won for him the attentive consideration of the
                     scientific world, fixes the occurrence in A. D. 1880. This, supposing the city
                     to have been actually founded in 1850, as asserted, would give but thirty years
                     for it to have assumed the size and proportions it had evidently attained at
                     the time of its destruction. It is not our purpose, however, to<pb n="338-339"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000171"/> question the conclusions of the justly famed
                     Maorian Philosopher. Our present business lies with the excavations that are
                     now being prosecuted by order of the Hawaiian government upon the site of the
                     lost city.</p>
                  <p>Every one is familiar with the story of its discovery. For many years the bay
                     of San Francisco had been famed for the luscious quality of its oysters. It is
                     stated that a dredger one day raked up a large bell, which proved to belong to
                     the City Hall, and led to the discovery of the cupola of that building. The
                     attention of the government was at once directed to the spot. The bay of San
                     Francisco was speedily drained by a system of patent siphons, and the city,
                     deeply embedded in mud, brought to light after a burial of many centuries. The
                     City Hall, Post-Office, Mint, and Custom-House were readily recognized by the
                     large full-fed barnacles which adhered to their walls. Shortly afterwards the
                     first skeleton was discovered; that of a broker, whose position in the upper
                     strata of mud nearer the surface was supposed to be owing to the exceeding
                     buoyancy or inflation of scrip which he had secured about his person while
                     endeavoring to escape. Many skeletons, supposed to be those of females,
                     encompassed in that peculiar steel coop or cage which seems to have been worn
                     by the women of that period, were also found in the upper stratum. Alexis von
                     Puffer, in his admirable work on San Francisco, accounts for the position of
                     these unfortunate creatures by asserting that the steel cage was originally the
                     frame of a parachute-like garment which distended the skirt, and in the
                     submersion of the city prevented them from sinking. "If anything," says Von
                     Puffer, "could have been wanting to add intensity to the horrible catastrophe
                     which took place as the waters first entered the city, it would have been
                     furnished in the forcible separation of the sexes at this trying moment. Buoyed
                     up by their peculiar garments, the female population instantly ascended to the
                     surface. As the drowning husband turned his eyes above, what must have been his
                     agony as he saw his wife shooting upward, and knew that he was debarred the
                     privilege of perishing with her? To the lasting honor of the male inhabitants,
                     be it said that but few seemed to have availed themselves of their wives'
                     superior levity. Only one skeleton was found still grasping the ankles of
                     another in their upward journey to the surface."</p>
                  <p>For many years California had been subject to slight earthquakes, more or less
                     generally felt, but not of sufficient importance to awaken anxiety or fear.
                     Perhaps the absorbing nature of the San Franciscans' pursuits of gold-getting,
                     which metal seems to have been valuable in those days, and actually used as a
                     medium of currency, rendered<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6646-00000172"/> the
                     inhabitants reckless of all other matters. Everything tends to show that the
                     calamity was totally unlooked for. We quote the graphic language of
                     Schwappelfurt:—</p>
                  <p>"The morning of the tremendous catastrophe probably dawned upon the usual
                     restless crowd of gold-getters intent upon their several avocations. The
                     streets were filled with the expanded figures of gayly dressed women,
                     acknowledging with coy glances the respectful salutations of beaux as they
                     gracefully raised their remarkable cylindrical head-coverings, a model of which
                     is still preserved in the Honolulu Museum. The brokers had gathered at their
                     respective temples. The shopmen were exhibiting their goods. The idlers, or
                     'Bummers;—a term applied to designate an aristocratic, privileged class who
                     enjoyed immunities from labor, and from whom a majority of the rulers are
                     chosen,—were listlessly regarding the promenaders from the street-corners or
                     the doors of their bibulous temples. A slight premonitory thrill runs through
                     the city. The busy life of this restless microcosm is arrested. The shopkeeper
                     pauses as he elevates the goods to bring them into a favorable light, and the
                     glib professional recommendation sticks on his tongue. In the drinking-saloon
                     the glass is checked half-way to the lips; on the streets the promenaders
                     pause. Another thrill, and the city begins to go down, a few of the more
                     persistent topers tossing off their liquor at the same moment. Beyond a
                     terrible sensation of nausea, the crowds who now throng the streets do not
                     realize the extent of the catastrophe. The waters of the bay recede at first
                     from the centre of depression, assuming a concave shape, the outer edge of the
                     circle towering many thousand feet above the city. Another convulsion, and the
                     water instantly resumes its level. The city is smoothly ingulfed nine thousand
                     feet below, and the regular swell of the Pacific calmly rolls over it.
                     Terrible," says Schwappelfurt, in conclusion, "as the calamity must have been,
                     in direct relation to the individuals immediately concerned therein, we cannot
                     but admire its artistic management; the division of the catastrophe into three
                     periods, the completeness of the cataclysms, and the rare combination of
                     sincerity of intention with felicity of execution."</p>

                  <head>A NIGHT AT WINGDAM.</head>
                  <p>I HAD been stage-ridden and bewildered all day, and when we swept down with the
                     darkness into the Arcadian hamlet of "Wingdam," I resolved to go no farther,
                     and rolled out in a gloomy and dyspeptic state. The effects of a mysterious
                     pie, and some sweetened carbonic acid known to the proprietor of the "Half-Way
                     House" as "lemming sody," still oppressed me. Even the facetiæ of the gallant
                     expressman who knew everybody's Christian name along the route, who rained
                     letters, newspapers, and bundles from the top of the stage, whose legs
                     frequently appeared in frightful proximity to the wheels, who got on and off
                     while we were going at full speed, whose gallantry, energy, and superior
                     knowledge of travel crushed all us other passengers to envious silence, and who
                     just then was talking with several persons and manifestly doing something else
                     at the same time,—even this had failed to interest me. So I stood gloomily,
                     clutching my shawl and carpet-bag, and watched the stage roll away, taking a
                     parting look at the gallant expressman as he hung on the top rail with one leg,
                     and lit his cigar from the pipe of a running footman. I then turned toward the
                     Wingdam Temperance Hotel.</p>
                  <p>It may have been the weather, or it may have been the pie, but I was not
                     impressed favorably with the house. Perhaps it was the name extending the whole
                     length of the building, with a letter under each window, making the people who
                     looked out dreadfully conspicuous. Perhaps it was that "Temperance" always
                     suggested to my mind rusks and weak tea. It was uninviting. It might have been
                     called the "Total Abstinence" Hotel, from the lack of anything to intoxicate or
                     inthrall the senses. It was designed with an eye to artistic dreariness. It was
                     so much too large for the settlement, that it appeared to be a very slight
                     improvement on out-doors. It was unpleasantly new. There was the forest flavor
                     of dampness about it, and a slight spicing of pine. Nature outraged, but not
                     entirely subdued, sometimes broke out afresh in little round, sticky, resinous
                     tears on the doors and windows. It seemed to me that boarding there must seem
                     like a perpetual picnic. As I entered the door, a number of the regular
                     boarders rushed out of a long room, and set about trying to get the taste of
                     something out of their mouths, by the application of tobacco in various forms.
                     A few immediately ranged themselves around the fireplace, with their legs over
                     each other's chairs, and in that position silently resigned themselves to
                        indigestion.<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6646-00000174"/> Remembering the pie,
                     I waived the invitation of the landlord to supper, but suffered myself to be
                     conducted into the sitting-room. "Mine host" was a magnificent-looking, heavily
                     bearded specimen of the animal man. He reminded me of somebody or something
                     connected with the drama. I was sitting beside the fire, mutely wondering what
                     it could be, and trying to follow the particular chord of memory thus touched,
                     into the intricate past, when a little delicate-looking woman appeared at the
                     door, and, leaning heavily against the casing, said in an exhausted tone,
                     "Husband!" As the landlord turned toward her, that particular remembrance
                     flashed before me in a single line of blank verse. It was this: "Two souls with
                     but one single thought, two hearts that beat as one."</p>
                  <p>It was Ingomar and Parthenia his wife. I imagined a different <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">dénouement</foreign> from the play. Ingomar had taken
                     Parthenia back to the mountains, and kept a hotel for the benefit of the
                     Alemanni, who resorted there in large numbers. Poor Parthenia was pretty well
                     fagged out, and did all the work without "help." She had two "young
                     barbarians," a boy and a girl. She was faded, but still good-looking.</p>
                  <p>I sat and talked with Ingomar, who seemed perfectly at home and told me several
                     stories of the Alemanni, all bearing a strong flavor of the wilderness, and
                     being perfectly in keeping with the house. How he, Ingomar, had killed a
                     certain dreadful "bar," whose skin was just up "yar," over his bed. How he,
                     Ingomar, had killed several "bucks," whose skins had been prettily fringed and
                     embroidered by Parthenia, and even now clothed him. How he, Ingomar, had killed
                     several "Injins," and was once nearly scalped himself. All this with that
                     ingenious candor which is perfectly justifiable in a barbarian, but which a
                     Greek might feel inclined to look upon as "blowing." Thinking of the wearied
                     Parthenia, I began to consider for the first time that perhaps she had better
                     married the old Greek. Then she would at least have always looked neat. Then
                     she would not have worn a woollen dress flavored with all the dinners of the
                     past year. Then she would not have been obliged to wait on the table with her
                     hair half down. Then the two children would not have hung about her skirts with
                     dirty fingers, palpably dragging her down day by day. I suppose it was the pie
                     which put such heartless and improper ideas in my head, and so I rose up and
                     told Ingomar I believed I'd go to bed. Preceded by that redoubtable barbarian
                     and a flaring tallow candle, I followed him up stairs to my room. It was the
                     only single room he had, he told me; he had built it for the convenience of
                     married parties who might stop here, but, that event not happening yet, he had
                     left it half furnished. It had cloth on one side, and large<pb n="346-347"
                        xml:id="VAC6646-00000175"/> cracks on the other. The wind, which always
                     swept over Wingdam at night-time, puffed through the apartment from different
                     apertures. The window was too small for the hole in the side of the house where
                     it hung, and rattled noisily. Everything looked cheerless and dispiriting.
                     Before Ingomar left me, he brought that "bar-skin," and throwing it over the
                     solemn bier which stood in one corner, told me he reckoned that would keep me
                     warm, and then bade me good night. I undressed myself, the light blowing out in
                     the middle of that ceremony, crawled under the "bar-skin," and tried to compose
                     myself to sleep.</p>
                  <p>But I was staringly wide awake. I heard the wind sweep down the mountain-side,
                     and toss the branches of the melancholy pine, and then enter the house, and try
                     all the doors along the passage. Sometimes strong currents of air blew my hair
                     all over the pillow, as with strange whispering breaths. The green timber along
                     the walls seemed to be sprouting, and sent a dampness even through the
                     "bar-skin." I felt like Robinson Crusoe in his tree, with the ladder pulled
                     up,—or like the rocked baby of the nursery song. After lying awake half an
                     hour, I regretted having stopped at Wingdam; at the end of the third quarter, I
                     wished I had not gone to bed; and when a restless hour passed, I got up and
                     dressed myself. There had been a fire down in the big room. Perhaps it was
                     still burning. I opened the door and groped my way along the passage, vocal
                     with the snores of the Alemanni and the whistling of the night wind; I partly
                     fell down stairs, and at last entering the big room, saw the fire still
                     burning. I drew a chair toward it, poked it with my foot, and was astonished to
                     see, by the upspringing flash, that Parthenia was sitting there also, holding a
                     faded-looking baby.</p>
                  <p>I asked her why she was sitting up.</p>
                  <p>"She did not go to bed on Wednesday night before the mail arrived, and then she
                     awoke her husband, and there were passengers to 'tend to."</p>
                  <p>"Did she not get tired sometimes?"</p>
                  <p>"A little, but Abner" (the barbarian's Christian name) "had promised to get her
                     more help next spring, if business was good."</p>
                  <p>"How many boarders had she?"</p>
                  <p>"She believed about forty came to regular meals, and there was transient
                     custom, which was as much as she and her husband could 'tend to. But
                        <emph>he</emph> did a great deal of work."</p>
                  <p>"What work?"</p>
                  <p>"O, bringing in the wood, and looking after the traders' things."</p>
                  <p>"How long had she been married?"</p>
                  <p>"About nine years. She had lost a little girl and boy. Three children living.
                        <emph>He</emph> was from Illinois. She from Boston. Had an education<pb

                     ("Two souls," etc., etc.) "Married and emigrated to Kansas. Thence across the
                     Plains to California. Always on the outskirts of civilization. <emph>He</emph>

                     would be like his father, strong and hearty. Was fearful the girl would be more
                     like her. Had often thought she was not fit for a pioneer's wife."</p>
                  <p>"Why?"</p>
                  <p>"O, she was not strong enough, and had seen some of his friends' wives in
                     Kansas who could do more work. But he never complained,—he was so kind." ("Two
                     souls," etc.)</p>
                  <p>Sitting there with her head leaning pensively on one hand, holding the poor,
                     wearied, and limp-looking baby wearily on the other arm, dirty, drabbled, and
                     forlorn, with the firelight playing upon her features no longer fresh or young,
                     but still refined and delicate, and even in her grotesque slovenliness still
                     bearing a faint reminiscence of birth and breeding, it was not to be wondered
                     that I did not fall into excessive raptures over the barbarian's barian's
                     kindness. Emboldened by my sympathy, she told me how she had given up, little
                     by little, what she imagined to be the weakness of her early education, until
                     she found that she acquired but little strength in her new experience. How,
                     translated to a backwoods society, she was hated by the women, and called proud
                     and "fine," and how her dear husband lost popularity on that account with his
                     fellows. How, led partly by his roving instincts, and partly from other
                     circumstances, he started with her to California. An account of that tedious
                     journey. How it was a dreary, dreary waste in her memory, only a blank plain
                     marked by a little cairn of stones,—a child's grave. How she had noticed that
                     little Willie failed. How she had called Abner's attention to it, but,
                     man-like, he knew nothing about children, and pooh-poohed it, and was worried
                     by the stock. How it happened that after they had passed Sweetwater, she was
                     walking beside the wagon one night, and looking at the western sky, and she
                     heard a little voice say "Mother." How she looked into the wagon and saw that
                     little Willie was sleeping comfortably and did not wish to wake him. How that
                     in a few moments more she heard the same voice saying "Mother." How she came
                     back to the wagon and leaned down over him, and felt his breath upon her face,
                     and again covered him up tenderly, and once more resumed her weary journey
                        beside<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6646-00000177"/> him, praying to God for
                     his recovery. How with her face turned to the sky she heard the same voice
                     saying "Mother," and directly a great bright star shot away from its brethren
                     and expired. And how she knew what had happened, and ran to the wagon again
                     only to pillow a little pinched and cold white face upon her weary bosom. The
                     thin red hands went up to her eyes here, and for a few moments she sat still.
                     The wind tore round the house and made a frantic rush at the front door, and
                     from his couch of skins in the inner room—Ingomar, the barbarian, snored
                     peacefully.</p>
                  <p>"Of course she always found a protector from insult and outrage in the great
                     courage and strength of her husband?"</p>
                  <p>"O yes; when Ingomar was with her she feared nothing. But she was nervous and
                     had been frightened once!"</p>
                  <p>"How?"</p>
                  <p>"They had just arrived in California. They kept house then, and had to sell
                     liquor to traders. Ingomar was hospitable, and drank with everybody, for the
                     sake of popularity and business, and Ingomar got to like liquor, and was easily
                     affected by it. And how one night there was a boisterous crowd in the bar-room;
                     she went in and tried to get him away, but only succeeded in awakening the
                     coarse gallantry of the half-crazed revellers. And how, when she had at last
                     got him in the room with her frightened children, he sank down on the bed in a
                     stupor, which made her think the liquor was drugged. And how she sat beside him
                     all night, and near morning heard a step in the passage, and, looking toward
                     the door, saw the latch slowly moving up and down, as if somebody were trying
                     it. And how she shook her husband, and tried to waken him, but without effect.
                     And how at last the door yielded slowly at the top (it was bolted below), as if
                     by a gradual pressure without; and how a hand protruded through the opening.
                     And how as quick as lightning she nailed that hand to the wall with her
                     scissors (her only weapon), but the point broke, and somebody got away with a
                     fearful oath. How she never told her husband of it, for fear he would kill that
                     somebody; but how on one day a stranger called here, and as she was handing him
                     his coffee, she saw a queer triangular scar on the back of his hand."</p>
                  <p>She was still talking, and the wind was still blowing, and Ingomar was still
                     snoring from his couch of skins, when there was a shout high up the straggling
                     street, and a clattering of hoofs, and rattling of wheels. The mail had
                     arrived. Parthenia ran with the faded baby to awaken Ingomar, and almost
                     simultaneously the gallant expressman stood again before me addressing me by my
                     Christian name, and inviting me to drink out of a mysterious black bottle. The
                     horses were<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6646-00000178"/> speedily watered, and
                     the business of the gallant expressman concluded, and, bidding Parthenia good
                     by, I got on the stage, and immediately fell asleep, and dreamt of calling on
                     Parthenia and Ingomar, and being treated with pie to an unlimited extent, until
                     I woke up the next morning in Sacramento. I have some doubts as to whether all
                     this was not a dyspeptic dream, but I never witness the drama, and hear that
                     noble sentiment concerning "Two souls," etc., without thinking of Wingdam and
                     poor Parthenia.</p>
