               <p>REVEREND SIR,—Herewith I send you a faithful and true history of my life, from my
                  youth up to this time, that I have written in this gloomy dungeon, since my trial
                  and conviction. I also send you, with the same, the life and doing of Zilla Fitz
                  James, (who was my paramour and accomplice for years,) that she has sent me from
                  the city of Mexico, where she is now a novice in a nunnery. I have sent these
                  manuscripts to you, for you to publish to the world, with the hope that they may
                  be the means of saving many from the awful fate that awaits me. There are many,
                  very many, throughout the length and breadth of the land, who are now rushing
                  madly on to the very brink of dissoluteness, regardless of all around, save the
                  carnal desires of a depraved and vitiated appetite. And if I can save them from
                  plunging into the vortex that yawns to receive them with open arms, I feel that I
                  will be doing a little good, as an atonement in part for the many crimes that I
                  have committed.</p>
               <p>That I have been "a cool-blooded, smooth-faced, placid miscreant," will be seen by
                  all who read my chequered and blood-stained history. I have had a fair and
                  impartial trial, and have been found guilty of the treble murder of Colonel Darcy
                  and his two lovely daughters, Beatrice and Juliet, by an impartial jury of twelve
                  of my countrymen. And as I have been a stranger to mercy, for the past eleven
                  years, I neither ask, nor expect to receive mercy, for I feel that I deserve a
                  greater punishment than the law can inflict.</p>
               <p>Through your kind and pious endeavors, I have been induced to sincerely repent of
                  all my sins, and I have a hope that they are all blotted out of the book of
                  remembrance. Words are too weak, too powerless, to express how much I feel
                  indebted to you, for the many kindnesses you have extended toward me, since my
                  incarceration. But my heart can feel what I can't express. Let me, then, I beseech
                  you, as a last request, request you to publish the manuscripts that I have
                  herewith sent you, for the reasons that I have before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Trusting that you will not refuse this last request of the miserable man that is
                  soon to be launched into eternity, I am, with a broken and contrite spirit, as I
                  hope, my dear sir,</p>
               <closer>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>THE ARCH FIEND.</head>
               <p>I WAS born in the city of New York, in 1817, in a house somewhere on Greenwich
                  street, between Duane and Spring streets. My father was a wealthy importer, and
                  his store was in William street. Our family consisted of five persons, namely, my
                  father, mother, two sisters, and myself. I was the youngest of the three children,
                  and as such was the pet of both my father and mother. All was sunshine and
                  happiness in our family, until I arrived at the age of sixteen years, when a dark
                  cloud spread over our house, and which forever shut out the light of happiness
                  from us all.</p>
               <p>In 1833, that fell destroyer, the Cholera,—the great scourge of mankind, the
                  castigator of nations,—that peculiar, invisible something, that was first
                  generated in the swamps, marshes, and jungles of India, and from thence visited
                  successively all the nations of Asia, Africa, and Europe, and then crossed the
                  track less ocean to America, carrying devastation and death, more terrible than
                  that of a thousand armies—made its appearance in New York. My mother, who was a
                  feeble woman, soon fell a victim to the destroyer, leaving our once happy home, a
                  happy home no more. From that hour, happiness was shut out of our house. My
                  father, who loved my mother more than his life, could not bear the blow; it was
                  too much for him: <q>
                     <l>"Melancholy sat on him as a cloud along the sky."</l>
                  </q> He mourned, and would not be comforted, because "she was not." His grief soon
                  laid him on a sick bed, from which he never recovered, for the same destroyer
                  claimed him as his victim,<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5587-00000004"/> leaving my two
                  sisters and myself alone in a heartless world; no one to care whether our career
                  was glorious or criminal.</p>
               <p>The court appointed a celebrated lawyer as our guardian, to settle my father's
                  property. Instead of being a father to us, he proved to be a villain of the
                  darkest kind. After cheating us out of more than half of the property that was
                  left us, he seduced both of my sisters, under promise of marriage, and then
                  deserted them, leaving them the only alternatives—death or the house of ill fame.
                  When I learned this, I was in such misery that I neither ate nor slept for three
                  days. I became almost a raving maniac. I was the miserablest of the miserable, and
                  swore revenge, let it cost what it might. For days and weeks, I thought only of
                  revenge, and how to accomplish it,—"there was the rub." From the noble and
                  generous youth, I became a misanthrope. By night and by day, I thought only of
                  blood—blood! At last I thought that I would decoy the villain out, some dark
                  night, and finish him. When I had come to this conclusion, I felt more ease in my
                  mind, weighed the matter carefully, gave it a candid and sane investigation,
                  perused it, and balanced it in my mind, when I hit upon the following plan; I
                  wrote him a note, disguised in a female hand, (that of a mistress of his,)
                  requesting him to meet me on the corner of Rosevelt and Water streets, at ten
                  o'clock the next evening, as I had something of grave import to communicate to
                  him, and that I did not wish him to come to the house, as the landlady and I had
                  had a quarrel, &amp;c. I dispatched this note by the hands of a trusty negro, and
                  bade him bring me an answer on the same slip of paper. I also instructed him to
                  tell the lawyer that a lady sent him with it, &amp;c., if he was questioned. In
                  about an hour, the negro returned with an answer, that he would be punctual at the
                  time and place appointed. In the meantime, I had prepared myself with a sticking
                  plaster, and a bowie knife. At precisely half-past nine of the clock, I sallied
                  out to meet my victim. I soon arrived on the ground, and found that I was there
                  first. I reconnoitered all around, to see if there was any watchman prowling
                  around, and on becoming assured that none of those guardians of the night were in
                  that vicinity, I took up my position on Rosevelt street, behind a lamp, so that I
                  could see all that was passing, whilst I remained secure from observation. I had
                  not been in this position long, before I saw a figure, wrapped in a large cloak,
                  approaching stealthily down Water street. As the figure approached me, I saw as he
                  passed under the lamp that it was him, although he had his face mostly concealed
                  under the cloak. As the object of my deep, dire hatred and revenge approached in
                  close proximity to me, my bosom, that was before swelled with passion, ceased
                  heaving as a tumultuous sea, my heart began to palpitate, my sinews seemed to grow
                  old and weak for the moment, and I felt more like the victim than the victimizer.
                  A thousand thoughts rushed through my brain at once. Fear took hold of me and I
                  saw, in my mind's eye, a gloomy and loathsome dungeon, and myself incarcerated
                  there; again, I saw a court room, the judge, jury, and a scoffing multitude; I
                  heard the judge charge the jury, and call me a cool-blooded murderer; the jury
                  retired for a short time, and then returned into the court room; the foreman
                  handed forth a sealed verdict, the clerk of the court opened it, and read
                  aloud—GUILTY! The judge bade me stand up, and sentenced me to be hung by the neck
                  until I was dead. I saw the gallows, felt the rope around my neck, the sheriff
                  raise his hand to sever the small cord that sustained the weights, when I would
                  rush before the "Judge of the quick and the dead." I say I saw all this in my
                  mind's eye, in a few moments, as I stood contemplating my intended victim.
                  Conscience was beginning to make a coward of me, when he came near enough for me
                  to put my hand upon him. That instant, all my better feelings vanished. I thought
                  only of the many wrongs that I had suffered at his hands, the thoughts of which
                  tore me with malignant passion, and made me firmer in my purpose of revenge.</p>
               <p>I watched him for a few moments, as a cat watches a mouse, when he turned his back
                  to me and peered through the gloom up Water street. Now, thought I, my chance has
                  come. I spread the plaster out in my hand, and crept stealthily up to him, and as
                  he turned to look down the street, I slapped him on the mouth with my right hand,
                  which held the plaster; the plaster adhered fast to his lips, so that he could not
                  cry out. I then seized his arms from behind, and slipped a running noose over
                  them, and drew it tight around his wrists; thus I had him completely in my power.
                  I then tore the mask off my face, and looked sternly at him: "Now then,
                  contemptible and treacherous villain!" whispered I in his ear—for I did not dare
                  to speak loud—"prepare to meet your doom, for you shall die as a dog. Think of
                  your perjured oaths; think of the widows and orphans you have robbed; think of the
                  many drunkards, thieves, and assassins you have made, by defrauding and robbing
                  them of their just dues! Think of the many innocent females you have ruined, both
                  soul and body, and whose blood now calls for vengeance, louder than the blood of
                  Abel cried against the unnatural brother Cain! Think of me, whom you have brought
                  to be a murderer, and God only knows what else, when I might have been an ornament
                  to society! Think, I say, of all this mass of evidence against you, and let that
                  coward soul of yours suffer, with bitter foreboding, an eternity of misery in a
                  moment, as a foretaste of what is prepared for you in hell, you obdurate,
                  adamantine, calcined wretch, as you pass 'to that bourne from<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC5587-00000005"/> whence no traveler returns,' for you are a stranger
                  to mercy, and shall receive none!"</p>
               <p>With this, I drew forth my well-tempered bowie knife, and raised it above my head,
                  in my right hand. Such a woeful and dejected visage, such agony as the coward
                  endured in that moments, as the rays of the light shone on the burnished steel, I
                  never shall forget, as he writhed in his bonds, and tried to speak. To see the
                  villain thus tormented, filled me with the most pleasurable emotions; I was doubly
                  repaid that moment, for all that I had suffered, and was doomed to suffer at his
                  hands, and through his instrumentality. Without more ado, I plunged the fatal
                  knife up to the hilt into his black heart, and as I drew it forth again, the warm
                  life blood of a crimson hue flowed copiously. He gave a few struggles, and all was
                  over—what, a few moments before, was one of God's noblest creatures—man—all life
                  and animation, was now a lifeless corpse!</p>
               <p>I caught him up in my arms, bore him to the river, and plunged him in, and then
                  threw the fatal knife in after him, and hurried from the spot. That was my first
                  deed of blood, and the commencement of my terrible career of crime. Strange as it
                  may seem, I had no remorse of conscience, no frightful dreams, but on the
                  contrary, I felt that I had "done the state some service," in ridding it and the
                  world of such a villain. I walked deliberately to my lodgings, and retired to rest
                  with an easy mind, where I soon fell to sleep, and had delightful dreams. I awoke
                  refreshed and happy. After breakfast, I sauntered out, and went down to the scene
                  of the late murder, where I saw many people collected around the blood that had
                  flowed from the stab that I had given the lawyer, and which was traced down to the
                  water's edge. But who was the victim, or who was the victimizer, none knew or
                  could even guess, so I was certain that I would not be detected.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, I began to be morose and melancholy. I wanted action. I had never
                  done anything like work, and my money began to go fast. I took to drinking, to
                  drown my sorrow. My father and mother were both dead; my sisters—I will not speak
                  of them—and I had spent nearly all that I had received of my father's property. I
                  began to lounge about the porter-houses, billiard saloons, ten-pin alleys,
                  gambling hells, &amp;c. I drank deep, played high, and associated with low
                  company, so that I soon contracted very vicious habits.</p>
               <p>Such a state of things was doomed to work my utter ruin. One night I happened into
                  a gambling hell, in Canal street, with twelve hundred dollars in my pocket—the
                  last I had on earth. I drank deep, and played monte, faro, &amp;c., until I lost
                  every dollar. I became desperate, took off my coat, vest, and hat, and played them
                  away too. Fortune was against me, and I was a beggar. I became frantic, tore my
                  hair, stamped my feet, and cursed all that was in the place, and my Maker too. I
                  began to loathe and despise myself.</p>
               <p>I noticed a tall, handsome, noble-looking man, with an imperial and moustache,
                  dressed in the height of fashion, sporting a heavy gold watch and chain, &amp;c.,
                  who was winning all the time I was losing. He came up to me in my distress, spoke
                  kindly to me, asked me where I lived, &amp;c., and then coaxed me to leave the
                  place peaceably, and not create a row. Through his persuasion, I was induced to
                  leave, and when we got out in the street, he persuaded me to go home, and that he
                  would call and see me the next morning. I went home with a heavy heart, and threw
                  myself on the bed, without taking off my clothes—I was too drunk to do that,—and
                  slept soundly.</p>
               <p>The next morning I was aroused by the servant, who informed me that there was a
                  gentleman below, that had been waiting an hour to see me. I roused myself up, and
                  bade the servant show him up. As soon as he entered, I recognized the man I had
                  seen in the gambling hell in Canal street, the night before. I welcomed him with
                  the best grace I could command at the time—for I felt very miserable, to think
                  that I was not worth a cent in the world. He looked pleasantly, and bade me look
                  upon him as my friend; he had seen the bad luck I had the previous evening, and
                  hearing me say that was my last dollar, he had determined to befriend me. I
                  thanked him kindly, and said, "I can't see what there is prepossessing in me, that
                  has made you determine to be a friend of mine, seeing I am an entire stranger to
                  you."</p>
               <p>"If you will listen with a little patience," said he, "I will explain why I am
                  interested in you. First, then," said he, "I have taken great pains to inquire who
                  and what you are, and I have learned, that, of late, you have associated with very
                  low company, and run through all your means. Secondly, that you are not one that
                  will lay idle, when you have no money, but will have money, whether you get it
                  honestly or dishonestly. I have learned all this from your two sisters, who are
                  living at Nancy L——'s, in C——street, therefore you can't deny the impeachment. I
                  see that you are a very smart, shrewd, and bold young man, and if you will join
                  your fate with mine, I will help you out of your dilemma."</p>
               <p>I told him that I could not make up my mind until I knew who and what he was; that
                  he was inclined to be my friend, I had no doubt; still, I must have a sure thing
                  of it.</p>
               <p>"You are of the right stripe," said he, "and I will tell you who and what I am
                  without any circumlocution. My name is Birchead, and I belong to an order that
                  call themselves the 'Banditti of the West,' and our business is nothing more nor
                     less<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5587-00000006"/> than counterfeiting,
                  horse-stealing, negro-stealing, house-burning, highway-robbing, burglary, larceny,
                  &amp;c., as the law terms it, although we term it different. No species of crime,
                  no ingenuity of plan, no want of means for our purpose, is left unknown. If you
                  want to travel and live a life of ease and comfort, at the expense of the rich, I
                  am the man that can and will initiate you; for you suit me to a charm, and if I
                  have rightly heard of, and judged you, you will accept of my friendship and
                  purse.</p>
               <p>"I will now give you a short sketch of my life," said he, "and, if after hearing
                  that, you choose to close with my offer, I shall be glad.</p>
               <p>"I was born in the city of London. My father was a celebrated banker, in Lombard
                  street. As I was the only child, my parents, doated on me to idolatry, and every
                  thing I craved or desired, was freely given. The best teachers in the United
                  Kingdom were engaged as my tutors, and brought into the house to instruct me. At
                  the age of seventeen I was sent to the university in Oxford, where I graduated
                  with the highest honors; which was a gratification to my father and mother, as
                  they had designed me for the church. Shortly after my return home, I became
                  acquainted with a nobleman's son who used to come and borrow money of my father.
                  That acquaintance begot friendship of the strongest kind. He was a kind and
                  affectionate young man, but rattleheaded and dissipated; as most all noblemen's
                  sons are. He became my boon companion, and would go no where, nor do anything,
                  unless I was with him, and, as a consequence, he led me into many vices and
                  excesses that I had before been a stranger to. He took me around to the different
                  theatres, the opera, billiard saloons, gin-palaces, gambling houses, such as
                  Crockford's, Almack's, &amp;c., and initiated me into all the vices and follies of
                  the age. You may think, and that justly, that such a life quite unfitted me for
                  the clerical robes, and I began to feel an aversion for that profession, as it was
                  not congenial to my feelings. My father saw at last the vicious course I was
                  pursuing, and tried to reclaim me; but I was lost too deep in dissipation to be
                  easily reclaimed. The seeds of vice had been sown in a fruitful soil. I loved the
                  bacchanalian's life too well, to eschew it and take to the sacred desk. The idea
                  of such a thing I would not harbor for a moment. My father took it to heart, which
                  soon laid him on a sick bed, from which he never rose; for he died with a broken
                  heart in less than six months, and my mother soon followed him to the tomb. I was
                  glad when he died, for I then came into possession of all his property. Friends
                  and acquaintances multiplied very fast, as soon as it became known that I had
                  succeeded to my father's property. They stuck to me like leeches, and invented
                  thousands of plans for enjoyment, always at my expense. I took a large
                  establishment, fitted it up in the most expensive style, kept a mistress, joined
                  the clubs, drank deep, played high, and gave costly dinners to my friends every
                  day. For two years I carried on this state of things, when, one morning, my
                  steward requested an audience, and informed me that I was not worth a shilling in
                  the world, but, on the contrary, was in debt over five hundred pounds. Here was a
                  state of things that I had never dreamed of, and, what to do, I did not know. I
                  resolved to keep up appearances a little while longer, and to tell some of my
                  warmest friends the state of my finances, and see if they would not help me in my
                  dilemma. But I soon found that I had 'reckoned without my host,' for, no sooner
                  was the state of my finances known, than my friends deserted me on every hand, my
                  creditors presented their bills, and demanded payment, and, finally, to close the
                  scene, I was thrown into prison, for debt. Not one of all my numerous friends came
                  to see me. All had deserted me, and left me to rot in prison.</p>
               <p>"I remained in Bridewell twelve long and dreary months, with thieves,
                  counterfeiters, burglars, and assassins for my companions. There I learned to be
                  what I am this day. I came out swearing vengeance against those who had robbed me
                  of my substance, and then left me in poverty and disgrace. I determined to care
                  for no man, nor no law. I was without money or friends, the two worst things that
                  I could be guilty of. I had one good suit of clothes left, and a good trunk. I put
                  on my good suit, and put about fifty pounds of stones into my trunk, to make it
                  weigh heavy, and then took rooms at one of the largest hotels in London. I changed
                  my name, and resolved to practice what I had learned in prison. I commenced
                  picking pockets at the railway depots. I found that I was an apt scholar, and
                  could pick pockets with the greatest ease, as I stole systematically, over three
                  hundred pounds in one week. I then became acquainted with a locksmith, who I
                  employed to make me false keys, from impressions I had taken in wax. With these
                  keys I entered the rooms of the boarders, &amp;c., at the hotel where I was
                  stopping, and stole several hundred pounds from their trunks, &amp;c., and then I
                  threw the keys down the vault, for fear of detection. I then took an impression,
                  in wax, of the lock of a large jewelry store, and had the same locksmith make me a
                  key to fit that. The night of the queen's birthday, I entered the store, and
                  robbed it of a large number of gold and silver watches, diamond rings, &amp;c.,
                  which were worth over five thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>After this bold robbery, I thought it best to lie still a week or two, and then
                  take a tour on the continent. I took my departure from London, and went to Paris,
                  where I soon joined a band of counterfeiters, who were counterfeiting on the Bank
                  of England, and the Bank of France. I undertook the sale of these counterfeits,
                  and traveled through Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany,<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC5587-00000007"/> Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Prussia, Poland, Austria,
                  Turkey and Greece. I traveled as an English nobleman, and stopped a few weeks in
                  Madrid, Lisbon, Rome, Stockholm, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Vienna, Warsaw,
                  Constantinople, Athens, Naples, &amp;c. My tour was a successful one, and, after
                  two years, I found myself again in London, where I had come for the purpose of
                  taking leave of that city forever, as I intended to go to Liverpool, and take
                  passage for America, which I did, after a stay of a few weeks in London. I arrived
                  here in New York three years ago, and soon found boon companions, and have been
                  with the order—of which I am now second in command—for the last two years. We are
                  reaping a rich harvest, and enjoy ourselves to our heart's content, at the expense
                  of others. Now, if you prefer a free and easy life, the same as I enjoy, you have
                  only to say the word, and I will take you as my protege."</p>
               <p>As the reader will perceive, Birchead knew his man. He had become acquainted with
                  my history, and knew, before offering me what he did, that I would only be too
                  happy to accept of such a flattering offer. It was just what I had long desired.
                  My mind was just enough vitiated and depraved to accept, with gratitude, such a
                  chance, and I did accept. I thanked him for taking such an interest in me, and
                  swore to be his to command forever. He had but lately returned to the city, from
                  the west, in order to get up some burglar's tools, press, &amp;c., for
                  counterfeiting, and was to return west as soon as he had got those things all
                  right.</p>
               <p>After my swearing to be his, he pulled out his pocket-book, and gave me five
                  hundred dollars, and told me to enjoy myself. I recollect well with what pleasure
                  I took that first installment for the purchase of a career of crime. That five
                  hundred dollars sealed my fate. I mentally swore that I would have as much as he
                  had, and make myself as famous. How I followed that resolution, will be seen by
                  the reader, anon.</p>
               <p>First, I determined to murder my two sisters, who were living a life of shame in a
                  house of ill fame in Church street. Every time I thought of them I was in agony,
                  and I determined to cut them off, "root and branch." I sent a negro to a drug
                  store for half an ounce of strychnine, two ounces of laudanum, half an ounce of
                  corrosive sublimate, and half an ounce of arsenic, and bade the negro tell the
                  druggist that I wanted them for chemical purposes. I thought that I would get a
                  large quantity of these poisons, so that I could murder systematically when I felt
                  like it. I also purchased some prussic acid and chloroform, so I was pretty well
                  supplied with deadly messengers. After thinking over the most feasible way of
                  murdering both of my sisters, at once, I resolved to use prussic acid. I went and
                  purchased some fine peaches, and injected prussic acid into some of them, and then
                  I waited until evening, when I went to the house of ill fame where my sisters
                  were, and when all were engaged in talking and drinking below, I slipped up stairs
                  to their rooms, and left the poisoned peaches—after which, I hurried down stairs,
                  and joined the crowd below. After stopping a couple of hours, I took my departure.
                  I never saw my sisters alive after that. They ate the peaches that night, and both
                  were found dead in their beds the next day. An inquest and post-mortem examination
                  was held on them the next day, and the coroner's jury brought in a verdict of
                  suicide by prussic acid.</p>
               <p>I had now accomplished all I desired to accomplish in New York, and was desirous
                  to take my departure for the Far West. Birchead having got his burglar's tools all
                  made, nothing remained now to keep us in the city, so we packed up our baggage for
                  our departure. We took passage on one of those floating palaces, on the Hudson,
                  for Albany, on the 14th of August, 1840. There was any quantity of passengers, and
                  all was merry. I recollect well that trip to Albany. The passengers were about
                  equally divided, half being Harrison men, and half being Van Buren men. Log
                  cabins, hard cider, and the sub-treasury being the themes with old and young, rich
                  and poor. We passed off ourselves as gentlemen's sons, from England, who had
                  lately come to this country to make a tour through it, &amp;c. As we were neutral,
                  each of the admirers and supporters of the respective candidates, Harrison and Van
                  Buren, were loud in extolling their respective claims and merits to their
                  suffrage, and, as we followed the advice of Shakespeare, who says, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice,</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q> we won the confidence of all.</p>
               <p>Among the passengers were two southern gentlemen, going to Saratoga for their
                  wives and daughters, who pressed us strongly to leave our route awhile, and go
                  there for a few days. After a good deal of persuasion, we allowed ourselves to be
                  persuaded to go. After that was settled, I thought the chances were good to
                  relieve some of the rich passengers of some of their valuables; so I whispered my
                  mind to Birchead, who concurred in my opinion, and, without more ado, we went to
                  work systematically, and stole over $2000 from the pockets of the passengers, and
                  hid it among the freight, well knowing that they would find out their loss before
                  they reached Albany, and that a general search would ensue. We then joined a group
                  of some dozen or more, and entered into conversation with them for an hour or so,
                  and then retired to our state-rooms.</p>
               <p>We were the first astir, in the morning, and went direct to the<pb n="16-17"
                     xml:id="VAC5587-00000008"/> Captain, and informed him that we had been robbed.
                  This was soon noised about, and those who had been robbed by us, came to the
                  Captain, with woful countenances, and told their loss too. The boat was stopped,
                  all the passengers collected together, and a general search ensued, we undergoing
                  a search the same as the other passengers. As a matter of course, nothing was
                  found, and the boat proceeded on her way. In due time, we arrived in Albany, and,
                  according to our arrangement with the southern gentlemen, we took passage for
                  Saratoga, first securing our plunder. Without delay, we arrived there, and took
                  rooms at the United States Hotel, with our southern friends. We stayed there two
                  weeks, enjoying ourselves beyond measure. To show our gratitude to the gentlemen
                  that brought us there, and introduced us to their wives and daughters, Birchead
                  seduced one, and I the other gentleman's daughter, under promise of marriage, and,
                  not being satisfied with that, we entered the rooms of the boarders and strangers,
                  with skeleton keys, and broke open their trunks, and rifled them of everything
                  valuable, which we buried about a mile from there. The entering of the rooms, and
                  breaking open of the trunks, caused a great commotion in the house, but suspicion
                  was never directed towards us, as we were very careful how we proceeded.</p>
               <p>At this time, there arrived a rich gentleman from Quebec, L. C., who was very
                  prodigal of his money, and made a great display. He wanted us to make two of a
                  party that was going to Lake George, to hunt and fish. Birchead and I canvassed
                  the matter over, and resolved to accompany him; and we also resolved to murder him
                  too, and possess ourselves of his money, of which he had over three thousand
                  pounds, in a belt around his body. After coming to this resolution, we prepared
                  ourselves for the journey to Lake George. In due time, we all arrived there, and
                  hired boats for sailing and fishing. We managed to have the rich Canadian in our
                  boat, which was all we desired. We hoisted our sail, and put out into the Lake,
                  distancing all the other boats, so that in half an hour none were to be seen.
                  After sailing about another half hour, I pulled out a flask of brandy, in which I
                  had put a large portion of strychnine, and presented it to the Canadian to drink,
                  which he took and drank a large draught from, and returned it to me, which I
                  skillfully changed for another just like it, but containing no poison, which I
                  drank from, and Birchead also. After awhile I presented the bottle containing the
                  poison again to the Canadian, which he took, and drank heartily from again. In a
                  little while the poison began to work, and he reeled over and fell into the bottom
                  of the boat. We then unloosed his clothes, and removed the money-belt, from which
                  we took the money, and then replaced the belt, buttoned his clothes as before, and
                  plunged him into the lake. We then steered in the course the other boats took, and
                  hoisted a flag of distress. We soon came in sight of the other boats, and when
                  they saw our signal, they steered for us, and when near enough we informed them
                  that the Canadian had fallen overboard, and was drowned before we could rescue
                  him. We told our tale in such a sad and mournful way, that we carried conviction
                  at once that we told the thing just as it was. This put a damper on our spirits,
                  and as we knew there was no use of trying to regain the body, we determined to
                  return to Saratoga. When there, we pretended to be bowed down with grief for the
                  melancholy end of our friend, who had found a watery grave. We stayed a few days
                  longer in Saratoga, when we announced to our southern friends the necessity of our
                  departure for the west. We had before made all things right with their daughters,
                  whom we had seduced, by promising to see them on their plantation near Nashville,
                  Tennessee, in a few weeks, and make them our brides, and they had promised secrecy
                  in relation to what had occurred. Having thus arranged everything so nicely, we
                  left Saratoga for Schenectady and the west.</p>
               <p>We took passage from Schenectady for Buffalo, where we arrived without delay, and
                  put up at the American Hotel. Here we met two of the gang, who had come on from
                  Cincinnati to join us here. After holding a consultation, we decided to stop in
                  Buffalo awhile, and see what could be done to advantage. The two who had just
                  joined us, had brought on considerable counterfeit gold coin, and about five
                  thousand dollars in counterfeit bills on the State Bank of Ohio, which they were
                  disposing of very rapidly. One of these two men was a locksmith, and he went to
                  work and made some false keys to a bank and dry goods store, the locks of which I
                  had taken an impression of in wax. When everything was prepared, we waited until
                  one stormy night, and then two of us robbed the bank, whilst the other two robbed
                  the dry goods store. We then divided our booty, and went and buried it.</p>
               <p>A few nights after that, as Birchead and myself were walking down Rock street, we
                  saw a gaudily dressed stranger in the barroom of the Buffalo Astor House, and that
                  the frail women (of whom there was a goodly number in the bar-room) were plying
                  him with liquor, preparatory to robbing him. We stopped, and coquetted awhile with
                  the women, and talked to the stranger until we lured him out, and took him down
                  Rock street to Erie street, and thence along to the beach, where we robbed and
                  murdered him, and threw him into the lake. We then returned up town, via Erie
                  street. We made seven hundred dollars only that time, which was hardly
                     <unclear>worth</unclear> murdering a man for. We thought we would not stay much
                     <unclear>longer</unclear> in Buffalo, so Birchead decided that we should go
                  directly on to Cincinnati, and leave the other<pb n="18-19"
                     xml:id="VAC5587-00000009"/> two men behind, to go east as far as Boston, and
                  dispose of what counterfeit money they had on hand, before they returned to
                  Cincinnati.</p>
               <p>So we started with our booty for Cincinnati, via Erie and Pittsburgh, and then
                  down the Ohio river. We arrived in Cincinnati the last of November, with about
                  seventeen thousand dollars a piece. Here we went on a spree, which lasted five
                  weeks, and in that time I spent nearly all of my money. By hard spreeing for so
                  long a time, I was laid up with a fit of sickness that lasted five weeks longer,
                  so that the month of February found me very weak and nearly penniless. In
                  gratitude to the young lady that watched over me in my sickness, and ministered to
                  my wants, I promised to marry her, and then, on the strength of that, I seduced
                  her, and then got her to pass some counterfeit bills on the Yates County Bank, N.
                  Y., which brought her to the penitentiary, where she died.</p>
               <p>As I began to get about, Birchead, (who had kept by me all the while I was sick,)
                  suggested that it would be a good idea <choice>
                     <sic>to to</sic>
                     <corr>to</corr>
                  </choice> take a trip down the Ohio and Mississippi, and play poker, eucher,
                  &amp;c., and fleece the green ones that are always to be found there in abundance.
                  He thought it would be good for my health, as well as quite lucrative too. So we
                  took passage on the Circassian for New Orleans. Our trip was a pleasant, and
                  profitable one, too, as we made over seven thousand dollars in the six days we
                  were going down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. We separated in New Orleans,
                  Birchead going to the St. Louis, and I to the St. Charles Hotel. The city was full
                  of strangers from the northern states, who come to New Orleans to spend the
                  winter, for pleasure and profit. The trip down the river had acted like a charm on
                  my health, as it completely restored me to health and vigor. My health having
                  returned, I was quite spirited, and began to look about for some active business
                  in my line. I walked daily through Charles, Canal, Old Levee, Poydras, &amp;c.
                  streets, every day, looking for something that I could turn my hand to, for the
                  space of a week, without finding anything that I thought would pay. This
                  inactivity I could not endure much longer, when I resolved to go to a masquerade
                  ball the next Sunday evening, and see what I could find there in the way of
                  business. So, as soon as the idea came into my head, I went to the St. Louis Hotel
                  and engaged Birchead to go along with me. This was Saturday, Sunday evening came,
                  and with it Birchead and I to the ball. There was "as motley a crew as ever a
                  person knew." We had secreted our bowie knives back of our neck, between our shirt
                  and vest, so that the officers at the door could not find them, as they searched
                  all who entered, and would not allow any one to carry weapons in the room,
                  Birchead was dressed as a bear, and I as a lion; and our costume attracted a good
                  deal of attention. There was a very large crowd, and all dressed differently, in
                  dominoes, &amp;c. This was the first time I had ever been in a masquerade ball,
                  and I enjoyed it very much.</p>
               <p>I soon became at home, and went to flirting with this and that domino, when I
                  finally got to flirting with a little fairy-like form that had a most melodious
                  and silvery voice, which at once interested me, and I led her away to the recess
                  of a window, and began to pour forth a tale of love into her willing ear, I knew
                  from the tones of her voice, although I could not see her face, that she was one
                  that moved in the highest walks of life. I became eloquent as a Demosthenes or
                  Cicero, and soon was as deeply smitten by her musical voice as was Cæsar or Antony
                  by Cleopatra, the serpent of the Nile. By pressing my suit with vigor, I made her
                  come to a truce, and tell me who she was, where she lived, &amp;c., and a permit
                  that I might see her the following day.</p>
               <p>We had scarcely got through with this, when a large man, dressed as a wolf,
                  approached, and demanded in stern tones what I wanted? I gave a fierce roar, and
                  told him none of his business; with that he seized hold of me, and attempted to
                  bear me to the floor. The next instant, I drew forth my bowie knife from behind my
                  neck, and plunged it into his throat. He gave a convulsive shudder, and fell to
                  the floor. I sprang back, hoisted the sash, and leaped out on the ground below,
                  and made tracks for the levee, and divesting myself of my domino, done it up in my
                  handkerchief, and went to the St. Charles, and retired at once to my room, but not
                  to sleep; I was filled with fear and dread, lest I was known to the individual
                  that I had stabbed, and as I did not know whether he was able to speak, after
                  falling, and thus divulge who it was that stabbed him. All my fears, however, were
                  groundless, for, at an early hour, Birchead made his appearance, and informed me
                  that I had nothing to fear, as the man that I had stabbed never spoke after
                  falling, and no one knew who or what I was. He also informed me that the man I had
                  murdered, was a gambler that traveled on the Mississippi, and that the woman was a
                  Creole that the gambler had fallen in love with, and had learned, through her
                  servants, the costume she was to appear in at the ball; and furthermore, that the
                  Creole hated and despised the gambler, and was glad that I had finished him. All
                  this pleased me very much, and I felt quite joyful again.</p>
               <p>Seeing that I had nothing to fear, I went boldly out, as before, and called on the
                  Creole, whose acquaintance I had made at the masquerade ball. My killing the
                  gambler had raised me in her estimation, and I found her all smiles when I came
                  into her presence. She was reclining on a sofa, in a small, but gorgeously<pb
                     n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5587-00000010"/> furnished boudoir. As I entered, she bade
                  me take a seat on the sofa, beside her, a command that I was not slow in
                  following. I found her one of the most bewitching little Psyches that I had ever
                  seen. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

                        <l>The mind, the music, breathing from her face,</l>

                  </q> Words are too weak, too powerless to describe her, for <q>

                     </lg>
                  </q> And, as she bent her large, lustrous, gazelle-like orbs on me, and spoke in
                  accents sweet and silvery, I felt the very furze on my hands rise up in rapture.
                  Soon I had "crooked the pregnant hinges of the knee," and swore that I was her
                  most abject slave. She bade me rise from that humble position, and be happy, for
                  my love was reciprocated. I arose, clasped her in my arms, and buried her with
                  kisses, and swore eternal love. After spending a few hours with her, I took my
                  leave, the happiest of the happy.</p>
               <p>I bent my way to the St. Louis hotel, where I found Birchead, and told him of my
                  success with the Creole. He then Informed me that he had a job in view, that
                  required my immediate co-operation, and that was, to go in and divert the
                  attention of the clerks in an exchange office, whilst he carried off a box
                  containing forty thousand dollars, that had just come down the river from
                  Vicksburg; and, without enlightening me further on the subject, he led the way to
                  the exchange office, and I went in ahead of him, and presented some notes to be
                  exchanged, and commenced talking to the clerks about the solvency of some of the
                  banks in New Orleans. Whist I had their attention attracted, Birchead slipped in
                  and bore off the box containing the forty thousand dollars. I kept the clerks busy
                  talking, about ten minutes, and then, as I was taking my departure, the clerks
                  missed the box, which made them turn pale. I noticed their look of blank
                  amazement, and, inwardly chuckled, as I thought how we had "done" the money
                  shavers. They were not long in making their loss known, and soon had the hounds of
                  the law started in every direction, to find the perpetrator of this bold deed. I
                  sauntered away slowly to the St. Louis hotel, where I found Birchead, all right,
                  enjoying an iced lemonade, and, of which he invited me to partake, after which, we
                  adjourned to his room, and counted over the spoils.</p>
               <p>After stopping a few days longer in New Orleans, we concluded to take a trip up
                  the river again, and go to St. Louis, I also determined to take the fair Creole
                  along too. When we had come to this conclusion, I went to Zilla—for that was her
                  name—and told her that I had got to go to St. Louis, and I could not go without
                  her. She readily consented to accompany me, and we made haste for our departure.
                  The next day we took passage for St. Louis, on the "Belle of the West," which
                  place we arrived at in seven days. Nothing worthy of notice occurred on our
                  passage, only that we gambled all the way, and "done" many a green one out of his
                  money, at poker and euchre, Birchead and I always playing partners. In due time we
                  arrived at St. Louis, and put up at the Planters hotel. Here we followed our
                  profession, and entered the rooms of the boarders, and broke open many trunks,
                  relieving them of their valuable contents. We also went into a speculation with
                  the owner of a livery stable, and bought stolen horses, trimmed them, and started
                  them for the eastern market. Besides this, we went extensively into the
                  manufacturing of counterfeit bank notes, with which we supplied the gang all
                  through the south and west. Here I also the perpetrated another foul murder, of
                  which the following are the particulars.</p>
               <p>There was a rich merchant, from Boston, stopping at the Planter's hotel, who had
                  lately come from Boston, and was going to New Orleans to buy sugar, molasses,
                  rice, &amp;c., and had a large amount of money about his person, which I learned
                  by stratagem. I was introduced to him by mine host of the Planter's and the
                  thought struck me, on the instant, that he was a rich prize; so I determined to
                  find out if such was the case, and plucks his feathers. The most feasible way to
                  do this, I thought would be to introduce him to the fair Zilla, and I knew she
                  would feel him. I accordingly invited him to come with me, to our room, and that I
                  would introduce him to my wife. He accepted the invitation gracefully, and walked
                  with me, up stairs. I knew that he could not withstand the influence of her large,
                  lustrous orbs. It turned out just as I had anticipated; he was captivated at once.
                  After sitting a few minutes, I plead an engagement, and left him with Zilla. That
                  was agreeable to both he and I, for I wanted her to coquette with him, and he
                  thought me a prince of good fellows, to thus leave him alone with the fair Zilla.
                  She played her cards admirably, so that before he left her presence, he had fallen
                  on his knees, and sworn how much he loved her. She played the coquette with him,
                  to a charm, seemed to be very coy and bashful, neither repulsed, nor allowed him
                  to advance, but kept him in a state of suspense.</p>
               <p>This was just what I wanted, for I wanted to get him desperately in love with her,
                  and then have him propose an elopement, which he did. She first made him give up
                  all his money, and<pb n="22 (Illustration) -23" xml:id="VAC5587-00000011"/>

                     <head>THE MURDER OF THE BOSTON MERCHANT.</head>
                  </figure> his valuable jewelry, to her keeping, which he did, to the amount of
                  twenty thousand dollars. He became so enamored of her that he could neither eat
                  nor sleep, although she had never allowed him any other favor than to kiss her
                  hand. She kept me advertised of everything that was passing, and informed me that
                  she had agreed to elope with him the next night, and they were to proceed to
                  Bowling Green, Pike county. She had also directed him to hire a carriage of one of
                  our gang, who kept a livery stable in St. Louis. I went to the stable, and told
                  him how to proceed, and be sure and send one of our gang to drive the carriage.
                  Having thus arranged everything with the livery-stable men, Birchead and I mounted
                  two fleet horses, and rode out of the city in an opposite direction from the one
                  Lilla and the gay Lothario were to take. After riding a piece out of the city, we
                  made a circuitous route, and came into the road leading from St. Louis to Bowling
                  Green, about three miles from St. Louis, were we halted in a dense copse, waiting
                  for the carriage containing the truant couple. Soon they hove in sight, and
                  Birchead rode to the horses' head, and presenting a pistol at the driver, as was
                  before agreed upon, commanded him to halt, and give an account of himself and
                  those he was driving. I rode up to the carriage door, at the same time, and opened
                  the same, and bade the gay Lothario get out and deliver up his money. At the same
                  time, I pretended to notice the beautiful woman in the carriage: "Ah!" said I,
                  "here is likely to be something pretty nice, eh? I will trouble you to get out, my
                  pretty little lady," said I, "that I may take a look at you."</p>
               <p>Saying this, I reached in to grab hold of her, when he drew a revolver and fired
                  twice at me, which happily missed me, and I knocked the pistol out of his hands,
                  caught him by the hair of his head, and drew him by main force out of the
                  carriage, and bade Lilla get out too. As soon as she jumped out, I pretended to
                  see for the first time that it was her:</p>
               <p>"Ah, ha!" said I, "what have we here? It is you, Mrs. Long, is it? How in hell
                  came you here? and who is this with you?"</p>
               <p>I called Birchead to bring a light, that I might see who the villain was, that was
                  carrying off my wife. He brought the light, and by its glare I pretended to
                  recognize, for the first time, the Boston man that I had introduced my wife to. I
                  put on a fiendish scowl, and looked daggers at him, and thus addressed him:</p>
               <p>"Is this the way you return my friendship and kindness, in introducing you to my
                  wife, you hoary-headed sinner? Is this the essence of the friendship you have
                  manifested toward me? You would repay my kindness, by robbing me of all that I
                  love and prize in this world, and leave me in wretchedness forever<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC5587-00000012"/> by robbing me of my beloved partner, would you, you
                  contemptible, canting old wretch? Then I will show you how I repay such
                  perfidy."</p>
               <p>With that, I drew my bowie knife, and prepared to kill him. Seeing me raise the
                  knife, with a determined purpose to kill him, he began to moan, cry, and beg me to
                  let him go most piteously, and said he would freely give me all his money and
                  valuables that my wife had of his, if I would only let him go.</p>
               <p>Zilla then came forward, and fell on her knees, and pretended to cry, while she
                  plead piteously for me to spare him. I thrust her away, and swore that I would
                  kill her too, as soon as I had finished him. He was on his knees, and I took him
                  by the hair of his head, and bent him over backwards, and plunged the knife in his
                  bosom at least a dozen times, saying at every plunge I made, "dead men tell no
                  tales." We then took up his lifeless carcass, and carried him about twenty rods
                  from the road, and stuck him into an old rotten log, and covered the same over
                  with bushes. We then sent the carriage back to the city; and we returned by the
                  circuitous route by which we came, and drove up to the Planter's, and had our
                  horses taken to the stable, without exciting any suspicion.</p>
               <p>No mention was ever made about the Boston man, as he had paid his bill, and
                  pretended to have started down the river the afternoon of the preceding day. A few
                  days after this, we concluded to leave St. Louis, and proceed up the river to
                  Nauvoo, Illinois, and see what we could make among the Mormons. Here Birchead and
                  I parted company, he turning Mormon, and taking a spiritual wife. Zilla and I
                  stayed a few months there, too. There I murdered a rich Mormon, that had lately
                  come from England with a large amount of money. I murdered him, and threw him into
                  the Mississippi, after securing three thousand dollars that he had in a belt
                  around his person.</p>
               <p>We went from Nauvoo to Galena, the summer of 1845, and I purchased a nice cottage,
                  and resolved to quit my mode of life; so I determined to settle down and be an
                  honest man. I lived there two years, and done nothing worse than pass bogus gold
                  and counterfeit notes, of which I had a good supply. I shoved a great deal of that
                  kind of money off under the cloak of religion. I went to the Methodist church,
                  where there was a great revival, and Zilla and I pretended to get religion, and
                  joined the church. We invited the dominie to our house, had prayer meetings, gave
                  large sums to the church, and consequently we enjoyed great immunity. But at the
                  expiration of two years, we got tired of the holy life we were leading and longed
                  for the excitement of travel, robbing and murdering; so I concluded to sell my
                  cottage to the dominie, and leave Galena for other parts. The congregation raised
                  a thousand dollars for the dominie to buy our cottage and grounds, which they paid
                  us, and we left with the blessings of all the congregation, and letters from the
                  dominie, setting forth that we were members in good standing of the Methodist
                  Episcopal church in Galena, Illinois. We went directly to Chicago from Galena,
                  where we stopped two weeks, and passed several hundred dollars in counterfeit
                  notes, and burned a warehouse and two private dwellings, belonging to a man that
                  told people to be on their guard for us, that we were no better than we should be,
                  &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From Chicago we went to Lacon, Marshall county, where I scattered the bogus notes
                  and counterfeit bills pretty freely, under the guise of religion. I also robbed an
                  old German farmer, who lived three miles from Lacon, of seven hundred dollars that
                  he had laid away in an old chest. Whilst walking around one day, leisurely, to see
                  what I could do in the way of business, I happened into a dry goods store, and saw
                  the merchant pay the old farmer a considerable sum of money for wheat. After a
                  while, I drawed him into conversation, and he then told me that he lived three
                  miles from Lacon, had a farm, &amp;c., and went on and described his place to me.
                  I resolved to possess myself of some of the old fellow's cash; so, after two days,
                  I disguised myself as a negro, and went to the old man, and requested him to hire
                  me, at ten dollars per month, which he did. Through the garrulity of his wife, I
                  learned that they kept their money in an old oak chest, in their bed-room. That
                  was enough for me to know, for the time. At about twelve of the clock, the same
                  night that I learned so much from the old woman, I crept softly into their
                  bed-room, and applied a handkerchief, saturated with chloroform, to their
                  nostrils, which effectually silenced them sure, for the time at least. I then
                  broke open the chest, in which I found seven hundred dollars in gold, and then
                  started for Lacon, which place I reached about two in the morning. I found that
                  Zilla had left the door unlocked, as I had instructed her, so that my return at
                  that late hour should cause no suspicion. The next day, the old farmer came into
                  Lacon and told his melancholy tale to a magistrate, and got out a warrant for the
                  supposed negro, and sent the constables searching for him in every direction. The
                  officers scoured the country in every direction, for many miles around, but
                  without finding the negro.</p>
               <p>We stayed a week in Lacon after that occurrence, and then went to Peoria, where I
                  met two of the Banditti of the West, from whom I got a supply of bogus gold pieces
                  and counterfeit notes, in exchange for my services, which I rendered in looking up
                  a good sight for them to rob a dry goods store.</p>
               <p>We then went on to Lewiston, Fulton county, where I turned doctor, and stuck out
                  my shingle, which read—Doct. Lawrence Mansfield, Homœopathic Physician, from
                  Philadelphia, Pa. I<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5587-00000013"/> made up about four
                  quarts of small sugar pills, such as are used by homœopathic physicians, and
                  arranged other things in order. I had my forged sheep-skin diploma framed and put
                  up in a conspicuous place in my office; stuck my feet up on the table, smoked my
                  cigar, and was ready to be called out at any time. I stayed in Lewiston one year,
                  and practiced medicine successfully, performing what the good people thought some
                  wonderful cures. Zilla acted in the capacity of a celebrated accoucher from Paris,
                  and soon won the love of all, both old and young, in the village.</p>
               <p>In my range of practice there were two old maids, who heard of my fame, and
                  imagined themselves sick, and sent for me. I obeyed their summons, and on feeling
                  of their pulses, I saw that they were not sick—only they imagined so. I told them
                  they were in a very precarious state, and led them to believe that I was more than
                  an ordinary physician. I visited them professionally every day for three weeks,
                  when I got them both in love with me, and seduced them both. I then began to kill
                  them slowly, by giving them small doses of strychnine, which put an end to them in
                  two weeks from the time I commenced administering the poison. No one supposed but
                  that they died a natural death.</p>
               <p>It was now the first of December, 1848, and I began to get tired of practicing
                  medicine; so I took down my sign and prepared for a removal. Two weeks after I
                  took down my sign, we left Lewiston for Springfield, the capital of Illinois,
                  where we remained a week, and I improved that time in making myself acquainted
                  with the location of the vault of the State Bank of Illinois, and then turned over
                  the job of robbing the same, on shares, to four of our gang, and then left for
                  Cairo, at the mouth of the Ohio, from which place we took passage for New Orleans,
                  and then went to Vera Cruz, Mexico. We stayed in Vera Cruz one week, and I robbed
                  and murdered a rich Spaniard, and then went post-haste to the city of Mexico.
                  There I reveled in the halls of the Montezumas for two weeks, when I got in with a
                  band of Mexican brigands, and left with them to their field of operations, which
                  was the high road from Vera Cruz to Mexico. I left Zilla in Mexico, and I shall
                  say nothing more about her, as I have given a manuscript of her life, written by
                  herself, to the Rev. A. Richards, who will soon publish the same. I have also
                  given him many letters that Zilla has written me, and letters that she received
                  from men in high places, both in church and state. It will be an expose of some
                  great men and women, showing that there are stranger things in heaven and earth
                  than is dreamed of in philosophy. The life and doings of Zilla Fitz james will be
                  read by all, from Maine to California, with great interest. With that I leave the
                  subject, and return to my own life</p>
               <p>I stayed with the gang of Mexican brigands three months, depredating on travelers
                  with success, between the city of Mexico and Amosoque, Amosoque and Puebla, Puebla
                  and Perote, Perote and Vera Cruz. We were all well mounted on fleet horses, and
                  armed to the teeth with pistols, bowie knives, poisons, &amp;c., and carried
                  misery and destruction wherever we went. At the expiration of three months, I had
                  a surfeit of that kind of life, and I deserted from them and went to Vera Cruz,
                  where I took ship and went to Havana. There I made some rich hauls, and among
                  other things, I seduced a Spanish Don's daughter, and took her to New Orleans,
                  where the old Don pursued me; and for his pains, I robbed him of one thousand
                  doubloons, poisoned him with prussic acid, and threw him into the Mississippi, and
                  took his beautiful daughter Inez to Mobile, where we lived in splendor for a
                  month, and then went up the Alabama river to Montgomery, where we put at the
                  Montgomery Hall, and which is one of the finest and best kept hotels in the South.
                  There I scattered a large quantity of bogus doubloons and counterfeit notes, and
                  then went on to Columbus, on the Apalachicola river, and took rooms at the
                  Oglethorpe House, on Oglethorpe street. There I entered the rooms of the boarders,
                  broke open their trunks, &amp;c., without being suspected, and then went down the
                  Apalachicola river to Apalachicola, and from thence to Pensacola, where I played
                  eucher with a navy officer, putting up the beautiful Spanish girl Inez against
                  five hundred dollars, and the officer won her. She was quite willing to go with
                  him, and I was quite willing that she should, as I had had a surfeit of her, and
                  wanted to travel as a single man, for I had lost many rich chances with the ladies
                  in consequence of having Inez with me.</p>
               <p>From Pensacola, I went to New Orleans again, and put up at the Verandah. I staid
                  there one week, and bought a lot of stolen negroes, which I sold at a large
                  profit, and which determined me to try my hand at stealing negroes up the river,
                  and bring them down and sell them in New Orleans. So I took passage up the river,
                  to Louisville, from which place I went out a little way into the country, where I
                  stole six negroes, and smuggled them to the river, when I took them down to New
                  Orleans, and sold them readily, for a good round price. I then returned up the
                  river, to Memphis, from which place I crossed over the country, to Nashville. Here
                  I happened to come across the gentleman whose daughter I had seduced in Saratoga.
                  He remembered me, and said his daughter had died in giving birth to a child, that
                  she said, on her death bed, was mine, and he would be revenged. I saw that I was
                  about getting into trouble with the old fool, so I pretended to take it to heart;
                  told him that we were privately married in Saratoga, and that I intended to have
                  joined him and her, years ago, &amp;c., and requested him to take a walk with
                     me,<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5587-00000014"/> out of town, that we might talk
                  the matter over. He assented, and I decoyed him out of the city, just at
                  nightfall, and, as we walked along, I took out a flask of poisoned brandy that I
                  always carried with me, and pretended to drink from it, and then passed it to him.
                  He, being excited, took the flask, and drank off a large quantity. The subtle
                  poison was not long doing its work, for he soon began to vomit, and writhe with
                  agony. I pitied him, and, to at once end his misery, I plunged my knife into his
                  breast. He gave one convulsive shudder, one horrid groan, a gasp, and fell by the
                  road side. I then threw him into the ditch, by the side of the road, covered him
                  with leaves, and hurried away.</p>
               <p>I returned to Nashville, and staid all night with a courtezan and, the next
                  morning, took a steamboat for Cincinnati. I only staid a few days in Cincinnati,
                  when I forged a note on a rich man living there, for two thousand dollars, which I
                  took to the Commercial Bank, and had it cashed. I then went aboard a steamboat,
                  bound for New Orleans, which city I reached in due time. After stopping there a
                  little time, I thought I would take a trip up the Mississippi and Arkansas rivers,
                  to Little Rock. I arrived here the first week in February, 1850. Here I played the
                  hypocrite to perfection, and soon was introduced into the best society.</p>
               <p>Among the first that I was introduced to, was Colonel Darcy, and his two lovely
                  daughters, Beatrice and Juliet. His two daughters, were worthy of the names they
                  bore. The Colonel seemed to take a great fancy to me, and persuaded me to go out
                  and spend a few weeks on his plantation, he not knowing what a viper I was, but,
                  supposing that I was a rich planter from San Antonio, Texas. After begging him to
                  excuse me, for some time, I at last accepted his invitation, and went with him to
                  his happy home. It was indeed, a <emph>happy home,</emph> for joy was stamped on
                  every countenance, bond and free. His daughters, heavens! how shall I describe
                  them. I cannot adequately describe them. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Grace was in their footsteps, heaven in their eyes,</l>
                        <l>In every gesture, dignity and love.'</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> His slaves were as a sleek, fat, and happy, as any slaves I have ever seen,
                  and I have seen not a few. The Colonel bade me make myself at home, which I was
                  not slow in doing. I soon made up my mind, that, in return for his hospitality, I
                  would seduce his daughters, if such a thing was possible. I put on my most
                  insidious smile, talked in a bland, canting, hypocritical voice, read, sang
                  danced, and wrote sonnets on their eyes, &amp;c. In fine, I left to seductive
                  influence untried, and, was finally rewarded by having them both yield to my
                  desires. I seduced first Beatrice, and then Juliet, by the most solemn
                  asseverations of love, and promised to marry them. Neither of them knew that the
                  other had yielded to me. I treated them both alike, when all three of us were
                  together, and when I was alone with one, I would pretend love and devotion for her
                  alone, so that I played a sure thing on both of the guileless girls. Thus I basked
                  in their smiles and favors, for two months, when the Colonel began to be
                  suspicious that all was not right. I had prolonged my stay from two weeks to two
                  months, and never said anything about leaving. Of late, I never said anything
                  about my plantation, which made the Colonel begin to suspect me of acting
                  dishonorable. He set his negroes to watching my movements, which I soon perceived,
                  and I became certain, when I questioned one of them, and threatened to kill him on
                  the spot, if he did not tell me. He owned that his master had told him to watch my
                  movements with the young ladies. This at once put me on my guard, and I determined
                  to be very careful, in future. Two days after, learning what I have just narrated,
                  from the negro, I proposed to the young ladies to take a ride on horseback. They
                  both assented their willingness to do so, and I ordered the horses, which were
                  soon brought, and we mounted in high spirits. We rode about five miles from the
                  Colonel's residence, when we came to a deep ravine, where a little narrow bridge
                  spanned a rivulet that coursed through the ravine. To the left of the bridge,
                  looking up the rivulet, there was a long strip of low, thick covert, nearly half a
                  mile in length, with a clump of dark pines at the farther end. We rode up to the
                  pines, dismounted, and hitched our horses for a ramble. When in the midst of the
                  thicket, I turned to Juliet, and bade her sit on an old log that was lying at her
                  feet, for a few minutes, whist Beatrice and I would go on a little way and find a
                  suitable place to spread our cloth for a snack.</p>
               <p>Beatrice and I then walked on about two hundred rods, when we came to a stop, and
                  I took her in my arms and laid down with her on a little grass-plat. I began to
                  kiss and toy with her, when the loud crack of a rifle was heard, and a bullet came
                  whizzing past my ears. I sprang up, and the next moment Col. Darcy bounded up to
                  me, and aimed a blow at me with the butt of his rifle, which I dodged, and he came
                  to the ground by the force of the demonstration he had made toward me. I sprang
                  upon him, and seized the rifle, which I wrested from him, and put my foot upon his
                  breast, while, in a voice of thunder, I asked him what he meant. He said he meant
                  to kill me; that I had seduced his daughters, and that he had divined my
                  intentions in riding out in the woods, and had followed me and seen me with his
                  own eyes. Then, said I, you shall never see the like again, and drew my revolver
                  and fired the whole six barrels into his prostrate body.</p>
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5587-00000015"/>
               <p>By this time, Juliet came up to the bloody scene, and both her and Beatrice set up
                  a most dismal lamentation, to see their father stretched out a lifeless corse. I
                  turned upon them, and fairly howled, "You both shall die too! dead people tell no
                  tales!" They both fell on their knees before me, and begged most piteously for me
                  to spare them; but I saw that it would not do, even had I been so disposed. I then
                  seized Beatrice by the hair of the head, and plunged my bowie knife into her
                  heaving bosom three several times, which Juliet seeing, turned to run; but I
                  caught hold of her arm as she was in the act of fleeing, and drew her close to the
                  dead body of her sister, and plunged the knife up to the hilt in her heart, and
                  threw her across the body of her sister.</p>
               <p>When I had completed my damnable work, I stood for a few moments, contemplating
                  the hideous spectacle before me. There the Colonel and his two daughters lay,
                  weltering in their gore. The sun retired behind a cloud, as if ashamed to smile on
                  the horrid spectacle. The wind began to moan a sad requiem to the spirits of the
                  departed. Thick, heavy clouds began to float, suspended from the dome of heaven's
                  high concave, as a pall; and the very birds sang melancholy. As I looked upon the
                  three victims again, this adamantine heart of mine began to feel remorse. I felt
                  rebuked by heaven, and the torments of the damned can not be more terrible than
                  were my feelings at that moment. I would have given worlds to have brought those
                  three back to life. After contemplating them for about ten minutes, I took the
                  Colonel's rifle and laid it by his side, and put the bowie knife into his hand,
                  and hurried from the spot. I made my way to the place I had tied our horses, and
                  unloosed the two the young ladies rode. I then unloosed, and mounted the one I had
                  rode, and rode down the rivulet and washed my hands and face; then rode leisurely
                  back to the Colonel's mansion. When I arrived there, I inquired of the servants if
                  the Misses Darcy had returned, when they told me, no. I told them that I had left
                  them in the road while I went up into the woods awhile, and when I returned they
                  were gone; that I then rode on, thinking to overtake them, and rode at least ten
                  miles, but without seeing or hearing anything of them; that I then concluded to
                  return, thinking they might possibly have returned too. My story caused the old
                  house-keeper great alarm, and she sent the servants out in every direction, in
                  pursuit of the young ladies. By night they all returned, but without having seen
                  anything either of the young ladies or the Colonel.</p>
               <p>All that night none of us slept, the house-keeper and servants sitting up with the
                  hope that the Colonel and young ladies would return, for they thought the Colonel,
                  who went the same direction on horseback that we took, soon after we started, must
                  have overtaken the young ladies, and gone somewhere with them. When they did not
                  come the next morning, the house-keeper sent the servants to a neighboring
                  plantation, and gave the alarm. They came and heard our story, and started in
                  pursuit. I went along with them, to show them where I had parted with the young
                  ladies. When we arrived at the little bridge that crossed the rivulet, I tried to
                  get them to take to the right, but they seeing my agitation, took to the left,
                  where they saw our horses' foot prints, and when they came near the clump of pines
                  they saw the horses that the young ladies rode, browsing near the spot I had
                  unloosed them. They then dismounted, and followed our foot-prints through the
                  devious way we had taken, which soon led them to the fatal spot.</p>
               <p>When they came to see the sad spectacle, they raised one universal shout of
                  horror, then turned and looked at me, and cried, "You are the fiend that has done
                  this!" I strenuously denied all knowledge of the deed, until they found my bowie
                  knife and revolver lying by the side of the Colonel's corse. They then seized and
                  tied me, and took me back to the mansion, with the three corses. Some counseled
                  that I should be lynched, but the majority decided that I should be taken to
                  Little Rock, and be given up to the authorities, which was done, as you well know,
                  last January. Since then, I have been tried, convicted, and sentenced to be hung,
                  which is a more lenient punishment than I deserve. That my doom is certain, as it
                  is well merited, I know full well. I have but a few more words to write, as my
                  tale is told. Let me, then, entreat all, both old and young, to take warning from
                  the dark and dreadful career that I have run for so many years; "resist the
                  tempter and he will flee from you;" remember that "the way of the transgressor is
                  hard." May God, in his mercy, pardon me for the many crimes that I have committed,
                  and save others from treading in the thorny path that I have trodden in, shall be
                  the last prayer of</p>
