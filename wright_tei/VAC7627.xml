a very absurd thing !"&#xD;
The- individual to whom these words were&#xD;
addressed, turned quickly towards the intruder,&#xD;
and made a hasty and significant motion towards&#xD;
the hilt of his sword.&#xD;
"Keep your temper, my lad.     He who&#xD;
speaks cares little for the flash of steel," added&#xD;
the mnf.&#xD;
"1Idesire to be left to my own meditations,"&#xD;
replied the other, sternly.&#xD;
s"You are not over-courteous ; good words&#xD;
are j'st as cheap as bad ones, and, in most&#xD;
cdes mSch cheaper. I'll wager a half crown to&#xD;
a Mount Paidadore farthing that if you knew me&#xD;

ing a menacing look at the intruder.&#xD;
" Come, sir, I mean you no ill; smooth&#xD;
down that threatening visage, and let it assume&#xD;
something akin to good nature," resumed the&#xD;
pertinacious stranger.&#xD;
" It does not matter a straw to me whether&#xD;
you mean me 11n or not. At this particular&#xD;
time I care little for the opinions of men. I&#xD;
ask for no new acquaintances. I only wish to&#xD;
be left to pursue my fortunes -as best pleases&#xD;
me," he answered, in a voice    less stern.&#xD;
"But," he added immediately, "if you would&#xD;
like to cross swords with me, I am ready; and&#xD;
in fact, I rather think that would suit ine as&#xD;
well as anything."&#xD;
" If you cannot wield some implement of&#xD;

8                     THE SILVER BELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Indeed! you do me too much honor !" re-&#xD;
plied the other, ironically.&#xD;
"Not at all; I.have a happy faculty of find-&#xD;
ing out what kind of material people are made&#xD;
of "&#xD;
.Am extraordinary person, truly !"  -&#xD;
"Right !" exclaimed the man, in a more&#xD;
serious tone ; many persons call me extraordi-&#xD;
nary, and have good reason to- think so. And&#xD;
now, young sir, I will tell you why I have ad-&#xD;
dressed'you.  I perceived that you were a&#xD;
stranger in this part of the country; for few&#xD;
acquainted in this vicinity venture hither alone,&#xD;
especially at this hour when the sun is hiding&#xD;
himself in the west. Your dejected air, and&#xD;
moody looks, assured me that the world had&#xD;
gone wrong with you ; and your dress was proof&#xD;
'sufficient that you were not of high rank, but&#xD;
very probably some ambitious, though disap-&#xD;
pointed adventurer."&#xD;
"How very flattering the man is !"&#xD;
" Gently, sir, gently! .we shall know each&#xD;
other'anon. I spoke to you, thinking it might&#xD;
be very possible that I could throw something&#xD;
in  your way that would advance your for-&#xD;
tunes."&#xD;
":You appear to me like one who has-yet his&#xD;
own fortune to aike !" retorted the young&#xD;
"-Gently again, my rustic knight; you must&#xD;
not judge by the outside."&#xD;
. "I only follow your example in doing so."&#xD;
"I said something about your apparel,' I&#xD;
adtit ; fbut beingyour senior by several years,&#xD;
I believe that I may  afely saythat I am  a&#xD;
better judge of human nature."&#xD;
"To out short this conversation, if you will&#xD;
show me the way out of this forest, and to the&#xD;
o~prest inn, you will advance my fortunes, I&#xD;
doubt not, better than you can in any other&#xD;
"Be it so; I am going to the ' Silver Bell,'&#xD;
ad will *illingly be yourzguide."-&#xD;
SLesa4.on," said the young man, and the&#xD;
twe '   away tegather.&#xD;
. "II' would be: euve nient, if nothing more,&#xD;
to          larunetaddress you ?" con-&#xD;
tinued the stranger, pausing.&#xD;
&#xD;
The young man hesitated a moment.&#xD;
" If you should ever have occasion to want a&#xD;
name to address me by, call me Albert'&#xD;
Casside."&#xD;
"And to be equally civil, I will inform you&#xD;
that I will not be offended if you should call&#xD;
me at any time Denis Wetzel."&#xD;
While these two personages are in -search of&#xD;
the "Silver Bell," we will attempt to give&#xD;
some description of them.  .&#xD;
The young man who had given his name as&#xD;
Albert Casside, was apparently but little past&#xD;
twenty years of age. He had evidently attain-&#xD;
ed the full stature of manhood, as his goodly&#xD;
height and well-developed limbs could testify.&#xD;
Nature haby no means been niggardly in her&#xD;
endowments, in regard to personal advantages,&#xD;
although his dress was not such as to set them&#xD;
off in the most happy manner ; he being clad in&#xD;
the habiliments of the common people, accord-&#xD;
ing to the style of the time of Edward the&#xD;
second, who was then king of England. At.&#xD;
his side the young man wore a sword that did&#xD;
not seem in keeping with his russet freekt it&#xD;
being elaborately ornamented, and heavily&#xD;
mounted with silver.&#xD;
The persotiage who had so unceremoniously.&#xD;
addressed our hero, was probably' past thirty, of&#xD;
a bold and reckless bearing, joined to a sort of&#xD;
good-natured and rather obtrusive- familiarity,&#xD;
that was not exactly consonant with, the feel-&#xD;
ings of Casside, who did not relish the-idea of&#xD;
being addressed as a mere- lad, without expe-&#xD;
rience or spirit.  Whatever his lifer and history&#xD;
might. have been, it was obvious that he meant&#xD;
to keep it secret, inasmuch as he believed-, nah&#xD;
matters concerned only hiniaelf. -Whop ,enis&#xD;
Wetzel was, or for what object he was dsi msL&#xD;
of making his acquaintance,, he was s b1lysely&#xD;
indifferent; for he had reached a crisis i 1s&#xD;
existence when ordinary -occurrences. coRi4 flt&#xD;
easily attract much of- his attention; QCady&#xD;
appeared'to be in a transition st e, and anx$ p&#xD;

the arrival of two persons, who seemed to be&#xD;
men of rank, although both were plainly clad&#xD;
and wore no badges to denote their degree.&#xD;

younger, and could not have numbered more&#xD;

abeommodation. He was endeavoring to com-&#xD;
pose himself to slumber', when he was. aroused&#xD;
by a gentle knocking upon his door. Without&#xD;
hesitation he arose and opened it, and much to&#xD;
his surprise beheld Strolling Willie.&#xD;
"Hush ! speak not a.word I" said tihe latter,&#xD;
in' a whisper, laying his finger upon his lips.&#xD;
Impressed with the mysterious manner of the&#xD;
beggar, Casside allowed him to enter his room&#xD;
and to close the door.&#xD;
"Now, my good man, what do you want?"&#xD;
asked our hero.&#xD;
" I told you, young gallant, that it might&#xD;
come to pass, in the order of Providence, that a&#xD;
poor blind man might have it in his power to&#xD;
do you a service ; it has happened so, much&#xD;
sooner than I expected," replied the beggar.&#xD;
"Proceed with your story," said Albert.&#xD;
"When I had finished the ale and despatch-&#xD;
edthe food which your kindness procured for&#xD;
me, I left the tap-room and groped my way to&#xD;
the stable where the horses of travellers are&#xD;
kept. Thanking heaven that I was so well&#xD;
provided for, I threw myself upon some straw,&#xD;
and should soon have been asleep, had not two&#xD;
persons entered the stable and began talking in&#xD;
low tones. One, of them I knew by his voice&#xD;
to be the host ; but the other I knew nothing&#xD;
about.. I soon discovered that they were plan-&#xD;
ning a robbery, and that you were to be the,&#xD;
victim. Capet affirmed that he knew you had&#xD;
money, for he listened at the door and heard&#xD;
you counting it. They then arranged the de-&#xD;
fails of the operation. It appears that there&#xD;
is a private entrance by which they intend to&#xD;
enter your room, about midnight, when you&#xD;
will be most likely to be asleep."&#xD;
'Let them  come," said the young man,&#xD;
grasping his sword.  "Let them come ; I will&#xD;
be ready for them."&#xD;
Capet will not come, but his accomplice.&#xD;
But I have not told all. In the morning when&#xD;
you go to settle your reckoning, and discover&#xD;
your loss, mine host will feign to be greatly ex-&#xD;
asperated and say it is a trick to cheat him out&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
of, his just dues ; thereupon , the servants will&#xD;
unceremoniously thrust you out of doors."&#xD;
"The villain !" exelaimned (Jasside.&#xD;
"If you will take the adviceof a blind bed&#xD;
gar, you will let them rob you."&#xD;
" That's blind advice, truly !" replied Cas&#xD;
side, with a smile.&#xD;
"I will explain; take the gold and silver&#xD;
from your purse and fill it with copper coin like&#xD;
this I have in my pocket," resumed Strolling&#xD;
Willie, producing a handful of copper edin9&#xD;
" All this trashy stuff'-does notianiount to the.&#xD;
value of half a crown. When your putsei&#xD;
filled with it, lay it on the table, and go toed&#xD;
and to sleep.&#xD;
" I like the idea very well," returned Albert.&#xD;
"But I think it would be best to put in a few&#xD;
small silver pieces."&#xD;
"Not a single piece !" said Willie ; "because'&#xD;
you wish their disappointment to be as great as&#xD;
possible."&#xD;
The young man immediately proceeded' to&#xD;
empty his purse and fill it with the compare&#xD;
tively useless coins, which the beggar had  re&#xD;
ecived at different times from the hand of stinted&#xD;
charity.&#xD;
"We who subsist upon the benevolence of&#xD;
others seldom feel the touch of silver," said the&#xD;
stroller.&#xD;
"Selfishness has outgrown charity," replied&#xD;
Albert.&#xD;
" Good reason have I to know it. Now lay&#xD;
your purse upon -the table and go to bed unohobi1&#xD;
cernedly."&#xD;
"What will you do ?"&#xD;
" Go back as I came."&#xD;
" But it perplexes me much to'know how you&#xD;
can go about from place to  place with su'h&#xD;
facility, your eyes being, as you say, entirely'&#xD;
sightless."&#xD;
"You must know, my young friend, that&#xD;
when nature takes away one faculty, she gives.&#xD;
another to supply,_in some measure, its place; "&#xD;
answered strolling Willie.&#xD;
"There is some wisdom in that observation,"&#xD;
said Casside.&#xD;

Ican do many things, which some persons&#xD;
who profess to have better sight than myself,&#xD;
cannot do. Ah, sir, nature is not always in the&#xD;
wrong ;, she is not always, a hard mistress.&#xD;
My sense of hearing and of touch is strangely&#xD;
acute ;, I can hear sounds to which common ears&#xD;
are deaf, and take impressions of objects around&#xD;
me before other eyes have seen them. I go by&#xD;

for me, if that be' the case," replied Albert.&#xD;

being seen."&#xD;
"Never fear, sir ; I can grope about strange-&#xD;

" Go, if you will; but be sure that you do&#xD;
not leave the inn till you see me again," rejoin-&#xD;
ed Oasside.&#xD;
The mendicant, opened the door gently,'lis-&#xD;
tened a moment, and then making a parting&#xD;
gesture to Albert, passed out and closed it after&#xD;
his.  Our hero replaced the chairs, and pre-&#xD;
sently retired as directed by the stroller. But&#xD;
he was not destined to sink immediately to&#xD;
sleep, even had his mind been in a condition&#xD;
calm enough to do so. Added. to the weight of&#xD;
anxiety that preyedupon his spirits, and the&#xD;
incidents of the evening, were the sound of&#xD;
voices in an adjoining room.  Those sounds had&#xD;
been but indistinctly heard while he sat by the&#xD;
table, but the moment his head pressed the&#xD;
pillow, they fell with greater clearness upon his&#xD;
qars-; which circumstance'was partly accounted&#xD;
for by the fact that he was considerably nearer&#xD;
the wall that separated his room from the ad-&#xD;
1iuing one, than in his former position.&#xD;
Oasside strove to shut out the murmur of voices,&#xD;
forget his cares, and soothe his perturbed mind&#xD;
to a state of slumber ; but the increasing earn-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SILVER, BELL.;&#xD;
&#xD;
estness of the conversation carried on within a,&#xD;
few feet of him -by the knownn persons,,effec-&#xD;
tually kept him awake. He had no diilculty&#xD;
in understanding that the, individuals whose&#xD;
voices he heard were those who had recently,&#xD;
arrived at the inn'.&#xD;
"It was a daring affair," said one, whose,&#xD;
voice Albert recognized as that of the younger&#xD;
of the two, it being much less heavy than that,&#xD;
of his companion.&#xD;
"Most daring," replied the other.&#xD;
"What can be done ?" continued the first.&#xD;
"'That's the question to be decided. We&#xD;
will keep our secret for the present, at all&#xD;
events. I see no good that can result from&#xD;
making ourloss known. If this adventure does&#xD;
not hasten the fall of Mark Donhead, I am no&#xD;
great reader of destiny," added the eldest of&#xD;
two.&#xD;
" We shall have good reason to remember&#xD;
the Donhead Wood."&#xD;
"To the dayof our death."&#xD;
"The villains were bold, uncle."&#xD;
"Had we met the rogues armed in proof,&#xD;
and with lances in rest, we could ha e scattered&#xD;
them like chaff. By St. John ! I long to have&#xD;
a dash at the banditti of Donhead Wood !"&#xD;
"They may be but common people, and un-&#xD;
worthy of your arms, uncle."&#xD;
"Gentle or simple, I care not, nephew; I&#xD;
would not hesitate to chastise them could I be&#xD;
placed face to face with them, armed as beseem-&#xD;
eth a knight.  I do not mind so much the loss&#xD;
of a few florins, as' I am angered at the audacity&#xD;
of the villains who took them. It grieves me&#xD;
that half-a-dozen cross bowmen should rob two&#xD;
knights of known ability."&#xD;
"Yes, I see where the shoe pinches, uncle,&#xD;
and feel the same soreness myself. It will be,&#xD;
best, I think, to send a trusty messenger to:---"&#xD;
here the young knight-lowered his voice so much&#xD;
that Casside could not hear what place was&#xD;
mentioned : but he instantly resumed as before,&#xD;
"with an order for money, and a score of men-&#xD;
at-arms."&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
"There niight be rare recreation in a hunt&#xD;
through Donhead Wood, nephew, I       rant.&#xD;
The suggestion is worthy of consideration ; but&#xD;
we .must strictly observe our incognito."&#xD;
"True, uncle, that important secret must be&#xD;
well preserved, for in these days' it is difficult&#xD;
to know our' friends from our foes. . My head&#xD;

" No doubt, nephew, and when your wild&#xD;
oats are scattered with a liberal hand all over&#xD;
England, you will become a pattern of gravity&#xD;

sipping their wine when we entered ?"&#xD;
"I saw them."&#xD;
"I liked not their looks," added the young .&#xD;
man, "especially the more youthful looking of&#xD;
the pair."&#xD;
" And but little does he care whether you&#xD;
like his looks or not," remarked Albert to him-&#xD;

into a-deep sleep, from which he did not awake&#xD;
until the bright sunlight was streaming cheer-&#xD;
fully into his room, in the morning.&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
IsANDRA.  WEIRD ELE.&#xD;
&#xD;
N the day following the events already&#xD;
narrated, a young girl of about sixteen&#xD;
years, accompanied by a lad of twelve, might&#xD;
have been seen in one of the rural districts near&#xD;
Mt. Palladore. - The latter carried a shepherd's&#xD;
crook in his hand, and both were attired after&#xD;
the fashion of the peasantry, according to the&#xD;
prevailing custom of the times.&#xD;
The soft airs of morning fanned the brows of&#xD;
the young girl, and the pleasant rays of a cloud-&#xD;
less sun danced along the grassy way at her&#xD;
feet. . The expanding flowers smiled in the&#xD;
gladdening light, and joyous birds, flitting from&#xD;
bower to bower, warbled their sweetest notes.&#xD;
Upon the verdant side of a hill of gentle&#xD;
aseant contented flocks of sheep were feeding,&#xD;
and sportive lambs cheered the eyes of the be-&#xD;
holders with their innocent gambols. A little&#xD;
to the left of the hill the waters of the Stour&#xD;
could be seen wandering on -towards their final&#xD;
destination-the sea.&#xD;
Come, Isandra; let us sit upon this green&#xD;
bank of earth, and rest," said the lad.&#xD;
With a gentle smile, Isandra seated herself&#xD;
beside the youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have been thinking of late that I should&#xD;
like to be rich," added the latter.&#xD;
"Why should you like to be rich, Louis ?"&#xD;
"For several reasons," replied the lad. "If&#xD;
I were rich I would give you money, and make&#xD;
a fine lady of you. To be plain with 'you, sis-&#xD;
ter, you seem too fair and delicate to work with&#xD;
your' hands as the neighboring girls do."&#xD;
"Labor is not degrading, brother Louis."&#xD;
"Perhaps not, in the sight of God, but it is&#xD;
in the sight of our wealthy neighbors. The&#xD;
noble lords and ladies that we often see gal-&#xD;
lantly mounted, sweeping past us, regard us as&#xD;
the dust beneath their feet. And yet, Isandra,&#xD;
in beauty of face and figure, you are not a whit&#xD;
behind the fairest damsel I have ever seen."&#xD;
"Do you know, good brother Louis, that&#xD;
your love for me has made me appear to'pos-&#xD;
sess all those qualities which you name&amp;amp;":Any&#xD;
object that we love seems fair to our partial&#xD;
judgments."&#xD;
"It may be so in many eases; but in this&#xD;
particular instance, I have excellent reasons for&#xD;
believing as I do; for all the young fellows&#xD;
within half-a-dozen miles are in love with you."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am not -so vainl as to credit that tale,"-&#xD;
said Isandra, blushing.&#xD;
"That strange young gallant, who can talk:&#xD;
O, bravely, and used to come here so- often,&#xD;
once declared in my hearing, that your beauty&#xD;
atonished him and made him forget every-&#xD;
thing else.",&#xD;
Isandra made no reply, but played with the&#xD;
pet lamb that had nestled down beside her.&#xD;
" I think that young man acted strangely ;&#xD;
and I have sometimes imagined that he was&#xD;
really some nobleman's son in disguise," con-&#xD;
tinued Louis.&#xD;
" What an absurd idea r" rejoined Isandra.&#xD;
"Father told me the  mne when I said I&#xD;
should like to be a page to some brave knight."&#xD;
"And finally become a knight yourself 1"&#xD;
added the young girl, soiiling at the earnestness&#xD;
offthe lad.&#xD;
"You have guessed it," reirned Louis,&#xD;
"Yo would be much happier; tending yon-&#xD;
der flock," resumed Isandra. "But who comes&#xD;
hither ?""&#xD;
"Sonie wandering sibyl, I trow."&#xD;
" Ah, that's lucky ! we'll have our fortunes&#xD;
told; these: old' wives have strange gifts," said&#xD;
Louis, eagerly.&#xD;
"They are mere   pretenders ; they know&#xD;
nothing of the future ; the future is a sealed&#xD;
book which mortals cannot read."&#xD;
"That will do veryawell to say to keep up&#xD;
appearances, and sustain a reputation for wis-&#xD;
d©ig ;but come to the case in hand, all lilke to&#xD;
dabble in these matters--gentle as well as&#xD;
einple."     .&#xD;
While the .girl and the youth were speaking,&#xD;
the personage referred to was fast approaching.&#xD;
She was of gasulne height, dark-skinned,&#xD;
wriled and bony: She wore a long garment,&#xD;
something like the" domino of a monk. Her&#xD;
head was destitute of any  onering save, that,&#xD;
whish nature had bestowed -fthick giowth of&#xD;
shorbceitsi, black hair. In her right hand&#xD;
lhekenid 'aatick of goodl ength, budtshether&#xD;

ing, wae.a matter of som   8.bt.&#xD;
The old woman drew near andwtho&#xD;
&#xD;
parently leig ing to notice Isandra and Louis,&#xD;
seated herself ezantly opposite them under the&#xD;
shadow of.some spreading trees.&#xD;
"Are you weary, good mother ?" inquired&#xD;
Louis.&#xD;
"I have beeifweary many years, my son,"&#xD;
returned the woman, quickly.&#xD;
"You look.strong and well. I dare say you&#xD;
have walked over a great part of England sines&#xD;
yo u were young'?'&#xD;
"-Walked # how- could  I help walking '&#xD;
What else could I do but walk ? Walking is&#xD;
the only relief for the miserable who wish to&#xD;
die, but cannot."&#xD;
"Then- you have been miserable ?"&#xD;
"Look at nme andges! Do I look like a-&#xD;
happy person ? ha, ha !"&#xD;
-You   don't look  just right," returned&#xD;
Louis.&#xD;
" Doubtless you have uttered your prophe.'&#xD;
cies in a great many places, and to many  r&#xD;
auditors ?" said'Isandra, sailirig.&#xD;
"Prophecies? yes, miss, and many a tite&#xD;
prophecy have I uttered ; it is a gift I've had&#xD;
for many a long year."&#xD;
I never thought the future could be°op'ed&#xD;
to the goze of mortals. - There is too much&#xD;
mystery about your trade for it to be true."&#xD;
" Nature is full of mystery !" exclainnedthe&#xD;
sibyl, bending towards Isandra and elevating&#xD;
the left-hand. "'There is mystery in the wihd,&#xD;
and in the rain; there is mystery in the thun-&#xD;
der, and in the sheeted lightning ; there is mys-&#xD;
tery in the wild hurricane, and in the deep&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
THE KNIGHT. THE RENCONTRE.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE individuals referred to were on horse-&#xD;
back, and turning somewhat from their&#xD;
way they drew near to Albert and Isandra.&#xD;
The person who rode in advance appeared to&#xD;
be a knight of some consequence ; and a little&#xD;
in the rear followed his squire, bearing his armor&#xD;
and his lance.     c&#xD;
"He sits well in his saddle, but methinks he&#xD;
carrieth himself proudly," observed Casside, to&#xD;
his fair companion.&#xD;
Louis, who had returned from looking-after&#xD;
his flock, regarded the approach of the knight&#xD;
with enthusiastic interest.&#xD;
"You are thinking of the spurs that Weird&#xD;
lsie promised you?" said Isandra, playfully ;&#xD;
but the mind of the youth was so much pre.&#xD;
occupied with his own thoughts, that he made&#xD;
no rejoinder to the gentle sarcasm of his sister.&#xD;
Has he the promise of knighthood ?'' asked&#xD;
Albert, smiling pensively as he looked at the&#xD;
thoughtful countenance of the lad.&#xD;
" He bath indeed," she replied.&#xD;
"A.a much as you have the promise of being&#xD;
a fine lady I" retorted Louis.&#xD;
the rustic maiden blushed deeply at this re.&#xD;
&#xD;
joinder, and said quickly in reply to the inquir.&#xD;
ing looks of Albert:&#xD;
"The idle tales of a strolling prophetess-.&#xD;
Weird Elsie."&#xD;
By this time the knight had reached the spot&#xD;
where the parties stood. He was, apparently,&#xD;
near the age of Casside, and about the same&#xD;
size, with the exception, perhaps, tgat he was&#xD;
somewhat more slightly formed, lacking the full&#xD;
development of muscle that characterized our&#xD;
hero. He was richly attired, and judging by&#xD;
his haughty air, seemed to attach no diminutive&#xD;
idea to his own importance.&#xD;
" Good youth," he said, addressing Albert;&#xD;
"can you direct me the way to Motcombe&#xD;
Manor ?"&#xD;
" Return to the road you have left, and ygn&#xD;
cannot fail to find what you seek," answered&#xD;
Casside.&#xD;
" Ah, what have we here ?" exclaimed the&#xD;
cavalier, as his eyes rested upon the face of&#xD;
Isandra.&#xD;
" Nothing that need attract the attention of&#xD;
a courteous knight," added Albert..&#xD;
" Be quiet, simple youth i" said the knight,&#xD;

with a frown.  "Upon my knightly honor,&#xD;
here is rare beauty," he resumed. "Here is&#xD;
a pretty flower shedding its fragrance upon ill-&#xD;
mannered clowns. Come, fair shepherdess,&#xD;
what may I call you?"&#xD;
Isandra turned towards Louis and made no&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"Both fair and modest," added the cavalier,&#xD;
with a laugh.&#xD;
"Sir knight, resume your journey and leave&#xD;
us, simple people, to our own enjoyments," said&#xD;
Casside.&#xD;
"Silence, bold varlet !" cried the cavalier,&#xD;
"It pleaseth me to talk with the maiden, and&#xD;
the matter concerneth you not. Think yourself&#xD;
lucky, if you escape without personal chastise.,&#xD;
ment. Now, sweet shepherdess, let me hear&#xD;
thy voice ; I would know if it be as sweet as&#xD;
thy looks."&#xD;
"Let us leave this spot,", said Albert, ad-&#xD;
dressing Isandra.&#xD;
.I must chastise this insolent hind !" ex-&#xD;
elaimea the knight, unsheathing his sword and&#xD;
urging.his horse to. the side of .Albert.  "I&#xD;
cannot disgrace this good weapon by shedding&#xD;
thy  as. b9rn blood, but according to knightly&#xD;
I may trike such as thee with anything&#xD;
~hiits age:.'&#xD;
The   'iht lifted his sword torput his threat&#xD;
'}-to eec  on,' but quick se thoughh, Casside&#xD;
snY1"a i the shepherd's crook from the hand of&#xD;
Louis";for he had left his own weapon'at the&#xD;
'S1ver Bell), nd armed him in a moment.&#xD;
Ahe cavalier grew red with shame and vexation,&#xD;
andcalled to his squire to bring him his lance'&#xD;
that he  eight beat the audacious peasant with&#xD;
'its}stoul ashen handle ;but in this he was no&#xD;
ore successful than in. the first. atteii; our&#xD;
quickly knocked the weapon from his grasp,&#xD;
and gave him a staggering blow upon'the head.&#xD;
The knight was now ready to choke with in-&#xD;
aon; for a  ilr from a simple peasant he&#xD;
considered a foulaffront.&#xD;
Lend me your sword, my friend, and I&#xD;
si anexapl          f iis Yello  ' he said to&#xD;
{s sc yuir  di aveice hoarsewith pasio.&#xD;
emember, my iord, that it  tarnish&#xD;
&#xD;
the memory of your gallant deeds, if you shed,&#xD;
the blood of this peasant."&#xD;
"I care not-I care not !" he cried, leaping&#xD;
from his horse. The squire gave him his sword&#xD;
as desired, and Albert availed himself of the one&#xD;
which was lying upon the ground.&#xD;
Isandra stood pale and mute with fear, while&#xD;
Casside awaited calmly the attack ,of the en-&#xD;
raged cavalier, who was anticipating an easy&#xD;
and speedy victory. . But he was doomed to a&#xD;
bitter disappointment.  Our hero met his furi-&#xD;
ous onset with skill and Coolness, baffling all&#xD;
his mad efforts to give him a mortal thrust.&#xD;
The squire watched the progress of the contest&#xD;
with undisguised wonder. '&#xD;
" The fellow has used that weapon before I"&#xD;
he muttered.  " He handles it well-admirably,&#xD;
toowell for my lord's good."&#xD;
The countenance of Cassife during the con-&#xD;
test. wore a calm and contemptuous smile. At&#xD;
first he acted only on the defensive, and seem-&#xD;
ed greatly to enjoy the disappointment .ad&#xD;
Impotent chafings of his antagonist ; bid at&#xD;
length, he began to act on the offensive, and&#xD;
before ten seconds had elapsed, again'disarmed&#xD;
his assailant&#xD;
ouare at ny mercy," said, Casside, plac-&#xD;
ing the point of his sword to his breast; " but&#xD;
I give you your life without the asking, go,&#xD;
anc in f ure be more courteous to strangers."&#xD;
"Mount, and let u be off, in the virgin's&#xD;
name I you can' perhaps settle this materat&#xD;
somefuture time, for I doubt not you will ag&#xD;
hear of this person !" exclaimed the squire.&#xD;
The knight got on'horseback withoutword&#xD;
of reply.  Albert gave the sword to Louis, who&#xD;
handed it to the squire, with':the lance. The&#xD;
cavaliers then moved away, and as thes-uire&#xD;
assed   sside,'he said in a lowvoice.&#xD;
"Young man, you have done a foolhrly&#xD;

&#xD;
That was gallantly, doie g'. i 'Luis,&#xD;
whose respect for Albert had greatly increased&#xD;
during the last few moments.&#xD;
'"TUnlusky hour! unfortunate event ! you&#xD;
have, in protecting me, brought certain destrues&#xD;
tion upon yourself !" exclaimed Isandra.  "Sir&#xD;
Hugh Spencer, I have heard my father say, is&#xD;
venrowerful with'the king."&#xD;
"Fear not," replied Albert; " in protecting&#xD;
you from insult, I would cross swords with the&#xD;
king himself."     .&#xD;
"'My father comes this way; we will hear&#xD;
what his opinion is; whether it 'be indeed so&#xD;
dangerous a thing to disarm an insolent knight,"&#xD;
said'Louis.&#xD;
"Ata;l, middle-aged man, of not very pre-&#xD;
possessing exterior, approached 'the parties. If&#xD;
the'face 'is' an index to the character, a very&#xD;
high +estimate could not be attached to that 'of&#xD;
Peter Vidal, Isandra's father.: Casside had&#xD;
seen him but a few times; and had ever' been&#xD;
favorably impressed with his moral worth ; for&#xD;
sotid avarice was indelibly written upon every&#xD;
feature: He bowed coldly to our hero and lis-&#xD;
tened sullenly to the story of what had just&#xD;
transpired.&#xD;
'" So you have offended the son of Sir Hugh&#xD;
Spencer; young man ?" he said, with a sarcas-&#xD;
tibsmile.  "My fery youth, 'your head isn't&#xD;
worth a' florin.  Sir Hugh Spencer is in reality&#xD;
king of'England, though Edward the second sits&#xD;
upo;the throne."'&#xD;
' Buthe saved me from insult, father," said&#xD;
Isandra, timidly.&#xD;
"That was all 'very well,- and I am  much&#xD;
o)iged to him., ;  hope he will get happily out&#xD;
of the1,unpleasant business. I advise him-to&#xD;
lye 'gland 'as soon as possible.   Come,&#xD;

Vi,.ga&#xD;
Courtesy requires that you should ask ,he&#xD;
young;in to gos with us; he has rendered an&#xD;
important service," whispered Isandra.&#xD;
As if half-ashamed of his ill-nature, Vidal&#xD;
paused ant asked Albert to accompany them;&#xD;
but perceiving that his consent to this proposi-&#xD;
tion was by no means wanted, he prudently with-&#xD;
&#xD;
held it,'and bidding adieu to;Iandra,'walked&#xD;
away towards Donhead Wood.&#xD;
Having entered the forest, te fiat ojeel he&#xD;
beheld. was Denis Wetzel. lHe was. dressed w&#xD;
the same manner as on the previous night, 'S4t&#xD;
a heavy sword hung at his side. He manifested&#xD;
some surprise at seeing Casside, and laughingly&#xD;
inquired if he intended to take up his residence&#xD;
in that dangerous region.&#xD;
Albert replied that he had laid no plans for&#xD;
the future'; that for the present all places were&#xD;
the same to him.&#xD;
"How like you our host of the Silver Bell ?"&#xD;
asked Wetzel.&#xD;
"If I wanted a scoundrel, I should know&#xD;
where to find one," was the reply.&#xD;
"Ah I have you discovered his tricks so soond&#xD;
Strolling Willie cold me there was some cause&#xD;
of offence between you this morning"&#xD;
"He.stole my purse; that was all."'&#xD;
"And you-"&#xD;
"Came very near strangling him."&#xD;
" A resolute youth 1"&#xD;
" Bah ! that is a slight thing."&#xD;
"You suit me better'and bettor."&#xD;
"Well, the good will of 'even Denis- W'etzel&#xD;
may be -preferable to his hatred."&#xD;
" Possibly !" said Wetzel, coloring  and&#xD;
biting his 'lips.&#xD;
 " I wishryou good day," added' Casside,&#xD;
moving away.&#xD;
"Not' so fast, young man ; let us talk over&#xD;
matters that concern us both."'&#xD;
"You can talk of nothing that concern me,&#xD;
certainly,"' returned our hero, somewhat loftily.&#xD;
" Don't be too confident; we;shall see.' I&#xD;
shall have to be plain with you. And in thew&#xD;
first place I must ask if you will keep, forever&#xD;
and a day, what shall passbetweenus here i&#xD;
this forest, a secret ?"&#xD;
"i  have not'the least. objeetioto that," an -&#xD;
swered the young man, -earetlssly.&#xD;
"Very 'well; I will take your word. Be&#xD;

bitterly, feeling for the hilt of his sword ;,na,$&#xD;

28                    THE SILVER BELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
While making this remark, Casside turned&#xD;
the pocket of his doublet wrong side out, and&#xD;
saw his last forin disappear.-&#xD;
"Now I suppose you will allow me to go my,&#xD;
way unmolested ?"&#xD;
The robbers looked at each other, as if to learn&#xD;
what opinions prevailed upon the subject.&#xD;
Those who had received the severest contusions&#xD;
and bruises, appeared by no means disposed to&#xD;
let the author of them depart in peace ; and&#xD;
mildly suggested that it would be 'well to hang&#xD;
him upon the nearest tree. But this proposi-&#xD;
tion was at length overruled by the more humane,&#xD;
and after being thoroughly searched to ascer-&#xD;
tain if there was not more money concealed upon&#xD;
his person, he was sufferedto resume his way&#xD;
towards the Silver Bell.&#xD;
He was shortly after met by Strolling Willie,&#xD;
to whom he related the story of his recent loss.&#xD;
"It no doubt appears a great misfortune to&#xD;
you," said the mendicant; "but I have always&#xD;
noticed that what seem great evils often turn,&#xD;
out to be inestimable blessings."&#xD;
"That's sorry'comfort to one in my condi-&#xD;
tion V'&#xD;
" I know of a monk who can well advise you&#xD;
what to do ; he can, at least, give you shelter,&#xD;
until Providence sends you better luck," added}&#xD;
the stroller.s&#xD;
I shill not ask aline quite yet," replied&#xD;
Casside, raiber hanghtily.&#xD;
"Idid not mean that ; but simply that you&#xD;
should visit'the wise man who can make himself&#xD;
ippy with a erust of bread and a cup of pure&#xD;
'A rare personage !"&#xD;
"*, you4 'ay well say so; there is not&#xD;
another like him in England.  Now give par-&#xD;
ticiilar attention,. and I will direct you how to&#xD;
find him,"&#xD;
To humor the, 'indly disposed beggar, our&#xD;
hereo aitened to his directions, which were some-&#xD;
Wiat complicated ; and to please hlniia-sil far-&#xD;
ther, promised to seek the habitation qf the&#xD;
recluse oinetime during the afternoon.'&#xD;
'Albert then proeeedgd to pe the Silver Bell&#xD;
to get the sword which he had le6t tlere'wlidif&#xD;
&#xD;
he set out on his visit to Isandra Vidal. Joa.&#xD;
chim Capet regarded his guest with anything but&#xD;
friendly looks, and hinted pretty plainly that if&#xD;
he did not see what color his money was soon,&#xD;
it would be highly expedient for him to quit the&#xD;
inn and seek other accommodations. He went&#xD;
on to add thathis was the first instance in which&#xD;
any individual had been. so bold as to complain&#xD;
of losing a purse at the Silver Bell.&#xD;
Casside's blood began to boil with vexation,&#xD;
and seizing mine host by the nape of the neck,&#xD;
he belabored him soundly ; which event pro-&#xD;
duced a great disturbance in the hitherto quiet&#xD;
precincts of the country inn ; but the employ-&#xD;
ment afforded our hero the liveliest satisfaction&#xD;
he had experienced for a long time. In the&#xD;
midst of the excitement he pitched Capet with&#xD;
not gentle hand among a quantity of empty&#xD;
bottles, and bid a hasty adieu to the Silver&#xD;
Bell.&#xD;
He wandered about for some time without&#xD;
any fixed object, being, in fact, in a complete&#xD;
state of indecision. At length happening toile&#xD;
some of the landmarks which the -stroller had&#xD;
mentioned as guides to the resident' of the,&#xD;
monk, he mechanically directed hisstepsyto the'&#xD;
spot ; not indeed expecting any benefit, but"&#xD;
merely because he knew not what elseIto-do.,&#xD;
After he had-walked what appeared to bim T&#xD;
long distance, he Was ready to reproach hinmO&#xD;
that he had suffered the words of the' mendicant&#xD;
to make a sufficient iapressionrupon hisJinind&#xD;
to. think of them the 'second time. Soehe re,&#xD;
solved not to see the monk, although he was&#xD;
aware that he could not be far distantifroni'his'&#xD;
habitation. '&#xD;
But thetimeemployed in foming this reso-&#xD;
lution was'lost; a man who pioed' io bethe&#xD;
monk Datid, was already near hini, eld'f'ith&#xD;
all the simplicity of hia calling.   "  :o&#xD;
"Whom seek you, young man ?"he asked,&#xD;
looking attentively atAlbert.'       "&#xD;
"The monk David lives somewhere iih66t&#xD;
'here, I believe ? he answered,°evasivelf. '&#xD;
R'4 'tis 'bebib *  yo'" was thea ffe' te&#xD;
reply. "Follo#u  "i."&#xD;
O asside ;'as'4el ve seen, havingnahing,&#xD;
&#xD;
betterIto do, and almost wholly indifferent in&#xD;
regt  t' the tui'aaffairs might 'take, believing&#xD;
that' he had got quite down to the foot: of the&#xD;
ladder of adversity, obeyed the injunction 'of&#xD;
father David, and'followed him -along a narrow&#xD;
foot-path that1wound about in an eccentrieman-&#xD;
ner.  They reached finally the most'lonely part&#xD;
of the forest -that Albert had. seen.  The monk&#xD;
paused before a' rude hut, in 'front of which was&#xD;
a small rivulet.&#xD;
"Here is where I dwell," he said.&#xD;
" A most secluded spot, truly."&#xD;
"It suits my purpose. . The real wants of&#xD;
life are few, and if we are wise, we' can find&#xD;
them  anywhere.   Nature  supplies me with-&#xD;
water at small cost, you see, and my hut is :more.&#xD;
capacious than it seems. Let us enter."&#xD;
There was nothing very striking or worthy of&#xD;
much description in the hut of father David.&#xD;
It was indeed much more capacious than its&#xD;
exterior indicated; a liberal excavation having&#xD;
been made in the rear, forming a room of non:=&#xD;
siderable: size,, so that the 'dwelling was coin-&#xD;
posed hf two 'apartments, besides a small oratory,&#xD;
orwhat 'subserved that purpose.&#xD;
" Now, young'man, what' is your object in&#xD;
seeking me ?" asked David.&#xD;
Casside replied that he had'no particular ob-&#xD;
ject in view, other than to gratify the whim of&#xD;
a mendicant, who was desirous to-do him some&#xD;
kindness out of' gratitude for sane trifling ser-&#xD;
viee he had rendered him;, a serviceby the&#xD;
way, not worth mentioning.&#xD;
' Ihave seen the stroller since he gave you'&#xD;
tliat' advice. He has told me all he knew of&#xD;
yeu-eisfortones."        '&#xD;
"He is ea' singular old creature; for I could&#xD;
net'ilndmy way here' with both eyes open,&#xD;
while he is deprived of the blessing' of sight&#xD;
etitirely,"remnarked{Albert.&#xD;
Fatherz3avid proceeded to clear his throat&#xD;
by's ra; preliminaryahems;' but what pro-&#xD;
fud wisdom .he was *about to butter, is: not&#xD;
no* kiown, for 'a gentle knQeking upon the&#xD;
d  rof'his  hut put an end to the contermplated-&#xD;
The monk arose quickly in -some eonfuieon,&#xD;
&#xD;
and hastily opening the little 'door that'ld4t&#xD;
the apartment in the rear, he bade Albert etr'&#xD;
and remain silent until the newcomer should'&#xD;
be disposed of.  Our hero passed into-the room'&#xD;
(which' was quite dark, 'havingmorethe appeal&#xD;
ance of a cellar than of a habitable place); aan&#xD;
the door was closed and fastened' upon him.&#xD;
He,seated himself upon a block of wood, to&#xD;
await the result, with the same feeling'of'in-c&#xD;
difference that had characterized all hismnio e-&#xD;
ments for the"last four-and-twenty hours. :He&#xD;
heard the outer 'door of the hut opened, an&#xD;
after a few words were exchanged, some peroa&#xD;
was admitted. Presently, Casside heard the'&#xD;
low tones of a- female vice, or such it appeared&#xD;
to him ; and his curiosity.began to get the bet;&#xD;
ter of his indifference. A female in the hut of&#xD;
the monk 1' What' possible motive could bring&#xD;
her to such -a solitary place ?2. Here was food&#xD;
for curiosity, and Albert resolved to gratify his,&#xD;
if practicable. He placed his ear close to the&#xD;
rough wall and heard a voice that made him&#xD;
start with unfeigned surprise. Could it be pos-&#xD;
sible that Isandra Vidal was there?  le. would&#xD;
listen again. He did so apd the conviction'that&#xD;
forced itself upon :his mind, was the same. He&#xD;
next proceeded to search for a crevice by which&#xD;
he might gratify the eye as well- as the ear.&#xD;
He found a small one without difficulty, and&#xD;
the subject was no longer one of doubt. Isandra&#xD;
Vidal was indeed in earnest conversation with&#xD;
the monk-a circumstance which filled Albert's&#xD;
mind with the most singular and uncomfortable&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;
'Although ; he could not obtain a full view of&#xD;
her face, it was evident enough that she-was,&#xD;

Casside turned and looked fully ,at Davi4.&#xD;
S" I have," he rejoined, emphatically.&#xD;
" Whatsaid he'?" resume the monk, hur-.&#xD;
riedly.&#xD;
" Much that was vilanous."&#xD;
"I can guess ; he wished you to join the free&#xD;
companions of Mark ponhead ?"1&#xD;
'"That is true.":&#xD;
" And you must coanply," added David,&#xD;
quickly..&#xD;
" What;do you say !" cried Casside, angrily.&#xD;
' That you must accede to his wishes," said&#xD;
the monk, in the same tone.&#xD;
"Your sacred profession alone hinders ,me&#xD;

Albert, sternly.                          .&#xD;

eyes dilated with amazement.&#xD;
" Even so; my son."&#xD;
"Then her situation is indeed terrible!this&#xD;
man's power is felt and feared all overthe&#xD;
country."&#xD;

" I admire your free and generous self-&#xD;
devotion.  Isandra Vidal, though the child of a&#xD;
peasant, is worthy of your efforts. Donhead is&#xD;
anxious to consummate this monstrous union,&#xD;

the sacrifice, for I can call it nothing else, are&#xD;
already agreed upon, and will be carried out,&#xD;

her feeble will to the might of the famous ban-&#xD;

THE CAVE O THE BANDITTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
T JRE sober gray of evening twilight came&#xD;
stealing over Donhead Wood.    Albert&#xD;
Casside stood leaning against a huge fragment&#xD;
of rock that had, in other ages, been burst&#xD;
asunder by some strange convulsion of nature.&#xD;
Not far from him, the figure of Denis Wetzel&#xD;
stood pictured in the deepening gloom.&#xD;
"Some hours have passed since we met; tell&#xD;
me if you are less scrupulous than then?" said&#xD;
the latter..&#xD;
"I am," answered Albert, coldly.&#xD;
"That is well; I knew that reflection would&#xD;
cool your chivalric attachment to what people&#xD;
call honor," added ;Denis.&#xD;
"Circumstances have had more to do with&#xD;
it than reflection. I have been robbed of all&#xD;
the money I could call my own in the wide&#xD;
world."&#xD;
" Bobbed,, say you ?"&#xD;
" Of the last florin ; but some of the knaves&#xD;
of Mark Donhea4, I trow, have got such bruises&#xD;
as will make them remember me for along time&#xD;
to come."&#xD;
" Did you resist ?" asked Wetzel, earnestly.&#xD;
"Rust I I knocked them   over as I would&#xD;
&#xD;
'&#xD;
t.&#xD;
&#xD;
so many wooden saints. And I wish to impress&#xD;
this fact upon your mind, that you may remem-&#xD;
ber it as long as you happen to know me, that&#xD;
I always resist every species of injustice. - Na-&#xD;
ture has given me two strong arms, and it is&#xD;
my established principle, to use them just as&#xD;
often asT am the, object of a wrong of any&#xD;
kind."&#xD;
"Bravo ! you will do for Mark. But I warn&#xD;
you to give him no offence, which your aptness&#xD;
at the game of hard knocks might perhaps&#xD;
quickly lead you to do. He is rather hasty in&#xD;
his temper, and absolute among his men.  If&#xD;
at any time he should give you a blow-"&#xD;
"A blow, you knave ! I'd strike him dead&#xD;
on the spot I" cried Casside, drawingshis sword&#xD;
and springing towards Wetzel.&#xD;
The latter did not change his position, but&#xD;
stood before Albert with as much tranquillity as&#xD;
hitherto:&#xD;
"I did but joke, young man ; put up your&#xD;
sword. If you conclude to have your name writ-&#xD;
ten in the compact of the free companions, ye&#xD;
will have pra6tice enough, without being obliged&#xD;
to pick quarrels withtyour friends. Is your&#xD;

''have determined to offer my services'to&#xD;
A' k1)onhead.    Now I speak plainly, and you&#xD;
will need to questions' no farther'on the sub-&#xD;
ject. Proceed at once to inform me what I an&#xD;
to do to be initiated into this celebrated company&#xD;
oftbanditti ?"&#xD;
' Yoti straight-forwardness is commendable.&#xD;
e initiation is such as becomes brave spirits;&#xD;
brut cowards shrink from it. It  ' 1 be well for&#xD;
you to know  before you go farthe\' that those&#xD;
who oncejoin this brotherhood, 'are never at&#xD;

peace; once enrolled, enrolled forever and a&#xD;
' **etze*"paused, and then added s1wly and&#xD;
emphatically,.looking steadily at Casside. A" We&#xD;
punish traitors with death /"&#xD;
"You, then, belong to the band?" said&#xD;
Albert."&#xD;
I do," returned'Denis, promptly.,&#xD;
"I trust, then, that you' will do me"the honor&#xD;
to conduct nie to theta presence of Mark bon-&#xD;
head."&#xD;
' fyou once enter the secret abode of the&#xD;
banditti, you cannot leave' it until ;you'go forth&#xD;

DO you comprehend ?"&#xD;
" Most perfectly ; lead on, I follow you to&#xD;
telhauait of-the redoubtable brigand."&#xD;
""iis settled-=this way-and be patient,"&#xD;
returned the bandit.&#xD;
Casside abyIdoned'himself'to the guidance of&#xD;

that might affect his whole future life and 'yet&#xD;
lie Miowed Denis calily.  ie W*as aware-'that&#xD;

&#xD;
daring:with scarcely i 'iidening of the&#xD;
Evenwiti' his present feelhig, he woulidske&#xD;

'But' the object which he -now had in l'i e&#xD;
overcame all other considerations, and ;"mkde&#xD;

Isandra, and a high chivalric' feeling which  r&#xD;
prompted him to befriend the weak a nd 'hal-&#xD;
less, he devoted-himself fully and completely to&#xD;
this now enterprise.&#xD;
Denis Wetzel moved steadily on, making&#xD;
numberless eccentric windings' and turnings,&#xD;
until Albert believed that it would have'been&#xD;
quite impossible for him to have found his 'way,&#xD;
unguided, to the Silver Bell, or to the hnt  of&#xD;
the monk. lHe employed his mind during the&#xD;
long and silent walk in maturing the plans of&#xD;
father David. The latter he believed could be&#xD;
fully trusted, for ha could conceive of no psei-&#xD;
ble motive that he~ould have for betraying'himk,&#xD;
or exposing him to'daager and death. He-'felt'&#xD;
sure that:Strolling Willie was, or meant tobe,&#xD;
his friehd. And here he could not help asking&#xD;
himself if he"'%hid indeed reached that condition,&#xD;
when he was to find'lys friends in the lnoVtt&#xD;
walks-of life. For a moment the thought) an-&#xD;
noyed him, but his'; better nature'soon banihed&#xD;

Wetzel, who had hitherto walked on without&#xD;
uttering a word; now stopped and remarked'that&#xD;
there VA'e yet time for him to go back, if hfbelt&#xD;
any regrets or misgivings. " Our hero' motioned&#xD;
him to proceed,'and Denis oantinued'to leadste&#xD;

There was such a saucy leer upon the fellow's&#xD;
face, when he communicated this piece of in-&#xD;
telligence, that Casside could not well resist the&#xD;
temptation of doing him  personal violence;&#xD;
thereupon, incontinently doubling his fist, he&#xD;
placed a blow upon the frontispiece of the ban-&#xD;
dit, just above the bridge of the nose, that caused&#xD;
him to change the vertical for the horizontal&#xD;
position, and to see all' kinds of electric lights,&#xD;
and stars that danced about eccentrically, and&#xD;
couldn't keep still.&#xD;
" Tell your master that it is thus I always&#xD;
punish impertinence, and resist wrong," said&#xD;
Albert, when the fellow began to show signs of&#xD;
recovering the position most natural to human&#xD;
bipeds.&#xD;
When he had succeeded in regaining his feet,&#xD;
he looked menacingly at the chastiser of his in-&#xD;
solence, and obviously felt a strong desire to&#xD;
retaliate upon him; but observing that he wore&#xD;
a sword, and fearful, doubtless, 'of giving offence&#xD;
to his master, Mark Donhead, his anger found&#xD;
vent in threats and scowls, which were produc-&#xD;
: tive of no great inconvenience or annoyance.&#xD;
S 'e left the premises, muttering that his name&#xD;
&#xD;
s&#xD;
&#xD;
was Dick Strow, and that he never overlooked&#xD;
a blow, but invariably managed to pay up the&#xD;
score, with compound interest.&#xD;
A few moments after the withdrawal of Dick&#xD;
Strow, another of the band made his appearance&#xD;
to inform him that although food was not allow.&#xD;
ed him, wine in any quantity and of the best&#xD;
flavor would- be brought in, if he desired it.&#xD;
Casside signified that it should be produced&#xD;
without delay ; and great was his chagrin when&#xD;
a third knave opened the door and remarked&#xD;
that Mark Donhead did not think it best to ex-&#xD;
cite his mind by stimulants, while he was on&#xD;
the eve of such an important change in his man-&#xD;
ner of life; but the purest water should be&#xD;
brought in its stead.&#xD;
Seizing the block upon which he was sitting,&#xD;
Albert hurled it atthe head of the unfortunate&#xD;
messenger, and taking effect upon his head,&#xD;
stretched him bleeding and insensible upon the&#xD;
earth.&#xD;
The neophyte stepped over the unconscious&#xD;
individual, and proceeded along the great'na-&#xD;
tural corridor, which led he knew not Wither.&#xD;

had seen, depended like enormous icicles from&#xD;
the lofty roof, that gave back the dazzling glare&#xD;
of the lights with extraordinary  effect and&#xD;
brilliancy._&#xD;
Extending through the centre of the saloon,&#xD;
was an ample table, or what answered all the'&#xD;
objects of one, and which was groaning, to use&#xD;
a figure, beneath the weight of the viands placed&#xD;
upon it.  Around this spacious board was seat-&#xD;
ed a motley mass of human beings, whose bois-&#xD;
terous mirth gave proof that they intended to&#xD;
make the most of the present, without trusting&#xD;
anything to the future.  There were among&#xD;
them faces of manly beauty, and visages ren-&#xD;
dered harsh and disgusting, by drunkenness&#xD;
and evil passions.&#xD;
Their drinking cups were just replenished,&#xD;
and they were on the point of conveying them&#xD;
to their lips, when Casside. made his unexpect-&#xD;
ed debut. Every hand seemed paralyzed with&#xD;
surprise, and all eyes were turned towards him&#xD;
with a wondering stare.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Wthoat heeding these indabitable signs of&#xD;
asheihient, our-hbro walked boldly'ip to the&#xD;
t6bl, and reaching over one of the ruisa'&#xD;

then replaced the vessel and took another, in-&#xD;
te*ding that it should follow in the track of the&#xD;

":Blood and fury 1" cried the bandit, whose&#xD;
ine had been appropriated so unceremoniously.&#xD;
"Who is.this audacious varlet '?"&#xD;
"I am one of the free=companions," replied'&#xD;
asided. carrying .the brimming cup to his&#xD;
mouth.&#xD;
"It'sa lie-'a foul lie 1" retorted the robber,&#xD;
femmsing with ire.&#xD;
Without deigning any reply to this impute&#xD;
tion, Casside, quick as thought, dashed the viae&#xD;
iethebearded ruffian's face.&#xD;
;Instantly a terrific scene ensued. The ban.&#xD;
ditsprang from the table, grinding his teeth&#xD;
wathifury, and drawing his sword, made a hur.&#xD;
ried thrust at Albert, who, foreseeing the eon-&#xD;
sqaenses of whathe bad done, had'tlready un-&#xD;

fire flashed from their edges, and the ,angry&#xD;

lactites that had frozen into form during the&#xD;
lapse of years. They flashed back the reflec-&#xD;

dazzled and astonished the eyes of the young&#xD;
man. Without pausing to examine the various&#xD;
andfications of the grotto, he kept on in what&#xD;

The sound of merriment grew more -distinct&#xD;
as -he proceeded, and he resolved to present&#xD;
himself boldly to the revellers, whatever might&#xD;

reached, ere long, a large door which was closed ;&#xD;
it was the only obstacle which separated him&#xD;
from the carousels.  He exerted a gentle force&#xD;

Brave companions, let us forget- all past differ-&#xD;

and daring recruit.  Yoriek, relax your'brows,&#xD;
and be 'reconciled.  Dick Strow, your honor&#xD;

will be willing to balance- accounts-and anoint&#xD;
their bruises with the oil of forgetfulness. Come,&#xD;
m ierry lads, of Donhead Wood, let us drink&#xD;
awewing bumper to the neophyte."&#xD;
This short speech produced , considerable&#xD;
effeet; the tide of feeling turned in favor 'of&#xD;
asside.  Instantly there was awlively rattle of&#xD;
drinking vessels,, and the health, was drunken&#xD;
with gusto ; although a few unforgiving faces&#xD;
yares till visible.&#xD;
All now addressed themselves to the busi-&#xD;
ness of eating and drinking, our hero not ex-&#xD;
oepted; who resolved to make'himself as much&#xD;
at ehone as the most swaggering ruffian among.&#xD;
them.&#xD;
adrmous-quantities of food vanished as if&#xD;
by magic, while servants, male and female, ap-&#xD;
pearedto answer the}vociferous demands of the&#xD;
revellers.  Hearts,'merry enough before, grew&#xD;
merrier cheeks already reddened (with wine,&#xD;
greiredder ; tongues  already voluble in the&#xD;
utterance of profanity and bravado, grew more&#xD;
and more voluble.- The.free companions{boast-&#xD;
ed of their achievements, and discoursed, in a&#xD;
vary eieited manner, ef deeds which they -yet&#xD;
intended to accomplish. They talked-like men&#xD;
who expected to gain;undying renown by their'&#xD;
daring accts. Theyspoke of uptoriety and'fame&#xD;
as being one and identical; that -to be noto-&#xD;
riously bad, w's as'desirable as to be equally&#xD;
oee+brated 'for -deeds of goodness and bene-&#xD;
volenee:&#xD;
SW-While these perverted 'beings were thus- en-&#xD;
gigedand growing everygoment more'boister-&#xD;
eua, a part of the band, which hadbeen deputed&#xD;
tpon particular service, returned sucessful;a&#xD;
bringing with them aiyoung lady,: who was left&#xD;
by ;theOrders of Wetel -(who appeared to com-=&#xD;
x ad n the absence of dafa]kouhead), in an&#xD;
&#xD;
adjoining apartment. Room was instantly&#xD;
made for the new-comers at the convivial board.:&#xD;
They entered with much-zest into the details of&#xD;
their recent -adventure ; and went on to state&#xD;
the particulars of the manner in which they-&#xD;
had taken;their fair prisoner.&#xD;
Casside listened to the recital with absorb-&#xD;
ing interest. The lady, it would seem, who&#xD;
had been the unfortunate victim of this -ruffian-&#xD;
ism, was of gentle birth and high station. She&#xD;
had been one of a hunting party of lords and&#xD;
ladies ; but imprudently allowing her spirited&#xD;
horse -to carry her considerably in advance of&#xD;
her companions, she had unluckily 'fallen into&#xD;
the hands of the banditti; who, having had&#xD;
previous intimation of the hunt, had been sta-&#xD;
tioned, at intervals, in certain localities"favor-&#xD;
able to their purpose.&#xD;
The robbers, being'in uncommon good humor,&#xD;
proceeded to give a very facetious account of&#xD;
the panic which their unexpected appearance&#xD;
had excited in the mind of the noble maiden.&#xD;
They referred to her tears and entreaties 'as.&#xD;
legitimate objects of laughter ;'and to her beauty',&#xD;
as a -thing upon which every' knave had a right&#xD;
to gaze. e&#xD;
"t e has been rumored," said Wetzel, " that'&#xD;
this damsel, who is now our guest, has been blest&#xD;
with rare personal charms. Does she sustain,&#xD;
think you, the reputation which the good -old&#xD;
dame Ramor has conferred upon her ?"3&#xD;
" I think I may safely say," replied one who&#xD;
had been the ;leader of the recent expedition,&#xD;
"that-I never looked upon a =fairer face or a&#xD;
prettier figure ; although=the terror with -which'&#xD;
our presence inspired her, has paled her cheeks;&#xD;
and detracted, somewhat, frog her beauty."&#xD;
"By St. Michael, my patron saint ! I mud&#xD;
see this paragon I" exclaimed Wetzel,' em-&#xD;
phatically.&#xD;
Ay, we must all have a glance at hei   'l&#xD;
cried a score of voices. "",Bring her in; bring=&#xD;
her in, that we may be drunken with beautyir&#xD;
as well as with wine I"f&#xD;
"I care not," resumed Wetzel, "if in'this&#xD;
matter you are gratified. Let thegentle maident'&#xD;
be broughtin. Ho, there!  Yorick, and Dick&#xD;
&#xD;
Strew, be you the escort of this queen of&#xD;
beauty."&#xD;
"With right good will !" responded-the per-&#xD;
sonages addressed, who thereupon 'arose from&#xD;
their seats and staggered forth to perform the&#xD;
bidding of Wetzel; a task which appeared com-&#xD;
pletely consonant with their feelings..&#xD;
During their short absence a breathless silence&#xD;
prevailed in the banqueting hall of the ban-&#xD;
ditti. . Presently footsteps were heard; and all&#xD;
eyes were fastened, upon the door where the&#xD;
unfortunate lady was expected- to make her ap-&#xD;
pearanee. The ruffians were not long kept in&#xD;
suspense-; the door was pushed open, and&#xD;
Yoriek and Dick Strow re-appeared, supporting&#xD;
between them i helpless female.-&#xD;
Albert Casside, whosd ears had been open to&#xD;
every word that had been uttered, and whose&#xD;
indignation could scarcely be repressed during&#xD;
,the time the subject of this brutality had been,&#xD;
under discussion, -did not, at first, raise his head&#xD;
to look at the sufferer, fearing to trust himself&#xD;
to do' so; but when he heard the laud shouts of&#xD;
admiration which burst from the lips of two,&#xD;
hundred inebriated men, he slowly and sorrow-&#xD;
fully lood in the direction in which all faces&#xD;
were turned.&#xD;
The spectacle which he beheld caused him&#xD;
to leap to his feet with the quickness of light-&#xD;
ning, while his respiration seemed nearly sus-&#xD;
pended with the intensity of his surprise and&#xD;
consternation. He gasped for breath like one&#xD;
in the agonies of drowning ; he pressed his&#xD;
hand .convulsively upon his chest ; he clutched&#xD;
at the air for support ; his face became of their&#xD;
ashen hue of death,' and then flushed with the&#xD;
crimson of a burning fever. AHe stood a mo-&#xD;
meat powerless with emotions whichnone could&#xD;
analyze, and then his strong manhood came&#xD;
back to him again, and smoothed down, withI&#xD;
magic power, the 'agony that convulsed his&#xD;
breast, and raised the veins upon his forehead&#xD;
like knotted cords. He folded his arms, that&#xD;
had been thrown aloft so wildly a moment be- 1&#xD;
fore, calmly upon his bosom; he drew himself&#xD;
up proudly and firmly ; his respiration became&#xD;
deep, full, and regular, and not a muscle of his&#xD;
&#xD;
19&#xD;
&#xD;
countenance rebelled Against his own inflexible&#xD;
will.&#xD;
He gazed around him   with.a pride and dig-&#xD;
nity of expression that elevated him to be, .in&#xD;
reality, the-master and leader of them.,all.  "&#xD;
"Denis Wetzel !" he exclaimed, in-tones so&#xD;
calm and yet so -deep that' they could not;fail&#xD;
to fix the attention. of every one, except the&#xD;
unhappy lady who had found temporary relief&#xD;
in unconsciousness. "' Denis Wetzel; let this&#xD;
unmanly exhibition cease. - Ihave stronglyea,&#xD;
all-powerful reasons for " making this 'request.&#xD;
If you refuse me, I swear, by.my honor,- whicm&#xD;
I never tarnished by a base act,'that I willedl&#xD;
you to a terrible account for ' the same.. You&#xD;
perceive this weapon by my side ; Ihave worn&#xD;
it from childhood ; it was buckled there -first by&#xD;
my mother, at an age when its point, trailed&#xD;
upon the groun. I as I walked. She told me that&#xD;
it never was 'o ti drawn except in the cause of&#xD;
the right-in the defence of the wronged and&#xD;
the oppressed, and for the sake of lady-fair.&#xD;
I have never forgotten the 'injunction, and so&#xD;
help me the powers that preside over worth and&#xD;
innocence, I will always obey it to the very let-&#xD;
ter ! I can use this weapon with the skill and&#xD;
strength of a man ; and if you do not choose to&#xD;
order this unhappy maiden from this presence,&#xD;
I shall make it the subject of a personal arbi-&#xD;
trament by the sword."&#xD;
Denis Wetzel, at the commencement of Cas-&#xD;
side's address, sprang from his seat at the head&#xD;
of the table, and drew his sword from its scab-&#xD;
bard ; but before itsjonclusion, slowly sheathed&#xD;
it and resumed his place.&#xD;
The female, who had produced this extraor.&#xD;
dinary sensation, was still supported by Yoriek&#xD;
and Dick Strow ; but'fortunately for her, was&#xD;
yet' insensible to what was transpiring. The&#xD;
loveliness of her features, the purity of her&#xD;
complexion, the symmetry of her proportions,&#xD;
were indeed marvellous. As her beautiful per-&#xD;
son lay unconscious upon the arms of the rob-&#xD;
bers, her face and neck were not unlike , the&#xD;
whiteness of the sculptured marble.&#xD;
The bold speech of Albert produced a striking&#xD;
re-action among the banditti. They gazed with&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
THE MIDNIGHT INTERVI$Ws.&#xD;
&#xD;
T was considerably past the midnight hour.&#xD;
The angel of silence had waved her wing&#xD;
over the labyrinths of the banditti's cave ; they&#xD;
no longer resounded with the sound of boister-&#xD;
ous laughter or reverberated to drunken and&#xD;
excited voices. The lights no longer flashed&#xD;
brilliantly in the grand saloon, and the revellers&#xD;
were looked in the embrace of heavy slumber.&#xD;
Albert Casside was the occupant of a damp&#xD;
and cheerless apartment. He was lying upon&#xD;
some straw, securely ironed. Sleep had not&#xD;
visited his eyelids; his brain was the theatre&#xD;
of many distracting thoughts. Believing that&#xD;
he heard cautious footsteps traversing the sub-&#xD;
terranean corridor which led'to the gloomy place&#xD;
of his imprisonmpent, he raised himself upon his&#xD;
elbow and listened attentively. Some one paus-&#xD;
ed at the door ; a key turned in the lock; the,&#xD;
rusty hinges grated dissonantly upon his ear,&#xD;
and a man, holding an iron lamp in his hand,&#xD;
stood before him. It was Denis Wetzel, and&#xD;
his expression was thoughtful and troubled.&#xD;
" Have oorne,tosay afew words to you."&#xD;
"Let them be brief," replied Casside.&#xD;
"It would appear," resumed Wetzel, "that&#xD;
the demon of rashness and audacity-has possessed&#xD;
you for thelast few hours. I pereive that you&#xD;
are resolved to place your neek in halter as&#xD;
speedily as possible."&#xD;
&#xD;
"And yours," retorted Albert, sneeringly,&#xD;
"should have been thus placed years igo, be-&#xD;
fore you had stained your hands with crimes at&#xD;
which humanity revolts."&#xD;
"Hold L" -exclaimed the other, sternly.&#xD;
"Do not tax my patience more severely than&#xD;
you have already done."&#xD;
"Strike these fetters from my limbs," re-&#xD;
joined Casside,." and then address to me such&#xD;
language, if you dare. . Fulfil the promises you&#xD;
have given me. I demand to be taken before&#xD;
Mark Donhead."&#xD;
" Your wish shall be gratified in due time.&#xD;
You will feel his power, perchance, sooner than&#xD;
you imagine. Your conduct, this night, has&#xD;
been outrageous.  Speak : what is this fair&#xD;
damsel to you? What sympathetic cord makes\&#xD;
you feel her sufferings ?" added Wetzel.&#xD;
"That is a secret that I shall keep ; it shall&#xD;
die with me, if I die, and live only with me, if&#xD;
I live. It is a secret most dear to me ; I will&#xD;
share it with no brigand under heaven," return-&#xD;
ed Albert,,firmly.&#xD;
"You are in the wrong, young manI" said&#xD;
the bandit. "I should be your-eonfUnt.".&#xD;
"Tou/" exclaimed Casside, ssraically.&#xD;
"Even I," rejoined Wetzel, kneeling beside&#xD;
our hero, and with a-small haminer beginning&#xD;
to remove the irons upon his limbs.&#xD;

&#xD;
" This is an unexpected favor," resumed&#xD;
Albert.  "I thought it possible that you had&#xD;
come for another purpose."&#xD;
" To -assassinate you, perhaps ?" replied the&#xD;
bandit.&#xD;
" That was my conviction," said the young&#xD;
man.&#xD;
" That proves," continued Wetzel, " that&#xD;
Satan does not always get his due ; that he is&#xD;
often basely slandered ; that he is maligned- in&#xD;
various ways ; that on account of former mis-&#xD;
deeds, he is seen with distorted vision by all&#xD;
eyes. But'come ; your limbs are free again.&#xD;
Arise, and let us discuss matters in a more&#xD;

respecting this gentle damsel, whose appearance&#xD;
operated upon you so wonderfully, Not many&#xD;

4g  her'hither."'&#xD;
"And did he not fear the anger of her&#xD;
father ?" asked Casside, hastily.&#xD;
"I trow 'not," answered the bandit.  " We&#xD;
are not wont to fear great names. We are&#xD;
x6re' powe'fil'than the lord of Moteombe Manor;&#xD;
we can defy him to his teeth. Mark Donhead&#xD;
.F ah'rger retinue of men-at-aris, than the&#xD;
haughty father of-our fair guest."'&#xD;
" But where was this Godfrey Ridenger dur-&#xD;
igthe scenes of the past night?"' inquired&#xD;
A16?t.&#xD;
"rie *as'away oi another service, and the&#xD;
eajtureiof the maiden was entrusted to other&#xD;
hetide: * Had "he been present ia person, he&#xD;
would dodibbless have objected to exhibiting her&#xD;
i'o r fellows in' the manner which was'seen'by&#xD;

1asinflaianed' with wine, I should not have&#xD;
peaitted 'it."&#xD;
"tIt was unmanly-it was brutal I" 'said&#xD;
"   Was not 'gallant, at' lidst," added Wet-&#xD;
zl,  atid I regret that the event' has suffei-ed&#xD;
4 Ran;"4"&#xD;
tiWy60begint    talk tikre  persed who&#xD;
&#xD;
haw-yet some sense of honor remaining. Your&#xD;
last words remove some of the unpleasant im-&#xD;
pressions which your late conduct produced.&#xD;
Wetzel, this gentle girl'must be saved from the&#xD;
fate that Godfrey Ridenger is preparing for her.&#xD;
His accursed projects must be thwarted forever.&#xD;
I will move heaven and earth to save her."&#xD;
Wetzellaid his hand heavily upon Casside's&#xD;
shoulder. and said, impressively:&#xD;
"I ask once more, if you. will tell me what&#xD;
relation you sustain to the daughter of the lord&#xD;
of Moteombe Manor'? Is it possible that you&#xD;
have presumed to love one so far above you in&#xD;
station ?"&#xD;
" On that subject I shall still remain silent ;&#xD;
you have had my answer.   You must already&#xD;
know me well enough, to be aware that my&#xD;
purposes are fixed and strong ; that I do not&#xD;
change them without reason."&#xD;
"So he it," returned Wetzel, decidedly.&#xD;
"Know, then, that Godfrey Ridenger is pow-&#xD;
erful, and that the maiden could not be wrested&#xD;
from him, were she born of the noblest in the&#xD;
land. No matter if she were the 'daughter of&#xD;
the Eail-of Kent, or even a princess of the blood:&#xD;
In this case, my fiery youth, you are more than&#xD;
matched.  There is a power opposed to you,&#xD;
with which you-cannot successfully struggle."&#xD;
" But 'Mark Donhead-"&#xD;
" Mark Donhead hiinself'eadhot'easily control&#xD;
the actions of Ridenger," interrupted Wetzel,&#xD;
impatiently.&#xD;
"I hadisupposed that Mark was absolute;"&#xD;
resumed Albert,' thoughtfully.  " Bat it ap-&#xD;
pears that he is not; that he is ruled by-a. sub&#xD;
ordinate officer'; that he is not the iron heart I&#xD;
faicied-him to be.",&#xD;
"He is absolute !"' thundered Wetziel, strik-&#xD;
ing his foot against. the ground violently. "He&#xD;
utters afoul'lie who affirms that he governs With&#xD;
a feeble hand."'&#xD;
The bandit paused; and' walked hurriedly&#xD;
across the apartment a few' times, and then&#xD;
added :&#xD;
"But enough of this ; drop the suhbjeat, and&#xD;
ieer let'it be ieiumed again.  ]oiead will&#xD;
not interfere in'this matter; it'is 'not for hin%-&#xD;
&#xD;
terest. He is not a fool. He will notfnedgle&#xD;
withwhat does not concern him, without cogent&#xD;
reasons. Give your thoughts to other matters.&#xD;
To-morrow night you will be enrolled among us.&#xD;
Forget the past ; gather up your manliness, and&#xD;
prepare yourself for the imposing ceremonies of&#xD;
the initiation.  "Come, follow me to a more&#xD;
comfortable apartment.""&#xD;
Taking Casside's arm, the bandit conducted&#xD;
him through several windings of the cavern to&#xD;
the place which ,he had first occupied. He&#xD;
found there a comfortable couch prepared for his&#xD;
reception, and a sideboard loaded with various&#xD;
kinds of eatables and choice wines.&#xD;
"Here," added Wetzel, "you may make&#xD;
yourself comfortable, and even happy, if you&#xD;
will be reasonable. Take the world as you find&#xD;
it, and not try to remedy evils which cannot be&#xD;
remedied ;,submit patiently to ills which can-&#xD;
not be cured by the most skilful leech."&#xD;
Albert threw himself listlessly  upon the&#xD;
.couch and made no reply; -but had internally&#xD;
marked out the course',he intended to pursue,&#xD;
and the rules by which he resolved to be gov-&#xD;
erned, in relation to matters which lay nearest&#xD;
his heart.. Denis Wetzel poured out a glass of,&#xD;
wine, drank it off, and once more left the&#xD;
neophyte, to eat, to drink, to sleep, to reflect, to&#xD;
repent, to kill himself with his own sword, or to&#xD;
do anything els  hich he could, under the cir-&#xD;
:cumstances.&#xD;
Casside, chose, however, to remain precisely&#xD;
as the bandit had left him. The idea.of repose&#xD;
did not, occur to him; ,his mind was to deeply&#xD;
engrossed with other matters-affairs, to, him, of&#xD;
.thefirst importance. But he waa not destined&#xD;
to remain long undisturbed,; he heardi steps&#xD;
without in precisely the same manner as be had&#xD;
- .  the case of Wetzel's recent visit. He heard&#xD;
a key placed in the lock, and the door opened,&#xD;
as on that occasion. That event appeared to&#xD;
him to be quite natural-; but, the, advent of&#xD;
.his present visitor seemed wholly the reyerse;&#xD;
for it was no other than Strolling Willie, theI&#xD;
IbJn beggar.&#xD;
Motioning our heroto observe the utnIggt&#xD;
silence, he closed, 'relocked the dor, and ap-&#xD;
&#xD;
preached the couch upon which Cassid was&#xD;
lying.&#xD;
" I am probably the ,last person whom  ypr&#xD;
expected to see !" said the stroller.&#xD;
" Nothing could be truer than that remk,"&#xD;
replied Albert, looking at the. mendicant as if&#xD;
disposed to distrust the evidence of his senses.&#xD;
"How, in the name of all the saints, did you&#xD;
get here ?" he added.&#xD;
" Naturally enough ; by .instinct--nothing&#xD;
but instinct," returned the new-comer.&#xD;
" Nonsense I" retorted Albert. "There is&#xD;
a deeper mystery about this transaction than&#xD;
instinct. Men's instincts usually lead them in&#xD;
different directions; and persons of your call-&#xD;
ing to any place but this. Bah! instinct,!"&#xD;
" Very  wonderful is instinct,"  resmned&#xD;
Willie, musingly. "It directs the footsteps of&#xD;
the poor blind man to haunts, which the acutest&#xD;
eyesight in the world might never discover."&#xD;
" Well, keep your own secrets; let it be in-&#xD;
stinct, if you will," rejoined Albert.. "And&#xD;
now be good enough to tell me the object of&#xD;
this visit'?"&#xD;
" It is to do all that one of my condition may&#xD;
to assist you; to give.you, perhaps, a word or&#xD;
two of advice which may prove useful," replied&#xD;
Willie.&#xD;
" Mysterious man ! say what you pleas.&#xD;
I am ready to listen !" exclaimed Casside.&#xD;
" In playing at this dangerous gagpe," re-&#xD;
sumed the mendicant, " you need much .cun-&#xD;
ning and prudence. In regard to the maiden,&#xD;
at present a captive, you must operate more by&#xD;
stratagem than, by violent measures. Physical&#xD;
force may prevail when one meets his eey&#xD;
hand to hand ; but not whin he is opposed tq a&#xD;
power that he cannot, comprehend, and whih&#xD;
appears to' spread itself out in all diristiw.&#xD;
You cannot well battle with.the arm of mnl t&#xD;
which holds the damsel in its grasp; it re&#xD;
a long way; it has power to crush its enemies&#xD;
at a great distance. Be calm, and act opptious.&#xD;

clasping his hands, and pressing them' to the&#xD;
tattered rage that covered his. bosom, "life is&#xD;
sweet, even to the poor, the blind, the wander-&#xD;

" I doubt it not," returned Albert, seriously;&#xD;
" and although bereft- of all that could make&#xD;
existence endurable, I am-ree to acknowledge&#xD;
that af this moment I shrink from death ; that&#xD;
cold and chilling thing that freezes up the vital&#xD;
fluids, and leaves the human organism to feel&#xD;
the force of those laws which will, inevitably,&#xD;
resolve it to its primal elements. Yes, it is true,&#xD;
too true, that even I am base enough to wish to&#xD;
live.&#xD;
eas! no, my good youth, it is not base&#xD;
to desire to prolong life ; it is nature-a voice,&#xD;
a continually breathing. voice, which you ean no&#xD;
more cease to hear, than you can cease to feel&#xD;
the wants of hunger and thirst, and innate&#xD;
longings for happiness. The love of existence&#xD;
is strong in young hearts and strong in ol-:-in&#xD;
the latter but too, too strong. But I wander&#xD;
from fny purpose ; I am babbling of that which'&#xD;
I should endeavor not to think of ; for sufficient&#xD;
unto the day is the evil thereof. I know many&#xD;
things which you would ask; I perceive many&#xD;

'sword rises and falls at his bidding;'.he is tr&#xD;

The stroller ceased speaking, and opening te&#xD;

of man. You observe that each has sandals&#xD;
upon his feet, and a staff in his hand, like r**&#xD;

Casside bowed acquiescence, and theguide&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
THE INITIATION.&#xD;
&#xD;
" 14A&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
fjT Was the night of the initiation of Albert&#xD;
Casside into the opening scenes of a bandit's&#xD;
life An individual, clad in the habit of a monk,&#xD;
had passed two hours with the neophyte, giving&#xD;
hini' acli instructions as were deemed appro-&#xD;
priate an ,n sse d, fd in a simple gar-&#xD;
moist resemingt          with sandals upon&#xD;
his feet, and.a sta  his band, he was led&#xD;
through the long corridor into a large apartment&#xD;
adJoining the grand saloon. A number of per-&#xD;
- sons clad in the same costume preceded and&#xD;
wentbeliind him. The passage was but dimly&#xD;
light, antilow and mournful strains of music&#xD;
floatethough the labyrinth. Arrived at-,the&#xD;
apartment, Albert perceived, at the farther&#xD;
extomity, an elevated platform, accessible by&#xD;
ste supon which was seated, on a sort of&#xD;
throne, a man clad in costly and splendid ap-&#xD;
parel. Extending the whole length of the com-&#xD;
partment, upon.the right and 'upon the left, in&#xD;
tW b s, were many individuals attired' like&#xD;
Myself.&#xD;
Adfranting to a person seated in front of the&#xD;
platforhi, \Casside inquired to know the .meaning&#xD;
of what he beheld.&#xD;
&#xD;

46'                            THE SILV&#xD;
They appeared to be weary and dispirited ;&#xD;
soon they fell down and seemed to expire by&#xD;
the way, uttering deep groans and piteous&#xD;
lamentations.&#xD;
" Those are some of the pilgrims whom you&#xD;
have seen ; discouraged, at length, and worn&#xD;
out with the vain effort to attain to happiness,&#xD;
they perish miserably upon their pilgrimage."&#xD;
The guide continued to move forward, and&#xD;
anon the passage appeared to be strewn with&#xD;
human bones.&#xD;
"These are the remains of the pilgrims,"&#xD;
added the conductor.&#xD;
"And have they all shated the same fate ?"&#xD;
asked Albert.&#xD;
"1No : a few bold and indomitable spirits&#xD;
have discovered a shorter way, and have suc-&#xD;
ceeded in attaining t,o the summit of their hopes.-&#xD;
Follow, and you shall look upon the'successful&#xD;
few."&#xD;
The cicerone turned abruptly into another&#xD;
passage. The doleful music ceased ; the lights&#xD;
Mashed up more cheerfully, and they passed&#xD;
alcng with greater alacrity. jn a moment they&#xD;
stood at the entrance of-the grand saloon. Two&#xD;
persons, "in the livery of servants, threw it open,&#xD;
and a magnificent spectacle dazzled the eyes of&#xD;
CJasside.&#xD;
The banditti, arrayed in their most costly&#xD;
od imposing garments, holding drawn swords&#xD;
in their hands, stood motionless as statues upon&#xD;
each side of the long table, upon which was&#xD;
sprea4 every luxury which could tempt the&#xD;
pate of an ;epicure, or which wealth could&#xD;
p*eeure.  At the head of the board, more rich-&#xD;
:ly- arrayed than all the others, with a crown&#xD;
upon his head, and a sceptre in his jewelled&#xD;
. an&amp;amp;,' sat the individual whom Casside had&#xD;
known -as Denis Wetzel.&#xD;
"What moral truth is intended to be illus-&#xD;
tated 'by this imposing sene'?" asked Albert.&#xD;
" These are the'pilgrims, ;who, despising the&#xD;
piejddices 'of 'weak and superstitious minds,&#xD;
have found a new ana certain road to ease.and&#xD;
" afnee. These are persons who are governed&#xD;
qav -by their-own desires ;. who believe in the&#xD;
equal distribution of property; -who will'not&#xD;
&#xD;
PER BELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
starve while the wealthy are rolling in luxury ;&#xD;
who will not suffer wrong and injustice ; who&#xD;
appropriate to themselves whatever nature seems&#xD;
to crave ; who take food when they are hungry,&#xD;
without asking whence it comes ; who drink&#xD;
wine when they are' thirsty, without inquiring&#xD;
in whose cellar it acquired its age and flavor.;&#xD;
who put gold into their pockets, without trou-&#xD;
bling themselves about the mint where it was&#xD;
coined, or the coffers from whence it was taken;&#xD;
who make the sword the great umpire of all&#xD;
questions of right and title ; who live for the&#xD;
present, and take no thought for the future ;&#xD;
whose motto is ' eat, drink, and be merry, for&#xD;
to-morrow we may die.""      ,       ,&#xD;
" These principles," returned Casside, fol-&#xD;
lowing the letter of his instructions, " are in ae-&#xD;
cordance . with my philosophy. I have - long&#xD;
believed that life was a thing to be enjoyed.&#xD;
Tell me, sir, how I may become a member of&#xD;
this brotherhood ?"&#xD;
" By proving your courage and ability, and&#xD;
by subscribing to the laws which hold them in&#xD;
solemn compact."&#xD;
"I request you to propose me for member-&#xD;
ship to this wise- fraternity."&#xD;
"Prefer the request to Mark Donhead,- the&#xD;
leader of the free companions.  That is he,, ait&#xD;
ting at the head of the .  upon the elevated,&#xD;
seat."                  ',,'.:&#xD;
Albert Casside could repress 'his surprise at&#xD;
this disclosure, only by a strong effort of the&#xD;
will., The truth was at length apparent; Dbnia&#xD;
Wetzel and Mark Donhead were-idential.&#xD;
"Daring commander of these bravemg.   f&#xD;
said Albert, 4"I desire to be admitted tio the&#xD;
secrets andiprivileges of your order."&#xD;
Mark Donhead made no rejoinder, but slowly&#xD;
waved his sceptre. Immediately several per.&#xD;
sons: clad in black marched into the salojn&#xD;
through the open toor, and proceeded to remove&#xD;
a - rge aereen upon the left, when several in-&#xD;
dividuals were seen, with their swords croseea4&#xD;
inthe act of commencing a combat. The Mcr&#xD;
flict began and was carried on with m ehapirit&#xD;
and determination, until they sankAdow  ap&#xD;
parently, from wounds and exhaustion.&#xD;

&#xD;
You see   usat w.  A   is scene,&#xD;
said the conductor,'" that the followers of Mark&#xD;
Donhead are never to fly from their enemies ;&#xD;
but to fight until victory crowns their efforts,&#xD;
or'death lays them low. Each person is solemnly&#xD;
pledged to die with sword in hand, or peace-&#xD;
- ably in bed, and never to perish by the arm of&#xD;
law. The hemp is not grown that shall stran-&#xD;
gle'one of our order."&#xD;
Again Mark Donhead waved his sceptre,&#xD;
and a second screen was removed, revealing the&#xD;
appearance of a large building of stone, with&#xD;
grated-windows, which was strongly guarded by&#xD;
men-at-arms. Suddenly a party of men, clad&#xD;
like the banditti, rushed upon them and after a&#xD;
short and decisive struggle, defeated them.&#xD;
"That gloomy edifice," resumed the cicerone,&#xD;
"is a prison, and the men-at-arms, are the sol&#xD;
diers of the king; .and the whole is intended to&#xD;
convey the'idea that if any of our brethren, by&#xD;
any unavoidable necessity, be captured and&#xD;
imprisoned, that the brotherhood is to make&#xD;
'every possible effort'to set them at liberty, even&#xD;
at the hazard of life and limb."&#xD;
Mark Donhead for the third time waved the&#xD;
emblem of power, and the third screen upon'&#xD;
being withdrawn, displayed to view a block&#xD;
and an executioner, with an axe. Near the block&#xD;
knelt a man. whosghands -were bound, and&#xD;
whose neck was bare.. A priest stood beside&#xD;
the culprit, and Casside recognized in him the&#xD;
monk David. In a solemn voice he read the&#xD;
service for the dead. When he had finished,&#xD;
the kneeling man proceeded to utter a prayer,&#xD;
whose deep earnestness made Albert's heart&#xD;
beat fast with apprehension. He prayed like&#xD;
one standing on the threshold of death ; like&#xD;
one whose last and only hope is in invisible&#xD;
power ; like one who already feels the agony of&#xD;
dissolution ; like one who strives to master an&#xD;
awful shrinking from a fate which he knows he&#xD;
cannot, by any possibility, 'evade. He ended&#xD;
his fervent appeal to Heaven, but still seemed&#xD;
anxious to prolong the moments of existence.&#xD;
The monk attempted to comfort him with as-&#xD;
surances of a better life, and to make him com- T&#xD;
prehend that the pains of dying were short, and&#xD;
not so- dreadful as they appeared.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
The culpritgroaned in spirit; e&#xD;
self devoutly upon the breast with his pinioned&#xD;
hands, and with a shudder, laid his head upon&#xD;
the block.&#xD;
Albert's heart beat with intense excitement ;&#xD;
he felt a sickly faintness creeping over him;&#xD;
and his brain grew dizzy with horror. - The&#xD;
axe descended like lightning; the man's head&#xD;
was severed from the body--the streams of life&#xD;
rushed forth in crimson jets, and the liinbs&#xD;
quivered in the throes of death.       -&#xD;
The scene was indeed too real; a hunan&#xD;
spirit had passed to its account.&#xD;
"It is thus," added, the Cicerone, "that&#xD;
Mark Donhead punishes traitors."&#xD;
Instantly the low, mournful strains of mar-&#xD;
tial music again resounded through the cavern,;&#xD;
the lights in the'greatsaloon suddenly grew dim.&#xD;
There was a short interval of profound silepee;&#xD;
then the body of the unfortunate who had been&#xD;
beheaded, was brought forward in an open&#xD;
coffin and placed at the foot of the table.&#xD;
.Casside1 whose senses 'had been- stunned for&#xD;
a moment by the terrible scene which had just&#xD;
been enacted, now endeavored to shake off the&#xD;
fearful impression which, it had made. - The&#xD;
cicerone whispered a few words of instruction in&#xD;
his ear.&#xD;
Albert immediately knelt beside ,the coffin,&#xD;
and placing his hands upon the dead man's&#xD;
breast, said, in a clear and distinct voice :&#xD;
" When I betray Mark Donhead or his fol-&#xD;
lowers, may I become even as this man. May&#xD;
my punishment be sure and speedy, like his,&#xD;
and may no angel of mercy be near to avert my&#xD;
doom."&#xD;
When he had pronounced these words, the&#xD;
lights burned brilliantly once more, the solemn&#xD;
music changed to a lively measure, the body of&#xD;
the traitor was removed, and all the emblems of&#xD;
the initiation disappeared. Two men, bearing&#xD;
a large roll upon their crossed swords, entered ;&#xD;
the roll was laid upon the table, and a pen was&#xD;

IT was near the hour of rosy morn. The&#xD;
bhechanalian revelry had ceased. The fol-&#xD;
lowers of Mark Donhead had reeled to their&#xD;
coudhes, and their senses . were again looked in&#xD;
lethargic slumbers' Our hero was alone, oc-&#xD;
cupying the same apartment which had been&#xD;
clotted him on his first entrance to the secret&#xD;
haunt of the banditti. He had indulged but&#xD;
earingly in wine, for he wished to keep every&#xD;
faculty of the mind in a state of tranquillity, in&#xD;
order to beable to seize upon any circumstances&#xD;
that might occur, favorable to his purposes.&#xD;
The scenes of the initiation had made a deep&#xD;
impression upon him, and ho recalled, with a&#xD;
cold thrill of horror, the tragedy that had mark-&#xD;
45 the final scene.  In imagination, he saw&#xD;
once more pictured before him the kneeling&#xD;
Agare of 'the traitor, witnessed the throes of&#xD;
goxny which shook his frame, and heard the,&#xD;
folce of his despairing prayer. Casside cover-&#xD;
ed his eyes; as if to shut out from his mental&#xD;
eight the remainder of the spectacle,&#xD;
*,And this," he said to himself, impressively,&#xD;
" and this may be my fate I"          -&#xD;
With a sigh he raised his head and turired&#xD;
&#xD;
a startled look towards the door; for he heard&#xD;
it moving, in the act of being opened ; Strolling'&#xD;
Willie was again hisv isitor.&#xD;
"You corme and go as mysteriously-as the&#xD;
spectres of the night. What brings you now-?&#xD;
said Albert.&#xD;
" My limbs bring me, and my instincts guide&#xD;
me," replied the stroller.&#xD;
"Your purpose, then ?" added Albert.&#xD;
" To aid you; to prevent the meshes of Mark&#xD;
-Donhead's power from enclosing you inextri-&#xD;
cably; to assist you in dealing with one who is&#xD;
wise as a serpent, and as strong as- a lion ; to&#xD;
help you play skilfully the game, upon the re-&#xD;
sults of which are staked life and death," re-&#xD;
plied the beggar.&#xD;
"It'may be thus, I know not," answered the&#xD;
young man, "and, after all, it may be quite the&#xD;
reverse. - it is said that the tempter often pre=&#xD;
sents himself to mankind in a garb least'e*pedb&amp;amp;&#xD;

60                    THE SILVER BELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
plot thickens as you proceed.  The unexpected&#xD;
appearance of this high born damsel in whom&#xD;
you appear to be so strangely interested, throws&#xD;
around you another strong influence to drag you&#xD;
forward to the consummation of your ruin.&#xD;
Against occurrences not anticipated, the most&#xD;
skilful schemer cannot always guard ; but I&#xD;
shall nevertheless make an effort to bring this&#xD;
affair to a- successful termination. - On this oc-&#xD;
casion I have sought you to reveal a most val-&#xD;
uable secret; a secret which will prove of the&#xD;
most vital importance, if kept, and of the most&#xD;
fatal consequences, if betrayed. The revellers&#xD;
are sleeping soundly ; the fumes of the accursed&#xD;
stimulants which they have swallowed, paralyze&#xD;
all their mental and physical powers; but, not-&#xD;
withstanding this, we shall incur some risk in&#xD;
the adventure to which we shall now address&#xD;
ourselves.  Follow me, and I will make a&#xD;
curious revelation."&#xD;
Wandering Willie took the small iron lamp&#xD;
in his hand, and passed from Albert's apart-&#xD;
ment into the main shaft of the cavern. Albert&#xD;
mechanically moved after him, wondering what&#xD;
new mystery was about to dawn upon his senses.&#xD;
The stroller stole softly onward in a direction&#xD;
opposite'to the entrance of the' cavern. In a&#xD;
few moments he left the lofty corridor, and fol-&#xD;
lowed the fantastic: turnings of a-smaller and&#xD;
more obscure passage-a damp and rugged way,&#xD;
as cheerless asthe tomb itself.  In the cold&#xD;
and mephitic airs the lamp burned feebly, and&#xD;
4lbert's respiration was considerably affected&#xD;
ly the same -circumstance.-&#xD;
"his is a way seldom travelled," whispered&#xD;
Willie, "and were we, by any untoward acci-&#xD;
dent discovered here, weishould never travel it&#xD;
again. We will look, for one moment, into&#xD;
that;passage to-the right."  The stroller turned&#xD;
in the-direction indicated, and after going a lit.&#xD;
tle,distance, reached a large and dismal com-&#xD;
partment.                     -&#xD;
"It is here," resumed the beggar, "that the&#xD;
banditti-bury their dead."             ..&#xD;
Albert surveyed the spot as well as he could&#xD;
by the dim light, and beheld quite a number of&#xD;
mounds, and one which had just been made.&#xD;
&#xD;
He recoiled with horror, and a voice seemed to&#xD;
whisper and tell him the secret of that recent&#xD;
grave. He felt an indescribable sensation of&#xD;
relief when the stroller turned and retraced his&#xD;
steps.&#xD;
The latter now proceeded in silence, -and&#xD;
Albert followed him with sad, gloomy, and fore-&#xD;
boding thoughts. His guide paused, at length,&#xD;
at what appeared to be the end of the passage.&#xD;
"What now'?" inquired Albert. "   I see&#xD;
nothing that can interest me in this damp and&#xD;
chilly place."&#xD;
"Be patient ; do not jump so hastily at con-&#xD;
clusions. There are a flight of steps here some-&#xD;
where ; do you see them ?"   ,&#xD;
Our hero glanced about the spot more par-&#xD;
ticularly, and discovered a flight of stone steps,&#xD;
which seemed to be more the work of nature&#xD;
than of art.,&#xD;
"Now," continued the stroller, "you must&#xD;
observe the profoundest silence. Follow me,&#xD;
and step lightly."&#xD;
"If the blind lead the blind, -will not both&#xD;
fall into the ditch together ?" answered Albert,&#xD;
in the same tone.&#xD;
"Not where the faculty.of instinct is fully&#xD;
developed," rejoined the beggar, with a smile.-&#xD;
He then mounted the steps and soon reached&#xD;
the top of the flight, where all farther progress,&#xD;
seemed to be denied -by a wall of solid rock.-&#xD;
Willie pressed against it with his hand, and lo&#xD;
there appeared an opening of sufficient sie to&#xD;
admit the body of a man, through which the&#xD;
stroller passed, motioning Albert to imitate his&#xD;
example.&#xD;
He did so, and upon looking around, found&#xD;
himself in what resembled, in every particular,,&#xD;
a wine cellar ; for it was filled with casks and&#xD;
bottles both large and small.  Albert did, not&#xD;
express the thought which was in his mind, aid&#xD;
his singular guide kept on,. ascended another&#xD;
flight of steps, which were obviously the work&#xD;
of human hands (being made of wood), ; an&#xD;
raising a trap door, emerged from the cellar into&#xD;
what - appeared to Albert a small room above&#xD;
ground.&#xD;
Again warning our hero to observe the groat-&#xD;
&#xD;
'      est caution, he crossed  the apartment and&#xD;
mounted athird staircase, leading, as the others&#xD;
bad done, to an ingeniously contrived door. The&#xD;
surprise of Albert cannot be easily conceived,&#xD;
after creeping through the third aperture, upon&#xD;
discovering himself in a chamber precisely like&#xD;
that which Joachim Capet had assigned him at&#xD;
theSilver Bell.&#xD;
"Do you recognize this'?" asked the mendi'&#xD;
cant, in a suppressed voice.&#xD;
" I think I do," returned the young man ;&#xD;
"and if it were not so far from the cave of the&#xD;
banditti, I should say it - was the chamber I&#xD;
recently occupied at the Silver Bell."&#xD;
"You are right," rejoined Willie; " we are&#xD;
indeed aVJoachim Capet's inn."&#xD;
"Impossible !" exclaimed Albert.&#xD;
Oh the contrary, quite possible ;; for your&#xD;
long walk to the cave, under the guidance of&#xD;
Mark Donhead, was purposely intended to give&#xD;
you a wrong impression of the locality."&#xD;
"This is indeed an important secret," said&#xD;
Albert.  " Is it known to all the banditti?"&#xD;
"It is known only to those who have proved&#xD;
themselves worthy " of the confidence of Mark&#xD;
Donhead. The mysterious connection of the&#xD;
robber'' cave with the Silver Bell is not reveal-&#xD;
ed until after the term of trial has expired, and&#xD;
the new-comer has acquitted himself to the&#xD;
general satisfaction of all 'oncerned. Some&#xD;
belong to the band for months, without having&#xD;
any knowledge of the subject, and it is a secret&#xD;
of which you would have known nothing, had&#xD;
it not been discovered to you in this manner.&#xD;
The time may arrive when the knowledge you&#xD;
have this night acquired, may be of incalculable&#xD;
use. Some unexpected event, or some terrible&#xD;
contingency maf occur, from the consequences&#xD;
of which you can only escape by means of this&#xD;
singular connection of the cave with the -ilver&#xD;
"tJoachim Capet then, of course, is but the&#xD;
agent of Mark Donhead ?" said Casside.  ,&#xD;
"He is in the secret ; it could not well be&#xD;
otherwise, and a more selfish and money-loving&#xD;
knave never walked," was the rejoinder.&#xD;
While our hero and Willie were carrying oni&#xD;
&#xD;
this: whispered conversation, the murmur of&#xD;
voices reached them from an adjoining room.&#xD;
The stroller placed his ear to the wall and lis-&#xD;
tened, and then made a. sign for. Albert to o:&#xD;
likewise. The 'tones which he heard did not&#xD;
sound altogether unfamiliar.&#xD;
"I am rejoiced to hear this news," said one;&#xD;
"the affair must now terminate in- a manner to&#xD;
suit .my wishes. I see no means by which the&#xD;
Lady Eveline can escape the meshes of my&#xD;
power. Yonder subterranean vaults keep well&#xD;
their secrets. She is proud-she - is spirited,&#xD;
imperious; she must be subdued, humbled,&#xD;
humiliated. 1 And, perhaps," he added, in a&#xD;
voice of deeper significance, " degraded."&#xD;
" Act your pleasure, sir knight," replied&#xD;
another voice,," but I tell you frankly that I&#xD;
like not this°mode , of wooing the fair damsel.&#xD;
I would greatly prefer to woo her on' bended&#xD;
knee, and with words most fitting and gentle."&#xD;
" Woo how, when, and just as often, as you&#xD;
please !" retorted the first speaker, " and.I will&#xD;
not find fault with you ;- but I reserve to my-&#xD;
self the same liberty. However, I proposed,&#xD;
honorably to this haughty maiden, once on a&#xD;
time, but met with no reciprocal response. I&#xD;
never forgave her for being indifferent to my&#xD;
suit, and am now putting in practice a fixed&#xD;
purpose of retaliation. I know that the news&#xD;
of her.violent abduction will spread like wild-&#xD;
fire all over the country, and great efforts will&#xD;
be made to discover tie perpetrators ; but they&#xD;
will be able to find no traces of her ; for the&#xD;
cavern, in Donhead Wood, does not disclose its&#xD;
mysteries. But in regard to the rude fellow&#xD;
who gave my honor such a wound a few morn-&#xD;
ings ago, I must devise means to have him&#xD;
punished. Have you sent for Herbault, Mark's&#xD;
executioner'?"&#xD;
" Yes, I despatched Joachim Capet for the&#xD;
ruffian," replied the knight, somewhat contempt-&#xD;
uously.&#xD;
" You have no great relish for this business,&#xD;
I perceive," retorted the knight, sharply.&#xD;
" Iut I care little for that, providing you do&#xD;
not play me false ; in which event, methinks,&#xD;
it will go hard with you. Since you have been&#xD;

"Do not delay an instant longer," whiypedid&#xD;
the stroller, " for every moment is precious. I&#xD;

The mendicant led the way, and they.quik&#xD;
and noiselessly glided from the chamber through&#xD;

IW ANDEtING WILLIE paused and&#xD;
turned toward his companion, Axing his&#xD;
sightless eyeballs upon him in a manner to in-&#xD;
dieate the deepest earnestness.&#xD;
- Could I by any means have ;foreseen that&#xD;
Godfrey Ridenger would have returned so soon,&#xD;
and that Herbault wouldhave been sent for, I&#xD;
should hot have conducted you hither," he&#xD;
said ; "but the' gift of readit .the!events of the&#xD;
future is denied to mnortalsv  Having u nder-&#xD;
taken this adventure, we must conduct it boldly&#xD;
tor a conclusion. You already know for *hat&#xD;
purpose the services of the assassin are required,&#xD;
and who is to be tke object of this'horrible&#xD;
trade. The conversation to ,which you have&#xD;

"Can'wesnot secrete ourselves in the wine&#xD;
cellar until aftetHerbault has passed though ?"&#xD;
asked Albert.&#xD;
" Possibly we might; but discovery would&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
be almost inevitable. I hope to gain tie main&#xD;
shaft of the cavern before he reaches the spot ;&#xD;
on that contingency I stake our chance of sucs&#xD;

emphasis '   '&#xD;
" What mean you?" inquired Albert, as he&#xD;
followed the old man through the trap-door into&#xD;
the cellar.&#xD;
Willie paused near the foot of the stairs, and&#xD;
grasping Albert's arm, replied:&#xD;
"Should we meet him, but two alternatives&#xD;
remain;'he must'e, or we must."&#xD;
"But I hate murder t" returned Albert,&#xD;
with a shudder.  " I can give broken headsin&#xD;
the heat of passion, or measure swords with my&#xD;
adversary on equal ground; but to shed blpod&#xD;
deliberately is abhorrent to -all my feelings.&#xD;
Devise some other plan of escape."&#xD;

our most strenuous and untiring efforts in their&#xD;
aid. Think of Isandra ; think of the Lady&#xD;
Eveline.  They are young, they are fair, and&#xD;
hitherto have been hopeful; shall they be&#xD;
abandoned to the miserable fate which seems to&#xD;
stretch forth its arms to enfold them? No, no !&#xD;
they must be befriended and rescued, although&#xD;
a score of Mark Donhead's knaves perish !"&#xD;
exclaimed the beggar..&#xD;
"I feel the force of your reasonings," re-&#xD;
plied Albert, "and though I have a strong de-&#xD;
sire to avert bloodshed, I will no longer oppose&#xD;
you.  Act as circumstances may require ; for&#xD;
I am convinced that you have a deeper know-&#xD;
ledge of these matters than I. That you are&#xD;
other than what you profess to bel doubt not;&#xD;
and that you have powerful motives for what&#xD;
you do, must be equally true. Caprice, and&#xD;
love of excitement alone, could not prompt.you&#xD;
to brave danger and death; but I will not pene-&#xD;

Without making any reply, Strolling Willie,&#xD;
pressed against the wall where the 'door was&#xD;
concealed,; a -cold and damp currentt of air&#xD;
rushed in from the cavern, nearly extinguish-&#xD;

"Hark !" whispered Albert. "Ihear some&#xD;

agi xediftently uponteheggatand the  lark&#xD;

aperture.  He felt icy chills creeping over him,&#xD;
and heard his own heart beating with unwonted&#xD;
vigor.  He would have withdrawn his gaze&#xD;
from the statue-like figure of the mendicant,&#xD;
but he could not ; some resistless spell seemed&#xD;
to rivet them upon the mysterious man. He&#xD;
would have moved his limbs, and shook off the&#xD;
trance-like power that bound him in its iron&#xD;
chains; he would have looked up towards the&#xD;
dawning skies of morning, but they were shut&#xD;
out from his vision by dark and impenetrable&#xD;
walls; he would have felt upon his forehead a&#xD;
single touch of the balmy zephyr that kisses the&#xD;
earth with the first streaks of daylight ; but the&#xD;
cold and chilling damps rushing in 'from the&#xD;
cavern, fell upon his face like the breath of the&#xD;
angel of death.&#xD;
The intruder advanced ; he evidently per-&#xD;
ceived that some person had recently been there,&#xD;
and the fact of finding the secret door open ob-&#xD;
viously surprised him for a moment ; for he&#xD;
paused an instant as if not quite decided in re-&#xD;
gard to the propriety of proceeding, wiiout&#xD;
first sorttinising the locality.  ring that&#xD;
brief interval, the-stroller remained in-the .aan&#xD;
stern and moveless attitude ; his =,right .hand&#xD;
still clutchingf ,something- beneath :the tattered&#xD;

Casside's breath seemed to be suspended,:&#xD;
arid he made ;another strong effort to, tear his&#xD;
gae' from the fired form of the oldmana.&#xD;
The- ind vision of the individual in the-pas-&#xD;
sage was of short duration; he c-ame - forward&#xD;
with t a-quickFacid confident steps and instantly:&#xD;
his-figure darkened the  aperture.  Willie bent&#xD;

Albert saw a momeritary'glimmering of steel'.&#xD;

groan.  The icy spell that bound 'him  was&#xD;

&#xD;
He stooped and took the lamp from the earth&#xD;
and obeyed the summons. The stroller had&#xD;
already passed into the cavern, and our hero&#xD;
followed. '"-&#xD;
-- "Close the door," added Willie, in a low&#xD;
voice. "Press upon that part of the wall'at&#xD;
your right, upon which are finger marks. There&#xD;
that is right ; now we are ready to go on again.&#xD;
Step softly, and all will yet be well. The. as-&#xD;
sassin is powerless to do us harm; ,the pulsa&#xD;
tions of his heart have ceased."&#xD;
Casside looked up, and perceived that the&#xD;
beggar was carrying the body of Herbault in&#xD;
his arms ; but he made no- comment upon what&#xD;
he had witnessed, and the strangely mated pair&#xD;
threaded the labyrinth most silently. Although&#xD;
of a bold at.d adventurous -nature, the young&#xD;
man could not well repress feelings of anxiety&#xD;
in regard to the results; he eQuld not help&#xD;
picturing to himself the catastrophe that would&#xD;
ensue, should they meet any of the followers of&#xD;
Mark Donhead.&#xD;
Presently they reached the banditti's place&#xD;
of interment, and the mendicant laid his ghastly&#xD;
burden down beside the new-made grave, which&#xD;
marked the resting-place of the traitor. -&#xD;
" A part of the danger is met and overcome,"&#xD;
resumed Willie ; "but something yet remains&#xD;
to be done; this body must be concealed."&#xD;
" It must now be near morning," said Albert,&#xD;
"4and but little time is left us for deliberation ;&#xD;
we must think and act quickly. Ere long some&#xD;
of the banditti will be astir." ,     "&#xD;
. 'You speak reasonably," returned Willie ;&#xD;
"but ewe must first consign this: clod to its&#xD;
kindred clods. . There must be somewhere here-&#xD;
abouts, apick and mattock, .which are used in&#xD;
digging graves. We will remove a portion-of&#xD;
the earth from, the remains -of this last sleeper,&#xD;
and place near him this carrion to 'keep him&#xD;
company.   Ah ! you remensber, perhaps,'that&#xD;
once told you that life was changeful; now&#xD;
reflect, and tell me if I was not right ?"&#xD;
"You spoke like an oracle," replied Albert;&#xD;
"but let that pass.  Let us attend to this awful&#xD;
business with as much despatch as possible."&#xD;
At that moment the sound of a bell 9ehoed&#xD;
&#xD;
in heavy undulations through the cavern. Wil-&#xD;
I lie dropped the mattock and turned a startled&#xD;
look rpon his companion.&#xD;
"It is to summon the band I" he said, in&#xD;
answer to the inquiring glance of his companion.&#xD;
"The burial of this carcase must be delayed&#xD;
until midnight, and then we will give it .ps deep&#xD;
a grave at it could expect under the circum-&#xD;
- stances. a.las ! Herbault," he added, senti-&#xD;
- mentally, "you were a villain in life, but I&#xD;
bear you no malice now you are dead."&#xD;
"Can you not think of some spot where this&#xD;
piece of work may remain undispvered for a&#xD;
day ?"&#xD;
" That is the very subject upon which I am&#xD;
considering; let me see ; ah! now I, have it;&#xD;
but a few steps from here is just the place. I&#xD;
must lift this poor rascal again. This way-.-&#xD;
this way."&#xD;
The beggar caught up the body and walked&#xD;
hastily across the subterranean cemetery, and&#xD;
stooping until he was nearly double, entered a&#xD;
small passage only large enough to admit one&#xD;
person at a time, and then in the position al-&#xD;
ready named.    The stroller worked his way&#xD;
along in the best manner he was able, -encum-&#xD;
bered with his heavy burden, and finally deposit-&#xD;
ed it upon the earth, and crept back again to&#xD;
the side of our hero.&#xD;
"Can you see any telltale spots upon me-?"&#xD;
he asked, of the latter.&#xD;
" Your doublet is stained," answered Albert,&#xD;
in a low tone.&#xD;
"I will be careful that no other eyes ever&#xD;
look upon it," continued Willie.- " Now, my.&#xD;
lad, put on a bold and cheerful front and let&#xD;
us back to your quarters that you may join&#xD;
the merry men of Captain Mark, at their morn..&#xD;
ing meal,.as though nothing extraordinary had&#xD;
happened."&#xD;
Without fartherconversation they glided along&#xD;
the silent arches of the sub-mundane corridor,&#xD;
and -reached, without- accident, the -apart nent&#xD;
from whence they had issued someitwo hours&#xD;
previously ; where Wandering Willie shook&#xD;
hands with Albert and parted from him.&#xD;
Casside sat down upon his couch ; but he&#xD;

W    HEN    they were' seated at the table,&#xD;
.~ -Mark resumed ; " In a few days, you&#xD;
will be permitted (providing your conduct gives&#xD;
satisfaction) the liberty of the cavern ; but when&#xD;
that time arrives, I warn you against meddling&#xD;
with matters which do not directly concern you,&#xD;
and especially to remain silent upon the subject&#xD;
of Lady Eveline; otherwise, you will bring down&#xD;
upon you the hatred of Godfrey Ridenger."&#xD;
"One of two things is clearly evident," re-&#xD;
joined Albert; "you either fear this Godfrey&#xD;
Ridenger, or are, in some manner, placed in his&#xD;
power."&#xD;
"Fear him!" exclaimed the captain, fiercely,&#xD;
striking his fist violently upon the table. "I&#xD;
tell you, I fear no one ! Be less free in your&#xD;
speech. Those words had they been uttered in-&#xD;
the presence of others might have.- cost you&#xD;
dearly."&#xD;
"Speak without reserve, captain," added&#xD;
Albert, sarcastically, "'we are alone."&#xD;
The bandit chief looked fixedly at the imper.&#xD;
turbable features of our herb, and after a little&#xD;
time continued his discourse.&#xD;
" We are meditating some bold--."'&#xD;
&#xD;
"Robberies," suggested Albert, coolly.&#xD;
Mark frowned and went on.&#xD;
"We are meditating some bold movements,&#xD;
which will require much skill and address ; and&#xD;
I mean that you shall commence your career as&#xD;
soon as possible, in order that we may not be&#xD;
obliged to practise with you those precautions&#xD;
which are always thought necessary with new&#xD;
members of the band. We have heard a rumor&#xD;
that some knights who were robbed in the for-&#xD;
est a few days, ago, are about to make an at-&#xD;
tempt to exterminate each and all of us, with&#xD;
two or three score of men-at-arms. So you see&#xD;
there is some prospect of excellent sport, in&#xD;
which you may freely indulge in your favorite&#xD;
passion for breaking heads, and giving delicate&#xD;
sword cuts. Say, my lad, how does this news&#xD;
affect you?"&#xD;
" It puts me in excellent spirits.  Give me&#xD;
your hand !" cried Albert, feigning to be much&#xD;
elated, and favoring Mark Donhead's hand with&#xD;
powerful squeeze. A lively conversation was&#xD;
kept up between the parties until the morning&#xD;
meal was despatched, when father David made&#xD;
his appearance.&#xD;

" Right, Vidal, right ; the afirs shall not&#xD;

for this to come off."&#xD;
" To-morrow night will suit me as well as a&#xD;

"The arrangement pleases me ; let it be so ;&#xD;

could I wish? It is true that society has se)&#xD;

the applaudling shouts of the wondering multi-&#xD;

wise sayings in the mouth of Peter Vidal be-&#xD;

sophical head of yours will yet carry you into&#xD;
trouble."&#xD;
With a sinister smile upon his hard, wiry&#xD;
lips, Vidal opened the door and departed from&#xD;
the monk's hut, his brain teeming with visions&#xD;
of golden fiorins.&#xD;

manly projects of the bandit chief," said the&#xD;
monk.&#xD;
' either conversation was prevented between&#xD;
Elie two, by the authoritative voice of Mark&#xD;
summoning them from their hiding-place.&#xD;
"I'have attended'to the business which"was&#xD;
uppermost in my mind,:r he said, " and now we&#xD;
will to the, Silver Bell, to tire ourselves a little&#xD;
relaxation-over Joachimi Oapet's best wine."&#xD;
But few words were spoken by either par-&#xD;
ties on their way to .the inn. Joachim Capet&#xD;
met his visitors upon the threshold with his&#xD;
usual urbanity of manner, and ran over his&#xD;
usual catalogue of great names with accustomed&#xD;
volubility. That he recognized Mark Donhead&#xD;
snd the monk, there could be no doubt ; but&#xD;
that he did not recognize Casside was equally&#xD;
certain; for he had drawn the hood of his domi-&#xD;
no close over his features.&#xD;
" We would have a room to ourselves," said,&#xD;
Mark, "and our holy calling will not prevent&#xD;
us from tasting some of your-oldest and choicest&#xD;
vintag'e." With bows and smiles the master&#xD;
of the Silver Bell ushered the three monks into&#xD;
the chamber which Casside had so recently visit-&#xD;
d, and where he had passed some of the most&#xD;
unliappy hours of his existence.&#xD;
Wine was immediately' placed before them;&#xD;
but Mark Donhead appeared ill at ease, and&#xD;
aStt swallowing, hurriedly, a few cups of the&#xD;
sparkling beverage, arose and abruptly left his&#xD;
&#xD;
companions, saying that' he would return in a&#xD;
ahort tiine.&#xD;
Albert wag about to speak freely in regard to&#xD;
the subjects in which he felt so deeply inter-&#xD;
ested ; but a significantly gesture from father&#xD;
David deterred him.&#xD;
"This isno place to talk concerning impor-&#xD;
tant secrets ; these walls have ears to hear and&#xD;
tongues to betray us," whispered the monk.&#xD;
'he .table had beef placed against the wall&#xD;
near the spot where Albert and the stroller had&#xD;
heard the 'conversation between the knight and&#xD;
his squire, and the mind of the former naturally&#xD;
recurred to-the subject which had then been&#xD;
discussed. He felt an intense desire to meet&#xD;
the person who passed under the assumed name&#xD;
of Godfrey IRidenger, and provoke him to an&#xD;
encounter, in order to do him such personal&#xD;
harm as might most effectually prevent him&#xD;
from carrying out his nefarious schemes in'rela-&#xD;
tion to Lady Eveline. Knowing, as he now&#xD;
did, the true name and character of this person,&#xD;
he was fully conscious of Eiu power to exert a&#xD;
strong influence in whatever direction he was&#xD;
disposed to turn his attention. His armeaculd&#xD;
indeed reach all over the kingdom, and crush&#xD;
his- enemies with -scarcely an effort, with little&#xD;
regard to their rank or condition.&#xD;
While these°thoughts were passing through&#xD;
Albert's brain, a heayy step was heard advanc-&#xD;
ing, and presently the door wasthrown open.&#xD;
A man entered, and the subject-of his medita-&#xD;
tions stood; before him.&#xD;
&#xD;
mination of a certain business upon which a few&#xD;
trusty fellows of our fraternity had been sent.&#xD;
I have always been reputed' a gallant gentleman,&#xD;
and a devout admirer of dames and damsels."&#xD;
"Who that knows the daring Godfrey Riden-&#xD;
ger, will presume to .dispute his claims to gal=&#xD;
lantry ?'' said the monk. "But pardon wy&#xD;
want of hospitality ; here is' some of Joachim&#xD;
Capet's best vintage. Let us drink success to&#xD;
the pretty love adventure now fast hastening to&#xD;
a happy consummation. You have doubtless&#xD;
heard ere this that the proud maiden is already&#xD;
caged ?"&#xD;
" Yes, the pleasant news reached me some&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
GODFREY RIDENGER.&#xD;
&#xD;
f&#xD;
&#xD;
HEN Albert perceived that some one&#xD;
was about to enter, he drew the hood&#xD;
of his domino more closely about his face, and&#xD;
when he saw the figure of Sir Hugh Spencer,&#xD;
alias Godfrey Ridenger, he congratulated him-&#xD;
self that he had taken that precaution. He&#xD;
hesitated an instant, and seemed inclined to&#xD;
offer some apology for his intrusion, and with-&#xD;
draw'; but his eye resting upon father David,&#xD;
put an end to his indecision.&#xD;
" This is an  unexpected  pleasure, holy&#xD;
father," said Sir Hugh, affecting a very res&#xD;
peetful air.&#xD;
It is as ,unexpected on my part as on&#xD;
yours," replied the monk. "To put you out&#xD;
of all uncertainty, this young man belongs to&#xD;
the brotherhood, and you may speak freely be-&#xD;
fore him; I will answer for his fidelity. The'&#xD;
captain reposes great confidence in him. How&#xD;
is it that you have returned so much sooner than&#xD;
you expected ?"&#xD;
"My movements have been influenced by&#xD;
various'causes," returned Ridenger.  "But to&#xD;
tell the truth, I was anxious to learn the ter-&#xD;

&#xD;
she in consenting mood. As for my past gal-&#xD;
lantries, they should be repented of, and never&#xD;
repeated; and on the whole, I. think I would&#xD;
become a sort of sober philosopher-a wise owl&#xD;
to hoot at the failings and moral aberrations of&#xD;
others. My good monk, there is nothing like&#xD;
reform when one is sated with enjoyments, and&#xD;
has a.constitution which is shattered by dissipa-&#xD;
tion.  Upon my word ! I could sit down and&#xD;
read you a good sermon extempore ; and if.&#xD;
good, what matter where it comes from., We&#xD;
must not look at the origin of things, but at&#xD;
things themselves.  There was Solomon ; a&#xD;
man reputed exceedingly wise ; but yet not wise&#xD;
Enough to break off his follies in time to prevent&#xD;
the consequences, save his poor body from aches&#xD;
and pains, and his conscience from periodical&#xD;
convulsions. 9 That celebrated sage did not dis-&#xD;
cover that 'all was vanity beneath "the sun,'&#xD;
until his debaucheries had rendered him mis-&#xD;
erable, and no longer able to enjoy the sweets&#xD;
of existence."&#xD;
"Heaven obviously intended you for the&#xD;
church," answered David.. .'&#xD;
Heaven might have had such intentions,&#xD;
but the whole thing was evidently a failure,"&#xD;
added Sir Hugh, with a laugh.&#xD;
" Perhaps not, perhaps not," replied David.&#xD;
"It is hard to tell what a man will be, before&#xD;
he gets through with life ; it is easier to tell&#xD;
What he has been, after he is dead."&#xD;
"It appears* that the exploits of 'a certain&#xD;
Mark.Donhead are at this-time producing some&#xD;
excitement in Dorsetshire, and other portions of&#xD;
the country ; and it may interest you to know&#xD;
that six hundred forms- have been offered for&#xD;
that portion of his person situated immediately&#xD;
above his shoulders--a, part, which, I fancy, he&#xD;
would be loth to e ebange for even that sum,&#xD;
although I much doubt whether it does not&#xD;
tempt the cupidity of some of his merry&#xD;
knaves."&#xD;
"ILittle fear of that,"said the monk, quickly.&#xD;
" Iquery whetherthere is one among them who&#xD;
would betray him for twice that amount of filthy&#xD;
lucre.&#xD;
"'I will add that I have heard' there is some&#xD;
&#xD;
prospect that the band will be harassed by a&#xD;
strong body of men-at-arms," resumed Sir Hugh.&#xD;
"However, I have other matters to engross my&#xD;
attention at present ; I have fair lady to woo,&#xD;
and I must prepare myself to appear in her&#xD;
presence in a manner most likely to disarm her&#xD;
anger. I must exhibit such a degree of contri-&#xD;
tion as shall excite her pity ; I must be the&#xD;
most penitent of men; the most self-condemned&#xD;
of mortals ; the most humble of human beings;&#xD;
more abject in my self-abasement-than the rep-&#xD;
tile that crawls upon the earth. Yes, by St.&#xD;
Simon ! there is but one way in which I can&#xD;
appear before that peerless beauty ; and that&#xD;
is, as a criminal, as an offender against the laws&#xD;
that govern social etiquette,; as a violator of&#xD;
the rules of human society ;- as one who has aout-&#xD;
raged forbearance and common decency ; as one&#xD;
adjudgedby the mouth of morality to be vile,&#xD;
viler, vilest."&#xD;
Sir Hugh Spencer pressed his hand thought-&#xD;
fully toshis forehead and paused a moment.  He&#xD;
then added, in muchthe same tone :&#xD;
"But the Lady.Eveline has, in some    qar&#xD;
sure, brought this upon herself. In ranks,and&#xD;
fortune I was far above her when I first made&#xD;
suit to her in the courtly words of a gallant&#xD;
knight and a' courteous gentleman. To. tier&#xD;
refusal, she may justly attribute this misfortune;&#xD;
if misfortune it can be called ; and I'll be sword&#xD;
the foolish maiden considers it as such. Bui#t&#xD;
will be honorable, by the virgin, I will-be hon-&#xD;
orable before Iam vindictive ; I will renew the&#xD;
offers that she scorned in other days. She Ni&#xD;
not--she dare not--do otherwise than accede tq&#xD;
my wishes. I can raise her to a place of power;&#xD;
whose heights will almost make her dizzy; ,and&#xD;
I can crush her tq a depth of degradation, that&#xD;
would madden her to contemplate even ii the&#xD;
distance."&#xD;
Godfrey   idenger uttered these words ener-&#xD;
getically, and stamped upon the floor to give&#xD;
them emphasis.&#xD;
"Come, father David, fill this cup once more,&#xD;
and.I will leave you.  That will do; long lfe&#xD;
to you. I hope your companion is discreet;&#xD;
if he is not, he had better be dangling from thq&#xD;
&#xD;
tallest tree in Donhead Wood than be here."&#xD;
And turning upon his heel, the friend, compan-&#xD;
ion, and leader of banditti, strode from the&#xD;
chamber.&#xD;
"What think you of that, my friend ?" ex-&#xD;
claimed David, when Sir Hugh had disappear-&#xD;
ed4 "'Have not the last few moments given you&#xD;
a deeper insight into the character of the second&#xD;
in command ?"&#xD;
a I acknowledge that they have ; but I knew&#xD;
him- but too well before," said Albert.  "Al-&#xD;
low inc to leave you for an instant; I will re-&#xD;
turn directly."&#xD;
"By no means whatever !" cried the Inonk.&#xD;
"It 'is against the regulations concerning new&#xD;
members.   Such an act would provoke the&#xD;
anger of our worthy captain."&#xD;
" It shall be mine to shield you from all&#xD;
blame," returned Albert. "I am resolved ;&#xD;
do not attempt to hinder me. I would not do&#xD;
violence to one who has shown himself friendly ;&#xD;
but I warn you not to lay your hand upon me&#xD;
to detain me. I shall strike--by Heaven, I&#xD;
shall strike! 'All the powers of -the infernal re-&#xD;
giens, 'with Captain Mark at their head, could&#xD;
not keep me here a moment longer. Give way-&#xD;
E go !"&#xD;
.Dashing the, monk from him, as though he&#xD;
had been a mere child, the young man sprang&#xD;
from the room. He closed the door after him,&#xD;
and perceiving that it could be bolted on the&#xD;
outsidedeliberately fastened father David in ;&#xD;
then tJkowing off his domino, he passed on to&#xD;
the chamber adjoining, burst it open with a blow&#xD;
of hi. foot, and very unceremoniously entered.&#xD;
Sir Hugh Spencer had just crossed the apart-&#xD;
menit, and was looking from the window towards&#xD;
the forest, when our hero made his unexpected&#xD;
ady4nt ; the noise consequent upon the latter's&#xD;
movements caused him to turn quickly towards&#xD;
the intruder, who was careful to close the -door,&#xD;
as though apprehensive that the object of his&#xD;
wrath'would attempt to escape.&#xD;
The knight started with surprise, And his&#xD;
cheek flushed with indignation. Sudden as the&#xD;
gleam of the angry lightning, Albert's sword&#xD;
leaped from his sheath.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Most villanous of villains ! draw and de-&#xD;
fetd yourself 1"&#xD;
Sir Hugh needed no second bidding ; he&#xD;
drew his weapon from its scabbard, exclaiming :&#xD;
" Presumptuous hind ! base born peasant !&#xD;
this time you shall not escape me so easily"&#xD;
"Boastnot-boast not, black-hearted wretchl!&#xD;
but look well to yourself," returned Casside.&#xD;
For a;fewseconds the two men fought with&#xD;
desperate daring and deadly determination.&#xD;
The frantic fury of the knight was met by&#xD;
the cool and consummate skill of Albert. An&#xD;
unguarded movement on the part of the former&#xD;
left a portion of his person exposed, and instant&#xD;
ly the 'latter's sword passed into his body,-in-&#xD;
flicting as he believed, a mortal wound.&#xD;
Sir Hugh staggered a few paces and fell to&#xD;
the floor, which was soon stained with the blood&#xD;
that welled from his side. Albert paused .not&#xD;
an instant ; sheathing his sword, he ran from&#xD;
the room, resumed his domino, and rejoined the&#xD;
monk, before he had gone from his side five&#xD;
minutes.&#xD;
" In heaven's name, what mad freak have&#xD;
you been guilty of now !" exclaimed father&#xD;
David, pale with apprehension.&#xD;
"I have' been doing what I shall ever cen-&#xD;
sider it my duty to do, while my arm is endowed&#xD;
with life and strength. I have punished a vil-&#xD;
lain for his crimes; I have smitten one whose&#xD;
evil deedea iave long evoked the vengeance of&#xD;
Heaven," replied the 'young man.   *1 But&#xD;
come," he added, "let us sit calmly down tb&#xD;
our wine 'as 'though nothing had happened.&#xD;
Good father David, let us drink long life'tom&#xD;
to--anybody you will--Stolling Willie, -or&#xD;
instance."&#xD;
" It is -a wise thought," added the monks&#xD;
"And since the deed is done, we must put a&#xD;
good face upon the' matter. So here's a. very&#xD;
long life to those who deserve to livi, and' a&#xD;
speedy death to those who deserve to die."Ey&#xD;
"Very good,' my worthy recluse ; a more&#xD;
comprehensive health could not be quaffed. -'It&#xD;
will be well for us to pretend to be a little heam&#xD;
ed with this vintage, and with argument, when&#xD;
we hear any one approaching. And, by the&#xD;

As wild and headstrong as you are, I per-&#xD;

added, in a low voice, 'I hear the tread of&#xD;

It may readily be imagined' that our hero&#xD;
waited the denouement with considerable inter-&#xD;
est, being himself so intimately concerned in the&#xD;
subject.  The moment the door was heard to&#xD;
swing open, the voice of Joachim Capet was also&#xD;
heard, uttering an exclamation of the most com-&#xD;
plete surprise.&#xD;
Casside and David immediately raised their&#xD;
voices as though in hot dispute, thumped upon&#xD;
the table with their fists, rattled the drinking&#xD;
cups, and gave other appropriate indications of&#xD;
violent controversy upon some polemical matter.&#xD;
The words, "church, indulgences, eucharist,&#xD;
holy sepulchre, virgin Mary, etc.," were vehe-&#xD;
mently articulated, and it is feared in not a&#xD;
very connected manner.  Capet, meantime, ran&#xD;
to the head of the staircase and cried :&#xD;
"Murder-thieves--asgassins !" in, a;stento-&#xD;
nan voice.&#xD;
Immediate   several persons were heard rush.&#xD;
ing up the stairs to see what such dire exclama-&#xD;
tions meant.  Claude, the squire, and Mark&#xD;
Donhead were among the foremost.&#xD;
" What in the name of all the martyrs means&#xD;
this turmoil ?" cried the latter, as he passed&#xD;
Capet in the passage.&#xD;
"It means" answered Joachim, "that mur-&#xD;
der most foul has been perpetrated at the Silver&#xD;

"Not for a single moment," replied father the tones of a drunken. man. He then arose&#xD;

will be able to leave it, without help," answer-  The friar then assisted Albert to rise, and&#xD;
ed the friar.                             partly by force, partly by persuasion, got him&#xD;
" You are both pretty deep in your cups, I upon a bed, and in a few minutes he -was, ap-&#xD;

"It is false-leave the room!" exclaimed sleep that ever fell upon the eyelids of a lover&#xD;
Casside, imitating in a most felicitous manner of the rosy god.&#xD;
&#xD;
I-&#xD;
&#xD;
Hearing the, excited voices of Casside and&#xD;
David, the captain of, the banditti threw open&#xD;
the door and looked in, supposing that the&#xD;
trouble might be there ; but perceiving them&#xD;
earnestly engaged in controversy, he turned in-&#xD;
stantly and ran into the. next chamber, pre-&#xD;
ceded by Claude, and followed by mine host.&#xD;
The cause of the latter's consternation was now&#xD;
fully apparent. Stretched at - full length upon&#xD;
the floor, lay the body of Sir Hugh Spencer, in&#xD;
a pool of blood. Claude Herminger knelt be-&#xD;
side his master and felt his pulse.&#xD;
"Life is not extinct," he said, and than pro-&#xD;
ceeded to examine the wound in his side.&#xD;
" It is deep and dangerous," he added;&#xD;
" and the handthat dealtit knew well the use&#xD;
of the sword. Joachim Capet, let strict search&#xD;
be made for the murderer ; see that he doesnot&#xD;
escape."&#xD;
"This is wondrous strange !" muttered Mark&#xD;
Donhead, assisting Claude to place the knight&#xD;
upon a bed. "I would give a thousand florins&#xD;
to know the perpetrator of this deed."&#xD;
Without pausing to add more, or to hear any&#xD;
rejoinder, the captain-ran quickly to the cham-&#xD;
ber where our hero and the monk still remained,&#xD;
and whose voices -could be distinctly heard&#xD;
rising higher and higher.&#xD;
"Fools !" thundered Mark. "Do you.not&#xD;
hear the uproar-are you deaf to everything but&#xD;
this confounded church nonsense-do you not&#xD;
know what has happened ? Godfrey Ridenger&#xD;
has received a mortal wound !"&#xD;
Albert and the monk turned a pair of amazed&#xD;
faces towards the bandit chief.&#xD;
"You confound me ! how did this happen ?"&#xD;
exclaimed David.&#xD;
"The foul ,fiend only knows !" rejoined&#xD;
Mark, and instantly a new idea seemed to occur&#xD;
to him. He gave the monk a stern and search-&#xD;
ing look.&#xD;
"Tell me, sir," he said, "has this young&#xD;
man left the room since I parted from you an&#xD;
hour ago?"&#xD;

as usual, in the accustomed' place, and he was&#xD;
not sorry to see approaching the old woman,&#xD;
who had told such fine things concerning him&#xD;
on another occasion ; for he believed a good&#xD;
opportunity now offered to learn the particulars&#xD;
in relation to the good fortune in reserve for&#xD;
him.&#xD;
* Elsie drew near.&#xD;
Well, my good lad," she said, "I told you&#xD;
that we might, perchance, see each other again.&#xD;
Where is your sister?"&#xD;
"She is at the cottage ; but I expect her&#xD;
here soon," replied the boy.&#xD;
Perhaps you remember that I made the&#xD;
remark that I was seldom seen twice in the same&#xD;
place, without I had strong reasons for my re-&#xD;
appearance. I have things to say to you both&#xD;
of vital importance; and what I say, Imust&#xD;
say quickly, for there is no time to lose-the&#xD;
voices are calling me another way.  Isandra is&#xD;
in grewidanger ; designing men meditate much&#xD;
mischief against her. Bit their plans must be&#xD;
baffed.--their schemes must fail-their counsels&#xD;
come to nought.  You are, a brave and active&#xD;
youth, and must be the instrument employed to&#xD;
have her from the evil purposes of bad inen,"&#xD;
added Elsie, with an earnestness of manner that&#xD;
eased Louis  to stave at her with astonishment.&#xD;
"I know, wise mother," answered the lad,&#xD;
"that Isandra.is unhappy, and that my father&#xD;
has proposed a:husband for her who is detesta.&#xD;
ble to her sight ; and if that is the fate from&#xD;
which you are anxious to save-her, there is noth-&#xD;
ing which I will not do to bring about such a&#xD;
desirable event. Look i she is o6niing.1"&#xD;
14It is to that intended marriage that I re-&#xD;
fer  r esaumed the Sibyl; "and when Isandra&#xD;
has joined us, I will speak more 'plainly upon&#xD;
the subjecot.",&#xD;
In a- short time the fair shepherdess stood&#xD;
beside Elsie and Louis.&#xD;
" This woman," said the latter to the maiden,&#xD;
asaya , that'she.has something of importance to&#xD;
communicate that concerns us'deeply.&#xD;
"'Speak on, Xlsie," iaifl Isanda.&#xD;
"I will," said the sibylla, solemnly; "for I&#xD;
have come to adviseayou of the wicked art of&#xD;
&#xD;
base and unscrupulous persons. I know 'this&#xD;
man whom your father has selected to be your&#xD;
companion through the journey of life ; I know&#xD;
him to be so opposite to you in character, that&#xD;
another could not be found so widely different,;&#xD;
I know him to, be a man of.niany crimes, upon&#xD;
whose head justice has set her reward."&#xD;
"Do you mean Denis Wetzel?" asked&#xD;
Isandra.&#xD;
"Yes, yes! Denis WetzelI" returned Elsie,&#xD;
emphatically.&#xD;
"Then comfort yourself, good sibyl, for the&#xD;
proposed'union will never take place," rejoined&#xD;
the maiden, earnestly; "I will never consent&#xD;
to bestow my hand on Denis Wetzel."&#xD;
"Never consent! - Silly girl! you -know&#xD;
little of the power of the man who has given&#xD;
you the promise of so many golden flrirns.&#xD;
Your consent will not have much to do with&#xD;
the matter. Might can overcome right ; priests&#xD;
can mumble ceremonies, even:though they fall&#xD;
on unconscious ears. A plot is already- laid&#xD;
for your abduction."&#xD;
"Are you indeed speaking what you know?&#xD;
or are those words but insane mutterings, hava&#xD;
ing little or no meaning'?" cried Isandra, be-&#xD;
coming very 'pale.&#xD;
"I am speaking advisedly, calmly, rationally.&#xD;
I weigh every word-~I know what I say, and&#xD;
what I would do. I have not come hither bymere&#xD;
chance,' but by design, with a settled purpose.&#xD;
Listen to me -no 'longer as a man or woman,&#xD;
but hear   n me asa responsible being. To-morrow&#xD;
night isithe time fixed'upon to carry out 'these&#xD;
nefarious schemes. Upon some idle pretext,&#xD;
Peter Vidal-I will not call him your father-&#xD;
will send you from the  cottage. You will be&#xD;
et by several persons-delegated for that pu-&#xD;
pose, and forcibly carried to the place which&#xD;
Denis Wetzel calls his home, where a monk will&#xD;
profane the marriage ceremony by repeating'it&#xD;
in your presence ; thus 'making you the  wife of&#xD;
a man whom 'you detest."&#xD;
Isandra listened to these strange' declarations&#xD;
witi s gereasing trepidation, and wag obliged,&#xD;
when the-sibyl ceased, to cling to Louis for&#xD;
support.&#xD;

in a great fury; but I do not believe he will b&#xD;
disposed to do you serious harm.' Do you un&#xD;
derstand me perfectly'?"&#xD;
"I do, if he does not," replied Isandra&#xD;
quickly. "My mind grasps all tihe threads o&#xD;
the tangled skein ; I perceive all the details o&#xD;
the, subjects, so far as concerns the disguise o&#xD;
Louis, and the instructions which are to gover&#xD;
his conduct.  I will teach him how to act, an&#xD;
wlat to say; I will see that in the matter o&#xD;
dress he resembles me as much as one perso&#xD;
can look like another ; and trust me all sha&#xD;
be done with skill and promptness, and th&#xD;
emergency met in precisely the way you desire&#xD;
My intuitions are quick ; I have a clear percel&#xD;
&#xD;
69&#xD;
&#xD;
tion of what must be done, to make the artifice&#xD;
succeed. -But proceed ; tell me what course I&#xD;
shall pursue after Louis has left me.&#xD;
"Having put on the garments of your brother,&#xD;
return/ to the cottage and retire to bed with as&#xD;
little ado as possible. When you reach the cot:&#xD;
tage, if you perceive a man within, do not enter&#xD;
until he is gone ; if not, enter boldly, as I have&#xD;
said. Should you see a small bag upon the&#xD;
table, or m your father's possession, know that&#xD;
it contains five hundred forms in gold ; and&#xD;
that it comes from Denis Wetzel, in payment&#xD;
for a young and innocent maiden,"&#xD;
"Your manner," rejoined Isandra, "assures&#xD;
me of your sincerity. Your instructions shall&#xD;
be implicitly followed. But I would ask one&#xD;
more question; upon whose head will the anger&#xD;
of my father fall, when he learns the deception&#xD;
that has been practised ?,&#xD;
"Not upon yours, not upon yours ; leave&#xD;
that subject to other hands. God will, perad.&#xD;
venture, raise up a friend to protect you.  He&#xD;
clothes the lilies, and he cares for the sparrows ;&#xD;
will he, then,'desert those who are of morevalue&#xD;
than the lilies and the sparrows'? No, no I&#xD;
Weird Elsie, in. her wanderings has not found&#xD;
it so."&#xD;
"And yet one more question'?" resumed&#xD;
Isandra..&#xD;
"Speak, daughter," said Elsie.&#xD;
h "What will become of Louis? willihis lifebe&#xD;
ein danger'?"&#xD;
e    " I hope not-that is, I believe not," return&#xD;
- ed the sibylla, with some. embarrassment of&#xD;
manner.  " A friend may be raised up to him,&#xD;
, also. Who knows? the ways of Providence&#xD;
f are mysterious. No, no I Denis Wetzel dare&#xD;
f not; kill the lad."&#xD;
f   " It had better be me than her " exclaimed&#xD;
n  Louis, warmly.  .h                       i&#xD;
d    " God, bless you, my noble youth! You&#xD;
of well deserve to be a belted knight ; and so you&#xD;
a will bei or I am no prophetess. Adieu, el-&#xD;
11 dren, I must go."&#xD;
But will you not come to us again, kind&#xD;
a. Elsie?" :asked the lad. j.'&#xD;
-   "I cannot tell; my own future is not always&#xD;
&#xD;
pain before me.  Sometimes the darkiess&#xD;
closet down upon my path, and I cannot see'&#xD;
clearly; and the voices that speak unto.me so'&#xD;
often, admonish me that I must not live for my.&#xD;
self; nor seek to know coming events concern-&#xD;
ing'myself, but concerning others. . My calling&#xD;
is not a selfish one ; a single selfish act would&#xD;
'deprive me of my power ; the threads of des-&#xD;
tiny would slip from my hands and be lost ; I&#xD;
could ,not gather them up again. No, no; the&#xD;
thread of my own life is not among those that&#xD;
guide my wanderings, and direct my efforts.&#xD;
Be assured tlkat I shall appear before you again,&#xD;
when a feeble hand like mine can assist you ;&#xD;
till then-'be content, nor expect me until you see&#xD;
me." -&#xD;
the monk, or Weird Elsie, as we have called&#xD;
him,.'in this character, said no more, but direct-&#xD;
ed his footsteps toward Donhead Wood, leaving&#xD;
Isaadra and Louis to marvel at what' they had&#xD;
heard, and to tremble with apprehension when&#xD;
they thought of the future.&#xD;
While the scene we have just been describ-&#xD;
ing was taking place, Albert Casside still, con-&#xD;
tinued, to all outward appearance, to be enjoy-&#xD;
ing a most refreshing slumber. The bustle in&#xD;
the adjoining room had subsided.  The wound&#xD;
of Sir Hugh had been dressed and pronounced&#xD;
of a dangerous nature, and he still continued in&#xD;
a state that precluded the possibility of learn-&#xD;
ing from his own lips for the present, the author&#xD;
of his misfortune. The Silver Bell had been&#xD;
made the subject of a rigorous search, by Joa-&#xD;
chim Capet and Mark, but without throwing&#xD;
any light upon the mysterious transaction ; so&#xD;
they were obliged to' content themselves with&#xD;
conjectures and vague speculations in regard to,&#xD;
the afair-"&#xD;
Capet averred that if a certain young man&#xD;
had been there (whom he would not disgrace&#xD;
himself by calling by name), he should have&#xD;
very well known to whom to attribute the deed ;&#xD;
for said youngster was of a temperament to&#xD;
commit murder, or to perpetrate any enormity&#xD;
that a human being could be guilty of.-&#xD;
Upon being asked'by Donhead if he did not&#xD;
refer to Albert Casside, he unhesitatingly re-&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
'SHE ,SILVElBELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
plied that'he did ; and had not spoken without&#xD;
good reason.&#xD;
"And the strongest of your reasons, doubt-&#xD;
less, are those black and blue spots which I see&#xD;
over and under your eyes, and upon various.&#xD;
parts of your face," said'Donhead, with 'a mali-&#xD;
cious smile.&#xD;
"There is not," returned Joachim, "'such a&#xD;
hardened wreteh among all. your fellows. I&#xD;
never was handled so roughly during my whole&#xD;
life ; he showered such a storm of blows upon&#xD;
me that Iverily thought my last hourhad'eome ;&#xD;
and when he.left me, I was such a shocking.&#xD;
spectacle, that my own mother would' not have&#xD;
acknowledged me' for her own' son. Among&#xD;
gentle or simple; I never saw such a fiery and&#xD;
impetuous youngster ; and though chary of hiS&#xD;
words, his fists are always at one's 'service."&#xD;
"In the case of Godfrey Ridenger," said the&#xD;
chief of the banditti, " I think your rustic youth&#xD;
must be innocent ; and it were indeed hard to&#xD;
animadvert upon one, who, for aught you know,&#xD;
is an hundred leagues from here. But to change&#xD;
the  subject :  Are those two proud-looking&#xD;
cavaliers, who lost their florins in the forest, a&#xD;
few days ago, still your guests'?"&#xD;
"I am momentarily expecting them," return-&#xD;
ed Capet. "Their servants' brought.me- word&#xD;
that they should pass the night here. The tine&#xD;
that has intervened since they were here, they&#xD;
have spent at Motcombe Manor ; and indeed&#xD;
they were of the hunting party upon that occa-&#xD;
sion when Lady Eveline 'so strangely disap-&#xD;
peared."&#xD;
" Now, Joachim Capet, you begin to interest&#xD;
me," resumed Mark, earnestly. "If I mistake&#xD;
not, those two cavaliers were of high rank ; and&#xD;
I have a presentiment that we. shall yet hear&#xD;
from them in a manner not agreeable. I wish&#xD;
Satan had flown away with Yorick and his com-&#xD;
rades, before they had' unluckily encountered&#xD;
and robbed them in the forest: Have you learn-&#xD;
ed by any travellers from that direction, wheth-&#xD;
er these unknown gentlemen have interested&#xD;
themselves in that affair of Ridenger's-the&#xD;
vexatious abduction of the lord's daughter ?"&#xD;

Travellers don't often escape without talking&#xD;
more than they ought to, when Joachim Capet'&#xD;
gets hold of them. I have good authority for&#xD;
spying that the two noble cavaliers, who were&#xD;
robbed of their florins, who stopped at the Sil-&#xD;
ver Bell, who despatched a trusty messenger&#xD;
for men-at-arms in order to punish Mark Don.&#xD;
head, who were of the hunting party ;eferred to&#xD;
when the Lady Eveline was stolen, have inter-&#xD;
ested themselves most deeply and seriously in&#xD;
the matter ; and it is rumored, furthermore,&#xD;
that it is by their agency that a reward of six&#xD;
hundred florins has been offered for your head."&#xD;
" It will cost whoever gets my head more than&#xD;
that I" replied Mark, sternly. - "Let them&#xD;
come, I say," and the robber chief played ner-&#xD;
vously with the hilt of his sword. " But, Ca-&#xD;
&#xD;
pet," he resumed, hastily, "we must be oau-&#xD;
tious. This last act of daring, into which the&#xD;
folly of -Sir Hugh has inveigled us, I plainly&#xD;
foresee will raise a dangerous storm, whicliwe&#xD;
must be prepared to meet like men. Be cir-&#xD;
eumspect in your treatment of travellers; play&#xD;
well the host. Preserve the important secrets&#xD;
connected with the Silver Bell, as carefully as&#xD;
you do the precious sands of your own life.&#xD;
Let them once be whispered to the winds, and&#xD;
the arm of our power will well nigh be broken.&#xD;
Yes, I warn you to be discreet ; I am watching&#xD;
you. Should your folly or your cupidity betray&#xD;
us, remember that there are two hundred dag-&#xD;
gers ready to draw your blood; and that te es-&#xD;
cape the vengeance of the order, will be an at-&#xD;
tainment utterly impossible.  So, Joachim Ca-&#xD;
pet, let that fact be an everlasting admonition&#xD;
in yourears."&#xD;
&#xD;
F there was any sound under heaven that&#xD;
could attract the attention of Albert Cas-&#xD;
side, and endow arm and brain with activity, it&#xD;
was the clashing of swords. For him there&#xD;
was music in the ringing of steel blades ; a kind&#xD;
of music which invariably affected him with the,&#xD;
f ghting mania. Therefore, upon hearing the&#xD;
noise of a contest in the ,ard, in front of the&#xD;
inn, he incontinently leaped from the bed, and&#xD;
Wntowards the scene of the conflict as fast&#xD;
biy limbs could carry him ; oversetting, in his&#xD;
impetuous course, several oficials of mine wor-&#xD;
t: y host, Joachip Capet. But our hero did&#xD;
y  perplex his mind about details ; he had an&#xD;
ye ogily to generelities; a without pausi&#xD;
tqrplogize for the various accidents which his&#xD;
pnexpected:advent produced, be dashed into the&#xD;
yard like a young-ecot, which disdaining dollar&#xD;
and sa4dle throwshis master into the 4itgh, a d&#xD;
llows the dictates of lis 9n4ney..&#xD;
4rrived there, he was much lated to erceve&#xD;
that thee was e. ecellent opportunity to i-&#xD;
44ge in cut and thrust; for two perons were&#xD;
engaged with one slender youth, who, unegual&#xD;
to the contest, was rapidly losing his strength,&#xD;
and yielding ground.&#xD;
&#xD;
To informs the reader that Albert drew his&#xD;
sword from beneath his domino, would be time&#xD;
and words thrown away ; for knowing his hot&#xD;
and headlong; temper, he would conelude at&#xD;
once, without much reflection, that his first act&#xD;
would be to whisk out his weapon in the leapt&#xD;
possible space of time ; whieh was really the&#xD;
case.&#xD;
"Cowardly caitiffst " he exclaimed, making&#xD;
hist blade flash merrily in the sup. "toes it&#xD;
not shame your manhood to attack one sener&#xD;
youth upon whose chin the down hbs scarcely&#xD;
appeared   Come op, cravens, and I wily tech&#xD;

One of the fellows instantly turned and made&#xD;
a furious lunge at Albert ; but he parried it,&#xD;
and in return, gave him a thrust'that stretched&#xD;
bim at his length upon the ground. Hi p'cm&#xD;
panion, seeing how matters were going, topk to&#xD;
his heels and soon disappeared, but noc hcfore&#xD;

scoundrels were getting the best of the bargain,&#xD;
and' I should soon have been entirely at their&#xD;
mercy. Although you wear the garments of&#xD;
holy mother church, you use the sword like a&#xD;
true knight. This service I will not forget ;&#xD;
and if it does not at some future tirpe re-act in&#xD;
your favor, then you may set, -me down as an&#xD;
uncourteous cavalier and an ungrateful gentle-&#xD;
man."    -&#xD;
The courtly manner in which the youth ut-&#xD;
tered these words, declared him to be of some&#xD;
consequence ; and there was an air of superior-&#xD;
ity and authority ,about him which did not ill&#xD;
become him, but sat easily and naturally, like&#xD;
a garment whose first stiffness and awkwardness&#xD;
has been lost by wear.&#xD;
" Such a slight service as this, gentle sir,&#xD;
merits not the kindly acknowledgements whiobh&#xD;
you are disposed to accord, I were indeed a&#xD;
churl, to allow two savage ruffians to murder&#xD;
you," replied Casside.&#xD;
" I know what is due. to gallantry,". added&#xD;
the youth,  and how to be grateful for a kind-&#xD;
. Here, take this ring and wear it fornmy&#xD;
ae; I shall take it i, if you refuse. It may&#xD;
_ltiw atply prove a powerful talisman to save'&#xD;
jou 'from jour 'enemies, or to  bless your&#xD;
riens."&#xD;
With a bow, Albert took the ring which the&#xD;
x   nman proffered him, and which he ,eared&#xD;
to eet, lest he might wound his feelings, and&#xD;
astil placed it uponthe third finger of the let&#xD;
" Tv oblige you, courteous youth, I' accept&#xD;
this pledge of your friendship; not as some-&#xD;
thin  n any manner merited, but as an indica -&#xD;
tdo11 of your own generous nature.",&#xD;
At thadt  stant, Albert felt a rough 'grasp&#xD;
upon his arm, and tuf'ning angrily towards the&#xD;
intruder, he pejrceivea the scowling face of Mark&#xD;
Don ieadl.&#xD;
What nowI has tie foul fiend gotten pos-&#xD;
session of you again ?'" the" said, in a voice of&#xD;
suppressed anger.&#xD;
Casside's. eyes flashed indignantly, -nd ad-&#xD;
vagcing his 'face close to'the ear of the bandit&#xD;
chief, he rejoined, in a hoarse and threatening&#xD;
tone :&#xD;
&#xD;
"Never presume to lay your hand thus un&#xD;
ceremoniously 'upon me the second time ; for&#xD;
should you, I swear by the holy cross, I.will&#xD;
pass my sword through your body, although you&#xD;
are surrounded by all your minions !"&#xD;
Mark Donhead bit his lips, and quailed be.&#xD;
fore the menacing glances of Albert.&#xD;
"Beware ! remember who I am !" retorted&#xD;
the former, in a voice subdued almost to a&#xD;
whisper,  " But come," he added, taking&#xD;
Casside's arm; " tifis is no place for wrangling.&#xD;
We are attracting observation; we will adjust&#xD;
our differences at some other time and place."&#xD;
Our hero slowly and reluctantly permitted&#xD;
himself to be= conducted into the inn. As he&#xD;
passed over the threshold, the youth whom he&#xD;
had assisted thanked him again, while at the&#xD;
pae time a cavalier rode into the yard, whose&#xD;
arrival appeared to give him much pleasure.&#xD;
Upon seeing the two .together, Albert im-&#xD;
mediately remembered them as being the iden-&#xD;
tical persons who had passed the'night at t e&#xD;
Silver deli, . in an apartment adjoining tat&#xD;
which he had occupied, and between whom  e&#xD;
had overheard, a conversation of some lengh,&#xD;
relating to ,a robbery in. the bonhead -*od.&#xD;
The younger of the two was obviouly the in-&#xD;
dividual whom the elder had addressed as neph-&#xD;
ew ; and the elder was consequently the' same&#xD;
who had answered to the application of'uncle,&#xD;
on the occasion referred tai&#xD;
" A fine piece of'work have you spoiled or&#xD;

"our unparalleled impudence ,confounds&#xD;
me I" roared Donhead.  "]y St: Stephen!.&#xD;
you cannot be what-you seep  Ydy are proud,&#xD;
fiery,; and daring .enough to be of the noblest&#xD;
blood in the land, instead of the humble indi-&#xD;
vidual which your garb attempts to declare-you&#xD;
to be. Young man, I must have your history,&#xD;
though I wring it from you by the neck I"&#xD;
"You can have it without that trouble,"&#xD;
said Casside, carelessly.. "I was -born of some&#xD;
simple peasants, near Hengistbury Head, in the&#xD;
year 1806."     ,&#xD;
"Bah I it isfalse-it is false!" cried Mark,&#xD;
violently.  "No more fooling-no more fool-&#xD;
ing !  Cone~speak ; who are you ?".&#xD;
"-am a man,)' answered Albert; oamly.&#xD;
"By my faith! fnow you-are beardingme.to&#xD;
my face !" resumed Donhead,  'Bunt no mat-&#xD;
ter ; I have you fast enough, and-your boasted&#xD;
manhood is subservient to my;orders.  There is&#xD;
a man in my service bythe name of Herbault-&#xD;
you saw him in character the other night-he&#xD;
whisks off human heads in a curious way," he&#xD;
added, significantly.&#xD;
" In that case, I know of. a head the fellow&#xD;
mightmake money on ; he could command six&#xD;
hundred florins for it; which, considering the&#xD;
,quality, is exorbitant and .extortionary,", oh-&#xD;
aeried Casside, coolly.,&#xD;
"You think so I" muttered Mark, scowling&#xD;
darkly.&#xD;
' I do, candidly, captain."&#xD;
".ark ye, my precocious youngster ! per.&#xD;
ihlps you=aspire to the six hundred florins your-&#xD;
"If I did," cried Albert, striking his hand&#xD;
iponuhis sword, "I would have them in my&#xD;
pocket4 before yonder sun sinks behind the dis-&#xD;
tant hills,"&#xD;
When,, how ?";&#xD;
"Now," said Albert, firmly,,fc and by means'&#xD;
of this weapon by, yseide."  And the yongi&#xD;
ih diehis eyes cablly upon the, leader of&#xD;
the banditti."&#xD;
"That is empty bravado ! a merecurrent of&#xD;
&#xD;
air passing out of your mouth I" rejoined  9n-&#xD;
head, in a. voice subdued, deep, and full of&#xD;
meaning.&#xD;
"I will lay a wager of an hundred forins,&#xD;
providing you are agreeable thereto, that, if&#xD;
placed on equal footing, faee to face,;and noth-&#xD;
ing but our swords to decide -the matter, ,before&#xD;
ten minutes have been counted upon the dial,; I&#xD;
will have your head under my arm I"&#xD;
Mark Donhead, whohad been walking fiercely&#xD;
up and down the room, now paused before Al-&#xD;
bert,. and favored him with a long and penetra,&#xD;
ting stare, in which ferocity, fear, and indaision,&#xD;
seemed to be blended. His chest wosred coh-&#xD;
vulsively,' he set his teeth hard "together, and&#xD;
breathed like a tiger that wishes to spring upon&#xD;
his prey,, but dare not. He then: threw, him-&#xD;
self heavily into a chair and said hoarsely, and&#xD;
with forced composure :&#xD;
"I will not -accept your accursed wager P'&#xD;
" Act your pleasure, captain," said Albert,&#xD;
who appeared, to exercise a kind of fasqination&#xD;
over the sanguinary monster. For-a short time,&#xD;
there was a profound silence, in which .~pohead&#xD;
sat contracting his brows,,and casting savage and&#xD;
curious glances at our hero.&#xD;
It is impossible to tell how this singular scene&#xD;
might have ended,,had it not at that crsis been&#xD;
interrupted by the entrance of a traveller and&#xD;
his servant. -He was a person considerably .d-&#xD;
vanced in life, whose exterior denoted, both&#xD;
rank and (respectability. Iis manner was ab.&#xD;
stracted, .and he took little or no notice of.Al.&#xD;
bert and his companion, but setting himself&#xD;
dejectedly, waited patiently for the appearance&#xD;
of mine host: The attention of Casside. was&#xD;
immediately directed towards .the new-comer,&#xD;
and he gave unmistakable signs of being cen-&#xD;
siderably interested in his appearance,; ;and,so&#xD;
far as one could judge, appeared equally antis&#xD;
not to be observed by the. object of his scrutiny,&#xD;
The hood of his domino, which had 'bqenp&#xD;
tially removed, he hastily adjusted, cone ang&#xD;
nearly every feature of his face.&#xD;
Mark Donhead smoothed the.f n "oi.r&#xD;
forehead, and also began to honor the stranger&#xD;
with prying looks, and obviously desired to&#xD;

&#xD;
"Do you'happen to know that gentleman'2"&#xD;
asked Mark, sullenly.&#xD;
" I haven't that honor," replied-Albert.&#xD;
" Neither do I; -but trust me, Jtoaehim Cape&#xD;
will be likely to find out. The fellow will not&#xD;
be happy until he knows his name and rank,"&#xD;
added Mark.   "-One thing, however, 'to me is&#xD;
quite obvious;Ie iS a 'person of consequence ;&#xD;
and wh 'knows but a wise providence has&#xD;
thrown him in -our' way, that you may have a&#xD;
chance to try your hand at your new trade.&#xD;

bungler may rob &amp;amp; Comrumon person of his filthy&#xD;
lucre, but it's not every tyro that has the priv.&#xD;
lige of clapping his sword to the breast of a&#xD;
real lord, -or a belted knight," continued the&#xD;
bandit chief, in a sneering tone.&#xD;
"I perceive,"returned his companion, "that&#xD;
you always have an eye to business; that yon&#xD;
are something 'of a philosopher, as well asa&#xD;
famous chieftain ; that you are as ready to&#xD;
count laurels as florins."&#xD;
While Casside was making this rejoinder,&#xD;
Joadhim Capet re-appeared ; whereupon Don-&#xD;
head inquired how the cavalier and his- servtat&#xD;
were mounted ; whether their horses were in&#xD;
good condition; whether the housings tpoa them&#xD;
were rich and costly, and several 'other things&#xD;
which we do not now remember.&#xD;
Joachim went on' to state that both mhater&#xD;

Joachim, turning pale and looking fixedly at&#xD;
Albert.&#xD;
" It is your old friend-Albeit Casside,"&#xD;
replied Mark, laughing at'Capet's consternation.&#xD;
"Heart of the Madonna !  St. Peter and St.&#xD;
Paul, and a great quantity of other saints, of&#xD;
all sexes ! I had rather see Satan himself at&#xD;
the Silver Bell, than this mad-cap, hair-brained&#xD;
youth !" exclaimed the host, with much per-&#xD;
turbation of manner. "He- will cut all our&#xD;
throats, and murder the women and children !"&#xD;
"Come, Joachim," said Albert, "go and&#xD;
bring us a bottle over which the cobwebs have&#xD;
been accumulating for the last twenty years,&#xD;
and let us drink confusion to our enemies."&#xD;
"If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not,"&#xD;
&#xD;
replied Joachim, working himself towards the&#xD;
door, whereupon our hero went through with&#xD;
the interesting pantomime of cracking his skull,&#xD;
which had the effect to subdue instantly all his&#xD;
former objections. He hastened for the wine,&#xD;
and while he was gone, father David once more&#xD;
rejoined them. The drinking scene that fob-&#xD;
lowed did not appear to be of the most com-&#xD;
forting and happifying kind to Joachim ; who&#xD;
seated himself as far from the table as possible,&#xD;
and kept a most vigilant eye upon the motions&#xD;
of our hero, expecting, unquestionably, to have&#xD;
a bottle or some other missile hurled at his head,&#xD;
or some violent demonstration made upon his&#xD;
person.&#xD;

&#xD;
his countenance continually, to discover, with-&#xD;
out appearing to do so, the effect of his words-;&#xD;
ana he could not doubt but the bandit was&#xD;
studying more fully his character, and testing&#xD;
his good faith in regard to the object of his en-&#xD;
rollment in the band. He was shrewd enough&#xD;
to conclude that the captain's careless manner&#xD;
was wholly assumed, for the purposes above&#xD;
mentioned, and - conducted himself accordingly.&#xD;
He was quite sure that he had seriously provok.&#xD;
ed Donhead, by-his recent interference in the&#xD;
quarrel which had taken place, in the yard of&#xD;
the inn, a short time before ; and it appeared&#xD;
more reasonable to him to suppose that he was&#xD;
only repressing his anger for the present, than&#xD;
that he had entirely forgiven him his uninten-&#xD;
tional offence.&#xD;
Albert knew enough of the human disposi-&#xD;
tion, to'understand many of its various phases,&#xD;
and flattered himself that he could not be de-&#xD;
ceived, even by the cunning arts of the bandit&#xD;
chief. Disguising his own feelings, he con-&#xD;
versed with affected cheerfulness upon different&#xD;
subjects, quaffed his wine'with apparent ebjoy-&#xD;
ment, and sustained his reputation, generally,&#xD;
&#xD;
-'&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SIL]V&#xD;
&#xD;
-as a care-for-nothing fellow, in a tnannef that&#xD;
reflected great credit upon his power of self-&#xD;
control. Mark was baffled in all his efforts to&#xD;
throw him off his guard, and it is possible that&#xD;
lis- confidence in his new ally, was, in- some&#xD;
,measure, restored.. His good nature increas-&#xD;
ed with his increasing cups, : and he even&#xD;
went so far as to drink the health of'his intend-&#xD;
ed bride ; a formality which was anything but&#xD;
agreeable to Albert, who would much rather&#xD;
have preferred to dash his wine into the-cap-&#xD;
-tam's face than to be reduced, as he was, to&#xD;
the alternative of swallowing it.&#xD;
While matters were progressing in this man-&#xD;
ner, father David was suddenly seized -with a&#xD;
copious hemorrhage from the nose, and left them,&#xD;
'as he said, to make an appliance of cold water ;&#xD;
the only sure remedy for that complaint. But&#xD;
the moment he was out of the tap-room, instead&#xD;
of manifesting any concern -or annoyance from&#xD;
the circumstance named, he quickly mounted&#xD;
the stairs, and being intimately acquainted with&#xD;
all parts of the Silver Bell, instantly sought&#xD;
that particular apartment where he had reason&#xD;
to believe the last traveller was accommodated.&#xD;
. He listened a few seconds at the dooy, aid&#xD;
then entered without knocking. The noble-&#xD;
=looking guest, -was pacing the room with an air&#xD;
-of the deepest anxiety, while the melancholy ex-&#xD;
pression of his face gave ample evidence that&#xD;
'orrow had not been a stranger to his breast.&#xD;
The abrupt and unannounced appearance of the&#xD;
monk seemed to surprise him, and pausing in&#xD;
the middle of the apartment, he fixed a reproving&#xD;
'and inquiring glance upon the intruder.  Fa-&#xD;
ther David hurriedly closed the door, -and laid&#xD;
'his finger warningly upon his lips.'&#xD;
"I have come thus abruptly," said the monk,&#xD;
in a suppressed voice, "to make an important&#xD;
communication. I have but a moment to spare ;&#xD;
it ipust not be known that I.entered this cham-&#xD;
ber; and should chance throw me in our way&#xD;
4uring'yodr brief stay. here, do not recognize&#xD;
me, by word or look. Certain parties have laid&#xD;
a plan to rob you in 'the adjoining forest, after&#xD;
you have -left the Silver Bell.  No - personal-&#xD;

moneys and valuables you and your servant&#xD;
may have in your possession, will certainly be&#xD;
taken, to the last farthing's worth."  ,&#xD;
"Proceed," said, the traveller, as David&#xD;
paused an instant.&#xD;
"Is it necessary that you should resume&#xD;
your journey before to-morrow?" asked the&#xD;
friar.&#xD;
" Imperatively," replied the gentleman.&#xD;
"Be it so-be it so ; listen to me: I have&#xD;
concocted a scheme in my own mind, by which&#xD;
you may punish and baffle the designing knaves&#xD;
of Mark Donhead. Feign to have with you a&#xD;
considerable sum of money, and question mine&#xD;
host about the safety of the roads, and the dan-&#xD;
ger of robberies in the forest ; while at the&#xD;
same time you admonish your servant to be-care-&#xD;
ful of your portmanteau.- This line of conduct&#xD;
will have precisely the effect desired ; and to&#xD;
keep up the deception, procure a small bag, tnd&#xD;
have it filled with copper,.lead, brass, and other&#xD;
worthless articles, thus giving it the appearance&#xD;
of great value.  This bag you need not fhe very&#xD;
careful to keep entirely out of sight ; !aula after&#xD;
yourself and servant have mounted, it might&#xD;
very much favor the object in view if youshould&#xD;
order him, in a- suppressed voice,. yet -load&#xD;
enough for by-standers to hear, to hand you the&#xD;
bag of florins, for you fear to trust him with it.&#xD;
You smile, sir; I-perceive you enter into the&#xD;
spirit of my proposal."&#xD;
"I do, holy father ; I commend your ingenu-&#xD;
ity, and will followsyour instructions to the let-&#xD;
ter," rejoined the stranger. "The boldness of&#xD;
Mark Donhead is becoming insufferable.  eavy&#xD;
robberies are of daily occurrence. To disap.&#xD;
point the cupidity of the ruffian in the nmanner&#xD;
-which you propose, woulk really give .megreat&#xD;
pleasure. Although you are a stranger :$ome,&#xD;

garb you 'wear, assure me of your good faith.&#xD;
L thank you;forithis. warning, and, twil trust&#xD;
yolr integrity implicitly."&#xD;
"Remember, my lord, or whatever yourditle&#xD;
may be; that you are not to recognize °nmo should&#xD;
w4 meet again in this  part of theeogi;'y ,; d&#xD;
I will also;add, that in giving you i-rng,&#xD;
&#xD;
f    ARK    DONHEAD      resumed: "You,&#xD;
Joachim Capet, must be sure to learn&#xD;
when this gentleman intends to leave the inn ;&#xD;
and having ascertained that particular item, do&#xD;
not neglect to advise me of the same.  Father&#xD;
David, Casside and myself will be enough for&#xD;
this job ; we will station ourselves in the forest&#xD;
at a proper time, and in a proper place, and&#xD;
await his coming. While one of us takes care&#xD;
of the servant, our young friend shall perform&#xD;
his first robbery on the king's highway."&#xD;
Albert did not demur at this arrangement,&#xD;
and the captain and the monk proceeded to&#xD;
give him very minute instructions concerning&#xD;
the part he was to act, especially against awk-&#xD;
wardness in his first attempt ; they assured&#xD;
him that his language must be courtly and&#xD;
civil when he demanded the nobleman's money,&#xD;
and that he must not degrade himself by low&#xD;
and vulgar expressions ; as his reputation de-&#xD;
pended very much on the skill and address with&#xD;
which he conducted his first enterprise.&#xD;
While the worthy pair were imparting these&#xD;
useful hints and practical admonitions, Albert&#xD;
could not but observe that Mark was watching&#xD;

"This advontare promises to be a very rich&#xD;

" That's lucky," replied David.  "I hait&#xD;

- " Yes,I-aicertainof it, for Joachim was&#xD;
favored with a glimpse of the same ; and he is&#xD;
of the opinion that its contents would be suf-&#xD;

menacing motion with his weapon.&#xD;
Without farther remonstrance, the nobleman&#xD;
took the bag from his saddle-bow, where it was&#xD;
partially covered by a portion of his stress, and&#xD;
threw it at Albert's feet, saying, contemp-&#xD;
tuously :&#xD;
"Young man,.I hope you will some day&#xD;
learn a better trade."&#xD;
As our hero bent to take the bag from the&#xD;
ground, the hood of his domino unluckily slip-&#xD;
ped from  a portion of his face; the traveller&#xD;
caught a glimpse of his features, and uttered an&#xD;
exclamation of painful surprise. The young&#xD;
man hastily replaced his domino, waved his&#xD;
hand to the man whom he had robbed, and re-&#xD;
joined father David, who had been watching&#xD;
the scene with much interest. A moment after,&#xD;
Mark Donhead, who had prevented the servant&#xD;
from going to the assistance of his master, also&#xD;
returned to his accomplices, rejoicing in the&#xD;
complete success of the robbery.&#xD;
"In this affair," he said; warmly, addressing&#xD;
Albert, "you have conducted yourself 'with&#xD;

.trableimantle of mystery hung-about hisact and&#xD;
Intentions.  It was in vain that he addressed&#xD;
'.ords, of bhe'er to Casside; theflitter's mental&#xD;
as enity had been toe violently disturbed to re-'&#xD;
cover speedily its wonted'tranquillity.&#xD;
Do' not speak to meof thefuture-!",'he ex-&#xD;
claimed, 'somewhat sharply:  ".Its skies are&#xD;
orvdiedt, and dark with storms of disgrace.  The&#xD;
-mre° resolutely I struggle to mend my desperate"&#xD;
%bitunes, the aore deeplydp Ibecome involved.&#xD;
But letusdrop the ,ingsnial theme,'and' talk of'&#xD;
thingn' but the future  "I recollect. now, that&#xD;
thekha'a disagreeable ,work to' be done; come,&#xD;
let us go forth and perform it. As I, told you&#xD;
at the first, it is a thing I like not ; but as we&#xD;
have commenced it, it must be conducted firmly&#xD;
to the end."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Very 'true," said Willie ; " what is begun&#xD;
must be finished, and it is now our painful duty&#xD;
to consign earth to earth, and dust to dust, pr-ay-&#xD;
ing that God may take care for the rest."&#xD;
Casside and 'the stroller then proceeded to&#xD;
the place of interment; the former held in his&#xD;
hand the dim light, while the latter, with 'piok&#xD;
.and spade, removed a portion of theearthfroin&#xD;
the' recent .grave.  Standing there, beneath&#xD;
those gloomy. arches, with such mournful'ime-&#xD;
mentoes of mortality around-him, Albert cuuld&#xD;
not'but reflect upon the mutability of human&#xD;
affairs, ind feel-that life *as indeed a seasot*f&#xD;
vicissitude and pain. ' The "feeble scintillations&#xD;
of the lamp called up fantastic shadows. and&#xD;
shaped grim monsters upon the rugged rocks and&#xD;
overhanging' -walls.'&#xD;
His own fancies were as wild and flifugl as&#xD;
those pictured around him'by the faint eflbrts of&#xD;
the glimmering 'lamp to overcome the surround-&#xD;
ing darkness.  Meantime, the stroller la edo&#xD;
industriously, and hollo*ed out a space in which&#xD;
to deposit the mortal remains of ierbault.'&#xD;
"It will matter but little, if it is not very&#xD;
deep and wide," said Willie ; "and his slum.&#xD;
&#xD;
bers will be just as sweet, as though he were&#xD;
encased in a gilded cofin."&#xD;
Theybodyof Herbault at length was brought&#xD;
from the spot where it had been secreted, laid&#xD;
into the ground above some -of his own handi-&#xD;
work, and the kindred earth was thrown upon&#xD;
him.-&#xD;
Albert felt truly thankful when this disagree-&#xD;
able task was completed, and the ghastly figure&#xD;
of the executioner shut forever fromsight. The&#xD;
mound was made to assume its former appear-&#xD;
ance, and the implements that had been used&#xD;
were returned to their accustomed places. Each&#xD;
of the"two men experienced sensations of awe,&#xD;
when they turned from the spot where so many&#xD;
husian bodies had found room to mingle with&#xD;
their kindred elements.&#xD;
"{Now," said Albert, pausing in the corriddi,&#xD;
when they had walked some distance, "I would&#xD;
see Lady Eveline; and if you have any power&#xD;
to Conduct me to her presence, I entreat you to&#xD;
do so."&#xD;
"No no ! that must not be thought of!" re-&#xD;
plied the stroller.  "The danger attending&#xD;
such a step is too great."&#xD;
"Old man, I care little for danger. You&#xD;
cannot change 'my purpose," rejoined Albert,&#xD;
flhnly.&#xD;
t'But you forget, my good youth, that I&#xD;
also incur a portion of the danger'? It' is true&#xD;
that you may value your life lightly, but it does&#xD;
nut*follow as a consequence that I set the same&#xD;
loc estimate upon mine," returned Willie.&#xD;
"To all outward appearance you are the&#xD;
most wretched of 'human:'beings'!" exclaimed&#xD;
Albert, contemptuously; "and yet you cling as&#xD;
tenaciously to life as the young, the fair, and,&#xD;
the hopeful."&#xD;
Selfish young man !"- retorted the beggar.'&#xD;
"Is this, then, your return for kindness con-&#xD;
ferred ? are these the thanks you bestow fo my&#xD;
ervices ? is this your gratitude to an olA man,&#xD;
who has already incurred deadly peril"for your&#xD;
Pardon me, good Willie! my impatience&#xD;
and impetuosity make the utter 'things' which&#xD;
are 'not 'discreet, and which'may cause me fo ap-&#xD;
&#xD;
pear meanly selfish ; but at present, as you are&#xD;
aware, I am not -acting for self, but risking life&#xD;
and fame for others., If there is any possible&#xD;
way by which you can procure me an interview&#xD;
with Lady Eveline, you will confer upon me&#xD;
the'greatest possible favor, 'and lay me under&#xD;
an obligation which I shall not consider repaid,&#xD;
until the debt of nature itself is cancelled."&#xD;
"One great difficulty which stands in the&#xD;
way of your desires, is, that the apartment of&#xD;
this damsel is beyond the places where many&#xD;
of the banditti sleep; consequently, in going&#xD;
there, we shall be obliged to pass them; which,&#xD;
on the whole, cannot be considered a very plea-&#xD;
sant undertaking."&#xD;
" I confess, friend Willie, that that is an&#xD;
objection worthy of consideration; but I am&#xD;
prepared to incur the risk consequent upon the&#xD;
undertaking, providing you' feel disposed to&#xD;
share it with me'; or, if you prefer, give'me&#xD;
such instructions : that I' may go unattended,&#xD;
and suffer in' my own person (if need be) all&#xD;
the penalties of discovery."&#xD;
The stroller rnused a moment, as if weighing&#xD;
all the circumstances of the case, and then an-&#xD;
swered:&#xD;
".I am always 'willing to dare danger, where-&#xD;
there is a prospect of success; but I am not on#&#xD;
of that kind who act without forethought, and&#xD;
endeavor to exeedte plans before they are' well&#xD;
matured.  In regard to your going alone;' n;&#xD;
instruction -which I:can give, will enable you to&#xD;
do so., And now tell me, my lad, candidly, if&#xD;
much real good would'result from 'an intervidW&#xD;
with this high-born maiden ?"&#xD;
"She is, no ,doubt," added Casside, "'the&#xD;
subject of the most'painful uncertainty and 'tor&#xD;
turing apprehension. A 'few words from nie'&#xD;
might remove a portion of her anxiety, andtlift&#xD;
the' heavy burden of terror from her'hed.&#xD;
This gentle' damsel, good Willie, is most 'ear&#xD;
to me; and the sorrows that distract her bosoni&#xD;
are shared by me, and render my oin life&#xD;
wretched."&#xD;
"Shelh things are'very strange," resumed the&#xD;
stroller, '" but no doubt they ate natural and'&#xD;

Casside made zo answer, and Willie est--,&#xD;
guished the light, leaving them  eiveloped in&#xD;
the most impenetrable robe of ;night that ever&#xD;
bafle human sight. Tak ing the rm of -bi&#xD;
conductor, he suffered himself to be led fowor4&#xD;
for a-considerable distance, ,each vieing with the&#xD;
other in the softeess of their tread, and'&#xD;
stealthiness of their movements. _{&#xD;
Occasionally they heard voices,:and the leav&#xD;
respirations of many sleepers; e.$  hy the ,&#xD;

conscious that they had eft the dangerous loal-&#xD;

"A few yards futhe, and we will ligt.e&#xD;

'Casside was glad to hear this, for he was trd&#xD;

&#xD;
speaker, " and I must find it before venturing&#xD;
to strike a light. I must feel along these rug-&#xD;
ged walls; it cannot be possible that I have&#xD;
passed it."&#xD;
"Perhaps your instincts have failed you for&#xD;
once," replied Albert.&#xD;
"I trow not-we shall know soon-it is very&#xD;
important that the passage should be found,&#xD;
because it leads to the place where the fair cap-&#xD;
tive is immured."&#xD;
Willie then placed his hands upon the walls&#xD;
and felt his way carefully along ; while Albert&#xD;
followed him, awaiting, in the greatest suspense,&#xD;
the welcome announcement of the expected dis-&#xD;
covery.&#xD;
"JHere it is," said the. stroller, at length,&#xD;
when Albert was beginning to despair of suc-&#xD;
cess.&#xD;
"Instinct forever !" said the latter.&#xD;
"Wisely spoken, young mban. 'It is one of&#xD;
the most wonderful gifts of the benevolent&#xD;
Creator. What could the horse or the dog do&#xD;
without instinct?"&#xD;
"Nothing, pbilosophicel, Willie ;.they would&#xD;
cae to be useful servants to man.- You, are&#xD;
enhanoing my estimation of'iatinot to suoh .&#xD;
degre., that I begin to entertain serious initen.&#xD;
tins of putting out my own:eyes, insorder to&#xD;

retorted Casside."&#xD;
"I would not advise you to do -so,"returned&#xD;
thebliud man, :"becauseit is more thefriend&#xD;
Of the unfortunate than:the foolish"&#xD;
The stroller stopped, and producingflnut, steel,&#xD;
and tinder,=re-lighted the lamp. The two mnai&#xD;
uatwalked briskly forward,&#xD;
&#xD;
" Here is the door that opens into the Lady&#xD;
Eveline's prison," said the beggar.&#xD;
"But one difficulty yet remains !" cried Al-&#xD;
bert.  " The door is looked, old man ; how can&#xD;
I enter ?"&#xD;
" I am not the person to come so far on a&#xD;
fool's errand, I assure you; I always look ahead,&#xD;
to see if I am prepared to meet all the difficul-&#xD;
ties which I undertake. I have a duplicate of&#xD;
every key in the cavern. I have not been idle&#xD;
since I gained access to this singular brother-&#xD;
hood," replied the mendicant, with a smile.&#xD;
'Thereupon, he drew from his bosom a key,&#xD;
and held it up before the young man.&#xD;
" Industry is among the most commendable&#xD;
of all virtuesI it is a sin to be inactive ; when&#xD;
the means of knowledge and power are in one's&#xD;

A&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
CIE, time approached which seemed des-&#xD;
tined to prove an important epoch in the&#xD;
life of' Isandra Vidal.  She experienced much&#xD;
an ity and many. trepidations of spirit in re-&#xD;
gard to the events - about to transpire.  She&#xD;
feed not only for herself, but for the'safety of&#xD;
Louis. The sudden appearance of Weird" Elsie,&#xD;
and the singular interest which she manifested&#xD;
l these iueivphases of-her existence, had a ten-&#xD;
'dey   itoimystify her !niid-not a°little.  Why&#xD;
h "rthatinexplicable personage presented her-&#xD;
dolj at iich a crisis? What earthly object could&#xD;
she have in frustrating the designs of'the man&#xD;
whom she knew as Denis Wetzel? Whence&#xD;
came her knowledge of his character and de-&#xD;
signs?  Was there any secret tie that bound&#xD;
Elsie to Wetzel; and had the former really any&#xD;
power to aid her in an hour of extreme need ?&#xD;
Queries of this nature floated continually&#xD;
through the brain of the gentle shepherdess;&#xD;
but she found herself unable to arrive at any&#xD;
definite' conclusion in regard to them.  Some-&#xD;
times she was half inclined to believe that Elsie&#xD;
was a mad woman, and no more than that ; and&#xD;
had merely given utterance to the disconnected&#xD;
&#xD;
and incongruous imagery of 'her own distorted&#xD;
imagination.- But when she reflected -more&#xD;
maturely upon the details of the last interview,&#xD;
she could not consistently question her sanity;&#xD;
her manner was rational and impressive, her&#xD;
words well chosen, and her earnestness 'quite-&#xD;
apparent..&#xD;
Isandra had promised to follow the, instrue&#xD;
Lions of lElsie, and she adhered religiously to&#xD;
the same. -She had discu4sed 'the matter fully'&#xD;
with Louis, and the youth' had entered with&#xD;
spirit and determination, coupled with prudence&#xD;
and sagacity, into her plans and purposes' It&#xD;
was conceded by both, that their father's maing&#xD;
ner indicated that something unusual was going&#xD;
to take place. His air was abstracted, his brow&#xD;
clouded and thoughtful, and his replies to ques-&#xD;
tions abrupt and impatient.&#xD;
As the night approached, his agitation evi-&#xD;
dently increased ; and Louis observed him more&#xD;
than once casting troubled and half-regretful&#xD;
looks at Isandra. The latter felt a natural&#xD;
quickening of the pulse when she perceived that&#xD;
the hour had arrived which was to test the prac-&#xD;
ticability of ilsie's schemes.&#xD;

"handra," said Vidal, suddenly, in a voice&#xD;
not altogether calm, "youmay take this pack-&#xD;
age and earry it to our neighbor, Michael Hoff-&#xD;
land; and tell=him that I attended to the mat-&#xD;
ter as well as I could."&#xD;
With a trembling hand the maiden received&#xD;
the package, looking inquiringly into her father's&#xD;
face as she did so. _iVidal instantly averted his&#xD;
eyes and turned from her, and with an unutter-&#xD;
able feeling of sorrow, the young girl prepared&#xD;
herself to execute this pretended commission.&#xD;
When she had done so, she-left the cottage and&#xD;
was joined by her brother, who was awaiting&#xD;
her -at a short distance. The garments which he&#xD;
was to wear on that occasion had been previous-&#xD;
ly conveyed to the spot, and Louis had already&#xD;
partially arranged his unaccustomed toilet, and&#xD;
only needed the dexterous. and more experienced&#xD;
hand of Isandra to render it quite complete.&#xD;
The maiden affirmed that said garments fitted&#xD;
him to a charm, and in fact did not ill become&#xD;
him. With true feminine skill and taste, she&#xD;
attended to those details, which, though they&#xD;
seemed unimportant to Louis, when taken alto-&#xD;
gether had much to do with the general effect.&#xD;
The lad's locks were quite long, and by the&#xD;
ready fingers of Isandra, they were arranged in&#xD;
a highly creditable way.  She then gave him&#xD;
such instructions in regard to his deportment,&#xD;
manner of wearing a veil, etc., as she thought&#xD;
would be useful.&#xD;
All these preliminaries were, not effected&#xD;
without much effort on the part of our heroine.&#xD;
A full realization of the season of trial which&#xD;
awaited both him and her, had a deeply de-&#xD;
pressing influence upon her. Although she&#xD;
shrunk from the proposed alliance with Denis&#xD;
Wetzel, her own desire for safety did not cause&#xD;
her to selfishly forget the danger to which Louis&#xD;
was exposing himself to save her. - Her affec-&#xD;
tion for the lad made her painfully anxious in&#xD;
regard to the result. The manner in which&#xD;
Elsie had referred to that subject, had convin-&#xD;
ced her that the risk to be incurred-would not&#xD;
be slight.-&#xD;
But Louis was firm in his determination, and&#xD;
embracing him most affectionately, the fair shep-&#xD;

herdess invoked the blessing of Heaven upon&#xD;
the enterprise, gave him the bundle, and with&#xD;
an agitated breast saw him depart to encounter&#xD;
he knew not what.&#xD;
The moment the youth disappeared, she sank\&#xD;
upon hei knees, and prayed fervently, humbly,&#xD;
and tearfully, for the protection of God ; that&#xD;
he would so surround him and lyr with his pro-&#xD;
tecting providences, that evil men might not&#xD;
bring them to shame ; that his- fatherly hand&#xD;
might be so stretched out over them, that the&#xD;
devices of.the wicked might fail;,that his great&#xD;
love would raise them up friends to be near&#xD;
them in every emergency; that his wisdom&#xD;
might guide their footsteps always, and be to&#xD;
them as a wall of fire by night and a pillar of&#xD;
cloud by day.&#xD;
Isandra arose from her knees;. she felt calm-&#xD;
er and stronger; the angel of hope whispered&#xD;
more tangibly in her ears-she spoke more con-&#xD;
fidently of the joys of the future, and smiled more&#xD;
benignantly upon the face of the humble maiden'.&#xD;
With eyes still wet with the dewdrops of the&#xD;
soul, she proceeded to fulfil the rest of her in-&#xD;
structions. It was not altogether a genial task,&#xD;
but supported by a new-born strength,'she at-&#xD;
tired her person in the garments of her bother.&#xD;
Twilight had passed, the moon was up, and&#xD;
the stars were softly gleaming, when Isandra&#xD;
had completed the change and was ready to re-&#xD;
turn to the cottage. She entered without hesi-&#xD;
tation just as Elsie had directed, and passing&#xD;
through the room where her father was sitting&#xD;
abstractedly, with his elbows upon the table,&#xD;
and his head resting upon his hands, sought the&#xD;
little apartment where Louis slept. Vidal did&#xD;
not alter his ?osition, or notice her ; a circum-&#xD;
stance for which she was thankful, for she felt a&#xD;
little awkward in her new dress.&#xD;
Isandra did not retire, but awaited farther&#xD;
developments with an intensity of suspense&#xD;
which cannot be expressed. Presently she&#xD;
heard some one knock, and the stern voice of her&#xD;
father bade the applicant enter. The maiden&#xD;
.looked anxiously through an interstice in the&#xD;
partition -and saw a man enter and place a bag&#xD;
upon the table before Vidal.&#xD;

"Well, she'll soon learn that tears, and out-&#xD;

in the day to be guilty of the ftlly of repen-&#xD;
tance. , Let us count these florins, and see if&#xD;
Wetzel has kept well his word. There is. a-&#xD;
set .draw up to the table."  The man obeyed;&#xD;
aid'Vidal with alacrity untied the bag.&#xD;
" Money," he observed, moralizingly, "is&#xD;
a grqt a#odyne rfor-a nervous conscience-; and&#xD;
I shouldn't wonder," he added, with-a smile,&#xD;
"if the contents of this hag should iput mine to&#xD;
sleep for a long time; it looksfat and-inviting.;,&#xD;
I   le empty its contents upon the table."&#xD;
Ahe cgprse and sordid features of Peter Vidal,&#xD;
li cited up with anticipation;. and his hands&#xD;
shoek with expectationu s he inverted the bag.&#xD;
Isa Ora heard a, heavy metallic sound, and then&#xD;
there was an interval of the deepest. silence..&#xD;
&#xD;
"By the hWly eross! what vile tieh is: this !"&#xD;
vociferated Vidal, choking'with wrathh,&#xD;
The man who had brought the bag, stayed at&#xD;
the contents of the same in mute , ader.&#xD;
"Your mater has fooled ,me i I "was an&#xD;
idiot to trust him !" added Peter, with incre*-&#xD;
ing vehemence.,&#xD;
"Trash!, not worth a. single form !" ex-&#xD;
claimed the messenger, putting his hand upon&#xD;
the worthless, pile, which consisted ,of" brass,&#xD;
lead, copper,, and other quite valueless metals.&#xD;
Vidal sprang to his feet, beat upon his breast,&#xD;
tore his hair, foamed at the mouth, and leaped&#xD;
about the room like a madman, uttering impre-&#xD;
cations upop the head' of Denis Wetzel, too, pro-&#xD;
fane to repeat.&#xD;
"This is one of the strangest things I ever&#xD;
knew," observed the messenger,, scratching his&#xD;
head.&#xD;
Instantly the fury of Peter found vent upon&#xD;
the unlucky bandit ; he darted upon him, and&#xD;
administered such efficient blows as soon stretch-&#xD;
ed him beneath the table.&#xD;
"Go back, to your accursed .villain of a-&#xD;
master !" he thundered, " Tell him I will pay&#xD;
back this trick with interest; that I will have&#xD;
my: revenge"; that I will hang him-that I will&#xD;
hang you all ! I will havemy daughter, Ire&#xD;
shall give her up, if I have to apply-to the king&#xD;
himself for justice !"-           -&#xD;
"Justice !" cried the bandit contemptuously,&#xD;
getting upon his'feet; "if you had justice, you&#xD;
would be   hanged, quartered, and burned !&#xD;
Take the advantage of a fellow, will you !, Take&#xD;
that, you avaricious old thief !" he added, hurl-&#xD;
ing -a three-legged stool at Vidal with such force&#xD;
and precision that he was -prostrated, in turn,&#xD;
'and rendered incapable of main any=farther.&#xD;
immediate hostile demonstrations; while thp&#xD;
missile, whose inbmntum" was not wholly re-&#xD;
tarded by the concussion, kept on, and passed&#xD;
out of the window, making a tremendous clatter,&#xD;
having the effect to agitate DIandra with addi'&#xD;
:tional terror.&#xD;
The bandit, not thinking it prudent to stay,&#xD;
to -triumph over, his fallen enemy, 'contented&#xD;
'himsefby shaking hisfistat him as he left the&#xD;
&#xD;
cottage and admonishing him to lie there until&#xD;
he could learn better manners, if it was forever.&#xD;
Isandra beheld this scene without daring to&#xD;
leave the room, and with emotions of fear to&#xD;
which such occurrences would naturally give&#xD;
rise. Leaving the cottage and its inmates, we&#xD;
will now follow the fortunes of Louis. He had&#xD;
gone but a short distance after parting from our&#xD;
heroine, before he was seized by two men who&#xD;
proceeded to place him on horseback.- The&#xD;
brave youth did not forget his instructions, but&#xD;
screamed and struggled, and exhibited every&#xD;
sign of terror. He found the swooning part the.&#xD;
most difficult to perform, inasmuch as in a feign-&#xD;
ed state of unconsciousness he would be in dan-&#xD;
ger of losing his equilibrium and getting a fall;&#xD;
but he managed the matter so adroitly, that&#xD;
the two bandits had ample warning of what was&#xD;
going to occur, and so supported him while he&#xD;
made a very respectable faint, which lasted in&#xD;
.      duration some ten minutes.-&#xD;
"She's gone qnite off," said Yorick, who&#xD;
with Dick Strow had been delegated to perform&#xD;
thisimportant service-&#xD;
" Well, hold on to her," said Dick. " Cap.&#xD;
tain Mark would never forgive us if the girl-&#xD;
should get a tumble."&#xD;
Presently Louis began to manifest symptoms&#xD;
of returning life, and thought it would be to. his&#xD;
credit to favor them with a few hysterical&#xD;
screams, which would not have done discredit&#xD;
to the lungs of the most terrified damsel under&#xD;
heaven.&#xD;
"What a stunnin' voice she has !" cried&#xD;
Dick.  "A few more screams like that will&#xD;
unroof my head ! If it's all the same to you,&#xD;
ma'am, I wish you'd shriek on a lower key."&#xD;
"And without meaning any offence," added&#xD;
Yorick, " if you would manage to set up a little&#xD;

straighter, and not lean so heavily on my arm,&#xD;
you'd do me a particular favor ; and I dare&#xD;
-sy you can feel just as bad, and make as much&#xD;
noise in any other position."&#xD;
" Take me back-take me back !" cried&#xD;
Louis, frantically, in a voice not quite so soft&#xD;
as Isandra's, but as soft as he could make it.&#xD;
"We should be werry happy to please you,&#xD;
young woman, but our orders are strict, and we&#xD;
must' follow 'em, even if you cry yourself into&#xD;
convulsions, and have the tantrums twice as&#xD;
bad."&#xD;
When the lad perceived that he was being&#xD;
conveyed into the depths of the forest, he began&#xD;
to entertain certain vague suspicions, and to be&#xD;
the subject of uncomfortable misgivings in re-&#xD;
gard to the place of his destination. Finally,&#xD;
Yorick and Pick stopped at a lonely spot, which&#xD;
proved to be the entrance to the cave of the&#xD;
banditti ; and the youth could no longer have&#xD;
any doubt in regard to the hands he had fallen&#xD;
into, but was not yet inclined to regret the step&#xD;
he had taken ; for he reflected that he might&#xD;
be the means of saving his sister from  a fate&#xD;
worse than death. He felt a cold and sieky&#xD;
foreboding when he entered the subterranean&#xD;
abode, and the stone that concealed the-entrae&#xD;
moved back to its place. Who would be his&#xD;
friend in that foul haunt of robbery and crime?&#xD;
Who would interpose to save lfn from the anger&#xD;
of Denis Wetzel, when the trick became mani-&#xD;
fest ?  What could he hope -from such men as&#xD;
those with whorn he was now dealing ?&#xD;
Agitated by feelings like these, he was to-&#xD;
ducted onward through some of the variuan&#xD;
winding of the labyrinth, and finally stood in&#xD;
the presence of the personage whom' he reog&#xD;
nized as Denis Wetzel.&#xD;

VORICK and Dick Strow withdrew, and&#xD;
J assuming as conciliating an air as possible,.&#xD;
Mark Donhead advanced and attempted to take&#xD;
Louis by the hand; but remembering his in-&#xD;
structions, he positively refused to permit that&#xD;
liberty ; still keeping the veil drawn closely&#xD;
about-his face, he recoiled from the approaches&#xD;
of the bandit, evincing, so far as he could, every&#xD;
evidence of repugnance and timidity combined&#xD;
"I have sent for you," said Mark, "to make&#xD;
you my wife. -Here you shall reign like a&#xD;
queen; two hundred men. shall be your sub-&#xD;
jects and servants. You'have only to command,&#xD;
and your slightest wish will be obeyed. Here&#xD;
I am absolute ; but I will share my power with&#xD;
you. Your father knows me, and he has given&#xD;
his' consentand approval to this step. It will&#xD;
be useless for me to attempt to conceal from you&#xD;
longer who I am ; I am he whose name you&#xD;
have so often heard. My name and exploits&#xD;
are famous ; but Satan himself is never so bad&#xD;
as he is painted. I am Mark Donhead-the&#xD;
captain of banditti! The future before you is&#xD;
not so dubious as it might seem at first thought.&#xD;
Here you may live in afluence and ease.. As&#xD;
&#xD;
a husband, I shall be considerate and indulgent;&#xD;
you will share my wealth, but not my crimes-&#xD;
if crimes they may be called. It will evince&#xD;
the most good sense on your part to leave off&#xD;
sighing and crying, and submit to° your lot like&#xD;
a rational maiden. There is much true philo-&#xD;
sophy in submitting gracefully to what you can-&#xD;
not evade ; and this marriage, I assure you, is,&#xD;
inevitable. The ceremony will be performed&#xD;
immediately, and you will remain here until all&#xD;
is in readiness. A few of my followers will be&#xD;
admitted' as witnesses of the rite, and the monk&#xD;
who will officiate, is now in the cavern."&#xD;
The bandit chief ceased speaking, and Louis&#xD;
offered no reply, not at that time deening it&#xD;
prudent-to trust his voice, fearing it might be-&#xD;
tray him. Being left alone, he passed the time&#xD;
in reflections of a nature not very flattering to&#xD;
his future prospects. The name of Mark Don-&#xD;
head was familiar to his ears ; he had heard of&#xD;
his innumerable robberies, and his character was&#xD;
associated, in his mind, with all that. was cruel&#xD;
and terrible. Common report spoke him vin-&#xD;
dictive in disposition, and violent in his sudden&#xD;
outbursts of passion ; and he naturally dreaded&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SILV&#xD;
&#xD;
the finale of the present scene. He had not yet&#xD;
traced out any definite method of making known&#xD;
the fraud which he had practised; but that the&#xD;
whole would soon transpire, was now fully ob-&#xD;
vious.&#xD;
After the lapse of about an hour he heard&#xD;
several persons approaching, and knew that the&#xD;
ordeal which was to test all his 'firmness, was&#xD;
indeed at hand. Mark Donhead entered, fol-,&#xD;
lowed by father 'David, Albert Casside, Yorielr,&#xD;
Dick Strow, and half-a-dozen others.&#xD;
"My honorable intentions towards this maid-&#xD;
en," said Mark, "are known unto you all,&#xD;
gentlemen. I have formally proposed to her&#xD;
father for her hand, and have received his full-,&#xD;
est assent. I now intend to wed her on the&#xD;
spot, and desire all present to be witnesses of&#xD;
the legality of the marriagee"&#xD;
"1The damsel, of course, consents to this ar-&#xD;
rangement 7" said father David, inquiringly.&#xD;
" Unquestionably," replied Donhead; "but&#xD;
her agitation and embarrassment, which are&#xD;
quite natural to the novel position in which she&#xD;
finds herself placed, will prevent her, as you&#xD;
perceive, from giving the fitting responses ; but&#xD;
that will make no material difference. You can&#xD;
make the contract just as strong, even if she&#xD;
utters not a word. Come, -gentle shepherdess,&#xD;
all is ready, and I am impatient to be made the&#xD;
happiest man in Dorsetshire."&#xD;
Donhead advanced and took Louis by the&#xD;
hand, while the monk gave Albert a sly glance.&#xD;
"1The gentle damsel is greatly abashed ; be&#xD;
not so urgent, captain; allow her a moment or&#xD;
two in which to recover her equanimity."&#xD;
",When the ceremony is fairly over, she may&#xD;
have as much time as she pleases for that pur-&#xD;
pose. But upon my honor, I cannot now ad-&#xD;
,mit of any delay. Come, my queen, no more&#xD;
whimpering and tears ; let me cast aside the&#xD;
folds of this envious veil, that your beauty may&#xD;
astonish and dazzle the eyes of all present, and&#xD;
mine most of all."&#xD;
Knowing that the denouement must come'&#xD;
sooner or later, Louis made but little resistance&#xD;
to. the removal of said " envious veil," when all&#xD;
eyes were indeed "astonished," but not "daz-&#xD;
&#xD;
ER BELL.                                89&#xD;
zled," with the face that was presented to view ;&#xD;
for the youth's features by constant exposure to&#xD;
the sun, had become very much embrowned,&#xD;
and somewhat roughened, resembling but little&#xD;
the soft, downy skin of Isandra.&#xD;
The complacent air of Mark ,Donhead van-&#xD;
ished with the quickness of light, and his fea-&#xD;
tures grew darker than the clouds of midnight.&#xD;
At first, the blow seemed to stun him, and he&#xD;
could not fully realize the deception which had&#xD;
been practised upon him. The storm was&#xD;
about to burst in all its fury, when father David&#xD;
threw the book which he held in his hand at&#xD;
Mark's feet, and exclaimed, in as angry a voice&#xD;
as he could assume :&#xD;
"Captain Mark, this is a miserable trick !&#xD;
and if you think we shall be amused at it, you&#xD;
are much mistaken I"&#xD;
" It is infamous !" cried Casside, springing&#xD;
forward and shaking" his fist in Mark's face.&#xD;
"We did not come here to be fooled, sir ; but in&#xD;
good faith to witness a marriage ceremony, and&#xD;
nct to be laughed at and mocked in this con.&#xD;
temptible manner."&#xD;
"Ay, ay I" added the monk, with increasing&#xD;
energy, and gesticulating violently.  "You&#xD;
may think it a very fine joke to smuggle a boy in&#xD;
here, dressed up like a woman, in order to make&#xD;
me and others appear ridiculous ! It's a dis-&#xD;
grace to the priesthood !"&#xD;
Yorick, Dick Strow, and others, seeing father&#xD;
David and Casside so much excited about the&#xD;
matter, began to think that a sorry trick had&#xD;
been played upon them also, and showed their&#xD;
displeasure by chiming in with the two latter in&#xD;
a very decided way.&#xD;
Donhead recoiled a few steps, and his coun-&#xD;
teiance grew blacker, as he realized more per.&#xD;
feotly, that he was becoming the centre and&#xD;
focus of the foul words and indignant looks of&#xD;
all present-.&#xD;
"Stop your infernal chatter, you confounded&#xD;
idiots I" he exclaimed, stamping upon  the&#xD;
ground like a maniac. " This ;is no work of '&#xD;
mine. Peter Vidal has deceived' me. Bring&#xD;
Herbault I run for Herbault ! and let him strike&#xD;
off this young rascal's head as quickss possible&#xD;
Ho, here ! Yorick, begone ?"&#xD;

and Donhead: proceeded to question Yoriek and&#xD;
Dick Strew, on the manner in which they had&#xD;
performed their part in this rather curious busi-&#xD;
ness. They afirmed, that they went to the&#xD;
spot to which they. had been directed, met the&#xD;
person whom they expected to meet, and acted,&#xD;
as they supposed,. precisely in accordance with&#xD;
their instructions-; not having the - remotest&#xD;

anything different from what the externalsseem,.&#xD;
ed to indicate.  Both the men'earnestly de-&#xD;

The captain of banditti was evidently very&#xD;

our worthy captain is getting the worst of it ?"&#xD;
Now our hero *as :a strict lover of justice,&#xD;
and he straightway endeavored to act towards&#xD;
the parties with entire impartiality. He gave&#xD;
Vidal.a blow under the left ear,- and Mark a&#xD;
buffet in the left eye. When they had recov-&#xD;
ered their feet again, he flattened the nose of&#xD;
the former by a second punisher upon that or-&#xD;
gan, and knocked out ,a front tooth for the lat-&#xD;
ter- by placing a pain-killer upon that interest-&#xD;

out fear, that, the assertion can be proved false,&#xD;
that your noble name has never been disgraced&#xD;
by those who bear it."&#xD;
"Such words are useless," returned the&#xD;
nobleman, sorrowfully.  "My griefs cannot&#xD;
be so easily assuaged. I know what you pro-&#xD;
bably do not ; I have knowledge of that which&#xD;
makes me wish myself in the tomb of my an-&#xD;
cestors, mingling quietly with the dust of past&#xD;
generations. But enough of this painful theme ;&#xD;
can I not accompany you whither you are now&#xD;
going, and share the danger, should there be&#xD;
any? "&#xD;
" Bf'no means, my lord ! it is not to be&#xD;
thought of. Skill will serve us on this enter-&#xD;
prise better than strength. Should we not re-&#xD;
turn at the expiration of an hour, conclude that&#xD;
we have failed, and provide for your own safety&#xD;
and hers," pointing to Isandra.&#xD;
While the monk was conversing with the two&#xD;
persons referred to, Albert found opportunity&#xD;
to whisper a few words to the fair shepherdess,&#xD;
and to encourage her in the best manner that&#xD;
he could.- He then followed father David, who&#xD;
had proceeded to open the secret door which&#xD;
connected with the cavern, having first provided&#xD;
himself with a light. They passed hurriedly&#xD;
through the intervening apartments, and were&#xD;
soon in the subterranean labyrinth. They kept&#xD;
on without accident until they reached.the cell&#xD;
which Albert had hitherto occupied.&#xD;
" Enter here, and stop a few moments," said&#xD;
David, " when Strolling Willie will join you,&#xD;
and conduct you to the place where the Lady&#xD;
Eveline is held in captivity."&#xD;
Casside did as he was directed, and after the&#xD;
lapse of ten minutes, the stroller made his ap-&#xD;
pearance.&#xD;
"I have come," he said, "to take the place&#xD;
of the monk. I-know what is to be done,:and&#xD;
we must be expeditious in our movements."&#xD;
"As expeditious as you please," replied Al-&#xD;
bert. "Lead on."  Without farther conversa-&#xD;
tion, Wandering Willie threaded once more the.&#xD;
intricacies of the way which had cost them so&#xD;
much anxiety.and trouble on the previous night.&#xD;
They met.no one in the passage,.and ina little&#xD;
&#xD;
'while the door of Lady Eveline's prison was&#xD;
thrown open.&#xD;
Casside ran forward and tenderly embraced&#xD;
the fair occupant, who manifested the utmost&#xD;
joy.&#xD;
"Repress your emotions," said the stroller;&#xD;
" and prepare to depart instantly from 'this&#xD;
place.&#xD;
Albert had observed that the beggar carried&#xD;
under his arm a small bundle, which he' now&#xD;
unrolled. It proved to be a long; singular&#xD;
looking garment, but not wholly unknown to&#xD;
the reader, who will recognize it as the same&#xD;
worn by Weird Elsie.&#xD;
" Put this on," said the stroller, "as quickly&#xD;
as possible. It has done good service on several&#xD;
occasions, and P pray heaven that it may on&#xD;
this.  You observe that it has a hood like -&#xD;
domino-pull it over your face. Now we are&#xD;
ready."&#xD;
The parties issued from  the cell, and after&#xD;
going a few yards, the mendicant stopped and&#xD;
unlocked another door ; it was the chamber of&#xD;
justice where Louis Vidal had been conducted&#xD;
to await tle pleasure of Mark Donhead. = The&#xD;
youth was sitting in a disconsolate manner ujon&#xD;
a heap of straw, where our hero had passed&#xD;
some uncomfortable hours-hinislf.&#xD;
.The lad started up in great astonishment, but&#xD;
Willie laid his finger upon his lips, and signified&#xD;
by a gesture that he should follow them ; which&#xD;
was a thing so agreeable to his own feelings,&#xD;
that he obeyed with wonderful alacrity. Ob.&#xD;
serving the profoundest silence, and agitated by&#xD;
numberless fears, the parties glided like mid-&#xD;
night spectres towards'the Silver Bell.&#xD;
So strong were the emotions of Lady Eveline,&#xD;
that she was several times in danger of becom-&#xD;
ing unconscious; but Albert supported hei and&#xD;
whispered words of cheer. She trembled at the&#xD;
echo of every sound ; the damp currents of air,&#xD;
sweeping from different passages, sounded 'to&#xD;
her like the wings of death, and' chilled her&#xD;
blood until 'it seemed to be congealing within&#xD;
her veins. The horror with' whieh the baditti&#xD;
had inspired' her mind had nearly dethroned&#xD;
the powers of reason and sell-consciousness ; but&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
~ceNcLUsIoN. i&#xD;
&#xD;
HE monk continued: " One day, I saw&#xD;
KJthe captain conversing with a man whose&#xD;
appearance struck me as resembling, in many&#xD;
respects, the servant with whom the children of&#xD;
Sit Williamhado last been seen. When I was&#xD;
alone with Donhead, he told me that, the per-&#xD;
son's name was Peter Vidal; and that he had&#xD;
a daughter of uncommon beauty, - to whom be&#xD;
(the captain) was about to be wedded.  This&#xD;
information keited my curiosity, for I was still&#xD;
hoping that some fortunate chance would di-&#xD;
'vulge the secret of the disappearance of those&#xD;
whom I had promised to protect, should they&#xD;
evrneed a protector.  Full of these feelings,&#xD;
Visited Vidal's cottage, and when I beheld&#xD;
the sweet fate of yonder maiden, I could&#xD;
seamcely doubt that I had found the daughter of&#xD;
Sir William."&#xD;
The monk, as he spoke, pointed to Isandra,&#xD;
and immediately all eyes were turned in that&#xD;
direction.&#xD;
"The damsel certainly bears a striking re-&#xD;
semblance in features, to Sir 'William Win-&#xD;
borne l" exclaimed the Lord of Moteombe.&#xD;
"This is indeed a strangely interesting nar-&#xD;
rative."&#xD;
&#xD;
The relation of the monk had been listened&#xD;
to by Casside (as we prefer to call him) and&#xD;
Isandra and Louis with absorbing interest ; and&#xD;
when the last announcement we made concern-&#xD;
ing the fair shepherdess, our hero could not re-&#xD;
press an exclamation of joyful surprise.&#xD;
"Before proceeding," added the monk, "I&#xD;
will call the attention of this gentle company to&#xD;
yonder lad, who, though not dressed in the&#xD;
garments legitimately belonging to his sex, will&#xD;
still, by his features, give additional weight to&#xD;
the statements I have already made."&#xD;
Poor Louis blushed like a bashful girl,..and&#xD;
shrank from the earnest glances that were in-&#xD;
stantly fastened upon him. Lord Moteombe&#xD;
looked attentively at Louis, and affirmed that&#xD;
" all those persons familiar with the features of&#xD;
Lord Winborne would not be at a loss to -dis-&#xD;
cover a strong resemblance upon the face of the&#xD;
youth ;"- who doubtless at that moment vivid'&#xD;
ly recalled the prediction of Weird Elsie con-&#xD;
cerning the boots and spurs.&#xD;
" Weird Elsie," resumed father David, with&#xD;
a smile, addressing Louis, " promised you the&#xD;

dred iorins that the prophecy will prove no&#xD;
falehood.  But to go on with my story: Upon&#xD;
questioning Isandra in regard to her early life,&#xD;
Found that she had but little knowledge of it;&#xD;
for children of four years soon forget the tran-&#xD;
sactions of so early a period of their existence.&#xD;
She remembered, only, that many years ago&#xD;
she had lived somewhere else ; but all the par-,&#xD;
tieulars of the manner of living, etc., were&#xD;
almost entirely obliterated; she retained no&#xD;
knowledge of any other mother than the wife of&#xD;
Peter Vidal, whom she had always considered&#xD;
as such, until the time of her death, which event&#xD;
occurred some four years ago; since which time&#xD;
the care of Louis and the domestic affairs had&#xD;
devolved solely upon her.. I exerted all my&#xD;
powers to gain the confidence of Vidal, and sue-&#xD;
eeede4 beyond my expectations. One night,&#xD;
when deep in his cups, he confessed to me that&#xD;
Isandra and Louis were not his children; and&#xD;
that he received a yearly stipend for their&#xD;
maintenance.I&#xD;
"'They are'sprung,' said he, ' from a noble&#xD;
house, whose ancestral glory has departed for-&#xD;
ever. They are the children of Sir William&#xD;
Winborne.'&#xD;
":He died, possessed, I believe, of consid-&#xD;
erable wealth," I remarked, carelessly.&#xD;
"' He did,' replied Vidal, ' and the bulk of&#xD;
it is now in possession of Stephen Landsmere,&#xD;
a distant relative on my lord's side, who would'&#xD;
have been the legal heir, providing the latter&#xD;
had died childless.''%&#xD;
"' These assertions,' he added, 'are not&#xD;
mere:fabrications of my own; I have papers at&#xD;
the cottage to prove all I say.' "&#xD;
' Anddid you manage to procure those im-&#xD;
portant documents ?" asked Lord Motcombe,&#xD;
eagerly.&#xD;
:" I did," replied the monk, " and here they&#xD;
are; I confide them to the care of his highness,&#xD;
that he may examine them when it shall be his&#xD;
pleasure to do so.".&#xD;
Father David (Lord 'Cranston) produced&#xD;
from beneath his domino a bundle of papers,&#xD;
and with a low bow, placed them in the lands of&#xD;
thesdistinguished-looking youth, who had given&#xD;

Albert started in astonishment, as he had done&#xD;
on the previous occasion when that term had;&#xD;
been employed.&#xD;
"Do not be surprised, my Lord-.Ethelbert,"&#xD;
said the personage'referred- to, addressing himn&#xD;
self to our hero. ".Ilam called Edward, and in&#xD;
a few days, God willing, shall be crowned king&#xD;
of England."&#xD;
With glowing cheek and beating heart, Al-&#xD;
bert hastened to throw himself at Prince Ed-&#xD;
ward's feet--that distinguished personage who&#xD;
was to be afterwards known as Edward III.,&#xD;
and whose renown as a sovereign was destined&#xD;
to spread far and wide.&#xD;
" Arise, sir!" said the prince, graciously.&#xD;
"I have not forgotten the important service&#xD;
which you rendered me_ so recently. It shall&#xD;
be mine to look into this affair which concerns&#xD;
so intimately yonder blushing maiden and the&#xD;
youth beside her, and to restore them to the&#xD;
position which they should justly occupy. I&#xD;
am glad that it will shortly be in my power tb&#xD;
advance their fortunes and yours. The indi-&#xD;
vidual'upon whom your eyes are now fastened,&#xD;
is my uncle-.-the Earl of Kent."&#xD;
Albert tendered his respects to the latter in a&#xD;
manner becoming his rank, and according to&#xD;
the custom of the times.&#xD;
"By the way," added Prince Edward, mu-&#xD;
singly, " as soon as our coronation has taken&#xD;
place, we must mate out full and complete jus.&#xD;
tice to Sir Hugh Sjencer and his reprobate son ;&#xD;

kindly to the monk,."be good enough to pry&#xD;

sprung up between them. This. information&#xD;
interested me exceedingly, as may be supposed ;&#xD;
inasmuch as it had a direct bearing.upon the&#xD;
happiness of one whom I considered my protege.&#xD;
"I requested Louis to describe the young&#xD;
man as minutely as possible, and he did so.&#xD;
The moment I saw Casside (for it must be- re-&#xD;
collected that I was blind only when I chose to&#xD;
be) at the Silver Bell, I recognized the subject&#xD;
of the lad's description.  Schooled as I was in&#xD;
the ways of the world, I needed no second&#xD;
glance to tell me that he was not what his gar&#xD;
noted. I was confirmed in this opinion when&#xD;
I noticed more particularly the value and work&#xD;
manship of the sword which hung at his side;&#xD;
for it certainly was not in keeping with his rus&#xD;
set coat. His moody and dejected-looks showed&#xD;
me, at once, that he was laboring under some&#xD;
heavy disappointment ;and this fact, added t&#xD;
thev circustances already ,mentioned, gave mi&#xD;
aiu instantaneous clue to his real name and char&#xD;
aster.    .&#xD;
"The conviction that next followed wa&#xD;
equally natural ; for, if the young Lord o&#xD;
Moteombe had loved imprudently, Isandra, o&#xD;
aUl others, was most likely to be the object o&#xD;
his affections; for, begging the damsel's pardon&#xD;
she was exceedingly fair to lidok upon."&#xD;
"eExcuse the interruption," said Lord Mot&#xD;
combe, "but I would ask if you were known t&#xD;
Joachim Capet, or any of the banditti, in tha&#xD;
disguise'?"&#xD;
"I was not," answered Cranston. "A&#xD;
Strolling Willie and Weird Elsie, no one share&#xD;
my secret, and I have the consciousness of fee&#xD;
&#xD;
ER BELL&#xD;
ing that I have accomplished some good' in,&#xD;
these characters. Mark Donhead, struck with,&#xD;
your fine athletic figure," continued the monk,&#xD;
addressing our herb, " was anxious to enroll'&#xD;
you among his men ; and with that object in'&#xD;
view, planned the taking - of your purse, with&#xD;
Joachim Capet, in order to compel you to some&#xD;
decisive step. I frustrated the "scheme in a&#xD;
manner already known to you; but on the fol-&#xD;
lowing day you were robbed in the forest, with-&#xD;
out my knowledge.    Having learned   more&#xD;
perfectly the, designs of Mark in relation. to&#xD;
Isicndra, upon mature reflection, I changed my&#xD;
views somewhat, and resolved to advise you to&#xD;
accept of his proposals ; in order that you might&#xD;
be able to assist in baffling his intentions, so&#xD;
that sufficient time might be gained for the men-&#xD;
at-arms to arrive which his highness had already&#xD;
*sent for."&#xD;
- I am curious to know in what manner you&#xD;
t learned the fact that any of the king's men had&#xD;
been sent for'?" said the Earl of Kent.&#xD;
I   " You shall be gratified ; Joachim  Capet&#xD;
listened at your chamber door, and heard you&#xD;
speaking to that effect."&#xD;
" Ab, the scoundrel!" added the earl, with'&#xD;
; a smile.&#xD;
- " I am anxious to hear about this fair of&#xD;
d Sir Hugh Spencer and the Lady Eveline;"&#xD;
said the prince.&#xD;
o    " Godfrey Ridenger, or more properly, Sir&#xD;
e Hugh Spencer, planned and execite.d that vil-&#xD;
- lanous enterprise without my knowledge; -ad&#xD;
even Mark Donhead had little to say, or do, in&#xD;
s the matter. 'Had I but had any intimation of&#xD;
f what was intended, the transaction would never,&#xD;

at " You have not alluded to the robbery of my&#xD;
Lord of Motcombe'?" said the: Earl of Kent.'&#xD;
