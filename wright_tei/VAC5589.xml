            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THESE pages are the contents of a few leaves of the book of life, in which memory, the recording angel of the soul, most religiously registers all the thoughts and actions of which the real life of every accountable being is composed. The hero—designated Archibald Cameron—is no fanciful character, but a real personage.</p>
            <p>Some of the incidents may appear exaggerated, and may be deemed by some as wild and improbable. The case, however, is far otherwise.</p>
            <p>Any one who carefully reads the book of his own life, will find that it contains far more startling incidents than he is at first apt to think, though a bitter experience ought to have taught him a different lesson.</p>
            <p>The province that the book occupies is new, and may, it is hoped, prove to most readers interesting.</p>

               <p>TURNING to a secluded by-path in one of the most romantic parts in the north of England, a small valley, consisting of about a hundred acres of rich, well-cultivated land, suddenly bursts upon your view. Through the midst<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5589-00000005"/> of it, there runs a solitary stream, whose clear water sparkles and laughs in the bright rays of the sun. At the upper end of a beautiful meadow, stands an old mansion-rural in the extreme—half concealed by the luxuriant foliage of some half a dozen sturdy old English oaks, that stand like faithful sentinels around the palace of a king. Solitary as a hermit in his mountain cave, and, like him, gray and weak, bowing his venerable head under the weight of years, the melancholy ruins contain indications of former strength and past renown, the warrior's pomp and beauty's pride, reminding us of our incurable blindness to futurity, ever lured by the creation of our own fancy, till the rude hand of the spoiler sweeps away the woof in which we had vainly thought a secure resting-place had been found. Behind this massive monument of feudal tyranny—whose secret passages and solitary cells, point significantly to many a revolting scene that they have witnessed—a projecting rock towers majestically several feet above the level of the roof, and seems, from a distance, as if actually stooping to embrace it with an air of maternal tenderness. To enter it, you must pass over a huge stone thrown over the stream for a foot-bridge, and carefully secured by means of strong bars of iron. A few yards below this, lays the cart-road, leading through a much wider and shallower part of the stream, over whose smooth sandy bottom, an undisturbed community of minnows gambol in a delirium of delight. The only way that now leads to the door is through the front garden, in entering which you pass under a small archway formed by two blackthorns that have grown into each other. The under part forming the arch is remarkably smooth, being beautifully trimmed, and so thick, that the sun cannot see through it; while the upper part is formed into a most fantastical shape, which you would, at a glance, take to be a badly made figure of a goat. On inquiry you will be told that it was at first designed to represent a man in a stooping posture, as if intently watching the movements of an enemy—another sad proof of the former troubled state of quiet old England.</p>
               <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5589-00000006"/>
               <p>Less than a century back, had you accidentally passed that way, you might have seen a curly-headed little boy walking thoughtfully about; and had you conversed with him, you would have been greatly surprised at a countenance so sweet and young retaining all the gravity of a philosopher, while answering the most trivial questions. This habit was the natural result of the solitary life he had hitherto led. He had no children to play with. Living in such an out-of-the-way place, he saw but few strangers. He heard no conversation but on subjects far above his years. His intellect was thus prematurely taxed. In his case the order of nature was partially reversed. The child could scarcely be said to have been father to the man. He was a man as it regards his mind; while in every other respect a mere boy.</p>
               <p>His father, the rightful heir of the once rich and celebrated lordship which he still nominally possessed, was a man, though reduced in circumstances, richly endowed with mental wealth—a noble intellect—a warm and honest heart. To the son, nature had been still more prodigal. He was the Solomon of his house, having, when a child, made wisdom his choice. In after years, he found that he had chosen the good part, of which the bitterest of his enemies could not deprive him.</p>
               <p>Having little of this world's wealth to bequeath to his promising child, the father became anxious that, with the pride of ancestry as an incentive to exertions, he should emulate their virtues, and restore, if not raise to more than its pristine glory, the name he bore.</p>
               <p>He was allowed, and at times encouraged, to indulge his inclination for reading. The musty tomes that filled the old family library, from which so many generations of his noble ancestors had derived pleasure and instruction, and in which many of their exploits were recorded, he read with the greatest avidity and delight. Then came the pleasure of telling all that he remembered, to his delighted father. Many and holy were the hours they spent in pacing hand in hand the shady walk on the high terrace above<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5589-00000007"/> the flower garden while the cool evening breeze swept mournfully through the trees, as if heavy with the recollection of the past, the many buoyant steps, the light and happy hearts, the hero's manly form and beauty's exquisite figure, that once, linked hand in hand, bounded gaily over the same lovely walk—talked of eternal friendship under the same venerable trees—looked in each others arms, breathed the tender vows that rivet the golden chain that bind for life, in the shady bower half way down into the garden—and drank inspiration from the same romantic scenes, upon which they gazed with such ineffable delight. With the same vague melancholy pleasure, their ancestors often watched the sun darting behind the western hills, like a strong eagle, having leisurely measured his circuit, descending with increasing velocity as he nears his nest, where his young are anxiously waiting for his return. Sweet and tender emotions trembled in their bosoms as nature, became contagious with the influence of the queen of night, as she modestly looked through the thick foliage, life some beauteous nymph, having just left her pure home, timidly and stealthily advancing to gaze upon a ruder scene, and less pure inhabitants, and though exerting a powerful influence over them, remaining herself uninfluenced and holy in her own pure sphere. For the music of the spheres, they mistook the groaning of nature as she travails in pain, lamenting that her lord and guardian should have violated her; every night weeping herself asleep, and every morning waking with tears in her eyes at finding herself still his slave. The sun comes out of his gorgeous chamber every morning to bid her not despair, but be glad—smile through her tears—cherish the bright hope of the future—that he is still faithful to his duty, in numbering the days of her captivity and humiliation. With his clear brow, courteous smile, warm heart, keen brilliant eye, he looks upon her as affectionate as when pure in the days of her sweet infancy, virgin beauty, and blooming health, with the dew of her youth fresh upon her; when the morning stars sang the hymn of her nativity, and the sons of God, transported with<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5589-00000008"/> the sight, shouted for joy. He never fails to clear her clouded brow,—dry her burning tears,—warm her shivering frame,—bring the hectic glow to her wan, sunken cheek,—and mantle her pensive and dejected countenance with an apparent sensation of delight. All her minstrels, grateful for the change, every morning chant her natal hymn, which was caught as it dropped from angelic lips, and is never allowed to cease, but like echo, when it seems gradually to cease in one place, is suddenly caught up in another; so that as the sun never ceases to watch the movements of the earth, the song never dies;—there is neither speech nor language where it is not sung; as if a constant effort were made to while her away from the recollection of her disgrace, and the fearful anticipation of the purifying fiery ordeal, when the spirit of her betrayer will have passed away. Sometimes parent and child would stand pressing each others hand with an electric effect, in silence, enjoying a pleasing sensation, such as language can never produce, but which <unclear>the</unclear> first word, like death, deprives of life.</p>
               <p>When these ecstatic meetings were over, Mr. Cameron generally proceeded to the stables to see that the horses had been properly attended to. In the meantime little Archibald would run with all his might to his dear mother, and covering her face with kisses, that were most liberally acknowledged, would tell her all that he remembered of what he had been reading, and all that passed between him and his father,—not forgetting what his father said about the possibility of a certain boy becoming the pride of his country, and the benefactor of his race. The mother, losing all command over her feelings, would at times gaze with delirious fondness on her hope and pride, while tears chased each other down her lovely cheek.</p>
               <p>When Archibald was sent to bed, the boy of larger growth, the father and husband, began his saying, and went over all the ground that the mother had so recently and joyously traversed with the son, and over which, so far from being fatigued, she would have gladly gone again and again, till morning. The elder Cameron, not satisfied with the bare text, made a running<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5589-00000009"/> comment, as he went along, which being here and there greatly improved by Mrs. Cameron, became somewhat voluminous, ere they began to feel cold, though the drowsy fire had retired to rest for some time.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cameron was a remarkable woman in many respects, She was not what some men would call beautiful, nor was she, by any means, plain looking. But there was an undefined something about her, such as would have made an orphan, that had no recollection of his mother, suppose, she was exactly like Mrs. Cameron; or that Mrs. Cameron was the exact REAL of the IDEAL that he had formed and cherished of his dead mother. Her countenance was extremely sweet, and her manners fascinating. Her voice was rich and mellifluous—her speech nature's music. In her younger days she had been somewhat gay, though never wild. The sorrows of life, like a pack of strong hounds following a weak and timid hare, had driven her out of every refuge where she tried to shelter herself, till, at length, she was induced to seek a better refuge than earth can afford, by placing her affections on things in heaven, where the sorrows incident to this life could not follow her. From that hour, though in the world, she lived above the world. She was the daughter of a Scotch Presbyterian clergyman, and her chief desire was that little Archibald should be trained up for the ministry. The father, on the other hand, was determined that his son should enter the army, where so many of his ancestors had distinguished themselves. These elements of discord never had an opportunity of developing themselves. Mrs. Cameron had made the character of her husband her peculiar study. She knew to a nicety the <emph>when</emph> and the <emph>how</emph> to speak. Her husband was her captive—her loving slave. He knew it. He was proud of it. It was her glory, and it was his happiness. So fathered and so mothered, how could little Archibald be otherwise than sweet tempered, intelligent, and good! His was a rare privilege. His was a noble heritage of the choicest virtues. But an incarnate virtue, the great son of the mother that hid many things in her heart, did not escape<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5589-00000010"/> cape calumny. Neither was dear Archibald's path, good as he was, strewn with flowers. Nevertheless, he was a lovely, fragrant rose, though blooming beautifully, and emitting the sweetest odor, from a thorny thicket.</p>

               <p>"MY dear boy," exclaimed Mrs. Cameron, what can be the matter? Why you are as wet as possible, Archie. You did not fall into the water, I hope?"</p>
               <p>"No, but I plunged into the water," replied Archie, with evident satisfaction, and perhaps a little pride, too, wiping the perspiration from his smooth, capacious forehead, and putting his fingers through his luxuriant locks. An artist could not wish a more exquisite subject for the display of his genius.</p>
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5589-00000011"/>
               <p>"Well," continued the mother, "and what made you do that, my dear boy?"</p>
               <p>"Guess, mother?" was the reply.</p>
               <p>"How can I guess, child?"</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"Because I was not with you, my dear."</p>
               <p>"Nay, mother," rejoined Archie with a roguish laugh: "had you been there, you would have no room for conjecture. You would have seen what took place, as well as I."</p>
               <p>"Archie, you must not talk to your mother in that manner."</p>
               <p>"Come, come! you are angry now. I know you are. I did not mean to offend you, dear mother. Give me a warm, nice kiss, now, and I will tell you all. I am burning to do so. I know you will be pleased with my story."</p>
               <p>"There, now begin—you troublesome little fellow."</p>
               <p>"No, I must have another, that was not half long enough."</p>

               <p>"You know the wooden bridge, half way to my uncle's? When I got there, no bridge was to be found. The heavy rain of last night had so swollen the river, that the whole bridge was carried away by the flood."</p>
               <p>"Well," said the mother, pale with terror and anxiety. "You did not attempt to swim across, my dear?"</p>
               <p>"No," replied the excited little speaker, "but as I was turning back, I saw three little girls, who had strayed from the men that were spreading the hay they had just saved from the flood, playing together near the shallow part of the river, where I thought I might be able to cross without danger. As I was approaching them, I heard a loud scream, and two of the girls running with all their might towards the men, piercing the air with their cries, while the third was carried away by the current. I had pulled off my shoes, and was carrying my jacket upon my arm. I threw them and my cap down, and plunged into the river, and ere the men came—which would have been too late to save her—I had brought her out of the water. Was not that doing good, dear mother?"</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5589-00000012"/>
               <p>"My dear boy," exclaimed the bewildered parent, "thank heaven that, thou art safe."</p>
               <p>"You look pale, dear mother," cried the boy, evidently disappointed and crest-fallen. "Ought I not to have done it? Did I not do good? Have I disappointed you, mother?"</p>
               <p>"No, my dear," was the brief reply—accompanied, however, with a look of inimitable tenderness. "I must retire for a few minutes. Go, my dear, and get your clothes changed."</p>
               <p>Archie know her meaning, and obeyed.</p>
               <p>Coming down from his bedroom, he quietly stole into his mother's, and there she was, bathed in tears, thanking God for saving the life of her darling boy, and dedicating him afresh to his Preserver; imploring with a fervency that almost terrified the child, that he might become a minister of the gospel, and be made eminently useful in bringing souls to Christ.</p>
               <p>He stole out undiscovered, and immediately went up among the rocks, behind the house. He there crept into a cave in the rock, and began, for the first time in his life, to think seriously ously of his sins. He wept bitterly, and prayed long and fervently that he might be saved through the blood of Christ, and become such a man as his dear mother prayed he might.</p>
               <p>When he got home, he thought he had never seen his mother look half so beautiful. Her face, shone like the face of an angel. Her smile was so sweet and mournful that he felt a kind of awe in kissing her, of which he had never before been conscious.</p>
               <p>The mother, too, thought and felt that the boy was more of a man than usual, and challenged confidence, which she had hitherto denied him. Thus a sympathy of a new character sprang up between them. The mother viewed the sanctity of the relationship existing between her and her only child, in a new and holy light, that seemed to have streamed down from heaven, in the ecstacy of communion with God. The boy began to fear and hope in a manner he had never feared or hoped before. The tears shed in the cave in the rock, had removed the film that darkened his vision. His perception had on a sudden become much<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5589-00000013"/> stronger. He saw further, and with greater distinctness than before. New objects, teeming with interest, floated around him wherever he looked. Like the servant of the prophet, he saw every place filled with chariots and horses of fire, leagued on the side of virtue, and arrayed against vice. Responsibility met him at every turn,—smiled, and whispered encouragement when he was doing good,—frowned and threatened when he was doing evil. What a change had that day been wrought in his views and feelings? How different everything looked? He had risen in the morning, still childish and thoughtless, dreaming that everything was given to him, or even by nature, his own,—ere the evening, he found them only lent, and a most solemn account to be rendered of the manner in which every gift was employed. A revenue must accrue to the great proprietor from the earthly house that we now occupy, and the noble and holy thoughts with which it was originally furnished, but which the first tenant foolishly and wickedly pledged to the arch usurer, the evil one, who is still diligently employed in palming his own counterfeits in their stead.</p>
               <p>Poor Archibald felt most keenly that he must henceforth completely abandon the possibility of gratifying his dear father, by devoting himself to the military profession. The fervent prayers of his mother,—his own prayers and vows, made in the cave in the rock, bound him forever, soul and body, to the service of his Maker.</p>
               <p>The boy loved his father, and felt an indescribable agony at the thought of causing him the least pain. His young and loving heart was the sacrifice that bled upon the altar of his devotion. He often wished he might die, and go to heaven, before his kind father knew that he had the remotest intention to disobey his injunction. At times he was encouraged with the hope that God might answer his prayers, and change his father's heart, and make him willing that he should obey the father of his spirit rather than the father of his flesh, when the will of the earthly did not move in harmony with that of the heavenly.</p>
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5589-00000014"/>
               <p>All the books he saw in the family library contained nothing but extravagant accounts of military exploits—the imaginary achievements of knight-errantry,—and an old three folio treatise, written as he was told, by Peter the Hermit, to prove that military prowess was the only real evidence of genuine religion. All these books, although he had read them with pleasure, failed to kindle in his heart that enthusiasm for military renown, which they were intended to create.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cameron had for some time been somewhat discouraged at the apparent coolness with which his son talked of martial glory. Though most self-willed on many subjects, he possessed too much sense not to perceive that no man can excel in a profession unless he makes it his delight. His views, upon this subject may have been considerably modified in consequence of his having been placed in a profession for which he had no taste. The inevitable consequence followed,—a complete failure.</p>
               <p>Archibald Cameron went to bed that evening with new views and feelings. He prayed fervently vently that he might become a minister of the Gospel of peace; that the pretty little girl, whose life he saved, might be his wife; that they might have his grandfather's old manse in Scotland; and that they might live long and happy in the enjoyment of good health, with little children, all pretty like their dear mother.</p>
               <p>He did not sleep for a great while. When he did he was awaked by the cries of the little girls, ringing in his ears, as they ran to the men for help. He did not sleep again for some time. He fancied he saw the little girl carried away by the current, and though not exactly asleep, nor yet dreaming, he jumped out of bed in great haste to rescue her. She was not floating upon the strong current. He had not plunged into the water to save her. He crept to bed dreadfully disappointed. The thought of her soon brought him to humor again. How beautiful she looked, he said aloud to himself, when she was carried out of the water. If she was pretty then, what must she be when beautifully dressed with her flowing<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5589-00000015"/> hair nicely combed? I wish she would come and live with us. I am sure mother would like her. I wonder what her name is? I wish I knew. She must be some great lady. I could never believe the nonsense that is written about the valor of knight-errants, though I think I could fight for her as valiant as any of them. I wonder whether the fat little boy that ran to the river with the men, is in love with her? He seemed very much frightened and cried too, when he saw her. In love with her? To be sure he is. She won't have him though, I am sure she won't. What if she did. There is no knowing. Nonsense, I am a much finer looking boy than he is, and much older—taller too, almost of my head. I wish I knew who she is, and who that fat boy was. He cannot be her brother, he is not pretty enough. His face is so unlike hers. I am sure I could keep her if I had the old manse. Why not keep a wife as well as grandfather, when he lived there. What if I could not get it. Then I should turn farmer. Father would give me a cow and a mare, and a few sheep. I would soon raise a stock, and keep her like a queen.</p>
               <p>The next day Master Cameron felt very queer and uneasy. He could neither read, nor write, nor sit still with his mother, for any length of time. He went out alone, not taking even his dog with him. As he walked along the small stream that ran by the house, he felt an unaccountable inclination to plunge in to save somebody. At times he started, thinking he heard some one scream. He had paid unusual attention to his toilet before he left the house. Fearing a straggling look, if seen by her, might be against him, he went back, borrowed his father's strong hair brush and spent a good deal of time in adjusting his curls. He then climbed up the hill that overlooked the river, and the field where the men were making hay the day before. The hay had been removed. There was no one in the field. Yet Archie thought it looked a very remarkable field. The windings of the river too, were more curious and interesting than usual. The spot where he rescued the beautiful little girl, was peculiarly fascinating<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5589-00000016"/> ing. It riveted his attention. He could hardly take his eyes from it. When he did, he thought everything looked dark and dismal. He strayed on, unconscious of the distance he was going from home, till the river arrested his further progress. He stood on the brink. It was the dear spot upon which she was laid, all dripping from the water. He lay down upon the grass and kissed the place, where he thought her beautiful head lay. The shadows upon the mountain warned him of the approach of evening. He wended his solitary way homeward, stopping at short intervals to look whether the dear spot was still there, as if half afraid lest that sweet river and that dear field should run away.</p>
               <p>Coming near the house, he was amazed to see the rough cart road, that passed under the windows of his mother's bed-room, covered over with heaps of straw. The old servant asked him rather angrily where had he been? He answered her somewhat carelessly that he had only been for a walk. He then asked her where his mother was. The old servant shook her head mournfully, and burst into tears. Half frantic with apprehension, he rushed toward his mother's bedroom. His progress was arrested by the doctor, who told him that he must not proceed further, that his mother was too ill to see him. He turned deadly pale, trembled from head to foot, and gave the doctor a bewildered look that half frightened him. He forced his way to his mother's bedside, fell down upon his knees and sobbed aloud. His mother awoke from her slumbers. She embraced him tenderly, told him to seek the Lord with all his heart; that she had a good hope God would answer her prayers in his behalf, and make him a good minister of his Word. She could say no more. Her pale lips quivered, her bosom heaved, she breathed quicker and less freely. She tremulously grasped his hand between both hers, and gave him a look that seemed to penetrate his inmost thoughts. She then lifted up her eyes to heaven, her lips moving as if in prayer, her hands still grasping his, as if fearful, lest they should be parted.</p>
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5589-00000017"/>
               <p>Day after day her anxious husband watched with trembling solicitude her white little hand, as it thinned into a skeleton. She tried every morning to persuade him and her sorrowing boy, that she was much better—indeed nearly well—made efforts to be cheerful and while away their thoughts from the painful subject that engrossed them; till, despite, her endeavors, she would betray a look of fearful anxiety or let drop an expression that like a thunderbolt instantaneously burst the thick and dark cloud under which the trembled, and upon which, they had long gazed with painful apprehension. The waters of grief then flowed freely and copiously. In such moments she would tell them not to sorrow as those who had no hope that her faith waxed stronger and stronger;—that her title to the inheritance of the saints in light became more evident every hour;—that her path was the path of the just which was as the morning flight that shineth more and more unto the perfect day;—that the darkness so long settled upon her soul was dispersed by the light of God's countenance as that cloudless day of happiness approached;—that she had a good hope, through grace which had long been her chief joy, like an endearing companion, travelling with her through each stage of her sorrowful pilgrimage—beguiling the tedium of the way,—cheering her drooping spirit,—and constantly reminding her of the promise, "I wilt never leave nor forsake thee." When very weak, she would press their hands, and look at them tenderly, sweetly, though mournfully, whispering,—courage—courage. Alone with her husband, she would speak much of her darling Archie, imploring him to allow the boy a full access to the library that her dear father had bequeathed him, and to educate him for the ministry. He was but too glad to satisfy her. Indeed he would have parted with all he had to remove the least burden from her mind. Poor Archie never quitted the room, unless desired to leave. He then repaired to his solitary cave to renew his vows; and pray that his dear mother's life might be spared, were it only, till she might see him a minister.</p>
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5589-00000018"/>
               <p>The lamp of life had nearly burnt out. Now and then, indeed, an unusual flash of brilliant light glared through the half-closed windows of the tenement of clay in which the pure spirit still lingered, loath to leave her old battered dwelling, though she knew that a more gorgeous residence, the house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, was ready for her reception. She told those around her to prepare to meet their God—to build on the right foundation—to have no confidence in the flesh.</p>
               <p>She seemed for days before her death to live on the threshold of heaven, holding an immediate communion with both worlds. At length the hour of her departure arrived. She had become so familiarized with the unseen, that she smiled at death, as a friend coming to rescue her from imminent danger. Having obtained a promise from her husband and child, that they would earnestly seek the favor which is better than life,—the blessing that maketh rich and addeth no sorrow there with, and that they should meet her in heaven, she seemed for a time entranced with delight and rapt in contemplation. Not a breath, a flash, a throb of unextinguished life stole over her placid countenance,—thrilled a fibre,—or heaved the sunken breast. She seemed like a seraph arrested in his course by some wonderful object, which he regards with breathless attention and overwhelming delight, On a sudden, her consciousness seemed to return. She turned to those that surrounded her dying bed and told them to hold fast the profession of their faith, that it was the one thing needful, and that death, after all the terrors of nature, was nothing more to the Christian than an easy process by which mortality was left behind. Her eyes glowed with intelligence, her sweet countenance became irradiated with smiles of ineffable benignity,—an unearthly brightness mantled around her. She stretched one hand to those with whom she was parting, the other was grasping the hope that she had as an anchor of the soul both steadfast and sure, entering within the veil. She left the world with a smile of triumph, that she carried with<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5589-00000019"/> her to her grave. In a moment the greetings of seraphim succeeded the lamentations of her friends—mortality was swallowed up of life.</p>

               <p>THE day of the funeral arrived. It was a memorial day at the old mansion. Ichabod seemed written upon everything. The glory had, indeed, departed some days before. The tabernacle where it dwelt was to be removed too. While the bereaved had even the casket in their possession, though the treasure was gone, they felt not utterly forsaken. Like the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who, in their deep calamity, clung with bewildered fondness to their beautiful temple, though deprived of its glory,<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5589-00000020"/> and power to succor them. Several of the relations of the departed were present. They took great notice of Archibald. They thought him so like his dear mother, the same fine forehead,—the same sweet eyes,—the same heavenly smile,—the same pensive, chastened expression of countenance. Archie, too, thought. But his thoughts were not of this world. He was endeavoring to conceive the happiness his dear departed mother enjoyed, while he and his dejected father were having sorrow upon sorrow. How, he said to himself, can she be happy, if she know, that we are so miserable after her?</p>
               <p>Fearing the thought was blasphemous, he went to his own little bedroom to pray God to forgive him, for thinking him unkind in taking away his dear mother, and in so often wishing her back again, and especially, in so often doubting that she could be happy, while her absence was making them so unhappy. There he was in the little room hallowed by so many recollections of her morning and evening visits;—never more to be renewed, unless, indeed, her dear spirit should continue to watch over her darling boy. He felt his little heart very full. He tried to weep. His heart beat so violently that he lay upon the dressing table, putting his hand between it and his side. It was of no avail. He wondered that it did not break.</p>
               <p>He was gently touched upon the shoulder by a new arrival, who called his dear mother cousin. She spoke; so kindly to him and smiled so like his mother, that he put his trembling hands round her neck and sobbed aloud upon her bosom. Weeping is contagious. She sobbed too. Archie felt half happy in her gentle embrace. He had long looked, among those that came to pay the last tribute, of respect and affection to the remains of his departed mother, for some one like her. He was not disappointed, for he never thought there was. This person, however, seemed to possess some of her kind ways, something that reminded him more of his dear mother than any other person, just as her likeness did. Alas, what was her likeness to herself, the silent lips, dead eyes, soulless face, to her own beautiful speaking<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5589-00000021"/> ing, kissing lips, lovely, affectionate, tenderly sympathising eyes, and a countenance lighted up with a soul that a seraph might envy. This person had been sent to him by his father to bring him down that he might take his last look of his dear mother, and imprint the farewell kiss on her sweet, beautiful lips, ere the lid of the coffin was screwed. Dreadful message! Who would be the bearer of such to an only child, that was never a whole day in his life from his mother's sight. Where there is a large family, the death of a parent opens a new source of sympathy between the brothers and sisters, draws them closer to each other, and discovers an ample scope for the exercise of mutual affection. With an only child it is far otherwise. Archibald, like a tender vine, had been almost wholly dependent for support upon his mother. His soul leaned upon hers. He had partaken largely of her spirit. He had scarce an idea, that was not, in one way or other, connected either with her teaching or example.</p>
               <p>When he was told to take the last look of his sweet mother, he felt a kind of freezing sensation tightening round his brain, and gradually extending over his whole body, till the cold perspiration, in lumps as large as peas burst through his forehead, like a hail-storm through a cloud. He gazed upon her long and passionately, kissed her with the greatest fervor, <choice>
                     <sic>snd</sic>
                     <corr>and</corr>
                  </choice> felt as if he could never gaze enough upon her, or kiss her with the ardor and reverence that he desired. The undertaker—the unfortunate man whose power of feeling on such melancholy occasions, had long since been fritted away by daily contact with mourners—gently pulled him away, making most awkward efforts to show that he sympathized with him. Much as if a fox endeavored to show the greatest commiseration for the helpless brood, while running away with their mother. Then, with the zest of a man in his element, he screwed down the lid of the coffin; while father and child felt that their hearts were screwed down also.</p>
               <p>The elder Cameron had not been himself since her death. He had become stupefied to<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5589-00000022"/> that degree, that the medical attendant watched with considerable anxiety, the issue of such an unusual prostration of body and mind. He had not slept since he felt conscious of his irreparable loss. His nerves were completely shattered. He was crushed by the weight and suddenness of the blow. He had no heart for anything. He did not make an effort to bear up under his heavy trial. On their way to the church, he pressed his child's hand between both his. It was the only symptom of consciousness that he showed. He did not speak a single syllable. Archie, too, was silent. But they clung to each other, like companions in shipwreck.</p>
               <p>The old family vault of the Camerons had been opened. Many were the curious eyes that pierced into the last resting place of the illustrious Camerons. It was nearly full. There was only room for one, beside the new tenant of the day. As if the constructor of the vault had been a prophet, he had made it exactly of the required dimensions. Archibald had never seen it till that day, and shuddered to see where so many generations of his noble ancestors lay, and where—how he trembled as he thought of it—his poor mother must remain. He wished he had died on the same day as his dear mother, and were buried in the same coffin with her, sleeping in her embrace till they should wake together, from their long and sweet sleep, in the likeness of Jesus Christ. A vain wish. And yet not begotten by vanity; but by a pure love, unselfish as goodness, stronger than death.</p>
               <p>The child's heart died within him, as he turned his back upon his mother's grave. He knew he should never see another that could fill her place. He gave a tender look towards his father. It was not noticed. He never found his sweet mother miss such a look. She was indeed dead, and he was an orphan.</p>
               <p>It was late in the evening when they reached home. Tea was waiting for them. They could not taste it. Near the fire there was a vacant chair, which riveted their attention. The boy tried to beguile his father's thoughts from the chair to the throne that his dear<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5589-00000023"/> mother occupied in heaven,—told him that their temporary loss was her eternal gain. He kissed him, and looked tenderly in his face. The father thought he spoke so like his mother, that his kiss was so like hers, his ways exactly her ways, and the expression of his countenance painfully similar. He strained him to his bosom and thanked God, that he had such a child to comfort him.</p>
               <p>The clock struck. The father looked bewildered—the boy petrified. It was the hour of prayer. They stood with strained eyes as if almost half expecting that the lost one would make her appearance. It was her choicest moment, in which she always took a peculiar delight. At that moment she was emphatically the priestess of her family. She never could prevail upon her husband, either to read or pray at the family altar. She was, therefore, under the pleasing necessity of doing it herself. The domestics had come to the room mechanically, from the mere force of habit. The boy, with tearful eyes, took his father tenderly by the hand and asked him if he would conduct family worship? The only answer he received was a bewildered, vacant stare, bordering on idiocy. The boy fell upon his knees, crying in his face, "father, won't you read and pray, father, as dear mother used to do?" The scene was too painful. The domestics were leaving the room in confusion, when Archie, summoning all his courage, told them to remain. He took his dear mother's Bible in order to read a portion as she used to read. He could not see; his eyes were dimmed with sorrow. He repeated from memory the twenty-third Psalm. During the recital his emotions often deprived him of utterance. His prayer was short and appropriate, almost in his mother's expressions and tones of voice. It was a melting scene,—not a dry eye in the place. The father wept freely. His clouded brain became clearer. He felt greatly relieved. He told the boy to occupy his mother's chair, that she was not dead while he lived. He then pressed him to his heart, and kissed him with almost as much tenderness as his dear mother used to kiss him.</p>
               <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5589-00000024"/>
               <p>That night Archibald slept with his father, or rather, they lay together; sleep they could not. The father was nervous and restless. The boy resigned and calm, made his pillow wet with the tears of chastened sorrow. The bereaved parent in a painful reverie, talked with the departed partner of his joys and sorrows. He muttered something that the boy did not understand, about money matters, sighed heavily, and shook violently. The child frightened at his father's uneasiness, clasped his little arms round his neck. He started, pressed him to his heart, wept freely; but never spoke a word. He wished to whisper a word of consolation in his child's ear. But he felt no power to articulate a single syllable. He was speechless. How hard and bravely he may have struggled to overcome the strong emotion he betrayed, none can tell. There are moments when the sense of utter desolation chills, nay freezes, the warm source whence the power to console flows, though desire still remains, like a sepulchral lamp, hid in the living grave—the heart. Many men live for years, ere they descend to the grave almost as much sequestered from all earthly sympathies, as if the soul had been already divorced from the body. Such a state is the most wretched of any to which a human being can be doomed.</p>
               <p>In the morning Archie gave his father some verses which he composed in the night, expressive of his own feelings under his irreparable loss.</p>

               <p>Mr. Cameron admired the verses. He copied them in his own handwriting. He thought them a faithful transcript of his own feelings. He made the boy his confidant—told him all his worldly affairs, embarrassments, and the likelihood of their being soon reduced to the greatest poverty. "While your dear mother lived," he said, "I felt certain that she could not fail to secure a comfortable home for us. She was so good, and prudent, and her ways so winning, that none that saw her and conversed<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5589-00000026"/> with her, could have the heart to turn her out of doors, as, I fear, they will do with us."</p>
               <p>"Do not be dejected, dear father," whispered Archie, taking hold of his trembling hand, though scarcely able to speak,—so fraught with sorrow were his own feelings—"let us hope in God, he will be our refuge in this time of trouble. Dear mother always said so. Why should we be cast down, dear father. Though mother is dead, her God still lives. If he helped her, he will help us also."</p>
               <p>"Thou hast thy mother's heart and tongue, Archie, but the rude usurers that will soon make their appearance, will not think so. They are men, my dear boy, and men cannot influence men as women can."</p>
               <p>A bold and loud knock at the door startled them.</p>
               <p>"Surely they cannot come thus early to harrass me," cried Mr. Cameron, deadly pale with fear.</p>
               <p>The old servant, gently tapped at the door—entered—looked embarrassed, and whispered in a voice stifled with passion, that that hateful old Scory was there. "The fiend," exclaimed Mr. Cameron, "let him come in." Archie was going to retire, but his father said, "don't leave, Archie, I have need of thee,"—something he muttered in an undertone, scarcely audible—"to keep me from killing this fiend in human form."</p>
               <p>Archie was terrified at the fury that flashed in his father's eye, and looked with dread to the appearance of the man that caused it.</p>
               <p>He entered with a bland, mournful smile—shook Mr. Cameron with both hands—said how sorry he was to hear of his sad bereavement, and that he should have felt a kind of mournful pleasure in being at Mrs. Cameron's funeral, had he known in time of the poor dear soul's departure from this wicked world. "Ah!" he continued, "it is a great consolation to you, Mr. Cameron, to know she is better off than being in this wicked world. The righteous is always taken away from the evil to come. Oh, this is a wicked world, my dear sir, and as I said, the righteous is taken away from the evil to come. So it was with poor dear Mrs. Cameron. I was<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5589-00000027"/> thankful], when I heard of the melancholy event, that I had delayed till now the painful communication I have to make to you, my dear sir, in the course of my present visit."</p>
               <p>Archie eyed him with indignation. Mr. Cameron trembled with passion. He felt an almost irresistible temptation to take the old hypocrite by the throat. Scory marked the indignation excited by his presence and words, but sat at his ease, feeling sure that the golden chains by which the old eagle was bound, would keep him at a harmless distance from his captor, and as for the young bird, he would soon clip his wings.</p>
               <p>"Now, Mr. Scory," said Mr. Cameron, speaking in a measured tone, which was not very natural to him, but which materially helped him to conceal his indignation—"state what you have to communicate. I see clearly that you possess neither religion, nor even humanity, or you would not violate the sacredness of a grief so great as mine. Since, however, you have proved yourself heartless enough to make a second breach into this house of death, proceed with your message; I will listen with all the patience the excited state of my mind will allow. Let me, however, beseech you to be as brief as possible."</p>
               <p>Scory sat unmoved. He scarcely seemed to notice Mr. Cameron's words, as if such were so familiar to him, that he had long since ceased to regard them but with the greatest, indifference. When he spoke, it was in his usual bland and courteous way. He seemed collected, cool, and determined. Archibald was amazed at his audacity and did not know whether to reward him as a very good or a very bad man. His father, no doubt, thought him a villain; and he looked like one, notwithstanding his talking so much about religion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cameron ordered an early dinner, and pressed his guest to wait, that it would soon be ready. Scory refused, and apologized for calling so early after Mrs. Cameron's death. The fact was he was, obliged to call, however reluctant he might have been to intrude on the privacy of their grief. He said two or three things in an undertone to Mr. Cameron, which Archie<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5589-00000028"/> did not hear, but which seemed of vast import, from the manner in which they were received by his father, for he staggered to his chair as if he had been paralyzed. Scory looked at him with a sarcastic, triumphant smile, that caused all the blood in Archie's veins to rush into his face. He thought his father must have been dreadfully insulted by him, and was going to speak, till he saw him walk proudly, or rather with a carelessness that offended even a homebred boy's sense of propriety, towards the fireplace. He pulled the bell with a violence that said as plainly as the most arrogant words could have said, I am the master here. The servant was startled at such an unusually loud ring, and rushed into the room, thinking that something awful must have occurred, and breathlessly asked what was the matter. "The matter," repeated Scory, with a scornful laugh, "nothing. Go and tell the man to get my horse ready."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Scory," exclaimed Mr. Cameron, "you are not going to leave us! Stay, and have some dinner first. 'Tis nearly ready." Scory roughly negatived his request, at the same time, remarking that he might dine in that room, some day or other, under very different circumstances, and that he preferred waiting till then.</p>
               <p>"Do you see yon boy," cried the father, in a voice tremulous with emotion. "You say you respected and loved his mother. Is he not like her?"</p>
               <p>"Not at all," replied the ruffian. "He belongs to a different sex. I have noticed him. He is proud and ambitious. A <emph>he</emph> eagle, that will do less mischief, deprived of the golden wings of his proud ancestors."</p>
               <p>Mr. Cameron's proud heart swelled with indignation, his forehead widened, and his eyes glared with rage, as he said in a deep, solemn voice, "the curse of Ahab and Jezebel be upon thee and thine forever, for coveting the hereditary vineyard of this young Naboth. Leave this house, with a widowed parent's and an orphan's curse hanging over thine head."</p>
               <p>Scory left the room with a trembling step. He had entered it with a firm step, and a countenance<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5589-00000029"/> tenance full of assurance. He wished he had been less rigorous in his demands. The curse, ringing in his ears as he mounted his horse, he had half a mind to come down again. He thought the next day's papers would contain under the title "Accident;" "G. Scory, Esq., died in consequence of a fall from his horse. His body was dreadfully mangled. His skull was beaten to atoms, and his bowels literally gushed out, and, horrible to relate, several dogs were seen, with bloody mouths, upon the spot where he was found. This horrible death reminds us of the curse pronounced against Jezebel." He went almost all the way home with this awful obituary staring him in the face. That night he could not sleep. Mrs. Jezebel Scory, in whom, if her lord had one fiend, there were legions, having questioned him respecting the cause of his uneasiness, laughed outright at his credulity, superstition, and cowardism. She told him to be bold and decisive, and crush the serpent at once, and if he felt afraid, to leave the business to her. In a few days there was a great change at the old mansion. Strangers were walking in and out, with far more freedom than the possessors. One man, with a large red book in his hand, was taking an inventory of all within and without the house. Then a large sheet of paper was printed, containing a catalogue of everything that the last of the illustrious race of the Cameron's possessed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cameron made great efforts to keep the library that Archie received from his grandfather. Scory would not listen to him. Everything must be sold. The sale was to last several days. The people in the neighborhood would not attend. It was a shame to have a sale at the old mansion. That old Scory ought to be hooted out of the country. Nothing but mischief followed his transactions everywhere. He was not fit to live. Poor old Cameron and his lovely boy; what were they to do?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cameron had a little bird, a small canary, that she greatly loved, and had given orders to Archie to be particularly kind to it. She had no need to be so strict in her injunction<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5589-00000030"/> tion, for Archie loved the bird that was such a favorite of his dear mother, and would not part with it on any account. He took hold of Scory's arm, as that unfeeling wretch was taking down the cage, and begged, with tears in his eyes, that he might keep his dear mother's favorite; that it was among her last injunctions that he should be kind to poor Dick. Scory laughed at him, and said, "You shan't have it. Your mother ought to have thought of something better than birds, upon her dying bed." Archie fell down upon his knees before him, and begged again with an earnestness that one would think a heart of stone could not resist. But Scory's heart was flint, and did resist the tearful suppliant. He said, with a diabolical grin, "a proud Cameron bends the suppliant knee before me, does he? You shan't have it, boy; I want it for my own child."</p>
               <p>Archie dashed the tear from his eye—rose from his knees—stood before Scory—looked at him full in the face; till the unfeeling tyrant trembled before him. The young lion had been roused, and the vaunting jackass, though mailed with audacity, and shielded with gold, could not brave the scowlings of defiance that was hurled at him.</p>
               <p>"I have knelt to you," continued the excited and furious boy, "in the Hall of my ancestors, for the paltry gift of a bird, but which to me is sacred as the memory of her that bore me, and heaven knows how sacred and holy that is. You had the hardihood to refuse the gift, that you might have it, you say, for your own boy. Now, do you see yon swords, that hang rusty and useless upon the wall? Take one of them in your hand, and I will take the other, and with this boyish arm will dispute my claim to that bird, and this lordly Hall." Scory grew livid, and felt faint. The boy, in his indignation, called him coward, and spit in his face. He then, before the villain,—who durst not touch him,—deliberately took the bird out of the cage, kissed him fervently—wrung his neck—put it in his pocket—tore the cage to pieces—asked the coward and astonished Scory whether his son would have dared so much for a bird, or whether he had the courage to stake<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5589-00000031"/> his moneyed claim upon the old mansion on the strength of his arm, as opposed to that of a mere boy.</p>
               <p>Scory was afraid of him. He thought of his father's curse. The boy, too, was a strange being, and seemed to combine the ferocity of the tiger with the docility and loveliness of the lamb.</p>
               <p>Scory, in common with every bad man, was cowardly and superstitious. He felt peculiarly unhappy about these Camerons, and thought his personal safety of a very questionable character while in the same house as that fierce boy and his desperate father.</p>
               <p>Ere he left the house, Mr. Cameron's lawyer entered, having left London on a business of importance.</p>
               <p>Scory took a second thought, and upon the whole, deemed it more prudent to remain.</p>
               <p>The lawyer had a great many papers with him, requiring Mr. Cameron's signature. He looked, with evident curiosity, at Scory, and smiled significantly, as if something mysterious was behind the scene.</p>
               <p>Archie, too, the young jackanape, as Scory called him, walked somewhat proudly through the Old Hall as if they were not going to part just then, at any rate. Old Cameron said something in the old servant's ear, that made her drop the pail of milk she was carrying, and exclaimed with great rapture, "la, master!" Scory, who was watching her, scolded her for her negligence, while she, dear soul, letting the cat out of the bag, told him to hold his tongue, the old villain, and go about his business, that he had been there long enough, in all conscience.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cameron told her, with an arch smile, that puzzled the man of gold more and more, "to kill immediately, the <choice>
                     <sic>fatest</sic>
                     <corr>fattest</corr>
                  </choice> turkey in the yard, and get up a first-rate dinner by six o'clock. "By the way," he continued, "I think you had better get up a cold dinner for Scory and his men, first." The old servant enjoyed the joke, laughed outright, and said she would.</p>
               <p>Scory thought they all looked very queer. He was always Mr. Scory before. The idea of his dining with the men, too, he thought somewhat cool of old Cameron. But he was a villain<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5589-00000032"/> lain, and as might be expected, all his conjectures were villainous. He thought the pretended lawyer was nothing but an assassin, brought down on purpose to assist in doing away with him. He felt, at one time, shivering with cold, at another, in a dreadful heat, the perspiration oozing from every pore, and anon, he grew dizzy with a fainting sensation. At that awful moment of trepidation, young Archie came up to him,—carrying two loaded pistols in his hands—asked him how he felt, and whether he would have any objection to terminate the unpleasant business with one of those instruments, since he felt an aversion to a more tedious method of deciding the question by swords, presenting him with the case, saying with a smile, that he would give him the benefit of a choice of weapons.</p>
               <p>Old Cameron and the lawyer had placed themselves where, unseen, they might enjoy the rich treat of a harmless duel between the boy and the old usurer.</p>
               <p>Scory looked at the instruments with an unmeaning gaze, that might have been mistaken for idiocy, had not the depth of his crafty soul been too well known to the parties concerned.</p>
               <p>"Don't you know how to handle them?" cried Archie, taking them from his trembling hands, and proceeding with the greatest coolness to teach him the use of the weapons. "Well, now," he said, throwing his cap upon the ground, and tucking up his sleeves, as if going to stab rather than shoot his antagonist, "do you see this?" Scory did see it with horror, though he could not say so. "Pull it back this way," continued the boy, "then put your fore finger upon this small handle," taking aim at Scory's breast. The cowardly old fellow gave a horrible yell, and fell upon his knees before the boy, who, convulsed with laughter, had dropped down the pistol at his feet.</p>
               <p>The men ran from the house to see what was the matter, and Mr. Cameron and the lawyer came to the spot, and looked round with great astonishment.</p>
               <p>Scory told his men to take hold of the boy, that he was a murderer. "Whom did he murder?" cried the men. "Whom?" yelled Scory,<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5589-00000033"/> in a dreadful state of excitement, "me, to be sure. Don't you see the pistols?" The men losing all restraint over their feelings, roared out most lustily.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cameron and the lawyer, with as much gravity as they could command, examined the pistols. They were declared harmless, and then shown to the spectators. Everybody eyed the dead man again, and renewed their laughter.</p>
               <p>Scory cried, and declared that there was a conspiracy against him, and that they were all concerned in it. The lawyer, with eyes that danced with mirth, maintained there could be no conspiracy against a dead man, and that he was so upon his own showing, that he had asserted the fact before several creditable witnesses, and consequently could have no claim upon Mr. Cameron's estate. The old fox felt that he was in the presence of one whom he could not deceive. The auspicious moment was seized, and ere the revived, or rather resuscitated man, was aware, the quick-sighted lawyer had concluded a most advantageous arrangement rangement with him, by which, he was to turn his back that very evening—to give due notice that no sale was to take place at the old mansion—and to deliver up the deeds into Mr. Cameron's hands without delay. Scory was glad at heart to get rid of an awkward business, to the rapid execution of which, he had been hurried by the impetuosity of his <emph>worse</emph> half,—<choice>

               <p>The awkward affair of the duel had touched his vanity to the quick. He there, and then religiously vowed that should he ever cross that impudent boy's path, he would return, in a more practical way than the young jackanape could anticipate, the compliment of that unfortunate day.</p>
               <p>A law-suit had been carried on for some years between Mr. Cameron and a wealthy mining company, who had, from time to time, made considerable encroachments upon his estate. He had been peculiarly fortunate in the choice of his lawyer. He was a gentleman of great benevolence and unquestioned probity. When he learnt his client's embarrassment, he<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5589-00000034"/> lost no time in accepting an offer made by the company respecting a small tract of waste land which they wished to purchase off Mr. Cameron. They had also made several offers to terminate the law-suit, which their counsel had honesty enough to state, would certainly go against them. These were unlooked-for means of deliverance. The man of law, with a promptitude and sagacity that did great credit to his head and heart, managed things with such admirable skill, that he was enabled to save his client from the very jaws of ruin, and to restore to him his paternal land almost free and unencumbered.</p>

               <p>THE great and sudden change wrought in Mr. Cameron's worldly circumstances, produced a still greater change in his general character. He became proud and imperious, such as he had been prior to his marriage with Archie's mother. The boy, however, continued still the<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5589-00000035"/> same kind and good creature. So like his dear departed mother. He often wept as he thought of his conduct towards Scory, and how differently he acted from the way in which his dear mother would have acted under similar circumstances. Poor Dick was buried with great solemnity in the cave in the rock. His grave was often bedewed with tears of sincere regret for having, in an evil moment, deprived him of life.</p>
               <p>A dashing young fellow came down from Oxford, being strongly recommended as a private tutor to young Cameron.</p>
               <p>The boy did not like him. He was too proud and frivolous. Nor did the father greatly admire his carriage. So the great man of learning was courteously dismissed.</p>
               <p>The next candidate made a better hit. He was a grey-headed, portly old gentleman. He had served the neighboring parish, as a curate, for, at least, thirty years. His salary never exceeded, in the course of one year, not taking into account the fees which went to the rector's own pocket, the paltry sum of fifty pounds sterling. The living was valued at fifteen hundred a year, and held by a gentleman who had never seen it more than once in his life;—he being a pluralist, holding several other livings at the same time.</p>
               <p>Poor Edward Keyworth! his was a hard case. He had acquitted himself well at college, and carried away several prizes. He had, however, no friends but his talents. Had he no talents, he would have been far more likely to find preferment. Talents like mountains, are too high to be remarkably fruitful. The storms beat harder upon their heads than the low valleys that profit by them—from the former, they wash away the few green spots that adorn them, to swell the overflowing richness of the latter.</p>
               <p>He loved his pupil, and was greatly loved in return. Indeed, Archie could not tell whether he did not love him more than his father. He was sure that for years before they separated he thought him a better man than his father. For five years, pupil and teacher lived in the greatest harmony. During this period of uninterrupted<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5589-00000036"/> terrupted labor, the young man,—as we must now, I suppose, call Archie—made an extraordinary proficiency in his studies. He was a first rate classic and an excellent divine. The mathematics, metaphysics, logic, and rhetoric were not neglected. The pencil, poetry, and music were among his favorite recreations, and had been from childhood. These were sacred to him. His dear mother had taught him he first rudiments. She seemed, to his mind, as if by his side when engaged in these elegant pursuits.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Edward Keyworth, through Mr. Cameron's excellent lawyer, whom he occasionally met at the old mansion, obtained a small living, in the gift of the chancellor, where he spent the remainder of his days in comfort. Archibald Cameron was now a young man at large. He could go where he wished and do what he liked. His father was too proud of him to deny him anything that he might request. His was, indeed, a noble son, such as a doting father could not spoil.</p>
               <p>The delightful visits to the old cave in the rock, had seldom failed during his hardest studies. The harder his studies the more earnest he prayed. His mother had trained him early to seek, God's blessing and assistance in the discharge of his daily duties. Young as he was, he economised his time well. And this may partly account for his great success in his studies. His memory, too, was <choice>
                     <sic>prodigeous</sic>
                     <corr>prodigious</corr>
                  </choice>. He seldom forgot what he once saw, heard, or read. Though a tall, well-looking young man, he was rather boyish in appearance. He had neither beard nor whiskers. His address, however, could not be mistaken for that of a gentleman of high birth and liberal education.</p>
               <p>He was strongly advised by an old friend of his mother, to go to college for a year or two in order to become more acquainted with the nature of the Christian ministry, and to have an opportunity to exercise his talents in sermonizing and preaching. When the college had been fixed upon, and preparation for his departure made, he felt half reluctant to leave the old mansion over which the shade of his dear<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5589-00000037"/> mother seemed still to preside. The father too, betrayed feelings of which his son had erroneously thought him incapable.</p>
               <p>He prevailed upon his father to let him walk alone over the hill, while he went round in the carriage to meet him on the other side. The fond parent could never deny him anything, least of all now, as they were going to separate. The lovely youth crept into the cave in the rock, which was now almost too small for him, and there prayed long and fervently that he should not be left unto himself—that his heart might be as a well-watered garden—that his God would continue to be the guide of his youth, and that he should become such a minister as his dear mother prayed he might. Dick was not forgotten. His little grave was bedewed with tears. He walked slowly up the hill, turning frequently to have another look at the old mansion—the sweet home of his young and happiest days. He looked up the mountain that towered above him, and saw the dear spot where he used to sit for hours, musing beside the cool spring, whose bubbling groans caused the big crystal tears to roll down over his rugged brow, deepening the many furrows it had already made. He seems to hang over and gaze with unceasing fondness on the sweet vales by which he is surrounded, and which he constantly keeps as well-watered gardens, by the tears of affection, the benignant smiles with which he regards them, sheltering them from the stormy wind and tempest, standing all day bare-headed, between them and the scorching heat—tempering the deceitful ray by attracting around him the light zephyrs and cooling breezes who so dote upon the old gentleman that they never cease to hang with ecstacy upon his lips, and play with his venerable locks, except, now and then, indeed, when they bashfully retire before the terrific frown of their boisterous and envious grandmother, the tempest, who occasionally takes the dear old man by storm—and especially in cold winter nights—puffs and roars out with immoderate laughter as she favors him with beautifully white, clean sheets, and tucks him up snugly for the night.</p>
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5589-00000038"/>
               <p>The lovely river in which he first bathed his boyish limbs, and with which so many delightful associations, stands connected in his mind, ripples gently over its pebbles, and as he thinks, mournfully murmurs, "and wilt thou leave me?"</p>
               <p>What makes him start? He has just caught a sight of the object that he wished to bid farewell to alone, lest he should betray his secret. It is the place, where he rescued the little girl from the water. He thinks that nature, like, himself, is fonder of that spot than any other. It certainly looks greener, as if greater care had been taken of it. There is a very, very green spot in his soul too—a spot cultivated with greater assiduity and pleasure than any other. His father is impatiently waiting for him and occasionally shouts and beckons him on.</p>
               <p>He hears him not. His thoughts are far away. He know not where. But he fancies he sees the half-drowned child verging upon womanhood, and thinking of her deliverer. It is a moment, of sweet agony. His young heart trembles between hope and fear. The big tear stands in his eye. He cannot distinctly see. But the eye of his mind seems marvellously clear and strong. It sees things he had rather not see, and now and then catches a glimpse of objects of ineffable sweetness. He feels intensely. His heart swells to his throat, and a sense of suffocation comes over him.</p>
               <p>His father's' voice suddenly,—and may he be forgiven,—he thinks harshly, breaks upon his ear. It is a timely relief though. It helps him to overcome his feelings.</p>
               <p>The poor father is not sorry to find him gloomy and low-spirited on that day. It is a balm to his wounded spirit to think his child so dutiful. That journey greatly endears them to each other.</p>
               <p>The father, though, half-fearing the result, reminded the son of several weak points in his character, which he had never discovered in himself, and urged him to fortify and guard them well. The youth felt that his kind father was not the man he had taken him to be. The parent watched with fearful anxiety<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5589-00000039"/> the issue. Archibald took his hand, kissed it and bathed it with grateful tears, leaned upon his shoulder as upon a tower of strength—a counsellor incomparably wiser than himself. It was a lovely sight, such as God loves to witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cameron left the college with no very favorable impression. He knew his son, young as he was, to be a far better classic than any of his tutors. In divinity he might learn something. Ere he got home, he half-regretted leaving him there.</p>
               <p>The tutors betrayed some anxiety respecting the young man's comforts that they never did with regard to any other new comer.</p>
               <p>The students, too, betrayed great curiosity. They never had a real gentleman of birth and education among them before. They marveled whatever could be his motive for entering the ministry among the poor dissenters, when he might so easily get a living in the Established Church—one, too, that no body could take from him.</p>
               <p>Young Cameron was offered a well-furnished room at the tutor's house. He, however, declined, and said he should prefer being treated in every respect like the other students. He is introduced to his college chum, a man nearly old enough to be his father. He is told by the tutor, that, though he may not find his chum a man of refined manners, that he will find him a man possessed of many excellent points, and a strong practical common sense. Young Cameron wondered what his tutor meant, whether he meant to apologise for the uncouthness of the young man, or to eulogise his talents.</p>
               <p>He, however, soon felt at home with him, and though brought up so differently, they agreed remarkably well. The majority of the students were men in every sense of the word. Their characters had been well scrutinized prior to their admission to the institution. They were men, too, whose piety and talents were supposed to be unquestionable. They were called to the work of the ministry because they had given evidence of their having been with Jesus. They had evinced the sincerity of their<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5589-00000040"/> profession by the renunciation of whatever hopes they had of worldly preferments. The sweet anticipation of spending their lives among scenes made holy by the recollections of childhood—sacred by the purity of early affection—doubly dear by being the last resting place of their ancestors, could no longer be theirs. The choice of habitation they left with him who had graciously given them a title to an eternal habitation in the heavens. Though poor by choice, they were rich by adoption. They claimed a higher birth and an ampler inheritance than the kings of the earth, an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that cannot fade away;—their counsellors were patriarchs, seers, prophets, apostles, evangelists,—all men inspired by infinite wisdom;—their faithful and illustrious guards,—ministering spirits that excel in strength;—their exploits were achieved by weapons that are not carnal, but mighty through God—their records were on high,—their names indelibly written with blood in the Lamb's Book of Life—their deeds in the archives of eternity. It was not a pain but a pleasure for men conscious of being called to occupy such a dignified position, and to press forward towards such splendid destinies, to deny themselves a momentary delight with an eternal enjoyment in view—to crucify the flesh while it hastened the emancipation of the spirit—to embrace poverty as the old fellow-pilgrim of their dear Redeemer, who discoursed most eloquently of the riches to which his tottering steps were leading—to smile at the scorn of the world, the crushing of whose head was the last step to the dignity of an eternal throne. Such glorious ideas lightened their arduous toils. While discharging with the greatest scrupulosity the duties of the present, they were also, by dint of extraordinary labor, rescuing from the unpromised past, spoils as noble and as rich as the most distinguished course of early training could produce. The puritanical zeal of Cromwell enabled him, though a novice at forty in military tactics, to surpass in skill and courage, those trained from earliest childhood to the profession. The religious enthusiasm and undaunted<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5589-00000041"/> daunted courage of these old students made them surpass many of those whose whole lives have been devoted to the acquisition of sacred literature.</p>
               <p>The professors were of the same character. The president was a man verging upon sixty, though he looked much older. He had been a very hard student all his life, and was, about the time Archibald entered, nearly blind. It was with the greatest difficulty that he could read his lectures. His very presence, however, seemed to have a most friendly influence upon those around him. He was loved and venerated by all; and, perhaps, by none more than young Cameron.</p>
               <p>The classical tutor was more of an enthusiast, and less austere in his manners. He had no great taste for mathematics; neither was he a first rate linguist. Still, he was a man of rare abilities, and peculiarly adapted for the important position he held. He had the knack of communicating what he knew in the simplest and most effective manner. The rapid, yet steady progress of his pupils, was the astonishment tonishment of all. How he could make his pupils acquire such a prodigious amount of knowledge in such a short period, none could divine. That he did so was universally admitted. A man taken from the plough, and left under his care for two years, more than once, gained the highest honors of the English universities. Another unaccountable feature in his mode of teaching was that the health of his pupils was never known to fail. On the contrary, it was a notorious fact, that it generally improved. However clownish a student might be on his entering the institution, in a few months, he was quite a different man. Self respect,—intense earnestness in the acquisition of knowledge—a deep sense of the exalted character of their new position—a thorough consecration to the discharge of the duties arising out of the peculiar circumstances in which they were placed,—he seemed at once to infuse into their minds. The rapid growth of their noble virtues, as exhibited in the development of their ministerial characters<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5589-00000042"/> ters made them men of whom the world was not worthy.</p>
               <p>It was often remarked that there were men altogether different from those produced by any other college. They were generally known, by the complimentary appellation of "the Christian gentlemen." With such men to associate what a privilege? It was indeed a privilege, but one that young Cameron did not long enjoy.</p>
               <p>The committee had, by great exertion, succeeded in getting funds enough to build a new and a more commodious college, in a more central and respectable town. This college was nearly ready. The opening day was fixed upon. The old professors, who, by their tact, industry, and example, had wrought such a marvellous change in the character of dissent, were requested to resign prior to the removal of the students to the new college. Poor fellows! They thought it somewhat hard that they should be called upon to tender their resignation. There was no alternative. They knew the decision of the committee, and were partly prepared for the event. But when they saw those that clung to them like children to their parents, weep under the conviction of the irreparable loss they were about to sustain, they were overwhelmed with grief and could hardly refrain from shedding tears.</p>
               <p>The time of most of the students was nearly completed. They had their choice whether to enter the new institute or not. To a man they determined to accept the kind offer of the committee, and to leave at once.</p>
               <p>The committee received the announcement of their decision with evident satisfaction. They were sagacious enough to see that new professors stood but a poor chance of influencing the minds of men so attached to the old tutors.</p>
               <p>The few students that remained were men admitted with a view of entering the new institution. Among these was young Cameron. He had begun to preach for sometime before the breaking up of the old establishment. He had also received an invitation to the pastorate of a large church in one of the neighboring<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5589-00000043"/> towns. These were advantages greatly in his favor with the new professors. They regarded him as a young man of great promise. His classic style, exquisite taste, mellifluous musical voice, and manly elocution, made him an object of envy to his fellow students. Still his popularity was on the increase. It was universally admitted by all that heard him that he possessed talents of the first order. His personal appearance, too, was greatly in his favor. Calumny, with her thousand eyes, could find no flaw in his conduct. He was unblemished—in every respect meet for the altar at which he served.</p>
               <p>The largest and most respectable churches in the country vied with each other for his service.</p>
               <p>How often he wished that his dear mother was alive, to witness his usefulness and to share his gratitude and joy. It was delightful to witness his humility in the midst of so many incentives to pride. The higher he rose in men's estimation, the lower he prostrated himself before the God that gave him such favor in their sight.</p>
               <p>The more he saw of the internal working of some of the churches with which he had to do, the more he felt perplexed as to the propriety of his accepting an ordination as a Dissenting minister. He mentioned his doubts to the president, and something very much like a quarrel ensued. Cameron suddenly left college and went home to his father. The event caused a great deal of conjecture, and most scandalous accounts of the misunderstanding between him and his tutor.</p>

               <p>ARCHIBALD CAMERON never fully disclosed what occurred during his interview with the new President. That he left the college with the full determination to leave Dissent, too, was pretty certain, from the hostility cherished towards him by the tutors. His principal reason for not accepting any of the invitations with which he was so abundantly favored, seemed by no means of a recent date.</p>
               <p>He had observed with pain the turn that things were taking at the new college, and the utter incapacity of the President for the important position he occupied.</p>
               <p>Men were admitted, it is to be feared, with but few, if any, qualifications, for the important office to which they aspired.</p>
               <p>The tenure of the most useful minister's position was anything but certain. In a week, a <choice>
                     <sic>quarelsome</sic>
                     <corr>quarrelsome</corr>
                  </choice> Lord Deacon might instigate the whole church against the pastor, and unceremoniously turn him upon the world, to starve, if he can find no other place. Surely such things ought not so to be. Both these points are strikingly illustrated in the following passages in the life of Cameron's old chum. The manner in which young men are generally introduced to the work of the ministry, he thought very injudicious. The young man must, for some time, have exercised his talents as a preacher, previous to his application for admittance to college. Having spent a certain period, to satisfy the members of the church that he is likely to make an able minister of the New Testament, an application is made to the committee of the college on his behalf. Now,<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5589-00000045"/> who are those that sit thus as judges of the young man's talents? Have they the requisite qualifications to constitute efficient judges in such a case? What experience have they themselves had in preaching? At the feet of what Gamaliel have they sat and learned? What monuments of learning to their illustrious selves stand conspicuous to the gaze of the ignorant, and the admiration of the wise? To what severe discipline have they themselves been subjected, in order to sympathize with others under similar circumstances? To what proof have their integrity been put so as secure their unbiassed opinion, and to guarantee the honesty of their decision on such a momentous question? Alas! those who generally sit as judges on the qualifications of the young candidate, and the likelihood of his succeeding as a Dissenting teacher, are men, for the most part, much more ignorant than himself, having no pretensions whatever to the qualifications requisite for such an office. Nor can they be considered as always acting from a pure motive. The young candidate may have been more cunning ning than his judges, and may through flattery have secured the good opinion of the great lion of the church, whose judgment is always right, and with whose sweet and powerful voice the minister always chimes, and from which the rest of the members dare not dissent. His having given it as his unprejudiced opinion that the young man possessed rare talents, and would at some future day be an ornament to Dissent, and a glory to their church, it would have been a high treason against common sense to think of him otherwise than the most distinguished of the distinguished men of the age. This great man also was well known to the President of the College, and a great favorite of his, having recently had the honor of sending his carriage to fetch the great divine to preach their charity sermon, and whom he entertained like a prince at his house, and with whom he was seen on Monday morning, walking arm-in-arm through the mill, and to whom he was heard observing in a pious strain, that he likewise was a manufacturer; the only difference being, that the one manufactured<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5589-00000046"/> cotton, and the other divines. It was, moreover, roundly asserted by some, and broadly hinted at by more, that the great man of the mill had given to the great man of the college five shillings out of his own pocket, in addition to the fifteen shillings collection, in order to satisfy his mind, and gain his good opinion. This was regarded by all as a stroke of policy, worthy, every whit of it, of the great man of the mill, and sure to take effect on the great man of the college. And sure enough, public opinion was right, for the great man of the college had made it a rule never to oppose <emph>the public mind in relation to any subject that had respect to himself</emph>. At length, the great man of the mill got the young candidate—if such a man, thirty years of age, can be so called—through the influence of the great man of the college, admitted as a divinity student, under the peculiar patronage of the great man of the college himself. It is, moreover, a notorious fact, that a collection was made by the members of the church, to the liberal amount of thirty-seven shillings, in order to carry him through his collegiate course respectably. The great man of the mill likewise came out most nobly, and to his honor, be it said, contributed the handsome sum of three shillings, in order to make the thirty-seven of the church into two pounds. With this ample means, and the still ampler favor of the great man of the college, the young student was considered "well to do," both as it respects the world and the church.</p>
               <p>Under these auspicious circumstances, the young man is looked upon as having made a most fortunate hit. His old companions in the mill conscientiously hate him, but dare not show their hatred lest they should incur the displeasure of his patron, the great man of the mill. The Church expect much from him, and some of the poorer members, that could only give him sixpence when he left them, wondered whether he would be too proud to speak to them on his return from college.</p>
               <p>In the meanwhile, he is hard at work at college, and the rumor has already gone abroad, that he is not likely to remain at college long,<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5589-00000047"/> in consequence of his having already learnt all that can be learned there. When this reaches the ear of the great man of the mill, he smiles complacently and nods assent. The great man of the mill is now spoken of as having confirmed the truth of the report. The examination comes that finishes the young man's period of probation. He is examined in Latin, in Cornelius Nepos, or perhaps Cæsar. In Greek, in Valpy's <title>Delectus</title>. He is asked what gender is the word <foreign xml:lang="GRC">logos</foreign>, and to go through the present tense of the verb <foreign xml:lang="GRC">tupto</foreign>. He makes only one mistake, and is told that he has given universal satisfaction, and is fully admitted as a student to the college. Hereupon, the great man of the college writes a long and affectionate letter to the great man of the mill, detailing all the little attentions he had shown to the promising object of his solicitude, and promising to continue to befriend him for his (the great man of the mill's) sake, and concluding by observing, that the doctor had recommended his lady to go a little from home, accompanied by himself and children, during the vacation, and as he and his worthy partner had been the first to give him an invitation for the present recess, he and his family would try to be with them as soon as possible. The reading of this letter threw the great man of the mill and his worthy partner into consternation, till they bethought themselves of the honor that they would have in the sight of all the <choice>
                     <sic>congreation</sic>
                     <corr>congregation</corr>
                  </choice> in consequence of a visit from such distinguished guests. As soon as the young man arrived at home, he was asked to preach. No denial would be taken; they had got him to college to learn to preach, and they wanted to know what progress he had made. Here a new trial awaited him. His whole views and feelings had undergone a radical change since he had left them. They were the same, and expected him so likewise, though they had sent him away to be changed, re-moulded, and improved. Were they, therefore, disappointed? Yes, and profoundly so, too. They thought him much worse than he was before he went to college. Thus they murmured, and to insult added reproof. In vain did the great man of the mill<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5589-00000048"/> tell them that the great man of the college said he was greatly improved, and that having conquered the classics, he would soon turn his mind more to preaching.</p>
               <p>The young man, driven to desperation by these unkind remarks, began to think what he was to do. The thought flashed across his mind that all was not yet lost, and that he might again repossess the good opinion of his friends. He sat down and began to compose a sermon for the following Sunday, putting nothing on paper but what he knew would please them. Having been told that he had given an offence the preceding Sunday for not mentioning the deacons of the church in his prayer, he determined now to be more cautious, and sat down to indite a prayer suitable in every respect to the taste and varied circumstances of the church and congregation, taking particular care to pray with unusual warmth and fervor for the deacons, that they might still be prompted to befriend the young and hopeful members of the invisible body of Christ, and be long spared as the ornaments of their office, and as patterns to others of other churches, in labor, in watching, in deeds of charity, and of love. Both sermon and prayer being committed to memory, he betook himself to visiting, saw every individual he expected to be at chapel the following Sunday, told them all about college, thanked them for their good wishes, said that they were never absent from his thoughts, and that the more substantial proof which they had given him when he was leaving them, was still fresh on the tablets of his heart, and that that must cease to beat ere he could forget them. He also took care to tell them under what disadvantageous circumstances he labored the preceding Sunday, and that it was a great cruelty in them to make him preach, &amp;c. His attentions were very particular to the younger members of the church and congregation, especially the weaker sex. This policy secured the end he had in view. Even before Sunday came, he had become quite the hero of the small-talk of the neighborhood. But when that auspicious morning dawned, his heart beat violently in<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5589-00000049"/> his ministerial bosom, and scarcely was he himself on his way to the chapel. The place, however, was crowded to excess, and his illustrious self, the observed of all observers. The prayer and the sermon came off wonderfully well. Everybody felt <choice>
                     <sic>satified</sic>
                     <corr>satisfied</corr>
                  </choice> with the performance, and himself spoke most complacently of the pleasure he felt while engaged in the solemnities of the sanctuary. This made him ambitious to become all things to all men, in order that he might enjoy there favor.</p>
               <p>During the rest of the recess he was busily engaged in supplying the pulpits of absent ministers, and in one or two instances, vacant churches. The Lords Deacons of one of these churches were wonderfully taken with him. The ease with which he delivered his first sermon among them, made them regard him as a first-rate man. They asked him whether he had long to remain at college, and when he told them how long, they all exclaimed:—"What a pity, now! You really seem as if you had been made for us. Everybody admires your talents, and would give anything to obtain your valuable services as a pastor." Puffed up by an overawing conceit of his own abilities, he returns to college, and is immediately made to know his level. How differently college appears to him now from what it did at first! The work assigned to him by the Professors is dry and irksome. The approaching Sabbath is the most pleasing object he can think of, and the whole week is devoted to preparation for it.</p>
               <p>Saturday arrives, and he is on the tiptoe of expectation till the preaching-list comes out. Then, with a quiet step, he hastens to his study and is heard repeating aloud his discourse in order to make himself master of it for the coming day. And where is the reviewing of the class-work of the week? Alas! there is neither work nor review—the sermon is the <emph>be</emph> all and the <emph>end</emph> all. The following two or three years, should he complete his time at College, is the weekly repetition of the same. How in the name of common sense, can there be a good foundation laid for future usefulness?</p>
               <p>But this is not all the mischief resulting from such a system. The whole ministry groaneth<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5589-00000050"/> and travaileth together in pain on account of it. Should a minister's health fail, a supply from college is immediately sought. The young man goes there well prepared, and fully determined to do his utmost on the occasion. The poor invalid minister has been preaching there perhaps for the last twenty years, four times a week; three times on Sunday, and a week night lecture, and, most probably, a Monday evening prayer-meeting, and an address. The young student had never preached there before; but he was known to have preached the same discourses a month ago, in a neighboring town, and was greatly admired. Could they do less? Certainly not. There was a novelty and freshness about him quite enchanting, not at all like poor Mr. ——. Then cones the young ladies' remarks on his youth, beauty, manliness, eloquence, and sweetness of manners. Could they but secure such a man for a minister. Then he is asked, with a great deal of apparent solicitude, what time has he to remain at college. The answer is immediately given, four months. The Lord Deacon gives him his sweetest and most patronizing smile, and adds, "Are you engaged to any church?" and hopes to be excused for being so inquisitive; "but you see, Mr. ——, these are matters of great solicitude to us Deacons, and I can assure you, Mr. ——, between ourselves, that I often spend sleepless nights on account of the vast responsibility under which the great Head of the Church has been pleased to place me. The relation that I sustain to his cause in this awful world, is one of great moment, I can assure you, sir. But I need not tell you, my dear sir, that you—like my unworthy self—have been peculiarly favored by the great Head of the Church in this respect. If we do not feel, my dear sir, for the cause of our common Lord and Master, who will? But, I forgot to wait for your reply. But, indeed, my dear sir, I am so wrapt up in these holy things—nay, hallowed mysteries as I may, and often do, call them—that I almost forget everything else. But, dear me! I now wait for your reply, my dear sir,—are you engaged to any particular church?"</p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5589-00000051"/>
               <p>"Why," replied Mr. Student, somewhat perplexed by so so direct a question, "not exactly; but you know these are delicate matters, Mr. ——, relating so near to one's self, you know."</p>
               <p>"Oh! certainly, certainly," adds my old Lord Deacon; "but you know, my dear sir, that it is yourself, personally, that is an object of such interest to us, the deacons, the church, and the congregation generally. All here are positively enchanted with your preaching. Mr. So-and so, poor fellow, he is so weak, my dear sir, that we cannot hope to have him much longer; nor, indeed, can he expect that we can possibly bear with his poor sermons, after having heard such powerful discourses from yourself to-day. He is old, you see, my dear sir, and has preached himself out completely. We want a young man, you see, there are so many young people springing up in the church and congregation, most of them, indeed, baptized by him, and brought up under his poor ministry; and how, therefore, my dear sir, can they either respect or love him?</p>
               <p>"Now, you see, my dear sir, that it is an active young man that we want. For instance, here is my own family growing up, and my dear Emma, my eldest daughter, whom you saw to-day, positively declared to me after she heard you preach in the morning, that she would not go to church henceforth, unless I should get an active young minister here. The fact is, if our present poor minister had not had the good fortune to marry the daughter of the old deacon in my place, at the time, or rather, in whose place I am at present, he would have long since been cast away. But it is wonderful what a family connection, in a place like this, can do. Do you take me, dear sir? Do you not see what a perplexing position I occupy in this place, between the living and the dead, as it were, the church and the congregation? What would you advise me to do, my dear sir? Oh, it is an awfully solemn thing to be the deacon of a large and respectable church like this! I would rather, my dear sir, be the veriest worm that crawls between earth and heaven, than to be what I am.<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5589-00000052"/> The only consolation is, that one is doing the will of Him that sitteth upon the heavens, and before whom we are all but as grasshoppers by nature: some of us, indeed, made something more by grace, as you and I too well know, my dear sir."</p>
               <p>"Well," said the poor student, after another imploring look from my Lord Deacon, "I hardly know what to say on the subject; the thing, as you just said, having some relation to myself."</p>
               <p>"Now, my dear sir, that is just the light in which I would have you view the subject. Think, my dear sir, that you are our future minister; and in order to make room for you, we must devise some means or other to get rid of this sickly old fellow, forthwith."</p>
               <p>Having spent Monday in this very profitable work with the old Lord Deacon, the young man, on Tuesday morning, betook himself back to college, taking particular care not to be there till the lectures were over. The coast being clear, he enters his study. It looks cold and cheerless, and he goes to the next. There he meets a smoking party, most of whom have just made their appearance, like himself, taking good care to avoid the great lion that was in the way. Salutations,—consisting chiefly in pulling him by the nose and ears, and calling him "old brick," with several other friendly appellations,—being over, he is loudly called upon to relate the adventures of the preceding Sunday. He solemnly declares that he cannot utter a word unless he would get a whiff or two from one of his companion's clay-pipes. His pleasing work was at once to select, for every mouth had relinquished its claim for him. Having satisfied himself, and soothed his feelings to the right pitch, he begins to tell his companions, who are all expectants like himself, that he has something of importance to communicate to them, provided that no junior was within hearing. Being satisfied on this point again, he proceeds by briefly stating his travelling exploits of Saturday—then the splendid chapel he preached in—the crowded congregation he had—the great number of rich young ladies, and wealthy widows, that belong<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5589-00000053"/> to the church—the fine place that it would be for a young minister—the delicate health of this old minister—and, to complete the climax, that his days were numbered; that he was forthwith to be turned off. This last announcement met with thundering applause, and, "Well done, old brick, you always bring us something good. Three cheers for the old Lord Deacon, and may he be successful in his work."</p>
               <p>That very week, all these young men were scattered far and wide throughout the country each of them gave out everywhere that such and such a church was dissatisfied with their minister, and that great complaints have been for some time made of him, on many accounts. These indefinite reports gained accession to their numbers every day. Things were invented and promulgated in secret, that would have reflected credit on the ingenuity of the Old Serpent himself. The wind thus raised, was not long in becoming a terrible whirlwind. As friends are generally remarkably faithful when any unwelcome intelligence is abroad, they spoke, wrote, and tormented the poor invalid valid almost to distraction, Every day brought some new evil report of a more serious nature than the last. His enemies were cruel tormentors, and his friends, the very few friends he had left, were miserable comforters.</p>
               <p>While things wore an unfavorable aspect abroad, things were much worse at home. The old Lord Deacon was most indefatigable in his endeavors to prejudice the church against their old minister. On the Tuesday that the young man left his house, he convened in the evening a meeting of the poor members of the church, gave them tea, and asked them to stay to supper. Miss Deacon played on the piano, and sang the very hymn and tune sung on Sunday evening, after the sermon—all that could sing, joining her.</p>
               <p>"How do you like it, papa?" said Miss Deacon to her lordly father.</p>
               <p>"Beautifully!" answered my Lord Deacon. "It so reminds one of the beautiful, and solemn, and eloquent sermon of that dear young man, whom we had the privilege of hearing last Sunday evening. I wonder when we shall have such<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5589-00000054"/> a discourse again! Excellent young man! too good for this bad and wicked world: blessed the church that may have such a pastor."</p>
               <p>Everybody was silent, feeling that no more could be said on the subject.</p>
               <p>"I was thinking to-day," continued my lord, "that should the great Head of the church, in His inscrutable purposes, see fit to remove our venerable, amiable, and dear pastor from us, that such a young man as we heard last Sunday, would exactly suit us. It is also said that the young man is about completing his collegiate course, and that a great many churches are almost fighting for him. As the acting deacon of the church, it is to be expected that I should always have my wits about me in a crisis like the present, when our venerable, and dear old pastor seems quite worn out, body and soul, in his Master's service. Poor old man, he is like a lamp—if I may be permitted to speak figuratively—quite burnt out—no oil left. Lest I should be misunderstood, I do not mean oil in its general acceptation, but oil, figuratively speaking, as I have said before. Now, my friends, to bring this within your comprehensions, the figure I have felicitously selected argues, if I may so speak, two things: first, that if our venerable and dear old pastor should soon die, we must have another—indeed, this first proposition is almost, I may say, self-evident to any one; the second, however, is not so. In order then, to convey my ideas to you, I shall speak figuratively again—Jesus Christ always did so. Suppose, for argument's sake, that Providence should permit our old pastor to remain a few years longer on this <choice>
                     <sic>terrestial</sic>
                     <corr>terrestrial</corr>
                  </choice> ball, why then, we should be compelled, reluctant though we be, to reduce his salary, in order to support another working minister, and allow the old one to remain, as it were, to use another figure, a sleeping partner in the concern! At any rate, it is my firm conviction, that we are called upon, as members of the Church of the living God, to see that His cause have fair play among us; that this portion of God's vineyard should be well watched; and, to recur to my former figure, that when one lamp goes out, we are bound to procure another, lest we should<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5589-00000055"/> be left in thick darkness—darkness, I might say, that might be felt."</p>
               <p>Having concluded this brilliant harangue, my Lord Deacon took the Bible, read a chapter, expounded it in his own original way, engaged in prayer, in which he fervently asked God, if it was consistent with His gracious will, speedily to restore to his usual health and strength, their venerable, an dear old pastor, and that his valuable life might be long spared, to the comfort of the church, and the prosperity of true religion.</p>
               <p>Some inquisitive, ungodly men, that doubt everything wondered much on their way homeward, what could have been the design of the old boy in treating them so generously. That he had some motive in doing so, they all agreed, and some desperate characters, especially one Mr. Restless, hazarded two or three bold conjectures, and would have given utterance to a fourth, had he not been silenced by the women, to whom my Lord Deacon had that day sent some tea and sugar. They protested that he was a good-natured, kind-hearted old man, always thinking of the good of the church, and the comfort of their poor old minister, under his great difficulties and trials.</p>
               <p>A few days after, my Lord Deacon gave a dinner-party to the more respectable part of the church, and whom, he thought, would go the whole animal with him. This meeting differs from the former, simply on account of its being more select, and things broached more cautiously, but at length brought to the same desirable issue. The same nefarious practices were repeated the following evening. All these proceedings were regularly reported to the absent minister. His heart was ready to break. He knew his man. The thought of the craft and cunning of my Lord Deacon nearly killed him. He wept and prayed, and advised with his wife, the only friend that he could trust, or open his troubled mind to.</p>
               <p>Under these circumstances, he was determined, while he was able, to write a long and affectionate letter to my Lord Deacon, to be read, if he thought proper, to the church. Now, here is an old and useful minister, having<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5589-00000056"/> ing collected a church out of the world, got a fine chapel built, collected money enough to pay for it, and yet dares not, in his old age, on the verge of the grave, address his own church without my Lord Deacon's permission; nay, has not the courage even to ask his permission—he can only, poor old patriarch, throw out a hint relative to his wishes on the subject.</p>
               <p>My Lord Deacon read his feeling and affectionate letter twice over, and then laughed heartily at the simplicity of "the old fool," as he called him, thinking that he was soft enough to read such a pathetic letter to the church. "No," he said to himself, "but I will make a very different use of it." After the morning service on the following Sunday, he gave out that there should be a church-meeting after the evening service, in the vestry-room, and that all the members of the church were particularly requested to attend, that they might learn the nature of a communication he had just received from their venerable and dear old pastor.</p>
               <p>The church-meeting was a full one, scarcely a member of the church absent; and all breathlessly awaiting the result.</p>
               <p>My Lord Deacon, having put on his spectacles and cleared his throat, began to comment on the nature of the communication which he had just had the happiness to receive from their venerable and dear pastor. "It is with pain," he continued, "that I am compelled to keep the letter itself from any eye but my own. You are, I am sure, my dear friends, well aware, of the intimate terms on which myself and our venerable and dear pastor have lived since we became related to each other in the near and important bond of union mysteriously existing between a pastor and a deacon. It is a source of great consolation to me as an individual, occupying, as I do, an office of no unimportant character, among you in the present mysterious crisis in the history of our church. Methinks, my dear brethren in Christ and in church fellowship in this place, that the angels of God are looking down upon us, and watching our proceedings with interest at the present moment, and that the<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5589-00000057"/> very stars in their courses are ready to fight for us, if required —"</p>
               <p>Here Mr. Restless interrupted the proceedings, by begging leave to ask my Lord Deacon what had all that to do with their poor old pastor's letter?</p>
               <p>Though choking with passion, my Lord Deacon thanked him, he said, cordially, for reminding him of his duty. He then briefly stated that their pastor's health was quite despaired of, on his own showing; and that he was, as usual, complaining of the poverty of his circumstances, and the additional expense of medical advice and attendance, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"I think I have now stated as much as I am warranted to disclose, of the nature of the communication received. Now, my dear brethren, what are we to do? How are we to act in the present important crisis of our history as a church? I can assure you, my dear brethren, that the care and anxiety attending the important office I occupy among you, quite overwhelms me; and I often inwardly, and as it were, involuntarily, exclaim, 'Who is sufficient cient for these things?' But I am occupying your valuable time, my dear brethren. Is there anything that any of you feel anxious to say on the subject?"</p>
               <p>Before, however, any of them could breathe, he was as loquacious as ever, proposing that a small collection should be made for their poor old pastor—but that really such things were very unpleasant; and, as it regarded himself, he never liked to be always putting his hand into their pockets.</p>
               <p>"But," continued his lordship, "all men are not similarly <emph>constructed</emph>, as it regards the delicacy of their minds. I have not, however, the least objection to contribute my mite, this once again, to bring him out of his difficulties. The repetition of these things are very unpleasant to one's feelings, you know, my dear brethren,—are they not? I appeal to your own consciences on the subject. It becomes us, also, in the present crisis of our history, to weigh well in our own minds what we had better do with respect to the future, as our old pastor can no longer be of any value to us—his recovery<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5589-00000058"/> covery being despaired of. Under these very painful circumstances, do you not, dear brethren, think it advisable to look out for a new minister to fill his place—and one of first-rate abilities, that can convert the congregation and build up the Church of the Living God in this place? As the elected Deacon of this portion of our dear Saviour's vineyard, this all-important subject has occupied much of my prayerful consideration. And after a long and most painful exercise of my mental faculties and inward soul, I have been induced to believe, on many considerations, that it is our painful duty to select a new one, more competent, and better qualified in every respect, to take the oversight of us in our common and blessed Lord Christ. To that end, if you wish, I shall at once communicate the result of our serious and prayerful consideration of his case as it stands at present."</p>
               <p>"As it grows late, I think we had better adjourn the meeting till Friday evening next, when I hope to be able to lay before you the nature of my communication with our poor old pastor. In the mean time, I would have you all to be earnest in prayer on my behalf, that I may have wisdom suitable to the position—the very important position—that the Lord, the Great Head of the Church, has been pleased to put me into, in relation to this church and congregation, and that I may be directed to a suitable person, a pastor after God's own heart, to go in and out before us; and above all, my dear brethren, that I may be enabled to do all with a single eye to our dear Master's glory."</p>
               <p>The letter received by the poor invalid from my Lord Deacon, in answer to his long and affectionate epistle, was of such a character, and written in such a language, that it threw him into a fever, which terminated fatally. The news of his death filled my Lord Deacon with joy. He at once sat down, and wrote a long and affectionate letter to the college, informing the young man that every obstacle had been removed out of his way; that the old drone was gone at last; and that the finger of God was clearly seen in the whole proceedings.</p>
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5589-00000059"/>
               <p>The young man was in raptures, and at once promised to supply for them the following Sunday. His discourses on that day were better prepared than usual. My Lord Deacon met him with a horse and gig on Saturday afternoon, and told him everything about the church and congregation, and particularly put him on his guard against uttering anything tending to favor Armenianism, lest their plan should thereby be frustrated. The young man thanked his lordship for the hint, and promised to bear in mind his excellent advice, and do his best to make himself agreeable to the taste of the church and congregation. In a few weeks afterwards, he received an invitation to supply them on probation for a month or two. This invitation, at the suggestion of the tutor, he prudently declined; merely stating, that owing to pressing invitations from other quarters, he did not feel himself at liberty to accept an engagement for so long a period as they seemed to think necessary. "In the meantime," continued he, "I hope the Great Shepherd will direct you to a person more gifted and suitable than I am, for your important sphere of labor." This was a first-rate hit. The note produced the desired effect. The crafty Lord Deacon was taken in his own craftiness. The following evening he was at the college in person, having a long and interesting interview with the young man and his celebrated tutor. The old fellow left college well soaped, and on better terms with himself, were it possible, than ever. There never was such a college—there never was such a tutor—there never was such a young man; so kind, so affable, so gifted, so accomplished, and withal, so humble and unassuming. Oh! he was such a treasure, and must without delay be secured. In the hall, young Cameron met him as he was going out. He was on the point of speaking to him, but had the good fortune to refrain. He felt dreadfully nervous, and carelessly asked the housekeeper who that old man was. "Why, don't you know him?" she said with surprise. "He is Mr. Scory. He said he knew you very well." "Well," continued young Cameron, "what did he say he knew of me?" "Oh, he<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5589-00000060"/> only said he knew you when you were a boy." Young Cameron went to his study—thought with a pensive brow and bleeding heart of former joys and sorrows. He did not feel well for days after.</p>
               <p>A church meeting was at once called, an invitation drawn up and signed on behalf of the church and congregation, by my Lord Deacon. This his Lordship took in his own pocket to college, and gave it with his own hand to the young man. Having read its contents, the excellent young man said that he could not give an immediate reply, the step he was called upon to take being of such a momentous character, and involving in itself consequences the most terrible, appalling, and lasting. He would, however, weigh the solemn question in his own mind, and after a week's prayerful consideration, in which he would particularly ask him and the church to join, he would communicate to him and the church the conclusion at which, by God's help, he had arrived. Meanwhile, the young ladies and their pious and simple-minded mammas wondered much whether ther he would come, whether he was likely to be engaged to anyone, which last question was soon satisfactorily settled by the unanimous voice of the company, in the negative. This desirable conclusion was arrived at in three ways: first, on the score of the pious and secluded life he had hitherto led; secondly, on the score of his being taken by the hand by the Lord Deacon himself, whose craftiness was notorious, and who was, poor soul, ridiculously anxious to get his own daughter married; and lastly, whom could the poor young man have seen that could take his fancy, having never been introduced to any of them?</p>
               <p>As for Miss Deacon, ugly creature, no man endowed with common sense could ever think of her. Besides, her having flirted so much with Mr. So-and-so was so much against her, and her age too—why, they say, she is old enough to be his grandmother: she has money, it is true, but such a godly young man would never think of that, having two hundred a-year salary—quite sufficient to enable him to marry whom he likes.</p>
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5589-00000061"/>
               <p>A letter arrives from college, addressed to my Lord Deacon, stating at length the young man's views and feelings relative to the position he is about to occupy amongst them as the elect and chosen of God, the doctrine he intends to preach, and the devotedness with which he determines to consecrate himself both soul and body to their service. The letter is full of feeling and shows the bent of the young man's inclination. He is all they want; he speaks so sweetly of the eternal safety of the children of God, and of the covenant privileges of the elect. How ill-natured was it in other churches to say that he was an Armenian; whereas he is the very reverse. Then the charitable conclusion is arrived at, that those churches envied them their good luck and were anxious to secure his valuable services for themselves.</p>
               <p>My Lord Deacon draws a glowing description of the young man's encouraging prospects of usefulness, the unanimous determination of the office-bearers of the church, the church itself, and the congregation—both old and young, rich and poor—to cooperate with him in all things, and to do their utmost to cheer his heart under his arduous labours, and that those important labours would commence next Sunday fortnight.</p>
               <p>At the appointed time, the darling of the church and congregation arrives. The chapel is crowded to excess. Before he enters the pulpit he puts on a magnificent new gown, and is told in a whisper by my Lord Deacon,—though none but themselves present—that the gown is the gift of the young ladies of the church and congregation as a small token of their anxious solicitude for his comforts, and that the idea of the thing was first mentioned by his dear Emma who was always—poor girl—anxious about the minister's welfare; that the money also was collected by her, and that her own hands made it, and no mistake about that. He enters the pulpit, and a general undertoned exclamation runs through the whole place—is he not a handsome fellow? A hymn is given out by my Lord Deacon, who appears on the occasion the very picture of happiness. The hymn is sung with energy and is<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5589-00000062"/> very suitable, having been selected early on the previous Monday morning by Miss Deacon, and practised all the week by the choir— <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"How beauteous are their feet,</l>
                        <l>Who stand on Zion's hill," &amp;c</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The young man is evidently much affected. He pulls out of his pocket two cambric pocket handkerchiefs—Miss Deacon's eyes glisten with pleasure—with one of them, he takes care of his nose; with the other he takes care of his mouth and face at large. He rises to read, and such reading was never witnessed in that holy place before, no, not even by him who sat enthroned below under the pulpit, my Lord Deacon, and who now looks round with rapture, as he sees the pleasure depicted in every countenance. That important part of the service being over, he gave a shrug of his shoulder, in order to grace the action of bending over the pulpit in the attitude of prayer. His gloves, till now, concealed under the sleeves of his gown, make their appearance, they are beautiful, a shade lighter than the coat, and reflect great credit on his taste. While about the middle of his prayer, he is observed to unbutton the left hand glove, and with his right he gradually removes it, a small diamond ring is seen glittering on his lily little finger. Miss Deacon applies her eye-glass to its proper function. Has she seen that ring before? Can she be mistaken? Could any one else have presumed to give him such a present? Who durst? No one, to be sure. It must be the dear token! How could she be so silly as to think otherwise? Then the sermon came off. And such a sermon! so appropriate, so eloquent, so original! He was really more than his great self that morning, scarcely human!! His evening discourse and performance was equally good, if not better. And to sit under such a dear man always! oh, what a privilege! So different from the poor old minister. The widow of that almost forgotten, though devoted and holy man, happened, unfortunately for her own feelings, to be within hearing when these exclamations escaped the lips of one,<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5589-00000063"/> whom she had foolishly flattered herself, loved and respected her late husband, and sympathized with her in her sorrow. She thought for a moment, that no such thing as religion existed: that all was hypocrisy. That night she retired to rest full of heaviness, having first kissed and talked to the portrait of her departed husband, telling, with tears, the agonies of her mind on that dreadful day. She awoke the following morning with a wounded spirit and a broken heart. The sequel is too painful for publicity. That morning the young minister and Miss Deacon called to see the house, and were much astonished she had not already left, and removed her things, at the same time both protesting that they had not observed that she was at chapel the day before. Poor widow, she felt herself trembling with emotions, for the last remark cut her to the quick! And had she really become so insignificant, and so forgotten! The moment they left, she rushed into her husband's study, as she used to do when in distress. But alas, there was no fond one there to dry her tears, clasp her to his bosom, and kiss into oblivion all her troubles.</p>
               <p>At my Lord Deacon's the scene was different. There, happiness beamed in every countenance, every sorrow seemed to have vanished away. One could have scarcely believed the scene earthly, so little sorrow seemed mixed with it. And who, now, was the sun that ruled this brief day of apparently unalloyed tranquillity and bliss? Why, the illustrious individual called Old Brick by his pious companions at college—the individual who, two months since, was seen bending in his comfortless study over one coal, puffing valiantly at his clay pipe, with old shoes turned to second service as slippers under his feet, the heels of his stockings being somewhat worse for use, and his study coat on the point of falling off, having in the last college skirmish narrowly escaped with innumerable mortal wounds. Can we wonder, should such a young man forget himself, when so admired and caressed? The first Monday morning of his stated ministry among them, no less than fourteen invitations<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5589-00000064"/> tations to dinner were received. He was perplexed, and hardly knew what to do. Observing his difficulties, Miss Deacon suggested, he had better consult with her papa, perhaps, as he was well acquainted with the character of all the people in the place. No sooner said than done. His lordship most graciously condescended to point out to him the many snares that lay concealed under these manifestations of kindly feeling. He then told him the <emph>ins</emph> and <emph>outs</emph> of the whole place, dwelling particularly on the dangers of certain houses, which he would have him avoid, as he respected himself and loved the cause of Christ. And lastly, he told him that it was his unbiassed opinion that it would be better for him as a young man, to remain in his house in a quiet way, for that week, and show as little of himself as possible to the people, as such privacy would greatly tend to increase the respect of all. The young man, being not a little enamored with his new quarters, readily complied with my lord's request, to remain quietly with Miss Deacon for the whole week.</p>
               <p>The disappointed parties, as a matter of course, became much offended with the young man's presumption, for thinking that he could treat them in such an off-hand manner. The poor young man, said some, he is greatly to be pitied, and it is to be feared that he is already in my Lord Deacon's clutches. This being the case, his usefulness is destroyed, he will never do any good. Oh, the <choice>
                     <sic>villany</sic>
                     <corr>villainy</corr>
                  </choice> of that old rascall; his depth is unfathomable; he is a scheming old fellow, that he is. The young man, <choice>

                     <corr>notwithstanding</corr>
                  </choice>, goes on extremely well for six or seven months, and is almost out of the leading strings of the old Lord Deacon. The more the people see of him, the more they like him. It has also been observed that his visits to my Lord Deacon's are growing less and less frequent. His visits to other quarters, not likely to increase his confidence in his lordship, are spoken of with evident pleasure and relief by the hearers in general. At length the poor people are transported by the tidings that the young minister has some pluck in him after all, and that he and my lord have been quarrelling.<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5589-00000065"/> Youth, however, soon found that the grey hairs of age were not to be trifled with. The student found himself the stated pastor, and his stock of sermons exhausted. The desultory habits of the last seven months have given him a thorough aversion to study. But the truth is, his mind never was properly disciplined. He never was a student in the true acceptation of the word. His college time had been given to the preparation of a few popular discourses, tending to mislead the public respecting his talents and acquirements. The congregation begins to dwindle away, the Church becomes dissatisfied, and broad hints are given him that his stipend must be reduced, that the people are not so willing to give as they used to be. The friendship of the old Lord Deacon is again sought, former misunderstandings are explained on both sides. The result is most satisfactory. They become as friendly as ever, and often wondered whatever could have estranged two hearts so alike. My Lord Deacon, after awhile, tells him plainly that he has somehow or other, through a little indiscretion, perhaps haps, completely lost his way among them, and that he would advise him as a friend to seek some other field of labour, where the dear-bought experience which he had, while with them, would be of use to him. His lordship, moreover, promised him if he would leave quietly, to get up a Tea-party, and a small present given to him as a token of remembrance, and an address sent into the papers which would gloss over everything. The young man, too indolent to labour, and too proud to be thought driven out of a place, gladly accepted this apparently kind offer. His lordship that very night got him to sign his resignation. The Church hailed the announcement with delight. The night for the parting Tea-meeting was fixed upon; a gold pencil-case bought as a token of remembrance; an excellent address got up; in which every member of the Church and congregation regretted their beloved, much esteemed, and respected pastor's determination to leave them, and commending him to God and the Word of his Grace, &amp;c. Notwithstanding this splendid set-off by the Church he was leaving, another<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5589-00000066"/> Church ready to receive him could no where be found;—every Church being thoroughly conversant with such barefaced and hypocritical tricks.</p>
               <p>Far be it from me to insinuate that this is the case with all dissenting Churches, or that the education of the generality of dissenting ministers is thus deficient. Many of the dissenting sections of the Christian Church are as pre-eminent for their learning as they are for their piety and usefulness—especially the Presbyterians, whose seats of learning may well vie with the most eminent in Europe. As the views of the hero of this unpretending Tale were so affected by the incidents recorded in the history of his old chum, the author deemed these pages incomplete without the insertion of this chapter.</p>

               <p>LIFE generally takes its complexion from the society in which we move, as certain insects are known to take the colour of the tree upon whose bark they subsist. Man, viewed in this light is, in a great measure, a creature of circumstances, since his inward being is chiefly made up of ideas and sentiments produced by<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5589-00000067"/> surrounding objects. His mind in childhood is like a fountain on the mountain top, which may easily be turned to this or that side of it, and thus forced into quite a different course from what it would otherwise have taken. We seldom find persons born and bred near the sea, seeking after rural enjoyments. Nor have we, on the other hand, often witnessed an individual brought up in some tranquil village in the country, that would willingly change his quiet vocation for the more romantic employment of the mariner.</p>
               <p>To consider this rule, however, as of universal application, would be to put a man on a level with the brute.</p>
               <p>Archibald Cameron formed a striking contrast to an individual of a nature so accommodating.</p>
               <p>When he left college, he found to his great surprise that his father was about to contract a second marriage with a giddy young girl, some months younger than himself. Remonstrance was in vain. He knew, too well, his father's determination. He employed every artifice he could to put off the event as long as possible. His father was determined, and nothing could now be done to shake him from his purpose.</p>
               <p>One lovely evening as they were, taking their accustomed walk together, on the high terrace, above the flower garden, something very much like a quarrel took place between them. They had never before seriously disagreed upon any subject. Though the father could not, on common topics, doubt the sincerity of his son, or the soundness of his judgment. Upon this question, however, he thought that he was too violent, and evidently ridiculously prejudiced against his future step-mother. There may have been a little selfishness, too, he thought within himself, at the root of his violent remonstrances, when he came home from college. Who knows but that he fears the union will damage his prospects. But I shall take care that it will not.</p>
               <p>After such a train of thoughts, he would often blush for cherishing such unworthy suspicion of the motives of his noble Archibald.<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5589-00000068"/> No, it could not be. Archie is too like his noble mother—and the sound trembled upon his lips, and a passing cloud mantled his brow—and a Cameron all over.</p>
               <p>Things went on tolerably well for a few weeks further.</p>
               <p>At length Mr. Cameron told his son plainly and calmly that he would wait no longer, that his mind was made up, and that words were useless.</p>
               <p>Well, then, replied the son, I must quit the old house, dear father. I cannot endure to see any one occupying my dear mother's place.</p>
               <p>The father trembled. He tried to vindicate himself, but the words nearly choked him. He struggled bravely with his feelings.</p>
               <p>Archibald looked him boldly in the face. He never looked so like his mother before. Every feature grew more like her as he grew older. The tone of his voice, too; when he was excited, and his winning ways so like hers.</p>
               <p>Archibald watched the conflict, and half pitied the self-willed old man. He proposed a plan by which all difficulties would be removed. It was to the effect that he should leave home for some time, so that his presence would not interfere with his father's happiness.</p>
               <p>The old man wept, and thanked his son for his generosity, and vowed that, if he had known it would have cost him so much, he had refrained from the affair altogether. But that he had gone so far, that it was impossible for him to retreat with honour. They embraced each other tenderly. Archibald kissed him and felt—trembling with emotions—that it was the last time. He asked him to lay his hand upon his head and bless him. The old man did so, parted his luxuriant looks—scrutinized his features, as if he could never gaze enough upon them, and as if he, too, was taking the last look. He kissed his forehead, <choice>
                     <sic>beathing</sic>
                     <corr>bathing</corr>
                  </choice> it with manly tears, sank into his arm-chair, and hid his face in his hands.</p>
               <p>Archibald left the room—told the old servant to get the carriage and his travelling things ready by three o'clock in the morning; that he must not mention the business to his father, or that he would be fretting and would<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5589-00000069"/> not sleep all night. His orders were punctually attended to. What a night that was to poor Archibald. The first of real sorrow he had ever known. When his dear mother died it was the sorrow of a child, intense, it is true, but ephemeral. His sorrow now was a manly agony. That blighted his childhood: this crushed his manhood. He did not go to bed, lest he should not be called in time in the morning.</p>
               <p>The old housekeeper, his dear mother's favorite, and his nurse, was up and got a nice breakfast for him, by half past two o'clock. This was, indeed, an unexpected and a melancholy pleasure. He made the old woman take a cup of coffee and a piece of toast with him. And at parting kissed her as if she had been his mother, gave her a letter to be delivered to his father when he would question them about him, and trebled the usual parting gift. The old woman was all admiration and gratitude.</p>
               <p>When the father read the letter, he exclaimed, What a noble son! O, that his father were more worthy of him!</p>
               <p>He would not, he said to the old housekeeper, work upon my feelings again, by a parting embrace. O, kind cruelty!—considerate respect for one's infirmities. How can I thank heaven enough for giving me such a son; or blame and abhor myself enough for causing him so much sorrow.</p>
               <p>That evening young Cameron found a snug berth with his old tutor, the Rev. Edward Keyworth. They had a thousand things to say to each other, but neither of them—though excellent scholars—knew where to begin, or what to say first, which amounts to something very much like the same thing.</p>
               <p>The next morning post brought a letter from Mr. Cameron requesting the pleasure of his company at the old mansion, and that in his official capacity. The astonished Keyworth trembled all over as if he had never heard of it, though he knew as much about it as young Archibald did. The latter laughed <choice>

                     <corr>heartily</corr>
                  </choice> at the perplexity of his old guide, for he had a most unlucky sense of the ludicrous, which at times, despite all his efforts, he could not control.</p>
               <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5589-00000070"/>
               <p>Old Keyworth exclaimed, somewhat provoked at his old pupil's burst of laughter, what must I do, Archie?</p>
               <p>Why, go by all means, and make him as fast as you possibly can.</p>
               <p>Very strange, sir, very strange sir, the old gentleman is as old as myself.</p>
               <p>As old as yourself, roared out Archibald, great deal older, you are a young man, Mr. Keyworth. I would advise you to get married too. But she must be young, of course, like my worthy step-mother.</p>
               <p>I will wait till I have married you first, retorted the old gentleman.</p>
               <p>Nay, returned the pupil, there will be one chance the less for you then, my venerable friend. I would seriously advise you to make haste. You must have exercised an immense self-denial, to have remained so long in one state.</p>
               <p>Let us change the subject, Archie, I am not a match for you on this point.</p>
               <p>The next day, Mr. Keyworth was on his way to the old mansion. Archibald remained at the Rectory a few days longer, forming plans for the future, and pondering on his isolated lot. Loneliness increased his despondency. He thought of the rejoicings at the old home, and grew so sad and nervous that he trembled lest his intellect should give way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keyworth on leaving expressed a wish that he should remain till his return, so that they might spend a few months together.</p>
               <p>His guest negatived his request by a melancholy shake of the head. He spent several hours every day in reading his Bible and Baxter's Saints Everlasting Rest, His religious enthusiasm began to return. He felt a renewed pleasure in communion with God. The old feelings awakened by his mother, and fostered by himself in the cave in the rock, came back and warmed his cold heart, increased his fervor, lighted up his dejected countenance with a holy confidence and vigorous hope.</p>
               <p>He was still undecided respecting his future movements, till one morning the servant told him she had just received a note from Mr. Keyworth, saying he would be at home in the<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5589-00000071"/> course of the following day. To hear of the rejoicings at his own quiet, happy home, he had no wish. Indeed, he determined not to hear it, by quitting the Rectory that very day.</p>
               <p>Under the pretence of visiting a friend in the country, he told the servant not to be uneasy about him, as he intended to remain with him for a short time. He also desired that his baggage should be forwarded to Bristol by that evening's stage, and that a letter which he left on the table in the library, should be given to Mr. Keyworth on his return.</p>
               <p>About noon he commenced his pilgrimage, not knowing whither he went. The day was remarkably fine, and at intervals, so hot that he was obliged to take shelter in a small ale-house by the roadside, till the cool of the evening. Being shown into a small parlour by himself, he took out his Bible, and read the history of Abraham, the trials of Isaac, and the adventures of Jacob, and marked such passages as he thought peculiarly applicable to his own case.</p>
               <p>So absorbed had he become in this pleasing and profitable work, that when he closed his treasure, the shades of evening were rapidly gathering round him. The stars were already visible. As he gazed upon them, he beguiled the tedium of his lonely journey, by thinking that they were the very stars that lighted Abraham during his pilgrimage—watched over the dreaming Jacob, while he spent the first night from his kindred. Then, he thought of the inspiration they seemed to have imparted to the poetic David, when with rapture he exclaimed—"The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork." He next wondered what complexion they assumed, while witnessing the agonies of the Redeemer in the Garden. Probably they turned away from the sight, as the sun did when He died. Nature, though mute, was eloquent in her vindication of her Maker's character. His enthusiasm knew no bound. He fancied himself a second Abraham. Everything seemed pregnant with promises of future greatness, and rife with the glories that were<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5589-00000072"/> to illumine his bright career. Thus the repose of nature exerted the most friendly influence on his mind. He thought the moon looked kindly upon him. He imagined the whole universe as a vast theatre,—earth, the stage—the sun and moon, the chandeliers that lighted it—the stars, the innumerable galleries, teeming with spectators, anxiously watching the proceedings—the actors, all the race of man—the subject, Redemption—the hero, the Messiah—the plot, the overthrow of vice, and the final triumph of virtue.</p>
               <p>While youth and hope were equally busy in counting his future exploits in the cause of virtue, a ruffian rushed out of a large bush near the side of the road, and furiously attacked him, demanding his money or his life. Our young adventurer's enthusiasm getting the better of his judgment, he checked his first impulse—which was to strike the fellow—and said to himself, "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God;" and unbuttoning his coat, he took out his Bible. His assailant, mistaking it for a case of pistols, gave a horrible yell, took to his heels, and was no more seen. Seeing the result, he cried out with rapture and amazement—"Thy word is a sun and a shield;—when a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him." The effect produced on his mind by this strange incident was electrifying. To minds of cooler temperament, such occurrences may appear trifling. Yet, I very much doubt that a sage is to be found, stoic enough, to regard with indifference the smallest of the links of which the chain of existence is composed. Every rare event in our lives forms a new era in the history of our faith, in what we regard as the guiding-star of our existence; be that fate, accident, God, or whatever else the mind is capable of imagining, as exerting such a controling influence on our destinies. Faith, whatever be its nature, cannot remain stationary: it must either increase or diminish. That young Archibald's faith in God's providence became greatly strengthened by his singular deliverance, cannot be wondered at, when we consider the enthusiasm of his mind at the time it occurred.</p>

               <p>EXCITEMENT often carries us through difficulties that would otherwise prove far too formidable for us: and when we have overcome them, it is some time before, we are able thoroughly to comprehend what we have gone through. The general outlines invariably leave a deep impression on the mind; but the minutiæ must be supplied during the cooler moments of reflection tion, that gradually succeed: and this was precisely the case with young Cameron. Finding himself standing in a large field adjoining a farm-house, he was not a little confused, until, recollecting his having travelled about thirty miles by a stage coach, that overtook him not far from the spot whence he made his escape; and afterwards his having turned from the main road into a foot-path, that conducted him across a small hill into the field where he now stood, an idea flashed across his mind that he could not be far from the town of Gloucester. Impatient to realize this pleasing thought, he entered the house, and having ascertained the locality, he was gratified on being informed that he was within a short distance of that city.</p>
               <p>The kind farmer, on being told of what had passed during the preceding night, requested him to repose under his roof for that day, Having acknowledged his kindness, and participated of the repast that was set before him, he retired to rest. The deliverance of the past night was not, however, forgotten. Bending himself before God, he gave Him hearty thanks<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5589-00000074"/> for his providential escape, and dedicated himself anew to His service. In this happy state of mind, he almost instantaneously fell into a profound sleep.</p>
               <p>During this rest, if it may be called so, after such a night, all he had undergone passed in review before him. Nor was his repose less signalized on account of the varied characters of the dreams by which he was incessantly haunted. One in particular deserves to be mentioned, as it affords a kind of clue to the future. He saw a venerable old gentleman entering his room, and giving him a precious jewel, saying in a tremulous whisper, as he pressed it into his hand, "<emph>Keep it and thou shalt prosper</emph>."</p>
               <p>When he awoke, the night was casting her dark mantle over the earth, and he heard the servants joyfully congratulating each other on their return from their arduous toils, and his kind hostess gently reproving them for disturbing the stranger that was in bed; at the same time, observing that he was uncommonly low in his spirits, as if his wits were not exactly like those of other men. This being corroborated by a hearty laugh from the rest of the company, the conversation turned upon another topic—and, perhaps, more interesting upon the whole—relative to their own affairs. He got out of bed as silently as possible, lest he should in the least degree interrupt an intercourse in which mind and body seemed equally engaged. While dressing himself, as he was bending to tie his shoe, he saw a large blue eye quite covering a small hole that was in the thin wainscot, which served as a partition between his bedroom and the adjoining one, intently fixed upon him. No sooner, however, had the little urchin seen him turning towards the door, than he clamorously rushed down the stairs, telling his mamma that the stranger was getting up. On this important notice, the whole group immediately dispersed, and no other sound was heard than that of his kind hostess, busily preparing a breakfast for him, as she afterwards playfully observed; while the rest of the family were in the adjoining room taking supper.</p>
               <p>Having done justice to what was set before<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC5589-00000075"/> him, he betook himself into the other room, where, to his astonishment, he saw about thirty men, six or seven women, and four or five lads, sitting together in a large rustic apartment; while a blazing fire revealed the innocent happiness that beamed in their healthful countenances. At the head of a large square table sat the farmer himself, with his wife on the right hand, and his eldest daughter, with the other children, on the left; and he, as a stranger was permitted to sit next to his kind hostess, perhaps, because they had entered the room about the same time, or, more probably, from deference to him as a stranger, that being considered as the highest honour.</p>
               <p>He was regarded by the company with evident curiosity. Every eye was intently fixed upon him—every countenance wore an expression characteristic of the mind within.</p>
               <p>When the confusion that his entrance had created ceased, the farmer, who, he now saw, was going to conduct family worship, called upon one of the lads that sat on his left hand, to give out the Evening Hymn, which he did with all the gravity that the solemnity of such an occasion demands:—</p>

               <p>The simplicity and deep pathos with which his youthful lips pronounced these verses produced a deep impression upon Mr. Cameron's mind. He thought the verses peculiarly appropriate to his case. He was indeed a pilgrim, and such in every respect as they represented. In one of his sentiments, the novelty of the whole scene, together with the deep tone of piety that seemed to pervade the whole group, while raising their song of praise to the Father of their spirits, could not fail, after what he had passed through, to excite feelings of no ordinary character, somewhat akin to the sudden and pleasing feeling of a shipwrecked mariner, at the first touch of land. His agitated soul felt at once as reposing under the tree of life, enjoying the delights of Christian sympathy; drinking deep of the river that males glad the city of God; and as the farmer read the fourteenth chapter of the Gospel pel of St. John, and expatiated on the valedictory discourse of our Saviour to his disciples on the evening prior to his leaving them, he felt every sentence sinking deep into his soul, touching new springs of love and gratitude, and opening new fountains of consolations. He considered himself as already more than recompensed for his toils and sufferings; but when the prayer was offered up, and the eternal throne grasped in his behalf with the Patriarch's zeal, while wrestling with the angel in Peniel, he felt as if he already stood on the very threshold of the holy city, and was reminded of his mortality only by the return of his consciousness, whose progress gradually lessened the glimpse he had obtained, till it was lost in the distance.</p>
               <p>Such are God's dealings with his children, that he leads them by the hand through this world, for he tells us that all his saints are in His hand; but, at intervals, like an indulgent father, raising the little ones on his shoulder that they may command a more extensive prospect, He lifts them up above the narrow horizon<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5589-00000077"/> zon of the seen and temporal, that they may glance at the unseen and spiritual.</p>
               <p>The evening was now far spent, indeed the streaks of the east showed that it was already day, and his intended journey to Bristol had to be performed. To part with these Christian friends, whose sympathy he had so richly enjoyed, and by whose holy fervor and zeal his soul had been so refreshed, was keenly felt by his affectionate and susceptible mind. Thus earthly friendship is but the damming up of the sorrow that overwhelms parting. So neighbouring are the fountains of joy and grief, that the one seldom flows without mingling its streams with the other. Their kindness, however, had greatly strengthened his confidence as to his future success. He became more calm and resigned, fully convinced that he was doing the will of Him in whose hands were all his ways.</p>
               <p>Having exchanged some tokens of remembrance, they parted with one another, with the fullest assurance that they should meet again in that heavenly country which they so eagerly sought and in which separation is unknown, and the ties that were broken here by sin, are reunited, and rendered as permanent as eternity.</p>

               <p>ON his arrival in the city of Bristol, Mr. Cameron entered the first inn, that met his eye. Being a Market day, the commercial room was crowded to excess. Dissatisfied with the place, he was on the point of leaving, when the landlady, seeing him rising from his seat, offered to take him to a more private accommodation, into which she had, about an hour before, conducted two other strangers. On his entering the room, the dream of the farm house at once rushed upon his mind, so that he hardly knew where he was, nor what he sought there; for the old man that sat in an arm-chair by the fire, was to the very life, the man that gave him the precious jewel, saying, "<emph>Keep it, and thou shalt prosper</emph>."</p>
               <p>Having summoned all his philosophy to his aid, the tempest that raged within, gradually abated, and he became a little more calm and composed. Still his mind wandered in unknown regions, filled with the most imposing objects, transcending all that he had ever seen, or heard, or felt before; and near which his wildest fancy had never ventured to rove. This delirium of delight, having spent itself, he again felt his usual equanimity regaining the empire of his soul. He still felt far from comfortable. He fancied himself extremely awkward. His heart beat violently; and he most unaccountably blushed. He rose from his seat and examined with great composure—as he thought—the flight to Egypt and other pious pictures with which the walls were adorned. Had they been the portraits of notorious highwaymen, they would, at that moment, have been<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5589-00000079"/> equally interesting to him. His eye stealthily feasted on a different object.</p>
               <p>The sight of the fair daughter of the venerable gentleman whose presence had brought with it such strange and new bodings to his mind—as she gracefully bent over the sacred page, and the music of her voice while the grey-headed father was treasuring with a miser's care every sentence that fell from her lips, in his heart, gave rise to these extraordinary feelings in his bosom. All the baser passions stood abashed in the presence of so much purity and love—holy love formed the very soul of his ambition. He felt at once the congeniality of the atmosphere in which he breathed: nor were they less conscious of the charm that his presence seemed to have inspired. Nor can we indeed wonder that their sympathy should have so melted into one common interest, when we are informed that both parties were in quest of the same object.</p>
               <p>The old man was very much dejected and could find no comfort except in that exhaustless fountain,—the word of God. He had just buried her who had been the sharer of his toils and comforts for nearly forty years; and the scenes which had so long witnessed their mutual sympathy and enjoyments, appeared so fraught with all that recalled the delights of the past, and reminded him of the loneliness of the present—that their sight became more intolerable than death itself. It was on this account, and at the suggestion of his daughter, that he had been induced to quit his former residence, hoping that a new abode would be more conducive to the re-establishing of his health, and the prevention of those gloomy thoughts to which he was naturally predisposed. Having secured a small cottage in a tranquil part of the Principality, they were now on the way thither. On hearing these particulars, Mr. Cameron entered into a long dissertation on the mysteriousness of Divine Providence by which he had been led into their delightful company, together with the identity of the object of their pursuit.</p>
               <p>These disclosures imperceptibly drew them closer to each other than they had hitherto<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5589-00000080"/> ventured. Mr. Cameron had unconsciously drawn his chair close to that of Mr. Acehambur (for that, as he afterwards learned, was the name of that venerable gentleman), while Alison, his daughter, was all attention, and so completely absorbed in the conversation that, when dinner was announced, she too, to her great distress, to be sure, found her chair close to the one occupied by Mr. Cameron.</p>

               <p>HAVING satisfied the cravings of nature, Mr. Cameron, impatient to learn more of his new friend's history, proposed that their former conversation should be resumed. Mr. Acehambur, evidently pleased with the deference paid him by his young acquaintance, said, that, for his part, he liked to say as much as could be said on a subject before new topics were introduced. Assuming an air of conscious superiority—an advantage which age seldom forgets—he dwelt much on the leading events of his life.</p>
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5589-00000081"/>
               <p>"When I was young," said he, "I was one of the most thoughtless beings that ever lived. In every scene of pleasure and dissipation, I was the first, and out the last. I ate wickedness like bread and drank iniquity like water, and my feet moved swiftly along the path that leads to the gates of hell. Yes, yes—I went almost so far as to deny the Lord who bought me.</p>
               <p>"But thanks be praised! thanks be praised!" he said, as the big tear rolled down his furrowed cheek: "He did not leave me to the hardiness of my own evil and wicked heart. Oh! He is a kind parent, Mr. Cameron, and allow me to recommend Him to you, young friend, as the Guide of your youth."</p>
               <p>Mr. Cameron said, with great emotion, that his constant prayer was, "My Father, be Thou the Guide of my youth."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, dear youth," said Mr. Acehambur, "He is more ready to give than we are to receive—more ready to hear than we are to request. When I was quite spent in the service of the wicked one, having devoted my best years to the enemy of my soul, and seized with that lassitude attendant upon a long course of dissipation, so that I was but a useless being in the enemies' ranks, 'He worked in me both to will and to do of His own good pleasure."</p>
               <p>Here Miss Alison interrupted the conversation by telling her papa that Mr. Cameron would, perhaps, like to hear of the way in which he was led to become a professed disciple of Christ.</p>
               <p>Young Archibald's <choice>
                     <sic>countenanc ebrightened</sic>
                     <corr>countenance brightened</corr>
                  </choice> as he caught the suggestion of Miss Alison, saying, that nothing could give him greater delight than to hear of those blessed means that led his wayward feet to take that step which approximates the kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p>Miss Alison's eyes glistened with delight as she saw the promptitude with which Mr. Cameron attended to her every wish.</p>
               <p>"Thoughtless child," said Mr. Acehambur, smiling as he was uttering the words, guessing what was in her mind.</p>
               <p>She blushed at this gentle reproof, fearing she had betrayed a feeling with which she thought none but herself acquainted.</p>
               <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC5589-00000082"/>
               <p>To put an end to this slight confusion, Mr. Acehambur proceeded to the looked-for narrative:—</p>
               <p>"When I was about twenty-two years of age," continued he, "I was introduced into the society of a young clergyman of the name of Percy. He was a lovely character. He was the first to speak to me about religion. He seemed indeed to answer the end of his creation. To bring poor miserable sinners to Christ formed his chief ambition, the soul of his ministry. He was never happy but when employed for God. He spoke to me of the evil of sin till I was induced to abandon it—of holiness till I was constrained to seek after it—of God till I was made to love him above all things—of Christ till I felt myself bound, a willing captive, by the cords of His love, and I trust that the same heaven that received him, will, also, unworthy as I am, receive me."</p>
               <p>Here his voice faltered—a slight convulsion seized him; but, on a sudden, his countenance though suffused with tears, became irradiated with smiles of ineffable benignity, and his eyes fixed, as if nothing intervened between them and the blessed abode, of his departed friend.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cameron, though greatly moved, observed that to lose religious friends is a great trial; but that it is a great comfort to think of the Friend that loveth at all times—the Friend that sticketh closer than a brother, who ever liveth, making intercession for the saints according to the will of God.</p>
               <p>"That is all my comfort," added Mr. Acehambur, with fervor—evidently showing that he could value real sympathy. "My obligations to Mr. Percy are innumerable. It was he that introduced me, first, to his sister, who afterwards became my wife, and then to all his connexions in whose society I have been doubly blessed, both as it regards the life that now is, and that which is to come."</p>
               <p>The conversation had now become a little brighter, and he fully entered into a detail of all the trifling incidents that contributed to strengthen the mutual attachment formed between him and Miss Percy, together with a full<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC5589-00000083"/> account of their marriage and their devotedness to each other.</p>
               <p>The delight with which Mr. Cameron and Miss Alison exchanged looks during this narration, might have been mistaken for a long and steady friendship, had not the quick blush which followed betrayed a newer feeling, and a more recent attachment.</p>
               <p>The silence that ensued was complete. None was inclined to break it. It seemed to consummate their mutual enjoyment. A loud tap at the door startled them into real life again, and, immediately, a boisterous servant entered the room announcing that, were Mr. Acehambur determined to leave the following morning, the luggage must be taken to the coach-office, and that the porter was waiting his decision.</p>
               <p>Mr. Acehambur left the room to see that all was safe. The young adventurer was now left alone with his idol. Both were silent. They durst not look at each other. Mr. Cameron regarded every moment now as the last of existence, but could not utter a word. He as confused and awkward in his manner. His fair companion, on the other hand, was almost fainting at the idea that they were to part, and perhaps, never to meet again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Acehambur returned. During his absence not a word had passed between the young lovers.</p>
               <p>Guessing, however, from the appearance of Mr. Cameron, and the timidity evinced by Alison, and judging from his own feelings, for he had not forgotten the sentiments of youth, Mr. Acehambur relieved them by introducing a new subject upon which they could converse freely.</p>
               <p>But Cameron was too confused to be able to converse freely on any subject. His feelings were so new that he actually thought that old things had passed away, and that all things had become new. His mind appeared like a vessel without a helm, at the mercy of every breeze, and obedient to every turn of the furious surge. He was ever flying from one topic to another, as if he had nothing in view, but to avoid the<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5589-00000084"/> one that he ardently wished, though evidently dreaded, to approach.</p>
               <p>Mr. Acehambur at length succeeded in giving a lighter tone to the conversation. He spoke much of the reward that always attends virtuous deeds. "So it is," said Mr. Cameron, catching his meaning. "When I was quite a lad," continued he, "I was made instrumental to save the life of a fellow-being; and whenever I think of that I feel such inward satisfaction, in exchange for which the greatest earthly reward would be but a poor compensation."</p>

               <p>WHEN the landlady—whose undue attention had materially impaired the tone and manner of the conversation—withdrew, Miss Alison who was ever ready to countenance Cameron, requested him to acquaint them with what he<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5589-00000085"/> was about to relate when the landlady intruded upon them.</p>
               <p>"With all my heart," was the reply. "The circumstances were simply these;—I was going a little distance from home on business for my mother. A part of my road lay along a large river, and as I was walking, my attention was arrested by seeing two little girls running on the bank of the river wringing their hands, and shrieking most piteously, calling out for help. I quickly ran to their relief, when, to my astonishment, I saw that one of them was borne away by the current. I immediately plunged into the water, and by a desperate effort saved her life." Miss Alison shrieked out, and wildly ran into his arms, exclaiming, "I am she—I am she! You are the man that saved my life—you are the man that ——." Here her voice faltered, and pronouncing an incoherent blessing on his name, she fainted, and her head fell helplessly on his arm.</p>
               <p>The scene was most affecting. Mr. Acehambur wept for joy to have found the deliverer of his only child; and Cameron's delight at these unexpected forebodings of future happiness was like a momentary delirium. He gazed on her placid cheek with a fondness that might have taught stoics themselves tenderness. This apparent sympathy with the daughter, at once inclined the father in his favour. He thanked God for such a providential discovery. Then he looked into his face with a father's fondness, while his voice, as he gratefully acknowledged his obligations to him for saving the life of his beloved child, softened into the subduing tenderness of a mother's gratitude. He threw himself into every attitude of which his aged body was capable, but none could discover the joy he wished to express. Then he would hysterically pace about the room, and intently gaze on him, examining his features, as if to ascertain the reality of his presence. Exhausted by the intensity of his feelings, he threw himself on the first chair that offered, hid his face in his hands, and sobbed aloud. The sterner traits of his character seemed to have deserted him—the milder qualities were alone visible. It often happens that the more<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC5589-00000086"/> manly and vigorous the mind is, the more irresistible the opposite qualities are, when fully developed.</p>
               <p>Miss Alison having in some degree recovered, was gently laid on a sofa, while Cameron was busily employed in attending to her aged father, who was not, however, very long in becoming himself again.</p>
               <p>All the strange feelings that had been gathering around, and pent up in Archibald's bosom, found vent in a flood of tears. His tears were, however, but the contents of what had for the last few hours, which appeared to him as years so beclouded the firmament of his happiness. The apprehensions of losing Alison, which he considered the only thing that could intervene between him and the perpetual sunshine of bliss, were now fast vanishing before the beaming satisfaction that played around her and her father's countenances.</p>
               <p>Encouraged by what had passed between them, he stammered out, in a few broken sentences, a proposal to accompany them to their destination. This proposal also, awkward as it was, embodied an humble request that he might take up his abode with them, at least for a few weeks, until he should form a more definite plan as to his future course.</p>
               <p>His proposal having been accepted, and the request complied with, he was overwhelmed with joy. He again and again expressed how grateful he was for such an act of kindness.</p>
               <p>"It is but meet," replied Mr. Acehambur, "that we should thus endeavour to requite your more than kindness to us. We can never make enough of you, Mr. Cameron. I feel already that your proposal to accompany us has opened a new channel for the overflowing affection of my heart towards you. It has touched a cord, of which I knew not, until now, that this shattered instrument (applying his hand to his heart,) was possessed. I feel as if it had moved the spring that set all its melodies in motion. I feel as if my younger days had returned. Methinks I see Mr. Percy in your every movement." He shook violently, and seemed much affected.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cameron did not know how to reply to<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5589-00000087"/> such an overflowing gratitude. He had never before witnessed such intensity of love and flow of soul. He stood spell-bound, riveted to the spot. When he rose from his seat, he thought of speaking; when he could not, he determined to pace the room; but when, to his confusion, he found that he could do neither, he sank on the chair, hid his face with both hands, laying his elbows on the table. He was silent and evidently in agony of mind, but it was such agony as few minds are capable of realizing—agony, because he feared that his affections were but callous, and his gratitude but a vain show, when compared with the more ardent affections and the more real gratitude of his aged patron and friend. Happily for poor Cameron, while he was thus bitterly accusing himself of ingratitude, though, in reality, the reverse was the case, the sagacity and experience of Mr. Acehambur perceived in his very confusion the intensity of his gratitude, and in his very silence the unspeakable greatness of his love.</p>
               <p>Supper being announced, the conversation became more free and general. Miss Alison became quite talkative, proposing to go herself to take another place in the coach for Mr. Cameron, that they might enjoy his company during their journey. Cameron was in raptures. He appeared as if he had just found his own natural father and sister after a long and painful separation—such was his free, unreserved demeanor. Nor were they indeed less free and open in their dealings with him. Each read his own happiness in the countenance of the other. Their joy was as unconfined as the air they breathed—as natural as the heaving of the chest and the act of respiration—as pure in its nature as innocence and love.</p>
               <p>Mr. Acehambur having, in a comprehensive and pathetic prayer, acknowledged the temporal, and especially the spiritual blessings so graciously bestowed upon them, making particular reference to their meeting with Mr. Cameron, they parted with each other for the night.</p>
               <p>Miss Alison, however, was called aside by her father, and gently reproved for her imprudence<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5589-00000088"/> dence in speaking so much about getting Mr. Cameron's company on the coming day.</p>
               <p>"You must consider," continued he, "that you are but a mere girl, seventeen years of age, whereas he is a young man, in his twentieth year, in the bloom of life. He is full blown, in the flower of his age, you only in the bud. You must now be more careful how you speak."</p>
               <p>"Why, he saved my life. If it had not been for him, you would have no child, papa."</p>
               <p>"It is true, he had been made instrumental to save your life, but you should not, on that account, become foolish."</p>
               <p>"Suppose, then, papa, that we could not get a place for him inside, why then I should go with him on the outside, and then, you would have plenty of room to stretch your stiff leg, for you know very well, when you keep it long in the same position, it becomes quite painful. We must treat him as a gentleman, you know, because he is going to live with us—mustn't we?" looking tenderly into his face, as if to elicit a favourable reply.</p>
               <p>He looked thoughtful. She could not construe strue his meaning, and was obliged to retire to rest, more dissatisfied than otherwise, at his mysterious conduct.</p>
               <p>The leaving of his company, however, seemed to restore her to that; of Cameron, for she could not doubt but that they were one in spirit, and that the most delicious of all communion—that of the heart and spirit—was mutual. Mr. Acehambur had now leisure to think more calmly of what that mysterious evening had revealed. His thoughts recurred to his having promised to take Mr. Cameron with him. Then he pondered what might be the probable issue of such an engagement. He was an entire stranger. He knew nothing of his connexions. He might, for aught he knew, be a runaway vagabond. Then he would correct himself for his having for one moment harbored such a thought of the deliverer of his dearest Alison. He thought himself that their meeting must be of God, since the circumstances by which they were brought together could not be so ordered by any other being.</p>
               <p>"Alison," he again muttered to himself, "is<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5589-00000089"/> very young and inexperienced, and seems much attached to him. Poor girl, she knows but little of the grief in which her joy may end." Here he chid himself, saying, "Why should I be always looking on the dark side? He is a good man, and his steps seem to me ordered by the Lord. I will not murmur. Thy will be done." Having again bent his aged knees before God, he sank into a profound sleep.</p>

               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the confusion of the preceding night, Mr. Acehambur and Alison were up at their usual time, and had nearly concluded their morning devotion before Mr. Cameron had made his appearance. The confusion with which he entered the room, and the efforts by which he endeavoured to conceal his joy, at again meeting with Miss Acehambur, were too<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC5589-00000090"/> visible to pass unnoticed. Nor, indeed, did she make any secret of hers. Her face crimsoned at her own happiness—as little could her undisguised nature hide it, as the darkness of a room can hide a burning taper placed in its centre.</p>
               <p>Mr. Acehambur observed with satisfaction, their mutual delight, and saw in Cameron, a kind and faithful guardian for his beloved Alison when he should be no more. In a few days, they were happily settled in their new residence. To give a full and just description of this delightful spot is next to impossibility. It stood on a small eminence, commanding on the one side, the view of an extensive and fruitful valley where nature and art seemed to vie with each other in exhibiting their choicest treasures, and in mutually lavishing the well-earned rewards of industry. The other side, wearied the eye by its unmitigated sterility. The pulseless repose of the mountain's towering on high, assumed the aspect of an unconquerable union, heightened by their massiveness into a terrific grandeur. From one of these rocks, there issued a murmuring rivulet; which after it had watered the garden and a well-cultivated field, that faced the door of the house, emptied itself into a small lake that couched beneath the declivity upon which this delightful cottage stood. It seemed as if nature had embellished it by bringing into one small spot a specimen of every variety of which she is possessed. It was every way suited to the taste of a pious and contemplative mind. It was the very image of tranquillity and repose: so quiet, that the spirit of devotion seemed to be ever present with its inhabitants—so calm, that the silent voice of conscience was tremblingly listened to—so holy, that Heaven's children alone dwelt there; for I was told upon good authority, that the servants and all about the house were chosen from among the most pious that could be found.</p>
               <p>Many were the delightful hours that Archibald Cameron and Miss Acehambur spent in rambling over the rocks or pleasantly conversing under the refreshing shades of some ancient tree, with which many a legend stood connected<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC5589-00000091"/> nected in their memory as having been authentically related to them by some of the old servants, whose veracity could not be doubted, since they themselves had seen more things than one near that spot. One of these stories has so much of the marvellous and the pathetic in it, that not to insert it would be an injustice to the reader of these pages. The subject of this short narrative was a young man of great personal attraction, the son of a Nonconformist Minister, who, with several of his flock, during the time that persecution raged on the Continent, had sold all that they possessed in order that they might take refuge in this quiet nook in the Principality. After a few years of severe labour, the father died. The son, being a devoted youth, and much attached to his father's principles, was duly elected by the unanimous voice of the church and congregation as his successor. It was soon discovered that he possessed talents of the first order, even superior, in some respects, to those of his father. He was much more eloquent. This, however, was the opinion of the younger portion of the flock. The older members, who had been accustomed for years to see the same personification of calmness filling the pulpit, to sing the same sweet hymn, to be soothed by the constant repetition, under the name of variety, of the same prayer, and quite sent off from the toils and sorrows of earth—not to heaven, 'tis true, but to a place close at hand, the happy world of forgetfulness—by the very same delightful and profitable discourse from Sabbath to Sabbath—thought the young man rather shallow and flowery, forgetting that the deepest and finest soil yields the best harvest. His new way of explaining the sacred volume they called a mere rhapsody of words. His fine fancy they smiled at as an airy speculation, and his exquisite delineation of characters was regarded as personalities. But heedless of these ungenerous and unjust remarks, he toiled on in his Master's vineyard; knowing that every breath lessened the distance between him and the glorious reward that awaited his unworthy labours. This spirit of dissension among the members of the church was, however, but as<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5589-00000092"/> the roar of the wind, which was soon to be lost in the fury of the tempest that was about to break in upon the hitherto comparative tranquillity of his very successful ministerial career. On his entering the ministry, he had taken up his abode with the acting deacon of the church, and the pretended friend of his father. This gentleman's lady was his second bride, and considerably younger in years than himself. Here was a severe test for a well-favoured youth, especially when we remember that, amongst the Nonconformists, a deaconess or a she-patron is the compass on which the minister is to keep his steadiest look, her eye, the needle whose significant movements are to be narrowly watched; for a mistake here is fatal—her smile, the serene heaven that promises a prosperous voyage—the contraction of her brow, the lowering of the weather that announces the approaching storm—her frown, utter destruction. At first, her attentions were received as tokens of Christian love and the overflowings of a generous heart. After awhile she grew more bold, and became devotional even to affectation. He could not take a walk, or visit the flock without her being fast by his side. Dark hints, which to the poor youth were dark indeed, were thrown out respecting the callous disposition of her husband, and that their marriage was a queer affair altogether; that it was brought about more by her father's good opinions of him than, in consequence of any tender feeling cherished by herself, and that indeed she never did nor could love him, pretending to dry a forced tear that stood in her lustful eye. To follow the whole process by which this crafty tempter tried to compass her end, and satiate her insatiable desires, under the garb of religious pretensions, as still current among the old people, would be neither profitable nor becoming. It will be a relief to the reader to learn that this faithful Minister of Christ nobly sustained the conflict and achieved the victory. But her disappointment was most keenly felt, and the thought of living in his presence was excruciating beyond endurance. She now began to hate him with a perfect hatred. The faithfulness of his preaching was intolerable.<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC5589-00000093"/> He did not preach the Gospel. He was a notorious liar, and proverbial for his loose habits with the weaker sex. Her husband's ears were filled with reports of his attacks upon her honour. He, duped by the fairness of her speech and tenderness of her caresses, became almost frantic with rage; yet he did not, like an honest man, openly attack this unfortunate youth; but at the suggestion of his wife and son, who, of course, felt much for his mother, for he was his mother's child, with respect to his outward shape and inward obliquity, and had no more of his father, either within or without him, than his mother's heart. By this time his chapel had become crowded to excess. This auspicious sign was hailed by our youthful evangelist as an omen for good. He clearly saw that his usefulness and popularity would greatly increase. Little did he conjecture that such a lovely day breeds, or, at any rate, brings forth to active life more snakes, vipers, adders, scorpions, &amp;c., than a thousand wintry days. The natural and the spiritual seemed to him full of promise.</p>
               <p>Within three weeks from this time, he was to make the most pious and the most wealthy lady in the neighbourhood his bride. He thought that heaven smiled on conscience, and that his concealed integrity was about to be rewarded openly. After the course of nature, the sun of his life had not as yet attained its meridian; but, as it afterwards proved; its orb of light was full. Its wane had begun. Tribulation and anguish were at hand. The horrid invention hatched by his vile host, and more than vile hostess, was now to become his. They accused him of circulating false notes. They had him taken up and brought before the magistrates. On being questioned by them, he boldly denied the charge, and offered them all his keys in order that his boxes might be searched. His host seemed much pleased with his frankness, and said that he would willingly stake his charge on that experiment, and that if nothing was found in his boxes to warrant his allegation, he would gladly withdraw what had been said. The searching of his desk, however, produced his death warrant, for a large<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC5589-00000094"/> roll of notes was found amongst his other papers, answering exactly to the one produced by his merciless host. The agonies of his mind at this discovery exceeded the power of description. His doom was sealed—his fate irrevocable.</p>
               <p>The period of his imprisonment, he is said to have borne with patience and fortitude, manifesting the most forgiving disposition, and often earnestly praying that God would turn the hearts of his persecutors to confess his innocency. But his keenest pangs were felt on account of the young lady to whom he was to be married, and upon whom his present situation had brought such a reproach. In whatever light others regarded his unparalleled persecution, she was unremitting in her attention to him and proved the depth of her love by her inestimable sympathy with the sufferings which so much sanctity was destined to endure. Night and day she watched over him, and cheered his drooping spirit, removing every obstacle that lay in the way of his complete resignation to his fate, and by her angelic presence throwing a bright light around the shores of eternity; reminding him of his approaching end, when every cause of sorrow would be removed, and a state of perfect happiness enjoyed. Often, while he was cast down would she say to him—"Do not despond, dearest, God is your refuge, and He is your very present help in this time of trouble. Can we suppose, my dearest, that He will suffer the plants of His right-hand planting, nourished in His Church, the garden of His holiness, watered with the dew of his grace, invigorated by the beams of his smiling countenance to be plucked for a fuel to consume the implacable enemies of virtue, when the precious bud is about to flower in surpassing beauty and eternal bloom, fit to grace with its loveliness, to please with its inimitable delicacy, and to perfume with its fragrance the most hallowed place in the universe, the immediate presence of him who is the source of all beauty and fountain of all goodness." Such was the language of this unequalled beauty. Her whole soul was one burning flame of love, which nothing could<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC5589-00000095"/> quench. Her mental agony and bodily exertions, however at length, weakened her delicate constitution, and symptoms of approaching dissolution began to appear. The intensity of her love heralded her fate. So rapid did inward grief proceed with its work, that three days before his execution, while kneeling by his side, her pure soul fled to God, whence it came. Thus did she go before him to the skies, where he was so soon to meet her to renew their love, and to be eternally in each others' society, celebrating the marriage-supper of the Lamb, where injustice cannot prevail and hypocrisy is unknown. This was an answer to their prayers, for their great desire was, that as all hope of their earthly union had been taken away they should be permitted to leave this vale of tears together, and together enter their everlasting rest. His anxiety on her account was now at an end. His own fate was certain. He felt conscious that the realities of the unknown world were about to burst upon his mental vision. Death, though clad in his most ignominious garb, was to him the gate of eternal life. To have a faithful friend that would have rescued his memory from a fate far more terrible than oblivion, would have greatly tended to mitigate the severity of his passion. But, like Job, he was forsaken by all, and accounted, even by those that had professed the greatest attachment to him, as a vile hypocrite and heartless <choice>
                     <sic>villian</sic>
                     <corr>villain</corr>
                  </choice>. The days of his mourning were now nearly over. The bitterness, resulting from the treachery of his former friends sweetened the thought of so soon joining a society of real friends, all bearing the same resemblance to the Friend that loveth at all times, the Friend that sticketh closer than a brother, as his lovely betrothed did, and as he was about to bear.</p>
               <p>The last two days of his life, he spent in drawing upon a sketch of the life and character of this heroic young lady, whose memory was, to him, at least, next in preciousness to that of his Saviour Christ. While thus employed, he seemed to have the sharer of his joys and sorrows still with him. About twelve at night, the last night he was ever to witness, for there<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC5589-00000096"/> is no night in Heaven, the night prior to his execution, he finished the pleasing task, which had been to him a fountain of real pleasure; cheering with its living streams the neighbourhood of death. His sleep, during the rest of the night, was the most tranquil of his life. He knew that he closed his eye-lids for the last time to be opened in a world of sin and sorrow. Few were the eye-lids ln the same neighbourhood, over which the god of sleep reigned that night. The following day was to usher in an event, never to be forgotten. Innocency was to expire while treachery flourished. The morning of that day, this youthful martyr spent in praying for his persecutors and commending with the most intense earnestness the little flock, over which he had for a short period presided, to the care of the Great Shepherd of the sheep. As the appointed hour drew nigh, the vicinity of the prison was densely crowded, all anxious to obtain the last sight of the person, and hear the accent of the voice of the unfortunate young minister. At length the prison bell began to toll. The flush of expectation tation became still more intense. Nothing could exceed the thrill of horror which his appearance created through the whole vast assembly. Every heart, shuddered—every visage turned pale—every eye became a fountain of water—every lip quivered—every limb trembled—every voice was hushed. The innocent object of all this extraordinary feeling was alone unmoved. The venerable, chaplain who stood by, wept like a child. His voice was stifled with emotions that could not struggle out in utterance, or shape themselves into expression. He embraced with affection his young friend for the last time, and without waiting to see the end, left the place. The dying man declared his innocency—prayed with the assembly—besought God to protect the flock over which he was once a shepherd—implored Divine for forgiveness for his enemies—said, with a firm voice, "O Father, receive my spirit," and was ushered into the presence of his God to receive the rewards of the faithful labourer in His vineyard. The feelings of the multitude can be more easily conceived than<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5589-00000097"/> described. When the music of his voice had died upon their ears, and when they saw him, at the same time, in the agony of death, one piercing shrill cry of pity, mingled with indignation, seemed to reach the throne of the eternally Just One, calling aloud for vengeance on the perpetrators of such unparalleled cruelty.</p>
               <p>Such stories as those were often the subjects upon which these lover were wont to converse. They found that while sympathising with the fate of the unfortunate lovers of other days, their attachment to each other increased—their hearts expanded in love towards all the good; while the bad became more revolting than ever in their eyes. The sentimentalism produced by these legends was with them purified by the hallowed influence of religion:—they were living monuments of what refinement earthy love is capable, when allied to heavenly-mindedness. Their time rolled on in a perfect dream of happiness, for, in all their intercourse with each other, they had nothing of a painful character to reflect upon. Their love, however, had still so much of the earthly as not to be beyond the sorrows attendant on the vicissitudes of life. Whatever sorrow the unknown future might have in store for them <emph>here</emph>, one thing they were certain of, that <emph>hereafter</emph> would be full of joys, unembittered by apprehensions. As their attachment resulted from circumstances of no ordinary character, so was the affectionate sentiment they cherished towards each other. It is not, therefore, to be expected that its progress and consummation will be wholly unattended by the extraordinary—it cannot entirely lose its identity. Mr. Acehambur's keen perception could not fail to discover the intensity of their attachment; but he was far from regarding their love with severity. He was indeed delighted with their society. His health became much improved, and the buoyancy of his spirits returned. He felt, to use his own expression, his strength renewed like the eagle's. Nor can we wonder at the change, when we consider that nothing can more successfully dispel the gloom of old age than having a constant intercourse with the young. Nothing can be more obvious than the truthfulness<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC5589-00000098"/> ness of this assertion. Youth cannot sympathise with old age; the latter can, and does involuntarily sympathise with the former: old feelings return—former joys come back to the heart, like long-lost friends, with smiling faces and buoyant steps, and make the old house ring with mirth and jollity. Thus childhood, youth, and manhood are lived over again, and all the accompanied sensations of innocent joys, youthful aspirations, and manly feelings, arrest the devastating progress of the many ills attendant upon our exit from this earthly tabernacle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cameron had now been under Mr. Acehambur's roof for nearly five months, but had not as yet been able to muster up courage enough to introduce the subject of their marriage, though he had once and again resolved to do so. Seeing, however, that the longer he delayed the more formidable became the obstacles that lay in his way, he summoned up all his courage, and determined to wait no longer. When, therefore, he entered Mr. Acehambur's presence, he showed a countenance more in sorrow than in anger, as we may well imagine; for he was so nervous that he did not know where to place hand or foot, and so uneasy that no chair in the room could hold him. At length with a faltering voice, he stammered out—</p>
               <p>"I came here, sir, to—to—to speak—to—to you, in relation to—in relation to Miss Ace—Acehambur."</p>
               <p>He could go no farther: many were the blunders he made; nor were they much bettered by his attempts to correct them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Acehambur kindly relieved him by giving him to understand that he knew what his errand was, and that he would think of it. Mr. Cameron was intoxicated with delight at the kind manner in which he had been received. His heart was bounding with joy as he once and again uttered Miss Alison's name, and that of the kindest of all parents, Mr. Acehambur.</p>
               <p>Having conferred with Alison, Mr. Acehambur called him in, and gave him to understand all that passed between him and Alison.</p>
               <p>The day of their marriage was now fixed<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC5589-00000099"/> upon. All being done to his satisfaction, Mr. Cameron was scarcely himself. He walked lordly about the room, uttering big words, saying that he was <emph>highly</emph> and <emph>most exceedingly</emph> pleased with the manner in which all things had been so <emph>duly</emph> and <emph>wisely</emph> arranged, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

               <head>STORY OF AGNES JACOB.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Taken from a Sketch of her Life, drawn up by her Intended, the Rev. Isaac Bransby, a short time before his Execution.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>"AGNES JACOB was born in Poland. Her father was a wealthy Jew: Her mother, however, though a professed Israelite, was at heart a Christian, having been brought up in a Christian family in Switzerland. The father<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC5589-00000100"/> took great pains to instruct his only child in the principles of the Jewish religion.</p>
               <p>His hatred to the Christian religion and his spite against the Nazarene knew no bounds. He delighted in teaching the infant lips of his child to curse him. The mother was far otherwise inclined, and secretly did all she could towards counteracting the father's influence over the mind of her child. She was at first very timid and apprehensive, lest the child should unconsciously betray her real sentiments. But as her mind began to expand itself, the mother's anxiety increased lest a wrong bias given to her thoughts at that tender age should fix her father's principles too firmly in her heart. In this dilemma, she fixed upon a plan, which she knew the father would highly approve, and which would, at the same time, eventually secure the end she had in view. Her scheme proposed thoroughly to ground the child in all the prophecies respecting the Great Deliverer who was to rescue the seed of Jacob from their present degraded condition. The father was highly gratified at what he considered ered her devotedness to his principles, and her desire to instil them into the mind of her child, while she, on the other hand, was equally pleased with the hope of turning the whole to a very different purpose. While endeavouring to cultivate the tender mind committed to her care, she found that her own soul was becoming more and more attached to the religion of Jesus Christ. She felt that the instruction imparted to the child became her own support and comfort. So true did she find the promise, "He that watereth others, shall be watered himself,' that her soul daily rejoiced in God her Saviour. At length, Agnes became her mother's confidant. The spirit of her dear mother found its way with the instructions conveyed into her heart. At this juncture a circumstance occurred which greatly relieved her anxieties. The father was called from home, and his absence, in consequence of various and unexpected changes in his projects, was prolonged, and he did not return for nearly eighteen months. During this interval, Agnes and her mother carefully read the four Gospels,<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC5589-00000101"/> and both determined, in the strength of God, to break their minds to Agnes's father, and come what would, to make a public profession of their faith in Jesus Christ. Upon a maturer consideration, however, knowing the pain that the disclosure would give him, they came to the determination of concealing all from him for the space of one month, and then to tell him the result of their inquiries and the conclusion to which their impartial examination of the prophecies had led them. On his return home, the father felt very unwell, in consequence of his having had a damp bed during his absence. Mrs. Jacob, however, did all she could to cheer and comfort him, and little Agnes was unremitting in her attention. Nor were they, both parent and child, less constant and earnest in their secret prayers on his behalf. In addition to his bodily weakness he had an unusual gloom, accompanied with great irritability of temper. This uneasiness was too settled, and accompanied with feelings of too melancholy a character, to be wholly accounted for by reason of his declining health.</p>
               <p>"It was now evident to all that knew him that he was in a rapid decline, and would not long survive. One day, while, labouring under his great exhaustion of spirit, he said, to his daughter:—</p>
               <p>"Agnes, my love, would you like to go to school? I have been thinking of a school, which is kept by a very dear friend of mine, whom I met in Switzerland during my absence from home. But perhaps you would not like to go to him, because he is a Christian. Not withstanding that, he is a very good man, and his wife an excellent lady. Would you like to go, love?"</p>
               <p>"Agnes, in consequence of being forewarned by her mother of her papa's craftiness, did not know what to say, and burst into tears. Seeing that her tears grieved her parent, she left the room to seek counsel of her mother. Having told her all that occurred, they did not know what to do; the one was as surprised and timid as the other: they were not, however ignorant of the way to the Searcher of all hearts, and to him they repaired to seek the<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC5589-00000102"/> direction necessary in this their time of need. Nor were they disappointed; for they rose from their knees, fully persuaded that God had heard their prayers on his behalf, and opened his heart to receive the truth as it is in Jesus. They now agreed that Agnes should enter the room first, and begin to tall of the school which he mentioned. When her mother was accidentally to come in and join their conversation. This plan at once succeeded in giving him an opportunity to open his mind, and to disclose the cause of his constant grief. Indeed, plans suggested while in prayer, and asking direction from God, never fail to accomplish the end we desire to secure. The attention paid by Mrs. Jacob and Agnes to what he said, encouraged him to disclose to them the source of his uneasiness. He began by telling them that on his journey he met with a Swiss gentleman who entered into a long argument with him on the evidence of the Christian religion.</p>
               <p>"'We travelled together," he said, 'for nearly four months, and I never saw him once out of temper during the whole time. I made it a point, for the first seven weeks, to provoke him to anger by cursing the Nazarene and his deluded followers. All this he bore with an unexampled patience. Every day seemed to heighten his piety and love. His whole demeanour was a decided proof that the more I annoyed him, the more earnest he appeared in endeavouring to overcome my prejudices. One evening, after I had abused him to my heart's content, and, concluded my ribaldry with calling him a credulous simpleton with a countenance full of anxiety, and an eye beaming with hope, notwithstanding all my hardness of heart and unbelief, he said to me:—</p>
               <p>"Mr, Jacob, I was once just such an one as yourself; I mean, as it respects my temper. Had you offered to me but ten years ago the thousandth part of the insult that I have quietly received from you for the last seven weeks, either you or myself would have been no more. But the religion which you so despise has wrought this mighty change within me. It<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC5589-00000103"/> has indeed changed the lion of sinful nature into an innocent lamb of Christ's flock.</p>
               <p>"I am, Mr. Jacob, a follower of the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world, the Nazarene whom you so often curse, forgetting that the mad prayer of your ancestors—"Let his blood be upon us and upon our children"—has made you what you really are, a monument of the Divine displeasure; but I earnestly hope, not yet irrecoverable lost. It is the thought that you are still within the reach of mercy, that has hitherto encouraged me to bear with, and pray for you, regardless of your contempt for me, believing that Christ is able to melt even your hard heart, and to subdue your stubborn spirit.'</p>
               <p>"Here Mr. Jacob burst into tears, his wife and child wept with him; their sympathy seemed to lighten his burden and encourage his heart. He then said, that that very night he most keenly felt that he too needed the change of which that man spoke.</p>
               <p>"'When I went to bed,' he continued, 'I began to reflect upon what had passed between us, and for the, first time in my life, I thought, of the power requisite to change my heart, or, the heart of my friend, which was, I believe really changed. Having always been taught to look for the promised Deliverer as a Conqueror, I thought that I had seen in my friend that night, the evidence of a conquest far more worthy of the Prince of Peace, promised in the Hebrew Scriptures, than any earthly achievement could have produced. Here was triumph over mind. And it flashed like lightning upon me, that the kingdom of this promised Messiah must be strictly spiritual in its nature, and that it is here that our great mistake as a nation was made. We mistake the nature of His Kingdom, and of the deliverance He came to effect. In addition to this, I have carefully read the New Testament, a copy of which he kindly gave me as a parting gift. '</p>
               <p>"Here he ordered Agnes to bring to him the small case that lay locked on his dressing-table. Having opened it, he took out the precious volume, and fervently kissed it, while the tears<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5589-00000104"/> coursed down his pale and sunken cheeks, exclaiming, in a transport of joy:—</p>
               <p>"'In this book I have found what none but God in Christ can give. Through its instrumentality, I have found that great deliverance which Jesus Christ came into the world to effect—a deliverance from sin, the enemy of my soul, and the possession of eternal life, which makes my present declining health appear to my soul, as it really is not worthy to be compared with the joy which awaits me; being made by God's grace to work for me a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Having sat up in bed during this transport of hallowed delight, when he uttered the word "glory,"—and that with an emphasis that seemed to contain too much sanctity to have fallen from earthly lips,—he fell back on the pillow, and without a groan, while the same holy smile remained on his countenance, his enraptured soul was carried by angels into his Saviour's bosom.</p>
               <p>"The joy and grief which pervaded the hearts of the widow and the orphan, at this moment, can never be expressed:—joy, because of the testimony that he <choice>
                     <sic>beqeathed</sic>
                     <corr>bequeathed</corr>
                  </choice> to them of his having been saved from eternal damnation, by the blood of Christ, and that, as they both firmly believed, in answer to their prayers:—grief, because he was taken from them when his life had become doubly dear to them, by the sweet promise his conversion held out of their increase of earthly joy and spiritual enjoyment, and that he was taken away before they could tell him that his Saviour was theirs likewise, and that they had prayed without ceasing for his conversion.</p>
               <p>"When all the respect that love could pay to his earthly remains had been shown, Mrs. Jacob became exceedingly low and dejected. Little Agnes, though still a child, had learned enough of God's word to enable her to comfort her dear mother in her present despondency. Often would she, with a child-like simplicity, and what was still better, a child-like confidence in her heavenly Father, direct her mother to seek comfort in that God who had already befriended them and answered their prayers, in saving the<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC5589-00000105"/> soul of the departed one, and who still promised to be the husband of the widow and the father of the fatherless. Such entire resignation manifested by the child, was a timely rebuke to the mother's murmuring spirit against God's providence. One day as they were reading together in the Gospel according to St. Matthew, they came to the Lord's Prayer, and as Mrs. Jacob read he words, 'Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us,' Agnes turned a mournful look on her mother, and said:—</p>
               <p>"'I think this will suit your case, mamma.'</p>
               <p>"'What do you mean, child?' rejoined the mother.</p>
               <p>"'Why,' continued Agnes, somewhat confused, 'I do not think, dear mamma, that you have forgiven God for taking away papa, though he took him to Heaven, where we shall meet him again.'</p>
               <p>"'Agnes, my dear child,' cried the mother, clasping the little one to her bosom, 'you have rescued your dear mother from this sinful course of rebelling against Heaven. I will murmur no more, but quietly submit to the correction of my heavenly Father. Oh,' she continued, pressing Agnes to her heart, 'how can I be grateful enough to God for giving me such a treasure in my beloved child! I have no will of my own now, I am quite willing to be led by my God, trusting that in the end we shall both arrive at our Father's house in peace.'</p>
               <p>"From this instant Mrs. Jacob became a cheerful and happy Christian. It is, indeed, when we are most child-like that we are most happy. Religion's ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are paths of peace.</p>
               <p>"Having settled their worldly affairs, both mother and child removed to Switzerland, in order to be among Christian friends, and to bid farewell for ever to their old Jewish acquaintance. On their arrival there, they were kindly received by the gentleman who was made the instrument of Mr. Jacob's conversion to Christianity. The letters which this worthy person had written to Mr. Jacob, he regarded as sacred credentials of their claim on his protection.<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC5589-00000106"/> Nor were these defenseless, innocent creatures disappointed in their hope of his continuing to be their protector and friend to the last. He devoted much of his time to their worldly affairs. Nor did he overlook their spiritual interests. He took the first opportunity of introducing them to his brother's family, who was the clergyman of the district in which their lot was now fixed. In this worthy clergyman, the mild and the stern were singularly blended. These rare qualities made him easy of access, while they imparted peculiar weight to his counsels. He was in every respect, the revered as well as the beloved pastor. He had seen much of the world, and had well profited by his experience.</p>
               <p>"The society of such a man was highly <choice>
                     <sic>advantages</sic>
                     <corr>advantageous</corr>
                  </choice> to Mrs. Jacob at this particular juncture. While opening her mind to him with freedom, she felt herself bound to follow his advice, however contrary that advice might be to her own less penetrating views. Nor was this connection less profitable for Agnes. It gave her an opportunity of improving her mind by associating with the well-instructed children of this new friend and counsellor. Agnes was placed with them in the school mentioned by her late father, and which was kept by this clergyman's brother's wife. Both mother and daughter were now in their element; they felt that they had all that their hearts could wish. All their past trials were forgotten in the enjoyment of the present. The present and the future smiled upon them. They deemed themselves the happiest beings upon the face of the earth. Their hearts overflowed with gratitude to that Being who brought them in safety to this happy place, and gave them such favour in the sight of His people. The school in which Mrs. Jacob had placed Agnes, was conducted according to the golden rules of our happy ancestors.</p>
               <p>"All the children got their lessons ready at home, and then went to the master or mistress, simply for the purpose of repeating them, and getting all the explanation requisite for their thoroughly understanding them, and for the greater facility in acquiring as well as comprehending<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC5589-00000107"/> what they learnt. In those happy days, our good and kind-hearted forefathers had no notion of cooping up their children for a whole day together, as if the tender creatures had been anything but objects of more than ordinary care. Such an arrangements gave Mrs. Jacob a peculiar advantage in bringing up her child after, what she considered, the best manner. It is impossible to conceive the happiness they constantly found in each other's society. There outward comforts and inward peace, turned their dwelling into a paradise, in which every innocent diversion of which nature is capable, had its time and place; where every hallowed enjoyment which religion is calculated to afford, was always founded; and in which the peace of God which passeth all understanding was the welcome guest whose presence sweetened all other things.</p>
               <p>"Agnes was by this time on the eve of womanhood, and her mother, of course, could not be insensible to her charms, nor was she as wrong in her conjectures, as some have doubtlessly often been, in thinking that all others are as much stuck with the charms of their children as they themselves are. This made her somewhat cautious, lest her fair flower should be blighted by the uncongenial atmosphere that some ungodly youth might bring with him to their hitherto tranquil abode. She made up her mind, therefore, to keep no company except that of the clergyman and his family, together with that of his brother and his family. Things rolled on much in the same easy way for several months longer, till at length their religious intercourse and worship were so disturbed, that they made up their minds to go together to England, and settle there till things would assume a more favourable aspect. Having arrived in this country they were quite at a loss where to fix their abode. They resolved, however, not to settle till they should find a place exactly suitable to the object they had in view. For this purpose they went through all England, Scotland, and Ireland. The result of their tour was anything but satisfactory They were, therefore, on the point of emigrating to America, and form a<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC5589-00000108"/> colony of their own. While they were still wavering, they were told of a small estate on the borders of Wales, which was to be disposed of as soon as possible. This gave them an opportunity of making a new excursion. The place was all they wanted, and though in the Principality, the English language, of which they were complete masters, was chiefly spoken by the inhabitants. Mrs. Jacob, by the advice of her friends, bought the whole estate, and had an immediate possession. Being so few in number, they had at first all things in common, until a better arrangement could be made. The old mansion, where nothing but the sound of revelry had been heard, was now filled with the voice of praise and thanksgiving. The formal manner in which things were conducted in the parish church, disgusted then, and the immorality of the priest, made them tremble for the safety of true religion. For awhile they worshipped together after their own custom, having selected one of the rooms in the old mansion for that purpose. Several of the neighbours being led there, perhaps at first from curiosity, at length, became constant in their attendance. This compelled them to remove to a larger room. They now felt that their prospect of being useful among the inhabitants would fully justify an attempt to erect a small meeting-house for the accommodation of their increased number. This plan being executed, the little Tabernacle, for so it was named, was publicly dedicated to God in a solemn and appropriate manner, by making that day a season of general rejoicing and thanksgiving among the few interested in the completion of the work. The happiness of Mrs. Jacob and her venerable friend, the old clergyman, was boundless. They felt satisfied that their settling there was of the Lord. There were other reasons, also, why they should congratulate each other on the happy issue of their wanderings, namely, the love that existed between young Isaac Bransby, the only son of the old pastor, and the youthful Agnes. This was an event for which both parents had long wished and prayed. How mysterious the ways of Providence! Under<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC5589-00000109"/> these auspicious circumstances commenced that love, whose tragical end we have already noticed."</p>

               <p>ONE evening as Mr. Cameron was returning from C——, with his head full of projects, and his imagination conjuring up images too ethereal in their nature to be inherited by flesh and blood, he was suddenly attacked by a short, strong, and muscular man, who peremptorily<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC5589-00000110"/> demanded all that he had, or else—dropping his voice as he uttered the last word, and taking out of his pocket a large pistol. Startled by this discovery, Cameron rushed upon him, and a severe contest ensued. They both fell together. Cameron, however, from his superior knowledge of the place succeeded in pushing his opponent into a large ditch that lay at the side of the road. This being done, he hastened to recover his club, but was soon reminded of his folly by a heavy blow inflicted by the innocent weapon which, dexterously wielded by his antagonist, sent him reeling to the ground. While thus gasping for breath, he accidentally laid his hand on the pistol, which had been lost during the first struggle. Conscious of this advantage, he sprang upon his feet, seized the robber, and pointing the fatal instrument to his head, threatened his destruction. Seeing that resistance was useless, the threatening voice of the assailant was changed into the suing whine of the suppliant. But Cameron would not allow him to kneel down, nor implore his forgiveness asserting that he had no right to pardon don him, that he had put himself in the grasp of the law;, that he must take him into the first house that could be founds and there remain with him till information should be given to the next magistrate, who would see that justice should be done to him.</p>
               <p>Whether Cameron intended all that he said is uncertain; for he afterwards promised, should he confess the truth and give him a full account of himself, to conceal his name and let him go. No sooner had he begun to speak in his natural tone of voice, than the hitherto unrelenting Cameron threw away the pistol, and folded him in his arms. The convulsive and half-fainting offender cried out, "Mas—Master Cameron!" Cameron could not say a word; but assured him of his forgiveness by pressing him the more closely to his bosom, whose heaving could not be mistaken for an affectionate tenderness than effectually declared what the most eloquent language would have failed to express.</p>
               <p>Having given vent to his feelings, in a flood of tears, which fell copiously upon the cheek of<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC5589-00000111"/> the suppliant, as if they would wash away the stain imprinted on his guilty brow by this ungenerous act, Mr. Cameron said, in a voice that might have inspired confidence in the most timid mind:</p>
               <p>"O Sandford, Sandford! where will thy follies end? What will become of you?"</p>
               <p>Here Sandford interrupted him, sobbing aloud, and declaring that he would not rise without the assurance of his forgiveness. Mr. Cameron saw the feeble light of a lantern gradually approaching them, and hastily said to his humble suppliant:—</p>
               <p>"I do forgive thee; here are our servants coming to seek for me; go to the next inn, you will find one about a mile from here, and meet me again in this place to-morrow evening, at seven o'clock."</p>
               <p>"I cannot go to an inn," replied Sandford timidly, "I have no money."</p>
               <p>"Take this, then, and be off," said Cameron, as he placed a guinea in his hand.</p>
               <p>The light was now hard by. He saw Sandford taking to his heels with the speed of youth. He hesitated for a moment whether he should discover or conceal himself:—the next he was over the hedge in the field, observing with satisfaction that the three nocturnal intruders were three ruffians, by no means proverbial for their honesty, whose salutation he felt happy to avoid.</p>
               <p>The following morning Cameron rose earlier than usual, and bent his way towards the residence of a particular friend of his, whom he knew wanted a clerk in one of his offices, and he thought that such a situation would be all that his friend could wish. Having secured the place, he returned home with a heart bounding with joy at the idea of his being made the means to recover his friend from the vortex of shame and infamy into which he already seemed so deeply sunk.</p>
               <p>William Sandford had been at the place of the previous evening's contest for a considerable time before Cameron made his appearance. Had he any feelings, the stillness of the scene so fraught with painful recollections, might have thrown him into a train of reflections that<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC5589-00000112"/> would have produced the most salutary effects upon his mind, But to be serious and to reflect were both alike unknown to him. And if he believed in a state of future retribution,—of reward for the righteous, and punishment for the wicked, it was because he could not fix his mind upon the subject long enough to disbelieve it.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Cameron appeared, he hardly knew how to address him. This awkward task, however, was dispensed with by the frankness of his friend's salutation. He at once told him of the excellent situation he had obtained for him, and, gave him a brief account of his adventures since they had seen each other before. He went over all the trifles that contributed to form his intimacy with Alison and the delightful prospects that lay before him, with a lover's speed and a lover's zest.</p>
               <p>The latter clause of this narration, however, did not produce such an effect upon his friend's mind as he could have expected, Not so the former part. All that related to the <emph>excellent situation</emph> went down with infinite relish. The very mention of it had thrown him into ecstacy, and perhaps, to do him justice, for once in his whole life, into a reverie; for we cannot suppose that, otherwise, he could be so brutal as not to show, if not in reality, at least in appearance, some regard to his friend's feelings. But he appeared somehow altogether as an enigma in creation, and a mystery in Providence. Two persons more unlike could not have been thrown together. The one was as much distinguished for selfishness as the other was for generosity. The love of the one, if he had any, had never roamed from home—never tasted the pleasures of <choice>
                     <sic>benefittings</sic>
                     <corr>benefitting</corr>
                  </choice> others—was an ignorant captive that knew nothing beyond the precincts of the self in which it was imprisoned. The love that dilated the bosom of the other knew what it was to do to others as he wished that they should do to him—what was a life filled up with usefulness and wholly consecrated to the good of others—what an immense augmentation happiness receives by communication—with what revenue a little sympathy given to others returns—and what<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5589-00000113"/> a harvest of delight the seeds scattered by the benevolent will certainly yield.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cameron, willing to put the best construction upon his conduct, attributed his unusual silence to a reluctance to revert to the ungrateful manner in which he had treated his former kindness; for he had been more than once before laid under great obligations to him.</p>
               <p>The next day Mr. Cameron introduced him to his new employer, who seemed mightily pleased with his intelligent and lively appearance. While he was thus paying a thousand little attentions to his friend, such as true friendship alone can suggest, the letter-bag belonging to Mr. W.'s Works was dropped in by the postman. To have a glance at the newspapers, with which the table was almost instantaneously covered, was an opportunity too seasonable to be neglected by young Cameron. The first paper that he took up contained the following account:—"THE DEATH OF BRUCE CAMERON, Esq.—THIS WORTHY GENTLEMAN CLOSED HIS LONG AND USEFUL LIFE ON MONDAY EVENING LAST. HIS SEVERE ILLNESS WAS BORNE WITH FORTITUDE AND RESIGNATION. His property will, of course, descend to his only son, Archibald Cameron. This whimsical, though clever youth, we regret to say, has but little of the father about him. A few months ago, he suddenly disappeared, and has not yet been discovered."</p>
               <p>The paper fell from his hand as if it had been paralyzed. He turned pale, trembled, and fell helplessly into his friend's arms.</p>
               <p>"Archibald, dear Archibald," exclaimed Sandford, "what is the matter?"</p>
               <p>"My father, my father," uttered Cameron faintly.</p>
               <p>"Your father! and what of him?"</p>
               <p>Cameron thoughtfully looked at the paper again.</p>
               <p>Sandford seized it, and read—"The death of ——. We understand that his property is bequeathed to his son, Archibald Cameron."</p>
               <p>"Bravo! Confound me, Archibald, you are a gentleman. Are you sorry for it? What ails you? I wish I had a father that would<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC5589-00000114"/> die and leave me such a fortune. Cheer up, my good fellow. You have no need to mar your joy by affecting sorrow before me."</p>
               <p>Cameron gave him such a look as he could not fail to understand.</p>
               <p>"I only meant," said he, dropping his voice, "to comfort you."</p>
               <p>"Comfort me!" continued Cameron, emphatically. "You are trifling with my best feelings, William; I cannot bear your selfishness. Death in one's family is not a thing to be trifled with. There is a voice in it that sooner or later must be listened to. The shadows of long evening will soon be gathering around us; and even now, strong and healthy as we are, the shadows of death are upon our eyelids, consequently the substance cannot be afar off. Nay, death itself is working in us, for what is man but the working-house of death? The seeds of mortality are thickly sown in our very nature, and the clouds of pestilence and disease have not failed to water them, and make them grow. All things seem in confederacy with death, leagued against man, and determined to achieve the triumph of mortality."</p>
               <p>"Upon my word, Archibald, I think you would make a better parson than half those that enter the <emph>wooden cage</emph>, and affect the learned and the pious in a black gown. Do not you think so?"</p>
               <p>"William, I am serious: the subject that we are talking about is not to be ridiculed. Our after-life will take its complexion from the attention that we give to it. Death has become the destiny of all living, and since it does not effect any change in the character relative to that Holy Being into whose presence it ushers, it is of the greatest moment that we should understand the relation in which we stand to God as subjects of his moral government, for it is the great repository that contains the destinies of eternity. It is here that the worm that never dies is nourished, and the spark that shall become an unquenchable fire is kept alive; or that principle which conducts the soul homeward is deposited, and the pure flame that consumes its corruption is fanned by the conflicting<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC5589-00000115"/> ing nature of the very materials that come in contact with its operation. No sooner, dear William, is the mysterious link that binds together the material and thinking parts of our nature, dissolved, than the unclothed spirit becomes conscious of the relationship existing between it and its Maker. It is then that it perceives on the one hand what might have been the glorious rewards of a faithful discharge of the duties arising from such a near relation to God, and on the other hand, what will be the doom of the unfaithful and the traitor, under the government of that righteous Being, who will not justify the wicked."</p>
               <p>"Well, Archibald, I do not see any reason why people so young as we are, should deprive ourselves of the vivacity of youth, and the enjoyments, which, if now lost, manhood cannot restore. Let us rather enjoy the present than trouble ourselves with the uncertain future."</p>
               <p>"Ah! my dear William, you are mistaken: there is no enjoyment like that of religion. Her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are paths of peace. Now is the best period to prepare for futurity. It would be a sad thing to be cut from time without the soul being laden with the riches current in eternity. Think, dear friend, of the agitated state into which the unprepared is thrown, by, alas! the too late discovery of his folly, which will awake the worm never to sleep again; and oh! who can conceive the horrors that seize upon the lost spirit, when it finds itself surrounded by the sublime scenes of eternity, and that infinitude of woe of which it thought too little here on earth, exposing to its view those various stages of damnation through which it will have to pass, till all the misery that the present hell contains, can be lodged in its own bosom."</p>
               <p>"O, Archibald! do not dwell on these melancholy scenes; you terrify me; nor do you, yourself, seem proof against the terror attendant upon such horrible thoughts."</p>
               <p>"I do confess that I am perhaps too much disposed to indulge in these gloomy reveries; but it is well to be terrified from the evil, that we may the more closely adhere to the good."</p>
               <p>"This may be all very well; but you told<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC5589-00000116"/> me just now, that the ways of religion are ways of pleasantness, and that all her paths are paths of peace. You now seem to say, that it is well to embitter the sweets of the present by always thinking of a horrible future, into which, despite ourselves, we must enter."</p>
               <p>"You misunderstand me; we widely differ in our notions of happiness. You think no bliss can be found apart from worldly pleasures; I think that such baubles can afford no enjoyment to those that have arisen from the grovelling ideas that bind the horizon of the ignorant to the high and noble pursuits that expand the capacities and clear the vision of the wise. I am fully persuaded that no man who has ever tasted the exquisite delights of a religious life, can derive the least enjoyment from the vain show of worldly pleasures."</p>
               <p>"You speak now like a man; you seem to read my mind in my face. This is the great point that I dislike in religion, that the moment we become professed Christians every comfort is lost, peace and happiness forfeited, and pain, sorrow, and pensive moroseness, supplant the few charms that fair nature is destined to yield. As for myself, I am one of the <emph>Pauline party</emph>, Archibald. Let us eat and drink, and be merry, for to-morrow we die. What think you of that, eh?"</p>
               <p>Before Mr. Cameron could reply to this misconstrued eulogium on his own statement, or remind him of his scriptural inaccuracy, the conveyance was standing at the door ready to receive them. They both entered, and in a few minutes were on the high road to Fairview Cottage.</p>

               <p>THE coach stopped before Mr. Acehambur's door. Miss Alison had, for some time, been walking in the pleasure-grounds, watching the progress of the vehicle that lessened the distance between her and her faithful lover. She had now repaired into the front parlour, and was breathlessly expecting the first glimpse of her beloved Archibald. He descended from the carriage, but he was accompanied with a stranger whom she had never, as she thought seen before. She was disappointed—withdrew from the window—and when they entered the parlour she was busily engaged in reading a small volume that lay on her lap. Mr. Cameron introduced Sandford to her as a friend of his. Sandford, was now more in his element than when conversing with his <emph>he</emph> friend alone. He regained his usual loquacity, for he was quite at home in the <emph>small talk</emph> line. Alison could not divine what to make of him. His conversation was so frivolous and pointless that she was quite jaded by it. He had, however, but her ear. Her heart was with Cameron. She observed with pain his forced smile, his uneasiness, and the mournful look of his countenance. She could hold no longer, apologized for leaving the room, and by a significant glance at her beloved Archibald, bade him follow. Sitting by his side, and tenderly pressing his hand between both hers, she anxiously looked in his face. Observing his contracted brow and pensive appearance, she burst into tears, exclaiming:—</p>
               <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC5589-00000118"/>
               <p>"Has poor Alison offended you in anything, dear Archibald?"</p>
               <p>He looked at her with a tenderness that a female's love can never fail to understand.</p>
               <p>"Beloved Archibald, forgive me! You still love poor Alison; yes, you still love me. Do you not? O yes; I know you do."</p>
               <p>"Unequalled Alison," cried Archibald; "we must part for—"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, never, never!" throwing herself on his bosom.</p>
               <p>"Listen to me, and be calm, will you?"</p>
               <p>She rose and stalked proudly towards the door. Her limbs could hold their weight no longer, and she fell senseless on the floor. Cameron, half maddened with himself, lifted her light frame in his arms. He bathed her beautiful features with burning tears, that copiously flowed from the fiery fountain of devoted affection. When she revived, she said, with a sorrowful countenance and a still more sorrowful tone of voice—</p>
               <p>"Now, I am prepared; speak what you have to communicate to me; yes, I am prepared for the worst."</p>
               <p>"Do not speak so, dear Alison. You evidently anticipate what I hope will never occur. I saw in the paper this morning that my dear father is dead, and that all his property will, as a matter of course, come to me, so that I must forthwith proceed to lay claim to it."</p>
               <p>"Thank Heaven, that things are not worse! I had some vague apprehensions even before I rose this morning, that our dream of happiness will never be realised and soon after you left, as I was walking in the garden, a small mouse ran quite along your favourite walk to meet me, and, horrible to relate, the dumb creature actually stared me in the face, and did not seem in the least terrified. How shall I survive your departure? I shall break my heart." And placing her beautiful head on his arm, she fondly gazed on his fine, intelligent countenance.</p>
               <p>The rest of the day was spent in the necessary preparation for his departure. This gave them some relief from the necessity of having<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC5589-00000119"/> their minds constantly riveted to the approaching trial of parting from each other. Though they were anxious to put the evil hour as far from them as possible, yet neither could for the world refrain from speaking of it, and even though professing to be full of hope, hazard some vague hints of the mournful possibility of their never meeting again in this vale of tears. To pretend to brave what we most dread, is natural to our present state. What we are most careful to avoid, is invariably uppermost in our thoughts. The little boy, to whom his father had promised a horse if he could repeat the Lord's Prayer without thinking of it, and who, when in the middle of the ordeal, suddenly stopped, and cried out, "Father, shall I have the saddle too?" is a fair specimen of human nature's incapacity to ward off at will the chief object either of dread or of desire. This was exactly the case with these lovers. So overwhelming was its influence on their mind, that they at length sought to relieve their sorrow by conversing on the very subject that produced it. They once and again, with streaming eyes and palpitating hearts, gave expression to their fears lest something should occur to prevent their anticipated union. Mr. Cameron felt that it became his duty to assume the man, the counsellor, and the comforter, seeing that he was on the point of being divested, for a while at least, of the power of being her protector. He tried to soothe her sorrow and comfort her heart, by expatiating on her remaining comforts, her father's care and protection, the likelihood of his speedy return, and the consummation of their projected marriage; and, above all, he endeavoured to direct her to seek comfort from God, the fountain of all happiness, Who was perfectly acquainted with the complexion of every day of their lives, and Who, in answer to prayer, could make all things work together for the realization of their most sanguine expectations. Then they knelt down together, and earnestly supplicated the aid of their Heavenly Father in their present time of need. Thus did these lovely young Christians roll their burden upon the Lord, and He, according to His promise<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC5589-00000120"/> mise, strengthened their hearts, by imparting a new vigour to their wavering confidence in His fatherly care. They rose from their knees, as they themselves testified, much refreshed and comforted. They embraced each other with less palpitating hearts, feeling a renewed confidence as to the issue of the much-dreaded journey. It was remarkable with what calmness they could now talk of what concerned their present situation. Alison said that she never felt so happy as when her faith triumphed over the misgivings attendant on the vicissitudes of life.</p>
               <p>"Yes," rejoined Mr. Cameron, "and there is no time in which our confidence in God seems so precious as when thus enveloped in the darkness by which all finite beings are surrounded with respect to futurity. As for myself, I never feel so happy as when conscious of my utter helplessness. I cling to my Heavenly Father with the simplicity of a child, like the infant that hides its face from danger in its mother's bosom."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dearest Archibald," exclaimed Alison, "and yet there are some people, and even Christians too, that would think any one that would thus speak of God's fatherly goodness as very simple and soft. I suppose these overgrown disciples, had they been with our Saviour at Bethany, would have thought him somewhat too tender in sympathizing so much with the bereaved sisters. My soul always things to Him with greater tenacity when I think of is compassion for the weaker vessels. Had he felt towards them as some unfeeling wretches do, would have never thought of his mother, when dying upon the cross, neither would he have given her in charge to the beloved John, more than to any of the other disciples, had he not known that he was most like Himself, and would take a good care of her. O how I like the character of John. He is so loving—indeed, he scarcely writes about anything else. He is so like you, dear. If you had lived in Christ's time you would have been such a favourite with Him, I am sure."</p>
               <p>The degree of ardour and delight manifested<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC5589-00000121"/> in the manner in which these words were uttered, quite astonished Mr. Cameron. He had never before heard her speak with such freedom and ease. She was naturally of a timid and reserved disposition. He ever before regarded her as a strange anomaly in the history of her sex. What, therefore, must have been his amazement at perceiving his mistake! And who can conceive his delight at finding such a noble intellect concealed under the feminine and modest appearance of his own dear Alison? Anxious to give her a full scope on the subject, he remarked, that he thought such a disregard to the manifestation of feeling in religious concerns could only arise from spiritual pride and vain-glory.</p>
               <p>"Yes," continued Alison, "those who seek by prayer and supplication to be assimilated in all things to the High Priest of their profession—whose heart is made of tenderness—are derided by the <emph>would-be intellectual</emph> Christians, who would have religion adorned by the trappings of earthly wisdom, so as to conceal its real simplicity. How like Christ the conduct of the former! How unlike Him that of the latter! How humble the one, how presumptuous the other! Can earth beautify heaven—corruption adorn purity—mortality honour immortality—the speck of time magnify the immensity of eternity—the creature pretend to better the means that the Creator himself has declared perfect? We should naturally suppose that the blind should be willing to be led by Him that sees—the fallible to be directed by the Infallible—the ignorant to be instructed by the All-wise. With man in his natural state it is, however, far otherwise. His mind has ever been more captivated by fiction than by truth; by the momentary sight of phantom, than by the grand appearance of reality. Hence it is, that every fiction that has ever laid a stronghold on human belief, is the mistaken image of some great truth—the stream by which the fountain may be traced. Now the proper use of this clue, I look upon as consisting in spiritual humility or implicit reliance on the teaching of the Divine Spirit; for He helpeth our infirmities. And Jesus Christ thanked<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC5589-00000122"/> his Father for having revealed unto babes what was beyond the reach of the wisest of the wise in their own eyes."</p>
               <p>"Well done, Alison," cried Archibald, "I perfectly agree with you? But how is it, my dear, that you have never opened your mind thus to me before? You are really clever, dear."</p>
               <p>"Why," replied Alison, full of confusion and awkwardness, "I have never had courage enough to throw off my natural reservedness, even with you, though I love you as my own soul, much less with any other, before. I am very sorry to have done so. I hope you will forgive me, love."</p>
               <p>"Forgive you, my own dear Alison? I love you more than ever now. I have always thought you the best of your sex. It shall now be my pride as well as my joy to think you the most intellectual of womankind."</p>
               <p>"But O this horrid thought that we are to part, dear Archibald, comes again, like the ghost of my previous sorrow, and seems as if threatening to erase from the tablets of one's heart this sunniest of hours. In it I have, for the first time in my life, overcome my natural infirmity—that is, the aversion I have to hear my own voice. What makes this conquest still more sacred is, that it was achieved under the sweet influence of the idol of my heart."</p>
               <p>Here their sweet converse was interrupted by the return of Mr. Acehambur from town.</p>

               <p>MR. ACEHAMBUR always made his daughter retire to rest at half-past nine o'clock. He and Mr. Cameron generally sought repose at ten, having spent half an hour together in familiar intercourse on the various occurrences of the day. It was while thus alone with each other that these faithful friends were accustomed to give vent to the most hidden thoughts of their hearts. Their joys and fears were joint-stock. What the one experienced, the other felt it a privilege to share. And now, both regretted that they should be called to part from each other so suddenly. Though, as men, they were sorry such was the case, yet they were Christians enough to acquiesce in the ways of Providence, knowing that the God of Providence was their chief and best friend.</p>
               <p>'Well, my boy," said Mr. Acehambur to Archibald, (for he was in the habit of calling him so), observing his anxieties about Alison, "you are in the path of duty, and you can with confidence depend on God's power to protect you. It is when we make ways for ourselves, that we are left to reap the fruit of our own doings. But when we walk in His ways, we are under His protection and guidance. As for poor Alison, I know it will be a great blow to her, and will, I have no doubt, be felt by yourself. Indeed, I feel more myself than I should, perhaps, at my time of life. The circumstances under which we became acquainted with each other, the providential deliverance of my dear child through your instrumentality, the frequency of our intercourse with one<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC5589-00000124"/> another, the similarity of our views, and the lack of society in this strange place: All these, together with some others, make me very melancholy at the thought of your departure."</p>
               <p>Poor Cameron thought of Sandford, and yet half feared to mention his name. He knew Alison was safe; that all his villainy could do her no harm; that her purity was that of the heavens, which the corruption of earth cannot affect. He thought of the shortness of his absence, and blushed at his own narrowness of soul in thinking so ill of an old playfellow. He thought again that his introduction to them might be the means of his conversion. At any rate, it can do no harm, he faintly whispered to himself, and may be the means of great good. He then said aloud to Mr. Acehambur, "As for society, it providentially happens, that a friend of mine has just come to reside for a while, at least, in the neighbourhood, and whom I have already introduced to Alison. He will, I am confident, do all that he can to comfort you, for my sake; and I feel assured that you will show kindness to him for the same reason."</p>
               <p>"Of that, indeed, you may feel assured, for anything that I can do, to oblige your friend, shall be done; and should you prefer his living under this roof, till your return, he is welcome."</p>
               <p>"No, I have no particular wish for that, as he is, I think, in lodgings belonging to the situation he holds. Nor do I think his habits would very well comport with your retired mode of life. It were also desirable, were he a little more inclined to what is serious and profitable. But you can act according to your own discretion, when you have seen more of him; and I sincerely hope your godly conversation will be productive of great good to him."</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear boy, by the time you return, as I hope God will grant you a safe and prosperous journey, we shall have known something more of your friend. At the same time, you may take my word, that he will receive a good treatment under this roof. Old Acehambur<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC5589-00000125"/> hambur was never yet complained of on that score."</p>
               <p>"No, I am sure, Mr. Acehambur, none will ever have an occasion to brand you with inhospitality. Indeed, I myself am a living witness of the truth of your assertion."</p>
               <p>"Yes, boy, to you I am something more than kin, and not less than kind. Really, how very strange that I should express myself in this way now, seeing 'tis more than forty years since I read a line in Shakspeare. The memory of an old man is such an oddity. As life ebbs, the things that were first treasured in the memory and then forgotten, come to sight last. Hence old age may with propriety be said to be a second childhood. If ever you should live to be as old as I am, you will probably think of what I am saying. Do all the good that you can now, while young, so that you will have nothing of a painful character to mar your latter days. It were indeed a pleasure to die, if one could divert himself of all the cares and anxieties of this life. Had we something like an adequate conception of our destiny as the children dren of God, how willing we should be to leave this our earthly residence for a more select society, and a more a gorgeous apartment in the real palace of our Heavenly Father. Instead of this, it too often happens that the love of life increases with the loss of it. It seems as if at length one had grown fond of the miseries of which life is made up; for life and trouble are synonymous terms. But, really, I am lecturing you instead of attempting to give a more direct counsel to you respecting your journey and the management of your affairs. You will, I know, forgive the liberty that age generally takes with youth."</p>
               <p>"Pray, sir," interrupted Cameron, "proceed; I am quite delighted with your remarks, and I hope I shall profit by them, though it is seldom the case to see people profit by the experience of others. In nothing, it appears to me, does the stupidity of man stand forth more conspicuous than in the rejection of proffered counsel, an aptness and desire to impart which, nature has, for the wisest ends, so abundantly bestowed upon the old. But, I suppose, while<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC5589-00000126"/> is bound in the heart of a child, this will always be the case. There is great aptness in a frequent saying of yours on this subject, which, perhaps, you remember."</p>
               <p>"No, I don't. The fact is, I have so many odd sayings, that I sometimes forget them."</p>
               <p>"It is something to this effect:—'that experience is a very dear school; but that fools will learn in no other.' Do you remember it now?"</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha! Yes, I do; is it not very strange, now, that things of this sort should so soon be forgotten? If you had not told me that it was mine, I should have never known it; though I scarcely think others would have mistaken it for mine. It is not likely others would have misfathered it; though one's self, when getting old, like Isaac, often fails to see with clearness, and, consequently, becomes doubtful of his own offspring. I am glad, however, that you remember it; and I sincerely hope, my dear boy, you will profit by it. I have given you as much as I possibly could of my own poor experience on almost every subject, and I feel somewhat confident as to the issue; for I do not think you are in the habit of letting things pass unimproved. I hope to descend to the grave in peace, leaving my dear child under the protection of one in whom I have the most entire confidence."</p>
               <p>"I am sure," rejoined Cameron, "I feel greatly <choice>
                     <sic>flatterd</sic>
                     <corr>flattered</corr>
                  </choice> by such a compliment, and especially as it comes from one so shrewd and sagacious as yourself, though I know that I little deserve it. According to the best of my abilities, however, your most sanguine expectations will not be unrealized. Nothing could exceed the joy that would thrill this heart, were it to feel conscious of its becoming more and more worthy of dear Alison. The integrity of my intention none, it appears to me, can rationally question. That she is indispensable to my happiness, my heart has not failed, once and again, to tell me. Indeed, the more near the period to leave her comes, the nearer she goes to my heart. My attachment to yourself, also, instead of diminishing, is vastly augmented. I now feel the truth of what you have<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC5589-00000127"/> often told me, that we know not the real value of our friends till we loose them."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my young friend, I never knew the value of my dear wife till she was gone beyond my reach. Her untold worth becomes more conspicuous every day. The few defects, of which I thought her possessed, while sojourning with me in this world, are quite eclipsed by her shining virtues. It seems the office of death to take our friends from us, only with respect to what is mortal of them, while what is spiritual and pure, it gives over exclusively to our affections. Thus our gracious Lord, in all his dealings towards us, always leaves a blessing behind Him. The moment our friends die, all their frailties at once sink into the shade of forgetfulness, while all that is noble and pure stands forth shining with increasing lustre, and like the pillar that led <choice>
                     <sic>Isreal</sic>
                     <corr>Israel</corr>
                  </choice> through the wilderness, alluring us on in the path of virtue and holiness, in which they trod. I thought, when my dear wife was alive, that I was doing all that was requisite to make her happy. But, alas! I now see so many things wherein I was far too negligent. So it is with life in general; we never realize our mission in this world till we are quitting it. It is, when too late to repent, that most men begin to think seriously of its necessity, like the Egyptians, who never thought of pausing, to consider what they were about, till the waters of the Red Sea brought their folly before their eyes, when too late to seek for wisdom."</p>
               <p>"What! so late?" said Mr. Acehambur, as he heard the clock strike. "Well, my boy, we must to bed now, or we cannot be stirring at our usual hour in the morning. Good night, God bless you."</p>
               <p>"And you, too, and may your repose be sweet," rejoined Cameron.</p>

               <p>THE first streak of the east, the herald of the much-dreaded day, found the two lovers eagerly watching with palpitating hearts, what each feared to encounter, and yet burned to enjoy—each other's society. Nothing could exceed the confusion and awkwardness with which everything was managed that morning. Poor Alison was quite ashamed of herself, and yet could not help being any one but herself. That she was not her former self was evident to every one; nor was she herself, as far as she was herself unconscious of it. The old gentleman, her father, also, seemed to have been re-cast since the preceding day. He appeared more of a boy than of a sage. He could not utter a syllable without the whine of a schoolboy. The furrows which age had left on his antique visage, were lost in the pucking and mewling of second childhood. Not a trace of his usual jovial manner could be discerned. His heart was too full to speak—his eyes too full of tears to see—and his aged limbs too full of trembling to support him. During sleep he had dreamt that Alison, Archibald, and himself were at sea. The vessel in which they were sailing seemed old and leaky, and bore upon her stern, written in large characters, <hi rend="i"/>Providence. The evening they left the port was one of the calmest that could possibly be imagined; the sails were up for a while, and seemed like a dying person gasping for breath, but finding none; they were taken down, apparently quite<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5589-00000129"/> dead and useless. The sailors lounged to and fro on the deck; everything was painfully quiet; the two lovers were, as the etiquette of nature dictates on such occasions, by themselves, gazing more on each other than on surrounding objects. The old gentleman conversed with the captain of the ship; asked him whether he thought they would be favoured with a fair passage, &amp;c. The sailors, guessing he was nervous, began to talk loudly among themselves, throwing out mysterious hints, shaking their heads: and one that seemed more waggish than the rest, went so far as to predict that the capful of wind which was then coming, would end in a freshish gale, but that <emph>old Providence</emph>, he feared, was not so well prepared for such a smartish tug as he thought she would have with that rascally young tempest that was beginning to show itself. This made the old gentleman tremble. Turning to the captain, he said, with great deal of gravity:—</p>
               <p>"Do you think, sir, that we shall have a storm?"</p>
               <p>Instead of answering him, this gentleman seemed all of a sudden lost in thought, and looking anxiously about, as for something he was afraid to find, he shook his head, and called out loudly to the hands to bestir themselves, that he feared they would have enough to do that night. Frightened by this announcement, he sought Mr. Cameron and Miss Alison, whom he found quite happy in each other's society. Finding him trembling with fear, they tried to comfort him, and advised him to go to bed, that he had no need to be so alarmed.</p>
               <p>Having seen him safely berthed, Alison returned on deck to bid Mr. Cameron good night a second time. About one o'clock in the morning Mr. Acehambur was awakened by the rolling of the ship, and an unusual stir on deck. He jumped out of his berth, and in the excitement of the moment, dressed himself with the quickness that he used to dress when young. On his attempting to leave the cabin, he was completely drenched by the rushing in of the waves. The storm became more and more<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC5589-00000130"/> furious. The vessel was now, as with one leap, gaining the summit of a mountainous surge; then, with an inconceivable rapidity, she would plunge into the deep as if never to rise again, and anon she seemed as if still in the agonies of death-helpless in the extreme. When able to breathe, he lifted up his eyes. The whole heaven seemed overcast with a lurid cloud, which appeared to emit innumerable streaks of the most unnatural hue. The vessel began to roll again tremendously. Every man that understood how to work was at his post. The waves broke in again with an additional fury. Despair sat on every countenance, and its offspring, horror, flashed from every eye. The women shrieked, and fled to the men for protection. But vain was the help of man. He could not save the ship that seemed to tremble within the jaws of death. He tried to make his way towards Cameron and his daughter. Seeing his fruitless efforts, Mr. Cameron left her under the care of another gentleman, pushed his way as well as he could towards the place where he stood convulsed with fear. Alas, while almost within reach, he and two or three others, were swept in an instant overboard into the deep. The shrieks of poor Alison imparted a momentary strength to his feeble frame, and before he had time to think of the recklessness of the attempt, they were in each other's arms.</p>
               <p>On waking Mr. Acehambur found himself in the greatest excitement. His bodily exhaustion plainly showed the intimate connection that exists between body and mind; and how the sufferings of the one affect the other. Some men affect to disbelieve dreams. But I very much doubt whether any well-balanced mind, could have regarded such a vivid dream with indifference. And when they forewarn us of approaching calamities, which by timely caution may be avoided, they assume the character of messengers sent from God. Such dreams are among the most extraordinary of the extraordinary occurrence of life. They show the regard that the Great Parent Spirit has for the welfare of His wayward children upon earth.</p>
               <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC5589-00000131"/>
               <p>Breakfast and family prayer being over, the two lovers hastened to their usual place of meeting in order to fortify each other's mind for the agonizing moment of parting. Every argument that piety, love, and the certainty of meeting in heaven—provided they were never permitted to meet upon earth—could suggest, was advanced. Long and fervid were the prayers they offered up for strength to meet their fate, and most hallowed was the communion they held with God and each other. Rising from their knees, with strength adequate for the occasion, they parted with each other with all the serenity of mind that an implicit faith in God's wisdom and goodness imparts. The old gentleman, too, when the moment of parting arrived, conducted himself in a manner worth of his profession and unshrinking confidence in God's Providence. This was not the first time for him to find the Friend that loveth at all times, the strength of the lonely, and the succour of him that hath no helper. At the same time, it must be confessed, to lose Mr. Cameron, must have been a great trial to him for nothing can be more grateful to old age than to have some kind and strong arm to lean upon while entering the valley of the shadow of death. Hence it is that the Patriarchs considered it such a glory to die in the bosom of their families, surrounded with their numerous offspring. The Hon. William Spencer has beautifully expressed this feeling in his "Wife, Children, and Friends;"—</p>

               <p>AFTER Mr. Cameron's departure, Sandford's visits to Fair-View Cottage became more frequent and more long. Mr. Acehambur became much attached to him, and his society seemed, in some degree, to supply Mr. Cameron's absence. Alison, however, was not so easily wrought upon. His mysterious hints respecting the idol of her heart disgusted her. She soon suspected what he was driving at. Women seldom fail to perceive in men what they cannot not see in each other. They are much more alive to the little things that indicate which way the current flows. The old gentleman was in his second childhood, and had never, even in his most vigorous time, been of a very suspicious turn of mind. Sandford saw all this, and his wily nature was not indifferent to the hint. He at once set to work. Nor was he long before he succeeded in his endeavours.</p>
               <p>Two long months had rolled on, and not a word was heard of Mr. Cameron. During this long suspense, the old gentleman had had several attacks of illness, and throughout Sandford had been most assiduous in his attention to him. This completely won Mr. Acehambur's heart, and led him to unbosom himself freely respecting Cameron. He told Sandford that he had been greatly deceived, and that he never thought any one could have acted such an ungrateful part. "And as for poor Alison," continued he, "she is, I am afraid, lost to all earthly happiness on his account."</p>
               <p>To all this Sandford listened with evident surprise, and simply said, "that he would be<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC5589-00000134"/> unwilling to say anything unkind of his friend. At the same time," said he, "it doth amaze me that he does not write; for, between ourselves, I do not think CLARE the man to lose, without effort, such a precious jewel as Miss Acehambur is."</p>
               <p>"CLARE!" exclaimed the old gentleman, "what do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Oh," replied Sandford, apparently much confused, "I am very sorry to have let out my friend's real name. I hope you will excuse me, Mr. Acehambur; it is a hard thing for an honest and straightforward person to dissemble."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Sandford, is not his name Cameron? His letters always came addressed to him as such."</p>
               <p>"Believe me, Mr. Acehambur," said Sandford, drawing his chair nearer to the old gentleman, "I am extremely sorry to have been, in the least, the occasion of confirming your views of my friend's character. As I said before, it is very difficult for an honest minded man, like myself, to shield the deceitful."</p>
               <p>"Why," replied the old man, "you ought, in justice, Mr. Sandford to have spoken of this before, as it so nearly concerns my happiness, and especially the happiness of my dear child. We have been both of us most awfully deceived in him; and, yet, it may be, after all that he had some reason for changing his name. I do not think pretensions could have elicited so much sympathy as he was able to command. Besides, I often observed him at his private devotion, to which a hypocrite must ever remain, while he is a hypocrite, a complete stranger. When I bethink myself of these things I cannot but hope that there must be a misunderstanding somewhere or other; at least, Mr. Sandford, let us hope the best."</p>
               <p>"You reason nobly, sir," interrupted Sandford. "Give me your hand, my dear sir; I am but too happy in having met such an unsuspecting and generous friend. A true friend is indeed a treasure, a pearl of great price, an inestimable boon, one of the few gifts that make this miserable infancy of our being tolerable. Let me again apologize for having inadvertently<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC5589-00000135"/> advertently disclosed Mr. Cameron's real name."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the old gentleman, biting his nails, "you are quite certain that his real name is <emph>Clare</emph>, and not Cameron?"</p>
               <p>Sandford's keen eye at once discovered that all was not yet lost. Availing himself, therefore, of such an auspicious moment, he said, that he could not be mistaken—that they were, in fact, brought up together, and that he could detail every event in his past history to the moment they met him in Bristol, had he not been possessed of too much delicacy to refer to some events in his poor friend's career. At the same time, he observed that there were circumstances in which common candour demanded that all scruples should be overcome, and the truth, and nothing but the truth, be told. "Indeed," continued he, "to deceive such an unsuspecting and generous character as yourself, and to blight with the blasting breath of hypocrisy such a lovely flower, in the very blossom of its prime, as Miss Alison is, surpasses all the atrocities that the annals of crime can supply. You will, I know, Mr. Acehambur, forgive this burst of honest feeling at the thought that one whom I have long cherished as a friend could become such a disgrace to his species."</p>
               <p>"Well! well!" said the old gentleman, quite horrified at the awful picture drawn of his former friend, and intended son-in-law, "I am glad that your judgment prevailed over your natural delicacy of feeling, so as to enable you, Mr. Sandford, to make these disclosures. They will tend to console my mind, by the secret thought that my poor child is still safe, and that Providence would not allow her virgin faith to be fully betrayed by a <choice>

                     <corr>villain</corr>
                  </choice>, and her virgin purity to be soiled by such a consummate hypocrite. How wonderful are the ways of Infinite Wisdom prompting him to introduce you to our little circle as a particular friend of his; and then, this very circumstance turning out to the unmasking of his own character, and the awful extent of his nefarious practices. Now, I bethink myself, I remember well, when he spoke of you to me, and desired me to be kind<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC5589-00000136"/> to you till his return, I said, that if he liked, I should feel a pleasure in your supplying his place under my roof during his absence, as you seemed to be such a particular friend of his.—No," said he, thoughtfully, "I have no desire, whatever, that he should become such; for I do not think that his habits would exactly accord with your retired mode of living, and besides, he has lodgings provided for him at the Works."</p>
               <p>"Why, do you not see now," said Sandford, "that he was afraid lest I should let you know his real character, for he well knew that then it would be all up with him. Oh! the mysteriousness, as you said, of the ways of Providence! It was a mere accident that brought me into this neighbourhood, and my astonishment at meeting CLARE was beyond belief, for I had heard that he had been transported for stealing some plate from a friend's house, at which, on account of his father, he had been invited to spend a few weeks. Then, that I should become acquainted with you, and thus become the instrument of disabusing your noble and generous mind, and to save your dear child from becoming the bride of one so unworthy of such a treasure, and so unqualified for such an exalted enjoyment."</p>
               <p>"Thanks be praised," said the old man, "from what an utter ruin we have been saved. Had you been a week longer, my dear friend, in coming to the neighbourhood, my poor Alison would have been united to a vagabond, an outcast, a runaway, and my grey hairs would have been brought down in sorrow to the grave. Oh! how can I be grateful enough to a superintending Providence, and to you, my dear Sandford," grasping his hand, while the tears coursed down his aged cheeks, "as the instrument of our deliverance."</p>
               <p>"My dear sir," interrupted Sandford, "attribute nothing to me. I am but an unconscious instrument, as it were, in the hand of that Great Father who takes such a good care of you, as if you were the only being He had to care for. I have never felt more happy in my life than I do at this moment, being enabled to rescue virtue from the fangs of vice—<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC5589-00000137"/> purity itself from the grasp of pollution—chastity from the very jaws of depravity. Oh! with what a sweet revenue virtuous deeds return into one's bosom! O! how I thank God for having planted in my heart such an intense love for the fair, the beautiful, and the virtuous. Mr. Acehambur did you ever feel such incense of gratitude rising from the altar of your heart?"</p>
               <p>"A thousand times, Mr. Sandford," replied the old man, evidently pleased at such a compliment. "But I never thought you were so capable of appreciating what is really good, my friend. Perhaps, though, I had been a little prejudiced against you, on account of what Mr. Cameron said respecting you. But I know you will forgive me, for I was once very fond of that unfortunate young man, and believed everything he said. Poor fellow! he behaved well while under my roof, and I am heartily sorry for him for his own sake."</p>
               <p>"It's growing late," said Sandford, buttoning his coat, "and I must be moving. I am sorry, Mr. Acehambur, I undeceived you about that young man, for you evidently suspect my honour, or you could have no kind thought to spare for that villain."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Sandford," cried Mr. Acehambur, with some energy, "I have no reason to suspect you, or doubt your honour, yet the charm of old friendship cannot be forgotten all at once. It is, I think, far more in accordance with the charity recommended in the Bible to be loth to believe what is evil of any one, especially of an old and tried friend. I cannot but cherish some hope that all is not over with poor Archibald, after all."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to find you so charitable," said Sandford, somewhat coldly—"Good night."</p>
               <p>"Good night, Mr. Sandford, and thank you for your call, and hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing you soon again."</p>
               <p>After his departure, the old man sunk into a deep reverie. He recalled every little incident in his intercourse with Mr. Cameron during the period he spent under his roof. There were many things that seemed to give a colouring of truth to what Mr. Sandford said respecting<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC5589-00000138"/> ing him; and yet, looking at what he personally knew of him, without prejudice, the tendency of the whole was to falsify the statements of his accuser. Moreover, he thought Sandford a little too personal and unnecessarily severe in his manner of speaking, which, he could not help thinking, betrayed a sad deficiency in the sympathy which the misfortune of our friends is expected to excite.</p>
               <p>The more he thought of Mr. Cameron, the more was he perplexed. His conduct, provided he was the vile hypocrite Mr. Sandford would have him to be, was inexplicable. His humility, his religious fervour, his intense love of truth, the propriety of his conduct with regard to Alison, his love of solitude, and the frequency of his private devotional exercises, all combined to constitute a character which none but a true Christian can lay claim to. As he thought of these things, his aged cheek crimsoned with conscious guilt for having allowed Sandford to utter such vile calumnies without contradicting him, and endeavouring to defend his friend, by showing that, however bad he might have been in his younger days, he was quite a changed character while under his roof; that the Divine grace by which the change had been wrought was equal to the perfecting of what it had begun; nay, that such would be the issue; that it was his duty to judge of him from what he knew of his character; that a mere hearsay, without any actual proof, was by no means a proper criterion by which to judge of him; that the accuser was less known to him than the accused, and that the bold assertion of the one was not of sufficient weight to prejudice his mind against the other. As these thoughts rapidly passed through his mind, he felt all the energies of his soul rising up in arms against the man who had dared prejudice his friend, and by the mere force of his impudence, persuade him that a friendship, short as it was, endeared to him and his, by so many pleasing recollections, was a barefaced hypocrisy,—a vile imposition.</p>
               <p>"My youth and manhood," uttered he, with all the energy that attend noble-mindedness, "ever found me true and faithful to my friend;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC5589-00000139"/> and is the noble heritage, preserved for so many years, to be taken from me in my old age, by such a small effort as the mere wagging of a stranger's tongue? No, no! old Acehambur is not so easily imposed upon as this flippant youth thinks. Oh, Percy, Percy! thou knowest, my sainted friend, the intensity of my affections, the depth of my love, the firmness of my friendship."</p>
               <p>As a friend, I need scarcely say, Mr. Acehambur was remarkable for the fervour and constancy of his attachment.</p>

                  </choice> at the failure of his attack on Mr. Cameron's character. He was not, however, by any means hopeless. His evil genius was never at a loss, when one mode of assault failed, to bring out another. His mind was most prolific as regards plots, the horrid issues of its nefarious working. He was too accustomed to see his plans frustrated, to feel inclined to relinquish his present design on account of the unfriendly impression which his first attempts seemed to have produced on Mr. Acehambur's<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC5589-00000140"/> mind. His aim, from the moment Cameron left, had been to supplant him in the old man's estimation; and he had done much in removing the obstacles that lay in his way. Mr. Acehambur was in the habit of having his letters conveyed from town in Mr. Williams's letter-bag. This gentleman, the reader should bear in mind, was Sandford's master. As his clerk, therefore, it was his province to keep the key of the letter-bag, and to see that all was rightly managed. Knowing this, Mr. Cameron had given him strict orders that he should convey all his letters to Mr. Acehambur and Miss Alison with his own hand. He also desired him to keep up a regular correspondence with him, informing him of everything respecting his friends, and especially the manner in which poor Alison would bear his absence. All this Sandford had faithfully promised to do. The first letter, however, that came from Mr. Cameron to Miss Alison, together with a small parcel addressed to the old gentleman, he opened, and then, with a grin of diabolical s faction, looked up in his own box. In the meanwhile, he wrote to Cameron that Miss Alison had already forgotten him, and was constantly flirting about with a Mr. R——, a wealthy young gentleman in the neighbourhood, whom he knew Mr. Cameron had for some time suspected of being in love with her, and that the old gentleman had promised him her hand. "Indeed," said he, "it appears to me—though I am sorry to wound your feelings by giving expression to my suspicions—that they, both father and daughter, were heartily tired of you, and were most glad to get rid of such a heartless <emph>fortune hunter</emph>, as they are now pleased to call you. I can assure you, my dearest Archibald, that all the <emph>inns</emph> and <emph>outs</emph> of Fair-View since you left, are like so many daggers to me, and nothing but my faithfulness and gratitude to you for all your past kindness, could induce me to go there at all. They literally idolize young Mr. R——, and to see the figure that the young puppy cuts where your noble manly form ought to appear—and as for Alison, she is actually mad for him. I can never think her the same modest, retiring-looking<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC5589-00000141"/> ing creature as she appeared in your society. But you know that this verifies what I have ever thought of woman, that they are 'fair as the moon, and as changeable too.' Oh, what a world of <choice>

               <p>"The other night (wishing to introduce your name, to see what impression it would produce) I asked her whether you had taken all your luggage with you?'</p>
               <p>"'Luggage!' she exclaimed, convulsed with laughter, 'a pair of shirts and a suit of clothes, given him by my poor father.'</p>
               <p>"I could contain myself no longer, and lest I should tear her to pieces, I abruptly left the house, and have not entered it since; nor do I think they are sorry for it. Anything that reminds them of you, they do not much care for, and on this score they treat me now with the greatest coldness. The contemptible puppy, I am told, has been trying to persuade Alison that I am not respectable enough to be made, as it were, an equal of. Oh! it doth amaze me to see Mammon everywhere idolized, while talents and goodness are everywhere neglected. Yesterday, I went on purpose to see the old gentleman, and spoke as much as I could in your favour. Having told him of your excellent character and the respectable standing of your family, I made bold to tell him that your fortune would now exceed that of young Mr. R——.</p>
               <p>"He looked undecided. He then said, after a moment's pause:—</p>
               <p>"'Do you think, Mr. Sandford, that all you say is true?'</p>
               <p>"'True!' exclaimed I, utterly amazed that he could doubt for a moment, what you had told him,—'true! Certainly—as true as I am standing here. Did he not tell you of it before he left?' continued I.</p>
               <p>"'Well,' he said, 'yes, he told me so; but you see, Mr. Sandford, I have no proof of it.'</p>
               <p>"'Proof!' said I, wild with indignation, 'proof! and is his own word not a sufficient proof, and mine a sufficient corroboration of it? It is evident,' I said to him, 'that you do not yet know my noble and generous friend, or<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC5589-00000142"/> you could never suspect him, or prefer any other before him as your future son-in-law. His word, I can assure you, Mr. Acehambur, is as good as a bond, any day. He is integrity personified. Goodness,' I exclaimed, vehemently, 'and Archibald Cameron are synonymous terms.' Was not this noble, my fine fellow? What is friendship worth, if we do not stick up for each other and make the most of it? The old man is, I am afraid, prejudiced against you, some how or other. What did your last letter to him contain? He has not been the same since. I hope you said nothing that could vex him. Poor old fool! he is in his second childhood, it requires a vast deal of prudence and skill to manage him; but I do not yet despair, I think I perceive some symptoms of relenting about him; trust the whole affair to me, my dear fellow, and I am confident I can bring it to a favourable issue, after all. It would be a misfortune to lose her, changeable as she is. When married, she must grow constant. She has a finer fortune than I at first thought; but to secure it for you, my dear fellow, is the grand point, and to the attaining of which, my utmost efforts, you may depend upon it, shall be directed. You cannot think how my heart dilates with pleasure at the idea of its being within my power, in some small degree, at least, to requite the innumerable instances of kindness received from you. Believe me, my dearest Archibald, your last lecture to me before you left, has not been given in vain. I am an altered man altogether—a new being; such a one, I trust, in every respect, as your excellent self would wish to see."</p>
               <p>This is the manner in which this consummate hypocrite used to go on in his letters to such an invaluable friend—one that had done so much to serve him. While this amiable and unsuspecting youth was just preparing to return to his friends to Fair-View Cottage, having settled his worldly affairs, and full of buoyant hope with regard to the happiness he thought Providence had in store for him, he was suddenly called to a distant part of the Continent to attend the dying wishes of a distant relative,<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC5589-00000143"/> who had received a mortal wound at the battle of ——.</p>
               <p>It was thus that this amiable young man was destined like a fair flower to give out the sweetness of his excellent nature, by being trampled upon by the crushing heel of affliction.</p>
               <p>This unavoidable putting off of his return, afforded time to his secret enemy to mature his plans. Having insinuated himself into all Mr. Acehambur's secrets, and thus ascertained the amount of his property, he conceived the bold measure of making a proposal for Miss Alison's hand, in order to make sure of the prize before his rival's return; and in case he should fail there, as he had his fears he would, he had in his mind a more desperate and atrocious scheme, which would not fail to realize his wishes. Hardened as he was in villainy, the conception of this last scheme in the annals of crime connected with the idea, in the case of a possible failure, of taking this last step in the career of infamy, sent a thrill of horror through his soul and convulsed his whole frame. Such feeling, however, was with him but momentary, as the shivering felt by, the bather at the first plunge. Once fairly in, he thought no more of fear. Indecision left him, and he pursued the atrocious career he had marked out for himself, with all the coolness and recklessness that the habit of yielding to temptation ultimately engenders. How awfully rapid the progress of crime! Who would have thought that the idea of proposing to a virtuous young lady, would have been the forerunner of such horrible design, the father of such a repulsive monster?</p>
               <p>During Mr. Cameron's residence on the Continent, Sandford kept up a regular correspondence with him. His letters, however, were a mere tissue of falsehood from beginning to end. He wrote what he considered most conducive to the furtherance of his designs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cameron, on the other hand, opened to him all his heart; whatever he did or said bore the real stamp of sincerity. He was ignorant of the way of the dissembler—his character was hateful to him. Whenever he happened to<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC5589-00000144"/> doubt Sandford's sincerity, he at once disclosed to him his suspicions, not even concealing what in his letters had given rise to them, in order that he might have an opportunity of removing them and clearing himself. Now this was just the kind of person that Sandford liked, because such a transparent character could be at once seen through. Such he firmly believed Cameron to be. He, therefore, felt that whilst their correspondence was kept up, he was perfectly safe, inasmuch as all his movements would be known to him; and as to the old gentleman and his daughter, he could easily manage to keep them in the dark respecting his knowing anything of Cameron's whereabouts. Seeing that everything seemed to wear such a friendly aspect, he no longer entertained the shadow of a doubt as to the success of his undertaking. "Nothing venture, nothing have," was a favourite maxim with him; and now he fancied himself already reaping the delicious fruits of what he deemed his own abilities, argued himself into the absurd notion that he possessed all the elements requisite to constitute a first-rate man, and that nothing but favourable circumstances were necessary to bring him out.—Then, bending over the small fire in his small bare-walled office, he would picture to himself the astonishment of the world at the bare possibility of such a genius having ever attained such an astounding growth, while flourishing unnoticed in the deep shade of obscurity. He was already the idol of the gay circles of the metropolis—the brilliancy of his wit, the talk of the town—his society courted by all—the fair dying for him—and the rising youth of the realm apeing him. Many a time had his cheeks crimsoned at the thought, that as he was passing through the streets, he saw his own likeness in every bookseller's window, and heard the whisper going round, "Now, look! do you not see? there goes the great Sandford, the Secretary of State. Isn't he a splendid fellow!" Not unfrequently, while he was stunned by the plaudits of an admiring Senate, and trembling at his own elevation, Mr. Williams would enter the office, unnoticed by the great senator, and having taken off his comforter<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC5589-00000145"/> forter and laid his lusty stick on the table, would tap him gently on the shoulder, saying:—</p>
               <p>"Well, clerk, my dear fellow, this won't do at all; you don't get on with your work; I must really, my good fellow," rubbing his hands as hard as he could, and looking as angry as his fat, good-natured face would allow, "I must look for another clerk unless you reform and stick closer to your work."</p>
               <p>Oh, what a fall was there! From the highest pinnacle of ambition to be thus thrown down at once, into a poor clerk's condition, and that not likely to be his long; and thus to be threatened by a man remarkable for nothing but an extreme dulness, encased in a good-natured lump of flesh. The flash of indignation that gleamed in Sandford's eyes at hearing his great name thus profaned, almost frightened his employer out of the small wit he had. This little incident, insignificant as it may appear, greatly helped to confirm him in his absurd ambition.</p>
               <p>"Now," said he to himself, when his employer had left him, "there must be something extraordinary about my whole appearance; something commanding, grand and majestic; otherwise, how could the employed awe and quell his employer by his mere look, as I have just done? The man, incapable as he is, of receiving any impression, and appreciating what is really noble, could not stand in my presence; but was obliged to leave, though he be my master. Oh, the Gods! I thank you for having singled me out of the common herd, as a man made to command, and destined for great achievements. What signifies," said he, with an unconscious shiver, as he uttered the words, "what signifies, if I must wade to my destiny through human gore. Others have done so before me. The great Napoleon was carried by torrents of blood to an empire—the position that the fates had assigned to him. And, why may not I attain my destined end by similar means? I am determined not to rot away ingloriously in this obscure condition. Better be known and admired as an accomplished villain, than to die as a ridiculous fool, having spent his life in poverty and servitude. I must redeem<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC5589-00000146"/> the noble character for which the gods designed me, or I cannot expect their aid.</p>
               <p>"I am resolved. I will venture all on a single throw. May Fate assist me!"</p>

               <p>"ALISON, my dear," said Mr. Acehambur to his daughter, who was so weak that she could scarcely raise herself up in bed, "how do you feel this morning? I hope, better. Your pulse is rather quick, my love. You are none the worse for that, dear, and yet you seem very sad. What! no smile for your poor old father? I am sure something ails you. What! has any one dared to annoy my poor pet?"</p>
               <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC5589-00000147"/>
               <p>"Oh, papa! you are too good, too kind to me. How can I be grateful enough to God for giving me such a father! What should I have done, now, had it not been for you, my dear father?"</p>
               <p>"Come, come, my love, I am sure you have something to ask of me. How coaxing you are! You have such ways about you! So like your poor mother." The old gentleman's voice became weak and tremulous as he uttered the last words, and the tears coursed down his cheek.</p>
               <p>"Papa," cried Alison, "what is the matter? You always weep whenever yon mention my mama's name. Was she not good? Is she not happy? Did she not tell you, when she died, that she was going to Heaven, and that you would meet her and her brother there? Why weep for her, then? Do you wish to see her back in this miserable world again?"</p>
               <p>"No, no, my love," cried the old man, "I would not rob her of her eternal bliss, were I able to do so. But you know, my dear, that one cannot always command one's feelings. And mine are very tender this morning. I have passed such a restless night. Our complicated misfortunes lay heavily on my spirits."</p>
               <p>"Why, papa," asked Miss Alison, "what misfortunes are you alluding to? I think we are better off than many, and have every reason to be thankful. Think of the thousands that are racked with excruciating pain, on the bed of sickness,—or pining away in exile,—or are found in the commission of great crimes,—or about to expiate their offences on the scaffold. Think of the many that were during the past night burnt out of houses, or have perished by shipwreck, or have been robbed, or murdered."</p>
               <p>"True, my darling, you are quite right," exclaimed Mr. Acehambur, "I was wrong to murmur at our lot."</p>
               <p>"Yes, papa," added Alison, "for what cause can we have for murmuring against God's dealings towards us? Ought we not to be contented with what we have, rather than make ourselves miserable about what we have not? Depend upon it, papa, we shall never feel as<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC5589-00000148"/> happy as we ought, unless we keep far from the objects that render us miserable. If we keep near God, and implicitly trust Him, we shall be happy, for He is the source of happiness. On the other hand, if the wicked be our associates, we can rationally expect nothing but trouble and anguish."</p>
               <p>"Why, my dear, what are you alluding to?" continued Mr. Acehambur. "We associate with no wicked people. You know, my dear, that we live almost like hermits."</p>
               <p>"Yes, papa, it were far better for us, were we not almost, but altogether so, than being as we are. My dearest father, forgive me for what I am about to say! You have become quite a changed man since this Sandford has become so intimate with you. You are not at all the placid, happy, patriarchal being that you used to be. Every visit of his leaves you worse than before. Your nights become restless, your whole demeanour fretful, and even your step feeble and undecided. What can he be saying to you to make you so miserable? Why not tell him at once never to enter this house again?"</p>
               <p>The old man stood transfixed with astonishment; trembling from head to foot; while the keen eye of his daughter, still fixed upon him, shone with fearful brilliancy. He had never before witnessed such a display of grace, firmness, and conscious dignity in the fragile and beautiful form of his beloved child. He scarcely durst believe his own senses, so imposing was the sight. Feeling that all she said was exactly the case, he hardly knew what to say for himself. At length, having gained a command over his own feelings, he said that he was astonished to hear her sentiments relative to Mr. Sandford's visits; that it was true, since his recent illness, he had not felt as he used to feel in his younger days; nor could he be expected, at his time of life, to experience all the buoyancy of youth, and the calm and dignified bearing of manhood; and that he could not think of forbidding the house to a man to whom he had pledged himself to show kindness.</p>
               <p>"You know, my dear," continued he, "that<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC5589-00000149"/> Mr. Cameron made me promise him, before he left, that I would, for his sake, act kindly towards Mr. Sandford. Such being the case, you see, dear Alison, that to treat him unkindly would, in effect, be to treat Mr. Cameron so."</p>
               <p>"Now, papa, allow me, seriously, to ask you one question? Is he not the cause of your uneasiness of mind, sleepless nights, lack of appetite, nervous excitement, &amp;c.? Do you not always, after his visits, feel unwell, low-spirited, and irritable?"</p>
               <p>"Why, child," exclaimed the old man, "you are forgetting yourself: you really treat me as if I were a child, and not a parent whose grey hairs ought, at any rate, to claim some respect. What! am I to be questioned like a schoolboy by my own daughter? Alison, do you really think your father in his second childhood, unable to discern between right and wrong; and to act as a gentleman and a Christian ought to act? I must tell you, child, that old Acehambur will, by God's help, never be accused of inhospitality, or of not fulfilling the promise he has given to a friend."</p>
               <p>"Papa," cried Alison, bursting into tears, "Heaven knows that I never, even in thought, doubted your parental authority. You misunderstand me altogether, indeed you do, dear papa! Treat me not as a child; but speak to me as an only beloved and obedient daughter. My desire is not to offend you, but to relieve your anxieties by removing the cause. If I have misunderstood the cause, or mistaken the way to remove it, forgive a dutiful daughter's blind solicitude respecting the health and comfort of an only and beloved parent."</p>
               <p>"Forgive you, my own precious child! yes, and kiss away those sweet tears, the precious pledges of your filial love and obedience. I can never thank you enough, my, dearest, for the tenderness with which you requite the blessings you have received from your poor old father, assist him down the decline of life, and with the sweetness of your disposition, chase away the horrors of the tomb."</p>
               <p>"Now, indeed, you speak like my poor father,<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC5589-00000150"/> and your sweet countenance is again lighted up with happiness. I hope that hateful Sandford will never come again to destroy your peace of mind, and disturb the repose of your sanctified spirit."</p>
               <p>"Hush! my love, that is not right. Hatred ought never to be cherished in the heart of a Christian. Hatred is the characteristic attribute of the enemy of God and man."</p>
               <p>"Why, papa, God himself hates evil and those that do it. 'He is angry every day with the wicked.' It is not Mr. Sanford's person that I hate; though I can scarcely say that I love even that; but his wicked and artful insinuations respecting Archibald which I cannot yet but believe to be the cause of your unhappiness. Come, my dear father, what makes you so reserved with me? I am all openness with you. You used to be so with me; and then you were happy—we were both happy. Is not Sandford Archibald's deadly enemy? Why conceal anything from me? Am I not your daughter? Do I not inherit your kind disposition? Am I not like my dear mother?"</p>
               <p>"Alison, Alison! what do you mean by all these tender appeals to my feelings?"</p>
               <p>"Only, papa, to remove the cause of your late indisposition and increased your comforts."</p>
               <p>"To be candid with you then, my girl, I am afraid Mr. Sandford is not exactly what I should call a friend to poor Archibald."</p>
               <p>"I know it, and I can give you a reason or two that may tend to throw some light on the subject."</p>
               <p>"Well, you astonish me! Let me hear what you have to communicate."</p>
               <p>"Ah! there now, you won't be angry, will you? You thought I did not know what ailed you, did you? Never think me so short-sighted again, papa! Well, the other day, you know, I went to B——."</p>
               <p>"Well!"</p>
               <p>"While there, I called at the post-office and asked the post-master, showing him Archibald's handwriting, whether any letter, addressed in that hand, passed through the office. He called his daughter, and his wife, and the letter-carrier,<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC5589-00000151"/> that used to help them to assort the letters, showed them the handwriting of Archibald, and asked them whether any letters in that handwriting had passed through their office. They three, all at once, said, 'that they had often seen letters addressed in that hand to several people, and as they were, generally, addressed, 'care of Mr. Sandford,' they were invariably put into Mr. Williams's letter-bag.'"</p>
               <p>The old man looked quite stupified, fixed his eyes on the ground, and remained silent for several minutes. Then turning to his daughter, said;—</p>
               <p>"Why did you not tell this before, my dear, it would have saved me a world of trouble?"</p>
               <p>"It was only the other day, papa, that I was at B——."</p>
               <p>"True, true! you are quite right, love."</p>
               <p>"I have another secret to communicate to you respecting this great hypocrite, that my honour has been assailed by him; the impurity of his language I dare not repeat."</p>
               <p>"What, what!—what do you mean, Alison?"</p>
               <p>"I mean, papa, that this <choice>
                     <sic>villian</sic>
                     <corr>villain</corr>
                  </choice> has attempted, in more ways than one, to corrupt your daughter."</p>
               <p>"Vile hypocrite!" cried the old man, "and is he the man to traduce poor Archibald's character? Fool that I was to listen to him! Let him dare show his sinister face to me again! Would he were here! He would feel the weight of these arms, aged as they are—the consummate villain!"</p>
               <p>"Come, come, papa! that is scarcely worthy of your grey hairs."</p>
               <p>"Alison, did Cameron ever say anything to you of an improper character? Come, deal faithfully with your poor old father, dearest."</p>
               <p>"Archibald say anything improper! Why, you know, father, that he is purity itself. Never did he utter a word to me that angels might not have caught, echoed and re-echoed through the pure regions of the celestial country; from his lips nothing but gracious words<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC5589-00000152"/> dropped, such as seraphs might use while speaking to each other."</p>
               <p>"And yet," exclaimed Mr. Acehambur, with energy, "this hateful Sandford durst tell me things respecting Mr. Cameron that would shock humanity to hear. And to me, Archibald's bosom friend. Oh! how I loathe myself for having listened to him—for having proved unfaithful to that innocent and excellent young man."</p>
               <p>"How well I divined the source of your misery. Would to God I had spoken sooner to you, for it would have saved you many painful reflections! Nothing, I think, tends more to brighten the retrospect of life, than the consciousness that we have proved faithful to our friends, however misunderstood we may have been by them."</p>
               <p>"Thou art your father's daughter, my noble girl. Never did I before even tolerate for a moment, the traducer of a friend, and I hope soon to show you that this apparent false step has been retrieved."</p>

                  </choice> benefit of the enjoyment of the present. The thought of one day returning to the bosom of his friends, and claiming the idol of his heart, had supported him under all his heavy trials, and now that he was about to realize all his wishes, he hardly knew how to contain himself. But even the thought of seeing his friends had, before he was halfway to them, become somewhat tinged with gloomy apprehensions that all might not be as he could wish. Happily for him, his knowledge of Sandford's character prevented him from believing what he had told him respecting Alison. He, moreover, felt thoroughly convinced that Sandford never gave the Acehambur's his letters. And then came the delicious thought of taking the old gentleman and Alison by surprise. How they would cling to him! Then he tried to imagine what would be the first words that dear Alison would utter, feigning, as near as he could, her sweet voice, and becoming transported with the joke. These innocent and pleasant musings lasted till he arrived at C——.</p>
               <p>When fairly there, the first thing he did was to call on Mr. E——, the banker, to enquire after the welfare of Mr. Acehambur and Miss Alison. To his great surprise, he was told that the old gentleman had just left the house, taking with him all the money he had deposited there. Losing no time, Mr. Cameron immediately made after his old friend. His conduct was from all he could learn from Mr. E——, inscrutable. While racking his brains with fruitless conjectures, and wild with joy at the thought of so soon embracing his beloved friends he stumbled over the body of a man stretched across the path that led from the high road to Fair-View Cottage, apparently quite drunk.</p>
               <p>On feeling the pulse, he found the body warm, but circulation had ceased. The head was also frightfully disfigured. The murderer had done his work and escaped. But who could the murdered man be? Oh, horrid thought!<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC5589-00000154"/> the worst of his conjectures were verified. At that moment, Mr. Acehambur's servants, being alarmed at his being out so late, came with a lantern to the very spot where Cameron stood, petrified at the piteous sight before him.</p>
               <p>The sight of the good old servants, and the bloody corpse of his old friend, Mr. Acehambur, quite deprived him of utterance, until he heard one of the servants crying for help, and telling the other to secure the murderer, pointing to him. Vain were all his remonstrances. Every voice—for there were many now present—demanded his friend's blood at his hands; and some indistinctly muttered between their teeth, "Mr. Sandford was right in what he said respecting him." While others frantic with rage, clenched their fists and gnashed their teeth, giving vent to the most awful imprecations. The news spread like wild-fire through the whole neighbourhood, that Mr. Cameron had returned, and had murdered his old benefactor, Mr. Acehambur. Horror and indignation were discernible in every countenance: all hastened to the awful scene. During the whole night, scarcely an individual closed his eyes in the neighbourhood: the excitement that prevailed was unparalleled in the annals of that quiet locality. Nor can we wonder that such was the case, when we consider the strong circumstantial evidence that existed against Mr. Cameron.</p>
               <p>The day after, an inquest was held on the body, at Fair-View Cottage, when, after a deliberation of nearly eight hours, a verdict of "wilful murder" was returned against Mr. Archibald Cameron, and he was committed for trial accordingly.</p>
               <p>The evidence of the servants were regarded by all as conclusive; but, in addition to theirs, Mr. E——, the banker, of C——, stated that Mr. Cameron called upon him immediately after Mr. Acehambur had left, and, being told that the old gentleman had taken with him all the money he had deposited in his hands, he refused to stay there for a moment, but at once rushed out after the old gentleman. The evidence of this gentleman settled the question at once.</p>
               <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC5589-00000155"/>
               <p>There was, however, one circumstance which caused a considerable doubt to hang on the whole proceeding; namely, that not a farthing of the old gentleman's money was found on Mr. Cameron's person; and, what was equally mysterious, not a farthing was found on the person of the murdered man himself.</p>
               <p>It were vain to describe poor Cameron's feelings while wading through the deep waters of affliction. He had become so stupified and unconcerned, that many were led to doubt the soundness of his mind; others ill-naturedly hinted that it was but a scheme of his, in order to defeat justice. The coherency, however, with which, when called upon, he related all the circumstances connected with his return—his calling upon Mr. E——, the banker—the cause of the abruptness with which he left that gentleman's house—and the finding of the body—went a great way to dispel any delusion that might have existed respecting his sanity.</p>
               <p>It were hard to say whether Cameron or his beloved Alison were most to be pitied. The one had lost a friend and a betrothed; the other, a beloved parent and an intended husband—and both loved almost to idolatry. Who therefore, from the susceptible nature of her sex, can conceive her agonies? Her poor father's mangled body was with her in the house; her beloved Archibald charged with his death; and, according to the tenor of the verdict brought against him, would soon suffer an ignominious death upon the scaffold. Though she, herself, believed him innocent and pure, every one else regard him as guilty, and shuddered at the very mention of his name. She constantly, while raving under her complicated misfortunes, uttered his name with wild delight and maddening affection, in connection with that of her murdered parent; and incessantly desired to see him.</p>
               <p>She, moreover, in the most confident manner, fixed the perpetration of the deed upon Mr. Sandford, and what gave some likelihood to her assertion was, that that worthy individual had decamped the very night the murder had taken place. A pistol had also been found in an adjoining field, which Mr. Cameron, on seeing,<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC5589-00000156"/> pronounced to be Mr. Sandford's, and that he himself, had once nearly been murdered by the same weapon, handled by the same individual.</p>
               <p>This assertion was, of course, looked upon as a mere fabrication in order to clear himself. Everybody argued that if Mr. Sandford had tried to murder Mr. Cameron, Mr. Cameron would not have exerted himself to get a place for him, nor would he have introduced him to Mr. Acehambur as a friend of his. All with one consent, pronounced poor Cameron an unqualified vagabond and liar.</p>
               <p>In a few days, however, the whole neighbourhood became stunned with the intelligence that Mr. Sandford was in custody, at Southampton, for robbing a lady that travelled in the same coach with him; and what was still more astounding, that Mr. Acehambur's note and other papers were found on his person; and that no doubt could be entertained of his being the murderer of Mr. Acehambur.</p>
               <p>The rage so universally felt against poor Cameron, at once gave way to the deepest sympathy and the sincerest compassion. That very day, there was not a hand in the neighbourhood but would have instantly broken his fetters, and led him out of the prison in triumph.</p>
               <p>The next tidings respecting Sandford were, that he had made a full confession of the murder, together with the fraud he practised on Cameron's credulity; and that what he said respecting the pistol having been levelled at his head was perfectly true. The newspapers teemed with laudatory compliments on Cameron's character, and imprecations on Sandford's villainy.</p>
               <p>Sandford, in common with most villains, betrayed great terror as the day fixed for his execution drew nigh. The chaplain of the prison expostulated and prayed with him, but to no purpose. He gave no sign of repentance. His only sorrow was the result of fear—the dread of danger—the terrible expectation of an ignominious death.</p>
               <p>The last moment of his wicked life was humiliating indeed. He had not the courage to take the last step in his career of infamy<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC5589-00000157"/> with the audacity that characterized him life. He cried like a child, and was obliged be carried upon the scaffold, and supported until the rope was adjusted, and then *  *  *  </p>
               <p>Poor Alison had borne up under all her heavy calamities with extraordinary fortitude. She still loved Cameron to madness, and believed him innocent and pure throughout. She, moreover, had convinced most of her friends, before any tidings of Sandford had been received, that he was her father's murderer; and that it was he who had persuaded her father to take his money out of the bank, stating, that he had heard, on good authority, that it was about to close.</p>
               <p>The sudden realization of her wishes, however, respecting her beloved Archibald, produced a very different effect upon her susceptible mind, from what might have been expected. A sad proof that man is born to trouble in this world, rather than happiness.</p>
               <p>When poor Archibald left the prison, he at once repaired to the darling of his soul, the report of whose assertion of his innocency had given sweet liberty to thought, while the body was immured in a dungeon; but the moment she saw his face and heard his voice, she flew at him with a wild shriek of joy that announced the wreck of her noble intellect. Cameron himself became almost frantic when he saw the symptoms of madness that glared in her intelligent and beautiful eyes.</p>

               <p>ALISON'S friends did not treat young Cameron well. They knew that he was innocent. For all that, he was a man that had been imprisoned. No body could deny that. Even his most familiar acquaintances shuddered when they saw him. He looked somehow a different man altogether. His voice had lost its sweetness. His manners were not half so engaging as they used to be. The little children that used to take such a delight in his society, timidly peeped at him from behind the doors, or cautiously stole near their mammas, as if dreadfully afraid of him. He once caught a little child in his arms and was going to kiss her, when the mother violently snatched her from his hands as if his touch had been contagious.</p>
               <p>Poor Archibald was a sensitive creature, and these unequivocal indications of fear and distrust, touched him to the quick. He naturally looked for sympathy, but was met with cold civilities. He was not, it was quite evident, in the sight of the world, the man that he was before his misfortunes.</p>
               <p>To be trampled upon, however unjustly, lowers a man for life in the estimation of some people. And more than all it lessens the man in his own eyes. He cannot face society with his former courage. He feels that he is an ill-used man; that the first impression made on the public—ere he had the means of clearing himself—can never be entirely removed; that, however clean he may appear now, he was in the mire when the press deigned to make him known to the public. He bleeds inwardly. Like the stricken deer, he seeks the shade of obscurity, where he may unmolestedly indulge his grief. In public, he is pointed at<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC5589-00000159"/> as a sufferer. He may be pitied. But who, possessing all the luxuries of a clear conscience, would like to be pointed at as a bankrupt, living upon the pity and compassion of a heartless world.</p>
               <p>Archibald Cameron was not of a misanthropic turn of mind. Otherwise, with his ample means, he might have retired from the world in disgust. He looked beyond the second causes and regarded his adversity as a royal messenger sent directly from Him to whose service he had consecrated his being. Even while at Fair-View Cottage, he had his misgivings that he was neglecting the great duty of preaching the gospel, for the discharge of which, he considered himself laid under peculiar obligations. He considered himself as not his own, but bound by an irrevocable vow to serve his day and generation according to the will of God. He had drunk deep of the spirit of his master. Afflictions did not chill his heart.—They rather warmed it—kindled his zeal—quickened his hope, and strengthened his faith.</p>
               <p>Having sold the old mansion, and turned all he had into money, he determined to seek a home in the New World, where under an assumed name, he might become useful, as a minister of the gospel.</p>
               <p>Poor Alison, how he wished to see her once more. He wrote to her friends imploring them to let him have that melancholy pleasure. He receive a most uncourteous and unfeeling reply, stating that the doctor would not permit any one to see her, and that should she ever be restored, she could not be his—that he might rest assured of that. Is there no feeling in the world, he bitterly exclaimed, throwing the letter into his desk. Yes, he continued, there are those, at any rate, in the world that have feeling—and fine feelings too. Alison—Keyworth—and my despised self.</p>
               <p>The next day Cameron was on his way to the old Rectory, the residence of his dear and trust-worthy friend, Edward Keyworth. The old man wept for joy when he saw him—pressed him to his heart—and it was sometime before he could utter a word. Haw grateful to poor Archibald, to feel the faithful beating of his<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC5589-00000160"/> friend's heart. No cold civilities there, but a warm fatherly welcome. The old gentleman was grieved to learn that the old mansion had been sold, and was almost crazy when he fully understood his young friend's intention.</p>
               <p>He, after many entreaties and remonstrances, prevailed upon his old pupil to remain with him—under his assumed name—for a few months. During this period he strongly urged him to take orders in the English Church, endeavouring to show that, as his object was to preach the gospel, he could do it as well within the pale of the church as without it. A bishop was found who promised to ordain him, and to whom his whole past history was made known. This made his Lordship hesitate. He at length, however, after much enquiry and delay, admitted him into Holy Orders. His first curacy was in a country place where he at once became extremely popular. His popularity made him a <emph>marked man</emph>. His Rector grew jealous of his influence. The neighbouring clergy were unanimous in their determination to crush him. He was not a college man and what business had he to become such a favourite with the public? He was not a reading man. It was a shame that such a shallow-brained boy should get the start of everybody.</p>
               <p>There were monthly clerical meetings, at which the great lions used to out a tremendous figure, trying each other's strength to the utmost. Young Maclaren—for so he called himself, that being his mother's maiden name, was expected to be present at their next meeting. A subject had been introduced at the last meetings relative to the propriety of calling the Simeon School, Evangelical. It was a trap laid for young Maclaren. Some of the clergy did not hesitate to avow as much, and hint at a great deal more. When the day of the meeting came, it was painful to see with what unscrupulous and malicious cruelty a set of gentlemen, calling themselves ministers of love and peace, could act towards a young brother just entering on the sacred duties of his profession. The young gentlemen soon discovered that to act with too much tenderness towards each other, was, by no means, the amiable<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC5589-00000161"/> able infirmity of his brethren. He was attacked upon the right and upon the left, and especially behind his back, with an earnestness worthy of a better cause. He saw, however, to his great satisfaction, that his foes were an army of pigmies, incapable, of using the artillery they had carried into their field, and which he vigorously wrested from their hands, and brought to bear most destructively upon themselves. The most prudent among them, seeing how things were likely to end, began to smile blandly, and courteously motioned a retreat. But the young general would not allow them. He was evidently in his element. He had, it was quite clear, been informed of their design, and was well prepared for the conflict. It was shameful not to keep the secret. He was not a man to be dealt honestly with. He was too rude and presumptuous. He had evidently risen from the mass, as the rudeness of his manners showed. What did they know who, or what he was? Bishops ought to be more careful whom they ordain. He was not fit to associate with gentlemen of birth and education tion. It was thus that these noble-minded Christian gentlemen consoled themselves.</p>
               <p>New schemes of revenge were now concocted. The hot-headed young preacher must be taught how to conduct himself in the society of gentlemen. None of them shook hands with him when he was leaving—none accompanied him home; one that had gone before, when he saw him in his rear, took another road.</p>
               <p>Certainly, it was very considerate of them to give him room enough. Archibald was partial to a walk in the country by himself. They must have known his predilection. How gentlemanly to allow him to have his own way? He ought to be very grateful to them.</p>
               <p>He thought his study looked very dull that evening, and the old servant remarkably stupid, more so, indeed, than usual. It could not be his own tea that was put into the pot. It was not half so good. The stupid creature must be in love—at her time of life too,—it was shameful.</p>
               <p>The Church Warden drops in to ask him to dine with him the following day, and to christen<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC5589-00000162"/> his little baby. They talk about things in the parish, and suggest new plans for increasing the schools. He is told how he is liked by every body, and how partial the Dissenters are to his preaching—what the squire said after he heard his last sermon, and how crazy Miss so-and-so, poor girl, was.</p>
               <p>"You have excellent tea, Mr. Maclaren; Where do you get it?"</p>
               <p>"I bought this of Mr. Smith, the grocer. I am glad you like it. Have another cup. There is more in the pot."</p>
               <p>"Upon my word, I think I will; 'tis very good!"</p>
               <p>"I always enjoy my tea," continued Maclaren, brightening up into a comfortable glow.</p>
               <p>How comfortable the snug little study looks. The tea, too, so very refreshing. Kitty is a good hand at making tea. Poor soul, she is so anxious about comforts. She is a kind creature, Kitty is.</p>
               <p>That night he dreams of dear—sweet—lost Alison. He is in trouble. She is always with him then. Her own sweet, melancholy countenance tenance, steals upon him in the visions of the night. Her look melts with tenderness. Surely she is still his guardian angel, warding off the evils that hover round him. He sees snakes upon the bed clothes, endeavouring to bite him. He thinks he knows some of them, for they have the same faces as some of his clerical brotherhood.</p>
               <p>H, awakes half melted away with excitement. He does not sleep again that night. The images that thrust themselves upon him are anything but agreeable.</p>
               <p>In his morning walk, he meets two of his clerical antagonists, who appear a little more friendly than on the preceding day. Still there is an unpleasant, suspicious look about them, which he does not like. After a few ordinary remarks, one of them abruptly asks him where he comes from, and how did he become acquainted with the Bishop.</p>
               <p>He turned off the conversation with a laugh, merely remarking, that as they felt so interested in his welfare—for which he was laid under great obligation to them—they had better ask<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC5589-00000163"/> his Lordship; that he would take it very kindly to be allowed to give an account of all, or any of his transactions to them.</p>
               <p>They were too impudent to know that they were so. They did not, therefore, feel ashamed, but coldly bade him good morning.</p>
               <p>Maclaren hastened home with a crimsoned face and a palpitating heart. He wrote a long and earnest letter to his old friend, Edward Keyworth, stating all that had passed, and soliciting his consent to resign his curacy. The tender and affectionate old man replied at once. He regretted that his clerical brethren should treat him so unkindly. He could not, however, say that he was at all astonished at their conduct. It was, he observed, as common as it was hateful—an every day occurrence. He counselled him to be as prompt as possible in the execution of his design.</p>
               <p>On the following Sunday he preached his last sermon to a crowded and weeping congregation. The scene of that memorable Sabbath will never be erased from the memory of those that witnessed it. Many were the tokens of Christian love that he carried away with him from the parish, and many were the sincere prayers offered for his safety in life and joy in death.</p>
               <p>His enemies were greatly disappointed. They had fully anticipated the diabolical gratification of driving him away in disgrace;—an ordinary specimen of brotherly love!</p>
               <p>From a quiet country parish, it was his misfortune to become a curate to a most ungodly man, in a large district church of a populous city. His incumbent was too unwell to preach, and too poor to pay a curate. He was an <emph>old young man</emph>. He carried the badge of discipleship in his face. No one could mistake the master he served. The roof of his mouth was partly gone. His eldest son was never known to have entered the church. The others did as they liked. His daughters, poor creatures, were good girls, and looked like pure angels, under the guardianship of a demon. He had driven away his congregation—or rather the congregation he found there—by his many infirmities—to use no<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC5589-00000164"/> harsher term—rendered odious in the extreme by his intolerable self-conceit.</p>
               <p>Maclaren was gradually filling the church with a very respectable congregation. Several of the old members returned. His preaching pleased and edified them. His incumbent pretended to be pleased—bowed and scraped, and was all kindness.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, he was in correspondence with Mr. Maclaren's enemies in the country, leaving no stone unturned that might help them to accomplish his ruin.</p>
               <p>All was now ready, and nothing less than his utter destruction would satisfy them. It was found, however, that he was not licensed to the curacy, and consequently could not be called before the Bishop.</p>
               <p>In a kinder way than usual, his incumbent goes with him to the Bishop, and he is licensed and in their power. In a few days they commence proceedings. Maclaren knows nothing about it, and is hard at work in the parish.</p>
               <p>One morning at breakfast, he is surprised by his faithful old friend, Edward Keyworth, who had accidentally discovered the plot. He told him to resign his curacy at once, that it was his only safety. Ere Mr. Keyworth leaves for the country, an anonymous letter is received, signed "<hi rend="i"/>A Friend." It counsels an immediate resignation. Was it a friend that sent it, was now the eager inquiry. After much hesitation, it was agreed that it must have come from a true friend. It was afterwards discovered to have been written by the incumbent!</p>
               <p>The resignation was sent in at once. The incumbent declared that he could not accept it; that Mr. Maclaren's case was before the Bishop. This was the first real intimation he had of his being expected to appear before his Lordship. Even now he was ignorant of the charges preferred against him. He was not friendless though. The congregation felt for him, and showed their sympathy in the strongest—though, perhaps, not the most judicious manner.</p>
               <p>It is a cold, wet night in January. Maclaren is spending the evening at the Church Warden's<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC5589-00000165"/> den's,—a noble fellow that old churchwarden! He was one of nature's aristocracy. He had a son just shooting into life. The father was proud of him. He was Maclaren's favourite. The father felt that he had a father's heart, and that the fatherless Maclaren claimed his protection. Dear old Christian; he could only show his sympathy by praying and weeping in silence, while his friend was butchered before his eyes.</p>
               <p>There is a loud rap at the door. It is the incumbent, accompanied by a minister from the country, wishing to see the churchwarden.</p>
               <p>"Come in, sir," was the polite rejoinder.</p>
               <p>"Is there any one with him?"</p>
               <p>"Only Mr. Maclaren."</p>
               <p>The incumbent cast an imploring look at the country minister, who said with a quivering lip, as if the real character of his nefarious message had just then told him that he was a man, though acting the part of a fiend—"Let us go."</p>
               <p>"Tell your uncle," continued the incumbent, to the girl, "that this gentleman is Mr. Scory, a respectable Dissenting minister that has just come from the country to identify Mr. Maclaren."</p>
               <p>"Why," said the poor girl, trembling all over, "he cannot have a better opportunity than now."</p>
               <p>"No, no. I won't go," cried Scory, nervously.</p>
               <p>The scene in the hall of the old mansion, and the bloodless duel may have intimidated him.</p>
               <p>The courageous boy must be a rather formidable antagonist, in the pride of manhood.</p>
               <p>When Archibald was told that it was Scory, he could hardly help laughing, sad as he was.</p>
               <p>It was, however, a fearful moment for the poor fellow. It was evident to him that justice—to say nothing of mercy—was to have no share in the approaching trial. All his enemies leagued with those whom he thought his friends, were against him. Even the professor at the college, had, it appeared, been indefatigable in systematically persecuting him for the last<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC5589-00000166"/> seven years. It came out before the bishop that he was incessantly engaged in writing anonymous letters, &amp;c., one of which the writer of these pages has now in his possession—designed to injure Archibald's character. His old chum, too, to whom he had shown special kindness, was engaged in the same work, because, I suppose, he thought he would ingratiate himself more and more with the <hi rend="i"/>great man of the college, and the great man of the mill, his first patrons. It is said that when Christ was tried, Herod and Pilate became friends. When Maclaren was before as a <choice>
                     <sic>tyranical</sic>
                     <corr>tyrannical</corr>
                  </choice> and as an unjust tribunal, the rankest dissenters, and the <choice>
                     <sic>hotest</sic>
                     <corr>hottest</corr>
                  </choice> Puseyites came together in a friendly alliance. And for what important purpose? To close the mouth of a young minister, whom the devil thought and felt, was doing too much good, in a single diocese. All they could do, after all their labour, was to revoke Maclaren's license. What a miserable conquest? Could the tyrant do no more? Yes they could and did show publicly that he was a man, to crush whom the loss of their own characters was not too dear a sacrifice fice. They published some of the most infamous and libellous falsehoods that ever disgraced the English or any other press. Archibald did not deign to show a similar spirit, by persecuting them in return, though entirely to his mercy. He did not want their money. They knew that. They found, too, to their mortification, that his contempt for them was of that deep and quiet character most intolerable to spirits panting for notoriety.</p>
               <p>Archibald is once more at the rectory with his good and faithful old friend, Keyworth. He never found retirement half so sweet before. Could he but know all about his dear Alison? Was there no means of finding her out? He made known his anxieties respecting her to his old friend. Anxious to beguile his young guest from the thoughts of his late misfortunes, he at once volunteered to secure all the information that could be obtained respecting her. Archibald remained at the Rectory, and took charge of the parish in his friend's absence. The parishioners paid him great attention. They felt grateful to Mr. Keyworth for providing<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC5589-00000167"/> ing such a substitute. How anxious must the old gentleman be for the welfare of his parishioners? It was generally reported, that the young man was very wealthy—a near relative of the rector, likely to remain with him as his curate; and was—it was said upon good authority to be his successor. Archibald was more amused than otherwise, at his growing importance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keyworth's prolonged absence made him fearfully nervous. He must be detained by something of a very unpleasant nature, or he would communicate with him. The butler receives a letter from his master to meet him with the carriage at the neighbouring town. The old servant, with a countenance radiant with joy, tells Archibald that his dear master will be home that evening.</p>
               <p>A quivered lip and a suppressed sigh, were the only answer. The old butler wonders what could be the matter. How a wealthy and respectable young gentleman could be so unhappy!</p>
               <p>Archibald walked into the garden and wondered dered whether he should ever possess such a garden, and become an object of so much joy and respect as his dear friend Keyworth. My going or coming, he murmured to himself, mournfully, light up no countenance with joy. There is one, though, he continued in the same melancholy strain, whose face lighted up like that old man's face, would make an earthly paradise for me, but that dear, sweet face—he sighed heavily and sought for his pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>It was a sweet summer evening, and Archibald lay on the grass—surrounded by beautiful shrubs. The cool evening breeze, laden with perfumes, fanned his fevered brow and relieved his overlaboured brain.</p>
               <p>He starts from a melancholy reverie. His old friend's carriage is in sight, surrounded with a group of lovely and merry children who, having been told of his expected arrival, had gone to welcome him home. What a scene? What a proof of his old friend's goodness of heart and kindliness of feelings. On he comes half covered with wild flowers, the grateful<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC5589-00000168"/> and affectionate offerings of the pure hearts of childhood. He sees Archibald's heart in his face, grasps his trembling hand and says in as cheerful and encouraging a tone of voice as he possibly can, "Patience, Archie, and you may be happy yet. Alison is still single, perfectly restored, and loves you as much as—or more than—ever."</p>
               <p>Archibald sobbed, "God bless you, Keyworth. When did you see her? How did she look? Where does she live? When are we to meet? Nay, you have not the heart to deceive me. It must be true. Dear Alison, Oh, heaven! God bless you, Keyworth. How can I be grateful enough to you? God forgive me? I had in my ecstacy, forgotten to thank him first. What weak creatures we are? You are certain then, that you have not been misinformed? How very foolish in me, you could not, of course, could you?"</p>
               <p>"Come, come, my dear fellow," cried Keyworth, "let us go and have something to eat. I am hungry."</p>
               <p>"Well, yes," continued Archibald, "is she not beautiful, Keyworth? Did you ever see such an exquisite creature? Poor, dear, sweet, lost Alison! Who would have thought—. And you did really hear her speak, Keyworth? Did you not? Forgive my infirmity on this point, my dear friend. I feel in a fearful state of excitement."</p>
               <p>When Mr. Keyworth found himself alone, he burst into a flood of tears. He had never witnessed such a manifestation of tenderness and love before. It made him tremble at the thought of detailing all his adventures to Archibald.</p>
               <p>When, however, he met his young friend at tea, he was surprised to see him so calm and collected. Not a trace of his former excitement remained. He had been engaged in sweet communion with the Almighty. His face was radiant with thankfulness and joy.—Keyworth thought he had never seen such a noble expression of countenance before. It must surely be the right time to disclose the real state of affairs, for the heart, to which that face is an index, can bear anything.</p>
               <pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC5589-00000169"/>
               <p>He then briefly stated that he had a great difficulty to find out the doctor under whose care she had been placed. Everything had been so privately arranged, that it was with the greatest reluctancy that the medical man could be prevailed upon to afford any clue to her whereabouts. He stated that she was nearly two months under his care. She went from him to her friends, with whom she lived in the greatest privacy; that she had spent most of her fortune in employing men to find out her betrothed, a young man to whom she was foolishly attached, and towards whom her friends cherished the greatest hatred; that having failed to discover him, and having lost the remainder of her property through the failure of the bank in which it was placed, she set sail from Liverpool for America, determined to shift for herself to the utmost.</p>
               <p>"Poor dear Alison," exclaimed, Archibald, "so like her? What a sweet angel she is? Let me kneel and kiss your hand, Keyworth. God bless you, my dear friend."</p>
               <p>"What can I do for you? Name it? and I will do it, should it cost me all that I have."</p>
               <p>"No, no, Archibald, I am but too happy to serve you. All my success in life I must date to my first acquaintance with your family. You are dearer to me than any other being upon earth."</p>
               <p>But Archibald did give a very substantial proof of his gratitude to his friend before he left him. It was where they last stood face to face upon earth.</p>
               <p>In a day or two, Archibald was in Liverpool and had found out in what vessel poor Alison had sailed. He took a passage in a vessel bound for the same port, and in less than a week he had bid farewell to the land of his birth, and the scenes of his misfortunes. Ere he left he resumed his old name—gave away every article that could remind him of the other—bought a splendid out-fit, clearly marked with the name that dear Alison loved—Archibald Cameron—and felt grateful that things were not worse.</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>DEAR Cameron!—how buoyant and manly he looks, as with a firm step he paces the deck of the noble boat that bears him away from his enemies to his love. Still <emph>the man of one idea</emph>, he endeavours to do good among the sailors, by giving them tracts, and directing them to follow the path of virtue, as the only means of obtaining true happiness. On Sundays, he prevails upon the captain to allow him to preach. With his fellow-passengers, though at first regarded as somewhat eccentric, he became a great favourite. His exhaustless fund of information, and the judiciousness of his remarks upon all the subjects introduced during the voyage, made a sceptical young passenger cherish a boundless admiration of his talents. He ultimately acknowledged his error, and, it; is to be hoped, repented of his sins.</p>
               <p>It was, evident, however, throughout, that the vessel was not his home, nor his fellow-passengers the kind of people that he would have chosen for his friends. He was often restless and melancholy, for which his fellow-passengers could not account. He often spoke of the voyage as being a very long one. Every one else thought it remarkably short; and the captain, as they neared the port, declared it the shortest he had ever made. Being rallied upon his restlessness, young Cameron said that life ought to be measured by the number of the ideas that pass through our minds, and that so many new ideas had passed through his mind—for which he confessed himself indebted to the intelligent society on board—that he thought the voyage almost as long as the former part of his life. This complimentary remark brightened up every face, and every body felt more than satisfied with the explanation.</p>
               <p>The medical man, with whom he was a<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC5589-00000171"/> great favourite, advised him to go ashore at once, and call in the best medical gentleman in the city; that he feared he might have a slight attack of the fever prevalent among Europeans on their first landing in the New World.</p>
               <p>Archibald had been delighted with the view, as he came up the Delaware, and thought that every house he saw was a little paradise. "Who knows," he said to himself, "but that that rural cottage may be the residence of dear Alison."</p>
               <p>As soon as he got on shore, he drove to the first hotel in the city. How green and beautiful he thought the trees looked in the streets; so different from the narrow, crowded streets of cities in old England. Still old England was a fine place—the first country in the world.</p>
               <p>He thought his hotel comfortable, though he was somewhat astonished to find it disgraced with a barber's shop, and a crowd of loungers, some sitting with their feet as high as their heads, others walking about in their morning dresses, with <hi rend="i"/>care-for-nobody-looking faces; while a third party talked of politics, and with their hats on one side of their heads, looked marvellously independent to an educated aristocrat of the old country.</p>
               <p>He feels his head unaccountably heavy. A cold, shivering sensation creeps up his back. His eyes are remarkably weak and tender. Every woman he sees reminds him of dear Alison.</p>
               <p>He, on a sudden, remembers the advice he received before leaving the ship, and at once tells ALIC, his faithful travelling servant, to send for the doctor—the best in town.</p>
               <p>Poor Alic obeys, and his broad Scotch accent provokes the laughter of the black-faced waiters, with which the house is positively swarming. Job's patience is not Alic's inheritance. He grows awfully savage; and as a specimen of what a Scotchman can do, handles one of his new acquaintances so roughly, that the rest become extremely civil and obliging to him. A doctor is at once procured, and Cameron is declared dangerously ill with the brain fever.<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC5589-00000172"/> The news goes through the house like lightning, that the Rev. Archibald Cameron, a young clergyman from England, has just arrived, and is taken dangerously ill with the brain fever. The doctor sits up with him all night. He is quite <choice>
                     <sic>delirous</sic>
                     <corr>delirious</corr>
                  </choice>, and must be held in bed. He is constantly calling out, "Alison, dear Alison." The doctor asks Alic whether his master is a married man?</p>
               <p>Alic answers him in the negative.</p>
               <p>He is asked again where his master comes from? What part of the old country he resided in?</p>
               <p>Alic won't tell. His master is rich enough, and he has no need to fear but that he will be paid.</p>
               <p>The doctor humours him, and tries to find out who this Miss Alison is of whom he talks so much.</p>
               <p>Alic thinks he will be wise, and won't tell him.</p>
               <p>The doctor looks savage. Alic can look savage too.</p>
               <p>The doctor looks at Alic with contempt.— Alic draws near his master, takes hold of his dry, fevered hand, and eyes the doctor with haughty disdain.</p>
               <p>The patient breaks out again, Alison! Alison, dear Alison.</p>
               <p>Alic begins to cry, and asks the doctor whether it would not be better to send for another medical man, that his dear master was evidently growing worse.</p>
               <p>The doctor takes out his watch, counts the pulse, and declares him better, but not quite out of danger.</p>
               <p>Alic's incredulous look provokes the great man's indignation, and he orders him out of the room.</p>
               <p>Alic won't go. He would die for his dear master, but he won't leave him.</p>
               <p>Well then, said the doctor kindly, if you tell me who this Alison is, I'll let you remain?</p>
               <p>Rather than going out, Alic confesses his ignorance, tells the doctor in plain terms that he knows but very little of his master's affairs, and concludes by asserting that his dear<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC5589-00000173"/> master was too good to be in love with any one.</p>
               <p>The doctor poohed and looked at the patient.</p>
               <p>It was evident that Alic had greatly lowered himself by confessing his ignorance. He felt sorry he had done so. On his part, he feared that he had betrayed a great weakness of character, quite unworthy of a Scotchman, and a servant of Mr. Cameron. He never could forgive himself, nor love the doctor.</p>
               <p>The doctor, though he had never seen Cameron before, knew more of his marvellous history than his conceited servant did.</p>
               <p>The landlord peeps in to ask how the gentleman is, and whether he is out of danger yet?</p>
               <p>The doctor examines him again, and declares him quite out of danger, but that his recovery will be rather tedious. The landlord smiles and is glad to hear it. He <choice>
                     <sic>askes</sic>
                     <corr>asks</corr>
                  </choice> the doctor whether he had not better call in a nurse.</p>
               <p>Not at all, replies the great man, knowingly, I think I know something of this young gentleman, and can procure an acquaintance of his for his nurse.</p>
               <p>Alic was thunderstruck, and looked confounded.</p>
               <p>The doctor smiled at him, and told him to take good care of his master, that he would be back in a few minutes with a nurse for him.</p>
               <p>The doctor was a man of prodigious knowledge, and what was still rarer, knew how to use it. He was also a good man—a man of great benevolence. His head strikingly resembled that of John Howard, the great philanthropist.</p>
               <p>When she arrived in the city, poor Alison advertised for a place as governess. The doctor had an only daughter, in a delicate state of health, and for whom he wanted a companion. He answered Alison's advertisement, and was so highly pleased with her, and so affected by her touching story, that he regarded her more as a member of the family than as a hireling.</p>
               <p>As a man of benevolence, how grateful, and yet how painful the message, he had to deliver to the despairing and friendless Alison.</p>
               <p>With a delicacy and tenderness, that none but a Christian gentleman could have conceived,<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC5589-00000174"/> he took her to his study—told her that he had good news for her, but that like all that was earthly, it had a tinge of the sorrowful about it. She looked through him—put her hand upon his arm—her eyes still fixed upon him—it trembled violently. She was evidently struggling with her weakness. At length, with a face mantled with light, that could scarcely be defined, so intermixed with joy and sorrow, hope and fear, she whispered, as if half afraid of being heard, You have seen Archibald. He is in town and is sick. Oh, my God, leave me my reason.</p>
               <p>The doctor rang the bell—told the servant to send in his wife immediately. Alison soon recovered her consciousness. They all three knelt down, while the doctor offered a most touching and comprehensive prayer, in which he thanked God for his providential care over his creatures, for the peculiar manner in which he led the orphan under his roof—for the safe arrival of her betrothed and her protector—for the favourable turn his indisposition had taken, and for the strong hope that existed of his speedy restoration, concluding in an earnest petition for strength adequate to the mysterious occasion.</p>
               <p>All was known now. Alison rose from her knees with marvellous coolness and self-control. Still there was a great struggle within, which the lightning of her eye, every now and then, betrayed.</p>
               <p>They were not long in entering the sick chamber. As they approach the room, through the long gloomy corridor, all is silent, save, when as they pass from door to door, the strong breathing of some heavy sleeper startles them.</p>
               <p>At length the quick eye of Alison discovers the light through the half-closed door, she nervously clings with both hands to the arm of her leader. He, too, feels quite unmanned. He is perfectly familiar with scenes of sickness and death. But here is something new. His breathing quickens as they come near the light. He involuntarily throws his arm round his companion. It is just in time. It saves her from falling. He gently whispers, "be strong, my girl." She hears him not. He<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC5589-00000175"/> carries her to the room, and lays her near the bed. The sick man sleeps heavily. Alison puts her hand upon her forehead, as if it helped her to collect herself.</p>
               <p>"Alison, dear Al—." The answer was near—it was pressing.</p>
               <p>"Archie, dear."</p>
               <p>"Dear Alison."</p>
               <p>Alic hid his face in his hands.</p>
               <p>The doctor covered his with his pocket handkerchief, Alison was weeping bitterly on her lover's bosom.</p>
               <p>Archibald's arm was round her neck. Her cheek resting on his cheek—her tears falling fast and copious, and welling his into a sweet memorial of their mutual sympathy, attachment, and gratitude.</p>
               <p>Archibald's recovery was, as predicted, long and tedious. But no complaint escaped from either. They were all thankfulness. Alison never left him. With inimitable tenderness she attended to his every wish. As soon as he was pronounced strong enough to be removed, they rented a furnished residence on the bank of the Delaware, and mysterious enough, the identical cottage in which he had thought in coming up that noble river his own dear Alison perhaps lived, but which, on a nearer approach, proved to be a commodious mansion, in the simplest style of English architecture.</p>
               <p>About a quarter of a mile from their residence might be seen, the modest spire of a lovely country church, half buried among sturdy old oaks. There, the holy man bound their guileless hearts in holy matrimony. Theirs was holy indeed. Thrice holy—ratified in heaven. What a love was theirs? The first and only love on both sides. They have long since quitted the retirement of a country life—though most dear to both—for a larger sphere of usefulness, in one of the most populous of the American cities. Between such hearts there is no love lost. There is, too, a young Archibald. He is his doting mother's right eye—so manly—intelligent, and good. He is his dear father all over. And there is that father's pet, little Alison—-sweet creature—all beauty, tenderness, patience and love. Her unequalled mother won't die while little Alison lives. There never was such a child, save one whom his own hands<pb n="352" xml:id="VAC5589-00000176"/> —the best task they ever performed—rescued from death. Such a being could not die! The world had too great a need of such a pure holy being to leave behind her something like herself to cover with her shining virtues the many infirmities of her sex.</p>
               <p>Archibald Cameron, still the <emph>man of one idea</emph>, is wholly given to the work of the ministry—the cherished object of his mother's ambition—the work to which he was consecrated from his childhood, and which, notwithstanding the difficulties thrown in his way, he never abandoned, even in thought.</p>
               <p>His life, though much chequered, has been a very useful one, and latterly a very happy one. Hundreds of souls have reason to bless the day of his birth.</p>
               <p>Alic is still with him, and is his clerk. He, too, is married and has a large family. He often talks of the sick room, the doctor's knowingness and kindness, the delirious patient and his lovely nurse. <q>
