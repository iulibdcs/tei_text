            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT was the intention of the author to have given this book to the world during the
               course of the past season, but unforeseen occurrences have prevented the
               accomplishment of her purpose. She no longer regrets the delay, as she believes it
               will meet a more cordial reception at the present time.</p>
            <p>When individual or public feeling is too highly wrought on any subject, there must
               inevitably follow a reaction, and reason, recovering from the effects of transient
               inebriation, is ready to assert its original sovereignty.</p>
            <p>Not in the spirit of egotism, do we repeat what was said in the preface of a former
               work, that we were born at the North, and though destiny has removed us far from our
               native scenes, we cherish for them a sacred regard, an undying attachment.<pb
                  n="iv-v" xml:id="VAC6694-00000003"/> It cannot therefore be supposed that we are
               actuated by hostility or prejudice, in endeavouring to represent the unhappy
               consequences of that intolerant and fanatical spirit, whose fatal influence we so
               deeply deplore.</p>
            <p>We believe that there are a host of noble, liberal minds, of warm, generous, candid
               hearts, at the North, that will bear us out in our views of Southern character, and
               that feel with us that our <emph>national</emph> honour is tarnished, when a portion
               of our country is held up to public disgrace and foreign insult, by those, too, whom
               every feeling of patriotism should lead to defend it from ignominy and shield it from
               dishonour. The hope that they will appreciate and do justice to our motives, has
               imparted enthusiasm to our feelings, and energy to our will, in the prosecution of
               our literary labour.</p>
            <p>When we have seen the dark and horrible pictures drawn of slavery and exhibited to a
               gazing world, we have wondered if we were one of those favoured individuals to whom
               the fair side of life is ever turned, or whether we were created with a moral
               blindness, incapable of distinguishing its lights and shadows. One thing is certain,
               and if we were on judicial oath we would repeat it, that during our residence in the
               South, we have never <emph>witnessed</emph> one scene of cruelty or oppression, never
               beheld a chain or a manacle, or the infliction of a punishment more severe than
               parental authority would be justified in applying to filial disobedience or
               transgression. This is not owing to our being placed in a limited sphere of
               observation, for we have seen and studied domestic, social, and plantation life, in
               Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. We have been admitted into close and
               familiar communion with numerous families in each of these States, not merely as a
               passing visiter, but as an indwelling guest, and we have never been pained by an
               inhuman exercise of authority, or a wanton abuse of power.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, we have been touched and gratified by the exhibition of affectionate
               kindness and care on one side, and loyal and devoted attachment on the other. We have
               been especially struck with the cheerfulness and contentment of the slaves, and their
               usually elastic and buoyant spirits. From the abundant opportunities we have had of
               judging, we give it as our honest belief, that the negroes of the South are<pb
                  n="vi-vii" xml:id="VAC6694-00000004"/> the happiest <emph>labouring class</emph>
               on the face of the globe; even subtracting from their portion of enjoyment all that
               can truly be said of their trials and sufferings. The fugitives who fly to the
               Northern States are no proof against the truth of this statement. They have most of
               them been made disaffected by the influence of others—tempted by promises which are
               seldom fulfilled. Even in the garden of Eden, the seeds of discontent and rebellion
               were sown; surely we need not wonder that they sometimes take root in the beautiful
               groves of the South.</p>
            <p>In the large cities we have <emph>heard</emph> of families who were cruel to their
               slaves, as well as unnaturally severe in the discipline of their children. (Are there
               no similar instances at the North?) But the indignant feeling which any known
               instance of inhumanity calls forth at the South, proves that they are not of common
               occurrence.</p>
            <p>We have conversed a great deal with the coloured people, feeling the deepest interest
               in learning their own views of their peculiar situation, and we have almost
               invariably been delighted and affected by their humble devotion to their master's
               family, their child-like, affectionate reliance on their care and protection, and
               above all, with their genuine cheerfulness and contentment.</p>
            <p>This very morning, since commencing these remarks, our sympathies have been strongly
               moved by the simple eloquence of a negro woman in speaking of her former master and
               mistress, who have been dead for many years.</p>
            <p>"Oh!" said she, her eyes swimming with tears, and her voice choking with emotion, "I
               loved my master and mistress like my own soul. If I could have died in their stead, I
               would gladly done it. I would have gone into the grave and brought them up, if the
               Lord had let me do it. Oh! they were so good—so kind. All on us black folks would
               'ave laid down our lives for 'em at any minute."</p>
            <p>"Then you were happy?" we said; "you did not sigh to be free?"</p>
            <p>"No, mistress, that I didn't. I was too well off for that. I wouldn't have left my
               master and mistress for all the freedom in the world. I'd left my own father and
               mother first. I loved 'em better than I done them. I loved their children too. Every
               one of 'em has been babies in<pb n="viii-ix" xml:id="VAC6694-00000005"/> my arms—and
               I loved 'em a heap better than I done my own, I want to stay with 'em as long as I
               live, and I know they will take care of me when I get too old to work."</p>
            <p>These are her own words. We have not sought this simple instance of faithful and
               enduring love. It came to us as if in corroboration of our previous remarks, and we
               could not help recording it.</p>
            <p>The history of Crissy and the circumstances of her abduction are true.</p>
            <p>The character of Dr. Darley is drawn from life. Though death has now set the seal of
               eternity on his virtues, we would not violate the sanctity of private life by
               bringing his real name before the public. Should those he loved best on earth
               recognise the lineaments we have attempted to draw, may they accept this imperfect
               tribute to his exalted worth, his brilliant and commanding talents, as well as his
               pure and genuine philanthropy.</p>
            <p>Many of the circumstance we have recorded in these pages are founded on truth. The
               plot of the insurrection, the manner in which it was instigated and detected, and the
               brief history of Nat, the giant, with his domestication in a Northern family, are
               literally true.</p>
            <p>If any one should think the affection manifested by the slaves of Moreland for their
               master is too highly coloured, we would refer them to the sketch of Thomas
               Jefferson's arrival at Monticello on his return from Paris, after an absence of five
               years. It is from the pen of his daughter, and no one will doubt its
               authenticity.</p>
            <p>"The negroes discovered the approach of the carriage as soon as it reached Shadwell,
               and such a scene I never witnessed in my life. They collected in crowds around it,
               and almost drew it up the mountain by hand. The shouting, &amp;c., had been
               sufficiently obstreperous before, but the moment the carriage arrived on the top it
               reached the climax. When the door of the carriage was opened, they received him in
               their arms and bore him into the house, crowding around, kissing his hands and feet,
               some blubbering and crying, others laughing. It appeared impossible to satisfy their
               eyes, or their anxiety to touch, and even to kiss the very earth that bore him. These
               were the first ebullitions of joy for his return, after a long absence, which they
               would of course<pb n="x-xi" xml:id="VAC6694-00000006"/> feel; but it is perhaps not
               out of place to add here, that they were at all times very devoted in their
               attachment to their master. They believed him to be one of the greatest, and they
               knew him to be one of the best of men, and kindest of masters. They spoke to him
               freely, and applied confidingly to him in all their difficulties and distresses; and
               he watched over them in sickness and health; interested himself in all their
               concerns; advising them, and showing esteem and confidence in the good, and
               indulgence to all."</p>
            <p>We can add nothing, to this simple, pathetic description. Monticello is hallowed
               ground, and the testimony that proceeds from its venerated retreat should be listened
               to with respect and confidence. The same accents might be heard from Mount Vernon's
               august shades, where the grave of Washington has been bedewed by the tears of the
               grateful African.</p>
            <p>But we have done.</p>
            <p>If we fail to accomplish the purpose for which we have written, we shall at least
               have the consolation of knowing that our motives are disinterested, and our aim
               patriotic and true.</p>
            <p>Should no Northern heart respond to our earnest nest appeal, we trust the voice of
               the South will answer to our own, not in a faint, cold, dying echo, but in a full,
               spontaneous strain, whose reverberations shall reach to the green hills and granite
               cliffs of New England's "rock-bound coast."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>MR. MORELAND, a Southern planter, was travelling through the New England States in
                  the bright season of a Northern spring. Business with some of the merchant princes
                  of Boston had brought him to the North; but a desire to become familiar with the
                  beautiful surroundings of the metropolis induced him to linger long after it was
                  transacted, to gratify the taste and curiosity of an intelligent and liberal mind.
                  He was rich and independent, had leisure as well as wealth at his command, and
                  there was something in the deep green fields and clear blue waters of New England
                  that gave a freshness, and brightness, and elasticity to his spirits, wanting in
                  his milder, sunnier latitude.</p>
               <p>He found himself one Saturday night in a sweet country village, whose boundaries
                  were marked by the<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6694-00000008"/> most luxuriant
                  shubbery and trees, in the midst of which a thousand silver rills were gushing. He
                  was pleased with the prospect of passing the ensuing Sunday in a valley so serene
                  and quiet, that it seemed as if Nature enjoyed in its shades the repose of an
                  eternal Sabbath. The inn where he stopped was a neat, orderly place, and though
                  the landlord impressed him, at first, as a hard, repulsive looking man, with a
                  dark, Indian face, and large, iron-bound frame, he found him ready to perform all
                  the duties of a host. Requesting to be shown to a private apartment, he ordered
                  Albert, a young mulatto, who accompanied him on his journey, to follow him with
                  his valise. Albert was a handsome, golden-skinned youth, with shining black hair
                  and eyes, dressed very nearly as genteelly as his master, and who generally
                  attracted more attention on their Northern tour. Accustomed to wait on his master
                  and listen to the conversation of refined and educated gentlemen, he had very
                  little of the dialect of the negro, and those familiar with the almost
                  unintelligible jargon which delineators of the sable character put into their
                  lips, could not but be astonished at the propriety of his language and
                  pronunciation.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Moreland started on his journey to the North, his friends endeavoured to
                  dissuade him from taking a servant with him, as he would incur the danger of
                  losing him among the granite hills to which he was bound:—they especially warned
                  him of the risk of taking Albert, whose superior intelligence and cultivation
                  would render him more accessible to the arguments which would probably be brought
                  forward to lure him from his allegiance.</p>
               <p>"I defy all the eloquence of the North to induce Albert to leave me," exclaimed
                  Mr. Moreland. "Let them do it if they can. Albert," he said, calling the boy to
                  him, who was busily employed in brushing and polishing his master's boots, with a
                  friction quick enough to create sparkles of light. "Albert,—I am going to the
                  North,—would you like to go with me?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure I would, master, I would like to go anywhere in the world with
                  you."</p>
               <p>"You know the people are all free at the North, Albert."</p>
               <p>"Yes, master.</p>
               <p>"And when you are there, they will very likely try to persuade you that you are
                  free too, and tell you it is your duty to run away from me, and set up for a
                  gentleman yourself. What do you think of all this?"</p>
               <p>Albert suspended his brush in the air, drew up his left shoulder with a
                  significant shrug, darted an oblique glance at his master from his bright black
                  eyes, and then renewed his friction with accelerated velocity.</p>
               <p>"Well, my boy, you have not answered me," cried Mr. Moreland, in a careless, yet
                  interested manner, peculiar to himself.</p>
               <p>"Why, you see, Mars. Russell (when he addressed his<pb n="16-17"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000009"/> master by his Christian name, he always abbreviated
                  his title in this manner, though when the name was omitted he uttered the title in
                  all its dignity),—"you see, Mars. Russell,"—here the mulatto slipped the boot from
                  his arm, placed it on the floor, and still retaining the brush in his right hand,
                  folded his arms across his breast, and spoke deliberately and earnestly,—"they
                  couldn't come round this boy with that story; I've hearn it often enough already;
                  I ain't afraid of anything they can say and do, to get me away from you as long as
                  you want me to stay with you. But if you are afraid to trust me, master, that's
                  another thing. You'd better leave me, if you think I'd be mean enough to run
                  away."</p>
               <p>"Well said, Albert!" exclaimed Mr. Moreland, laughing at the air of injured honour
                  and conscious self-appreciation he assumed; "I do trust you, and shall surely take
                  you with me; you can make yourself very amusing to the people, by telling them of
                  your home frolics, such as being chained, handcuffed, scourged, flayed, and burned
                  alive, and all those little trifles they are so much interested in."</p>
               <p>"Oh! master, I wish I may find everybody as well off as I am. If there's no lies
                  told on you but what I tell, you'll be mighty safe, I know. Ever since Miss
                  Claudia"—</p>
               <p>"Enough," cried Mr. Moreland, hastily interrupting him. He had breathed a name
                  which evidently awakened painful recollections, for his sunshiny countenance
                  became came suddenly dark and cold. Albert, who seemed familiar with his master's
                  varying moods, respectfully resumed his occupation, while Mr. Moreland took up his
                  hat and plunged into the soft, balmy atmosphere of a Southern spring morning.</p>
               <p>It is not our intention to go back and relate the past history of Mr. Moreland. It
                  will be gathered in the midst of unfolding events, at least all that is necessary
                  for the interest of our story. We will therefore return to the white-walled inn of
                  the fair New England village, where our traveller was seated, enjoying the long,
                  dewy twilight of the new region in which he was making a temporary rest. The sun
                  had gone down, but the glow of his parting smile lingered on the landscape and
                  reddened the stream that gleamed and flashed through the distant shrubbery. Not
                  far from the inn, on a gradual eminence, rose the village church, whose tall
                  spire, surmounted by a horizontal vane, reposed on the golden clouds of sunset,
                  resembling the crucifix of some gorgeous cathedral. This edifice was situated far
                  back from the road, surrounded by a common of the richest green, in the centre of
                  which rose the swelling mound, consecrated by the house of God. Some very handsome
                  buildings were seen at regular intervals, on either side of the road, among which
                  the court-house stood conspicuous, with its freestone-coloured wall and lofty
                  cupola. There was something in the aspect of that church, with its
                  heaven-ascending spire, whose glory-crown of lingering<pb n="18-19"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000010"/> ing day-beams glittered with a kind of celestial
                  splendour, reminding him of the halo which encircles the brows of saints;
                  something in the deep tranquillity of the hour, the soft, hazy, undulating outline
                  of the distant horizon, the swaying motion of the tall poplars that margined the
                  street far as his eye could reach, and through whose darkening vista a solitary
                  figure gradually lessened on the eye, that solemnized and even saddened the
                  spirits of our traveller. The remembrances of early youth and opening manhood
                  pressed upon him with suddenly awakened force. Hopes, on which so sad and awful a
                  blight had fallen, raised themselves like faded flowers sprinkled with dew, and
                  mocked him with their visionary bloom. In the excitement of travelling, the
                  realities of business, the frequent collision of interests, the championship of
                  oft invaded rights, he had lost much of that morbidness of feeling and
                  restlessness of character, which, being more accidental than inherent, would
                  naturally yield to the force of circumstances counter to those in which they were
                  born. But at the close of any arbitrary division of time, such as the last day of
                  the week or the year, the mind is disposed to deeper meditation, and the mental
                  burden, whose weight has been equipoised by worldly six-day cares, rolls back upon
                  the mind with leaden oppression.</p>
               <p>Moreland had too great a respect for the institutions of religion, too deep an
                  inner sense of its power, to think of continuing his journey on the Sabbath, and
                  he was glad that the chamber which he occupied looked out upon that serene
                  landscape, and that the morning shadow of the lofty church-spire would be thrown
                  across his window. It seemed to him he had seen this valley before, with its
                  beautiful green, grassy slopes, its sunset-gilded church, and dark poplar avenue.
                  And it seemed to him also, that he had seen a fair maiden form gliding through the
                  central aisle of that temple, in robes of virgin white, and soft, down-bending
                  eyes of dark brown lustre, and brow of moonlight calmness. It was one of those dim
                  reminiscences, those vague, dream-like consciousnesses of a previous existence,
                  which every being of poetic temperament is sometimes aware of, and though they
                  come, faint shadows of a far-off world, quick and vanishing as lightning, they
                  nevertheless leave certain traces of their presence, "trails of glory," as a great
                  poet has called them, proceeding from the spirit's home.</p>
               <p>While he sat leaning in silence against the window frame, the bell of the church
                  began to toll slowly and solemnly, and as the sounds rolled heavily and gloomily
                  along, then reverberated and vibrated with melancholy prolongation, sending out a
                  sad, dying echo, followed by another majestic, startling peal, he wondered to hear
                  such a funeral knell at that twilight hour, and looked up the shadowy line of
                  poplars for the dark procession leading to the grave. Nothing was seen, however,
                  and nothing heard but those monotonous, heavy, mournful peals, which seemed to
                  sweep by him with the flaps of<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6694-00000011"/> the
                  raven's wings. Twenty times the bell tolled, and then all was still.</p>
               <p>"What means the tolling of the bell?" asked he of the landlord, who was walking
                  beneath the window. "Is there a funeral at this late hour?"</p>
               <p>"A young woman has just died," replied the landlord. "They are tolling her age. It
                  is a custom of our village."</p>
               <p>Moreland drew back with a shudder. Just twenty. That was <emph>her</emph> age.
                     <emph>She</emph> had not died, and yet the death-bell might well ring a deeper
                  knell over her than the being who had just departed. In the grave the remembrance
                  of the bitterest wrongs are buried, and the most vindictive cease to thirst for
                  vengeance. Moreland was glad when a summons to supper turned his thoughts into a
                  different channel.</p>
               <p>There might have been a dozen men seated around the table, some whose dress and
                  manners proclaimed that they were gentlemen, others evidently of a coarser grain.
                  They all looked up at the entrance of Moreland, who, with a bow, such as the
                  courteous stranger is always ready to make, took his seat, while Albert placed
                  himself behind his master's chair.</p>
               <p>"Take a seat," said Mr. Grimby, the landlord, looking at Albert. "There's one by
                  the gentleman. Plenty of room for us all."<ref rend="super" target="#note_001"
                     xml:id="return_001">*</ref>
                  
               </p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_001">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_001">*</ref>A fact.</p>
               </note>
               <p>"My boy will wait," cried Mr. Moreland, with unconscious conscious haughtiness,
                  while his pale cheek visibly reddened. "I would thank you to leave the arrangement
                  of such things to myself."</p>
               <p>"No offence, I hope, sir," rejoined Mr. Grimby. "We look upon everybody here as
                  free and equal. This is a free country, and when folks come among us we don't see
                  why they can't conform to our ways of thinking. There's a proverb that says—'when
                  you're with the Romans, it's best to do as the Romans do.'"</p>
               <p>"Am I to understand," said Mr. Moreland, fixing his eye deliberately on his
                  Indian-visaged host, "that you wish my servant to sit down with yourself and these
                  gentlemen?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure I do," replied the landlord, winking his small black eye knowingly at
                  his left-hand neighbour. "I don't see why he isn't as good as the rest of us. I'm
                  an enemy to all distinctions myself, and I'd like to bring everybody round to my
                  opinion."</p>
               <p>"Albert!" cried his master, "obey the landlord's wishes. <emph>I</emph> want no
                  supper; take my seat and see that you are well attended to."</p>
               <p>"Mars. Russell," said the mulatto, in a confused and deprecating tone.</p>
               <p>"Do as I tell you," exclaimed Mr. Moreland, in a tone of authority, which, though
                  tempered by kindness, Albert understood too well to resist. As Moreland passed
                  from the room, a gentleman, with a very prepossessing<pb n="22-23"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000012"/> sessing countenance and address, who was seated on
                  the opposite side of the table, rose and followed him.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry you have had so poor a specimen of Northern politeness," said the
                  gentleman, accosting Moreland, with a slight embarrassment of manner. "I trust you
                  do not think we all endorse such sentiments."</p>
               <p>"I certainly must make you an exception, sir," replied Moreland, holding out his
                  hand with involuntary frankness; "but I fear there are but very few. This is,
                  however, the first direct attack I have received, and I hardly knew in what way to
                  meet it. I have too much self-respect to place myself on a level with a man so
                  infinitely my inferior. That he intended to insult me, I know by his manner. He
                  knows our customs at home, and that nothing could be done in more positive
                  violation of them than his unwarrantable proposition."</p>
               <p>They had walked out in the open air while they were speaking, and continued their
                  walk through the poplar avenue, through whose stiff and stately branches the first
                  stars of evening were beginning to glisten.</p>
               <p>"I should think you would fear the effect of these things on your servant," said
                  the gentleman,—"that it would make him insolent and rebellious. Pardon me, sir,
                  but I think you were rather imprudent in bringing him with you, and exposing him
                  to the influences which must meet him on every side. You will not be surprised,
                  after the instance which has just occurred, when I tell you, that, in this
                  village, you are in the very hot-bed of fanaticism; and that a Southern planter,
                  accompanied by his slave, can meet but little sympathy, consideration, or
                  toleration; I fear there will be strong efforts made to induce your boy to leave
                  you."</p>
               <p>"I fear nothing of that kind," answered Moreland. "If they can bribe him from me,
                  let him go. I brought him far less to minister to my wants than to test his
                  fidelity and affection. I believe them proof against any temptation or assault; if
                  I am deceived I wish to know it, though the pang would be as severe as if my own
                  brother should lift his hand against me."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!—I did not imagine that the feelings were ever so deeply interested. While
                  I respect your rights, and resent any ungentlemanlike infringement of them, as in
                  the case of our landlord, I cannot conceive how beings, who are ranked as goods
                  and chattels, things of bargain and traffic, can ever fill the place of a friend
                  or brother in the heart."</p>
               <p>"Nevertheless, I assure you, that next to our own kindred, we look upon our slaves
                  as our best friends."</p>
               <p>As they came out of the avenue into the open street, they perceived the figure of
                  a woman, walking with slow steps before them, bearing a large bundle under her
                  arm; she paused several times, as if to recover breath, and once she stopped and
                  leaned against the fence, while a dry, hollow cough rent her frame.</p>
               <p>"Nancy," said the gentleman, "is that you?—you should not be out in the night
                  air."</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6694-00000013"/>
               <p>The woman turned round, and the starlight fell on a pale and wasted face.</p>
               <p>"I can't help it," she answered,—"I can't hold out any longer,—I can't work any
                  more;—I ain't strong enough to do a single chore now; and Mr. Grimby says he
                  hain't got any room for me to lay by in. My wages stopped three weeks ago. He says
                  there's no use in my hanging on any longer, for I'll never be good for anything
                  any more."</p>
               <p>"Where are you going now?" said the gentleman.</p>
               <p>"Home!" was the reply, in a tone of deep and hopeless despondency,—"Home, to my
                  poor old mother. I've supported her by my wages ever since I've been hired out;
                  that's the reason I haven't laid up any. God knows——"</p>
               <p>Here she stopped, for her words were evidently choked by an awful realization of
                  the irremediable misery of her condition. Moreland listened with eager interest.
                  His compassion was awakened, and so were other feelings. Here was a problem he
                  earnestly desired to solve, and he determined to avail himself of the opportunity
                  thrown in his path.</p>
               <p>"How far is your home from here?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"About three-quarters of a mile."</p>
               <p>"Give me your bundle—I'll carry it for you, you are too feeble; nay, I insist upon
                  it."</p>
               <p>Taking the bundle from the reluctant hand of the poor woman, he swung it lightly
                  upward and poised it on his left shoulder. His companion turned with a look of
                  unfeigned surprise towards the elegant and evidently high-bred stranger, thus
                  courteously relieving poverty and weakness of an oppressive burden.</p>
               <p>"Suffer me to assist you," said he. "You must be very unaccustomed to services of
                  this kind; I ought to have anticipated you."</p>
               <p>"I am not accustomed to do such things for myself," answered Moreland, "because
                  there is no occasion; but it only makes me more willing to do them for others. You
                  look upon us as very self-indulging beings, do you not?"</p>
               <p>"We think your institutions calculated to promote the growth of self-indulgence
                  and selfishness. The virtues that resist their opposing influences must have more
                  than common vitality."</p>
               <p>"We, who know the full length and breadth of our responsibilities, have less time
                  than any other men for self-indulgence. We feel that life is too short for the
                  performance of our duties, made doubly arduous and irksome by the misapprehension
                  and prejudice of those who ought to know us better and judge us more justly and
                  kindly. My good woman, do we walk too fast?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, sir. I so long to get home, but I am so ashamed to have you carry that
                  bundle."</p>
               <p>He had forgotten the encumbrance in studying the domestic problem, presented to
                  him for solution. Here was a poor young woman, entirely dependent on her<pb
                     n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6694-00000014"/> daily labour for the support of herself
                  and aged mother, incapacitated by sickness from ministering to their necessities,
                  thrown back upon her home, without the means of subsistence: in prospective, a
                  death of lingering torture for herself, for her mother a life of destitution or a
                  shelter in the almshouse. For every comfort, for the bare necessaries of life,
                  they must depend upon the compassion of the public; the attendance of a physician
                  must be the work of charity, their existence a burden on others.</p>
               <p>She had probably been a faithful labourer in her employer's family, while health
                  and strength lasted. He was an honest man in the common acceptation of the word,
                  and had doled out her weekly wages as long as they were earned; but he was not
                  rich, he had no superfluous gold, and could not afford to pay to her what was due
                  to her stronger and more healthy successor; he could not afford to give her even
                  the room which was required by another. What could she do but go to her desolate
                  home and die? She could not murmur. She had no claim on the affection of the man
                  in whose service she had been employed. She had lived with him in the capacity of
                  a hireling, and he, satisfied that he paid her the utmost farthing which justice
                  required, dismissed her, without incurring the censure of unkindness or injustice.
                  We ought to add, without deserving it. There were others far more able than
                  himself to take care of her, and a home provided by the parish for every
                  unsheltered head.</p>
               <p>Moreland, whose moral perceptions were rendered very acute by observation, drew a
                  contrast in his own mind, between the Northern and Southern labourer, when reduced
                  to a state of sickness and dependence. He brought his own experience in comparison
                  with the lesson of the present hour, and thought that the sick and dying negro,
                  retained under his master's roof, kindly nursed and ministered unto, with no sad,
                  anxious lookings forward into the morrow for the supply of nature's wants, no
                  fears of being cast into the pauper's home, or of being made a member of that
                  unhappy family, consecrated by no head, hallowed by no domestic relationship, had
                  in contrast a far happier lot. In the latter case there was sickness, without its
                  most horrible concomitant, poverty, without the harrowing circumstances connected
                  with public charity, or the capricious influence of private compassion. It is
                  true, the nominal bondage of the slave was wanting, but there was the bondage of
                  poverty, whose iron chains are heard clanking in every region of God's earth,
                  whose dark links are wrought in the forge of human suffering, eating slowly into
                  the quivering flesh, till they reach and dry up the life-blood of the heart. It
                  has often been said that there need be no such thing as poverty in this free and
                  happy land; that here it is only the offspring of vice and intemperance; that the
                  avenues of wealth and distinction are open to all,<pb n="28-29"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000015"/> and that all who choose may arrive at the golden
                  portals of success and honour, and enter boldly in. Whether this be true or not,
                  let the thousand toiling operatives of the Northern manufactories tell; let the
                  poor, starving seamstresses, whose pallid faces mingle their chill, wintry gleams
                  with the summer glow and splendour of the Northern cities, tell; let the free
                  negroes, congregated in the suburbs of some of our modern Babylons, lured from
                  their homes by hopes based on sand, without forethought, experience, or
                  employment, without sympathy, influence, or caste, let them also tell.</p>
               <p>When Moreland reached the low, dark-walled cottage which Nancy pointed out as her
                  home, he gave her back her bundle, and at the same time slipped a bill into her
                  hand, of whose amount she could not be aware. But she knew by the soft, yielding
                  paper the nature of the gift, and something whispered her that it was no niggard
                  boon.</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir," she cried, "you are too good. God bless you, sir, over and over
                  again!"</p>
               <p>She stood in the doorway of the little cabin, and the dull light within played
                  luridly on her sharpened and emaciated features. Her large black eyes were burning
                  with consumption's wasting fires, and a deep red, central spot in each concave
                  cheek, like the flame of the magic cauldron, was fed with blood alone. Large tears
                  were now sparkling in those glowing flame-spots, but they did not extinguish their
                  wasting brightness.</p>
               <p>"Poor creature!" thought Moreland. "Her day of toil is indeed over. There is
                  nothing left for her but to endure and to die. She has learned to
                     <emph>labour,</emph> she must now learn to <emph>wait.</emph>"</p>
               <p>As he turned from the door, resolving to call again before he left the village, he
                  saw his companion step back and speak to her, extending his hand at the same time.
                  Perceiving that he was actuated by the Christian spirit, which does not wish the
                  left hand to know what the right hand doeth, he walked slowly on, through an
                  atmosphere perfumed by the delicious but oppressive fragrance of the blossoming
                  lilacs, that lent to this obscure habitation a certain poetic charm.</p>
               <p>During their walk back to the inn, he became more and more pleased with his new
                  acquaintance, whose name he ascertained was Brooks, by profession an architect of
                  bridges. He was not a resident of the village, but was now engaged in erecting a
                  central bridge over the river that divided the village from the main body of the
                  town. As his interests were not identified with the place or the people, his
                  opinions were received by Moreland with more faith and confidence than if they
                  issued from the lips of a native inhabitant.</p>
               <p>When they returned to the inn, they found Albert waiting at the door, with a
                  countenance of mingled vexation and triumph. The landlord and several other men
                  were standing near him, and had evidently been engaged in earnest conversation.
                  The sudden cessation<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6694-00000016"/> of this, on the
                  approach of Mr. Moreland, proved that he had been the subject of it, and from the
                  manner in which they drew back as he entered the passage, he imagined their
                  remarks were not of the most flattering nature.</p>
               <p>"Well, Albert, my boy," said he, when they were alone in his chamber, "I hope you
                  relished your supper."</p>
               <p>"Please, Mars. Russell, don't do that again. I made 'em wait on me this time, but
                  it don't seem right. Besides, I don't feel on an equality with 'em, no way. They
                  are no gentlemen."</p>
               <p>Moreland laughed.</p>
               <p>"What were they talking to you about so earnestly as I entered?" asked he.</p>
               <p>"About how you treated me and the rest of us. Why, Mars. Russell, they don't know
                  nothing about us. They want to know if we don't wear chains at home and manacles
                  about our wrists. One asked if you didn't give us fodder to eat. Another wanted to
                  strip off my coat, to see if my back wa'n't all covered with scars. I wish you'd
                  heard what I told 'em. Master, I wish you'd heard the way I give it to 'em."</p>
               <p>"I have no doubt you did me justice, Albert. My feelings are not in the least
                  wounded, though my sense of justice is pained. Why, I should think the sight of
                  your round, sleek cheeks, and sound, active limbs would be the best argument in my
                  favour. They must believe you thrive wonderfully on fodder."</p>
               <p>"What you think one of 'em said, Mars. Russell? They say you fatten me up, you
                  dress me up, and carry me 'bout as a show-boy, to make folks think you treat us
                  all well, but that the niggers at home are treated worse than dogs or cattle, a
                  heap worse. I tell 'em it's all one big lie. I tell 'em you're the best—"</p>
               <p>"Never mind, Albert. That will do. I want to think—"</p>
               <p>Albert never ventured to intrude on his master's thinking moments, and, turning
                  away in respectful silence, he soon stretched himself on the carpet and sunk in a
                  profound sleep. In the mean time Moreland waded through a deep current of thought,
                  that swelled as it rolled, and ofttimes it was turbid and foaming, and sometimes
                  it seemed of icy chillness. He was a man of strong intellect and strong passions;
                  but the latter, being under the control of principle, gave force and energy and
                  warmth to a character which, if unrestrained, they would have defaced and laid
                  waste. He was a searcher after truth, and felt ready and brave enough to plunge
                  into the cold abyss, where it is said to be hidden, or to encounter the fires of
                  persecution, the thorns of prejudice, to hazard everything, to suffer everything,
                  rather than relinquish the hope of attaining it. He pondered much on the condition
                  of mankind, its inequalities and wrongs. He thought of the poor and subservient in
                  other lands, and compared them with our own. He thought of the groaning serfs of
                  Russia; the starving sons of Ireland; the<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6694-00000017"/>
                  squalid operatives of England, its dark, subterranean workshops, sunless abodes of
                  want, misery, and sin, its toiling millions, doomed to drain their hearts' best
                  blood to add to the splendours and luxuries of royalty and rank; of the free
                  hirelings of the North, who, as a <emph>class,</emph> travail in discontent and
                  repining, anxious to throw off the yoke of servitude, sighing for an equality
                  which exists only in name; and then he turned his thoughts homeward, to the
                  enslaved children of Africa, and, taking them as a <emph>class,</emph> as a
                     <emph>distinct race</emph> of beings, he came to the irresistible conclusion,
                  that they were the happiest <emph>subservient</emph> race that were found on the
                  face of the globe. He did not seek to disguise to himself the evils which were
                  inseparably connected with their condition, or that man too oft abused the power
                  he owned; but in view of all this, in view of the great, commanding truth, that
                  wherever civilized man exists, there is the dividing line of the high and the low,
                  the rich and the poor, the thinking and the labouring, in view of the
                  God-proclaimed fact that "all Creation toileth and groaneth together," and that
                  labour and suffering are the solemn sacraments of life, he believed that the
                  slaves of the South were blest beyond the pallid slaves of Europe, or the anxious,
                  care-worn labourers of the North.</p>
               <p>With this conviction he fell asleep, and in his dreams he still tried to unravel
                  the mystery of life, and to reconcile its inequalities with the justice and mercy
                  of an omnipotent God.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>MORELAND breakfasted in, his own room, and the peace of the Sabbath morning
                  brooded on his heart. He took his seat at the window, and watched the shadows of
                  the trees playing on the white walls of the church, and the golden gleam of its
                  vane flashing on the blue of the sky. He was glad when the deep-toned bell called
                  the worshippers together, and the people began to ascend the grassy slope that led
                  up to the house of God. Mr. Brooks, his new friend, offered to accompany him and
                  usher him to a seat; an offer he gratefully accepted. The pew to which he
                  conducted him was situated at the right hand of the pulpit, in one of the wings of
                  the church, so that he was facing the congregation, and could see them without
                  appearing to gaze, as they glided, one by one, up the central aisle, to their
                  accustomed places.</p>
               <p>The interior of the church was very simple and pure. The green curtains and
                  hangings of the pulpit, and the green screen that ran around the gallery, made a
                  charming contrast with the unsullied whiteness of the<pb n="34-35"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000018"/> walls, and harmonized with the green boughs that
                  shaded the windows, and the green grass that carpeted the common.</p>
               <p>There was no organ, with gilded pipes and sounding bellows, to give dignity to the
                  orchestra, but Moreland caught a glimpse of white robes behind the curtain of the
                  gallery, and he was sure some beautiful daughters of Zion were assembled there to
                  sing praises to their God. He wanted the service to commence, so that he could see
                  the figures of that vestal choir, as well as hear their mingling voices. His ear
                  was gratified before his eye, for while waiting the coming of the minister, an
                  anthem began to roll forth from the invisible band, whose notes filled the
                  intervals of sound between the echoing peals of the bell. The commencing words of
                  the anthem were grand. Moreland had heard them before, but they came to him with a
                  new sense, because he was prepared to receive new impressions. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Before Jehovah's awful throne,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Ye nations bow with sacred joy;</l>
                        <l>Know that the Lord is God alone,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">He can create, and He destroy."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Among the voices that gave utterance to these adoring words, was one which, though
                  sweet and soft and feminine beyond expression, seemed to drown every other. It
                  rose, like the imagined hymn of an angel, clear and swelling, and then died gently
                  away, to rise again with richer, fuller harmony. Moreland, whose devotional
                  feelings were always exalted by sacred music, listened with breathless rapture,
                  wondering what sweet bird of song had folded its wings behind that green
                  enclosure.</p>
               <p>At the conclusion of the anthem, where it is affirmed that the truth of God shall
                  stand firm as a rock, <q>
                     <l>"While rolling years shall cease to move,"</l>
                  </q> when again and again the sublime refrain was repeated, that single voice
                  alone fell upon his ear. On that alone the "rolling years" seemed borne onward to
                  eternity. Other voices sang, and their notes died away; but hers kept rolling and
                  warbling round the arching walls of the church, till the house was filled with
                  their melody, and Moreland kept looking up, almost expecting to see them forming
                  into something visible, as well as audible, into silvery or crystal rings,
                  sparkling and glittering on the eye. He held his breath so long, that the act of
                  respiration became painful, when renewed, and so intensely had he listened that
                  the moisture gathered on his brow.</p>
               <p>The anthem ceased as the venerable minister walked up the aisle and ascended the
                  pulpit. He looked congenial with the music that heralded his approach, with his
                  silver hair, mild, benignant countenance, and deep-set thoughtful eyes. He was
                  just such a minister as one would associate in idea with that pure, simple church,
                  and white-robed singing band. His prayer breathed the very spirit of devotion. It
                  reminded Moreland of the "Lord, save or we perish" of drowning Peter—"God<pb
                     n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6694-00000019"/> be merciful to me a sinner" of the
                  weeping publican. After the reading of a beautiful opening hymn, the choir rose,
                  and the eyes of Moreland rested on one fair face, which he knew, by intuition,
                  belonged to the minstrel maiden whose voice had so charmed his ear. It rose above
                  the green curtain like a lily from its bed of sheathing leaves, so fair, so
                  spiritual, so serene, it was impossible not to imagine an atmosphere of fragrance
                  surrounding its purity and bloom. He was right. The hymn commenced, and the same
                  sweet strains gushed from the lips, on which he was now gazing. He could not see
                  the colour of her eyes, for they were downcast, but he could see the soft shadow
                  of long, dark, drooping lashes on her cheeks, and he could see the bright, deep
                  hue of chestnut brown that dyed her hair. He remembered the vision that had
                  flitted before him the preceding evening, and it seemed to him that he had met
                  this maiden stranger in some of the dim-remembered scenes of a past eternity. He
                  could not shake off this wild idea, born of a poetic temperament and excited
                  imagination. What was there about this young female that so singularly attracted
                  him;—him, who had lately abjured the very thought of woman, in a widowhood of
                  heart, far deeper and sadder than that which death creates; who had torn from his
                  bosom the wilted garlands of love, and cast them, in indignation and despair, at
                  the feet of a fallen and degraded idol? She was not more beautiful than some of
                  her companions, perhaps not as beautiful as some, and yet he gazed only on her,
                  watching the lifting of her drooping lids, as the Persian watches the rising of
                  the star of day. It was not till the close of the hymn, the beginning of the
                  sermon, after the curtain was drawn on one side and the singers seated, that she
                  raised her eyes and fixed them steadily on the evangelical countenance of the
                  pastor. Though bent on another, Moreland felt their dark magnetism to his heart's
                  core. This sudden, powerful attraction, exercised by the simple village maiden,
                  would not have been so strange had he been a young, romantic boy; but he was a man
                  of some sad experience, who, before he entered that church, believed himself cold
                  and insensible to the most seductive charms of womankind. At length, roused to the
                  reflection that he might attract observation by the intensity of his gaze, he
                  turned also towards the minister and endeavoured to rivet his attention on the
                  truths he uttered. It is not to be supposed that a distinguished-looking stranger
                  would pass entirely unnoticed in a village church, and there was many an eye
                  perusing his face, while his was bent on the gallery; and there were some who
                  thought his fixed and earnest gaze the bold, free stare of conscious wealth and
                  arrogance. They had heard that a Southern gentleman, accompanied by a mulatto
                  slave, had stopped at the inn the preceding night, and they were not slow in
                  identifying the individual with the handsome stranger before them. There were a
                  few, however, who did not judge<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6694-00000020"/> him in
                  this harsh manner, who had heard—(strange how quickly such things are winged in a
                  country village)—how he had carried Nancy Brown's bundle all the way home for her,
                  and put in her hand a ten dollar bill, without saying a word about it, and they
                  lifted up their hearts and blessed him, though he knew it not.</p>
               <p>When the benediction was pronounced, and the congregation passed out, Moreland
                  lingered in the vestibule waiting for the choristers to descend. SHE came at last,
                  leading by the hand a little girl of about five years of age, whose countenance
                  bore a strong resemblance to her own. So many people were crowded in the doorways,
                  she was obliged to pass so close to Moreland that her white dress floated against
                  him; and if it had been the wing of a seraph he could not have felt a thrill of
                  deeper reverence. She did not look at him, but he felt, by the colour that glowed
                  on the lilies of her cheek, that she was aware of his presence and his gaze.</p>
               <p>"Eula!" said the little girl, "don't walk so fast; Papa is coming."</p>
               <p>Eula!—blessings on that cherub mouth for pronouncing the name he so longed to
                  know. But that large, bustling gentleman, with reddish-auburn hair and florid
                  complexion, and small, keen, restless black eyes, was that Eula's father? To be
                  sure, it must be, for does she not take his arm with an affectionate, confiding
                  air; and does not the little smiling five-year old thing frisk round to the other
                  side of him, catching hold of his hand as if it were an ingot of gold she was
                  grasping, instead of four freckled fingers and one stout thumb!</p>
               <p>"Who is that reddish-haired gentleman?" asked Moreland of Mr. Brooks, as they
                  walked slowly in the wake of light the sweet-voiced maiden seemed to leave behind
                  her.</p>
               <p>"His name is Hastings," replied his companion, "one of the most conspicuous
                  characters in the village. He is considered a very shrewd, intelligent man, and,
                  although not at all popular, has nevertheless a great deal of influence in the
                  community."</p>
               <p>"What is his profession?"</p>
               <p>"He cannot be said to have any exclusive profession. He prepares young men for
                  college, edits a paper called the "Emancipator," writes essays, delivers public
                  lectures on all the leading topics of the day, and, among these, as you are
                  doubtless prepared to hear, slavery, or rather anti-slavery, occupies a very
                  conspicuous place."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" cried Moreland, with an unaccountable feeling of pain at the
                  intelligence; "and is that young lady on his right arm his own daughter?"</p>
               <p>"Yes! that is Miss Eulalia Hastings, or, as she is often called, the Flower of the
                  village. She sings like an angel. You heard her voice in church. She is highly
                  educated and accomplished, though she is so modest and retiring she makes no
                  display. She is universally beloved and admired, and makes friends even of her
                  father's enemies."</p>
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6694-00000021"/>
               <p>"Of course, she inherits all her father's prejudices against the South?" remarked
                  Moreland, in a tone that seemed to ask a negation.</p>
               <p>"Very probably; though they must be softened by passing through such a medium. I
                  heard him say once, that if wife or child of his were languishing in a
                  consumption, and he knew he could add ten years to their lives by sending them to
                  the milder climate of the South, his conscience would not justify the act, so
                  utterly does he abhor its institutions."</p>
               <p>"You think, then, he would not allow his daughter to marry a Southerner?" This was
                  said in a light, sarcastic tone, which was followed by one more serious. "Is he a
                  man of wealth as well as influence?"</p>
               <p>"No, not at all. His father left him considerable property, but he has wasted it
                  in fruitless speculations and visionary schemes for the improvement of the age. He
                  always has a hobby which he rides without mercy or judgment. The one on which he
                  is mounted at present is the immediate emancipation of the negro race. You must
                  not feel slighted if he invites your servant (I do not like the word <hi rend="i"
                  />slave) to come and break bread with him, without extending towards you the rites
                  of hospitality."</p>
               <p>"Is there a possibility of his doing this?" asked Moreland.</p>
               <p>"We can only judge of the future by the past," replied the architect. "Not very
                  long ago, while travelling ling in a neighbouring state, he came across a runaway
                  negro, one of the most repulsive objects I ever saw,—gigantic in stature, black as
                  ebony, with coarse and brutal features, and manners corresponding to his
                  appearance. He took him at once under his protection, gave him a seat in his
                  carriage, brought him home, introduced him to his family, gave him a seat at table
                  between his wife and eldest daughter, put him in their best bedroom, and appeared
                  to feel himself honoured by having such a guest."</p>
               <p>"I like this," interrupted Moreland; "it shows that he is sincere, and is willing
                  to put his principles to the proof. But Miss Hastings, surely this must have been
                  very repugnant to her feelings; she could not willingly submit to such an
                  infliction."</p>
               <p>He said this with a shudder of inexpressible loathing, as he looked on the
                  delicate, graceful figure walking before him, and imagined it placed in such close
                  juxtaposition with the rough, gigantic negro.</p>
               <p>"I suspect Miss Eulalia did not relish it very much," said Mr. Brooks; "but filial
                  respect closed her lips. She happened to fall sick immediately after his arrival,
                  whether as a consequence I know not, and thus escaped further personal contact.
                  But the best part of the story is to come. Mr. Hastings, after he had gained
                  sufficient éclat for his philanthropy and great-heartedness, was very willing to
                  transfer his protegé to some of his neighbours, but no one was willing to accept
                     the<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6694-00000022"/> responsibility, and the fellow
                  liked his quarters too well to think of leaving them. He grew very insolent and
                  overbearing, and his host was at last compelled to turn him out of the house.
                  Since then, he has had a double bolt fastened to his doors; and his dreams, I
                  suspect, are haunted by black spectres, armed and equipped for murder and
                  robbery."</p>
               <p>The attention of Moreland was diverted by the diverging steps of the party before
                  him. They turned aside into a path leading to a neat, modest-looking dwelling,
                  shaded by sycamore trees, beside whose deep green, the scarlet berries of the
                  mountain ash gleamed with coral splendour. Like most of the other houses, it
                  wanted the graceful verandah,—the pillared piazza of Southern climes,—and gave one
                  an impression of glare and exposure; but the smooth, beautiful green that
                  surrounded it, and the richness of branching shade that embosomed it, compensated
                  for the want of these artificial embellishments. As Mr. Hastings opened the gate
                  that shut in the front yard, and held it open for his daughters to pass through,
                  the handkerchief of Eulalia dropped from her hand, and a light breeze blew it back
                  directly at the feet of Moreland; he caught it with eagerness, and as she turned
                  immediately, with a consciousness of the loss, he stepped forward and presented
                  it, with a respectful and graceful bow. He was thus brought face to face with her,
                  and the soft, electric-beaming eyes seemed to shed into his bosom a flood of
                  living light. With an impulse bold as irresistible, he pressed the hand which
                  received the handkerchief from his; and though he saw the startled crimson rush to
                  her cheek, he could not repent of his presumption. He could not help doing it,—it
                  was an expression of sympathy as involuntary as it was sincere. He felt as if a
                  mighty barrier of prejudice separated him from one to whom he was irresistibly
                  attracted, and he was forced in this, perhaps their only meeting, to give
                  expression in some way to his suddenly awakened, but passionate emotions. It was
                  like taking the hand of a friend through the grate of a convent, the bars of a
                  dungeon, in token of a long farewell. He walked in silence the rest of the way;
                  and his companion smiled to himself at the impression the Flower of the Village
                  had evidently made on the Southern planter.</p>
               <p>Moreland had the good sense to tell Albert to remain in the kitchen during
                  meal-times, so that the equilibrium of the landlord might not be disturbed by an
                  appearance of servility on one part, and aristocracy on the other. And, whether
                  Mr. Grimby thought he had taken an ultra step the preceding evening, or whether he
                  was influenced by Albert's warm praises of his master, and his evident attachment
                  and devotion to him, he was much more polite in his deportment and respectful in
                  his manners. Still, he was anxious to draw him into a political or sectional
                  discussion, for he believed himself, in strength of argument, superior to even his
                  oracle, Mr. Hastings.<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6694-00000023"/> So, in imitation of
                  the play of the fox and glove, he went round and round, ready to drop the gauntlet
                  at the most favourable moment. But Moreland's mind was preoccupied, and he did not
                  think the Sabbath calm should be ruffled by the contentions of party, or the
                  warrings of self-love.</p>
               <p>He did not attend church the after part of the day. He was resolved to struggle
                  with the weakness which he blushed to feel. He would not place himself again
                  within the influence of that seraph voice, or that fair, music-breathing face. He
                  could not bridge the gulf of prejudice that yawned between them; and he would not
                  linger on the opposite side sighing for the flowers that bloomed in vain for him.
                  So he seated himself at the window, with book in hand, respecting himself for the
                  dignified stand he had mentally taken; but the position he occupied was very
                  unfavourable for the strength of his resolution. The church was so near that
                  through its open windows he could hear distinctly the venerable accents of the
                  minister, and the sweet and solemn notes of the choristers. He could distinguish
                  the nightingale-voice, which, once heard, never could be forgotten,—it came
                  flowing out into the sunshine, mingling with and melting into the blue waves of
                  ether, rolling in the "upper deep;" it came floating across the gulf, over whose
                  bridgeless depths he had been lamenting, on soft and downy wings, like a messenger
                  dove, bearing promises of peace and love; it hovered over the dim retreats of
                  memory, and its thrilling strains blended with the echoes of a voice which had in
                  other hours enthralled his soul;—but that had breathed of the passions of earth,
                  this of the hopes of immortality. Of course he could not read, and, suffering the
                  book to fall from his fingers, he sunk into a long, deep revery.</p>
               <p>Intending to recommence his journey early the following morning, he thought he
                  would walk out before sunset, and take his last look of the charming valley in
                  which the village was set, like a polished gem. Not seeing his agreeable and
                  intelligent new friend, the architect, he sauntered along without any companion
                  but his own thoughts, turning into by-paths, without knowing whither they went,
                  assured they would lead him only to green fields and tranquil waters, or,
                  perchance, to some garden of the dead. He was surprised to find himself close to
                  Nancy Brown's little cottage. He recognised the pale purple of the lilac bushes
                  through the old dark fence, and the air was heavy with their fragrance. A natural
                  movement of humanity urged him to enter, and see if he could do anything more for
                  the poor invalid, who had interested his feelings so much. The door was open, and
                  he stood on its threshold without having his approach perceived. <emph>She</emph>
                  was there, the white-robed, singing maiden worshipper of the temple, and she had
                  already heard the story of his kindness and liberality from the lips of the
                  grateful Nancy. She had just been listening to it, and the glow was on her
                     heart<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6694-00000024"/> when he entered. A smile of
                  welcome, involuntary as the heart-beat, which at that moment was quickened, dawned
                  on her lips, but was instantaneously overcast by a cloud of reserve. It was
                  probably the recollection of his presumptuous act in the morning, which drew the
                  sudden cloud over her dawning smile. It is impossible to describe the effect of
                  her appearance in that little, low, dark cottage, in contrast with extreme age and
                  decrepitude on one side, and deadliness and emaciation on the other. She sat
                  between Nancy and her mother, and each poor, pale, drooping figure caught
                  something of life and brightness from her youthful and benignant aspect. She was
                  pale too, but hers was the pallor of moonlight, so fair, so lustrous, it diffused
                  around a kindred softness and repose. When Moreland first stepped upon the
                  threshold, a very quick, slight, vanishing blush flitted over her cheek, then left
                  it as colourless and calm as before.</p>
               <p>Nancy, whose eyes were fixed on her face, did not perceive as quickly the entrance
                  of her benevolent visiter.</p>
               <p>"There is a gentleman at the door," said Eulalia, rising from her seat.</p>
               <p>Nancy turned round, and, recognising the kind and liberal stranger, asked him to
                  walk in, and offering him her own chair, took a seat on the side of the bed. Her
                  surprise and embarrassment brought on a violent fit of coughing, whose hollow,
                  wasting sound reverberated painfully in the narrow apartment.</p>
               <p>"This is the good gentleman I was just telling you about," said she, as soon as
                  she could recover breath. "Mother, this is the gentleman that carried my bundle
                  for me, and gave me that money last night. Oh, sir, I don't know what to say to
                  you. I never did know how to talk, but there are a heap of words here, if I could
                  only get 'em out." Here Nancy pressed her wasted hand on her heart, with a great
                  deal of expression, though with little grace.</p>
               <p>"The Lord bless you, sir!" cried the old mother, her voice trembling and quavering
                  with age and imbecility. "The Lord reward you for your good deeds! Well, well, I
                  never would have believed such a fine gentleman as you would have carried Nancy's
                  bundle for her. I never would. Well, it's a blessed thing not to be proud. Just
                  like Miss Euly here. She ha'in't got one bit of pride. She's just as willing to
                  wait on such a poor old creatur as me, as if I was of some account in the
                  world."</p>
               <p>It was pleasant to the ear of Moreland to find himself associated with Eulalia
                  Hastings, even in the mind of this humble, indigent creature. There was another
                  thing that pleased him. The woman was not mercenary. She appreciated more highly
                  the simple act of condescension, the carrying of the bundle, than the money which
                  was given to relieve their wants. He had too much ease of manner, had seen too
                  much of the world,<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6694-00000025"/> to suffer himself to
                  be embarrassed by this unexpected meeting. He thought there was something peculiar
                  in it; the accidental arrangement of circumstances which brought him in contact
                  with the lovely chorister. The distance between them seemed wonderfully
                  diminished. When he first saw her, in her elevated position in the gallery,
                  singing the praise of God in words of surpassing grandeur, his imagination exalted
                  her into one of that celestial band who stand in white robes about the throne, day
                  and night, chanting the eternal chorus, "Hallelujah! the Lord God omnipotent
                  reigneth." Now, she was on a level with himself, seated near him in the abode of
                  indigence and suffering; he heard her gentle, speaking accents, fraught with human
                  sympathy and sensibility. He began to think it possible that he might defer his
                  journey a few days longer. There was nothing particularly to hasten his return. It
                  was far better for him to be away, far from the remembrances that darkened his
                  home. He could not possibly find a more quiet resting spot than in this beautiful
                  valley, where <q>
                     <l>"The green of the earth and the blue of the sky"</l>
                  </q> seemed to meet in gorgeous rivalship.</p>
               <p>Would it not be well to seek an acquaintance with Mr. Hastings, and endeavour,
                  with earnestness and deliberation, to remove his prejudices and give him juster
                  views of his fellow beings? While he thus communed with himself, Mrs. Brown was
                  not idle. In the innocence cence and curiosity of second childhood, she sat gazing
                  on their elegant visiter, through the spectacles, which she wiped at least a dozen
                  times with the corner of her checked apron, so as to assist her faded vision.</p>
               <p>"May I make bold to ask your name, sir?" said she. "I know most everybody that
                  lives hereabouts, but I don't think you live in these parts, do you?"</p>
               <p>"I should ask your pardon for not introducing myself sooner, madam," was the
                  courteous reply. "My name is Moreland. I reside in the distant South."</p>
               <p>"The South!" repeated the octogenarian. "Well, that is far off. What part of the
                  South?"</p>
               <p>"I reside in Georgia."</p>
               <p>"The South!" again repeated she, bewildered by the idea of such immense distance.
                  "Ain't it there where they have so many black folks to wait on 'em, with great
                  iron chains on their hands and feet? Well, well, who would have thought it? You
                  don't look as if you come from among such a dreadful set of people—not one bit.
                  Law me! you don't say so!"</p>
               <p>Here she again took off her spectacles, wiped them laboriously, readjusted them,
                  and fixed her dim, glimmering glance once more on the face of the Southern
                  stranger. She was probably searching for those lineaments of harshness and
                  cruelty, those lines of tiger grimness and ferocity, she had so often heard
                  described.</p>
               <p>"Mother!" exclaimed Nancy, whose natural delicacy of feeling and deep gratitude
                  were greatly shocked by<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6694-00000026"/> these remarks,
                  "you'll offend the gentleman. She don't mean any harm, sir—no more than a
                  child."</p>
               <p>"Do not fear that I shall be offended," said Moreland, with an irrepressible smile
                  at the old lady's persevering scrutiny. "I like to hear what people think of us.
                  It may do us good. You are mistaken, madam," added he, addressing the mother; "our
                  black people do not wear chains, unless outrageous and criminal behaviour force us
                  to such severity."</p>
               <p>Perhaps Moreland would not have thought it worth the effort, to refute the charges
                  of a poor, imbecile, ignorant woman, who only repeated what she had heard from
                  higher powers, had not the daughter of Hastings been present to listen to his
                  words. But he could not bear that she should look upon him as one of that
                  "dreadful set," represented as dwelling amid clanking chains and galling manacles,
                  and banqueting on human blood. He saw, that though her eye was cast modestly
                  downward, she was no inattentive or uninterested listener.</p>
               <p>"Well," ejaculated the old lady, half in soliloquy and half in harangue—"I don't
                  mean to give offence, to be sure. You've been mighty good to Nancy, and I can't
                  take away the blessing that's gone up to heaven for you now, if I wanted to. But
                  I'm sorry such a likely, kind-hearted gentleman as you seem to be, should live
                  where such a sinful traffic is carried on. I've hearn Squire Hastings tell such
                  awful things about it, it e'enamost made my hair stand on end. He used to lecture
                  and speechify in the school-house close by, and as long as I could hobble out
                  doors I went to hear him, for it always helped me powerfully in spirit. He's a
                  mighty knowing man, and has a way of telling things that makes one's flesh creep.
                  He's <emph>her</emph> father, Squire Hastings is. She ain't ashamed to hear me
                  tell on't."</p>
               <p>Eulalia made a scarcely perceptible shrinking, backward motion, at this eulogium
                  on her father. She had heard it many a time before, but it never had seemed so
                  exaggerated or ill-timed as at the present moment.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry you have been led to believe us so awfully wicked and cruel, my good
                  woman," said Moreland, looking at Eulalia's evidently troubled countenance, though
                  his words were addressed to Dame Brown. "I cannot wonder so much at yourself, who
                  have probably lived secluded from the world, and received your opinions from those
                  around; but that those, who have had abundant opportunities of knowing what we
                  really are, beings of like passions with themselves, as upright in principle, as
                  honest in opinion, as kind in action, should represent us as such monsters of
                  iniquity, does indeed seem wonderful. We claim no exemption from the faults and
                  failings of poor fallen humanity, but we do claim a share of its virtues. The
                  clanking chains of which you speak are mere figures of speech. You hear instead
                  merry voices singing in the fields of labour or filling up the pauses of 'toil.
                  Sadly have I missed in my northern<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6694-00000027"/>
                  travels, the joyous songs and exhilarating laughter of our slaves."</p>
               <p>"You don't say so! Well, well! One does hear such strange things. You don't say
                  they ever sing and laugh! Why, I thought they did nothing but cry and groan and
                  gnash their teeth, all the day long. Well, it is hard to know what to
                  believe."</p>
               <p>"I wish you were able to travel so far," said Moreland, looking compassionately at
                  Nancy's hectic cheeks, "and occupy a cabin in one of my plantations, where the
                  balmy air would restore you to health. One day passed in the midst of the negroes
                  would be worth a thousand arguments in our favour. You would see there, age free
                  from care or labour, sickness tenderly nursed, and helplessness amply provided
                  for. The poor invalid is not compelled to leave the master whom she has served,
                  when health and strength are exhausted, but, without any care or forethought of
                  her own, is watched over as kindly as if born of a fairer race."</p>
               <p>Nancy sighed. She thought of her days of servitude, her waning health, her anxious
                  fears and torturing apprehensions of future want, and it seemed to her the mere
                  exemption from such far-reaching solicitudes must be a blessing. She thought, too,
                  of the soft, mild atmosphere that flowed around those children of toil, and wished
                  she could breathe its balm.</p>
               <p>"I wish it was not so far off," she exclaimed; "but," she added, with a deeper
                  sigh, "I never could live to reach there. And if I could, mother is too old to
                  bear the journey. And then we couldn't afford it."</p>
               <p>Moreland was sorry he had suggested an impracticable idea. He did not intend to
                  raise hopes which could not be realized, though so uncalculating was his
                  benevolence he would willingly have paid the expenses of the journey, if by so
                  doing he could have restored health to her frail and broken constitution.</p>
               <p>"We've mighty good friends here," said the old lady, wiping away the falling tears
                  with the corner of her apron. "Miss Euly is just like an angel to us; and there
                  are others too, who, if they don't look as pretty, are 'most as kind as she
                  is."</p>
               <p>Eulalia rose to depart. She had lingered in the hope that Moreland would go, but
                  the sun was darting his horizontal rays through the window, throwing rosy lines
                  across her fair face, and she felt he was waiting her motion. She felt embarrassed
                  when he also rose, doubting the propriety of being escorted by a stranger.</p>
               <p>"I will see you again," were his parting words to Nancy and her mother. So it was
                  evident he had made up his mind not to leave on the morrow.</p>
               <p>"May I escort you home?" he asked, when he opened the gate for her to pass out.
                  "Though we have had no formal introduction, I have announced my own name, and I
                  know it is Miss Hastings whom I have the honour of addressing."</p>
               <p>"We village maidens are quite independent," she<pb n="54-55"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000028"/> replied, with a smile; "we are not accustomed to
                  escorts in our rural walks, especially when leading from such lowly dwellings.
                  Strangers seldom find out as readily as you have done, sir, the abodes of
                  poverty."</p>
               <p>"It was accident," he answered, gratified by her manner, which implied
                  approbation, if not interest, "I can claim no credit for seeking. Though you must
                  have discovered that I am disposed to arrogate to myself all the merit I can
                  possibly lay hold of, I hope you will not think me a vain boaster."</p>
               <p>"I think you have the power of making the worse appear the better reason," she
                  said, with a smile that softened the sarcasm of her words.</p>
               <p>"You have no pleasing impressions, I fear, of our beautiful South, Miss Hastings.
                  You have had dark and forbidding pictures drawn of it. You look upon it as a moral
                  Aceldama, and shudder at the view. Is it not so?"</p>
               <p>"I love to think of your sunny clime," she answered, while a dawning colour
                  mingled with the glow of sunset on her cheek, "of your magnolia bowers and flowery
                  plains. I have heard a great deal of your chivalry and liberality, and love to
                  listen to their praises; but I do not love to think of the dark spot in your
                  social system, that is gradually spreading and deepening, and destroying all its
                  beauty and happiness. I do shudder when I think of this. I did not mean to say so
                  much, but you have forced it from me."</p>
               <p>"I admire your candour. I did not expect to hear you speak so mildly, considering
                  the prejudices of birth and education. Your father is, I understand, an avowed
                  champion of what he believes to be truth, and it is perfectly natural that you
                  should respect his opinions and adopt them as your own. Yet, if you grant me the
                  privilege of your acquaintance, I hope to be able to convince you that those
                  opinions are erroneous, and that though we have a dark spot in our social system,
                  like every other cloud, 'it turns its silver lining to the light.'"</p>
               <p>"My father does not adopt his opinions lightly," said she, with modest emphasis;
                  "he has been a great student from his youth up, and something of a traveller, too.
                  He does not wish to believe evil of mankind, neither does he, until the conviction
                  is forced upon him."</p>
               <p>"But you would not regret, if I could prove to you that he was mistaken in his
                  estimate of Southern character,—that there is far less of cruelty, oppression, and
                  sorrow in our midst than you now believe,—would you?"</p>
               <p>This was said with such irresistible frankness, that had Eulalia been a more
                  obstinate adherent than she was to her father's sentiments, she could not have
                  uttered a cold negation. Naturally as reserved as she was modest, she was
                  surprised at the freedom of her conversation with an utter stranger. His morning
                  boldness, which she had at first deeply resented (though she<pb n="56-57"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000029"/> made no commentary on it to her father), now
                  occurred to her as accidental; he had probably merely intended to take a firm hold
                  of the handkerchief, and grasped her hand instead. She could not help being
                  pleased with the ease and grace of his manners; and the kindness and condescension
                  she had witnessed in Mrs. Brown's cottage were genuine passports to her favour. It
                  was not often, in the retirement of her village home, that her exquisite sense of
                  refinement was so fully gratified; she had lived in a world of her own, whose
                  visionary inhabitants were very much such beings as Moreland. He did not seem like
                  a stranger, but rather as the incarnation of her own bright and beautiful
                  idealities. She wanted her father to know him, to hear him talk, and listen to his
                  eloquent self-defence. She was astonished when she reached their own gate, the
                  walk had seemed so very short, and wondered what had become of the setting
                  sun,—she had not marked its going down.</p>
               <p>"Sister Eula! have you come back?" exclaimed a sweet voice, through the bars of
                  the gate, and a little sunshiny head was seen beaming behind it. She, Eula's
                  morning companion, stood with her feet on the lower round of the gate, and, when
                  it was opened, swung back with it, laughing merrily at having secured so brave a
                  ride.</p>
               <p>Moreland, who was very fond of children, caught her in his arms, promising her a
                  better and longer ride than the limits of the gate could furnish.</p>
               <p>"I've seen you before," said she, peeping at him through her bright hair, which
                  fell shadingly over her brow; "I saw you this morning; you picked up sister Eula's
                  handkerchief. Papa said—"</p>
               <p>"Dora!" interrupted Eulalia, "here are some flowers for you. Nancy gave them to
                  me. Don't you want them?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes!" exclaimed the child, eagerly extending her hand, and forgetting what
                  papa had said, which Moreland would have very much liked to hear.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Papa</emph> was standing in the door, looking very portly and dignified, not
                  a little surprised at seeing the stranger whom he had so keenly observed in the
                  morning, walking quietly up his own yard, in company with one daughter, and
                  bearing the other, perched like a bird on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Papa, don't you see me riding?" cried Dora, from her elevated seat, long before
                  they reached the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hastings descended the steps, and the child leaped into his arms.</p>
               <p>"Little romp!" cried he, setting her down very kindly, "go to your mother." And
                  away she flew to tell her mother of the stranger's coming, and her own marvellous
                  adventure.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Moreland, father," said Eulalia. "He met me at Mrs. Brown's cottage, and it
                  being late, he accompanied me home."</p>
               <p>Moreland felt something as if a gimlet were boring<pb n="58-59"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000030"/> in his flesh, while enduring the piercing glance of
                  the philanthropist; but he did not wince under the infliction, though it somewhat
                  galled him.</p>
               <p>"Won't you walk in, sir?" said Mr. Hastings, holding out his hand. "Glad to see
                  you, if you have time to sit down."</p>
               <p>This was an unexpected condescension, of which Moreland unhesitatingly availed
                  himself. He wanted to enter the home of Eulalia, and see her in the midst of
                  domestic associations.</p>
               <p>"He has not seen the tiger's claws," thought Moreland; "or, perhaps, like the
                  keeper of a menagerie, he confronts the wild beast that he may have the glory of
                  taming him."</p>
               <p>They entered a very neat and modestly furnished parlour, curtained with white
                  muslin and carpeted with domestic manufacture. The furniture was of the simplest
                  kind, though there was an air of taste and even elegance diffused over the room.
                  There was a pretty work-box inlaid with pearl and surrounded by handsomely bound
                  books, on the centre table. These he set down at once as the property of Eulalia.
                  There were beautiful flowers, not in gilded vases, but set in crystals on the
                  mantelpiece. These, he was convinced, had been arranged by the hands of Eulalia.
                  He looked in vain for a piano or guitar, as accompaniments to her enchanting
                  voice.</p>
               <p>"Take a seat, sir," said Mr. Hastings, trying to draw forward a prim-looking
                  arm-chair, which was known in the household by the patronymic of <emph>old
                     maid,</emph> from its peculiarly precise appearance—"and make yourself at home.
                  We don't use any ceremony here."</p>
               <p>"Ceremony is the greatest enemy of enjoyment," said Moreland, waiving the chair of
                  state, and seating himself in one of less ambitious appearance. "I trust I am not
                  encroaching on your hospitality, by accepting your invitation too readily. This is
                  a Sabbath evening, and you may be accustomed to pass it with your family alone. A
                  stranger may intermeddle with your joys. If so, I would not, for any
                  consideration, intrude."</p>
               <p>"Not at all, not at all, sir," replied his host. "We commence our Sundays on
                  Saturday night, and when the Sabbath sun goes down, we feel privileged to enjoy
                  social intercourse with our neighbours and friends; quiet, sober intercourse of
                  course, but we do not object to a friendly call. Stay and take tea with us. We
                  will be happy to have you. Eula, tell your mother a gentleman will partake of our
                  family supper."</p>
               <p>How could Moreland refuse such a cordial invitation? Of course he did not, but
                  accepted it with all imaginable readiness. He could not account for this
                  unexpected hospitality, where he had looked scarcely for ordinary courtesy. He was
                  unconsciously doing Mr. Hastings great injustice. It does not follow, because a
                  man is narrow and one-sided in his views, and bitter and obstinate in his
                  prejudices, that he is destitute of social graces<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000031"/> and domestic virtues. Moreland had his prejudices
                  too, though he did not know it. He had imagined there was very little hospitality
                  at the North, and that strangers were looked upon with a cold and suspicious eye.
                  He thought the hearts of people were cold in proportion as they receded from the
                  burning sun of the tropics, and that passion, the great central fire of the human
                  bosom, giving life and splendour to every other element, was wanting in the less
                  genial latitude he was now crossing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hastings, like most men, was actuated by mixed motives. He believed in the
                  good old scripture injunction of hospitality to strangers, and he was exceedingly
                  fond of making <emph>impressions,</emph> and enlarging the bounds of his
                  influence. He took great pride in his argumentative powers, and thought he should
                  have a dazzling opportunity to display them. He saw in prospective a glorious
                  field of disputation, where he would gather more laurels than he could possibly
                  dispose of. His prophetic glance pierced still further, and he beheld one black
                  wave rolling after another from the Southern shores, before the resistless gales
                  of his eloquence.</p>
               <p>He was very fond of distinction. He loved to have strangers call at his house,
                  assured that when they left the place, they would carry the impression that Mr.
                  Hastings was the greatest man in the village, nay more, the greatest man in the
                  country. Then he was very fond of his children. Eulalia was the pride of his heart
                  and the delight of his eyes. The simple attention of escorting her home pleased
                  him. The caressing kindness to little Dora charmed him; and, though the stranger
                  belonged to a class of men whom he denounced as devoid of humanity, principle, or
                  religion, against whom he had commenced a deadly crusade, with all the fanaticism
                  of Peter the Hermit, and the rashness of Richard Cœur de Lion; moved by all these
                  blended motives, he smiled blandly upon him, giving a gentle friction to his
                  hands, as if to warm and ignite his hospitable feelings.</p>
               <p>It was not long before little Dora came into the room with a hop-skip-and-jump
                  step, announcing that supper was ready; and Mr. Hastings, with a courteous bow,
                  ushered his guest into an adjoining room, where the family board was spread; here
                  he was introduced to "my wife,"—a very intelligent and dignified-looking lady,—and
                  "my son Reuben," a handsome, bright-eyed, auburn-locked youth of about seventeen,
                  who perused the stranger's lineaments with vivid curiosity,—"Eulalia, my daughter,
                  you have already seen." Yes! he had seen Eulalia,—it was a circumstance he was not
                  likely to forget. He had seen her in the house of God, surrounded by a halo of
                  music and prayer;—he had seen her in the cottage of the poor, making the dark and
                  lowly places of life beautiful by her presence;—he now saw her presiding with
                  quiet grace and self-possession at her father's board, for she occupied her
                  mother's seat at the head of the table, behind an old-fashioned, massy silver urn.
                  This shining relic of antiquity reflected brilliantly the<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000032"/> lamp-light that flowed from the centre of the
                  table, and it also seemed to reflect the soft, virgin lustre of Eulalia's
                  illuminated face. It was a real patriarch, this old tiger-footed silver urn,
                  having descended through three generations, and it set off the table
                  wonderfully.</p>
               <p>Dora slided into a seat on the left hand of Moreland, who, in gratitude for the
                  compliment, helped her most munificently to butter and honey, which a glance from
                  her mother's eye admonished her not to eat too lavishly.</p>
               <p>"We are accustomed to wait upon ourselves at table," said Mr. Hastings, as
                  Moreland received his cup of coffee from Eulalia's hand; "I fear our independent
                  mode of living cannot be very agreeable to you, sir, whose customs are so
                  different."</p>
               <p>"On the contrary, nothing can be more agreeable than a family circle like this,
                  uninterrupted by the presence of attendants, oftentimes as useless as they are
                  annoying."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! I thought a table at the South was never considered properly set without
                  a negro placed at the back of every chair."</p>
               <p>"I do not think the number of chairs governs the number of attendants," answered
                  Moreland, with a smile; "though there is usually a superfluity. Yielding to the
                  force of habit, I allow myself to be waited on, without thinking of it, though I
                  consider it by no means indispensable."</p>
               <p>"I am glad you can conform so readily to our plain, republican habits. How do you
                  like our Northern portion of the country, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I see much to admire in the luxuriance of your vegetation, your rich, blooming
                  clover fields and cultivated plains. I admire it most as a proof of the energy and
                  industry of the sons of New England, which can convert your hard and granite soil
                  into regions of beauty and fertility, rivalling the spontaneous richness of the
                  South. I am charmed with your delightful summer climate, so soft, yet
                  invigorating; and I honour your noble institutions. But," he added, "I admire,
                  most of all, the intelligence, refinement, and loveliness of the daughters of New
                  England, to which description has never done justice."</p>
               <p>Surely, Moreland was trying to ingratiate himself in the favour of the family, by
                  this fine and flattering speech; but though it sounded very much like one prepared
                  and polished for the occasion, it was nevertheless spontaneous and sincere. By
                     <emph>pluralizing</emph> the daughter of Mr. Hastings, he had ventured to
                  express an admiration becoming too strong for repression. He forgot the barriers
                  which a few hours before had seemed so insurmountable; he forgot that Mr. Hastings
                  was the avowed enemy of his dearest social and domestic rights and privileges;
                  that probably the very seat which he now occupied was lately filled by a gigantic
                  negro; that the fair hands of Eulalia had poured coffee for him from that silver
                  urn; and that the smile of welcome beamed<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6694-00000033"/>
                  as kindly on one as the other. He remembered only the loveliness of her person,
                  the sweetness of her manners, the inexpressible charm that drew him towards
                  her.</p>
               <p>"Sister Eula stamped that butter," whispered Dora, as his knife severed a yellow
                  rose from its stem. "She made that plum cake, too."</p>
               <p>Moreland smiled at the communication, imparted with the innocent desire of
                  elevating Sister Eula in his estimation, and thought the butter and the cake had a
                  double relish. No one had heard Dora's whispered secret but himself, she had
                  brought her rosy little mouth in such close proximity with his ear.</p>
               <p>"It is not polite to whisper at table, Dora," said her mother, gently, but
                  reprovingly, and Dora hung her head and put her finger in her mouth, with
                  suddenly-acquired awkwardness. Moreland, excessively amused by the remark and its
                  consequences, glanced at Eulalia's hand, which happened to be raised at that
                  moment to shade back a loosened ringlet from her cheek. The glance was suggested
                  by the thought that the hand which had been employed in moulding and spatting that
                  golden ball, and manufacturing that excellent cake, could not possess much
                  feminine delicacy of colour or lineament, but he was pleased to see that it was
                  fair and symmetrical. Not so dazzlingly white as Claudia's snowy, but perjured
                  hand, but pure from the stains of labour, and harmonizing with the delicacy of her
                  face. The truth was, Eulalia knew nothing of the drudgery of housekeeping, and but
                  little of its cares. She was wonderfully expert with her needle, as her father's
                  and brother's shirts, her mother's and sister's dresses could testify, had they
                  tongues to speak. But her mother, who was very proud of Eulalia's beauty, and very
                  careful to keep it in high preservation, had habituated her to sew in gloves, with
                  truncated fingers, ingeniously adapted for such a purpose. She swept and garnished
                  her own room every day till it was a miracle of neatness; but she had been taught,
                  as a regular duty, to draw on a pair of thick woollen mittens before she wielded
                  the broom and exercised the duster. Had it not been for her mother's watchfulness,
                  Eulalia's hands might not have justified the admiration of the fastidiously
                  observing Moreland.</p>
               <p>Though no servant attended the supper table, and Mr. Hastings boasted of their
                  independence, they had a woman of <emph>all work</emph> in the kitchen, whose
                  labour would have shamed the toil of three of Moreland's stoutest slaves. She rose
                  with the dawn of day, and continued her tread-mill course till its close. She
                  baked and brewed and washed and ironed and scrubbed and scoured, hardly giving
                  herself time to talk, or sitting down but to eat. It is true, Mrs. Hastings
                  assisted her in many of these operations, but the heavy burden of toil rested on
                  her, and they dreamed not, because she was willing to assume it for the weekly
                  stipend she received<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6694-00000034"/> ceived, that they
                  exacted too much of her health and strength. It is true, that every night, to use
                  her own words, "she was fagged out and tired e'en a'most to death, but she had it
                  to do, and there was no use in grumbling about it. If she didn't take care of
                  herself, who would? If she didn't try and lay up something for a rainy day, she
                  wondered how she was to be taken care of, if she was sick and had to be laid by."
                  So Betsy Jones toiled on, and her one dollar and a half per week, supplied clothes
                  for herself and orphan brother, who was incapacitated, by lameness, from earning
                  his daily bread. The physician's fees, who attended him, were also drained from
                  the same source. How much she had to lay up for a rainy day may be easily
                  imagined. Betsy had none of the false pride which is often found in her class. She
                  had no <emph>ambition</emph> to put herself upon a perfect equality with her
                  employers. She did not care about sitting down with them at meal time, nor did she
                  disdain the summons of a tinkling bell.</p>
               <p>"I should look putty," she said, "sitting down in my dirty duds by the side of
                  Miss Euly, fixed off in all her niceties. I don't care about sitting down till
                  I've done all my drudgery and all my little chores, and then I'm too jaded out to
                  think of primping and furbishing up for company. If I've got to work I'll work,
                  and done with it, let alone trying to be a lady."</p>
               <p>But with all Betsy's humility, she had a just appreciation of herself, and could
                  assert her dignity, when occasion required, with due emphasis. When Mr. Hastings
                  installed his sable protegé into the honours of the household, when she saw him
                  introduced into the guest chamber, where he swathed his huge limbs in the nice
                  linen sheets she had so carefully bleached and ironed, and she was called upon to
                  make up the bed and arrange the room, she stoutly rebelled, and declared "she
                  wouldn't do no such thing. She wa'n't hired to wait upon a nasty runaway, who she
                  knew never had to work half as hard as she had. Great, lazy, good-for-nothing
                  fellow, that he was. <emph>He</emph> talk about being abused like a dog! Why he
                  was as fat as stall-fed beef, and as strong as a lion."</p>
               <p>"Well, Betsy, I must do it myself then," said Mrs. Hastings, "rather than waste
                  any more words about it. I am sorry, however, to see that you have no more
                  compassion for a poor, hunted, persecuted being, whom my husband has seen fit to
                  receive under his sheltering roof."</p>
               <p>"If the kitchen is good enough for me, it is good enough for such as him,"
                  exclaimed Betsy, opening all the windows energetically, and whisking the
                  counterpane and sheets over the sill.</p>
               <p>"I shall make it myself, Betsy," said Mrs. Hastings, with heroic determination, "I
                  don't want to hear any more grumbling."</p>
               <p>"Just as you please, Miss Hastings," cried Betsy,<pb n="68-69"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000035"/> leaving the room with a resounding step. "He's no
                  more parsecuted than I am, the Lord knows."</p>
               <p>Whatever were Mrs. Hastings's feelings, she expressed no opposition to the will of
                  her lord and master, whom she looked up to as the great philanthropist of the age,
                  as one of those martyr spirits who, though they may weave for themselves a crown
                  of thorns in this world, will exchange it for a diadem of glory in the next.</p>
               <p>After this unexpected digression, caused by little Dora's whisper, we will return
                  to the supper table, or rather to the parlour, for there is no one at the table
                  now but Mrs. Hastings and Betsy, who are both busy in putting away the best china,
                  the cut glass preserve dishes, and silver urn, brought out for the occasion.</p>
               <p>"Now, that's a real gentleman," said Betsy, peeping into the parlour through the
                  crack of the door. "I'd as lieves wait upon him as not. He's as handsome as a
                  pictur, and he don't look a bit proud neither, only sort of grand, as t'were. If I
                  was Miss Euly—la sus!"</p>
               <p>"Betsy!" said Mrs. Hastings, in a tone of grave rebuke, "you had better attend to
                  your dishes."</p>
               <p>Betsy flourished her napkin, but she would peep a little more.</p>
               <p>"La me!" she exclaimed, "if they ha'n't got the singing books out, and, there,
                  they are all sot round the middle table. Did you ever? Well! Miss Euly does sing
                  like a martingale."</p>
               <p>As there is no use in peeping through an aperture when we have the freedom of the
                  house, we will enter the parlour and seat ourselves in the <emph>old maid,</emph>
                  which, being too heavy to be moved with convenience to the centre table, chances
                  to be standing vacant in the corner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hastings was proud of his daughter's singing, as well he might be. It was
                  really music to his soul, as well as his ear. He had a fine voice himself, and so
                  had Reuben. And even little Dora had been taught to sing the praises of her God
                  and King, with childhood's cherub tones.</p>
               <p>"It is our custom," said Mr. Hastings, rubbing his hands slowly and gently, "it is
                  our custom, Mr. Moreland, to have some sacred music every Sunday evening. We have
                  no instruments but those which God has given us, and which we try to tune to His
                  glory. My daughter, here, has a tolerable voice, my son sings a pretty good bass,
                  and I myself can get through a tune without much difficulty. Will you join us,
                  sir? You look as if you could help us, if you pleased."</p>
               <p>"With all my heart," replied Moreland, taking a seat at Eulalia's side, and
                  appropriating a singing book for their mutual benefit. "If I can do nothing
                  better, I can at least turn the leaves, as I listen."</p>
               <p>But he could do a great deal better, and it was not long before his voice was
                  heard mingling with the sweet hosannas of Eulalia, while bending over the same
                  book, so near, that her warm, pure breath floated against his glowing cheek. He
                  was carried back to the days of<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6694-00000036"/> his
                  childhood, when his mother taught him the songs of Zion, while cradled in her arms
                  or pillowed on her knee. The recollection softened and moved him to such a degree
                  that his voice choked and then ceased. Eulalia involuntarily turned and looked in
                  his face, and, surprised at the emotion she saw depicted there, her own voice
                  faltered. There was something so exquisitely soft and sympathetic in the
                  expression of her dark hazel eyes, so innocent, yet so full of intelligence, that
                  Moreland felt bewildered by the glance.</p>
               <p>"Oh!" thought he, and it was with difficulty he refrained from expressing his
                  thoughts aloud, "I am oppressed with a sense of beauty and sweetness unknown
                  before. All that is pathetic and holy in the past rises up to hallow and subdue
                  the intoxication of the present moment. Strange, that I, born amid the sunny
                  groves of the South, should come to the cold clime of New England to find an
                  influence as warm, as powerful and instantaneous as is ever felt under the glowing
                  skies of the tropics."</p>
               <p>"We do not seem to make out quite as well with that tune as the others," said Mr.
                  Hastings, thinking Moreland was probably out of practice and could not help
                  stumbling over some difficult notes; "perhaps we had better try another; or
                  perhaps we had better stop altogether. This must be dull amusement to you,
                  sir."</p>
               <p>"On the contrary, my feelings have only been too deeply interested," replied
                  Moreland, ashamed of the interruption he had caused. "This sweet family music,
                  these words of adoration and praise, heard under the stranger's roof, reminded me
                  so vividly of my own early home, that my heart is softened to almost boyish
                  weakness. I pray you to continue."</p>
               <p>After singing some charming anthems, in which Mrs. Hastings, whose voice was only
                  less sweet than Eulalia's, also joined, the books were closed, the chairs moved
                  back, and Moreland reluctantly rose to depart.</p>
               <p>"No hurry, sir," said Mr. Hastings; "happy to have you sit longer. Happy to have
                  you call again. How long do you think of remaining in our village?"</p>
               <p>"I did think of leaving to-morrow," replied his guest; "but," involuntarily
                  looking at Eulalia, "I may probably remain a few days longer."</p>
               <p>"You stop at Mr. Grimby's?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, I shall call and have a few hours' chat with you. I like you, sir—excuse my
                  frankness—and I want to do you good. I think I can. I am a man who have read and
                  studied and reflected a great deal, and have arrived, I flatter myself, at very
                  just views of men and things. In the mean time,"—here he opened a secretary, whose
                  glass doors were lined with green silk, and took out a bundle of papers,—"allow me
                  to present you with these papers. Give them, if you please, a careful perusal, and
                  if you are a candid man, as I trust you are, you cannot fail of being a convert to
                  my opinions.<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6694-00000037"/> Yes, sir," continued he,
                  warming with his subject, "you will find my arguments unanswerable. They are
                  founded on truth. 'The eternal days of God are hers,' and it is in vain to contend
                  against her omnipotent power."</p>
               <p>Moreland reddened; he saw the package consisted of numbers of the "Emancipator,"
                  edited by Mr. Hastings himself. The gauntlet was now thrown down; he must take it
                  up and enter the lists of controversy, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coute qui
                     coute.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>"I am an earnest seeker of truth, myself," replied he, "and, as you say, I trust a
                  candid one. Should you prove to me that my preconceived opinions are erroneous, I
                  will most ingenuously acknowledge it. But I, too, have read and studied and
                  reflected, and if I have arrived at different conclusions, I shall call upon you
                  to examine mine, with equal frankness and impartiality."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, certainly," cried the philanthropist;—"there's not a more impartial
                  man in the world than myself, or one more open to conviction. But once convinced I
                  am <emph>right,</emph> you might as well attempt to move the everlasting hills
                  from their base, as shake the groundwork of my firm and rooted opinions. I will
                  call and see you to-morrow."</p>
               <p>And thus, after exchanging the usual courtesies of the parting moment, terminated
                  Moreland's first visit to the home of Eulalia Hastings.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>WHEN Moreland returned to the inn, not seeing Albert, and feeling very thirsty, he
                  walked through the passage leading to the back part of the house to a bench where
                  a bucket of water was usually standing. In so doing, he had to pass the kitchen,
                  which, unlike those of the South, belonged to the main suite of apartments, and
                  was only separated from the dining-room by an apartment which served as a
                  store-room or pantry. Though it was a warm summer evening, the blaze roaring in
                  the large chimney illuminated the whole passage through the open door. A woman was
                  seated on the hearth stirring something in a large oven with a long stick, and, as
                  she stirred, the aromatic smoke, which rose from the iron censer, was impregnated
                  with the rich odour of burning coffee. Albert was standing on the opposite side of
                  the fire-place, with a very <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nonchalant</foreign> air,
                  watching the operation and inhaling the aroma in his expanded nostrils. The
                  perspiration was dripping from the poor woman's brow, which she kept wiping with
                  one hand, while she plied with the other her oaken wand. Moreland recognised<pb
                     n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6694-00000038"/> the landlady, Mrs. Grimby, whom he had
                  seen bustling about the house, though she had never made her appearance at table.
                  His chivalrous regard for woman was quite pained at seeing her thus unpleasantly
                  and laboriously occupied, while his boy stood idly gazing by; and, stepping across
                  the threshold, he accosted the landlady, much to her surprise and embarrassment.
                  She had no cause for shame, for nothing could be more neat or well arranged than
                  the kitchen furniture; and the white floor, unstained by grease, bore evidence of
                  a thorough Saturday's scouring. Rows of shining tin utensils, bright and
                  glittering as burnished silver, adorned the walls on one side, shelves of white
                  crockery the other. It was altogether an attractive, rejoicing-looking room; and
                  had it been a December instead of a June evening, and the atmosphere sparkling
                  with frost instead of silvering in a summer mist, Moreland could have made himself
                  very comfortable in the midst of that culinary finery.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you make my boy assist you, madam?" said he; "he has nothing else to
                  do, and can stand the heat much better than yourself."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir," she replied, dusting a chair, and placing it near the door while
                  she was speaking; "I couldn't think of setting him to work, I'm sure. This is
                  nothing but play, to what I've been doing these several days,—my best help is gone
                  home, Nancy Brown, she did the work of two common girls; but she got sick, and I
                  do think she's done her last job in this world. I hain't been able to get any one
                  in her place yet, and somebody's got to do the work; it's, as Mr. Grimby says,
                  them that keeps tavern are as bad off as the slaves are, and I know it's true; but
                  folks are obliged to live."</p>
               <p>"Albert, stir that coffee," said his master; "I am astonished you have not offered
                  to do it yourself."</p>
               <p>The mulatto sprang forward, seized the stick, and, giving it first a graceful
                  flourish round his head, began to stir, with vigorous hand, the brown and smoking
                  kernels.</p>
               <p>"Why, Mars. Russell," said he, with an apologetic smile, "you must 'xcuse me this
                  time; I have been conversing with the lady, and forgot all about offering to help
                  her; I'm willing, though."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Mrs. Grimby, "he seems mighty kind. It is warm work," she added,
                  drawing back from the glowing hearth, and exposing her fervid face to the evening
                  breeze that came in through an open casement.</p>
               <p>"I beg you will take the liberty to call upon my boy whenever you wish his
                  assistance," said Moreland, pitying the poor overtasked woman; "he can do almost
                  anything; you will find he has a light foot and an active hand."</p>
               <p>"Who's going to wait on you, Mars. Russell?" asked the mulatto, with a slight
                  shrug of the shoulders. "Who's going to brush your clothes, black your boots, and
                  do a heap of things beside?"</p>
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6694-00000039"/>
               <p>"You can do all that I require, and have a great deal of time left, Albert,"
                  replied his master. "I expect you will conform to my wishes, and do credit to your
                  Southern training. Do you find it difficult to supply yourselves with servants,
                  madam?" said he, addressing the landlady, not from mere curiosity, but a desire to
                  inform himself of the true condition of the labouring class.</p>
               <p>"We never think of calling them servants," replied Mrs. Grimby; "they won't allow
                  us to do that. They wouldn't stay with us if we did. We speak of them as
                     <emph>help, hired help,</emph> but never as servants. Yes, it is sometimes next
                  to impossible to get anybody for love or money. All the girls are for going to the
                  factories, where they have higher wages and lighter work. I don't think we can
                  blame them much, though for my part, I'd rather, a great deal, do housework, than
                  stand all day long behind the wheels and looms, with the cotton fuz choking the
                  lungs and stopping up the nostrils. They think it more genteel; but I don't see
                  any difference, for my part. I never did think there was any disgrace in work; if
                  I did, I should lead a mighty mean life of it.</p>
               <p>"You took tea at Squire Hastings', didn't you?" said she, first making the
                  assertion, and then asking the question.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Moreland, with a sudden bounding of the heart, which it was well
                  the landlady could not see. "Are you acquainted with the family?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure I am. There's not many families in the village that I don't know. I
                  used to visit Mrs. Hastings, but since Mr. Grimby took the tavern I've no time to
                  go nowhere. Squire Hastings is the knowingest gentleman anywhere about, and Miss
                  Eulaly is the nicest girl I ever saw in my life. I don't suppose there's a girl in
                  the county that's had as many good offers as she has; but she don't seem to take
                  to anybody. I don't blame her for setting store by herself, for beauty is her
                  least merit."</p>
               <p>Moreland thought the landlady a very discerning as well as industrious woman, and
                  felt more than ever disposed to give her the assistance of his leisurely servant.
                  He also thought her a woman of delicacy; for in the course of their conversation
                  she had neither directly nor indirectly attacked those habits and customs, so at
                  variance with her own. He would willingly have remained longer, listening to the
                  praises of Eulalia, but he did not care about Mr. Grimby's coming into the kitchen
                  and finding him so familiarly established there; so leaving Albert at his post of
                  honour, he retired to his own chamber, and began to peruse the documents which Mr.
                  Hastings had placed in his hand.</p>
               <p>At first he glanced over them carelessly, as if fulfilling an irksome task imposed
                  upon him; then his attention became fixed; sometimes a disdainful smile curled
                     his<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6694-00000040"/> lip, then a hot flush rose to his
                  temples, or an indignant frown contracted his brow. The articles were well
                  written, and calculated to give an impression of extreme candour and philanthropy.
                  There was much truth in them, but the true was so ingeniously woven with what was
                  false, none but the most experienced eye could detect the tinselry from the gold.
                  There were facts, too, but so distorted, so wrenched from their connexion with
                  other extenuating facts, that they presented a mangled and bleeding mass of
                  fragments, instead of a solid body of truth.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible," he exclaimed, "that such things can be published and circulated
                  and read by a rational and intelligent community as truth, as Christian truth,
                  published, too, under the broad banner of philanthropy, nay, more, under the
                  banner of the cross of Christ? Were they speaking of the dark ages of the world,
                  over whose sanguinary archives the dim and mouldering veil of antiquity is
                  floating, we might not wonder; but that such misrepresentations should be made of
                  our own times, of our own country, by those who might inform themselves of the
                  reality, is indeed incredible. Why, if I believed one-fourth part of what I see
                  stated here, I would forsake my native regions, the grave of my mother, the home
                  of my youth, the friends of my manhood, property, reputation, everything, making
                  my whole life an expiatory sacrifice for the involuntary sins of my bygone years.
                  I should think every gale wafted from our sweet jessamine bowers was laden with
                  pestilential exhalations, and every sunbeam darting from our lovely skies would
                  turn into a burning arrow, fastening into the soul."</p>
               <p>He rose, greatly excited, and walked to the window that looked out upon the
                  village church. He drew back the curtain and gazed on the tranquil beauty of the
                  night scene. He could see the outline of the lofty dome, crowned with the jewelry
                  of heaven, and a little farther, he distinguished a lighted window, glimmering
                  through the foliage, which he believed belonged to the chamber of Eulalia. How
                  peaceful it looked, that solitary light, streaming through the dewy shades and
                  mingling with the stellar splendours of the heavens! Gradually he raised his
                  thoughts above that solitary light, above those stellar glories, above the deep,
                  ethereal blue of the zenith, till, ascending higher and higher, they reached the
                  great Source of all. For a few moments his soul seemed to bask in the blaze of
                  eternal truth. The passions of men, their vain strife, their petty controversies
                  and warring interests, dwindled down into little specks, scarcely distinguishable
                  in the full blaze of the Godhead. "He who sitteth in the heavens shall laugh,"
                  thought Moreland, during his brief apocalypse. "He shall laugh at the pitiful
                  devices of man, and sweep away every refuge of lies. In the great golden scales of
                  immutable justice our <emph>motives</emph> will be weighed, and when they are
                  found wanting, as they too oft will be, frail and fallible beings as we are, the
                  angel of mercy will plead in our behalf.<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6694-00000041"/>
                  Oh, glorious thought! that we are to be judged hereafter by God, not man."</p>
               <p>With this sublime reliance he fell asleep, and dreamed that he was wandering in
                  his own native bowers, by the side of Eulalia Hastings.</p>
               <p>At a rather late hour of the next afternoon, Mr. Hastings called and was received
                  by Moreland, with due courtesy and cordiality. He invited him into the parlour,
                  but Mr. Hastings suggested a seat in the passage, where a fine current of air was
                  flowing. Moreland would have preferred a less public place, for the passage of a
                  country inn is a thoroughfare for loungers and smokers and drinkers, who feel that
                  they have as good a right to be there as the greatest nabob in the land. But Mr.
                  Hastings was so accustomed to speak in public and to feed on public applause, that
                  he did not like to confine to the individual ear, sentiments which would
                  undoubtedly enlighten and regenerate mankind. He required the excitement of
                  numbers to elicit the latent enthusiasm of his intellect. His arguments, like the
                  claws of the lion, were embedded in a soft covering, and it was only when he came
                  in collision with others that their strong gripe was felt and their clenching
                  power acknowledged.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir!" said he, applying the usual friction to his ready matches, "I hope
                  you are pleased with the papers I gave you for perusal?"</p>
               <p>"Pleased!" repeated Moreland, and, in spite of his desire to keep it back, a
                  haughty flush swept over his brow; "you did not expect that I should be pleased
                  with what, if true, would make me one of the veriest scoundrels on the face of the
                  earth."</p>
               <p>"Softly, softly, sir. We make no individual remarks,—conscience may apply them,
                  but they are of general signification. The man who is not willing to merge all
                  personal feelings in the good of the human race is unworthy the name of a
                  philanthropist or a Christian. We are the champions of truth, justice, and
                  humanity, and wage eternal war with falsehood, oppression, and cruelty. Like the
                  ancient warriors, who went forth in their war-chariots, from which a thousand
                  scythes were gleaming, ready to mow down all opposing ranks,—we suffer the wheels
                  of justice to roll down, though the votaries of error be crushed in their majestic
                  evolutions."</p>
               <p>"You have made a very happy comparison, sir," answered Moreland, from whose brow
                  the angry flush had entirely faded; "your blows are as indiscriminate and aimless
                  as the bristling weapons to which you allude. As you seem to have so much respect
                  for ancient authorities, suppose we imitate the famous example of the Roman and
                  Alban brothers, who decided, by their threefold combat, the destinies of their
                  countries. I am willing to stand forth as the champion of mine, for you compel me
                  to draw a dividing line between the North and the South, thus anticipating that
                  division of interests which your uncalculating zeal will surely bring about."</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6694-00000042"/>
               <p>By this time, the bar-room, which was nearly opposite them, was filling up with
                  eager listeners, whose ears were open and distended, but from whose mouths the
                  fumes of tobacco were steaming, till the hall was clouded with this incense of the
                  tavern. Moreland was glad to see his friend, the bridge architect, making his way
                  through the crowd and taking a quiet seat by the door.</p>
               <p>"Well, let us begin the combat by one plain, positive question?" said Mr.
                  Hastings, his keen black eyes sparkling like ignited coals. "Do you justify
                  slavery?"</p>
               <p>"Were you to ask me if I justified the <emph>slave trade,</emph>—that traffic
                  forced upon us, by that very British government which now taunts and upbraids us
                  with such bitterness and rancour for the institution whose cornerstone itself has
                  laid,—I would answer <emph>No!</emph> but if you mean the involuntary slavery
                  which surrounds me and my brethren of the South, I reply, I can justify it; we had
                  no more to do with its existence than our own. We are not responsible for it,
                  though we are for the duties it involves, the heaviest perhaps ever imposed upon
                  man."</p>
               <p>"Do you assert that you are not responsible for its <emph>continuance;</emph> that
                  you have not the power to break the chains another's hand has forged; to restore
                  the freedom which was as much the birthright of their ancestors as your own?"</p>
               <p>"We have the <emph>power</emph> to do many things which reason and right forbid.
                  We have the power to cast thousands of helpless, ignorant, reckless beings on
                  their own resources, or to commit them to the tender mercies of those who, while
                  they rave of their injuries, hold out no hand to redress them; but we believe it
                  our duty to take care of them, to make the life of servitude, which seems their
                  present destiny, as much as possible a life of comfort and enjoyment; and, while
                  we reap the benefit of their labour and the fruit of their toil in their day of
                  vigour, to nurse them in sickness, provide for them in old age, and save them from
                  the horrors and miseries of want."</p>
               <p>"I should like to know how many masters believe this their duty," interrupted Mr.
                  Hastings; "or, believing it, fulfil the obligations you have described. I should
                  like to have you explain the tales of cruelty and suffering, the cries of anguish
                  that have rent the very heavens, and moved the spirit of men to a resistance that
                  can never again be subdued to passiveness."</p>
               <p>"That there are hard and cruel masters," replied Moreland; "that there is in
                  consequence much suffering and wrong, I grieve to acknowledge; for wherever human
                  nature exists, man has abused his privileges, and the cry of human suffering
                  pierces the ear of the Almighty. But no sufferings which they can possibly endure,
                  no degradation to which they are ever forced in their present condition, can
                  compare to the misery, the degradation and hopelessness of their lot, in their
                  native Africa, where they are doomed to a slavery more galling<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000043"/> than imagination can conceive, and steeped in a
                  superstition so dark and loathsome that the soul shudders at the contemplation.
                  Have you never read of the hecatombs of human victims slaughtered at the grave of
                  a barbarian chief, or the shrieks and groans of wives, sacrificed with the most
                  terrific rites, to the manes of their husbands? I will not speak of the horrors of
                  cannibalism. There is no need of calling up such revolting images. I only wished
                  to present before you a faint picture of the native African, and contrast it with
                  even the most degraded of our Southern slaves."</p>
               <p>"Sir," exclaimed Mr. Hastings, "pardon me for saying it—you are begging the
                  question. You could give no better proof of the weakness of your cause, than the
                  manner in which you elude our arguments. I do not pretend to speculate upon their
                  condition in their native country. We know but very little about it, and I doubt
                  not the accounts we hear are highly coloured and monstrously exaggerated. I never
                  presume to arraign the Almighty for any of his arrangements and dispensations. He
                  placed the negro in Africa, and there he ought to remain, in spite of the avarice
                  and cupidity of his white brethren."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" replied Moreland, "I am astonished that you do not question the justice
                  and mercy of God, in creating this subservient and benighted race, with lineaments
                  so devoid of beauty and grace, and swathing them in a skin, whose hue is the
                  blackness of darkness, making ing a boundary line between us, as distinct, yea,
                  more distinct than that which severs the noonday from midnight. The mulatto, in
                  whose veins the blood of the white man is flowing and brightening their dusky
                  tide, partakes of the beauty and intelligence of our race,—but take the native
                  African, examine his lineaments, features, and peculiar characteristics, and say
                  if he came from the hands of God in a state of equality with ourselves, endowed
                  with equal physical and intellectual powers, intended for our bosom companions and
                  familiar friends."</p>
               <p>"If you are about to hide yourself in the counsels of the Almighty," cried Mr.
                  Hastings, with increasing excitement of manner, "I give up the discussion. I see
                  you close up every avenue to conviction, and indulge in a sophistry I consider
                  unworthy of an honest, upright mind. Sir, we might talk in this way for six
                  thousand years without changing my immutable conviction, that, as long as you
                  allow the existence of slavery, you are living in sin and iniquity, that you are
                  violating the laws of God and man, incurring the vengeance of heaven, and the
                  retributions of eternity. I use strong language, sir, for the occasion justifies
                  it. I am a philanthropist, sir, a champion of truth, and I have sworn to defend it
                  at any sacrifice, yea, that of life itself, if the offering be required."</p>
               <p>"But if you could be convinced," said Moreland, becoming more calm and energetic
                  as his opponent grew<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6694-00000044"/> fiery and vehement,
                  "that, by your premature efforts, and overheated zeal, you increase the evils,
                  which time alone can remedy; that you only rivet more closely the bonds you rashly
                  attempt to wrench asunder by the hand of violence; that, instead of being the
                  friends, you are in reality the worst enemies of the bondman whose cause you
                  espouse; that, by adopting a kinder, more rational course, you would find in us
                  co-labourers and brethren, instead of antagonists; if you could be convinced of
                  all this, sir, would you not lay down your weapons, and reflect on the
                  consequences that may flow from your present course of action?"</p>
               <p>"I never can be convinced, sir; it is utterly impossible. I know that I am right,
                  and that you are wrong. This conviction is one of those first, great truths, which
                  are learned by intuition, not by the slow process of reasoning. God is both the
                  teacher and the judge. You are wasting breath, sir. I am sorry to inform you of
                  it, but you are wasting much precious breath on me."</p>
               <p>"I have not sought this discussion," replied the Southerner, "and I have no wish
                  to prolong it, at the risk of kindling feelings of personal animosity. I came
                  among you, a peaceful stranger, pressing upon you no claims, assuming no
                  privileges, but what you all freely share. It is true I have met with much
                  liberality and expansion of feeling, much hospitality and generous appreciation,
                  especially among the princely-spirited Bostonians, where I found many a brother in
                  heart and soul. I have become acquainted, too, with noble, liberal, and candid men
                  wherever I have travelled in your Northern regions; but I have also met with those
                  whose vocation it seemed to trample on our rights, to tread upon them as they
                  would grapes in the winepress, though blood instead of purple juice gushed up
                  beneath their feet. It has been mine to oppose the shield of defence to the sword
                  of aggression, though I would gladly lay aside all belligerent weapons, and
                  cultivate that friendly communion, which no sectional interest should disturb or
                  destroy."</p>
               <p>Moreland had an exceedingly clear, sweet, and finely modulated voice. He never
                  lost the command of it by passion or excitement, it never became indistinct
                  through diffidence or confusion of ideas; but, swelling like a well-tuned
                  melodious instrument, charmed the ear, while it riveted the attention. In this
                  respect he had a great advantage over Mr. Hastings, whose voice often shivered and
                  broke, when pitched on too high a key, or became thick and incoherent in the
                  vehemence of argument. The loungers in the bar-room, who had long been accustomed
                  to the eloquence of the latter, listened with a keener, deeper interest, to the
                  thrilling accents of the former. The tones, the manner, the sentiments were new.
                  They began to think there could be two sides to a question; that there was a
                  possibility, though Squire Hastings was certainly a remarkably great man, one of
                  the greatest men that ever lived, that other men had some sense too. The stranger
                  had a good deal of <emph>spunk</emph>
                  <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6694-00000045"/> —they liked to see it. They liked a man
                  who knew how to stand up for himself, even if he wasn't on the right side of the
                  argument. They were for giving him fair play, sea-room and land-room, and waited,
                  with segars suspended in the air, and necks stretched eagerly forward, for the
                  continuation of the scene; but Mr. Hastings, fearful of the fascinating influence
                  of his opponent on the minds he considered subservient to his own, closed the
                  discussion by a sudden and unexpected stroke of policy. Advancing with great
                  frankness of manner towards Moreland, he held out his hand, saying,</p>
               <p>"We had better renew our conversation some future hour. We are both getting a
                  little too warm for the season. I hope, however, you will not believe me actuated
                  by personal hostility. On the contrary, as I said before, I like you very much as
                  a man. Come and see me again while you stay, and I have no doubt we shall
                  understand each other better. I do not want you to go away with the impression
                  that Northern hospitality and liberality are confined to the walls of our
                  metropolis."</p>
               <p>Moreland did not forget that it was the father of Eulalia that thus addressed him,
                  and he suffered his hand to close over the hand of the philanthropist, and
                  promised to renew the social pleasures of the preceding evening.</p>
               <p>"Well," said Mr. Grimby, after Mr. Hastings had retired, "I never saw the squire
                  in such a tight fix before fore. He's got somebody now that knows how to talk
                  about as well as he does, and I'm glad to see him pushed a little. I shouldn't
                  wonder if you deserved the most credit, for it is harder to be smart on the wrong
                  side than the right. Ha! ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>The laugh was echoed in the bar-room, for the landlord had the reputation of being
                  a <emph>wit,</emph> and all his sayings received their full amount of credit.
                  Moreland was not sorry to escape from so uncongenial an atmosphere; and joining
                  his friend, the architect, he recovered, in a long walk through the skirts of the
                  village, the serenity of his temper and the equilibrium of his mind. There was
                  something in the clear good sense and calm rationality of Mr. Brooks,
                  inexpressibly soothing to his chafed and wounded spirit. It was pleasant to meet
                  with one who had broad and comprehensive views of men and things, views which were
                  not confined to the narrow horizon of the present, but extended into the
                  boundlessness of the future.</p>
               <p>That night, as he stood near the window in deep meditation, deliberately drawing
                  on his gloves, Albert came and stood before him, with a very dissatisfied
                  countenance.</p>
               <p>"Mars. Russell," said he, putting his left hand in his bosom and giving a kind of
                  flourish with his right, "please, how long you going to stay here, in this little,
                  mean, no-account place?"</p>
               <p>Moreland started. It was the very question he was<pb n="90-91"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000046"/> asking himself, though put in a very different
                  manner, and he had no answer ready for either interrogator.</p>
               <p>"Why, are you tired, Albert?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, master, that I am. And if I've got to work for Mistress Grimby all this
                  time, I don't care how soon we start. She's kept me on the go ever since the day
                  broke, a scrubbing and scouring on all fours, till I can hardly stand up straight.
                  She took you at your word, Mars. Russell, I can tell you. She's had a real day's
                  work out of my bones."</p>
               <p>Albert sucked in his breath, and, stooping down, rubbed his knees, with a
                  significant gesture. "Then, I'm so dirty, master. I'm really ashamed to look you
                  in the eye. I'm willing to do anything for you, Mars. Russell, but I have no
                  opinion of making myself a dog, for folks that ain't no quality after all."</p>
               <p>Moreland could not help thinking that his politeness had been understood in its
                  broadest sense, and he regretted the benevolent impulse which had urged him to
                  make the offer. He knew he should give more offence by withdrawing his services,
                  than he had won gratitude by their spontaneous offer. He sympathized, too, with
                  Albert's wounded aristocracy, which had never bled so copiously before.</p>
               <p>"My poor boy," said he, smiling at Albert's half-comic, half-rueful look, "you
                  have not been used to such hard usage, I must acknowledge. It is well to have a
                  taste of what the Northern bondwomen have to endure, so that you may be more
                  contented with your own lot. I suppose the good lady herself worked as hard as
                  yourself."</p>
               <p>"Yes, master, there's no denying that, and she didn't grumble neither, not much. I
                  do have a feeling for women, and am willing to do as much for them as anybody
                  else—but there's bounds, Mars. Russell."</p>
               <p>"I will see about it, Albert. You need not do anything more to-night; I shall not
                  be abroad late."</p>
               <p>He was about to close the door, when Albert's "Mars. Russell," in an unusually
                  deprecating tone, arrested his steps.</p>
               <p>"Please, master, how long you going to stay?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot tell, Albert,—are you getting home-sick?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, that I am, master; I'm most pined away to a skeleton aready. They give me a
                  plenty to eat, but not of the right sort. I hain't set eyes on a mouthful of bacon
                  and greens since I ben here. I've got nobody to sing and dance with; and I've most
                  forgot how to laugh. Hi, Mars. Russell, if I ever get back home again, the way
                  I'll jump Georgia motions will be a caution."</p>
               <p>"We will be at home soon," cried Moreland, laughing, while a vision of bright
                  ebony faces, dancing and singing by the light of the moon, under the boughs of the
                  old pine-trees, rose to his remembrance. A few minutes later, he stood under the
                  dewy branches of the sycamores, which seemed, as they rustled in the night gale,
                  to whisper the sweet name of Eulalia.</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6694-00000047"/>
               <p>He was invited into the family sitting-room, and welcomed with great cordiality.
                  There was a delightful home-atmosphere diffused around every object. Mr. Hastings
                  was sitting, with a book, in which he seemed earnestly engaged, in his right hand,
                  while his left arm was thrown round Dora, who was enthroned on his knees. Reuben,
                  the student youth, was bending over a heavy and venerable-looking tome that was
                  spread open before him; his head was leaning on his hand, which was half buried in
                  a mass of dark red, glowing curls. Mrs. Hastings was busily engaged in knitting,
                  that most cosy and domestic of all occupations; and Eulalia's hand held a roll of
                  snowy linen, in which her threaded needle was brightly glittering. The graceful
                  paraphernalia of woman's industry was round her. Her dress was the perfection of
                  neatness and taste; she rose at his entrance, while her soft yet thrilling eye
                  beamed with the welcome her modest lips dared not think of uttering.</p>
               <p>Dora bounded from her father's knee with the lightness of a fawn, and openly
                  expressed her rapture at seeing him again. Moreland's warm heart responded to her
                  joyous greeting. No barrier of ceremony interposed its cold restraint between him
                  and his sweet child friend. He could take her in his arms, kiss her blooming
                  cheek, and feel drawn closer to Eulalia by these tender, innocent caresses. He
                  could take many a liberty, under pretext of amusing his little companion, which he
                  would not have done without her participation. He would not have dared to
                  penetrate into the mysteries of Eulalia's rosewood work-box, but Dora drew it
                  towards her, and displayed her politeness by exhibiting, one by one, its hoarded
                  treasures. Almost everything it contained had a history, which the young
                  chatterbox was eager to tell.</p>
               <p>"My dear, I fear you are troublesome," said her mother. "You had better get down
                  and sit in a chair. You must not appropriate Mr. Moreland's visit to
                  yourself."</p>
               <p>"Who did you come to see?" asked the child, looking smilingly into his
                  eyes—"Sister Eula?"</p>
               <p>Every one laughed at this abrupt question, even Eulalia, though the pale blush of
                  her cheek indicated a transient confusion.</p>
               <p>"What makes you think I came to see Sister Eula, more than yourself?" asked
                  Moreland, thinking the child had most marvellous penetration.</p>
               <p>"Cause you look at her so hard," cried Dora, in a confidential half-whisper, "and
                  cause she's so pretty."</p>
               <p>The pale blush-rose on Eulalia's cheek turned to crimson, and Moreland himself was
                  conscious of an uncomfortable glow, while the student youth actually shouted with
                  laughter.</p>
               <p>"My dear," said Mrs. Hastings gravely, "you are entirely too forward. You talk too
                  much for a little girl. You must go to bed immediately."</p>
               <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6694-00000048"/>
               <p>"Please, ma, I won't talk any more," exclaimed the little culprit. "I ain't a bit
                  sleepy."</p>
               <p>Moreland pleaded eloquently in her behalf. He said she deserved a reward for
                  calling such a bright and beautiful colour to her sister's cheek; that he admired
                  her discrimination, and thanked her for giving him credit for so much good taste
                  and judgment. So sportively and gracefully did he bear himself through the
                  awkwardness of the moment, that it was soon forgotten, and conversation flowed on
                  without pause or interruption. There was a cluster of flowers standing in the
                  centre of the table.</p>
               <p>"You like flowers, do you not?" said he to Eulalia.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Like is too cold a word," she replied. "I love them next to human
                  beings. They have a language to me, deeper than words, sweeter even than
                  music."</p>
               <p>"If you want beautiful flowers, you must come to the South," he said. "All that
                  you cultivate here with so much care, grows wild in our forests and enamels our
                  green savannas. The yellow jessamine gilds our woods with its blossoming gold, the
                  virgin's bower twines its soft purplish wreath with the rosy clusters of the
                  multi-flora, and the coral honeysuckle rivals the scarlet bloom of your mountain
                  ash-trees. You have no conception of the beauty of some of our Southern
                  landscapes, the luxuriance of our gardens, the fragrance of our flowers."</p>
               <p>"As I never expect to witness these beautiful scenes," replied Eulalia, "I must be
                  content with the productions of our colder soil. As I cannot compare them with
                  yours, I enjoy ours as far as my taste has been developed, though I am conscious
                  of capacities of beauty which have never yet been exercised—and probably never
                  will be."</p>
               <p>As she said this, her voice saddened, and her eye looked pensive under the shade
                  of its drooping lashes.</p>
               <p>"I wish <emph>I</emph> could see those pretty flowers!" said Dora. "Do you live a
                  great way off?"</p>
               <p>"A great way," replied Moreland; smiling, "but I'll take you home with me, if
                  you'll go. I'll make you a bower of roses, and you shall be Queen of the blooming
                  year!"</p>
               <p>"Will you?—may I?" she exclaimed, then jumping down, she ran to her father, who
                  seemed in profound meditation. "Pa, may I go home with Mr. Moreland, and live with
                  him in a beautiful bower?"</p>
               <p>"Foolish, foolish child!" he cried, "you know not what you ask."</p>
               <p>The words were nothing in themselves,—they might refer to the distance to be
                  overcome, to the impractibility of the thing; but Moreland felt there was a deeper
                  meaning, and if literally translated would read thus:—</p>
               <p>"Foolish child! you know not that beneath those beautiful flowers is concealed the
                  bite of the serpent, the sting of the adder. Though fair and smiling to the
                  eye,—thou bright and sunny land!—yet it shall be<pb n="96-97"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000049"/> better for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
                  judgment than for thee."</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> should like to travel in the South," cried Reuben, lifting his
                  eyes from his book, and speaking with great animation. "I should like, of all
                  things, to visit the Southern States?"</p>
               <p>"Why, my son?" asked Mr. Hastings, in a tone of grave surprise.</p>
               <p>"I have heard so much about them, I want to judge for myself," replied the youth,
                  with decision.</p>
               <p>"Come and visit me," said Moreland, observing a fire and intelligence in the
                  countenance of the youth which he had not noticed before, "the woods of Carolina
                  and Georgia furnish rare sport for the hunter, and our streams abound in
                  fish."</p>
               <p>"Reuben has tasks before him somewhat less fascinating than hunting and fishing,"
                  said his father; "but rather more indispensable. We have not quite as much leisure
                  here as you gentlemen of the South. Time, with us, is wealth; and we realize, in
                  its fullest sense, the meaning of golden moments and the diamond sands of the
                  hour-glass. Sir," added he, fixing his keen eyes steadfastly on Moreland's face,
                  "I presume, from the hospitalities you are offering my children, that you are a
                  married gentlemen."</p>
               <p>"I have been married," replied Moreland, turning very pale, then reddening even to
                  the hue of crimson.</p>
               <p>"Your wife is dead?" continued Mr. Hastings.</p>
               <p>"No, sir; she who was my wife still lives; but she no longer bears my name. I am
                  free from the marriage bond, but not by death."</p>
               <p>There was a pause after these unfortunate questions. Mr. Hastings hemmed and
                  cleared his throat, and Moreland, perhaps fearful of being probed still deeper,
                  turned towards him and said—</p>
               <p>"It is very painful to me to allude to these circumstances. Being a stranger, I
                  cannot explain them. I therefore prefer to remain silent. It was more to escape
                  from sad and bitter recollections, than to attend to the demands of business, that
                  I left my Southern home and became a wanderer here."</p>
               <p>He paused in great agitation. The soft, dark eye of Eulalia met his own, beaming
                  with sympathy and glistening with sensibility. There was no reproach, no suspicion
                  in its clear depths of light. Her delicacy was wounded by her father's abrupt
                  inquisitiveness. She wanted to apologize for him, to soothe the pain he had
                  inflicted,—but what could she say, or do? She felt, too, an inexplicable shock.
                  She had never dreamed that Moreland was a married man; true, he was divorced, but
                  that was so shocking. He had loved and wedded. The ties were broken; but could
                  hearts be wrenched asunder by the hand of violence, without for ever bleeding? She
                  wished she had not known it, or knowing so much, that more could be revealed.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry that I touched upon an unpleasant<pb n="98-99"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000050"/> theme," said Mr. Hastings. "I had no intention of
                  intruding on domestic misfortunes. We Yankees are accused of being inquisitive,
                  and perhaps we are a little so. It is natural, however, for us to feel some
                  interest in those who are brought in contact with us. You see us here in the bosom
                  of our families—just as we are—without disguise or mystery. In this respect you
                  have a decided advantage, who give us nothing but your name in return."</p>
               <p>"You are right, Mr. Hastings. A stranger should always bear credentials with him,
                  proving his claims to a hospitable reception. I have these in my trunk, which I
                  would be happy to show you, if it would not trespass on your attention. I brought
                  letters of introduction from some of the first men of the South, which have given
                  me a passport to the best society of New York and Boston. I would be glad if my
                  private history were fully known, knowing that your sympathies would be all
                  enlisted in my favour; but I cannot win them by a process so exquisitely
                  painful."</p>
               <p>"Let us say no more about it," said his host. "I intended this evening to avoid
                  every unpleasant subject, every national difference, and have a real social, free
                  and easy time. Supposing we have a little music. We can have some
                     <emph>songs</emph> to-night. Eula, give us one of your little simple Scotch
                  airs—one of the melodies of Burns. Burns is my favourite poet, sir. He wrote as if
                  there were burning coals upon his heart. He was a<emph>man</emph> as well as a
                     <emph>poet.</emph> Come, Eula, you are always ready. You have no instrument to
                  tune. I believe you are fond of music, Mr. Moreland?"</p>
               <p>"Passionately so—especially the music of the human voice."</p>
               <p>And Eulalia sang till the very air seemed to ripple as her melodious breath
                  mingled with its waves. She needed no accompaniment. Why should she? The
                  nightingale has none.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>DAY after day passed away, and still Moreland lingered in the village, unable to
                  break the spell that bound him to the spot. Week after week passed away, and still
                  he lingered, feeling the spell that bound him stronger and still more strong. He
                  no longer sought to liberate himself from the enchantment. He resolved that
                  Eulalia Hastings should be his wife, if he had the power to win her affections, in
                  spite of the terrible warfare her father was making against his principles and
                  practice. In spite of the awful declaration, he so well remembered, recorded in
                  one of her father's written documents, "that he would rather a daughter of his
                  should be laid in the deepest grave of New England than be wedded to a Southern
                  slaveholder," he resolved to triumph over all opposition, and transplant this
                  Northern flower to his own sunnier clime.</p>
               <p>"For many virtues had he admired several women," and <emph>one</emph> he had
                  loved, with all the vehemence of passion—loved "not wisely, but too well." He had
                  loved, in spite of the resistance of reason, the warnings of prudence, and trusted
                  against the admonitions of friendship and the pleadings of affection. Now reason
                  and prudence justified, instead of opposing his choice. Eulalia possessed every
                  qualification wanting in the brilliant, but misguided Claudia. There was about her
                  a pure, sweet, fresh womanliness, a virgin delicacy, a strong but guarded
                  sensibility, a deep, genuine, but unobtrusive piety. She was fair without vanity,
                  intelligent and highly cultivated without pedantry or display, admired, caressed,
                  and beloved, without pride or vainglory. Yet with all these charming and engaging <choice>
                     <sic>quailties</sic>
                     <corr>qualities</corr>
                  </choice>, he could see that her character was only half developed; that there was
                  a latent strength and enthusiasm, a sleeping power, which, like lightning, is born
                  only of the night-cloud and the storm. The good landlady, while boasting of her
                  many lovers, had remarked "that she took to none of them," and it was probable,
                  that the portals of her heart, that temple adorned with such pearls and precious
                  gems, had never yet opened and closed on the divinity destined to be enshrined and
                  worshipped there.</p>
               <p>And what were Eulalia's feelings? Her youth had been gliding over a smooth,
                  unrippling stream, calmly and quietly, yet monotonously. Now the current quickened
                  and swelled, and sunbeams and shadows chased each other over the surface. New life
                  was born within her. She lived in a new and more glorious world. All that her pure
                  heart had ever imagined of manly excellence<pb n="102-103"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000052"/> lence, or imagination dreamed of manly grace, she
                  found realized in Moreland. His homage humbled, while it exalted her; for she
                  deemed herself unworthy to receive it.</p>
               <p>She began to believe in the existence of a second love, stronger than the first.
                  He offered to tell her the history of his former ill-fated attachment, and the
                  causes which had destroyed it; but though her curiosity had been strongly excited,
                  she refused to hear what she knew would give him pain to reveal. With implicit
                  confidence in his honour and truth, she believed him blameless in the transaction,
                  and she shrunk with unconquerable repugnance from hearing from his lips the name
                  of Claudia. It was mentioned no more.</p>
               <p>It is not to be supposed that village gossip was mute, when there was such
                  abundant fuel to feed its loquacity, or that parental solicitude was slumbering,
                  when there was so much to excite and alarm it. Mr. Hastings found himself in a
                  most awkward and distressing situation. He was an exceedingly ambitious
                  man—ambitious for himself and his children. Had wealth been at his command, he
                  would have loved to make a display of magnificence and pomp, that would have
                  dazzled the eyes of the more lowly and obscure. He wanted his daughter to marry a
                  distinguished man, who would give consequence to the family, and increase his own
                  influence. Here was a gentleman of wealth beyond his most sanguine expectations,
                  of most refined and captivating vating manners, intelligent, accomplished, and
                  bearing the highest credentials of his birth and standing—a man of whose alliance
                  he would be proud; but he belonged to a class which, for years, he had been
                  denouncing as unworthy of the fellowship of Christians; he dwelt in a portion of
                  the land doomed by him as the Sodom and Gomorrah of modern times, over which the
                  God of retribution was brooding in the awful might of coming vengeance. His
                  principles, his consistency, his reputation were at stake. He had always believed
                  the Southerners a selfish, aristocratic, lazy, self-indulging, cruel set of
                  people; he had whetted and sharpened his prejudices on the rough grindstone of
                  popular ignorance, till they had acquired the edge and keenness of the razor. The
                  unexpected appearance of a Southern gentleman in his own immediate circle, the
                  first with whom he had ever become familiarly acquainted, was an exciting incident
                  in the village monotony of his life. He could not help admiring him as an
                  individual, he could not help acknowledging the truth and candour of many of his
                  arguments; but the champion of truth must never admit the possibility of his
                  having been in error, and the character for consistency must be preserved at any
                  sacrifice.</p>
               <p>"What, marry my daughter!" he exclaimed, when the crisis arrived for which he had
                  been preparing all the ammunition of his intellect. "Sir, I am sorry, very sorry,
                  but it can never be. There is a great gulf between<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000053"/> us,—one that I fear will never be filled. Were I to
                  consent to this union, I should destroy, by a single act, the labour and devotion
                  of years. Were you a poor New England farmer, I would willingly receive you as my
                  son; but holding the position and advocating the principles you now do, you can
                  never be to me more than you have hitherto been,—the guest of my household, the
                  companion of the passing hour."</p>
               <p>"Is the future happiness of your daughter a question of no interest in your mind?"
                  asked Moreland, who had nerved himself to encounter the most vigorous opposition;
                  but who believed that patience and perseverance and will could finally overcome
                  it.</p>
               <p>"Does she know of your application?" asked the father, anxiously.</p>
               <p>"She does. It is with her sanction that I come; and I am authorized to say, that
                  her happiness as well as my own is involved in your decision."</p>
               <p>"You should not have done this. You knew what my sentiments were. You had read
                  from my own pen a sentence I know you must have remembered, 'that I would rather
                  see a daughter of mine laid in the deepest grave of New England than wedded to a
                  Southern planter.' You had received my answer before making the proposition. You
                  have trifled with my daughter's affections, and endangered her peace. You should
                  not have done this—you should have made your first appeal to me, sir."</p>
               <p>"I have done nothing clandestine, sir," replied Moreland, proudly; "from my very
                  first visit, you must have perceived my admiration of your daughter. I have never
                  attempted to conceal my feelings,—they have been as open as the day. I had read
                  the awful declaration to which you refer; but I did not, could not believe it the
                  real language of your heart. I looked upon it as a figure of rhetoric, and nothing
                  more. Sir, your daughter's heart is mine,—I have won it by no subtle arts, no
                  secret means. It is the reward of my pure affection,—my strong and ardent love.
                  Give her to me, and I will receive her as the dearest, holiest trust ever given to
                  man. Give her to me, and I will bear her to a clime more congenial to the delicacy
                  of her constitution than this, where eastern blasts wither so early the fairest
                  flowers of life; I will guard her with a tenderness and devotion equalled only by
                  her loveliness and worth."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Moreland," cried Mr. Hastings, putting his hands behind him and walking up
                  and down the room with short, quick steps, "you agitate me very much. Eulalia is a
                  dear child to me—a blessed child. From her cradle to the present hour she has
                  never, to my knowledge, deserved reproof or blame. I love all my children, but
                  Eulalia is the darling of my heart. God forgive me if I have sacrificed her
                  happiness to my imprudence!"</p>
               <p>"You have not sacrificed her happiness, you have secured it, sir. She will be the
                  centre of a happy home.<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6694-00000054"/> She will be
                  surrounded by affluence and comfort, the mistress of faithful, affectionate
                  beings, by whom she will be beloved and adored. She will bring light and joy to
                  scenes darkened by domestic disappointment, and exercise a mother's holy influence
                  over the child, doomed to the saddest of all orphanages."</p>
               <p>"Ah! I am glad you mentioned this. Were there no other objection, I could not
                  consent to her marriage with one who has been divorced. She might be exposed to
                  much sorrow and misconstruction. Besides, it proves that your affections are
                  easily excited, and probably easily subdued. You will soon forget my
                  daughter."</p>
               <p>"I cannot wonder at your want of faith in my stability and constancy, but I have
                  been more unfortunate than blameworthy. I was very young when I married, and if I
                  erred in my choice I may be forgiven on the plea of youth and inexperience.
                  Passion may die away, but love, such love as I bear Eulalia, can never change. She
                  was created for me in the great counsels of eternity. The moment I saw her my soul
                  claimed her as its own. I was led here for no other purpose but to find her, my
                  heart's immortal counterpart. I have remained for no other purpose but to win her,
                  and I will stay till love, stronger than the trumpet blast of Israel's priests,
                  shall break down the Jericho of prejudice and fanaticism."</p>
               <p>Moreland was losing his usual self-possession. A hot flush crimsoned his cheek;
                  his voice became husky and tremulous. He was beginning to feel as proud as Lucifer
                  cifer. Mr. Hastings seemed a very insignificant object to be placed in opposition
                  to the mightiness of his will. Mr. Hastings felt the influence of this regal
                  passion of the moment, and a dark reddish spark kindled in his eye.</p>
               <p>"Do you threaten me?" he exclaimed, looking steadily in the face of Moreland. "I
                  tell you, young man, that lofty tone will have far less effect than the one you
                  used awhile ago. I am a sturdy, independent Yankee, and high words have no more
                  power on me than the summer wind on the century-rooted oak. When I believe I am in
                  the right I am as firm as my own granite hills, and you might as well attempt to
                  move them as me."</p>
               <p>Moreland, who had never withdrawn his eye one moment from the dark red spark
                  burning so intensely on him, felt the power of an inexorable will grasping and
                  clenching him, till a cold numb feeling came over him. The hot colour died away on
                  his cheek, leaving him as pale as marble. He could not, would not, even for
                  Eulalia's sake, humble himself before this obstinate, immovable man, only to be
                  trampled on and crushed. He moved towards the table and took up his hat. There was
                  a wild rose in it, which he had plucked by the wayside, intending to give it to
                  Eulalia. It was wilted, but surpassingly sweet in odour. The sight of that
                  withered flower softened his feelings, and turned them in a new channel. It seemed
                  an emblem of Eulalia, doomed to a<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6694-00000055"/>
                  heart-blight, beneath which her youth and beauty would languish and fade. He
                  thought less of his own sorrow than hers, of whose love he had every assurance
                  ingenuous modesty could impart.</p>
               <p>"Am I to understand that your decision is unalterable?" he asked, in a tone far
                  less regal than that which had so exasperated Mr. Hastings. "Is it your inexorable
                  resolution that I shall not wed your daughter?"</p>
               <p>"It is."</p>
               <p>Moreland laid his hand on the latch and was passing out, when Mr. Hastings added,
                  with an entire change of manner—"I am sorry to part with one unpleasant feeling on
                  either side. I do not wish to give you pain. You have paid my daughter a great
                  compliment, which we shall all appreciate. You must perceive that I am actuated by
                  principle alone. I am a poor man, and you are rich. Were my judgment to be
                  influenced by personal accomplishments, yours would be irresistible. I have but
                  one objection, but that is insurmountable. Were you an humble missionary to some
                  heathen land, I would give her to you in the name of the living God; I would give
                  her as the firstling of my flock; I would devote her as a lamb without spot or
                  blemish, to a good and glorious cause."</p>
               <p>"I look upon myself as a missionary," replied Moreland, with a kindling
                  countenance. "I look upon every master and mistress in our Southern land, as
                  missionaries appointed to civilize and christianize the sons and daughters of
                  Africa. To them Ethiopia is stretching out its sable hands, and through them they
                  are lifted to God. If all the efforts of all the missionaries in our country were
                  concentrated in the dark regions of Africa, they could not, judging of the success
                  of their labours elsewhere, make one-tenth part of the number of converts that are
                  found in our households and plantations. In our towns and villages, the churches
                  of the negroes rise side by side with our own. Their prayers of faith, their hymns
                  of praise, ascend on the same breeze, and are borne upward to the same heaven.
                  Once more, then, I entreat you, give me your daughter, and look upon her evermore
                  as the wife of a Christian missionary."</p>
               <p>"I cannot consent to evil that good may come," was the emphatic reply. "But one
                  condition I will make. Liberate your slaves; remove the curse from your household
                  and your land; come to me with a pure, unburdened conscience, and I will oppose no
                  barrier to your love."</p>
               <p>"I have offered many of them their freedom, on condition that they go to Liberia,
                  but they will not listen to the proposition. And I cannot, even to secure Paradise
                  itself, cast upon the Northern world the large family dependent upon me for
                  comfort and support. Under such circumstances, the freedom for which you plead
                  would be their direst curse, instead of their greatest blessing. I believe, in
                  God's good time, the day of<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6694-00000056"/> liberation
                  will come, if man will wait his leading. No, sir, I cannot accede to your
                  proposition; nor is it from mercenary motives that I refuse. Heaven knows I am
                  above such considerations. If I can purchase happiness only at the sacrifice of
                  duty, then I must be for ever wretched."</p>
               <p>"May you live to have very different ideas of duty from what now govern you! You
                  have decided the question yourself, and I am glad of it. You can no longer
                  reproach me for destroying the happiness of Eulalia."</p>
               <p>"You might have spared me that," exclaimed Moreland, with irrepressible
                  bitterness. Then, fearing to trust himself to say more in his present maddened
                  state of feeling, he made a silent bow and left the house.</p>
               <p>As he passed through the yard he met Dora, with her hands laden with flowers. She
                  sprang to meet him, with a bright and joyous smile; but on seeing his pale, stern,
                  and agitated countenance, she seemed bewildered and frightened, and the flowers
                  dropped from her hands.</p>
               <p>"What's the matter?" she cried. "What makes you look so sorry and angry? Don't you
                  love me any more?"</p>
               <p>Without saying a word, he took the child in his arms and pressed her to his bosom,
                  with a wild passion, of which he was not aware. He identified her for the moment
                  with Eulalia, and felt as if he could no longer restrain the overflowings of his
                  love and despair.</p>
               <p>"Please don't!" said the little girl, entreatingly—<choice>
                     <sic>skrinking</sic>
                     <corr>shrinking</corr>
                  </choice> from the arms which had always before so gently encircled her—gazing
                  earnestly and fearfully in his face.</p>
               <p>"Dora, I am going home," he exclaimed. "I am going, never to return."</p>
               <p>"Going? when?" cried the child.</p>
               <p>"To-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Let me go and tell Eula," said Dora, running two or three steps from him in her
                  eagerness to tell the tidings,—then returning and taking hold of his hand, she
                  burst into tears.</p>
               <p>"What makes you go when we all love you so? Why can't you live here all the
                  time?"</p>
               <p>"It is because I love you that I must leave you. Tell Eula—but it is no matter—I
                  must see her once more before I go."</p>
               <p>Bending down and kissing the fair forehead now clouded with grief, he passed from
                  under the shade of the sycamore boughs, through the white gate and into the open
                  street. He thought he caught a glimpse of a pale face, at an upper window,—a
                  white, faint gleam, like a vanishing star,—but he dared not look back again. He
                  dared not think of the anguish he was leaving behind,—he could hardly bear the
                  weight and intensity of that which he was bearing away.</p>
               <p>"Albert," said he, as soon as he found himself in<pb n="112-113"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000057"/> his own room, "get everything ready; we shall go
                  to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Bless you for the news, Mars. Russell!" exclaimed the overjoyed mulatto; "I'm
                  mighty glad to hear it. Won't I see old Georgie again? Wont I say howdy to all the
                  blessed old darkies? But,"—pausing abruptly, while a sudden seriousness settled on
                  his bright face,—"what the matter, master? Anything happened to worry you? Any bad
                  news from home?"</p>
               <p>"No! I only wish to be perfectly quiet. Don't talk to me."</p>
               <p>Throwing himself into a chair by the window, he leaned his throbbing temples on
                  his hand, and fixed his gloomy gaze on the God-devoted temple,—the birth-place of
                  his love and his sorrow. There he sat, without change of position, till supper was
                  announced.</p>
               <p>"I want no supper," said he, without moving.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Mars. Russell, you'll be sick, at this rate," said Albert, watching with
                  increasing anxiety his pale and altered countenance; "indeed, you are sick now,"
                  he added, laying his hand humbly but affectionately on his master's burning
                  forehead; "you've got fever, sure enough, this minute. 'Spose I go and get a
                  doctor, master?"</p>
               <p>This act might seem too familiar, to those unaccustomed to the caressing freedom
                  of manner often permitted to a favourite slave. One of Albert's chief delights was
                  to brush his master's hair, and bathe his temples, when suffering from a sick and
                  aching head.</p>
               <p>"Don't be foolish, boy," he cried; "I tell you again, there's nothing the matter
                  with me."</p>
               <p>"But, Mars. Russell, you don't know how hot your head is." The smooth,
                  bronze-coloured fingers gently threaded the dark hair that fell heavily on his
                  master's brow.</p>
               <p>"You shall see how easily I can cool it," said Moreland; and, wishing to relieve
                  the anxiety of his humble friend, he rose and approached the wash-stand, intending
                  to plunge his aching temples in the brimming basin; but he reeled, and would have
                  fallen, had not Albert's arms supported him.</p>
               <p>"I do feel strangely here," said he, putting his hand to his head. "I had better
                  lie down awhile."</p>
               <p>Albert smoothed the pillow under his head, as gently as a woman could have done;
                  then bringing the basin to the bed-side, he bathed his forehead and moistened his
                  hair, till the throbbing veins seemed less wiry to the touch. He stood, dark and
                  gentle as the twilight, now stealing soft and stilly round the room, and hanging a
                  dusky curtain over the bed.</p>
               <p>That night, when the family of Mr. Hastings gathered round the supper table, the
                  place of Eulalia was vacant—she had a sick headache—she was lying down—she did not
                  want any supper. Mrs. Hastings looked very sad; Mr. Hastings had a grave,
                  contracted brow,<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6694-00000058"/> and even Dora's sunny
                  brow of childhood wore the gloom of solemn thought. The first word uttered was by
                  her, after looking at her father.</p>
               <p>"Papa, is it right to say grace if one isn't thankful?"</p>
               <p>"What makes you ask such a strange question, child?"</p>
               <p>"I thought you didn't look thankful to-night, papa, that's all."</p>
               <p>Reuben laughed, but Mrs. Hastings drew a deep sigh. She felt that the blessing was
                  wanting at the board, from which the sweet face of Eulalia was banished by reason
                  of sorrow. She knew the sorrow must be deep and full, which she had not the power
                  to confine within her own unselfish bosom. The submissive and unquestioning wife
                  was merged in the anxious, sympathizing mother, and her heart instinctively
                  rebelled against her husband's cold and harsh decree. She admired and esteemed the
                  gentle and gallant stranger, whom she would probably never more behold, and loved
                  him, because he loved her Eulalia. He had come among them like a beam of light,
                  and what darkness and chillness he would leave behind!</p>
               <p>"How sorry I am Mr. Moreland is going away!" exclaimed Dora, again breaking the
                  heavy silence. "Papa, what makes him go? And what made him look so strange and
                  sorry when he went away?"</p>
               <p>"He wanted to take your sister Eula away with him, and I would not let him,"
                  replied the father, laying down his knife and fork.</p>
               <p>"But he would bring her back again, papa!"</p>
               <p>"He wanted her to live there all the time. You would not be likely ever to see her
                  again. We should no more hear her sweet voice in the temple of God or at the altar
                  of home. She would be to us just as if she were dead; for the places that now know
                  her would no more be gladdened by her presence."</p>
               <p>He looked at his wife while he was speaking, and the words sunk deep in her soul.
                  He had touched the right chord. She shuddered at the desolation of the prospect he
                  presented, and wondered she had not realized its dreariness and darkness.</p>
               <p>"I am sure he is rich enough to bring her home to visit us, every year or two,"
                  cried Reuben, whose heart Moreland had completely captivated, "and I think him
                  good enough to do it, if you ask him."</p>
               <p>"Evil was the day the Southern stranger came among us," exclaimed Mr. Hastings
                  sternly, "if he has made all my children aliens from their father's
                  principles."</p>
               <p>"You have always encouraged us, sir, to express independent opinions," said Reuben
                  manfully. "I must acknowledge that I have a very different opinion of the South
                  and Southern people, since Mr. Moreland came here. When I am a man I intend to
                  travel among them, and judge for myself."</p>
               <p>"Really, young man, you are mapping out a glorious<pb n="116-117"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000059"/> future," exclaimed his father, sarcastically.
                  "Perhaps you are looking forward to the time when you can purchase a plantation,
                  fill it with live human stock, and flourish your whip with as much grace as any
                  other lordly slave-master. Perhaps you have been thinking the sacrifice of your
                  sister a trifling thing in comparison with your own advancement."</p>
               <p>"Father, you know I am above such meanness," cried the youth, his keen black eye
                  actually corruscating as he spoke; "besides, I do not think my sister would be
                  sacrificed by marrying such a man as Mr. Moreland. If she ever sees another like
                  him in this part of the world, it is more than I imagine."</p>
               <p>Reuben, too much excited to command his temper, got up suddenly and left the
                  table, followed by the gentle reproach of his mother's eyes. Mr. Hastings seemed
                  thunderstruck at this first outbreak of independence in his son, whom he still
                  looked upon as a mere child, bound to think exactly as he thought, and to do
                  exactly as he did. It was altogether an uncomfortable meal, and when Betsy came to
                  clear away the dishes she found them nearly as full as when she put them on the
                  table. Shrewd and intelligent as she was, she had not been unobservant of the
                  signs of the times, and was not without her suspicions of the cause of Eulalia's
                  sudden indisposition. She had reasons of her own for wishing to see her; so, upon
                  the pretext of bearing her a hot cup of tea, she entered her chamber.</p>
               <p>The lamp was placed upon the hearth, burning against a back-ground of odorous,
                  fresh pine boughs, that filled with dark green shade the place occupied in winter
                  with glowing flame. The bed on which Eulalia lay was in a kind of twilight, and
                  her pallid face was hardly distinguishable from the pillow, save by the dark
                  framework of her dishevelled hair.</p>
               <p>"Here, Miss Eula, is a cup of tea," said Betsy, softening her voice to its lowest
                  key, and approaching the bed; "it will do your head good. I couldn't get along no
                  how in the world, if it wer'n't for my tea o'nights. It helps one mightily."</p>
               <p>"No, I thank you, Betsy," answered Eulalia, covering her eyes with her hand, to
                  hide the moist and swollen lids. "I shall be well in the morning. Don't trouble
                  yourself about me."</p>
               <p>"It's mighty strange," said Betsy, seating herself and absently sipping the
                  fragrant beverage rejected by Eulalia, "it's strange how it happened, but Mr.
                  Moreland's sick, too. While the folks were at supper, I run over to Miss Grimby's
                  to borrow a handful of hops, and they all seemed in a powerful fright. Albert was
                  running after a doctor, saying his master was in an awful way, taken all of a
                  sudden, or so."</p>
               <p>Eulalia started from her pillow and leaned eagerly forward, as if to catch the
                  lowest sound of Betsy's nasal tones.</p>
               <p>"Oh! Betsy, are you sure this is all true?" she<pb n="118-119"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000060"/> exclaimed, pushing back her hair with both hands,
                  and gazing wistfully in her face.</p>
               <p>"To be sure it is true, or I wouldn't be the one to say it," replied Betsy,
                  emphatically.</p>
               <p>Now Betsy had a habit of exaggeration, in which she unconsciously indulged, and
                  she used the epithets <hi rend="i"/>powerful and <hi rend="i"/>awful without
                  meaning all that the lexicographer attributes to them. "I declare," continued she,
                     "<emph>that</emph> Albert is the lovingest creatur I ever beheld. The way he
                  loves his master, I couldn't begin to tell,—and I don't wonder at it, for a nicer
                  gentleman never came into these parts. He's given away ever so much money to the
                  poor, besides what he's done to Nancy. It's well Albert's there to take care of
                  him. Mrs. Grimby's got a new gal to help her, the awkwardest thing I ever set eyes
                  on; and she's been working so hard lately, she looks herself as if she'd been
                  dragged through a knot-hole."</p>
               <p>While Betsy's tongue ran on, with a kind of railroad speed, Eulalia had risen and
                  thrown one arm around the bed-post, against which she stood leaning. Her heart had
                  been faint and sick before, under the cold burden of disappointed hope; now it
                  ached and throbbed with sudden anxiety and dread. Moreland sick, and perhaps
                  dying, at an inn! Had he come, had he lingered only for this!</p>
               <p>"Does father know of it?" she asked. "No! I know he does not. Tell him, Betsy, and
                  he will go and see him."</p>
               <p>"I expect there's not much use in the Squire's going," muttered Betsy, "unless
                  he'll give him the right medicine. I've seen all that's been going on; and, tho'
                  I've no right to say it, I'm desperate sorry, at the way things have turned. He'd
                  make you a grand, good husband, and you'd live like the lady you was born to be.
                  As for the stories they tell about whipping and slashing the niggers, I don't
                  believe a word on't. Albert says they are all lies,—that he'd a heap rather live
                  there than here, and be as free as the rest of us. Free!—I wonder what they call
                  free?" continued Betsy, feeling of the knots and callouses of her toil-worn hands.
                  "I know I ain't free, or I wouldn't work, like a pack-horse, from one year's eend
                  to another. I'm obliged to work to live, and to make others live, and God knows
                  I'm willing; but I should like to know what rest and pleasure I have? I haven't
                  sot down before since I got up this blessed morning. Albert says the niggers sing
                  and dance as much as they please, when their work is done up. I wonder how I would
                  look singing and dancing! Now, don't be angry, Miss Euly, but the Squire's
                  standing in his own light this time. There ain't a lady in the land but what would
                  envy you, not one. You'll never get such another chance, as sure as you're
                  born."</p>
               <p>"Betsy" said Eulalia, sinking down on the bedside,<pb n="120-121"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000061"/> still embracing the post with the clinging hands,
                  "I know you mean to be kind, but you must not talk in that way. Please go and tell
                  father how very sick he is."</p>
               <p>"I'll tell him," she answered reluctantly, and slowly rising, with the now empty
                  cup in her hand, and taking a step or two towards the door. "I'll tell him, though
                  it's no use. You are as sick as he is, I dare say. You look as white as a ghost,
                  and as limber as a wet rag. I'll tell you what I will do, Miss Euly, if it will be
                  any comfort to you. I'll run over to the tavern again, after I've done up all my
                  chores, and see how the gentleman really is, and if he needs watchers I'll set up
                  with him myself, for I know nobody can beat me nussing, when I try—my poor lame
                  brother knows that's true."</p>
               <p>"You are too tired, Betsy. You have been working too hard; but you are a kind
                  nurse—I know it well myself."</p>
               <p>"Albert can spell me," cried Betsy, nodding her head, "and if I do set up at
                  night, it don't make me lazy next day. Folks can do with a heap less sleep than
                  they think they can, if they only try it."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hastings entered, and Betsy withdrew, having rested herself from the toils of
                  the day by pouring into Eulalia's ear her affectionate sympathy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hastings was really troubled when he heard of the illness of Moreland, and
                  immediately walked over to the inn to ascertain the truth of the statement. He
                  found the physician there, who talked professionally of inflammatory symptoms, of
                  a tendency of blood to the brain, and the necessity of perfect quietude. He
                  pronounced it a most sudden and violent attack, one that would require great skill
                  to conquer, and experience to understand. Mr. Hastings was not so much alarmed as
                  he would' have been, had he not known that almost all the Doctor's patients had
                  very violent and dangerous attacks, and that he pronounced their cure as little
                  short of a miracle. Still he felt very uncomfortable, and walked homewards with
                  slow and heavy steps. The image of Eulalia, when he had told her of the decree
                  which had gone forth; the deadly pallor of her complexion; the unutterable anguish
                  of her glance, turned from him to heaven, as if appealing to its mercy; the sudden
                  pressure of her hand upon her heart, as if an arrow were quivering there—came to
                  him in the darkness like accusing phantoms, and would not vanish away. The
                  countenance of Moreland, too, when he asked him "if that was his unalterable
                  decision," so pale, agitated, and stern, would rise before him, drawn only too
                  vividly on the shadows of night. He could not help asking himself, if he were
                  doing right to separate those whom God seemed to have united by a love so passing
                  strong, so transcending all he had ever witnessed in the romance of life. He
                  questioned his own principles, his own motives, and wondered if it were really his
                  duty to<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6694-00000062"/> sacrifice his daughter's
                  happiness to his own reputation. He seemed much less in his own estimation,
                  walking alone, under the great dark dome of night, whose starry hieroglyphics
                  proclaimed an antiquity deep as eternity; he felt much less, we repeat, with these
                  solemn influences around him, than when acting as the demagogue of a party, and
                  feeding on the husks of popular applause.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>THE Parsonage! what a sweet, lovely spot it was! Parsonages almost always are
                  lovely. They are selected with a view to the sacred character of the inmate, far
                  from the noise and bustle of the working-day world, with a smooth, green lawn
                  stretching out in front, a profusion of shade trees sheltering that green lawn
                  from the bronzing sunbeams, and a pure white paling running all round it. Such was
                  the dwelling-place of Parson Ellery, as he was called by the country people, and
                  if goodness and piety could consecrate a spot, it was indeed holy ground. But
                  though the good country people called him parson, he owned a loftier title, which
                  the villagers preferred—Doctor Ellery, he having been honoured with a D. D., by
                  the faculty of a neighbouring university. Though now a somewhat aged man, he had
                  never married, a circumstance which continued to excite wonder in those who knew
                  him best. He had come among them, a stranger, in the meridian of his days, and no
                  one knew the history of his youthful life. He was what may emphatically be styled
                  a man of God,<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6694-00000063"/> devoting himself to His
                  service with apostolic simplicity and evangelical devotion, dividing his time
                  between the seclusion of the study, the homes of the poor, and the chambers of the
                  sick and the dying. He was also a man of peace, and grieved when any jarring
                  elements were set in motion in the heart of the community. He did all he could to
                  counteract the blind fanaticism which Mr. Hastings had kindled and continued to
                  fan with his fiery breathings; and in so doing, he had excited in the latter
                  feelings of personal animosity, the more bitter, because policy induced him to
                  conceal them. He did not wish to appear at variance with a man so popular and
                  universally beloved; therefore he smiled blandly upon him, was a constant
                  attendant on public worship, and a respectful observer of all the ordinances of
                  religion. Still, the minister knew that Mr. Hastings disliked and distrusted him,
                  feared his influence, and did all he could, in secret, to weaken and undermine
                  it.</p>
               <p>Though unmarried, as a most excellent and respectable housekeeper presided over
                  his establishment, he was visited by all the matrons and maidens of the parish.
                  Among these none was so welcome or beloved as Eulalia Hastings. She had grown up
                  under his eye, from a lovely young child into a still lovelier young woman, and,
                  forgetting the lapse of time, she was still to him the innocent and confiding
                  child, who always seemed to him, sweet as the rose of Sharon and fair as the lily
                  of the valley. She it was, who brought him the first flowers of spring, the first
                  strawberries of summer, and the first fruits of autumn. He had accustomed all the
                  children to call him father, and Eulalia still addressed him by that endearing
                  name.</p>
               <p>He was now seated in his study, in a large arm-chair, with a slab, covered with
                  green baize in front, which served as a table, and on which paper, pen, and ink
                  were laid. But though the paraphernalia of writing was before him, the pen lay
                  idly by the pure blank paper, and his hand supported on its palm, his drooping
                  head. He seemed lost in sad and profound meditation, when a low, sweet voice,
                  breathing his name at the open door, roused him from his deep revery.</p>
               <p>"Eulalia, my child, come in."</p>
               <p>"Do I intrude, father?" It was thus that, from childhood, she had addressed him,
                  and never did her spirit cling with more yearning fondness and sacred trust to all
                  that name implies, than at the present moment.</p>
               <p>He answered by rising, taking her kindly by both hands, leading her to a seat near
                  the window, and taking another near her. She looked so pale and sad, so fair, so
                  delicate, he felt as if he must place her as he would a wilting flower, where the
                  summer breeze could fan her. She sat awhile in silence, but the quivering of her
                  lip and the tears glittering on her long, dark, drooping lashes showed, more
                  eloquently than words, the sorrow that sighed for consolation. The good man knew
                     all<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6694-00000064"/> her history. It was that on
                  which he was pondering when she entered. He had been bearing her in the arms of
                  faith and prayer, to the mercy seat of heaven; and when he told her of this, in
                  gentle, soothing words, she bowed her head, and the tears rained down her
                  cheeks.</p>
               <p>"Oh! dear father," she cried, "my soul is oppressed with the burden of its sorrow.
                  I came to you for comfort and support. The clouds are very dark around me. You
                  have told me that religion would sustain me in life's saddest trials; but, oh, in
                  vain I pray. I sink lower and lower. Hope, joy, and faith, all—all are leaving
                  me."</p>
               <p>"Ah! my child, you have basked in sunshine till this hour, while thousands have
                  sat cold and weeping behind the hidings of God's countenance. I fear your religion
                  is indeed built upon the sand, if the first wave of suffering that beats against
                  it shakes it from its foundation. The children of God must all pass through some
                  ordeal to prove their divine affiliation. Some pass through the fire, some the
                  flood, and some are cast into the lion's den of oppression; yet, strengthened by
                  angels, they faint not, but triumph, and look back upon every trial as a
                  stepping-stone to glory and happiness."</p>
               <p>"I think I could bear any suffering that affected me alone," said Eulalia, raising
                  her tear-dimmed eyes; "but to be the cause of misery, sickness, and perhaps death
                  to others,—there is something so crushing, so terrible in the thought."</p>
               <p>"Sickness and death are the ministers of God," replied the pastor, "and they
                  always stand ready to do his bidding. The illness of this unfortunate stranger may
                  have been excited by contending passions, but not produced. Change of climate, and
                  a thousand causes unknown to us, may have brought about this result. I learn from
                  his servant, that he has had a similar attack, and that then, as now, his case was
                  considered hopeless. <emph>You</emph> have no cause of self-reproach, my child;
                  and, whatever be the issue, you have nothing left but submission."</p>
               <p>"You have seen him to-day, father. Do you indeed give up all hope?"</p>
               <p>"No! while an omnipotent God watches over him. To-night, I am told, will be the
                  crisis of his malady. We must pray,—we must wrestle in prayer for his recovery,
                  but always with one reservation, my dear Eulalia, "Not my will, but thine, O, God!
                  be done."</p>
               <p>"One thing, let me ask, father,—did he speak?—did he know you?"</p>
               <p>"No! my child,—he lies still, pale and unconscious as the unbreathing marble. His
                  faithful slave stands weeping and sobbing by his bedside, an image of the truest
                  and fondest affection I ever witnessed. Friends are waiting round him, ready to
                  administer to his sufferings, when awakened to their consciousness. Be
                     comforted<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6694-00000065"/> forted, my daughter,—all
                  that man can do has been done; but it is in moments like these, man feels his
                  impotence, and can only prostrate himself in sackcloth and ashes, at the feet of
                  infinite wisdom and mercy."</p>
               <p>"In your presence, I do feel the possibility of submission; but I dare not tell
                  you all my rebellion and despair, when there is no one near to soothe and sustain.
                  How kind, how sympathizing you are!—you, who never knew the tumult of earthly
                  passions. What gentleness and tenderness you manifest for weaknesses you never
                  felt!"</p>
               <p>The minister raised his mild gray eyes to heaven, then turned them on Eulalia with
                  an unutterable expression. There was a sudden glow, a lighting up in them, that
                  sent a flash over his brow and warmed with transient colour his pallid cheeks.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps the history of passions subdued, of weaknesses overcome, and sorrows
                  endured and sanctified through grace, may teach you how to subdue and endure your
                  own," said he in a low, agitated voice. Eulalia looked at him with a countenance
                  of the most earnest interest. It glowed with the reflection of his own
                  emotions.</p>
               <p>"Calm and passionless as you see me now," he added, "nature moulded me out of very
                  strong and warring elements. My father was in affluent circumstances, and I, being
                  an only son, was indulged to an extent that I have never seen equalled. Had it not
                  been for the counterpoising influence of a pious, restraining mother, my
                  extravagance would have been as boundless as my means were unrestricted. When I
                  became of age my mother died, and it seemed to me that the star of home set for
                  ever behind her death-cloud. I became restless and ambitious. I longed for new
                  scenes of action. I wanted to travel, to see more of the world and mankind. While
                  in college I had become acquainted with several young men from the South, one of
                  whom was the intimate friend of my youth."</p>
               <p>Here Eulalia bent forward in an attitude of deeper attention.</p>
               <p>"This young man," continued the minister, "whose name was Livingston, was a
                  Virginian, and he had so often described his home to me, in bright and glowing
                  colours, that I resolved to visit it, and become familiar by personal observation
                  with those manners and habits, which, I am sorry to say, are so often
                  misrepresented and painted in the darkest and most forbidding colours. My father
                  gave his consent, and I accompanied my friend over the mountains of Virginia to
                  his home, in one of the loveliest valleys of the world. I shall never forget the
                  greeting we received. Had I been a son or brother I could not have been more
                  warmly, cordially welcomed—not only by the white family, from whom I expected
                  hospitality and kindness, but by the household negroes and the plantation slaves,
                  who constituted one large community in themselves. I had heard many a<pb
                     n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6694-00000066"/> tale of the woes and sufferings of this
                  enslaved race; but I looked in vain for scars and stripes and chains. I saw
                  comfortable cabins erected for their accommodation, comfortable raiment and food
                  provided for them. They went forth to their labour with cheerful faces, and
                  returned at night to pastime or rest, often with the song upon their lips. I was
                  not prepared for such a state of things, nor for the kindness and familiarity with
                  which, young Livingston treated these dependants, who on their part seemed to
                  adore their young master. With the recollection of these scenes still vivid in my
                  memory, it is not strange that I have mourned deeply over your father's
                  prejudices, and the zeal he manifests in a cause he is only injuring by his
                  vehemence. It is not strange that I should have regretted the recent decision he
                  has made, and sought with all my influence to induce him to change it."</p>
               <p>"And have you done so?" exclaimed Eulalia. "Oh! I did not know. I feared you might
                  blame my want of filial submission. Oh! bless you, sir, for this last, this
                  greatest kindness."</p>
               <p>"Far be it from me to lessen your filial reverence," continued Doctor Ellery.
                  "Your father has many virtues, and, I doubt not, thinks he is doing God service by
                  the course he is pursuing. I wish I could turn his zeal and talents into a
                  different channel; but I am placed as a watch-light on the hill of Zion, and must
                  keep myself, as much as possible, aloof from the storms and strifes of contending
                  parties. Eulalia, that was a happy home to which young Livingston bore me. The
                  father was a warm-hearted, hospitable, genial gentleman, fond of hunting and
                  fishing, a noble equestrian, a Nimrod in the chase; a kind, just master, an
                  indulgent father, a tender, affectionate husband. The mother, a dignified,
                  intelligent lady, who looked well to the ways of her household, directing and
                  superintending everything with the eye of a mistress, yet never sacrificing one
                  lady-like grace or accomplishment. And the daughter, Emma Livingston,—"here his
                  voice faltered, and he paused. A faint red began to tinge the cheek of Eulalia. A
                  strong sympathy drew her still nearer her evangelical friend.</p>
               <p>"Emma Livingston," he resumed, "I will not attempt to describe. She had the bloom,
                  the beauty, the gayety, and innocence of youth; but a bloom so soft, a beauty so
                  winning, a gayety so tempered by modesty, and an innocence so exalted by wisdom,
                  that her character presented a rare and lovely combination. Eulalia, you have
                  heard a great deal of the selfishness and hard-heartedness of Southern females;
                  and so had I. Here was a young girl, an only daughter, brought up in the midst of
                  attendants, to whom her slightest word was law. You, my dear child are not more
                  gentle and self-sacrificing than she was. You do not speak more gently to your
                  little sister than did she to her household slaves. I have seen her lavish the
                  tenderest caresses on their<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6694-00000067"/> little
                  infants. I have seen her hang in anxious watchfulness over their sick-beds. I have
                  seen her weep over their humble graves. She taught them to read. She read the
                  Bible to them herself, and never seemed happier than when administering to their
                  necessities. Surely it was not wrong to assimilate her to an angel of light, as
                  she glided among these sable beings, twining with the roses of affection, their
                  links of bondage. I could dwell for hours on those days of love and happiness, for
                  I feel as if I had lifted a heavy stone from the fountain of memory, and that I
                  cannot stay the gushing waters. For years I have not uttered her name; and
                  now,—when moved, by a strong and holy impulse for your soul's good, to break the
                  silence that has so long closed over my sorrows,—it seems as if I must breathe it
                  alone, and breathe it for ever. I was then young and impassioned, and all that
                  youth and passion ever breathed of love, I felt for Emma. I was the beloved friend
                  of her brother, the favoured guest of her father,—every circumstance was
                  propitious to my wishes. Her own heart was mine. The esteem and affection of her
                  kindred were mine. I wrote to my father, who gave his cordial consent to a union
                  which the gifts of fortune as well as nature so liberally blessed. We were to
                  divide our time between the North and the South. In the summer I was to bear my
                  bride to my native North. In the winter we were to return to her beloved Virginia.
                  What was wanting, my child, to complete my felicity? Nothing thing but the consent
                  of Almighty God? I did not ask for that. I dreamed not of its being withheld. Why
                  should I dream? The rose of health blushed on the young cheek of Emma, and its
                  sunbeam sparkled in her clear azure eye. Exercise in the open air gave vigour to
                  her frame and elasticity to her step. She delighted most in riding on horseback,
                  as the daughters of Virginia are wont to do. She had her own favourite horse,
                  black and shining as ebony, which, though fleet and spirited as the deer, seemed
                  gentle as a lamb. She would ride with her brother and myself over mountain and
                  plain, swift and fearless as the eagle. And now, my daughter, I come to that dark
                  era of my life, which I must hurry over, lest reason plunge headlong in the grave
                  of memory. I cannot relate the particulars; but, once, during those mountain
                  rides, just two weeks before our appointed nuptials, her horse took fright and
                  leaped over a precipice, whose brink—God of heaven!—was covered with wild roses
                  and flowering vines."</p>
               <p>The minister rose and walked the length of his study, back and forth, and back and
                  forth, with clasped hands, and eyes darkened by the memory of despair. Eulalia
                  could not speak. She was gazing, in imagination, on the mangled body of Emma, at
                  the foot of that awful precipice,—on the horse and the rider, both quivering and
                  bleeding in the agonies of death,—on the anguish of surviving friends; she was
                  dwelling on the appalling uncertainty of every earthly blessing,—the terrible<pb
                     n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6694-00000068"/> penalty love is doomed to pay for its
                  short dream of joy,—on the sad, sad doom of mortality; she wept as if her heart
                  would break,—wept for herself, wept for her minister, and for all the sons and
                  daughters of humanity.</p>
               <p>The sound of her suppressed sobs roused the minister from his own paroxysm of
                  grief. He resumed his seat, and wiped the cold moisture that had gathered on his
                  brow.</p>
               <p>"I can never tell you," he added, "the anguish that succeeded the first tempest of
                  sorrow,—the despair that brooded over my mind. For a long time, I thought I should
                  die. I prayed but to die, to throw off the cold, heavy burthen of life. I prayed
                  to die, not because I sighed for the joys of heaven, but that I was weary of the
                  gloom of earth. I thought not so much of meeting the spirit of my Emma above, as
                  losing the remembrance of her awful fate below. Had I then died, dark indeed would
                  have been my doom; but I lived for repentance, for faith, and hope. One of those
                  blessed servants of God, who are anointed for a peculiar mission, found me, and
                  dragged me up out of the depths of the abyss of blackness in which my soul was
                  plunged; he poured oil and balm into my wounds, bound them in the swaddling bands
                  which wrapped the babe of the manger, and left me not till he had laid me a
                  weeping penitent at the foot of the cross. Then a divine warmth penetrated my
                  heart. I looked upon this world only as the dim vestibule bule of a great and
                  glorious temple, and I said, 'I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God,
                  than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.' I looked upon it as a frail bridge over
                  the river of time: and I said, 'Let me guide my fellow-pilgrims over the tottering
                  planks, to the beautiful shores of the promised land,—that land whose celestial
                  beauties my eyes have been opened to behold.' I said, 'O, my God! I dedicate
                  myself to thee, body and soul, in life and death, for time and eternity.' Eulalia,
                  I have been true, as far as poor frail humanity can be, to the solemn vows of my
                  great consecration. I see now why I was led through such a thorny path. My soul
                  was so wedded to earth, nothing but a mighty wrench could have torn it from my
                  grasp. It was all right. 'Be still, and know that I am God.' We must sooner or
                  later obey this mandate; if not in the sorrows and tribulation of time, mid the
                  thunders and lightnings of eternal judgment."</p>
               <p>Eulalia sat pale with awe, listening to the solemn accents of the minister, and
                  gazing on his countenance, now flashing with a sublime fire. She felt humbled by
                  the selfishness of her grief, the rebelliousness of her will, the conviction she
                  had brought with her, that "there was no sorrow like unto her sorrow."</p>
               <p>"My father," at length she said, "I will try to profit by this sad lesson; but
                  pray for me, for I am very weak."</p>
               <p>A short time after, she rose to depart; but, after she<pb n="136-137"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000069"/> had bidden adieu, she lingered on the threshold, as
                  if something still remained unuttered.</p>
               <p>"Whatever be the event of this night," she said, in a faltering voice, "remember,
                  father, that <emph>he</emph> is a Christian."</p>
               <p>"To the Christian's God let us commend him, in faith and hope, and, above all, in
                  entire submission; and should our prayers be heard, my daughter, as something
                  whispers that they will, I believe Providence has a mission for you to perform,
                  the way of which will be made smooth beneath your feet. You will be a golden link
                  of union between the divided interests of humanity, and inherit the peculiar
                  blessing reserved for those who shall be called the children of God."</p>
               <p>Those prophetic words remained with Eulalia and strengthened her through that
                  long, long, sleepless night.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <p>POOR Albert! with what faithful affection, what unwearied devotion and unutterable
                  sorrow did he watch night and day by his sick and apparently dying master! He
                  would not leave him, though every kindness and attention was lavished upon the
                  stranger, so far from home and friends, that compassion could dictate or sympathy
                  impart. Though others watched, he could not, would not sleep. The only times he
                  would leave the room, was when his grief was wrought up to a paroxysm that was
                  perfectly uncontrollable, and he feared to disturb the patient by his bitter
                  cries. Then, he would rush out doors, throw himself upon the ground, and give vent
                  to the most heart-rending lamentations. The idea of his master's dying, and
                  leaving him alone in that strange land, filled him with the wildest terror as well
                  as the deepest anguish. He shrunk with horror from the sight of Mr. Hastings, whom
                  he believed his master's enemy; though whenever he entered the chamber he watched
                  him with the keenness of the basilisk.<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6694-00000070"/>
                  He could not bear to see him look at his master, and could he have done so, he
                  would have interposed a screen before his pallid face, to save it from the
                  influence of what he fully believed to be an <emph>evil eye.</emph> In the
                  architect, Mr. Brooks, who devoted every moment he could spare from professional
                  labours to the sick-bed of his friend, he had the most affectionate confidence,
                  and he loved the good minister, who was now his daily visiter. He would watch
                  their countenances with the most intense eagerness, as if he could read in those
                  solemn tablets the secret of his master's fate.</p>
               <p>Nothing could exceed the interest manifested by the whole neighbourhood in the
                  sick stranger, whose humanity and courtesy had softened many a bitter prejudice,
                  and inspired feelings of warm personal regard. The charm of romance, which even
                  the most matter-of-fact beings appreciate, gave an attraction to the sufferer,
                  that deepened the sympathy he awakened. The story of his love for Eulalia
                  Hastings, of his rejection by her father, of Eulalia's own love and sorrow, were
                  known far and near. Perhaps Betsy's garrulous tongue had told the secret; but
                  through whatever channel it came, it had been circulated from house to house, till
                  it was the theme of every tongue. Various were the commentaries it called forth.
                  Some condemned the stern fanaticism of the father; others praised him as a
                  glorious martyr to truth and humanity. Eulalia was too much beloved to be envied,
                  save by a jealous few, and even envy was transformed to pity in the contemplation
                  of her blighted hopes.</p>
               <p>Quite an affecting incident occurred the very evening that Eulalia visited the
                  minister. Nancy, who had heard with great sorrow of the illness of her benefactor,
                  and who had for days been confined to her bed, felt one of those sudden revivals
                  of strength peculiar to the victims of consumption. She heard that morning that
                  the Southern stranger must surely die, and she resolved to see his face again,
                  before it was hidden by the clods of the valley. In vain her poor old mother told
                  her she was too weak, too ill to go. She dragged her feeble footsteps to her
                  former home, stopping every now and then to rest by the wayside, and stooping to
                  pick up the wild flowers that grew in her path, thinking they might gladden the
                  sick man's fading sight. When she presented herself before the landlady, she
                  started as if a spectral illusion were bewildering her senses.</p>
               <p>"Why, Nancy—where in the world did you come from?" exclaimed Mrs. Grimby, giving
                  her a chair as she spoke, into which the wearied creature sank breathless and
                  exhausted.</p>
               <p>"How is the sick gentleman? Is he really going to die?" was Nancy's first
                  interrogation.</p>
               <p>"So the Doctor says," replied Mrs. Grimby, "and he knows best. Poor man! I feel so
                  sorry for him. It is so hard to be taken away, when none of his kin can be near
                  him. He's such a kind, pleasant gentleman,<pb n="140-141"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000071"/> one couldn't help liking him. Albert, too, that
                  poor yellow boy, takes on so desperately, it is enough to make one's heart ache to
                  hear him. I never would have believed it if I hadn't seen it—never in this world.
                  It sometimes seems as if he would go raving distracted."</p>
               <p>"May I see him?" asked Nancy, while a tear dropped upon the wild flowers she held
                  in her poor emaciated hand.</p>
               <p>"Lord bless you!—they won't let anybody but the Doctor and the minister and Mr.
                  Brooks go into the room now. They say it's the criticallest time of his whole
                  sickness. He don't take no notice of anybody or anything; but looks just like a
                  piece of white marble. No, Nancy, I wouldn't dare to let you in, to save my
                  life."</p>
               <p>"I'll just look at him and come out, without saying one word," pleaded the
                  invalid. "If he's going now I shall follow soon—and I want to see him only once. I
                  got out of my bed to come, though mother tried hard to keep me from it. You don't
                  know how good he has been to us. He gave us money, and what is more, the kindest
                  words and the most pitying looks. He doesn't despise the poor."</p>
               <p>"Yes—he's been kind to me," said Mrs. Grimby, and her voice choked.</p>
               <p>Nancy hailed this symptom of sensibility as propitious to her prayer—and she
                  pleaded so earnestly, with her large hollow eyes fixed so mournfully on her, with
                  that burning hectic spot on either cheek, that Mrs. Grimby consented, on condition
                  that she should walk on tiptoe, stay but one moment, and not open her lips while
                  she remained. The affectionate, grateful heart of the sick girl swelled almost to
                  bursting as she gazed on the inanimate and altered countenance of her friend.
                  Where was the kind and sunny smile, the darkly-beaming glance, the glow of life
                  and health, which had so lately lighted up their humble cottage and left their
                  bright reflection on its gloom? And Albert, too, who stood at the bed-head mute as
                  a statue—how dim and ashy looked his golden skin—how dull and melancholy his
                  bright black eye!</p>
               <p>"Come," whispered Mrs. Grimby, seeing Nancy's bosom heave, and fearing the
                  commencement of one of her racking coughs. "Come, you must not stay any
                  longer."</p>
               <p>Nancy slid softly down on one knee and laid her flowers on the pillow, as
                  reverently as one scatters them over the shrouded dead; then, rising and putting
                  her handkerchief to her face, left the apartment.</p>
               <p>"Stop, and let me give you a glass of wine before you go, Nancy," said the
                  landlady, "and bite a piece of cracker with it. You mustn't take on so. It's the
                  Lord's doing, and we must all die at last."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grimby felt very sorry for the poor girl, who had entered her service a
                  strong, blooming maiden. She remembered how faithfully she had laboured, even<pb
                     n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6694-00000072"/> after the clutch of the destroyer was
                  on her. She feared she had let her work too hard, that she had not been as kind
                  and considerate as she ought to have been. She feared she had sometimes spoken
                  quickly and harshly to her, and though she had never spared herself, she thought
                  she ought to have spared her more.</p>
               <p>"I wish I could send you home, Nancy," said she, following her to the door. "I do
                  hate to see you walk."</p>
               <p>"Thank you. I don't mind walking. I won't forget how kind you've been, Mrs.
                  Grimby. I hope the Lord will bless you for it."</p>
               <p>She did not mean the wine and the bread, which had really strengthened her
                  exhausted frame, but the transient glimpse she had given her of the pale face and
                  scarcely breathing form she never more expected to behold.</p>
               <p>And what did the morning bring to the anxious watchers round that still couch,
                  over which the shadows of death seemed slowly, darkly gathering? What did it bring
                  to the throbbing heart, which had counted the weary moments by its own wild
                  beatings? It brought hope—hope born from the bosom of despair; and the tidings was
                  like a resurrection from the dead. As the minister had said, there <emph>is
                     hope,</emph> as long as there is an omnipotent God to watch over us.</p>
               <p>The convalescence of the invalid was slow, but cheered by so many acts of
                  kindness, he could not murmur at his imprisonment. As soon as he was able to be
                  moved, Doctor Ellery insisted upon taking him to the Parsonage, where, in perfect
                  quietude, he could wait his complete restoration. Albert, whose joy was as
                  demonstrative as his grief had been, was enraptured at the change, for he could
                  not hear a slamming door or a resounding step in the house, without trembling for
                  his master's weakened nerves. The change was indeed a grateful one from the bustle
                  of an inn, to the deep tranquillity of that pastoral home. The minister treated
                  him with even parental tenderness; and the good housekeeper made for him the
                  nicest panada, the most delicious wine whey, and every delicacy medical wisdom
                  permitted the invalid to taste. And Dora, sweet little Dora, came every day to see
                  him, laden with flowers, with which she decorated his room, and sometimes
                  playfully adorned the folds of his dressing-gown. She told him how sad and sorry
                  they all were, when he was so sick, and that even now, sister Eula never
                  smiled.</p>
               <p>"Do you know," said she, in a low, confiding tone, "that I heard mamma talking to
                  papa about sister Eula, and she said she was afraid she would fall into a
                  consumption. Oh! wouldn't that be dreadful? Poor Nancy Brown has got it, and don't
                  she look bad?"</p>
               <p>Moreland felt icy-cold shivers run through his frame.</p>
               <p>"And what did your papa say?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"He didn't say nothing; but put his hands behind him, so, and walked up and down,
                  and up and down, just as he always does when anything pesters him.<pb n="144"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000073"/> Then mamma said, if Eula was only in the South,
                  there wouldn't be any danger."</p>
               <p>"Did your mother say that? God bless her!" exclaimed Moreland, drawing the little
                  chatterer closer in his arms; "and what did your papa say then?"</p>
               <p>"He kept saying, 'God knows, God knows,' and went right out of the room. Then I
                  saw mamma was crying, and I went and kissed away her tears."</p>
               <p>While Moreland listened to the artless prattle of the child, a new and powerful
                  motive of action was born within him. The proud spirit which had told him never to
                  hazard a second rejection should be subdued. What were the hazard of a thousand
                  rejections to Eulalia's danger? He <emph>would</emph> snatch her from a clime
                  where the damps of death are so often mingled with the soft dews of night,—he
                     <emph>would</emph> save her from a doom, the very thought of which froze his
                  veins with horror,—if there was power in man or help in Heaven, he would do it.
                  The energy of his purpose gave him strength. He rose and sought the minister; he
                  told him all his past history, his present intentions, his future hopes. He
                  besought his influence and co-operation, his counsels and his prayers. All these
                  were promised, and they were all given.</p>
               <p>No one knew what passed between the minister and Mr. Hastings; but every day the
                  former was seen to visit the latter, and after long private interviews they would
                  separate, with the impress of deep thought on<pb n="(Illustration) -145"

                  </figure> their brows. They also took long walks together in sequestered by-paths,
                  and sometimes they wandered to the graveyard, and, leaning on some old gray
                  tombstone, would converse earnestly and gravely with each other. The villagers,
                  who were well aware of the want of harmony in the sentiments of the two parties,
                  wondered at this unwonted communion, though many were shrewd enough to divine the
                  cause; and they shook their heads, and said that the good minister might talk till
                  every hair of his head turned to silver, and he never would make such an obstinate
                  man as Squire Hastings change his purpose.</p>
               <p>As soon as he was able to walk abroad, Moreland called at Mr. Hastings's. Dora
                  flew to the gate to meet him, almost wild with joy, and ushered him into the
                  sitting-room, with delighted eagerness.</p>
               <p>"Mamma, sister Eula—here's Mr. Moreland come again. Ain't you glad?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hastings came forward and extended her hand, with a most heartfelt expression
                  of pleasure. Eulalia, too, while a bright rosy cloud swept over her lovely face,
                  suffered her hand to linger in the greeting pressure of his, and her eye, so soft,
                  yet thrilling, mingled for a moment its glad rays with the languid but now
                  kindling fires of his own. In vain he assured them that he disclaimed all the
                  privileges of an invalid. The easy chair was brought forward; a glass of sangaree,
                  rich with the aroma of the nutmeg, prepared for his refreshment. He<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000075"/> was even threatened with a pillow, for the repose
                  of his head, but this he strenuously refused. He was forced, however, to
                  acknowledge that he was weary from his walk, and that there was much comfort in
                  the soft depths of that "old arm-chair." He looked very pale and interesting; and
                  there was a grace in his languor, more attractive than the vigour of health.</p>
               <p>He had no reason to be displeased with his reception. Mr. Hastings came in rubbing
                  his hands, with his "very happy to see you" air. Reuben shook his hand most
                  vehemently, and Betsy's honest face shone upon him through the half-opened
                  door.</p>
               <p>"You look a little the worse for the wear," said Mr. Hastings. "I am sorry to see
                  it. I fear you will carry away with you unfavourable impressions of our
                  climate."</p>
               <p>"I had a similar attack at home," replied Moreland; "so I must think my malady
                  independent of the latitude where I dwell. I sometimes think," he added with a
                  smile, "that I might have escaped this last infliction had not the alarmed
                  affection of my boy placed me in the hands of the doctor."</p>
               <p>"I believe you are free from the scourge of our climate—consumption," observed Mr.
                  Hastings. "Your mild, uniform temperature is favourable to the lungs."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Moreland, looking at Eulalia, from whose transparent complexion the
                  rosy hue had faded, leaving it of waxen delicacy. "The frail and delicate from
                  other regions are safe when they breathe our genial atmosphere. The consumptive
                  sometimes finds a grave beneath our flowers; but it is when they come too late for
                  restoration."</p>
               <p>Here a slight cough from Eulalia made Moreland start. He gazed long and anxiously
                  upon her. She was thinner than when he first saw her—and so exquisitely, so
                  delicately fair! The faint blue meandering of her temple veins was visible through
                  her alabaster skin. Then her eyes of such velvet softness, such languishing
                  brightness—had they not the fatal beauty which marks the victims of consumption?
                  Those long, pensive, dark lashes—did they not seem to weep over the radiance
                  doomed to an early fading? Eulalia looked up, and meeting his earnest gaze,
                  understood its meaning.</p>
               <p>"If you were as familiar with colds," she said, with a sweet, assuring smile, "as
                  we are here, you would think a cough of very little consequence."</p>
               <p>"Did you ever read the story in the 'Diary of a Physician,' called A Slight Cold?"
                  asked Moreland. "It is made of some consequence there."</p>
               <p>"If you are not too much fatigued," said Mr. Hastings, rising with considerable
                  embarrassment of manner, "I would like you to walk into my study with me a few
                  moments, Mr. Moreland. You will find an arm-chair there also, for my wife has an
                  eye to my comfort as well as that of her guests."</p>
               <p>Moreland rose with alacrity, and obeyed the movement of the Philanthropist. As he
                  passed out of the<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6694-00000076"/> doorway, he saw
                  Eulalia cast a look at her father so tender and beseeching, he thought he must be
                  made of stone to resist the mute appeal. When they reached the study, Mr. Hastings
                  went through every possible preliminary, to retard the conversation he had sought.
                  He moved the chairs, the books and papers on the table, opened the windows, wiped
                  his face with his handkerchief, and dusted the knees of his pantaloons.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Moreland," said he, at length seating himself, drawing a heavy volume towards
                  him, and poising it over the table, "circumstances have arisen since our last
                  conversation, which have somewhat modified the views I then expressed. My
                  principles are unchanged, my views of your Southern institutions are unchanged,
                  but I am led to believe that the will of God demands of me a sacrifice, and to
                  that will I am constrained to bow. Do not interrupt me. I wish to explain myself,
                  so that you may understand I am not acting in an inconsistent manner. I did not
                  know, when I conversed with you last, the strength of your attachment to my
                  daughter. I did not know that her happiness was involved in this union. I find
                  that your hearts are drawn towards each other in a very strong and peculiar
                  manner; and I begin to see the dealings of Providence in this dispensation.
                  Eulalia is a delicate child. I have brought her up in fear and trembling. In
                  short, she is a tropic flower, born to be nurtured beneath milder skies than ours.
                  To preserve her health, to prolong her life, I am willing to hazard the high
                  social position I at present occupy. Sir, I shall falsify myself to save my
                  daughter. I have said in public and in private, that I would never suffer wife or
                  child of mine to live at the South, even if I could add ten years to their
                  existence; and I meant what I said—but we are all weak and fallible. I thought I
                  had more firmness; but so many counter influences have been acting upon me! Your
                  dangerous illness immediately following my rejection; my daughter's fading health;
                  the prayers of my wife; the counsels of our minister; the opinions of my best
                  friends, all have actuated me to revoke the decision I had made. There is another
                  motive. You said you looked upon yourself as a missionary, appointed by heaven for
                  the good of a benighted race. That remark has had great weight with me. More than
                  all else, it has induced me to sacrifice my daughter."</p>
               <p>"Call it not a sacrifice!" exclaimed Moreland, who had waited with glowing
                  impatience for the conclusion of this long harangue, "call it a gift, the most
                  precious gift of Heaven, and I bless you for the bestowal. Believe me, sir, you
                  never will repent this yielding of your will to the pleadings of affection, the
                  urgings of reason. Eulalia, I will watch over and cherish her, as never yet was
                  woman loved and cherished. She will be adored by the affectionate community over
                  which she will preside. Yes! I feel that her lot will be a happy one. As for your
                  son, consider me from this moment as his elder<pb n="150-151"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000077"/> brother, the joint guardian of his best interests.
                  And should your darling Dora ever need a father's care, that sacred care be mine.
                  Oh! sir, you have made me a very happy man; I thank you, I bless you for it. I
                  feel new life, new health, flowing into my veins. Let me go. I am but half blest
                  till Eulalia shares my joy."</p>
               <p>"No, no!—I will send her to you," replied the father, clearing his throat of a
                  strange huskiness. He was softened by the outgushings of that warm, generous
                  heart; he was pleased with himself, for the great sacrifice he thought he had
                  made—he was exalted in his own estimation. And now he had actually passed the
                  Rubicon of his prejudices, he could not help contemplating the worldly advantages
                  of the union. It would be a fine thing for Reuben to have a rich, influential
                  brother-in-law; it would be well, if himself and Mrs. Hastings should be called
                  away, to have a fair and opulent home for the orphan Dora. Eulalia, cradled in the
                  lap of wealth and fanned by the fragrant breezes of the South, would bloom like
                  its wild-wood blossoms. Then, she would go forth as a missionary, to bind up the
                  bleeding wounds and smarting stripes of the poor slaves (for he had dwelt so long
                  on the picture his imagination had drawn, it was an indelible reality to him),—she
                  would teach their darkened minds the way of salvation, and draw them out of their
                  bondage and chains, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</p>
               <p>These thoughts comforted him, and gave a benignant expression to his countenance,
                  as he sought Eulalia, which was beautiful to her as the sunshine of heaven. She
                  knew that all her earthly happiness hung on the issue of that hour. She had waited
                  in trembling apprehension its close, hoping, fearing, doubting; and now, when her
                  father opened the door and beckoned her to him, with a smile, she felt sick and
                  giddy with the excess of her emotion. She rose to meet him, but seated herself
                  again, for the room darkened around her.</p>
               <p>"Come, my daughter," said he, approaching her, and putting one arm around
                  her,—"come into the fresh air; it will revive you."</p>
               <p>He led her through the garden path to the door of the study. He was silent,
                  preparing a speech for the occasion, which would be a striking display of
                  philanthropy and parental tenderness combined; but when he placed her hand in that
                  of Moreland, his voice choked, his pompous declamation utterly failed, and he
                  turned abruptly and left the room. Though privileged to remain, we will follow his
                  example.</p>
               <p>Joy is the best physician, after all. From this hour Moreland gained strength and
                  elasticity. Eulalia's cheek recovered its soft oval outline, and the pale virgin
                  rose once more blushed under its transparent surface.</p>
               <p>The rumour of the approaching wedding circulated through the village, and there
                  was more than the usual amount of admiration and interest. Mr. Hastings found<pb
                     n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6694-00000078"/> himself a perfect <emph>lion,</emph>
                  and was of course pleased, in spite of his great sacrifice.</p>
               <p>"Well, Squire, I hear you're going to give your daughter to a Southerner, after
                  all. How are you going to reconcile it to your principles?"</p>
               <p>"I am only yielding to a higher power. Man proposes, but God disposes. The life of
                  both was at stake, and had I persisted in my first decision I might be arraigned
                  hereafter for the crime of murder. Besides, I send my daughter forth as a
                  missionary, just as much as if she were bound for Burmah or Hindostan. I trust my
                  friends will not accuse me of inconsistency."</p>
               <p>Thus his neighbours addressed him, and thus he answered. He was establishing the
                  reputation of a martyr. The fiery locks that wreathed his brow were assuming the
                  character of a flaming crown of glory.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>MORELAND sat in the same seat he had occupied many Sabbaths before. The same
                  majestic anthem rolled round the walls of the church, consecrating it for the
                  approach of the minister. It was the last Sunday he expected to worship there; the
                  last Sunday the angel voice of Eulalia would mingle with her sister choristers in
                  hymns of praise and hosannas of adoration. In the midst of the closing strains,
                  when in clear, sweet, ascending, and sublime accents, she repeated the burden of
                  the anthem, <q>
                     <l>"When rolling years shall cease to move,"</l>
                  </q> there was a sudden trembling and faltering, then a pause, and a silence, as
                  if the song of the morning stars were instantaneously hushed. Moreland listened
                  breathlessly. He thought he heard a faint sob behind that green curtain—and his
                  own bosom heaved. He began to realize all that Eulalia was resigning for him; the
                  strength of the ties she was severing; the dear and holy associations she was
                  rending asunder. Could he make up to her all<pb n="154-155"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000079"/> that she relinquished? Father, mother, brother,
                  sister, pastor, idolizing friends, the scenes of her happy childhood, her
                  sheltered, peaceful youth? Yes! his love, passing as it did the love of man,
                  should indemnify her for all. And in that heaven-dedicated place, he made a vow
                  before God, that her happiness should be the first aim of his existence.</p>
               <p>Eulalia sat behind the curtain, her face bowed on her hands, which covered her
                  falling tears. Her companions respected her emotions, and, even after the minister
                  commenced the solemn rites of the day, they suffered the green screen to remain,
                  that concealed her from the gaze of the congregation. Their own eyes glistened,
                  when they thought that, on another Sabbath, that fair form and sweet face and
                  celestial voice would be wanting in the village choir.</p>
               <p>Eulalia sat behind the curtain, oppressed with the solemnities of the place, and
                  borne down by the weight of her own feelings. Her thoughts wandered from the past
                  to the future, forgetful of the purposes of the present hour. The minister seemed
                  to be repeating in her ear the tragic story of his early love, instead of the
                  mysteries and glories of revelation. The sighing boughs of the elms, as they
                  whispered through the windows of the gallery, told her sweet histories of her
                  youth, and breathed a sad and lingering farewell. She was going to a land of
                  strangers, to be surrounded by a girdle of darkness, from which there was no
                  escape,—where, she had learned to believe, the fires of insurrection were for ever
                  smouldering. But she was going with Moreland, and the companionship of such a
                  being would make a Paradise of even the frozen regions of Nova Zembla,—how much
                  more of the beautiful and flower-enamelled South! How unworthy was she, the humble
                  village maiden, of the love of one so gifted and so noble! Was she indeed to
                  become his wife, the mother of his child? She, the young and inexperienced? Like
                  the handmaid of the Lord, she pondered on all these things, while the deep-toned
                  voice of the minister fell in grave and solemn music on her ear. Forgive her
                  wandering thoughts, for she is passing the great crisis of her being. She tries to
                  bring them home to God, but in vain. She feels, in imagination, the child's soft
                  arms clinging round her neck, its fair head cradled on her breast. She is
                  breathing up to Heaven prayers for its helpless innocency,—prayers for wisdom to
                  guide, for strength to guard, for power to go before it, in the purity and light
                  of a Christian example. She sees its tender, appealing eyes lifted lovingly to her
                  own. Are they the eyes of Moreland, or of the unhappy Claudia? She cannot bear the
                  suggestion. That name always comes chillingly over her glowing heart. It is not
                  jealousy, but dread. She dreads to think of one, who, once blessed with the heart
                  of Moreland, could cast away such a gem.</p>
               <p>As they walked home from church, Mr. and Mrs. Hastings arm and arm, Moreland by
                  the side of Eulalia,<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6694-00000080"/> with Dora's hand
                  clinging to his; not a word was spoken by either, till Dora, as usual, broke the
                  silence.</p>
               <p>"What's the reason you didn't sing, sister Eula—? and what's the reason you don't
                  talk any now? 'Tisn't a sin to talk going home from church, is it?"</p>
               <p>"No, my child," said her father, turning round; "many things are lawful, which are
                  not expedient under particular circumstances."</p>
               <p>"I don't know what you mean!" cried Dora.</p>
               <p>"I mean that your sister feels more like thinking than talking just now, and so we
                  all do. Supposing you try to think of what good Doctor Ellery said, till we reach
                  home."</p>
               <p>"I love to think loud," replied the child. "What good does it do to think, if we
                  don't tell anybody of it?"</p>
               <p>"She is right," said Moreland, in a low voice to Eulalia; "it is not good to brood
                  too long over our own solitary thoughts. I think I understand your feelings; but
                  if you have one unexpressed regret, if you have one wish concealed, breathe it
                  now, assured it shall be gratified, if it be in the power of man to do it."</p>
               <p>"I have wept over the blessings I am about to resign," replied Eulalia; "for they
                  magnify like the sun, when his parting rays shine upon us. But at this moment I
                  regret, most of all, my unworthiness of the blessings for which I exchange
                  them."</p>
               <p>Had Eulalia been a fashionable belle, she never would have made this meek,
                  depreciating speech; but she was truth, simplicity, guilelessness, and purity—and
                  Moreland loved her all the more for these unworldly attributes. If he did not
                  reconcile her to herself, it was because the heart has no rhetoric, language no
                  inspiration.</p>
               <p>The wedding was to be very simple. It was to take place on the morning of their
                  departure, without any display, waiters or attendants. But though no bridal pomp
                  accompanied her nuptials, Eulalia was not suffered to depart without the most
                  abundant tokens of affection and appreciation. Gifts were showered upon her—not
                  costly ones, such as diamonds and precious stones, but heart-tokens far more
                  precious in her estimation. The Sabbath-school children whom she had taught so
                  faithfully and lovingly, brought her bouquets of flowers and trifles of their own
                  manufacture. Even the poor, whom her bounty, restricted as it was obliged to be,
                  had so often relieved; and whom her sympathy and cares, which were ever unlimited,
                  had so often blessed, crowded round her with their blessings and their homely
                  offerings. One poor woman, whose hands were half paralyzed, gave her an
                  ironing-holder, which she had made of patchwork and quilted; another, near eighty
                  years of age, presented her with a comb-case, framed of pasteboard and covered
                  with calico, manufactured by her own aged and tremulous fingers. Very homely as
                  were these gifts,<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6694-00000081"/> Eulalia received them
                  with a tear and a smile, and promised to keep them as long as she lived.</p>
               <p>"What shall I do," said a feeble octogenarian, wiping the tears from her silver
                  lashes—"what shall I do, when you are gone? Who will read me God's blessed word,
                  and talk to me so sweetly of a Saviour's love and the joys laid up for the
                  righteous in Heaven?"</p>
               <p>"Dora shall take my place. She can read now as well as I can, and in a few years
                  she can talk to you of all these things, and you will teach her lessons of
                  meekness and piety, even as you have done to me."</p>
               <p>"What shall I do," exclaimed a poor sick mother, reclining on a couch of pain, by
                  which Eulalia had oft-times knelt and prayed—"when you are gone so far away? Who
                  will love and care for my orphan children as you have done? Who will teach them to
                  be good and keep them out of bad company as you have done?"</p>
               <p>"My mother will still be your friend, and as Dora grows older she will do all that
                  I have done, and I trust far more. I am going to leave her a precious legacy,
                  which, young as she is, she will consider sacred."</p>
               <p>"It is so hard to give you up," said another. "It seems as if I could be willing,
                  Miss Euly, if you weren't going among such awful people. But I am so afraid you'll
                  repent on't. You are going to have a fine husband, to be sure, and you'll ride in
                  a fine carriage and live in a grand house, and you'll never be obliged to wet your
                  fingers' ends; but the riches that don't come righteously eously won't bless a
                  body. I wouldn't use money that was got by selling a human being, any more than I
                  would take up live coals out of the chimney and eat 'em."</p>
               <p>"You need not fear for me," said Eulalia, gently. "I do not expect such trials as
                  that."</p>
               <p>The evening before her marriage she accompanied Moreland to Dame Brown's cottage,
                  for Nancy could not come to her. The walk she took to visit the apparently dying
                  Moreland had accelerated the progress of her fatal malady, and she was now
                  confined to the house, and most of the time to her bed. Albert had told him of
                  that visit, and he never recalled it without the deepest emotion. Albert, with a
                  delicacy of feeling seldom found in the uneducated, had picked up the wilted
                  flowers she left upon his pillow, after they had fallen under the feet, and
                  preserved them in water till his master's brightening vision could rest upon the
                  gift.</p>
               <p>"This is very good of you to come and see me, when you have so many friends to
                  take leave of," said Nancy, leaning forward with eagerness to greet her. "And you
                  too, sir," she added, holding out to Moreland her wasted and burning hand. "I
                  never expected to see you in this poor cabin again—never; but it's wonderful what
                  the Lord can do!"</p>
               <p>"She looks dreadful bad, don't she?" asked Dame Brown, who sat in an old arm-chair
                  by the side of Nancy's bed. "She can't hold out much longer. She<pb n="160-161"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000082"/> coughs all night long, and you can hear her breathe
                  e'enamost out of doors."</p>
               <p>"I feel easier now, mother," said she. "Don't worry them by talking about what
                  can't be helped. Every pain helps me on my journey home! I shall soon be there!
                  Oh, yes! I shall soon be there!"</p>
               <p>She lifted up her large, intensely bright eyes, with a smile that gleamed wildly
                  on her sunken features.</p>
               <p>"You are willing to die, Nancy?" cried Moreland, seeing that Eulalia was too much
                  affected to speak, and on whose face she now turned an eager, wistful gaze. "You
                  are not afraid of the sting of death? You look upon Heaven as your everlasting
                  home?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! sir," she replied, solemnly, "my Saviour has taken away the sting of death,
                  and given me victory over the grave. Why should I fear to die? Why should I wish
                  to live? I've struggled with poverty all my life, and it has been a bitter
                  warfare. When I was strong and could labour for my poor mother, I was willing to
                  work the livelong day, though it seemed ever so long. But I havn't had much
                  pleasure in life, even at the best, for the life of the poor and toiling has many
                  a thorn and but few roses. Oh! sir," she cried, suddenly raising herself in the
                  bed and clasping her thin hands over her knees, "I am so glad you are going to
                  take her away from here! She might get the consumption, for she's one of the fair
                  and beautiful ones that are sure to be singled out. I used to have round, blooming
                  cheeks, and the people of the tavern praised me for my looks."</p>
               <p>One sigh to the memory of her departed beauty convulsed the breast of the dying
                  girl.</p>
               <p>"Yes!" said her mother, "they used to call her pretty Nancy. Her cheeks were as
                  rosy as you ever saw, and she had pretty holes in them, when she laughed; and now,
                  they are so hollow, and such an awful round red spot right in the middle. Oh! Lord
                  a marcy, what will become of me when she's gone, and you not by to comfort me,
                  Miss Euly?"</p>
               <p>"God will take care of you. God will comfort you," said Eulalia; "you will never
                  want for friends."</p>
               <p>"Only to think," said the old woman, following the lead of her rambling thoughts,
                  as she looked from Eulalia to Moreland, and forgetting, for the moment, her own
                  sorrow,—"only to think of the Squire's letting you go off with a furrener, after
                  making such an ado about the way they carry on. I don't see how he can get over
                  his speeches and writings, and the awful things he's told the people about the
                  South folks. Well, well, I am glad for one account,—Miss Euly's going to have a
                  kind, handsome husband, if there ever was one, and a rich one; and she'll do a
                  power of good with her money. I know you can't be cruel to anybody, sir; and if
                  she sees folks happy about you and her, she'd better not fret and worry about
                  other folks. Do all the good you can, and leave the rest to Providence. I'm
                  nothing but<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6694-00000083"/> a poor old creature now,
                  and havn't any business to talk and advise my betters; but I was reckoned smart in
                  my day, and sometimes it seems as if I could see through a kind of loophole,
                  brighter than I ever did before. I've been thinking a mighty deal about these
                  affairs since you've come among us, and have been so good to us, and your yellow
                  boy has brought us so many nice things, and Miss Euly is going off with you; and I
                  know there's been wrong said and done. Your boy told us how kindly you treated 'em
                  all, and how they all loved you, and how everybody round you was good, and didn't
                  practise the iniquities they tell us of. Lord a marcy,—how monstrous difficult it
                  is to get at the truth!"</p>
               <p>The good woman fairly paused for breath, and Nancy repeated, as she had often done
                  before,</p>
               <p>"She don't mean any harm, any more than a child."</p>
               <p>When Eulalia rose to depart, Nancy drew her down and whispered to her to open the
                  upper bureau drawer and bring her a breast-pin, fastened to a little round
                  pincushion.—It was a low, old-fashioned bureau, and the breast-pin was also
                  old-fashioned, being in the form of a heart, set round with pearl. It had a glass
                  in the centre, beneath which hair was intended to be set. Eulalia brought it to
                  the bedside, well divining her purpose.</p>
               <p>"And now," said Nancy, "please take the scissors hanging by the window, and cut
                  off a lock of my hair and have it put under that glass when I am dead and gone, to
                  remember me by. The one that gave me that breast-pin is dead, so there's no harm
                  in my giving it away."</p>
               <p>Moreland and Eulalia exchanged a quick flashing glance of intelligence. A history
                  of love and fidelity was contained in those few words. The form of the heart was
                  emblematical; even the pearls were significant of the tears of sorrow, which had
                  probably bedewed this simple pledge. It was henceforth sacred in Eulalia's eyes.
                  She took the scissors, and Nancy, bending forward, shook down the matted tresses
                  of her long black hair, once so smooth and shining. Eulalia separated one from the
                  rest, and attempted to sever it from the head it once adorned, but her eyes were
                  blinded by tears, and her fingers had no strength. Moreland took the scissors
                  gently from her hand, and cut two locks from the heavy mass that shaded the
                  pillow.</p>
               <p>"One for her, Nancy, and one for myself."—"Oh! sir!" exclaimed Nancy, bursting
                  into tears. Not another word was spoken before they left the cottage, for the
                  hearts of all were full. They knew that, in all human probability, they would not
                  meet again, till they met in the light of eternity.</p>
               <p>Moreland left with Mrs. Hastings a sum for the support of Nancy. If it lasted
                  longer than her life, it was to be given to the poor and aged mother. Every token
                  of love to Eulalia was also paid with usury. The patchwork<pb n="164-165"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000084"/> work holder was transmuted into gold, and the
                  calico comb-case went through the same chemical process.</p>
               <p>That night, when Moreland bade adieu to the family and turned his steps to the
                  parsonage, Mr. Hastings accompanied him.</p>
               <p>"I know how it will be in the morning," said he. "There will be no time for
                  talking in the midst of sad leave-takings; and I feel as if I had much to say. As
                  far as you are concerned, I have confidence to believe that you will make my
                  daughter happy; but, when I think of the entire change in her mode of living, and
                  the peculiar sensitiveness of her character, I have many misgivings. I think she
                  has a remarkable antipathy to negroes. I have tried to conquer it in every
                  possible way, but it, nevertheless, still exists."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" cried Moreland, in a tone of surprise and regret. "How has she
                  manifested this unusual repugnance? She sees so few of the race here, I can hardly
                  conceive how this antipathy could develop itself."</p>
               <p>"About a year ago," continued Mr. Hastings, "I met in my travels a poor runaway
                  negro—half-clothed, half-starved, the victim of an inhuman master, who, like the
                  persecuted Son of Man, had not literally where to lay his head. Sir, I had
                  compassion on him. I looked upon him as a man and as a brother. I took him into my
                  carriage, brought him to my home, welcomed him to my board and my best household
                  cheer. He told me the story of his sufferings and wrongs, and they were enough to
                  move the very stones to cry out for vengeance. He remained with me for weeks, and
                  during all that time Eulalia manifested a loathing so unnatural that it distressed
                  me beyond expression. She could not eat seated at his side; she actually
                  languished and sickened, and did not revive till he left me."</p>
               <p>"I have heard the history of your hospitality to that vagabond," cried
                  Moreland—and he could not help speaking in an excited and indignant voice—"and I
                  have traced him from the beginning of his infamous career. He is a vile scoundrel,
                  who, having first robbed and then attempted to murder his master, fled and hid
                  himself from pursuit in the Dismal Swamp of his native state. His whole story was
                  a lie. I am sorry your compassion was called forth by so unworthy an object. I am
                  sorry your hospitality was degraded so low. I do not wonder that Eulalia shrunk
                  with horror from the approach of such a wretch; that her intuitive delicacy and
                  purity felt the contamination and withered under its influence. Why, I am told you
                  were obliged to turn him out of doors for his insolence."</p>
               <p>"Granting that I was deceived in him, it does not follow that the principle upon
                  which I acted was wrong. I should do the same thing, under the same circumstances.
                  My fellow men shall never call upon me in vain for redress or protection."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear you utter that sentiment," exclaimed Moreland; "and on its
                  faith and strength I call<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6694-00000085"/> upon you, in
                  the name of my Southern brethren, for redress and protection. Believe not all the
                  tales of the vagrants, who are mostly fugitives from justice, not oppression. In
                  your zeal for one portion of humanity forget not the interests of another, to
                  which you are more closely allied. And one thing let me tell you, sir; if
                  Eulalia's happiness and life are dear to your soul, if you would not arm the hand
                  of the assassin, and kindle the brand of the incendiary, suspend your fiery
                  efforts in the cause of emancipation. You are blowing the flames of insurrection,
                  and no language can convey the faintest conception of the horrors that may ensue.
                  You know not what you are doing. The time will come when waves of blood may roll
                  over the land—and where will Eulalia be? Can my single arm hold her up above the
                  crimson billows, my single breast shield her from the unimaginable horrors of
                  servile warfare?"</p>
               <p>They had reached the grove of the Parsonage—and they both stopped involuntarily
                  and gazed upon each other. The moon at that moment came out from behind a cloud,
                  and the dark eyes of Moreland flashed back its resplendent lustre. Mr. Hastings
                  looked very pale in the silver light—</p>
               <p>"I cannot expose my daughter to the possibility of such a fate," he cried. "Thank
                  God, it is not too late!"</p>
               <p>"Your word is pledged, and, as a man of honour, you cannot retract," exclaimed
                  Moreland, startled into a consciousness of his imprudence. "I was only lifting a
                  warning voice. I was endeavouring to arrest a course of action which must
                  inevitably result in ruin. I did not intend to express myself so strongly. Indeed,
                  so firm is my reliance on the fidelity and affection of my own negroes, I believe,
                  if an insurrection really took place, they would die in my defence."</p>
               <p>"So every one thinks of their own," was the caustic reply. "Self-love,—nothing but
                  self-love, Mr. Moreland. This is a serious view of the subject,—a very serious
                  view. I must take time for reflection. The wedding cannot be consummated on the
                  morrow."</p>
               <p>"Good Heavens!" cried Moreland, "I never will submit to this wanton trifling with
                  my hopes and affections. Why, it is worse than the tortures of the
                  Inquisition!"</p>
               <p>At this critical moment, when angry passions were swelling in the bosoms of each,
                  the slender but majestic form of the minister came gliding, in his student's robe
                  of flowing black silk, under the boughs of the trees, now involved in thick
                  shadows, now illuminated by the white moonbeams, and stood before them, with his
                  serene, thoughtful brow, and religious-beaming eyes. He had heard their excited
                  tones, and he came to soothe and to reconcile. And there he stood, talking with
                  them long and earnestly, regardless of the night-chill to which he so seldom
                  exposed himself. He spoke with the benignity of the Christian, blended with the
                  authority that invests his divine office. He would not suffer them to<pb
                     n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6694-00000086"/> separate till harmony was restored,
                  promises renewed, and the hopes of the morrow born anew.</p>
               <p>Eulalia, in the mean time, unconscious of the agitating interview between her
                  father and her lover, was sitting at her chamber window, with no light but that of
                  the moonbeams which streamed in through the casement. She had extinguished the
                  candle, lest it should bear witness to her tears; but she could not extinguish the
                  greater glory of the heavens. It gushed in through the muslin curtains, and flowed
                  round her as she sat in her loose white robes, making her look like an angel of
                  light. It flooded one side of the bed, where little Dora lay sleeping, as
                  tranquilly as if there were no such thing as parting in the world. Mrs. Hastings
                  had just left the apartment, and Eulalia had been breathing out all her filial
                  love, gratitude, and sorrow on her breast. Who can wonder that she wept the last
                  night she was to sleep under that dear, paternal roof she might never again
                  behold! Who can wonder that she trembled in the prospect of that long, long
                  journey, when she had never travelled more than twenty miles from home before!</p>
               <p>How she wished she could live over again her youthful years; that she might show
                  more love and devotion and tenderness to her parents, more affection to her
                  brother and sister, more consideration for all around her! How much more she might
                  have done for others, how much less for herself!</p>
               <p>"How selfish I have been!" thought she; "how absorbed sorbed in my own thoughts
                  and feelings! I might have saved my dear mother so many weary steps, if I had only
                  thought of it. Poor Betsy, too! How hard she has been working for me! I ought not
                  to have permitted it. I wish father could afford to hire another woman, to lighten
                  her labours. And I—I shall have more servants than I know what to do with. Surely
                  toil divided among so many cannot be so wearing as it is here."</p>
               <p>The door slowly opened, and Betsy stole in, shutting it very softly behind her.
                  She came near the window where Eulalia was sitting, and sunk wearily on a trunk,
                  all packed and strapped for travelling.</p>
               <p>"Poor Betsy! how tired you must be!" said Eulalia, and her voice, always sweet and
                  gentle, never sounded so sweet and gentle before to Betsy's weary ears.</p>
               <p>"Yes, that I am, Miss Euly; but I thought I must creep in and see you a few
                  moments to-night. There'll be such a bustle in the morning, I couldn't get in a
                  word edgeways, I know. I'm dreadful sorry to lose you, but I hope our loss will be
                  your gain. I guess you'll be well off—a powerful sight better off than the rest of
                  us. Your pa has to scuffle mightily to get along, and if your ma was not the best
                  manager in the world, he couldn't make the eends of the year meet. I save all I
                  can, gracious knows, tho' I tries to have everything in a genteel style. I thinks
                  more of the appearance of the house than Miss Hastings does herself."</p>
               <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6694-00000087"/>
               <p>"Yes, Betsy, I know how faithful and economical you are, how industrious and good.
                  I shall feel happy in thinking my mother has such a helpmate and friend. Promise
                  me, Betsy, for my sake, that you will not leave her. I know she never could supply
                  your place. I only wish she could afford to keep more help, so that you would not
                  have to work so hard. But you will have less to do when I am gone, Betsy."</p>
               <p>"No, that I sha'n't, for you're always helping me about my little chores. Besides,
                  it dont seem work, what I do for you. Your washing is as easy as nothing. When
                  folks is sweet-tempered, like you, their clothes just go in and out of the water,
                  and they're as nice as a snow-ball. As for leaving your mother, I ain't thinking
                  on it. She's a good woman, and I guess I'm as well off here as anywhere else, as
                  long as I have to work—and that I shall have to do as long as I live. Some helps
                  is always dissatisfied, grumbling, and changing about; but I'm not of that sort.
                  Some wants to sit down at the first table, and primp up and make believe they are
                  ladies; but I'm not of that sort, either. You don't know, Miss Euly, what a
                  discontented set most helps is. They never know when they're well off, and think
                  everybody that employs 'em is beholden to 'em."</p>
               <p>"They are not all so, Betsy, I am sure. You and Nancy are exceptions—and many
                  others besides. And now, Betsy, let me thank you for all your kindness to me, and
                  forgive me, if I have ever exacted too much of you. I have been thoughtless, I
                  know, but never intentionally unkind."</p>
               <p>Betsy, whose heart was brimful, just ready to run over, could not stand this
                  appeal. She bowed her head down into her checked apron and wept aloud.</p>
               <p>"Don't, Betsy!" cried Eulalia, putting her arm over her neck, thus prostrated in
                  grief. "You'll break my heart if you go on in this way. Don't!"</p>
               <p>"You've allers been just as good as you could be, and as innocent of harm as a
                  baby in the cradle. You mustn't talk in that way to me, Miss Euly. It makes me
                  feel too cheap. I come to tell you what Mr. Moreland done, and I got to talking so
                  it clean went out of my head for the time. I declare, if he ain't the most
                  significant man that ever was seen in this part of the world. To-night, when I was
                  milking, under the great big appletree the cows love to stand under, he come along
                  and stopped, and spoke to me as chirp as a bird, 'Betsy,' says he, 'here's a
                  trifle, if you will accept of it. You sat up with me when I was sick. Not that
                  money could pay such a service; but it may do you some good, and help you to take
                  care of your lame brother.' How in the world did he hear about that? He slipped
                  this piece of silver in my hand and went off, 'fore I had time to thank him. How
                  much is it, Miss Euly? A quarter, ain't it? It was kinder dark when I took it, and
                  I've been too busy to look at it since."</p>
               <p>Eulalia took it, well knowing that Moreland would not<pb n="172-173"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000088"/> give so small a boon, and as the moonlight gleamed
                  upon it, it gave back a bright, golden gleam.</p>
               <p>"This is an eagle, Betsy. It is worth ten dollars. You might know Mr. Moreland
                  would give you more than a quarter, if he gave you anything."</p>
               <p>"Well! did you ever? you don't say so? I declare it seems like robbery to take so
                  much—most equal to ten weeks' wages. Really, it don't seem right to keep it. Ain't
                  he a gentleman? I was thankful for a little, but so much as this makes me feel
                  really queer."</p>
               <p>"Keep it; he is rich, and can well afford it. It makes him happier to give than
                  you to receive. And now, Betsy, you are tired and ought to go to bed. You will
                  have to rise early, and so will I. We must all be cheerful in the morning—remember
                  that, Betsy. I would not sow in tears, though I trust to reap in joy."</p>
               <p>Betsy retired, gazing fondly through her tears at the golden eagle, almost
                  believing it an optical illusion—and Eulalia laid herself down by the sleeping
                  Dora, and pressed her cheek against the warm and glowing cheek pillowed so sweetly
                  there.</p>
               <p>Albert was quite mortified that his master's wedding should be such a plain and
                  matter-of-fact business. He remembered the splendour of his former marriage,—the
                  festal pomp, the crowding guests, the wreathing garlands, the illuminated halls,
                  and the exhilarating dance. He remembered the jubilee among the negroes; the cake
                  and lemonade distributed among them, the music of the banjo, the muffled thunders
                  of the tambourine. He was not at all pleased with the idea of his master's
                  marrying a poor Yankee girl, especially a daughter of Mr. Hastings, for whom he
                  had conceived a supreme dislike. Then, to be married in the morning, and start
                  right off on a journey. Albert could not "see one bit of fun in that." He did not
                  express his dissatisfaction; but he comforted himself by expatiating to Betsy on
                  the splendid style in which they had such things got up at home,—how many
                  barbacued pigs they had, stuffed hams and roasted turkeys, to say nothing of
                  cakes, confectionaries, and wines.</p>
               <p>"I'm sure," said Betsy, jealous of the family dignity, "there can't be any nicer
                  cake than that, if I did make it, with Miss Hastings's help, myself; that in the
                  middle of the waiter is made of loaf sugar, and it's as light as a feather, and as
                  white as the driven snow. There never was nicer cake in this world, I guess."</p>
               <p>Betsy pointed to a waiter, which rejoiced in the burden of various kinds of cake,
                  in the centre of which rose one, in the form of a pyramid, covered with a
                  dazzlingly white coat of icing, and crowned with a cluster of white rosebuds. This
                  was Betsy's pride and glory,—the bride-cake, the dream-cake, the cake of all other
                  cakes. She looked at Albert, expecting a burst of admiration.</p>
               <p>"Is that all the cake you're going to have?" he asked, with a supercilious smile.
                  "Why, we give more<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6694-00000089"/> than that to the
                  niggers. We've had more than a dozen cakes baked at once, a heap bigger than
                  that."</p>
               <p>"Well, you must be the extravagantest, wastefullest folks that ever lived, "cried
                  Betsy, her brown face reddening with mortification, "that's all I can say. What's
                  the use, I want to know, of having such a sight of things, when there's no company
                  and people; going right off, too,—after breakfast, besides, when folks have eat
                  all they want to. Let alone," jerking the napkin from his hand. "You needn't help
                  me. You're too smart."</p>
               <p>Albert laughed, excessively amused at Betsy's anger. Having succeeded in
                  impressing her with an exalted idea of his aristocratic mode of living, he
                  condescended to say, that the cake looked very nice, what there was of it.</p>
               <p>"Talk about the black folks at the South having such a dreadful time!" muttered
                  Betsy, half to herself and half to him. "I want to know who has an easier time
                  than this fellow? If I hadn't more to do, I should get so lazy I'd want somebody
                  to laugh for me. I'm ten times more of a slave, this minute, than you are, and
                  have been all my life."</p>
               <p>"That's the truth, Miss Betsy. You'd better come and live with Mars. Russell.
                  'Spose you do."</p>
               <p>"I wish I could go with Miss Euly," she answered, with a sigh; "but there's no use
                  in pining. The Lord knows best."</p>
               <p>Brief, yet solemn, was the marriage rite. The carriage stood at the door, which
                  was to bear them on their first day's journey to meet the railroad, the trunks
                  were strapped on, everything was ready for their departure, before Doctor Ellery
                  pronounced the thrilling words, "that what God had joined together let no man put
                  asunder." Eulalia, in a simple travelling dress, and pale from suppressed emotion,
                  bore little resemblance to the brilliant and magnificently decorated being who had
                  once before clasped Moreland's plighted hand in hers; but the vows she pledged
                  were pure and holy, to be broken only by death—second only to the covenant that
                  bound her to her God. She had taken her real farewell of her own family the night
                  before, and resolved, if possible, to spare her parents the anguish of seeing her
                  weep at parting; but when her minister came, and, taking her trembling hand,
                  blessed her and committed her to the keeping of her Heavenly Father, with so much
                  tenderness and affection and solemnity; borne down by an irresistible, reverential
                  emotion, she knelt before him and bowed her head on his hand. Inexpressibly
                  affected, he bent down, imprinted a kiss on her fair, drooping brow, and left the
                  room.</p>
               <p>Albert, notwithstanding his objections to the marriage, had too chivalrous a sense
                  of politeness, not to seize the fitting moment to come forward and congratulate
                  his master.</p>
               <p>"Albert," said Moreland, "I introduce you to your<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000090"/> new mistress. You will henceforth devote yourself
                  to her service, with all zeal and fidelity, even as you have done to mine."</p>
               <p>Eulalia held out her hand, with a countenance of such angelic sweetness, lifting,
                  at the same time, such a grateful, confiding look to Moreland's face, that
                  Albert's prejudices were quite melted away. He was insensibly won by the divine
                  charm of goodness, exalted by loveliness, and forgot that she was nothing but a
                  poor Yankee girl.</p>
               <p>Dora was so excited and mystified by all around her, so pleased and astonished at
                  being dressed in her best white frock, and having cake to eat so early in the
                  morning, that she looked on in wondering silence. Then, she was to ride with
                  Reuben, in a one-horse carriage, behind the big carriage, as far as the next town,
                  a great event in her young life. She got into the vehicle before the horse was
                  fastened to it, she was so afraid it would start without her. She did not know
                  yet, poor child, what it was to miss such a sister as Eula.</p>
               <p>When Eulalia took leave of her parents, her face was as white as marble, one
                  moment, the next, it was flushed and burning. She found herself in the carriage
                  without knowing how she was placed there—her husband at her side; she felt the
                  motion of the revolving wheels, she saw the sycamore boughs wave towards her, then
                  vanish, the scarlet berries of the mountain ash flash a moment, and then vanish.
                  She realized that the home of her youth was forsaken for the stranger's
                  hearth.</p>
               <p>"Do not hold back your tears, my Eulalia, "said a gentle voice, while the arm
                  which was henceforth to be her shield and support, fondly encircled her. "You have
                  wrestled nobly with your sorrow. But think me not so selfish as to be jealous of a
                  daughter's tenderness, gratitude, and devotion. I feel the sacrifice you are
                  making. Accept in return the consecration of my life."</p>
               <p>The tears thus sanctioned, hallowed by an embrace so tender, by soothings so kind
                  and words so endearing, flowed in a gentle, relieving shower. The tension of her
                  nerves relaxed, the girdle that pressed upon her heart loosened, and the morning
                  twilight of joy stole on the shadows of grief.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p>IT is not our intention to describe with minuteness the journey of our Northern
                  heroine to her Southern home; but some of the impressions of so artless and
                  inexperienced a traveller have a novelty and freshness that cannot fail to inspire
                  interest. She had never seen a car, and when she first saw a train rushing towards
                  the depot, with the iron monster at its head, belching fire and smoke and
                  screeching like a tortured demon, she started as if a fiend from the infernal
                  regions was approaching her. But when she found herself borne along with such
                  supernatural velocity; when she felt herself winged over hill and dale with equal
                  speed; when trees, rocks, and buildings went racing by, at a rate that mocked her
                  credulity, she was exhilarated, excited—she felt the joy of motion. And, though
                  the thundering sound of the machinery drowned the accents she most loved to hear,
                  she was seated at her husband's side—his hand was clasped in hers—his eye ever
                  answered, with assuring love, the timid glance of hers. She now dwelt far less on
                  the memories of the past than the hopes of the future.</p>
               <p>She had never been on board a steamboat. She had never even seen those eagles of
                  the river, with beaks of fire and breath of smoke, skimming the foaming waters.
                  Born in a little inland town, whose winding stream bore no heavier vessel than the
                  school-boy's light canoe, and confined by circumstances to one peculiar spot, it
                  is not strange she knew so little of the world beyond. The first time she entered
                  a boat it was in the night—and it was in the dark night. The river looked of inky
                  blackness, in contrast with the blazing light proceeding from the fiery bowels of
                  the machinery. The black smoke rolled above in long, serpentine convolutions,
                  spangled with glittering red, while the imprisoned steam howled in its iron tubes.
                  As Eulalia walked the narrow plank that bridged the water between the boat and the
                  shore, and which vibrated at every step of her light foot, she clung impulsively
                  to the hand of her husband, and dared not cast her eye down to the cold abyss
                  below.</p>
               <p>"You are but a young traveller," said Moreland, smiling at her childlike
                  apprehensions, "but by and by you will mind it no more than rambling by moonlight
                  on your own green lawn."</p>
               <p>As they stepped upon the deck, there seemed a commotion and a crowd that impeded
                  their progress. A man, bearing a torch, walked by the side of half a dozen<pb
                     n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6694-00000092"/> others, who seemed bending under the
                  weight of a heavy burthen.</p>
               <p>"Move one side," said one of them, "don't you see there's a lady coming?"</p>
               <p>"Who is this?" asked Moreland, seeing that it was the body of a man they were
                  bearing, and moving so as to intercept Eulalia's view of it.</p>
               <p>"It is a negro," answered one, "who fell into the river just now. The mate jumped
                  in and got him out, but I expect the poor fellow is drowned. He is a runaway, and
                  somebody told him his master was behind. In running over the plank his foot
                  slipped, and in he went."</p>
               <p>"He may be resuscitated," exclaimed Moreland. "I once restored a man to life,
                  myself. Carry him on, and I will follow immediately."</p>
               <p>Eulalia, as her husband almost carried her by, caught one glimpse of the face, on
                  which the torchlight threw a strong, red gleam, and recognised the features of the
                  gigantic negro whom her father had once made his guest.</p>
               <p>"Good heavens!" she cried, "it is Nat, The Giant!" (By this name he had announced
                  himself, and the villagers always added the apposition of Nat.)</p>
               <p>Sick and faint, she turned from the dripping form, and leaned on her husband's
                  shoulder for support.</p>
               <p>"I must leave you now," said he, when they reached the ladies' cabin. "If we
                  succeed in resuscitating the poor fellow, I will return and tell you. I grieve for
                  the shock you have received; but let it not, I entreat you, depress your spirits.
                  Retire to your berth, and you will sleep as gently as if rocked in a cradle
                  bed."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, I shall not sleep to-night—but do not think of me. Do what you can for
                  the drowned man. Poor fellow! I am not afraid of him now."</p>
               <p>Eulalia lingered at the door, listening to the music of Moreland's retreating
                  footsteps, for it was music to the dreary blank of her feelings—then entered the
                  cabin with a sinking heart. Could she only have sat up on deck with him, with
                  nothing but the starless night around them, she would have been happy; but she
                  felt so strange, so very strange, so unaccustomed to the scene in which she found
                  herself, she hardly knew what to do. The berths were all occupied but one—an upper
                  one, which the chambermaid directed her to occupy. She did not like to commit
                  herself to this very smart and independent-looking girl; but the idea of mounting
                  so lofty a couch was quite terrific to her. She expected to see some steps or
                  ladder for her accommodation; but she discovered she must do without, unless the
                  angels came down and made her one, as they did in Jacob's dream.</p>
               <p>Most of the passengers were unawakened by the bustle on deck; but one old lady had
                  risen and was seated in a rocking-chair, which seesawed one way, while the boat
                  rocked another, in the strong gust of the<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6694-00000093"
                  /> swelling wind. She presented a very extraordinary figure, and had not Eulalia's
                  mind been saddened by the dreadful accident which had just occurred, she would
                  have found it difficult to suppress her smiles. A loose wrapper enveloped her
                  person, and over this a large blanket shawl was pinned, so that the folds rose
                  above the ears, making her appear as if her head were sinking out of sight. A
                  broad strip of flannel passed over the top of her head and was pinned under her
                  chin. As her face was very pale and long and meagre, this band gave her a most
                  shocking and corpselike appearance. Eulalia, disposed as she was to view
                  everything in its fairest light, thought she saw the Nightmare embodied before
                  her; and not knowing the lady's name, she identified her by that in her mind. She
                  did not like to look at her, though she perceived that she was an object of
                  intense scrutiny herself. Unwilling to retire till she had heard the tidings her
                  husband had promised to bring her, she took a seat at a respectful distance from
                  the formidable lady, and taking off her bonnet, began to arrange her beautiful but
                  somewhat disordered hair.</p>
               <p>"This is going to be a stormy night," said the Nightmare. "There isn't a star to
                  be seen, and the clouds are as black as charcoal. Don't you see how the boat
                  rocks?"</p>
               <p>"Does it rock more than usual?" asked the ignorant Eulalia.</p>
               <p>"Why, can't you tell, yourself?"</p>
               <p>"It is the first time I was ever in a steamboat. I thought they always rocked in
                  this manner."</p>
               <p>"No, indeed. You ain't much of a traveller, then."</p>
               <p>"This is my first journey, madam."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! Where did you start from?"</p>
               <p>"I came from Massachusetts, and"—anticipating the next question—"from the town of
                  ——."</p>
               <p>"How far are you going to travel?"</p>
               <p>"As far as Georgia."</p>
               <p>"Ah! you are going South, are you? Well, I am sorry for you; for a meaner country
                  there never was on the face of the whole earth. Are you going to teach school
                  there?"</p>
               <p>"No, madam."</p>
               <p>"A governess in a private family, perhaps?"</p>
               <p>"No, madam," answered Eulalia, a mischievous smile playing on her lip.</p>
               <p>"You are not travelling alone, are you?"</p>
               <p>"No, madam."</p>
               <p>"You look too young to be married!"</p>
               <p>Eulalia was silent.</p>
               <p>"May I ask what you are going to the South for?"</p>
               <p>"For a home."</p>
               <p>"Ah, poor thing! you are an orphan, I suppose. Take my advice, and try to get a
                  living where you are. They are the proudest folks there that ever lived, and they
                  look upon poor people as no better than white negroes. I lived a year there
                  myself, and know what I<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6694-00000094"/> am saying. I
                  have a daughter married in North Carolina, and I went on to make her a visit. Her
                  husband is not a Southern man himself. He was born in Vermont; but, when he was
                  quite young, he went to the South and taught school. He made a good deal of money
                  that way (it is a good place to make money, there's no denying that),—bought a
                  farm and some negroes, and then came home and married my daughter. They had been
                  engaged three years. Nothing would do, but I must come on and see them, and I was
                  fool enough to go."</p>
               <p>"What did you dislike so much?" asked Eulalia, early impressions crowding on her
                  mind.</p>
               <p>"Oh! everything,—the country, the people, their way of living, their style of
                  building, and, worse than all, the lazy, dirty, good-for-nothing negroes! They did
                  not do as much work in one week as a white servant will accomplish in one day; you
                  have to look after them all the time, and keep everything under lock and key."</p>
               <p>"They were not unkindly treated, then," said Eulalia, "or they would have worked
                  harder, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"They were treated a great deal too well, I think. I went there, expecting to see
                  a great deal of cruelty; but it was not so, excepting now and then I would hear of
                  such a thing, but I never saw it. My son-in-law used to bluster and threaten a
                  great deal, but his threats were never put in execution; and my daughter was a
                  timid, inexperienced thing, ten times more afraid of them than they of her. I
                  tried to set matters right, while I stayed, but they only grew worse. I could not
                  put up with the saucyness of the negroes. They would not call me anything but
                     <emph>old mistress,</emph> and my daughter Miss Lucy, as if she was not a
                  married woman."</p>
               <p>"Did your daughter seem very unhappy?"</p>
               <p>"No! It provoked me to see her so contented, buried in the pine-woods, living in a
                  log cabin, no neighbour within a mile's distance, no visiters, except those who
                  came to stay all day or all night. To be sure, she had everything that was
                  comfortable and plentiful; her husband is very kind, and she thinks there is
                  nobody like him. She even seems attached to the negroes, and says she takes
                  pleasure in providing for their wants."</p>
               <p>"I thought you said she was afraid of them. I should think that would make her
                  very uncomfortable."</p>
               <p>"She will not acknowledge it, though I know she is, by the soft tone in which she
                  always speaks to them. Who is that?"</p>
               <p>A tap at the door made Eulalia spring from her seat, for she was sure it was her
                  husband. And so it was. His thoughtful, serious countenance suggested what his
                  lips confirmed, their efforts were unavailing. Nat the Giant had indeed finished
                  his wanderings, and was destined for a gloomier home than the Dismal Swamp of
                  Virginia.</p>
               <p>"I fear you may be sea-sick," he added; "for the night is very tempestuous. I have
                  told Albert to bring<pb n="186" xml:id="VAC6694-00000095"/> you a glass of brandy,
                  which is said to be a sovereign remedy."</p>
               <p>Eulalia shook her head and smiled; but she, nevertheless, took the glass from
                  Albert's hand, because Moreland had prescribed it, and she would not seem
                  ungrateful for his soothing attentions. She was certain she would not need it
                  herself, but perhaps her friend the Nightmare might, who was listening eagerly
                  behind the half-open door.</p>
               <p>"Who is that gentleman?" asked she, when Eulalia returned into the cabin.</p>
               <p>"My husband, madam."</p>
               <p>"Why, I thought you said you were not married."</p>
               <p>"I did not deny the fact."</p>
               <p>"You did not say anything, which was the same thing. Who was that with him?"</p>
               <p>"Albert, his servant."</p>
               <p>"His slave, you had better say."</p>
               <p>"His slave, then," replied the weary young bride, placing the glass on the table,
                  for the boat rocked so, the dark, amber fluid threatened to overflow.</p>
               <p>"What's that in that tumbler?" continued the persevering inquisitor, though fully
                  aware of its generous contents.</p>
               <p>"A remedy for sea-sickness, my husband says. Are you troubled with it?"</p>
               <p>'Yes, dreadfully! I have been sick ever since the wind began to blow, but I never
                  make any complaint.<pb n="(Illustration) -187" xml:id="VAC6694-00000096"/>

                     <head>EULALIA AND THE NIGHTMARE.—Vol.1, p.187.</head>
                  </figure> That is the reason I left my berth, I thought I should feel better
                  sitting up. Oh! mercy, how the boat pitches, I am as sick as death."</p>
               <p>Her lower jaw fell down so frightfully, her eyes rolling upwards at the same time,
                  that Eulalia was alarmed, and hastened to offer her the brandy. She swallowed a
                  copious draught, which seemed to revive her.</p>
               <p>"I ought to have diluted this with water," said Eulalia. "You must pardon me, I
                  did not think of it. It must have burned your throat very badly."</p>
               <p>"It has more effect that way," answered the old lady; "and I can bear anything
                  better than this awful sickness. Your husband is a thoughtful man."</p>
               <p>Eulalia devoutly hoped the anodyne would compose her new friend to sleep, for her
                  own eyelids began to be heavy from fatigue. While preparing for rest, she cast
                  many a glance at her airy bed, wondering how she was to attain so undesirable an
                  elevation; but the difficulty, like most others, vanished in the act of overcoming
                  it. A light spring was all that was needed, and she looked down in triumph on the
                  flannel-girdled head, sinking in its dark recess. As she lay perfectly still, she
                  supposed the old lady imagined her asleep, for, before she deposited herself in
                  her own berth, she stole to the table and took another portion of the
                     <emph>sovereign remedy.</emph> It was probably caused by a sudden tilt of the
                  boat, but the last drop went down her throat, and an empty glass was left upon the
                  table.</p>
               <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6694-00000097"/>
               <p>"Do you feel worse?" asked Eulalia, thinking her throat must be a chimney, to bear
                  such a fiery draught, and willing to let her know that she observed the
                  appropriation of the fluid.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, a great deal worse. I don't think I could have lived till morning, if it
                  had not been for this medicine. Your husband is a good man—a thoughtful,
                  kind-hearted man. I am grateful for his goodness. Oh! mercy! how my head aches! I
                  have the rheumatism in my head terribly. I must have caught it in North Carolina,
                  for I never had it before I went there."</p>
               <p>The old lady continued to talk, till her voice seemed to mingle with the wail of
                  the night-gust, the murmur of the waters, and the heavy plunging sound of the
                  engine, so monotonous and dreary. Eulalia could not sleep. That large, black,
                  dripping form, with glazed, half-opened eyes, and mouth through which the ghastly
                  ivory gleamed, seemed lying before her, huge, cold, and still. Was it not an evil
                  omen, that it should thus meet her on the very first step of her watery way?
                  Moreland had told her the history of his crimes, but the last victim is the one
                  most deeply pitied. She tried to rid herself of the hideous image that haunted her
                  couch. There it lay—a black, gigantic barrier between her and the fair, flowery
                  land to which her bridegroom's hand was leading her. The excitement of her
                  imagination was owing, in a great measure, to the close, oppressive air of the
                  cabin, which was made still more oppressive by the odour of the burning oil. Could
                  she have seen the waters dashing round the paddle wheels, and roaring behind the
                  boat; could she have seen the trees rustling and bowing in the wind, as they went
                  hurrying and thundering by, the sense of sublimity would have absorbed that of
                  terror; but her inexperience magnified the rushing sound of the river, into the
                  wrath of whitening billows, and the moan of the stormy night-gust into the wail of
                  the wrecking tempest. At length, a mistiness stole over her mind, and it seemed as
                  if she heard low, soft, sweet strains rising on the rising blast, <q>

               <p>The melody, at first indistinct as a mist, condensed into a rich cloud of music,
                  and then came down in a shower of divine words—words such as often ascended from
                  her own household shrine, breathed by her mother's gentle voice and Dora's cherub
                  lips. She fancied she could hear them gliding in that close, stifling cabin,
                  bringing messages of earthly and heavenly love— <q>

               </p>
               <p>"Oh! how sweet! Oh! how comforting!" thought Eulalia. "Bless thee, gentle
                  mother—thou art following in spirit thy wandering daughter. Bless thee too,<pb
                     n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6694-00000098"/> sweet sister-child! I feel thy little
                  arms entwining my neck—thy loving head nestling in my bosom. And, oh! I feel too

                  near to protect and bless me. And God over all—the God of my fathers—the God of my
                  home. Let me sleep when such blessings make a golden guard around me."</p>
               <p>And sweetly, soundly did the young traveller sleep, till the awakening day.</p>
               <p>What a change did the morning sunshine bring! Eulalia, with the elastic feelings
                  of a child, rebounded from despondency to rapture. Leaving all her companions
                  still asleep in their berths, her voluble friend, the old lady, fortunately
                  passive under the influence of the "sovereign remedy"—she stole on deck and joined
                  her husband in a morning promenade, delightful and exhilarating beyond expression.
                  The stormy wind was lulled into a gentle breeze that curled the face of the river
                  into ten thousand dimples, and in every dimple a silver sunbeam sparkled. Not a
                  solitary cloud, not even a white one as large as the wing of a dove, flecked the
                  blue of the heavens. Bright, clear, resplendent they bent their eternal arch
                  above;—bright, trembling, sparkling, they looked up from the sunlit depths below.
                  All the time the boat went gliding onward with a motion graceful and uniform as
                  the bird's, whose pinions were cleaving the azure sky, and the green shores smiled
                  and the tall trees bowed as they passed. Eulalia, leaning on the arm of Moreland,
                  and borne on without any will of her own, through the most enchanting scenery she
                  had ever witnessed, felt the happiest of human beings. The love-light kindled in
                  her eye, and coloured with a brighter tint the pale rose of her cheek. That grand,
                  that beautiful river, how it swelled in comparison with her own native stream, she
                  had once thought so broad and affluent! How the world enlarged upon her vision!
                  How her spirit amplified within her!</p>
               <p>The bell which summoned them to the breakfast table opened upon her a new and less
                  attractive scene. Glancing along the line of strange faces that margined the
                  board, she recognised her old friend, who nodded very familiarly, and pushed
                  forward to a seat nearly opposite. Instead of the swathing band of flannel, she
                  wore a black silk kerchief over her head, the ends of which were fastened under
                  her chin by a large glass breast-pin. The white border of a cap peered from under
                  this gloomy head-gear, and contrasted as strongly with the sallow hue of her
                  complexion as it did with the sable folds that so nearly shrouded it. Near her,
                  but evidently having no connexion with her, was a young and blooming girl, whose
                  bright, ingenuous eyes rested on the bridal pair with such undisguised admiration,
                  they could not but forgive the scrutiny, for the sake of the sentiment which
                  inspired it. Eulalia's heart felt drawn towards her by a congenial charm, and, by
                  the magnetic telegraph which passes from soul to soul, they<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000099"/> understood each other's thoughts and emotions.
                  There was a gentleman on her right, whose thoughts she could also read, and they
                  were not an agreeable study. He had a coarse, vulgar look, self-satisfied and
                  pompous withal; satisfied with himself but at variance with the rest of the world.
                  There were two perpendicular wrinkles between his brows, and the strong lines
                  round his mouth and at the corners of his eyes denoted habitual discontent. He was
                  well dressed, but that air of unmistakeable refinement which marks the gentleman
                  was wanting. In the course of the breakfast, Albert came in, and, standing behind
                  his master, said something to him in a very low, respectful tone. The eyes of the
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bourgeois</foreign> gleamed with a peculiar expression.
                  They fastened upon Moreland, and perused his lineaments with an insatiable stare.
                  They devoured the features and figure of the mulatto, with a kind of malicious
                  curiosity mingled with triumph. Moreland did not notice this rude and prolonged
                  gaze, being engaged in earnest conversation with a gentleman whom he had met in
                  Boston, and whose intelligence, liberality, and courtesy had then made a deep
                  impression on him; but Eulalia did, and she was sure Moreland had an enemy in this
                  scowling stranger, though he knew it not. She wanted to put him on his guard, but
                  sought in vain for the opportunity. The old lady, whose name was Haskell, fastened
                  herself upon her like the old man of the sea, in the cabin, on the deck, wherever
                  she went. She talked to her till her ears grew dizzy with the continuous buzzing.
                  Fortunately the effect of her proximity was somewhat neutralized by the
                  companionship of the bright-eyed, blooming girl, who beautified, with the garlands
                  of her youth, the hoar ruins of age.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Moreland found himself drawn into a vortex which he vainly
                  endeavoured to shun. He disliked coming in collision with the rough and ignorant,
                  and for this reason avoided, as far as was compatible with politeness, his
                  frowning neighbour of the breakfast table. But he would not be avoided; he forced
                  himself into his path, followed him into the social hall, and dragged him into the
                  depths of disputation. Nor was this all. It was only preliminary to a direct
                  personal attack, which the high-spirited Southerner, driven to the defensive,
                  indignantly repelled.</p>
               <p>"Sir," said the man, who bore the name of Horsely, "I believe you are from the
                  South?"</p>
               <p>"I am."</p>
               <p>"There are a great many Southerners travelling North now-a-days."</p>
               <p>Moreland was silent.</p>
               <p>"I should not think they would like coming into this part of the country so well.
                  They must meet with a great many things that are not agreeable to them."</p>
               <p>"They do," was the emphatic reply.</p>
               <p>"I wonder they ever think of bringing their slaves with them. It seems to me
                  downright madness. Sir,<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6694-00000100"/> there are men
                  who think it their duty to enlighten these poor, degraded beings, and let them
                  know what their real condition is. Sir, I am one of that class; I am no hypocrite;
                  I do nothing in the dark. I give you fair warning. I would tell your mulatto to
                  his face, if he were present, that he was a free man,—as free as I am, as free as
                  you are yourself, sir, and that you have no right to hold him in bondage."</p>
               <p>"Tell him so," replied Moreland haughtily. "I am not intimidated by such a threat.
                  He has been told so a hundred times already. He has been told so in the city and
                  the country, in the bar-room and the street,—it has been rung in his ears with
                  trumpet-tongues. He has heard all that you can tell him, yet you may repeat it a
                  thousand times more, if you will. He will not leave me."</p>
               <p>"It seems that all your slaves are not as faithful," replied Horsely, with a
                  sneer. "The poor fellow who was drowned last night, preferred, it would appear,
                  the river's bed to the tender mercies of the master from whose pursuit he was
                  fleeing, and whose approach drove him to desperation."</p>
               <p>"Do you imply that I had any interest in that wretch, beyond what humanity
                  inspires?"</p>
               <p>"A master's interest, as far as that goes. At least, I have been told so."</p>
               <p>Moreland's face reddened, but he preserved his calmness of tone.</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken, sir. I know the master of that man,—a kind, just, humane man.
                  This negro, whose herculean strength was only equalled by his dark, strong
                  passions, was a very dangerous individual. For the robbery and attempted murder of
                  his master, he fled, and has long imposed upon the credulity of the public, by his
                  false, demoniac tales. He, who deserved the hangman's rope, has been exalted to
                  the honours of martyrdom, and all the opprobrium of his crimes transferred to
                  their innocent victim."</p>
               <p>"This may be so," cried Horsely, with an incredulous shrug of the shoulders; "but
                  you cannot deny that many and many a poor fugitive slave has escaped from cruelty
                  and oppression, to our free and sheltering institutions. These are facts that
                  stare you in the face. You cannot shut them out. The eyes of the North are opened
                  to the wrongs of the slave, and as sure as there is a God of justice and mercy,
                  those wrongs will yet be redressed. Why, I have heard stories told by some of
                  these poor starving fugitives myself, that almost turned me to stone. You do not
                  pretend to say they are all lies?"</p>
               <p>"I grant that some of these tales of cruelty are true; for, that man is sometimes
                  a deadly tyrant, the annals of history too darkly prove. But, generally speaking,
                  they are nothing but gross fabrications, invented to enlist the sympathies of
                  credulous fanatics. Why, if we opened our homes and our hearts to all the
                  criminals and<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6694-00000101"/> vagrants of the North; if
                  we enticed them by hopes of gain, and bribed them by promises of reward, our
                  beautiful South would soon become a Botany Bay, and its orange bowers peopled with
                  the vilest convicts. I'll tell you what I saw, not many weeks since, in passing
                  Charles's river bridge—not in the darkness of night, but the blaze of day. There
                  was a rushing sound of trampling feet; a dark cloud of men gathering and hurrying
                  on in the eagerness of pursuit. A fugitive was borne on before that cloud, as if
                  on the wings of a mighty wind. He was a white man. The cry of "murder" rose from
                  the mob and rung over the river. One moment and the fugitive would have been
                  arrested; but he vaulted over the railing, plunged into the water, and was
                  drowned, even like the gigantic felon, the responsibility of whose fate you have
                  been endeavouring to roll on me. Did I condemn the Bostonians as a cruel,
                  bloodthirsty people, because the cry of blood for blood, which rung in the ears of
                  the first murderer, went up in their midst? Did I attribute this crime to their
                  institutions, or to the strength of man's unlicensed passions, which, whether at
                  the North or the South, scatter ruin and death in their path? I heard of worse
                  things than this—of men in the high walks of life, butchered like the beasts of
                  the stall, mangled and cut up and burned, till every trace of the human form was
                  extinct; and I did not impute it to the social system to which they belonged, but
                  to that spirit of man, which, when divorced from God, is given up to the dominion
                  of demons and the powers of darkness. One would suppose, to hear you talk, that
                  the North was one wide garden of the Lord, where nothing but the peaceable fruits
                  of righteousness grow—and the South a howling wilderness of sin and crime and
                  pollution."</p>
               <p>"You draw your own conclusions," said Horsely, knitting his brows with vexation.
                  "I said no such thing. I do say, however, that the North is a peaceable
                  country—the best country in the world. Here, every man attends to his own
                  business—"</p>
               <p>"Pardon me," interrupted Moreland; "there certainly are some exceptions."</p>
               <p>Some of the auditors who had gathered near to listen to the conversation laughed
                  aloud at Horsely's disconcerted and angry countenance. Looking fiercely at the
                  offenders, he withdrew, resolved to whet his weapons for a new conflict. Meeting
                  with Albert, he gave vent to his exasperated feelings, lashing the master over the
                  slave's back. He told him that he was a fool to stay in a state of bondage, when
                  freedom was in his reach; that he had only to claim his birthright, and he would
                  find himself surrounded by a body-guard of friends and supporters. Albert laughed,
                  and said that he was as free as any one whom he saw—that he would not change
                  places with anybody. He had money enough and leisure enough, and the best master
                  that ever lived.</p>
               <p>"Can't catch this boy with chaff, master," said the<pb n="198-199"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000102"/> mulatto, turning on his heel and showing his white
                  and glittering teeth.</p>
               <p>Shall we follow our travellers wave by wave, till the boat is exchanged for the
                  thundering car, the car again for one of the floating palaces of the river? Shall
                  we describe Eulalia's parting with the garrulous old lady and the rose-cheeked
                  maiden, whose faces she never expected to behold again, but which would long
                  remain in the picture-gallery of memory? Or shall we pass over these varying yet
                  monotonous scenes, and arrive at the moment when the planter welcomed his Northern
                  bride to his home in the dew-dropping South? One more scene on a boat, by way of
                  contrast. A night of moonlight gentleness and peace, when drawing nearer and
                  nearer the wished-for haven; the soft, bland atmosphere of a Southern clime
                  smoothed and uncurled the wrinkled surface of the water, as soon as the vessel had
                  ploughed its liquid face. They were on the sea—the deep, deep sea, and though
                  gliding comparatively near the coast, it was invisible to the eye, and the view
                  had all the boundlessness and grandeur of the ocean's midst. Eulalia sat on deck,
                  by her husband's side, with glory above her and glory below, and both the downward
                  and the upward glory were reflected on her soul, making an intense inward glory,
                  which was again reflected resplendently from her face. Gently rocked on the
                  undulating waters, cradled on the arm of Moreland—that arm which seemed to her as
                  the wing of an angel, protecting and sheltering her—bathed in that calm, celestial
                  light, that deep, tranquil, silver ocean, whose horizon was another silver ocean,
                  distinguishable only by a kind of quivering splendour, fanned by a pure and
                  inspiriting breeze, Eulalia approached nearer a state of beatitude than she had
                  ever dreamed of attaining. Oh! to be borne on for ever over those rippling
                  diamonds, thus companioned, soul linked to soul, heart bound to heart—looking up
                  to heaven, seeing nothing but heaven, earth only a memory, something far off and
                  separate—could there be a Paradise more holy and blissful?</p>
               <p>"There is but one thing wanting to complete the magic of the scene," said
                  Moreland, in a low voice, after they had gazed long and silently "on the moonlight
                  flood," "and that is music. Sing one song or hymn, my Eulalia, such as I have
                  heard you sing, where the shadow of the sycamore leaves played upon your
                  brow."</p>
               <p>Eulalia looked up and smiled, while the moisture gathered in her eyes. She was
                  carried back to her native home; she was in the folding of a mother's arms; the
                  fair locks of Dora fluttered against her cheek. She sang one of the sweet and
                  simple songs of her New England village, and her nightingale voice floated over
                  the waters and echoed from the vine-wreathed bluffs by which they were gliding.
                  The passengers left the cabin and drew softly near to listen. The pilot leaned
                  over the green railing to drink in a melody, liquid as the waves over which it
                  flowed. Albert came and stood behind<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6694-00000103"/>
                  hind his master, his bright though dingy face lighted up with a rapturous
                  expression, for the spirit of the negro is tuned to harmony, and is strung with
                  chords which vibrate to the breath of music.</p>
               <p>"Well, I never heard anything that could beat that," cried he, making a long and
                  audible inhalation, after the songstress paused, blushing at the notice she had
                  attracted. "Netty sings mighty sweet, but she can't come up to that, no way she
                  can fix it!"</p>
               <p>"And who is Netty?" asked Eulalia, not insensible to this tribute of admiration,
                  however humble.</p>
               <p>"It's a yellow girl, that waits in the house, mistress," replied Albert, with an
                  air of consciousness, which brought a smile to his master's face. "She goes
                  singing about her work like a bird, and we can all work better to hear her—and
                  she, herself, too."</p>
               <p>"You must know," said Moreland, "that Netty is the object of Albert's especial
                  admiration. To pay her for her singing, he serenades her on the banjo, and
                  sometimes puts in a flourish of the tambourine. I should not wonder if we had a
                  wedding one of these days, and then you will see how finely we get up these things
                  at the South."</p>
               <p>"Now, Mars. Russell," exclaimed Albert, putting his red silk handkerchief to his
                  face, "you know you say what you please. Miss Eulaly see for herself, bimeby."</p>
               <p>"I shall be glad to see Netty and all the servants," said Eulalia, a shade of
                  thought passing over her brow. Then turning to Moreland, she added—"I fear I shall
                  make a poor, inefficient mistress. I shall look to you for instruction and
                  guidance. Though timid and inexperienced, you will find me, I trust, teachable and
                  willing to be instructed."</p>
               <p>Albert, obeying his master's glance, retired, and was soon stretched on the
                  hurricane deck, looking up steadfastly at the moon, and wondering if Netty were
                  not looking at the same object.</p>
               <p>"I have no misgivings for them," answered Moreland; "they will adore you as a
                  mistress, and rejoice under your firm, yet gentle sway. You have every attribute
                  to win their admiration, as well as their love. The negro has an intense
                  appreciation of beauty and grace, and feels the influence of mental superiority. I
                  know you better than you know yourself, my too self-distrusting bride. There is a <choice>
                     <sic>greal</sic>
                     <corr>great</corr>
                  </choice> deal of latent energy reposing under those downy flakes of gentleness,
                  and should occasion require, it will wake and astonish yourself by its power. I
                  fear but one thing."</p>
               <p>"And what is that?" asked Eulalia.</p>
               <p>"Your own repugnance to the African race. You must struggle with this from the
                  first, and it will surely be overcome. It is of unnatural birth—born of prejudice
                  and circumstance. The few specimens you have seen of the negroes have been of the
                  most repulsive kind. It is certainly a strong argument in favour of<pb n="202-203"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000104"/> their condition at the South, that the free negro
                  is generally far more degraded, more low in the scale of being, than the slave.
                  The air of freedom, which gives luxuriant growth to his vices, does not foster his
                  peculiar virtues. His social character degenerates. The philanthropists who
                  interest themselves so much in his destiny at home, leave him to his own resources
                  when brought within the sphere of their assistance. They will not hold social
                  communion with one on whom God has affixed the seal of a darker dispensation. At a
                  distance, they stretch out their arms, and call him brother, and exclaim, 'Are we
                  not the children of the same Father?' but when near, they forget the ties of
                  consanguinity, and stand back with a <emph>holier than thou</emph> written on
                  their brows."</p>
               <p>"My father doth not so," said Eulalia, with earnestness; "he took one of these
                  wandering Parias by the hand, and, making no distinction of colour, treated him as
                  a companion and friend. I tried to imitate his example, for I believed it my duty;
                  but I cannot express the abhorrence I felt, the struggle of principle with
                  inclination."</p>
               <p>"And how was your father's kindness repaid?"</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to say, with insolence and ingratitude. When we ascertained his true
                  character, I was glad to believe that it was an instinctive horror of vice which I
                  felt, instead of a loathing for his kind."</p>
               <p>"My dear Eulalia, God never intended that you and I should live on
                     <emph>equal</emph> terms with the African. He has created a barrier between his
                  race and ours, which no one can pass over without incurring the ban of society.
                  The white woman who marries a negro, makes herself an outcast, a scorn, and a
                  byword. The white man who marries a negress forfeits his position as a gentleman,
                  and is excluded from the social privileges of his brethren. This is the result of
                  an inherent principle of the human breast, entwined, like conscience, with our
                  vitality, and inseparable from it. The most ultra Northern philanthropist dare not
                  contradict this truth. He may advocate amalgamation with his lips, but in his
                  heart, he recoils from it with horror. He would sooner see a son or daughter
                  perish beneath the stroke of the assassin than wedded to the African, whom he
                  professes to look upon as his equal and his friend. Nature has marked a dividing
                  line, as distinct as that which separates the beasts of the field, the birds of
                  the air, and the fishes of the sea. And why should any one wish to violate this
                  great law of nature,—this principle of homogeneousness? The negro feels the
                  attraction of his kind, and forms, like ourselves, congenial ties."</p>
               <p>"But, alas!" exclaimed Eulalia, "how often are those ties broken by the rude hand
                  of violence and oppression. How many heart-strings are bruised and torn by the
                  stroke of the auctioneer's hammer. This is an evil which, kind and feeling as you
                  are, you must deplore."</p>
               <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6694-00000105"/>
               <p>"I do; and it is one which good masters avert, in every possible manner. It is an
                  evil which has never yet approached my plantation or household, and never shall,
                  unless necessity lays its iron hand upon me."</p>
               <p>"Ah! if all masters were like you, slavery would be robbed of its terrors and its
                  gloom."</p>
               <p>"I am no better than the majority, perhaps not as good. I know of some bad
                  masters, and, what is still worse, bad mistresses; but public opinion brands them
                  with its curse. Their character is considered as unnatural and execrable as the
                  cruel and tyrannical parent of the North. There is no such thing as irresponsible
                  power at the South. We are made responsible to man as well as to God, as our
                  tribunals of justice can prove by abundant facts. But, my dear Eulalia, you will
                  soon judge for yourself. You will see the negro, not as he is at the North, an
                  isolated, degraded being, without caste or respectability,—a single black line
                  running through a web of whiteness,—but surrounded with the socialities of life,
                  and, though doomed to labour, yet free from the cares and anxieties that rest so
                  heavily on us. You will compare the reality of their condition with the pictures
                  drawn on your imagination, and make your own commentaries. And now let us change
                  the subject, and think of the household joys that await us; let us talk of the
                  home that is to be gladdened by your presence, and illumined by your love.
                  Eulalia, I feel that I owe you a sacred debt, one that my whole life can never
                  cancel. You have loved me in the face of opposition, prejudice, and reproach. You
                  have given me a virgin's heart, and accepted in return one wounded and betrayed.
                  You have confided in my power to make you happy, though so dark a cloud has rested
                  on my home. You have assumed the cares of maternity, young and inexperienced as
                  you are, under circumstances more painful than death creates. Let me go on,
                  Eulalia, and enumerate your claims on my honour, devotion, and love, for you dream
                  not of their existence, in the lowliness of your self-estimation."</p>
               <p>"No, no—let us talk of your child. You know not how my heart yearns towards it;
                  how I long to fulfil towards it a mother's duties!"</p>
               <p>"I fear," said Moreland, and his eyes flashed up, then darkened, under his
                  suddenly contracted brows,—"I fear you will find a father's as well as a mother's
                  duties devolving on you. Think me not a wretch, Eulalia, but I cannot love my
                  child. Though beautiful as a cherub, I shun its sight, and shrink involuntarily
                  from its innocent caresses. I do not wonder you look at me so reproachfully, but
                  it is in vain to endeavour to conceal what you will so soon discover. It has never
                  lacked for tenderness, however, for my sister loves it as she does her own soul,
                  and its black nurse feels for it more than love—worship and adoration."</p>
               <p>"And you too shall love it," said Eulalia, her face lighted up with the holy
                  expression of the Virgin Mother<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6694-00000106"/> ther.
                  "You shall love it for my sake, if not for its own. I shall make it a condition of
                  my happiness and affection. This little cherub will be to me a younger, lovelier
                  Dora, and I shall still retain my character of sister-mother."</p>
               <p>"I believe you to be the most irresistible," replied Moreland, the dark expression
                  passing from his countenance, and the smile of the bridegroom returning, "as I
                  know you to be the most loveable of human beings. Yes, for your sake I would
                  promise to love the whole universe. I would bind the North as well as the South in
                  one common embrace. You have already been to me an angel of conciliation,
                  softening the bitterness of my feelings when made to drink the wormwood and the
                  gall distilled from the lips of rancorous prejudice. Oh! Eulalia! you and
                  Ildegerte will love one another. You will find in her a dear and noble
                  sister."</p>
               <p>"Ildegerte!" repeated Eulalia, her voice lingering on the name—"that is a
                  Scandinavian name. It has a peculiar sound."</p>
               <p>"There is a noble romance in it, that suits well my sister's high-toned character.
                  My mother found it, I believe, in some Runic legend, associated with the charm of
                  poetry and love. But see, the silver mist curling along the shore. The river
                  breeze wafts it in wreaths around us. I cannot trust you any longer in this
                  moonlight, lovely as it is."</p>
               <p>Eulalia felt as if she were in a different world, when immured once more in the
                  close walls of the cabin; but her thoughts wandered to the world beyond—the Ultima
                  Thule of her hopes and wishes—her beautiful Southern home.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <p>THE residence of Mr. Moreland to which he first bore his Northern bride, was
                  situated in the town of ———, and about two days' journey from his plantation. It
                  was a large and handsome building, stuccoed and painted in imitation of marble,
                  surrounded by a piazza, supported by massy pillars, which were covered with the
                  same artificial porphyry. A wide passage ran through the centre of the house,
                  opening into the garden through doors of green lattice-work, and making a channel
                  through which waves of fresh air were constantly flowing. The yard in front was
                  laid out in terraces, and semicircular hedges of roses and cape jessamines
                  enclosed two airy and vine-mantled summer-houses, on either side of the avenue.
                  Two lofty oaks, whose gray trunks were twined with the dark green ivy, stood as
                  sentinels over these domes of flowers, and gave an air of dignity to the tasteful
                  elegance of the scene. A hedge of cedars, shaven on the top into a kind of
                  table-land, on which the gossamer spread its silvery wed, margined the yard, and
                  relieved by its deep, rich verdure, the white paling that surrounded it. As this
                  dwelling faced the east, the cool evening shadows rested on the piazza, and made
                  it a pleasant gathering place in the after part of the day.</p>
               <p>It might be supposed, that dwelling in a more sultry clime, and warmed by the
                  beams of a more burning sun, the children of a Southern latitude would sink in a
                  lassitude and languor unknown at the North. But it is not so. It is true, during
                  the noonday heat, when the very flowers bow their heads before the intensity of
                  meridian glory, they yield to the pervading influence; but when the heat begins to
                  assume a mellow, golden tint, they come out in the open air, that revels in their
                  ample piazzas or airy verandahs, and their spirits acquire the freshness,
                  elasticity, and buoyancy of the breeze that fans them.</p>
               <p>At such an hour as this, we will introduce the members of the household, over
                  which our Northern bride now presides.</p>
               <p>Do you see that lady, seated by one of the pillars, with the vine-leaves which
                  entwine it, resting like a chaplet on her black and shining hair? Her eyes, of the
                  same colour as her hair, have the softness and richness of satin, though a spark
                  in the centre, of quick, flashing light, shows that there is fire beneath that
                  gentle brilliancy. Her figure is slender and pliant, and her hand, which plays
                  with the green leaves that crown her, is dazzlingly fair. It is Ildegerte, the
                  sister of Moreland; and that very pale, delicate, fair-haired, blue-eyed<pb
                     n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6694-00000108"/> eyed young man, seated near her, is her
                  husband. A more striking contrast in personal appearance could scarcely be
                  presented. She, radiant in blooming health,—he, pallid, drooping, languid, the
                  victim of a constitutional malady. Of Northern birth, Richard Laurens brought to
                  the South the germs of hereditary consumption, too deeply seated to admit of
                  remedy or cure. Since his marriage, they have developed themselves with fatal
                  rapidity, and every one but his young wife reads the doom that is written on his
                  emaciated and altered features. She will not see it. The cough that racks his
                  frame is the result of a cold,—nothing but a cold; his debility, the effect of the
                  summer heat; his variable and fastidious appetite, caused by want of exercise and
                  change of air. There is a well-spring of hope in her heart, inexhaustible as her
                  love, and by both these unfailing fountains the wilting blossoms of her husband's
                  life derive their chief renovation. He is a physician, and has commenced the
                  practice of his profession under the most favourable auspices; but arrested by
                  disease, he is obliged to turn himself to the healing art by which he had hoped to
                  relieve the sufferings of humanity. Poor fellow! it is hard, with such brilliant
                  prospects before him, with so much to endear and enrich life,—such a happy home,
                  and, more than all, such a beautiful and loving wife,—it is hard to think of
                  dying. He will not do it,—<emph>he cannot.</emph> He cannot give up existence with
                  such strong ties to bind him to it. They are cable cords, and cannot be broken. On
                  the morrow, accompanied by his wife, he is to commence a journey to the West. The
                  physician with whom he studied resides in the Queen City of Ohio,—a man as highly
                  distinguished for genius and virtue as professional skill. He is sure of finding
                  restoration with him. Miracles, almost divine, might be expected from his touch.
                  His only regret is, that he has not sought his saving influence sooner.</p>
               <p>You recognise Eulalia. There needs no new description of her peculiar and
                  spiritual loveliness. She looks at home in the midst of the refinements and
                  elegancies which wealth only can command. Her new household dignity sits
                  gracefully upon her. She is already familiar with her duties, and no longer
                  blushes when addressed by the unwonted title of <emph>mistress.</emph> Even the
                  name of <emph>mamma,</emph> lisped by the little fairy frolicking round her, has
                  become a sweet and familiar sound to her ear. You have never seen that
                  three-year-old child—the child of the misguided Claudia. The child whom the
                  injured Moreland did not, could not love; because its mother's spirit flashed from
                  its eyes of gipsy hue and brightness. But Eulalia says it has its father's smile,
                  and that is <q>
                     <l>"All to love and her."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In the infantine face of little Effie, the features of both parents are singularly
                  combined, giving her a twofold and varying expression. Sometimes she looks at<pb
                     n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6694-00000109"/> you with a bold, mischievous, wicked
                  glance, as if she mocked the very thought of restraint; then again, an exquisite
                  softness will steal over her countenance, and a gentle, winning smile beam with
                  hereditary sweetness. She is the spoiled child of indulgence, for Ildegerte never
                  could attempt to discipline the little deserted orphan, and Aunt Kizzie, its black
                  nurse and mammy, would as soon have thought of cutting off her head, as refuse to
                  gratify its most unreasonable wishes. She is an elf, a sprite, a fairy, a cherub,
                  a tricksy, wayward, fascinating little creature, that already gives its young
                  stepmother a world of anxiety. She makes a charming picture, does she not, at this
                  moment? She has been running about the yard, pulling off the most beautiful
                  flowers (for hers are privileged fingers, and if the moon and stars were
                  reachable, they would have been plucked long since for her gratification), and
                  now, with her little white apron full and overflowing with blossoms, she has
                  toiled up the steps and seated herself at the feet of Eulalia, her cheeks glowing
                  with exercise and her jetty hair tossed back from her moistened brow. She stoops
                  down and sticks the flowers in the binding of Eulalia's slippers; she throws them
                  sportively in her face, then, clapping her hands, bursts into wild laughter, and,
                  jumping up, scatters the broken and remnant leaves in a shower on the floor.</p>
               <p>"Oh! Miss Effie! you so bad," cries Aunt Kizzie, waddling up behind her, her ebony
                  face shining like the sun, and her thick African lips flattened in the broad smile
                  that parts them; "you make such a litter you keep a body trotting arter you all
                  day long. It mighty hard work to be picking up trash, tho' it ben't much to speak
                  of."</p>
               <p>Kizzie's audible grunt, as she stoops to gather up the trash, is an emphatic
                  commentary on her words.</p>
               <p>"Never mind, Aunt Kizzie," says Eulalia, "let her amuse herself. Netty can brush
                  away the leaves."</p>
               <p>"Bless your pretty face, mistress," exclaims the nurse, straightening herself with
                  another demonstration. "You's got a heap of consideration. If it wer'n't for the
                  'flammatory rheumatiz that took me last winter, I wouldn't want Netty's help, no
                  manner of way. But praise the Lord, I'm up and living, and able to see arter this
                  blessed child. It never would let nobody do nothing for't but Aunt Kizzie. Would
                  it, honey?"</p>
               <p>Effie crooked her dimpled elbow, and raising it above her head, peeped at Kizzie
                  through the triangular opening with a cunning, mischievous expression, as much as
                  to say—"I make you do just what I please."</p>
               <p>"Here, you Netty," said Kizzie, pointing with an air of authority to the floor,
                  "wait on little missy."</p>
               <p>Netty, a nice, trim-looking mulatto girl, with a yellow handkerchief twisted
                  coquettishly round her crisped yet shining hair, was tripping across the passage,
                  and immediately obeyed the mandate of her sub-mistress; for<pb n="214-215"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000110"/>
                  <emph>nurse</emph> is a person of great dignity, and speaks as one having
                  authority over the other servants.</p>
               <p>"Move, little missy—just a leetle bit," cried Netty, in a pleasant, coaxing voice,
                  taking hold of her gently with her left hand, while she held in her right a large,
                  mottled turkey wing.</p>
               <p>"I won't," said Effie, pouting her red lips, and looking defiantly at the
                  mulatto.</p>
               <p>"Can't you let her be?" said Kizzie, reprovingly. "What need of pestering
                  her?"</p>
               <p>"But Effie, my darling," cried Eulalia, bending down and speaking in a low, gentle
                  voice, "it is very wrong to say 'I won't.' If you do not like to do anything, you
                  must say 'I had rather not.' Will you not repeat it after me?"</p>
               <p>"I won't," exclaimed the child, still more emphatically, peering at her stepmother
                  through her long black lashes, with her elfish, glittering eyes.</p>
               <p>"Do you expect to make that little witch mind you?" exclaimed Ildegerte, bursting
                  into a gay laugh. "I should not think of teaching children obedience before they
                  were five years old."</p>
               <p>"I should never expect it afterwards, if I had not required it before," replied
                  Eulalia gravely. "As soon as a strong will is manifested, the discipline of the
                  temper should commence."</p>
               <p>"One would think, to hear you talk, that you were a grandmother Lois, if they did
                  not look in your youthful face," cried Ildegerte, laughing still more heartily.
                  "But pray make her say 'I had rather not.' It will be the most amusing scene in
                  the world. Here comes brother to witness it."</p>
               <p>Moreland, entering at the back door, came forward in a hunting dress of "Lincoln
                  green," a rifle in his hand, an Indian pouch swinging over his shoulder, from the
                  mouth of which protruded the brown heads of many a partridge, hanging from limber
                  and rumpled necks; a beautiful white pointer, spotted with bright bistre colour,
                  following his steps, with joyous bounds and a countenance sparkling with human
                  intelligence.</p>
               <p>"Down, Fido, down!" he exclaimed, as the dog leaped up and laid one of his
                  quivering paws on his shoulder. "I only allowed you to come in and pay your
                  respects to your mistress. Here, Eulalia, I lay my trophies at your feet."</p>
               <p>"Really, I am very weary," added he, throwing himself carelessly on the upper step
                  and casting his pouch at her feet; "but home seems doubly sweet, after roughing it
                  awhile in the woods. What has given you such a beautiful colour, Eulalia?"</p>
               <p>Eulalia was conscious of a bright glow on her cheeks, in consequence of
                  Ildegerte's playful but satirical remarks. She did not wish them repeated to
                  Moreland, knowing that he, too, believed a child of that age too young to be
                  disciplined into obedience—and that he would naturally express that opinion in the
                  hearing of<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6694-00000111"/> Effie, whose uncommon
                  intelligence took in meanings they imagined above her comprehension.</p>
               <p>"Your wife has been trying to make Effie obey her," said Ildegerte. "Don't you
                  think she has a task before her?"</p>
               <p>Moreland laughed, as Eulalia expected he would.</p>
               <p>"Oh! you must leave all that to Kizzie for the present," said he. "Time enough, by
                  and by, for you to trouble yourself with her waywardness. But, tell me, little
                  despot," he cried to the child, who had been looking earnestly in Eulalia's face
                  the last minute, "what have you been doing, to displease this gentle lady?"</p>
               <p>"I—I—had rather not," cried Effie, a sweet, roguish smile dimpling her round
                  cheeks; "I had rather not."</p>
               <p>"A miracle!" exclaimed Ildegerte, clapping her hands. "Eulalia has triumphed. She
                  must have the gift of magic."</p>
               <p>"The Lord hear her!" cried Aunt Kizzie, who had retired into the background at the
                  coming of her master. "Who'd a thought it, the little, knowing cherrup!"</p>
               <p>While Ildegerte related, with sportive grace, to her brother, the scene we have
                  described, Eulalia lifted the child in her arms, and covered her smiling face with
                  kisses. She was equally astonished and enchanted at her docility, after witnessing
                  so many instances of her waywardness and obstinacy to others. Of all things, she
                  had a horror of a spoiled child—that tyrant of a household, more despotic than
                  Nero, more formidable than an army with banners. That Moreland did not love the
                  indulged and imperious little pet, whom Kizzie declared to be "the living military
                  of its mother," she could not so much wonder; but she wanted to make him love her,
                  to mould her into such moral loveliness that he would be constrained to love her.
                  She hailed this incident as an omen of success, as a proof of her own influence
                  and the child's attraction towards her; and again caressing her, she told her she
                  was a dear, good, sweet child, and every one would love her better than they had
                  done before.</p>
               <p>"I had rather not," whispered Effie in her ear, apparently charmed with her new
                  lesson, and repeating it like a little parrot.</p>
               <p>Moreland watched them both, till the exceeding tenderness he felt for Eulalia
                  diffused itself over the child she thus folded to her young and loving bosom. It
                  seemed to lose its painful resemblance to its mother, and assimilate itself to
                  her, who now filled that mother's forfeited place. He longed to clasp them both in
                  his arms, and tell Eulalia the feelings with which his heart was swelling. He
                  could not help rising and bending over the back of her chair, and saying, in those
                  low tones she had so often heard under the sycamore boughs,</p>
               <p>"Make her like yourself, Eulalia, all that is lovely and good, and I will forget
                  she ever had another mother."</p>
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6694-00000112"/>
               <p>Eulalia bowed her head still lower over Effie's blooming face, to hide the tears
                  that gushed into her eyes. She wondered she had ever thought herself happy before,
                  so full was her content, so deep her gratitude. In the brief moment of silence
                  that followed, she lived an age of thought. She travelled back to New England, and
                  blessed her mother for her inculcations of wisdom and love. She travelled into the
                  future, and saw herself surrounded by blessings that multiplied as she gazed. She
                  looked up into eternity, and prayed that she might be true to the past and worthy
                  of the future.</p>
               <p>"What a sweet, lovely creature she is!" whispered Ildegerte to her husband. "Who
                  would believe that the North gave birth to such an angel?"</p>
               <p>"You forget that I was born at the North," replied her invalid husband, with a
                  languid smile.</p>
               <p>"Poor Richard!" said his wife, passing her hand caressingly over his fair, waving
                  locks, the only youthful beauty which sickness had not dimmed and impaired. "You
                  will be yourself again when Dr. Darley can prescribe for you. To-morrow, Richard,
                  you know we start to-morrow. I wish we had gone long ago."</p>
               <p>"I wish so too, Ildegerte. Heaven grant that it may not be too late. I sometimes
                  think it is selfish in me to take you with me, and expose you to all the
                  inconveniences of travelling with a sick husband,—you, who never knew what care or
                  privation is. But, if I should die, all I pray is, that it may be in your
                  arms."</p>
               <p>"Don't talk so, Richard. You will not die. You will soon be as well as ever. You
                  are so young, and naturally so healthy. Even now, what a fine rosy colour you
                  have! We shall enjoy so much travelling together, and then the West is such a
                  grand, magnificent region! You forget that Crissy is to go with me, the most
                  faithful and attached creature in the world."</p>
               <p>"We are going to a sad place to carry slaves," said Laurens, dejectedly. "They
                  will leave no means untried to lure her from you. What a dreadful situation you
                  would be in, if I should die, and you be left alone among strangers, many of whom
                  are hostile to your best interests."</p>
               <p>"For heaven's sake, don't talk so, Richard. I don't know what is the matter with
                  you to-night. I never saw you so desponding before. Did not brother take Albert
                  with him as far as Massachusetts? was he not beset by abolitionists on every side,
                  and had one the power to shake his loyalty and attachment? I am sure that Crissy
                  loves me, better even than Albert loves his master. She has a husband and
                  children, too, whom she will leave behind, and to whom she will be anxious to
                  return. I should as soon think of doubting your affection as hers, Richard."</p>
               <p>After supper, instead of returning to the piazza as usual, they busied themselves
                  in preparations for the<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6694-00000113"/> morrow.
                  Moreland looked forward to the journey with many hopes and many fears. He had
                  heard so much of Dr. Darley, that, like Laurens, he sometimes thought he had
                  omnipotent skill, and was invested, like the primitive disciples, with the healing
                  touch. Under other circumstances, he would gladly have accompanied his sister; but
                  he could not leave his Northern bride—a stranger in a strange land. Ildegerte did
                  not ask or wish such a sacrifice. She was so full of health and hope and love, she
                  saw no difficulties to deter them, no obstacles to impede the holy pilgrimage for
                  which she was girding herself.</p>
               <p>The trunks were packed, the little medicine chest carefully attended to, and all
                  things placed in the passage, preparatory for the morning journey. Then a feeling
                  of blankness and oppression, succeeding unusual bustle and excitement, settled
                  coldly on the heart of Ildegerte. Her hopefulness seemed suddenly extinguished,
                  and the future looked dark and threatening. All at once, she realized the
                  precarious tenure of her husband's lease of life. If he should die in a land of
                  strangers, what would become of her? Sitting down on her trunk, and leaning her
                  head upon her hand, tears, which gushed before she was aware, rained upon her lap.
                  She could hear his dry, continuous cough through the closed door of her room, and
                  never had it sounded so dismal, so knell-like before. Poor Ildegerte! you should
                  not have seated yourself on that trunk, all locked and strapped and labelled. It
                  is a mournful seat, suggestive of separation, uncertainty, and unknown trials.
                  "Dr. R. Laurens, Cincinnati, Ohio," written in large, black letters on the lid of
                  the other trunk, looks very much like an inscription on a coffin. She tried to
                  turn away from it, but her eyes would be drawn back to the obituary emblem.</p>
               <p>"What is that, Crissy?" she asked, as a negro woman came in, with something dark
                  swinging from her arm, something, whose heavy flapping reminded her of a pall.</p>
               <p>"Nothing but Mars. Richard's cloak, Miss Ilda. I 'fraid he miss it in the morning.
                  Is that all, missus?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. You had better go to bed, so as to wake bright and early. But stop a moment,
                  Crissy. What makes you look so sober? Do you feel badly about going away?"</p>
               <p>"I hates to leave my old man and the little children, just at the last pinch; but
                  I ain't going to make a fuss, no how. You've got trouble enough of your own,
                  missus, let alone being bothered with tother folks."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to take you from your family, Crissy, but we shall not be gone very
                  long; and you know, Mammy will take as good care of your children as if they were
                  her own. But I don't want you to go at all, Crissy, if you are not willing. I can
                  take Netty, who has no husband nor children, and you can do her work in the house,
                  if Mrs. Moreland will consent. I preferred you, because I know what a good, kind
                     nurse<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6694-00000114"/> you are, and you have always
                  been used to waiting on me."</p>
               <p>"Don't talk, Miss Ilda. Don't say nothing. It hurts me mighty bad to hear you talk
                  'bout Netty's going. She ain't fit for nothing but sweep house and ding her
                  fol-de-rols, jist as if we're all ear, no hands, no feet, no nothing. No, no, Miss
                  Ilda, I not gwine to give up to no 'rangement of that sort. I hain't waited on you
                  this long to give my place to nobody—and you sich a 'dulgent missus. You go, I go;
                  Mars. Richard sick, I nuss him; take care of you. Never mind Jim and the children.
                  Leave 'em to Lord Almighty. He knows what's best."</p>
               <p>"But, suppose they try to get you away from me, Crissy, as they did Albert from
                  brother? Can I trust you? Will you promise to be faithful to me, whatever may
                  betide? I cannot say, as brother did to Albert, 'go, if you-will,' for I shall
                  have nobody to depend upon but you."</p>
               <p>Never before had Ildegerte acknowledged her dependence on a menial. She had always
                  been kind and indulgent; but there was a certain loftiness and self-reliance about
                  her that made her seem sufficient in herself for all things. But now, the strange
                  oppression of her feelings made her lowly, and she leaned unconsciously on the
                  sympathy and affection of the negro, whose faithful attachment was coeval with her
                  existence. Crissy had not the young, bright, smart-looking appearance ance of
                  Netty. She had a quiet, subdued air, and a pale, grayish tinge dimmed the
                  blackness of her skin. She was thin, and had a slight cavity in her cheeks, which
                  gave her somewhat of a melancholy cast of countenance. Unlike the negroes in
                  general, she exhibited no fondness for gay colours, preferring drab to scarlet;
                  her greatest finery consisting of a white apron and gold ear-rings. The fine
                  dresses and ornaments which Ildegerte lavished upon her she loved to hoard, and
                  every Sunday she had a grand review of her treasures, which had an hebdomadal
                  increase. The negro is generally prodigal, having no need of forethought or care
                  for the supply of the morrow's wants. If he has money (and he always does have
                  money), he spends it; if fine clothes are given to him, he wears them, certain of
                  a future supply. But Crissy was an exception to the general rule. She did love to
                  hoard, and her chest, always carefully locked, and covered with a spread of white
                  dimity, fringed with tasselled netting, was sacred to her as the ark of the
                  covenant to the children of Israel. Netty—the gay, coquettish, warbling
                  Netty—called her a "stingy old thing," and teased her about her clothes mouldering
                  to pieces, stuck away in a musty chest. She declared everything Crissy wore had a
                  mouldy smell and a moth-eaten look, and that her money was gangrened, it had been
                  put away so long. In consequence of this hoarding propensity, which is always
                  linked with selfishness, Crissy was not a favourite<pb n="224-225"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000115"/> with the other servants; but she was invaluable in
                  the household, for her neatness, industry, and fidelity. She was endeared to
                  Ildegerte by long habit, and her extreme kindness in sickness. She was associated
                  with all the comforts of her childhood and the enjoyments of her youth. She had
                  another quality, remarkable in one of her colour, wakefulness. The negro's sleep
                  is deep and sound as a magnetic slumber. He can sleep anywhere and
                  everywhere,—reclining, sitting, standing, even walking. He can sleep, we verily
                  believe, on the ridgepole of a house, or the apex of a church-dome; but Crissy
                  seemed a stranger to this soporific influence. She was never caught napping or
                  nodding in the daytime, and the lowest sound of Ildegerte's voice awakened her at
                  night. This was probably owing to her unusual prudence and forethought, anxious
                  watchers by the bed of the white man, but strangers to the couch of the
                  African.</p>
               <p>Ildegerte inhaled the inspiration of hope with the morning breeze. Richard had had
                  such a quiet night, such refreshing slumbers, was so brightened and encouraged
                  himself, that she was quite ashamed of the despondency of the preceding evening.
                  They were to travel the first day's journey in their own carriage, Moreland
                  accompanying them on horseback, so it seemed more like an excursion of pleasure
                  than the commencement of a long and weary pilgrimage.</p>
               <p>The travellers were seated in the carriage, Moreland mounted ready to escort them,
                  Eulalia standing by one of the lofty gate-posts, in the shade of a coral
                  honeysuckle, that climbing to its summit tossed its glowing wreaths to the gale,
                  so near him that her hand could play with the horse's shining mane; Kizzie, in all
                  her well-fed rotundity and consequential dignity, on the other side, holding
                  little Effie in her arms, who frisked from shoulder to shoulder, not forgetting an
                  occasional vault to the top of her head, in her wild, elfish pranks; and a row of
                  household negroes, gathered in a body-guard round the carriage. But where was
                  Crissy? Everything was ready but Crissy. A messenger was despatched to hasten her
                  movements, when she appeared with a large bundle on her head, while Jim toiled on
                  after her with a tremendous box on <emph>his</emph> head, so large and heavy it
                  seemed to flatten it on the top into a pancake form.</p>
               <p>"What are you going to do with that box, Jim?" inquired his master.</p>
               <p>"Don't know, massa. It's Crissy's plunder. She tell me to tote it to the
                  carriage."</p>
               <p>"That box! that big, heavy, clumsy thing!" exclaimed Ildegerte, impatiently. "Why,
                  Crissy, you must be crazy, to think we could carry that. It can never go in the
                  world. And here you have kept us waiting half an hour already."</p>
               <p>"I'm obleeged to take my clothes, missus. Hain't got nothing else to put 'em
                  in."</p>
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6694-00000116"/>
               <p>"You might have had that small trunk in my dressing closet. Why didn't you tell me
                  before?" cried Ildegerte, laughing in spite of herself at Crissy's rueful
                  countenance. "Go, this minute, and put what you need in that. Make haste. We ought
                  to have been gone an hour ago."</p>
               <p>"Ain't you 'shamed to entertain your missus in this way?" said Kizzie, removing
                  Effie's foot from her mouth, who was now frolicking all round her head. "Go 'long.
                  What you want to carry them duds to look over every Sunday for? Nobody wants to
                  steal 'em. Hi—smell too musty for me."</p>
               <p>"Come 'long, Jim," said Crissy, giving a jerk to the arm of her obedient Benedick,
                  who went toiling back, receiving as he went innumerable directions about taking
                  care of her property during her absence, and keeping the moths from her woollen
                  things.</p>
               <p>"You had better go in, Eulalia," said Moreland, dismounting, and coming to her
                  side. "You will be weary standing here. This is a specimen of the way our servants
                     <emph>entertain</emph> us, as Aunt Kizzie says. Now, I think, in spite of the
                  dreadful stories they tell of us, we are a marvellously patient people."</p>
               <p>"I think so too," cried Ildegerte, leaning from the carriage-window, and pushing
                  back the thick, shining black tresses that fell over her forehead (for her bonnet
                  lay carelessly in her lap). "Tell me, my dear, sweet Northern sister, do your
                  servants at home take greater liberties than ours? Are your Northern masters and
                  mistresses more enduring than this brother of mine, or his very meek and
                  forbearing sister? Did you not expect to see him spring from his horse and make
                  Jim and Crissy dance a gallopade through the yard to the music of his whip?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed," answered Eulalia, smiling, though blushing at the recollection of
                  what she would have expected a few months ago. "I expected no such thing. Neither
                  did I expect to see you bear the delay with so much grace and good-humour."</p>
               <p>"Russell says I am the most impatient creature in the world; but don't believe
                  him, sweet Eulalia. I want you to think most kindly and lovingly of me while I am
                  gone, and imagine me all that is gentle and lovely and of good report. As you have
                  robbed me of the first place in my brother's heart," she added, smiling through
                  the tears that gathered into her brilliant eyes, "it is no more than just that you
                  should indemnify me, in some way."</p>
               <p>"The place <emph>she</emph> occupies was never given to another," replied
                  Moreland, looking from Ildegerte to Eulalia, with the tenderness of the brother
                  and the love of the husband beaming in his eyes. "It is one set apart, and holy,
                  for an angel's residence."</p>
               <p>"That's the way Richard used to talk," said she, turning to the pale, fair-haired
                  young man at her side; "but he knows now that a woman is a better nurse than<pb
                     n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6694-00000117"/> an angel would be. They can't make
                  jellies and custards as well as we can, though they may be smarter in other
                  respects."</p>
               <p>The reappearance of Jim and Crissy checked the conversation. Jim looked as if he
                  had sadly dwindled with his diminished head-piece, and Crissy, as if she had
                  parted with her last friend, in the capacious box.</p>
               <p>"Good by, Jim," said she, to her anxious spouse, who was drawing his left hand
                  briskly under his nose, while he shook hands with her with his right; "mind what I
                  tell you, and the children too."</p>
               <p>"Now, Crissy, you 'member, you not to run away," cried Jim, in a meek, snivelling
                  voice; "if you do, you 'pent in saccloth and ashes."</p>
               <p>"No danger!" exclaimed Albert, laughing; "she'll be glad enough to come back, you
                  see if she ain't. May be they set her scrubbing too hard," continued Albert,
                  rubbing his elbows and knees, with a comical expression. "Give my respects to
                  Mistress Grimby, Crissy, may be you see her."</p>
               <p>As the carriage-wheels rolled down the green slope which led up to the house,
                  Eulalia's tearful glance followed their evolutions. Alas! how much she feared that
                  those fair locks would lie low beneath the greensward of the West, and the
                  sparkling light of Ildegerte's eyes be quenched in the tears of widowhood. But her
                  last gaze was fixed upon the horseman, who ever and anon turned and bowed his head
                  and kissed his hand in token of farewell. A sudden winding in the road took them
                  from her sight. It was the first time she had been parted from Moreland, and it
                  seemed to her a cloud rested on the landscape. He was to return on the morrow; but
                  what a long, long day was before her! She stood, for a moment, leaning against the
                  gate-post, drawing a wreath of the honeysuckle before her eyes, as a veil to her
                  emotion, thinking of the possibility of her having to endure such a trial as
                  Ildegerte seemed doomed to bear. Could <emph>she</emph> bear it, and live? Could
                  she see the pale shadows of the grave slowly, slowly stealing over that
                  countenance, whose light was now the glory of her soul, as well as the warmth,—the
                  vitality of her heart,—and live? Oh! no. Why does she call up a vision so dark and
                  sad? God in mercy spare her such a blow!</p>
               <p>"You've got a mighty tender heart, missus," said Aunt Kizzie, in the same
                  soothing, affectionate tone in which a mother would address a child. She would
                  speak in a domineering manner to the servants, but her language and manner were
                  gentle as a lamb's to Eulalia and Effie. She adored her master; and, when he
                  introduced his Northern bride to the assembled household, in all her beauty,
                  sweetness, and timidity, distinguishing <emph>her</emph> as a faithful friend of
                  the family and the kind nurse of his child, she was so proud, so happy, so full of
                  admiration and delight, she could scarcely restrain from hugging them both in her
                  ample arms. She had disliked<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6694-00000118"/> liked,
                  nay, even hated Claudia, who had either kept her at a haughty distance, very
                  unusual in a Southern mistress, or tyrannized over her with the most capricious
                  despotism, and whom, with a true perception of character, she believed unworthy of
                  the love of her noble young master.</p>
               <p>"You've got a might tender heart, honey," repeated she, setting down the restless
                  Effie, who, scampering off, lighted like a butterfly among the roses; "the Lord
                  keep it from rough handling. And you've got a good husband, if there ever was one.
                  He's a gentleman, a raal gentleman. 'Tain't no sham, nuther. It's sound, clean
                  through. Black folks knows it as well as white folks. There ain't a nigger a
                  hundred miles round but what'll take off his hat as soon as Mars. Russell come in
                  sight. Bless a Lord for good massa. Bless a Lord for good missus, too. Oh! you get
                  along, Kizzie; you nothing but big baby, no how."</p>
               <p>The tears were fairly dropping down her black shiny cheeks, as she concluded her
                  hosannas, and Eulalia's heart felt drawn towards her with strong and tender
                  chords. The praises of Moreland were music to her ears. How she wished her father
                  could hear them from the lips of the Africans themselves, with all those
                  demonstrations of sensibility which proved their sincerity and truth. How grieved
                  and indignant she felt at the recollection of the injustice and wrong her husband
                  had suffered, in consequence of the prejudices and misconstruction struction he
                  encountered from her father's partisans at the North! How she honoured him for his
                  Christian forbearance; and how deep was her gratitude for the love which,
                  overlooking all this, had chosen her from all others, made her the presiding Queen
                  of his princely home, and was crowning her with daily blessings! Gratitude! who
                  would not smile at the idea of her feeling gratitude for the love of any one? Of
                  her, who was the incarnation of all that is pure and good and lovely in woman? But
                  nothing is so lowly and self-depreciating as true love. In proportion as it exalts
                  another it humbles itself. It places its idol on a throne high as the heavens, and
                  bows, a trembling worshipper, below.</p>
               <p>Eulalia could not help feeling slightly embarrassed at finding herself alone, for
                  the first time, saving the little Effie, with the negro members of the household.
                  It was a mystery to her how they could all find employment in so small a family,
                  yet it was astonishing how much they found to do. There was the cook, who had an
                  under vassal to pick up chips, tote water from the spring, &amp;c.; the washwomen,
                  who had nothing to do but wash and iron and scrub floors; Aunt Kizzie, the nurse
                  and plain seamstress—that is, she cut and made the other negroes' clothes, hemmed
                  tea-towels, sheets, &amp;c.; Netty, the chambermaid and fine seamstress, the maker
                  of her master's shirts and Effie's wardrobe; Albert, the valet de chambre and
                  gentleman at large; the coachman, who was also the gardener; and Jim, who did a
                  little of<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6694-00000119"/> everything and not much of
                  anything, pottering about the grounds, mending a broken paling, sawing off a dried
                  branch, making the kitchen fires, and airing Crissy's clothes. Then, there was
                  Kizzie's mother, an infirm old woman, who had a nice little cabin of her own,
                  where she sat with a white handkerchief pinned under her chin, not much whiter
                  than her wool, knitting or patching, or holding the baby, if there happened to be
                  one in the establishment. She was a kind of <emph>elect lady,</emph> to whom all
                  paid respect and reverence. She was a simple-hearted, pious old soul, who had been
                  favoured with marvellous revelations from the other world, and thus acquired the
                  influence of a prophetess among her people. She had seen three white doves sitting
                  one moonlight night at the head of her old mistress's grave; she had heard a voice
                  from heaven, telling her "that her sins were forgiven;" and once, when she was
                  praying and asked the Lord to give her a token that her prayer was heard, a piece
                  of white paper flew into the window, and rested right on the top of her head. It
                  would have been cruel to have wrested from old Dicey her unquestioning faith in
                  these miracles, it made her so happy. The horse-shoe suspended over her door did
                  no harm to others, and a great deal of fancied good to herself. The vial filled
                  with a decoction of bitter herbs, which was deposited under the threshold, hurt
                  nobody, and was a charm of great power in her estimation. If any one could find
                  any poor, old, infirm woman at the North, happier than Dicey, more kindly treated,
                  more amply provided for, living in a more nicely furnished cabin, and more
                  comfortably clothed, we should like to see them and congratulate them on their
                  favoured destiny. Did you ever see a whiter counterpane than that spread as smooth
                  as glass over Dicey's bed? Look at her pillow-slips, all luxuriating in broad,
                  flaunting ruffles. Sleep must come down in state when such royal accommodations
                  await it. But that counterpane, and those pillow-slips, were not intended for the
                  dark unseeing night. They were taken off when bedtime arrived, and more plebeian
                  ones substituted. There is nothing in which the negress prides herself so much as
                  a nice bed. She saves all the feathers she can get held of, till they form a mass
                  large enough to be diffused with generous thickness over the given surface, and
                  then makes a bed which she is for ever sunning and adorning. It is true they can
                  roll themselves in a blanket and sleep as soundly on the bare floor, but they must
                  have the bed to look at and admire. We have been more particular in describing
                  this little cabin, because an old Aunt Dicey is found in almost every large
                  household establishment at the South. The old family nurse, often the tutelary
                  genius of three generations, the faithful servant, who has devoted the vigour of
                  her youth and the energies of her womanhood to her master's interests, and to his

                  upon them with worshipping tenderness, and<pb n="234-235"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000120"/> dreams that the babes of Paradise are cradled in
                  her dusky arms. Dicey had been the nurse of Moreland's mother, she had been his
                  own nurse, and now in gratitude and affection he drew around the evening twilight
                  of her existence the curtain of repose, that she might wait in quietude and peace
                  the dawning of an eternal morning.</p>
               <p>It may be said that this is a remarkable instance, but it is not so. Cruel indeed
                  is the master or mistress who imposes a hard task on an aged slave, or leaves them
                  to neglect and suffering; and the ban of society rests upon them. We have seen a
                  whole family drowned in tears by the death-bed of a slave: the head of the strong
                  man bowed on his breast in wordless sorrow, while woman's softer soul <q>
                     <l>"in woe dissolved aloud."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We will pause a moment in our story, to relate an incident which occurred when we
                  were a guest of the household, and eye and ear-witness of its truth. Perhaps it
                  may add force to the illustration, if we say that <emph>our hero</emph> belonged
                  to the governor of the state, whose body-servant and coachman he had been for many
                  years.</p>
               <p>It was a bright, clear, winter's morning, when Lem harnessed his master's fine
                  black horses—a span very precious to the governor's heart—to the wagon, and drove
                  them into the woods for a load of pine. In felling a tree, the trunk fell upon his
                  own body and one of the noble horses, which was killed instantaneously by the
                  crash. A young son or nephew of the governor, who was riding about the woods on
                  horseback, witnessed the accident, heard the groans of Lem, who lay mangled and
                  bruised under the gray, old, crushing trunk, and, flying homeward in grief and
                  terror, told the story of his danger and sufferings. His mistress wept
                  unrestrainedly; the children burst forth into audible demonstrations of
                  sorrow.</p>
               <p>"Father!" said the boy who brought the tidings, "it is your best horse that is
                  killed, your blackest and strongest."</p>
               <p>"I don't care," exclaimed the governor, wringing his hands, "if both horses are
                  killed, if poor Lem is spared. Give me that horse directly. Take another, and go
                  after Dr. H. Ride like a streak of lightning, and tell him to meet me in the
                  woods. Wife, have a bed sent to spread in the bottom of the wagon."</p>
               <p>It was a sad and touching scene when Lem was brought home, half-fainting from
                  excessive agony. Yet amidst the sadness one could hardly forbear smiling at the
                  strange manner in which his wife expressed her grief. She was one of the pillars
                  of the African church; but her husband, though faithful, honest, temperate,
                  industrious, and of irreproachable morality, had never made a profession of
                  religion.</p>
               <p>"Oh, marcy! Lord a marcy!" she cried in piteous and bewailing accents; "I wouldn't
                  mind it so much, 'cause the Lord a mighty done it; but Lem is sich a<pb
                     n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6694-00000121"/> sinner, sich an awful sinner. He ain't
                  fit to die. Oh! oh! how awful I'll feel way up in heaven, singing the praises of
                  the kingdom, when I see Lem way down in the great black pit. Lord have marcy, and
                  make him 'pent of his 'niquity."</p>
               <p>"Hush," said the eldest boy, in indignant tones; "if Lem don't get to heaven you
                  won't, nor any of the rest of us."</p>
               <p>"We must have a light elastic mattress," cried the Doctor, "to lay him on. This is
                  too hard."</p>
               <p>"Take mine," exclaimed his mistress; "it is the best in the house."</p>
               <p>Immediately, with her own hands, she bared her bed of its covering, and sent her
                  new, unsoiled mattress to be placed under the negro's bleeding limbs. She sent him
                  two sheets of soft, fine linen, that he might have every appliance that luxury
                  could furnish to soothe his sufferings. His thigh-bone was broken, his limbs
                  mangled and torn, and it was thought he had received some internal injury that
                  might prove fatal. Never have we seen a sick person more carefully, tenderly
                  watched.</p>
               <p>"If I was the Gubenor hisself," said he, tears of gratitude streaming from his
                  eyes, "I couldn't hab no more done for me. I most willing to die, eberybody so
                  good to poor Lem."</p>
               <p>After months of anxious and unwearied care and watching, he recovered the use of
                  his limbs, and then gradually his strength returned; and to the inexpressible ible
                  joy of his better half professed the religion whose influences had long been
                  acting on his heart. In a letter written by his mistress, some time after, she
                  thus affectingly alludes to the death of his wife:—</p>
               <p>"We are all in deep affliction for the loss of Charity, our old and faithfully
                  attached servant and friend. She belonged to my mother, and loved me, and my
                  children after me, as if we were her own children. She was so much beloved by us
                  all, that it seems as if the void made in our household can never be filled. I
                  have been dreading this event, but it is hard to be reconciled to it."</p>
               <p>Why cannot those who speak and write bitter things of the South, record such
                  incidents as these, when they are far, far more frequent than the dark scenes
                  which they seem to take a strange delight in depicting in the blackest, most
                  revolting colours? Why do they pass over everything that is fair and pleasant to
                  the moral sense, and gather every shadow, which, darkening under their touch,
                  rolls into a mass of gloom and horror, oppressive and sickening to the soul? Why
                  are they ready to believe the most awful tales of the abuse of the slave which
                  imagination can conceive and calumny invent, and turn a deaf ear to the history of
                  the master's kindness, humanity, and benevolence? Why, with frantic zeal, do they
                  light the brand of discord, and throw it blazing into the already burning heart of
                  a community, when the stars of the Union may be<pb n="238-239"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000122"/> quenched in the smoking, and the American eagle
                  flap its wings in blood?</p>
               <p>Would it not be well to pause and think of the consequences of all this? Can you
                  sever the interests of the North and the South without lifting a fratricidal hand?
                  Sir, perhaps you have a son, who, finding no outlet for his energies, no field of
                  enterprise in a New England clime, has come an adventurer to the South, and made a
                  fortune from its rich resources. He has married one of its dark-eyed daughters,
                  and the blood of the North and the South mingles in the veins of their children.
                  Woman! it may be that you have a daughter or a sister wedded to one of the sons of
                  the South, whose interests and affections are so closely entwined with his, that
                  the stroke aimed at one must cut the life-chords of the other. Man! you have a
                  friend, the friend and brother of your youth, whom you once loved as your own
                  soul, whose path of life diverging from your own has led him to seek a home
                  beneath a Southern sky. Here he lives prosperous and happy, and the fragrant gale
                  that fans his brow whispers to him sweet memories of his early days, and the
                  friends who then made the sunshine of his life. It whispers to him of you, whom he
                  left on your native granite hills, and his heart throbs over the reminiscences of
                  childhood.</p>
               <p>Sir, if through your instrumentality the fires of insurrection are kindled in the
                  land, and the knife sharpened in the hand of the assassin, the blood of your son
                  may cry to you from the ground; your daughter, clasping her innocent babes to her
                  bosom, may lift her dying eyes to heaven, feeling the conviction, keener than her
                  last death-pang, that a father's hand guided the blow of which she is the victim.
                  Your sister, your brother, your friend may rise up in judgment against you, when
                  their accusing spirits meet yours at the bar of God! Have you not said, have you
                  not written, that it was the duty of the slave to plunge the steel in the bosom of
                  his master, rather than submit the vassal of his will?—that it would be right to
                  roll a fiery wave of insurgency over his sleeping dwelling, and leave only the
                  "blackness of ashes to mark where it stood!"</p>
               <p>England, too, lifts her coroneted brow, and stretches out her jewelled hands over
                  the waters to loosen the fetters of the African, and pour the vials of avenging
                  wrath on the tyrants who enthral him.</p>
               <p>Thou! on whose magnificent empire the sun never casts its setting ray, turn thy
                  glorious eye to the slaves whose life-blood thou art draining at the threshold of
                  thy own doors. See that pale and ghastly and multitudinous band of females
                  imprisoned within close and narrow walls, most of them in the springtime of life;
                  but, oh! what a cold, blighted, barren spring! <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"With fingers weary and worn,</l>

               <p>And it is "<emph>stitch, stitch, stitch,</emph>" from the chill gray morning
                  twilight, to the dim gray evening twilight, and then, by the light of a dripping
                  candle, they "<emph>stitch, stitch, stitch,</emph>" till the long, long midnight
                  hour; nay, more, till one, two, three o'clock of another day, then, crawling into
                  some miserable, crowded, airless hole, lie down to a few feverish, restless,
                  unrefreshing dreams. And so it goes on for weeks, months, and years, till the
                  needle drops from their poor wasted fingers, and they lie in a deeper, colder, but
                  scarcely darker bed. You may say that this mode of existence is voluntary on their
                  part; that they are free, and freedom is sufficient of itself to enrich the most
                  abject and miserable of human beings. It is false. They are not free. Poverty,
                  with a scourge of iron and a scorpion lash, stands behind them and urges on the
                  life-consuming task. Starvation, with grim, skeleton features, and wild, hollow
                  eyes, stares them in the face, and shame and dishonour stand on either side,
                  weaving a winding sheet for their souls. They have no choice left. They must work
                  or starve; work or die; work or sell themselves to the demon of temptation.
                  Freedom! God of the white man, as well as the black, if this is freedom, give us
                  bondage and chains instead. Where, in all the broad lands of the South, is a negro
                  doomed to work for eighteen or twenty hours out of the twenty-four, in silence and
                  hopelessness and anguish that passeth show? Do songs ever gush from those
                  bloodless, pallid lips? Do those weary feet ever spring in the light and joyous
                  dance? Alas! no! The breath of life comes struggling from the weak and wasting
                  lungs, and every step is impeded by the dull, heavy, leaden weight of despair.</p>
               <p>Imperial England! Island-queen of the ocean! There are thousands of these pallid
                  slaves, whose bleeding hearts are bound in iron chains to the chariot wheels of
                  thy wealth and power; whose sufferings the African may well pity, rejoicing in his
                  happier lot. And yet one gem from your royal diadem would scatter plenty mid these
                  starving throngs. Bring forth your <emph>mountain of light,</emph> whose focal
                  splendours illuminated the crystal walls that enclosed a congregated world—bring
                  it forth, fuse it (perchance the chemic miracle may be performed) in the flaming
                  forge of human suffering, and pour it in dazzling streams through the dry, deep
                  channels of poverty and want Bring forth your glittering diamonds, your costly
                  pearls, your jewels and precious stones, for the relief of your famishing vassals,
                  and then talk of philanthropy, and justice, and compassion. In the great day of
                  revelation, when the earth and the ocean shall give up their dead, and the
                  different races of men stand before the judgment bar of God, think you no cry for
                  vengeance on the oppressed will be heard, save from the dusky lips of the African?
                  that no scars of suffering will be seen on any soul but his? Methinks, on that
                  day, when the motives of every act, the spring of every thought will be visible in
                  the full blaze of<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6694-00000124"/> eternity, the
                  judgments of God will be found very different from those of man, and many a spirit
                  on whom the curse of public opinion has fallen with withering power, will be
                  exalted to the right hand of glory, and crowned with immortal honours. There will
                  be many a grateful Lem, whose tears of gratitude have been preserved in the vials
                  of the saints; many a good old Dicey, who will bless the humane master, who made

                     island for many years, and, after a personal investigation of the abolition
                     operations of his own government, says—"I hope and trust you will never be

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>WE break, for the first time, the unity of our story, to follow Ildegerte and her
                  invalid husband to the Western city. We leave Eulalia, for a while, happy beyond
                  the charter of her sex, receiving new and bright impressions, and transmitting
                  them with added brightness to her Northern kindred. There is scarcely a ripple now
                  on the smooth wave on which she is borne,—no cloud on the blue heaven that bends
                  over her, in sunny or in starry love; but, by and by, there may be darkness for
                  brightness, and angry billows for smoothness, and the storm-gale of the North
                  sweep cold and blighting over her Southern bower. Rejoice, in thy happiness, sweet
                  Eulalia! gather up the manna that falls in a honey-shower upon thy path, but
                  forget not to garner a portion for the day when none may fall.</p>
               <p>Richard Laurens appeared to acquire new life and vigour as the distance widened
                  between him and his Southern home, and, just in proportion, the spirits of
                  Ildegerte sparkled and bounded in their original brilliancy liancy and elasticity.
                  Crissy remained taciturn and rather sullen for some time, brooding over the
                  remembrance of the goods and chattels she was compelled to leave behind; but
                  gradually her gloom dispersed before the generous promises of Ildegerte, who
                  pledged herself to reward her a hundredfold for every sacrifice she had required.
                  Everything was novel and therefore exciting to the young and ardent Southerner.
                  She had never before left the boundaries of her native state, having been educated
                  at a Southern college, and she carried the freshness, brightness, and
                  impulsiveness of a child into scenes where she was to learn some of the bitterest
                  experiences of the life of woman.</p>
               <p>When borne upon the Mississippi's deep, majestic stream, margined by such grandeur
                  and luxuriancy, she was filled with the most enthusiastic admiration; and when
                  gliding on the silver bosom of its gentler tributary, Ohio, she was equally
                  enchanted.</p>
               <p>The weather was delightful, having the mild, uniform temperature of departing
                  summer. Everything seemed to favour the travellers, and Ildegerte declared her
                  determination to travel every year in the warm season.</p>
               <p>"Next summer, Richard, we will go to Saratoga and Niagara; the summer after, to
                  Europe. Russell and Eulalia will go too—and what a charming family party we shall
                  make! There is so much to see and admire in the world, it is a shame to stay in
                  one place all the time, looking at the same things."</p>
               <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6694-00000126"/>
               <p>"If I live, Ildegerte."</p>
               <p>"But you are so much better, Richard. You get better every day. Indeed, you are
                  almost well. I <emph>thought</emph> it was only a long protracted cold that had
                  weakened your lungs. I will not hear that cold and doubting <emph>if.</emph> Is he
                  not a thousand times better, Crissy, than when we left home?"</p>
               <p>"I think Mars. Richard does look a heap better than he did. I 'spect he go back
                  right fat and peart."</p>
               <p>Ildegerte and Richard both laughed at his prospective obesity, for in his most
                  robust days he had more of the slender grace of the stripling than the vigorous
                  proportions of the man.</p>
               <p>"There is room for improvement in you too, Crissy," said she, playfully touching
                  the sink-holes in her grayish-black cheeks. "You are something of Pharaoh's lean
                  kine order. I am afraid the people will think we don't use you well. You must tell
                  them you get a plenty to eat and drink—and wear too, if I have doomed you to a
                  small trunk in travelling. You must look smart and bright, Crissy, and put off
                  that <emph>down</emph> way of yours."</p>
               <p>"I wants to see Jim and the children, missus."</p>
               <p>"And the big chest, Crissy. Never mind. You will see them all soon. Don't
                     <emph>I</emph> want to see my brother, and his sweet wife, and that dear little
                  witch of an Effie? And don't I wan't to see old Dicey, and Aunt Kizzie, and all
                  the precious darkies?"</p>
               <p>"You have got <emph>him</emph> by you, you loves best of all, missus. 'Spose he
                  way off—'spose you never see him no more—'spect you wouldn't feel funny, missus,
                  like you do now?"</p>
               <p>"And do you really love Jim so much, Crissy? I had an idea that you thought him
                  inferior to you; that you didn't think him very smart or genteel. I am glad you
                  are such an affectionate wife."</p>
               <p>There was a merry sparkle in Ildegerte's eye, that illumined the meaning of her
                  words.</p>
               <p>"I knows Jim ain't none of the smartest," said Crissy, with a conscious
                  expression; "but he's the willingest creatur and the best conditioned that ever
                  was. It 'pears now like I never sot as much by him as I oughter."</p>
               <p>"We never appreciate the blessings within our reach," said Ildegerte; "but oh!
                  Richard,"—turning to her husband, who was listening to the voice of the dashing
                  wavelets—"when you are restored to perfect health I will always prize the
                  blessing, and be the most contented and grateful of human beings."</p>
               <p>"For your sake, more than my own, I pray for returning health," he replied,
                  gratefully pressing the beautiful white hand that was laid gently on his arm. "I
                  sometimes think I have been very selfish in taking you with me, when you
                     <emph>may</emph> be left alone in a land of strangers. I blame myself, too, for
                  not taking Albert, whom your brother pressed so earnestly upon me; but I<pb
                     n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6694-00000127"/> thought it would be an admission of
                  weakness and helplessness on my part, which I shrunk from acknowledging. It seemed
                  so unnecessary, such a superfluous expense. You will have Crissy, however,
                  whatever may happen, on whose attachment and fidelity you can rely with implicit
                  confidence."</p>
               <p>The white hand was pressed upon his lips, while she called his attention to the
                  flowering vines that hung trailing from tree to tree, and festooned the shore with
                  rich and gaudy wreaths. She would not allow him to give utterance to one gloomy
                  thought, one sad misgiving. If every cloud has a silver lining, that which hung
                  over <emph>them</emph> was fringed by her with a golden edging too.</p>
               <p>As they approached the city to which they were bound, which rose like a Queen
                  above the stream that rolled in majesty at its feet, they gazed with rapture at
                  the beautiful panorama presented to the view. Crowning the gradually ascending
                  shore, Cincinnati looked down in its loftiness, across the severing river, on the
                  green plains of Kentucky, that stretched out before it. Its spires and domes were
                  defined on a misty blue background of swelling hills. These beautiful hills were
                  enriched by cultivation; and many a lordly mansion and elegant cottage seemed
                  climbing their verdant heights, or reigned enthroned on their brows. They arrived
                  at an appropriate hour; for all the pomp of closing day was gathering in the West
                  to gild and beautify its Queen. The blue, misty hills put on a drapery of golden
                  purple; golden arrows, tipped with fire, shot up from the roofs and turrets and
                  fanes; the dark blue river changed to glowing saffron and rippling crimson; and
                  the emerald fields of Kentucky sparkled with the gleam of the topaz. The dark eyes
                  of Ildegerte reflected the radiance, and even the pale blue orbs of Richard were
                  lighted up with their wonted lustre.</p>
               <p>"Beautiful? beautiful!" exclaimed Ildegerte. "Is not this glorious sun-burst an
                  omen of joy, Richard? I hail it as such."</p>
               <p>"And I too, am catching the inspiration of your hopes," cried Richard, a bright
                  colour kindling in his face. "This city of refuge," continued he, quoting the
                  language of Scripture, "let me reach it, and my soul shall live!"</p>
               <p>"Beautiful!" repeated Ildegerte. "Is it not, Crissy?"</p>
               <p>She pitied the lonely Crissy—without any companion of her own colour—and was
                  constantly encouraging her to express her thoughts and feelings to her.</p>
               <p>"La, missus, it goes up like a big corn-hill. Is this where the niggers is all
                  free?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Crissy, but I don't believe one of them is half as well off as you are. Do
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"Don't know, missus; don't know nothing 'bout <emph>them.</emph> I'm mighty well
                  satisfied; got nothing to complain of. Don't see what a body want more."</p>
               <p>Crissy never was demonstrative, like Kizzie. Their manner differed as much as the
                  warm, shining black<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6694-00000128"/> skin of the one,
                  from the cold, grayish darkness of the other.</p>
               <p>"I don't want to see none of 'em, while I stay," she added, after looking up
                  earnestly into the streets of the city, and turning up her nose with an expression
                  of contempt. "I 'spise the free niggers as much as I do poor white folks."</p>
               <p>"But you should not despise poverty, Crissy, nor negroes, either, because they are
                  free. If I die before you, I am going to set you free. Would not you like
                  that?"</p>
               <p>"Don't want to be free, Miss Ilda; heap rather live with you and Mars. Richard.
                  Don't know how to take care of myself, no how. Jim 'most a fool. What'll I do with
                  the children? Lord bless you, missus! don't say nothing more 'bout that. Wish I
                  was at home agin. 'Pears like I been gone a year."</p>
               <p>With such sentiments as these, Crissy followed her mistress to the hotel, which
                  was to be her temporary home, wondering what it was that made people free there
                  more than in any other place. She had heard so much talk about the free States,
                  she expected to see an entirely different aspect of nature. She expected to
                  breathe a different atmosphere, and to see a set of people looking very different
                  from any she had seen before. She glanced from one side to the other, with a vague
                  dread of being pounced upon and carried off, where she would never see her
                  mistress, or Jim, or her hoarded possessions any more. She watched the servants at
                  the hotel very narrowly, and thought they did not look any happier than her
                  fellow-labourers at home, nay, not half as happy, and she was sure they had to
                  work a great deal harder.</p>
               <p>Richard, who had despatched a note to Dr. Darley soon after his arrival, waited
                  his coming with mingled hope and fear. He thought he could ascertain, from one
                  glance of his penetrating and truth-beaming eye, the reality of his condition.
                  When the servant announced that he was below, he turned excessively pale, and sunk
                  back in his chair, trembling with agitation.</p>
               <p>"I will go and meet him," exclaimed Ildegerte, "and bring him here. In the mean
                  time, pray get composed, Richard. He will think you a great deal more sick than
                  you really are, and then you will be discouraged."</p>
               <p>Ildegerte hastened to meet the doctor, in the confidence of finding a friend as
                  well as physician; one on whose kindness and sympathy she could trustingly rely,
                  on whose wisdom she could lean for counsel and guidance, whose skill, she had been
                  led to believe, was almost supernatural. She had strong reasons of her own for
                  wishing to see him first; and, without hesitation or embarrassment, she introduced
                  herself as Mrs. Laurens, the wife of his former student. The doctor rose at her
                  entrance, and, making at first a very deep and rather <choice>
                     <sic>fonnal</sic>
                     <corr>formal</corr>
                  </choice> bow, advanced with extended hand and smiling eye to greet her.</p>
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6694-00000129"/>
               <p>"Is this Dr. Darley?" was Ildegerte's first thought. "I expected to have seen a
                  much older-looking man."</p>
               <p>And this was the expectation of almost every one, who, being familiar with his
                  wide-spread reputation, associated his image with the venerable characteristics of
                  age. He was past the meridian of his days, but youth lingered in the short,
                  crisped curls of his brown hair, undimmed by a single touch of frostiness; youth
                  sparkled in the bright, intense, smiling glance of his grayish eye, and the
                  earnest, animated expression of his whole countenance. Intellect, in all its
                  youthful freshness and vigour, beamed upon his features, and, what to Ildegerte
                  was far more attractive, a generous, noble heart, in all its young warmth of
                  feeling, unchilled by contact with a cold and selfish world, imparted fervour and
                  interest to his whole face.</p>
               <p>The doctor, who had a keen perception and pure love of the beautiful, gazed with
                  affectionate admiration on the young and handsome woman, who seemed to his poetic
                  imagination a rich tropic flower, transplanted to a colder clime. Excitement had
                  given the brilliant bloom of the brunette to her cheeks and lips, and her eyes had
                  that velvet blackness so seldom seen, but so inexpressibly bewitching.</p>
               <p>"Is your husband very ill?" he asked, in a tone which struck her as grave and
                  solemn, in contrast with his smiling eye.</p>
               <p>"No, sir. I think he is convalescent now. He has been much more sick, and all our
                  friends feared that he was in danger of consumption. I believe, now, that his
                  cough is the result of a severe cold. He has such unbounded confidence in you, he
                  feels sure that if he has any serious malady, you can heal it. I wanted to see you
                  first, doctor, to tell you that you cannot judge to-night how he really is. He is
                  weary, excited, and agitated. Do not let him think he is ill. Do not discourage
                  him—he will be so much better to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Is he easily discouraged? is he prone to despondency?" inquired the doctor.</p>
               <p>"No, not much,—that is, not often; but he is not near as hopeful as I am."</p>
               <p>"Are you alone with him? Did no friends accompany you?"</p>
               <p>"No one but a faithful black woman. She is a host in herself. We need no other
                  assistance."</p>
               <p>"This is a very dangerous place to bring a slave," said the doctor. "I wish you
                  had brought a white servant instead. Living, as we do, on the very borders of
                  slavery, our city is the resort of runaway negroes; and, what is still worse,
                  those who are making every effort to swell their number. I advise you to keep your
                  woman as constantly with you as possible."</p>
               <p>"Oh! sir, I have no fears for Crissy. No temptation, I am assured, would induce
                  her to leave us. She is fidelity itself, and is very strongly attached to our
                  family. No, no, I feel very easy on that subject. But<pb n="254-255"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000130"/> Richard, I know, feels very impatient to see you,
                  and will think I am encroaching on his rights."</p>
               <p>Leading the way, with a light step, to the upper apartment, appropriated to them,
                  she ushered in the doctor, watching his countenance, as he addressed her husband,
                  as if her own life depended upon its expression.</p>
               <p>"Why, Laurens," cried he, giving his dry and feverish hand a long and affectionate
                  pressure, "is this the way you commence your professional career? I taught you to
                  heal others, not to be sick yourself."</p>
               <p>"I have come to you for invigoration, doctor," replied the young man, with a
                  languid smile. "I already feel the inspiration of your presence. I feel so much
                  better than I did when I left home, I fear you will think me foolish, to come. Yet
                  I can never regret meeting you again, and feeling once more the kindly pressure of
                  your guiding hand."</p>
               <p>He looked earnestly, thrillingly in his face as he spoke, while the fever-spot
                  burned brightly on his own. The hand which had pressed his so affectionately, now
                  lingered on his wrist, and he knew that its quick pulsations were being counted
                  with professional accuracy. Agitated by this consciousness, he began to cough. It
                  was a short, dry, hacking cough. It always made Ildegerte gasp for breath, and
                  press her hand on her heart, when she heard it. It was an involuntary motion, but
                  her heart literally ached, and she could not help pressing it. Yet she would not
                  acknowledge that it was an alarming cough,—it was only an obstinate one, and so
                  she told the doctor. As he suffered the pale hand which he had been holding to
                  slide gently from his, she caught his quick and quickly receding glance. It seemed
                  to her that the bright, merry spark that burned there, was quenched in moisture.
                  There was an expression of unutterable sympathy, compassion, and tenderness,
                  transient as lightning, but as intense too. Ildegerte, who stood a little behind
                  Richard's chair, turned pale, and cold and sick. She felt as if his death-warrant
                  had been pronounced, and that hope had indeed bidden the world farewell.</p>
               <p>"Come," said the doctor, in a cheerful tone, "what you need to-night is rest. Your
                  nerves are excited. Your pulse quickened at my touch like a love-sick girl's. We
                  must cultivate more composure. Recline on this sofa and put yourself perfectly at
                  ease, while I make myself acquainted with Mrs. Laurens."</p>
               <p>Ildegerte's freezing veins thawed in the kindly warmth of his manner. She must
                  have mistaken his glance. How foolish, how childish she was! What a baby he would
                  think her! She would show herself more worthy of his respect! She soon found that
                  no effort was necessary to feel interested in the conversation he commenced with
                  her, while Richard, obedient to his counsel, assumed a recumbent position, and was
                  soon folded in tranquil slumbers. There was something so fresh, so<pb n="256-257"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000131"/> sparkling, so original in his ideas, it seemed as
                  if every word he uttered was sprinkled with morning dew. There was a vein of
                  poetry and romance, too, pervading his mind, like golden ore imbedded in the solid
                  rock. He told her something of his own early history; of the death of his wife,
                  whom he had lost in the bloom and beauty of her womanhood; of his belief in the
                  constancy, the eternity of love; that it was only its germ that was planted on
                  earth; that it was reserved for the gales of Paradise to fan it into blossom.</p>
               <p>"I do not feel separated from my wife," he said, his countenance kindling into
                  rapturous emotion. "She is still associated with all my hopes and my joys. I never
                  read the works of genius and sensibility without feeling the participation of her
                  sympathy. I never listen to the sweet strains of music without being conscious of
                  the presence of her listening spirit. So positive to me is this intimate and
                  divine communion, that I should no more think of wedding another than if she were
                  living and breathing at my side. I am called an enthusiast. Perhaps I am one; but
                  I would not relinquish this abiding, inextinguishable sense of her continuing
                  love, for all else the world can offer. Death does not really divorce us from the
                  object of our affection. It only destroys the material tie—the spiritual, the
                  immortal still remains."</p>
               <p>"But it takes from us the form we love," said Ildegerte, shivering; "it lays it in
                  the cold grave. Everything thing else seems so shadowy, so unreal. For my part, I
                  would have no wish to survive the friend I loved best on earth. One coffin, one
                  grave, would be my soul's prayer."</p>
               <p>"We should pray rather for faith to sustain, for patience to endure, and for
                  submission and resignation. The silver chords which bind earthly hearts together
                  must be broken. If they writhe and struggle under the loosening hand, they may
                  bleed and suffer in every vein and fibre, but they will nevertheless be torn
                  asunder. It is better to lie still and be gently parted."</p>
               <p>"<emph>We</emph> are not to be parted, are we?" asked she, in a very low voice,
                  impelled by an irresistible impulse, as her eye rested on the reclining figure of
                  Richard, who lay with one cheek supported by his hand and his fair locks partly
                  shading the other. There was a boyish grace in his attitude, which combined with
                  the hectic bloom of his complexion to throw the illusion of health around him.</p>
               <p>"God alone can answer that question," he answered, with gentle solemnity. "The
                  issues of life and death are with Him. I trust, my dear young lady, you have
                  learned to look to him as a Father, as well as a God."</p>
               <p>Ildegerte bowed her head, but the tears she could not suppress glittered in the
                  lamplight. Yes! he was preparing her—she knew it, she felt it—for the coming blow.
                  Once more her elastic spirits sunk, and a cold shadow flitted over her.</p>
               <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6694-00000132"/>
               <p>"You will come early in the morning, doctor," she said, when he rose to take
                  leave, "will you not?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly; 'Richard will be himself' then, I hope."</p>
               <p>Strange, what magic there may be in a few little words! This old, old
                  quotation,—she had heard it repeated a hundred times, and yet how reviving it
                  sounded! Poor Ildegerte!—to what an alternation of hope and fear was she doomed,
                  as day followed day, without fulfilling her constant, unwearied prophecy, "He will
                  be better to-morrow." As for him, he had read his doom in Dr. Darley's undeceiving
                  eye. He knew that he must die; and, with that pliancy with which the finite will
                  bows to the Infinite, when the inevitable fiat is gone forth, he yielded, without
                  a murmur. But he could not tell Ildegerte the terrible truth,—he could not rend
                  all hope from her bosom. Often and often, had Dr. Darley resolved to inform her of
                  the hopelessness of his condition; but she had a strange, elusive power that
                  baffled his intentions. Since the first night, when the question "<emph>We</emph>
                  are not to be parted?" was forced irresistibly from her lips, she had never asked
                  him his opinion of his patient; and when he began to express it, unasked, she
                  would turn the conversation at once into a different channel, find an excuse for
                  leaving the room, or for being occupied with something present.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Crissy was forming new acquaintances and acquiring new ideas.
                  Ildegerte had her meals brought to her own room, and saw nothing of the other
                  boarders; while Crissy ate hers in the kitchen with the servants, and as she was a
                  stranger, and a slave, she was an object of peculiar attention to them. By
                  attention, we do not mean respect, but observation, curiosity. They evidently
                  thought her far beneath them in position; and Crissy as evidently demeaned herself
                  as a being of superior order. If they turned up their noses at her, she turned up
                  hers at them, till there was a kind of nasal warfare between them. There was one
                  free black woman, who occupied the place of an underling, whose freedom consisted
                  in doing the greatest part of the drudgery of the kitchen, and in the privilege of
                  being called "a good-for-nothing nigger" by the
                     <emph>high-life-below-stairs</emph> Irish gentry. Her name was Judy, an
                  unpardonable offence to one of the Irish women, whose name was also Judy, and who
                  henceforth denominated herself Julia. Judy must have had a lower extraction than
                  Crissy, for she did not express herself with half the elegance, saying "dis and
                  dat," and "gwine," and "high and ki," and all those phrases which characterize the
                  corn-field negro. Crissy pretended she had never heard such gibberish, and the
                  Irish brogue, which was much less familiar to her ears, she pronounced a horrible
                  jargon. There were three distinct classes in the kitchen. The Irish and German
                  servants constituted one class; Judy, the free negress, a second: and Crissy, the
                  slave, a third. So<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6694-00000133"/> many incongruous
                  elements could not fail at times to produce a discord, particularly as the first
                  class were constantly changing their forms,—the black-haired cook of one day being
                  a red-haired one the next. That is, there was a constant ebbing and flowing in the
                  white population. For the slightest cause of dissatisfaction they would relinquish
                  their office, leaving the vacancy to be supplied by other servants till another
                  supplied the place. As it was a large establishment, they were frequently obliged
                  to employ raw, unpractised hands, whose ignorance was the cause of blunders
                  equally provoking and amusing.</p>
               <p>One day one of the <emph>raw material</emph> was cooking her first dinner. She had
                  recommended herself as a "suparior cook," who understood all the mysteries of the
                  culinary department, but Crissy watched her movements with contemptuous
                  wonder.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you pluck out them are pin feathers?" cried Crissy, "and you ain't
                  going to put 'em in the oven with their legs sprawling and kicking every which
                  way!"</p>
               <p>"I'm going to do just as I plase, you impertinent cratur," answered indignant
                  Erin. "I should like you to show me a pin in the feathers. And don't the legs look
                  gracefuller loose, than tethered like a slave, as you ba yourself?"</p>
               <p>With that, she gave the oven a tremendous ding, right in the midst of a blazing
                  fire, hot as that in which Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were cast, where the
                  devoted twins scorched and blackened and shrivelled, till they appeared the most
                  wretched, spindle-shanked pair that ever were seen side by side.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you drudge and baste them chickens?" exclaimed Crissy, quite
                  scandalized at her ignorance and self-conceit. "Who ever seen potry done dry
                  afore, and burnt all to cinders besides?"</p>
               <p>"Do you call me a drudge and a baste, you mane, black, woolly-headed thing?" cried
                  cook, her face in as great a blaze as the fire; "say it again, and I'll bate you
                  across the back with this poker. What are you but a slave, I want to know? Can't
                  you demane yourself better to your supariors?"</p>
               <p>"I don't see as I'm more a slave than the rest on ye," said Crissy, shrugging her
                  shoulders till they touched the tip of her ears. "You all have to work a heap
                  harder than I do, and don't get much thanks, nuther."</p>
               <p>"But we get wages for our work, and I'd like you to show me the blessed copper you
                  ever got for yourn."</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't touch a copper, leave 'em to poor folks," said Crissy. "I got a heap
                  of money at home—all in silver,—more than you'll ever lay by, I 'spect. We don't
                  have no coppers where we come from. We 'spises em."</p>
               <p>"A hape of silver! Och! I'd like to spake to it,<pb n="262-263"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000134"/> and ask who it belonged to. And you've got any
                  number of silks and satins, hav'n't you?"</p>
               <p>"I've got more fine dresses than you know how to count—or any other buckra. I
                  don't wear 'em tho', 'cept 'mong quality folks."</p>
               <p>"Oh! you spake up for the quality, do you? Won't the craturs lie still?"</p>
               <p>She was trying to compose the burnt and sprawling limbs of the chicken on an
                  elliptical dish, but their feet would kick up in the air, in the second and fifth
                  position.</p>
               <p>"I never saw such an unaven dish," she muttered. "I like to have the convaniences
                  where I cook. What you got in this stewpan?"</p>
               <p>"It's Mars. Richard's broth. He won't taste of a drop but what I makes for
                  him."</p>
               <p>"Mars. Richard! Och! before I'd call a man or woman my master, I'd ate my tongue
                  betwane my teeth."</p>
               <p>Just then an exclamation of horror was heard behind them, so sudden and piercing
                  that Erin jumped at least two feet in the air, in her consternation and affright.
                  The mistress of the hotel, finding the dinner hour arrived, without the warning
                  bell, had entered the premises, and, beholding the specimens of cookery
                  surrounding the fire, a shriek of astonishment burst forth from her lips.</p>
               <p>"Is that your cooking?" she cried, pointing to the fire.</p>
               <p>"To be shure it's mine."</p>
               <p>"Didn't you tell me that you understood all kinds of cooking, that you were an
                  experienced, first-rate hand?"</p>
               <p>"Well, indade, ain't I exparienced, I should like to know?" said Erin, flaring up
                  like a candle in the wind. "May I be spacheless if I didn't cook for Miss Wallis a
                  wake and sixteen days over. And didn't she tell me to roast the bafe brown and
                  crisp?" pointing to a stately sirloin, covered with a dry, black crust, that
                  looked more like a chunk of charcoal wood than meat.</p>
               <p>"And here's my dinner spoiled—not one thing fit to eat, and the boarders pouring
                  in as fast as they can! It is enough to provoke a saint. If there was such a thing
                  as keeping a steady cook—but as soon as one has a good one, they take a miff at
                  nothing at all, and off they go. I have had three different cooks in the last
                  three weeks, and I shall have another to-morrow! Take your things and march, miss;
                  and never let me see your face again in this part of the world. Cook, indeed! Why
                  I should think you had just taken a shovel of coals and dashed over the
                  dishes."</p>
               <p>The lady was not a scolding lady, but certainly her patience was put to a severe
                  test. Erin was not the only one who had spoiled a dinner, and made the most awful
                  and ridiculous mistakes. An incident which had occurred a few weeks before, rose
                  fresh in her memory.</p>
               <p>A girl, whom she had hired to wait in the dining-room, and who professed to be
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au fait</foreign> in her line, was told to put
                  seasoning in the castors.</p>
               <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6694-00000135"/>
               <p>"What sasoning, if you plase, ma'am?"</p>
               <p>"Why, pepper, and vinegar, and mustard, and catsup, to be sure."</p>
               <p>The girl did not know what castors were, but, ashamed of her ignorance, she would
                  not acknowledge it. But hearing some one tell the servant, who was rolling a table
                  back against the wall, not to let the castors catch in the carpet, indicating the
                  little brass wheels with his index, she exulted in having acquired the desired
                  information without exposing herself to ridicule, though what good in the world
                     <hi rend="i"/>sasoning would do to them, she could not tell. Nevertheless,
                  faithful to her instructions, she got down on her knees under the table, and
                  plastered them with mustard, sprinkled them with pepper, and bathed them with
                  vinegar. Not knowing what was meant by catsup, she ventured to omit that
                  ingredient, much to the benefit of the carpet, already saturated with vinegar.
                  These occasional misfortunes were caused by the necessity of employing emigrants,
                  fresh from some mud-walled cabin or chimneyless roof. They may serve as sources of
                  amusement in the retrospect, but in the moment of endurance require a Spartan
                  spirit to bear.</p>
               <p>"I wonder what that is, if it ain't having a missus," thought Crissy, as Erin,
                  gathering up bundle, bonnet, and shawl, marched towards the door with the air of
                  one who owned the whole establishment. "She needn't brag over me, the Lord
                  knows."</p>
               <p>"You'd better take <emph>her</emph> for a cook," exclaimed Erin, in a scornful
                  tone, as she closed the door. "Interfaring with me all the time, and nothing but a
                  born slave."</p>
               <p>"Do you know how to cook, girl?" asked the lady, when the wrathful figure of the
                  Irish woman disappeared.</p>
               <p>"I b'lieve I does, missus; tho' it ain't my rig'lar business."</p>
               <p>"I have a great mind to hire you and try you for a while."</p>
               <p>"La, missus! I couldn't hire my time to nobody. I belongs to Miss Ilda, and
                  couldn't leave her no way."</p>
               <p>"That's all nonsense," replied the lady. "You are as free as she is, if you only
                  knew it. She has no more right to your services than I have, and you are a fool to
                  work for nothing, when you might be getting good wages. I would not stay with her
                  another day if I was in your place."</p>
               <p>"When Mars. Richard so sick and she feel so bad, way off from all her kinfolk! Oh!
                  missus, I couldn't do that. Somethin' <emph>here</emph> keep me from it. She bin
                  mighty good to me, and it would be ugly to turn my back on her, when she in
                  trouble. 'Sides, I don't see freedom what it's cracked up to be. It does mighty
                  well for rich folks: but poor, working folks can't be free any way. Long as I got
                  to work I'll work for my own master and missus, 'cause they cares for me."</p>
               <p>"Poor, foolish, ignorant creature!" said the lady, in a tone of mingled compassion
                  and contempt. "Look<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6694-00000136"/> at Judy here—how
                  much better off she is. She has all she earns, and does what she pleases with
                  it."</p>
               <p>"I'd a heap ruther be in my place than Judy's," said Crissy, looking down at her
                  own neat, genteel apparel, and then casting a furtive glance at Judy's coarse and
                  slovenly dress. "If I don't get reg'lar wages, I gets everything I needs without
                  the 'sponsibility. I'm willing to help you when I've time, missus, for nothing,
                  but don't say nothing more 'bout my leaving Miss Ilda, for I ain't a going do
                  it."</p>
               <p>That night after supper, when the servants had a respite from their labours, Judy
                  was sitting on the threshold of the back kitchen door, her elbows resting on her
                  knees, and her head resting on her hands.</p>
               <p>"Let me go by," said Crissy. "You needn't get up, only don't spread yourself out
                  like a fodder stack."</p>
               <p>"You jist sit down, one minnit, Crissy, and let me say someting ben on my mind dis
                  long time. 'Spose you ask your massa to buy me?" She uttered this in a low voice
                  in Crissy's ear, who had seated herself at her request, pressing her clothes close
                  to herself, to avoid the contact of Judy's soiled garments.</p>
               <p>"You!" cried Crissy in astonishment; "I thought you free!"</p>
               <p>"So I be—dat is, dey call me so; but dat don't make me so. I run way from old
                  massa, 'cause he treat me bad. He live way over de river, in old Kentuck. I
                  thought if I got among free folks I'd be de fine lady, equal to de white folks;
                  but I'm noting but a nigger, arter all—noting but poor Judy. That ain't my name
                  tho'. They call me Judy for short, but the Lord named me Julia. What o' dat?—no
                  matter. You got good massa and missus—wish <emph>I</emph> had—den I'd have
                  somebody to take care of me. Don't know how to take care of myself—folks 'pose on
                  me. White folks call us niggers brudders and sisters way off; but when dey close
                  to us dey find out we noting but niggers. Please ask your massa to buy me, and say
                  noting 'bout it."</p>
               <p>"He's no use for you; he's got plenty now," said Crissy; "and Mars. Russell don't

               <p>"I wouldn't talk 'bout myself in that way," said Crissy, whose personal pride was
                  quite wounded by the association; "all the coloured people ain't black. I ain't
                  black myself."</p>
               <p>"I'd heap sooner see 'em black, dan gray or yellow. It's more 'spectable. La sus!

                  Saturday work. Bless a Lord! I rest some to-morrow."</p>
               <p>All that occurred in the kitchen department only made Crissy more contented with
                  her own lot, and rather confirmed than shook her fidelity and loyalty. But she was
                  assailed by a more dangerous influence, which, gradually winding round her, found
                  where she was most vulnerable, and fastened on the weak spot.</p>
               <p>There was a gentleman and lady boarding at the hotel, bearing the somewhat
                  peculiar name of Softly. Their appearance and manner corresponded so well with
                  their name, it seemed to have been made on purpose for them. Mrs. Softly had the
                  softest voice in the world, and the softest step. She seemed shod with velvet,
                  like a cat, and stole along the passages, leaving no echo of her footfalls, giving
                  no warning of her approach. She had very light hair, and very light eyes, almost
                  white, with no perceptible eyebrows or eyelashes, and having altogether a most
                  crude and unfinished look. Her husband was the softened image of herself, having,
                  if possible, still lighter hair and eyes,—and, if possible, still more indefinite
                  brows. Like her, he had a soft, doughy, sodden appearance; and they both dressed
                  with Quaker-like precision and neatness. Mrs. Softly had called on Ildegerte, and
                  Ildegerte had returned the call; but she did not seek to conceal the feeling of
                  repulsion she experienced in her presence. She was too impulsive for policy, too
                  careless of the opinion of others, to affect an interest which she did not feel.
                  Her coldness and indifference probably gave offence to Mrs. Softly, for she
                  discontinued her visits, and spoke of her as very proud and haughty.</p>
               <p>Crissy had to pass her room in going up and down stairs. The door was often left
                  open, and Mrs. Softly generally had a soft, pleasant word for Crissy, and
                  sometimes she asked her to come in and take a seat. Crissy was not insensible to
                  this kindness and attention, and thought her one of the nicest and best ladies she
                  had ever seen. Mr. Softly, too, always reflected his wife's courtesies, and talked
                  to Crissy in a condescending, patronizing way, that was quite irresistible. By and
                  by, it seemed to be a matter of course to drop in as she<pb n="270-271"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000138"/> passed, and before she knew it she had related
                  everything concerning the family of Moreland, going back to the first generation.
                  Sometimes she heard them talking about her, for their soft voices would glide into
                  the passage in a marvellous manner.</p>
               <p>"Poor thing!" Mrs. Softly would say, "how I pity her! How melancholy and subdued
                  she looks! No spirit left in her. How hollow her cheeks are! Such a nice,
                  lady-like person, too!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," responded Mr. Softly, "if she were only free, what a respectable member of
                  society she would make! We must exert our influence upon her, and not suffer her
                  to remain in bondage and degradation."</p>
               <p>At first Crissy resisted with respectful firmness all the arguments which her new
                  friends urged upon her understanding; but there was one temptation held out, which
                  became gradually stronger and stronger. She could make a great fortune, all her
                  own. She could do it in a hundred ways, with her smartness and industry. Then she
                  could buy her husband and children, and they could all live together in a fine
                  house, and hold up their heads as high as anybody. Moreover, she was living in sin
                  and shame and misery and degradation, and when the means of deliverance were held
                  out to her she would never be forgiven by the Almighty if she refused to accept
                  them.</p>
               <p>Crissy's weak point was a love of money—a love of gain. It was on this the
                  incision was made, which reached at length to the heart's core. The fine house,
                  fine furniture, and fine ladyism loomed up in her imagination, like the spires and
                  domes of a distant city. She began to think that if she had been happy and
                  contented before, it was only because she didn't know any better. She began to
                  think that she had been abused without knowing it, and that her master and
                  mistress, whom she had been silly enough to believe kind and liberal, were cruel
                  and tyrannical, and the worst enemies she had in the world.</p>
               <p>"If Massa Richard wan't sick," she said, "I wouldn't mind it."</p>
               <p>"Can't she hire as many servants and nurses as she likes?" asked Mrs. Softly. "Is
                  not she rich and independent? She can fill your place in a moment; but you, if you
                  let this opportunity slip, will never have another."</p>
               <p>"Never," echoed Mr. Softly.</p>
               <p>"But where shall I go?" exclaimed Crissy, bewildered and agitated, as the crisis
                  of her destiny approached.</p>
               <p>"We will direct you. Leave everything to us. There is a nice place, where you can
                  conceal yourself a while, and where you will be treated like a lady, not a
                  slave."</p>
               <p>Thus beset, day after day, poor Crissy grew weak and impotent, till she became a
                  passive tool in their soft, insinuating hands. She stayed now as little time as
                  possible in the room of her mistress, whose confiding trust in her fidelity and
                  attachment was a dagger to her<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6694-00000139"/>
                  faithless and alienated heart. Ildegerte unconsciously favoured the designs of her
                  enemies, by allowing her to be away from her more than she had been accustomed to
                  be. Dr. Darley, who was a real philanthropist, conversed a great deal on the
                  sectional difficulties of the country, and she thought it best that Crissy should
                  not hear all that was said. He was pained and distressed by the fierce and bitter
                  feelings, the fiery fanaticism, the frantic zeal, which, reckless of all
                  consequences, was spreading through the land. His far-reaching mind beheld the
                  inevitable consequences of these, and he lifted up his voice in public as well as
                  private, endeavouring to arrest the burning tide of prejudice and intolerance. His
                  piercing intellect, and large, generous heart, took in the whole, instead of a
                  part of the social system, the interests and rights of the white race as well as
                  the black. He believed that both would be injured and destroyed by coercive
                  measures, unsanctioned by law, and unauthorized, above all things, by the great
                  golden law written on the tablet of every human heart.</p>

               <p>"AND must he die?" she exclaimed, clasping her hands passionately together, and
                  looking wildly upward. "Oh! Dr. Darley, must he die? Is there, indeed, no
                  hope?"</p>
               <p>"Has no voice told you this before?" asked he, in grave and solemn tenderness.
                  "Has not its whisper come to you lately with every rising sun? have you not heard
                  it as you watched its setting beam? He asked me to tell you, but you knew it all
                  before."</p>
               <p>"I feared, doctor, but still I hoped. Take not hope away from me, or my heart will
                  break. Why did he bring me here, if you cannot save him? Why have you stopped the
                  remedies from which we hoped so much?"</p>
               <p>She spoke wildly, and knew not that her language was upbraiding.</p>
               <p>"Because all medicines are unavailing," he replied, with gentleness; "we can only
                  smooth his passage to the grave. The arm of an archangel could not snatch him from
                  it now, how much less my bounded skill, or<pb n="274-275"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000140"/> your human love! My dear Mrs. Laurens," added he,
                  unclasping her clenched hands, and pressing them kindly in his own, "by the great
                  love you bear him,—by your belief in the sovereignty of God,—and by your faith in
                  a crucified Redeemer, I entreat you to submit, with meekness and resignation, to a
                  doom common to all the sons and daughters of Adam. Wrestle not, in impatient
                  despair, with the mighty hand of God! I pity you, from my soul, I pity you; but
                  what can I do for him or you that has not been done already?"</p>
               <p>"You have been kind, more than kind—heaven bless you for all your goodness! but
                  oh, doctor, it is so hard—you do not know what it is!"</p>
               <p>"I know what it is to see the flower of one's life languish and fade away, leaving
                  nothing but a waste and howling wilderness. I know what it is to watch the
                  glimmering spark one would gladly feed with their own vitality, go out, leaving
                  nothing but the blackness of darkness. I have travelled the same thorny path you
                  are now treading, with bleeding feet and sinking frame. <emph>I know what it
                     is.</emph> I found no hope, no comfort, no support, but in God. Neither will
                     <emph>you.</emph> There is but one refuge from the life-storms which, sooner or
                  later, sweep over every human heart, and that is, the cleft Rock of Ages."</p>
               <p>The wild despair of Ildegerte's countenance yielded to a softer expression, as the
                  Christian physician thus solemnly and affectionately addressed her. Bending her
                  head till the loosened darkness of her hair wove itself into a veil for her sorrow
                  and her tears, she wept and sobbed like a gentle, heart-broken child. The doctor
                  did not attempt to check these gushing tears; he knew they would have a relieving
                  influence. He was going away from the city, to be absent days, perhaps weeks, on
                  professional business that could not be deferred. He regretted this circumstance,
                  for though his skill in this instance was impotent to save, his sympathy and
                  friendship were powerful to sustain.</p>
               <p>"You are going to leave us, doctor," she said, as, with slow steps, they turned
                  towards the chamber of the invalid, "and we have no friend but you."</p>
               <p>"You are wrong there. You are surrounded by friends whose kind offices would be
                  proffered the moment you required them. Then your black woman is the best nurse in
                  the world. You must not forget her."</p>
               <p>"Poor Crissy! yes, I am ungrateful. She is a faithful friend, who never will
                  forsake me. What could I do without her? But, oh! Richard—"</p>
               <p>Another burst of grief; another struggle for composure; a mighty effort to keep
                  back the welling waters, and to roll the stone against the door of the fountain.
                  Poor Ildegerte! she thought her cup of bitterness was brimming; but there was
                  another drop of gall to be infused into it, of which she little dreamed.</p>
               <p>That night, after the doctor had bidden them farewell, with a cheerful voice, but
                  moistened and averted eye,<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6694-00000141"/> promising to
                  return at the earliest possible moment. Ildegerte sat in silence by her husband's
                  couch, on which the pale and solemn moonlight fell in silvery glory. There was no
                  other light in the room, the lamp having been removed to the <choice>
                     <sic>passsage</sic>
                     <corr>passage</corr>
                  </choice>; and it seemed as if every lunar beam clustered round that pale and
                  fading form, leaving the remainder of the apartment in deep shadow. As the light
                  of life grew dim in Richard's eye, he loved more and more the benignant and holy
                  lustre of the moon. He would have his couch wheeled to the window, through which
                  it looked in all its calm and heavenly beauty, and there he would lie in silence,
                  gazing upward into the deep, deep dome, where that glorious chandelier was hung.
                  His lungs were so weak, his breath came so quick and short, and then that terrible
                  racking cough, ready to seize him on the slightest exertion, that he seldom talked
                  now. He was gentle, quiet, patient, and childlike, repaying every tender care with
                  a glance of unutterable gratitude and love. "Dear, dear Ildegerte!" he would
                  say,—then followed the upward, prayful look, and she knew he was commending her to
                  the mercy of Him in whose presence he was shortly to be.</p>
               <p>The deep silence of the hour was interrupted by the entrance of Crissy, who came
                  in softly and stood beside her mistress. She stood silently gazing on her master's
                  pallid and illuminated face,—on the burning flame-spot on either cheek,—on the
                  paly gold locks that fell lifelessly lessly on the pillow,—till something rose
                  swelling and choking in her throat, and she turned to her mistress as if to avoid
                  a sight too harrowing. But Ildegerte's dark, melancholy eyes met hers with such a
                  wistful, desolate expression,—her face looked so pale and sorrowful, with her
                  black hair all loose and dishevelled, making such a thick, mournful drapery,—she
                  could not bear to see it. The choking in her throat grew worse.</p>
               <p>"Is Mars. Richard worse to-night?" she at length asked.</p>
               <p>Ildegerte shook her head, she could not speak. Richard did seem better, more quiet
                  and composed than he had for many nights.</p>
               <p>"I'll go out a little while, if missus don't want me just now," said the negro,
                  trying to clear her swelling throat.</p>
               <p>Ildegerte merely bowed her head in token of assent, then making a painful effort,
                  for a dull lethargy was succeeding her late stormy emotions, she said,—</p>
               <p>"Don't stay long, Crissy. What makes you look at me so hard, Crissy?—how strange
                  you look! What is the matter?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, missus; I was just thinking of you and Mars. Richard."</p>
               <p>Richard held out his feeble hand, as Crissy turned to the door, and taking her
                  dusky palm in his, said, in a low, husky voice,</p>
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6694-00000142"/>
               <p>"God bless you, Crissy! be faithful to her when I am gone."</p>
               <p>"God bless you, Mars. Richard!—oh! master, God bless you and missus too!" cried
                  Crissy, bursting into a passion of tears, and sinking on her knees by the couch.
                  "Oh! master, I poor, sinful creatur; pray forgive poor Crissy!"</p>
               <p>"Don't, Crissy, don't!" said Ildegerte, trying to raise her from the ground, where
                  she lay actually writhing. "You hurt him; you'll make him cough. Pray go,
                  quick!"</p>
               <p>Crissy partly raised herself, but not before she had kissed again and again the
                  hem of Ildegerte's dress, and then she kissed the white hand extended to lift her,
                  and wet it with her tears.</p>
               <p>"Oh! Miss Ilda, God bless you and make master well! I feel like I could die for
                  you and Mars. Richard."</p>
               <p>Overcome by her own feelings and Crissy's impassioned sympathy, the more affecting
                  for being in contrast with her usual calmness, Ildegerte threw her arms round her
                  dark neck, and weeping on her bosom, exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, Crissy! Crissy! I shall soon have no friend left but you. You will never
                  forsake me,—no, no!" she repeated, "you will never forsake me!"</p>
               <p>"I can't stand that, missis!—oh, Lord! I can't breathe! I 'most dead! I wish I was
                  dead,—I wish I dead this minnit!"</p>
               <p>"Go, Crissy!" said a faint voice from the couch. "I would sleep, if it were
                  quiet."</p>
               <p>Crissy gave a quick, spasmodic spring, and vanished. Tossing her hands above her
                  head, and flying through the long passage, she rushed into Mrs. Softly's room,
                  more like a maniac than a sane person.</p>
               <p>"I can't go to-night. I can't never go. I can't leave Miss Ilda. I can't leave
                  master, I love 'em too much. I'll die fust. Wish I could die this minnit."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Softly looked at Mr. Softly and Mr. Softly looked at Mrs. Softly as if they
                  were in extremity, straining their white invisible eyebrows as they looked.</p>
               <p>This was the night selected for Crissy's exodus. They had arranged everything
                  themselves, very nicely and carefully. She was not to have any trouble in the
                  world. Mr. Softly was to take her to a particular friend of his, whose house,
                  situated about ten miles below the city, near the banks of the river, was a kind
                  of negro caravansary. He was to take her in a boat, and they were to have a
                  charming sail in the depths of the moonlight night. She was to remain there
                  awhile, till the excitement of her flight was over, and then return to the city
                  and commence making the fortune that was to elevate her so high in the scale of
                  being. And after all these preparations, so benevolent and disinterested on the
                  part of her new friends, the weak, foolish, ungrateful<pb n="280-281"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000143"/> creature comes weeping and wringing her hands,
                  declaring she will die rather than leave her master and mistress!</p>
               <p>It is no wonder that they were astonished and indignant, that they upbraided her
                  for her perfidy and ingratitude, that they placed before her in the strongest
                  colours, the enormity of her offences, and the consequences of her transgressions.
                  It is no wonder that the poor bewildered creature again yielded herself to their
                  influence, and promised to be guided passively by their will.</p>
               <p>Why did this man and woman, who had enrolled themselves under the banner whose
                  angel-inscribed motto is "peace and good will to <emph>all</emph> men," thus
                  labour and travail to rend asunder the bonds of affection and gratitude which
                  united this faithful heart to the master and mistress she so fondly loved? They
                  saw her contented, perfectly unconscious that servitude was a burden, without one
                  wish to exchange situations with the hirelings, who had the liberty of going from
                  place to place and serving many masters instead of one. Why were they not willing
                  to leave her so? What had that sad young wife done to them, that they thus toiled
                  to deprive her of her chief comfort and stay in the night-time of her sorrow and
                  despair? Had they no compassion for that pale, patient, gentle, dying stranger,
                  that they thus stole from him his attendant and nurse, at the very moment ment
                  when the death-dew is falling beneath the silver moon?</p>
               <p>What motive, we ask, in the name of all that is kind, and Christian, and holy,
                  could have actuated them in the present instance? What, but the carrying out of a
                  fixed, inflexible purpose, at any cost, at any sacrifice; the triumph of an
                  indomitable will; the gratification of prejudice and intolerance? No matter what
                  flowers are in the pathway, trample them down, though they be sweet as the
                  blossoms of Paradise. You have marked out your course, and must not turn to the
                  right or to the left. No matter if hearts lie palpitating and bleeding below, let
                  the chariot wheels roll on, crushing and mangling them. You have mounted your
                  car—you have sworn to rush on, with a sword in one hand and a torch in the other;
                  and, though blood and flame may gurgle and crackle around you, your purpose must
                  be accomplished, your mission fulfilled.</p>
               <p>That night the midnight moon looked down on the bosom of the Ohio, as a small
                  batteau glided swiftly over its glittering surface. A stout black man sat at one
                  end, propelling it over the water; a white man occupied the centre, folded
                  carefully in a cloak, for the river-damp might be dangerous at such an hour; while
                  a negro woman crouched at the other end, with her head bowed on her knees, and
                  dull and heavy in her ears was the sound of the dipping oar. She had no outer
                  covering to shield her from the night-damps,—her guardian<pb n="282-283"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000144"/> and protector had not thought of that; why should
                  he? and, in her trepidation, remorse, and anguish, she had forgotten to wrap her
                  shawl round her. After a while, she lifted her head and looked about her, with a
                  wild, frightened countenance. She looked at the banks, with their dark fringe-work
                  of swaying boughs, and shuddered,—it seemed so like the sweeping of Ildegerte's
                  long black hair. She looked down into the river,—the deep, rippling, shining
                  river,—and looking right up to her, through the quivering brightness; she could
                  see her master's large, languishing blue eyes, and his long fair hair curling in
                  the water. She looked up, and right over her head, distinctly seen in the
                  dark-blue of the sky, she could still see those languishing eyes fixed mournfully
                  and reproachfully on her.</p>
               <p>She heard voices, too, calling to her from the dark places on shore. Sometimes it
                  was the voice of Jim, saying, "Crissy, Crissy, I told you neber to run away.
                  You'll neber see poor Jim no more!" Sometimes they were the voices of little
                  children, crying, "Mammy, mammy, ain't you neber coming agin?" She could see their
                  little black faces and woolly heads peeping at her through the thick, rustling
                  foliage. Sometimes she saw something long and whitish in the distance,—it was the
                  large wooden chest, the ark of her wealth, the garner of her gifts and treasures;
                  and then, all at once, they all vanished, and she could see nothing but the figure
                  seated directly in front,—stiff and perpendicular, with its cold, doughy,
                  indefinite face, and lank white hair. Splash went the oar!—on went the boat!—more
                  and more chill blew the river breeze! Where were they bearing her to? She did not
                  know. What was she going to do? She did not know. She only knew that she had left
                  all she loved behind, and that a cold, dark, uncertain future was before her.</p>
               <p>The midnight moon looked down on another scene. Ah, midnight is a solemn and
                  mysterious hour! It was at midnight that the destroying angel flapped its raven
                  wings over the Assyrian camp, and the dead lay in thousands beneath its folds. It
                  was at midnight that the same commissioned angel passed over the thresholds of
                  Egypt, and slew the first-born of Pharaoh that sat upon the throne, and the
                  first-born of the maid-servant that was behind the mill. It is the hour when the
                  cry of new-born life is oftenest heard in the household,—when the wail over the
                  dying is borne on the still and dewy air.</p>
               <p>Ildegerte sat by the couch of her husband, who, soon after the departure of
                  Crissy, had fallen into a deep and tranquil sleep. She watched for a while his
                  unusually gentle breathing, then, exhausted by weeping, her own eyes closed, and
                  she too slept, with her head reclining on the arm of her chair and one hand
                  clasping Richard's. She had seen nothing in the unwonted agitation of Crissy but
                  deep sympathy and affection, and the last feeling of which she was conscious
                  before falling asleep was gratitude for the possession of this humble and<pb
                     n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6694-00000145"/> faithful friend. She was awakened, she
                  scarcely knew how, but starting from her chair she uttered a piercing shriek.
                  Richard's head was slightly raised on his left hand. There was a gurgling sound in
                  his throat, and a red stream flowing from his mouth on the pillow, the sheet, and
                  her own white dress. The moon was still shining, though it was higher in the
                  heavens and did not gleam directly on the couch. She could see it all though—the
                  drooping head, the flowing blood, the white, white face, where the hectic fine was
                  all extinguished; and in agony and terror that baffles description she looked
                  wildly round for Crissy—for Crissy at that moment gliding away on the shining
                  river. She flew to the door and shrieked her name;—no answer. Her own voice echoed
                  mournfully in the winding passage.</p>
               <p>"Oh! Richard!" she cried, coming back and throwing herself on her knees by his
                  side, "speak to me, look at me, tell me that you will not die and leave me here
                  alone!"</p>
               <p>He opened his eyes and gave her <emph>such a look</emph>—but he spoke not, and the
                  red stream still kept flowing on, till the folds of her dress were all dabbled and
                  stained.</p>
               <p>"Oh! God!" she cried, "he <emph>is</emph> dying, and I am alone! What shall I do!
                  Oh! brother, brother, would to God you were near! I <emph>must</emph> find
                  somebody! He must not perish so!"</p>
               <p>The wire which communicated with the bell in her room was broken, so that she
                  could not ring it. The only way was to go for help herself, and leave him
                  bleeding, dying there. Rushing through the passage, she knocked vehemently at Mrs.
                  Softly's door, under which a light was glimmering, and opened it without waiting
                  for admission. The lady had not retired to bed, having sacrificed sleep on the
                  altar of benevolence and mercy. She was just about to say her prayers, with a
                  feeling of unusual self-complacency, when the loud knocking came thunderingly to
                  her door, it was burst open, and Ildegerte stood before her, pale as a corpse, her
                  black hair sweeping wildly back from her brow, and her white dress crimsoned with
                  blood.</p>
               <p>"Mercy! mercy!" screamed Mrs. Softly, recoiling as from an avenging spirit, and
                  spreading both hands before her face.</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, come and help me!" cried Ildegerte, seizing her frantically by
                  the arm and dragging her towards the door. "Richard is dying—bleeding to death! I
                  can't find Crissy! Have you seen her? Do you know where she is? I must have her
                  with me! I can't do without her! Dr. Darley is gone! I am all alone! Oh! my God!
                  is there nobody to help him?"</p>
               <p>Thus wildly ejaculating, she kept her hold on the frightened, shrinking woman,
                  dragging her along with her into the room where Richard lay, all ghastly in his
                  blood.</p>
               <p>Ildegerte snatched up the lamp from the passage floor and held it over the couch.
                  As she held it, her<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6694-00000146"/> trembling hand grew
                  steady, as if clenched with iron fingers. She realized at once that she was in the
                  presence of that mighty power whose coming she had so long dreaded, and a sudden,
                  instantaneous, awful calmness settled on the wild tossings of her soul. She felt
                  as one might, who, borne on the rushing wings of a whirlwind to the mountain top,
                  looks down upon a waveless, boundless sea of glass. Her spirit was preternaturally
                  illuminated; and, above the darkness and stillness and fearfulness, there appeared
                  to her a glory like the body of heaven in its clearness.</p>
               <p>"Richard! Richard!" she cried, stretching her arms upwards as if he were already
                  ascending. "The Lord is coming. He is coming to bear thee away."</p>
               <p>The eyes which she had thought for ever closed, opened for one moment and looked
                  steadfastly upon her. Through the glaze and mistiness of death, a ray of heavenly
                  joy and love flashed, quivered, and was gone. Every nerve of Ildegerte's frame
                  thrilled, as if unsheathed, beneath that last intense, burning ray of life. Her
                  own soul seemed leaving her body and mingling with his.</p>
               <p>"Yes," she said faintly, "oh, yes!" and falling forward, she lay as cold and
                  insensible as the form her failing arms vainly attempted to enfold.</p>
               <p>When consciousness returned, the whole scene was changed. She was in another room,
                  lying on a strange bed, and faces that looked strange and dim were looking at her
                  through the curtains. There was a strong odour of camphor and hartshorn, and when
                  she put up her hand to shade back the hair from her brow, she found it heavy and
                  wet.</p>
               <p>"Oh! it is blood!" she murmurred. "I remember it now."</p>
               <p>Rising on her elbow, she sent her glance piercingly round the room, in search of
                  an object which she could not find.</p>
               <p>"What have you done with him?" she shrieked, trying to spring from the bed. "I
                  will not be separated from him! Take me back—Crissy will take me! Where is she?
                  Why does she stay away so long?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Softly, in whose bed she was laid, shrunk from the keen questioning of those
                  wild, dark eyes. More than once during the night had her self-complacency been
                  disturbed; and Ildegerte's imploring cry for Crissy sounded like anything but
                  music in her ears.</p>
               <p>"What have you done with Crissy?" repeated Ildegerte, with delirious earnestness.
                  "Tell me, have you sent her away?"</p>
               <p>"Mercy on me!" cried Mrs. Softly, with a kind of hysterical spasm. "What have I to
                  do with Crissy? How should I know? I am sure I am not her mistress."</p>
               <p>Ildegerte lay still a moment, then suddenly exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Where is Mr. Softly? Is he gone too?"</p>
               <p>This abrupt and startling question entirely destroyed<pb n="288-289"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000147"/> the equilibrium of Mrs. Softly. Blushing and
                  stammering, her fringeless eyes, incapable of hiding themselves, rolled from side
                  to side as if in search of escape. Her embarrassment and evasion, the strange
                  absence of Crissy, the absence of Mr. Softly, also, a thousand little
                  circumstances, unnoticed before, but rising up with vividness and distinctness
                  now, all told the story of desertion and wrong. Husband, servant, friend—all
                  taken, and she left desolate and alone. Were God and man leagued against her? Gone
                  was the supernatural illumination; gone the glory-vision that gilded the solemn
                  death-hour. Gone, too, the crushing sense that followed the brief apocalypse of
                  being under the awful pressure of God's almighty hand. It was man with whom she
                  had now to contend—man in his littleness and spite, and all the scorn and
                  indignation of her soul flashed up and mingled with the fast-kindling fires of
                  delirium that gleamed in her eyes.</p>
               <p>"<emph>You, you</emph> have done me this foul wrong!" she cried; "and may God
                  avenge me in his own good time! When Richard and I stand with you before the
                  judgment-seat of Christ, oh! may He remember the bitter anguish of this hour!"</p>
               <p>Another fainting fit followed this paroxysm of agony, and thus the night waned
                  away. The morning star—one of that glorious company that sang for joy at the birth
                  of creation—shone in between the parted curtains, through which the moonbeams
                  lately stole. But its voice of music was now hushed. It looked in sadness on a
                  cold, still, shrouded form, with folded arms and moveless feet, and divinely
                  placid brow. The lips, from which the life-stream was so lately flowing, were
                  composed with an angelic smile, and all the charm and tenderness of youth, which
                  disease and suffering had impaired and partially obliterated, were restored to the
                  calm, reposing features.</p>
               <p>Shine on, thou beauteous star! type of the bright and morning star, that rose upon
                  a sin-darkened world. Star of the manger!—star of the cross! shine upon the
                  night-shades of sorrow and death, and usher in the day-spring from on high!</p>
               <p>Ildegerte lay for weeks on a sick-bed. Though her own nurse had been decoyed from
                  her, she did not want for kindness and sympathy. Dr. Darley, who had returned,
                  took her under his parental care, and every one lavished upon her the tenderest
                  attention. Mr. and Mrs. Softly had left the house, suddenly discovering a
                  deficiency in their accommodations which they had not noticed before,—and every
                  one seemed rejoiced at their departure.</p>
               <p>As no proof existed, but the coincident absence of Mr. Softly, that he or his wife
                  had any agency in the flight of Crissy, nothing could be done to convict them.
                  Indeed, the circumstance of negroes being bribed to leave their masters, was too
                  common to excite more than a passing remark.</p>
               <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6694-00000148"/>
               <p>Ildegerte, on whose bruised and wounded heart the gentle courtesies of strangers
                  fell softly and balmily, silent, patient, and mournful, came slowly back to life
                  and health. Dr. Darley had written to her brother immediately on his return. He
                  had seen the body of Richard deposited in the stranger's vault, ready to be
                  removed where it could mingle with Southern dust. He had ministered to the young
                  and sorely stricken widow, as physician, friend, comforter, and father.</p>
               <p>She had another devoted friend, of whose sympathy she for some time took little
                  heed; but, as her perceptions quickened, she was conscious that a dark form often
                  lingered in her apartment at night, and sometimes when she awakened it was shading
                  her pillow. At first, she would start, and utter the name of Crissy, but she soon
                  learned to distinguish its lineaments from hers. They were very ugly, but there
                  was a redeeming expression of honesty and sincerity, which prevented them from
                  being altogether repulsive. It was nobody but Judy, who, after having accomplished
                  her daily work, would put on her cleanest clothes, and steal up into the room
                  where Crissy's young mistress lay, and watch by her, as if she were a little
                  child.</p>
               <p>"You are very good," said Ildegerte, one night, when she was left alone with Judy;
                  and, forgetting that she was in a free state, she added, "To whom do you
                  belong?"</p>
               <p>"I belongs to a mighty mean missus, just now, honey —dat's my own ugly, black
                  self. I'm tired of being my own missus, dat I am. Wish you'd take me, missus—won't
                  ask you one copper—only let me live wid you. I tells Crissy to beg you—tells her a
                  heap of times how miserable I was—but she done run off herself, like de
                  aggravatinest fool that ever was born."</p>
               <p>"Poor Crissy!" said Ildegerte, gently. "I am not angry with her."</p>
               <p>"Lord bless you, missus; if you ain't an angel, there ain't none in de kingdom
                  come. Crissy was great big fool, dat she was; but dem white-eyed, no-account
                  people—dey wan't no quality folks, missus—sorter bewitched her and made her uneasy
                  and uncontented. She neber run away of her own cospiracy. Hunded times she say to
                  me—'Judy,' ses she, 'I've got the best missus and massa in de whole universe. Dey
                  neber gin me one single stripe, scarce eber speak de cross word or gin de cross
                  look.' 'Crissy,' ses I, 'tank de Lord for his goodness. Good massa de great
                  blessing. If de Lord had gin 'em me I neber run away in de life.'"</p>
               <p>"And did you run away, poor creature, from a cruel master?" asked Ildegerte,
                  compassionately.</p>
               <p>"Yes, honey. He mighty bad man. Eberybody 'spise him, black and white. He treated
                  his wife awfully. I do b'lieve she done dead of de broken heart. He got drunk and
                  beat her, and left de black Satan mark on her bosom. No wonder he whip and beat de
                  niggers, when he neber spare good missy. She neber<pb n="292-293"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000149"/> 'buse us—she treat us mighty kind, but hi! didn't
                  he make up for't, raring and taring and swearing like old Sam heself? Well, he
                  kept on aggravating me, worse and worse, when one night he sent me tramping in de
                  cornfield arter someting I neber left dere. I kept tinking 'bout de big riber and
                  de free folks over de riber, and I come down to it jist as de boat gwine to cross,
                  jist as de smoke go puff, puff in de air. Heap of folks gwine to cross. I steals
                  in behind dem. Dat's de way I run off; but bless de heart, missus, I've seen
                  sights 'since dat time. I go to white folks—ask for de work—dey say dey no use for
                  de cornfield nigger like me. When I get work dey make me do all de drungery of de
                  bus'ness. Den I get sick—nobody care—pay de doctor bill, pay de board. Wonder how
                  much got left?"</p>
               <p>Judy paused for breath, and drew the sleeve of her left arm across her face.
                  Ildegerte felt very weary, and would gladly have been left to her own sad
                  thoughts; but she pitied the poor, forlorn being, who knew so little how to
                  appropriate the freedom she had won. She thought of Crissy and sighed—Crissy, who
                  had been so tenderly cared for, now perhaps friendless and homeless.</p>
               <p>"Won't missus let poor July wait on her? I'd go down, crawling all de way on he
                  hands and knees, if you only let me go back to de South when you go."</p>
               <p>At the mention of her Southern home, the vision of its sweet acacia groves,
                  flowering vines, and bowers of roses, associated with the remembrances of her
                  early love, rose bloomingly before her,—then she recollected her desolate
                  widowhood, and burst into an agony of tears. To go back a widowed wife, a forsaken
                  mistress! Oh! how sad!</p>
               <p>"The Lord forgib me for dis!" cried Judy. "I no business to talk and make her
                  cry—bless her tender little heart."</p>
               <p>"Don't talk any more now," said Ildegerte, when she had subdued her emotion. "I
                  will not forget you, and if I live to return, you shall go with me in place of
                  poor, faithless Crissy."</p>
               <p>It were vain to attempt a description of Judy's joy and gratitude. She laughed and
                  cried at the same moment, then ran out of the room, that she could give more noisy
                  vent to her feelings; then coming back immediately, rocked herself backwards and
                  forwards, pressing the palms of her hands together and whispering "glory." Poor
                  Judy had never known what real kindness and sympathy was, before. Under the
                  dominion of a harsh and brutal man, the discipline of her life had developed but
                  two traits—sullen endurance of wrong at one time, and a bitter, galling sense of
                  them at another. Her master was cruel to her, cruel to all his negroes, but more
                  cruel to his wife and children, because their hearts felt the wounds of his
                  unkindness more keenly. But he was not <emph>irresponsible</emph> for all this. He
                  was looked upon with the same detestation that the criminal<pb n="294-295"
                     xml:id="VAC6694-00000150"/> is, who violates the immutable laws of God and man.
                  Good men shunned his fellowship, and the social ban was on his brow.</p>
               <p>After having gained her freedom, Judy knew not how to enjoy it. She always spoke
                  of herself in such a depreciatory manner that people, judging her by her own
                  estimate, thought her a "good-for-nothing nigger," and refused to employ her. When
                  fortunate enough to obtain employment, the white servants looked upon her as an
                  underling, and imposed upon her the most laborious and servile tasks. Crissy's
                  description of her Southern home, of the contentment and comfort that reigned
                  there, of the kindness of her mistress and master, and the many privileges she
                  enjoyed, had excited an intense desire to belong to the same household. All the
                  latent sensibilities of her nature were called forth by the sufferings of the
                  beautiful young creature left so desolate, so lone; and she was perfectly sincere
                  when she said that she was willing to crawl on her hands and knees, if she were
                  only permitted to follow her, all the days of her life.</p>
               <p>We would not depreciate the value of freedom. It is a glorious possession, but its
                  glory depends upon the character of the nation or individual that owns it. Has it
                  yet reflected glory or honour on the negro race? Let the voice of history answer.
                  Turn to the islands where the emancipated slave revels in unmolested freedom. Turn
                  to St. Domingo, where, more than sixty years since, it placed upon its brow a
                  sable crown, and took into its hands an ebon sceptre, and abjured the dominion of
                  the white man. Under the most propitious influences it commenced the exercise of
                  its regal power. What aspect does its government and society now present?
                  Lawlessness, rapine, and murder defy, with furious license, the laws of the first,
                  and idleness, licentiousness, and blasphemy are the distinguishing features of the
                  last. Too indolent to labour, too reckless to provide for future want, with
                  scarcely energy enough to pluck the delicious productions of their rich tropic
                  clime, the lords of this beautiful isle live like the brutes that perish;
                  indulging in vices as exuberant as their vegetation, and fierce and desolating as
                  the storms of the equinox.</p>
               <p>Do the British West India Isles exhibit a nobler administration, a purer morality?
                  Emancipation there has been the work of a later day, and yet the same dark scenes
                  of violence and rapine destroy the brightness of these gems of the ocean, and
                  change to the hue of blood their emerald dye. Unlicensed liberty riots amid the
                  ruins of industry, order, and peace. Even the most awful visitations of heaven, to
                  which these glowing regions are subject, have no power to check their crimes or to
                  chasten their unhallowed spirits. Amid the convulsions of nature, the throes of
                  the earthquake, the shrieks of the tempest, they indulge in the wildest excesses
                  of sin, and commit the most fearful outrages. Has liberty proved a blessing to
                  this lawless and degenerate<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6694-00000151"/> generate
                  people? Can the ark of freedom float secure over these turbid and billowy waves of
                  passion, strife, and crime?</p>
               <p>Could Great Britain have anticipated the result, when she lavished her hundred
                  millions for the emancipation of these islands, so glorious in their beauty, so
                  wondrous in their fertility, now in moral ruin and decay, would she not have
                  appropriated it to the relief of her own starving children, of her nominally free,
                  but literally and practically enslaved poor?</p>
               <p>For thousands of years past, the Africans have existed in their own country as a
                  separate people, free, as they came from the hands of God; yet what one solitary
                  step have they taken in the great march of civilization, beneath whose majestic
                  tramp the universe is resounding? While other nations, all around and about it,
                  have been advancing with mighty strides, Africa has remained, <emph>as a
                     nation,</emph> in the same low, degraded condition in which it pleased the
                  Great Creator to place her. Surrounded by the gorgeous beauty and luxuriance of a
                  tropic clime, with such magnificent materials ready for its use, can agriculture
                  show one improvement made by its slothful hands? Do the mechanic arts owe it one
                  invention? Does the music of manufacture echo over its rolling streams? No; in the
                  depth and darkness of the ignorance, slothfulness, sensuality, and heathenism in
                  which it was sunk nearly four thousand years ago, it still exists, and God has not
                  laid bare his omnipotent arm to exalt it in the scale of being. As it was in the
                  beginning, so it is now.</p>
               <p>Why not arraign the Almighty with injustice and partiality, in creating one nation
                  for glory and honour, and another for dishonour and degradation? Why not arraign
                  Him, in whose sight all the nations of the earth are but as grasshoppers, and as a
                  drop of water in the boundless ocean of infinitude? Him, who in the mighty work of
                  creation, has exhibited a gradually widening and ascending glory, through all the
                  vast range of inanimate and animated nature,—from the worm that writhes in the
                  dust, <q>
                     <l>"To the rapt seraph that adores and burns."</l>
                  </q> Have you ever stood at the foot of the ladder, and then mounted, yea, from
                  the lowest abyss of earth? The steps are at first muddy and slimy and loathsome,
                  but as you go upward and upward they become golden rounds, and by and by, you can
                  see the angels of God ascending and descending, as in the dream of the patriarch.
                  Why this great graduated scale? Son of man, answer!—why?</p>
               <p>But is Africa free, as a nation? Its negro population is estimated at sixty
                  millions, and of this number, probably forty thousand are slaves,—slaves under a
                  bondage of iron, a yoke of thorns.<ref rend="super" target="#note_004"

                        after month, with unrelaxing vigilance, baffled his design. At length, in a
                        fit of desperation and rage, he set fire to the building in which they were
                        imprisoned, and all of the <emph>eight thousand</emph> human beings were
                        burned to ashes. Not one escaped.</p>
                  </note><pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6694-00000152"/> is indeed
                  irresponsible; he has the power of life and death over his vassals; and when the
                  infirmities of age throw them helpless and therefore useless on his hands, he
                  crushes them as regardlessly as you would the reptile crawling in the dust. On the
                  death of a king or a chief, whole hecatombs of slaves are slaughtered to bear him
                  company in the grave, and bow to his sovereignty in the spirit-land,—thus
                  extending their idea of servitude beyond the dividing line of time and eternity!
                  Nor is this all; when once the thirst of blood is kindled by the sacrificial
                  knife, they ofttimes keep the sword of massacre unsheathed till whole towns are
                  bathed in the crimson tide! And most of these direful deeds are perpetrated in the
                  name of religion, showing how dim and dark and awful are their ideas of God and
                  futurity! how thick, how impenetrable the blackness that shrouds their moral and
                  spiritual vision!</p>
               <p>That Africa is not a fallen nation, degraded from its original position, is proved
                  by abundant testimony. In no part of the continent, where the <emph>native
                     negro</emph> exists, are there any remains of antiquity, any ruins or
                  hieroglyphics, to prove a state of past civilization and refinement. He has left
                  no more monuments than the beasts of the field, or the fowls of the air. Nature
                  reigns there in all the grandeur and beauty of its virgin prime; but man has left
                  no records of his plastic and improving hand. It is not so in other lands. Look at
                  Asia,—no matter how low and degraded some of its regions may be, you will find the
                  traces of ancient art and civilization. You will see the ruined temple, the
                  deserted shrine, the dilapidated dwelling, telling of a once cultivated if now
                  degenerate race. Even statuary and painting, the two most glorious handmaids of
                  art, have left the print of their gilding footsteps, amid the desolation and
                  gloom.</p>
               <p>Look at our own continent. The Aborigines of America, with a few exceptions, were
                  in as dark and savage condition as the native African. Yet, here were found
                  similar ruins and evidences of ancient art. Indeed, wherever the white man and the
                  bronze and red man exist, there is the indubitable stamp of present or ancient
                  civilization; but no lingering ray of former genius or art, streaming on her night
                  of darkness, tells that poor degraded Africa ever enjoyed a more exalted
                  destiny.</p>
               <p>At home, she is involved in shadows whose blackness, intense as the hue of her
                  skin, is unrelieved by the brightness of the day-star of hope. In our own Southern
                  land, amid lowliness and slavery, she has learned to lift up her hands unto God.
                  Of her three million children dwelling in servitude here, more than <emph>six
                     hundred</emph>

               <p>Rejoice, benighted Africa! Is not He, who led the children of Israel through
                  bondage and chains to the green borders of the promised land, leading thee also,
                  in His own appointed way, to the glorious liberty of the children of God?</p>
               <p>"I am the Lord and there is none else, there is no God besides me. I girded thee
                  though thou hast not known me.</p>
               <p>"That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is
